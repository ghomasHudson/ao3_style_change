Sherlock is sitting slumped back in his armchair, one foot pushing at a stack of books on the floor in front of him. He’s gradually shoving the book on top of the pile further and further towards the edge. Waiting for the moment when the balance will shift. Waiting for the moment when the book will tip over and tumble on to the floor.
He almost doesn’t dare to ask.
This time, he stays.
While John tries to at least pretend to keep up with Sherlock’s monologue, it suddenly occurs to him that it’s been a long time since Sherlock has done this, speed-talking while trying to explain something he finds of interest. It’s been quite a while since they’ve had an afternoon like this with no Mary to navigate around, no clients to listen to and no wedding planning to get done, just an afternoon for the two of them alone to do with as they please. And for just a short moment, the sheer amount of
“Sherlock.”
John feels like shouting.
Maybe they can go for a walk together. Talk in private while they walk as they used to back when they were first dating and John couldn’t stand to sit still for long. Maybe he can lay it all out, plain and clear. Offer her the truth and see what she wants to do with it. She used to be such a wonderful listener, hearing John complain and explain and despair for hours on end without ever seeming annoyed. Perhaps he can talk to her about this as well, talk to her and apologise and see where it goes from there. At least then he wouldn’t be lying to her, wouldn’t be hiding away at Baker Street, citing Sherlock’s medical condition as the reason when really at least part of the explanation is that John doesn’t know what to do.
Sherlock draws in a shaky breath through his mouth and slowly, very slowly, he begins to talk.
“Honestly? No, I don’t think I understand him.”
The tears finally overflow and he hides his face in one of his hands in a vain attempt to prevent her from seeing them.
He wanted to pretend that everything was nice and good and normal, that they were nothing more than a happily married couple with their best friend.
They enter the complex and the unnerving sensation intensifies. It should just be the two of them in here, but it’s as though he can hear the faintest glimmers of separate footfalls. One – no, two of them sound as though they were made by high heels. The third is resolute, quick, harsh. Clearly someone agitated. Balance of probability says it’s a man. A short man, judging by the frequency of the sounds. His stride is not very long compared to the high heels. A strange feeling is settling in Sherlock’s stomach, heavy and nauseating.
So yes. It's as though John is back on the battlefield, but it doesn't
John can’t say he’d be particularly surprised if that turned out to be true.
It’s so quiet.
Sherlock looks down at his hands. Flexes his fingers as far back as they will comfortably go and then some.
is, when they’re both the way they are. But also of how, despite them both being the way they are, they’ve somehow managed to get here, to this moment, and it feels like everything Sherlock has always wanted, even if he didn’t understand just how much he wanted it, just how much he
It’s not just Sherlock that he blames though. Most of all, he blames himself. For being blind enough to fall for Moriarty’s obvious trick. For not staying with Sherlock when he, despite what he might have said, had needed John the most. But more than anything, he blames himself for what he said and what he didn’t say. That the last conversation they had other than that final phone call had been John shouting at him, calling him a machine, asking him if he even knew how to feel… those few moments have haunted John ever since almost as badly as the sight of blood on the pavement. He’ll never forgive himself for those words. He’ll never forgive himself for not knowing that that was the last real conversation they’d ever have.
So perhaps the question is what John himself would say. Given the opportunity, and enough stamina to not let that opportunity slip away, what should he say? He already said some of the things he has regretted not saying before. On the tube the night after Sherlock returned. He’d said that Sherlock is the best and the wisest man that John has ever known. He’d said that to Sherlock’s face and Sherlock had listened and hopefully understood that John means it. Even if he afterwards revealed that he’d once again been just about the biggest cock in the history of the world and made John talk under false pretences. It doesn’t really matter. John had been looking for an opportunity to say it anyway.
John risks a quick glance in Sherlock’s direction. Sherlock is looking at them. He saw. Of course he did. And John imagines that he catches a brief glimpse of hurt in Sherlock’s eyes. But it’s gone behind a mask of calm indifference almost before he has a chance to register its presence.
as a marriage. There’s nothing ordinary or stereotypical or normal about them. John has no intention of trying to force something like that onto Sherlock. Put a label on him in that way. On
“Dance. Both of you, now, go dance. We can’t just stand here. People will wonder what we’re talking about.”
All perfectly sound arguments, which John proceeds to ignore completely. He doesn’t interrupt or wave her off. He waits patiently for Mary to run out of arguments, then turns towards her and says what he knew would be his response before she had even opened her mouth: “You can go if you want to. I’m staying here tonight.” His tone tolerates no counterarguments. That’s all he has to say and that’s all he does say, even as Mary opens her mouth to protest. John simply returns his focus to Sherlock and, truth be told, ignores her.
John chooses to damn himself.
you really are… they did not want to play with that. Who you really are did not matter to them.”
John had already opened his mouth to ask, to demand an explanation, but now he closes it again. Sherlock already knows what John’s complaint would be. Of course he bloody does.
how he longs to remain on just one end.
And yet when Jim’s teeth close oh so carefully around his bottom lip and applies the gentlest suggestion of pressure, Sherlock’s brain teeters on the edge of a breakdown. The intensity of activity is almost too much to handle and Sherlock’s inhalation comes in the form of a gasp. Jim seizes the opportunity to replace his teeth with his tongue, an act which Sherlock has always found deeply distasteful during previous kisses. With others, it’s always felt a bit dirty and disgusting, too sloppy and wet to provide any kind of satisfaction. With Jim, it’s somehow sensual and intimate, hot in all the right ways. It stimulates the growth of a tight heat in his lower region and an itching in the tips of his fingers to
It's just about perfect, or at least as close to perfection as Sherlock is likely to experience.
He lets go.
Sherlock’s pride is the one to back down. How did he come to this? “I don’t understand.”
Sherlock hesitates at the kiss. Should he really share that? Isn’t that something that belongs to only him? Something that John has no right to know and would probably be better off not knowing in any case?
Or is he just too narcissistic to realise that he only did it for himself?
Mary sits quietly for a long time before she speaks.
As soon as that thought crosses his mind, Sherlock feels himself tense up in concern. Is his brain not able to make deductions? Is it because of what’s happening to and in his body? Wasn’t that what Jim had promised? That he could get his brain to control his body rather than the other way around? Does that mean that there is something wrong with him after all, that he isn’t able to do what Jim does? Sherlock’s breath accelerates, but this time it has nothing to do with excitement.
Fifth and final chapter! Thank you all so much for reading! This chapter can, again, be read as standalone, but is meant as a sort of completion to this five-part mini-series.
City boy, contacts in Hong Kong, sibling rivalry, serious girlfriend, multiple affairs, long-term stress, one too many cocktails on nights out, often falls asleep at meetings, hiker, holiday in Bologna last month. Health buff, freelance journalist, lib dem, sushi aficionado, journeys in China, Buddhist, bakes own bread, pays too much for organic chia seeds, compulsive tea drinker at 7-10 cups a day. Single mom, three kids, works at convenience store, has never left the UK, refers to evening meal as “tea”, unhealthy preference for abusive men. All gleaned at a glance at three random passers-by on the street below.
“How long?”
Well, to hell with it. If only just for today.
words that Sherlock has ever spoken on the subject in the entirety of John’s experience with him. It takes John’s breath away.
smartest… well, yes, that truly would be as insufferably dense as Mycroft had said.
In addition to that, you may have already noticed that I use a lot of quotes and expressions from the actual series and incorporate them in new ways in my writing. This chapter probably has more of that than any previous one, but that is deliberate. While I do enjoy a good reference, I mainly use these direct quotes or expressions to convey that Sherlock himself is re-purposing bits and pieces of conversations he remembers having had with various people. In other cases, such as when the quotes are from Sherlock's mind palace, i.e. from The Abominable Bride or from season 4, I think of them as representing Sherlock's inner dialogue with himself and thus to also be appropriate for my story.
In other words… neither of them are making this any easier.
Now that he’s thinking about it, a quick shot would be most welcome right about now. It doesn’t matter what. Cocaine, heroine, morphine, Sherlock isn’t picky.
If they could talk about these things, what would Sherlock say? Would he call John a friend? Is that something Sherlock can do, calling another person his friend in a situation where he’s not just saying whatever he can come up with in order to either apologise or manipulate? John honestly don’t know. That’s the thing about Sherlock. It’s always the unexpected.
He doesn’t say that he’d rather have had anyone else. A part of him isn’t sure he really feels that way and he doesn’t want to lie.
Of course Sherlock was aware that such a process was bound to be a painful one, but only distantly. He has tried to imagine what it might feel like to him if he were to attempt it and come up with an almost physical sense of claustrophobia, of his bones bending and creaking and giving way, his joints snapping out of place. But his understanding of that pain has always been left somewhat drained by the certainty that John chose to go through with it of his own accord. And, if Sherlock is honest, perhaps it has also been drained by the self-righteous certainty that, no matter how great John’s pain at having to mould himself to fit the expectations of others, it must ultimately be less than the pain Sherlock has had to bear all these years due to his refusal-inability to do the same. To adapt, to bend, to break, to give way. The price of staying himself has been loneliness, sometimes acute and sometimes more of a deep, sinking sensation slowly sneaking up on him when he otherwise thought himself invulnerable.
And he lost.
He lays it out, as cleanly and as honestly as he can manage, but to his deep mortification, he can feel tears pressing behind his eyes. He has no idea how Mary might react to this. No idea if she’ll hit him hard on the chin once or twice, gather her things and slam the door behind her. Perhaps that’s what he deserves. But deep inside he knows that he can’t bear to lose her, just as little as he can bear to lose Sherlock. That’s the pain of it.
At last, chapter 20. I'm really sorry, this is long overdue, but the world has kind of turned into a crazy place since my last update. I hope this extra-long chapter might make up for the delay and provide a bit of entertainment during these trying times!
“Sometimes I don’t think he
“Well, what good would it have done?” Sherlock’s eyes flare up like lightning. John almost believes he would take a step back under the weight of Sherlock's suddenly appearing anger if it was possible. But it’s not. They’re squeezed uncomfortably close together in the doorway between bathroom and corridor.
. It hurts as badly as any real migraine he’s ever had and he needs someone,
There's no apparent reason why.
Maybe Moriarty knows. Moriarty has already done what Sherlock has always struggled to do: erased emotions from his mind and focused exclusively on his brain and the pleasures derived from that. Maybe Moriarty is the one person who can help him with this, the one person who doesn’t recoil from the idea of a brain without a heart. The one person who understands how Sherlock feels, understands what it is he wants and is willing to help him achieve that.
He still hasn’t decided whether to come clean or wrap things up. Now, sitting beside her, feeling her familiar warmth with her familiar scent hanging in his nose, he isn’t even fully certain he can get himself to tell her. Despite his best intentions, he feels his brain play with the idea of just fooling her. Reassuring her that everything is at it should be and that he’ll be coming home soon.
But not this. This is the one thing Sherlock can’t, even if it's to keep Jim here.
His tone clearly conveys the mistaken belief that he’s actually being responsible. Apparently, he's satisfied with what John would loosely term his precautionary measures.
That was the first thing they’d said, the doctors.
Sherlock returns it as best he can, but he has a nagging suspicion that his expression might best be categorised as a slightly inept, likely lopsided grimace rather than anything resembling even an excuse for a smile.
with him… Sherlock can only hope and pray that John will find his trust justified.
But a subconscious association, however damning it might have seemed at first, can hardly be called evidence. And yet once he’d managed to put the pieces together bit by bit, it had all made a horrifying amount of sense in the cruellest and most twisted of ways.
The same burning questions that John still has no idea how to ask, so he doesn’t.
It might be a bit of a tall order. When John asks if they have anything a little more fun or eccentric, the member of staff currently showing him their assortment looks at him with such an exasperated expression that John almost feels bad for asking until he remembers that he is in fact a customer planning on making a purchase, at which point his temperament hardens considerably.
“I chose you and that was when I woke up! That was
It’s a shame, really. Looking around, even Sherlock can admit to the flat needing a thorough clean up in the near future and he had almost considered doing so today to avoid John’s inevitable outrage. John has a way with words in these situations, but his way with bodily postures and expressions of exacerbation are in a league of their own, and Sherlock likes to think that he’s willing to go to great lengths to avoid witnessing them. Within certain limits, of course. But now cleaning up is definitely out of the question. What’s the point in cleaning up an empty flat?
Moriarty smirks and stretches comfortably, splaying his limbs out over the bench they’re both occupying in Regent Park.
He’s halfway across the room.
Sherlock takes a moment to consider his reply. A part of him wants desperately to lie, but then what would be the point in providing an answer at all?
What the hell is the matter with him? Why can’t he just be
John chuckles softly. “Yeah, alright, alright, we’re both used to worse, I guess.
John is never silent either. Even when he isn’t speaking, he’s always making some form of noise. The steady huff when he breathes, the soft sounds his clothes make when he shifts or the various minor exhalations of air he uses to communicate all the things he doesn’t want to communicate, from annoyance to arousal. Sherlock knows all those sounds. He has them catalogued. Then there are all the sounds John creates around him. The regulated clicks of the keyboard when he’s typing, interspersed with moments of contemplation while he tries to formulate the next sentence. The sound of flowing water when he’s pouring tea, then a quick splash of milk and, occasionally, the rustle of sugar and the brief clang when he puts the lid back on the pot, quickly and conspiratorially, as though he’s done a bad thing and expects Sherlock to comment on it. John usually takes his tea black. Or with a little milk if he’s left the bag in too long, which isn’t unusual. Sugar is reserved for early evenings after long shifts, early mornings after all-night cases or middays when he’s particularly exasperated about something. Sherlock has noticed. He always does where John is concerned. Every little scrap of information, every deduction no matter how simple, meticulously stored away and catalogued together with everything else to do with John Watson.
Kissing women has always been one thing. Warm, comforting, reassuring in its familiarity, sensual and intense, but always predictable. Always safe. John has loved many women and kissed even more, and though he’s nearly always enjoyed those kisses, they have also all felt more or less the same.
Sherlock puts the phone back on the table and gathers his hands in front of him. Not completely unexpected. John cancels their appointments more often than he used to, doesn’t he? A part of Sherlock chips in with the unwelcome contribution that that’s only to be expected when two people stop living together, even more so when one of them makes the decision to get engaged. Sherlock hurries to strangle that thought before it has time to develop properly.
But he loves Mary too, and she’s the one he’s committed himself to. She’s the choice he’s made. Not Sherlock.
Christ… how much effort it must have taken to keep his back hidden from view these past few days. John has been living in the same flat, rubbing shoulders with him day and night, changing his actual fucking clothes for him until he could manage on his own and he’s been none the wiser up until this moment. How could he have been so goddamn
It’s surprisingly quiet.
Sherlock’s brain helpfully conjures up at least a thousand possible responses in the nanosecond it takes Jim to answer, most of them involving Jim turning away from him in disgust and him going back to his sad, lonely little flat all alone and shooting up tonight and maybe that dealer on the corner of Church Street is still in business and Sherlock is certain that he has an emergency stack of cash somewhere that might just be enough and…
A part of him wants to ask Sherlock about it, if nothing else then just to offer him the opportunity to share whatever it is that’s bothering him so.
And please stay safe and healthy everyone!
His inner monologue turns increasingly petulant as yet more time goes by. Which is not quite as annoying as it’s relieving, if only because it’s been quite a while since the last time he was able to successfully distinguish his own voice and thoughts from everything else happening in his mind. Still, he should probably send a text to John and ask him when he’s planning to show up. Just for good measure. Sherlock reaches a hand down to the floor, blindly searching for the shape of his phone and eventually withdrawing in triumph.
“It’s… not good.”
Sherlock frowns. “I had nothing else to go on.”
Not moving a muscle.
eye-roll. John favours the latter. To his surprise, though, Mycroft doesn’t return the courtesy with one of his trademark sarcastic comments or condescending remarks. He doesn’t even sigh. He just exhales with a bit of sound and the corners of his mouth curl up in the closest approximation to a smile of relief that John has ever seen.
What angers John more than anything else, however, is that he isn’t just angry. He
He’s a bit more quiet for starters. Sherlock has always been a loudmouth, saying whatever he wants to at whatever time he wants to, to John’s chagrin without much concern for diplomacy or even common decency. He’s still like that most of the time, but there’s a silence about him now that John can’t remember ever having seen before. Most of the time, he’s just as domineering and grand as John remembers. But then there’s other times when he speaks in a quiet, almost subdued manner, or doesn’t speak at all for long periods of time. He’s gone home early from cases a couple of times, complaining of a headache. Missing out on a case because of something that, to Sherlock’s mind, must be categorised as nothing more than a minor inconvenience is something he’s never done before. It’s gotten to a point now that John seriously feels the need to bring it up or even suggest that he go see a doctor about it, but Sherlock just shrugs off any questions and puts it down to a lack of food or drink, which is admittedly plausible.
“Let me stop you there, John.”
Sherlock is, despite what some may think, not a brain without a heart. That’s not him. It never has been, much as he may wish it so. But now, finally, he wishes it so to a degree where he’s desperate enough to try anything. He can’t live like this anymore. He can’t live with the way he’s been cast into the world, too betwixt and between to truly belong anywhere. A brain that’s too different for him to be normal, too extraordinary for him to be liked. And a heart that’s too fragile to bear how lonely that makes him feel. That’s how it’s always been. But now he can’t live with it anymore.
been worth it. He’d made a mistake. Sherlock knows this now.
“I don’t think I can.”
On the second day, Mrs. Hudson comes up with a cup of tea, luckily in between Moriarty’s visits. Sherlock is so relieved to see her that he almost tells her so, but thinks better of it at the last moment and settles for simply ignoring her good-humouredly as she chides him about the state of the flat and complains that she hasn’t seen him for several days. She disappears into the kitchen. Sherlock hears the sound of the fridge opening and her exasperated sigh. If it’s due to a lack of food or an abundance of food way past best before, Sherlock can’t tell. He might have discovered it if he hadn’t tuned out of Mrs. Hudson’s rantings about three seconds in. But he does offer a reassuring smile when she heads for the door and promises to stop by next time he’s heading out.
Well, sod it.
understand. But if only... if he knew about it, all of it, if Sherlock tried to give him access, tried to explain, about Jim and Mycroft and Battersea Power Station and what it all meant and how he's now in this body that doesn't feel like
Being this mistaken when anticipating the responses of the one person Sherlock feels he knows best is disconcerting to say the least. If he could only gather his thoughts, maybe he could figure out how to undo tonight and make everything better tomorrow. That godawful creaking doesn’t leave much space for thought processes, though. Sherlock has never had an actual migraine before, but he expects the feeling to be vaguely similar to how he feels now. He has attempted to block it out with painkillers as one would a migraine, unsuccessfully. The creaking continues, sufficiently loud at the moment to pose an obstacle to clear reasoning and analysis. Instead, Sherlock is left with no other option than to turn the evening’s events over in his mind again and again without reaching any conclusion. An activity as frustrating as it is pointless, but Sherlock can’t sleep now.
“See snow! Snow! See snow!”
He pulls back. Just as abruptly and with just as much force as he used to push Sherlock back a few seconds prior.
He nods but doesn’t dare to speak.
That had given John a bit of pause. Had he actually
A light bulb flickers overhead. It’s vaguely reminiscent of one of John’s stupidly predictable horror movies, one of the ones he’s made Sherlock sit through on at least four separate occasions. As soon as that comparison enters his head, the light goes out entirely. Control is not something of which Sherlock currently has an abundance. It takes him a solid ten seconds to remember where he’s placed the switch. A few experimental flicks manages to fix the problem temporarily, and the hallway in front of him is once again semi-visible in the ugly, diffuse yellow of the bulb.
of all people, shushing John in the restaurant like one would an over-excited five year old and staying behind with Sherlock after John had headed out to find a cab. Since he hasn't cared to ask, he doesn’t even know what they had spoken of. And then that relaxed statement in the cab,
As he looks around the flat, it becomes apparent that he is also alone in another way. John still isn’t here. In a way, it disappoints him that John is taking his time. He said he would hurry, didn’t he? The sun is already visible as a thin line between the curtains. Why isn’t he here already? On the other hand, when John
“Just like old times.”
And John himself is no better, drinking himself confident enough to make a not-so-subtle move on Sherlock at the stag night prior to his marriage to Mary. Of all times. Jesus, he’s such a mess. The hurt, guilt and betrayal that John felt at Sherlock’s apparent suicide might be lifting, but the results of it are more apparent than ever. If Sherlock hadn’t jumped… Christ, just the thought of it makes John want to scream. If only Sherlock hadn’t jumped, hadn’t gone off alone and left John to think the worst for two whole Goddamn years. Then he never would have had to change everything to avoid the worst reminders of their life together. He never would have had to move out of Baker Street and find a new flat. He never would have had to find a new job and then he never would have met Mary at the new clinic. He never would have needed a companion so badly that he jumped at the opportunity when he perceived that she was interested in starting a relationship. And even then, if Sherlock had just come back two months before he did, it wouldn’t have seemed like such a big deal to break it off again with Mary. They hadn’t been that serious then and it wouldn’t have seemed like that much of a loss to end the relationship. As it was, by the time Sherlock did actually come back, John and Mary had just moved in together and were entering that we’re-both-getting-older-so-let’s-just-get-on-with-starting-a-family-and-all-that phase. With things as uncertain with Sherlock as they had been in the beginning and John seriously questioning if he could ever forgive Sherlock for what he’d done, it had seemed too risky and unnecessary to end a good relationship just to be able to dedicate himself more fully to a definitely-not-good relationship instead. Now it’s all too late and John ought to just resign himself to that. Some chances, once lost, never present themselves again. He’s with someone else now, someone who’s been everything she promised she would be and more. It’s relaxed, it’s comfortable and, more than anything, it’s safe. Someone who doesn’t make John feel as though his emotions are fighting a war inside his head and doesn’t require him to constantly question his own sexuality. That ought to be enough. It’s better than what most people can get.
With that in mind, Sherlock’s almost immediate acceptance of Mary’s presence, her intrusion into a sphere previously containing just John and Sherlock, comes as a welcome surprise. They get along fairly well, at least that’s what John thinks. Mary thankfully isn’t put off by Sherlock’s sometimes unreasonable personality and habits. She isn’t a nuisance or a lag either, as some of John’s previous girlfriends has tended to be. Overall, Mary’s presence is more than tolerable and her growing influence on their at-home crime solving sessions has directed them towards a solution on more than one occasion.
God forbid that the inner machinations of Sherlock Holmes should ever be revealed to mere mortals.
Plans change when you inadvertently open the lid on three years’ worth of longing and hidden feelings that should have stayed firmly locked away.
Sherlock isn’t being sarcastic or degrading. He’s listening. He even takes his eyes off the fireplace to look at John instead.
“What?”
expression he’s ever worn.
Eventually Sherlock is the one to do it. He gets up from the couch, huddling slightly forward as he’s taken to doing recently when his energy reserves are running low, and makes for his bedroom. For a few horrible seconds, John fears that he might simply disappear into his room and close the door and let that be the end of it, putting them back to square one. But Sherlock turns to him when he’s halfway through the door.
Sherlock can feel a slight moisture building in his eyes and averts his gaze, willing his weakness to go away. It’s too true, all of it.
But that’s all in the past now. Some choices and chances, once wasted, never present themselves again. Some people, once abandoned, never turn up again. Or, if they do, they are not the same any longer and can’t or won’t offer what they used to. These scant few days Sherlock has been granted with John that feel just like old times are better than he could have hoped for and certainly more than he deserves.
As if that could ever justify what he has put John through. What was it all for? All the long conversations held with the empty air in his bedroom, all the painful stabs in his chest at the sight of a long coat, all the confused ramblings aimed at himself in his guilt and regret, his stream of consciousness going from one thing to the next without ever focusing directly on what it was all about. And now, all of it for bloody nothing, because Sherlock Holmes apparently isn’t even capable of staying dead. Returns from the grave as if he routinely smashes his head to pieces on the pavement five stories below him for the fun of it and then plays hide and seek for two years just to mess with everyone who ever cared about him. Then he turns up without as much as an explanation because John apparently matters way less to him than staging a dramatic entrance.
That day, the day he woke up for the first time in the hospital… he barely remembers waking up, everything had been blurry and confusing and he’d lost consciousness again so quickly that he’d barely understood what was going on. What he
It’s a full hour before Sherlock wakes up again, by which time Lestrade and Molly have both come and gone (understandable seeing as it’s actually a perfectly ordinary Wednesday afternoon – the idea of normal, everyday life happening outside of the four walls of the hospital seems a weirdly surreal concept). The congregation still numbers John, Mary, Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft, though, which is certainly more than Sherlock had been expecting, judging by his expression. He squints his eyes, an endearing little frown line appearing between his eyebrows, and looks around dizzily. His gaze is unfocused and sweeps across each face in turn without pausing for any details to really sink in. He’s still well and truly under, then. Had Sherlock been fully awake, he would never have allowed himself to be out for a full three days and then not pause for deductions upon returning to the real world.
just like old times.
Mary is holding his hand. It’s for reassurance, but it’s for a bit of grounding as well. She’s not being particularly gentle. Quite obviously, she’s trying to prevent him from making an arse of himself. Which he honestly appreciates because he’s not sure he’s capable of doing that himself at the moment.
John’s face sets in a grim line.
John promises to stay before he has time to talk with Mary about it.
People who think that not seeing something coming is the worst thing you can experience are idiots. Idiots who never see anything coming and thus have nothing to compare with. The worst thing by far is to see it all coming and yet wilfully head straight for the abyss. Then it truly is a bitter feeling when you're on the way down.
“Let me stop you there,” he repeats. “Because you’re not making any sense. Your gratitude, I’ll take that if it makes you feel better. But everything else… You’re right. Having a child and being in a relationship have never been something I’ve aspired to. For the longest time, I’d sworn off relationships entirely. I was sure I’d never have a child until
This is what Sherlock needs to hear. An encouragement to not feel, to think rationally, to close off instead of being swept away. A reminder that caring is not an advantage and emotions make you weak. Mycroft’s tendency to use every opportunity to rub Sherlock’s emotions in his face is actually what he needs to hear sometimes. It adds much needed fuel to the parts of his brain supplying him with cold analyses and logical arguments. Spurs his less emotional side into action. So too does it work today.
All those things John has been holding back for years. All those things he couldn’t tell Sherlock or his therapist or Mary or anyone else. All those things he can barely tell himself, even in the privacy of his own head. All those things that keep resurfacing over and over again. While Sherlock was the only one John was close to. While Sherlock was gone. While John was in therapy. While John was alone and in mourning and curled up in the foetal position in the darkest corner of his bedroom. While John was out drinking to cope. While John was with Mary. While John proposed. And now while Sherlock is back and John is technically engaged. It’s like having a song stuck in your head. You can’t get rid of it. You can’t let it go until you’ve finished it and John doesn’t know the words.
Jim is his complimentary other half. He’s here when no one else is and he wants the same as Sherlock. He’s promised not to leave if Sherlock will only do this one thing.
Then John phones Mrs. Hudson, Molly and Lestrade while he waits, feeling strangely responsible for communicating Sherlock’s altered state to his (well,
Mary steps away as he speaks and John braces himself for her response. She doesn’t look particularly upset, but then sometimes that’s just the first warning that it’s worse than initially predicted.
He sighs. “Well… look, it’s a long story and it wasn’t even all that important. We had a bit of a row… which is perfectly normal by the way, don’t give me that look…” Sherlock isn’t sure what look John is referring to, so he doesn’t know how to change it. When John looks at him pointedly, he raises both eyebrows innocently. It produces another wearied sigh, though Sherlock can’t help but detect a slight twinkle of fond amusement that in turn makes him feel strangely warm and fuzzy all over again.
Jim sighs softly. There's no resentment, just a deep sympathy.
They must be from his two years abroad then. A cold, sinking sensation reaches John’s stomach at that realisation. He’s never even asked about it. Because he always thought…
He can’t say he’s proud of the way he’s chosen to live up to that vow so far.
Sherlock is looking at him, eyes wide and still ringed with tears. His mouth is open, lips moist and slightly swollen from John’s unexpected assault, and his lower lip trembles.
! He used to despise people for what he had considered oversentimentality at the time. He’s so much worse than any of them now. He can feel it cloying his mind, weighing down his brain with useless thoughts devoid of logic that can’t possibly lead to any solution. He remembers his words of three years ago to Irene Adler – “I’ve always believed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof” – and almost laughs bitterly at the realisation that the supposed final proof was not enough to keep him from repeating her mistakes.
When they finally part, it’s with a sigh and a shuddering exhale. Sherlock’s cheeks are lightly flushed, a reddish tint to his usually so pale skin. John’s own skin has heated up as well and he can only imagine that
And that had been it. The look in Sherlock’s eyes then, the softness of his voice as he all but whispered “I heard you”. It had felt a bit like taking a punch to the stomach. It had felt a bit like having the air knocked out of him. That look and that voice had been unfamiliar, something that John at the time had never gotten from Sherlock before. At least not in any way that had impressed strongly enough upon his mind for him to still remember it.
“Well, Doctor Watson? What has he taken?”
Sherlock strains slightly up towards him in expectation of another kiss, which doesn’t come. Jim continues to talk, either not noticing Sherlock’s invitation or deliberately flat out ignoring it. Given that this is Jim Moriarty, it’s painfully obvious which of the two is the most likely explanation.
Sherlock’s voice momentarily falters. There’s a wetness around the edges of his eyes that looks horrifyingly like tears.
“This Christmas. I know it’s not something you, you know… something you really do. I know you’re making an effort and I know it’s for Rosie’s and my sake. I see it.”
of it. There are some things they’re probably both better off with John not knowing. Although just now… it doesn’t feel as though it really matters.
true. The one person Sherlock cares about, trusts, knows is John Watson and yet it would not be entirely amiss to think of Jim Moriarty as well.
The whole matching set of mittens, scarf and hat is actually a present from Sherlock’s mom and dad. As though their penchant for overspending on their children around Christmas wasn’t hateful enough as it was, now, with the arrival of what Sherlock’s mother can’t stop referring to with pride and joy as “their first grandchild” (not that there’s another on the horizon, as far as Sherlock can tell), they’ve really taken it to new heights with packages of advent presents for Rosie and batches of homemade Christmas cookies arriving in the mail before December had even properly begun.
want to stay. Even though he knows he shouldn’t, even though the guilt is gnawing at him to return to his new wife and his new home where he ought to belong, what he really wants to do is stay here with Sherlock.
“You’ll be the death of me,” John says, lightly to make sure Sherlock understands that he’s mostly joking. For a small part, though, he means it.
“I’ll help you if I can. But I think you’re the one who needs to make the decision.”
“I can’t… I can’t do it, Jim. I don’t know how to…”
A finger is placed over his lips (slightly shaking, damn them) and the sheer reality of that touch alone is enough to pin Sherlock to the spot, voice cords curling together uselessly. He is not asleep. He is not high. He is not seeing things. This is real.
John enters the living room to find Sherlock sitting partly upright on the couch, staring towards the kitchen with a strangely intent look on his face. The instant John emerges, it’s replaced with an expression that he has no idea how to interpret. Sherlock sags slightly as though the tense anticipation has been drained away and replaced with relief (or disappointment). A miniscule frown line appears between Sherlock’s brows. His lower lip vibrates (trembles?) slightly as he lets out the breath he seems to have been holding.
or any other outrageous synonym for
That fragile illusion is shattered the first time Mary calls. She hasn't phoned since the infamous incident a couple of days ago when she’d hung up on him during a particularly vicious argument. An argument about John’s level of devotion to Sherlock contra his level of devotion to Mary and their marriage.
Sherlock looks thoroughly unimpressed. “I was in full control of it,” is all he says to defend himself. As if John as a doctor could believe that and just accept it as the truth because Sherlock tells him to.
This isn’t about rumours or public images. This isn't about the legend, isn’t about the stories, isn’t about the adventures.
Perhaps he should have seen it coming. He should have expected it to happen. He should have known that he would never be able to hold on to anything that good. But he was blind and stupid. And it hit him so much harder as a result.
, could have sat with him on this very sofa at this very moment, with Jim’s arm wrapped around him instead of John’s and Jim whispering mischievous, ill-intentioned little quips into his ear along with logistical puzzles for him to solve and cleverly disguised endearments.
Sherlock pulls away only enough to meet his gaze and grins with a depth and sincerity John hasn’t seen in him in a long time. It’s practically a smirk, yet it’s too honest to carry any sarcasm. John feels himself respond in kind, but the ecstatic power of the moment, without any thought for the consequences, has left him along with Sherlock’s lips. The too familiar gnawing guilt and concern once again wrap themselves around his insides, fighting for room with the exaltation their kiss has produced.
this year rather than experiment and end up with the depressing rush of his own past Christmases or the anti-festive avoidance of Sherlock’s.
When the silence begins to get stifling, John sighs. He gives a slight nod in an attempt to make it seem as though they’ve reached some sort of agreement and that the past ten minutes of conversation has actually led to something other than discomfort and embarrassment. Then he heads out in the kitchen to make himself a desperately needed cup of tea.
Finally, Sherlock seems to snap out of his reverie and produce a non-cryptic response. “Yes.” His eyes are glittering and steely, focused solely on Mycroft. He doesn’t look fully human, not with his rigid posture, still as a statue, or the quick, almost reptilian movements of his head.
He always has.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
) closest friends, including Molly, Mary and Lestrade.
? Why can't he just be like other people? Why must everything always be like this for him? A few, scant, hidden moments of forbidden thoughts and wants concealed within an overall respectable, nice,
It’s in the cab on the way to Baker Street that Sherlock starts to talk. It takes John by surprise at first – Sherlock has been mostly silent for so many days now and only spoken when he hasn’t been able to communicate nonverbally through scoffs, looks and gestures that John had simply assumed that he wasn’t capable of speaking with greater complexity just yet. Indeed, he’s been silent for the first five minutes of their trip, looking out of the window on his side of the cab at the city passing by outside without making any attempt at contact. His voice catches John off guard.
“The one with the briefcase?”
“Have a lovely day and do give the happy couple my best.”
“And I wish I was like you. I really do. I just… I can’t. I’m not that guy. I care too much. I care about what people think. I care more about what people think than what
There’s a hesitance in his voice, as though he’s suddenly unsure of that fact. As though he might have misunderstood something, and they’ve actually known each other for considerably longer. As though he doesn’t trust his own brain at the moment.
Mary is actually rendered speechless for a second. She doesn’t seem to be able to think of an acceptable response.
John looks back at him again. He seems to consider for a moment, then he smiles somewhat wistfully.
And John. It’s been a long time since John’s presence was as constant as Mrs. Hudson’s. Sherlock used to take it for granted, used to barely notice when John came clambering up the stairs after a long day at the clinic, Tesco shopping bags in both hands and his keys between his teeth. He pays more attention now. Hears every creak of protest as John makes his way up the staircase and relishes the sound of the key in the door. John still keeps his key. They seem to have reached a mutual, silent agreement on the matter and it fits Sherlock just fine. The prospect of coming home to find John there has kept Sherlock afloat on multiple crime scenes during the last six months. That despite his best attempts at reining in his own anticipation. One should avoid too much disappointment, and John’s spontaneous visits have grown fewer and farther between. Sherlock aches for one of those spontaneous visits now, aches into the very centre of his being.
. But somehow this is still just a little too close, a little too private, even for her.
It has to stop.
And Christ, he’s beautiful. Open and vulnerable without shying away, allowing John to see the broken man behind the razor-sharp mind. Allowing John to settle a debate he’s had with himself for what feels like an eternity once and for all: that Sherlock
In the end, Sherlock thinks, maybe it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not. Maybe what matters is that Sherlock feels cold to the bone and lonely as he never has before and if Moriarty is the only one offering even a hint of warmth and company then so be it.
“Alright,” he finally gets out. “Alright. I understand. And you’re right. We both want to make this work and I’m… I’m not helping. What I want to do, it would make everything worse. And I know why I want it, you don’t have to… you don’t have to say that.” He hesitates a moment, nodding to himself as if that would make his decision feel any less forced, any more legitimate. “You’re right. I’m coming home.”
But John was different. And he still is.
Mary is working a shift at the clinic today, but she’s sure to stop by when she’s off. And when she does, it’s highly likely that she’ll attempt to convince John to come home with her again. Not because of work. John has called in sick from work today and plans to do the same tomorrow. Either way, Mary would never be so inconsiderate as to expect John to go be a doctor somewhere else while Sherlock is in hospital. What Mary most likely
That’s all he would have needed to say. Would he be able to explain why he hadn’t?
John looks up at the ceiling next. He takes a deep breath, in through his mouth and out through his nose. Just like you’re supposed to do. He finds this difficult, Sherlock can tell, but he soldiers through. A doctor and a soldier, always both.
But John really doesn't know what else to say. He has no words, not until he's found out what he wants and how he feels.
In the end, the silence is not broken before Mary rings the doorbell half an hour later.
John looks from the monitor to the doctors and back to the monitor before he finally looks at Sherlock.
“Learn how to observe while relaxing.”
Maybe there’s a logical explanation. Maybe Sherlock is actually overdosing somewhere. Maybe he’s already dead. Maybe this is just the last few fumes that his drug addled brain manages to conjure up in the last tenth of a second before it shuts down once and for all. But then again, maybe it’s all real. Maybe Sherlock is actually trapped in here. Maybe the whole world has forgotten about him, shut him out, left him here to rot, locked him in. Has he deserved anything better? Maybe Moriarty really is here, really did survive. Does that seem so unlikely? Sherlock himself survived. Why shouldn’t Moriarty?
“He’ll never stop needing you is what I mean. He’s your best friend and you need him too, I understand that, but his dependence on you is not exactly healthy.”
It’s only a moment of terror, though, a knee-jerk reaction. Then John’s medical training kicks back in and allows him to kindly yet firmly insist that everyone pull a little back so that Sherlock can have some room.
John clears his throat.
“Filing.”
He would never lie to John just to keep him. It would be unthinkable, perverse, absurd and, incredibly, it doesn’t seem to be necessary. Why John seems to want him just the way he is when the rest of the world are all but tripping over one another to tell him off at every opportunity remains a mystery to Sherlock, but if John considers him worthy of his affection, so help him, he will not let John down. He will be here, for as long as John wants him to be, and he will do everything in his power to prove himself worthy of the trust John is placing in him. To fail in that… that’s what Sherlock will not allow no matter what. What there is nothing in this world he would not do to prevent.
As if to further underline the point, Jim immediately turns to him and asks “Where are we, Sherlock?” It's almost become a ritual during the past days. They both know it’s merely child’s play to deduce one’s whereabouts, especially in a city as familiar to the two of them as London, but it’s a part of the game they play that Jim always asks Sherlock to deduce where they are. Keeping his mind sharp and offering an opportunity for praise at the same time.
But she calls again one morning. And this time there are no accusations, no sarcastic tones, no harsh truths being spat in John’s face through the phone.
”You see the student over by that Starbuck’s?”
It’s worse than Sherlock thought. The atmosphere in here is thick with damp, the humidity so high that small puddles have started forming on the floor. Water is seeping out from underneath several of the doors. The lights flicker. Sherlock remains by the door, indecisive about where to start and unwilling to get his shoes wet. These doors are all but foreign to him. Upstairs, he can find anything of importance within a few seconds. Down here is storage, though nothing like his proper storage room upstairs. A new door is formed not by meticulous organisation and deposition, but by throwing things into boxes, securing them as best he can, closing the door upon them and locking everything in. Sherlock has a vague idea what periods of his life are covered by which doors, but the exact contents remain thankfully unknown to him. Under normal circumstances.
Sherlock gets up from the sofa and rushes across the room. John gets the feeling he’s not trying to put some distance between them though. He's just in need of movement and John can sympathise with that. His own skin is feeling uncomfortably restrictive.
“What are you doing?”
“Serbia was the last piece of the puzzle. It was supposed to be easy. I got a call from Mycroft saying that my name had been cleared in court just as I was landing at the airport in Niš, in disguise and under a pseudonym of course.” Sherlock hesitates for a moment. “I think I got a little carried away after that. Knowing that I could return to London as soon as the business in Serbia was cleared up… I got eager to get it over with and that made me careless.”
John has to hurt himself to restrain a frustrated growl when he has to pull back for air far too quickly.
It takes John hours to fall asleep.
“He’s just not fully human at times.”
Sherlock scoffs slightly, though it comes across as sorrowful rather than condescending. “Important…”
John smiles at him, though it comes across with far less confidence than he would have liked.
If Mary is his new cane then so be it. Maybe it’s for the best, really. He honestly doesn’t know whether Sherlock brought more joy or more pain into his life. If Mary can be his stable support, maybe that’s good enough. He can live with less joy and excitement and passion in his life if it means living with less pain too. An equilibrium between joy and pain with smaller values is preferable to the violent transition from the highest high to the lowest low that Sherlock put him through. Or so he tells himself. Just as he tells himself not to compare them.
Then the barest hint of a smirk crosses Moriarty’s face.
This is its own brand of torture.
It’s difficult to argue with your wife, your best friend and your own guilty consciousness at the same time. John sighs and nods.
“Yes, look at that! Oh, so lovely, isn’t it?”
Sherlock’s response time is longer than John’s nerves seem entirely comfortable with.
means two people and two people only, with no room for
“Alright, fine! We’ve had some disagreements during the last couple of days. I didn’t want to involve you. It had nothing to do with you. And as your doctor, I’m prescribing maximum rest. But yes, there have been some disagreements.”
. It’s been stressful, they’re both tired and they need to go to bed early so they can have some energy for tomorrow. This is not a good idea. Last minute decisions rarely are. But Sherlock has clearly noticed that John is preparing himself for something. He’ll probably be confused if John doesn't deliver. Maybe he’ll think something is amiss. Besides, it would feel like a complete cop-out if John was to back down now. It’s not even that significant of a thing he wants to say. He’s just being a coward.
A bit of a shorter update this time. It's difficult to get work done in these times of quarantine and working from home for weeks on end, but I try to keep the updates coming out fairly regularly. I hope you enjoy this newest chapter and, as always, a deep and heartfelt thank you for reading!
Sherlock cuts him off immediately, his face already turning from hurt and pouting to impassive. The warmth that was there a moment ago is gone too. Damn it. If only he wasn’t so good at this. Then John might be able to catch a break every once in a while and settle on just one interpretation, one understanding of who Sherlock is and how he actually feels. Whether or not he actually feels. That this is still a question in John’s mind from time to time… he hates himself sometimes.
“What were you doing?”
The first is a newly published re-assessment of all the evidence surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders. John had pointed out an advertisement for the book in a shop window a few weeks prior and Sherlock had seemed genuinely intrigued. Whenever the Ripper case is mentioned, Sherlock will always scoff and say that he could have solved the whole thing in an afternoon if only he had the necessary information. Perhaps the promise of new material has piqued his interest.
But when John says it, it sounds so wrong. It sounds as though he’s proclaiming himself a failure or a fake and Sherlock won’t stand for that. John is not a fake. He’s the sincerest, most genuine, most complex human being Sherlock has ever encountered. Just the simple fact that John continues to find new and exciting ways to surprise and baffle Sherlock, despite Sherlock feeling as though he’s known him forever, is a testament to that innate sincerity and complexity. John is honestly simple and honestly deep, wears his feelings on his sleeve and speaks his mind without a second’s hesitation and yet buries his innermost self so deeply that even
And so it’s Mary’s hand on his that keeps him grounded and mostly well-behaved, though Sherlock’s doctor couldn’t possibly fail to notice how tight John’s responding smile is. It’s Mary’s hand on his that keeps him from falling apart right here where everyone can see him, holding the pieces of him together if only through sheer force of will.
, but Sherlock is so damn cold to the core of his being and the warmth that may or may not be there in Moriarty’s eyes, smile, voice seems to be the only warmth left in the entire universe and he can’t help but want to hold on to that for just another second. He knows he shouldn’t. Sherlock would to God that Moriarty would just go away. And yet Sherlock also would to God that Moriarty would stay and never leave. That’s what it’s come to, is it?
“It wasn’t like that. It was…” His lip quivers and his words come spilling forth.
confessing a sin.
John blocks him with an arm. “Sherlock.” He waits patiently for Sherlock to meet his eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me any of this?”
“Well, it’s the end of an era, isn’t it? John and Mary. Domestic bliss…”
“I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.”
, it’s not the most forbidden thing that’s transpired between them tonight.
things. When he slides his hand across a sofa, he can feel the texture of the fabric under his fingers. When he enters the basement, he can feel the cold emanating from the walls. Just now, when he ran up the stairs, he’d felt the strain in his muscles.
But just because it’s Christmas and white out and they both have snowflakes in their hair.
“Daddy!” she exclaims gleefully, completely overriding the stiffness in John’s limbs and the slight discomfort of the icy cold meltwater dripping off her. John reaches down and lifts her up, placing her on his lap. His pants are immediately soaked. He can feel Sherlock’s eyes on them, affectionately amused.
It’s so quiet. Months and months of constant noise, months of months of begging for silence and now… now he finally has it. Months and months of noise and voices and whispers, filling up his brain, driving him to distraction, driving him to self-destruction. All replaced with a ringing silence in the span of a second. And he wants rid of it.
“I have to go soon or I’ll be late for Cath. Did you want that lift?” Mary gives his hand a slight squeeze, urging him towards the car almost unnoticeably. Perfectly understandable. Mary knows John well enough by now to understand that this is definitely a danger night. Just as John knows Mary well enough by now to understand that she is urging him towards accepting her offer of a lift to spare him the humiliation of having his possibly ensuing meltdown in public. Although they both pretend that Mary is ignorant of the sometimes quite violent things that John gets up to in the privacy of his own flat when he is alone, they both know that she understands perfectly well that “dropped” means “hurled” and that John leaving the clinic early doesn’t indicate a general rise in health levels.
and yet here he is and he’s most definitely kissing back and it’s
And feels his own heart rate soar.
Maybe John will reconsider if Sherlock tells him why he had to go away. Maybe John will reconsider if Sherlock tells him what he has spent these two years doing. That’s what he said, wasn’t it?
They’ve had arguments before, of course they have. All couples argue. Argue about the same stupid things again and again. For them, it’s always been John’s attachment to his previous life with Sherlock and Mary’s overreaction to the same. They’ve had this argument before. It’s just never been this… acidic. Or perhaps John is just feeling particularly sensitive tonight. Sherlock is sleeping less than ten feet away, recovering from an unexplainably prolonged unconsciousness that cost him a stay in hospital. Couldn’t Mary at least
“Hey. You alright? What happened? Sherlock, I need you to talk to me.”
The idea, slowly settling in John’s mind, that Sherlock might have felt like this all along, that Sherlock might have carried his loneliness alone for all this time and that John might have inadvertently exacerbated that loneliness by misinterpreting Sherlock’s lack of ability to express how he’s felt as a lack of ability to feel anything… if that’s true, how can John ever even begin to set it right?
John counts to ten, slowly and meticulously, and then lets his breath out through his nose.
doesn’t begin to cover his expression. He looks ecstatic. It’s a look Sherlock has known for several years, but it’s only now that he’s beginning to understand it. John, Mycroft and Lestrade may think what they like, it’s not an ecstasy brought about by mental instability. Not the kind of mad, unpredictable ecstasy one would expect from a consulting criminal who fixes other people’s crimes as a way to make a living. It’s much deeper than that. Sherlock has been a fool not to see it before. It’s the ecstasy Jim only gets when Sherlock and he are in agreeance. It’s the ecstasy of having searched for a compatible partner for a lifetime… and having found one. It’s an ecstasy that Sherlock is only able to understand now because it’s only now that he knows what that feels like.
Who comes a-knocking at six in the morning on a Saturday? Maybe it’s the dream still clinging on to him, but John can only really think of one person, and he clears the bed in record time, throwing on a housecoat on the way to the door and practically tearing the damn thing off its hinges in his haste.
John smiles and leans forward, then stops himself and sits back up abruptly. Whatever his brain’s intention might be in hijacking his body, a disturbingly common occurrence these days, John is not doing this and he refuses to examine
More days pass. Sherlock gets gradually better, in a physical sense. He begins to move with intent and purpose again, begins to go out in the kitchen to fetch his own tea when John is unavailable, begins to dress in actual clothes rather than lying across the couch in a dressing gown 14 hours a day before staggering back to bed. He takes a shower and even uses his preferred shampoo and shaving cream. He emerges fifteen minutes later, damp and warm and smelling like himself again, the stale and unpleasant scent of sterility from the hospital finally gone.
“Enough!” Mycroft’s voice is startlingly loud in the enclosed space.
Solitary confinement is not an analogy. It’s a reality.
Are you experimenting with entering your Mind Palace? Are you experimenting with altered states of consciousness? Fucking hell, Sherlock, you just came out of a fucking coma, are you out of your
Jim’s eyes search his. Sherlock has no doubt that he can read the reasons as clearly as the regret, shame and guilt.
Another cough and he’s spitting blood. The injuries to his stomach area must be more severe than he initially judged them to be. It doesn’t matter now. He knows a doctor in London. If only his head would stop creaking so.
Sherlock takes a moment to find his voice and formulate a reply, which only serves to increase John’s concern.
There’s a pregnant pause, filled only by a silent exchange of looks. John refuses to back down.
Sherlock interrupts him, though it’s done with a smile. A smile that is both grateful and regretful and not the least bit cheeky or condescending. “I’m sure Mary is waiting at home with something far better than anything you could scrape together from the meagre offerings in my kitchen.” How exactly he knows who the text is from and what information it contains is beyond John, but then so are a lot of Sherlock’s deductions.
The second is another children’s book actually, one that John had taken a look at during his first excursion to Waterstones, but then decided against because it had seemed a bit too mature for Rosie. He’d gone with a story about a donkey instead. But this one is about pirates and Sherlock bloody loves pirates, it’s his biggest childhood fantasy. Good thing John’s gotten this one as well now. He can make it a joint present for both Sherlock and Rosie. John smiles just thinking about Sherlock looking through it with her, the way Sherlock’s eyes will sparkle as they always do when he’s talking of something that interests him and the way Rosie will babble and giggle hysterically whenever Sherlock arrives at the conclusion of a story.
Only Sherlock doesn’t know how to. It’s a change that has been too gradual, too subconscious, too internal to be undone just by the flick of a switch somewhere. Sherlock was a fool for thinking that something as simple as opening a door somewhere in the vast expanse of his mind palace would be enough to undo years of internal rearrangement.
“Sherlock.
No, I have no words. No, don’t just lie there. No, don’t leave me here alone. No, don’t go where I can’t follow you.
“Sherlock!”
John sighs.
What’s more, Sherlock shouldn’t even want it in the first place. When Sherlock has always tried to keep himself distant from emotion, it has been for this exact reason. He’s always known what would happen if he allowed himself to grow close to someone. He’s always known that his heart would be the end of his head, that love is a dangerous disadvantage, that emotional reactions cannot be trusted. He’s always known that. And
“It means I’ll be back. First thing in the morning.”
“There’s all this… all these expectations. And I don’t mean society’s expectations. I know you don’t approve of those and I’m honestly inclined to agree with you on that point. Honestly,” he reiterates as Sherlock raises an eyebrow. John actually laughs at that. “I mean it. I just don’t live by it the same way you do. And don’t get me wrong, you’re a right prick about it most days and your verbal objections to ordinary people’s way of being ordinary at the most inopportune moments frankly makes everything ten times as difficult as it bloody well has to be. And that’s not even mentioning your behaviour at times. I don’t think the number of innocents you’ve actually managed to scar for life even bears thinking about.” He laughs again. “Do you remember that House Mistress at St. Aldate’s? I bet she’s still in need of therapy, that one.”
John takes a deep breath and starts over.
“Was that what you wanted to say?”
ordinary. But John still doesn’t like it. The silence unnerves him. It’s a bit too reminiscent of recent events.
It’s with that thought in mind that Sherlock finally gets up, his muscles sore from inertia, and finds a leftover needle in the bottom drawer beneath ten pairs of black socks. Then he goes to the kitchen to retrieve his hidden stash.
Jim is relentless. But his voice remains silky smooth.
“Stop thinking like that.”
That ought to be the long and short of it. From there, it should be easy. When has Mary ever disappointed him? When has Mary ever given John pause with her actions? Forced John to reconsider about
By the time Sherlock finally gets to the closing stanzas, the creaking in his head has increased to a persistent rapping loud enough to partially block out his own playing and he prays to whatever deity might be that he’s hitting the right notes because he honestly can’t tell anymore.
John gives her his most reassuring smile and wonders what it feels like to actually know what the fuck he’s going to do.
“Stammering really doesn’t become you, Sherlock. Take a moment to formulate your question and then put it to me. I might even answer if you do well.”
Sherlock smiles a little softly. He looks so innocently pure when he smiles like that, no edge of sarcastic or mirth.
Sherlock never made a conscious decision to follow John’s prompting and allow his emotions through. It just sort of happened. It had felt right at the time.
But now’s not the time to have that conversation, not when Sherlock is so obviously not in the mood for interruptions and anyway quite annoyed at John’s suggestion they invite Mary over. No matter. If Sherlock is not ready to see Mary yet, John will have to be the grown-up for the both of them and do what’s fair to her regardless of Sherlock’s (and his own) bad feelings.
burst forth.
“I don’t know about Mary,” he says, as true as can be. “I haven’t thought this through. I haven’t thought any of this through, Sherlock. I don’t know what I’m doing.”
But John isn’t here to save him now. Not this time. You can try to run from your demons. It might even work for a while. But they will catch up to you sooner or later, and there are no places to hide. The demons chasing him are everything and nothing. Memories, scraps of information, people in his life, even bits and pieces of his own self.
how relieving it is to feel just a tiny bit like himself again. To feel in control after months and months of struggling to balance all the pieces, much less manoeuvre them around the board. At long last, his head feels whole again.
“What did you think of it? Was it too slow? Boring? Traditional?”
“Sherlock.”
of him to leave. He can almost feel the heat and taste the dust.
Of course he would. If Sherlock was really here, he would have given some perfectly logical, rational explanation. And John would have hated him for it. Because that was never the point. John doesn’t care about logic or reason in this case. Rational arguments matter little to him. The point is that Sherlock went to his death on his own, alone, deserted, in disgrace and John wasn’t even allowed to be there with him until the end.
“Well… she had rather a lot to say, as it turns out. But basically…” John pauses, whether for dramatic effect or in a last-ditch attempt to avoid having to say whatever he has to say. Then he soldiers on.
John has to hurt himself to not release three years of unresolved tension and desire into a single kiss. Still it’s easily the most intense kiss he’s ever experienced. It’s the first time there’s been anything other than sheer relief in their kiss and the first time John is aware enough to register anything beyond the simple fact that their lips are touching. And it’s a strange sensation.
He doesn’t, of course.
“What more is there to say?”
“Sherlock?”
“I think so.”
John doesn’t bat an eye and it’s a starker relief than Sherlock had anticipated.
Still… he
But that’s in principle. In actuality, John’s unravelling at the seams as the hours and days pass in virtual silence. He doesn’t
To John’s surprise, it’s Sherlock who makes the opening move. He must have noticed how uncomfortable John is starting these conversations. John would be warmed by the gesture if he wasn’t so uncomfortable starting this conversation.
And it’s such a relief to be doing all of this again. Such a relief to feel certain that the deductions he makes are correct. Such a relief to actually have some confidence that he once again knows how to do this. Such a relief to finally begin to feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes again. It’s been far too long since he last knew what that felt like.
“But I can’t undo it now, John. I can’t.”
So when Rosie halfway out of Hyde Park asks to “see the birds” before they head home (which Sherlock knows to mean that she wants him to take her past the Serpentine so she can look at the swans), Sherlock finds himself in exactly the sort of doting parental Christmassy mood he’s always loathed in others and his response is not far off the mark either: “Oh, alright then” as he turns around to head back the way they came.
A strange ripple runs along Sherlock’s lower lip.
. It’s strange. Sherlock knows next to nothing about him. After the serial bombings several years ago, Sherlock did a thorough background check on Moriarty, dug up his birth certificate, his old school portraits, his various diplomas, every scrap of information he could find. But it’s a hollow kind of information. Sherlock still looks into his eyes and sees one mystery after the other. And yet whenever they’re in the same room, there’s an instant familiarity between them, a natural intimacy, an irrepressible attraction. Sherlock can imagine that John Watson thinks of them as two magnets with the same poles facing one another: certain key properties in common, yes, but fundamentally incompatible forces, forever repelling one another and keeping one another in check. That’s just not the truth. The truth is that they are the two poles of the magnet: part of the same piece, cut out of the same material, irrevocably tied to one another and attracted to one another with a force that’s entirely beyond Sherlock’s control. They don’t repel one another because it’s in their nature to do so. Sherlock repels Moriarty because he feels it’s the only way to avoid a collision of cosmic proportions. Because he feels like a planet being pulled towards a black hole the split-second before being torn apart and turned inside out.
Until it happened again. And again. And again.
In fact, he seems to consider Sherlock’s performance to be entirely unworthy of a reply.
“I tried to… I thought… There are parts of my brain that… deal with different things. Everything takes up brainpower. It’s like I’ve always said, I work by eliminating all distractions, that’s how I focus during a case. And I thought…”
John tries to swallow around the lump in his throat.
They don’t talk about it. Sherlock seems downright averse to serious conversations at the moment, preferring their casual banter of old. Despite this, it seems to John as though he’s actively pursuing their newly established moments. As though he’s either counting on John to somehow figure out what it is he’s trying to communicate or, just like John, struggling to figure out how to begin this conversation that they keep not having. Well, if Sherlock is waiting for John to figure out the meaning of it, he is in for a disappointment. John can barely figure out how to breathe properly while it happens, how could Sherlock possibly expect him to pick up on whatever that look is supposed to mean?
Which is in itself a proof of what he’s saying.
Funny, that. He’s not alone anymore. Things have changed. He has changed. He’s moving on. And yet here, now, with Mary’s hand in his, a definitive proof of his newfound lack of solitude, he feels no different from how he felt standing here last time, two years ago. It disappoints him in a way. Somehow he had hoped to stand here with Mary by his side and feel contented. Somehow he had hoped to stand here in front of Sherlock’s tombstone and feel free enough to finally let go, to finally be able to say
he needs to stop shooting because this is clearly way out of control!
Perhaps they both have things to be sorry for. Things to apologise for. Things to talk about.
it right. I left and had you think I’d died. And worst of all, I thought it wouldn’t really matter. I thought I could come back after two years and nothing would have changed. I thought… to tell you the truth, I thought you would be where I left you. I thought I could just move back in to 221B. I thought you’d still be there, and that everything could be as it was. I didn’t think it had mattered much to you, those two years. I hadn’t understood that you would hurt. Really hurt. I knew you would have to see me jump, I knew you would be shocked and pained and perhaps even feel betrayed, but I hadn’t understood that you would be hurt. That you would still hurt a month later. That you might still be affected by it two years down the line… the possibility never even crossed my mind. And I hadn’t thought about what you might do in my absence. The people you would meet, the places you would go. I thought I understood, but I didn’t. I was mistaken. And all of it because… It wasn’t because I didn’t care enough to think about what consequences it might have for you. But I didn’t think
And as they kiss, Sherlock renews his vow to always be there for John. To never let him go again, as long as he still wants Sherlock around. And to never allow his own insecurities to ever hurt John again.
Sherlock can feel his grip on the precipice loosen. Jim continues.
that temptation is, how stupidly dangerous it would be to attempt this, well then you really are unbearably, insufferably dense, brother mine!”
Come to think of it, John realises that he hasn’t seen much of him since the Fall and none of him at all since the wedding apart from their brief encounter when Sherlock was admitted to hospital a few days back, during which time John was practically insensate from emotional overstimulation. Not that Mycroft’s absence has left a hole in his life or anything of the sort – although John is generally less annoyed by the presence and conduct of Sherlock’s brother than Sherlock is, Mycroft and he are still far from friends. John isn’t about to forget Sherlock’s little revelation on the night of his return anytime soon: that Mycroft had not only known the truth all along and deliberately refused to share it with John despite witnessing his obvious grief only too clearly, but had actually helped Sherlock plan it all out, knowing what the end result was going to be from the very beginning. Adding insult to injury.
Sherlock does not look good. Mycroft has seen his brother in almost every state, from stone cold sober to high as a kite and from fiercely healthy to decidedly not. But this is different. It’s not the manic energy, erratic breathing and excited stare of the cocaine. It’s not the overpowering lethargy, deep sighs and drooping eyes of the heroin. It’s not the shaking, unstable mess of withdrawal. It’s not even the nervous, fidgeting excitement of too much caffeine after too many days with neither food nor water that Sherlock is given to subjecting his body to during particularly intense cases. His eyes do carry a hint of the maniacal over-excitement of cocaine and his mouth, currently curled into the beginnings of a smirk, has inklings of a euphoric sense of invincibility. But there’s an intelligence and determination to his eyes that exclude the possibility of any chemical drug.
