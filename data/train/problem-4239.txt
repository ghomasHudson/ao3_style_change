"Grab me a beer?" Dean asks when they've been lounging in the sun for a good twenty minutes.
"I still don't trust you," he tells her.
"Emma," Dean says, trying to calm her down. "Emma, listen to me-"
It's now a little after four, and Dean has been acting strangely. Not enough that anyone but Castiel seems to have noticed, but just a little to the side of how he might usually act.
"Is a criminal justice lawyer, not a family lawyer," Cas points out. "So is Eileen. No, I'll have to find someone with the appropriate experience. Thank you, though."
"Well? How do we break the curse?" Castiel snaps impatiently.
Sam nods, and Kevin mutters a “whatever” under his breath. They both leave the room, books tucked under their arms and drinks in hand. They clearly aren't anticipating coming back for a while.
Dean frowns. "It's not a problem, Cas. You know that. You'd do the same for me. Hell, the stuff you've done for me over the years, I'm barely holding my own in this whole thing."
"Whatever. We should let Garth know what's going on," Dean replies, dismissing himself from the situation. He can't be here anymore, in this room with Sam, listening as he gets left behind one reasonable sentence at a time. A moment's thought and he turns back around. "Why don't you stay? Handle this with Garth. Me an' Emma'll take care of Kevin. Not like you'll be there to help us after, anyway."
"I'm glad it's you, you know," Claire says. She flicks a glance up at him when he doesn't answer. "My new step-uncle-dad person. You're super lame, but I kinda like having you around."
The Amazons have their own language. A kind of bastardised version of Greek. It's familiar enough that Emma picks it up relatively quickly being immersed in it, and she wonders if between this and the Latin, modern Greek and Italian will be easy to learn. Her lessons, if you can really call them that, are more than half sparring sessions, but there's history thrown in as well, that of her people and where they came from. Greek mythology with the twist of coming from a people who lived through the real events. Some weapons theory. A fair bit of learning symbols and rituals, and a few lessons a week on raising young Amazons. Apparently they won't raise their own daughters, but becoming a 'teacher' is a good thing to aim for.
As Castiel contemplates, trying to put his finger on what the difference is precisely, Dean strolls back through with a tray of drinks, handing them out before taking his place at the table next to Castiel. As he hands Castiel his coffee, he passes behind him and drops a kiss to his hair. Castiel freezes.
Charlie doesn't have any contact with Jody. Probably doesn't know she exists, so Emma feels relatively safe meeting with her. She's also just as fun as Dad described, and just as dorky.
Sam heaves another heavy, uncomfortable sigh down the phone, stopping to clear out the cough it brings with it. "They said it'd end on its own when... when you were in a relationship for real."
If Charlie's bothered by Emma driving them accross state lines despite being legally fifteen, then she doesn't say anything about it. She spends the trip narrowing down their search to a small town that was hit hard by Katrina. It's doing a little better now, and Charlie finds them a motel called 'The Hoodoo' with what Emma's sure are culturally insensitively themed bedrooms and a breakfast menu for the attached diner. Tacky theme aside, it's a decent place. Clean. Well maintained. The food's good, too.
"Sorry," Sam says as he enters, "big drug dealing case, lots of tentacles. Kept getting caught in briefings. So what was it you want to talk about?" Sam folds his massive frame into the chair opposite Dean instead of behind his own desk. If Dean didn't know better, he'd say his brother looked nervous about something. Probably fair given the rarity of Dean asking to 'talk' about anything.
Creepy is right. Dean knows the kind of people Crowley works with and for, a lot of them seem to end up in Sam's case files at the District Attorny's office, and all he can say is he and Naomi deserve each other. Sam's tried and failed for years to get anything on the guy. He even mentioned once that he thinks Crowley's firm might have had something to do with the drug cartel that had Mom and her folks killed.
"Dean, that's in three days!"
One drink.
The first time she goes red eyed and sharp fingernailed, he nearly has a mental breakdown. What is he doing? Why did he think this was a good idea?
"I know he doesn't want me around. And that's why we left Benny, isn't it? 'Cause Uncle Sam wouldn't like it?" Emma continues. "And Cas. He's not human either and he doesn't stay."
Dean doesn't know how to respond to that, doesn't know what to say to make any of this okay. Eventually he lands on a firm, "we'll fix this. We're not gonna let her take them."
She folds her arms and looks away.
Emma shrugs. "They shouldn't do. With any luck they think hunters got me with the others."
"I'll go," Sam says. "You stay and keep an eye on him. Try not to leave him alone too much in case his behaviour changes. We don't want to be caught off guard if he goes Glenn Close on you."
Eventually it stops smelling like Cas, or Jimmy or whatever, and that stings just as much as recognising the smell had in the first place. But it still feels like it brings a little bit of him back whenever he catches himself in a reflection, trenchcoat filled out and alive around him instead of passive and neglected in the car. It doesn't fit quite right, and it's not as warm as some of his own jackets, but it feels comfortable in a way even his dad's old jacket never did.
"He didn't know," Dad tells him. "Not for most of it, anyway. And he couldn't tell you when I did let on."
"Was to break the curse, I get it," Dean finishes for him, already shrugging back into his usual persona.
Castiel forces himself to lean away. "It isn't. You're acting this way because-"
Emma rolls her eyes but her pleased smile lights up her face even with the teenaged sass.
"Alright," Dean says, sitting down next to her and praying to God those sideways glances people are giving him aren't them thinking he's hitting on his own daughter. He feels all kinds of out of place here as it is, without worrying about that whole mess. "What do we know?"
"Are we okay? It's not generally a great sign when someone freaks out and runs away after you tell them how you fell for 'em," Dean says, trying to inject that humorous tone once more but failing miserably.
Emma coughs and sputters, but drags herself into a better position, pulling Rachel down and rolling her. She can't hold her. Rachel is better trained, more brutal, probably a little stronger even. Emma's going to be covered in bruises by the end of this session, and there'll be another one straight after lunch. The schedule of classes makes her long for a math class or a poetry assignment. But it's efficient.
Sam's face does something funny.
The pieces click together. "You were undercover. Sam's drug case. It was the guys who killed Mom."
Dean's stricken expression tells him all he needs to know.
Mrs. Tran looks unimpressed.
"Kiddo, I promise you, I ain't leavin' you behind, okay?" Dean tells her. "I don't like this any more'n you do."
"Sam, stop," Dean says at last. Either he believes Emma and she's good, or he doesn't and she's a killer. A monster. And he knows what he has to do to monsters. He can't do that to his daughter.
"Price has just gone up," Crowley cuts her off. "I want the prophet. You give me him, nicely gift wrapped and delivered, and I'll show you how to get to Purgatory."
"Okay," Cas says eventually.
"Emma," Dean repeats softly.
He frowns. "Uh. No. Thanks."
Sam is quiet for a moment. "Has he remembered anything else? Filled in the blanks we asked about before?"
Dean meets his eye with all the conviction he feels in every fibre of his being. "Yes she is."
To say Emma doesn't consider it, just for a moment, would be a lie.
"I love you," Dean says.
"Dad rented a rowing boat," Claire joins in.
"Emma, how about you go pick out some dessert for the road?" Dean suggests. They've got a way to go to the motel Dean told Sam about and he wouldn't mind a sugar rush to get him through the trip.
Dean lets him absorb it all for a moment. Sam's big girly feelings have probably taken offense to the idea of a sham wedding.
She turns and leaves, at last, and Dean drops back down into his seat. Claire pats him on the shoulder and turns to take Jack from his bouncer. He's surprisingly not cried through this whole thing, but it's pretty close. Dean feels bad for the kid. Poor little guy doesn't even know what all the yelling was about.
And Emma's sure he's full of shit. "I know where he is."
"It's really that easy for you, huh? Tie up some loose ends and bail," Dean says. "Leave it all behind you like there ain't people dyin' out here."
"What?" Dean scoffs. "You've looked after these kids pretty much since Jack was born. You have a job, the house is in Claire's name anyway, you're healthy..."
The next time isn't so incidental. He and Sam had a yelling match again, and Dean doesn't even remember what it was over. They do that a lot these days, and it's a safe bet that Sam got sick of the dark cloud hanging around Dean and tried to make him talk about it or stop drinking so much or out and out told him to stop wallowing. So Dean's on his own heading to interview witnesses for the case they're on while Sam's headed over to the morgue, choosing to deal with the corpses alone over dealing with Dean.
"Why did it let me in?" Emma finishes for her. She's been thinking about that a lot on the trip over. Not only is she not one of the Men of Letters, but she's not even human. Presumably the last person they'd want in their secret place was a supernatural creature.
"You lost him?!"
His phone chimes and Dean checks it as they climb back into the Impala. Charlie, the chick they met at Dick's offices has sent a message to confirm she's sent hardcopy forgeries of Emma's birth certificate and other documents to the address they agreed on. They've only known her a few days and she's already proven a useful contact, even beyond the hard drive. Now that the papers are sorted out, Dean has a decision to make. And it's one he's none too keen on making.
"You're not stuck inside, are you?" Emma asks.
"Okay. I for one am starving," Dean says. "Let's go find some burgers." He grimaces. "No triple meat."
Whatever it is, it's clear that she doesn't want it seen. The wristband is probably less a stylistic choice and more a camouflage.
"Dad?" Sam says from behind Dean's shoulder, and that, more than anything makes this real.
"That would be incestuous," Castiel comments calmly, sipping some of the cream from the top of his drink before the melting weight of it can displace the liquid and make it run down the side.
Cas' hand tightens around his fingers as he sways closer.
"That's it?" Dean presses. "You just... spent the whole year trawling for info on Purgatory?"
"Probably to get the extra energy for your strength," Sam nods.
After everything. After ugly blue sweaters and hospital clothes and coverings of bees and Purgatory grime and... everything, Cas showers and puts on a suit jacket and a blue tie and the trenchcoat over the top, and Dean nearly chokes on his tongue at how gorgeous he looks. How he looks like Cas again.
"You mean my monster face?" Emma asks skeptically. "You sure you won't reach for a gun the second I show you?"
"Emma-"
"Say something," Dean insists. They haven't spoken more than two words to each other since Sam met Benny and it's driving him nuts. He'd hoped after the good werewolf girl Sam would be more mellow, but he went straight for the silent treatment. He's already made it clear that he's gone once they find Kevin again and he spends so much time on his goddamn phone he may as well have already left.
"You and me? For real?" Dean adds as though the first sentence hadn't already caused the static of uncapturable words to start up in Castiel's head again.
Jody shoves a plate onto the table in front of Emma and sits down accross from her with an expectant expression.
Dean doesn't seem overly impressed, but he shrugs it off as worth a look and turns back to Cas. "You wanna go watch a movie before bed?"
Emma stares at the empty summoning circle and clenches her fists. They were so close.
"You summoned the King of Hell? What were you thinking!" Dad rages.
Dean's lips thin, unable to think of anything to say to that. He turns up the radio.
"Nothing." He fixes his gaze on her talons. "I just thought Dean was ignoring it. Pretending you were normal."
"Shut up. I told you to stay out of it, but if you're in this then you're gonna play it by my rules, okay? I'm not havin' you run in there spooking them, or drawing Crowley right to 'em," Dean says. "You set up shop and you wait for me. We go in together. Got it?"
He changes her again, takes a photo of her in her new car seat and goes through his mental list of motels in the area.
"I actually enjoyed the cuddles," Castiel says on a tentative grin.
"How much do you remember?" Castiel asks, resigned.
Sam's eyes skip away guiltily, and Dean isn't sure what the guilt is over, but he'll take the end result. "I'll be there. What time?"
He trails off as the room goes quiet, guests finally catching on and Jack finally calming with the lack of shouting.
Sam ignores the sarcasm. "Where's Cas?"
"Doing what? What's been 'altered'?" Dean asks, then looks at Castiel and smiles warmly. "Hey, Cas."
"Of course you like the chocolate, it's chocolate," Dean replies, mouth full of raspberry sponge. The bakery is nothing fancy, they can't afford a proper wedding place, but they have a basic range and they're willing to make it big and fancy enough to count.
Charlie shrugs. "Stranger things have happened."
"Cas," Dean says softly.
But the having no friends problem is still there, and she's legally only fifteen so anyplace with age restrictions is a no go. Maybe the movies? Or there might be an arcade or something nearby? Her only examples come from watching TV and overhearing her classmates talk.
John raises his eyebrows at the assembled crowd. "Apparently crashing a wedding."
Emma takes a sip of her drink and mulls it over some more. There's little chance she'll find an answer she didn't find in the hours of driving, but it seems the thing to do.
"Sam!"
He's in the car and pulling off before Sam can finish packing his bag. Not that there's any way to know if Sam did or not. He could just as easily have let Dean go without a fight.
"Then what was it like?" Dean asks. "'Cause I must be missing somethin' here."
Which is what makes it very awkward when she comes running at them through the trees shouting 'Dad' at the top of her lungs.
"If we really gotta have flowers, I'll ask around. Maybe someone with a greenhouse will be willing to donate to the cause," Dean says to break the moment and give him an excuse to drag his eyes away from Cas' soft smile and back to the budget sheet. "What else we got on the list?"
With that he vanishes into his room, leaving him alone with an unnaturally affectionate Dean who is determined to show him a movie about a machine that plays tic-tac-toe despite the fact the whole thing will be spoiled for him by Metatron's implanted knowledge the moment the title appears.
That evening in the bunker, Dean passes Castiel his cocoa and drops a kiss on his hair. "You know, maybe you shouldn't be drinking all that sugar every night. S'not good for you."
"You what?" Dean snaps in reply.
"Of course not! Of course it's not easy! But people are always dying. Your words," Sam says bitchily. "And honestly? We've done enough! I went to hell, Dean. For centuries. I've died more times than I can keep track off. I've lost everyone I ever cared about, you included several times over, and I'm done. I can't do it anymore. I won't."
Instead of making the most of the quiet time, he drags himself out of bed, or off couch as the case may be, and starts putting his shit away. They're having the ceremony in the house, along with brunch before heading off to the Roadhouse for the party. Reception. Whatever. There's no chance he's leaving anything potentially incriminating around where Naomi and Crowley could sniff it out.
That thought in mind, he sets about cleaning the kitchen and lounge top to bottom and checking all the babyproofing is intact and in place. He's halfway through pulling the couch out to hoover under it when Cas makes his rumpled appearance.
Dean throws his hands out. "And then we do it anyway!"
"'M fine," Dean lies. He tugs at her hair, shorter than he remembers and coloured with a fast-fading purple streak that's no doubt Charlie's doing. "Finally saw a hairdresser, huh?"
Emma flinches, then slowly complies. She doesn't pull away when Dean grabs for her wrist and looks at the scar there. The Amazon brand. She licks her lips. "It's not what you think."
It was easier when he hadn't known, and he could imagine that the only things he'd get from a romantic relationship with Dean that he didn't already have in his platonic one were sexual. He could tell himself it was nothing he couldn't live without, because as wonderful as he assumes sex can feel, as fun and passionate as heated kissing is, they'd only be an add on to what he already has with Dean. But now that he knows how easy and warm Dean could be with him were they really together he doesn't know how he can survive the want.
"Right," Sam says doubtfully. "It's just... you've never really done the PDA thing. With Cas."
Sam's eyes dart between them like he's watching an invisible fencing match, waiting to see who takes a hit, who backs down.
"We're not doing fancy clothes, we're gonna try to bum the flowers, Benny's on brunch, Charlie's on photography and invitations, we already paid for the license..."
That evening they do their research over pizza and Charlie's boxset of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's actually kinda nice.
"Well, he's alive," which as far as Emma's concerned is doing pretty good. After all, her circle of family and friends contained pretty much five people and two of them died, even if she did kill one of them herself and resurrect the other one. "I'll have to double check he's still where he was last time I looked, he moves around a lot."
Dean shakes his head automatically.
Claire throws herself down on the stool next to him, shoulder jarring him out of his maudlin thoughts. She's grinning ear to ear, loose and easy from placebo alcohol, and panting from her dance battle with Jo, who's currently lying collapsed on the floor and yelling about being hot and thirsty.
Emma reaches for a sugar dusted doughnut and Dean winces as she smears the white powder all over the steering wheel, doughnut gripped precariously between thumb and forefinger while her other fingers steer. The sugar gets everywhere, specking her wristband and falling onto her jeans and- Dean's gaze gets caught on the raised section of scarring peeking out from beneath her wristband.
"He's not freaking adopting you, so just uncle," Dean says.
"You are overreacting," Naomi scolds, cutting Cas off. "We all want what's best for the children."
He can't make any promises there. Kevin's a prophet, the only one left as far as Dean's aware, and who knows what crap is heading their way. But he can promise this: "We get you settled in, then were gone."
Dean breathes and forces his eyes up to his reflection in the grimy bathroom mirror. The tan around his shoulders settles him enough to stand straight. One drink and then he'll get the hell out of here and back on to helping Sam. Trying to help Sam. Failing to help Sam.
Or he would. If they were actually his kids to worry about.
"And that, that was our first kiss, Cas. It happened," Dean continues. "And if you don't feel the same way then there's not a shit ton I can do about it, but it happened and it was real!"
"No..." Crowley says after fifteen minutes of negotiation, narrowing his eyes as he looks her over. It doesn't sound like a rejection of terms, though. "Hang on. You're not... You're not a
"Emma'll vacate," Dean adds, ignoring Emma's injured look. "You'll have the place all to yourselves."
Dean nods, still a little hungover and a lot stunned. He really should have ignored Jo's taunting about being Cas's wife and gone home when the room started spinning. The thought occurs to him that Cas's wife is exactly what he just signed up to be. He laughs a little hysterically. "Damn, Cas. That was the least romantic proposal I ever heard."
Cas seems unsure, as if he's waiting for Dean to laugh or yell or something.
There's a moment where he mourns for the could-have-beens, not for the strippers or the other decorations on the fantasy, but for the bachelor party another Dean might have had, where he gets to wake up in the morning and marry someone who loves him the way he always thought married couples should.
Dean hesitates, glancing at Emma, whose eyes have finally lifted from the page in front of her.
Dean glances at Sam then back at the road for the fifth time in a minute.
She leaves a note. She doesn't want Jody thinking something happened to her again, but she knows Jody would stop her if she tried to say goodbye in person.
They're attacked a few more times along the way. Cas's angelic presence and their now even larger party attracting plenty of attention. Emma fights with them each time. Dean doesn't want to know just as much as he needs to know how she learned to fight like that.
"Right."
Jody doesn't say Dad's dead. Doesn't say he's not coming back. That's good, because Emma might have to do something a regular girl couldn't and wouldn't do if she were to suggest that. Dad promised he'd be back, and he will be. Even if Emma has to drag him back herself. Even if she doesn't know where he is. She'll find out, and she'll get him back, and she'll leave this shitty town and it's shitty school with its shitty kids.
"'Night sweetheart," Dean says and goes to brush his own teeth. When he's done, he pauses to stroke her hair before climbing into his own bed. The bottle of booze stays in his bag.
"No, seriously. I don't even get flowers? You don't go down on one knee?" Dean jibes, grounding himself in the humour of it.
Dean's practically moved into Jimmy and Amelia's house by now, the same way Cas did over a year ago to look after Amelia and the kids. He does laundry and dishes and cooks food nobody's in the mood to eat, and crashes on the sofa to stay nearby. And it's fine, it's not a problem. Cas is his best friend, and he's done way more for Dean over the years than a little light housework. But it does make Cas' absence at work all the more palpable.
“What does Dean’s say?”
The car speeds on anyway. It speeds all the way past the border of Idaho and right into Oregon. Just passing the border and seeing the all too familiar ‘Welcome to Oregon’ sign feels like a punch in the gut and it takes everything in Dean not to just turn around then.
It got better the more hunts they took, Sam was slowly becoming more himself again. The arm guard stayed on though.
They had nowhere to go, but it didn’t matter. He just had to drive.
He knows he should definitely turn around now. It’s stupid to even think of going back. Chances of anything actually waiting for him there is ridiculous and so far from anything realistic. It’s been two years after all. Twenty five months if he was going to be exact.
Dad freezes. Clearly he heard it too. The guilt.
If Castiel didn't know better, he'd wonder if he'd imagined the whole conversation. "Your memories. Or your mind, at least."
"You were here because you had nowhere else to be," Naomi says, finally raising her voice to the same level as the others, and Jack finally starts to realise something is wrong beyond the normal yelling of his sister.
"Seeing you like..." He shakes his head. "You still look like you."
Another photoshoot. Another meal. Another home schooling session. And round and round it goes until Dean's ready to pass out from sheer exhaustion. He worries a little about the lack of other kids and family members in the photos. About the lack of parks and holidays and Christmas parties. But it's the best he can do and it's not like his little photo album in the making is ever likely to be put under that much scrutiny. He does wonder if the lack of those things will be a problem for her. With her tribe she'd probably be doing this with other freakily fast growing kids. As it is, the entirety of her formative 'years' are spent with just him for company.
Sam glares at her and Dean fights the urge to move inbetween them. "You know I never wanted this life, Dean. And with you gone... there was nothing to keep me in it."
Dean laughs and goes willingly. Cas is a terrible dancer, but his drunken grins, and the sight of Sam trying to force his gangly limbs to follow Claire's instructions have Dean forgetting he'd even imagined this night in his life being any other way.
"Dean-"
Sometimes he takes it out and doesn't wear it, instead draping it over a chairback as if Cas left it there himself and will be back any minute to reclaim it. It's pathetic, but that doesn't stop him. He is pathetic these days, there's no point in denying it.
"He's a big boy, I'm sure he can take care of himself," Dean says, though honestly he wonders the same thing. Cas isn't exactly in peak condition to be fighting off the armies of Heaven if things go south.
"Oh?" Dean asks. He feels like his chest is splitting in two. It's hard to take a breath. If she's initiated, if she's killing people-
Jack drops his teether off his high chair tray and starts fussing, breaking the stare off. Dean reaches down to grab it, dropping it onto the counter to sterilise later then turning his attention to getting Jack interested in a different toy. Honestly, he's an easy baby. Dean still remembers times when he and a baby Sam were between babysitters and his brat brother would fuss non-stop for hours for seemingly no reason while Dean tried to entertain him.
Dean shrugs. They're all pretty good but to be honest he's always been more of a pie man. "What do you think Cas would like?"
Emma takes a steadying breath, bracing against the rejection. He's just trying to protect her. That's all it is. It's not him leaving her behind again now he's got Sam back. "Okay."
Dean looks over her shoulder as he bounces Jack on his hip. The picture would be sickeningly romantic, Dean and Cas kissing, the bliss of it writ large on both their faces, fingers tangled together between them.
Cas gazes at him fondly and for a second Dean wonders what it'd be like if they were planning this thing for real. Getting married, moving in together, raising Claire and Jack together. It wouldn't be so bad, he thinks. Cas would make an amazing husband.
Dean rolls his eyes. "Sure. We'll talk. Now will you lighten the hell up? I'm getting married tomorrow, not buried."
"Dean," Castiel cuts him off. "You don't kiss me. We've never... I think someone may have interferred with your memory."
"He's making up memories now," Castiel tells him, impatient to get past Sam's questions. "He just described to me how and when he fell in love with me. He named a date, Sam. He couldn't remember any specifics before. The spell must be progressing."
"What do you think it is?" Emma asks.
Dean meets his eyes, hope and despair mingled behind his shut down expression. "Then what? You need space? We're on a break? What do you want from me, Cas?"
They get out. Him and Benny. Not Cas.
Sam folds his arms. "Why'd you leave?"
The diner doesn't even look that run down in comparison to everything around it. A little scuffed and worn, but like the owner could swing by at any time and open it back up again. Like it's just waiting.
"Cas?" Dean asks with a hint of exasperation.
them.
"Sure. There's still loads to go through here anyway," Emma lies.
"No." Dean and Emma reply simultaneously.
He wakes up to a sharp rap on the door, and a call of 'breakfast'.
"I guess," Sam repeats, brow furrowing as if his nerdy lawyer brain has been insulted by Emma succeeding where he's failed. "She with him now?"
His instant thought being that he has to pick Claire up from a sleepover tomorrow morning is probably not a good argument in his favour.
Living with Sheriff Mills isn't too terrible. She's cool, if a bit stricter than Dad ever was. She doesn't try to get Emma to call her 'mom' and she swears a lot more than even Dad did. She insists homework gets done before any extracurricular reading Emma wants to do, and Emma's curfew is strictly enforced.
He barely hears Cas' vows, too busy taking in the neat lines of the shirt Dean ironed for him the day before, the tie Dean helped him straighten as the guests started to arrive. He can faintly smell the laundry powder they've been sharing for the past few months, and he can hear Jack fussing just a little in the background, unused to all those people, and he can see the colour of Claire's dress, the one she wore in spite of his mostly teasing rant about how it's more appropriate for a club than a wedding like some crotchety old dad cliche.
Emma looks over at him at last. "You missed my birthday."
"I don' gerrih," Emma garbles through cheese.
"Emma, it won't-"
It's Cas. Alive and whole, freaking unscathed apart from his apparent amnesia. Living with some chick who found him naked by the lake (where Dean would have found him if he'd just stayed longer. If he'd just looked) and convinced him to marry her. She seems nice enough, kind enough. Dean hates her more than he hates the house. More than he hates the ugly blue sweater she's dressed Cas in.
Cas remains staring through to the front door until they hear Naomi's car start, then he slumps and turns to Dean. "I apologise. But this buys us some time, at least, while Naomi rethinks how to present her case. I... I'll figure something out."
"Sam?"
Dean nods. "Okay. We'll apply for a license tomorrow, find a priest or whatever, set a date. And like we bullshitted to Naomi, it's not like we need to plan this huge princess wedding or whatever."
"We're getting married on Saturday," Dean says. There isn't much else to say.
There isn't really time or resources available for bachelor parties, but Ellen insists they come down on the Friday night for a few drinks and well wishes, and Kelly happily takes Jack for the night seeing as the plan was for her to take him while they set up in the morning anyway. Dean really wishes they'd been warned about Ash's quazi-strip routine so they'd thought to palm Claire off on someone, too, rather than be half deafened by her well and truly justified shriek of horror when Ash got up on the pool table to the opening strains of 'I'm Too Sexy'.
Mrs. Tran sighs. "Fine. But I don't want you anywhere near my son after that."
Four hours later and he's pulling at the cuffs of his shirt as everyone takes their seats, or in the less fortunate cases, their places along the back wall. It still feels so surreal.
Emma smiles a little both at Charlie's enthusiasm and her dorkiness.
"But?"
Emma nods. She thinks about Jody coming home after her shift to find her gone. Then she thinks of the kinds of things she'll need to know how to do to get her Dad back. "Teach me."
That gets her a smile. "Kiddo, I promise I've seen worse, whatever it is."
Sam's eyes snap up from the license. "Real? What the hell's going on, Dean?"
"Does she not live with you?" Kevin asks. "Why doesn't she live with you? Does her mom have custody?"
Then he eats and encourages Emma's scarily fast grip of the English language. Hell, he even throws in some Latin just to see how she handles it. After that, he gets out the educational activity books he bought and goes through her shapes and numbers and letters with her. By they time they've finished she seems to be around four and she's already writing him sweet little nonsense notes he carefully tucks away with her favourite baby toys. He only has Sammy to go on, and that kid was a certifiable genius anyway, but he's pretty sure she's ahead of even her physical development. He's not sure whether to be proud or freaked. He only needs to show her something a maximum of three times before she masters it.
He puts his own burger back down. “Do you want me to leave?”
As everything he has done the past few days it was stupid and so full of hope that it took more will power then he would like to admit not to break down right there in his damn car, in fucking Oregon. He’s so pathetic.
So, even as words apparently decided to run away from him, Dean meets Castiel’s eyes head on and hands him the envelop because that right there is proof. He has a job. He has his favorite grocery store, and friends at work, and his chair at their tiny dining room table, in their tiny apartment that they should really move out of and into somewhere bigger. And he’s making roots and he’s staying. He chose to stay.
He has nowhere to go but back; and yet he is not turning the car over like he should have done before he crossed the state line in the first place.
“The lease is up in April.”
Coward.
Last time Dean checked the time it was 10am, but he has been parked there for a while now, so it’s probably later then that now. Traffic has definitely picked while he sat there like a coward that he is.
Dean just stood still, kept the eye contact with Sammy and, as subtly as he could, shook his head, not daring to talk in fear that it will get Cas’s attention off of him and onto them again. He really didn’t feel like losing any family members today.
It changed with a letter and a packed suitcase.
Getting a job was easy. After all it wasn’t the first time that he had to fake some documents. Though they were with his actual name this time since this was probably going to be long-term thing if he can help it.
He takes the guard off slowly before his brain even got the memo, really hoping he is not going to regret this one of this days as he clutches the thing in one hand and let's Cas still hold onto the other as the angels eyes fall on the flesh exposed to someone else for the first time in a long time.
Still refusing to meet anyone's eyes said man got up. “I’ll go get another beer. Anyone else?”
The man, the thing, is staring at Dean as he stops walking and finally speaks; the words making his blood run cold. “I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.” His voice is deep, like he has been gurgling nails as a hobby, but all Dean wants to do is scream as the words echo in his head in a way that is making him dizzy. The itch under his skin only gets worse.
The demon’s are scared of whatever it is and Dean is done playing around. He needs answers even if it means coming face to face with the thing he has feared since he was a child. It can’t be worse then the pit. Nothing can. At least that’s what he told himself over and over as he and Bobby drew any and every kind of summoning rune in the warehouse.
Classy.
Dean takes another big gulp of gin as the words echo in his head in that baritone voice, feeling like a slap in the face. Dick.
One of the first things that dad taught Dean after his mom’s death was how to fire a rifle.
“Dean?”
Thinking that Bobby will just accept the fact that Dean was in the land of the living again without a hitch was something that, he learned quite fast, wasn’t true.
It’s in South Dakota that he finally lets himself stop at a motel for the night. He doesn’t take the phone out of the glove department to charge. There’s no point. He can deal with his anger face to face when he’s ready to.
He did that. Of course he did.
As Cas scraped his teeth against that one spot under his ear Dean had a real hard time caring about that right now though.
In front of him the other man sighed, seemingly deflating himself. “Dean, I can’t do this anymore. I’m not a teen anymore.” The words were expected, but felt like a slap in the face anyway. It got Dean looking up again and seeing pain fill the eyes he never wanted to see pain in.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean felt relief wash over him so quickly he almost crumbled to the ground. As it was, the only thing keeping him up was a still growling wolf that he was half draped on. If only he could say that this was the first time they ended up like this.
Sam was the one binge drinking this time. He was the one that got an arm guard in the first town they hit. Dean just stood by and stayed quiet.
He knows what he should be doing now. Continue driving, find a motel, charge his phone, call dad and go back. He should just go back.
“Something with a big kitchen and a memory foam mattress”
When has he not though?
The hand on his shoulder let go, but instead of the expected sound of wings followed by silence, there was rustling and a thump as something hit the floor. Of course Dean was just stupid enough to turn around.
He left, and once more, Castiel was alone.
“Yeah, I couldn't agree more, but what other choice do we have?”
“Please.” Cas repeated the word and Dean was so far gone in this, nothing could save him from pain anymore no matter how much he was kicking and screaming.
He could still remember it all as if it was yesterday; but there was a frown on the other man’s face now that reminded him of just how much he doesn’t deserve to have any of it.
Turning his eyes back to the road Dean held onto the wheel tighter, pushing the gas paddle just a tad more, with the inability to do anything else.
At the words ‘pass out’ there was a whine in answer, but Dean ignored it. The adrenaline was definitely leaving him now, and they can talk later about his choices of words. Preferably when they can both actually talk.
“Nice to see you too, Cas.” Dean spoke as the lips moved from his lips to his neck, sounding breathless and not caring one bit. There are more pressing matters to attend to, like figuring out why it’s a bad idea to fuck against the wall he was being pressed against.
Swallowing twice to make sure he doesn’t actually throw up, and not moving his eyes from it, Dean stands back up. “Who are you?”
It definitely wasn’t blinking. “Castiel.”
He still tried to save himself. “You’ll leave again.”
He remembers her words always being kind, expression happy as she tucked him to bed and made up ridiculous stories of what would be the words showing up on his own arm when he gets older. She made him look forward to it. To having what his parents have; as he watched them talk softly in front of the TV some nights long after his bedtime. They loved each other, even at three years old it was an obvious truth.
Dean is still standing there long after the angel is gone. The angel who is supposed to be a dick, but also his soulmate who he never wanted in the first place.
Life moved on;  John died; and life moved on again.
He let his own eyes flash as the words hit. The blue may not be as effective as the red, but this was his pack so it had the desired effect. Everyone backed up to let them pass. No one looked particularly happy about it, but they moved all the same. Good.
The perfect moment seems to be as Dean has a burger halfway to his mouth, since that is when Cas finally asks the questions Dean wanted to answer, but was too chicken shit to bring up.
The smell had him scrunching his nose in disgust and looking up at the man, ready to argue about whatever leaf water was being offered, but stopping short because he was there and he should just shut up before he’s kicked to the curb like he deserves.
What kind of a word was perdition anyway?
The sun was bright and it took a few minutes of Dean just lying there on the ground to be able to actually see anything other then just white.
“Come on man. It’s safe. We’re safe. They won’t hurt us.” Standing back upright was a feat in and of itself, but the words fell on deaf ears. Dean let go of his death grip in order to push his fingers through the hairs on the back of the beast’s neck instead. Because that’s all that Cas was right now, he was a beast. An animal led by instinct and rage.
As the boy grew up he watched his family change; the nannies and butlers walking out the door and never coming back, only for new ones to appear the next day.
But damn everything to hell, it is a huge ass fucking deal and he needs to drink until he passes out right here, right now.
He stopped crying by the time he was thirteen. There was no point in crying. He always knew he would die anyway. So he stopped crying and started training harder, because he is Dean Winchester dammit. He is not going down without one hell of a fight.
It wasn’t enough.
Watching Sam break as he did in that moment was not very high on Dean’s list of things he wanted when the day started. It reminded him of the way their dad looked so often through his life. Brought back the guilt and the pain and made it tenfold. Too late now though.
That doesn't sound good. Emma mutes the TV and tries to be casual about turning her full attention to him.
Charlie sets off the next day and Emma spends the whole morning moping. She doesn't like being alone. Maybe that's a little hypocritical seeing as she's more often the one leaving than being left, but it still feels like she's tetherless. Like no one really wants her enough to ask her to stay and to stay with her in return. She knows that's dramatic and what Jody would probably call her teenage angst while rolling her eyes. Doesn't make it feel any less true, though.
Dean shoots to his feet and stumbles backwards. "I'm sorry, I'm so freaking sorry! God, I..."
This time the others notice.
Displaying all of the tact of a Winchester, Emma spends the trip to the mental hospital asking personal questions. She knows from Dean who Cas is, but she seems more hung up on his new fake life.
"Maybe I should go first," Emma argues mildly. "I'm not the one they've been running away from."
"This is definitely the one you should print out and hang on the wall," Claire says, pausing her swiping through the wedding album on her phone.
It's a weird thought. He's been so deep in it for so long that he hadn't stopped to think about his own relationship with Amelia. He'd met her, of course, plenty of times, but they'd never really talked until she got sick. Even then it was all practical stuff, her treating him as part and parcel with Cas and him acting accordingly. When he thinks about who she was, all he can think about is how a part of her seemed almost glad to go. Like she was looking forward to seeing Jimmy again. It's unfair, and he thinks she must've fought it, must have tried to stay with her kids, but he saw that same kind of look in John's eye growing up and since he made that connection the comparisons just come whether he wants them to or not. Amelia may have not gone looking for her death the way John did, disappearing on dangerous, semi-legal cases for weeks at a time until one day he just didn't come back, but both of them were one foot in the grave the moment their spouse kicked the bucket.
Castiel kisses the back of Dean's hand. "I know."
Emma looks between them both. "Where would we take them?"
Sam nods and looks away. "How was it?"
That doesn't sting much either. His dislike lost its power a while ago.
They summon Crowley on March 3rd. Emma finds the timing kinda funny.
Dean looks over the marriage license he picked up an hour ago as he waits for Sam to show. He's still not sure how much good being married to him will do Cas. Yes, he'll have a 'two parent' situation for the kids and an extra income, at least on paper, but being gay married to a guy with a GED and a give 'em hell attitude might not be a particularly effective challenge to psychiactric doctor straight married to a contract lawyer.
Lydia, prone on the floor and bleeding out steadily, looks at him incredulously.
"Emma's found the Trans," he tells Sam as soon as they've hung up. Which takes awhile in between Dean ranting down the telephone at his only daughter for disobeying him and putting herself in danger like that.
"You know what," Sam replies.
Dean meets her eyes for a long moment, weighing the truth in them.
Sam snorts. "God, Dean. Let the man drink something!"
She shrugs again and opens a can, spraying it into her mouth until she can barely close her lips.
Charlie's possibly more enthusiastic about getting back into the bunker than she is about Emma's presence, but she still greets her with a hug, a pet name and an offer to get her a drink from the internet cafe she's camped out in.
Dean rolls his eyes, though he's still got a smile lingering at the edges of his mouth. "You're my first choice of date to hunter prom."
"I don't wanna hear it," Dean tells him. For better or worse, he made this decision and he's sticking with it. Emma is his. He glances over his shoulder at her. She's the same as she was thirty minutes ago. "We need to get Emma some clothes. It'll be easier now you're here."
The second Dean sees her, he knows. A lead weight drops in his gut and he can't take his eyes off her even while her mom gives him the run around. Barely paying attention, Dean manages to get an invitation to come in and have a drink, despite his latest bedpost notch giving him the stinkeye while she reluctantly offers the invitation.
"Dean, wait!" Castiel says, grasping hold of his wrist as he stands. "Sam, I need you to explain this to me. The witches thought Dean wanted to be in a relationship with me..."
"Guess I'll grab my stuff," Kevin mutters.
She wouldn't have. Probably. She never really met Kevin properly, so it was easy to imagine it when she felt desperate. Easy to make it her back up plan. But if she'd had to go through with it she'd probably have got as far as seeing him in person before backing out. And that's if Charlie didn't figure it out and stop her before she even got that far.
Charlie sighs and knocks her shoulder into Emma's. "Sorry, Buff. We'll find another way."
They both snap towards her in sync. "What?"
Not in the mood to question the freaky door, Emma moves further in. It's definitely not a bomb shelter. Or, at least, not just a bomb shelter. The bunker, archive and private library descriptions all seem to suit better, though it's not a particularly big version of any of the above. The low corridor opens out onto a main room filled with books and filing cabinets, with two doors leading off to a small bathroom and a studio set up with two sets of bunk beds. It's not much of a chapter house, but it looks like it served its purpose as an archive and bolt hole until whatever it was happened to its occupants.
Castiel nods and stands from the table, coffee clutched in his left hand as he marks his page and flips the book he was supposedly reading closed.
Castiel must have been stuck in his thoughts longer than he'd imagined. "Yes, Dean?"
"No one's taking you anywhere," Cas assures her, and Dean hopes to god he's right.
"Yes I am! I'm a monster, a..." Emma raises her hands in front of herself and starts to cry. "I'm a..."
"Six years," Dean croaks out. "You were gone six years. We thought- We have your freakin' death certificate! We buried an empty box right next to Mom, and-"
"So why'd you leave?"
"Sam?" Dean repeats with confusion.
Dean takes a breath and reminds himself it's a little too late to decide to murder his kid.
A pause. "No."
Sam's silence is conspicuous.
"Which one do you like?" Claire asks after another two minutes of face stuffing.
The first evening isn't too bad. Dean is... cuddly, for lack of a better word. No, that is the better word. He sits beside Castiel on the couch as the movie plays, arm around Castiel's shoulders and one ankle twined around Castiel's. He doesn't do anything more than that, but it's all more than enough.
Dean's struck, as they say their brief goodbyes to Benny, by how alone he nearly was. He's saying goodbye to too many friends today, with only the promise of a mixed reception from the brother who didn't want him back in return. Then they turn to leave, and Emma's shoulder bumps his. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and presses a kiss into her hair.
"No!" Castiel blurts urgently. Whatever delusion Dean's living through, there is no universe in which Castiel is done with him.
It's perfect.
Claire wrinkles her nose and eyes the plates. "That hipster honey and rose one drizzle one."
They have. It's only the usual research they perform between hunts. Searching for ways to heal the damage the trials did to Sam, to see if there's potentially a way for him to ever finish the trials without it killing him. Looking into angel lore to check for ways to restore Heaven. Important work, but work that will keep. None of them have been particularly motivated for at least a month due to their lack of progress on either front.
Dean doesn't have to look at Sam to know he's unconvinced, but Dean doesn't want to hear it. Still, he doesn't interfere when Sam starts his questioning.
"The hell are you talking about?" Dean asks.
Sam sighs deeply. "What's the point? Are you gonna listen to me?"
"The weak get killed," Rachel says, passing Emma a kitkat. "It wouldn't mean anything if it was easy. Besides," she grins. "It's fun."
"This is an outrage!" Crowley fixes Dean with a glare. "Winchester, if this is some scheme of yours to undermine our case..."
It's lucky Garth is already on the case, as many reservations as Dean has about leaving him with it, because they've barely been in Kearney three hours before Emma calls. The girl's been radio silent since Dean told her to stay out of the way with Charlie and he kind of assumed she was sulking. He remembers how it used to feel when his Dad would give him the same order and he was willing to give her some space to be mad at him, so the call is welcome if a little unexpected.
"Dean?" Castiel questions.
"No," Charlie answers. "But I did leave some stuff in there. Listen, I think it might be a magic lock of some kind."
A deep breath and Sam centres himself. "Are you sure about this? It's kind of a big deal, Dean."
"She made me do math homework," Emma says with a smirk.
By the afternoon, she's sucked it up and decided to check in on Dad. She gets voicemail eight times in a row and is close to chasing him down before he answers. He doesn't sound good.
It hadn't been a hard hunt, there'd been no moment Dean could have thought he'd nearly lost either of them. It hadn't even been particularly long. If anything, it had barely seemed worth the drive time by the end. A regular haunting they'd thought might have demonic elements. Turned out it was just a local group of “tree hugging The Craft cosplayers”, as Dean called them, cluelessly leaving crystals and pentagrams around to try to offer peace to the restless spirit of their dead friend. Once the group had talked to Sam and Dean, they were able to wrap the case up in record time with the information they'd freely shared.
Dean closes off with a nod. "Are we done?"
He'd have imagined strippers. Ones much hotter than Ash, a lot better at dancing, and with a way better soundtrack. Probably a full on club crawl, going from bar to night club to strip club, or a casino, or maybe a trip to some seedy place specifically designed to let comitmentphobic men get all the sleeziness out of their system. He'd have imagined getting so drunk Sam has to carry him back to his home, or maybe hotel room, fending off the heavily slurred confessions of cold feet that would be Dean's last thoughts before passing out.
"You were going to take the deal, weren't you?" Sam asks at last.
"And did hunters..." Jody starts to ask before trailing off.
Sam just looks at him sadly.
It keeps Cas out of his head for a few hours. For the time that he's showing Emma how to use a stick shift, Dean doesn't think about Cas's face when he got his memories back or how he looked when they left, unconscious and battling with the devil from Sam's head. Instead he laughs, even if it hurts a little, and teases her when she kangaroos the car. She gets the hang of it, her innate confidence in her own abilities gliding her through the early nerves of being in control of a car for the first time. Before the day is over, they're cruising along at 50 and her gear changes are as smooth as Sam's. Dean decides she inherited it from him rather than her amazon side.
He's just about ready to ask Emma if she has a cell phone so he can call Sam. He's more than a little surprised that it's Emma that found him and that Sam isn't there, but the only way to get his questions answered is by the man himself, and besides which Dean's missed his brother. He waits until Emma finishes updating Charlie, who opted to stay back in New Orleans to go through the Men of Letters archive Emma says had the information on reapers in it. Dean honestly wonders why none of that ever came up when Cas and Crowley were trying to get into Purgatory at the start of it all, but he's not complaining at the results. He does kind of wish Charlie had come with them to find Benny's bones, but it's a selfish fantasy and he's used to reunions being brief by now.
"Is there..." Sam clears his throat and winces against a full cough. "Is there something you want to tell us? About you and Cas?"
Dean rolls his eyes. "Are you gonna get to the point?"
"When you've figured out if you're gonna kill me or not, I'll be at the library," She says. The door slams behind her.
"Stay behind me," Dean cautions. He has no idea what the Trans' reactions will be to him showing up, and even less idea of their reaction to Emma. It's actually kind of odd thinking about how close Emma's come to meeting Kevin before, just a breath away really, but Dean isn't even sure he ever told Kevin he had a kid.
a run away, and they don't like runaways."
"Case wasn't over. He's sticking around with Garth to finish up," Dean says.
"Funny thing is, she came back all on her own seven months later. Not a scratch on her," Sam says. "Right after a hunter burned down a house full of Amazons."
"Right." Dean doesn't feel so great about not knowing how his kid is going around opening magic doors. Seems like the kind of thing that could end up blowing up in their faces.
"I like the chocolate," Claire says, eyeing the plates in deliberation.
Dean takes a second to let his brain catch up. He doesn't need any extra time to reach a decision, though. "Okay."
By the weekend Jo's convinced him to come drinking. They rarely get a weekend where neither one of them is on the clock or on call, and Dean hasn't been out with the any of guys in at least a month. Hasn't really been anywhere except hospitals and funeral planners.
Dean sees flashes of tan every time he wakes up. Sees it out of the corner of his eye. Sees it, just for a second, over his own shoulders sometimes when he catches his reflection. Then he sees it everywhere.
"What I've been offerring for the last two years!" Cas replies. "I have been here, I have taken care of them, I have kept them safe and loved them. Where were you?"
Dean shoots her a look and she quietens and falls in behind him as they approach the diner.
"Archives?" The man repeats. He looks around the area. Emma guesses there were houses not too long ago, but either they haven't got around to rebuilding or they haven't bothered. "I don't know about any of that, but you're standing on top of that bomb shelter."
"I understand that your part was the spell, but I felt the need to be honest after today," Castiel says.
Dean plans on showing her how to change a tire and the oil next.
"She's my kid, Sam," Dean says. No matter how many times he says it, it never seems to stick. "And yeah, I believe her. She's not one of them. Why would she bother to come find me? Get me out of Purgatory? Their whole thing is killing their dads, not bringing them back from the dead. I don't know what the hell your problem is, but she's the only person in this family who
But he can't risk it. Tries to distract her with a straight to video movie playing on the crappy TV set.
"If you won't come with us, then at least find somewhere else to stay," Emma says. "If I found you, then who knows who else can."
"Your mother was a strong warrior," one of them tells her. She's introduced herself as Erin. Apparently she's in charge of graduated initiates. And apparently, as Dad's presumed dead, they're willing to say she's most of the way to initiated. She'll still have to join in on the mankilling, but for now they're more interested in training her. "You will be too."
Sam makes a vague noise of disagreement. Sam was barely six months old when Mom died, and even he remembers how badly Dad broke down. So badly Sam's formative memories of the guy were probably of him crying and drinking and yelling. "Still, can't be easy."
"It's not forever," Dean tries. "And Jody's good people. You'll like hanging out with her. We need to do this, and I can't be worrying about you while we do."
"Exactly."
"Tamara's just a witch. She has nothing to do with any of this," Mrs. Tran argues. "I asked her to make something for me, that's all."
"Well, they weren't," Dean says. "And it doesn't matter anyway."
"Tell me! This whole rapid aging thing has to have some downsides, right? How often do I need to feed her?" Dean presses. "Is there special Amazon baby formula?"
Emma flips through the textbooks in front of her angrily enough she nearly tears a page and forces herself to calm down. She's in no state of mind to do anything productive, and the fact that even with her supernatural memory she can't remember a single thing she's been studying for the past hour is testiment to that, but she doesn't know what else to do. She'd switch from normal school subjects to supernatural ones but she doubts that'd fair any better and it's not like the local library is likely to have much by way of research materials. Even if Uncle Sam usually managed to find something.
Dean shrugs. "He's got to. Can't break down when you've got two kids to look after, I guess."
"She's not human," Cas says, though Dean's pretty sure everyone here already knows that.
"Will they come after you?" Jody asks after a moment.
"Dean?"
"No deal," Charlie blurts and reverses the summons. Emma hadn't even known that was a thing. Dad and Uncle Sam had only ever mentioned summoning and exorcism.
Understandable. Dean would opt out of dealing with himself if he could.
"Cas?" Dean says after a moment, likely noticing Castiel's uneven breathing. "Hey, what's up?"
"You got lucky. You know that?" Sam tells him. "Lydia wasn't supposed to be there alone with her. She must have given birth early or something. If you'd tried this with the other amazons there-"
"And I'm looking out for you," Jo says, just a touch of slurring around the edges as the orders the next round with nothing more than a raised hand at the bartender. "I love Cas. He's great, and we all wanna look out for him. But I love you, too. I'm just saying, you take on a lot of other people's shit, and that's admirable or whatever, but sooner or later you're gonna burn yourself out."
"Stay out of it!" Naomi snaps.
"That he knew how to get into Purgatory!" Emma replies easily. "He was going to tell me, too. We were just figuring out terms, and then he realised I was a Winchester and it went to shit."
Dean's making burgers when Cas comes back from the lawyer's office. One look at Cas and his heart sinks to his boots.
"And then there's the, uh..." He gestures to her eyes and hands.
Emmanuel doesn't even attempt to answer her now. He's looking more and more horrified with every word from her mouth.
It's not a warm coat, but it's long and it's an extra layer, so Dean fumbles it over himself in the best approximation of a blanket he can manage and curls up into the seat to try to get some shuteye.
Emma's oblivious. It's her first time eating out and she's enraptured with everything from the faintly sticky menus to their ashtray scented waitress. She's ordered more food than Dean, and Dean's pretty sure she'll eat it all.
"Why don't you ask her what
It's hard and it's painful, and there's not a day goes by that Emma doesn't wonder why the hell she's doing this to herself. She could escape, she's sure of it. They'd find her again, and as badass as Jody is, Emma doubts she'd be able to fend off a whole tribe of Amazons. But then Emma grew up with Dad, even if the growing up was kind of condensed, and she knows how to live on the road. She could run and she could keep running.
"No," Castiel says as reassuring as he's able. "No, it's not that. I'm fine, really. I just... I need to call Sam."
"Okay," Dean says with another laugh. "Needy. I'll go with May fourteenth, two-thousand-nine."
"I hate to ask you for more."
"I'm sorry, Dean. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable," Castiel says.
"I know. But I've tried everything I can think of to get that door open and nothing. And before Emma opened it the folks around here tried, too, and they didn't get anywhere," Charlie says.
The documents Dad had made for her put her at fifteen when he left. He said it'd be easier for her to blend in at High School if she got to start from the first year, and really, they couldn't be sure how old she was physically anyway. He needn't have bothered. She fits in about as well as she would if she went around in monster mode, and about the only class she doesn't hate the existence of is Latin, purely because it helps her with her research. She's almost as fluent as her teacher by now. Probably more in some ways, given her non-school assigned reading.
Until she tells him why she called.
Dean catches his free hand before he can retreat and presses another kiss to the back of it. "Lemme know if you need anything."
"I don't have any flowers," Cas says with a poor attempt at a light hearted smile.
"Sweetheart, I've killed scarier monsters than you in my sleep," Dean says, hand twitching towards his belt. "You picked the wrong baby daddy."
"Then I rebelled," Castiel adds, lips feeling numb around the words.
"You better," Emma says, arms finally unfolding and hugging him back just as he moves to go. When he does disentangle, Emma pushes past him to the door. "I'm still mad at you."
"Sam, she's mine. I know she's..."
"We're not even-!" Dean looks around and lowers his voice. "We're not even really getting married."
"What do you want?" Lydia demands.
Dean's head is still pounding at 10am the next morning as chugs black coffee and tries to make himself drink just as much water to stop the coffee from making the dehydration worse. Cas, god love him, made breakfast and told Dean he'd pick Claire up instead, and if this is the kind of treatment he can look forward to then he might seriously consider moving in on a more permanent basis. Even Jack has the decency to sit quietly in his bouncer while Dean's aspirin kicks in.
, this is real. How I feel is real. I remember feeling like this every day for five goddamn years! Like hell is that from some stupid spell!"
"I'll take Claire to the store tomorrow for buffet food if you write out a list," Cas says when they've well and truly determined that they've done all they can tonight.
Sam doesn't bother being casual.
Emma tucks into her sandwich.
"You believe her," Sam says and it's not a question. He shakes his head. "Of course."
He doesn't know what he's said to get this far. His mouth was on autopilot, only knowing he had to get closer to... to her. "Yeah," he responds belatedly. He steps towards the crib the moment he's alone with the baby. She's beautiful. Dean looks up as Lydia comes back in with the drinks. He must've been staring longer than he'd thought. "What's her name?"
