Dean opened his mouth to reply, but before he could say a word, Castiel walked in the front door with Miracle by his side.
“That's weird. He’s supposed to be in the house,” Dean said. “I’m gonna go check on him, just to make sure everything's alright. I’ll be back in a minute.”
Dean took the key out of the box and unlocked the door, finding a stairway leading to what looked like a basement. He looked at Cas with confusion once more before walking down, trying to adjust his eyes to the darkness downstairs.
Cas’s eyes widened as he watched Dean kneel down and take a small velvet box out of the pocket of his jacket.
“I love you, too,” Gabriel responded with a laugh, standing on his tiptoes and giving Sam a peck on the lips.
“Okay, fine,” Gabe sighed, making the star appear on top of the tree with a simple wave of his hand. “Done.”
, he loved Cas, too, but saying it out loud seemed difficult. He thought about it daily, but he was searching for the right moment to say it. It’s not like he could just walk up to Cas and declare his undying love. That would be too much, even for Cas, so Dean decided to wait until he found the right opportunity and the right way to let Cas know about his feelings.
Dean barely paid attention to the loud conversation that could be heard all over the crowded living room; he was far too busy searching for the presents that belonged to him. He’d found four of them so far, from Sam, Bobby, Santa, and Charlie. He knew there would be more, but there were so many boxes around him that looking through the name tags on every single one took ages.
Dean and Cas walked slowly along a small creek that ran through their whole neighborhood. Dean was unusually quiet; he knew all too well that there wouldn’t come a time more perfect than this, but he was still trying to figure out what he wanted to say.
“Thanks,” Sam rolled his eyes before watching Dean walk out of the room and close the door behind him.
“Okay,” Castiel nodded, swallowing hard before getting under the blanket and wrapping his arm around Dean. Dean leaned his head on Cas’s shoulder in response.
“We have an announcement!” Dean yelled through the crowd after they arrived back home. Everyone in the room turned to him and Cas, waiting for him to continue, but instead of speaking, Dean simply held up his hand so that the ring on his finger was clearly visible.
“Perfect. Anyone else wants to help?” Cas inquired. After looking around the room, his eyes stayed on Dean.
“I want your advice. Do you think he will like these?” Dean asked, looking at the tray he was holding.
“Do you wanna play?” Dean asked. “This snow is so amazing that it would be a shame if we didn’t take advantage of it.”
“Yeah, I need a drink,” Sam decided, heading to the kitchen, groaning as he heard Dean laugh as he was walking away.
“That is the ugliest decoration I’ve ever seen,” Dean declared, looking at the huge, magenta-colored snowflake hanging above the front door of the house.
“Look, Sammy!” Dean barged into Sam’s room on Christmas Morning without warning. Sam was still in his bed, half-asleep.
This was the moment Dean had been waiting for, and he knew it. He needed to tell Cas how he felt and this seemed like a now or never moment. He didn’t want to choose never.
“What is your opinion, Dean?” Castiel asked, not wanting to make the mistake of falling for one of Gabriel’s pranks again.
“Well,” Castiel began, not knowing how to phrase what he was about to say. “I decorated the entire living room. There is a lot of magenta.”
“Hey, buddy,” Dean said gently as he stepped into the room. Miracle ran up to him excitedly as soon as he noticed him. “Stop smashing my ornaments,” Dean said while kneeling down to pet Miracle. “Come on, let’s get you out of here,” he continued, standing up and leading Miracle out of the room. Miracle looked back on the ruined decoration once more before turning his back to it and following Dean. “Good boy,” Dean smiled as he closed the door behind him.
you shouldn’t take decorating advice from Gabriel,” Dean suggested. “Let’s get this thing off before anyone sees it.”
“What is it?” Dean asked, looking up. Cas walked over to him, handing him what appeared to be a Christmas card.
“Yeah, but using a miracle wouldn’t be authentic,” Sam said. “I want to make something myself, you know?”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded when he finally mustered enough courage to glance up and see Gabriel wearing a white shirt.
The New Year's bonus chapter is going to be uploaded tomorrow, along with the link to the PDF version of the whole series. :)
“Oh my God, it’s a fucking reindeer,” Sam stated the obvious as he stepped into the room. He didn’t even need to ask Gabe whether it was the gift they were just talking about. He knew it was. “Are you serious?” he asked, turning around and shaking his head.
gift when we start opening presents. This is just something I wanted to give you without anyone else seeing it.”
Dean left Sam’s room with a huge grin on his face, and headed downstairs to show Cas his discovery as well.
“Oh, come on,” Charlie said, holding out his hand to help Dean get up. “I’ve seen you two make out in the parking lot,” she continued as Dean took her hand. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell Sam if you’re not ready.”
Dean stayed silent for a few moments before glancing down at Miracle. He seemed perfectly fine, not upset about the antlers at all.
“I’m sorry,” Gabriel apologized upon seeing Dean’s anger, “but you have to admit that the idea of a Winchester not being tall enough for something is quite comical.”
Before settling down in Heaven, Castiel had always thought sleeping was pointless, but he decided to give it a try a few days before Christmas. He felt exhausted from organizing the decoration of the whole neighborhood, and Sam explained to him that when humans felt that way, sleeping helped them
“No, it’s the opposite, actually,” Dean informed him. “The living room is finished, and we’d like you to take a look at it.”
“I have to admit, I was quite happy that you wanted to come for a walk,” he finally broke the silence. “There is something I wanted to ask you.”
“Yeah, why not?” Dean questioned. “Everyone else will be leaving out milk, he’ll get sick of it by the time he gets here. He’ll appreciate the alcohol.”
Sam and Dean should have suspected that leaving Gabriel alone with Miracle wasn’t a good idea, even if it was only for a few minutes while they went upstairs to set up the guest bedrooms. Unfortunately, Gabriel managed to convince them that it was going to be alright when in reality, it wasn’t. Dean realized this when he returned downstairs to pick up some extra pillows, and he saw Miracle run up to him.
“I think I’ll enjoy living with you,” Jack continued. “And I’ve been missing Miracle as well. It’ll be great to see him again.”
“Maybe I just can’t wait to see what Santa has brought me,” Gabe replied with fake innocence. “Or maybe it’s about something else,” he added ominously.
Dean got pulled out of his thoughts when Cas walked up to him, showing him a cookie that looked so wonky that Cas had probably formed it with his hands instead of using a cookie cutter like he should have.
Most people nodded in agreement. Even Charlie, who, up until that point, had concentrated all her attention on the book she had received from her girlfriend, looked up after hearing Dean’s words.
Sorry for these shorter chapters but ever since Taylor Swift has decided to release a new surprise album a few days ago, I couldn't concentrate on anything else lol. I promise I'll get back to writing some longer chapters soon.
“That’s true,” joined Charlie the conversation. “One of the reasons I always look forward to Christmas is because I love decorating so much.”
“Look what you’ve done,” Dean said sternly, letting go of Cas and walking up to Miracle. “You murdered my snowman. There will be consequences.” He shook his head in disapproval but he couldn’t help the smile that crept onto his face as he leaned down to pet Miracle.
perfect and not personal enough, so Cas got some wrapping paper and colorful ribbons, and began wrapping them the human way.
When Sam had first arrived in Heaven, he was delighted to find that his and Dean’s house had a vast library containing every single one of his favorite books as well as the ones he’d always wanted to read but never got around to actually doing it. There were so many books, in fact, that Sam didn’t even know which one to start reading first, so after a few days of contemplation, he decided to re-read The Lord of the Rings before starting anything new.
“Dean, if you don’t like magenta, I think I have something to tell you before we go inside,” Castiel confessed.
“Okay,” Dean smiled. “But you might have to explain the rules to some of us. I’ve never played this game before.”
Sam had always had a way of miraculously showing up right when Cas and Dean would want an intimate moment all to themselves, but Dean had no idea just how frustrating this could get until he had his first kiss with Cas. They were still cuddling on the couch, not even ten minutes after the kiss had happened, when Sam arrived home and started rambling about how much he wanted to stay in for the night and watch a movie together.
Dean didn’t remember the last time he felt this proud of something he helped create. He smiled to himself as he walked around the crowd hand in hand with Castiel, trying to talk to everyone for at least a few minutes before dinner.
“I never really left,” Jack replied, “but I know what you mean. I came back because I missed you guys.”
“Miracle, stop!” Dean groaned as he picked up the silver-colored ornament that had landed on the floor for the third time in ten minutes. He tried to put it back to its original spot but he ultimately decided against it as he looked at Miracle, who was staring at the ornament expectantly.
“Did you just put fake antlers on the dog?” Dean asked with the tone that a parent would use right after discovering that their child had snuck out of the house without permission.
“I love you so much,” he said softly after pulling away. “And I can’t believe Gabriel actually gave good advice for once. You know, if marriage was a thing in Heaven…”
about Christmas traditions, not the internet. And by the way, how were you even able to use it? I didn’t think we had access up here.”
“Yeah, but that would mean nothing if you weren’t such a fast learner,” Dean said, standing up and walking over to the fridge for another beer.
“It was my choice, Dean. You couldn’t have stopped me.” Cas cupped Dean’s cheek in his hand. “Everything is fine now,” he said softly, and strangely enough, Dean believed him.
Dean looked up at Sam, who was currently standing in the middle of the room, looking mildly irritated. Dean didn’t move, nor did he seem guilty in the slightest.
Being confronted with the sight of a half-naked Gabriel was not something Dean had expected when he decided to head to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee, yet here he was, standing in the middle of the room awkwardly, trying to look at anything but Gabe in front of him.
Secondly, I have some announcements to make. Even though today's chapter was the last one in this series, I am not quite ready to let go of this story just yet. Because of this, I have decided to do the following:
“I hope I can do the same for you,” Dean responded, closing his eyes and burying his head in Cas’s shoulder.
“Sam ships you two,” Gabriel laughed, making everyone in the room, except for Dean and Cas, laugh as well.
It was around 6 pm when guests started arriving at the Winchester house for Christmas dinner. Charlie and her girlfriend were the first ones, but everyone else followed shortly after as well. Half an hour later, the sound of people chatting and laughing filled the entire living room, and several piles of gifts sat under the tree, waiting to opened on Christmas morning. Even those who were usually skeptic about Christmas couldn't help but enjoy themselves as they admired the strings of lights that illuminated the room, and felt the scent of gingerbread all around thanks to Castiel's cookies.
“Come on,” he told Cas, walking out the door. Cas followed him close behind, closing the front door as he stepped outside.
“Don’t worry,” Cas reassured him as he slid over to where Dean was standing. “I promise I won’t let you fall. Please try it with me.”
to fix everything even though Gabriel, Castiel, and Jack were all there as well, and they were all more qualified to solve sudden emergencies than Sam. By the time everyone went to sleep, Sam wanted nothing more than to follow them and finally fall asleep in the comforting silence of his bedroom. He was already in his pajamas, ready to rest, when Dean knocked on his door.
“We’ll be back soon,” Dean said as he stood up and walked over to the coat rack, getting both his and Castiel’s coats.
“Finally,” Dean groaned, turning to Cas and grabbing his hand before kissing him passionately. Cas responded with equal excitement, stepping forward and backing Dean up against the wall of the house. Dean sighed into the kiss in response, pulling Cas even closer.
Dean was standing in the kitchen now, leaning against the counter with a beer in hand. The idea was that he would help Sam cook dinner, but it quickly turned into Sam doing all the work while Dean kept making sarcastic remarks and being utterly unhelpful.
After more than a decade of knowing Castiel, there weren’t that many things Cas could say that surprised Dean anymore, but this one did make him put down the book he was reading.
Castiel knew he was in trouble the moment he heard Sam and Dean open the front door of the house. He heard faint sounds of conversation followed by utter silence as the boys entered the living room.
When Cas and Dean started decorating the large Christmas tree that Sam had brought home, they were quick to discover that trying to decorate with an overenthusiastic dog in the room was quite a challenge.
“Well, you better get used to it,” Dean said, pulling Cas close and resting his head on the angel's shoulder. He closed his eyes, contemplating how unbelievably lucky he felt. Not only was he in Heaven, but he also had his brother by his side, and Heaven’s most beautiful angel was in love with
“What? Why do you think I could write poetry? And what is it? Interrogation?” he asks maybe a little too much nervously.
“It's because of what I said earlier to Sam. That's why you're angry at me? I didn't know, I shouldn't have talked about this.”
Dean opens a door, walks inside and lays Cas gently on the table. Looking at the dead body of his best friend is too painful for him. He feels like his heart, if he has a heart at all, breaks in half. Castiel was his family, he and Sam were the most important persons in his life, and now he lost one of them.
Cas doesn't sleep for the rest of the night. He gets up in the morning and walks to the kitchen, thinking that he needs a coffee. He takes a mug, the blue one with an elephant - the gift from Dean, and turns on the coffee maker.
Memories come back to him fast: he rescued Cas from the Empty, he said the first 'I love you', they kissed and the rest of the day, they spent in each other's arms. None of them wanted to pull away first. And that's why they are here now, he and Cas, so close to each other that they take only a half of the bed. Dean's head is resting on Cas' chest, who would've thought that the angel can be so comfy pillow? He can also feel Cas' hands wrapped around him, touching his back, and a sweet scent of his body, Cas always smells like strawberries.
“Can you shut up, bastard?” he murmurs to himself, walking to the Sam's room. Tonight, he just wants to drink a beer in quiet, but of course, a kid must whine all the time. Now, Sam is showering, so he can't take care of him. And a baby cries so hard.
“I don't know. Do with him whatever you want, he’s your responsibility. I don't even care if he'll live one day,” he says, shrugging his arms like he really doesn't care.
“I understand.” Cas nodded and took a sip of his drink. Dean did the same, and after that, he put the bottle on the coffee table.
Cas thinks it is his best line. But he has some simply phrase in his head, only three words, which is even better and more beautiful. Reserved for Dean. He even said it two years ago when he almost died, but then he added quickly “I love all of you”.
Cas interrupts him. “Dean, you said it was friends date. You don't need to feel obligated and do anything against your will.”
“Nothing. It's the thing that you don't owe me anything, Dean. You don't have to do all of these things to comfort me, only because you feel guilt and sense of obligation.”
He opens the door and walks into the room. Dean is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall, he doesn’t look at him.
“Sure! Bye, give Dean a kiss for me,” says Jody and hangs up before Castiel reacts for her words.  He seems to be surprised, he has to do what?! Why did Jody ask him about that
Dean looked at Cas and later at the baggage. He couldn't help the big grin, it was the best news he could receive.
„Sam, what is it?” asked Cas and pointed at the stall in the grocery shop. It was full of valentine’s cards, and Sam reminded what day it was.
“Sorry? For what?” he asked a little confused. It was just a stupid card, and he thought they could just laugh off and forget about this.
“I'm like Freddie.” It's the only thing comes from Dean's mouth. He's staring on the road, hands on the wheel, his knuckles turn white
Is it some better place? Or a hell for the angels? Is he suffering now? Will he suffer forever? And maybe it's just darkness, emptiness... He doesn't want to know because the answer could be even more destructive to him...
Two weeks later, Sam and Dean has a case. Easy one which took them only one day. They killed a couple of vampires and goes to the bar after that.
Dean stopped touching him. That was it, the end of the moment of true happiness. Now only cold left.
“Dean, you should eat something. And don't you want to drink coffee too? I can do it for you,” offers Cas, and Dean grips him even tighter, burying his face in the crook of Cas' neck.
“Yes, and then you’re spending a few hours, waiting for help. In the middle of the case,” He pointed.
He opens one of the drawers, there's a picture with all personnel. He inverts a photo, seeing a date
“My apologies, Dean.” Cas goes away, not waiting for anything. There’s nothing for him. Not anymore.
“It's danger to hold a baby near the stove. You can burn him... Just give him to me, I can take care of him for five minutes,” insisted Dean. Cas turned to him, and bit his lip as he wasn't sure if it was good idea.
“I don't know… I think it started when I pulled him out from hell, but I didn't know then that it was love,” Cas whispers, regretting that he doesn't have a next drink.
“No. You,” he says quickly, and when he realizes what he said, he makes red at once: “I mean, not you either… I…”
Dean lost his home when he was four. Since then, he was trying to find some replacement. Any motel room wasn't enough, Bobby's house was burnt, but finally, he found a bunker.
“Cas, look at me,” he asks him, putting his hand on Cas' arm. “It's okay because it wasn't real and this... this is a proof.”
“No,” he says fast, and takes a plate to keep his hands busy. Sam nods, the conversation is over, good that they talk at all, but if Dean is going to open himself some day?
Dean feels how his heart stops for the moment. What the hell does it mean? What is he talking about? Cas is staring at him, but he won’t elaborate. He said too much already.
They're sitting at the map table on the bunker. It's getting to late. Dean glances on Cas who is reading some manuscript, and licks his lips unknowingly. Sam notices this, but of course says nothing.
“It’s… I…” He’s tongue-tied, but it’s okay because Cas doesn’t need an answer to that question. He knows what it is, and it’s not the point.
Dean takes a glass and goes to the sink. He pours water and comes closer to Cas, looking over his shoulder.
“Mom is dead,” he says, ending discussion. Or rather hoping that it ends that pointless conversation.
“You know, years of practice…” he jokes, but he stops preparing a meal and turns to Sam. He has more to say. “But to be honest, I was wondering about this too. And I have even a theory, but it's stupid.”
The third time, he catches John in the Impala. It's funny that heaven has two versions of this car, one belongs to Dean.
“Me?” Dean is surprised how strange his voice sounds. He clears his throat after that, but doesn’t say anything more. Cas is still staring at the same page for a moment. Finally, he closes the magazine.
Castiel made a lot of mistakes, some of them he will be regretting for the rest of his life. And one of this will be the day when he trusted Metatron and made that angels fell.
He hesitated just a moment before he walked back in the library. Dean sat still there, but something on his face changed. He looked shocked, but also so soft. His fingers were touching his lips, the place when Cas kissed him a moment ago.
“Yes, of course!” Sam exclaimed. “You know how long I’ve been waiting for you two finally realize your feelings for each other? I’ve spent more than a decade pretending not to notice the awkward tension between you. So, yeah, I’m happy that you’ve finally sorted this whole mess out.”
Castiel had never been the type who liked to lock his bedroom door. He’d never even had a bedroom before moving in with Sam and Dean, but when he joined them in Heaven, Dean insisted that Cas should get his own room, even if he wasn’t going to actually sleep in it. Cas didn’t understand the point of it right away, but after a few weeks, he realized how nice it was to have somewhere to retreat to when he needed some time alone.
“Oh, hey, buddy,” Dean greeted Miracle excitedly. “Good to see you two back.” He knelt down to pet Miracle then looked up at Cas. “Thank you for taking him out,” he smiled.
Spending the whole afternoon with the gifts wasn’t his initial plan, of course. No, he tried to use a miracle to get the job done, but as he stared at the perfectly wrapped presents on his desk, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something wasn’t right. It took him a few minutes to realize what was wrong, but he managed to figure it out. The problem was precisely the gifts’ perfection. They looked
“Wait, but you’re an angel,” said Jo. “Couldn’t you turn this whole place into a winter wonderland at the click of a finger?”
“Oh, yeah, that’s possible,” Cas nodded with a stoic calmness that freaked Sam out a little. “I saw him, too, yesterday.”
Dean had never cared much for winter back on Earth. He hated how slippery the roads got when it rained or snowed, and he wasn’t the biggest fan of the cold and gray weather, either. All of that changed, however, when he first saw what a snowy day looked like in Heaven.
“This is the one we left out for Santa last night!” Dean explained. “The cookies have vanished! He ate them all!”
“Thank you,” Cas smiled. “I’m scared that I still don’t know enough about Christmas to make everyone happy, and I want to learn.”
“Cas?” he asked after knocking on Castiel’s door. When he got no answer, he opened it slightly, smiling to himself as he saw that Cas was in bed. He stepped into the room quietly, walking over to Cas’s bed and kneeling on the floor next to him. “Hey,” he whispered, trying to wake Cas up without coming off as too harsh. “Cas?”
As much as Sam enjoyed being the host on Christmas Eve, it was an exhausting task, considering the sheer number of guests attending. Whenever something unexpected happened, people kept expecting
“Wow, thank you, Cas,” he finally said. “You could have done that sooner, but still. Thanks. I’m gonna go get myself some water,” he sighed, shuffling away.
Upon hearing Cas’s concerns, Dean stood up from the bed and walked over to him, taking Cas’s hands in his own.
“Why are you like this?” Dean sighed when Gabriel interrupted his breakfast for the fourth time in fifteen minutes to ask when they could start opening Christmas presents.
Dean searched the entire house for Miracle before finding him in one of the guest rooms. He somehow managed to knock almost all of the carefully crafted decoration to the floor, shattering some ornaments in the process.
“Yeah,” Cas nodded before reaching into one of his pockets and pulling out a box that looked quite similar to Dean’s one. “Will you marry me, Dean?” he asked.
“But he’s cute!” Gabe objected. “At least let me keep them until tomorrow morning. Everyone would think they’re adorable.”
“Can you explain to me what is going on?” Cas asked, confused. “Why does it matter that we are standing under a mistletoe?”
“Here, this will help,” Cas said, taking a blanket from the back of the couch and handing it to Dean.
on repeat?” Sam asked as he stepped into the living room, glaring at Dean, who was lying on one of their couches with his head in Castiel’s lap.
“I think this one is yours as well,” he heard Castiel’s voice from behind him. He smiled as he turned around, taking the small box Castiel was holding out for him.
Dean was quick to react. He took a large amount of snow from around him, formed it into a ball, and threw it in his brother’s direction.
“What do you say we take a break until Sam gets home to help?” Dean suggested. “We could drink some eggnog.”
Today was an especially busy day, and almost every sitting spot in the living room was occupied. Bobby and Dean were sitting on the large couch in front of the fireplace, while Gabriel lay sprawled out on the smaller one with his legs draped over Sam’s lap. Jo and Charlie were also there, sitting in the two armchairs placed in the corner of the room. Everyone was quite comfortable except for Castiel, who was sitting on the floor, surrounded by a pile of Christmas decorations, which he said were prototypes for his neighborhood decoration project.
Dean was about to kiss him again when he noticed Miracle run up to the snowman he had previously built in the front yard. Miracle jumped on it unceremoniously, destroying the entire left half of its body.
“No shit, Sherlock,” he said, trying to pass it off as a joke but Sam heard the nervousness in his voice.
“Oh, fuck,” Dean cursed. Cas was confused at first but when he turned around to check what Dean was staring at, he realized what had happened.
“It’s perfect,” he smiled, admiring how it looked on Cas. It was simple and elegant, exactly Cas’s style.
“Is this okay?” he asked, not sure whether Cas was comfortable with that level of physical affection.
Although Dean didn't understand why Sam was asking this of him, he complied without a second thought.
For the first time in his life, Dean felt complete. He knew Jack would come downstairs soon, and the four of them would all gather around the TV for a movie marathon, most likely watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He knew Sam would keep commenting on every scene, bombarding them with fun facts and trivia about the production of the movies. He knew Jack would want to drink beer, but he also knew he would hate the taste. Dean smiled to himself at the thought. He couldn’t imagine a better way to spend his night. Cas, Sam, and Jack were his family, and they were by his side, forevermore. Nothing else mattered.
“We almost forgot to leave cookies out for Santa,” Dean said as he stepped into the room with a tray of cookies in his hand. “We can’t forget about Santa!”
“Yeah, I’m sure he will,” Sam nodded as he examined the cookies. They were ones he’d made himself earlier that day, so he knew they tasted good.
Dean struggled to find enough time alone with Cas that night. No matter which room of the house he entered, he found himself face to face with at least five people, some of whom he barely even knew. He normally didn’t mind big crowds, and he loved a good party, but now that he desperately wanted to find a private spot, he thought it was immensely annoying.
“You said we’d be here together,” Castiel whispers into the still air. “I love you, Dean Winchester.”
Dean leans forward, kissing Cas' neck as he moves both hands to the down feathers by Cas' shoulder blades.
Sam groans slapping his forehead. Dean covers his blushing face, looking away. "No, I mean, you both have been avoiding your damn feelings. Just talk and kiss already. I'm sick of the tension." Sam says, waving a hand as he walks away with his crutches.
"Nothing. I'm fine." Dean shakes his head while fixing his eyes on his hands. After a few minutes of silence, Dean sighs. "It's just... It's my fault. I'm a terrible brother and a worse friend."
Castiel stands alone in the dungeon, waiting for the Blackness to come back. To drop Dean in front of him.
“If Sam hadn’t been such an assbutt I probably never would have said anything...I was so sure that you secretly hated me or something along those lines.”
Cas frowned and tilted his head in confusion. “Dean there is no cat anywhere near me or even in this bunker for that matter, you’ve repeatedly told Sam and I that animals are not allowed in the bunker.”
Cas began to relax, pleasure taking over. He started to let out moans and whines, arching his back a little.
Cas’ eyes roll to the back of his head, and one look at the grin on Dean’s face, Cas knew he was done for. There was no way he’d be able to walk much less stand after this.
"It just seems familiar somehow. I don't know why." Dean says, but stops. "Wait, you said it 'sounds nice'?"
Dean leaves the room, leaving the door open a crack as he goes to get beer, popcorn, m&m's and Doritos.
"Shut it Gabriel." Dean winces. He turns to Cas and presses his face against Cas' hand. "I don't think so....but it hurts."
Cas cuddles up to Dean as he hums against Cas’ head, leaving small kisses as they watch together. Dean rubs circles on Cas' back and shoulders.
He sent Dean to the Empty. He made Dean happy, to tell him he loved and cared for him, and sent him away.
"I mean, we could ask him, but I don't know if he'd tell us or not." Sam sighs. "Well, Gabriel called me a bit ago, and he'll be here soon, so I'm gonna take a shower."
“I guess I j-just... I worry that one day you’ll find someone funnier, better looking, o-or someone that you just overall are more attracted to...I know that I-I’m awkward and I don’t understand a lot of the human things you enjoy or find humorous...I just don’t want to lose you- I can’t l-lose you...”
"You didn't have to summon the Empty for me. We could've gone down, guns blazing together. I-I wish we could have fought her together."
“Dean, you gave Sam the information you had. There was no way you could’ve known there was more than just a vampire. You’ve always said that this job has risks, every time you go out you’re risking getting hurt or worse. And as for spending time outside of hunts? You haven’t really had time. You’ve been nonstop hunting Dean. I understand that there’s no time to just ‘hang out’ if you’re hunting. You’re tearing yourself apart over things nobody is upset with you about.”
Dean nods. "No hospitals. I trust you more than the highest-ranking doctor." Since Dean was facing away from Cas, he couldn't see the slight blush on his face.
Dean's climax followed Castiel's shortly after, causing him to scream out his angel's name.Dean lay panting on Cas' chest before pulling out slowly to lay beside him.
Cas buried his face in Dean’s chest, crying silently. Gabe popped his head in the room “Hey what’s goin’ on in- Hey! What’s up with my little brother? Dean what did you do?”
Cas moaned louder and rolled his hips faster against Dean’s, his hands gripping Dean’s shirt tightly.
"Cas, baby. I'm either going to fuck you into the mattress and make you groan, moan, and scream until you lose your voice. Or slam into you so hard that you won't be able to walk without a limp for a week." Dean growls, nipping at Cas' collarbone as he squeezes out lube onto his fingers. “Maybe both.”
Cas grinned and held his hand, starting to walk back towards the kitchen with him. “Worse than you hitting him in the face with pancakes?”
Cas stopped immediately and swam closer, concern and guilt evident in his face “I-I’m sorry are you okay?”
"Baby, relax." Dean whispers. He began working his finger in and out of Cas, stroking a sensitive bundle of nerves. Once that finger moved easily in and out, he added a second finger and began scissoring them apart to stretch the tight entrance. As Dean does this, he's nipping bruises along Cas' neck and collarbone, kissing the pre existing ones.
Dean swallows hard, looking up at the ceiling before looking back down at the floor. As if he wants it to just open up and swallow him into the bunker.
Dean smiles, swimming up to meet Cas. "I don't think I've ever swam for fun before. Normally it's to dive in after someone..." Dean sighs.
"Are too." Dean replies, setting the food on the nightstand. "Move over so we can cuddle." Dean says, cupping a hand on Cas' jaw and kisses him. Cas moves over, wrapping them both in Dean’s comforter.
Castiel's smile broadens. The burden was on him for making the deal to save Jack. Not Dean. And now that Castiel doesn’t have his grace, he could be happy.
"So have I. I-I've been... scared of telling you. I didn't want to get rejected and things be awkward, so I've... kept it to myself." He reaches forward, slowly lacing his fingers in Cas'. "Cas. I-I love you."
“Removing your grace. I know you're an angel, and that last time you were human it- it didn’t end well…. But I want you to stay. This seems like the only option where we’re both alive. Both here. Both together.” Dean says, his face a light pink. “I need you with me, Cas. Do you trust me?”
"Cas," Dean murmurs in Cas' ear. "I wouldn't have been your fault. Stop beating yourself up over things being your fault. You have no control over what can happen. We've got to just do our best. And you were. You were doing your best at being happy."
Cas smiled a little. “Last time you made pancakes you tried to flip one like those fancy chefs and you got the pancake stuck to the ceiling.”
Gabe rolled his eyes. “Well Deano as the older brother I am obligated to tell you that if you hurt Cas in any way shape or form I will have to smite you.”
Cas nuzzles into him and mumbles again, something along the lines of “I love you.” and “can’t walk.”
Cas shook his head quickly leaned across the table to pull Dean into a rather spicy kiss considering their surroundings
Cas sits up and takes off the hoodie Dean had given him. He turned so he was facing away from Dean and took a deep breath. Suddenly his wings appeared.
Cas groans softly and tries to nuzzle closer to Dean to cuddle, not caring that they were laying on the ground.
The barn's roof rattles, causing Dean's heart to drop. He knows what happens in this. He remembers it as clear as day. But right now? Right now he doesn't want to remember. He wants to look away, to leave this room and never come back. But a part of him wants to see him again. Even if it's a memory. He wants to see Castiel again. Even if it's the last time.
Dean sat on his bed, sketchbook on his lap, and headphones on his head. Blasting AC/DC, he was drawing a tree, with two figures underneath. There was a bag of caramel candies beside him, alongside a couple of energy drinks.
Dean smiles, flipping the two of them so Cas was beneath him, growling as he started trailing kisses down Cas' neck, nipping at different points.
Cas shot a glare Gabe’s way. “Shouldn’t you be off flirting with Sam?” Gabe stood there, face red, trying to come up with some sort of witty remark.
"Welcome to the Sugar Shack. My name's Marissa. What can I help you with today?" The waitress with brown hair says. Dean frowns slightly, noticing that Cas wasn't looking at him anymore.
The waitress comes back, putting Dean and Cas' food in front of them. "If you have any questions, just let me know." Marissa says before walking away.
"C-Cas." Dean groans, biting his lip from crying out loudly as Cas started to bob his head, taking Dean deeper each time.
Dean was in his room, sleeping on his stomach with his arms under his pillow. His headphones were on, and he was humming to "Heat of the Moment."
"Okay." Dean nods, kissing the top of his head. "I'll let you pick where to go and when to go. I'll never let anything bad happen. I'll be right here."
"Come on, Cas, let me hear you.” Dean growls, slowly continuing to push into Cas until he finally bottoms out. He leaned in for a deep kiss, his left hand gripping with Cas’ right, above the angel’s head, and the other hand continued running through the feathers, tugging on a few every so often.
Cas frowned. “That’s not healthy for him, he needs to sleep regularly. In fact, I’m going to go check on him and make sure he’s actually asleep. Thank you for making me aware of this Sam, his well being is very important to me.” Cas stood up and started to walk towards Dean’s room.
Dean slowly slid the sweatpants and boxers down and off, kissing Castiel's lips in the process. Dean then shifted, moving back down to face Cas' erection. Leaning in, he kissed his shaft before licking up the length of his cock with the flat of his tongue.
Cas runs over to them and helps Sam get off of Dean and then kneels next to Dean. He cupped Dean’s cheek and frowned. “Are you okay?”
Cas had just gotten back to the bunker after investigating another possible case. He was about to call Dean to check in when he heard the door to the bunker open. Walking into the bunker, Sam was leaning on Dean for support, since the crutches wouldn't help him down the stairs. Cas got up and walked over to them reaching to help support Sam and get him down the stairs.
Cas’ smirk grew wider and he continued to grind his hips down against Dean’s, starting to leave marks on Dean’s neck.
Dean nods again, standing up carefully before walking out of the room. His footsteps could be heard down the hallways, stopping in his room before continuing down.
Cas moaned louder, arching his back “oh fu- Dean ah! L-Love you s-so much- shit” Cas couldn't help the profanities that started to slip from his lips, Dean was just so damn good.
'Dude, this is a love song. Who're you trying to impress with this?' Dean had asked. Castiel frowned and walked away, not saying anything to the hunter.
“All that matters is that I know now that you love me as much as I love you. What happened before is in the past.”
"T-the price was my life- when I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me away forever." Castiel looks up from where he was looking at his hands and is startled.
Rolling his eyes to the back of his head, he leaned forward, kissing Cas roughly. Dean teased the smaller, fluffier feathers at the base of Cas' wings and it felt so good. He broke away from the kiss and panted into Cas' neck as he continued to thrust harder against the angel's prostate.
Cas continued grinding against him desperately, moaning out Dean’s name repeatedly as the pleasure overwhelmed him. He’d never felt anything like this and he never wanted it to stop.
"At least this time I won't flinch as much." Dean chuckles. "Besides, you don't see me complaining."
Cas bit his lip and tried to hold back the tears that were threatening to fall. “T-Thank you Dean” His voice broke as he spoke.
Dean nods, swallowing heavily as he grabs Cas' hips. He starts rubbing circles as he lines up with Cas.
Dean closes his eyes, not being able to hear Castiel's voice the same. Not after Castiel's confession.
"I was going to get a drink, but this is more important. You guys dance around each other like ballerinas."
Gabe looked at Cas and Dean and frowned, “Sam what did you walk in on? Because the Castiel I know wouldn’t be like this just because someone enters a room on a normal day.”
"Cas. That isn't your fault...." Dean says, his face portraying what he was thinking. "Here, I have an idea. Let's plan a date, and let everyone know where we are, how long we'll be gone, and that we aren't available. That way, if they need help, they can call Sam or another hunter. Alright?"
After a few hours Cas started to feel Dean wake up. Dean wraps his arms around Cas, kissing his forehead. "Hey."
Shaking his head to get the flour out of his hair, Dean grabs a couple of eggs, mashing them in his fists over Cas' head before smearing it on Cas' face.
Cas smiled softly and kissed Dean’s forehead, laying down beside Dean and gently pulling Dean down to lay with him. “And I love you too so much.”
“I love you too Dean, so much. I’ve wanted to tell you that since...r-really since I pulled you from hell but...I didn’t know how and you always seemed to prefer females a-and I’m in a male vessel and-“ Cas keeps rambling on, a little nervous still even though Dean clearly felt the same.
Cas smiled softly and stayed with him, holding him as he slept, feeling happy he could finally act on his feelings for Dean.
Cas blushed and grinned, nuzzling his face into Dean’s neck. He squirmed slightly, becoming aware of the mess in his pants.
“Castiel. Cas. Previous angel of the fucking Lord. I don’t wanna lose you. I want you to be safe, here in the bunker with me.” Dean smiles. “I-if you’ll have me.”
"Well, if you hadn't been here, I'd lose all courage in... telling you how I feel." Dean blushes, sitting on his bed.
“No!! I could never feel ashamed of saving you! I...I j-just struggle to ignore the verbal abuse from my siblings...they say I’m no longer one of them, that I-I’m not an angel anymore, that our father should never have brought me back to life...I could never be ashamed of you and I don’t regret saving you. I only wish my siblings would understand.”
Dean pulled him close, stroking his back between the wings. "Your welcome Cas." Dean's phone dinged on his nightstand, but he ignored it, placing kisses on Cas' temple and neck.
"Castiel." Dean growls, thrusting into the angel roughly. "I-I'm close." He moans loudly, moving his hands forward a bit, gripping onto him tighter.
Cas was practically a mess of moans, ranging from Dean’s name to begging for Dean to fuck him harder. He couldn’t think of anything but Dean, every touch, every sound, every taste. All of it Dean.
Cas nuzzled closer to Dean, trying his hardest to stop crying. Gabe, clearly confused, looked at Sam. “Is this true Sammy?”
“Sometimes. Other times I swim or just let myself float for a while. And sometimes I just sit here and enjoy how quiet it is.”
"Sounds relaxing." Dean hums, his stature visibly relaxed. “So what do you feel like doing.... cuz that lake looks pretty inviting."
"Oh fuck." Dean closes his eyes, moving his hand up and tugging on Cas' hair. "I-I'm not gonna last long-" Dean moans. "-if you keep doing that."
Sam walks back by the living room, surprised to see Cas sitting alone on the couch. "Uh, hey, Cas," Sam says, poking his head in. He had a glass of water in his hand, his eyes half-lidded as if half-asleep. "Where'd Dean go?"
"It is my fault, Cas. You trusted me with something, and I treated it as if a smile. I should have been more careful. I didn't know no one else could see it." Dean says, running a hand through Cas' hair.
Cas rubbed soothing circles on the back of Dean’s hand with his thumb “I’m sorry...is there anything I can do to help?”
"Wanna wash your own hair? Or for me too?" Dean asks, barely heard above the water. "Unless that's... too much..."
After a long and painful process, Cas had stitched Dean up and covered the stitches with gauze, apologizing the whole time.
"Your welcome, Cas." Dean smiles, opening the bathroom door after Cas was dressed. He takes Cas' hand, leading Cas back to his bed.
Dean hangs his head, his fists against the concrete floor, tears falling and leaving teardrops on the floor.
"But you came and got me from that Unholy Place. Do you feel ashamed for getting me from Hell?" Dean says, his hands hesitating on Cas' wings.
Dean groans. "Cassss." He smiles. "That isn't fun. Surprise me. I have a whole shelf of movies. Just pick a random one."
As the clock struck midnight a few hours later, the sound of the t.v. was still going. Dean sat in the t.v's light, the rest of the room dark. Several thoughts were running through his mind, but one kept coming back to punch him in the gut. He got Sam hurt. It was normal that they'd have scars or bruises after a hunt, but Sam broke his leg, and it was his fault. On top of that, he made Cas feel bad.
"Sam. Come on man, I know you can handle yourself. Next time, knock. Don't open the door." Dean growls. "Thanks for handling the Charlie situation, but there is no need to put the blame on us."
“Of course, I’m always careful.” Cas pulls out all the things he’ll need to stitch Dean up. “You’ll have to take your shirt off for me to do this.”
"Cas." Dean says, placing both hands on his forearms after turning and standing in front of him by the Impala. "You are funny, and yes, you are a bit awkward, but it makes you, you. And I don't think it's possible to find anyone better looking. Besides, that isn't why I love you-though it's a nice bonus- I love you for your bravery and patience. Your kindness and your willingness to tell me to shut the hell up. You don't have to like EVERYTHING I do, because you might like something different. I'll never leave you, Castiel. I promise." Dean smiles. "And if I were to leave, I'd be dragged away kicking and screaming. I love you, Cas. There isn't anyone or thing I love more."
One day, Cas is walking around the bunker when he hears some music. He recognizes the sound of the guitar, it comes from Dean’s room.
“What the hell are you talking about? You're leaving?” asks Dean, not believing in this. Cas couldn't just leave, right? But Cas nods to confirm his words. “And what about me?”
Every time Cas is in Dean’s room, he looks at the typewriter. He’s always wondering when Dean used it last time…
Dean and Sam talk about something, Cas doesn't hear them because he's not a celestial being anymore, but he's sure they're talking about him. Sam nods and walks away, leaving them alone. Maybe it's time when Dean will start yelling at him?
Dean takes another sip, waving his hand, but Sam doesn’t finish yet. It was just a matter of time when they need to talk, so why they wouldn’t do this now?
“I suppose the same reason as you…” Cas nods, and Dean does the same. It’s not the good time to say it loud, but maybe one day, they will be brave enough to speak their truth. “You should rest.”
“I'm afraid I don't understand,” says the confused angel, tilting his head a little and frowning. He looks like he really doesn't get it. Like he really hasn't idea what he did.
“It's not… I don't know what I want. I don't understand what it's mean. And I'm straight, of course,” explains Dean. His last words are a bullshit, he doesn't believe in it.
Dean isn’t sure what for he begs him. To abandon this subject? To forget about this? How the hell could he do that?
“Yes,” agrees Cas, and then he adds quickly: “But it wasn’t pleasant. He was trying to kill me… And I wasn’t attracted to him at all.”
“A pie?” asks Cas who thinks that he misunderstand something. He frowns, and it makes he looks even more adorable.
And when they're riding the Ferris Wheel, he closes his eyes, just to focus on this smell. During the steep downhill, Cas grabs Dean's elbow without a word and doesn't let it go till the end of the ride.
It's not the first time when Cas asks about it. And he does it with a concern, love… Why didn't Dean see this before?
When Cas is clean, Dean walks away from the bathroom again. He's back after Cas takes on pajama pants. The hot dog one. Cas doesn't know why Dean gave him his favorite pants, but he doesn't ask about it. Maybe it was the last clean pair?
“Thank you,” he says one more time this day. And he doesn't mean only the pictures, but all of this.
“Stop, Sammy, just stop,” he begs, closing his eyes for the moment. When he looks at Sam again, his brother speaks.
“I don't care! It's a half of the monster, and I'm not gonna wait to find out that he screws something up!” he yells, and after that they hear the baby’s cry. Jack is awake.
“Would you like it? To be a movie?” he asked, moving closer. Dean could feel his warm breath on his cheek. He gulped loudly, and closed his eyes for a moment, and after that turned his head to meet Cas’ eyes.
“It was six years ago, Cas... Were you planning to told me that some day? Or you just waited for a moment when you're dying?”
He’s still awake, the Shadow can’t sleep, and it makes them angry. But it still not easy to convinced them to release him. The Shadow can torture him for centuries before they’ll be bored. And Cas knows he doesn’t have so much time. He needs to come back.
Cas wants to walk away, but Dean grabs his wrist. His heart is pounding like a hammer, and he’s not sure what exactly he plans, but he knows he can’t let Cas go away.
Cas nodded, maybe it wasn't the best time to confess. Maybe he needed to be patient, he needed to wait.
“Sammy, it's not like sex with some dude makes me happy... Jeez!” shouts Dean, clenching his fist on the bottle. He doesn't want to talk about that.
Dean grins, but after that he clears his throat and ends a subject: “Yeah, maybe one day, but now I need my four hours.”
Cas turns to his books again. He doesn’t want to talk about this anymore. Maybe he was stupid when he decided to fall, but it’s still better to be a fallen angel than an obedient soldier. They’re reading in silence for a while, but eventually, Dean speaks again.
“Hey, it's okay. The best gift is your presence here. Shall we?” he asks, offering his arm. Cas gives him a little smile before touches his elbow.
Dean gives him fake laugh: “Telling about Jack? Are you kidding me? I can hardly look at the kid, I’m definitely not going to waste my time on talking about him.”
Dean isn’t sure why he does it, or no, he knows why he does it - because he wants it, he’s just not sure if it’s a good idea, but after Cas is focused on the picture again, he slides his hand into his. Cas seems to be surprised, but he grips it without any word and any hesitation. Their hands connect with each other like they were created for this, all the time.
“Umm, it's, you know…” Dean starts nervously, he can’t say anything else. But Bobby understands, he doesn’t need to ask again.
“I know, but I want to,” he interrupted him. Cas sat at the table and waited. Dean made a sandwich, cut the crust and served it to him with a smile. And Cas thought it was the best sandwich he has ever eaten.
more! It’s like Cas reads his minds because he cups his face gently and kisses his forehead again. Then, Cas traces with his lips Dean’s face; his eyelids, cheekbones, nose… And Dean doesn’t stop him, he allows for that kind of fondness.
“Who’s making me coffee?” mumbles Dean, after Jack wakes him up. It’s obvious that Cas goes to the kitchen and brings him a cup of coffee.
“It's not like you made it easy, buddy.” Dean was looking around, judging the house. “It's nice place. For a kid.”
“I’m not good at that, actually. Sonny taught me a few chords when I was a teenager, and I found the guitar in the basement a few weeks ago. I practice since then.”
It was Dean’s idea, to get to that very small and very old elevator in that even older building. Why? Because ‘
“Good. Very good.” Cas smiles the way only he can, shyly, with the corners of his mouth are up just a little. “I'm happy, Dean.”
“Thank you, Dean.” He took a few steps forward. “I need to feed him, now. Can we talk later? Give me, let me say, fifteen minutes?”
Deal with the Empty is simple. He needs to save Jack, he’s not thinking about consequences, at that moment. He just does it. Later, at night he’s wondering if he could be ever happy. Probably not. Because the one thing he wants, it’s something he knows he can’t have…
Dean comes back with a burrito, but Cas takes just two bites. Even if he's hungry, his throat doesn't let him eat.
At the end of the day, they lie on the bed again, kissing with the same fondness as all day. And after the last kiss, Dean is the first one who whispers “I love you”. Cas always answers the same.
“Because he's a dude who knows shit about anything from pop culture?” he answers his question with another question.
It's like Dean reads his mind because he suggests it by himself. “Okay, you need to rest, but first we're gonna take these dirty clothes off you. Can you walk alone, or do you need help?”
Cas gulps and clenches his fists. Sam sees this, and he wants to comfort him some way, but he isn't sure what to do.
to his best friend. He was pretending that it’s just to fix the shitty Cas’ taste of music, and he didn’t do a big deal with it, just he gave it to him in casually after one dinner. Maybe that’s why Cas thought that he needed to return this? Great he screwed up even that simple thing.
“It's okay Sam. I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation, and I'm gender fluid. The bond is the most important for me. And I know you're not homophobic at all,” he says.
Cas’ face turns pink, as an angel it has never happened to him. He wouldn’t have embarrassed because of that then, but as a newly human being, he feels different.
A visible mark, the handprint, is gone years ago, but Dean always feels some part of Cas in him, however weird it sounds, somewhere deep in his veins. It's like Cas shared with him his grace when he was saving him from Hell. Maybe, it's the reason, they had a more profound bond? Or maybe it's because…
Dean overcomes the distance between them in one step, wraps his hands around Cas' neck and press his lips to Cas'.
“Hi, Cas!” Dean grinned like nothing bad ever happened between them. It looks so similar to the smile he gave him when he worked at Gas 'n Sip as Steve. A smile full of sadness and guilt.
Dean asks Cas to buy some beers in the grocery. He wants to talk with Sam, so when door are closed, he starts: “What the hell is it supposed to mean? Why Cas…”
“Okay, you need to take off a tie,” commands Balthazar first. Cas does what he told him. He hides his tie in his pocket.
“Oh, I know, but it's Valentine's Day!” she explains like it's obvious, and now Dean is the one who frowns. First, Valentine's Day was a month ago, but maybe in romcom it's happening every day? And second, why they got only one piece of this delicious looking pie!? He understands when the waitress gives them two little spoons. “Today, every couple receives free pie! Isn't it wonderful?”
“So, you wanna talk about this or what? Some advice? Talk with Cas if you want something more,” Sam gasps. Why is he giving some shitty directions to his older brother who has never had problems with dating?
“Thank you, Dean.” Dean wants to walk away, but he stops him: “And you know what? You taught me this.”
Sam feels confused. Side effects? He has never... Yeah, he has never had side effects, but Dean in the other hand... Sam needs to be sure if he understood it correctly, he clears his throat before asking: “And what about Uriel?”
Cas can't sleep immediately, he's hearing slow Dean's breath and feels some weird sensation in his stomach. It's something new to him. He closes his eyes, trying to think only about his best friend next to him.
“Look, I know it's not the same. But it's the only thing I could find on my way,” he said, pulling a single blue flower from his pocket. “Forget-me-not for unforgettable angel.”
Cas comes to Dean’s room for the first time since he left the bunker. They are good now. Everything else is wrong, Chuck still pulls the strings, but at least, they’re okay. Dean is talking so much about Chuck, new plan and about missing Cas… His voice is soothing, and Cas feels more comfortable after some time. He looks around, eyeing much longer at the desk. There’s many crumpled papers, but one is still in the typewriter. It means Dean started writing something new recently. Cas doesn’t want to read it, but he does it involuntarily.
Dean turns on music because he's not ready to talk with Cas, he doesn't even want to hear Cas' voice. After a few minutes, he catches himself at peeking in the rearview mirror.
“Umm, really? You want to read some of my craps?” Dean seems to be surprised, and he doesn’t even realize that he confirmed these are poems indeed.
Dean swallows hard, the Adam’s apple lifts and lowers uneasy. There’s silence between them for the moment, Cas is the one who starts talking again.
One of his fear is that Cas is not gonna come back. Not because something bad happens, but because he doesn't want. Maybe, Cas could find happiness outside Dean's messed up world?
“Dean, I'm fine,” he interrupts him before Dean has time to become really worried. “I just wanted to wake up next to you.”
“You know it looks sexy, that's all,” chuckles Dean and shrugs. Cas bites his lip, still staring at the knee.
“I'm sorry, Cas,” says Sam. He has no idea what more he could do. He is sorry, of course he is. He lost one of his friend… But he needs to think about the child now. For Cas. For Kelly. And for mom.
“I’m here Jack, and I will never leave you again,” he whispers to the baby. And Dean hopes that this time it’s true.
And he stays, even if he knows it's awkward for Dean. But he can't help that he want to be close to him even when they're arguing, or whatever it is.
“Come on barbecue on next Sunday. I think Mary will find peanut butter and jam for you,” invites him John.
They kiss again, and fake-Dean goes away. Cas is standing there a few second more, still smiling, and then he moves to the kitchen.
“Come with me,” whispers Dean, not looking at him. He’s feeling he might chicken out if he sees these blue eyes now. Cas feels insecure, but he goes anyway without hesitation.
Dean walks, looking for any sign of civilizations. After a few hours he finds some shitty Gas-N-Sip. He’s so thirsty that he drinks all bottle of water, then he notices a big mirror. He comes closer and stares at his reflection a long minute. Is he has more masculine jaw? Maybe it’s just a trick of lights. He pulls the shirt up to see his chest. There are no scars. Not only those which he earned on the hunting trips, but also
Castiel is avoiding Dean all day, but he can't stop thinking about Jody's words. He feels bad that he didn't respect a request. He's looking upset, and Dean sees this when he catches him finally.
“Look at you! Mr 'I'm an Angel of the Lord and I don't serve people' is going to serve me a sandwich,” chuckles fake-Dean and grins.
“Stop being stubborn. You need stitches, and I can handle it!” Dean pulls a first aid kit and a bottle of whiskey from his bag. “Lie down.”
Dean tries reading news to find some case, it could help him to move on. If it is possible at all. There's nothing interesting for days, but after a week he reads about a few mysterious deaths. It looks like some ghost, easy 'salt and burn' thing. It's going to take him at most three days, and it's only because the place is eight hours far from Lebanon.
The image of Castiel’s wings, or rather of only a shadow alike to the trace after a nuclear bomb explosion, is the final proof that the angel is dead. Dean saw how Lucifer killed him, but he refuses believing in it first. It is easier, pretending that everything is fine and Cas is still alive.
Castiel, the angel with too much heart and too much faith in humanity and good things, is lying on the ground without any signs of life. His body…
Cas is staring at the mirror, but he doesn't move even one inch. He doesn't take his clothes off, he barely can think about anything. When Dean is back, Cas is still staying at the same place.
“Good. See you soon,” Dean interrupts him, he doesn't need worthless words how Sam is sorry. He doesn't care about 'sorry' and to be honest, he doesn't care about anything. Not anymore.
“Dean…” Just a name. It’s enough to say that he cares about him, but also not too much to embarrass him.
“Okay, I understand. I think it’s clear now,” he says, frowning like he is thinking about something really hard.
Dean takes off Jack’s diaper and cover him with nappy quickly, just in case. Fortunately, this time Jack decides not to pee at none of them.
“Jack is sleeping right now, and I think…” he stops for the moment, not sure how to say it. “Dean, Sam and I were talking about it earlier, and we think we can save Mary.”
“Dean!” Cas sits and wraps his arms around him, gripping him tight. He buries his face in the crook of his neck, they have never been so close to each other.
“Yeah... We can go together. As friends, I mean. You know, a friendly date,” explains Dean, finishing it awkwardly.
“I need something stronger,” he says, pointing to the beer and walks away. Cas follows him to the kitchen.
“I'm sorry, Cas, it wasn't on purpose. Let me help you with cleaning.” Dean squats and grabs the biggest piece of glass. “So... what were you doing?”
“Cas, about earlier. You need to know, I'd never do this again. And I mean it. I want you in the bunker. I would know that you're safe,” he explained, and Cas' heart skipped a bit.
“Everything is okay. I'm here, Dean,” he whispers, and pulls his lips to Dean's lip bottom. The kiss is soft and subtle as if Cas is scared he can hurt him. Maybe, it's because he still doesn't believe in his happiness, and he isn't sure how to behave.
Pain isn’t the worst, not the physical one. Cas can handle that, but seeing all this stuff, all of his mistakes and biggest regrets, makes that he’s done. He doesn’t want to see this anymore, he would do everything to get just five minutes of peace, five minutes without nightmares.
“I'm not angry,” he repeats. “I just realized something today, and I need to think about it. That's all.”
They sit at the counter and order two beers. While they're waiting for drinks, Dean is looking at some brunet from head to foot.
When he comes back to the kitchen fifteen minutes later, Dean finishes preparing a breakfast. Jack is lying in a baby seat on the table. They’re eating in uncomfortable silence, Dean is the first one, who speaks, after they finish their coffee and put dirty dishes into the sink.
“Okay, so kill him. Look at this baby and shoot it in its head,” says Sam slowly, seeing a hesitation in his brother’s behavior. He thinks it can be the best opportunity for them.
All of them are tired, Dean doesn’t even put a music on. They ride in the silence for a few hours before they’re in Lebanon again. Sam and Jack go inside, and Dean opens a trunk to take baggage. Cas waits for him.
“Hi, buddy, do you need something?” asked Dean, but Cas didn't say anything. He just tilted his head, trying to remind himself why he was there, actually.
Dean grabs his arm anyway, for the extra support. Cas hasn't been in the bunker many times earlier, so he's not sure where they're going. Dean guides him to the bathroom.
When he comes back to the bunker, he unpacks groceries in the kitchen, and after that he sneaks into Sam’s room, to put the plushie bee in the empty cradle. Even if Sam notices it, he doesn’t say anything.
“You can't sleep?” he asks immediately, when Mary stands in the door frame. His voice is deep like always, but also calmly and full of concern.
“Shh, Jack, it's okay.” Cas tried to calm the baby, after Jack was eating again, he looked at Dean. “I can't risk that one day you'll kick us out!”
Cas isn't a real angel anymore. He rebelled and ran away from Heaven. Now, the Earth and the Winchesters are his family. He needs them, maybe even more than they need him.
“I love you,” whispers Cas after they pulled away. He has an adorable dreamy smile on his face, and Dean thinks he has never seen this before. It looks like true happiness.
“It's not about him! But he was right, that I'm damaged!” he interrupts him a little too loud. He doesn’t want to fight, not now and not because of this.
Dean smiles and kisses him. It’s amazing he’s allowed to do this, being with Cas and loving him so much.
Jack tilts his head and looks at Dean like he just saw something interesting. It's just a short moment before he yawns again, but for Dean it's enough. It's enough to see Cas in him.
They’re not talking about this what happened in the bar for all week. Actually, they’re not talking too much at all. But one night they’re sitting in the kitchen together, Cas is reading one volume from Men of Letters Library, and Dean takes a subject.
It has been almost two months since Jack was born, but Dean goes to Cas' room for the first time. The door is creaking, he can smell a dust in the air, but the worst thing is that the room is so empty and quiet. He doesn't see any sign of living being, like nobody has ever lived there.
“Thank you, Dean, I love it! But I don't have anything for you. I didn't know that…” he says it upset. Balthazar didn't tell anything about gifts.
“I... You always have me, Cas.” Dean takes his hand in his own and squeezes it three times. “You always had me.”
” start the familiar voice. Dean’s heart skips the beat. It can’t be true, he prayed to Chuck, and he was ignored, it must be some trick, Cas can’t be back, right? And even if everything tells him somebody makes fun of him, he believes, he
Dean takes Cas to the amusement park, he has never been in one before, and he seems to be excited to see all these colorful lights and hear the music.
“Dammit, Cas!” shouts Dean and puts his cup on the worktop that he spills his coffee. He walks away, and Cas is even more confused.
Dean is thinking a lot about this, he has so many ambivalent feelings. He catches Cas at the night in the kitchen. Ex-angel is sitting on the chair with a glass of water and doesn't spot Dean at once.
Dean has a silly smile on his face, and he's looking at Cas through half-closed eyes. The angel, because he's a powerful angel again, is lying on him on the couch with his stupid, sexy trench coat, and he's kissing Dean's neck which is really pleasant.
"I've never been on a date,” Cas says it casually, still staring at the screen, but something in his voice shifted. Dean can hear sadness and craving, it's difference than five minutes ago when Cas was commenting the movie very excited.
Cas nods. Of course, it's just repaid, when Dean pays off the debt, he won't be owed him anything, and Cas will need to leave. How much time he has? A few days? Weeks? Maybe months?
“You're doing great job with the kid.” It sounded honest, and Cas almost believed that. Dean was smiling, looking at the kid, and there was no disgusted. Cas was prepared that Dean saw in Jack only son of Satan, but to his surprise, he saw just the baby.
“Yes,” says Cas. “I just want to inform you that I had sexual intercourse with Dean last night. Of course, it wasn't the first time.”
Dean takes the first beer, it's surprising that he starts so late that evening. He sits at the map table and opens a bottle. Before he relaxes, he hears Jack's cry from Sam's room. He doesn't react first, but after two long minutes, he gasps annoyed, puts beer away and goes to the noise source.
“Jeez, do you really need to take it everywhere with you?” he asks with a grimace like he saw something awful, not just a baby.
Dean looks at him, and he can't believe that he's really back. There's a gap between them, none of them move even one inch.
“He's dead because of you... But I forgive you. I forgive you, Jack. And I'll do everything to raise you for a good man because he believed in you. And I believed in him...” he whispers and gives the baby a little kiss on the forehead. He runs his fingers through a short Jack's hair, and he gets a cute smile in exchange. Dean takes a deep breath and tells a few more words: “I love you, Jack.”
Cas takes a deep breath and turns around. He looks into Dean's green eyes: “Dean... I love you. I love you, not the other version of you. Only you, just you. With every scar, with every memory, with every burden... It makes that you are you. And it makes that I fell in love with you.”
“You need to be careful because he can pee on you,” says Dean two hours later, when Cas for the first time is changing Jack’s diaper. Dean told him he can handle it, but Cas wanted to start helping at once, so he doesn’t argue.
“Are you freaking idiot?” yells woman at Cas, but after a second she reminds herself, that he's an agent, investigating the recent disappearances, so she adds quickly: “Sir!”
“Really?” he asks confused, making a few steps to Impala’s hood, then he sits there, pointing Cas place next to him. He waits as an angel sits either, and then continues: “So, did you kiss a guy before?”
Cas gave him Jack, who shifted a little, but didn't protest that some strange person was holding him now. He seemed to be interested of him, his little fist tried to reach Dean's chin.
“You're welcome... honey,” he smirks, and Cas smiles is even bigger now. “You know what, I think I could try your recipe some day.”
Dean frowned, but before he opened his mouth to ask about this, Cas give him an envelope. He opened it, and saw the weirdest valentine’s card he has ever seen. He chuckles, not understanding anything for this.
“Cas, we should to talk,” says Dean, and Cas jumps at the chair. He turns his head for the moment, but he isn't looking into Dean's eyes.
“It's about Jody. She asked me about something... A little favor, but I didn't do this, and now I feel guilty,” he explains, gasping.
Dean is also watching Cas' back, and the thing, which he sees, terrifies him. There are two big wounds, looking like somebody cut a skin from Cas' back. And Dean knows what it is. It's the place where Cas had his wings.
Dean can't bear a thought that he lost him again, not like this; in the middle of nowhere, killed by Lucifer. And for what? For protecting an abomination!
“You could sit here,” Cas says enthusiastically, pointing at one of the chairs. “In the morning, after fishing. I would bring you a blanket and coffee. Black without milk and sugar.”
At the end, he uses body mist which he bought last time in the perfumery. It smells like fresh sweet melon with a touch of violets.
“He… I mean, Freddie, he wasn't straight, you know that?” he asks, trying to make his voice casually. It’s no big deal, just the most normal talk between brothers.
“I-I… Yeah, I’ve seen worse things before. You’ll be fine, like I said, just a few stitches,” he mumbles, and opens a bottle of whiskey. He takes a long swig, and gives it to Cas, avoiding his eyes. Cas takes a bottle without a word and also drinks it.
“Cas, will you make me an honor and go there with me tonight?” asks Dean, and Cas nods enthusiastically. He looks like he wanted to ask the same.
Dean is staring on Jack for a while before he gets up from the floor. The kid looks so tranquil and innocent, he can't believe that he was seeing a monster in him once. It's just a baby, and Dean notices that Jack is more similar to Cas than Lucifer. And of course, to Kelly who was a good and loving mother, even if she couldn't look after him for long. She would be a wonderful mom, and Jack will be raised without her. And without Cas, his real father.
“You'll figure it out,” says Dean. “Look, I made you a breakfast. I didn't know what you prefer, so I made a little bit of everything… Sit.”
He didn't forget, he's just such an asshole. Cas clenches his fist, but doesn't say anything. Of course, only for five seconds...
“Coffee can be bitter for you, but you can use sugar then. And milk. I hope you don't have any intolerance,” he says, and Cas nods.
After their stomaches are full, they're going to the small roller coaster, which maybe isn't the best idea, but Dean hopes none of them is going to vomit. They take seats close to each other. Dean feels Cas scent, this time it's a little different from usual, more sweet. Dammit, it shouldn't be like this. Cas shouldn't smell so nice, and Dean definitely shouldn't smell him. It's not a freakin' flower! Not that Dean would smell a flower either.
He has penis. Real penis! And it looks so good, like in his dreams or maybe even better… Actually, Dean is not sure if he's not dreaming again. Maybe it some other form of torture created by Alastair? He gives him what he desires, only because he's going to take it back
“What the hell are you doing, Charlie?!” he yells, and then the girls pull away. Charlie jumps a little, and he sees terror on her face. “I'm gonna kill that bitch!”
“Jack. He looks like Cas. I know, it's weird 'cause Cas wasn't his real father, and I know it was just a vessel, but… Jack has his eyes, and I'm not talking about Jimmy's. It's the same gaze. Cas was staring at me like that all the time.”
“What do you mean?” asks Cas innocently, but he starts being stress out. He doesn’t want this conversation.
Cas shuts Dean’s mouth with a kiss. He puts his hands on his face, and kisses him softly and slowly. And Dean starts kissing him back.
he thought. “And, you know, we could control the kid, we don't need another Apocalypse.” Of course, it wasn't because he was worried, but because he didn't trust Jack.
? What the... And how should he do this? Peck on the cheek? Yeah, Jody does something like that when they meet.
“Of course,” says Cas, not happy that he needs to go to his room again. But maybe after Dean fall asleep, he can sneak here.
Dean wakes up on the couch in the bunker. He frowns his eyebrows, he expected to see Heaven, not so normal place. Everything looks the same; a table with a map, a telescope, books… Cas is dreaming about the bunker, and Dean feels a sting in his heart. He had kicked Cas out from this place before. From his home.
“Yes, Dean. I always appreciate your company,” he says, more gentle this time, and Dean sees something in his eyes. Sadness and loneliness.
“It's a baby! Do you understand? A baby, human baby!” he tries again. Dean is in mourning, but so is he. It doesn’t give him rights to kill a newborn only to cope with his grief!
Sam wraps her body up in the sheet, and starts packing the baby’s stuff in the Impala's trunk. He takes some clothes, formula and diapers. Then he comes back to Jack, who is sleeping again. He watches over him, waiting as Dean will be ready.
Cas takes a sugar and a little spoon. Dean clears his throat: “Look, Cas, I need to talk to you. Could you stop for the moment?”
Mary is changing Sam's diaper, meanwhile her older kid is sitting on bed, still in his green flower pyjamas.
Sam get out from the bed lazily, stretching his neck. He hasn't felt so rested for two last weeks. He should to make a bottle for a baby, but first he's going to check if everything is fine. When he comes closer to the cradle, he feels something awful in his guts.
After Cas comes from the Empty, Dean says his first ‘I love you’. But he feels it’s not enough. Not for his angel who sacrificed everything to save one
“I think everything is good. This Dean is more open to collaboration. We have a date, I think it's a date. But I'm not sure what I should to wear.”
Cas nods. He doesn't understand why Dean is talking so much. Why does he even bother to explain him everything? Why does he waste his time just for the words of comfort? But he admits that it feels good. Dean's voice calms him down a little, he's not so much terrified anymore.
Dean closes the door with free hand, the other one is still grabbing Cas’ arm. He seats the angel on his bed, wondering how to start this conversation. Cas looks around, and his eyes stops for the moment on the typewriter. He sees only a few pieces of paper. Dean notices what Cas is staring at, and he thinks he knows what he should say first.
He has his grace back, being useful again feels amazing. Being at home… No, no at home, just in the bunker, is even better. He’s on the Dean’s side, they are fighting together, they’re dealing with a Mark of Cain… And Cas does it again. He loses an entire army over one man.
“It's okay, Dean. It doesn't hurt so much…” Cas hisses, immediately he says the last word. He bites his cheek, hoping it helps him somehow handle the pain.
The second time, it happened in the kitchen. Cas walked there when Dean was pouring a cup of coffee.
The kid starts crying again, this time with a sound of truly despair. Dean pulls him closer to his chest: “Shh, little buddy. Why are you crying? Everything is okay. You had a bottle right away, you should to sleep now. Come on, go sleep, buddy.”
Dean is standing over Cas’ body for a long minute before he uncovers a sheet to look at him one more time. The view is even more painful than earlier. Now when all emotions calm down a little, Dean realizes that it's over indeed. Everything, what he's going to do now, doesn't matter anymore.
“If you say you're sorry once again, I'll break your nose,” he interrupts him. Too tough. Dammit! Why does Cas make everything so difficult?
“Dean, you don't even have straight legs,” chuckles Sam. “And I still remember when I found you in the motel room with that twins before you went to hell. I'm pretty sure, one of them was a guy.”
They start small-talk, Dean tells he has his own car service to sound legit. Fake Cas says that he works in the school for the bees. Dean has no idea if some kind of that shit even exist in real world, but it sounds so typical for
“No, c’mere.” Dean pulled him back in, burying his face in Castiel’s neck and breathing in deeply. Damn. Dean had been so busy, he didn’t even realize how much he’d missed just being able to hold Castiel until just now. And it had only been a day. “Sorry you had to spend the night.”
Ok. He could get used to sassy Dean if it came with this cuddly version, too. Castiel closed his eyes and fell asleep surprisingly fast.
Mildred chuckled, moving to stand closer to Castiel. “Meg hasn’t been up yet either,” she whispered. “So take your time, enjoy your day. I’ll bring you some sandwiches for lunch?”
Castiel nodded. He could still feel his grace thrumming through his veins. His connection to Heaven, faint thread that it had turned into, was still there. “Yes?” Maybe his connection with Dean had grown strong enough that his mind quieted along with Dean’s. He should look into it. But right now he’d rather watch Dean eat breakfast. He’d missed being around him and often wished Heaven could just be done with him for good.
But it didn’t help to dwell on What ifs, Castiel had learned that early on. He focused back on his documents and forged Meg’s signature on a few more of them. Losing the land would hurt, but Castiel could always start fresh somewhere else. Thankfully the cash flows were untraceable and his Swiss bank accounts were safe, too. And with Dean still working for the Feds, he should probably work on a whole new plan for their future together anyway. Dean’s superiors would never let him stay in a suspected cult, even after Meg was removed.
It worked better than he expected and Dean’s breathing evened out in no time. The poor boy really must have been exhausted. Castiel got as comfortable as he could while cuddling with Dean and listened to his even breathing until he could follow him into dreamland.
Dean picked up the carrot once more. “I don’t know what you mean,” he replied innocently, shoving the carrot between his lips, a little deeper than before, and twirling his tongue around it, holding Castiel’s gaze, before he finally bit off and started chewing.
“Do you think I’m a criminal? That I would hurt you over this?” Castiel pulled his hand back once more.
He had Dean sit to his right, a place usually reserved for Meg. But after the impertinent way she’d talked to him the day before, she deserved to be taken down a peg.
Castiel pulled back to look into Dean’s eyes. “Goodness, no.” He touched Dean’s cheek reverently. “You think I want to be a part of any of this? Stealing, drugs, brainwashing people to stay? This is a nightmare. Please tell me what I can do to help you end it.”
“No,” Dean quickly denied, all the comfort suddenly gone. ‘No open drinks’, his brain screamed at him. He realized Castiel was looking at him oddly, so he quickly amended, “Water? Please? A, uh, a bottle?”
Dean was starting to seriously consider a dip when something vaguely tentacle-like broke the surface a few meters away. It wasn’t close enough to reach him, but he still sat back and pulled his arm from the water, dragging Castiel back, as well.
Castiel frowned. “I never asked. Would’ve felt wrong, too.” The tea was his only privilege and that had been out of necessity.
Sighing and rolling his eyes, Dean deflated in his seat. “Look, I’m not super-sure, but I was probably sleeping in my bed, as well.”
Jimmy’s mouth snapped shut and he nodded, at least having the decency to look guilty. “This didn’t go like I’d planned.”
Castiel put on his own boxers, not bothering with a shirt and went in search of his phone. While Dean was still occupied, he sat down on his couch and did a little more research on eating disorders, quickly closing his browser when Dean came back out, hair still dry.
The next morning, Dean woke up feeling safe and happy. It took him a few seconds to realize he was even awake and not dreaming, because the feeling was so unusual. But then last night came back to him. Falling asleep in Castiel’s arms. Castiel watching him barf out his guts. Dean cringed, focussing on the happier memory of Castiel being a solid form behind him, keeping him anchored while he brushed his teeth before getting him back to bed.
Dean joined him and kissed his shoulder blade before wrapping his arms around him and peaking down at the blend Castiel was preparing from behind him, his chin placed on Castiel’s shoulder. “What are we having today?”
After Castiel had kicked the door closed, Dean emerged again, red faced. “Couldn’t find it,” he mumbled.
“Dean, about that hacker friend…” Cas pulled back a little but then shook his head. “Nevermind. I’m sure she did her best.”
“Pretty little boy with daddy issues all wrapped up in a bow for me to untangle,” he mused. “A present.”
Dean had started begging a while ago, but now his pleas got more desperate. “It’s ok, Dean,” Castiel assured him. “Come whenever you want.”
And then Castiel remembered why the name sounded so familiar. It’s where Dean’s recently captured crew members had been taken to stand trial. “Dean, that place should be crawling with Navy ships.”
“Yes,” Castiel replied, dropping his head to lean his forehead against Dean’s. He took a few deep breaths and then sat back again. “This is… stressing me out. You know what will help with that?”
She surprised him with a hug before she left and Castiel felt a warm glow in his chest at having made a friend. The feeling was immediately replaced by a block of ice when he remembered why he was here. She was working on a filthy pirate ship, probably telling Dean where to plunder next, and she’d end up on the gallows just like the rest of them.
After Dean had left, Castiel went back to his own room to freshen up as well. Then he wandered around his Farm, letting himself be seen by his followers until it was time for the mid-day meditation session, which he led. Followed by yoga, attended by those who could squeeze it into their schedule. He also led an evening yoga group.
“Who can sum up the allegory for us?” Castiel saw several actual hands as well as virtual hands go up. He opened his mouth to call out a name when suddenly the door to their bedroom opened and he was momentarily distracted. Usually Jimmy and Dean stayed out of his hair when he held his lessons, but now they joined him in the living room.
She nodded. “You think they’d get you for your… other activities?” In that regard, she knew a little more than Dean. She worked in IT support, but she wasn’t a coder. She definitely wasn’t a hacker, but she wasn’t stupid either. She could tell that most of the charities or causes she mentioned suddenly had spikes in their funding. They never talked about it, but he noticed she’s stopped mentioning them so much. Probably trying to keep him out of trouble.
When he slowed down and focused more on his surroundings, Dean realized that Mildred was currently walking around the main tables, offering refills on the community tea. This wasn’t that unusual, but so far, he hadn’t seen Mildred do it herself. By the time she reached Meg, Mildred suddenly stumbled and poured a lot of tea straight into her soup bowl.
Castiel held up his hands. “Alright, I’m sorry.” He got up. “Couldn’t resist.” He smirked and got another cup of coffee, placing it in front of Dean. “Peace offering.”
On Tuesday, Dean once again arrived without lunch. But before Castiel could make a comment, Dean handed him a credit card. “Could you please get me a sandwich later, Angel? Or whatever else you’re getting.”
He kept saying shit like that. And Dean meant it, too. He was way too good a person for Castiel to come and corrupt. “Have I told you lately, how happy I am that we met?”
“Fuck that,” Castiel tugged on his hand to keep moving. “I haven’t seen in you in two weeks. You can have a quicky in the car on the ride over to our hotel.”
A little while later, Castiel came into his office carrying a takeout box. Dean looked up at him and blinked, then his gaze fell to the clock on the wall and he winced. “Sorry, Angel. Please go home. I will try not to keep you here for too long.”
Castiel cocked his head, searching Dean’s face for a lie, but then decided he was capable enough of handling it himself either way. “You can charge my stuff on his card when he orders something else for today.”
Dean snorted. He couldn’t help it. It was ridiculous and also, if this led to them fucking each other? The irony.
“I’m sorry I’m such a mess,” Dean mumbled, curling in on himself as much as his position allowed him to. Castiel followed, molding his body to Dean’s in hopes of providing comfort. “I’m pathetic.”
“Trunk,” Sam replies, eyes unfocused. Eileen winces. Shit. She kisses his forehead and then finally gets up and tugs him along.
“Ok,” Castiel smiled. “And I should wear…?” He trailed off. “I just want you to be comfortable, Dean. So be honest.”
Dean is a little stunned. The hot guy who likes rodents is giving him his number first. And he wants to come over. “Uh, so… I get off in ten minutes if you wanna…”
“You don’t need an excuse for that,” Dean replied honestly. To his dismay, it made Castiel pull back though.
“For now.” She shrugged. “You’ll land on your feet.” She patted Castiel’s arm and then turned to leave. Before she opened the door, she turned around again. “But if you ever need anything, a place to stay, money, anything, you can call me. You know that, right?”
“Ok,” Dean repeated, smiling brightly. He was brimming with excitement and already thought about what to pack. Where would they go? Cas had never said.
Dean lowered his gun, but still kept it ready. “Novak.” His voice was harsh. “What are you doing here?”
“Alright. I didn’t forge those transport papers. But if I had, purely in theory…” Dean gave him a meaningful look. “I definitely thought they were smuggling in art. Not people. And if you found my prints on that document, then I’ve been set up.”
“Would you… would you still like me if…” Dean nibbled at his lower lip again. “If I were less… buff, you know?” He pulled the blanket tighter around himself. “More… twinky?”
Castiel handed over one half but Dean just looked at it. “I’m on a juice cleanse.” His stomach churned at the thought of solid food.
“Sit,” Castiel told him, putting the bags on the couch table and getting some cutlery and napkins from his kitchen.
“Of course,” Castiel replied. “Get some fresh air. If we’re lucky, we’ll see some cute critters along the way.”
“Ok, Ang… Mr. Novak. I’ll see you tomorrow?” Dean had phrased the last like an honest question and Castiel sighed.
“That wasn’t the name on his passport,” Jessica shrugged. “I think he chose Alfie? But I am honestly not sure. Sorry. And while I am incredibly sad that he died, I don’t see how I could help you with the investigation?”
“I do mean it though. You’re very smart. Just today, you came up with the dicta…” Cas didn’t get to finish his sentence because Dean shut him up with a kiss. Cas relaxed even further and Dean was able to coax him to lie down on the couch with him and make out.
“Am fine,” Dean waved him off, trying to sit up. Castiel helped him and moved him to lean against his desk. When he was sitting, he realized Castiel had placed his own jacket underneath Dean’s head. Dean poked at it. “Sorry.”
“You new?“ A girl in a very short leather skirt and an artfully ripped Fallen Angels shirt asked him.
Dean’s face fell and Castiel had to fight not to laugh. Dean would investigate regardless, he knew that. But like anything else, it would have to be his decision and his decision alone, lest he become suspicious of Castiel after all.
“Alright, fine.” Jimmy rolled his eyes and then shifted in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. Castiel was afraid he’d continue with the conversation they were skirting around, but instead he turned his laptop around. “Congratulations, you have a new account on the Cayman Islands.”
The alien smiled and said something in return. Dean sat up and knee walked to look up out of their shelter. Two suns up in the sky. They warmed the earth and Dean was grateful for it. Now that he was awake, he could feel how much the cold had crept into his bones the night before. He slid out and sat in the direct sun for a few minutes, joined by his alien companion.
Now it was Dean’s turn to raise his eyebrow. “Jess,” Sam continued. “You can tell me everything you know, and I’ll see if we can’t build a case.”
“You know Dean.” Sam replied in explanation, trailing off and Dean flushed again. He’d definitely gone off on a few rants about why the fuck they wasted money on charlatans and if Castiel’s bullcrap was even admissible in court. And he definitely did not also describe how irritatingly hot he was and that it messed with his head and otherwise Dean would have definitely solved those cases where Cas consulted on all by himself.
Since Dean’s ship had burned out and his suit seemed to have no tech, his people probably had no way to track him. And from what he could tell from the previous battles, back when he was still in a position to receive reports, the destroyers rarely launched rescue missions for scattered soldiers. But the Ceruleans might still end up killing them both, so… in for the long haul, it was.
Castiel blinked, able to snap out of his head. He took a deep breath and placed his hand on Dean’s arm. “Thank you, but I won’t know what I’ll find. Let me do this on my own. If I need help, I’ll get you.” He walked into the bathroom to clean up in the sink and Dean followed him.
Castiel reached down to fist his cock but Dean denied him and snatched his hand to join his other above his head. “No, Dean,” Castiel protested. “I need…”
” He leered. Dean tried to stifle his snort but he was still not smiling back. So Jimmy brought out the big guns as soon as the cupcake was in front of him. He swiped his finger through the frosting and then stuck it in his mouth, making a show of moaning while licking it off.
Dean cocked his head. This actually made it a little easier. Not because he didn’t trust Cas to stop anything if he said no, but this way he could keep an eye on Cas and make sure he was really ok with this. Because he didn’t want Cas to do anything he was uncomfortable with just because Dean was horny. “Yeah, ok,” he agreed.
Dean looked at him for a long minute, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth, seeming to contemplate something. His face changed to an apologetic mask and Castiel knew where this was going. “I can’t. If I don’t finish this spreadsheet, it’s gonna haunt me all weekend.”
Dean pouted, but accepted the sandwich, taking small bites and chewing slowly. Apparently that was the right thing to do, because Castiel relaxed and nodded at him.
Dean could even tell himself that he had to stay for his job. That quieted the voice inside that told him to flee down a little. After all, he wouldn’t quit his
None of them could blame alcohol because the party hadn’t even fully started yet. But each of them definitely drank a lot that night to avoid talking about it. Somehow, it did and didn’t work out. Because the next morning, Dean woke up with Cas in bed next to him. They were thankfully still mostly dressed, but their clothes were askew and their hair was standing up all over the place. They also each sported a bunch of hickies all along their necks. But Cas either also didn’t remember or he didn’t share.
“Alright,” Castiel commanded. “Now look up to your hands, Dean. Shoulders up, too.” He slid his own hands back down Dean’s arms to make sure he had built up some tension. “Yes, good.”
It took him five minutes to realize his own implication and he almost burned himself on his espresso maker, getting too close to the steam.
Dean did as instructed, nuzzling Castiel’s thighs and pushing in between his legs. When Cas opened his zipper, Dean looked up at him. “What about Jimmy?”
Dean nodded and they shared a sad look. Yeah. So much for their one day. But they’d soon get many more.
“You’re not,” Cas mumbled from against Dean’s skin, raising his head and blinking bleary eyes at his brother. “Stay?”
