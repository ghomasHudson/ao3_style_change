There followed a hissed hushing from the right again and several heads looked their way, fearful attention drawn. Steve’s sharp eyes roved down the row of bunks, but no one owned up to the sound, most preferring to ignore anything but their own misery now that it was silent again.
The door wasn’t locked, as if Bucky was expected. Maybe he was. Maybe it was a trap. But so be it if it was. Bucky pulled the door open and stepped inside, shutting it quickly behind him.
Jann stopped in the middle of her explanation as the man himself appeared at the end of the hall with the captain at his side. Both men paused in their walk, brief flickers of surprise passing over their expressions and Stefen wordlessly fished for the whistle in his pocket and raised it to his lips, signaling for Pepper.
Kroger, who had been sitting with his back against the wall near the kitchen door got up to follow him into the kitchen, still obsessively polishing his weapon.
Tony had made them translate this poem once, a new verse every three days. It was very long but Ian didn’t mind because he had trouble with English and needed the practice.
Tony thought he saw her shoulders tense, something opaque flashing in her eyes but she didn’t cringe at the rebuke.
Hands squeezed Steve’s face. A beast tried to claw its way out of his stomach, and he lurched to the side of his cot, spewing burning stomach acid onto the floor. The hands grabbed him, wrenched at his bones, turning him over. Something round and blunt was forced between his lips and he flailed, desperately fighting at the tube worming its way down his throat, choking him. The object was suddenly wrenched away flopping out of his mouth after one long tortuous pull. Steve gagged, dry heaving, nothing left in his stomach to come up.
After making sure that his grandfather’s leg wasn’t bothering him enough to inhibit him making it home on his own – Nonno flapped his hands and griped about being treated like an old man – Tony left him and took a cab to the one place in the city he had avoided until now. Home.
Bucky would wouldn’t he? He’d kept every woman who entered his life at arm's length. Even Larua. Especially Larua.
Steve had fallen asleep in his study again. This time at his desk. He'd lain his head down for one moment just to ease the pain and the next thing he knew he was being jerked from a light sleep by...banging? Thumping to be precise, just above his head. It was late, the household should be abed.
The medicine, once they’d hashed out the right balance, had helped to ease the congestion they could all hear in James lungs. For a few days he breathed easier and his coughing subdued, but then he caught a chill again and the wetness in his lungs returned, the coughing worsening with each day.
“It’s good to see you Péter, but I think at home we should drop the sir.” Natacha gave him an incredulous look but Steve went on. “And since we’re all together again… I guess that makes this home.”
Tony stood there, numb with shock as the words slowly repeated in his head still not making any sense. The Captain could not have asked him to attend the officer’s ball.
Willamina and Hortense were hard at work when the trio entered the kitchen, and they did not look all that surprised to see them.
“A party?” Coulson repeated. Tony nodded, already resigning himself to giving up the quiet Christmas he’d so longed for. But if it kept Stefen out of the thick of it and saved the world from what they now knew for certain was coming, so be it.
? What was he, a socialite? How about the fact that going with Stefen meant socializing with Nazi officers? That was all the reason in the world not to do this. He could just imagine what Farkas would say if he heard about it. He’d probably combust. He was supposed to be laying low.
She didn’t know what she was doing. Unspeakable things happened in wartime. He’d seen it up close. He’d stopped what he could and buried the memories of all that he couldn’t. She didn’t know. He’d hoped she’d never know. Control had slipped through his hands, that brutal enlightenment was coming toward them like a locomotive; but Steve would stand between her and it until he died.
At a much more relaxed pace Tony and the children biked along the country roads, their spirits lifted and for a time Tony thought that they were over the worst of it and had neatly avoided calamity.
“It’s yule time isn’t it? Did I ever tell you my father once tried to ban lighting candles during Christmas? He insisted we use electric lights for everything. Mama knew what he was trying to do of course. He was never good at the art of subtle. The man wore showy like a second skin.”
Tony’s words echoed inside of Steve’s head with every step he took away from Maria Santiago’s home. He made an effort to be careful, but if there really had been someone watching the house, it did not bode well for them. The voices in Steve’s head were overwhelming. So loud that he didn’t recognize the sound of a blaring horn until the headlights of the oncoming automobile were blinding his eyes.
Tony didn’t sleep, couldn’t sleep, but with silence in the truck and nothing to see outside his thoughts carried him away, streaming together to form a consistent hum like that of an engine. A hum that filled his head and drove everything else out, until Bucky reached toward the dash and switched off the headlights, plunging them into darkness.
“Maybe you’re right. For a child. But not for me.” Stefen replied, and damn him for looking so earnest about it as he leaned all the closer, their noses nearly touching now. “I’ll carry you to your bed every night, spoon feed you even. If that’s what it takes.”
Péter’s memory flashed to the film they’d been taken to see, all about why ethnic Germans had to cleanse themselves of inferior races and how the Reich was making bold strides for all of them. His stomach cramped.
As if coming up from water the sound of Peggy's piano floated through the air and a shiver ran down Steve's spine. How long had Tony been playing he wondered. He should have heard it. What was wrong with him?  Fear spiked through him, hot and tangy. Bucky was right. He was too distracted when he needed to be sharp and focused. He had to clear his mind.
"It is, because Cardinal Rossi is coming to personally oversee their release and to collect Bruce from his assignment. Bruce is meant to journey with him to Rome to give a full report."
He waited in the stiff silence for her reply, sure that it would be something sharp. She’d not taken well to his lecture the other morning about Frau Neumann and the reckless way she’d put herself and her family at risk. He was here because it was her choice, and Susann had watched a fair amount of choices be denied her already. He understood that too well, but he still did not want to see her get hurt.
Father mustered up a smile for them to match the warm and tender quality of his tone. He didn’t sound at all like himself anymore. More like he was before mother died, back when he was just Da.
At the sound of Stark’s voice Steve shook his head and straightened his spine, gathering himself. He managed a feeble smile.
“Smarter,” Tony conceded with a conspirator’s wink. “He was the only teacher at that school who ever challenged me. I thought he was a genius.”
"But the dream was snatched away and then what? You just decided it was better we were done altogether?"
But Steve glanced around and saw that they were parked on the side of a country road, hills on either side, no sign of town anywhere near and he blinked gummy eyes at Magda in confusion.
"Stark! That's not the way to - Stark!" Péter heard the monk shouting after them but Tony didn't slow down and neither did he. Their footsteps were loud on the stones that made up the abbey cloister and echoed as they darted under an archway and into a shadowed path leading to a newer looking addition. This portion of the building was made of clean white stone and had a bright red roof. Tony led them to a smaller wooden door, which didn’t budge an inch when he pulled the handle.
Dvorak met Schmidt’s steely eyes and imagined placing his hands around the pale column of his throat and squeezing.
If they had lived closer to the village, groups of carolers would have come by throughout the morning on their way to see the giant tree set up in the center of the square. This close to the mountains it was quiet as a tomb, but to Steve's mind no less beautiful for it. It seemed like just yesterday he and Peggy had driven out here for the first time. He’d parked the car not far from where the drive was now, and they’d walked toward the lake ringed with trees at the foot of the blue mountains. He’d spread his arms out and said,
He was such a baby to be scared like this. But he’d always had Peter before. When Baka died, and then Mama… when Da became a stranger and looked at them like he hardly recognized them, Peter was still there. Coming up with schemes to torture their governesses and get their father’s attention and bossing them around but never leaving them alone.
He meant to tell her it was too early to be up, send them both back to bed – there was no time to comfort them when their father’s life hung in the balance - but the words died on his tongue as he took in the horror in her eyes as she stared at her father’s wasted form on the bed, the ragged weariness weighing down her shoulders as she turned those tear filled eyes toward him.
“These men say they are with you Cardinal, but they don’t have papers.” The soldier at the gate explained, eyes flickering between Tony and the collection of robed men with bowed heads.
Looking at them, Tony just thought they looked poor and hungry. To them, this feast of tents lights and banners must have felt like reaching paradise. Well worth feeding the crowd whatever story it was they wanted to hear.
It struck him again, how different things might have been if Hughard had not intervened. He and Stefen might have met on a battlefield, across the barrels of guns. They might have killed one another or they might simply have passed like ships in the night, never to wonder what might be behind the eyes of the enemy they’d left fallen in the wake of their ambitions.
“It is no wonder the man drinks,” he murmured and Tony could not tell whether she halted so quickly because they’d reach the door of the room that was apparently to be his or because of his assumption but she turned to him with an arched brow and an expression of polite inquiry that did nothing to belay the underlining command in her tone as she asked him who he meant. Since his foot was already in it Tony decided on the direct approach. Frau Hogan had responded to it well thus far
Wanda paused to make a funny face and startled a laugh out of Péter, who was amazed to see the girls mouth stretch in the closest thing he'd seen to a smile in all the time she’d been with them. Smiling she continued.
“Go home Cate. Straight home. Natacha, come here.” He stood glaring at Natacha until she got the message.
“Across the lake. You’ve got people boats. I’ve been teaching them about the local wildlife.” Tony explained with an expressive wave of his fork. “An appreciation and mastery of nature is essential in a robust German didn’t you know? It’s stamped all over the curriculum. We could expand that lesson by going on a hike. Perhaps even camping outdoors! And as a treat they could race their boats on the lake. But only after the educational portion of course.”
Steve bristled, an old anger beginning to simmer in his gut as he and Bucky stared off, neither one willing to back down.
Dvořák’s lip curled as a swell of dislike shot through him. The goulash rat’s literacy was still positively insulting as far as he was concerned. Golden example of Aryan supremacy indeed. Oh, he could lead a platoon or two, could charge his pretty ass into battle with the boldness of a lion. And perhaps that was the most duplicitous thing about Rogers. Because Dvořák was certain he was a lesser breed entirely.
Hands grabbed at him. Too many hands. One pair, around his neck and pushing at his face - dear god, his neck was going to snap from the force of it - another pair grasping for purchase. The second pair grappled and pulled, dragging Tony roughly out from under Stefen. The minute he was free he was dropped unceremoniously and his rescuer lunged forward, grasping Stefen by the shoulders. In the fractured darkness Tony could make out Herr Bakhuizen form bracing against Stefen’s.
That whole ruining clothes thing had to stop. He'd be damn if he was fishing out clothes from the drains because they were too afraid to show they had dirtied them.
She’d looked wan, like she expected Rogers to appear over her shoulder any minute and start yelling the house down, and then furious. Through tight lips she’d informed him that breakfast had come and gone, and that the captain departing soon would expect Tony and the children to be out front to see him off. Shouldn’t he make haste if he was going to make himself presentable?
She handed them over without a word, her eyes falling on James who was curled up in her arms, and silently stroking his back.
“Major Rogers, I’d like you to meet Chief Researcher of the Ahnenerbe, Herr Dr. Anton Vonkov,” Göring had crowed, gesturing to the tall mustached man at his side whose physic belonged more to a wrestler in Steve’s opinion than to a researcher.
"What are you doing in my house?" Stefen demanded with an impatient air and the girl blanched, pleading eyes flying to the Baroness. To her credit Charlotte did not leave the poor girls to face Stefen’s temper alone. She moved to their side, gently taking one trembling girl’s elbow in a gesture of reassurance as she looked back at Stefen.
“I don’t think you’re stupid Tony.” Stefen refuted calmly, but his calmness just seemed to agitate Tony all the more.
“To know what?!” He demanded slightly panicked, his voice sounding weak and nervous even to his own ears.
“Get your things, we’re leaving as soon as I finish with my bags”  Steve instructed, though in truth all he wanted was find his way to his bed.
On some level Steve knew he was far from alright, but he couldn’t think about that anymore. He was shards, held together by sheer will, and he was very tired. So tired he could shatter into a million noncollectable pieces.
The Rogers family make their escape across the mountains. It does not go well. This is not that silly musical they made that ignored everything
The words reverberated in time to the crunching of his footsteps. Salzburg’s streets were still covered in glass. Every step seemed to mock him.
“It would keep my mother at bay.” Her laugh was strained with little joy behind it. Her eyes skidding past him to someplace over his shoulder. “She’s so adamant to know when we’ll have children of our own, not that I think she thinks less of your children.“
Against gritted teeth he added, trying to smooth his voice, “Peter still has trouble with his heart. It’s easily overlooked when he’s so energetic but it’s a fact that I cannot forget easily, seeing as I’m his father and all. The school in Geneva is better suited to Peter. It'll help him become everything he needs to be to better himself, better his people. It’s a better match than officers school. I weighed the options carefully General. Don't think I didn't. Or that I'll be swayed.”
But almost as soon as he’d thought it the stillness erupted as a set of doors burst open just up ahead and a woman with bright red hair in a sensible bun came charging into the room. Judging by her plain clothes and the set of keys clinking ominously at her waist this was the housekeeper. Only, Dvorak thought he’d seen less threatening expressions on seasoned generals as she intercepted them, asking quite plainly and forcefully who they were and why they were there.
When he would try to recall the moment, the only thing Steve would remember with clarity would be the way the news hit him, like a physical blow.
Worried that she would injure herself Tony grabbed for her, attempting to make her be still, but though he had the advantage in size and weight the girls hysteria seemed to give her an uncanny strength as she bucked beneath him.
Stefen and Peggy had always presented such a united front to the world that had rejected their union. It had put stars in Charlottes eyes, spoiled her for the politely contemptuous union her parents shared. She’d always said she’d never marry for anything less than love.
“You’re wanted in the interrogation room Herr Stark. Go promptly.” Steven’s looked back at Tony with what was becoming a familiarly stern expression.
“Having just come from Italy, perhaps you can explain it then, how it is that so many other great civilizations have thrived, often times over taking our own. Rome and her Italic allies for example.”
His whole body tightened his mind snapping clear with the threat of danger and becoming singularly focused. The enemy had come. The faces of a thousand monsters replaced those of his children. Doctors with gleaming eyes, grinning guards. Schmidt. They’d kill him, but not if he killed them first. He would rip their flesh clean off their bones, until there was nothing left. He’d survive. The footsteps came closer and he tightened his fists, tensing in preparation. He’d kill. He’d survive. He’d save them. He’d promised.
The sounds he’d make. Because Tony wouldn’t just let Steve have it easy like that. He’d nip and bite and leave blood blossoms all over Steve’s skin, make his mark. And Steve would get a handle on his neck, his shoulder, and give it all back. There’d be bruises for day’s hidden underneath Tony’s shirt collar. Steve would know they were there every time their eyes met.
It seemed somebody else had the same thought, or maybe enough people had complained, because not a breath later a police officer blew sharply on his whistle and began to holler.
"Protecting myself." Stefen admitted with far less fight than Tony had expected. "It wasn’t right, I know that. It’s just, I can’t let you walk away."
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Stefen finally asked, his voice a desperate rasping sound that echoed up the empty stairwell. A stupid question with an obvious answer, what with the distance between them, that Tony didn’t dignify with an answer.
which means ‘not rom’, and they expelled her from the familia. Her father Ian refused to leave her, because she was his last living blood and for rom to travel alone means death. Other rom will know you have been exiled and shun you, and the true gadje will continue to shun you as they always have.
Steve pulled the car around to the garage when they pulled in, because there was no reason for leaving it in the front besides making more work for Harold, and even though Bucky teased him for going through the trouble of employing a chauffeur and going out of his way to lessen his workload, it was a habit that Steve had never been able to break. Bucky had never had a problem enjoying luxury once it had started coming their way, but Steve had never gotten comfortable being waited on.
“Lay back darling.” Tony panted and just in case Steve was too far gone to hear it he tugged gently on his hair, pulling his head down toward the bed. Steve went, slow and easy Tony’s cock sliding out of his mouth until just the tip lingered there. Tony slid his hand out from under Steve’s head before he could pin it to the bed, and pet his hand over his sweaty brow, massaging his scalp in reward. Steve’s unfairly long golden lashes lowered to half-mast like he might fall asleep, but Tony bucked his hips when Steve curled his tongue around the head in a slow motion as if he were examining the texture. Steve just lay there, taking what Tony gave him, his gaze hazy and warm with a devastating amount of gratitude.
with. Tony lumbered out of bed, nudging Artur awake (who was sprawled out like a starfish in the middle of the bed, one arm thrown over Maria) as he went.  If he did so with a scowl, it was only because he’d never been much of a morning person to begin with and he was dog tired on top of it.
But not everything was about the finish line and Steve’s will was iron, his hand insistent where it lay in bold request on Tony’s flesh.
The barn door opened letting in a sliver of wintery light before the woman slipped in. Releasing his breath slowly in relief, Steve sat up, his protesting the change in position. Patroche wiggled out from under his arm and went to go greet his master. The loss of the little animal’s warmth ached, and Steve let his fingers trail along the springy hair on Patroche’s back until the last possible moment.
The stars came out over his head and Steve ran under them, his heart pounding away, his pack shifting precariously on his back. His legs burned but in a distant way, as if they didn't belong to him.
There were so many things his team could do with a working two way radio. Smuggling them away from the military always came with risks he'd be happy for the men in his network not to have to take.
To say that Tony had questions about the contradiction in the captain’s words or the strange circumstances that had led to the arrival of their guests was an understatement, but Stefen's tone did not invite further inquiry and challenging him in the front hall in front of his staff was no sound strategy.
"I know, but just for a little while. He can go back to school after, can't he?" he reasoned with the logic of the child he was, and Tony found himself smiling despite how sad he was to disappoint him.
Gibberish? Tony thought, before cold realization sunk in.  He’d been praying. Praying out loud in Hebrew where anyone could hear, in the middle of a Nazi prison camp.
to be caught. Pray that doesn’t happen. Pray you never see the camps.” Stefen slowly lifted his head and looked back at Tony, sending a chill over his skin. Stefen finished with bite, “And yes, Tony, I want to defend my friend and his people. I won’t deny that.”
Steve tucked his face into the collar of the striped shirt he wore and shuddered, shame and misery curling tightly inside him like smoke.
“Yes.” Tony was good with working under pressure. He was also good with getting his way. “Who should I consult with regarding your schedule? I want to be sure to leave time for them to spend with their father.”
But whatever Ian would have confessed Péter didn't let him finish, pushing back his chair with a violent scrape against the floor as he stood up to growl.
“It’s not a good idea,” the man grunted. “Peggy taught him to read on that thing. He wouldn’t want the kids to damage it.”
“But… but they were abducted? How -” she faltered, staring at him in confusion. He saw the dread wash over her face, the moment she realized.
She didn’t answer him. After a long moment of silence, she broke into a run up the stairs as if the very hounds of hell were after her. He knew his words had landed and he was happy just giving the girl something to think about. It was not her responsibility to know what to do in times like these, or to assure the wellbeing of those she loved. That was a job for the adults, for her father, and it was time someone brought that to the man’s attention.
Tony swallowed through the tightness in his throat, heart drumming loudly in the silence of the attic. Sitting over on a closed trunk Péter watched him, an uncanny stillness in his posture as they both breathed shallowly into the silence. Waiting.  Tony didn’t expect an answer but he hoped they’d heard. He hoped they told the world, and the bastards finally began to understand what they’d done with their silence as Hitler took power in Germany.
“A physics journal.” Tony grunted, blowing on a spoonful of soup. He’d been right, it was potato. “It’s rubbish though. They’ve completely omitted Einstein.”
It was near twenty minutes more for the man and his wife to finish in the room below, pack up their supplies and leave. The engine of their truck roared loudly in the otherwise silent air. Its progress could be heard out of the yard and down the trail until it reached the road.
James had almost drifted off to sleep slumped against Artur when the train began to slow and the man came through, warning the passengers that they we approaching  Worgl Bahnof. Natacha got up first, and Péter helped her shake the others awake. Snakes squirmed around in the pit of James stomach as he watched the town come into view outside the window, sweat breaking out over his palms. What if they got off the train and no one was there? What if they really were on their own now?
But she wasn’t five again, and her uncle Bucky’s body was trembling against hers as he dropped tears into her hair.
I'll be sending her Dear John letters (roommate style) while she's away, including your comments (because she says they are her life blood). No pressure but if you feel like wishing her well, I'm sure it would cheer her up after what are no doubt going to be some pretty long days.
“Tacha, Ian…. listen to Charlotte and keep an eye on your brothers and sisters.” he heard himself say, astonishingly calm sounding in a way he no way felt. “Don’t leave this room.”
Steve stepped forward, “Whatever you've discussed with Reiner about my children, I am their father and I've s-
Harry was waiting just under their favorite climbing tree, just as he always did when he delivered a telegram to the house although this was the first time Péter had seen him in the uniform of Hitler’s Youth. His slicked hair and the crisp brown shirt of the
"Or turn us in." Justice grumbled, and Péter noticed that he'd moved in front of Firestar somewhat protectively. "I told you it was crazy to bring him here!"
“Sweets!” Artur demanded with a hungry gleam and Tony shuddered to think it but nodded just the same.
So it had been what four, five years maybe? Tony’s mind quickly did the math. James might only have been three or four the last time he got in the water and Ian not much older than James was now. Seven or eight.
“Of course! It'll give me a chance to say goodbye to the dwarves. Willamina baked a few berliners for me to take with, I thought I might give them some, bribe them into writing me.”
Pavlok sighed, fishing for more paperwork for Tony to review, which upon finding he slid toward the younger man.
“What’s he saying?” Captain Altera snapped impatiently, his moustache twitching with each movement of his lips. When Steve repeated what the man had told him Altera huffed, sneering, “Is that what happened, they came to blows and our friend here decided to get his revenge?”
“On whether or not you’re going to be honest with me. Were you alone during this late night walk in the garden?”
“Take him please.” Stefen’s voice said next to his ear and Tony jumped, blinking in surprise as James was dropped into his arms. They looked at each other, both a little confused before Stefen said, with head cocking to the side. “Or you could put some real effort in and learn to swim.”
They lay like that until Stefen’s body made other demands of them, and sadly not the pleasant kind he was certain they both missed. Tony helped Stefen limp to the washroom and back to the bed and prop himself up slumped against the headboard and set about cleaning up the super ware. Tony wanted to stay. He was very good at coming up with a million and one reasons to do so, and to ignore the part of him that insisted on reminding him how damn unhealthy it was to feel a sense of panic every time you left someone’s side. He should go. There was plenty of work to be done. Helping Péter for one in the workshop turned laboratory. It was a lot of pressure to put on the boy’s shoulders, making sure the formula for the binding agent was mixed correctly. By rights it should be Péter here, propping Stefen up and offering comfort. Just because Stefen refused to allow his children to see him this way and bear the brunt of his journey to recovery didn’t mean Tony shouldn’t be in the workshop more. His hands shouldn’t shake at the thought of leaving the captain alone for five minutes.
"She picked it out for herself," he replied simply, looking away with a kind of bashfulness that made Steve want to lean down and kiss the cold off his mouth. With the sight of Natacha happy, the feel of Sara's feet kicking happily against his chest, it was the one thing that would have made a near perfect morning perfect; but Steve settled for a smile as Natacha's voice rang through the crisp December air.
Bucky glared at him, waiting, as Kurt Dobas appeared again and placed a plate of Bucky’s favorite strudel on the table and backed away, before he continued.
“Please, Stefen. It’s simple math. Even if I couldn’t determine the amount of force needed I could do this in my sleep.”
And just like that Tony snapped back to the moment, driven by the realization that he couldn’t give in to the panic or the fear because he had seven young charges to look after, seven children, whose father he’d given a promise, that he would protect them with everything he had – seven children who were being groomed to behave just as monstrously as these cowardly youths, but whom were still children, and they were terrified.
He talked about the man as if he were the nanny, the governess, and everything else besides where the children were concerned, and even though any other man in Stark’s station would have been utterly insulted by that treatment, she’d witnessed how happy he was to comply when Stefen did the asking.
Admiral Erhard’s office was much like any other. A large square room with windows facing the dockside, dressed with solid masculine furnishings. Figuring out which one was Erhard was as simple as looking for the one sitting in the big chair behind the large oak desk, but Tony hardly spared a thought for the décor or the admiral once he’d caught sight of his guests, or rather one guest in particular.
The doctor had the syringe in hand again and was clearly meaning to administer the drug, whatever it might be, but the housekeeper had somehow managed to wedge herself halfway between Fischer and the bed, one hand gripping the doctor's arm and the other thrown over her employer. Fischer looked as if he might strike her out of the way any moment.
"Those aren’t in the book because they are waiting for me to discover.” Artur pointed out in a long suffering way. “But I probably won’t find all of them right away, cause they’re all over the world. It might take me all year. Right Tony?"
Quickly he scurried inside the study and shut the door behind him, an elated grin briefly taking over his expression. If Tony had hoped that in his hurry the Captain would leave something to chance he was disappointed. Stefen’s office was sparser than he’d ever seen it, the folders and papers that had once littered the top of the desk neatly filed away perhaps in the desk drawers or in the small bureau beside it. There wasn’t even a book out of place, as what few there were, were stacked neatly upon the shelf on the right wall adjacent to the couch. There were no trinkets and baubles hanging about either. If not for the paintings on the walls with their rich colors and lively scenery, the place would look as if no one had ever really occupied it.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a look of nostalgia on you Cap.” Tony’s breath was warm tickling Stefen’s ear and his lips twisted into self-depreciating half smile.
Tony, realizing the vein his thoughts had taken, Tony tightened his hands into fists and turned resolutely away from the window as the cab pulled up outside the naval office. What did it matter to him how the Stark Yards had fallen behind? There was not a thing he could do about it.
He cleared his throat, a little startled by the force of his aggression and took a breath, trying to settle his frayed nerves before starting again.
Steve cocked his head at the files, frowning down at the colorful lines drawn upon the large map of the city and the surrounding county. It was more than ambitious, it was preposterous. Triple the amount of patrols, double the size of the intelligence office, and all of it was to be achieved by granting school boys the same function as SS officers. It was mad. But Steve doubted he’d be able to dissuade the Mayor from this plan. Olasz wasn’t wrong. Many boys were sure to join the Patrol once they heard what status it would give them.
"A few weeks I think..." he began but the look on Tony's face made him falter. It betrayed neither the anger he might have expected or even the disappointment he'd so often threaded into the wording of his letters.
It was past time to get the children to theirs, but the thought seemed far from anyone’s mind besides his. He was uncomfortably reminded of being five. Waiting at some table or tucked away in some corner alone while one of his parent’s parties dragged on and on, for someone to remember he was there and still needed assistance getting out of his clothes.
He’d snorted through his tears but couldn't get enough breath through his laughter to tell Bruce that what he sang in his accented german was not in fact a lullaby for a child but a love song for the lovesick.
“The Gestapo don’t ever need to know that he was here. We’ll be safe. He’ll be safe. It’ll be alright.”
“Ian.” Tony’s hands remembered gentleness as he touched Ian’s shoulder, and Ian looked at him eyes swimming. “Tacha really does need you. I’ll look out for your father.”
“No. If father wants me to listen to him then he should stay and...and” James sputtered to a halt, his brow crunching together in explosive frustration as he failed to find the words for just what he thought it was their father should do.
“Péter, let me worry about the HJ.” If Péter caught the trepidation in Steve’s voice he didn't show it. He bit his lip, looking away with a pensive expression and Steve wondered why he was still fighting it when it was so clear that he wanted to go.
Ian rushed past Tony like a bullet to get to his sister, Péter not far behind, both boys kneeling down and brushing off her the smear of mud running up her pinafore. Artur watched fearfully from where he sat behind James, his fingers crammed in his mouth.
“What’s the matter Tony? Afraid you can’t hit that little bell?” Steve teased and Tony huffed, rolling his eyes.
"I'll ride in the car with you and the children." He decided, and the Baroness looked at him her gratefulness evident in the shine of her eye and the way she slowly released her death grip on her purse.  Belatedly Deiter looked to his captain who was thankfully nodding his approval. "Perhaps that's best. We can't be too careful."
“Tony -” Péter began, but he was cut off by Natacha suddenly flying at them, her fists flailing, her blue eyes hot with fury as she clawed at him.
“Did I? Well they are also half their mother, but if I’ve got that story right she was a polished lady who became a war nurse while all her friends were at home clutching their pearls. The kind of woman who has the audacity to find the grubbiest, most ill-bred, of noble fools in His Majesties army and then marry the man against her families wishes, doesn’t sound likely to put up with towers either.” Tony glanced sideways at Stefen, still unsure about bringing up his late wife but other than a minor tensing of his shoulders the captain did not react. His lips did turn upward in a small hint of a smile, though it seemed sad to Tony.
“It does. If they are to see their plans for lebensraum through you’re in their way, Thor.” Steve responded with equal gravity and the prince’s shoulders tightened, a dangerous expression, akin to clouds gathering before a storm, crossed his face.
Stefen’s gaze narrowed on his mouth, and Tony’s grin widened, his heart beginning to pound in his chest.
The skin beneath his palm where Stefen still held Tony’s wrist seemed to burn as Tony reached with his free hand to cradle Stefen’s forearm in a silent summons. Slowly, clouded blue eyes refocused on him, darkening as the seconds passed with unmistakable desire.
He thought about kissing Tony enough and had never slipped like that before. He knew what he wanted and accepted that he couldn’t have it… but there was an insistent, deeply selfish, part of him that balked at the idea of giving up their budding friendship even at the risk of upsetting his plans.
“I can swim naked!” Artur shrieked, his eyes wide and glowing with excitement. The smaller children shuffled together giggling.
“What happened to waiting for Stark to be out of the line of fire?” he asked, and from the dirt Stark looked up, glaring accusingly at him with bleary eyes. Bucky shrugged.
Because they should have fun. They should be children, no matter what else the world wished to make of them. Tony needed to remember that now more than ever.
“I suspect you might already know- ”, she began, licking her dry lips. “I’ve something I need to tell you.”
Bucky shaved as Steve washed, dressed and comprised a telegram for Charlotte asking about a late dinner. He owed her a nice evening after last nights disaster. Stark was still waiting on a reply to his last couple of letters no doubt, so Steve began to put one together. Bucky was pulling on his undershirt when a young maid knocked on the door. She peered inside, the tray of coffee and breakfast food wobbling dangerously as she openly stared at Steve.
Natacha managed a few sleepy blinks before her mind jutted to life. She’d slept through father checking on her. The thought was disconcerting. She was always awake to see him.
She did not understand how Stark had integrated himself into the Captain’s life so quickly, or why Stefen should demand that she agree to employ the man until the children were grown in the event of his absence. With how deeply he felt for the children written all over his face it was simply not possible they had been strangers before he came from the abbey to be employed there. There had to be some connection between him and the captain that was not public knowledge. An old school friend? A debt of some sort no one spoke of?
He sucked in a couple of  deep breaths, forcing them out as he tried to think past the shock that was numbing his brain. When his heart beat had slowed and his breathing leveled, Tony found that a calm had descended over him. When he released the door handle he was surprised to see how his hands shook in light of how calm he otherwise felt. What sort of feeling could shake a man's very flesh and still leave his mind clear as the eye of a storm?
“It was good to see you again,” Ian managed to grit out as Natacha grabbed his hand and began hauling him through the crowd. Ian heard more giggles behind them and Helmut Zemo make a comment about Natacha being just as remarkable as da was, only for Rita Göring to sneer in reply, “She’s a mean-spirited bitch. Have you noticed the horrible shade of her hair?”
It wasn't crying… perhaps choking? And it was definitely coming from Stefen’s- the CAPTAINS, DAMN IT- room. He was familiar with the sound of the mind trying to wake itself.
Stefen hummed at that, eyes sliding along the barrel of the rifle lazily. He reached into the basket, his movements lazy almost sluggish and pulled out an apple. It’d been almost two weeks since Tony had seen Stefan eat without prompting. That routine he had of pushing around food on his plate and taking sparse bites at mealtimes didn’t count. Tony was three days away from force feeding the man just to see him eat a whole meal for once. He’d done better in Vienna but he’d had something to prove then. Well… that wasn’t a bad idea.
. “We all deserve a better world. But it doesn’t happen unless we make it happen. We need to trust on another, to help one another.”
“What do you- Herr Stark wasn’t a part of the war.”  Stefen refuted, but that was lie. Everyone had been a part of the war. “He didn’t fight,” Steve amended.
"You should start calling me Rossi, or better yet Cardinal." Tony scolded the little imp under his breath when he was certain he was close enough that no one else would overhear. "What if one of the police were watching?"
The loft space appeared to have been used primarily for the butchering of game and storage. It was dark and smelled heavily of the salted hirsch Phillips kept stacked in a large crate lined with cheesecloth (the staple of their diet) but with better organization, there was room for a few small beds and even some room to play. He could build them and the children could help. They had Tony’s tools and they were surrounded by plenty of wood.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” He promised, and when he turned to go this time she didn’t try to stop him. It would have been silly to try and Natacha Rogers was not a silly girl.
Bucky raised his eyebrows, wondering for a moment who would have had the audacity, before his eyes were drawn to the figure of Stark below, still banging away at those boats. Of course.
The toddler was enjoying another game of keep away, creeping close only to rush out of arms reach before Natacha could actually get a firm grip on her. Until finally, done with the game, Tacha snatched her up and marched her back toward the bank so that the shrieks could begin anew. Grinning, Tony turned back to Ian.
That night Steve had taken the family to the opera and sat together with the prince and his wife had been the only night Thor could be free of his brother and the other officials they traveled with.  He’d reaffirmed his promise to supply Steve and his network with weapons, funds, and safe passage through Norway, in exchange for a single promise from Steve.
“Don’t call me Antony, and I can’t imagine why I’d be angry that I spent two decades surrounded by liars. Or that it was you who dragged civilians into an
Steve wanted to ask the woman if she were insane. He must have lost control of his expression because he could feel Charlotte tense against him and saw the way Frau Greer and her circle of clucking hens drew back, as if he were growing larger and more threatening right before their eyes of them.
Perhaps Péter replied something back. Steve never heard, because at that very moment he heard the distant whistle and clatter of an approaching train. Every muscle in his body tensed, his mind calculating the distance, how long before the locomotive made its stop and the time it would take for the first passengers to start streaming through those doors and into the hall. Isiah had been waiting down there to meet Tony. Steve couldn’t leave the children but he’d been standing here at the rail just as long.
independent at that.” Loki drawled with a poignant look at his brother before turning back to Steve and Bucky. “Schmidt would just deny the letter and with no proof besides the captain’s word it would be argued that we were interfering with Poland for our own political gain. Father will never risk making an enemy of Germany based on so little.”
Tony wondered if they saw now. If they were all lying awake in their beds at night as he was, wondering who the beast would turn its eye to next once it had finished chewing.
Realizing that it was him and not the authorities, Grig lowered the fire poker he’d brandished at Steve like a sword and Ian shot up off the couch and ran to throw his arms around Steve. Distantly Steve thought Ian might be clutching too tightly but the pain barely registered. Steve’s eyes scanned quickly through the room, taking in the domestic scene that he’d interrupted. Tony’s grandparents were both in their chairs, a checkerboard lay between Antonia and Isiah. Péter and Natacha were nowhere to be seen.
“What are you snickering about now?” Stefen asked, eyeing him suspiciously in the mirror and Tony’s grin broadened.
Peggy had died and they’d splintered, their pieces scattering to the wind… but they’d come back to being something like a unit again. A family.
"You fired Tony, Father?" Maria exclaimed in a very wobbly voice, big watery eyes turning on Stefen. "Is that why he's not come back?"
He held her as she cried and she clutched to him tightly, curling up against his chest like she had when she was Maria’s age, wishing desperately for once that it was true.
“She’s so good with Oliva. You must be so proud, and so sad that you will lose her soon.” Frau Greer simpered up at Steve, one hand still tenderly cupping the blue eyed infant that Natacha was holding. The baby was Frau Greer’s second child. She was eighteen years old, married to Hershwold Greer, Frankfurt’s newly appointed Chief of Police.
“God in heaven.” Tony let out a relieved breath as his heart slowed and he forced something that wasn’t a scowl onto his face as not to scare the already clearly terrified child and asked, “Maria, honey, are you scared?”
It was damned lucky that he could play in his sleep and sing even if he was four sheets to the wind – which he wasn’t, he was just damned nervous as any sane person would be – otherwise the whole disastrous affair could have been that much worse. Tony couldn’t remember a time when he’d ever been this tense, and that was saying something considering he’d once led a prison break armed with nothing but a few homemade explosives. The one saving grace about being stuck at the piano was that it allowed him to drink in peace while he watched the room without drawing too much attention.
"How long has he been sick?" he asked distracted, his mind on fetching his boots and his coat. It would have to be him who went. Steve would never trust any of the army physicians. Not with the sinister ways the resistance had discovered that Nazi's rid themselves of their appointments. It would have to be Erskine, but things had been difficult for the man since the Germans took over. He moved around a lot, helping the displaced as much as he could and aiding the resistance when one of them needed medical attention and couldn't go to any of the hospitals.
He heard Charlotte groan softly just under her breath. Khalmmer cocked his head, his gaze near identical to the appalled expression Charlotte had given him only a moment before. The silence stretched for a moment longer before he snorted, lips stretching into another smile; only this one was devastatingly more real than any Steve had ever seen from him previously. It brought out the green in his eyes Steve noticed with a startled blink.
“They picked a woman for that?” Stefen asked, gruff with insult on D’Anvers behalf. Tony understood Stefen well enough to guess that his ire stemmed from the lack of care it seemed to show selecting a female for covert operations behind enemy lines, and not any perceived lack of competency, but he’d be lying if he said it wasn’t amusing watching D’Anvers dress him down.
"Some prisoners get the idea that they can escape justice with a quick fall."  The firm and low voice of Warden Johannes drew Tony's raptured gaze away from the medical ward.
wrong with Da!" he retorted under his breath. She must have noticed already – Natacha was the sort of older sister who noticed everything and knew everything about everybody – but she hadn't said anything about it yet and Ian couldn’t figure out why.
“It’s not time for the post again.” James remarked at Ian’s shoulder. He was in charge of taking down the temperature in their log book. It was unusually warm for fall and Tony had Ian and his younger siblings tracking the weather for patterns. They’d made a barometer out of a jar, that actually worked. Still, their assignment might have gone smoother if Artur would pay attention and stop singing that song about the goat herder Tony had taught them.
Tony would probably suppose later that Ian called him father in that moment because of the lies he’d told Dagmar and his wife, and there was truth in that. But it wasn’t the only one.
Artur’s face fell in disappointment and Tony was grateful when Cameron, finished with James suitcase stood to his full height and ran a hand through his hair with a bashful smile in Artur’s direction and thanked him for the thought.
“Uncle James is never appropriate,” Natacha informed her with a dry look. “He says people should concern themselves only with being decent and never mind what people think is appropriate.”
Tony took a shuddered breath, unable to quite believe his own ears and unable to pry his eyes away from Stefen’s as the captain, pale even in the fires glow, swallowed thickly.
James shook his head and tucked his face into his father’s shoulder blades. Tony could still see the smirk though as he replied, “I like it up here on you.”
Wonderful wasn’t quite the words Tony would use. Terrifying, noxious, and devastating all came to mind but troubling won out. It didn’t make sense Péter would want to spend more time in the HJ when he was treated so terribly, and they reinforced all of his insecurities about not being able to measure up to his father’s expectations. Sometimes it went that way, Tony knew from personal experience that rejection could spawn a boy to try all the harder but he would have bet before this on Péter going the direction of reckless rebellion.
“How does it go?” Ian asked somewhat hesitantly, eyeing Natacha’s doubtful expression. She made it clear she thought he was a lunatic but said nothing. Tony had never let that sort of thing stop him before. Fully committed he went forward with gusto, standing up on the bed as he began to sing, because if you were going to do something you might as well do it with a bang.
“I’ll have to arrest you.” Neuman answered without adornment. “There are conversion therapies that we could try, to salvage what might be left of your manhood, but I've heard the methods are brutal in their infancy.”
“Shh. Alright. Don’t stress yourself.” Tony halted his frantic string of words, gripping his shoulders and massaging. “I’m sure whatever it is it’s lovely.”
“You don’t have a choice.” she hissed in reply and he flinched. “You’re going to get a hold of yourself and go out there. You will not run away from this like a coward-”
Whether he meant to or not Cafe Mozart’s head host straightened his back with near military precision. Though Steve was sure he would have achieved full attention if his old injury would have let him.
“It’s foolish to lock a child up in a virtual tower, set rules in place designed to isolate and restrict them, and then punish the child for rebellion. You should have predicted it. Your children are half you.”
“What do you want Péter?” Tony asked and the boy’s eyes flew from the mess in the corner back to him. As if snapped from a daze Péter’s mouth shut into a firm line, his back straighter and prouder than it had any right to be on a body so young and untried. Tony didn’t know what to think about the feeling of mirth that overtook him, watching this gangly boy (all limbs and bravado) square his jaw and ask with the sobriety of a seasoned General whether or not Tony was feeling fit to come out of his room.
“No.” Artur cried next. It was little more than a croak but it might as well have been a shout for the way Bucky flinched. A moment passed before he turned his head away from the door, finally looking at them. He gestured stiffly, motioning for them to come to him, and the two boys shuffled towards him, the others trickling after like shadows.
There was even a good-sized crate plopped into the middle of the room that Hammer and Hogan were attempting to pry open with a crow bar.
"Not initially," Stefen reminded him, clearing his throat of the suspicious lump that had lodged there. "But if it carries on longer than a week or two... I'll speak to Herr Stark about it."
“I see that in you," he said earnestly " Every day. You're going to do great things and I- The work you’ve done with Tony is… Péter, you gotta know how proud I am of you."
He stubbornly gave James the food off his plate and tried desperately hard to be a good big brother to him despite the little boy’s bitter resentment of his efforts. He took the fall for James’ tantrums and protected Péter even when the last thing Péter wanted was to be reminded of his own limitations.
Steve hadn't known. There’d been very little talk. It must have been a hasty move indeed. He couldn't help but wonder what happened to the man who had held the position before.
He knocked sharply and didn’t let the sound fade before he turned the knob and pushed the door open. He opened his mouth, but whatever Tony might have come up with to say died with the shock of the sight that greeted him.
"Tony?" Stefen's voice was raspy and dark with uncertainty. Tony slid his hands under the hem of Stefen's night shirt, pushing up the linin until he could lay his hands over the cool flesh underneath and begin rubbing warmth back into his skin.
Péter would have been thrilled to meet Ned’s mother. The pictures Ned kept of her and the island she’d grown up on were amazing. Ned’s father was some sort of business man who traded in sugar, but his parents did not live together – though his mother traveled with his father so often it almost felt as if they did. Ned had admitted nervously one night that he was a bastard, and that some people looked down on his mother for being kept by a man without marriage, but Péter didn’t care. Maybe a year ago he would have felt differently but right now, it just seemed that there were so many more important things to worry about than whose parents were married or not.
Well, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving person, Steve thought darkly. But it could mean trouble for him if the police were combing the streets out for blood.
Ian thought she was called Rita, and her friend was called Elizabeth like the queen. Or maybe it was the other way around. He should have paid more attention. Natacha probably knew which of them was which.
“No, it isn’t.” Tony broke the silence but not the tension between them. He made a subtle movement that placed himself between the two of them, while still primarily keeping himself at Steve’s side. “For someone so naturally graceful, you’ve become remarkably clumsy lately Natacha. Should we have a doctor around to look at you?”
She remembered how out of place he’d looked and sounded (he’d had the worst accent back then) surrounded by the proud display of wealth and prosperity that was one of the Von Trap family functions. Peggy had flitted off somewhere for a moment and Charlotte had watched him stand in the middle of the room like a ship lost at sea, aimless and alone as the whispers and judgmental glances of her family swelled around him. And then Peggy had returned and it was like the sun had cut through the clouds, and Charlotte had known that one day she wanted someone to look at her just that way. She could settle for nothing less.
It was not addressed, but it was stamped rather surprisingly with a familiar seal.  Steve had seen it before, on the letters that had come from Father Farkas at St. Péter’s Abbey when he’d first inquired about a tutor.
Patriot brought the papers, usually smuggled under piles of yesterdays issue. Even though he was a negro the others in the group welcomed him because he was the supply man. Though Péter didn't know who made the programs and printed them for Patriot to deliver to them, it heartened him to know that somebody at one of the printing houses must also be on the side of resistance.
Never again, he promised himself. He’d never put anything above Stefen and the children again. Christmas day would be spent tucked in the villa with the children and what gifts could be bought and brought back from the shops. They’d make music and eat the sweets Willamina had left for them by a warm fire. They would tell the children how they planned to leave and make a new life, and as soon as Stefen was well enough to travel they’d do it.
“Yes, but I did it for myself too and this only works if you can say the same.” Tony managed to grit out through clenched teeth in an effort to resist simply barreling forward without talking. “It’s not too late to back out. You don’t have to do this.”
"I'd hoped you'd noticed," she said, casting her eyes down demurely for a moment. The motion did not help. At all.
“Absolutely. If you think I’m eccentric now, at seventeen with something to prove I was downright heathen. If it had a chance of angering my Father I probably did it. Twice. He’d about given up hope that I would ever amount to anything, not that he’d ever had much to begin with. Trust me, I deserved it.”
“Something familiar about his face is all” he replied, and fear crept up through Ian’s belly like trickles of ice.
“Stark! Can I have a word please?” Stefen growled intending to put a stop to the whole affair but he halted when he felt a tug on his hand. He looked down, startled to find Artur standing beside him.
Stefen’s eyebrows climbed even higher, his mouth opening in surprise as he lifted the lid of the little white box to reveal the shining face of the brass compass that Tony had made him. It gleamed a golden color in the lamplight. Stefen’s initials were carved into its simple surface, and Tony watched silently as Stefen held his breath and traced the letters with two fingers. His clever hands quickly found the latch to open it. The breath he’d been holding released in a sudden woosh as the clasp released and the front opened to reveal the face of the compass as well as the picture glued inside the door.
“What I have to,” Tony answered, finally looking up to meet her worried gaze. He saw the moment she realized what he was about to do but it was too late to stop it.
He’d only narrowly dodged Dr. Earnhardt’s questions about the fortitude of his men. She and her colleagues were curious, they said, about which of his men he thought lacked natural aryan strength. He learned only after offering up some paltry statement of the men being young but promising, that one of her fellow researches, Dr. Ernst Rüdin, was advocating examination on a national scale to identify non-affected carriers of mental diseases and starting with the army as a test. He believed a propensity for mental deficiencies could be anticipated before a soldier ever saw battle simply by noting
"Don't put your children through that,” the lieutenant said meaningfully, meeting Stefen's eye and trading something briefly without words that Tony had no hope of grasping. And then Stefen broke the spell with a slow nod, prying Artur's arms from around his waist and shushing the boy's cry of distress with an aggressive wipe of the tears that stained his red cheeks. It was as if he thought he could destroy the boy’s devastation with his bare hands.
“I’m sure you will.” Bucky shrugged, reaching for a cigarette and the lighter he kept in his pocket. Steve watched him stoically as Bucky lit up, flicked the silver lighter closed and observed Steve like he was inspecting something interesting under a microscope.
“Just because I argue their case, does not mean I don’t share your worries Captain.” Tony rebuked mildly, looping his arm with Steve’s. It forced him to walk slower at pace with the monk, and made it harder for Steve to keep avoiding his gaze, which was likely his reason for doing it.  “Nonno and Nonna are in the twilight of their lives, and Antonia is no spring chicken, either, she can’t keep the house together and keep four stubborn little Rogers out of trouble.”
Arrangement is agreeable. We trust that you will find our pups good homes. Nervi’s health is poorly, and we have decided to take holiday for better air. We both look forward to seeing our good friends again.
He was making the right choice, keeping them together and appeasing the government where he could. They’d accept that Steve preferred the children be educated privately and they would find no fault in his choice of instructors.
“When are you gonna start cutting back?” Stefen fished into his suit pocket and held out a square. “These don't come cheap you know.”
“They’ve been focused here, chasing a ghost.” She answered with a droll look. “But a few days ago, there was an alert that came from Erlangen. A suspicious vagrant was called in by an informant who gave a description. A woman was caring for him before he ran off. They thought it might be Major Rogers.”
“Are you saying that because it’s true or because you want me safe and out of the way?” he asked, searching Tony’s face for his real thoughts. It wasn’t that Tony made a habit of lying to them. On the contrary, Tony was too honest with them, and one of the only adults who Peter trusted to be honest when things were bad- but even so, like most adults he liked to make things sound better and more hopeful than they actually were.
Steve sat back and gritted his teeth, thinking with a small tinge of guilt that he was happy he had a meeting with the Mayor that prevented them from lingering much longer over their lunch.
