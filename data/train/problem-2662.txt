"That's right," Sherlock replied, obviously pleased that John had finally understood. "I don't want you to end up in prison. I want you to stay here with me."
"How come you're still a virgin then? I would have thought Miss Adler would offer up someone like you much sooner," John said, voicing his mild astonishment.
A gentle blush rose to the other man's cheeks, to John's surprise.
- biscuit specialties and recipes (including trying them out myself...)
Mike listened to the ring tone. It wasn't one of the pre-programmed, personalised ring tones that Mike used to identify callers, so it couldn't be very urgent.
Sherlock tore his eyes open. When had he even closed them? He didn't know. But that... that was really John's finger on his erection, smearing the pre-come around that was seeping out of the tiny opening unchecked and in ever greater quantities due to the additional stimulation. Sherlock bit down on his lower lip to suppress a whimper.
That was the moment John had been waiting for. "Shhh..." he said soothingly. "It's all fine. You can put the last bead in now, and then..."
' John thought fleetingly before recalling the feeling of another heartbeat against his ear … how good it had felt to fall asleep to the sound of that thumping … to simply let go... Somehow, it had been worth being late to his meeting.
Something in John's face changed ... it became smoother, more relaxed. "You really missed me," he realised, caressing Sherlock's cheek with his thumb. He sounded a little surprised.
"All right, fine." He reached for his jacket. "Are we going to the exhibition now or what?"
Stunned, he searched his face... his expression...
"They're for Sherlock," she answered firmly. "I'm going to serve them to him with some cream."
"I imagine your wife won't exactly be over the moon about it," Doris said, giving voice to her concerns.
Jacques sat down at the kitchen table. He looked tired. "Why am I even still working here?" The question wasn't directed at anyone in particular, but Mabel took it upon herself to provide an answer.
It all ended up being less fuss than they'd thought. The two men who were still huddled together lit a couple of cigarettes, making them easy to spot in the darkness.
..." Mycroft echoed. "No, I'm afraid that's not an option for me."
"What did you think it was?" John wanted to know.
I know ... evil cliffie!
John sighed. "Yellow. And no St Andrew's cross."
There are 'harmless' ones and ones with spikes. There are also different kinds of spikes. I think the metal ones would be pretty nasty. That's why I decided on the softer, plastic kind for this story. So they would be like longish nubs with rounded ends.
"I hope for your sake that your fun house slide is still greased," John said coldly. "If not... too bad."
Rhum agricole!
Mike suddenly understood why Susan had giggled during her phone call with Sherlock and tossed her hair back in this typical mannerism.
"Jacques?" The butler stopped where he was, bewildered, and Sherlock decided to take a chance on his weak position with this particular segment of the staff. "We require coffee." He deliberately omitted a
“It's not healthy how obsessed you are with this bloke,” Mike said in a last attempt to dissuade John from his plans.
Sherlock continued staring in shock at the spot where Thomas had just been standing. He actually couldn't care less about such titles - he'd never put any stock in them at all. Why, then, did he suddenly feel so …
The two men somehow managed to get rid of their clothing, ending up on the fresh, white sheets with a package of condoms and a tube of lubricant that Greg had conjured up out of nowhere.
"Like..." John started, only to cut himself off. "I want to tear out a couple of walls... I want a bigger bedroom, a walk-in closet with space for all of Sherlock's things too, and I want an en suite bathroom!" He all but hurled the words in Mike's face. "Any objections?"
In answer to the question, "What about you, boss?" John replied, "I have some business to discuss with Miss Adler. I'll be right there."
"Yes, I guess," Sherlock conceded warily.
“That's not an answer, Sherlock,” John told him as stern as he was capable of. His former hesitation and concerns were completely gone. There was no doubt – Sherlock was getting off on the dirty talk and the debasing descriptions of his cock. “How do you make wee-wee with your little willy, hm?”
“All right,” Sherlock said hoarsely, licking his lips in a vain attempt to moisten them. Shortly thereafter, he found the ends of both ropes in his mouth, and he clenched his teeth down on them as if his life depended on it.
Gentle. Soft. Just a brief, intimate touch of one to the other. And yet...
"Sherlock... you're brilliant and completely unbelievable. You let me do things that others... You have ideas no one's ever had before..."
"Horny sod," John murmured, but it sounded more approving than scolding or upset.
“Your belt,” John ordered him curtly.
Sherlock was still in the midst of these reflections when the door to his room opened and all of a sudden John was standing in front of him.
"Mycroft," Greg returned the greeting with special emphasis.
"What?!" Sherlock exclaimed, sounding both surprised and derisive at the same time. "You can do it but you can't say it?" When John shook his head without saying anything, Sherlock went on dryly, "Yes – you raped me. There's no sense in trying to pretty it up."
"Cheeky," John scolded him, but he didn't sound angry; more amused. Still, he grabbed Sherlock by the hair, pulled so hard it was painful, and forced his head back. Sherlock's delighted moan sounded just the way John had imagined it would.
John looked down at where Sherlock was still crouched; he wiped the last bit of semen from the corner of his mouth with his thumb only to lick it clean. Another hopeful but useless twitch. Dammit. Then John's gaze fell on Sherlock's erection, jutting up proud and eager between his thighs.
"You can leave him to me," Mycroft promised with a patronising air.
"Gregory... if we call the police now, there's sure to be a bloodbath down there in the reservoir. Is that what you want?" Mycroft waited a moment before adding, "Not that I wouldn't be happy to rid myself of my brother in such a manner..."
And... gun oil.
Mycroft endured his mother's ensuing monologue with stoicism - just the way she had taught him. During a brief pause in the flow of words, however, he realised that he was no longer seventeen years old, having just been caught in the act of preparing to compose an especially florid piece of poetry. Something like that was the worst kind of time-waster in Sylvia Holmes' opinion.
But then Moriarty pulled Sherlock out from behind one of the pillars, holding a pistol to his temple. John flinched back in shock. He hastily lessened the pressure of his finger against the trigger of his gun. However, he still kept the weapon trained on Moriarty, whose footsteps rang through the high, dismal gallery as he walked along the top of the low wall, dragging Sherlock with him.
', but stopped himself just in time.
"Wait. Just a sec. What was that? Did you really think
... I'll be good enough to overhear that bit."
"What's it for then?" Sherlock asked, his eyes wide.
"Very good," he replied in a teasing tone.
"Oh, please!" Mycroft blurted out with mild scorn. "You're the one who just said you'd never cheated on your wife!"
"This way, Doc," said the third man, who had remained silent up to now. "The parlour's right through here!" He blurted out a short, ugly laugh, bent over, and pushed aside a wooden board that lay on the ground, and which John hadn't noticed.
“The fact that I like hearing you beg far too much … hearing you scream … with pain … with lust...” he whispered in Sherlock's ear, making him shiver at the words.
Then Sherlock left John's property. No one made a move to stop him.
A blonde eyebrow arched playfully “Only '
"You've sure landed yourself a pretty little whore with that one," he remarked, his tone so markedly casual that it was clear to everyone how disparaging it was really meant to be. "Must have cost you a pretty penny. But if he's as good with his mouth as he is with numbers..." Albright shrugged his shoulders with urbane candour.
The bomb in Dimmock's car, the bomb at the police ball, and Charlie's death... they were all connected … they had to be connected. There was certain to be only one person responsible for it all. But WHO? Who had such a great interest in forcing John to his knees? And why was that person going to such lengths? A clean shot between the eyes and '
The dull thud of metal on cloth and flesh was followed by the nauseating, grinding sound of breaking bones. Charlie screamed in pain as his brain registered all the impulses and understood that one of his knees had just been destroyed.
John stared into the distance, lost in thought. "It was your brother you were hiding from this whole time then," he remarked with sudden insight.
Sherlock inspected the rows of books with a certain disappointment that didn't go unnoticed.
“You haven't stopped dripping the whole time,” John reminded him. “You like it.”
It was over pitifully fast. It only took a few strong thrusts to give John an almost desperate orgasm. Silently, accompanied only by a stifled sob, he emptied himself into Sherlock then collapsed on top of him.
“Mike told me you came marching in the middle of his class with Mr Harris to complain about how incompetent he was at grading papers and revealed he had sex with another teacher or something like that,” Oh yeah, he had forgotten about that. It’s not like it was an uncommon thing for him to make a scene in the middle of a lecture when something was bothering him. “And I’m pretty sure you’re the ‘wanker’ Chris kept mumbling about during practice. I don’t know what you found out about him, but he was quite upset.” Sherlock had no idea who Chris was or what it was that he found out about him. But then again, he had no idea who most people in his school were.
“You’re not?” Rosie looked offended now.
Rosie shook her head. “I don’t. Daddy wouldn’t be angry with you. He can’t.”
Around 9 o’clock, he was being driven back home by Lestrade who was having a one-sided conversation. They passed the flower shop (it was closed. Not surprising considering it was already dark) and not long after, arrived at the Holmes’ house.
“Well simply because I’m not.” Sherlock answered hoping it would make enough sense for a six-year-old. Lots of things didn’t make sense to kids and it was sometimes irritating.
“Then I wanna be called Dr. Rosie Watson-
“Do that elsewhere!” She yelled.
Finally, Eurus appeared in the doorway that led to the back of the shop looking confused and mildly worried (maybe because it wasn’t like Sherlock to call his sister in a hushed and panicked voice). She looked even more bemused when she saw him, damp stem and flowers probably messing his already messy hair. Eurus took her eyes off him to look carefully in the shop without saying a word. John Watson couldn’t see her from where he was standing – and was focused on the flowers anyway – so she simply mouthed “your problem, not mine” at Sherlock and silently retreated back to where she came from before her brother could try to beg her to stay.
“Why’s that?” Sherlock didn’t even look up.
“Right. Yes. Of course. Wouldn’t dream on leaving it like that.” Sherlock was sporting a smirk to which John only shook his head (probably in order to hide the small smile that was tugging on his lips).
no one they knew would cross their path, because if they did run into someone, John would feel the need to prove his heterosexuality and manliness and would drop his hand immediately.
“What the bloody hell were you thinking!” It’s John who started shouting but his parents quickly caught on and after a few seconds their voices overlapped, and it was nearly impossible to decipher who was saying what.
They arrived in front of the flat and Sherlock wanted more than anything to end this conversation quickly. “Okay you know what? Call me Papa if you want but don’t do it in front of Daddy okay?”
And so Sherlock answered, somewhat thinly, "Neither you nor I are each other's first," making an effort to sound worldly.
Just a few days after their first conversation, John had Dave and Naresh pick up the mayor again and bring him to the same bungalow he was already acquainted with. He himself was driven there by Bridges, and arrived - intentionally - about fifteen minutes after Mycroft Holmes.
"That should answer your question," Mike replied. "He wanted to practise a bit."
for it. To
"No," Sherlock answered firmly. "For some reason, John wants to ensure that I remain exactly where I am. And that's why I'm going to stay here."
"When someone's as good at it as you are... then the answer is yes," Sherlock replied without hesitating as he stretched and writhed in a highly enticing manner.
"What have I... you've known forever that I shot him! Why are you yelling at me about it now?"
he completed the sentence to himself. But he didn't want to burden Mike with that answer. "For a while now," he said instead. "But I'm more interested in knowing... since when have you had an opinion on the
"My brother..." Mycroft Holmes leaned forward in his chair and continued very insistently: "My brother is not worth your time. Believe me."
Sherlock blinked. "If I...
But, as the weeks wore on, there started to be something…wrong. John couldn’t put his finger on it. Couldn’t define exactly what was off, but he knew there was something missing. Not for him, thanks. He was with the man he’d been pining over for months, was having sex on a regular basis, and was arse over tits in love. He was satisfied. More than satisfied.
Sherlock's favourite plug might look something like this... although not made of metal...
Oh yes... Sherlock recognised that well enough. Whenever Mycroft answered in such detail, he was trying to deflect from something else.
"Oh, thank you so much, kind sir," Sherlock mocked, and John could virtually hear him rolling his eyes.
John ground his teeth, audible even at that distance.
if I didn't... if I didn't get a divorce... That was just a joke, right? You only said that so I'd get my arse in gear and finally do something. Right?" He passed the cigarette back to Mycroft.
A hand found its way to his hair and ruffled it gently. "You should get to bed. Wouldn't want you to fall asleep here," John mentioned, a trace of concern in his voice. "You'd end up with a hell of a backache tomorrow."
Sherlock gave him a derisive look. "It astounds me every time that you are so deeply invested in returning me to the heart and hearth of the Holmes clan - you, who never wanted me to be a member of such an illustrious family in the first place."
John tensed and gasped. Then he jerked back out of Sherlock's body and took an unsteady step to one side.
"I know," Mycroft conceded. "I shouldn't have demanded this of you."
The first thrust was still careful … feeling him out … but then John threw caution out the window.
Still somewhat lost in thought, he stood next to the bed and turned on the light on the bedside cabinet. Although it was a large bed, there was only one bedside cabinet, and only one lamp. That had always drawn Sherlock's attention in the past, but tonight was the first time he realised why: it was a sad image. This huge house - this huge bed … and only one person living in it - sleeping in it.
Greg stared angrily out the window. "I was just one floor up. Was it too hard for you to climb the stairs?"
Too casually. Too well practiced. Too intent on delivering what the average trick wanted to hear.
"Good day, Detective Inspector," Mycroft Holmes greeted him, gesturing toward one of the chairs designated for visitors across from his desk. "Please - have a seat."
"I don't go looking for trouble," Sherlock countered smoothly. "Trouble finds me."
are not my area."
“I can’t…” John sighed. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
I rewrote it into an original novel and am currently trying to find a publisher.
That was a bitter pill for Sherlock to swallow. He'd let himself be tricked like a foolish schoolboy. His anxiety over John had rendered him unable to think clearly. How stupid could he be?! Shaken by his own idiocy, he stared silently out the side window. After a short while, however, he gave his kidnapper a searching look. It wouldn't do any good to fret over past mistakes. He needed all his intelligence, all his mental acuity, and all his focus now to get himself and John out of the snare which seemed to be relentlessly closing in on the two of them. And for that, he needed information. As much as possible. One never knew what might turn out to be useful. There was this woman's motive, for example... Why was she so insistent on...
WARNING!
"It's more than seven hours by car from London to Crieff... If you went by plane... you wouldn't be gone as long."
Sherlock looked up at him incredulously. "Just be myself?" he asked, perplexed. "That's never ended well for me."
Here are the links with additional information:
"You're welcome," Lestrade said, still a bit put out. "But I'm not happy about it."
Here's part of the section on "
Mike patted him on the shoulder. "We've taken care of much bigger problems before. Are you coming down to the restaurant? I've heard things about the wild pheasant..."
Mycroft lifted his chin with an arrogant smile. "You misunderstand your position,
"Sure thing, boss," Mary replied curtly.
"At least you do admit it," Sherlock responded impassively, and with a hearty yawn. His arm slung itself possessively around John's midsection.
"You can clear the table now, Jacques," he said on his way over to the couch. He sat down and crossed his legs. Obviously an attempt to hide his arousal from his employee. The grin playing on Sherlock's lips was just a bit malicious. So John had been affected by the feeding as well. It wasn't just Sherlock who had been reduced to nothing more than a single, quivering erogenous zone by his actions.
'. (Which he, admittedly, rarely used. There was simply no need. He had the real thing, the genuine article, in his life.)
He wasn't able to fulfil all the criteria - but two out of three wasn't bad. He'd made worse decisions in the course of his life. Remaining under the same roof with John yet not being with him was strictly out of the question; it was simply not an option.
Irene led him to her office, closed the door behind them, and offered him a seat in the chair across from her desk while she took the one behind her desk.
A thick, fat drop of semen hung from the edge of Sherlock's lower lip, and a viscous, opaque thread stretched from there to his upper lip.
There was no other logical conclusion. John must have been betrayed more than once in the past, and it must have hit him hard every time, as he was a possessive man and
' Sherlock thought, and pressed his lips to John's mouth again, hoping that one kiss would express everything his vocal cords were unable to.
Sherlock opened his eyes. All he could see was the wall across from the bed. He should have known John wasn't going to make it easy for him. He tilted his head as slowly as possible, causing a concomitant increase in the pulling and pricking in his scrotum. At the same time, the burning in his nipples lessened a bit.
"Fuck!" he cursed heartily to give himself some relief. "Buggery fuck!" Then he took a deep, cleansing breath. "All right," he finally said. "No sense crying over spilt milk. Put out the evidence we prepared so the police have someone to pin the bomb on from their bloody ball and I'm not their scapegoat any longer."
"A little," Mycroft admitted. "Does that bother you?"
“Why is it so difficult for you to let me finish speaking today?” John asked so sweetly that Sherlock's gaze cleared for a moment and he regarded him with interest.
"And now go and change," Sherlock said with a little sigh. "I don't particularly fancy having Mike's anger directed at me because you're late."
How could that have happened to him? Okay, he knew exactly what had happened. Right after their arrival in Spain, they had met with the secretary of the British Embassy, who told them about his problems. Sherlock soon found a suspect, the following search for clues, and later proof, had kept them busy for the rest of the night as well as the following morning. Afterwards they had spent hours locating the suspect but finally, they had been able to capture him after a breathless hunt through the city’s harbour. The culprit had been handed over to the police, confessions and statements had been delivered and filed, and Sherlock had paid for two single rooms in this luxury hotel. However, John suspected that the credit card he had used to settle the bill carried Mycroft’s name… but he couldn’t have cared less. All he wanted was a hot shower and a comfortable bed.
Mike lowered the papers in his hands onto his lap. "What bit you?" he asked, bewildered. "Can't I ask an old mate if he's had a bit of fun any more? I'm worried about you! You've been so...
Mike watched the two men exit with an expression of mild interest. Once the door had closed behind them and he heard their footsteps receding up the stairs, he clicked his tongue in disapproval. He had to admit, though - that Sherlock did have a head for numbers.
"Do I look like someone who's particularly virtuous?" Sherlock pouted.
Fingers in his hair...
John shrugged and lifted the box a bit so Sherlock could get a look at the violin case inside.
All of a sudden, John became aware of the surreal stillness in the room, and he tried to recall - with faint unease - how long he'd been silent.
," Mycroft Holmes drawled. "And I must admit, after the statement you just made, a bit surprising. You're defending him. A toy doesn't need defending. Might it be that... you, of all people, trust someone like my brother?"
Translation by the fantastic SwissMiss!
"I had quite enough skills at my disposal," Sherlock interrupted with a growl.
The beads inside him.
"Not that I have anything against the male eroticism of an unshaven face..." Mycroft remarked, taking the drink from Greg. Instead of trying it, however, he eyed the cup with distaste.
"But he..." Sherlock licked his lower lip nervously. "He must know that you and I... that we... what we are to each other?" An embarrassed gesture accompanied his vague statement.
He was thrown to the ground again and flipped onto his stomach, and Sherlock knew John didn't mean him.
John took a few seconds to observe the sensual scene and enjoy the faint throbbing in his groin.
Mike was about to go when Sherlock's eyelids fluttered and he moaned softly.
"Prima donna..." Mike said in an irritated undertone and set his mobile aside. As if anything could happen to John at Albright's... not even Albright was that careless. He grimaced when the pain in his back hit him again. What was taking the doctor so long?
He pressed together his lips and spat out, "Why not?" The anger and fury flashing in his eyes had almost found their way into his voice.
But then Sherlock wasn't really surprised. He'd never had much luck with erotic roleplaying.

Mike scoffed a bit, but then pointed at the television screen.
"Yes," he confirmed hoarsely. "When are you finally going to put it back in?"
"He could certainly afford it," she said dryly.
"Yellow?"
the taste of semen! I love the feeling of a hard, thick cock stuck down deep in the back of my throat... The way it almost chokes me and floods me with ejaculate. That's it. That's what I want!" He was breathing hard and biting his lips, both aroused and angry. "And although I'm the one down on my knees in the submissive position, I'm also the one who has all the power!" Something like fierce triumph gleamed in his eyes. "I'm the one making them come! And I love swallowing it all and going down with it!" He gasped for breath, as if he were actually in danger of submerging and drowning, only to lower his eyes once again after one last, wild look in Irene's direction. "To go down with it... to drown in it... to lose myself in it ... to forget myself..." His final words were almost lost as they faded into a barely audible whisper.
"No, I won't," John replied coldly.
"You really do try to be a good person..."
The tip of John's tongue passed across his upper lip, and Sherlock's gaze fogged over for a moment. Then John was gone, and Sherlock was left alone with Billy.
"Yeah." Patrick nodded. "Carl Powers. She started out having it off with him. Then he drowned in the pond we used to go swimming in when it was hot in the summer." He laughed. "He either had the tart with him that day or he was soft in the head."
Greg tried to gain some time by taking another drag on the cigarette.
"I don't," Sherlock insisted.
"Sherlock," John said gruffly, moistening his suddenly dry lips with his tongue. "You don't know what you're saying."
Sherlock didn't let the chance go unused. He arched toward John, welcomed him unconditionally into his body, let him work off steam, and tried to be as good to him as he could at the moment.
Sherlock glared at him as he painted a picture of his future fate.
He closed his eyes, utterly overcome... he left off from the notes written on the page... yet still carried through on their intention... changed the melody, varied it... let his heart speak through the music and realised at some point that all of his thoughts and feelings had been filled with John from the first note on. Sherlock continued to play... returned to Bach's composition... collected himself and let his heart run free... played notes and sounds that had never been written down, ones that came directly from him... exclusively from him... from his innermost self... from his singular soul.
They went in so easily, and Sherlock pressed back into the fingers, welcomed them and silently begged for more.
In his rush, John had apparently forgone the hair gel he usually used for the purpose, instead settling for parting it neatly and combing it back with a wet comb, but even so it looked extremely smart.
"Room eleven – but I really can't..." the doorman made one last, desperate attempt. Why did the boss lady have to wear such high heels? She'd have been at the door already if she wore flats, and could have dealt with the mob boss herself. If he ever came out of this mess alive, he was going to demand a pay rise!
There, lying on his gently glowing violin - which appeared to be in excellent condition - was a folded piece of paper. Curious, he reached for it and opened it. His brow wrinkled once again when he recognised Mycroft's handwriting. He briefly considered sparing himself the - doubtless scornful - outpouring, but in the end his curiosity won the upper hand and he started to read.
The familiar, lusty throbbing arose in John's groin, and it was only the fact that they were in a cemetery that stopped him from allowing his thoughts to wander off in certain directions. He placed two fingers beneath Sherlock's chin and lifted it slightly.
he sent."
Greg shook his head, but took a disposable glove out of one of the pockets of his jacket, pulled it on, and went to the lowest step of the landing. There, he knelt down and felt around for the submerged toy. His efforts were soon rewarded, and he passed the piece to John with an inscrutable expression.
What formats cigars come in, how the wrappers differ, length, size, colour, shape... (no end there either).
"That's easy enough to say," Mycroft contradicted him sourly, not even pretending he hadn't understood who or what Greg meant. "But that's not just anyone, it's my brother!"
- especially given that he wore his blond hair down to his shoulders, sometimes even longer. He'd been called
Greg snorted in amusement. "You're one to talk... so you had someone check up on me, did you?"
Sherlock shook his head. "No. Tea is fine."
He didn't know precisely at which point his horror at being killed by Mary Moran or Moriarty had become greater than his fear of dying. No, that wasn't quite right. He wasn't afraid of dying, and never had been. His life up to now had never really seemed much worth living before, and he would have embraced death as an act of emancipation. But now... now he had John, and life with John was... absolutely wonderful. He still wasn't afraid of dying as such, but now death would also mean not being with John anymore. And the thought of being without John had become utterly anathema to Sherlock.
"Forget it. I tried lying to her once. Never again," Jason stated categorically. "When I told her what was going on this time, she forbade me from contacting you. Said she wanted to do it herself."
Gasping for air, he collapsed against Sherlock, who only now removed his fingers from John's throat and held him by the shoulders. John could feel the beginnings of Sherlock's erection against his stomach and glanced at the clock on the mantel. Dammit! Mike was almost certainly waiting downstairs for him. He brushed his knuckles apologetically over the hard swelling in Sherlock's pyjama trousers, heard his breath stutter and said, "Sorry, but I really don't have time." He stepped back from Sherlock, who watched him with an inscrutable expression.
"Well... I don't know what makes me think of it either... maybe because you wanted me to make sure to get one of those bullet-proof vests. Which I
?" Sherlock asked slowly, still unable to comprehend what was happening. He wasn't being thrown out. Instead... what? What exactly was John offering him here?
"Sherlock?" John sounded honestly worried, and Sherlock felt the vibrator being removed from his body a bit too fast. He flinched. "Sherlock, look at me," John ordered him sternly, placing both hands on Sherlock's cheeks and forcing him to turn his face toward John. "Look at me," he said again, but this time his voice was more gentle. Sherlock opened his eyes reluctantly.
"I can recommend an excellent solicitor."
Charlie sniffled. "It wasn't me, Doc. I swear!"
"All right," John said slowly, returned the gun to its holster and noted with quiet gratification that Holmes appeared to be a tiny bit more at ease than before. It seemed he wasn't quite as cold a fish as he wanted people to believe. "If we don't have any pictures, then... then we need a description of the suspects. Someone must have noticed them!"
"John... I... something's happening..." Sherlock panted. The muscles in his neck were tight, his abdomen was trembling. "Don't stop... John... you... please... please, I think... I... yes... I think it's coming... John... John! Now! John... I... Aaaaaaahhh!"
An understated black limousine stopped directly in front of the main entrance to the house. The back door opened, and John got out.
- electoral regulations and procedure for the mayoral elections in other large cities in Great Britain
"It's not the best time, I'm afraid."
"Oh yes," John confirmed with a fiendish grin, even though Sherlock couldn't see it. "I am!"
Even as Sherlock still clung to the fleeting kiss, John inserted the hand with the plug between Sherlock's thighs.
"Put your feet flat on the table," John ordered him a little more forcefully than he'd originally intended, but it didn't matter: Sherlock obeyed without hesitation, sighing softly. He was lying so close to the edge of the table that he had to spread his legs wide in order to get a proper foothold at all. This resulted in his most intimate area being put on flagrant and unprotected display before John's ravenous gaze. His fingers found their way to Sherlock's plump testicles, running over them playfully on the way down to the soft skin of his perineum and further to the opening that was
The sight that greeted him, however, was one he couldn't have anticipated in his wildest dreams. Sherlock sat on
John sighed, defeated. “Of course you have a spreadsheet. But: The murder of the cinema technician does not count as a movie night,” he clarified. “And a chase through Hyde Park is not a romantic walk.” He paused, thinking. “On the other hand… in a completely twisted way it totally makes sense. Maybe they were dates.”
Anthea, who was folding towels, snorted incredulously, which elicited a giggle from Thomas - who was in the middle of sewing a button onto his suit jacket.
Sherlock swallowed hard. His throat felt strange. How curious.
Mycroft's thin lips formed a smirk. "I wouldn't have chosen those particular words, but... yes. Precisely because you are
The mention of women tore Sherlock out of his sinful thoughts of insulting royalty. "Rolling cigars is traditionally a man's job," he corrected John, almost angrily.
"Today," Sherlock said tonelessly. "Earlier. Before you left."
When Miss Adler joined her guests shortly thereafter – dressed, as per usual, in very tasteful but somewhat severe attire – and announced the start of the auction, John looked around the room, trying to catch a glimpse of this mysterious Sherlock character. But although several of the other employees were present, Sherlock distinguished himself solely through his absence.
No sooner had he spoken than a knock sounded at the door and Jacques entered. On the tray he set down on the desk in front of Sherlock were three cups, a small pot of coffee, and a little pitcher of milk along with a sugar bowl. The saucers were already decorated with the delicate almond biscuits Jacques was so proud of - and rightfully so. As usual, there were two biscuits on Sherlock's plate, while John and Mike were each accorded a single confection.
Sherlock dwelled on that image in his mind's eye for a little too long. Then he ground his teeth. Wonderful... now he wanted a cigarette again. And he'd also awakened a thirst for cognac.
"Fuuuuck..." John swore from between gritted teeth.
" Mycroft repeated the words his father had passed on to him decades earlier.
"My name is Doris Adler. I'm a friend of Violet's..."
"Then you must need it pretty badly," John remarked in a mocking tone in order to conceal how much that statement affected him. He was proud of Sherlock, yet at the same time he didn't know why he should be. After all, the little slut hadn't done anything more than exercise a modicum of self-restraint. Why should he be proud of the fact that this oversexed piece of tail hadn't spent every waking moment fingering himself? There was no reason – of course not. And yet he was.
They'd taken a different way in than John Watson had been directed to by Moriarty, seeking a spot that was more or less protected from curious onlookers in order to climb over the fence that separated the park from the rest of the city. Since the park was closed after sunset, they hadn't had any other choice in order to gain entrance to the grounds. Now they moved cautiously toward the McKenzie Pavilion, which was near the rendezvous point the mob boss was heading for.
As the title says... some very long foreplay.
Translation by the perfect SwissMiss!!!!
"It's not really like that," Sherlock finally answered. "Smoking is the last vice I indulge in … perhaps that's the reason." He tried to sound as nonchalant as possible.
"Stay," he whispered softly, and when John hesitated, he added: "Just a little while...
A choked sob reached his ear. He opened his eyes, lazy and sated, and saw Sherlock coaxing the last few drops of semen out of his deflating penis with an almost tender gesture. It took him a moment to understand that Sherlock hadn't ejaculated.
. I don't want him sticking his nose in things that don't concern him."
back then anyway," John admitted, swallowing hard. "I... loved you, Victor."
It was roughly a week later when John and Sherlock were celebrating the solution of a minor case ("It was the gardener! I should have seen this 3 hours ago!") with a nice blowjob in bed. John was lying between Sherlock's legs, licking with a broad tongue over Sherlock’s interested - but so far only half hard - cock... from root to glans and back again. Sherlock was moaning every now and then and without thinking John said: "You like it, when I lick your little prick, don't you?"
John had expected a cynical undertone, but he certainly hadn't reckoned with such sharp-nosed vigilance. "Or I'll arrange to have a couple of coppers shot. Just for fun," John returned icily. "I'd hate to go against my principles, but if you leave me no other choice... that wouldn't go down well with the voters..." He shook his head in mock regret.
"Gone," Irene answered shortly, registering a split second too late how Sherlock's eyes widened in horror, and hurried to assuage his fears. "No reason to panic. I bring good tidings! Before he left, he came to see me and set up regular appointments with you," Irene crowed. "Starting immediately, you can look forward to seeing your Doc every Wednesday and Sunday from five to seven PM." Her eyes slid over Sherlock, who was still lying nude on the couch, displaying all the signs of sexual gratification. "Mmhhh... yummy," she said with a broad wink.
"Morning, Sherlock," Mike grumbled and went past him to the living room.
"If you'll tell me now where I can take you?" Bridges asked again. "I can go round the roundabout a fourth time, of course, if you'd prefer..."
, of all people, might have made a deal with Doc Watson?" Holmes asked, all polite interest.
butt plug... his butt plug. He sighed happily when John slid it into his loosened, pliant hole with gentle pressure, ensuring that John's sperm would remain trapped snugly inside Sherlock's body.
?' No sooner had the word faded away than the memory of Sherlock's own '
"Very good," John praised him, sounding so proud, so soft and warm that Sherlock made an extra effort and blinked. He opened his eyes slowly, meaning to turn his head to seek John's gaze, but the fingers in his hair held him back. "No... don't look at me," John said softly. "Look straight ahead."
A broad, dangerous smile distorted John's lips. "That's easy, sweetheart... you're of no use to me."
' once again, but varied it after a while and then, after a searching look in John's direction, moved on to a different piece without any noticeable pause. It sounded strangely familiar to John, but he didn't really know it.
John jerked his head up and looked at Sherlock, aghast. "How can you be so calm? I ... What I did..."
Sherlock trusted him when it came to his physical security and integrity. That was something, at least. He'd never experienced that to such a degree with any other man.
John shook his head, incapable of speaking.
He bit down hard on the inside of his cheek and continued the descent until his feet couldn't feel any more metal rungs beneath them, instead hitting the smooth, hard ground. In a single, fluid motion, John let go of the ice-cold rungs (he'd never been so glad for his leather gloves before), took his gun out of the inside pocket of his jacket and turned around.
As he was writing, she leaned back in her chair, grinning like the cat who got both the canary
"If only I knew..." Mike said mournfully. "I've never seen him like this before." He slapped his knees and stood up. "That's why I thought it best to warn you. You never know what ideas may come into his head when he's in one of his moods... You probably know best how he can be."
John had always found it much more effective to kill the troublemaker themselves. That saved a lot of trouble and was more effective and more efficient than exerting pressure through threatening the well-being of family members.
"Oooohhh, someone's rather pleased with themselves. Is it that good?"
A pained expression flashed across Sherlock's face. "Why do you keep saying that?" he blurted out in distress. "I know it's not true. There is absolutely no reason to humiliate me. At least not like that..."
London's City Hall really does have a couple of funny nicknames.
John didn't even consider the fact that his entire train of thought was based on the assumption that Sherlock's arms would always be open for him as long as he wanted them to be. He never considered that Sherlock would ever reject him … he took it for granted that – as long as John paid him – he would never do that. For John, it was more a question of when he would get sick of Sherlock. At the moment, it didn't seem possible, but John knew from painful experience that no one would ever be able to tie him down forever. Sherlock wasn't going to be any different. Although he did allow himself to hope that it would take quite a while before he got bored with Sherlock, because at the moment he was enjoying his life as he hadn't enjoyed it in a very long time.
"Is it good like that?" John asked, inserting a thin pillow under Sherlock's head.
"College," John answered, as if he had nothing to hide. "Your playground battles don't really interest me. Why? Did I miss a skeleton somewhere in your closet?"
Mycroft blinked back over at Sherlock, crossed his legs, and rested his hands in his lap. "Sherlock. It's been a while since we last saw each other. A shame that this happy interlude has come to such an abrupt end."
There! A sound! Distorted by the reverberation of the echo. Footsteps! Weren't they? John wasn't sure. He couldn't even say for certain which direction the sounds were coming from.
"Love, faith, and hope are high ideals," John cut him off. "But they don't have any place in my life," he concluded cynically.
"Sherlock..." John murmured in a voice that reflected both incredulity and desire. "Sherlock..." His hips jerked forward uncontrolled, and he stroked Sherlock's hair again in what he hoped was a calming way. "Don't..." he said softly. "You don't have to..."
John shrugged his shoulders in a diffident gesture. "Not tonight ... not tomorrow ... but sometime, yes, I will."
"Yes," Sherlock replied with a nonchalant shrug.
"Overall, things aren't so bad," Greg concluded his brief report. "Violent crimes are on the decline, robberies as well. It's got pretty quiet. Almost too quiet, you'd think... if it weren't for a sharp increase in the death rate in certain quarters." Greg studied the mayor closely. He didn't intend to miss a single blink, twitch, or any other telltale movement. But there was nothing. Holmes' face was like a calm lake in the middle of the woods, its flat, mirror-like surface undisturbed by a single ripple. A peaceful image - and yet the reflection blocked any view of the lake's dark depths... any chasms that might lurk there remained hidden from the observer.

," he answered mechanically. "I prefer
As soon as he tipped his head forward, the pull on his testicles became sharper, and the small, rounded spikes that lined the inside of the parachute pressed ever harder into the soft, sensitive tissue, releasing little explosions of pleasure endorphins in Sherlock's brain despite the pain.
John licked his lips.
John swallowed hard and said with a light shake of his head, “Always one step away from disaster, aren't you?”
"To the bedroom."
"Oh really?" John retorted, looking demonstratively around him. "Shy sort, is he? Or why don't I see him?"
"I didn't forbid you to," John said gently.
John regarded him wordlessly. If he'd ever needed confirmation that Sherlock wasn't telling him the whole truth about himself and his half-brother, Mycroft, he'd received it now in Sherlock's continued refusal to leave the house. There was something rotten in Denmark. It pained him that Sherlock apparently didn't trust him enough to admit his fabrications. But if that was the case, then he had to accept it. There was no way he was going to push Sherlock on this. He should come to John with the truth when he was ready. John could wait. Although it was a mystery to him where he was getting all the patience from that he needed for Sherlock. He'd never been known for such long-suffering equanimity as he was displaying now.
John gave him an odd look. Then he stood up and held out a hand to Sherlock.
"This way, boss," Naresh replied and pointed to one of three doors that opened off the hallway where the stairs had led them.
Mycroft looked over at Greg.
"I'm beginning to wonder whether, of the two of you, Sherlock's not the one who has the greater burden to bear..." Holmes mused.
"Just a moment," Sherlock interrupted him, holding up a hand in front of himself as if to stop John's words; to block them and push them back. "Was that just an attempt to tell me I'm... good-looking?" Sherlock had narrowed his eyes, but they didn't look particularly suspicious; rather, they appeared completely empty.
"Violin," Sherlock corrected him in an undertone.
"Nonetheless..." John inserted with chilling calm. "The proceeds from thirty g-packs of coke are missing from the receipts. And according to my records, the stuff got lost here on your end. How does that look for you, Barbie... hm?"
John chewed on the inside of his cheek. "Sherlock... it couldn't go on like that. It simply couldn't go on any longer."
Sherlock was used to the touches of strange men, of course. More than used to them. John couldn't help thinking of the countless faceless and nameless men Sherlock had been willingly subjected to in Irene Adler's brothel. He thought of the union leader, Glendale, whom he'd almost had killed... and he thought of all the men in his own life who had only ever cheated, betrayed, deceived, and left him.
"I'm not dead..." Sherlock murmured, in a daze.
"His policeman has a name. It's Gregory Lestrade - as you are well aware."
"You..." John had to swallow hard. He'd been prepared for just about any reaction... but this surpassed them all. "You aren't... disgusted?"
John looked down at Sherlock, lost in thought. This singular man belonged to him... wasn't it perfectly normal to protect one's belongings - especially such a precious one - and treat them with extreme care? Sherlock's well-being was important to him. Admittedly, he'd never really cared much about the welfare of his other playmates. He'd felt rather indifferent toward all of them in the end. Just as they'd felt indifferent toward him. He'd been nothing more than a walking wallet for them. But not Sherlock. Sherlock was... different. So wonderfully different...
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, you did!" Charlie insisted stubbornly. "It was you!"
The only thing John could do now was try to stall for time. He was under no illusion about whether the events of this fateful afternoon would be thrashed out all over the mob. All he could do was make sure it didn't happen too quickly. John needed time... time to find out who was behind this whole mess.
Of those, I decided on BMW:
The dinging of the lift bell tore him away from his thoughts. He announced himself to the blond secretary, and she led him - with a resolutely friendly smile - directly to the mayor's office. She rapped smartly on the door, opened it, and held it for Lestrade.
"No, you don't!"
That one look, that one blink, told John more than words ever could. Sherlock was fine. John needn't worry about him anymore. Now he could direct all of his attention to Moriarty again.
His hands trembled as he lifted the case out of the box - a reaction that filled him with disgust. A thick folder was revealed underneath it. Sherlock recognised it at once and frowned. Why had Mycroft sent him all their sheet music? And a music stand too? He set the case down carefully on the table. Then he took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and flipped open the clasps. He stared down at the dark case for a long time, unable to stand the sight of his shaking hands as he raised the lid. His lips were dry. He tried to moisten them with his tongue, but in vain. Why had he been so eager to wake sleeping dogs once more? What had he wanted to prove to himself? Wouldn't it be better to pack everything up again and throw it away than to face his fears? Why didn't he simply stick his head in the sand and wait until his internal demons left him in peace and...
John stared down at the hand holding the leather paddle as if seeing it for the first time. The implement was perfect for what Sherlock was suggesting. It felt good in his hand and wasn't very flexible, so it would be easy to land a hit even if it were used with less than complete concentration. The sound it made striking skin was gratifyingly loud - as John knew from experience - without causing all too much pain. It took quite a bit of strength to handle - at least when the paddle was used over a longer period of time. John would be able to hit as hard as he wanted without actually hurting Sherlock. He'd be able to give it his all - without a guilty conscience - and work off all of the pent-up adrenaline. It was a bloody seductive thought and so completely messed up that John didn't know how to make Sherlock understand.
"You can let me in to see Sherlock... what else do you think?"
"Say it again..." Sherlock asked softly.
"What? What exactly are you saying, John?"
He understood so much of what the doctors said. He was able to comprehend words, concepts, and connections that went right over the heads of other children his age.
“You are worth your weight in gold!” Irene crowed, ignoring his outburst. “I knew you'd manage it.”
"Detective Inspector Lestrade noticed them."
Sherlock glanced down at his hand, which was still ensconced in John's. He saw it as if for the first time. Then he lifted his head and looked John in the eye. He examined John's face, seeking some point of reference, anything that would help him to finally understand this man. But John was so different than anyone else he'd ever known. John was sadistic yet caring, quick-tempered yet forgiving, brutal and ruthless and uncontrollable yet blessed with the patience of an angel where he - Sherlock - was concerned. Never before had anyone exercised so much patience with him, and he simply didn't understand it. Even now, he could see nothing but indulgence in John's face.
Why in the world John let him get away with it was a mystery even to him. John Watson did not cuddle! But there was something else going on with Sherlock … when he rested his cheek on John's knee, there was something so trusting in the gesture that John didn't want to disturb it for anything in the world. After all, it was rather nice to have someone around who displayed such unconditional admiration - almost adoration - as Sherlock did. Even if that adoration was directed mainly at John's artful gratification of Sherlock's sexual lusts, it still flattered John's vanity.
took place on the first and second floors, and the lounges on the ground floor where guests could become acquainted with the house's offerings, the building contained three studio flats on the third floor, each with their own cooking niche and bath.
"Might it be... that that brilliant brain of yours has come to the completely wrong conclusion that you need to make yourself useful around here, no matter what?" John asked gently.
He didn't hear the buzz, didn't feel the draught, and so the blow to his painfully hard penis hit him completely unprepared. An excruciating throbbing, a lust-filled agony, unfulfilled ecstasy. He gasped desperately for air, not having the strength to cry out, not even to lift his head. The tears flowed freely down his cheeks. The silk clung wetly to his eyes.
"The saucer was a good idea... see? It's already less than the first time. I think three or four more times..."
"No." Sherlock shook his head dolefully. "John isn't the kind of man who would forget something like that," he said dully. He sat up and covered his lap with a cushion. The golden feeling of elation in his chest sank lower, lost its gleam and warmth and finally congealed as a lump of ice in his stomach.
John smiled to himself and stood up. "May I offer you a drink? Cognac perhaps?" He went to the wall cupboard and opened one of the doors, behind which several bottles and glasses were hidden. "I also have quite a decent port here. Or maybe a single malt?" As mentioned - he could afford to be magnanimous and play the host just a little bit.
“For the same reason I was living on the streets, and the same reason I can't come with you,” Sherlock answered dully.
the room." The last bit was said with a salacious undertone. "Which reminds me... I don't want you playing with yourself while I'm gone. No wanking, no frotting into a pillow, no playing with the massage function in the shower. You're only to touch your prick to piss, shave, and wash."
"Good God," Mike groaned, irritated. "Then order something else - look, the waiter's zipping over this way again." He signalled, and the waiter adjusted his course toward them.
Sherlock merely blinked once then pushed the box to one side and stepped right over the table with all the elegance and abandon of a cat. When he was standing directly in front of John - who was staring up at him with his mouth hanging slightly open - he took John's hand and pressed it between his legs.
"Your sense of fair play is refreshing, as always."
"Familiar - yes. But it doesn't apply here. I'm more than a
Mycroft shook his head. "This is neither the time nor the place."
"More than," John replied with a broad grin. "And now go get that water."
"You missed some."
, as Scotland Yard's finest are so charmingly called."
"I trust you," Sherlock said with quiet gravity and a hint of a shrug, and John was struck dumb by the sheer simplicity of the statement.
He shivered in spite of the warm, sunny spring day.
"Yes... yes, she was. And beautiful. So beautiful, and her laugh..." He broke off. "Then the child must be almost six years old?"
"Agreed," Jason said obligingly. "I'll pass them on to you."
As if a switch had been thrown, John seemed to come back to his right mind. He stared at Mike as if he'd never seen him before in his life, then looked down at the weapon in his hand, aghast, and slowly lowered his arm.
The man twitched briefly before a greedy gleam appeared in his eyes. He performed a slight bow and said, "How may I be of service?"
I will keep you updated for more news about title, date and so on.
Now it was John's turn to be confused. "You have looked in a mirror from time to time, I assume?"
"Delete...delete...delete..." Greg narrated as he did so. "Del... Hey- what's this?" he asked suddenly, sitting up with a start.
"Good. And what the hell is so important and secret that John can't know about it and you need to call me at three-thirty in the morning?" Mike ranted.
"Fine. Give me a day or two," Mycroft finally acquiesced. "Shall I send the photo to this phone?"
..." and his orgasm crashed over him like a force of nature. He ejaculated, pulsing and shaking hard, onto the leather of the couch. His back arched at first, then bent forward, and the last sputter of his climax landed on the seat cushion.
, of course! What else?!"
"You can take it, can't you?" John asked, patting Sherlock lightly on the cheek in order to gain his attention. "You can take it... for me... because I want you to..."
- poems about Crieff and the poet McGonagall
“Do you remember that meeting two weeks ago? When I was late and didn't want to tell you why? And you automatically assumed it was something filthy?” John asked in a challenging manner.
This is what a
An icy lump formed in John's stomach and cold sweat ran down his back. He ran his tongue over his lips. His mouth and throat were bone dry.
As the waves of his ecstasy receded, he became aware that Sherlock was still all but crushing him, yet he was holding himself completely still and quiet. And then he felt the soft lips on his throat. Utterly calm, utterly silent, his pulse beating against them, and he realised that was what Sherlock was looking for. His pulse. A confirmation that he was all right. Then a chaste, fleeting kiss on his neck, a whisper of “John?” that hit John in a spot deep in his soul that he'd never wanted to allow to be a target again, not for the rest of his life.
"He wouldn't dare!" he gritted out between his teeth.
For a few seconds following their kiss, a veiled, distant look lingered in those fascinating, pale eyes, but then Sherlock's gaze came into focus once again, becoming alert and attentive. Sherlock folded his hands on the arm of the chair, rested his chin on them, and peered at John intently.
With a faintly queasy feeling in his stomach, he forwarded the photo to Kitty's phone. Either way... he'd soon know for sure. He hoped.
"No, I'm not," Irene agreed calmly and set her champagne glass down. "If you'll come with me, we can sort out the details better in my office."
"Yes," Sherlock answered carelessly, his mind already elsewhere. He didn't intend for a single second to keep that promise. "Did John say anything else?"
That hesitation and denial hurt Sherlock more than he cared to admit, especially after the last few days and nights, when John had been so full of praise for him.
"I've..."
Frustration gnawed at John, dug into his gut and fed his aggression and anger until he didn't know who to direct it at. The worst part was that deep-seated sense of failure and wretched helplessness - because there was nothing, absolutely nothing he could do tonight to change the defeat into a victory.
“That's what you wanted to tell me?” Sherlock murmured against his shoulder. He sounded sleepy.
I have to admit I used this source to describe "Air":
brother.
"There's really no keeping secrets from you," John noted somewhat glumly.
"Oh God," Sherlock groaned. "OH MY GOD!" He let his head fall back with a dull thump onto the table. His chest rose and fell in rapid sequence and his erection twitched, but no more fluid escaped.
- he managed it. Because it didn't take more than a single thoughtless shift to provoke a thrilling flare-up in his nerve endings, which generally caused a partial erection.
At some point, he got up and went to his bathroom.
What was the saying? Be careful what you wish for … because you just might get it...
"No, no... it's... it's all right... it's just... oooohhh fuuuuuck..."
“Could it be that you're bored because Doc Watson hasn't been here yet today?”
Miss Adler's house wasn't one of those cheap, tatty dives you might find in Soho or other areas of London. The rooms were high-ceilinged and full of light, and decorated with elegant furnishings, some of them antique. In addition to the large reception room, there were several more intimate lounges, where employees could sit down for an informal tête-à-tête with potential clients, and of course the upper floors contained bedrooms equipped according to the varied tastes of their guests, each with a large, comfortable bed.
It was neither Wednesday nor Sunday when John – following a whim - directed his driver to take a detour past Miss Adler's house.
?" Sherlock asked with a hint of mockery. "You can start your
"Now, now..." John mollified him. "We haven't even started properly yet... How does that go again? Are cigars really rolled between the thighs of beautiful women?"
"What do you think? Are you steady enough to clean up yet?" John wanted to know, pinching his nipples lightly.
John didn't know what he'd expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
John had arrived at Miss Adler's establishment quite early that day and pulled Sherlock across the bed without preamble, where he now lay stretched out on his stomach as John fucked him with slow, concentrated strokes.
"No no he won't come on." Sherlock hurried back to the waiting cab and put Katherine in Sherlock looked up at the clock tower, Big Ben seemed much brighter than it had before Katherine's friend.
"Why? so you can pull some complicated military maneuver, steal my gun and not have to worry about me hurting her? John I think you know that i'm just a bit smarter than that." Moriarty said John sighed couldn't blame him for trying now could you? John went up the stairs into what must have one time been a freezer because it was much colder than the rest of the building when John was sitting down on a box Moriarty had one of his henchmen keep a firm grip on Katherine to make sure John didn't try anything and that she didn't escape again.
Lestrade sat in his office building a house of cards with Rosie, a case had come up and Sherlock had dropped her on him unannounced at work on his way to pick up John but there was no way that she wouldn’t be safe, after all she was in the middle of a police station.
"Delete that!"
“I’m sorry daddy I had to save you, I knew they were bad ladies the minute I figured it out and Greg wouldn’t let me.” Rosie said to him John looked at her for a long moment before shaking his head and sighing
So much for that brilliant plan of his.
"D-don't cry i'm your father's flatmate John Watson, Katherine where are you?" John asked her "It's very important that we come get you right now."
"Six" John was suddenly very puzzled and looked down at Katherine
"You're another friend of my dad's aren't you?" Katherine asked Molly looked a little confused as she looked at John for an explination
"Go away!" she shouted sitting on the floor with her hands over her ears there was a brief pause before she heard it again
Victim #2
"Sherlock, I need to ask you something important and I swear I will not tell anyone so long as you're honest with me." John said to Sherlock
Lestrade's phone rang, Lestrade answered but handed it to Sherlock
"Daddy?" Sherlock's thoughts of anger and fury were diminished like water being thrown on a flame when he heard her small voice calling him and he was just relieved to know she was alive at least.
"Lestrade has Aspirin in his office," Molly called without looking up from where she was helping Katherine
Sherlock could see the flashing lights from the window of the apartment that he and Mycroft had been instructed to wait in. Mycroft sat at the table tapping the tip of a pen to a table, a nervous habit, sherlock observed though he couldn't decide if he was worried about Katherine or his job being on the line. Sherlock assumed more the later, if he really cared about Katherine he wouldn't have shipped her off to boarding school at four years old.
Molly knew right away she had been drinking wine, she remembered one night when Sharon and her brother had been dating that after a couple of glasses of wine Sharon had been this rude bitch and her mother had slapped her after she insulted Molly to her face, this might work in their favor though.
"Don't you dare tack that motel again!" Irene frowned and put the tack back down as John walked tiredly over to the phone he picked it up falling into a kitchen chair as he did
"I believe Sherlock solved the case of her missing Aunt, her husband had murdered her for the money I'm afraid so she owed Sherlock a favor." Mrs. Hudson said to him
years since Mary had died and left him alone with their little girl. John and Sherlock were on Better terms now, the situation having been explained and everything back to the way it always was not to terribly long after Mary had been gone (It took John a year to be able to sit in the same room with Sherlock long enough to hear what had happened)
"Daddy?" she called worriedly but Mrs. Hudson came in quickly and smiled at the little girl
"To think that, he of all people has a child! Shouldn't there be a law about people like him reproducing? limit the number of sociopaths and nut cases there are-" Anderson stopped when he found John glaring daggers at him
"I beg your pardon?"
"A lot of things but I assume you're referring to the knowledge I know that relates to this." Irene said to him placing her cup down on the table John sighed and nodded
"John We both know that you'll post it to your blog eventually, when you do I want you to also write why and be sure to write the entire story not just what you think you know and if I do tell you....I hope you don't think any less of me now."
"i'll be back in time to tuck you in Rosie, I promise." John told her before he left. with that Molly and Rosie headed back to the kitchen and returned to the project
But now as he had been picking up some supplies for Rosie's school project for health class (Molly had agreed to help her on reconstructing a human brain using vegetables) the woman that had been behind him in line had started flirting with him and even asked him out for Saturday night! He had a date with a beautiful brunette with the most dazzling eyes and what he could tell was a lovely person and he couldn't think of much else for the moment! Well one thing he wasn't going to do was tell Sherlock that was for sure but at the same time he felt like he was forgetting something. What could he be forgetting?
"How did you get her out of here with out anyone knowing?" Moriarty shouted over the line. Katherine was gone? How could that be possible? where could she have gone?
"The police will be here soon I already told Lestrade to bring an ambulance so I hope they'll make it here too" he explained to John.
Sherlock's been arrested, John's trying to get through to him
"Inside the box, some of the contents should include your wife's wedding ring, a letter to Katherine from her, a letter from you as well just in case anything were to happen to you on a case, and some secret files that you two were going over for Mycroft at the time of her death."
"I don't know, that's why I started to ask you where she was and you just appeared" Sherlock said to him just as frustrated as Mycroft was.
"How are you feeling?" John looked down at her for a moment not understanding until he realized she was referring to the last time they had met, he offered her a small smile
Lestrade does a horrible job at babysitting and Rosie memorizes Sherlock's contacts.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, can you tell him please? I need to talk to him as soon as possible." John was just leaving the bathroom and Sharon knew she had to wrap this up
John struggles with how he views Sherlock, Mycroft busts Sherlock out, and the hunt for Moriarty is on
The phone was answered.
"Done!"
Rosie was a wonderful little actress and had been so excited that she got the lead she had made him promise to invite everyone! they all practically took up the entire front row. John, Sherlock, Lestrade, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and John's sister Harry. John couldn't take his eyes off of his little daughter as she stood up in front of everyone and was the perfect little Alice for her school play, failing to notice the other set of eyes that continued to glance at him from his left belonging to his long time friend and Flatmate Sherlock.
"No of course not! I just didn't picture you as a father to such a sweet and adorable child." Sharon said leaning down so she was level with Rosie, Rosie sensed that he woman was going to try to hug her and took one giant step back away from her Sharon frowned and stood back up forcing a smile on her face Rosie didn't like her, her lips were faker than the dolls that sat in Rosie's room, her face covered in so much make up it put mime's to shame and the perfume she seemed to have bathed in was a disgusting odor but John didn't seem to notice as much as Molly and Rosie did.
"I think when I get back to school I'm going to have to start seeing my therapist again." Katherine responded with a frown and John couldn't help but laugh at the completely straight face that the little one had on while saying it, the look was so purely Sherlock that he couldn't help himself. Katherine looked up at him and smiled
The words echoed loudly in John's head and he turned around to Lestrade who had been heading back to his squard car "Sherlock's near here." he said suddenly this alerted Lestrade a bit
hey you guys! i might not be able to update much this week because It's MS week (my mother has Multiple Sclerosis) and i'm doing a lot of volenteer work, plus i'm starting a new job and seeing a concert so i'm gonna try and update as much as I can however no promises sorry.
John and Irene had been at it ever sense they had figured out the safe deposit box mystery and now they were trying to track down where they could be. Which was easier said than done. Moriarty did have a lot of connections after all and the possibilities of where he could hide were endless, where Mycroft and Sherlock were hiding however could be narrowed down because if they were working together they'd have to tolerate each other enough to be hiding together, which limited their agreeable places however this may also have caused quite a bit of tension between John and Irene.
"What's all this then?" Sharon asked her voice this obnoxious nasal tone that made Rosie want to shove cotton in her ears
“Hello Auntie Irene,” Rosie said happily Irene smiled back at her taking off her overly large sunglasses, so she could see her better
Serina and Katherine are owned by me everyone else is owned by BBC or Sir Arthur Conan Goyle. have a nice day hope you enjoyed
With that he hung up the phone and went to join Mycroft
"What have you done to Katherine?" John's next question was Moriarty chuckled
John glanced up at the gorgeous woman across from him, her stunning green eyes (likely contacts,) looking back at him as she twisted one of her blonde curls (likely dyed that color, dammit sherlock!) around her fingers John gave a faint smile
Sherlock hung up instantly and looked at John
"Boys!" Both men stopped as they looked up to see Molly in the kitchen with Katherine, both in brightly covered aprons and covered in flower from head to toe "If you can't behave you'll go sit in your rooms until supper is ready!" Katherine called to them in a stern tone faking a serious parental tone. John laughed at the cute pout on the little one's face and even sherlock smiled at the sight of it
Sherlock smiled, clever girl. Sherlock took the phone and put it in his pocket to return to Anderson later
the line was refering to when Tybalt stabbed Mercutio, Romeo's best friend was stabbed while Romeo was trying to break up them fighting. Which would make John, Mercutio in this situation. Sherlock pulled his scarf away from his neck and pressing it to the wound in John's chest to staunch the bleeding
"Just try to make sure that the two of them upstairs don't kill each other alright?" John asked her Mrs. Hudson nodded then helpfully gave him a few places that were child appropriate John wasn't sure if it would interest Katherine but he'd give them a shot. when Breakfast was over John took Katherine out, first stop was the playground.
"Don't worry Sherlock, We'll find your lost kitten."
“Sherlock?” she asked Sherlock turned to her as her eyes drifted shut
"I love you."
"Ok daddy, I promise I'll be brave"
"You can't seriously be allowing this?!" Anderson shouted as he watched Molly show Katherine how to work the microscope that was examining a piece of human tissue and helping the little one adjust it, Anderson was currently over reacting and John just sat out of the way examining some other of Molly's experiments and research
"Katherine was at the wrong side of the park to be able to be heading to Bakers street like she always has done when she's run away, that means that she either was a lot more lost than she thought she was or that once I told her that Sherlock wasn't at Bakers street she headed in another direction knowing exactly where he could be!"
"or" john interjected "he has eyes watching them in which case he would also probably have people watching us and that means that-" John was suddenly cut off by the ringing of the house phone John paused for a moment "and apparently that's all the time we have." he said sarcastically before he walked over to the phone Irene picked up the tack
"Thank you, but i'm not sure if you can."
John looked surprised to see that there were no experiments, no rotting of corpses or human eyeballs just tea.
"Katherine where are you? how did you get out of there?" Sherlock asked her Katherine paused for a minute Sherlock assumed she was taking in her surroundings in an attempt to figure something out, he waited impatiently for her to reply to him
Katherine stayed in the phone booth for a while, looking around at her surroundings what could she do to find her dad, avoid Moriarty, and not get caught by her uncle? the phones were tapped she knew that so she couldn't call anyone else. she looked down at the wallet she had swiped from one of Moriarty's guards she had to stay in the area hiding wasn't going to be a problem as far as she could think she could just stay in the phone booth until someone else needed it. Katherine sat on the floor and waited anxiously now regretting giving John her picture.
"Of course not! I've been with John rereading Romeo and Juliet for the millionth time trying to figure out your sad little game!" Sherlock said it dawned on him then Katherine was gone. She was somewhere in London by herself having just outwitted a serial killer.
That was until Sherlock’s face lit up with a smile
"If you wouldn't mind could you take the long way back? these two haven't seen each other in quite a while." John asked the Cabbie as they took off the cabbie nodded and took a turn that wasn't normally the route, John didn't mind though he knew the more time Sherlock had with Katherine the better.
Powder to make her seem pale,
as if seeing the wheels turning in John's head Mrs. Hudson seemed to realize something he did not for she started to laugh a bit
Mycroft had gone off to investigate using his best resources to find Katherine and Moriarty.
a damp cloth to make her forehead warm and sweaty
Sherlock's next words were something very important and he made sure it was crucial that no matter what happened his daughter knew this above all else.
"We'll have it framed when we get back to the flat, she must like you if she added you into the picture" he said slightly amused John laughed
she wondered if he was alright, she should have used some of her time on the phone to ask her dad that. she heard the sound of someone knocking on the phone booth she could see a man on the outside in a suit with a briefcase, Katherine was about to open the door to let him use the phone when he spoke
after the fifth boarding school kicked her out Mycroft sent her to a school in America, where one of the teachers, Miss Carol E. Nicholas owed Sherlock a favor. She took on writing the letters for Katherine and helping the young girl, sending Sherlock pictures and notes that I found out Sherlock hid in a secret compartment in the back of his closet.
“We’ll talk about this tomorrow then.” John said shaking his head “Lets just go home.”
“If you ever need some girl talk that doesn’t involve murder sweetie you know my number,” Irene told her before she looked at Sherlock
"I'll see you soon Katherine alright?" Sherlock told her Katherine nodded and hurried out wanting to get her things as quickly as possible Sherlock stood and shook hands with Mycroft before he went into the kitchen no doubt to start cleaning out the freezer.
“John?”
enjoy! ~
"Don't worry, I've survived worse. course i've also survived better." sherlock actually smiled a little bit and nodded agreeing with him
"Mycroft won't be happy that we took out his friend to get to Katherine,"
"You're not serious are you?" Sharon asked him incredulously "You're not actually buying this? John the girl doesn't like me she's obviously faking it so you'll want to leave." John was already getting the bill from the waiter though not really listening to what this woman had to say
“When’s daddy coming back?” Rosie asked adding another card to the castle and doing her best to balance it, Lestrade wished he knew as he added yet another card to balance out hers
"JOHN!!" Sherlock hadn't even bothered to keep his voice level and calm as he usually did he hurried up the stairs and found the door locked "JOHN!" Sherlock went through his pockets, fumbling with the lock pick he had borrowed from an evidence bag he had followed on the way out, there were plenty of other things that could have convicted that criminal any way, He got the door open and wasted no time getting inside.
"Because you won't go any where, you want to find out what Sherlock is hiding just as much as I do," John said as he looked over the board pulling the tack out for what felt like the fifth time as he scanned the board with his eyes trying to think "It must be important of Moriarty wants it out in the open."
"you're missing a vital detail in that description." Moriarty said to him with a laugh Sherlock heard what sounded like the click of a gun being loaded he racked his brain quickly before realizing
"Yes, my teacher reads our blog to me a lot she leaves out the especially scary stuff." Katherine told him so she wasn't a complete Sherlock Mini-me, that was good at least for now.
Mycroft hired a Nanny to care for Katherine while he worked and from the time she could read street signs on her own she had been running away and going home which to her was 221B Bakers street. This obviously would cause many problems for Sherlock and the first time she did it Mycroft accused Sherlock of kidnapping and all ties to Katherine were forbidden. But Katherine kept running no matter what Mycroft did and the Nanny had even gotten into just helping her write letters to Sherlock, when those started to be confiscated The Nanny had them addressed to Mrs. Hudson and considering she was friends with Mrs. Hudson as well it went over their heads for a while, they could take the leters from Katherine, they couldn't take them from the Nanny though. For Katherine's fourth Birthday approximately eight months ago now, Mycroft sent Katherine to a special boarding school thinking that perhaps that would get her to stop her from running away.
When the play was over Rosie quickly got out of her costume and ran out into the lobby to meet up with her father, she first spied Molly and Mrs. Hudson both of which hugged her tightly and congratulated her on a job well done, Lestrade had even gone as far as to bring her flowers some pretty white lillies that she had always loved and she thanked him for them. Rosie spied Sherlock on one end of the room but her father wasn't with him, which was puzzling and she did notice how his eyes didn't move on whatever they were focused on. Normally the detective would be observing and watching everyone and everything so it was unusual to see him so focused, Rosie followed his gaze and spotted the problem immediately as a frown made it's way to her face.
"Um I-I don't know it's really dark and and scary" John could never imagine that the daughter of Sherlock Holmes was afraid of the dark but he did suppose she was still a little girl and every child at one point or another was afraid of the dark, however now John was having a hard time figuring out how to get her back on track
also! despite the ending this is not the end of the story!! for those of you who haven't noticed that while John and Sherlock have shared their moments I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE SHIPPY STUFF YET!!! so please stay tuned for the fluffy cuteness that is two men and a child!
"Firstly it is not a dingy dark motel, it's actually extremely well kept, and how
"Hello" Moriarty's voice rang through the phone Sherlock could practically hear the arrogant, insane smirk in his voice
Oh no, this was not going to work. Rosie was not going to let this blonde woman with the false smile and fake boobs thread her father along when the love of his life sat just a few feet away obviously restraining himself as usual.
Jack March aka Jim Moriarty.
"How did you do it?" Moriarty's angry voice came from over the line, Sherlock was more than a little confused which stunned him he always understood.
"Irene left when she figured out that I'd be coming here looking for you, smart girl, wish i could say the same for you." Moriarty said to him John sighed he wasn't in the mood for Moriarty's games right now! he just wanted to get straight to the point because he was tired it had been the longest night in a while and John just wanted to forget it.
"Can you take us to clock tower?" John asked the cab driver at last it clicked and Sherlock looked at John
“In summary? Irene just stole our dates who were lovers who enjoy playing the jealousy card involving strong men, hence how they would know Lestrade and why they would be interested in us. A common lovers game to spice things up in the bedroom really.” Sherlock said shaking his head a little bit John was baffled and looked at Rosie who just smiled at him innocently
Katherine nodded and Molly looked at John
“Yes Mariah is a client of mine and Tiffany is a dear friend that I passed her off to when I realized that I didn’t fit her particular tastes.” Irene said this now drew John’s attention as both women went a bright shade of scarlet and glanced at each other Rosie attempted not to giggle and look as dumbstruck as John looked
“I didn’t lose her she has to be here somewhere.” Lestrade tried to justify quickly as John groaned why him? Why did these things always happen to him? He knew why, and the reason was standing next to him and constantly was filling his daughter’s head full of ideas.
For the first time in a while Sherlock was baffled by the statement, did she know? She had to of. Sherlock at last let another small smile grace his features as he shook his head
"Katherine!" Katherine opened her eyes and there he was, John was at the door now the man from before was on the ground and her father stood over him being sure he wasn't getting up any time soon. Katherine quickly unbolted the door and hurried out first she hugged John since he was the closest to her, John picked her up and quickly handed her off to Sherlock
