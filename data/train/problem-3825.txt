“Stop it!” Castiel screamed upset. What surprised him...was Dean who stopped leaning in to kiss the maintenance man to look at him. Dean...had listened to him? Dean looked at him tenderly like...he was worried about him? Castiel let out a relieved breath as Dean moved his arms away from the man he was holding in his arms.
“DEAN!” Castiel called holding himself from the cold.
“Cold? It’s like hotter than the sun.” He sat up looking down at her as she blinked up at him. “What are you on about, princess?"
“I bet he thinks we should have been there by now.” Castiel teased.
Castiel...hadn’t realized he was so wet. Slick wetting his hole, he never...been like this before. Even in his heats, it never compared to this. Every fantasy was with Dean and never...never this intense.
“I can’t even tell you who she made the deal with, even with our deal, even if I wanted to-” Dean explained.
A couple of things knocked off the table as Castiel broke the kiss to kneel quickly between his lover’s legs. Pressing loving lustful kisses against Dean’s inner thigh teasingly.
“Of course, but you are cutting it short,” John explained as Dean nodded.
“Not if I eat you first.” The other man spoke taking a seat near their tree, their back to the entrance of the hole. Sarah wondered if she risked coming out the front, the only way out, or did she risk digging her way out the small opening and out the backside of the tree. Sarah knew it was suicide to go out the front, if they noticed the hole they would check. She needed to run. She needed to dig her way out the back. Sarah raised her paws trying to quietly dig. One of the men raised his head at the noise.
“If I’m late I might actually have a divorce coming.” Dean snorted as John smiled.
“You don’t have to keep some lady’s dying wish you didn’t know.” Claire chewed on another fry.
“Promise me you’re okay,” Gabriel spoke. “I know you have been obsessed with demons for years-”
“Important enough for Castiel to want rights to keep you,” Chuck stated still reading.
“Cas?” Dean turned as Castiel tossed off his coat and kicked off his snow boots in a hurry. “What are you doing here? I’m sick.” Checking his phone as he moved to Dean.
“What does that mean?” Dean asked curiously.
“One shot?” Castiel asked as John beamed innocently. “Why do you get one shot?”
“Who would want this kid dead?” Michael asked. “Everyone we talked to loved him. He took his coworkers shift, he spent more of his time studying and even volunteered at the hospital to hang out with his brother as a candy striper.”
“Sam, Gabriel.” Dean breathed holding Castiel close. “...We know of your affections to each other, and after careful thinking have decided to allow your mating claims. Sam, as your master. I approve of this with all my heart and soul. May he make you happy.” Sam wiped his tears he didn’t mean to start crying but he did. Sam...was so happy. Gabriel took his hand squeezing it as Gabriel felt himself starting to cry too.
“Yeah…” Dean eyed his face before he turned to lay on the fin looking around with Castiel. “Some perks of the dead...” Dean breathed looking at him.
“...I know,” Gabriel stated. “It was like-”
“Anyone else?” Michael asked.
“Royal blood,” Dean explained. “Royal blood is black and has agents to keep them living forever. Normal demons have red blood, it doesn’t have the same properties.”
“Please keep us up to date.” Benny softly placed his hands on theirs. “And If needed I can take a loan out for a reward or-”
Castiel got dressed in boxers before climbing in bed with Dean, Dean instantly rolling to curl into him. Castiel sucked in air wondering if this was a dream as Dean laid his head on his chest. Castiel held him so tightly, so afraid this was a dream till he unwillingly fell asleep.
“Hey, we are here.” Dean breathed snapping Castiel out of his half-asleep daze. Castiel felt Dean take his hand and pull him off the bus when it stopped. Castiel allowed Dean to take the lead as he brought them to the city moving through the busy street without care.
Castiel moved to him, the second he was close enough for Dean to touch...he did. Pulling Castiel into his lap holding him close, his hands cupping his ass. Castiel blushed to be naked in Dean’s lap, Castiel took in his lips before they kissed. Dean kissed back without hesitation, their lips moving easy and slow against each other. They couldn’t stop smiling into the kiss as Castiel cupped his face holding him close.
“Gordon, calm down,” Gordon spoke to himself. “These are normal people and this is normal-” Gordon’s thoughts stopped when he noticed two twin boys holding hands at the end of the hall. Gordon took in the small blue-eyed boys with the coldest stare. It was like something out of a horror movie. He recognized them as Dean’s younger twin brothers but...they stared so creepily at him that Gordon swallowed.
“Daddy? Where are we going?” Leo asked as Dean innocently looked away like he wasn’t curious as Castiel pushed a stroller of two kids, and Dean pushed the other two. The girls were happy and giggling as Castiel walked down towards their private jet. Castiel eyed Dean, who was pretending not to listen.
“It’s selfish. I know...but god Cas. I...I can’t…” Dean swallowed before he sat up to lean over Castiel letting out a shaky breath before he kissed him.
.” Dean confessed as Castiel pulled back in surprise. “...Normally we could never dance with each other...but tonight...tonight I am just Dean...and tonight you are just Cas.” Dean slid on his mask with a soft smile. Castiel stared at him for a long time just eyeing his face before Castiel leaned in again and kissed him. It wasn’t lustful like it was before. It was soft. It was love. It was an omega wanting to dance with his alpha. Dean eyed him with care once Castiel pulled back to climb off of him fixing his top.
“Y-Yeah.” Eve nodded confused. “W-...Why?”
Dean looked really nice dressed in historical clothing, Castiel’s eyes always seemed to fall on Dean when he entered a room. Here Castiel was throwing a ball in his home when he never thought he would. Dean said he was ready to try dating in the real world. Castiel held a glass of liquor when Dean came in. Dean looked...unrecognizable. Dean smiled seeing him as Castiel grabbed a glass of whiskey holding it out for Dean which he took.
“...” Castiel said nothing sadly moving away from him.
“You can even get married and have a family,” Dean explained. “Just like you could with a woman.”
“Please, let me accompany you for your safety,” Roman spoke. Castiel bowed his head lightly before heading off the ship with Roman behind him.
Castiel loved his noises, loved the gasp of pleasure, almost as much as he loved the sound of the headboard that pounded against the wall with each thrust. Castiel knew he should have been gentle with the witch that was taking him so well. However, Castiel knew he couldn’t. Not when he made the most delicious moans.
“Come.” Castiel panted gripping Dean’s neck a bit tighter as Dean moaned. “Come, little witch.”
“Yeah, I can imagine. He’s...overstaying his welcome. I might need to start an eviction.” Dean coughed as Castiel laughed with love. Dean winced as Michael pressed the medication into the wound.
Don’t get too close, Dean.
“Alright guys, follow Gabriel to the next room.” The kids happily walked with Gabriel talking so excited about the sleepover. This means they showed up late at night, would be up all night, and sleep in the day in the demon world. They would go home tomorrow night. Gabriel was happy to see them excited as the kids talked their ears off, especially Sam with weird stereotypes the demon world who never was allowed to communicate with humans assumed. Castiel held his hand out naturally to welcome Dean into his arms as they walked to follow, Castiel held Dean’s lower back.
“I-I’m sorry, only Joshua would know how much longer,” Michael spoke.
“They might actually kill me for humoring you or kill you for knowing,” Dean mumbled as Castiel stopped writing to look up annoyed. Dean heard his pen click in his obvious annoyance.
Castiel turned to look over walking towards the forest beside the farmland, they walked in a bit seeing flower peddles inside a rock-lined path. They followed it to a large tree with beautiful hanging lights that made it look almost mystical. Castiel wanted to cry just looking at it.
“Then we should get a horse,” Dean stated going to grab the new clothes he bought, shoving his spare into their bag.
“Don’t you ever...just get tired with how...weak they are,” Crowley spoke. “Humans?”
“John-” Mary breathed keeling over in pain, blood and water slid down her leg as John continued to scream at Dean. Mary’s grip on the wheel loosened the car swerved the car going over the lanes of traffic before John realized they were driving out of control, they slammed into the railing front first. All they could hear before passing out was the slamming of metal connecting to metal.
Castiel...spent all those years alone in his room avoiding everyone...and now here he was. Castiel only spent time in his room when Dean or the kids were in there. Normally the boys loved to snuggle and watch movies before bed and Dean had...made it a habit to sleep in the master’s room more and more.
“...Yeah.” Castiel lied trying not to vomit again. “Though I might vomit again.”
“A nice man sold me Horse,” Castiel stated. “I never have seen a horse before.”
“Where are we going?” Castiel laughed.
Dean’s eyes shot open as he looked around finding himself back in Gabriel’s home in their bed. Dean whimpered at how bad his body hurt pausing to see his hands and body were cleaned and bandaged. Dean felt stitches in his hands from the glass in the van. Dean moved to force himself to stand but the door opening stopped him.
“Dean, you can’t.” Castiel tried but Dean had already taken the one but refused the other. Dean turned to lay down as Castiel sighed. Castiel put the medication into the pill bottle then closing it and putting it away. Castiel eyed him before kissing Dean’s forehead, leaving the tent. Castiel noticed his burner phone was ringing as he answered. “Mom?”
“They do that.” Everyone but the twins commented.
“I’m nineteen, I’m older than you.” Castiel beamed innocently. “How old can demons get?” Castiel asked.
“Hello,” Castiel stated trying to be friendly as he continued his running. The man keeping up despite his heavy boots.
“There’s a cave over here!” Balthazar called as Sam picked up Dean carrying him inside as Lucifer carried Castiel.
Michael pushed the police tape up, holding it for Lucifer, as they both returned to the crime scene with some more information ready for them. They walked over to the crime scene tech who was fully involved especially with checking for footprints and car tires imprints.
“Do...I have to?” Dean asked as Castiel took him in. Was Dean also scared when he zones like that?
Dean softly cupped his face and kissed him with so much care as Castiel softly kissed him back. Dean pressed their foreheads together as they softly held each other as Castiel cried himself out so grateful for his loving mate.
“...Savior would have been harder to beat though…” Dean breathed as Sam eyed him watching Dean fall asleep. Sam tucked him in before getting up. Leaving the door closed behind him as he left to work leaving Dean to sleep off whatever he took.
“-as?” Dean’s voice snapped Castiel out of his thoughts, Castiel turned to see Dean wet and dripping his smile laughing happily at him holding out his hand. “Sorry, I just wanted to get that out of my system.”
“Shopping spree,” Dean stated. “Figured you didn’t want to wear your tracksuit forever.” Castiel eyed him as he moved to touch some jeans.
“It’s okay, I’ll get a doctor right now.” Dean placed a hand on her shoulder before grabbing his phone. “It’s me, I need an ambulance,” Dean spoke to the phone as he helped Claire towards the street to meet the Ambulance.
“Dean- '' Castiel tried but Dean had already entered. Dean came out cradling what Castiel could make out as a thinned adult. Their body wasted away, the skin was almost dried to the bone...It must have been a while since they died. Dean laid them down on the ground under a tree. Castiel watched Dean bring out the bodies one by one. One woman, One man...one child...and a baby. Castiel turned away at the sight of the bundle of cloth that cradled the baby’s body. Castiel moved to the tree and vomited into the plants. Just...the sight of the baby...how horrible the fate for someone so young. Castiel couldn’t stop thinking of their child, the child they would have. How horrible the world was to bring them into.
“Your brother is
“Let’s get you all cleaned up.” Castiel breathed leading him to the bathroom. Gabriel took the comfort of the bath, barely realizing when Castiel left him alone for a while. Gabriel paused noticing he was alone for a while. Gabriel tiredly sighed transforming into the human, Gabriel got out of the bath himself moving to leave the bathroom. When...he noticed flowers leading from the door of the bathroom, outside to the fire. Gabriel hesitantly followed the flowers.
He...was
“Here. Put this on it. Stop the bleeding.” Dean spoke as Castiel placed the towel against his forehead as he laid back. “Sleep, I’ll wake you when we get there.” Castiel nodded softly closing his eyes, trying to sleep off his pain.
pack?” The dog mocked as She frowned again whining herself annoyed.
“Thank you.” Castiel nodded as he tied the herbs to the horse saddle Sam was now riding to carry Dean. Castiel leaned down kissing his mate with love one more time before Lucifer helped him up onto Horse.
“Thank you! I promise I will be good! I won’t be a problem! I can clean the gutters, small places, and I’ll even clean after myself and change Lilith! I-It would be like we aren’t even here-” Eve sobbed as Benny touched her hair with care. Crowley looked away in shame knowing this was a big decision he made in their relationship without them.
Dean was making a human cake for Gabriel, the boys were asleep and Dean had told Joanna that he was good to cook on his own. She was welcome to rest and Dean wanted to make it himself so he said she can enjoy her night. Castiel was busy most of the day with video meetings, so Dean wasn’t expecting to see him till bedtime. Dean put the last frosted flower he made on it before putting some excess frosting on his finger from the bowl and licking it.
“I-I can’t...you know I can’t,” Dean stated. “I could ruin the future if I stayed…” Castiel said nothing just holding Dean for dear life as Dean kissed his forehead as Castiel held him till Castiel fell fast asleep.
“Just some more information about you guys biologically,” Castiel explained. “It’s nothing serious.” Dean nodded not understanding that. Castiel snorted softly at noticing Dean didn’t know what he was talking about. “Don’t worry about it.” Castiel got up and put the envelope onto the side table with his keys for the next time he went out.
“Hi,” Dean spoke softly and kindly. “What’s your name, squirt?” The kid giggled and ducked quickly behind the clothes rack again. Dean went around the clothing rack, getting to the back of the clothes rack where the child would have been.
“Azazel!” John cried in fear as he cradled his broken nose, tears welling up in his eyes. Azazel...he couldn’t survive a fall from the banister...especially that hard. Mary held him as he cried, there was nothing they could do to him, especially with the sex tape.
“Why don’t we just switch up this design?” Sam asked confused moving it to Castiel who watched him curiously. “If we take this away and add one more of these. It should double the battery life. It should give you at least ten hours of battery life and keep it cheap on production.” Castiel nodded impressed as Sam looked at him.
“I’m going to take you out to see some sharks.” Dean beamed. “Who knows, maybe we will walk the bottom of the ocean for a bit. Check out some cool sea life.”
___________________________________________________________________________
“Mommy?” A small voice made Dean turn seeing Amber looking at Dean concerned. She was wearing her little light blue Pajamas with her little bear slippers holding her stuff bear. Amber looked at Dean concerned before her eyes slowly drifted to John. Dean tensed as he quickly got up moving to Amber trying to keep her eyes off John. He didn’t know what John was planning and he didn’t want him...scared of witnesses. Dean scooped her up, holding her as Amber touched his face seeing the blood. “Mommy, you have an ouch-a-me.”
“Come on, we are going to snuggle in bed and keep you warm.” Castiel took his hand, Dean didn’t object before they were snuggled into Dean’s childhood bed cuddling close. Dean felt his omega hold him, nuzzling him close. Dean’s hand moved to his belly caressing their child softly. Castiel warm breath against his neck softly lulled him to sleep.
“People will wonder where you are if the star of the show is missing.” Dean breathed shaky breaths.
“Please show them to their room, they are mated.” Castiel winked to Gabriel as the maid nodded. Sam and Gabriel blushing but didn’t argue as they were led to the room down the hall. Dean moved to follow her but Castiel closed the door in front of him stopping his path. “Not you, I request you remain closer.”
“Welcome, we have tons of fun stuff for you tonight. We have tons of yummy food, tons of fun stuff for you guys, including a movie when everything calms down.” Dean spoke.
The wolves were confused by large smoke in the distance, whispering in worry, wondering if it was a camp or a forest fire. Jody, however, noticing the smoke ran back inside to Bobby.
“We are going to need copies of that,” Lucifer stated.
Despite the one-sided mating, he wondered if Dean could feel this feeling of connection he never had with Dean before biting him. It was like Dean lived in his DNA and Castiel couldn’t be without him. The thought escaped him though as soon the lovers had fallen deep asleep in each other’s arms.
“Alright kids, line up and introduce yourselves,” Castiel spoke as the kids moved to line up, taking it a bit more seriously. Two of the kids started shoving each other because they both ‘were there first’. Castiel calmly moved the boys picking their spot which they respected but did stick their tongues at each other.
“I found a place, Master,” Sam spoke before he started to lead them towards the shelter. Dean took off his coat placing it on Castiel’s head to protect him from the rain, Castiel wanted to object but Dean already had walked towards the rain and was soaked. Castiel took the coat gratefully and followed after him. Dean followed Sam to an old run-down cabin in the middle of a dead field. Dean’s eyes slid over the signs of a long time ago farm.
“Where should I change?” Castiel asked.
Crowley stated as Eve looked down at her cleaned body. It’s been a while since she had been clean, they even put her in pajamas. Eve ran fingers over the soft cloth. It was clean too. She put her arm to her face sniffing the clean fabric.
“Thank you for your help.” Michael shook his hand right after, Benny then moved to open the door in respect.
“Like this.” Castiel moved to hold his shoulders before he moved to place his hand on Dean’s waist, slowly moving him around in circles in the room. Dean kept stepping on his feet but slowly got the hang of it. Slowly moving around till Dean drunkenly tripped over his feet knocking them into the wall. Castiel let out a moan of pain hitting against the wall as Dean caught himself with Castiel’s body both panting in surprise.
“I-I don’t know...the next crystal must be lost...I-I…” Michael looked around as Lucifer cursed as Castiel yelped in pain.
“Like what?” Castiel asked as Dean beamed.
“Hi, little guy,” Castiel whispered as John pulled a sunflower seed and offered it to the content hamster who chewed on it.
After a couple of attempts to make sure they weren’t followed, they drove into Dean’s family estate. There was a large gate, which was mostly to keep the family’s privacy as well as keep photographers from sneaking good pictures when Dean visited. Castiel blinked when a blonde woman came running out of the house as the car pulled up. Dean lit up as she waited for the car to stop before she threw open the door. Dean got out to happily embrace her, she held him tightly as Castiel got out the other side and went to grab their bags placing them on the ground. Castiel took in her beautiful blonde waves and dazzling blue eyes as she pulled back to cup Dean’s face.
“Just visiting the town on business,” Charlie started innocently. “Do you?”
Sam’s lips moved softly back against his in a soft and barely touching kiss, Gabriel should have pulled away. Should have stated that was a one time, friendship healing gig and that’s it. That’s what it was. Gabriel’s arms wrapped around his shoulder’s pulling him closer, Sam growled against the kiss. The alpha responding to the omega’s lust, moving on top of him. Gabriel let out a breathy moan just...allowing their lust to win over logic.
“I figured,” Dean admitted as Charlie pretended to be shocked. “If you weren’t so cute, I might have just rejected the request to meet.” Castiel turned to him amused, Dean...was flirting with him.
“I’m going to have to tell his brother.” Michael looked at Lucifer. “Mind a trip?”
“Not really.” Castiel sighed as Sam caught his hackysack sliding into his pocket.
“Sorry, I needed my coat. I’m heading out.” Benny saluted as he reached in grabbing the coat.
“Ouch.” Castiel laughed at the comment. “I get it, so I have a stick up my ass.”
“I-I’m not nervous, you are nervous.” Dean teased back as Castiel laughed, climbing on his own horse.
“I think we all get so wrapped up in our world that we forget the beauty and perfection around us,” Dean admitted. “To be honest, I wouldn’t have been here either if it wasn’t for croaking. In truth, I never had even been to the beach before it.”
a cop.”
“S-Stop being mean to her!” Gabriel spoke standing up stopping their laughter. “S-She was scared. It happens!” The kids nodded as Anna glanced up surprised. "It's not nice and you guys shouldn't bully her! Now tell her sorry!"
“I’ll explain it later.” Dean giggled to himself as Joanna came into the room holding some. Dean walked over plopping on a ‘Team Vampire’  that matched Benny’s...because...they are vampires. Get it? I mean, it’s made for some teen romance movie but who needs to know that. He just couldn’t resist the vampire merch for the vampires.
” Dean grabbed at his exposed hand, the second their skin touched, Dean felt…something snap in the man due to his power.
“...Why is Joshua so important?” Dean asked. “I’ve gone all this way and I still don’t know anything about him.”
“-Look at the time.” Castiel and Dean rolled their eyes laughing realizing she was going to bail to get them alone. Her plan all along.
“I did something to him.” Dean started.
“I do what I like. When I like it.” The demon took a seat on Castiel’s car hood. “...I don’t fear the king.”
“D-Dean, you can’t just touch someone there.” Castiel blushed violently pulling his underwear away from his grip.
“Helping me into the bed?” Dean asked with a soft smile as Castiel nodded.
“Sure...Please come in.” Joanna pushed the door opened, as Lucifer and Michael walked in. Michael looked around at the nice apartment. Good for a Yoga instructor micro-influencer and her husband who was a priest in the local church. Joanna was closest to Castiel, it seemed that Castiel knew Joanna since high school. Only meeting Benny last year, when Joanna and Benny met on Christian Mingle. They got married and had their child Alex.
_________________________________________________________________________
“...Stalks...you,” Castiel mentioned slowly.
Dean put a couple of hundreds into the tip jar before he noticed a woman shyly holding a pen and paper. Dean though always grumpy was happy to sign an autograph for a fan, Castiel turned seeing she was happily looking at the two. Castiel smiled and took the pen signing it for her after Dean. Castiel thanked her and walked away sucking on his sweet drink. The paparazzi went back to taking photos till Dean and Castiel got back to their car, Dean always making sure Castiel was in first before he got in headed back home. Dean cranking music on the impala as they drove back to the farm. Castiel took his hand as they drove, Castiel having to pull out his lollipop before he sipped on the mocha drink. Dean pulled Castiel’s hand up to kiss his fist.
Mary sobbed cupping his face.
“My bad.” Dean smiled at him.
“It’s good they are finally starting to get along,” Castiel stated.
“Hey.” The man panted trying to keep up with Castiel who shot him a confused look.
“Thanks.” Gabriel breathed thumbing for a smoke.
“Jody, I’m a little busy-” Bobby spoke as Jody shook her head.
“Claire, we have to go,” Meg begged her to leave. “The cops!”
“A day?” Castiel stated. “So you guys get promoted?”
Their next step.
. “...So...do you want me to name you?” Castiel offered.
“You know you’re just trying to get me in trouble,” Dean stated. “But never had I passed the opportunity to be yelled at by Sam.” Dean put his feet into the cold water beside Castiel’s feet. “Cold.”
“O-Of course.” Castiel nodded as John patted his shoulder before moving to find Dean.
Mary sobbed holding a shotgun in her hands.
“...I’m waiting for your shoe to drop.” Castiel teased as Gabriel chuckled amused by that. “Coming from a family like this, you got to be weird too.”
“My mate my nervous to come down, but he wanted to respect our tradition to welcome Booker into the pack. He was scared old prejudice would make me an outcast more than I was over who I chose to mate.” Sam stated. “I told him I didn’t have to worry about that, because I knew you’d accept them no matter what.” Bobby nodded softly nuzzling his grandson. Booker happily bolted to them, he was a sloppy runner and tripped over himself collapsing next to him.
Dean sat against the rental car as John sighed eyeing his son. Dean wasn’t dressed yet for the wedding. He knew the time was growing closer and soon he would have no choice but to abandon his plan.
“Well,
“I ditched those suckers for
“You just don’t understand.” Dean choked using the milk to try to keep it down. “...No one understands.” Dean stood roughly almost falling over from the medication he took, but Castiel moved to hold him up. Dean shook his head at the distortion holding his head.
eat humans.
“Oh, Anna!” Castiel spoke. “This is wonderful! It’s perfect!”
Dean recognized the most annoying as Gordon Walker, the scummiest of the paparazzi. He had no morals and would do anything for a scoop. Gordon got his camera into Castiel’s face almost hitting him with it. Dean shoved him angrily back as everyone scrambled for a photo of the reaction.
“I won’t reveal my sources.” Castiel beamed innocently as Dean squinted his eyes in suspicion. “...Why do you hate your birth celebration anyways?”
“It was wonderful. Thank you.” Castiel smiled. “Are you sure you don’t want me to pay for it?”
“Mother, go,” Castiel spoke ushering his mother worried he would change his mind. Castiel’s mother hesitated before hugging him again tightly. She was helped on her horse by Alastair, holding Michael close before giving them a look.
“M-Maybe if we kept riding a couple of hours but we don’t know how close we are to the end of this trail.” Michael choked.
“No, I don’t think it’s an infection, the wound looks clean,” Michael stated. “Why don’t we just give him some more cool air, we have been keeping him bundled pretty warmly. Humans can get pretty sensitive to change in temperature.”
“Sounds like we are in the same boat.” John beamed as she eyed him.
my people...Have a good day, Dean.” Chuck moved to walk away when some young teen knocked into him causing him to drop his drink and scatter the boy’s papers.
“Castiel, you shouldn’t be moving around,” Michael spoke as Castiel ignored him, grabbed a large rock from the ground slamming it into the cave. The wall started to crack and groan. “Cas?! What are you doing?!” Castiel started laughing as he hit the wall.
“He’s going to fight, if he wins he will have done his punishment and will be free,” Castiel stated.
“We saw the king,” Benny whispered with a smile as Joanna gasped.
“Wait, you went into the past as well?” Sam turned as everyone but Rowena looked confused.
“Holy shit.” Michael breathed in surprise covering his mouth. They had done it. They had found Joshua.
“No anna!” Gabriel spoke holding on to it for dear life, she yanked it free of his hand whipping her hand back to slap him. Sam moved in front of him taking the backhand to the face protecting Gabriel. Just as Castiel and Dean were coming down the stairs. Blood spilled onto the floor as Sam slammed hard against the floor in pain.
“He’s not sleeping.” Dean kneeled to look at the man. He was…beautiful, angelic even, especially when sleeping. He had Sunkissed skin but wasn’t blessed with the freckles Dean possessed. Had a little grown-out stubble, and messy black hair. He was beautiful without a doubt. Seeing his chest rise and fall. Dean leaned down brushing some of the Fae’s hair out of his face.
“Lucifer, catch. Lucifer, good boy.” Lucifer’s tail wagged. John moved to pet Lucifer.
“I am, it’s not here, Dean.” Sam breathed. “We’re going to have to leave it.”
“They deserve it seeing as they hunted all the meat,” Castiel stated with an innocent beam.
“Do you truly not know of your parents?” Chuck asked as Dean glanced up. “I think it’s odd they would just leave you without a guardian-”
Castiel sat on the beach watching Dean walking towards the ocean. Castiel’s feet in the sand as he watched Dean jumping and diving into the water coming up for air every so often when the waves spat him out. Castiel smiled watching Dean bobbing in the water before he looked down feeling the sand against his skin. The ocean was nicer now that he didn’t get cold. The ocean always was so cold, especially in winter where it was windy and currently snowing.
The machine yelled as Dean grabbed them, shoving them into his mouth, swallowing them before he softly collapsed into the glass. Holding the sink for support as he felt the first need to push.
Castiel turned to Benny his eyes glowing, Benny didn’t have time to react as Castiel rammed him through the side of the building.
Sam walked through the front door looking at the dried blood and shotgun in the front of the house. Sam closed his eyes with a pained sigh before he bent down retrieving the gun. Taking Dean, they went to get blankets. Getting clean clothes, drying and warming them. Sam sat on their bed holding Dean close as they shook from the cold. Sam rubbing Dean’s back as Dean slept so exhaustedly in his arms.
“Are you okay, mommy? I was worried. You seemed upset earlier.” Jack asked concerned. “Your heart went BOOMBOOMBOOM!” Castiel laughed at his cuteness.
“You have a nasty bump,” Crowley spoke sitting next to her, he got her attention causing her to jump. “But besides that and a sprained ankle, you’ll live.”
Gabriel’s car skid on the road trying to follow the van, Castiel was in worry shaking the car with every movement of his body.
“Cas, don’t talk like that.” Dean breathed upset as Castiel nodded understanding.
The house was too big, he couldn’t hear anything. No reply. He listened to the house groan and whine from the movement on the old floors. Dean checked the nearby rooms seeing signs from the old owners, old couches, old decorations. Left to rot just like this place. Dean looked around a bit before he eyed the large rounding staircase to the second floor. Dean breathed to himself a mumbled okay before heading up the stairs to check the second floor when he felt the cave under him.
“It fucked up my parents after that,” Dean admitted. “They got obsessed with revenge, anger, and hate. Sam came into this world ignored from the start. They were too busy with a ghost then their living children. On my sixteenth birthday, they dropped us off at our godmother’s house. Never saw them again.”
_______________________________________________________________________
Castiel rubbed circles on Dean’s shoulder allowing the alpha of his hormones to calm down. Dean’s eyes were glowing red. He knew this. He knew Dean needed to calm down before he would let go. When Dean let go of his shoulder, he licked and tended to the skin. Blood spilling down Castiel’s chest as he shivered in the wake of his mating.
“Yeah, Charlie and Jessica. I met them when picking out pregnancy tests-” Gabriel stopped when Gabriel was kissed by Sam. “What?”
Gabriel was able to find the place he and Sam were earlier...there was blood...a lot of it. Gabriel felt like vomiting was this Sam’s? He couldn’t tell any longer, the smell gone...but lucky enough...there was a blood trail. Gabriel followed the blood to a cave a good distance away. Gabriel hesitated to go inside, hesitated to move. Remembering the darkness and the Wendigo...However, Gabriel entered. He needed to find Sam. He needed to make sure Sam...was still alive.
“By their eyes?” Castiel eyed him amused as Dean smiled leaning his face towards him. Dean and Castiel laugh at all the eye signals Dean was showing him by replicating them. Castiel didn’t think he had a better understanding of girls...but he did know Dean could make him laugh.
“See?” Castiel cooed to Atlas. “I told you I heard mommy waking up.” Dean sighed with a loving smile. Castiel walked over to help lay Atlas in his arms.
“Did I get my wish?!” The maintenance man hissed as Dean nodded slowly not looking at him. “Good.” The deal still happened despite Dean not consenting to the kiss?
“Please let us know if there is anything more we can do.” Benny started rubbing her back. “We just want him safe and sound. He was our family.”
“You’re lucky I ran into you...I had to learn this all by myself.” The man admitted looking down at his feet when he walked.
“Did I say party?” Charlie scoffed pretending to be innocent. “Oops.”
“So I didn’t miss it?” A voice made him turn to see Castiel covered head to toe in snow gear panting.
“Nose for nuzzles.” Sam breathed so happily. “Gabriel is going to be so happy.”
“We will give him to the sea,” Roman explained. “We will take him deep to sea, tie rocks to his body and allow the ocean to take him. There he will honor the goddess of the sea and give life to the creatures in her domain...We are a cycle, and we all must return to nature.”
“Gabriel, the love of my life.” Dean pulled back to cup his face. He looked at the cute pout with affection. “I will
“I’m sorry, Charlie. I’ll be right back. It might be Dean with setting up the before shots.” Charlie nodded moving to help herself to the catering that was waiting to be served. Charlie happily having some cheese as Stevie walked out of the house putting the phone to her ear.
Dean sat in the doorway of the cottage watching Castiel standing in the grass enjoying the cold night’s breeze. The fireflies lit the world around them as he just stared up staring at the stars. Dean grabbed a blanket walking over to Castiel, Castiel turned hearing the noise. Dean softly offered him a blanket but Castiel shook his head no. Dean took it, wrapping it around his shoulders.
“But don’t you want...” Castiel sighed looking back towards Dean, who was too ahead of them to notice. “Passion? A need, want, to crave them-”
“Hey, never thought I would be chased by cops.” Dean chuckled as he laid down next to Castiel just staring up at the stars. “Seeing I am one.”
“...Can you tell me more about the royal family?” Castiel asked as Dean shrugged.
___________________________________________________________________
Gabriel glanced up in shock taken back, he...hadn’t. Dean’s right, he should have. But he didn’t. When was his last heat? A month and a half ago?
“We will confirm, and then let you go.” Sam frowned as Gordon handed Sam the camera as Sam clicked through the photos. The room was quiet before Sam handed it over. “He’s good.”
“Oh no,” Dean mumbled blushing and chuckling burying his face into Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean closed his eyes as the drink hit him but before a fight could break out, their bodyguards and bandmates helped pull them away from the stage and crowd who were living in the drama. They went backstage in a private dressing room, they screamed at each other in case anyone was still watching, till they entered the private room. Their bodyguards gave them a nod closing the door confirming the two were alone. The second the door closed silence welcomed them from the world.
____________________________________________________________________________
“Change...right here?” Castiel looked around the store seeing a couple of customers shopping around, but it was late. They were almost closed.
“I love you too.” Castiel kissed his shoulder as Dean turned to nuzzle into him.
“What...What do you mean?” Crowley blinked completely confused. “We’re friends, Benny.” Crowley tried to take his hand but Benny pulled it back.
“...That I haven’t done it sooner.” Castiel breathed, Dean looked taken back but didn’t hesitate to kiss him back when Castiel pulled him back into a hard kiss.
“We need to be open to possibilities until we can rule it out.” Lucifer tried.
“Will you
He would be impure, he would be claimed...he would be Dean’s. But neither tried anything. Castiel wasn’t even sure if Dean even felt the same way, but he knew even if he did. Dean wouldn’t ravage him, wouldn’t kiss him...wouldn’t love him. Dean was just...too good. He wouldn’t dirty the prince. He wouldn’t force Castiel into the shame of loving a man of nothing.
“Of course, stupid.” Castiel breathed softly pressing their foreheads together as Dean just held him. Castiel wiped his tears pulling away from Dean. “Delete the video and you can publish the PG stuff. Show us that it’s PG and you can just go.”
“Let me have some more.” Dean hissed at the machine with gritted teeth. “You expect me to give birth to this baby in this cell with nothing for the pain?! At least give me a FUCKING fighting chance!” Dean panted angrily as he waited to see what his capturers would do. The dispensing machine clicked to life again dispensing three more pills.”
“Of course, you’ll be naked.” Castiel hummed about to kiss him but Dean blocked the kiss with his hand over Castiel’s face as Dean just sighed about to get up. “Y-You can keep your clothes on!” Dean smiled softly trying not to laugh at Castiel’s excited smile.
“Guys! It’s your wedding day, what are you guys doing seeing each other, It’s bad luck!” Mary asked, coming in as Dean got up to hug his mom.
Castiel was so grateful to Dean and his family, his parents...weren’t coming to the wedding. Castiel’s overly religious family didn’t approve of him marrying a man or coming out. Castiel expected this...but it still hurt. Castiel had no one but his bandmates coming and their families.
“God, you’re already so hard.” Dean hummed as he straddled himself over Castiel’s cock. Castiel blushed watching Dean taking charge.
“Okay,” Castiel spoke as he took a pillow and blanket to the couch setting up a bed for Dean. “Now go to sleep.”
“You know what? I
. “Any relation?”
“Benny, the police are here about Castiel.” Joanna sniffed as Benny moved to sit next to her comfortingly holding her hand.
“Hey boys, come see what I got you.” Dean pulled the new books from the bag, showing the boys the first two books of the Dean got to read to them. Dean always got teen books like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and things he would read a chapter a night to them. The boys loved the book nights, Every night Dean took this time with them. The boys happily looked at the books before Dean pulled out some coloring books for the boys.
“It’s just water.” Castiel laughed as Dean made a face at him. “Don’t be grumpy, we are going to be front-page again. Just in time for your new album, you’ll sell out.”
“Stevie, please do enjoy yourself as well. You are welcome to hang around and be part of the party. Just because we hired you, doesn’t mean we don’t want you to enjoy it.”
“I think a lot of people don’t realize…that the closest thing to hate is love,” Sam explained leaning back against the wall. “Being each other’s arch enemies…to have a connection like that…you have to walk a very thin line between the two.”
Crowley looked at him before he got up straddling Benny’s waist, Benny blinked in surprise staring up at Crowley.
“Yes. My mother was an Obstetrician, My father was a Cardiologists.” Gabriel admitted. “I’m a neurologist. I specialize in comatose patients. Castiel is in school to be a Cardiologist, like dad.”
Dean uncomfortably rubbed his belly his back killing him as the flight attendant offered him something to eat or drink. Dean took the menu being offered looking it over after ordering himself a sprite.
Bobby got to the place he knew to be his daughter’s cave. The smell of smoke thick. Blood covered the wildflowers that hadn’t been burnt yet. The wolves whimpered and sniffed knowing this wasn’t looking good. Bobby bolted inside the cave despite his second in command Gordon telling him it wasn’t safe. The cave was still smokey but most of the caves smoke had aired out. Bobby looked around at the things his daughter had called home. Tears filled his eyes looking for any sign of her. Any sign of his daughter...his...grandchildren...but there was none.
“It’s exactly how I imagined.” Castiel shook his head as Gabriel gasped looking around.
Castiel’s eyes moved to the scene before him, of Castiel saving Dean from the car. Their faces weren’t visible in the blurry footage but the news was talking about a secret Super living amongst the normies.
“I was trying to be subtle,” Gabriel commented as he moved to the fridge grabbing something to eat before coming to sit next to Dean.
“...We need to ride. Now.” Michael got up as Lucifer nodded. Whistling the others. “I’ll explain on the way, we need to hurry.”
“No, you look fine,” Dean stated as Castiel squinted his eyes at Dean suspicious of his comment, and went through his backpack for a makeup wipe. Castiel noticed makeup was still coming off as he handed Dean his glasses to wipe his eyes again as they walked out of the terminal.
“You couldn’t make up your mind.” Castiel sat up helping himself to the sweets in front of him. “We couldn’t make a great escape if you were taking forever, so I just decided to take everything.” Dean grabbed for a slice of pie biting into it as it spilled crumbs onto himself. Castiel shook his head seeing the mess Dean was making. “Use a fork!”
“W-What makes you think-” Gabriel asked.
“And then?” Dean asked.
“I think mommy has to deal with his guest-” Dean hesitated.
the time?” Sarah asked as John nuzzled against her with a soft bump.
__________________________________________________________________________
The demon just forced it open with his strength breaking the lock and the window. The demon blinked as Castiel breathed annoyed but it was obvious the demon was confused. Kneeling to look at the broken glass and up at the window. Had he never been in a human apartment before?
“...Is there any way I can break Gabriel’s mating promise?” Dean breathed in his ear as Castiel sniffed.
“It would be so much easier for us if he was.” Lucifer sighed. “However, I think you’re right. I don’t think it’s going to be that easy.” Michael opened the folder about Castiel glancing at his photo. One he borrowed from Gabriel for the photo, Castiel was smiling in the photo looking towards the camera.
“Scared ya!” She giggled.
Dean knew Castiel knew who they were. Even if Castiel was pretending not to...Chuck had told him.
“Oh, I-I’m so sorry, Mayor Chuck.” The teen spoke kneeling down as Chuck groaned at the coffee on his shirt for a moment splashing off his hands before kneeling down to help pick them up for the boy. Dean walked over to help when he noticed the teen stand as Chuck focused on picking up the papers with care. The teen looked at Chuck coldly before he pulled a handgun from his waistband pointing it executioner style at Chuck’s head. Chuck paused tensing as he heard the gun cock glancing up.
“Hello?” Castiel called but the music was way too loud. Castiel took a couple of steps in trying to call again but all in vain. Castiel sighed walking over to the cassette player pushing the stop button. The music stopped instantly as he sighed glancing around the apartment now inside and in silent peace. “Hel-...”
“Well, when I found out about our new employee a Mr. Sam Winchester from Lawerence, Kansas. I had to make sure before I earned a punch to my nose.” Castiel chuckled.
I ran from the cops.” Castiel snorted as he collapsed to lay in the grass.
“I recommend this one and...this one.” Charlie picked the ones she recommended as she handed it to him.
“How did you manage this?” Dean laughed.
Sam closed his eyes at the words that made him feel so good. He only opened them when he heard Dean reach over opening the door for him to leave the restroom. Sam paused before he licked Dean’s face with love. Dean smiled moving his face away as he chuckled.
“Why are we here?” Castiel asked as Sam sighed softly.
“The second I saw you, I knew you were everything I was looking for,” Stevie stated as Charlie smiled. “...I’d be stupid to ruin that.”
“Remember what?” Castiel spoke. “My past-?”
“You’ll be the first, after the dogs.” Castiel teased.
“Hi, Cas!” The boys talked over each other in happiness to speak to Castiel as Dean laughed till the message they could leave stopped recording them because they were leaving too long of a message. Dean sent it as the boys giggled.
“Yeah, I mean. My parents were all deep city people.” Dean commented. “The only time we ever did anything was when we went to the cabin just outside the city. My dad used to take me hunting out there all the time.”
“Tend to Sam, his baby teeth got knocked out. He will be okay. They were very loose anyways. ” Dean spoke moving to tend to Anna.
“You are PROMISED!” Castiel snapped worried as Gabriel tensed confused.
“I thought you said it was a party,” Castiel said after seeing her game.
“I’m sure plenty of people, it was a church convention or something with all the priests of the Mormon church. They do it every year.” Joanna waved them off.
“No...you smell so perfect,” Sam spoke instantly pulling Gabriel into his embrace so tightly, Gabriel might have complained if he didn’t completely love it. Gabriel went limp in his arms letting the wolf snuggle him.
“...I would appreciate it,” Castiel stated hesitantly.
“That’s so cute.” Castiel smiled chewing on the meat. “This is good, what is it?”
“Claire, Are you okay?” Dean asked as Claire cried weakly.
Sarah felt her lover nuzzling her awake the next morning as Sarah sighed turning her head to look at him. John looked so beautiful in the morning light, she loved the way the light went through the exposed roots.
“Hear what?” The second man asked when the man noticed the Den.
Adam’s screams made Dean shoot awake in a panic, shooting out of the bedroom he slammed straight into the giant fae himself who didn’t even budge at the rough hit. Dean, however, got the air knocked out of him and almost fell on his ass. Castiel fumbled catching him holding him to his chest for support. They panted against each other as they took a second to calm down their startling morning.
“I am,” Castiel stated.
“Stay here till I get back,” Castiel called glancing as Dean was leading the wolf Sam to the bathroom...by force.
“...but now he’s gone.” Dean breathed against him before pulling away. Castiel almost missed the warmth of the hug, forgetting the last time he was hugged like that. Dean crawled back into bed. “...There’s no use mourning the dead, especially since he didn’t care enough about us to stay-”
Sam stood up straight as someone shocked him firing the stun gun at him, Sam shook before falling to the ground letting go of Charlie who fell to her knees in fear. Dean and Gabriel turned to see Jessica sitting up collar-free holding the stun gun. Jessica’s nose was bleeding as she put the gun down moving to Charlie.
!” Gabriel screamed and growled. Sam’s eyes widened moving to pull his napoleon complex friend away from the pack. Sam barely got a hold of Gabriel’s sweater when the pack leader snipped at Sam biting hard into his ear. Sam whimpered as blood slid down his ear, another wolf slammed Sam down to the ground. Gabriel snapped out of his rage seeing Sam hurt. Gabriel’s breath hitched, turning away from the pack leader to move to Sam. “S-Sam!”
“Yes, um, I just tend to his son,” Dean stated. “Sam plays with him. So we stay up to keep him company since there are no kids allowed at the parties.”
Castiel ran down the ravine in his normal run, the sound of the ravine beautiful in the silent night. Castiel regretted not running before the sun went down, it was almost hard to see. Castiel paused to pull out his cellphone for the light but…he didn’t have it. When was the last time he had his phone? He couldn’t remember checking it all day.
“It’s fucking horrible out there,” Lucifer mumbled watching him like he was nuts.
Mary choked.
” Sam spoke. “
“You caused her premature birth.” John hissed as he choked Dean harder. Dean’s face was going red as he tried to claw his hands. “If it wasn’t for your perverted ways, she’d still be here!” Dean felt John let go as Dean fell to his knees coughing and gasping. John grabbed him by the arm yanking him up and forcing him to walk down the stairs. “You took her from me and you want to take Sammy? I won’t fucking let you.”
“...Night...Dean.” Castiel whispered slowly letting sleep overtake him.
it, god, it smelled so sweet. A wanting and desperate alpha. Castiel tried to chase the kiss again but Dean’s lips hovered stopping them from meeting.
“...” Dean nodded as Castiel smiled at him.
“I think I got a bit more energy.” Castiel smiled, taking Dean’s hand and pulling him towards the bed. Dean happily allowed Castiel to pull him towards him. Castiel happily kissed Dean’s chest. Dean’s hand moved to Castiel’s hair as Castiel unbuttoned Dean’s jeans, kissing down his body as Dean smiled down at him.
“Hi.” The boy smiled, he was missing a couple of teeth. His hair was a bowl cut of brown shaggy hair. Green eyes stared back into Dean’s who took in his little overalls and t-shirt. Dean kneeled to him.
Castiel was surprised after his bath that Dean had left the room, he could tell by Dean’s wide-open bedroom door showing his bedroom was empty. It was only when Gabriel was finishing helping him dress that Dean returned. Castiel’s eyes fell to Dean sliding something into his pocket on his arrival. Hiding it from view. He wanted to ask about it. Whatever Dean slid into his pocket the second he opened the door to see Castiel was out of the bath, Castiel didn’t know. Dean didn’t acknowledge them as he made his way to the accompanying room. Castiel wanted to speak to him, but Dean was already closing his bedroom door.
“We’ll find a way, Dean. We always do.” Cas promises. Dean looks at him, brow furrowed with emotion, something profound in his gaze, and he nods. They’re both exhausted, and Dean thinks Cas looks like he’s about to send him off to rest, but he can feel the unsaid things tearing through his head.
He prays to Cas too, mundane things like how he found Miracle on the side of the road one day, or about Sam and Eileen and Jody and Claire. He also prays to Cas about other things. Feelings he would’ve never been able to express to Cas had he been looking him in the eyes. He hasn’t said the words he means, he’s not sure he ever will, not without Cas to hear them for real, but he thinks if Cas could hear his prayers, he would understand.
Dean only nods. He’s been holding himself together. He’s been stone faced and stoic. He’s had enough. Sam has always said Dean could talk to him if he needed it, and Dean thought talking was bullshit. He can’t keep this in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yep.” Dean says, getting in next to Cas. He sends his best friend a wide grin and Cas offers a small smile in return. Dean pats his thigh before turning the key in the ignition and backing out of the parking space.
“Maybe,” Cas shrugs, content to sit here with Dean all night. “Are you?”
“I do.” Cas whispers.
“Why do you want that?” Sam asks. Dean glares at his brother, but Cas seems unbothered.
He fell from grace, he fell for Dean, he just keeps falling. And he knows Dean feels something more for him than what he acknowledges, but Cas doesn’t know exactly how Dean feels it, and he isn’t sure Dean ever wants to actually act on it, so he’s content to just exist beside him. Dancing around the living room with the man he loves, and it occurs to him that this is far more intimate than he had initially noticed.
“What about?”
“I’m coming to get you.” Dean doesn’t even hesitate, the car is already started.
Have a wonderful day <3
“I will. Don’t get yourself killed while I’m gone.”
“You’re gonna have to sleep here, man.”
Dean nods. He takes another sip of his drink, it’s almost gone now. She offers to refill it, but he shakes his head, sliding the empty glass with ice away. He doesn’t say anything for a minute, letting himself stew in self pity and anger and confusion. When he speaks again, his voice is rough and quiet.
But he’s here now and he’s not fucking letting it get away.
“I uh,” Dean clears his throat, hands tightening on the steering wheel. Cas straightens in his seat, like he knows what’s about to happen. Dean stares straight ahead. “I love you.”
They go on a hunt that day. A ghoul a few hours away. Sam and Eileen ride in the backseat together so Cas takes shotgun and Dean lets him pick the music. He puts on Dean’s top 13 Zepp traxx.
“I will survive, yes. But I’ll be human in a matter of weeks I think.”
“He’s in heaven. You should call him now, he will hear you.” Jack says, then he returns to his bowl of cereal. Dean stares in shock at Jack, the information hardly fully processed before he’s sending out a quick but urgent prayer for Cas to get down here ‘right fucking now’.
“What if we start with a nice dinner out.” Sam suggests.
“Cas,” Dean says, looking devastatingly happy. His grip on Cas arm tightens and Dean swallows.
In the car, Cas is quiet, there isn’t much to say, but he can see Dean’s tightened grip on the steering wheel and his glances in the rearview mirror. He feels like he screwed up. He had to let someone else save him again. He couldn’t heal a cut, he couldn’t smite an angel or demon, he’s human, in all the ways that count. The angel had been right, he was worthless to them, and although Cas knows they care about him, he’s much more useful as an angel.
“Do you wanna do it?” Dean asks him. Jack tilts his head at their names.
“What are you living for then?” Dean asks, surprised by Cas’ answer. He looks at Dean for a moment, evaluating the situation.
“Dean?”
“Cas is gone, Sam.”
thank you for reading! I hope to get the last 2 chapters out soon!! :)
Dean slips his arm around Cas’ shoulders easily, his heart pounding, but Cas simply snuggles closer, wedging his arm under Dean and around his waist. Suddenly it’s not casual anymore. It’s deliberate. Dean’s afraid to move, he can feel Cas’ chest rising and falling next to his own. After a few minutes, he relaxes, softening into Cas’ side. Eventually Dean switches the channel, trying to find something decent. But Cas takes the switcher and puts it back on Animal Planet. Then he turns the volume all the way down.
“With Cas.”
Cas makes to get into the backseat, but Dean stops him with a hand in his arm.
“It is.”
He already cried on this case. When the ghosts had shown up, taunting him like they knew who he was. Like they knew what he might become. Taunting him for being the same as them.
Chuck, it seems, is no longer a threat, and the empty has found itself at peace once more, though Cas would not have been able to rest there anyway, now that he’s human. He’s healed well, and he’s not the best hunter, but he’s decent enough.
“You will though, right?”
“I know…” Dean furrows his eyebrows at Sam, who sighs.
One afternoon, Cas is coming from his room to get a new book, but he stops outside the library when he hears Dean and Sam whisper-yelling.
“Good.”
“I thought… I knew he cared, I didn’t know.” Dean nods, everyone else had known. They could have had this. “He didn’t know either.”
“Okay,” Dean nods, taking in the information. “Okay. That’s okay.”
Dean and Sam were in a barn with machetes and vampires and they were winning. They had been winning and it was only a matter of time before the last of the vampires were dead and Dean and Sam would be in the impala, driving the kids back to safety. Just in time to answer their phones.
Cas’ face falls when Dean doesn’t follow Sam across the street. It goes blank of emotion when Sam motions for Cas to take the passenger seat.
He feels Cas’ pain like it’s his own and he sees Dean get into his car with a hopeful smile. He’s going to look for Cas.
“I’m proud of you, Dean.” He says, getting up. Dean gets up too, but only takes a few steps over to the fridge.
“I’m basically human, Dean. I’m human in every other way there is to be human. I eat, I sleep, I drink, I desire, I love. I don’t want to outlive my family. I don’t want to hear the voices of the few angels I haven’t gotten killed in my head. I don’t want to be hunted for my grace.”
“Oh.”
“Dean, are you okay?”
The one thing I know I can’t have.
He thought leaving, even if only for a few weeks, would save him some hurt. Maybe it would give him the space to get over Dean in his newly human form. It had all hit him at once and it left Cas feeling bare and shaken. Now graceless, he couldn’t control his desires, he couldn’t regulate his body the way he used to be able to. He couldn’t stop his cheeks from flushing when Dean smiled at him. He couldn’t stop his heart from jumping when Dean hugged him. He couldn’t stop goosebumps rising on his arms when Dean let his hand rest on his back.
“I know, but just... think about it. Wouldn’t you rather enjoy the time you have? You’ll regret it if you never even try.”
Cas is flighty and he always has been. The guy is gone unless they’re working a case, he’s back most nights for dinner and movie night, but in the morning he’s out again. Dean doesn’t know how to get him to stay. He’s not sure how to tell him that he’s welcome here. That he’s wanted here. Dean’s not sure how to tell Cas a lot of things.
"With a forceful kick, Sam is knocked across the room and the siren turns, stalking towards Dean with determination, smelling of rust and something sickly sweet that he recognizes from Mrs. Therein. The Siren doesn’t go for a physical attack right away, maybe hoping to get Dean off his game by spouting nonsense."
“I did well enough on my own.”
“What about Cas?” He looks at Sam and Dean.
“Hi!”
The entries become less about their hunts and cases and more about Dean’s personal life. Until one of the very last pages, one last documentation of Cas. This drawing of him isn’t shadowed and winged with a blade in his hand, he has on a cowboy hat and a smile and the title isn’t ‘Castiel’ it’s ‘Cas’.
“I know, Sam.”
A while later, they’ve both showered and changed and have moved over to Dean’s bed to watch TV since Cas’ bed still has rice in it.
“I’m aware.” Cas raises an eyebrow at him while he adjusts the trench coat’s sleeves.
‘I’m not sure whether you’re getting my calls, Jack sent me back.’
Over the next few days, they go easy on the hunts, only taking cases they know won’t take too much energy or require any angelic help. Dean takes Cas into the dungeons and helps him perfect his fighting. Cas has always been a strong fighter. He’s good with tactile fighting, even better with a blade, so really they spend most of their time on shooting.
“I thought you hated when I watched you sleep.”
Finally the night comes to a close and Mary says goodnight, heading to the spare room she often occupies instead of taking off to god knows where. Jack gives everyone hugs and promises to go to sleep instead of watching another movie and Sam packs up the leftovers.
“Humanity is so much more than exhaustion Dean,” Cas grumbles, still half asleep.
Finally someone picks up.
This is it for him.
“I like my memory foam though.”
Eileen and Sam are happy together. Eileen lives in the bunker almost ninety percent of the time, and it makes Dean sick with happiness for his brother and sick with grief all at once.
“Yeah well,” John shrugs, there’s nothing they can do about it. “Maybe he deserved a bit of a beating.”
“Cas was dead.” Dean glares at his brother. “He deserves shotgun.”
Sam pats Dean on the back, puts away the rest of the groceries and claps Cas on the shoulder on the way out. Dean opens the pie with reverence and digs in immediately.
“I cannot make that promise,”
“You make your own schedule.” Cas points out. He’s frozen in his place, still half under the covers, half out of bed.
As expected, Dean falls asleep a little more than halfway through the movie and he slumps over onto Cas, who doesn’t so much as take a breath until the movie ends. Once it does, he closes the computer and carefully puts it to the side. He’s not sure if Dean would appreciate him staying but Dean’s head is on his shoulder and it’s warm and Cas can’t bring himself to move, so he reaches for whatever book is on the bedside table and adjusts until they’re a little more horizontal. It’s uncomfortable to stay in this weird half sitting position against the headboard
“Yes well, things change.” Cas grins. “I’m human!”
“You deserve love, Dean.”
“You fucking better be.” Cas looks up warily and they’re just looking at each other for a moment, Dean wide eyed and almost crying for real now, holding desperately onto Cas. The sound of Dean’s phone fills the background.
He can’t draw, but he tries, and he ‘s sure he’ll find a picture of Dean somewhere to glue in. He writes too, it ends up more of a letter and he finishes it by adding his own promise to the bottom.
“Uhm, no, not for a few weeks, you aren’t with them?”
“Still, it’s true I won’t be as helpful, that was only proven today,”
“It’s ten PM.” Cas nods his agreement.
“I just wanted to remind you… if there’s ever anything you want to talk about, good and bad, I’m right here.”
All that’s left of dinner is dirty dishes in the sink, and although Cas feels as awake as ever, he knows it’s well past the appropriate waking time. There are nights when sleep feels impossible, when Cas could stare at the wall, or the ceiling, or the night sky and wish for his brain to put him to rest, and it would just never come. This is one of those nights. He suspects it is for Dean too. He’s too awake to go to bed, but he’s too exhausted to do anything but sleep. So he sits here at the table with a beer and Dean after everyone else has gone and he knows Dean will probably head to bed any minute now.
“Where is he?” Dean asks again. Would Cas even want to see him? If he’s been alive all this time why hasn’t he come down?
Almost a half hour passes and he sends a prayer to Jack. A simple, ‘humanity is well so far, Dean and Sam haven’t picked up, they’re, right? It's not me, is it? I hope you’re well.’
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
“Your grace. Losing it…”
“No more deals, no more sacrifices, no more jumping ship, got it?”
He takes his dads warning. He reburies the nuns in the same casket and then tells himself he won’t be like them. It didn’t end well here, it wouldn’t end well for Dean. John was right. Maybe this was good for him.
“You haven’t,” Dean says quickly. Dean’s at a loss for words though, so instead he leans in, one hand on Cas’ hip, the other on his cheek, and he kisses him.
“I hope so. You deserve more than this,”
Suddenly there’s light, the angel falls back a little, knife clattering to the ground, eyes lit up and burning away, Cas shields his eyes until he sees the brightness fade and hears the body hit the floor. When he looks again, Dean is standing in front of him, angel blade in hand. He looks worried, and before Cas can fully realize that he isn’t about to die, Dean has already dropped his angel blade and moved his hands to grip at Cas’ shoulders, his coat, holding his cheek and examining the cut.
Sam looks at Dean, who’s looking at the door to Cas’ room, hand rubbing over his face. Sam reaches out and pulls his brother into a hug.
“Good.” She says and Cas hears the smile in her voice, in that moment, he is happy.
“I don’t know what I’m doing.” Dean admits after a while.
“Jack. He saved me. Wheres D-”
it's bothering me that idk if past tense of 'smite' is 'smited' or 'smote'
He takes it and allows himself to be pulled up. He looks down at their hands, holding Dean’s like it’s something meant to be treasured. Like it’s something he never thought would happen. Dean thinks if anything were to happen to Cas now it would ruin him more completely than it ever has before.
Later that day Jack senses another presence. An archangel.
Spacing and format continues to be a bitch, can someone tell me how they do it?? Advice, anything?
But that wasn’t the end, was it? Of course not, the world was too cruel, or too kind, he couldn’t decide. And Castiel was very much the same.
“Dean. I know this life is dangerous okay. But do you really want to be stuck alone and miserable when there’s someone right in front of your face?”
“He didn’t.” Dean shakes his head. “He told me-” Dean can’t finish. Sam looks at him, frowning.
“How are you back?”
“But he did. You can’t change that. He obviously thought you were worth it.” Sam says. “And you are. We stopped Chuck,”
“Will you… be okay?”
“Cas isn’t coming back?” Clair asks, it’s hopeful, but it’s not a question. Not really.
They argue, but it’s all in good nature, the bickering turns into flirting, even if Sam or Eileen or Jack is there. It’s not like they’re actually flirting, but Dean slings an arm over Cas’ shoulder or keeps his hand on his back, or leans in and knocks their heads together when they’re talking closely and laughing.
“Okay, so a family dinner then.” Sam saves him.
Sam looks at Cas again. “I didn’t leave Dean alone when… I can’t just leave you. You’re still family, Cas.”
“This isn’t- no. This isn’t about me. I’m asking about you.”
“Good. Because this is your home too. You’re family.” Dean says, then immediately cringes. “Not like… family family. Just… you’re… important to us.” Cas raises his eyebrows, but then Sam walks in and Dean goes back to the burgers, face red.
“Everything alright?” Dean asks. Cas nods, extracting himself only a little bit from Dean’s side so he can look Dean in the eyes without being pressed up against him.
Cas knew the deepest parts of Dean, but he had never seen it from Dean’s perspective like this. A documentation of not just the ugly, but the beauty too, the art, the things he had only acknowledged to himself.
“Like to a restaurant?” Dean asks, Sam nods, swallowing his bite of salad.
“You tell me,” Cas lifts an eyebrow. He’s hesitant too though. He’s nervous. Dean licks his lips and nods to himself before looking right at Cas.
“Well then I want you to hear it too.” Dean chuckles. He drains his glass, then sets it down, turning his chair to face Cas fully.
“And you know… he kinda- he kinda looks at me like everything is gonna be okay. He just… he just makes me feel like things are gonna be okay and they’re not. Sam I- they’re not okay. Nothing is okay.” Dean’s voice rises steadily in volume with each word. His collected stony grimace falling into a tearful angry expression. He’s shaking. He’s trying to think of ways to save Cas. Some way they could fix this. They have to fix it. It’s so fucking painful. Sam doesn’t try to say anything, he knows there’s really nothing he can say.
“Well as long as you’re sure!” Dean says, veering on yelling although it’s more worried than angry.
Cas looks at Dean who still doesn’t look back, but he’s smiling and blushing and Cas is secretly aching to reach across the seat and hold Dean’s hand. Begging Dean to take his hand. Cas would throw all his plans out the window for Dean. Technically he has before. He’s thrown out a whole army for Dean. He would do it again too. He’d follow Dean to the ends of the Earth.
Jack visits often, unable to interfere still, but he’s their kid, he’s family. So they celebrate holidays and birthdays and they have family dinners with everyone, including Jody and the girls, they have a life now. Hunting will never be gone for good, but Dean doesn’t think he’ll have to die at the hands of something set to kill.
When the empty goes, it goes quickly, with a disgusting slurping sound and Dean looks up, teary eyes wide and horrified. Cas is still there looking dumbfounded.
“What happened to you, man?” Dean was soft, a hand on Cas’ aching shoulder and worry in his voice.
“Then go pack. We got time.” Dean says. He lifts the beer cooler and the snack cooler and carries them both to the impala in one trip.
Maybe it was being human that made him and Dean grow even closer. They shared food and cups of coffee and they nudged each other under the kitchen table and Dean would leave his hand on Cas’ knee when Cas took shotgun in the impala. Dean would be there when Cas woke up sweating and cold with the blankets half on the floor and he would smooth out all his worries with a calloused hand.
“Still.”
anyway, please comment if you want to, they make my day <3
(See the end of the chapter for
They should have known this was coming. There’s always a catch.
Castiel is ‘of god’ in the same way that he defied God more than anyone has ever dared to. Dean is too tired and too drunk to find the tragic beauty in Castiel’s name or story or life and death. So instead he closes the pocket knife and tucks it away.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas says and Dean shoves Cas halfheartedly, only his hands end up clinging onto his coat, pulling him closer instead. Dean prefers it like that anyway.
“I’m sorry.” He whispers. Cas shakes his head and takes Deans hand, bringing it up to his lips and kissing his knuckles gently.
‘Young man jumped outside grocery store last night... hospitalized... hate crime... wearing makeup... the attacker was not arrested.”
Cas starts to wonder if Dean is okay.
He parks in front of a bar, checks his face in the mirror and heads inside. He hasn’t hooked up with anyone in… years? Something feels wrong as he scopes out the nearly empty bar for someone who catches his eye. The bartender slides his drink across the counter and pulls around a stool to take a seat across from him. He takes her in, faded sea-green hair chopped jaggedly at shoulder length, big hoop earrings and black lipstick, eyeliner sharp enough to slice a man's heart right in two. He smiles at her, but his heart isn’t in it.
Cas reaches a hand to Dean’s arm, calming him. Dean smiles shakily.
Finally, driving feels exhilarating. He lets Cas choose the music first, and he doesn’t regret it when Led Zeppelin comes on. The windows down, pedal to the metal. Dean sings along with the song.
He doesn’t realize it’s been a few minutes until Sam has his hand on his arm and is pulling him out of the room.
“We don’t need to do it now,” Dean grumbles.
“I don’t expect anything in return Dean.” Cas says carefully, eyes still boring into Dean’s, “I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable with my devotion, Dean, I understand that this is not reciprocated-”
“It said Billie was enough…” Cas shrugs, his eyes drift and Dean moves his own head to keep the eye contact.
He opens to the first blank page and at the top he writes ‘Dean Winchester’. ‘Micheal's sword, the righteous man, human.’
They both look at each other and Sam rolls his eyes again.
Dean takes his hand from behind his back, holding out another cassette tape.
“Hey, hey, you’re okay.”
“I would’ve come back.”
“Cas is still hurt,”
He tried to forget those dreams, because Dean was never supposed to feel this way. He was never supposed to feel comfort from the arms of a dick angel like Cas. It was dangerous. Angels were dangerous. Cas was dangerous.
(I will be writing more fics though and if you wanna check out my other works go ahead!)
By that time next week, they’re pulling into the garage of the bunker, Sam pulls his brother into a hug right away and then Cas. They give Eileen hugs too, and hanging up his jacket, Dean sees a leash on one of the hooks by the door. He points at it, narrowing his eyes at Sam.
He couldn’t regret it when there were nights when the air was warm and the windows were rolled down in the impala with the music on full volume.
Sam and Eileen send pictures back, Sam at the stove, Eileen with a machete looking badass as fucking hell. Selfies of them at fancy restaurants that they definitely shouldn’t be able to afford but with Charlie’s credit card they can afford almost anything.
“It’s not about deserving. You have every right to feel whatever it is you feel.”
Past the blood and bruise
‘Jack? Is Dean… is he okay? Is he dead?’ Cas doesn’t say the prayer out loud, but Sam can see it on his face.
“Or we could just talk…”
Thanks for reading
“You shouldn’t”
Dean talks to Mary and also Dean and Cas act like husbands
“Why would- why would he do that?”
There’s an angel blade to Dean’s throat and Sam is grappling with invisible binds around his neck. Cas is defenseless, the last of his grace being the only thing left.
“You didn’t think we kept you around just for your grace, did you?”
“It’s okay, my ‘mojo’ had been depleting slowly for a while before I… left. I had already come to terms with the idea of being human. I’m just sorry I won’t be of much help anymore.”
He looked up at the mirror and nodded.
“It’s gone.”
“You a therapist?”
“Of course. I meant what I said, you are worth it Dean.”
“We could just go to bed,” Cas suggests.
It’s been nearly a month when Jack shows up at the bunker. Dean wakes up one morning and he’s eating cereal in the kitchen like he still lived here. Dean almost tears up. He does tear up when he hugs him. He’s his son, after all.
“Jack, please,” but Jack doesn’t answer. “I’ll love him for a lifetime. I’ll keep loving him until long after I die.” he promises. Maybe Dean can hear him from heaven. Maybe Dean is watching their grief.
He’s to be released at noon, as long as he wakes up and isn’t in too much pain, but Dean still finds time to worry. At least he doesn’t have to worry about Cas not waking up at all; he’s already opened his eyes a few times, leading Dean to scoot his chair closer, abandon his cold waffles, and put a gentle hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“I want to be here Dean.” Cas says. Dean nods finally and offers a sincere, but tight smile.
“It has.” Cas sighs, an oddly human expression crossing his face. “I was… an angel of the lord and now I’m the adoptive father to Lucifer’s son.”
“I don’t know, can you and Cas come meet us? How did Billie go?”
“Dean,” Sam’s voice is dripping with sympathy. “He chose this,”
“People can be awful,” Dean mutters, like it doesn’t affect him personally.
“Well then we’ll be here for emotional support.”
“We’ll be leaving in the morning,”
John looks at him weird after that. Dean thinks that he must be easy to read, even to his dad who never cared to pay attention.
“was it?” Cas says with a deep voice, eyes serious but he’s teasing, eyebrow raised, and Dean laughs.
Then years had passed. Years, and years, and years, and eventually Dean came to realize that he didn’t give much of a shit anymore. He still denied it and he couldn’t force himself to act on it, but he didn’t grimace when someone called him gay. He didn’t get angry when someone assumed he and Cas were together. They did stand uncomfortably close. It was an honest mistake.
Sam looks between them, then back at Dean with a surprised, slightly scared look, as if he’s trying to tell Dean, ‘please don’t do this in front of me’. To no avail. Dean claps his hands together and grins nervously.
“I’m bisexual.”
“We’re always driving though,” Sam complains
“I love you, Dean Winchester”
Except Dean has been open with his sexuality, even if he hasn’t stated it outright. He doesn’t shy away from admitting that he finds the male lead in a movie hot in addition to the female leads, and he lets his hand linger on Cas’ shoulder for far too long. He’s become himself. He’s become free. Cas can feel it too, and he seems to return the sentiment. Dean still fears Cas is only matching Dean’s movements. Maybe the ex-angel does not feel the same way. It’s not because he’s an angel, Dean reminds himself, Gabriel had no problem with love and desire. But Cas was always different.
“I’ll figure it out myself then.” Dean grumbles. Sam nods, smiling.
“So why won’t you tell me?”
“Mhm?”
“I love you too.”
Cas gets the sense that Dean would do the same for Cas.
“Me too.”
“I understand, Dean. You’re selfless to a fault. You gave everything you had to Sam, you’ve sacrificed your life for strangers even when they don’t deserve your kindness. You deserve some good for yourself. It’s not repayment, it’s not because of anything. It’s just because you’re human, you get to be selfish too sometimes.”
“I love you, Dean.”
He doesn’t belong here. He doesn’t deserve this. He wasn’t meant for this.
“Cas isn’t dead.”
“Bullshit. You’re helpful, Cas. I don’t give a fuck if you have mojo or not. And I don’t care that I’m alive if you’re dead. What was I supposed to do? How am I ever supposed to get over something like that? And what life would I be living? One where everyone is gone?”
“Cas.”
(See the end of the chapter for
here is some ACTUAL destiel fluff cuz Cas wasn't really in chapter 1
“Hey, Cas?”
“Sorry, kid.” Claire nods, sighs and then takes a good long look at Dean, who looks right back, stoic, but knowing Claire sees right through him. She glances at Kaia for a moment.
On the third day, Sam prays for Jack, they have a family dinner, because Jack may be hands off but he’s still their son. It feels a little too quiet with just the three of them. It’s off balance and Jack can tell. Somehow they end the evening smiling and reminiscing and Dean pulls out his pocket knife and hands it to Jack, tapping the table where their initials are engraved.
Dean wonders why he can think that about them, but not about himself.
“Tell me…?” Cas asks softly, his face is a mix of hope, confusion, and complete surprise so quickly it might’ve been funny in any other conversation. Dean lets Cas process for a minute, lets himself process.
“Awesome! I’m gonna jump in the shower real quick,” Dean says, giving Jack a quick half-hug and Cas a put on the shoulder.
“I know, Dean. But we can stop him. We will.”
Dean holds himself together for nearly a week, tight-lipped smiles and too loud laughter and a few beers. Sam wasn’t convinced, how could he be, but Dean needed time.
Suddenly Dean didn’t want to die anymore. He didn’t want to fuck off to the ends of the earth only to drop off the surface. He wanted beach vacations and fruity drinks with tiny goddamn umbrellas. He wanted karaoke bars and not having to worry about what lurked in the parking lot. He wanted Christmas Eve with Jody and Donna and the girls, he wanted fishing trips with Jack. He wanted family barbecues because they had a day off work at a normal job, not because the world might be fried and crispy by sunrise.
“Good.” Dean nods. “We’ll be headed back home, finally… but I think it’s been pretty enlightening.”
‘I’m human now!’ along with a smiley face and a few other random emojis. Maybe it isn’t the time for emojis though.
So his dad knew then. Or suspected at least, and now Dean had to do this case. It wasn’t a sign of trust, it was a warning. That this isn’t in the cards for him. And if he ever were to give in, if he ever were to be like this, he’ll end up just like these nuns.
The next morning, to the outside world, nothing has changed. They’re still just Dean and Cas. And Dean promises them both that after all this bullshit is over he’ll let himself fall into this life completely. He’ll deal with the awkward conversations and the acceptance speech Sam might try to give him, just from Sam’s smile when Dean pours Cas’ coffee for him, he can tell it’s coming. He’s ready. But for now, there’s no one around but them. They have a world to save, or a world to mourn, depending on whether they find a way to fix this.
Sam notices, then. There’s no way he doesn't. He doesn’t mention it though, he lets them revel in whatever it is they have. Cas thinks he’s happy for them too, because he smiles when he catches Cas grinning absently at Dean, and when Dean offers Cas his last piece of bacon.
“Nightmare?”
sorry this is wildly unedited, I want it out of my face
“I want you here Cas. But I want you to want to be here.”
Sam only nods, but when he goes to get himself a drink, he peeks into Dean's room. The wreckage looks mostly put back into place, but his shelf is laying sideways, there’s glass in the corner. Blood stains on the sheets and the first aid kit left carelessly on the bed. Sam peaks into the bathroom to see a shattered mirror, the door of the cabinet is on the floor.
Dean doesn’t know what made him crack. He doesn’t even remember exactly when it happened. He knows he was washing his face and brushing his teeth. It was night, he was tired after a day of research. He had a beer or two and Sam was still reading in the library, Cas was off somewhere again.
“You comin?”
“I’m proud of you Dean.” Sam says, Dean scoffs. “Seriously. I wasn't sure if you were gonna let me mention it. I’m happy for you, you deserve this.”
Then they’re both under the blankets, facing each other in the dark, but not touching, Cas has a hand on the sheets between them and Dean looks at it, reaching out and taking it before he can convince himself not to. Cas intertwines their fingers and smiles, pulling Dean closer until they’re wrapped up in each other, warm and safe and in love. But this world is dangerous, and Cas and Dean get the worst of it all, to say it out loud, to act on it beyond what they have right here… it would be disastrous.
“Maybe… ” Dean grins, Cas smiles back at him and shakes his head. Dean puts down his empty whisky glass and stands, turning to offer his hand to Cas.
Cas’ face is sour and his eyes are scarily hollow as he climbs into the passenger seat.
“Yeah yeah. I haven’t technically talked to him yet, not about… that.”
“We’ve missed you, kid.”
“But what if you’re wrong? Or what if you’re right, and then something happens. What if someone dies again.”
“Me too, Dean.” Cas practically whispers, looking at Dean fondly.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says. The music begins to play, it’s a soft song, something with guitar that Cas doesn’t recognize.
“What were you doing down there?”
“I love you too,” Dean says, voice cracking.
“So what? He’s Cas!”
“I know.” Dean sighs, letting his stony expression fall apart a little more with every word. “Did you… did you know?” Dean asks, look up at Sam. “That he loved me?”
I had something I wanted to say but I forgot what it was, so I hope it wasn't important <3 I hope you enjoy :)
“Thank you.”
“How- what- how are you?”
Dean calls Sam, but he’s already backing out. Three long-ass minutes later, a sleep rumpled Sam is in the passenger seat, still in his pajamas, and looking awake and wide eyed at the prospect of Cas being alive.
When they get back it’s past dinner and they all shower and clean up which means it’s late by the time they’re all settled, but Dean cooks a meal anyway, calling Jack from his room and they all eat at ten pm together.
“Just like that?” Dean asks. Cas nods and Dean shrugs. “Good enough for me.” He hasn’t taken his eyes off Cas the entire time, wanting to pull him right back into a hug.
Cas had told him they were real. Amidst every broken, shattered frame, every set up and every mocking move Chuck made. Cas had been real. He had always been the only real thing in Dean’s life, and somewhere he had known that all along.
“Then where are they?” The angel sneers. “You are not worth it for him. You are not worth anything to him. You’re human.”
Even when Dean couldn’t look him in the eye and his muscles were screaming and his head was pounding, he never once regretted it.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas nods.
“I don’t wanna do this alone,”
“Do what?”
Cas backs away, because it’s not for his ears and he’s already heard too much. But he aches for Dean, he’s not sure exactly what to take from the conversation, considering it was likely about him, but Dean doesn’t do raw emotion like that. Cas wants it though, he wants Dean to be open and honest and emotional with him. He wants to be emotional with Dean. He’s not sure if they’ve gotten there yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean,” Sam looks at him with a new expression of sorrow. “I’m sorry.”
“You know you can come to us if you need anything, right? You’re always welcome to stay,” Sam grins at him. Cas nods and smiles thankfully, a sad look still passing over his face.
Things weren’t really all that different. But at the same thing, something big had changed with Dean and everyone could sense it. Things were different with Cas too, if only in the way he responded to Dean’s new found sense of self. They didn’t talk about it though, so Sam had to watch as Dean and Cas skirted around each other, smiling and holding their gazes a little to long and looking away like there was nothing there.
“Is he gone for good?”
But Castiel did not simply fall. No. He jumped, as soon as he had a chance. As soon as there was something worth the fight, he leapt from the prison that was a home, into a much cozier, much more human home. No longer a soldier of god, Castiel was a soldier of himself. Cas Winchester leapt from the angels vice-like grip into free will and beer and family and he took down as many suckers with him as he could.
“I would never want to leave you, Dean. I chose you over heaven countless times, why would I do that if I wanted to leave? I didn’t want to impose.”
“I’m… I’m at-” Cas looks around and tells Sam where he is.
“Oh.” Silence. “Well you do now.”
“Thank you. For staying. For saving me. And Sam. For... just for everything.”
They took out the rest of the vampires and Cas has drawn a large complicated sigil on one of the walls and a few minutes later, he can hear Sam coming through the speaker of Cas’ phone in his pocket.
“Human sexuality does not exactly apply to angels, but seeing as my vessel is male, I suppose that would mean I am not straight either.” Cas shrugs.
“I couldn’t risk it,”
“I do. I know you wouldn’t kick me out again. But I would feel bad staying knowing I couldn’t help.”
“There’s no rush.” Dean shakes his head smiling. “Not anymore. A road trip might be nice. Congratulations by the way.”
“Not sure.” He lets the door slam behind him.
“Enlightening?”
Sam was right, on the drive he sees nothing but empty roads and empty houses. Not a single person. Not a single sign of life aside from the trees and the grass.
Cas nods and Dean thinks he catches a smile, he turns away, like that will hide his face, but Dean can tell he’s grinning anyway. Dean grins back.
He digs his hands into his pockets, not expecting to find anything, but coming up with his phone, low battery but alive. Thanking Jack for small miracles, Cas scrolls through his contact list, starting to make his way towards the main road, clicking on Dean’s name.
Cas can’t say anything, his eyes wide and brimming with tears. He almost hates Sam for telling him, but he holds the words close to his chest all the same.
He reads, finding moments of peace while watching Dean’s breathing and the way he turns his head farther into Cas’ shoulder and all the little signs that point to Dean being alive. But then he remembers Dean doesn’t like it when he watches him. He had said not creepily, but Cas doesn’t really know what counts as creepy to Dean. So even with his gaze full of admiration and devotion he looks back at his book, carding his hand through Dean’s hair without a thought.
Then suddenly, his little brother wasn’t the only person who mattered. They had a real family. They had Cas. And he was scared, because he cared for Cas differently then he cared for Sam. He cared for Cas the way he was never supposed to care about another man. Or anyone, not in this life, it was too dangerous. But Cas is an Angel, and Dean has never been straight, he’s not gonna kid himself.
“I’m a bored bartender and you’re drinking at seven on a Wednesday.”
“Yeah, yeah. In love with humanity.” Dean laughs softly. “How’s your back?”
“Cas!” Dean yells, summoning Cas from the other room.
Past the curses and cries
“Oh. Well. Good. That’s good then.” Dean nods, grinning. Cas is grinning too, and Dean makes a plan to take the next exit so he can finally kiss the love of his fucking life.
“W-What’s build-a-bear? It sounds dangerous.” Gabriel commented.
“I love it, John.” Sarah beamed as she nuzzled against him before he let her up.
“Who…are you?” The Fae asked as Dean eyed his face in surprise.
Gabriel nodded shyly as he pulled out his Instagram and went down to a photo from a bit ago. Ah, he didn’t remember them because they were closer to preteens than adults. Gabriel held Castiel in a hug, wearing makeup like Castiel’s, decked out in their merch. Gabriel’s hair was spiked up and he was giving a rock hand sign. Sam also stood in the photo, if it weren’t for Sam’s babyface, he would have thought he was older than he was. Sam was just so tall compared to his companion.
“I-...” Dean glanced around so confused. “I-I wasn’t here...I was somewhere else.” Castiel looked like a frantic mother at him.
“He looks so much like you.” Gabriel tripped over the similarities.
“I love you too.” Gabriel breathed as his phone rang in his pocket. Gabriel pulled back to answer the phone. “Yes? Oh, Hi, yes, I called earlier to reserve a table. Charlie and Jessica are my guests. Give them the best table, on me. Thanks.”
Charlie blushed to look away from her as Jess stepped out of the van in front of the restaurant.
“Thanks, I love this couch but I can NOT for the life of me ever get out of this thing while pregnant,” Dean stated as Sam returned with a piece for Dean and his own plate sitting next to each other. Castiel came down the stairs in long pajama pants half asleep as he went to the kitchen pulling open the fridge. “Breakfast is in the microwave.”
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled trying to get something out of his eye as Castiel sighed grabbing a towel, and moved to help him dry his face. “Something's in my eye.”
“A stray is a stray!” Dean scoffed. “They need homes, I happily don’t mind it.” Castiel smiled.
“This time I mean it,” Dean frowned.
“This is so good. I can’t believe I missed out on this.” Castiel chewed.
Maybe this would work out after all.
...Wait? Did he call him, Castiel?
“We have no choice,” Castiel mumbled holding himself as Gordon took the paper. Gordon seemed to agree with the writing shoving it into his pocket before he turned on the camera and clicked through it a bit.
“...Interesting to say the least…” Castiel admitted.
“You...aren’t?” Eve asked. “...Why not?”
“Why must you always assault the flowers?” Castiel smiled mischievously as Dean looked offended, Castiel rested his chin on his hands, as he looked down at Dean.
“No wonder I don’t see you around,” Claire spoke popping her gum. “You are a rich bitch.”
“So Sarah, where is
give your daughter and
Sam moved his fingers away, pushing himself against Gabriel’s body opening Gabriel’s legs to him. Gabriel sucked in air as he watched Sam moving to position himself the only way his body knew how. Sex...wasn’t like Gabriel imagined. It hurt for a second. Gabriel winced as Sam pushed completely into him. Gabriel held himself still trying to calm the pain down in his body but...Sam’s body took the pain from him.
“You don’t need to thank me, Dean. I’m happy to do all of that.”
“I wasn’t sure if you would still want me there.”
“I guess you know that though, after purgatory.”
Cas can only imagine how they must look to the world around them. Like they’re falling apart, crashing and burning, going out in loud explosions of light and dust and fire. Like they’re falling into each other rather than apart. They’re crashing down, but they’re building a new foundation on the debris. They’re communicating for once, and they must look like they’re late to the game, maybe this should have happened years ago, but for once they’re self sacrificial relationship has become healthier.
“I think he’s been looking for a reason to leave for a while now.”
“Cool.”
“Tired.”
That would've loved you for a lifetime
“He’s nearly finished creating your heaven. He wanted it to be perfect. I think he was mostly stalling though, I cut off angels from prayers until heaven is complete, I realize now that Castiel should have been the exception.”
“Do you want to?”
“Okay, Dean” Cas smiles.
They look forward again and there’s not much to see, but the quiet is comforting. Neither of them want to go back inside, it would mean they go to separate beds and separate rooms and Cas thinks he’d rather not sleep at all.
When Dean tells him that he’s enough, even without his powers, it’s like a damn breaks. and when Dean runs a hand over the stubble on Cas’ jaw, then slowly… gentle lips against his own, Cas decides it’s never felt so good to be human.
They have the funeral that afternoon, and everyone comes. Jody, Donna, and the girls, Garth and his family, Bobby, Charlie and her girlfriend. All the hunters who had known and respected Dean. Cas was there and Eileen was there and Miracle was there.
More often than not, Dean’s arm ends up behind Cas and Cas’ head leans over against Dean’s sideways until they’re completely wrapped up in each other, whether they realize it or not.
“I’m not sure.” Cas shrugs. “I was in the empty and it was… loud. It was crowded and the shadow was angry, then there was an explosion of some sort and I woke up here.”
But Cas was busy. Dean was busy. They had a job to do and pursuing anything would be unrealistic. It would only break their hearts. But Dean thought they would all come out of it alive. Maybe Cas had given him too much faith.
“You.” Cas says easily. Sam looks between the two of them with wide eyes, like he’s excited for them to finally admit their feelings, but then Cas turns to Sam. “And Sam. And Jack.”
“I’m not sure.”
Dean would rub circles into Cas’ shoulder and let Cas press his forehead into Dean’s neck and Dean would rock them lightly, sometimes he would hum, and if Cas were an angel, it would never feel this warm.
So Dean pulls Cas up and into a hug and they stay like that, hugging and smiling with teary eyes and when they finally separate, Dean pulls Cas to his room. They set up the computer with an old movie, but they’ve both seen it, so if they end up making out while it plays in the background, that’s no one’s business but theirs.
“I know, Dean.”
“Not with things like this,”
He can hear murmurs of sound; a blade clatters to the ground, a hand falling on Dean’s shoulder.
“I’ve missed you too.” Jack grins. “Where’s Sam?”
“Does that mean Gabriel is alive?”
“I’ve fallen.” He says.
Kissing Cas is indescribable. It’s everything they’ve felt for each other for the past ten years, it’s soft and gentle, and heavy, crashing down on them slowly, and Dean pulls away, leaning his head against Cas’.
“Dean Winchester.” Cas warns.
allow them to hurt you, anyone, never ever. If anyone even looks at you wrong I will kick their butts.”
“I have Jimmy and Cain in the guest house. I will be okay, besides, Michael will be back soon. I’m sure. Lucifer sighed but eventually agreed. Dean went back to making his tea as the doorbell eventually rang. “Come in! It’s open!”
“...Mommy, we have to hurry.” Jack whispered as he touched Castiel’s face relieving him of the pain. “I can only stop my birth for so long...and if we don’t get to Joshua in time and I am not born in the light place, God will make me go with grandma.”
“Fuck the party,” Castiel growled defiantly, Dean could smell how turned on Castiel was. Castiel unbuckled his pants trying to yank them down as he roughly fought for dominance in his mouth. Dean cupped his face in his hands as they kissed. Castiel stopped his hands when he felt Dean break the kiss, Dean turned away his eyes glowing red again. Castiel could
___________________________________________________________________________
“I’m just a super,” Jess stated like it wasn’t apparent.
“Are you done with the window?!” Castiel snapped.
“...Castiel, I can’t tell you what they wished for,” Dean spoke, it wasn’t judging. It seemed...like he spoke with sadness and concern.
“Welcome, Mr. Novak and co.” The pilot met them on the tarp. Michael helped Dean take the girls from the baby strollers. Some flight crew helped grab the strollers putting it into the cargo hold. Michael and lucifer taking two of the girls in as Leo trialed after them. Dean arched his back, his back already annoyed with the fact he was walking too much. Castiel scooped up the two remaining girls, Dean went to object but Castiel kissed him.
“Thank you, Benny,” Dean spoke kindly as Benny walked in placing it in the living room.
“Fuck no. Do you know how much I can make selling your fucking sex tape and some photos of you two?” Gordon laughed coldly. “More than you can afford!”
Castiel said nothing as he sighed enjoying the stars. He was the first to notice it was snowing, which Castiel felt one snowflake fall on his face...but it wasn’t cold. He felt no cold from the snow. So he couldn’t be cold now? Castiel sat up holding his hand to touch a snowflake seeing how beautiful the design was, it didn’t melt in his hand.
“Master Castiel, Please.” Crowley tried as Benny followed after them. Castiel moved to a more fragile metal door, not taken care of for obvious reasons as Castiel ripped the metal shudder off the door. The man inside who was standing over a body scream in fear dropping his recorder.
“They are actually from the moon. They haven’t seen what it’s like from down here. So they are taking selfies to capture human life before they head up to the stars.” Dean explained as the rain started to spill from the sky. Castiel and Dean laughed looking up at the sky as everyone scattered for shelter, the rain poured over their skin. Castiel looked up as water wet their skin, Castiel just took a second to close his eyes and enjoy the feel of the water. Castiel noticed them in a window, seeing their reflections.
Castiel’s eyes wandered to the name on Dean’s knuckle. Castiel sighed affectionately. ‘Angel’ stared back at him. Dean got it after he asked to marry him. Castiel even got his first tattoo, angel wings, and a halo around his belly button as sort of matching tattoos. Dean got the word angel because Castiel’s name meant Angel of Thursday and Castiel always saw Dean as his guardian angel. Dean noticed his stare which is why he moved to hold Castiel’s hand. Castiel smiled at him with care before kissing his knuckle.
“So what now?” Sam asked.
Was he cursed?
“Don’t worry, An employee helped me load everything,” Dean started eating some chips. “I figured if I went alone, they might have a harder time spotting me.” Castiel blinked, Dean was always so smart about this. Using his head. They would be looking for an alpha or at least an alpha and an omega. They wouldn’t think twice about a single omega.
“Gabriel.” Gabriel held out his hand shaking it before turning back to the tests. “...So you know which ones are the best?”
“If you weren’t so cute, I wouldn’t have come.” Castiel teased back as Charlie beamed like a toddler getting her way.
Dean moved his cock to Castiel’s hole as Castiel opened his legs wider to him. Castiel never knew men could have sex, but...he trusted Dean so much. Dean pressed into him, Castiel whimpered at the touch. Dean kissed him softly comforting him as he adjusted to him. Dean was so tender with him.
“Where’s my brother?!” Gabriel yelled towards the cops as Michael and Lucifer exited the house.
“Okay,” Gabriel stated as Sam stood nuzzling against him.
“I’d love to meet your family.” Castiel nodded as Dean beamed happily pulling him into a kiss. Castiel kissed back softly when Benny pushed the door open.
“Yes, I do recall seeing that you had a card,” Chuck stated.
“...Did you want to continue?” Castiel offered softly. “...We can stop if you want.”
his passing?!
,” Dean repeated softly. Castiel eyed him as he glanced down at their hands holding them up. How close they were. Castiel took his other hand sliding his finger between the hands making a line. Dean looked at the line. The separation, the barrier they both know kept them separate...no matter how close. No matter how much Castiel wanted to close the gap...the gap was always there...keeping Dean out of reach.
“...It’s a boy.” Michael breathed as he held Jack up to show Dean. Dean breathed happily as Michael disconnected him from Castiel, wrapping the baby in a blanket. Michael handed Castiel the baby, Castiel sobbing in happiness staring down at his crying son.
“That’s really when you knew you fell in love with Dean?” Gabriel asked as Dean nodded.
“The one who is trying to take your farm?” Dean asked.
“I have a surprise.” Castiel smiled getting out of bed. “Come on, before we eat too much of the light sitting in bed.” Dean sighed moving to get up and get dressed before following him out of the room.
wanted it.” Anna moved to snatch the dog again.
Castiel moaned in happiness as he heated up the meal, he rubbed his face tiredly his eyes lovingly looking at his mate who at the same time as Sam took a bite while watching tv. Castiel moved to take a bite of his meal moving to plop down near Dean and Sam.
not to make things weird.” Gabriel huffed crossing his arms.
“Wolves, with me.” Bobby ran bolting out of the cave, the hunting wolves ran to follow as the weaker stayed behind. Jody watched with worry as Bobby raced to the mountain.
“They always give me a fresh batch.” Dean slid his hands into his pocket.
“What the fuck is
“Just give me some time, I’m working on a potion that-” Dean tried desperately.
“No, Angels and Sacreds can’t catch human illness...but why ask?” Castiel asked as Dean looked towards the door.
Crowley’s head was pounding as he tried to open his eyes, Crowley sat up as he felt a hand touch his back.
“...” Dean watched Castiel disappear into the bathroom. Dean swallowed before he roughly and quickly started to strip happy to follow him. Castiel moved into the water taking a seat before he noticed Dean move to the tub. “
“...How can you be so sure they will find it?” Castiel sniffed looking at his phone.
“If he loses?” Sam asked as Castiel paused. He didn’t...think that through.
“It doesn’t work like that.” The man explained grabbing Castiel’s arm stopping him. “...You aren’t really holding it.” Castiel paused taken back as he looked at his hand seeing...it was empty and the phone was back where it previously was. “Things we touch in this world, don’t affect the living world.”
. Sam watched Gabriel’s naked body covered in sweat and cum. Seeing Gabriel’s breath panting to catch his breath. Sam moved to kiss Gabriel’s back muscles as Gabriel laid on the blankets they had snuck to this cave. Little things. Gabriel had started to sneak things, like blankets and soft furs from their hunts. Sam loved how Gabriel seemed to be making it more of their own space.
Castiel felt Dean’s calloused hands against his lower hips, Gods how he wished he could feel those hands worn from sword fighting to hold him intimately. Castiel breathed a shaky breath but the touch was lost almost as instantly as it was placed there. Dean moved his hands up to a more appropriate place. Thought was there a more appropriate place on a person you shouldn’t touch like this?
“Exactly. A double date! Dean?” Sam looks at Dean with his expectant puppy eyes and Dean looks to Cas, who’s wearing almost the same look.
“So there’s no one you have in mind then?” Sam asks, Dean knows exactly what he’s trying to do.
He distantly hears himself yelling out for Cas.
Sam nods, deciding enough is enough and he’s not about to therapize both his brother and his best friend in one night. He closes his laptop and starts to pack away their stuff.
“That’s the problem!” Dean says. “It’s something! It’s a big something. It’s… it’s- fuck, Sammy, it’s everything. It’s Cas.”
“Right.” Dean whispers anyway, because it’s the most assurance he’s gonna get.
They head back inside and they don’t talk about it, but Dean loads up the dishes into the dishwasher and Cas wipes down the counters and then Dean turns and leans back against the counter, Cas does the same across from him.
“You got a hunt?” Sam asks.
“I’m glad to be back.”
He doesn’t look at anything other than the shelves right in front of his face, but when he leaves, he glances back, freezing with his eyes stuck to the empty room. He should have said something back. He should have told Cas. He should have stopped him. He should have reached out and held on and not let go. But he didn’t, Cas was gone and Dean watched him go.
Dean thinks he’s pretty fucked up, but Cas thought he was worth it, so he keeps trying to be happy. He doesn’t think happiness really exists for him if Cas isn’t a part of it. Not truly.
Cas was desperate in his grief. Part of him was desperate to be alone. But when Claire squeezed his hand and Jody leaned her head on his shoulder and Sam hugged him like he used to hug Dean, he realizes that he has a family. He’s had it for a while. He misses Dean like hell, but at least they didn’t cast him aside now that Dean was gone. They held him in their grief like he was a comfort to them as much as they were to him.
During the day, Dean and Cas don’t sit any closer than they normally would,, granted they already sat too close, but Dean never reached for Cas’ hand. Cas never leaned in too close when Dean was talking. They were different, but to the rest of the world, they were the same.
“I love you too.” He says. Cas pulls him back into a kiss. A few minutes later, Dean pulls away again. “You know, your bed still has pizza sauce in it. You could always take up that offer to share with me,”
Sam and Eileen try to keep it discreet, even after Dean tells him to stop with the hiding, and now they hang around the bunker more, which makes Dean proud as much as it makes his heart ache.
Later, other hunters they meet along the way would ask about Castiel, and if he’s not Dean Winchester’s angel, who is he?
“I know Cas, I meant… you always leave.” Dean says, feeling helpless when it comes to words. “You could just… relax. Read a book. Listen to music, I don’t know. You don’t have to take off.”
In the end, hell-hounds ripping ribbons of his skin and his guts being left in a puddle around his hell bound body... it made sense to him. He was always meant to go out bloody. At least he did it to save his brother, his one true purpose fulfilled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It could remember you too.”
Dean kind of hates Cas for leaving like that. He hates him for ever leaving when Dean so badly needed him to stay. He hates himself for not saying it back. He had been trying to. He’d been trying to say it for years, even if the words wouldn’t come out straight. He tried to say it in purgatory. Cas had heard him, he said he knew.
When Cas wakes up in the morning the first time, Dean Winchester is asleep, he’s sprawled out on his stomach, halfway on top of Cas, one leg thrown over Cas’ legs and one arm wrapped around Cas’ waist, his face tucked into his shoulder. He’s breathing deep and content and Cas has warmth in his chest and his cheeks and wrapped up next to him.
“I suppose we can do this without him then, we didn’t want to wait any longer.”
“I couldn’t have ever gotten here without you, man.”
Cas gazes at Dean softly, his smile gentle. Looking at Dean, he has every freckle committed to memory. He has Dean Winchester memorized. He could get lost in looking at Dean. He has many times before.
“I can’t sense them, but I think I burnt through too much of my grace smiting that first vampire. It’s growing weak.”
Dean tries not to listen, but his eyes are still wide and his attention flutters between the news story and the website for their current case. John is listening too with a grim look and Dean thinks maybe it means he’s as horrified as Dean is.
Dean clears his throat. “Are you going to bed? You look like you could use it.”
“I should have done this sooner.”
“Yes?”
“Yes, Dean. Weak. My grace has not been strong in years, I thought you knew this.” Cas says, unbolting the door carefully and peaking around the corner. All clear.
“You didn’t know?”
“Who says I’m leading him on?” Dean shrugs, Sam splutters for a minute surprised, and then he looks at Dean sternly.
“There’s nothing good on here,” Dean complains, closing the computer and putting it on the table.
“What?” Dean glances at Cas, as if to check he’s still there.
“I’m not the one who dropped his entire pizza slice upside down on the pillows,”
“Where are you?” Sam cuts him off.
“Cas isn’t Jess, Dean. Cas is an angel. He’s made it this far, there’s no way he won’t pull through.” Sam sounds desperate too, because Cas was his only friend too. He says Cas will be okay. Dean doesn’t believe him. Sam doesn’t fully believe himself.
“Of course, gender and sexuality are not things that have been of much thought to me, I’m glad that you’re comfortable with yourself, Dean. I know you’ve struggled with this.”
“Yes, it’s me.” He says, sounding disbelieving of himself. He tells Dean where he is.
“I know grief is-”
“No promises. And you too.”
“What do we do now?” Cas asks quietly.
“That's not true,” Cas spits. “They’re family,”
The phone rings.
“He might be. We don’t know if he can heal from this.”
“What is this?” Cas asks, needing clarification. Dean leans their foreheads together and they’re both hardly moving with the music anymore.
“I want you here. And I’m sorry if I made you feel like you didn’t.”
Those nights are silent. Too shaken up to dig any deeper into that pain, into the fear. So they just sit by each other and hope for the best, hope that the worst they get is a split lip or a cracked rib and that at the end of the day, Dean will still be there to pull back the blankets and Cas will still be there to crawl under them.
“How can you be so sure?” Castiel asked ruffling his hair.
“I’m best.” Lucifer barked as the collar translated. “Fuck head.”
A loud crashing sound made them pull apart to see someone tumbling from the main staircase. They both moved to see what was going on, only to take in a passed out man wearing extremely odd clothing. Castiel eyed him in surprise as Rowena moved to him hesitantly. She kneeled next to him slowly. Her eyes glowed as she touched him, touching him shocked her which she pulled her hand away in surprise.
“Did you want to do it?” Stevie scoffed.
“Okay, Dean.” Sam panicked. “You got to push.”
“You...have another sibling?” Castiel asked as Dean nodded slowly.
Adam nodded with a whimper, She gave Dean a loving touch to his face.
“WHAT ARE YOU SITTING AROUND FOR?! COME ON!” Dean yelled angry as Castiel stood moving to the passenger’s seat closing the door.
“Cas isn’t a full name.” Sam criticized.
“Please find someone who will breastfeed him among their own pups,” Bobby spoke as he sounded so broken. Jody nodded tears sliding down her face, knowing the answer as a couple of omegas came forward to offer. Bobby went into his cave slowly laying in his bed.
Sam paced the campsite waiting for a signal from Dean, something. They could both sense something was wrong.
“Why? We can’t die.” Dean commented holding out his hand which Castiel hesitantly took it moving to the ledge in fear as he took a seat next to him. His feet dangling over the nothingness of the fall. “Besides this is the surprise.”
“I-...” Dean choked in tears.
“So Castiel, tell me about yourself,” Mary asked as she chewed on her food.
“He knows?” Dean asked tensing as Chuck nodded.
“Fair, I guess,” Dean stated. “Hey, Gabriel. Keeping Sam good.”
“What did you do all that time in hell till you got here?” Castiel asked. “No one taught you to eat or what’s socially not okay.”
“I never figured you were the type to care,” Dean stated as Chuck stopped on the stairs of the coffee shop. Benny stood outside the car with an umbrella to protect him from the sun waiting for Dean to return with the coffee. Benny watched them talking, curiously.
“This is why I love you,” Dean commented now enjoying two ice creams as Castiel chuckled moving to cook dinner.
Castiel was an odd one.
“...So mating what exactly is that?” Castiel asked as The demon looked through the drawers. “I read it a lot in my research, I don’t get it.”
“No, what?” Castiel scoffed. “You don’t have a name?”
Castiel didn’t understand what he said but Dean continued.
“B-But we haven’t found Joshua.” Castiel panicked.
“Come on, sweetie.” Dean scooped up the little one as Anna melted into his touch needing comfort after what happened. “Let’s get you in a bath.”
“I am so sore,” Dean whined as Castiel winked innocently.
“I-I’m cumming.” Misha choked a bit loudly, his body tensing as Dean taking the opportunity to slam up into Misha, milking Misha of cum with each thrust. Their skin slapping together could be heard by Gordon.
“Look, Gordon,” Dean spoke putting his hands up to show he meant no harm. “I’ll pay you, please, just forget everything you saw,” Dean begged. Castiel’s eyes shot to Dean. Dean...was trying to protect his secret. “Whatever you want. I will literally give you anything.”
“Yum. I’m so full.” Gabriel whined taking a flop onto their doggie begs. Sam moving to lay on his own next to Gabriel tiredly. “I’m going to vomit.”
“Will you protect me if they sought revenge?” Castiel asked causally continuing to watch the flower petals slowly assault the freckles that Castiel wished he could also assault. How could the oldest prince of the kingdom be jealous of flowers, you may ask. Castiel’s flower stopped against the softness of Dean’s bottom lip. Flowers have kissed Dean Winchester and Castiel never would.
“I’m grabbing ice cream, who wants it?” Dean walked towards the kitchen as Leo screamed loudly.
“Of course...but Sam is a very small runt...he won’t make it,” Jody stated. “It’s better to let those ones die to keep the rest healthy.”
“I don’t know much about them,” Dean explained as Castiel nodded. “A little above my paygrade.”
“I want to.” Dean touched Claire’s hair with care. “Someone with your potential deserves a real chance.”
“Hey. I’m less of a baby gay than Castiel.” Sam commented. “I’ve been out since thirteen.”
“No, I will not have my party be too far. We will not be staying long.” Castiel stated. “Please show them to nearby rooms, I request my people be close.”
“No, you can. Just like the burgers, we can’t take them from the living world but we can take and use them in ours.” Dean stated pulling a leather jacket from the rack putting it on. “I mean, the clothes your wearing are real-world, yet you’re wearing them.” Castiel nodded looking.
“I’m sorry, they do what?” Castiel blinked as Mary led him along towards the garage. Mary walked into the open garage door seeing a man working on a small miniature. He wore some weird looking eyeglass magnifier as he finished placing a small window on the building.
“Never bothered to ask about the road trip, yet you let a Shug chew on you?” Michael joked.
your spell?”
“Holy shit.” Castiel gasped jumping up and down on the water, he could feel the water moving against his feet sometimes water sliding against his feet with a wave.
Sam eyed the campsite, paid for in Cash, the farthest from the entrance. Sam eyed the tire tread he has been following since the apartment. Sam floated above the tires as he estimated how long since they been there. Before he flew in the direction of the tracks.
Sam panted kneeling in the dirt as Gabriel laid beside him, Sam was watching the forest for anything they could hunt. Gabriel eyed Sam’s happiness, he never seen him this happy before. Maybe this was something he loved to do.
“That’s...a tomb,” Dean stated hesitantly as Castiel looked at the small cottage. This was just a house. The house was closed up with wooden planks keeping it closed on the door and windows.
“Snow, be nice to your brother.” Sarah laughed nudging the strong white one away who was using Sam as a stool. Her babies, Simon, Snow, Salem, and Sam. Her BEAUTIFUL babies. “Your daddy may not be here...but...He would love every little thing about you guys.” Sarah sniffed as a wolf came into the cave. Sarah watched it drop some meat for her. She recognized the wolf as one of her pack.
“Adam, get away from him.” Sam sighed as Adam continued to stare.
___________________________________________________________________________
madly in love with you...but when you said you would say yes if I asked you to marry me. I thought...might as well shoot my shot.”
Gabriel held his folded clothes as Castiel smiled shyly opening the door. Gabriel walked in moving to set up Castiel’s clothes on the bed when Castiel noticed Dean’s pants on the floor, near Gabriel’s foot. Castiel cursed not sure how to cover it up if he noticed. Castiel moved over to Gabriel quickly kicking the pants under the bed. Praying Gabriel hadn’t noticed, because if he did...he would have to explain why Dean didn’t have pants on. Why castiel was showering and naked, with Dean pantless. Gabriel didn’t comment on it, obviously either not catching his attention or happily chose not to comment.
“Hey, it’s okay.” Castiel breathed as Dean rubbed his tearing up eyes before Dean’s phone started to ring. Castiel pulled him into a tight hug before he pulled back to let Dean answer the phone.
Dean didn’t move, he didn’t breathe...he didn’t smile anymore.
“Well, he didn’t kill me,” Chuck stated as he turned his head to the paramedics zipping up a body bag. “...Tell him you’ll have to try harder than that.” Chuck spat Dean’s blood from his mouth. “...I’ll be collecting the human boy. This joke of an arrangement is over.”
Dean looked so pale and weak like he had a really bad cold, Dean held him like that for hours till Dean’s body betrayed him and he fell asleep. Once Dean was fast asleep. Castiel weakly got up. Needing to use the restroom, Dean didn’t even stir. Roughly panting in his illness in sleep, Castiel moved to the bathroom to clean up.
“...Do you want my opinion?” Gabriel asked as Castiel nodded. “...I think you should stay.”
“...When?” Dean asked tiredly.
“SAY YES.” The boys begged as Dean turned to them.
“Where are your parents?” Crowley asked as Eve looked down.
“They are a bit much at first, the family, but they are so amazing,” Gabriel reassured. “Coming from an outsider’s perspective.”
“He is...morally.” Dean reminded him. “At least for me…Help me get him into my bed.”
“One Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato and a donut?” Claire spoke. “Nine eighty-seven.” Dean moved to pull out his card as Claire eyed the expensive black credit card.
Benny patched up Crowley’s head in the medical wing, Crowley unable to look at him as Benny cleaned and tended to the wound. Benny was in love with him and...Crowley had no idea Benny...did. Crowley tried to think of any sign he missed. God, had he been so obsessed with Castiel that he hadn’t noticed...His true mate was right next to him, already madly in love with him…
It seemed like forever.
“Gardening? I would never have the patience.” Gabriel breathed. “I don’t even think my cactus is alive.”
“A-Adam-” Dean choked out almost realizing why he had run out, tears already threatening to spill from his eyes.
“I will visit as soon as I can. I-... I’m sure once the pirate king has an heir he will let me come and visit. Besides, I must see to it mother and brother are returned.” Castiel breathed kissing each one of them softly before he turned towards the carriage and got in. Not wanting to cry, Gabriel climbed in after him. Castiel waved goodbye to his sisters as the carriage took off. Dean and Sam on their horses as they followed the carriage.
“More like what year are you in.” Rowena corrected. “Seventeen sixty.”
“Oooo.” Castiel teased Gabriel who covered his face. “How about before I leave, we take a selfie,” Castiel spoke as Gabriel lit up. “I will make up myself just for you so you can post it.”
“I-I don’t know how to make it up to you,” Charlie stated.
“It’s okay-” Dean tried. Crowley softly touched Eve stopping her from moving her ankle.
___________________________________________________________________________-
“No, why?” Dean asked petting Riot. Riot was going nuts.
“For how long?” Dean breathed sobbing yanking away. “How long till you remember?”
“Jesus.” Sam tried to protect himself as he trying to blink the pepper spray from his eyes.
“I love you too.” Dean hummed back as he kissed her forehead a bit of blood smeared on her face which Dean wiped away.
The last was a photo of himself. The last one he smiled in. The last time he remembered him smiling. He ripped his mother out of the photo, slowly and delicately before he folded her up and placed it in her pocket before he lowered his own picture in. Winding the music box one last time, he watched the small ballerina move inside. Going around, around, and around before he sighed slowly lowering it into the ground.
“Thank god.” Dean breathed. “I feel like I smell.”
“Stop.” Benny pulled the teen away from Chuck’s rage.
When the sound of glass shattering and a sudden halt of the carriage made them crash into the door of their carriage. The door opened making Gabriel tumble out but Castiel’s quick hands grabbed him holding him up from going down the cliffside. Castiel glanced up to see what had stopped him. An arrow had flown through the carriage with a rope keeping them planted. Castiel turned following who shot the arrow to see Dean on horseback, The bow in hand lining up another shot. Another arrow shot through the carriage with a connected rope slamming like the other into a tree. How long would this hold them?
“You are the worst.” Castiel rolled his eyes. “You almost gave us away for noticing.”
“I would...hate for something to happen to me because you weren’t close.” Castiel breathed as Dean helped him out of his top. Castiel tossed the top to the ground before Castiel untied his pants. Letting them fall in front of Dean exposing his naked body to him. Dean eyed him as Castiel walked towards the bath, Castiel turned to eye him. “...Coming?”
“Nice to meet you,” Anna stated bowing her head before slowly following the kids. Castiel’s eyes moved to Dean seeing the hint of sadness in his eyes. He could sense his mate’s sadness like a punch in the gut.
“Touching.” Dean breathed as Castiel lightly slapped him. Dean sniffed tiredly closing his eyes. “Can I have some water?”
“Dean?” Chuck breathed as the ambulance pulled up, Chuck sadly closing his eyes before Chuck moved out of the way as the paramedics went to Dean. Chuck panted seeing them trying to revive Dean before his eyes fell to the teen struggling under Benny. Chuck stormed over pulling up the hood of the teen seeing, horns on his head. He was a supernatural being. Chuck glanced up at Benny in anger.
“Will do,” Rowena stated ushering Crowley out of the office to follow his order. Castiel sighed once they left their office. Castiel leaning back into his chair as his work phone started to go off. Castiel paused seeing the name pop up on his phone for a face chat. He pushed answer as Dean popped up on the phone. Dean was half asleep looking at him in bed.
“No.” Castiel shook his head covering his face.
“I just think….life is short and damn your father for keeping your brothers away from one and another.” Castiel touched his face. “I brought all of us down because I want you to reconnect.”
“I used to love my mother bathing me,” Dean spoke which gained Sam’s attention. “...When I was younger, she would always take me with her and took the time to wash my hair. I loved her hands in my hair. She would always take her time with it. Always used her body oils and stuff on me, I always smelled like flowers again. Kids used to tease me a lot, but I didn’t care…I would give anything if I could smell like flowers.” Sam said nothing feeling Dean taking his time to wash his fur. Sam understood why Dean liked it. When...someone truly cared about you, small little actions meant the world.
“Did he say anything else?” Michael asked as Castiel’s face fell.
__________________________________________________________________
“They aren’t real.” Castiel lied. “I know. I’m not mom. I wish you’d stop worrying that I’m going to snap.”
“...Want a beer?” Dean offered casually but Castiel frowned seeing it wasn’t what he wanted to be asked.
“What about the mission?” Jess blinked.
“...I love you, mom.” Castiel breathed as Rowena's heart broke at that. He seemed so scared.
“You just want attention, huh, buddy.” Bobby leaned down nuzzling Booker.
“Shug,” Michael spoke chewing as Castiel blinked. “Thanks to you, they are pretty full for a while.”
“Even perfect people have enemies,” Lucifer commented as Michael pulled out pictures of Castiel and his friends in selfies.
“You don’t have wings?” Sam asked as Ben beamed.
“Dean,” The Fae repeated, Dean waited for a reaction but received none. The Fae didn’t recognize him.
“Long story, this is Gabriel,” Sam commented as Sam eyed them back. “Uh...Who’s your friend?”
“Why don’t you leave that one on the floor?” Dean offered as he pulled the second larger bowl of food to their table. “They can share it.”
“Okay, we will have to verify,” Michael stated.
“I-I tried to save your soul!” Castiel breathed angrily as the man scoffed. “Do...you know what they do to you when your time comes?!”
“So what do we need to do?” Gabriel asked.
“Dean?” Castiel ran across following him as Dean panted in emotions. Dean turned to look at him in uncontrollable anger. Castiel knew the jig is up. “...Okay, so I know you’re mad-” Castiel laughed nervously as Dean threw his hand back punching him hard in the nose. The alpha groaned holding his bloody nose, as Dean stormed back to the Limo shaking his bruising hand.
A loud roaring growl escaped from behind them causing the kids to scream as Anna could only turn in seconds being grabbed roughly by her arm. Causing her to scream, Castiel putting pressure on it, it caused her to fall to her knees from the pain.
“You got her?” Dean asked as Crowley nodded. Dean smiled at them before turning to leave.
____________________________________________________________________________
Eve woke to the sound of people talking outside her room, Eve sat up as she heard what sounded like the queen and someone else. Eve climbed out of bed careful of her ankle she walked to the door peering out the opened door.
____________________________________________________________________________
“I got it the first time, Mary.” John blew her off rubbing her face as Mary gritted her teeth.
Castiel walked into the house, his head swimming with what Dean said. He watched the innocent Corgi transform into a human dropping off the rabbits they had onto the table before changing back. Castiel needed to talk to Gabriel about this. He needed to carefully bring this up-.
Did he sin too much?
“Are you stalking me?” Castiel eyed him as the man thankful for the stop took deep breaths holding his knees.
“Don’t worry about Gabriel. Consider him as part of the family. He won’t run to the media.” Dean reassured which made Castiel admitted a little more relaxed. “He knows everything everyone else in my family knows.” Castiel nodded happily to feel open and normal for a change.
“Glad you asked.” Castiel beamed pulling back the tray cover causing Dean to laugh. Dean looked over his favorite fast food place with his favorite burgers and fries. Dean hadn’t had with a while.
“Gabriel can be the backup.” Dean stubbornly frowned.
“Why?” Castiel asked concerned.
“Just...one,” Dean whispered. The man searched Dean’s eyes, Dean smiled softly as though...he could read his thoughts. “...That...I can do.” Dean leaned down slightly to kiss the man when Castiel’s heart pounded at the thought. Could Castiel sit idly by? Watching this man sell his soul? Castiel closed his eyes, his heart pounding. Castiel squeezed his eyes closed harder as he had vivid flashes of memories of blood and the sounds of the room were overwhelming. Castiel’s eyes shot open standing up before their lips touched.
“Let me rephrase.” Castiel corrected. “When was the last time you wanted company?” Dean said nothing. Dean reached for his beer but it was empty, Castiel held out a small milk bottle which Dean took without argument. Dean opened it drinking it down. “...Did this start before Savior-”
“That seems to be the plan,” Castiel stated. “They don’t care if I love them, just if I have relations with them.”
“I worry when it starts snowing your wings will be cold. So I was going to knit you a cover for your wings.” Dean stated as Sam turned to look at him.
