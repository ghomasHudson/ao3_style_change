“Shut it, Sam.” Dean grumbled at his brother who was looking at him with a raised eyebrow and amusement shining all over his annoying face. He tried to relax his face and stop his heart from hammering in his chest so loudly. Someone was bound to hear it.
to ignore.
“Hi Cas.” Dean could feel relief wash through him at the sight of Cas standing at the doorway. He hadn’t even noticed that Cas wasn’t wearing his trench when they’d left, it was perched on the back of the sofa. He looked almost naked without it, and good. Cas looked good naked. Whoa! He should
I'm about to whine, feel free to ignore it, but goddamnit this chapter was an annoying chapter to write! I woved to never, ever, ever, ever again write straight from an episode! No matter how good it is and how full of gay love it is or how inspired I am! Also, Richard! Couldn't you have at least edited this episode properly in a linear way?
“I don’t know.” Dean hated the way the words came out of his mouth; he hated admitting that he had no idea what to do. They had gone through his pockets and found nothing to explain what Cas was going through. No hex bags or nothing. There were no markings on his body either and other than fever, all his muscles locked in place and being unconscious, there was nothing really wrong with him that they could tell.
“Boyfriend?” Dean started pacing the bathroom, trying to rid himself of nervous energy. “I’m Cas’s boyfriend? What kind of a case is this?” Dean should’ve asked more, should’ve demanded he’d be let in on the loop before hightailing it out of the bunker.
him with his torso while doing it. Dean’s heart was hammering inside his chest and he felt paralyzed to the spot. Cas started to nuzzle his face on Dean’s back and Dean scrambled to the other end of the bed.
Dean was startled awake by the strange sensation of someone running fingers through his hair, combing it. For a few seconds he was disoriented until he remembered what had happened before. Cas was sitting on the bed, legs crossed and staring at him with a his eyes strangely wide. He almost looked spooked.  Relief washed over Dean and he felt like a ton of weight had been lifted off of him.
“I don’t know! We split up to talk to the families. We were supposed to meet up at the car and when Cas didn’t show I went to search for him. When I found him he just toppled over.”
Dean jumped the fence with ease and swallowed a curse when he landed on a fallen branch and nearly sprained his ankle in the process. Dean crouched himself and ran under the window to the back door where Sam was waiting with his cat bone knife infused with cobra venom at the ready. The plan was for Cas to cause a ruckus and for them to go in quietly and take the baddie out. Dean had his gun out and poised in front of him. The adrenaline was starting to run and Dean took in a deep breath and with a nod towards Sammy, they entered the house.
“Don’t do that!” A shrill voice shouted at him from the blackness but Simon had eyes only for the cat staring back at him, sitting two feet away from him, tail swishing furiously behind it.
“Cas! Cas! Cas, wake up buddy!” Dean shook Cas from the shoulders and he tried not to groan out loud when Cas’ head stayed stiffly between his shoulders. It was like Cas was holding himself perfectly still. That, or someone from Hogwarts came and shot a full-body bind curse at him. Stiff as a board, but not light as a feather. It was freaking scary!
He propped the pillows on his bed, kicked off his shoes and leaned on the wall while surfing through the channels. Grumblingly he settled on an episode of
What a load of crap! Suddenly he’d turned into some chick? Dean could feel himself grimacing outwardly at the thought. It was nothing new, the constant battering he received from inside himself. No one was as harsh of a critic about all things revolving around Dean Winchester than Dean Winchester himself.
“You’re him,” Mary was advancing Crowley “King of Hell.” The way she said it spoke volumes on just how little Mary thought of Crowley. Now, Dean wasn’t on team Crowley but for some reason he didn’t like the way Mary acted around him.
“Yes. You need to keep fighting.”
Dean was leaning on the door and fishing out his phone once he got his breathing under control. Sam answered on the second ring.
“Damnit, Cas! You’re not supposed to do stuff like that!” Dean felt off kilter, flung across the galaxies without a space suit and a security rope. Of course Cas didn’t know that the freaking angel-child! Of course he would have to explain it to him. But how do you say to your friend that his thumb sucking activities caused his dick to seriously malfunction? And how do you explain to said angel that you only sucked someone’s thumb like that in the privacy of a bedroom and/or with your sexual partner, never with your platonic friend? You couldn’t! That would just lead to more questions and he didn’t want to hear them or try to answer them.
The next morning Dean woke up with a something heavy and warm on his chest. The pressure felt kind of nice and Dean struggled to open up his eyes. Once he did there were eyes staring back at him; Castiel’s incredibly blue eyes. Although the colour was spot on everything else was not. There was a black cat sitting on top of his chest, a cat which had Cas’ eyes. Dean stared at the cat stupidly before remembering that Cas was turning in to a cat; or rather had already turned in to a cat.
Dad had been furious that Sam had left. He’d tried to placate the situation, telling that Sam needed to do what he wanted to do otherwise they were going to lose him forever. But John wasn’t so easily calmed. He’d gone off on his own, leaving Dean behind, alone for the first time in years. That time it wasn’t his choice. That time he had been abandoned and he hated the feeling. He’d been abandoned, left behind, cast out like a pariah.
“This is Dean Winchester calling on behalf of Bobby Singer. I read your email and I’m pretty sure we’re dealing with something else than animals and I think I can help you.” The line went quiet. Before Dean had a chance to say anything a quiet sob reached his ears. Stefano sounded relieved and almost started crying at the other end of the phone.
“Put the gun down, Sam.” Dean whispered out from the corner he’d burrowed himself in an hour or so ago. As soon as Sam came in to view he was trying to motion for him to shut the hell up but his ass of a brother decided to ignore him.
Dean wasn’t really paying attention to the conversation. He was too busy rubbing circles over the back of Cas’s hand. Cas was warm against his side. It felt perfect and like that was where he belonged.
“He kept,” Dean took a deep breath and tried not to show how embarrassed he was, “he kept nuzzling and rubbing himself all over me, man.”
“Hey Bitch, why don’t you mess with someone more your size?” As lines go this one was bad but Dean’s head was messed up. The Goddess was actually about five feet in size and delicate but with more strength that was allowed. Dean pulled out his gun and shot a few bullets through her hoping to at least slow her down. She glanced at the blood flowing from her chest and her face turned into fierce anger. Had he had the time to gulp and say ‘oh shit’, Dean would’ve but before he could say or do anything Bastet had him lifted up the floor by his throat. How the hell did she manage that! She was five feet long! She revealed her teeth, the long narrow and white canines shining ominously at Dean. The teeth sank to his shoulder and hot pain went through Dean and nearly had him seeing white. He could feel the teeth pulling, tearing his skin as she shoot her head left and right.
“Obviously.” The one word didn’t veil the annoyance Crowley felt for their stupidity.  “Do you know what you’ve done?” Crowley was angry and trying to hold it in and failing. Behind the anger Dean could see a hint of fear. There weren’t a lot of things Crowley feared. “Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?” Dean felt annoyed they were about to be schooled by the King of Hell.
Finally he’d finally gotten his mouth on the breasts everyone in the locker room had talked about with admiration. She had the biggest tits in the school and he’d had his mouth on them! He couldn’t wait to tell Tom and the gang about it!
“Do we have a working theory yet?” Cas asked while heading back to his truck.
Somewhere after three episodes of
“Sammy!” Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “He’s not in his right mind.”
He blamed it on the domestication that came with discovering the Men of Letters bunker. For the first time since he was four he felt like he had a home other than Baby. He had stability and routines and a room he could call his own with all his shit and everything. He didn’t feel the need to drink so much to forget the fact that his life consisted of hunting things that went bump in the night. Now for most nights he could sleep in his boxers and not fully clothed, just waiting for something to burst through the door and try to kill him or Sammy. He could relax and know that the bunker was a solid fortress and that nothing could come at him during the night. He was safe, Sammy was safe. Well, as safe as hunters could be these days.
from me. And that — that I cannot abide.” The confusion settling in wasn’t helping the situation at all. The looks of his brother and Mary were enough to convince they had no idea what Ramiel was talking about. Though this wouldn’t be the first time a demon lied to them. They were kings and queens of lying.
“I’m staying at the same motel we were in before.” Cas was peering at him and Dean almost resisted the urge to press his lips against Cas’s hairline. They drove on in silence and all too soon they reached the motel. Dean released his arm from around Cas and turned off the engine. He felt awkward again.
“Do what?”
Angel, Cas, an Angel and a totally platonic friend.
“After we’ve eaten I think it would be a good idea to check in to a motel and get a few z’s in before Cas and I head out to investigate.” Sam’s voice sounded muddled, like Dean’s ears were filled with cotton balls. He couldn’t turn his eyes away from Cas’ for some reason. It was like Cas had put some kind of angel whammy on him and he was helpless to do anything else than stare. “You okay to hold down the fort and do some research for once?”
“Bodies? Animal disappearances, mutilations?”
“Take these.” Sam was holding a couple of white pills on his palm and a glass of water on the other. Dean took both with gratitude and the water felt amazing going down his throat. “Cas went out on a supply run.” Dean had to fight down the urge to get up from the bed.
thinking about when was the last time he’d seen Cas. Not that he’d been counting or anything but it had been two weeks, four days and thirteen hours.
Sam dropped the lighter and Ramiel was surrounded by fire. The flutter of fire made Dean feel a bit safer. The warmth was calming his nerves. Ramiel was trapped for the time being and they could gather their strength and strike. He didn’t even look scared standing inside the ring, surrounded by three hunters.
The demon grins in response, apparently unconcerned that he has a knife under his chin. The ease of his smile sets Dean further on edge.
Okay… I doubt anyone will hear this, but I’ll try again just in case. I’m heading out of town. The trucks are gone, and there are no bodies–well, there are plenty of demons and croats, but none of ours–so I assume you all went home. I’m en-route to you now, although I have yet to find a functioning car. I’ll keep looking, but in the event that I have to carry out the rest of my journey on foot, I estimate I’ll arrive in approximately… two weeks. If you can hear this, I could, uh, use a lift.
The beads clink softly as Dean pushes aside the curtain in the entryway to Cas’s cabin, but the room is otherwise quiet. Castiel is laying on the floor in the center of a Persian carpet, knees bent and hands on his stomach. His eyes are closed and his breath is slow and Dean hesitates before turning to leave.
“You didn’t!” The horror was evident in Dean’s voice. His phone vibrated again.
The sound the barn wall being crashed in and Crowley screaming pulled Dean back from the dark thoughts swirling in his. Crowley was lay still, probably unconscious after being thrown through the wall and Ramiel stepped in through the hole taking his place inside the ring of fire like it was predestined. It should have made Dean feel good that they’d managed to trap Ramiel but instead he felt a coldness of fear running in his veins.
The Crazy Cat Lady Goddess ran in to the room and Sam just about got behind the door when she emerged. Dean tried to fight for air as he was flung across the room and into the wall. All air escaped his lungs and his side was hurting like hell. It didn’t feel like he’d broken any ribs this time, small mercies. Cracked ribs healed slow!
“He’s back to his previous form.” Sam said and Dean had to open his eyes to look at his brother. He was rubbing his neck and the worried ‘we need to talk’ look on his face. “He —“
“You split up? Why the hell would you do that?”
₰ ₰ ₰
“Any you need me for this why?” He was doing the head tilting and eyebrow furrowing thing he usually did when he didn’t understand something. Dean tried not to think of it as adorable and failed amazingly.
So it seems now I have to put my thinking cap on and round up this story in a neat package with a nice purple pow on top.
“Wait a second, the demons, they were yours.” Sam accused and Dean felt confused, he hated that. He wanted to ask but at the same time he didn’t want to show his confusion. Knowledge was power and it wasn’t good to let a demon know you were out of the loop.
“He was quite a good looking fellow wasn’t he?”
Dean’s balls were sweating inside the leather and while before it had been a tight fit, it was now even more painful to be in them. The man in front of Cas was standing all too close to his Cas.  Cas was saying something to him with a serious look on his face and Dean could feel his pulse quicken as the man leaned in and put his hand on Cas’s side, sliding it to his ass and taking hold of something that looked like a tail and swishing it around. Dean could feel his blood boiling. How dare he put his hand on
“There’s gonna be lots of cats loitering about and because the delicate flower he is, Dean’s decided to sit this one out.” Dean resisted the urge to throw his keys at his fucktard of a brother and only ran his thumb across his neck, mouthing
“Hey Sam, forward this info to mom and tell her she might be dealing with a Shojo.” Dean hastily wrote out the name, number and location of the Shojo case and pushed it towards Sammy.
“Crowley?” Sam sounded just as confused as Dean felt.
There you have it, another chapter, hopefully you enjoyed it!
“Sure.” The deep gravelly voice answered and Dean threw an appreciative glance at the Angel by his side. He didn’t want to think about what it would’ve felt like if he’d refused. He resisted the urge to put pedal to the medal and hightailing it from the parking lot and settled on slowly rolling to the traffic.
“I’m sure.” Dean swatted the hand away from his face. At least he didn’t offer to take his temperature with his finger again. That had seriously caused non-platonic images run through his head about Cas and nakedness and his finger up a certain orifice. “I don’t bounce back as easily as I did in my twenties is all.”
“How do you feel Dean?” Finally he came closer to the bed and Dean lifted himself to a sitting position.
“Why not?” There he went again with the head tilting. Honestly, sometimes the dude had a way of looking at you like you were the most peculiar person in the world. “Or did you want a taste yourself?”
Cas was on the floor, poking at the carpet with his index finger and Dean tried not to grimace. Who knew what lived on those carpets. While Cas was busy exploring the room and in no obvious danger, Dean pulled out dad’s journal, flipping through it, trying to find anything helpful in there. Dean was 99% certain he wouldn’t find anything useful there because he’d read through the whole thing countless of times while searching for his dad.
“The quicker we find out what’s going on in here the faster we can get Cas back to normal.” Dean had no counter for that. He was torn between wanting to head out and protect his brother and staying in taking care of Cas.
“I had a small accident—“
“The oldest of the old demons. The first generation
Baby didn’t actually need a wash but Dean needed to do something with his hands. Every few minutes he kept glancing at the door but Sam didn’t come to find him. He always came to find him if he made a scene like he did just now. A groan escaped his lips and Dean pressed his forehead against Baby. What was he thinking? Nothing good that’s for sure. If Sam was to come by the garage, Dean would deny everything and say the little shit had been hallucinating.
“Hi Cas.” Dean could feel a smile pulling at his lips. Cas was awake. The spooked look was suddenly transformed to a small smile and he kept squinting his eyes at Dean. “How are you feeling?”
“He looked hot, admit it.”
Dean didn’t know why Sammy wasn’t as hurt as he was that their mother didn’t want to spend time with them, didn’t want to be around them. She wanted to hunt alone, she wanted to be left alone. Dean had been a kid when she died and now he was a grown ass man and his mother wanted to abandon him. People did that, they abandoned Dean and he shouldn’t even be that surprised but there he was, taken back by the bitter abandonment of his mother. He should’ve been used to that. People didn’t want to stay with Dean Winchester.
They arrived at the closest affordable and semi-clean motel not too far from the cat corner. Already Dean could feel his throat itching but he was sure it was more of a mental thing than due to an actual allergic reaction. Dean was more than happy to let Sam deal with booking a room while he stayed behind with Baby. He leaned heavily to her side almost dozing off in the warmth of the sun.
“Fine,” he finally agreed “be safe.” Sam left the room with a promise to bring some food back with him.
The muscles on his back rippled with each move and his bicep was bulging as he pulled Dean behind him. Cas’s hips had a slight sway to them and it made his ass look amazing bouncing in front of his eyes. An image of him on his knees, biting the flesh in Cas’s ass made blood pool in his groin.
Dean felt awkward as they headed to his car. In a last effort to give Cas’s new friends a good image of him as a boyfriend, Dean rushed to the passenger side door and held it open for Cas. Cas surprised him by pressing a kiss on his cheek before sliding in.
“The fuck!?” His knees scraped the pavement and the jeans broke over the left knee. Shit! These were his favourite pair! Who the fuck left a fucking messenger bag lying around the street? Simon heard a quiet feminine cooing coming from the narrow street between two houses.
! There weren’t a lot of things that could kill him but that didn’t stop him from worrying.
‘Protect Sammy’ had been his big brother duty from the day he was born and that role had grown exponentially the day their mother died and dad had given Sam over to him with the words “Take your brother outside as fast as you can and don’t look back!” while the house burned around them. He’d shielded Sam with his body, clutching him close and vowing to try his hardest so Sammy wouldn’t have to feel as terrified as he had been at that moment.
Dean couldn’t stop the small yelp from escaping between his lips as Cas took a step closer to him. His senses were too aware of the man coming closer to him. Dean’s eyes closed involuntarily and his lips tingled in anticipation. A whiff of Castiel’s shampoo made Dean lightheaded because it was the same he used and somehow Cas’ smell mixed with something of his made him ache.
“Ramiel, Prince of Hell. It’s catchy, it rhymes.” Crowley looked way too pleased with himself that Dean wanted to hit him. “And he’s going to kill each and every one of you.”
“I bet you’re enjoying you made it here, huh?” The man who had opened the door for him said with a wink as he walked past him with a couple of beers in hand. “Your man looks delicious enough to eat.”
“He actually seemed quite glad to be rid of him to be honest. More trouble than he’s worth.” Sam told between bites and looked more pleased than he should be. Like scheming pleased, Sammy looked like he did when he was planning on a prank. “But Cas, he looked like he might actually blush with the attention.”
“Then yes, he did—“
Cas turned his gaze towards him at the feel of Dean’s palm in his. This was Cas after all. He was only afraid of what would happen once the night was over and he had to stop this act. Dean pulled Cas’s hand towards his mouth, kissing the knuckles before starting up a conversation with the woman across him.
Dean wanted to scream “YES!” so hard but he couldn’t open his mouth to say it. Cas’s fingers continued to unbutton his shirt, eyes staring intently up at him. All he could hear was his heart beating wildly in his chest. He was already hard and the tight leather was making it nearly painful.
“I just need to stretch out.” Why was he explaining this to a Cas? For all he knew he had no idea what he was saying. Damn he was tired. Dean turned to his stomach, cradling the pillow under his head and closed his eyes.  Before he had a chance to fall asleep Dean felt a weight settle on his back. Cas was half lying on him. With an alarmed glance at his sleeping brother Dean decided it would be more easier to let Cas be where he was and just get on with the sleeping. The weight and presence felt extremely good and Dean hadn’t had physical contact like this in some time. Besides if he moved and pushed Cas off there would be noises and his idiot of a brother would wake up and Dean wasn’t up to dealing with the jerkface. So, he let Cas be where he was, nuzzling his face between Dean’s shoulder blades and fell asleep. It felt good and Dean was too tired to think about platonic friends and sleeping under said platonic friend and what Sam might think if he woke up and saw them.
? Foggiest? Really Sam?”
“We are fighting. We are fighting for you Cas.” A wash of relief went through Dean with Sam’s words. It meant that he wasn’t going to have to save Cas on his own.
They could hear the clanking and meowing at the front of the house and a woman’s voice cooing. Dean followed Sam in and that’s when all hell broke loose. The house was filled with cats and they started meowing on seeing them. Screw guard dogs, guard cats were efficient as well.
Cas grasped Dean’s face between his palms, forcing Dean to look at him straight in the eye. The weight of Cas’s eyes on him was what tipped him over the edge and Dean came with a groan. Cas followed closely behind. Cas looked bright and glowing in the throes of passion Dean had to shield his eyes from it.
“And like you said, you’re family. And we don’t leave family behind.” It was written on the Winchester family-shirt. Their family was small but the Winchesters never left family behind. Cas’s eyes were so bright and his jaw muscles were tight. His breathing was way too loud and his chest heaved with the unshed tears.
“You idiots! You are all going to die.” Crowley with his impeccable suit appeared at the centre of the barn.
In the last few months he’d started shyly to think about a future where he might grow old; a future where he might get to keep his family whole. He’d learned early on that people closest to him had a tendency to vanish or die. He always thought of himself as a visitor in other people’s lives; a transient with no real, lasting connections to anyone other than Sam, his dad and Bobby; two out of three dead, oh the joy. And his relationship with Sam was rarely steady. There were times they hadn’t been speaking to one another or they couldn’t stand being in the near vicinity of the other but somehow they’d made it through either way.
we got a runner!
It’s still dark out, but the camp is bustling. Through the open windows, Dean can hear the casual chatter, the incessant banging and thumping of munitions being loaded into the back of the truck, Chuck calling out the names and quantities of different items to keep track of stock. He tunes it all out. “Any questions?” He looks up from the map on the large table in the center of the room and glances at the people that surround it. Benny lifts an eyebrow.
“Fuck,” Cas curses under his breath, and his voice is hoarse. He wonders for a moment why his throat is so raw before he registers the biting cold, how frozen solid he feels. Despite himself, he breathes out a rueful huff of laughter. He used to be able to not even feel the cold and now look at him. Being human is still so uncomfortable, he has no idea how Dean manages to–
He turns on his transceiver to make another attempt at communication, but it only offers him a pathetic burst of crackling white noise before giving out completely, it’s battery drained. Castiel curses under his breath and tucks it back into one of his pockets. He sighs, closing his eyes to try to get some sleep, but his stomach protests, achingly empty. The few rations he had brought with him on the mission had been finished for a while now, and while the pulsing of his headache and the nausea of his near-constant fear had prevented him from fully feeling it, the hunger has now returned with a vengeance. He feels, in a word, awful, and he clenches his fist until he draws blood from his grubby palms just to feel something, anything else.
“Give yourself some credit,” Dean assures him, with a hand on his shoulder. Benny looks back up at him, his lips twisted into something that only barely resembles a smile. “You can win this, brother. I know you can. You’ve just gotta do it without me.”
Dean closes the door behind him without responding. His gaze sweeps over the prisoner, but it doesn’t linger. He turns instead to the lone cart in the middle of the otherwise barren room, acting on autopilot as he checks that every instrument he may need is in place. Nothing’s missing, though. Everything’s perfectly prepared as always, even without Cas’s help.
JODY: all good here, on our way.
DEAN: Yeah… I know.
Dean takes a trembling breath, and it wracks through the whole of his body as if every part of himself, every cell, every atom, wants to fall away completely because even that would be better than this pain he feels. This hollowness.
BENNY: Hey, Charlie. Are you on? I just got back.
CASTIEL: (chuckles quietly) If you say so. Hey, I’ve got to go now, but we’ll talk later, okay?
are just another irritating black-eyed bastard I have to deal with, and if you don’t start talking about things that are actually useful to me, I’ll crush you underneath my heel without a second thought.”
–I know without a doubt that he won’t blame you either.”
“This a sure thing?” Dean sends him a questioning glance. “I’m not sayin’ I don’t trust your judgment, but a fifteen-hour drive just to find one demon who we only know about because
BENNY: Fuck, what happened?
being created, but you seem. Almost detached from it? And I don’t get that. There has to be more to it all, right?”
CASTIEL: (sighs) I’ll live.
“When you said that you
MISSION SUCCESSFUL. CAPTURED THE DEMON BELPHEGOR. WILL INTERROGATE. NO FATALITIES, BUT CAS, HE’S–
Cas pulls his jacket tight around himself, but it’s not much of a barrier against the freezing cold. His journal and pen lie on the floor by his side. He looks around himself lethargically, taking in the fading wallpaper, peeling at the edges, and the thick layer of dust and grime covering everything in sight. It’s a small house he’s found himself in, and it was clearly modest and sparse even before it was ransacked and ruined when the panic began. At least he’s found shelter, though–if only for a couple of hours.
don’t do this to yourself.”
“Say it!” Dean snaps, letting the knife he’s holding clatter to the ground. Without thinking he pulls out the pistol strapped to his leg and holds it to Lee’s forehead. Lee exhales shakily, hesitating only for a moment before looking Dean directly in the eye.
“Come on, brother. You really want to do this? You really want to know?”
CASTIEL:  I have to make this qui–
Castiel skips that part, of course. Dean doesn’t need to hear it.
GOING TO QUESTION LEE NOW. HOPEFULLY GET SOMETHING USEFUL OUT OF HIM. AND THEN… I’M GONNA KILL HIM. I DON’T CARE ANYMORE.
“Of course, Dean.”
why you came here. Yeah, yeah, I’ll be sober enough to go to the briefing, you can relax.”
As soon as Castiel sees them, he knows. It's the tattered shoes, the bloodstained, unkempt clothes, the wicked glint in their eyes, wild, and drunk on a bloodlust that’s stripped every last ounce of humanity from their pathetic sallow bodies.
LEE: Clear.
Hello? Please, there’s something  headed my way, my coordina–
It’s the cabin farthest away from their site, but Dean reaches it quickly. He takes long strides over the week-old snow that’s scattered on the gravel path leading away from the rest of the camp. The surrounding woods are dark, illuminated only by the lights that had been set up when they first arrived here, but even those are few and far between. It doesn’t bother Dean, though. He knows these woods like the back of his hand by now, and he’s walked this path enough times to be sick of it. As he approaches, the door swings open and light spills out, silhouetting Castiel’s familiar figure. His expression is grim, but that’s hardly unusual these days.
“You mean before…”
Before Dean and After Dean.
“Hey, are we… we’re good, right? We’ll be okay?” Dean's voice is gruff, a feeble attempt to appear unaffected, but Castiel sees right through him. He looks back at Dean, and the blue of his eyes are clouded with an awful mixture of heartache and fondness. His lips tug into a small but earnest smile.
“I should’ve listened to you, Dean,” he rasps, the once deep and steady rumble of his voice now feeble and shaky. “You were right all along. We didn't get a happy ending.”
“Damn it.” Castiel turns off his radio irritably and puts it back into the pocket of his coat. The pounding in his head has yet to go away and the incessant crackle of static on his rapidly dying transceiver certainly isn’t helping. He scrubs his hands over his face before wrapping his arms around himself in a futile attempt to maintain a modicum of body heat. Cas has been walking for hours now, backtracking in the direction of the camp, but as soon as he’d reached the highway he had cut into the woods by the roadside. No demons or croats had crossed his path yet, but there's no such thing as being too careful at a time like this. If that means he takes the longer route, that he keeps moving, that he can't even start a fire, then so be it. He just needs to get back home. Back to the camp. Back to Dean.
“Hey chief,” Benny calls to him, but his familiar greeting is more sober than usual. Dean looks down to meet his eyes. He approaches carefully, striding closer to the doorway that Dean has found himself unable to move from. Benny’s eyes dart down to Dean’s hands, where the splatter of blood is still visible. He hasn’t bothered to wash it off yet.
“How could I not be happy? I get to wake up to your handsome face every morning,” Dean replies, still grinning, “I never thought I’d have this - the apple pie life; married with a kid and a dog. I never thought I’d feel this relaxed, or this in love. I never thought I’d be able to call you mine.”
Dean pulls a chair close to the kitchen counter, then he picks Jack up and stands him on the chair, so he can help make the pancake batter. He gets all the stuff out of the cupboards that they’ll need; bowl, scales, whisk, flour, eggs, milk, baking powder, sugar, salt, and butter.
“Of course you can, but I think you need to get daddy up first,” Dean replies with a cheeky smile, “you could try jumping on him.”
“Dada, can we play a game?” Jack asks, only briefly looking up.
“The foam animals!” Jack replies excitedly, reaching his hands up and making a grabbing motion.
They continue like this for a good 20 minutes until Jack finally gets bored.
“No, I want to keep playing,” Jack whines in response.
Cas can’t wait to see what life may bring next for him and his beautiful little family.
Thankfully, the bath was already done before the commotion started, so Dean puts Jack straight into the tub. “What toys do you want today?” Dean reaches for the basket that is almost overflowing with every bath toy imaginable.
“I don’t know about the last two things, but, honestly? Yes, that is what I want.”
[ January 26, 2014. 05:28 ]
Cas exhales unsteadily and pulls out a pen and a small journal from a pocket inside of his jacket. A soft rueful smile tugs at his lips when he remembers that Dean was the reason he started using a journal in the first place. He opens the book to its first empty page and stares at it for a long while. It isn’t until his fingers feel like they’re near frozen solid and the sky’s already begun to lighten that Castiel finally starts to write.
“Damn it.” Castiel grits his teeth, trying to will away the pounding his head, and, hastily, he fishes the transceiver from his pocket and turns it on.
The truck rumbles away from the camp, and, unbeknownst to Dean, a small, weather-worn journal lies abandoned on Castiel’s desk.
Dean’s smile doesn’t falter for a second, and his hands are warm against Cas’s clammy cheeks, so Castiel just kisses him, because, at this point, what more can be done?
WE HAD TO LEAVE WITHOUT HIM, THERE WERE CROATS ON OUR TAIL, WAY TOO MANY, AND WE HAD INJURED PPL THAT NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION ASAP BUT... GOD, I DON'T GET IT. HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME WHEN SOMEONE CALLED IN A SIGHTING AND THEN HE WAS JUST GONE. HE WOULDN'T ANSWER HIS RADIO,
“You a hungry bunch aren’t you?” A loud chorus of meowing answered followed by a laugh. “Now hold up, wait —“
“He’s such an adorable little Angel when someone tries to flirt with him.” Dean got a weird pang in his chest when Sam called Cas “Angel” he might recognize as jealousy if he let himself think about it more than a second longer.
stop with that line of thinking! He’d seen the Angel naked and that had traumatized him for life. Well, actually caused him to have serious dick malfunction and frequent dreams about said Angel without any clothing on him.
Apologies for the long wait! Life, responsibilities, health issues and other shit have taken too much out of my writing time and that has been awful! But here it is, the next chapter! Enjoy!
“Sorry?” And now Sam had the nerve to play stupid. Not on his watch!
“Okay people; let’s get this show on the road!” Dean hollered before patting the hood of Baby fondly and sliding in behind the wheel.
“Hey lady! You can’t leave your shit lying around like this!” Simon shouted to the blackness. A tabby cat was looking at him curiously from on top of a trash can. “My jeans’ ruined you ass! These cost a fortune!” He kicked the bag and treats scattered all around his feet. The tabby cat let out a purr and its tail poised straight up flickered before it jumped down and headed straight to Simon’s feet. Fucking cats!
“The hell?” Dean could feel his throat itching and another sneeze coming through. What the absolute hell? Sam was laughing so hard he was nearly falling over in his chair as Cas meowed frantically. Dean nearly tumbled to the bathroom to his toilet bag where he kept antihistamines and tried not to sneeze his brains out in the process. He could already feel his forehead aching. It was after he gulped down the tablets that he noticed Cas had trailed behind him and was standing like two inches behind him. He was staring at Dean inquisitively, unblinkingly through the mirror. Dean’s throat felt dry all of a sudden and he had to avert his eyes from Cas’.
He tried to concentrate on the journal but words got mumbled up together and jumped at his eyes in the wrong order. Out of the corner of his eye he followed Cas around the room. Dean was fighting down every urge to trail after him because Cas acted so abnormally. He wanted reassurances that things would be okay but he didn’t know who would be able to give them for him. He didn’t even know what had gone wrong, who’d done it and what they could do to make things right. He didn’t like the feeling, not one bit. He wasn’t used to being inactive but he couldn’t imagine leaving Cas behind at the motel nor could he imagine bringing him along for the ride.
In the end Sam had pestered Dean to open the door and a stroppy Cas had emerged and thrown deathly glares at Dean before going towards Sam. He’d changed even more in the few hours he’d been locked in the bathroom. He was no longer just sporting cat ears on top of his head and a beautifully long black tail but he was also starting to grow more hair. It was like his sideburns were on crack and started migrating to his nose which was also shaping itself as more of a cat’s nose.
“We’re in 28.” They grabbed their things and headed to the room. It was your everyday standard motel room with two beds and a private bathroom. Unceremoniously Dean dumped his bag next to the closest bed and conked out on top of the covers, falling asleep almost instantly.
. He couldn’t even put a word for what it was; he couldn’t label it, not that he’d want to anyway. But the need inside was disturbing. It was filling him up, pushing his insides out. It was too big and too
“The hell?” Simon couldn’t move his legs. It was as if someone had glued his feet to the pavement and wrapped some cement around his calves for good measure. He could feel strange tingling at his back and Simon turned around to see what was happening when his vision went neon green before he blacked out completely, the last thing on his mind was how the colour reminded him of the keylime pie his grandma had made last summer that had tasted like shit on toast.
Dean felt his body tightening up as if that would help and act as a shield against the soon to be voiced questions and the worry emanating from Sam.
They’d left the party and headed to Becky’s. She told her parents and little brother were off to see her grandparents and she had the house all to herself. And that! That was textbook scenario for underage sex! They got to her place and Becky started kissing him like it was the only thing keeping her alive. His dick had risen up faster than he could say “Let’s get it on,” and he had pulled the shirt over her head. She hadn’t had any bra on which of course Simon had noticed while walking up to her house because her nipples had perked up in the cool air.
Simon was kicking the empty can of beer in front of him feeling utterly bored and frustrated. Fucking Becky Jameson being a fucking prude frigid cunt! There was no way she couldn’t have known what “Netflix and chill” meant. Everyone knew that! Even the strange smelling kid with beer bottle glasses at school knew that for fuck’s sake!
“I  – uh — Both of you just shut up.” His index finger was pointing at the two of them accusingly like they had done something wrong. Way to go Dean. Good job handling the situation. Luckily they were interrupted by the ringing of his phone. Dean pulled it from his pocket and answered without looking at the name on the screen. “Dean.” He sounded angrier than intended and he had to order himself to take a calming breath.
“Tell us how to cure him.” On the other side of the ring Sam was stepping into position as well.
“What the hell is going on? Where’s Cas? What happened?” Sam lowered the gun put didn’t put it away straight away.
“Yeah man, just completely wiped out.”
“So a dude who just lost a son made a pass at you?” He had to clear his throat because his voice went high all of a sudden.
“I think I got everything,” Sam was doing a last minute check up on the bags to see they had everything before climbing on the passenger side seat. Dean drove off without a word. The dread was expanding as if someone was building a wall with bricks that were filled with small amounts of dread and the feeling of unsureness rose up with each new brick added to the wall. Sam was acting too suspiciously. He had to have something big that he wanted to discuss. It must be because he was waiting to get back to the bunker! Son of a bitch!
“Have it your way.” A long lance materialized from behind Ramiel’s back and Dean was happy for the fight begin. At last he could push all those dark feelings aside and just punch, fight and dodge and hopefully kill the bastard who had stabbed his Cas.
Dean tried not to swerve to the oncoming traffic when Cas’ palm settled on his knee. His eyes flew to Cas’ direction but he was staring out of the passenger side window with a small smile. It was just the two of them and it was only a hand on his knee but something constricted in his abdomen from the contact. Dean fought down the immediate reaction to swat away the hand and settled on drawing comfort from it.

Crowley didn’t have a cure or anything to help with Cas’s situation and he was sceptical they could manage to get it out of Ramiel in time to help. Dean didn’t want to believe it when Crowley said they didn’t have time but he could feel the urgency setting in. He got angry because what use was Crowley if he didn’t have the cure or a way to get the cure out of Ramiel. He was bringing everyone down, most of all Crowley was bringing Dean down, and that was unacceptable. Dean had ordered Crowley to either help them or get the hell out. Crowley had left like the scared vermin he was.
“Quit it, Sam!” Cas was quietly looking around the room, peering under beds and tables, sticking his head behind the curtains and fogging up the window glass. “He’s getting weirder by the minute.”
thorough job of cleaning it. Dean thought he might pass out and die when the piercing blue eyes lifted up to stare straight into his eyes. Dean was embarrassed to find a whimper escaping his mouth.
“I don’t know. It doesn’t feel natural. I’m starting to get tired of all this, travelling around the country, hunting monsters, saving the world. Maybe I should set up a network like Bobby did and only go out on hunts every once and a while.” Evidently the tiredness made him also oversharing. He’d only thought of that maybe like twice and always as a joke. He didn’t actually think about semi-retirement? Right?
“’Cause Sam said you needed help?” He didn’t mean to make it sound like a question but he was so fucking unsure of everything at the moment. He wanted to shake it off but he was glued to the spot. Dean made a conscious effort to first relaxing his eyes which were almost wide open and then forced his muscles to uncoil and act natural. Fake it ‘til you make it! It wasn’t Dean’s motto for no reason and he could feel the tightness escaping from his muscles. Inside he was still wired and aware of everything and thoughts were running miles around his head.
Dean’s stomach was in knots and it was taking all of his willpower not to cross the room and throw Mary away from Cas. This was her fault! He wanted to blame it all on her but a part of him was bashing his head in because he should’ve been able to look after Cas. He should’ve never let him get this bad. He should’ve done something
“Cas can’t really handle flirting.” The familiar gut-punch feeling took over Dean as he held out the beers for his brother and his Angel. No, not
“Why am I even talking about this? I should just hit the hay and stop whining like a kid who dropped his lollipop.”
Dean shut the engine and Sam said something about taking the groceries to the kitchen and disappeared with his bags. This was not good, this was not good. His eyes couldn’t focus on any particular place and he couldn’t get his feet to move out of the comforts of Baby’s frame.
Crowley decided to ignore Mary and nodded towards Cas. “What’s up with Feathers?”
“Yes, Dean. He.” Dean could feel the Cas’ equivalent of an eye roll.
CasCat was staring at him with his head tilted and eyes wrinkled in a way that made Dean think of smiling. Once the CasCat noticed Dean was awake he head butted him. The purring started and Dean couldn’t help but to scratch him behind his ear and smile. CasCat was cute and Dean was spiked with strong antihistamines. He did actually like cat’s after all.
The plan was to hit Ramiel – a freaking Prince of Hell with everything they got. Most of the things in Baby’s trunk was pulled to the barn. They took their places and Dean fought with each moan of pain Cas breathed out the urge to abandon everything and join Cas’s side. They should be looking for a way to cure Cas, not fight some douchebag Prince out to get them.
Before he had a chance to even think about what he was doing, Dean was crossing the room towards Cas and the sleaze-ball who dared to touch his Angel like that.
Before he even knew what was happening, Cas had his hand wrapped around Dean’s wrist, holding it in place as a tongue poked out of Cas’ mouth and licked the drop of sauce from Dean’s thumb. Dean’s mouth hung open as was watching the scene unfold in front of him. After licking the drop Cas leaned in a tiny bit and sucked the tip of his thumb in his mouth.
Two days later Dean was contemplating on if he could get away with a solo hunt. Sam still hadn’t opened his gob about feelings or his worry or anything remotely
“The pictures on the internet magazines weren’t that good so we haven’t had the chance to research them.” Dean tried to keep his eyes open while Cas and Sam talked but it was difficult.
“Isn’t that like a no-no according to the good book?” Not what he was planning on saying but the words flew from his mouth anyway. What the fuck was his mouth doing?
Dean got back to the fight, pulling back the shovel and hitting Ramiel with all he got. Ramiel managed to pull up his lance, blocking the hit before it landed and the vibrations of the block travelled all the way to his shoulders, making Dean’s hands numb for few seconds. Dean and Ramiel were side by side, the lance pushing Dean’s shovel to the ground and seeing his chance, Dean pushed his whole body against Ramiel, making him take a few steps back and release the shovel. He pulled it back again, taking another shot at Ramiel. Ramiel blocked it again and kicked him in the stomach taking the wind out of him and making him drop the shovel. Dean was getting angrier by the second. He wanted to kill the bastard who hurt his Castiel. Ramiel hit him again and this time Dean had to use his hands to block the hit. His arms ached with the blow but he didn’t give up but rather punched Ramiel with all he got again and again. Ramiel butted his head against Dean’s, making him see stars and stumble back before he was hit to the side of his head with the lance. It felt like being punched by a tree.
Dean had finished with the outside and was now cleaning the interior. No Sam in sight. He must have ended the call with Cas a long time ago but still he didn’t come. When Sammy eventually came, he would say that the amount of rabbit food in their fridge was unacceptable and he
Four hours later Dean could feel himself almost shaking with dread. They were almost at the Bunker. Sammy had gone to get the groceries and Dean had decided to remain with Baby. He didn’t want Sam to start pestering him at the store. It would be humiliating and it would end up with people looking at them and parents’ covering their children ears and eyes in disbelief and quiet disapproval staring at them. They’d been there before. It had not been pretty.
They headed back to the couch only to find only one place left. Dean was ready to be chivalrous and offer the seat to Cas when he was pushed down and Cas plopped himself on his lap. Dean couldn’t stop the grin from forming on his face as Cas lifted Dean’s arms around him, cradling himself against Dean’s chest. Dean had died and gone to heaven. Cas fitted in his lap and in his arms like it was made for him. Like they were two pieces of a puzzle.
moment but inside his chest his heart had been hammering and roaring with outrage. And it nearly stopped when Cas had leaned over and smelled the waitress. Luckily he didn’t want to
The man who’d opened the door was dressed as a fairy godmother. “Yes?” He’d asked, blocking the door with his 300 pounds of muscle and pink tulle miniskirt. Dean was desperately aching to ask where the hell the man had found a miniskirt to fit him.
“Cas, how bad is it?” He sounded too wrecked as he watched Cas loosen the tie around his throat and revealed a bit of the skin on his neck and shoulder. Rather than being golden brown and smooth, it was marred with black lines and scars. Dean could taste a bit of bile at the back of his throat at the sight of Cas hurt so bad. He didn’t know how to fix this. He needed to fix this.
“The molecules of this sauce are extremely favourable.” Dean cleared his throat and, not for the first time in his life, he wished he had the will power to control his blood flow. All his blood was now either in his cheeks and the tips of his ears or pooling down to his dick. Suddenly Dean came to the realization his hand had been hovering in front of Cas’ face for too long without the support of Cas’ hand and let it drop to his lap. He was overly conscious of his left hands’ thumb now. It was like it pulsed and Dean tried not to stretch and flex his fingers because of the sensation. Would it be bad if he just stopped washing that thumb? Or excused himself to the toilet and sucked on it himself? Was it normal to be jealous of the pad of your thumb? Holy shit his thumb had been in Cas’ mouth!
“Well, number one: you’re a demon. Number two: you’re a demon. Number three–”
“You’ll hurt me if you don’t let me say goodbye,” Charlie insists. She pulls him closer, paying no mind to the rocks poking at her knees, or to the uncomfortable twist of her body because of the way Cas is sitting, until, finally, Cas gives in and hugs her back. He squeezes his eye shut, as if he’s trying, hopelessly, to will this whole situation away.
Dean turns to face Cas, returning the playful smirk. Unfortunately, before anything else could happen, they hear little footsteps coming up the hallway. Dean grabs some boxers and quickly throws them on, followed by pajama bottoms and a t-shirt, before Jack, who is finally getting to live a childhood, and Miracle come crashing into the bedroom.
“I want to play cowboys!” Jack enthuses. “I’ll go get daddy!” and with that, he runs full speed back indoors to get Cas.
A few minutes later, they all come back out of the house, each of them wearing a cowboy hat and carrying a hobby horse. Dean is wearing a white hat from his personal collection; Cas a beige one, and each of their horse’s colors matches their hats. Jack wears the hat Dean made Cas wear back when they did that one case in Dodge City. Jack doesn’t quite understand this hat’s importance, but it has become his favorite nonetheless. Jack’s horse is black with a white stripe down its nose. Each of them also has a holster with toy revolvers on their hip, and Jack has a Sheriff’s badge pinned to a little faux leather cowboy jacket.
Dean makes his way into the bathroom, followed by Miracle and Jack, “You’re next, buddy,” he tells Miracle as he turns on the taps to get the perfect temperature. “That’s what happens when you eat strawberries; you get the juice all over yourself.” Miracle lets out a little whine; sometimes, Dean swears the pup can understand him.
“You’ll never catch me,” Jack screams, between high-pitched laughter, as he runs off into the living room and dives behind the sofa. Dean is close behind him, also laughing. Cas can hear the chaos; he’s still cleaning up after breakfast. Hearing them like that, Jack squealing as Dean carries him back to the bathroom puts a goofy grin on Cas’s face.
While the bath is running, Jack strips off, in true little kid fashion, and runs into the hallway, giggling to himself.
“I love you too, every single part of you,” Cas replies playfully, as he looks Dean’s beautiful, freckled body up and down, a smirk dancing around on his lips.
Dean is thrilled with the choice of game, jumping up out of the chair to follow Jack indoors to pick out his hat, horse, and guns. Dean had gone a little crazy buying cowboy-related things for Jack’s birthday.
It doesn’t take long for Dean and Jack to stand about 9 feet apart with their backs to each other, and when Cas shouts: “draw!” Jack spins around as quickly as possible, and Dean makes sure to turn slower so Jack can get to shoot first. Jack’s too young to understand that Dean is letting him win, so he squeals with delight every time his small foam bullet hits Dean.
“Okay,” Jack giggles and leaps onto the bed, jumping around and all over Cas. Miracle gets excited and jumps up on the bed to join in.
“I think that if you let us clean all the maple syrup out of your hair, we could go out and play on the shore,” Dean smiles at Jack, knowing that they would probably have to give him another bath in the evening.
Dean pushes against Cas slightly to create a little space between them so he can roll over and look at the sleeping man next to him. Cas may not be an angel anymore, but in this light, he looks angelic. Gently, Dean plants a kiss on Cas’s nose, then his cheek, then just above his eyebrow. He kisses his way around the other man’s face for a couple more minutes before Cas’s eyes start to twitch. He opens one eye, peaking at Dean, and smiles. Dean is mesmerized as the sky-blue eyes open fully, and stare into his.
“Let’s get cooking these pancakes before the batter ends up everywhere,” Dean chuckles as he grabs a frying pan out of the cupboard, melts some butter on the stove, and puts three scoops of batter in. One for each of them. While Dean fries up the pancakes, Cas and Jack prepare the toppings; there’s maple syrup, chocolate spread, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, honey from Cas’s bees, and bacon, which Dean insisted on.
“I’m not sleeping, you know.”
I’LL UPDATE WHEN WE RETURN. I HOPE TO GOD IT’LL BE GOOD NEWS, BUT I CAN’T HELP BUT THINK OTHERWISE. WHEN HAVE I LAST HAD GOOD NEWS.
“Yeah, yeah I’m alright.“ Benny chuckles quietly. “Sure was a close one though. By the looks of the bullet hole in that tree behind me, I think I’d be pushin’ up daisies right about now. So, yeah, I’m doing just fine.”
DEAN: Hey, you seen Cas anywhere? He’s not picking up his transceiver.
“Yeah, Yeah. Demon. I get it, trust issues and all, but–”
From his jacket pocket, Dean pulls out a beaten-up cassette player that hasn’t seen the light of day in years. The tape he wants is already inside so he shares the headphone set between them, its red cord tying them together inseparably like they’re fated for this. He leans his head against Cas’s shoulder and presses play, absently tapping his fingers onto the rough denim of Cas’s blue jeans, letting them dance to the beat of ‘What Is And What Should Never Be’.
DEAN: Yes, be there in 5.
Instead, they move on to the ancient kings, how they rose and fell from glory in what seemed to be the blink of an eye. To the battles of old gods and the heroes of legend, and Castiel again won’t say it, but if they didn’t know better, they would say Dean was one of them. Orpheus unsung, or Achilles reborn–although, in this life, it seems, Castiel was the one who was destined to fall.
“Dean Winchester,” The demon calls out, his voice shattering the silence of the night. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”
“We were on… 216, I think. Mission 216,” Lee mutters, breaking his silence. “I was cornered by some demon, got offered a deal. My life for information. On you.” He doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes as he speaks, but he barely sounds apologetic. Dean’s hand, still marred with the blood from Lee’s fresh wound, tightens into a fist until his knuckles are bone white. Lee continues. “It was supposed to be a one-time thing, but, man, it was too good to pass up. You notice how few fights I’ve been in lately?” He shifts his injured shoulder uncomfortably. “I mean, this is the first injury I’ve had in ages. Thanks for that, by the way.”
[ January 26, 2014. 18:42 ]
“There’s really no stopping you, is there?” Cas asks, hushed, so that maybe, just maybe, Dean won’t hear it. That he won’t have anything to agree to, but with the way Dean is looking at him, Castiel knows he’s out of luck.
The party had been a complete bust anyways so leaving it hadn’t been that bad but shit, he’d been expecting to have sex! Finally after warming Becky up for the past month he’d finally thought this was it. She was finally going to open her legs up for him. As if! The cunt had dressed to impress, her beautifully round breasts bursting out of the sleeveless shirt she’d been wearing and the short skirt was the only thing covering her full ass. He’d been so ready to tap that!
“Cas called. He needs our help.” Dean couldn’t even yell at his idiot of a brother for stumbling in to his room without knocking because his stomach dropped to the floor at the same time his mouth had opened. Sam’s eyes were widened and his eyebrows were a bit closer than normal. His shirt was buttoned up all wrong and there was a strain in his voice. He was still clutching his phone with whitened knuckles. Thousands of different scenarios ran through his head and Dean felt lightheaded and strangely numb. Sam had already disappeared from his door to get his things and on autopilot Dean dived under the bed to grab his go-bag. At the same time he wanted to know what was going on and stay out of the loop. Cas, please be okay!
“Dean!” Fingers appeared to his line of vision, cutting their eye contact as Sam snapped his fingers and huffed out impatiently. He could feel the bitch face on Sammy’s face.
“There is no cure.”
With that thought in mind Dean remembered what he’d told Cas while waiting for Sam just a few hours earlier. He didn’t mean to speak those thoughts out loud but tiredness was making him act like an idiot. Most of the times when Cas was somehow involved, Dean felt like an idiot. The Angel had a way of making him feel like the biggest baboon of the bunch. Sometimes he managed to pull his shit together and act like an actual human being but most times, not so much. Luckily most of those times were when they were alone with no one to see his blunderings and idiocy but Cas. And Cas had no frame of reference to be a judge on how much of an idiot he really was, so that at least was a relief.
“Take the next road left.” Sam was tense next to him and Dean nearly missed the road. Baby’s rear slid on the dirt road as he turned the wheel to make the turn. His hands worked the wheel to stay on the road and not drive off it. The freefall-feeling Dean got from Baby rear sliding first to right and then left would’ve normally made Dean feel excitement pumping his veins but this time it simply made bile rise to his throat. The milliseconds it took for Baby to drive forward was time Dean couldn’t get back and from what Mary had told Sam, they didn’t have time to loose.
the next message had said and Dean had groaned out loud and banged his head on the steering wheel and hoped this time he wouldn’t have to dance his clothes off to a bunch of horny and all too handsy women.
“Are you sure you’re not getting sick?” The palm trailed up to his forehead. The palm felt surprisingly calloused on his skin.
“Dean.” His ears seemed to be filled with cotton balls, Cas’s voice sounded so far away and muddled by something. Dean felt a smile tugging the corners of his mouth, he felt incredibly wiped and the stress of hiding this thing they had slowly slipped away as Dean started to believe he could get this with Cas.
This was it, the end of the best night of his life and Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about that. He threw up his hand in a wave of goodbye to the people at the doorway before getting in. He tried not to feel to sad about the night ending and not having Cas like that ever again. It was all a pretend and he didn’t want to stop the pretence.
“You know damn well, Sam!” Dean was leaning on the table on his fists and he was unable to stop his arms from trembling.
“Wait, what?” Every thought process halted. It was almost like the time Cas had kissed Meg. Dean felt the need to do something but what that was, he didn’t know.
Cas was still leading him somewhere and Dean’s eyes roamed all over his body.
₰ ₰ ₰
“What?” Sam would have looked like a confused Moose if it hadn’t been for the amusement shining in his eyes. Before either of them could say another word, Sam’s phone rang.
The shirt dropped to the floor and Cas pressed against him. His naked chest was against Cas’s naked chest. Holyshit! Dean didn’t know why he was just standing there when he could be making out with Cas again, touching his skin. He leaned in, devouring Cas’s mouth with his. Cas let out a wanton moan and shit if that didn’t go straight to Dean’s dick.
It was from Mary. “You sent it to mom and Jody?” If he wished hard enough his brother would say yes.
“Sam —” Dean’s eyes shot open to find Cas taking a step back with a phone held against his ear. He couldn’t hear what Sam said on the other end and Cas didn’t give anything away.  “Yes.” Dean felt his cheeks burning up when Castiel’s eyes raked over his body before muttering another “yes” to his brother. Castiel’s eyes shifted away from Dean and he turned slightly to his side. “That’s not…” Cas ran his fingers through his hair “I don’t think…” Sam clearly wasn’t giving Cas a choice to say anything.
“Dean?” Sammy was looking at him with concern written all over his face. Dean was biting his teeth together and his jaw was starting to ache. It was all too much. He hung up on Mary, let the phone drop to the bed and walked out of the room. He wanted to smash the door closed behind him, wanted to pound the door with his fists until it, or his fists broke. At the back of his mind he was confused as to why he was so angry. In his mind he was brought back to the time Sammy had ran off to study and he was left together with an angry John.
While he stumbled backwards, Dean noticed a long shovel, pulling it out from under the table.
“Who was flirting with you, Cas?” Keep it cool, man. This is just a normal conversation between his friend and his brother. No point in showing any other emotion than faint amusement. Yeah, right. As if he was that good of an actor. Sam was smirking at him and staring at him like he was assessing every little thing Dean said or did.
“Yeah. Last vic’s stepdad. Offered to show Cas around the town if he
“What the hell is going on with him?” Dean walked around Cas, trying not to touch him because Sam was staring at them with amusement and pointing his thumb over his shoulder at Cas.
boyfriend!?
Ramiel Hit the ground with the lance and a strong wind pushed them to the ground, dousing out the ring of fire. Sam got up on his feet first, making their first move but Ramiel pushed him back with a couple of hits with the lance. Dean advanced Ramiel and in swift move, Ramiel turned and swiped the lance at Dean. In the nick of time he managed to dodge it but the second hit landed on his leg, pushing him a few steps back.
