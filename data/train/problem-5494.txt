"Absolutely. A little apple, a little cherry, a little rhubarb. I didn't even know I liked rhubarb, but here I am," he shrugs, taking another bite of his sandwich.
"I don't even know what the world outside of this room looks like anymore," Dean shook his head, his fingers tracing invisible patterns on Cas' chest. Cas chuckled, the feeling of it vibrating against Deans cheek.
"Jack, you are her real kid," Dean said.
Castiel was leaning against the porch railing, one hand in the pocket of his leather jacket and the other pulling a cigarette out of his mouth. Dean wondered briefly if he was always this elegant or if this dance of his was practiced. Castiel stepped forward when Dean opened the door, putting the cigarette out on the porch rail and flicking it into the bushes. He blew the smoke towards Dean, smirking a bit when Dean leaned away from it.
"I love you," he whispered with his eyes closed as his body lax.
"Cas!" Castiel kept walking, ignoring Lisa as she attempted to catch up with her on wedges. Cas sped up a bit, trying to get to third period unscathed.
When Castiel pulled away, it was with a steady blow of cold air against Dean's nipple, sending a shock of pleasure through it. His skin prickled with the assault of cooling saliva and the sensitive, bitten skin. Castiel ran a hand down Dean's stomach, chasing it with his mouth, kissing along his belly, down to the crease of his thigh. His eyes trailed back up to make eye contact with Dean as he licked up the puddle of precum steadily dripping from his cock. Dean wanted to whine and squirm when he pulled away again, sitting back on his heels, but he didn't get a chance. Castiel slipped his hands under Dean's knees and tugged him down until he was on his lap. Dean's lower back hovered over the bed, and Castiel tugged the pillow from beneath Dean's head to place it under his hips, making him a little more comfortable.
"I really hope that's true, and I wish that you didn't have those things instilled in you so young. I am so grateful that you learned to accept yourself because then we wouldn't be standing here, and here is a pretty great place to be," Castiel said, gently cupping deans face.
"Where's papa?" He asked, shoulders already dropping.
Dean wanted to think it was ironic how beautifully put together the house was compared to the violent people who occupied it. The stunning, no doubt expensive artwork and crystal fixtures adorning walls that could probably spew story after story of different horrors.
"No, Lisa, that's the thing. I trust you, fully, with anything else, but not this. You can't do this."
Dean slipped Sam an extra $10 before he left to the movies with Kevin, giving him a wink and telling him to not screw it up with his little girlfriend. He ruffled Sam's hair like a big brother should, and laughed when Sam smacked his hand away.
"Char," Dean sighed, pressing himself against the wall with a shaky inhale. "No ones hurting me, I promise," he shook his head, giving her a reassuring nod when she eyed him skeptically.
"Okay," Castiel mumbled mostly to himself as he slipped his fingers out to dig around in his pants pocket. Dean picked his head up to watch as Castiel pulled a packet of lube from his jeans.
"They have my house bugged?"
"My dad was a paranoid ex CIA agent, bitch," Dean panted. Meg sneered at him as she spit blood onto his floor. "Get the fuck out of my house before
Dean wasn't going to sleep that night, that much was certain.
"So, Lisa Braeden is having a party this weekend." Dean moves his attention from his half eaten sandwich up to Charlie, who was steadily smirking at him. He looked from Charlie to Benny, then back to Charlie with a raise of his eyebrows.
"Dean." Sam cut him off but Dean wasn't done rambling.
"Cuddle me," Lisa sleepily demands, reaching back for him. He rolls over to her, wrapping an arm around her waist. She presses back against him, her bare skin rubbing against his. Before she settles, he slips the blankets between them, barricading his delicate flesh from hers. A tear stains the pillow beneath his head before he finally relaxes enough to sleep.
His shoe fell to the floor and Dean reached down, grasping the little rectangular piece of duct tape. He felt around, finding the seam of it and unwrapping it carefully.
"Fine, fine, I guess we'll get out of your hair too," Sam said, pulling Jess up from the armchair.
"Don't move," he said. The bed stopped squeaking but Anna's whimpers continued. The man slowly started to tilt his head but Dean pressed the muzzle of the gun harder to the back of his head and he paused. "I said, don't fucking move," he repeated.
"Did they make you cum or did you use them to make yourself cum?" Castiel questioned, his thumb running down along Dean's cheek to just behind his balls, applying little pressure as his tongue paused. Dean breathed out impatiently, his hips pressing back on their own accord.
"I asked what we should do for dinner. Sam and Jess wanted to check out that Italian place downtown, but I know you're a bit wiped from the event and the song writing, so I suggested we just do dinner here," she said.
. "I'm so sorry," she whispered.
There was a quiet chattering to the right, so Dean walked to the left, keeping his footsteps light and his breathing slow. The end of the hallway saw two other long hallways. Dean took the left turn, walking cautiously as he passed several closed doors.
Dean pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed Cas' number. He held the phone between his ear and his shoulder as he plucked a bag of kettle corn from the pantry. The ringing of the line drilled into his ear, over and over again until Cas' voice came through, "
Castiel pulled away and chuckled softly when Dean chased his mouth with a whine. Dean tilted his head down with an embarrassed flush, his eyes catching those scars again.
"Why are you torturing me?" Dean asked, lifting his head from the bed to direct his glare as Castiel as he walked out of the bathroom. Cas grabbed his laptop bag and keys, holding them in one hand as he leaned down to kiss Dean goodbye.
"Why don't you go pick the movie and I'll make some popcorn?" He said, smiling soft in response to Jack's frown. "Sugar or butter?" He asked.
Ash opened the door against the stopper until he saw Dean. The door closed again, the latch thumping before it opened and ash was gesturing Dean inside. The door thumped behind him and Ash locked the deadbolt and flipped the latch over. He looked a complete mess. His hair was a rats nest above his head, blond strands weaved together in an indistinguishable ball. His eyes were red and rimmed with purple bags, and he was wearing the clothes that Dean had met him in.
You're not her.
"You had a little sister named,"
"I'll be fine," Castiel rolled his eyes with his lips pursed. "Besides, Mandy is driving and it's only forty minutes. I think I'll survive."
The front of the car had crashed head on into a thick tree, forcing it to compact. Cas' legs were crushed between his seat and the dashboard. His head is leaking steadily with blood, his entire body ached and trembled in pain.
"I think I just fell in love with you," Dean said, looking dazed. Castiel chuckled, patting Dean's chest.
"Don't tease me when you have to leave right now," Dean whined. "That's just cruel," he walked away with a pout. Cas chuckled softly as he watched Dean face plant on the bed. "And you know there's no food aloud in Baby!" His voice got muffled by the sheets, but Castiel still caught it.
"Yo, Benson, you got ten more minutes," someone shouted with a few firm knocks to the door. Dean took a steadying breath as he stood and grabbed the gun from the bed. He took one last look at Anna and sighed.
"Don't
"Thank you," Dean hung up and tossed the phone across the room, lowering himself down, forehead to the floor, sobs dying on his tongue.
"Am I making you uncomfortable? I can leave you alone, I would pass on the speech if it wasn't something so important," Cas took a step back, putting more space between them. Dean tried not to let his breath hitch again.
"Why don't you and Jack come over tonight? Jack can spend some time with Amy and we can talk about Cas," Sam offered. Dean stared down at his half chopped vegetables and nodded to himself.
"Um," Castiel turned to her fellow cheerleader with pursed lips, "I don't give a shit," she said.
"Just let me kiss you for a little longer," Dean said, holding his hips close. Cas smiled, settling into Dean's arms and allowing himself to stand there, in the garage that Dean built, with their family safe and happy inside, and kiss his husband.
"Is this about your ex?" Lisa always had a way of surprising him, but this is next level. His head shoots up and some of the cloudiness washes away with the shock.
Dean got a glass of wine thirty minutes in, and it eased the tension in his throat. He kept his hand on Lisa's leg, trying to ground himself in the feel of her, trying not to squeeze too hard even though it was getting harder to anchor himself to her and all he wanted to do was squeeze harder. She gave him a look when his third glass of wine arrived, not judgemental, but definitely warning. Sam was talking about some new book Charlie loaned him, dissecting it with her, and Benny was talking to Lisa about the last speaker that was just on stage. Dean couldn't hear a word of it. He was sinking into his skin, and he was a second away from surrendering to it.
"What? I'm confused. Where is cas?"
"Cas, do you know how this makes the squad look? You're reinforcing a stereotype that we're easy," Abigail said.
"No! My name is Meg Masters," she yelled.
"I am never letting you out of this hotel room," cas said, sighing as she went boneless against the mattress. Dean chuckled, leaning up so he could dispose of the condom.
Room 304 had become
"Love you too," Dean mumbled into the blankets.
"Excuse me?" Her pretty slim face was twisted up into a grimace and Castiel tried her best to stifle a chuckle. "It's not slut shaming, it's stating facts."
"What is that supposed to mean?" He questioned.
"You look like shit," someone whispered near her ear. She looked up with a scowl.
"Dean," he breathed, his young face twisted up with too much worry. Dean tried for a small smile, lifting his other hand to pull Sam in for a hug. Sam was very careful, holding Dean only around his shoulders. Dean ran his hand over his little brothers back, closing his eyes as he breathed in the familiar smell of his sibling; warm oak, a scent that Dean always counted on when he hugged Sam. A scent Dean memorized when they were sitting in the police station waiting for Bobby after their father killed himself.
"I killed Chuck," there was no remorse for the action in his voice but there was some guilt. Maybe for leaving Dean, maybe for putting him a situation where he has to leave him. "There are a lot of people on my ass right now and I need you to be safe. Right now, that means not being near me. Don't worry, okay?"
"He gave you the ticket last Friday, it's been right here all week." Dean walked over to the door, where the admission ticket was taped.
"Cas," Dean's back arched, his eyes fixed on Castiel as he licked the cum from his chest, his fingers curled, searching. Then, Castiel gripped Dean's chin with his free hand and forced his mouth open. He raised one eyebrow, his gaze flicking down to his mouth. It took Dean a moment to realize what he was asking, then he was moaning and nodding enthusiastically. Castiel's eyes danced as he leaned down and slowly opened his mouth. Dean's release slipped from Cas' tongue onto his own, warm and slightly salty. Dean took it all with an appreciative hum. Castiel leaned in the rest of the way and pressed his lips to Dean's for the first time that night, sharing Dean's release between their tongues, swallowing down the boy's moans and little whimpers.
"No, you're right. I haven't been sleeping too much recently. We're making plans for a new album and I'm anxious to start performing again. Isolation will do that to you, I guess," he shrugged.
"Good. Go get your shoes on so we can get going." Dean jerked his head and Jack jumped out of his seat, running to follow directions.
"Thank you officer, I'm so sorry," he apologized for the both of them as he grabbed Cas' wrist and tugged him inside. Meg turned to the officer, gave him a salacious grin and a wink before sauntering inside.
"Goodbye Meg," Cas said pointedly as she reached for the packets in her hands.
The ringing of his phone snapped Dean out of his thoughts. He flinched and nearly knocked the pot off of the stove as his heart rate accelerated. With a sigh, Dean pulled his phone from his back pocket and blindly pressed the answer button.
"No. I got out of the car and he freaked out and locked the door. He wouldn't open them until he knew the appointment would be over. He didn't stop crying for the rest of the day." Dean couldn't help the lump of shame sitting in his chest as he retold the events. Sam sighed sharply through his nose.
"Hi, honey," Meg repeated, making deans jaw clenched a little harder.
"No," Dean shook his head adamantly, his knees shaking as Castiel swiped his thumb over the head of his dick. "I wasn't, I swear. I just kissed her cause I couldn't stop thinking about you. I thought I was dumb for wanting you so bad after only one night. Couldn't stop thinking about you all week, just needed something to distract me. That's all it was, I promise," Dean fumbled with his words, rambling more than was probably necessary.
i'm sorry for any emotional distress I may cause with this one, I hurt my own feelings a little bit. Don't fret, there is one more chapter left :)
Dean still went to parties, he played his game with Charlie, and if Castiel didn't text him, he'd go home alone. Charlie had questioned a few times why he left that party with Cas, and she looked skeptical every time he told her that he just helped him outside so he could throw up. She knew he didn't drink that much, but he stuck to his story.
"Now, now, now," a deep, smooth voice spoke close to his ear, a body pressing up against his back. "Surely you can't be so fucking obtuse that you don't see how uninterested he is in you," the person behind Dean said. The voice was familiar but Dean couldn't place it. The boy's eyes widened a bit when he looked over Dean's shoulder, his mouth parting.
"Thank you girls for calling me when you found him," Dean said as Cas pressed kisses along his neck.
"Yeah, I'm not really in the mood. I'm just going to do some reading," cas smiled softly. Charlie was one of the only girls that Castiel really liked. She was sweet, funny, nerdy, and she didn't try too hard. She was real, and that's all Castiel wanted in a friend.
Dean was not going to be that naïve girl in the terribly made mafia movie, so he tries to distract himself, but his act quickly crumbles when Castiel appears again and Dean is putty in his hands.
"You make good money at the garage on top of what you earn from consulting, and I earn a good amount from teaching and translating," Castiel said.
"You look so pretty like this," she said, tilting her head down. "On your knees for me, waiting for me to tell you what to do. What is your color, honey?"
"It- it was hard," there's no pun intended but she chuckles anyways, "I wanted to come so bad, but I had to be good. You kept asking me to get up to get things and every time I sat back down it shifted," he explained with a little whine.
"Dean!" He spun around, catching a very slight glimpse of the shaggy haired boy he had seen when he picked up Castiel. He was hidden mostly in the shadows, his hands making an aborted motion somewhere down the way. Deans hand instinctively slipped under his shirt, grabbing the grip of the gun.
"You're so beautiful," Cas whispered when he was three fingers deep, fucking them in and out as Deans chest heaved and his fingers clenched down into the bedsheets. Castiel's fingers fanned out over his belly when he started trying to fuck himself on Cas' fingers. Dean reached down and splayed his hand over Cas', trying to find the patience he was severely lacking.
"You're a dick, you know that?" Dean yelled after him, digging his face back into the bed. He popped his head up a second later and yelled, "I love you!"
"A forever home might have to wait a few years," he said.
scouts honor sis
to mouth off at a very dangerous, very pissed off, man? You're lucky I have other plans for you," the man took a breath, his face pulling up into something pleased again. "You are correct though, Castiel is not mine by blood, but I did raise the boy. Maybe I spoiled him too much, you don't know how hard it is to be a parent, there is such a thin line between punishment and reward. I gave Castiel too much freedom, I mean, he snuck off and claimed a dirty little whore off the street even after I gave him Anna," Chuck shook his head.
"He made me come with his tongue," cas said, rolling her eyes when Dean smiled proudly. He crawled back onto the bed, holding himself above her and kissing her neck.
"She sang you Baby Beluga, and you sang me that song sometimes when I couldn't sleep. You told me you sang it in your head when Chuck let people touch you."
"I'll be back for you, Anna, I promise," he whispered.
"Bullshit," she muttered, snatching the slip from his hand.
"No." The answer wasn't harsh, and Dean took it as it was. He nodded with acceptance, slipping his hands back around Castiel's waist, resting his head on his chest. Castiel propped his elbows on Dean's shoulders, his fingers carding through his wet hair.
Dean sighed when he put the impala into park, gently skimming his hands over the steering wheel. He was grateful that he'd finally made it, but it was a bitter victory when all of the memories came crashing back, a reality before his eyes instead of memories inside of nightmares.
love you too, you dork," Dean corrected. Cas chuckled, kissing Dean's neck again.
kid," he looked up at Cas and repeated, "I'm your kid. I have two dads and no mom, and I like it that way," he said.
"Then why'd you pick him if you knew I liked him? Why couldn't you have picked someone else?" Lisa countered.
"Yeah, buddy?" Dean set the big cutting board onto the dish rack to dry. He glanced over at his son, noticing the little furrow in his brow and the downward tilt of his chin. "Whats the matter, angel?" Dean shut the tap off and moved to stand beside Jack, gently tilting his head up with a finger under his chin.
Alright y'all, this is where we start giving our very sensistive author (aka me) some slack for the CPS stuff. I tried my best, Google doesn't exactly take scenarios, ya know? Anyways, I hope you enjoy :)
"On your knees," she demanded softly. Dean went with a little whimper, his hands settling instinctively on his thighs, his head tilted back so he was staring up at her. There was a glaze over his eyes, slightly watery and a little bleary, his head never feels clearer than in these moments. She stepped close to him, her feet between his legs, her stomach just an inch or so away from his face. He breathed heavy, anticipation crawling up his spine. She threaded her fingers in his hair, brushing gently from his forehead back through all of the strands, settling to cup the back of his head.
I feel so warm inside seeing posts about pride on social media and I just watched Hayley Kiyoko's video with Alexandra Shipp and BY GOD DO I LOVE WHEN WOMEN EXIST. Hayley is an absolute goddess and I love her.
"Ash?" Dean called, his voice wrecked.
Dean was tempted to call Castiel, but there was always a little voice in the back of his head that told him that he didn't do the calling. Castiel did the calling and Dean did the chasing. That voice grew louder and louder each day, slowly swallowing the voice that said all the nice things like 'you're the only one he wants' and 'he said it himself, you're his'. That other, nasty voice is starting to argue, 'he never said he was yours'.
"Dean," Castiel was in front of him between blinks, his hands on Dean, making him slump. "You're okay, you're going to be okay." Castiel cupped his cheek, his face twisted up with concern. All Dean could feel in that moment was relief, even as he was still bleeding out.
"These two were arrested for public intoxication and invading private property, no charges are being pressed so I was just bringing them home safely," the officer explained, looking as tired as Dean felt.
"I have one more present for you, but I wanted to give it to you in private, mostly because it's really fucking cheesy," he explained as he walked to his toolbox. He pulled out a square shaped present, wrapped in newspaper because Dean is simple like that. He handed it to cas with red cheeks and stood back with his arms crossed as Cas eyed it. He had a soft smile on his face as he unwrapped it and his cautious smile turned to soft awe as the newspaper fell.
"Why can't we go today?" Jack frowned, blinking up at Cas.
"Too damn smart for an eight year old," Dean sighed, struggling to hold back tears. Sam's were freely falling, and he wiped them away with a chuckle.
"How was school?" Bobby asked from the kitchen.
"Do I look like a teenager to you? I need a bottle of water and a granola bar before even attempting to get hard again," Dean said as Cas kissed up his chest. Cas laughed, smacking the side of Dean's thigh as he crawled up the bed. Dean wiggled up the bed and turned himself away from Castiel, wiggling his hips back against him as Cas draped the blankets over their bodies.
"You never hurt me, Dean. Ever," Cas said, eyes directed at the whirling blades of the ceiling fan. "It's not your fault that banter is our foreplay," they said. Dean huffed a laugh, tilting his head up to lean his chin on Cas' chest.
"Maybe another time," Dean wiggled his wrist but the boy just gripped tighter.
Slow beeping, someone yelling, there's crying, a lot of pain.
"I'm not trying to control you, Dean, but if you want to be mine I can't have you kissing girls like that. Now, what you do with Charlie, I think I can let that slide, but anything else will result in the termination of this..." Castiel trailed off, gesturing down at them, at the point of contact between Dean's desperate little grinds against Castiel's hand. "This new little arrangement we're indulging in. Understood?" Castiel loosened his grip on Dean's face, his fingers dragging across Dean's bottom lip before settling around his throat again.
"Castiel, Cas, please," his forearm was wet with how hard he was breathing, Castiel's tongue mapping out every inch of Dean inside, finding every single spot that made his thighs shake.
Sam said.
"It sure is," Dean smiled softly as the door was pushed open. He took a steadying breath before calling out, "Cas, we're home!" Jack ran inside, his eyes darting everywhere. Dean pushed the door closed and slid the deadbolt into place.
"Are you okay?" He asked, holding Dean's wrist in his open palm and running his thumb over the reddened skin. His calloused hands were surprisingly gentle.
A ping from his phone made him jump and gasp, his eyes going comically wide as he turned to look at his phone that he had tossed on his bed.
Lisa was waiting for him when he forced himself to leave Castiel’s apartment, sent away with a gentle kiss to the cheek. He sat in his car for twenty minutes, trying to remember how to breathe on his own. She raised an eyebrow at him when he stumbled through the door, exhausted and bleary eyed.
"I know you're not a virgin, so why are you being so shy tonight?" Castiel's breath was warm against his skin as he dipped his head towards Dean's chest
"Okay, don't move," she pulled back and reached into the box again, pulling out two leather cuffs and a set of chains. There were two small compartments on either side of the headboard that concealed loop hooks. Dean had blushed the entire time while he was inserting them and she teased him mercilessly for it.
He breaks when he shoves Sam. They were arguing over something or another, he can't even remember what. He was being combative because he could barely see in front of him with how blurry the anxiety was making his vision. Sam said something and Dean pushed him. He barely had time to register what he did before Benny was pulling him away.
"I know how to shoot, Dean. I'm only as good as my teacher you know," Sam said, giving Dean a sarcastic, pointed smile. Dean rolled his eyes, that was fair.
"Excuse me?" Dean's eyebrows furrowed, readying himself to drop the guy on his ass.
He didn't have to be at the garage for another hour, so he hopped in the shower and took his time under the hot spray of the water. It felt a little pointless because he'll spend his whole day getting covered in grease and oil, but it's really the thought that counts.
"No," he bit out, throwing the door open. "I'm sorry, baby, I'm not trying to be mean,"
"What are you doing?" Came the question with a hint of knowing bewilderment.
"I understand you've done paternity testing already?" She asks.
Dean's head fell forward, his chin at his chest as he watched Castiel's hands guide his hips up and down. His stomach clenched and his thighs shook as he came, spilling over Castiel's stomach. Castiel grunted, pulling Dean down hard, holding him down as he fucked up into him, releasing inside of him. Dean let his head fall back with a pleased hum. His absolute favorite part of their arrangement was feeling Castiel inside of him, buried deep as he filled him up. The look in his eyes was always a little bit wild and possessive. His hands always tightened on Dean's waist, always enough to bruise, and usually Dean could look down and see the purpling outline of Castiel's fingers.
"Aw, Lisa, don't be petty, it's unbecoming," Castiel smiled placatingly. "My family may be fucked up, but that has nothing to do with how much I can get. Wanna see?" Castiel raised her eyebrows in a challenge.
"Cas, maybe you should come home now," Dean said, his eyes squeezing shut.
hit on me earlier," Abigail shivered.
"Papa loves bees, but you know what he loves more?" Dean asked, pulling away from Cas so he could pick Jack up from the chair acting as a step stool.
"Anna is fine. She's being treated on the floor below, they're detoxing her and she's speaking with one of the agents. And the blonde, that's Luke, he's going to be fine. Thankfully." Dean sighed, relaxing back into the bed.
By the time he was standing in his own room again, it was nearing 4am and Dean was staring at the gun. Laying innocently enough in his bedside drawer. He closes his eyes, his hands trembling in his lap, the image of Castiel on that table burned in his mind.
With a deep inhale, he straightened out his suit jacket and started tucking his button up back into his slacks. His hips stuttered when he realized he was half hard, his eyes shutting as he stilled. He finished tucking his shirt back in, he ran his fingers through his hair, and stamped out his cigarette before walking back inside.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Dean said, moving towards the stairs. The air was pulled from his lungs as Castiel gripped his waist and pressed his back to the wall. His knee wedged itself between Dean's thighs, pressing up against Dean's sensitive cock. Dean gasped, instinctively reaching up and gripping Castiel's shoulders. The boy looked down at Dean with a blank expression, no smirk or cocky smile. He leaned close to Dean's ear, his fingers wonderfully tight against Dean's hips.
"You have such a beautiful body, Dean. I've never been too interested in the idea of sexuality, you know? I see someone pretty, someone with nice pink lips, or strong, thick thighs," he gripped Dean's thigh almost appreciatively, squeezing just hard enough for Dean to inhale sharply. "Someone who I just know will taste good, and I go for them. I had a feeling about you, Winchester," two fingers hook in the waistband of his briefs and pulled, the fabric moving slowly over his ass, down his thighs, those strong hands guiding each knee up so they could pull his briefs completely off. Dean's back arched under the touch of Castiel's fingers, pressing into the small of his back, thumb pushing down on his spine until he was presenting for him.
"Thank you," Castiel returned her smile and guided Dean over to the chairs. Dean sat stiffly, gently shushing Jack when he cried. His foot tapped incessantly on the floor, his knee shaking up and down with it. Cas gently slid his hand onto his knee and he slowed down the movement but didn't stop. He laid his cheek on Jack's head, slowly rocking him.
." Dean's jaw clenched a little harder before he could catch himself and Meg smirked at the reaction she pulled.
worry about it. Worry about the bullet lodge in my fucking hip, Michael," Castiel said, voice hard, his teeth coated with blood.
"But papa smiled at that lady." Jack struggled to convey his confusion. "Does he love her more than us? He took her to see fish and he smiles on the outside for her." Deans heart constricted so tightly he thought he might stop breathing. He cupped Jack's cheeks and gently forced eye contact with the boy.
Castiel rolled her eyes, graciously not reminding the old woman that her husband died five years ago.
"Oh, I was hoping you'd say that." The smirk on her lips was downright malicious as she pulled out a cell phone. She flipped the safety on and off as she unlocked the phone. Dean's heart shattered when she came to stand beside him, the muzzle of the gun pressed to his lower back, her phone before his face.
"You got it good for someone who once told me 'commitment just isn't my thing, Charles'," she quotes him in a dramatically low voice, "'Its like pie, why would you settle on one flavor of pie for the rest of your life when you can have apple one night and Cherry the next'," she continued, pursing her lips in some form of an impression of him. He shakes his head as he bites into his sandwich.
The trip downstairs was grueling. Dean's stomach was swirling and his hands were shaking and he couldn't stop nervously running his fingers through his hair.  He stopped in front of the door and took three deep breaths then shook out his hands before slowly opening the door, all to loose his breath all over again.
Dean was
"Yes, doctor McLeod said they have a lab here," Dean exhales shakily, Jack fussing in his arms.
"Don't you dare muffle those pretty sounds," Castiel warned, holding Dean up with one hand in his hair and the other splayed out on his stomach. "When I'm done, I want everyone on this floor to know what a good little slut you are for me. I want them to know how good I fucked
"What happened to the blonde that Meg shot?" Dean asked. "And Anna, is Anna okay?" He could feel Bobby and Sam's confused stares.
"Who's slut are you?" Castiel asked, tilting his head up, eyebrows furrowing.
"Maybe that's because I didn't want to push him so I let him stay where he was comfortable. What was I supposed to do? Take him out to get shit faced and then break into a school? Should I have done that before or after tucking Jack into bed? Or maybe bailing after finally agreeing to watch a movie after two years of missing movie night? Should I have quit my job? Been here 24/7 to watch him stare at the wall for hours on end, or not eat a single thing for two days, or flinch at the sound of her name. You've been here a week, Meg, I've been doing this for two years!"
"I don't have a condom," he said hesitantly. Cas propped herself up on her elbows with a glare.
"No, I, uh, I don't feel like going out tonight," he said, fiddling with his fingers.
"Can't even feel it," he waved it off, his breath coming to him in shaky passes. Castiel slipped out slowly, his tongue lapping at the blood on his shoulder. He lowered Dean down to the bed, ignoring the boys grumble about the mess.
"Ash has it," he whispered. He felt Meg tense beside him, fingers stilling against his abdomen, and he ran with this tiny window of her being off balance. He shifted to the left, drawing around and weaving his left arm under her arm to grab the back of her shoulder, slamming the elbow of his other arm into her face. He held her arm tightly against his chest, the gun pointed at the floor, and slammed his knee into her stomach. He grabbed the gun, tilted it sideways and pulled it out of her hand, slamming the barrel into her face. He took a few steps away to put some distance between them as he pulled the slide back and aimed the gun at her. She cursed as she struggled as find her footing again, her cheek busted open with a cut, her nose steadily leaking blood.
Dean stands in the doorway for a moment, holding bags of groceries and feeling like his stomach might be coming up through his throat. It takes everything in him to turn away from Cas and Megs second round of hysterical laughter and walk to the kitchen instead. He drops the groceries on the counter and pauses as his eyes settle on the kitchen table. Castiel's robe is draped over the back of one chair, and Dean gives up on trying to hide his discontent. His face and his shoulders fall, lips parting on a shaky sigh. Dean's been trying for over two years to get Castiel out of that damn robe, but Meg manages it just a few days? Dean walks over and yanks the material from the chair, stuffing it deep into a laundry basket in the linen closet, no longer able to stand looking at it.
Fuck.
"Miranda, you-"
Dean pulled away for another drink, but only a few drops fell onto his tongue.
"You doin' okay? You looked pretty far gone when you came out," she asked, holding her cigarette as she always has, her wrist bent with her palm up, the cigarette a slight flick away from falling from her middle and pointer fingers, elbow resting at her hip.
"Yeah, I," Dean nodded. "I'll be like five minutes," he said.
"Maybe. I mean, if it was one of Chuck's buddies that shot Cas, that makes more sense than a deal gone wrong. No one is as good as Cas," Ash said.
There is a thrill that shoots up Dean's spine when he brings it up to his nose and breathes it in. The guilt in his stomach is no match for the shock of pleasure that courses through him at that smell. His head feels cloudy and clear at the same time, he can't decide which one. The bed is soft beneath his legs when he climbs on, laying down on his stomach. Her voice is in his head again, much clearer after hearing it so recently. The gum lays on the bed right beside his nose, his temple pressed to the sheets as he rolls his hips down into the mattress. He recalls the feeling of her hands on him, gently encouraging his hips into a steady rhythm; a purposeful grind instead of a mindless hump.
Kayla had smirked their way and they avoided her gaze at all costs. The judge allowed Jack to testify and the boy did so with a calm, even voice. He read from a piece of paper that he spent three weeks perfecting.
Dean took the car that Bobby had just finished refurbishing to sell. He felt distantly guilty for it but ultimately his priorities were above borrowing his uncle's car. His gun got tucked in the waistband of his jeans and Megs was hidden under the driver's seat when he parked in the back lot of the hotel. He went in through the employee entrance and took the stairs to the third floor.
"Why not?" The frustration in her tone is making his teeth grind, "Just say what you're not saying, Dean!" She throws her hands up.
"I don't have a problem with you, Lisa," cas said, holding onto her patience like a vice.
Dean was led out of the house and down the street. His phone was buzzing in his pocket, but he didn't dare reach for it as Castiel opened the door of a Lincoln continental, gesturing Dean into the passenger seat. He got in without a fuss, taking a moment to breathe as Castiel rounded the car to get in the driver's seat.
"You're saying, compared to every other person you've hook up with, they were all single flavors and Cas is multi-flavored?" She asked, furrowing her eyebrows.
"Say it," Castiel whispered, his hips pausing entirely. Dean cried out softly, his chest heaving. "Say it, Dean, tell me how my little slut wants me to fuck him harder," Cas said, his hand sliding up to Dean's neck, fingers settling lightly around his throat. Dean took a shaky breath, his teary eyes fixed on Castiel's hard, unrelenting gaze.
' The clenching of his jaw and the almost blank look accompanied by dark, determined eyes, always during something fast and always right before the degradation,
The agent was patient with him, coming back an hour later when Dean was numb with pain meds.
"I just want to end whatever this is between us because I don't want there to be any tension in the team," Lisa said, propping her hand on her hip.
"When I was nine years old, I asked my dad, Castiel, why I didn't have a mother like some of my other friends had. He explained to me that when I was a baby, my mother was not ready to have a baby, so she gave me to my dad, Dean. He told me that it wasn't my fault that I didn't have a mother, and it wasn't her fault either, it was just the way life worked out sometimes. When my mother, Kayla, came back, a part of me was excited, because if like happened the way it does for a reason, then maybe I would be lucky enough to have two dads plus a mom. I never thought that I would be sitting here, fighting to stay with my parents. That is what they are. Dean and cas are my dads, that's what they have always been. Kayla has never been my mom, and she hasn't acted like one up to this point. She speaks poorly of my dads, even though I've told her that it makes me upset, she makes homophobic remarks, she took me to a mans house that she claimed was her boyfriend and I sat in a stuffy living room for two hours while she spent time in the bedroom with him," Castiel had to squeeze Dean's hand hand so he wouldn't be tempted to jump out of his seat. Deans jaw nearly popped with how hard he pressed his teeth together.
Meg shoved him into a room with double wide doors and Dean's stomach fell.
"We could just do it in the car? I don't mind," Dean said, looking at the backseat with pink cheeks.
"Don't. Tongue stays outside," she said, voice breathy.
seeping past his lips. His eyebrows furrowed and his mouth opened on a wet sob, his knuckles turning white with how hard he was gripping the sheets.
"Oh yeah? Care to show me?" Cas' coy act dropped into something more sensual, and Dean was immediately jumping on board.
"Castiel! I know you hear me." Cas huffed, widening her steps. She cursed under her breath when Lisa gripped her elbow and forced her to stop.
"The world is conspiring against me today, I swear," she said with a sigh.
"Jee, Sam, how nice of you," he said through gritted teeth. Sam smiled innocently, then pretended like someone called him. Dean rolled his eyes and looked back to Jack as he opened another Christmas present. He couldn't lie, the sixteen year old was surprisingly good at the drums, Dean likes to take credit for it because of all the classic rock he played when Jack was a kid.
He smiled down at his handwriting as he tucked his boyfriend into bed and crawled in beside him.
He raised the gun and sent a shot to the guy's knee. He walked forward, gripping the guy's wrist so his gun wasn't pointed at him, and slammed his gun down on his temple. He slumped over, his gun falling into Dean's free hand. Dean flicked the safety on and stuffed it into his waistband as he ran quietly down the hall, searching for a phone or an exit. The moment he rounded the corner, a shot was fired at him. He jerked back, the bullet blowing through the wall.
"Yeah, just like that, good boy," she hung her head, strands of hair falling in front of her face. Dean whined, partially at the praise and partially out of frustration for not being able to touch her.
"I sincerely hope you two wait a few more years to have kids, I'm surprised Sam has kept Bones alive this long," Benny said.
He gulps down breaths of air, Peach and the phantom hint of firewood. He circles his hips, clenching his hands down into the sheets to keep them above his head. His thighs spread a bit further and he loses the rhythm a bit, the friction so, so good.
"Tilt your head back for me, honey." Dean guided his head back with a finger under his chin. He dipped his cup beneath the running faucet, and drenched the dark curls with lukewarm water, rinsing all of the suds out. When the water ran clear, he shut the faucet off and stood up. "All done." He pulled him up slowly, guiding him out of the tub with strong hands so he didn't slip on the wet tiles. Dean wrapped him up in a fluffy white towel and walked him to the bedroom. He rubbed lotion into his pruned up tan skin, guiding him into his underwear and a pair of black slacks.
He stared up at the house, completely innocent looking from the outside.
He took another deep breath as he stepped out of his bedroom.
"Well you're not the lightest person to catch," she said with sarcastic smile.
is Meg, but there she still knew that her name is really Hannah Lund." Dean stared down at the photo, his eyes widening as he stared at the terrified brown eyes that would turn out to be so malicious. "Taken from outside of her elementary school in California. Shipped off to New York where Chuck Novak got his hands on her, took a liking towards her and a certain blue eyed boy named Jimmy Shirley," Ash handed him another photograph and all of the air in Dean's lungs fled in a rush.
"God, Castiel sure picked a feisty one." Dean grunted, kicking his legs out again, managing to hit someone's face, laughing behind his gag. "Fuck, you little prick. Bind his fucking legs." He continued laughing as the van jostled and someone wrapped duck tape around his feet.
"Oo, I always love seeing you behind that thing, looking all manly and whatnot," she stood up from the couch and kissed his forehead. "I'll prep the sides like a little housewife, how domestic of us," she laughed. He forced a laugh of his own but his eyes fell shut tiredly. He didn't get up for a few more seconds, just listening to Lisa greeting Jess on the phone as she started pulling things out for a salad. He only knew because she was asking Jess which dressing she should use.
"Nothing, sorry," Miranda chuckled, her hands flexing on the wheel, shoulders relaxing. "Just a little pinch. This pregnancy has been a breeze compared to Amy. I don't even have morning sickness like I did with Amy," she said. Then her face dropped and her fingers tightened on the steering wheel. Cas leaned forward in his seat, analyzing her face.
"Yes, I'm coming. I'm just a few minutes from the fountain," Dean said. He heard an impatient sigh on the other end of the phone.
"Courtesy really flys out the window during sex, huh?" Dean asked after they caught their breaths, staring down at the sheets, covered in cum and lube. Cas chuckled, guiding Dean off of the mattress, steadying him when he wobbled on shaky legs. He slipped on his boxers before grabbing a new sheet from the closet. Dean limped to grabbed a new pair of boxers from his dresser drawer. He turned back to Cas with a glare, temporarily broken by a wince as he pulled his boxers on.
"Oh he is," Alfie winked.
"Enough!" Dean yelled. Cas flinched, sniffling as they were cut off. Dean breath hard in their space for a second, his thumb gently swiping away stray tears, cautious of the bruising skin around their eye. "You don't have to change shit for anyone," Dean whispered, his hands settling on either side of Castiel's face. "You are absolutely perfect the way you are." Dean was a little shocked at how close they were when the adrenaline of Castiel's outburst wore off. He swallowed as he glanced down at Castiel's lips, watching their tongue swipe out to wet them.
my teacher wants to talk to mom...
"You know what I mean, I forget what it was," he defended.
I kinda failed my history exam
enjoy!
"If I'm limping tomorrow, I swear I will strangle you," Dean grumbled as Cas peeled the sheets off.
That night, Dean came with three fingers buried in his ass and Castiel's voice guiding his every move through the phone.
"You can't be mad at me while I'm injured, plus I technically didn't lie. Cas isn't a bad guy, he was just raised by one," he argued, swallowing around a dry throat. Sam jumped up and handed him a bottle of water. Dean smiled, gently patting Sam's shoulder as he accepted the bottle. He took a few slow sips before handing it back. Then he looked to Cas and squeezed his hand.
Just as a little curtesy, I'll list the tags pertaining to this chapter just so nothing jumps out at you haha.
"I need a drink," he grumbled, shoving her into the house first. Charlie's laughter was muffled by the music pouring from the speakers set up around the living room. She gripped Dean's wrist as they moved through the mass of bodies populating Lisa's living room and kitchen. Bobby's rules were always swimming around Dean's head, and they were good rules. He watched the guy pouring drinks carefully as he poured two for him and Charlie. Then he placed his hand over his cup as he watched the guy pour them shots. Dean clinked glasses with Charlie, took a cursory bite into his lemon slice, downed the shot, then sunk his teeth into the lemon, chasing away the sting with the acid.
"I think that's manageable," cas chuckled, leaning down to press his lips to Dean’s.
"Sorry, I messed up the counting," Lisa shrugged.
"Yo Winchester!" One of them thwacks Dean's shoulder. "Tell Keith we're totally going to crush Creek this week"
"Yeah. She was like thirteen at the time," Benny shook his head.
"Winchester, get on the bus!" Cas smiled as Dean rolled his eyes at the football coach.
"Fine, it's for weed, I'm low on cash, I'll pay you back," Gabe rolled his eyes.
"I'm sorry, baby, you want me to kiss it better?" Cas asked as he tackled Dean down onto the bed.
When she was gone, the itch in his skin got so bad he was physically scratching at his arms. He couldn't leave the house without having a panic attack, he spent the entire next tour cooped up in his hotel room, trying to replicate the reassuring weight of her body with anything he could find. Most nights, Benny had to lay with him until he fell asleep otherwise he'd stay up all night scratching and crying. It was two weeks into his tour when he slept with someone else. He drank until he forgot why he was so sad, and when he woke up the world crashed down a little harder. He locked himself in the bathroom and sat in the shower for hours until the girl was gone and the hotel staff let Benny and Charlie into his room. After that, it felt impossible to call her.
"Jack saved you a bowl of kettle corn. He knows it's your favorite," he said, though he couldn't bring himself to look back. He started up the stairs, trying his hardest not to let his tears fall.
"We just wanted to play on some swings, it wasn't like the gate was locked!" Meg giggled.
"Fuck." Cas struggled to maneuver when his legs were trapped, his knees and thighs ached when he shifted his hips up to dig into his back pocket. He pulled his phone out and unlocked it with trembling fingers. He stared at the screen for a second, lips trembling as he tried to call someone. Anyone.
They called John Winchester abusive. They called him paranoid and unfit. They called him crazy. Right now, he's the only reason Dean is going to survive.
"Damn, I should have gone with you before the next speaker," Charlie said, her nose scrunching.
"No, you let me fall," Castiel accused.
"Hi baby, I lost you somewhere between the dorms, and me and Meg did
So, Dean pulled himself out of the bed, shoved his pants on, gathered the rest of his clothes, and walked across the hall to the bathroom. He bent himself over the sink, pressed three fingers into his hole, and stroked himself until he came into his hand with a shudder. It was the most shameful orgasm of his life, and he could almost see Charlie's sympathetic smile as he was pulling his pants back up.
He glanced to Jack as Sam was talking about the theme of Amy's party. He watched his son laugh and play with his cousin and a few other children there. He watched his son be a kid for an hour until they had to go home and that kid would remember that half of his support system was a cold, distant shadow of a man, shackled to his bed by his own volition.
"Okay, that's quite enough!" Castiel smirked against Dean's lips, pulling away without looking up at whatever school staff member had interrupted them. She leaned in and licked the spit from Dean's bottom lip, kissing it softly once more.
"Perfect." She threw her right leg over Dean and dropped down into his lap, her skirt splaying out around her thick, tan thighs. Dean's cheeks were warm under her hands as she tilted his head to the side and pressed their lips together. He tasted slightly of the sandwich he'd been eating when she approached, but the taste was soon overcome by the cherry flavor on her tongue.
" the girl responded, loud enough for Dean to hear over the phone.
"No, no, I'm just," he blinked hard a few times, trying to clear the fog of shock and anxiety from his brain. "You're not..." he paused, swallowing on a dry throat. She waited patiently as he took a slow drag of his cigarette before finding his voice again. "You're not making me uncomfortable," he said.
"Can I ask where you got these?" He asked, running his fingers over a scar at Castiel's left hipbone, about an inch long.
"Yeah," Castiel started pulling his hips back, withdrawing his fingers and ignoring the whine Dean made. "You needed someone who could treat you like the good little slut you are," he thrust back in hard, his cock slamming back inside, his fingers plunging down inside of Dean's mouth, making him gag.
"So, do you
"I'm having too much anxiety and I can't control it, I can't stop it!" He can't breathe.
– correction: the
"Does my boy want to play tonight?" It's a useless question because they both know the answer. She's just teasing him.
The end
"Fuck, Dean, I," Castiel was cut off by a knock on the door, and a devilish smirk appeared on his lips as he pulled away, his hand slipping out of Dean's pants, making the boys head swirl with needy desire. "Undress completely and lay on your back on the bed," he said, shooing Dean further into the room.
"I'd take you to my place but it's crowded, is your place empty?" Castiel asked patiently as he pulled away with a screech from Lisa's house.
Dean sighed, glancing around at the papers, strewn in senseless chaos. His heart thumped erratically in his ribcage, his fingers twitching by his sides, seeking some sort of action that would release the energy piling up in him.
"Fuck me, please," Dean whispered, tilting his chin down, looking up at Castiel with teary eyes and flushed cheeks.
"Hopeful," he corrected before leaning back up. Dean heard the distinct rustling of Castiel taking off his clothes, then the ripping of the packet. Castiel poured some of the lube on Dean's hole, spreading some on his cock, the slick sound reaching Dean's ears. Then Castiel was pressing in, faster than he did last time. Dean forced himself to keep breathing, his hand clenching around the pillows. Castiel bottomed out with a low groan that bordered on a growl, his hands gripping Dean's hips hard. Dean didn't have much time to catch his breath or adjust fully to the feeling before Castiel was pulling out and slamming back in, creating a vicious pace, fast and hard, forcing Dean's hips back with every thrust.
"The last time we went on the road, I started doing bad shit, I was playing my best onstage because I was doing my worst offstage. I'm afraid that I'll fall back into it once we start up again," the confession rolls off of his tongue easily as soon as he makes eye contact again.
"I wonder what would happen to that brain of yours if I were to put apple pie filling on my body," cas said thoughtfully. "Sit in the impala, a dollop of apple pie filling on my chest," he whispered.
"It's the doorbell," he said. Dean whined as Castiel stood up, Dean falling to the bed. Cas grabbed a pair of sweatpants from the laundry basket and slipped them on before shuffling out of the room. Dean followed him with his eyes and laid back with a groan as soon as he was out of sight. He pulled the blankets over his head, waiting for Cas to come back. It was probably just a package, Dean was waiting for a car part and Castiel was always ordering books or supplies for the kids in his class. Dean just hopes it has nothing to do with glitter this time.
"Screw that, sounds like he's just not secure enough in his masculinity. My baby is so cute, he lets me do whatever I want to him. He lets me do his makeup, I put those cute little butterfly clips in his hair, I even painted his nails. Half of them rainbow cause I'm gay and half of them pink, purple, and blue cause he's Bi," Cas said.
"Because I got to him before I got to you," Castiel said, his face going cold. Dean only nodded, content with that bit of information.
"What happens between then and now?" Castiel asks.
"Maybe loose the glasses?" They shove them off and they landed on the floor with a clatter. "Maybe I should just drop the 'they/them' bullshit, it is pretty demanding and unfair of me to expect people to call me anything other than what I was assigned at birth. I was raised being called he/him, so why should it bother me?"
Dean saw a sleek pair of black dress shoes first. Followed by pressed black slacks, a perfect crease at every seam, a tailored black jacket slung open around a crisp white button up. Clean stubble, sharp features, slick hair. Chuck Shirley grinned as he stepped off of the last step, his hands linked in front of him. Michael followed behind him with a chair. He set the chair a few feet in front of Dean and Chuck sat down on it, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees.
Seeing her absolutely ruins him.
"I don't know, maybe one of our friends is trying and
"It's alright, buddy, I'm just going to change you," Dean said as he carefully unclasped his onesie and moved it up. His diaper was practically falling apart, one of the tabs were unstuck and hanging open. "I bet this was really uncomfortable to sit in, huh?" Deans face twisted down as he removed the overfilled diaper, sucking in a breath at the rash that had built up. Jack started wailing as soon as Dean started wiping him down. "I know, buddy, I'm so sorry. I have to clean it or it's going to get worse," he winced as Jack thrashed. He didn't see any rash cream, so he finished wiping the baby down and put a fresh diaper on him, then carefully maneuvered the onesie off. It was soaked through, so Dean tossed it in the empty trash bag with the diaper. Jack was still crying as Dean put another one of the onesies on him. as soon as he clasped it, he scooped the boy up and held him to his chest, standing up to gently bounce him.
put a bullet in
"I'm fine," Cas looked up at Lisa with a scowl, gently cupping her wrist.
“Nope,” Dean shrugged, keeping his eyes glued to the grill.
"Dean, of course I want you. I've always wanted you, I just needed you to be as involved as I was. But, honey, it's you that has someone, not me," she said with a little, sympathetic, tilt of her head.
Dean blinked hard at his notebook, scribbling the last of the notes on the whiteboard as the bell rang. He packed up all of his stuff in a blur of emotionless overthought, then walked out of the class with his elbow hooked around Charlie's. She walked with him to his car, kissed his cheek then left him to get a ride home with Lena.
"We know buddy, but it'll be good for you to have a relationship with your mom," Cas said, catching Dean's eye roll and giving him a pointed look while Jack wasn't looking.
"Stop," the voice was unfamiliar and rough. Dean opened his eyes and they widened as he watched the shaggy haired boy press a gun to the back of Meg's head. There was a blonde beside him, the same blonde at the place where Cas was shot.
"Cas, please, he-"
"Okay, well I'll see you at dinner tonight then," she said with a wave as she met her girlfriend at the door. Cas waved back to her as she walked out of the hotel ballroom they had been using for practice. The mats were all clear by then and Coach Harvell was going over the flaws of their routine with Rowena, the other coach.
"Anna? Anna, where is cas? Is cas here?" Dean asked, his teeth grinding as Anna's eyes slipped shut. "Anna," he called, pressing his fingers on her neck. Her pulse was still steady but she was lolling out of consciousness.
"I wouldn't dare think that," Dean said, pulling his boxers back on. "Get dressed and I'll buy you dinner," he said, tugging his pants on before climbing over her, pressing a kiss to her lips. "Then I'm going to ask you to go steady with me." Castiel rolled her eyes, shoving him away. Dean laughed, pulling her up with him so they could get dressed.
"Did he just-"
"No," Dean cut him off, throwing his own door open and running around to Castiel's side. "You're in pain, I get it," he said as he carefully helped him stand. He guided Cas' arm around his shoulders and kicked the door closed. He helped Castiel up to the porch, taking extreme care to soften the steps as Castiel winced with every one. Castiel knocked hard and loud, and they only waited about two breaths before the door swung open.
"Woah. Haven't seen this in forever," cas takes the key for room 413 and flips it gently in his hand.
"Yeah, that's what everyone else is saying too," he took another drag, trying desperately not to look her in the eyes again, in fear that he won't be able to look away.
"God, did you hear Taylor going on and on about her new boyfriend?"
"Yes, we will all watch a movie later." Castiel returned his smile and Dean just about fell to his knees.
"Your sweet little novio pack your lunch today, amigo?" Garth asked, his entire uniform covered in grease and oil. Dean isn't quite sure how he manages to do that every day, his own uniform is spotted but not nearly as filthy as Garth's. Charlie's uniform is nearly spotless, but Charlie can do practically anything under a car without getting her hands dirty. Dean isn't sure how she does it.
"Are you sure? You haven't seen Amy in quite awhile," he said. Some of the cold darkness returned to Castiel's eyes, his face flickering, like he was stuck between his Meg induced happiness and his old haunted darkness.
"Turn," Castiel smacked his thigh, impatiently helping Dean onto his stomach. He gripped Dean's hips and pulled him roughly up onto his knees. Dean whined throatily, spreading his knees as he hugged one of the pillows against his chest, resting his head on it. Dean watched this time as Castiel dipped his finger into the pie filling, then he felt the sticky wetness on his rim, Cas' finger prodding gently inside. Dean moaned high pitched and loud when Castiel licked it away, dipping his tongue in, chasing the taste. He nipped at Dean's cheeks as he pressed two wet fingers to his hole, slipping them in slowly, giving Dean ample time to adjust to them before adding a third.
"No driving, I know my limit and I won't pass it, don't take drinks from anyone without watching them pour it, an exact location if I leave this house, and," he paused, rolling his eyes, "use protection cause you're not going to he a grandfather and you're not buying me antibiotics if I get a disease," he listed.
"Alright, my little honeybee, go get washed up for dinner." Castiel took Jack out of Dean's arms and set him on his feet, nudging him towards the door. Jack obliged happily, his little feet clapping on the hardwood.
Nearing the end of the hall, Dean heard a set of footsteps coming his way. He backed up carefully and tried one of the doors. The first one was locked, but the second was open, so he slipped inside and closed it softly. He assessed his surroundings quickly, his heart stuttering in his chest when he turned around.
"Few times," he shrugged as he pressed the button for the third floor.
"Daddy, where's papa?" Jack asked from somewhere down the hall. Dean squinted in the darkness, taking a second to flip on the hallway light.
. "He took me to a hotel that night we left Lisa's together, and we just... kept meeting up there. Everything feels so much better with him, Charlie, and I'm not just talking about the sex, which is fucking incredible by the way," she grimaced at him and he promptly ignored it. "I mean, I have never been happier than when I'm in that hotel room with him, he makes it feel like the rest of the world doesn't even exist, and I know how cheesy that sounds, trust me. I feel like I sound like I have stockholm syndrome or something, but I fucking love being with him."
His arm was tugged back at an awkward angle, his wrists bound behind him. Blood seeped down from the throbbing cut on his forehead, stinging in eyes, which were forced closed by a hard tightening of cotton over his eyes.
"Mm, I have to go," Castiel mumbled between the insistent, sweet kisses that Dean was constantly pressing to his lips. Dean tightened his grip around Castiel's neck, wiggling his legs out from underneath him to wrap them around the mans waist. Castiel huffed an amused laugh through his nose because Dean's tongue was occupying his mouth. Cas relented for a few more seconds, biting his lower lip to hear him moan, swiping his tongue over where his teeth just were.
It's his fault. His fault for falling in love with Castiel. Nevertheless, he'd do it again if he could.
"Slow down, baby," Castiel gripped his hips with both hands, leaving his neck cold, guiding him into a slow, filthy grind that had Dean's head thumping back against the wall. Castiel swiveled his own hips, sliding his thigh up and down between Dean's legs. "There you go, good boy. So good for me." Dean whimpered, wishing he had taken the time to take his pants off beforehand, it wasn't enough with all of the layers between them. He whined, digging his hips down harder, gripping Castiel's waist to try and pull him in closer. Castiel chuckled against his cheek, Dean could feel his smirk on his skin.
Dean blinked hard against the darkness, moaning softly over his gag as he tested his restraints. The entire room was pitch black, the ground cold and hard, most likely cement.
"Fuck, Ash, you need to give me something!" Dean took a steadying breath, looking towards the door of his bedroom.
"You're the one who wanted it harder," Cas teased.
"He's is slightly underweight but not by much, and that rash needs careful tending to, but other than that, he is not where typically three month olds are at," Deans heart sank. "Typically at this point, 3 month old babies can bare a little weight on their legs, they can lift their head a little while on their tummy, they can sit with some support, but Jack isn't doing any of that so to me that means he wasn't getting very much stimulation wherever he was. He probably spent most of his time laying down without anyone engaging with him to get him moving," the doctor explained. "Now, I know you two are going through enough already, but I will be having to call CPS to help you figure out the paternity stuff. Thankfully, we have a lab here in the hospital that does paternity tests, you can get it done today but the lab results won't be ready for 3 to 5 days," she explained.
"No," Jack pulled his face away from Cas' stomach and looked back at Dean. "I'm
"I could go with you? I know you don't like driving at night, hell, you're anxious driving in the day," Dean chuckled.
"Cas, just because we banter and bitch at each other doesn't mean I'm going to leave you crying in the stairwell with a black eye. We won't go into the stereotype stuff because I feel like that's not really about me, but we gotta get you to the nurse or something," Dean reached down for Cas, but they drew back.
"Yeah, I run a shelter for teens, specifically for lgbtq+ teens who need a safe space. We have on campus counselors who work pro bono," she explained. He remembers her talking about that. It's been a few years but that passion is still in her voice. "I'm speaking later so I guess I'm glad I ran into you now. I'm sorry if I blindsided you, I know it's been awhile since we've seen each other," she said.
A small usb drive and a mangled piece of paper. Dean looked back towards the house, staring at the drawn living room curtains, where he knows Castiel is laying on a table getting a bullet dug out of his hip. Above the living room were two windows, both dark, the curtain slightly ajar. On the other side of the house were two more windows, both dark and shut. Dean leaned his elbow on the center console and discreetly stretched his arm to the passenger seat, grabbing the drive and the paper. He kept his head pointed at the house as he looked down at his lap, opening the paper carefully so it ripe.
Which he didn't.
"Bye girls!" Cas yelled over his shoulder.
"Hands above your head for me," Castiel said as he set the plate on the bed beside them, his hands settling on Dean's stomach, fingers teasing lightly at his abdomen. Dean stretched his arms above his head, clenching his fingers around the pillows. His stomach muscles contracted as Castiel walked his fingers up his belly to his chest, then slowly dragged back down.
"Dean?" His attention was pulled back, his breath stuttering.
"Don't drink before you get Gabe," she said before leaning up and shutting the door. Her mother flipped her off through the windshield and Castiel returned the gesture with both hands.
"Cas," Miranda whimpered, voice weak but
"No, you know me, I'd just feel weird and awkward afterwards. No offense Benny, I'm sure you're great in bed,"
"Have you been here before?" Dean asked as Castiel led him confidently to the elevators.
"Okay, then just come drink with us. Come on, you've been distant all week, do I have to say that I missed you?" Charlie raised her eyebrows threateningly. "Because I will. Dean Winchester," she said his name like a proclamation, puffing her chest up and opening her mouth.
"No." Deans tone didn't allow for any argument. "I'm not abandoning him in some loony bin, I'd loose him for good."
Dean was ready to punch the guy, when he felt a pair of hands at his waist, making him gasp. A hand found his elbow and it slid down his arm until it got to the point where his skin was reddening under the boy's hold.
"I love you too," he whispered in a sickening parallel that made his knees weak. He gripped Jack's hand a little tighter than necessary, and walked him out of the front door. Jack let him buckle him into his booster seat, even though he knew how. Dean took a moment to fix Jack's shoes, teasing the boy gently as he corrected him.
"Jack!" He attempted to match his enthusiasm but failed as he stood up straight, his back popping.
"I am. You got the drive?" He asked. Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out the black usb drive. He dropped it into Ash's hand and followed him to the desk by the window. It was covered in different documents and photographs. Dean caught a few startling images, young girls and boys faces, before Ash covered them up. Dean steeled himself again, clenching his jaw hard. Ash went to plug the drive in, but paused as he looked up at Dean. "Sorry kid, I was told not to let you see this," he drummed his hands on the desk momentarily then stood. He searched around the desk for a scrap of paper and a pen and scribbled a few numbers onto it, handing it to Dean.
"Ash, do you think he's dead?" Dean asked, voice soft.
"Did he?" Dean turned his face into Castiel's neck, pressing a soft kiss just under his ear, tasting sugar and salt.
"Don't pretend like you care!" The outburst makes Dean flinch. "Don't pretend like you give a shit about me."
"Be careful," Dean said with a strict raise of his eyebrows.
"You're the best, Bobby!" Sam shouted as he ran back up the porch.
"Fuck you, you sadistic prick." Dean spat in Chucks face, making the man laugh.
"Hands above your head," she raised an eyebrow at him, her knee stilling. A whimper crawled out of his throat, deep and desperate as he reached up and grabbed the bars of the headboard. "Can you keep them there or do you need the cuffs?" She asked, her knee starting a steady rhythm against his bulge. Dean licked his lips, his breath a little heavy. He gripped the bars tighter, trying to feel out where his head was at. He was too fuzzy, he couldn't figure it out. "It's okay if you need the cuffs, honey, I don't want to have to punish you because you couldn't help but let go," she soothed a hand through his hair, her voice close to his ear. His eyes clenched shut as her tongue flicked against his ear lobe, her teeth following it.
"Did it feel good?" She asked as she sat back on her heels and started unbuttoning his jeans. Dean swallowed, watching her with heavy lidded eyes, trying not to wiggle his hips as she teased his zipper down at an excruciatingly slow pace.
"I can tell you're trying not to react to me right now, and I have to say that's a little disappointing," a pair of hands slide around his hips, slipping just under his tee shirt, fingers grazing against his stomach. His skin felt a hundred times more sensitive, his muscles tensing the second he felt the tips of Castiel's fingers. Dean has to force himself to focus when Castiel starts speaking again.
"Nope, everything else was perfect," she said, laying her head back down. "Don't let that go to your head," she added, reaching down to card her fingers through her hair. He laughed softly against her thigh, pressing one more kiss there before going back down. She gripped his hair, rolling her hips once up against his mouth, then again when he moaned against her. She pulled his hand up from her stomach and guided him under shirt. He took the hint quickly, sliding his palm up her rib cage until he reached her breast, cupping his hand around it with her nipple between his middle and pointer fingers. She sighed, resting her hand on his head as he licked against her again, switching between broad strokes and kisses over her folds and focused swipes to her clit.
"They were very nice," Dean agreed, rubbing a hand along Cas' back.
Her fingers bite at his chest as she rides him, her head thrown back in bliss. Then she's looking down at him with something wild and heated in her eyes.
"Breathe for me, baby," he said. Dean released all of the trapped air in his lungs, allowing his hips to relax. "Good," cas whispered, hand still resting on Dean's belly, thumb rubbing back and forth with reassurance as he pressed in deeper. Dean gasped, his hands scrambling at the sheets as Castiel slipped completely inside, making himself at home inside of every one of Dean's cells. Castiel leaned over him, his hips stilling. He pressed one hand into the mattress beside Dean's head and used his free hand to press two fingers to Dean's mouth. Dean opened his mouth on instinct, his eyes rolling back when Castiel's fingers settled on his tongue. He brought one hand up to the man's wrist, holding him in place lest he dared try to pull away.
There he goes again. Lisa interrupted the zen he had created with Lena and Charlie, now all he can think about is the differences between Lisa's touch and Castiel's. There were a lot of differences, too many for Dean to think about right now. He wondered what Castiel's mouth tasted like. Lisa's, beyond the vodka tasted weirdly of grass, not a terrible taste, just earthy. All Dean had tasted on Castiel's tongue was himself. Salty and a little sweet. Dean shivered at the thought, and he could feel Lisa smirk against his mouth like the reaction was for her.
"Clean up your mess," Castiel said, tapping his hip as he leaned over the chair to grab the pack of cigarettes from his Jean pockets. Dean rose slowly, sliding back down onto the pillow at Castiel's feet. He heard the flick of the lighter as he leaned down and licked his own release off of Castiel's stomach. Cas slid the hand not holding his cigarette into Dean's hair, pushing sweat slick strands away from his forehead. The smell of cigarette smoke slowly filled the room with each inhale and exhale. All of Dean's senses were filled with the smell of sex and cigarette smoke, and he sunk down into it with a sated, delirious smile.
"I already have a headache," Dean grumbled.
"Meg told me I wasn't good for him," he said. He could see Sam's face twitching even as his eyes were fixed on his beer.
"Cas," she said firmly. Cas took a slow, deep breath, before following her direction. He pulled up his voice memos, hit record, and held the phone up near Miranda's mouth.
"What?" He asked even though he already knew the answer. The answer was always the same nowadays.
"Shut up, Meg," Gabriel said with a roll of his eyes. "You fucking talk too much, you know that?"
"Good practice?" Cas raised her eyes from her phone and settled her grumpy expression on Dean.
His name was printed messily on the front of the note, his heart sank as he opened it.
"Don't drink that entire bottle before dinner," Dean teases with a more relaxed smile.
"Cas, Cas please," Dean whined.
"Sorry Ellen," Castiel smiled innocently as she handed the woman her cheer bag and her duffle bag. She stepped up onto the bus and took an empty seat near the back, smiling at some of the other girls. Lisa was sitting next to Jo and she scowled at Castiel when she passed. Cas ignored her for now, sliding onto the cold seat. Her athletic shorts did nothing to protect her legs from the cold seat, but her sweatshirt was big enough for her to slide it down to her knees. She pulled her phone out of her hoodie pocket and unwrapped her headphones from around it.
"Touch my dick, please. I need to cum, please, please," Dean cried, pressing his hips back against Castiel's mouth. Castiel hummed, the vibration causing Dean's thighs to tremble.
"That's not a nice thing to say to your girlfriend," Cas said with a pout. Dean chuckled sitting beside cas and wrapping an arm around her shoulders. She leaned into his chest and curled her legs over his lap
"Four," he says, rubbing his hands over his face. "I'm sorry, Lisa, I saw her at the event and now, I, I can't stop," he's one octave away from whining.
"Dean!" Sam's voice was louder this time. Dean shut his eyes, a pair of heavy tears falling.
"Of course. Let's get these papers out of the way so you can go home."
"Well you weren't dating then and Kelsey saw Meg Masters leaving your room so there's rumors that you had a threesome," Abigail lowered her voice like she was saying beetlejuice.
"Not today, Winchester, I'm not in the mood," Castiel grumbled, taking another hit, the end of the joint blazing red.
"Of course. Come on," he spread his legs and laid his jacket down on the grass, guiding her down onto it, smoothing her skirt down as she got comfortable. She pillowed her head on his thigh, his other leg pressed to her back. He draped her jacket over her shoulders and brushed his fingers through her hair. "My friend Benny went off campus for lunch, I'll have him pick you up a coffee."
"My brother is getting Anna, I'm getting you out of here." Castiel guided Dean's arm over his shoulder, sliding his other arm under Dean's knees, carefully picking him up.
Dean remembers one specific time when he sent Castiel a picture of him in a pair of panties that Charlie had left at his house. It took 2 hours of heavy deliberation and a lot of staring at them before he actually tried them on. They were a bright blue, nearly identical to the color of Castiel's eyes, which had ultimately been the selling point. They were made of soft lace and fit surprisingly well, sitting snug on his hips and cupping his ass.
"Tonight was really fun, thanks for having us, Castiel," Jess said with a slight yawn.
The air was nippy and it licked at his skin as soon as he pushed out of the employee entrance. He could see his breath every time he exhaled, little clouds of white seeping past his chapped lips. Dean ducked his head as he started for Bobby's car, the keys jingling in his pocket.
"Holy shit," Cas whispered, blinking up at Dean.
above him smacks his ass. It's less of a smack than it is a pat, an unsure, soft pat that has Dean rolling his eyes. The boy takes the eye roll as a sign of pleasure instead of annoyed frustration, smirking like he has something to be proud of. It was hard enough to find guys that would top Dean, the star basketball player that he is, everyone expects him to be the dominant one in bed, so when he got guys interested in topping, they turned out like this.
For the first time in two years, when Dean looks into his husbands eyes, they aren't half dead. They aren't looking through him. He struggled to keep eye contact, so he didn't try. He focused on gathering his and Jack's empty bowls and taking them to the sink to soak.
"Fuck," his eyes fell open slightly as she rose up with the curse. He watched in blissful heaviness as she slipped the condom off of him. She unhooked the chains from the bedpost and unlatched the cuffs from his wrists, gently kissing the pulse point on each one.
"No fucking way! Show me right now!"
"He in the closet?" Bobby asked.
"Chucks dead," Castiel said.
"Screwing up is apart of the deal. A little trauma never hurt nobody," Dean laughs wetly. "Kidding, but seriously, parents make mistakes, it's apart of the process. For what it's worth," Cas leaned his chin on Dean's shoulder, his forehead at his temple. "You're doing a great job and I think you're an amazing father." Dean closed his eyes and dropped his chin to his chest.
"No, I have to get some writing done today or Benny will kill me, you have fun though," he smiled back at her.
"No service," he admitted.
been doing that Meg obviously was. Meg got Cas out of the house more times in the past week than Dean had in the past year, and if that isn't a kick to the fucking chest, Dean isn't sure what is.
A door creaked open but it was distant. There was a pattering of footsteps, muffled, above Dean's head. He was in a basement of some sort, that much was obvious. The shuffle of footsteps above his head moved to the left, and another door opened. Dean squinted when a light flickered on. He struggled to get to his knees as a pair of footsteps descending a set of stairs, concrete sounding.
"Fine. I swear though, if you think this was a one time thing you're insane," Cas said as she sat up.
Dean tested his restraints, laughing almost disbelievingly. The handcuffs were tight but they had a little bit of slack. His ankles were duck taped and the gag in his mouth was still in place, the one over his eyes gone.
individual tags: violence; guns; kidnapping; mentions of drug crimes; mentions of kidnappings
"Dean!" The shout made him flinch. He looked up from his phone, everything slightly blurry before he focused in on who said his name. Lisa was staring at him, chuckling softly at his disorientation.
"Hey," the loud voice of an intoxicated female bounced through the speaker, "we found this kid scooping coins from the fountain and we saw the writing on his arm. Are you Dean Winchester?" She asked. Dean's eyebrows furrowed and he dropped his pizza so he could concentrate.
"Yeah, I don't want to go through that again," he whispered.
"Good. Now about the name..."
The bathroom was sparsely in use when he walked in. He ducked into the first stall he saw open and took a second to just breathe. He couldn't unclench his jaw, but his body felt a little more secure. He was still floating somewhere outside of it, but it wasn't as bad in this smaller space where he could press his back against the stall door and dig his feet into the ground.
"The gate was unlocked!" Cas defended, making Meg giggle a little louder. Dean turned to go back to bed and leave Cas and Meg at the door, but as soon as he turned, he saw Jack staring at them from the bottom on the stairs. Dean really hopes he didn't see the officer but by the look on his face, he's not betting on it.
"Meaning three minutes not on time. Take a seat," he waved the slip at her.
"Yes it is. Your name is Hannah Lund. Chuck
"Another one bites the dust?" Dean gasped when he opened the bathroom door. Castiel was leaning against the wall opposite of the bathroom door, his solo cup gone. Dean's skin instantly started tingling, raising with goosebumps. Castiel was wearing a tight pair of black jeans, a white tee shirt, and a black and yellow flannel. It was simple but he made it look so fucking good.
Dean kept his hands on her hips, and that just wouldn't do if Castiel was making a point. She put her hands over his, sliding then down her hips, onto her thighs, then back. She guided his hands under her skirt and squeezed his fingers until he was gripping her ass. She smirked into their kiss, tangling her fingers in his hair and tugging his head back as she pushed her tongue into his mouth. Dean fought weakly for dominance, but he was really no match for Castiel's determined, bold actions.
"I can't be with Lisa regardless of whether you take me back or not," he sighed, tilting his head down a bit. "she needs something that I can't give her and I need something she can't give me. It's too hard."
"Thanks," he muttered before lighting his own cigarette. Castiel smiled at him without responding verbally. The color of her lipstick stuck to the cigarette as she pulled it out of her mouth, her chest rising as she inhaled, then sinking as she pushed the smoke out.
"Come on me, miss," he whispered, driving his hips up again. "Come on me, please. I want it so bad," she cursed as she came, squeezing his sensitive cock, her thighs shaking.
He doesn't expect to see that same blonde girl at the front desk, and it comes as a shock when he does. She smiled at him big and bright, as if no time has passed, as she tossed him the key.
"Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out," he repeated after each exhale. "Focus, Dean." He looked to the passenger seat to see if there was blood on the chair, pausing. There was blood on the seat, not more than a few drops, but there was also something trying to hide in the crease of the chair and the backrest.
which teacher?
"I hope so, I just, there's no way for me to find out," he shrugged.
"You know, some people are just too impatient for this part," Castiel said as his fingers danced over the back of Dean's thighs, featherlight from the dip behind his knees up to the seam of his boxers. "Too impatient for these soft touches, for the build up." Dean breathed out shakily, the muscles in his thighs clenching a little as Castiel's fingertips brushed over his balls, not cupping or rubbing, just ghosting over like the promise of a touch.
"Be careful!" Dean said over his shoulder as he started upstairs again. He walked into his room, dropping his backpack at the door. The door clicked shut as Dean's feet froze in front of the door. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up as Meg smiled at him from his desk chair.
Castiel was right, as he always is. Before Jack turns seven months, they sign a lease for a two bedroom apartment. Dean has an anxiety attack on their first night because he's afraid they won't wake up if Jack cries. It took Cas an hour to talk him into bed, and twenty minutes to make him stop trying to get out. Dean wakes up at 6am and he startles, flying out of bed to make sure Jack didn't hurt himself through the night. When he busts into his room, Jack is still soundly sleeping and Castiel shakes his head with a fond smile.
"Watch it, Meg. Jealousy doesn't suit you," Castiel raised an eyebrow at her as Michael removed the towel from his hip. Dean stepped back with a grimace as Castiel's wound leaked steadily with blood, about an inch in diameter, flesh split open. Meg sneered at Castiel, shoving a bottle of tequila at him. He steadily chugged it as Michael prepped a pair of long tweezers.
"I filled your tank when I took your car to the store yesterday so what is the fucking money for?" she asked.
"What?" He stuttered, his tongue heavy in his mouth, his hips buzzing with the ghost of Castiel's touch.
"Why didn't you tell me?" She asked, the accusatory tone gone from her voice. It was just empty softness now.
"I'm sorry," he said, voice raspy.
"You sure you're not up for sight seeing?" Charlie asked as she slipped her bag over her shoulder.
"I love you too!" Castiel yelled back before the apartment door shut. Dean smiled to himself as crawled up the bed and buried his face in Castiel's pillow.
"Well let's hope for the first one, yeah?" She patted his leg sympathetically.
"Look daddy, papas happy." There is so much amazement in Jack's eyes when he points this out to Dean. It feels like a stab to the fucking gut that Castiel is laughing at a tv show Dean has never even heard of before. His husband is crying because he's laughing so hard, smacking Meg because he can't speak, gasping between silent, wheezing laughter.
When the judge awarded them full custody, they cried. They cried right there in the middle of the court room until their attorney guided them out. Sam and his wife, Eileen, and kaylas mother, Judy, met them outside of the courtroom and they took turns hugging Jack.
"Fuck Abigail, the only one reinforcing stereotypes here is you. You're pretty, blonde, a cheerleader, and refuse to associate with anyone below you on the high school food chain. Abigail, your mother works at the gas station and her boyfriend is an unlicensed masseuse. Humble yourself," cas slammed her locker and turned on her heels, pen-less and irritated.
"No, I," she threw her hand out to stop elevator when it started to close. She softened her cold expression and tried to remember how to tilt her voice to not sound like she's angry. "Sorry. I'm just tired and my social interaction limit is peaking. I was just going to take a shower and lay down," she licked her lips, looking over Dean's shoulder at the emptying lobby. "You can join me if you want."
"Good boy, keep those eyes closed for me," Castiel whispered as he shuffled down a bit more on Dean's legs. Dean gasped when Castiel dragged a finger along his dick, from base to tip, dipping into the slit before drawing away. There was a soft smack and Dean rolled his eyes back behind his eyelids because it sounded a lot like Castiel had sucked his finger clean.
"What are you saying? You want a divorce?" Sam asked, eyebrows drawn up high.
"Hi there, how can I help you?" A blonde, wide smiling, nurse greets them when they walk in, and Dean holds Jack tightly as Castiel explains their situation. Her smile falters as she flicks her eyes over to Dean, a sympathetic smile on her face.
"Yes," It took all of his concentration to whisper that one word, then his brain started turning to mush as Castiel started pushing in. Dean didn't get a good look at it, but three fingers did nothing to prepare him for the mind blowing sensation of being split open on Cas. He held his breath when Cas pushed in a bit more, his hips unintentionally tensing. Castiel's hand landed softly on his stomach, fingers spreading out.
Bobby drops him off at Lisa Braeden's house with a firm hand on his shoulder, the rules clearly laid out on the table. Bobby knows that Dean knows them, but he repeats them anyways, mostly for Sam's comfort where they boy is watching from the backseat.
"Oh sure, the nurse will patch me right up and I'll be sent on my merry way where another intolerant asshole will beat the shit out of me because I have the audacity to be comfortable in my own fucking skin," Castiels entire body was shaking as they took another hit.
"Okay, next on the list, find forever home," Dean widened his eyes dramatically. Cas huffed a laugh, rolling his eyes.
"If you're referring to Lisa, she is not my girlfriend and she never was. We went on like one date last month," Dean said as he followed Cas to the elevators.
"Dean!" He flinched hard, looking back to Castiel, who was clenching his teeth hard, his jaw flexing with it. "Drive," he said, softer. Dean shakily put the car into drive and started forward. "You'll see a stop sign soon, turn left," Castiel instructed. They drove for about fifteen minutes before Castiel directed Dean down a long dirt path. At the end of it was a cabin, two stories and probably beautiful in the daylight.
"They take a different shape with every emotion. Only one goes up when you're annoyed or generally unimpressed, furrow down when you're angry, they go straight when you're upset, and they furrow up when you think someone's being stupid. It's adorable really," Dean said. "So what's going on and how can I help?" He squeezed her a bit, holding her tight to his chest.
"Shh, it's okay, we're all done," Dean comforter, gently rubbing Jacks back.
Meg Masters had started singing in 2013 and she skyrocketed to fame in the early months of 2015. Dean had met her around 2014 and they got together occasionally to write music together. He had his hands all over her second album and, likewise, she wrote half of his third. Dean genuinely liked her personality, so it wasn’t a shock to him that he was invited to  a charity event she was hosting. Everyone was dressed in their best, floor length evening gowns and pressed suits. Dean fiddled with the button on his jacket as they were directed to their table.
"Did you have a good night, sweetheart?" She asked, smoothing his hair back.
"Yes, so you've told me every morning of the last two days," Castiel said nonchalantly, even though his cheeks went pink. Dean followed him into the bathroom, wrapping his arms around the mans waist as he started brushing his teeth.
"And I'll probably say it again tomorrow morning, and Friday morning as well, because you deserve to hear it," he kissed Castiel's shoulder and along his back, sliding the collar of his shirt down so he could get his lips on his neck. "I wish I had a teacher like you when I was young and stupid. It took me until I was twenty and in college to realize that being straight isn't "normal" and being anything other than that was okay. I can't imagine how many young boys with shitty, intolerant fathers, are rethinking what's been drilled into them because they have someone like you showing them that it's okay to be who they are," Dean said. Cas stared at him in the mirror, for so long that Dean had to hide his face in his neck because he couldn't handle it. Cas spit the toothpaste from his mouth and set his toothbrush down so he could turn to Dean.
"Do you think you're smart?" Chuck squinted at him, his mouth twisting a bit. "Do you think it's
"I brought you some lube too, and you bet your cute little ass that I'm coming back later for the details," Meg said
"A slut," he whispered.
There were times when Dean got that itch under his skin, that need to not be the one in control, where would think about this moment. The moment he was under the weight of her gaze again. After the first few months, when the panic attacks and the excessive crying calmed down, after he could breathe normal again, he thought the effect had worn off. Like a detox from a drug he didn't know he was taking. He thought the temptation would disappear. Obviously that is not the case, because here he is, sighing into the warm evening air, already feeling utterly intoxicated in her presence.
"Probably struggling to get Amy and Jack to bed, those two are peas in a pod," Miranda chuckled.
"I think this pie metaphor has run its course, my friends," Garth said with a wry smile.
"Fuck, can I," Dean cut himself off with a shaky moan, his eyes fluttering, barely able to keep them open as every single one of his senses was filled completely with Castiel.
"Okay, we reviewed the note, the birth certificate, and all records on file for Kayla Warren, we stay in close contact with the sheriffs station, so they're trying to track her down as we speak. For now, while we wait for the results, which is really all we can do, since your name is on the birth certificate and the mother claims you as the father, you will be able to take Jack home. You'll have to sign a lot of papers before you leave, and someone will go by your apartment tomorrow just to do a wellness check, but other than that, all we can do is wait," Miss Talbot explains. Dean sighs out heavily, pressing his nose gently against Jack's head.
"I have an extra shirt in my bag, you dork," Cas kissed him again, slapped his ass, then made his way out of the room.
"Spank me." It throws him off, it makes his head reel. She's still bouncing on him, her nails painful on his skin as she repeats herself. Dean closes his eyes as his stomach drops. He swats her ass once and she gasps, a wide, pleased smile taking over her lips. "Harder." He does. He spanks her a handful of times before she's screaming and losing rhythm. She scrambles and her legs shake and she gasps before slumping forward.
"How many of them made you cum?" He asked, thumb sliding over Dean's hole, still wet with lube. Dean wanted to press his hips back, draw Castiel's finger into him, but he didn't want to seem too desperate for it.
He knows nothing about what Castiel did when he was in pain. If he gritted his teeth to conceal his emotions or if they were clearly laid out with furrowed brows and a twisted mouth.
"Maybe," Cas sent him a wink before slipped back into the bus and slid the window back up. She caught Lisa watching her, shaking her head when the other girl ducked her head to pretend like she wasn't just staring. Cas rolled her eyes as she sat back in her seat, smiling disbelievingly as the cup of coffee in her hands. She put her headphones in and turned her volume up as she sipped her coffee.
"Yes. We'd like to speak to you about where you'll be placed. As part of witsec you'll need new identities. The sooner we get you out of here, the better," the agent said. Dean forced his eyes open to catch her.
"Hey." Sam pulled Dean into the house and took the lead to the kitchen. He grabbed two beers from the fridge and slid one to Dean.

"What about Chuck?" Dean asked, head too heavy to keep up, it hung heavy over the crook Castiel's arm.
"Don't lie to me, Gabriel. What is it for?" Castiel pushed her wallet back into her pocket, waiting for an honest answer.
"Aren't you guys going to Florida this weekend?" Charlie asked, drawing Dean's attention away from all of the strangers surrounding them. The question was directed at Sam, who was sipping casually from a glass of champagne. Dean's not sure where he got it or when.
"Mhm," Dean nodded, his eyes fixed on Castiel's face, something distant and cloudy in his gaze. He wanted to protest when Castiel stood and turned for the door. The cloudiness rolling readily through his head disappeared when he caught a glimpse at Castiel's back. Most of his back was covered with intricately designed angel wings, each feather prominent, taking up their own space. They started at his shoulder blades, traveling up to his shoulders, down his sides, and narrowing at his lower back. When Castiel disappeared from the room, Dean laid on his back, trying to remember every inch of that tattoo.
"I'm free Friday night past 10, if I get a text with a time and location, I'm all yours." Dean's body sagged against the wall when the warmth of Castiel's body left him.
"I sent picture to my caseworker, Mrs. Talbot," Jack smiled proudly as Bela passed around the evidence. Kaylas eyes had widened and her attorney had objected. Cas stared wide eyed as their attorney assured Kaylas that the new evidence was submitted well before court started. Dean smiled proudly at Jack, and the boy beamed.
"Baking!" Jack excitedly grinned, flour dotting his cheeks and completely coating his hands all the way up to his elbows.
"Tell me about it. Last week she listed off all 50 states," Sam chuckled.
"Who shot him?" Dean asked.
"It's your day," cas gestured down at his outfit with a smile, that really did make Dean roll his eyes. "So, I'm treating you to dinner. Wherever you want to go, my treat."
"He has a pretty bad rash," Dean said, hesitating to step away as Jack starting wailing and flailing his arms. The doctor gave him a gentle smile as she untapped the diaper and pulled it off.
"Fuck yeah, you like that?" Dean hums noncommittally and the boy sends a few more pats to his ass. He wished he would have gotten on his hands and knees so he could look as bored as he felt, but he kept biting his lip and making small moans as any polite person would do. The boy is making sharp thrusts that have his skinny pelvis smacking awkwardly into Dean's ass, the rhythm choppy and unsatisfying.
