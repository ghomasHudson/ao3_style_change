‘Janine came here today.’ she says in a sluggish voice.
At 10:15pm, he knows he needs to get to his bedroom as soon as possible. He leans on his side against the wall of the corridor waiting for Sherlock to appear at the doorway of his bedroom, now dressed in pyjamas, carrying the used towel back to the loo. John smiles at him when he does. 'I'm going upstairs now. Good night.'
'I'm not implying anything.' she answers impassively. 'But John, it's completely normal that you haven't evolved emotional attachment to your daughter yet. It's ok to take decisions based on obligation right now. I'm sure that given time you'll get around this feelings.'
‘I—‘ he recalls their only try at sex, where she guided his hands all the time and lifted her shirt only for access to her breasts. He thinks how she used large clothes when Sherlock came to dinner, how she remained seated and quiet when Mycroft visited, how sometimes she moved too quickly when she wasn’t thinking about it, like the when they arrived at the tarmac that day. How every time they were too close she would be sideways to avoid touch. She never spoke of the baby moving, and she left the job at the clinic even if it wasn’t necessary. ‘Holy shit.’
'Oh Sherlock! Are you okay?' she has a broken glass vase on her right hand, and the left grips Anna's gun the way it's supposed to. A hysterical giggle threatens to come up his throat.
A car stops and he gets in immediately. By his mental calculations, forty minutes on a bus from the suburbs to Paddington, he must have been close already. Then he paused. Orange?
'Oh look at you! Much better than vomiting in a plastic bag, isn't it?' she says while John bites his tongue.
Time to plot your future.
He had considered his old friends only for a moment before remembering Sherlock’s video for his birthday, so he crossed all of them out.
'I'm not deserting the family, I'm deserting you!' he yells at her. ‘I will still be with my daughter!’
John.' she replies softer this time, which makes him blink, confused. 'I'm grateful. But Sherlock needs to know it's time to pull back now. Let us live our lives and go pursue his own. He can be like any other friend, commenting our posts on facebook and visit from time to time, but

'Why should I tell you? It's not like you care. You left me on my own for months.'
Sherlock just minimally shakes his head, and shifts some inches closer. John removes the space between them, maneuvering into the folded area and biting the curve of his neck right when it becomes his shoulder. Sherlock's arms encircle him tightly, making a noise from the back of his throat. John unlocks his teeth and kisses gently the spot. He drifts to the earlobe just above it, murmurs into his ear 'Tell me.', and bites it.
He walks to a nearby park where he knows there are some parked taxis. He turns a corner and almost steps on a tabby cat, that hisses at him.
'Yes?'
'It... could be possible, if she has a bank account. Are you suspecting foul play?'
They resume eating for a few moments. 'Talking about love...' Anna starts again, and John refrains from closing his eyes in pain. 'What about you, Sherlock?'
He looks at the receptionist holding his arm. 'You get off me, lad, or I sure hope you have medical leave in your contract.' the man steps away. He turns to the assistant. 'You're very much aware I don't, but he'll listen to me anyway… What is your name today? Barbara? Caroline?'
'Sherlock was at the delegacy, harassing some sergeants into letting him help with something. They dismissed him, of course. He was so young then! I don't know what got into me, but I was already an old woman who didn't live a proper life to have anyone else to resort. I managed to contact him, and I told him everything I knew. He presented all the evidence to the solicitor without so much a mention to my name. So many crimes! He went to the death row and for the first time in years I felt relieved.'
'Mary.' he stops combing his hair to regard the ceiling for a moment, praying for patience. 'Stop being dramatic, there's nothing awful in it. Sometimes I can't concentrate.' he sits on the foot of the bed to tie his shoes.
He hangs up before John can say anything, which is for best because he doesn't know what to say. The initial £550 for the annulment application would be a brutal cut to his budget. He learned to quit his pride in these matters long ago when he asked Sherlock for money right at the beginning of their friendship.
'Making space for you, in case you want to hide behind the books. Oh, in that bag over there, get some objects to put over the mantelpiece so you can push them to the floor. I read that cats love doing that.'
'I know, I was just checking. Safety and all.' she goes inside. He supposes she does have good intentions but weak execution, as anyone could pass for him if she just asked a name. He notices Rosie's bag and folded carriage are already propped up against the foyer wall, so he picks them up.
"No puns intended" Mary thought, after he explained.
John sighs and puts his breakfast aside and folds his hands on the table. 'Look, it's time to get back to reality. Anna is gone, and you don't need to coddle me anymore.'
For example, John was never much bothered by the lurking presence of David Payne, ex-boyfriend of one Mary née Morstan. Could be read as confidence in his own relationship. The man was, after all, invited to their wedding. Sherlock made sure to keep David at a respectable distance from the bride, but the groom seemingly hadn't noticed his efforts, nor had paid a fleet of attention to his previous romantic rival.
'What?'
The face is soft all over. 'And I heard you. I'm not going to die,
'I don't keep checking, and besides, Sherlock is not the only person I communicate on my phone!'
At night when she finally gives up being awake, Sherlock puts her in her cot upstairs, and joins him in the living room, where John is finishing cleaning the child detritus. Sherlock leans against him, kissing his temple. They will probably fight over watching a documentary or an action movie, end up choosing none and playing a card game and also fight over how Sherlock never follows the rules, then take turns in the shower and go to bed together.
John is stunned, looking around. 'I suppose I feel… pampered?'
The youngest of the twin brothers had a child on hold until the very last seconds before the boss called off. That actually showed why he was still the boss, he knew perfectly well that the older twin would have fired for anticipation.
There's a pause after the dry response. 'Are you sure?'
He can handle this later, however. What he worries most right now is Sherlock. He had hidden well from him, and John just 	took as suitable how they barely talk about their feelings. It is a difficult task for both of them. But he hates that Sherlock saw and understood and learned about John so quickly: his depression when they first met, his PTSD which affects him the whole time they know each other, his disappointment at his outburst at Baskerville, his grief when he resurrected, his absolute boredom when he came back from honeymoon, his general unhappiness towards his marriage.
. I just want to understand!'
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary empathised with him. James Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes made their lives quite difficult. But John was in the obsession circle, so he had a blind spot on that aspect. But she could change that.
'So, homeless.'
John is finally making some arrangements when a shocking fact is revealed.
'Something happened? Why you didn't answer me?' he asks looking concerned. John blinks.
, and they both collaborate when the crime requires it, but Sherlock still keeps a biggest part of the workload purely by path dependence.
'You see Sherlock,' she straightens on the chair. 'Having a love life doesn't always mean having a boyfriend.' John perks up to the fact that she doesn't add "or a girlfriend". 'Because sometimes it just doesn't work! You could love a person and they could be unattainable. It would be a sad love story, but still.'
'Ah. I feel sick.'
him, I didn't remember that.'
'Oh, Sherlock Holmes.' John purrs. 'Come here, would you?'
The last post isn't even his - Sherlock uploaded it during his honeymoon. Mary had joked about it, making fun of Sherlock, while taking jabs at him for getting distracted from her. He had been thinking about Sherlock's face during his wedding, and at the same time avoiding thinking what it
-- * --
Rosie is still moody, but more responsive. He reads a book he collected from her bag, although read is a strong word for the activity that consisted of her banging the pages while he added more pertinent information than the feebles one the book provided. He supposes the texture of baby animals, or so the book called, appeal more to her than scientific facts.
He can't go back home to change and leave again without raising suspicions, and he doesn't have anything on him to get a cab or public transport. His contacts agenda still has an entry called "Minor", which stands for Minor position in the british government. He swallows his pride and presses
Usually they go make a mess of Sherlock's bed quite early, so John can make any kind of excuse to slip out. Today they arrive mid-evening from a case where Sherlock had to disguise as a clown. A
'By the way… how are things with Mary?' she asks conscientiously. He sighs.
, you know, pay attention to someone, I can’t help but think he considers them special. That if he talks to them properly they’ll find him special too. And-‘ he stops.
'Who?'
They push the bed covers with their feet, laying side by side, breathing into each other's air. John holds onto Sherlock's left thigh, thumb lightly brushing over the scar Todd Fuller put there with a fillet knife.
Today actually he only scheduled one client first thing in the morning, so he can take Rosie for her MenB jab at the clinic John works. John had told him about his ongoing reputation there, and while it would sound prudent to avoid appearing with his daughter, further cementing a bunch of fool's perceptions, they also don't know anything at all about their lives, they don't owe them explanations, and John never even liked them that much. Actually, If he chickens out of bringing Rosie there, it will convey the impression of guilt, to which he has no reason to.
They stay like that for some minutes until out of nowhere Sherlock jumps, almost knocking his head on John’s chin, which would have been painful, he thinks relieved.
'You don't know that!' he retorts scandalized. 'It was pure luck and timing! And we wouldn't be here if it weren't for him!'
. He had tried to ensure that would happen before the plane got midway to his destination.
If that hadn't happened, probably secondary effects to the second and third degree burns he had suffered on 75% of his body would have done the trick. Even for less important burn degrees, having that much of the body affected is a bad sign altogether.
Then Sherlock just takes his phone from his hand and presses the "end call" button before giving it back.
-- * --
'Oh, that's a shame. But it's your fault too, isn't it? You can't always wait for the other person to keep in contact' she said staring straight into his eyes. He appeared uncomfortable again, frowning slightly.
Moriarty was insane and Mary was too old for this.
'I don't thi-'
'This is for real, Sherlock. The two of us against the rest of the world. I choose you, only you.'
'John, my shoulder will dislocate.'
That came to mind as vague memory when Moriarty summoned her to a "very special meeting" as he put. She was disconcerted to enter a lounge room with, well, other people. True that any protocol was ever given but maybe that was the CIA experience speaking.
They had blinked at her, who had more puree all over her face than in her mouth and looked very content about it. 'Did she say…?' John had started asking, but Sherlock was already running to the baby's development book, writing down "Watson".
The spray drops to the floor as John immobilises the politician on the floor, knee planted at the small of his back, pulling his wrist back at a breaking point position. The man's face is pressed to the floor with John's other hand. '
He escapes the next day. He stops by a supermarket and buys a cake that gives him diabetes only by looking, a packet of fancy biscuits and some birthday hats. In the way to Baker Street he meets Molly, who's bringing a mistrustful bag, so he doesn't ask. Greg is already at the door holding a small box. Mrs. Hudson opens the door for them.
'What? Who?'
There are some fresh bottles of milk stored. She must have pumped before leaving. The phone screen lights up to a "choose your language" option, like it's a new phone. She also formatted it so information couldn't be retrieved, apparently. Great. He closes the fridge, also puts the phone in his pocket, and when he turns around, a man enters the kitchen.
Considering he emptied his inbox in the first two days in Brighton, work wasn't looking favourably to him. He has some plans to occupy him time for some weeks, but for that he needs money. So when the thirty-something lawyer Keona Douglas came by Baker Street with a real case, he accepted immediately.
When he comes back to the flat, laundry done, it is to find the place looking like… a cat palace or something. There is a huge cat tree combo of bed-scratcher-tunnel positioned beside the window in such a way that if he is laying on the top bed he can watch the street. A few toys are scattered around, John can see even a plush mouse hidden between the cushions of the sofa, an empty cardboard box under their desk and a godforsaken electric water fountain sits at a corner of the kitchen.
Mary doesn't show up at them once the whole morning. He gets ready, reheats the leftover mashed potatoes with meat from yesterday, and puts the cold sandwich and salad he had prepared last night in a brown bag. Just as he is leaving the kitchen, Mary appears in the doorway. 'She woke up. She didn't seem happy in the cot so I put her on the carpet.'
'What about Sherlock?'
He counts from 1 to 10. 'Nothing. Nevermind.' he murmurs to himself, pockets his phone sitting on the nightstand, gets a pillow, a duvet, and the baby's monitor, and leaves closing the door quietly.
Two teenage girls are laying on the grass covered by a duvet, gossiping and thinking they people are not paying attention to them, as it’s usual for teenagers. The short-haired brunette says she’s still reading the book she borrowed, but she keeps touching her earlobes. She’s lying, she lost the book somewhere. Probably the tube station.
They go full snog again, John can't help himself stop grabbing Sherlock's arse here and again. 'Take off our clothes?' he murmurs, to which Sherlock sighs 'Ok.'. It's exciting being completely naked next to him, no barriers between the skin.
Come say hello on tumblr! I'm user thanks-mike-stamford.
you, and you promised this would work out between us.'
John snorts. 'And why would I do that?'
He can feel Diana glaring daggers at his back as he walks out with Mary. He notices she's holding some paper bags, and one from Ted Baker is handed to him when they enter the car.
‘It's not… it’s not with everyone. Sherlock is not a social person. At all. He barely glances at people if they are not a corpse.’ she doesn’t even blink at this statement. ‘So when he
The detective actually
'Chickpea curry and couscous with legumes. You can chop the vegetables, there you go.'
Eventually Molly and Greg have to leave and Mrs. Hudson claims there's something on telly she's been waiting the whole week. They lit a fire and seat at their chairs, enjoying the produced heat amidst January's coldness. John realises it's the first time they are properly alone since before Christmas, which is not that long ago but so much happened during that period that it feels like ages.
And all I wished was encore
'Sherlock, that's brilliant!'
So when he arrives in 221B he’s ready for a very, hugely awkward morning.
He dry swallows twice.
'Are you going to bed now?'
They rehearse what feels like a million times until the words stuck in John's brain. Sherlock says he genuinely is better at keeping his face neutral. At night he punches and kicks the sandbag to release the frustration. He goes over his sleep routine muttering the script. Sherlock had said that tomorrow they would exercise spontaneous answers to what she might rejoin during the first conversation, and after that all he should refrain doing to avoid raising suspicions from her.
, not looking up from his meal.
". Another irregular, a scrubby girl in her late teens called Nancy, gets the thermal box and a fifty. A bit later Molly confirms she has received it.
She holds his face and presses their lips together, lightly at first then pushing her tongue between the seam.
‘I'm Dr. Coleman, I’m taking care of your wife.’ she takes a look at the chart, which has some sheets clipped on it. ‘We ran some exams on Mrs. Watson. Blood pressure and glucose rate are okay. We had to wait a bit for endoscopy, which is not ideal without hours of preparation, but since it was an emergency I authorized it. The results just came in. It was detected the beginning of an peptic ulcer. That is what caused the expel of blood. There’s no bacteria in the stomach, though, so it probably developed from a nervous gastritis. Now that we’re aware it will be easily controlled, since it's early stage. She will need to be at observation for a couple days, though.’
Sherlock blinks at him, processing the information. He can't hide his following grin, and drops his head to kiss John's shoulder. 'Ah, John Watson. Always unpredictable.'
Giving her a bath means he gets all wet too. He announces he's going to take a shower himself after John came back upstairs, sans tart but carrying a Danish pastry from Mr. Chatterjee.
Hours pass by. He's thirsty, his back hurts from the hard floor, and the wound burns. His arms being locked over his head start to feel anesthetized. He had tried several times to dislodge the chain, but it is locked tight, and he can't feel his fingers anymore, so he is obliged to give up. The bathroom has a small window, but it's closed. He dozes off and when he wakes up he can see a faint brace of sunlight through it.
'It's not about the drugs!' he interrupts angrily, now staring at Sherlock's face. 'It's the overdose!'
with her new boyfriend and poisoned them against me. They never want to visit me and I can't just go there every weekend.'
He jumps at her voice. He had forgotten she was there, now looking at him with suspicion. 'They released news on Magnussen. I think that means Sherlock will be out soon.'
'Sorry about that.'
‘Good-morning, Dr. Watson.’ he says playfully. ‘I see you’re clean shaven.’
'Christ, you better not.' he says and they giggle together. 'Besides, Molly and Greg are more friends of yours than mine, it would be awkward as hell. Or the stag night all over again.'
'Bye-bye, John!'
'Sounds plausible. But what actually troubled me when you texted was that she made a point of visiting her and informing she's back in England.'
Oh yes, Moriarty. Lovely analogy.
She never asked about how to keep someone in love, especially after you hit the bottom of the booze. The divorce had been nothing short of grandiose.
Rosie clearly approves of this, as she bounces up and down and hangs strongly onto Mrs. Hudson's blouse. 'Oh Sherlock, a young boy on the street gave me this, I think it was one of your Irregulars.' she pulls out a folded piece of paper and he takes from her, reading hungrily.
. John pressed, counted moan-texts, even tried alcohol, to no avail. Before Christmas he had taken a look at her website. He had been more angry than turned on, and he had seen her naked. He used his porn email account (had a fake name and user ID) to enter the contact box, asking about some services. The budget she sent him was so absurd he didn't even reply to deny.
'The depiction of animal's lifestyle, especially pigs, is evidently completely equivocal,' he arguments, 'but the children's behaviour they are supposed to emulate is actually disturbing. Which means is more interesting, because children are capable of being quite... creepy.'
When they were writing the invitations, John had presented a quite mediocre list of possible parties. Mrs. Hudson, of course. Molly and Greg represented outlier relationships to him, since they were much more Sherlock’s friends than his. With Molly he barely remembered changing words that didn’t involve a dead body, or ever for that matter.
He starts in surprise. Sherlock is now sitting beside him, sleepy Rosie bundled in his arms. He hadn't noticed it was already her morning nap time, but she sure went down like clockwork. He lowers his voice and tells Sherlock what happened yesterday, to what he listens with a furrowed brow.
'Uuuuuuuugh.'
Mary can't know about his plans of moving back to Baker Street. He sends Sherlock a message before going to sleep to warn about her arrival. In the morning, he starts to dread the moment Mary and Rosie interact. He decides not to change his routine, and just pretend she's not here at all.
He looks at John, holding himself at military stance, gun unwavering. John catches his eyes, and mouths 'Ok?', to which Sherlock lifts the corner of his mouth and rolls his eyes, making John scoff slightly, as if he's trying to take this seriously. Sherlock mouths back 'Not good?', and John shakes his head just once.
He realises that he's thinking about hours. He's not sure how long has it been? He takes a look at his watch. It's a bit past noon. His watch also melts again his skin, and his breath shortens as he tries to remove it from his bone.
Sherlock just checks out more lines in the notepad.
Sherlock is grooming his hair in front of where allegedly there's a mirror. 'Go away!' he roars. It reverberates and makes the flat shake. Sherlock is not looking at them, threading his fingers through his curls, but Mary stares right after, he sees it coming, she points the gun at him and pulls the trigger, the shot is loud at his ears but he tackles her down and he can't open his eyes-
He places his free palm on Sherlock's chest, right over the spot where, under the layers of clothes, is located the most cruel scar on his body, in John's opinion. The bullet wound, right in the middle of his torax. The one that made Sherlock's clinical death a reality for two long minutes.
Jim makes a face not much different from a kindergarten teacher reprimanding a kid. 'Because then you will,
John hated him.
‘But you are not giving her the choice. You are basically threatening her in expense of a kid because of her past!’
The very last is a picture he knows by heart, of Anna-Greta with longer hair, still not bleached, from the file Mycroft had landed during Sherlock's duration in the hospital. 'Oh.' is all he contrives.
They look at each other, and John presumes Sherlock is trying to track his thoughts.
John has been very patient the whole day, so he waits for Sherlock to sign the adoption papers before making him drop everything at the desk, taking the amazing jawline in his hands and pulling his lips to himself.
'Of course, dear.' she smiles sadly and goes back to her own flat.
Strange visitors and a frustrated attempt of functioning.
‘You see, John.’ she folds her hands on her lap. ‘Jealousy is natural. You’re human and entitled to feel insecure. But there’s a difference between feeling and acting on it.’
'Our relationship, John. The shift in it.' Sherlock answers without diverting his eyes.
'You're not doing it right then.' Sherlock replies calmly for the first time since the conversation began. 'Everyone loves to see the worst in me. You are always the first to point it out. But John… he sees the best in me. A part I didn't believe it existed for a long time. Don't tell me this is wrong.'
It's still 28/01 in your timezone? I'm posting this before 21h where I live.
'John, NO.
Sherlock smiles dryly at him, the thin press of lips illustrating he acknowledges it. John sighs, takes a sip. 'I am a bastard for not helping her, aren't I?'
The month after the Brighton exile, as Sherlock calls in his head, has been a bit slow on the crime side. Lestrade called him only once just to ask some advice on a potential murder of a gymnastics instructor case. Sherlock asked a few questions, had him send a couple pictures of the crime scene and the bathroom of the gym, and ruled out murder. Lestrade, despite what Sherlock loudly professes, is not that thick. He already suspected it had been entirely accidental and had just called Sherlock for confirmation. That had been almost two weeks ago.
'You still look uneasy, though.' Ella remarks.
"I can control it." he had thought.
When he arrives home at night Anna is awake in bed, making sour faces with a hand over the top of her belly and a glass of water on the bedside table. He puts the room in a dim light to not disturb her and approaches, kneeling by the bed. ‘Are you okay?’ he asks in a low voice.
had told him how he had been saved. He vaguely remembers Sherlock's scared and relieved face when he opened his eyes. But at the hospital Mary had stayed quiet about his participation so John just presumed firemen had done it. And then Magnussen insisted in making John watch Sherlock running unaided to the fire, yelling and emotional, he knew something was terribly wrong.
'It's good practice to read people, even if their behaviour is very artificial in this kind of environment.' Sherlock says, reclining on the sofa.
He removes his drenched socks and throws them aside along with the groceries bag, going back downstairs barefoot. He starts out of his skin when he notices Sherlock is sitting on his chair, reading a file.
'Why not let Mycroft's minions track her?'
John takes a shower and has a panic attack.
It's past lunchtime when John comes back home. He seems surprised to find Sherlock at home. Sherlock himself has been composing since after his shower. The piece he started weeks ago is almost finished now, and he still feels there's something missing out of it. He is standing by the window, holding the violin in his left hand while he writes another chord on his sheet music. John clears his throat and Sherlock looks up at him.
'Right. So let's establish something: you are...' he dry swallows. 'The most important person in the world for me. I'm not leaving.'
He opens his eyes abruptly, not moving from his position on the sofa. The tentative daylight of the early morning is already illuminating the room. John's been sleeping for hours now. Something is wrong. What is it?
"Also did you" his mind supplies.
He tilts his head slightly. 'Money laundering is one thing many are ready to do given the opportunity with low risks. Murder, though? Didn't think you had it in you.'
He raises the hand in his chest to trace that impossible face with his fingertips. A glass of scotch would masquerade the sensation of free fall his stomach is doing right now, but he must work with what he has. 'I love you.'
There's a long pause. He looks out of the window to confirm he's getting closer. 'John?'
Unexpectedly, Sherlock smiles at him. 'John, you are asking advice from the world's only consulting detective.'
He delicately puts the violin back on the case, and closes the sheet notebook. He stands there, in the middle of the living room, not knowing what to do. John finally takes pity of him. 'Let's… sit? We need to talk.'
'I didn't.' Sherlock replies simply.
And also way more risky, she made sure to remind herself every time.
'Up to you.' she shrugs, already at the door, before turning to John. 'This one will be another on gory medical stuff or fake fiction about spy Gregory House and his smarter than he looks assistant James Wilson?'
-- * --
'Yeah, ahn… do that, please.' John couldn't think for any reason to be there anymore. 'Thank you. I should go to your brother now.' he moves to pass by him, but Mycroft touches his shoulder with the black umbrella.
Sherlock's response to that had been 'It's the appropriate development milestone for a three months old child, John, don't get so enthusiastic.', but he had smiled all the same and John saw him surreptitiously taking a picture of her new development milestone on his phone when he thought John wasn't looking.
'Oh dear, we finally have everyone together. How are you my lovelies?' finally said a tiny man entering the room in an expensive suit.
'So you're doing this out of a sense of obligation?'
Despite his earlier mental preparation, a cold hook seizes Sherlock's stomach. He swallows, but his mouth is dry. That was quite straightforward. John needs to move on this relationship. He wouldn't be the first.
'Well, he was one of creepiest persons I've known.' he opts for a facetious tone. 'Quite nightmare material.' Sherlock snorts at this.
Sandbox in the bathroom is clean, the water fountain is turned on, and cat toys are all dispersed around the living room. The door to the stairs is closed and locked as they keep their own bedroom door open.
John dry swallows twice, looking at everywhere but Sherlock.
He looks around the room. There's a broom propped on the wall, where he cleaned an accidentally broken glass cup earlier this evening. He gets up smoothly, gathers the broom, and moves to the corridor. He can see the living room lights are on. The closet under the stairs door is open, hiding someone. He aims the broom high.
He had planned not to say a word to Anna, but with such a huge coverage, it's impossible to feign ignorance on the matter without seeming suspicious. They usually watch together the news in the morning, before he leaves for the clinic. As they do it today, he remains silent having heard the news for the millionth time.
' Sherlock cuts him off, holding his wrists, but doesn't attempt to take his hands from his face. 'You're not going to die. I know it's frightening, but it's going to be over. I promise.'
The only issue is what happens everyday at 10:27pm.
'Ah.'
John gapes at him for a long moment, and drops his eyes to the album in his hand. It was hidden in a box at the top of their wardrobe. He didn't remember it being there yesterday, so he took it out to check what it was. Turns out Sherlock had rescued it. He opens it and flicks over some pages. There is her all over the place, but he also can see Molly, Greg, Mrs. Hudson. One picture shows Janine with Sherlock. Chief bridesmaid and best man. He still can't fathom how they became a thing, even if it was for a case.
The breast milk has finished and she's taking formula now. She makes a face every time she starts drinking, but the hunger probably has a louder voice for her. The lack of updates also tells him that Mary hasn't attempted to come back to London.
In the middle of his fettuccine Alfredo a text pings on his phone. He checks surreptitiously. It's from Mycroft.
'Yep.'
At this point I just want to finish this before October because it's getting a bit ridiculous.
'We can't wait much. We don't know what she's thinking right now.'
'Ah, should have known.' John says, giving away his gun for one of the MI6 guys to collect it, while the other two drag Brent Sullivan away. 'But how did you know this was happening?'
I have to say: I'm taking some liberties with Rosie's age and how much time passed since they came back from Morocco, so the timeline makes sense to me.
'You sure you're going to eat everything on your own?' John asks, adjusting the volume. 'Just warn me so I can buy some loperamide.'
Long story short. I moved out from my family home, because I'm taking a master degree in another state. So the last two weeks were very busy, I should have anticipated. Btw, since my classes started already I'll be posting the chapters on weekends from now on! Hope you haven't given up on me? #oops
'Sherlock.'
I want him to stay forever with me
He concentrates on breathing for a moment. 'Can I meet him before that?'
.' he answers between his teeth.
John believes him, and thankfully it is over by the end of the afternoon. Sherlock waits by the sink as he takes a shower. He finds out Wiggins came by and left him the clothes that were back at the house. There's also a note saying "
'Nope.' he sighs, drinking, picking up a fish.
A month later takes Sherlock, Rosie and Mrs. Hudson to a flower show fair in central London, to the insistence of the later. Sherlock argues that she doesn't have a garden or any open space appropriate to the cultivation of overpriced flowers and her window sills are too narrow even for small vases, so going there it's a waste of time for both them and the traders. She just shushes him.
'Yes, I know.' she sounds tight, but maintains a polite tone. 'I tried to contact her, but she's not answering. Do you think you could…?'
?' Brent yells hysterically, his voice rising a whole octave. 'That fucking Mary Watson should be going to prison! She's an assassin! Where is she, uhm? I'm not the only one who wants to know!'
'Ahhmm, no sure. I-' he stops and restarts in a quiet whisper. 'I dunno I dunno please get me please.'
Suddenly Sherlock's is a whirlwind as usual, dismissing his health condition and talking about Moriarty and pardoning. He and Anna follow him out of the plane, but Mycroft stops him before he leaves.
An hour later she takes pity on them, and suggests they go back. She does have a vase of peace lily and seems happy about it, so the whole trip hasn't been a fiasco. John now works in the mornings, so he will probably be home soon, which cheers Sherlock up. They are approaching Regent's park when he spots a figure walking purposefully in their direction.
He feels stupid because he was the one who called and made an appointment. He should just
Sherlock stalks to the window and makes a melodramatic face just in time for John to hear footsteps on the stairs. His guess proves correct as Mycroft appears on the hallway, classic three-piece suit and umbrella in hand. 'No need for furor, brother dear. I came with good news to you.'
'Of course I don't.' he gets defensive. 'I'm afraid she will run away with my daughter if we divorce!'
'Well, I hope there isn't a next time of that.' she responds, insinuative. 'Are you going to Sherlock's today?'
He doesn't fully agree that the things happening are not his fault, but he accepts it. 'Ok.' Then he perceives the scene. They are both in the bathroom just after Sherlock takes a shower, and is currently in a semi-nakedness situation. He remembers thinking about what Janine had that he didn't. He takes a deep breath, gathering more courage than he would believe it was necessary, and stare right into Sherlock's eyes.
'I said I
'Of course I want to.'
A series of punches in the abdomen.
‘It’s empty, isn’t it?’ he said without putting emphasis in the question mark.
not beta-ed, not brit-picked, not first language. Any wrong grammar please let me know.
'Get rid of him.' he says quietly.
They do say third time's a charm. He's not alone this occasion.
'What is this?' he frowns, looking inside. A black peacoat too posh styled for him is the content.
'Why do you call her Anthea?'
'Well, it's because IT'S NOT TRUE isn't it?' he snaps at Sherlock.
Knuckles rap the door to the living room, interrupting his monologue. 'Woo-hoo! Oh, look who is here!'
'Well, I'm not moving from here, so you can try to knock me up to leave the bathroom, and we both know how
The curry simmers a bit, and he takes a spoonful and offers it to Sherlock's mouth, as his hands are occupied with carrots at the moment. Sherlock accepts it, and hums thoughtfully. 'A bit more of pepper flakes.'
So guys....... there it is! Obviously it was better in my mind than when I put in words, but the fact that I finished this is an accomplishment per se! Remember that I thought it would be over before setlock? *snorts loudly*. And in two days this will become an AU... Until we have like 5 years before getting new content.
'And then he went and did that himself, in the stupidest way possible.'
EDIT: Next chapter 10/02, due to extenuating circumstances. Hope to see you there!!!
Right after sending it, he opens the conversation of the sneakiest person on his network, who answers immediately.
John quickly undresses to his vest and pants, and notices Sherlock is still wearing a towel around his hips and a t-shirt, looking ridiculous and a bit unsure about the proceedings. John feels like doing some blinking himself.
She starts a monologue about the wide selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes and if he thinks about completely abandoning meat Indonesia would be very suitable to start with (what). He nods and reacts here and then, discreetly checks his phone for any sign from Sherlock.
But as soon as dropped to Earth, he realised how much of the situation resembled Irene Adler's case. Sherlock wouldn't
Sherlock of course promptly forgets about the cake, but Mrs. Hudson saves it from burning. When it's cooled enough, and subtly frosted, they sing happy birthday to Rosie (even Sherlock), while she claps her hands, full smile with a handful of teeth, clearly loving every minute of attention.
'Ok.' he replies. Sherlock frowns at him from his chair, to where he moved during the brief interaction. Janine just looks at John in a perceptive fashion, goes to Sherlock and
At one point during the middle of the night he is awakened by Mr. Clearwater calling the nurse. Apparently he is in pain. John tries to move his head to the other side and go back to sleep, but he catches a glimpse of the window. On the outside, framed by the dark, a tabby cat with purple eyes is sitting on the windowsill. John feels his heartbeat pace increasing, a scream sinks at his throat. The cat jumps down and he can't do anything about it.
Sherlock stays where he is, but splays a hand on John's thigh. 'Stop apologising, we talked about it. Do we really need it? I'm liking… just this'
He blinks. 'You're not taking her with you?'
'Terrorist?
'As you should.' he replies, as if it's a matter of fact.
-- * --
And yet what she said about him ignoring "Sherlock's kicked puppy faces" - and he shudders from the expression - is making him uncomfortable. Has he been doing that? Has Sherlock been so readable to everyone but him? John has been cruel to him all this time?
'One of those on and off then?' John looks at him from under his eyelashes. Sherlock realises he's a bit content with that prospect.
The car enables a bluetooth connection to his phone through the radio system. He prefers not to listen to music while driving, but he does tap the panel screen to make a phone call. It rings twice before they pick up.
This makes John look up at her. 'Your condolences?' he asks, confused. 'Why are you giving me your condolences?
. He averts his eyes, trying to conceal his face.
Everything would be alright.
'Yes.'
John finishes the whisky before speaking. 'Nothing actually happened between me and James. He would come to the medical tent at night and we… talked. About everything. I never felt lonely when he was there. There was an occasion when I thought we were going to kiss, but someone entered the tent asking for painkillers and we lost the moment. He was my superior, it would be a mess if people found out.'
“I know enough,” Sherlock responds. “And anyway, you have even less reason to trust me and yet here you are.”
John growled in frustration. “Are you ever going to let me in on your devious plan? And since when do you speak Arabic?”
“I- I don’t know. I mean, yeah, we get on, but he’s… I don’t know, he’s kind of loud, to be honest. And he’s mostly off with some girl.” At this Sherlock seemed to relax.
“Right, right. Definitely not because you leak like a faucet, no.” He leaned over, ignoring Sherlock’s blooming red face, to pat him on the thigh. “I just think we’re going to need a bit more than what you’ve got, love. No worries, I’ll pop upstairs and grab mine. Be back in a mo.”
“No! Of course not! No, I swear. It was just too dark to see, my eyes hadn’t adjusted yet and she looked terrified and I just… I don’t know, I just reacted. I probably should have realized it was you sooner…”
Mrs. Hudson leant in and asked, "What's going on?"
He needed to get it under control. How much longer could he hide his almost daily reaction to Sherlock’s presence? He’d been so sure he could end the stupid fighting debacle by a clean win. He’d
They reluctantly moved away from door and toward the open doorway across the hall.
cliché apparently, and tried not to notice the dwindling amount in his wallet. His next pension cheque wouldn’t drop in his account for another five days, as Scarlett was proving to be an expensive date this week, and this was only their second one, he resigned himself to ready meals and no cream for his tea for the rest of the week.
He stared at their clasped hands, Sherlock’s larger one cradling his smaller one, his thumb gently rubbing away the dried blood from his knuckles.
Sherlock looked around but his eyes came back to John’s in confusion. “I- I thought you weren’t coming back,” he whispered, trying to sit up further.
"No, not obviously." He tugged John's jacket straight as if guilty. "I'm sorry, John, I didn't see it before."
"I've got my phone," he answered.
"John," Sherlock warily drawled as he neared his target.
He quit the flat but John couldn’t be bothered to give a farewell.
“Yes.”
“Oh, no,” he muttered. “Will you excuse me?”
John nicked Mrs. Hudson’s spare key from the chair cushion in the foyer, as Sherlock had shown him, and made his way silently as possible into her flat. All was quiet in the front of the flat but John could just make out the sound of Mrs Hudson’s telly in her bedroom; a luxury she’d purchased after Sherlock had first moved in and she’d received her first cheque from Mycroft. She’d divulged that bit of information that morning as they’d discussed Sherlock’s mysterious brother. The kitchen looked the same since he’d been in last. He did manage to find a half-eaten tray of Jammie Dodgers on the counter, which he grabbed after nabbing the peas. He balanced the lot and sneaked back out as silent as he’d come. It wasn’t high treason but John did get a little heart-pounding rush as he crept back out the front door with his pilfered items.
John pinched him on the arm, which started a small battle of wills, distracting them from the argument for a short time. John eventually pinned Sherlock’s arms down and leveled a stare at him at that effectively kept him from complaining. He’d have to learn to circumvent that in the future, but until then he was stuck listening to John’s counter argument.
“No, you can help,” John rushed out, “that would be fine. Yeah.”
Greg tipped his head back and looked him up and down. "Why bother, mate? I'm not an idiot. I mean if you want to keep it hush hush, that's fine, I'll take it to the grave, but c'mon. Everyone already assumes anyway."
“I’ve never… That was the first. Ever.” He won’t meet John’s eyes now.
He cries out when Sherlock pulls away suddenly but it’s only temporary, he’s frantically yanking his suit jacket off and John can’t complain about that. Once it’s off, John reaches up and pulls Sherlock back down, attacking that ridiculously gorgeous neck. He’s woken up in wet pants from dreams about it, he’ll not let the opportunity pass to feel it against his tongue and between his teeth now.
He winced but nodded. He did try to pay attention after that but the rhythmic, dull way Gregson droned on drove John round the bend. The professor had missed his calling in public talk radio.
John chuckled at that, picturing Sherlock making off with a whole leg under hot pursuit of campus security. “I bet. And what do you give her in return? Tips on the stock market?”
She rolled her eyes at him. “Just go with it then.”
"As I was saying," Sherlock continued, "esteemed guests, thank you for coming together to celebrate the blessed union of Mary Elizabeth and John Hamish Watson."
were.”
Meanwhile, he watches Sherlock. It’s getting dark outside, the street lights have come on, changing the ambiance of the room. John vaguely thinks about starting a fire. He feels it might add a touch of the dramatic should the night turn in his favour, but more likely it would become a force of destruction should it turn against him. He tells himself he doesn’t, or shouldn’t, care either way.
John cried out when Sherlock crashed his lips down but it was a sound of surprise, not of anger.
“You’re sure?” Sherlock queries.
Shout out again to my amazing betas
John panicked for a moment, not sure if Sherlock would follow or not. Surely he would know John had followed if he walked directly back to the table to find John missing.
"The speech? Oh, yes, go on, love," Mary waved Sherlock on with a smile.
In the night, John dreams of Sherlock reading the blog and smiling.
“John!" Sherlock cried. “Please explain to this woman why her pathetic attempt to goad me is not going to work."
“What look?” Sherlock postured up.
"Depends. What is today?"
“No offence but I think you do need some looking after. You tend to be a bit… reckless.”
"Your wedding, John, your
John cracks an eye open. “Why do you ask?”
"Well, yeah, obviously," John remarked.
friends?”
, or you’ll be shitting in a bag for the rest of your life,” Oliver colourfully threatens. He looks the type to fulfill the threat too; an honest to god real Mexican gangster. Probably closer in age to John than the rest, his hair is greying at his temples, his skin his roughened by the sun, and he completes the aesthetic of a Southern cowboy with his snakeskin boots and shirt tucked into his jeans. There’s a quiet menace about him, but John can still sense the desperation behind all the posturing, belaying the fact that he’s truly frantic for word from his fiancée.
“There they are!” The owner bellowed from about twenty meters off. He had security involved now.
“Don’t worry, we’ll go back for it later.” The man turns the air back down and cracks his window; the cooler night air rushes up past John from behind, ruffling his hair.
John shuffled up to where Sherlock lay and flopped down. He kissed Sherlock’s shoulder gently before crawling up to kiss him proper on the mouth. Sherlock welcomed him, and was welcomed by him, to explore with lazy inhibition. The kiss turned heated quickly, the motion of John’s tongue against his own too much after knowing how it felt against other sensitive bits.
John shook his head. “No. You don’t get to do that, pretend like you give a shit what I think.”
"Yes," he hissed and pushed back.
“I’ll do my best,” he offered as Mike helped him off the couch. They stumbled- Mike was hardly better off than he was- and crashed noisily into the bedroom, both trying not to knock the other down in the process. A couple was already in attendance, it seemed, when they got the door open. They sped past in a rush and John fell against the wall in a huff. Mike giggled with that scandalized innocence he still seemed to have. Without further thought, John stumbled forward on unsteady legs and fell face first into the pile of coats on the bed.
Sherlock groaned as his heart rate spiked and sweat popped all over his scalp.
John stopped pawing around in his bedside drawer, his quizzical expression melting into something decidedly more filthy.
"We've talked about this. I'm not going to over-"
The very bottom curve,
He raised up and, with a small frown of concentration, moved them into alignment. Sherlock did his best to hold perfectly still, both to ease John’s path and to help memorize the moment as it happened. With the condom in place, it was hard to pinpoint the exact feeling - he’d have to have them tested soon so they could eventually do away with the thing - but soon the feeling of entering John became abundantly clear.
“Good?”
felt flushed, so maybe Sherlock wouldn’t notice. Thinking of it, he pulled his jumper up over his head and tossed it. Sherlock noted this but didn’t comment.
Sherlock stood, a bit abruptly, and took his cup to the sink to set it next to John’s. John turned in his chair to watch him move about the kitchen.
Sherlock didn't miss a beat after John started to piston into him. His back arched in pleasure and he clawed at John in an attempt to pull him in closer, harder. He laced their fingers together and made damn sure Sherlock's cock was snuggly pressed between them as he shoved into him. He had moments left, bare seconds, before he finished, and he'd be damned if he went before Sherlock did. His lips found his lover's and he poured every bit of satisfied longing into his kiss, tried to say with skin what he couldn't say with words. It seemed to work, as Sherlock tore away on a gasp.
"Are you kidding?" He looked down incredulously. "I couldn't be more prepared if a team of footballers had gone in before you."
John shifted his weight to the side, off Sherlock’s chest, and breathed in the dark, herbal scent of his cologne. “No, of course not,” he finally answered. “It was going to be after a case.”
Sherlock tensed up in partial shock when John covered his erection with the slick, he’d been so distracted by John’s penis he’d nearly forgotten his own. The remainder of its rigid existence threw the situation into stark relief. He was glad John had thought to bring condoms, because, though he was fairly sure they were both clean, he was more concerned with lasting any satisfactory length of time. It wouldn’t do for Sherlock to shoot off mid-breach their first go round.
John was shocked when, by the time Mrs. Hudson came around the corner, Sherlock had already conjured real tears with which to deliver a heartfelt, “We were attacked! It was awful!”
“Well how was I to know?” John heard come from down the hall. He frowned to himself. Sherlock was hiding something, no doubt about that.
John snickered, picturing Sherlock at the kitchen table, face melted off Ark of the Covenant style, and rolled back over onto his stomach.
Having Mrs. Hudson’s bag of peas would actually have been quite useful, but he’d taken them back downstairs that morning. He instead rooted around in Sherlock’s freezer.
“But what are you going to do now?” She didn’t even mean it maliciously. It was obvious she was under the assumption that she was the driving force in his life.
John eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he was distracted by Mrs. Hudson bustling past. She set the tea tray down on the coffee table at Sherlock’s feet and John frowned when Sherlock didn’t lift a finger to help her. Not that John knew but Sherlock had his knuckles rapped enough times to know better.
“Touch me,” John begged, the words nearly intelligible against his mouth.
“So sorry.” He scratched absently at his sticky thigh, glancing back at the sound of John’s zip being pulled down. He raised an eyebrow, meeting John’s eye over his shoulder.
The bloke twitched and hiccupped as John pulled away with a last lick. He took the liberty of laying his head against a surprisingly muscular thigh. They both breathed deep in the near silence of the room.
“Confused? About what?”
John's POV. No smut in this one, just good old fashion John awkwardness and Sherlock antics.
“Hmm, you’re so warm. Do you always run this hot?”
drink. Wouldn’t you say, John?”
Mary and Janine stood behind the Three Musketeers as they spied at the door.
That comment was so stupid it sailed right over hilarious and settled somewhere in soft giggle territory. "No, you idiot."
John thrust wildly against Sherlock’s thigh and demanded, “Take me home, take me home right now.”
“Sherlock,” John managed, drawing Sherlock’s eyes up from where they’d lingered around John’s bare feet. “You said earlier… that you’d wanted to go slow,” he let the statement linger open-ended, a question of intent.
“Women’s polo? That one?”
And then upon second thought,
"Oh no," Molly cried, "I know that sound! Somebody is squeezing a cat too hard, the poor thing. We've got to find it!"
“Um, sure, yeah, I guess,” John finally answered, just as Sherlock was about to pull the offer entirely.
“Hmm,” Sherlock hums in contemplation, seeming to file the information away. “Nothing like this then,” he concludes.
John clearly remembered Sherlock being high as a kite at their first introduction, but kept this bit to himself.
“Mmm, I was going to say ‘Curiosity killed the cat’ but,” he shrugged casually, “you obviously didn’t like what you heard.”
“There,” he snapped. “Happy now? Shall we go?”
“You won’t. He’ll have you running every day for the next fifty years, until your bones are too brittle to go on.”
Putting aside the fact that apparently Mary was planning on murdering him on their wedding night, "No..."
John was shaking his head before Sherlock was even finished. In fact, it seemed his whole frame was shaking, each part of his body was vibrating or shivering or fidgeting.
“Mmm,” Sherlock agreed with a cautious touch at John’s back. “Was she really okay with this?”
“What brings you into a place like this? Not your usual, is it?” Sherlock pointed out.
While Sherlock teared haphazardly at his shirt, John pulled Sherlock’s shoes and socks off. He pulled the trousers down next and tossed the lot behind him carelessly; he didn’t think Sherlock cared about wrinkles just then. His shirt had landed in the puddle of tea that had been spilled; he might actually care about that later.
The next morning, John wakes to his mobile alarm, and immediately groans in pain, as his thighs, back, and shoulder all scream louder and longer. Having slept in the rental hasn't done him any favours; next time he’ll spring for a motel, no matter how shady they appear.
John looked them over in obvious confusion. Idiot.
“Sherlock, dear, your new student is downstairs, shall I send him up?”
“As I was saying,” Mycroft went on, “these are contingent upon your continued sobriety.”
“Soon,” he whispered against cupid bow lips. “The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can go home, yeah?”
” He scoffed in disbelief and turned away.
“Or, perhaps, this is just a suggestion, you could
“The tests stop but don’t think I won’t be dropping in from time to time to check on you.” John heard the snap of the briefcase and the sound of Mycroft standing. “The stunt with the cough syrup almost cost you another six months, keep that in mind. If John weren’t there, I would have sent you to Yorkshire without hesitation.”
“No, Mike, I’m not-”
She eyed him and John felt the sneaking suspicion he should already know this answer. “My mother is from Lebanon…”
“I asked you to put away the… enlarged pancreas,” John guessed, to which Sherlock inclined his head, “since you know very well that Laila is on her way up for our study session. You were, oh-so-conveniently ignoring me.”
Sherlock flipped though the cards, seeming to reject several parts. "John this, John that. Oh, here's another story about
Instead of looking offended John sat back against the sofa and laughed. ”All right, I won’t smudge your doodle.” Sherlock let out a tiny breath of relief. Perfect, idiot John. “So is it for a case or were you just feeling creative?”
“No,” he agreed, pulling a bottle of Coke from the fridge, “but this will.”
Oh no, he'd short circuited Sherlock's brain again.
Sherlock snorted.
“What?” Sherlock breathed.
The two deviants looked at each other and proceeded to giggle all the way home.
Mrs. Hudson wasn't even trying now, she was just transferring Sherlock's empty glasses for full ones as the waiters passed by.
John’s pulse jumped. He could tell, just by the way Sherlock froze, the way he paled, Seb was the dealer. Seb was
“Wow,” Scarlett breathed. “That was-”
“So… do you want to get off now or…?”
The party wasn’t hard to find; it had spilled out into the hall, with several people milling about, drinks in hand. Raucous conversation and heavy bass beats filled the air as he neared. He shoved his way inside without care and marched to the nearest source of booze.
His accusatory words died a warrior’s death at Sherlock’s tongue as it cut them down where they lived. John gave a pleasant hiss and a moan as Sherlock wedged his thigh between John's legs. Feeling brave, he then shifted until their erections brushed. Oh, it was heady, knowing John wanted him too. They growled at each other when Sherlock gripped John's leg and hitched it up around his waist, grinding their cocks together, despite layers of impediment. John held Sherlock tight under his jacket, one hand round his waist, the other clawing fiendishly at his arse, pulling him in harder.
"That was hours ago," he responds.
“You…want me to read the blog?” Sherlock hesitates, working it out.
“What about Donovan?” Sherlock questioned, pointing out the obvious weak link in Greg’s directive. “She’s been waiting to pin a murder on me for years.”
“Are you still open for me, do you think?” He questioned congenially. All he received was a whimper and a thrust back. He ran his middle finger up and down lightly. “Maybe I don’t even care,” he mused. “Maybe I go in anyway, after all the bollocks I’ve put up with tonight.”
“I think you’d look dashing in glasses,” John teased. Probably teased.
“He called.” She opened her mouth to deny or placate but Sherlock cut her off. “John, prepare yourself. We’re going to have a guest today.”
.” John’s hand raked through his hair, tugged once, hard, and Sherlock saw stars again. His eyes rolled and he sucked harder, the bullet wound forgotten.
Blood pooled low in John’s stomach, ran in a loud rush in his ears. Possessive tendencies perhaps… John was his only friend afterall. He ran his fingertips hard over his breastbone and tried to keep the rising hope down.
“I don’t have a problem with dogs, it’s just that it’s sort of a… bland answer. Dogs.”
“I swear she did!”
It was almost a surprise to see but he’d drawn the two of them at St. Bart's, from John’s perspective, with Sherlock as a small figure atop the building. Here John was the one crying, little broken hearts scattered throughout. Seeing such a childish rendition of that tragic day did nothing to lessen the blow.
John, in a fit of dark emotion, reared back, eyes glaring with what he assumed was clear malice. Sherlock didn’t care, or seemed not to care, that he was enraging a man who had a hand wrapped so near his windpipe.
“Thanks for waiting with me,” John said as he sat back down with his grape fizzy drink.
They’re back onto the road, kicking up dust in their wake, before John remembers the gun in his hand. He drops it to the floor of the car and sits back. A giggle escapes; his adrenaline is coming down, leaving him giddy. To his surprise, the man seated next to him starts giggling too, albeit a much deeper, masculine chuckle.
“Not that it’s any of your fucking business,
“After I teach you how to properly fight, you mean?” He teased.
“John?” He croaked, blinking confused eyes up at John where he was hunched over him.
“You’re going to be hell on this sprain,” John noted, “I can tell already.”
He fumbled for his mobile, dialing a number he was loath to call but needs must.
He made some sort of high-pitched bird noise in his throat, both at the soft endearment and at John’s touch. “I’m sure I have no idea,” he managed, panting into the forearm he’d thrown over his face.
They scrambled, bumping into each other in the doorway. John heard Greg mumble about his damn cigarettes and then slam the door.
“You want to live together?” He seemed in shock.
“Good. I’ll just put away the pancreas.”
"It's okay! Hey, it's okay, Clara. I won't say anything. We don't have to talk about it."
Sherlock hummed noncommittally and went back to his drawing.
Clara looks to the floor and grins. "I'll tell her, thanks."
What none of them needed to voice was whether or not John reciprocated. Not a one of them would ever forget what Sherlock leaving had done to John Watson. It wasn't a question of if he reciprocated, it was a question of why he hadn't thrown himself at Sherlock the second Sherlock had reappeared and held on as tight as he could.
It had been a few hours but there was a good chance he could do it without prep and without extra lubrication. Only one way to find out. He yanked Sherlock’s belt open, the button and zip next, and then tugged until the offending material was pulled down enough for John to get at his goal. He kept the trousers partly on so Sherlock couldn’t spread his legs. This was new and he looked up at John in slight confusion. When John gripped him by the ankles and lifted his legs up, thus lifting his arse up, the goal became clear. He helped by scooting further down and John made quick work of getting his cock out one handed. One stroke and he was ready to line himself up.
“All right, Harry?” He gave a cursory greeting before jumping right in. “I’ve got a question, do you remember the name of the first bloke I ever kissed?”
“C’mon then.” John reluctantly got his shoulder under Sherlock’s arm and together they hobbled back down to the sitting room.
Sherlock tried to swat at him but John easily leaned away from his reach. Sherlock sat back against his chair with an indignant huff.
“I can’t quite picture you all round the table for Christmas.” John thought, despite Sherlock’s assurance otherwise, he probably had grown up in a drafty manor house, lonely, left to his own devises.
“Oh, fuck,” John cries out at the first feel of skin on skin.  “Christ.” His back arches, tailbone digging painfully into the floor, but he doesn’t care.
“So you’ve really never had an assistant before?”
“It’s brilliant, really,” he preened. “Cough medicine has just enough alcohol to inebriate but it’s completely legal. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it sooner.”
Just as he made to reach for his mobile, the downstairs door opened and closed, seventeen heavy and slightly listing steps later his flatmate appeared.
“Oh!” She exclaimed. “What happened in here?" they heard her shuffling past the detritus left over from the flipped over coffee table.
“The Shadow Lounge on-”
John worries that maybe he should have just left well enough alone. It was an eventuality that Sherlock would see the blog entry, but did John want to stand witness while he did it? What if Mary was right? What if it were obvious how...
"One or two sure, but twenty?" John grinned and took another swig.
And then he struck.
“Mmm,” John melts against Sherlock despite his questions, “fuck.”
It’s such a random thought, but John can’t help but appreciate how much difference there is in sucking cock in a nightclub or just after a firefight, and now. Clean is the first thing John notices, basically.
Lestrade cried out, “Oi! We’re not done here!” but Sherlock kept walking towards the road, hailing a cab and disappearing before anyone could do much more than blink.
“So why come now? Why not then? Or before?”
“Did I make it to the crime scene yesterday?” He asked to fill the silence.
“Oh, do be serious! This isn’t something you can just-“
“You’re stoned?”
“Huh?” He glanced up absently, not quite ready to hear more.
“She went on break, I’m her replacement.” Sherlock gave a practiced grin.
Laila rubbed circles onto his back as he leaned heavily over his knees but didn’t comment on that.
a chance to settle. But then you started seeing Laila and that was... Hard. I reacted badly. The cough syrup, my birthday, the fight, Victor, all of it. I'm sorry, John. You were singing about her and it was like a slap in the face."
Sherlock rushed back into the sitting room. "I said he was lactose intolerant!" He accused them all of idiocy with his expression. There was several seconds of inaction but as soon as Sherlock growled in frustration and snagged his coat on the way out the door everyone snapped into action.
“It’s like you said, I don’t let anyone close. Just. You.” He waited for John to respond, and when John couldn’t he went on. “If you can’t figure out what that means, you really are an idiot.”
“Possible murder,” he answered, tugging his scarf tight.
But that didn’t explain everything else John was apparently upset over. He thought
“This what you wanted, aye?” John snapped, tossing Sherlock into the sitting room, kicking the door shut behind him.
Sherlock made a noise, a self-satisfied noise in John’s opinion, but when John looked up with a glare, Sherlock was glancing - flirtatiously - at Victor. It was possible John bent the handle of his fork with his thumb.
John steadied Sherlock with a hand to his chest, his heaving, flushed chest, and pulled back out. It quickly became apparent that holding his lover down was not going to be an option. Not if they didn’t want to break Greg’s lamp in the process. He enraged Sherlock to the point of spitting when he pulled out but when he flipped the swearing git over John received a happy sort of noise.
John found the renewed energy to practically throw Sherlock down onto his bed by his shirt front.
“John! John, John, John,” Sherlock cried out, gripping John’s shoulders, head, neck, everywhere he could reach as he squirmed.
“What have you done now, you great fool?” Mrs. Hudson bustled in behind John, who grimaced as if to say he’d done his best.
“Oh. So… uh,” he turned toward his dresser and continued to pull clothes out for the day, “the rumours true then?”
John laughed, remembering the only threat that had ever actually worked on Sherlock. “I might have done. You are an infuriating git.”
John grinned despite himself. "I am. I am proud of him." He turned to look at Greg but upon noting the smug smile, nay grin, he was sending John's way he had to review what had just transpired. "No, I mean...You know what I meant."
John turned away with an incredulous chuckle, a hand to his brow as he laughed at the ground.
"Yeah, he's worth it," he agreed.
“No! No, Laila, your… bits… are fine, I’m sure.” They laughed at that. “It’s just that I’m… I’m trying to sort out- Oh, for fuck’s sake!” He reached into his apron and answered his phone when it became clear he was receiving a call and not a text. “What!”
John shook his head in confusion, looked ready to interrupt again so Sherlock plowed forward.
wrong."
“Incendiary,” Sherlock finished.
“I ask because I think you’d make a fantastic surgeon. Hands-on work would be your forte, obviously.”
John sighed. “No. But, uh, I think-” He fidgeted on the pavement.
“Yes,” he growled low, “but I never said you had to follow.”
“Aw, don’t be like that. I still care for you. I just wanted to make sure you’re all right.”
"No," he mumbled, instantly contrite. After the decree that Dr. Watson was never again allowed to give another prostate exam, John had left Sherlock alone on the bed and refused to come back until he'd apologized.
“No offence was taken I just-“
“I, uh, I try not to judge but… yeah, I suppose you could say that. She’s been faffing off a bit with this girl, Teresa. I think that’s why she’s been skipping class lately.”
“Laila!” John cried in surprise.
Greg's brain chugged along faster than one would assume, considering the amount of alcohol he'd already ingested before the reception and during, piecing an idea together in seconds of its inception.
“No, you imbecile. I took dancing at school.”
“Ah, I see.”
Sherlock hung up, knowing all too well where it was located. He’d thank Mycroft later, if John was in fact there.
“Yeah,” he answered as quietly as he could given the noise.
“Now, how do you feel?” He asked.
“As pleasant as that would be, it would satisfy too many people at London Metro if I died from sexual frustration.”
“We don’t have to-” He shut his mouth with a click when Sherlock scowled up at him. “All right,” he chuckled, “let’s begin again, then, shall we?”
Nonetheless, he’d gotten his point across. Ms. Adler had been an interloper in their established dynamic and John was not as appreciative of her antics as Sherlock had been.
John merely smiled, like Sherlock was being particularly adorable. “How are you feeling now? Better?”
He glanced down at John’s wonderfully capable hands and decided.
Mycroft actually seemed to weigh the pros and cons of John’s suggestion, though John was hard pressed to envision Mycroft getting his leg up high enough to kick at the door at all, but eventually returned to the sitting room.
“Got this done almost a year ago,” he explained and began to shrug off his jacket and roll up the sleeves of his jumper to showcase the tattoo on his shoulder, the one that Sherlock already knew was there.
“What is it?” John asked.
He’d have to get the name of that PC in Lestrade’s office. Perhaps send him a fruit basket. That was, if not the best sex they’d ever had, certainly the most memorable. John would come to agree in time.
“Yes, well.” John fidgeted for the first time, losing his nerve somewhat, and what a shame that was. “I had some questions.”
John glanced at the Russian in embarrassment.
Without thought Sherlock bolted.
Sherlock smiled at John’s squinty pained look and couldn’t help but run his thumb between his brows to smooth the line there.
“Of course,” he replied immediately, turning his head to look Sherlock in the eye.
“I could murder you fantastically,” his threat made null by the fondness in his voice.
"I warned you, this isn't explicitly about what you want."
Sherlock dropped onto the bed like his strings had been cut, before John could even reach him. He seemed to wait patiently for further instructions.
Sherlock’s hand cramped suddenly and he dropped the pencil to massage away the pain. A glance at the clock announced how late it had gotten, how long he’d been hunched over his own knees. John should have been home by now.
Noticing that impediment for the first time, he snaked his hand underneath and tugged, trying to tell John to remove it, without words.
Greg didn't acknowledge how wretched John sounded. “Even the most stubborn of us need a mate. You've got Mary now. Sherlock needs a Mary. Or a Martin, whatever it is he prefers."
“They’ve stayed together, that’s got to be a good sign, right?”
John scowled anyway. They rested comfortably for a moment, Sherlock clearly anticipating the question, which was the only reason John didn’t blurt it out right away.
Sherlock laughed at that. “More likely than the rest.”
“The police are barely a meter away!” He hissed.
“It’s still sensitive and… Because I said.” He huffed and patted Sherlock’s hand in a sort of apology.
When the couple got up, Sherlock dove for the floor and hoped his coat shrouded him from the soft lighting of the aisle way. Once the coast was clear, he followed behind, mixing with the heavy crowd outside, until they rounded the corner toward the trendy restaurants on Holly Hill. Sherlock nearly intervened when Laiya stopped at an expensive Greek eatery, and John’s fingers flexed against his jeans. Didn’t she know he hated Greek? Didn’t she care? And to have no concern for his budget, unforgivable!
Greg sipped his and sighed. “Now, before we start with the paperwork, tell me; what
“That was ridiculous,” John announces with another snicker, runs a hand through his hair, and smiles at the ceiling of the rental.
“Yes?” He went for unperturbed but probably fell short as he stared up at John’s indigo eyes, shining in the morning light.
John swallowed another gulp and prayed Sherlock didn’t notice how wildly turned on he was. Honestly, it boggled the mind how Sherlock hadn’t noticed every time John stared or licked his lips or gripped his own thighs in an attempt not to touch.
“Wait!” Sherlock called out but his cries fell on deaf ears; John was already out the door.
“John,” Sherlock drew his name out, long and needy.
“I- Huh,” he mumbled, licking his lips nervously. “That makes a lot of sense actually. I’ve always had a hard time studying. Not so hard that I failed my classes but… I do have a hard time focusing on lectures and that,” he admitted.
“Wha-”
A groan, possibly of frustration. “No! Go away!”
"Dammit John, I'm bowing to your expertise again and you're missing it. Pay attention."
"You really think so?" He saves for her.
He stiffens up, takes a step back and knows he's effectively ended the conversation when she closes her mouth with a snap.
John blinked back, unable to process the words at first. “What?”
The knot of worry loosens in John's stomach and he lets out a breath. "You don't like it? He did have a mean swing."
“You got any kids?”
“Sound like a plan, then?”
“Why not?”
Not pulled closer. Not tugged, clung to, held. Kissed.
John looked up in guilt, but of course Sherlock couldn't even see him. "Maybe you're projecting." He smoothed the tape holding the gauze pad gently and sat up fully.
“I don’t really approve, considering,” he hedged quietly, “but…” He couldn’t help but look away, nervous in this absurd crossroad he’d been handed. Sherlock was damn near acknowledging the ‘something’ between them. What John wouldn’t do to get him to at least admit it. Lord knew he couldn’t seem to do it sober.
Mike was there, red faced and swaying with some bird with a long ponytail and a hideous jumper. Mary was there, damn her, with David of course, but David seemed more inclined to guzzle pints and pretend to throw darts at first years than pay her any mind.
John doesn’t misunderstand, he can feel the urgency in Sherlock’s movements. It’s the most erotic thing he’s ever seen, Sherlock flushed and sweating and desperate. He wants it to be so good that Sherlock has this moment inked indelibly on the back of his eyelids for the rest of his days. So he snatches Sherlock’s hand from where it lay bracing himself on the floor- his weight comes down harder on John’s chest but he takes it willingly.
More giggles escaped as John pictured Sherlock with a hammer and chisel, tapping away, making a mess for his landlady to find come morning.
“Would you slow down,” he hissed, “not all of us have legs up to our eyebrows. Do you even know where you’re going?”
"Finally," Sherlock snapped. Sally rolled her eyes but followed without comment as they made their way into the building. Greg met them at the top of the landing to the third story, and motioned them inside.
. He tugs those curls in his fist and growls, which gets him a hiss and then a surge forward of Sherlock’s hips. The fleeting impression of hard cock is blazed into John’s arse and then it retreats. Well he can’t have that.
“You could wear a burlap bag and I would find you ridiculously sexy,” John said with a breathy gasp as Sherlock rocked forward, pressing their groins together. “Keep that up and I won't be able to focus.”
Sherlock mentally screamed at the drug burning through his veins.
Sherlock paused just inside his bedroom with one hand on the doorknob. Part of him wanted to shut the door, while the side of him that yearned for information desperately wanted to listen to whatever would pass between John and his brother. John hadn’t ordered him to shut the door, which meant he had no real preference and had left it open for Sherlock to decide. He briefly considered what each course of action would tell Mycroft.
“You don’t know I have this.” He looked up at Lestrade as he slid his gun free of the foam padding, then scooped up two pre-filled magazines.
“And terrorize me with your cold nose,” John grunted, though he squeezed Sherlock’s hand at his sentiment. It was nice to see this side of Sherlock and not just the brilliant but analytical mind behind the suit. “It’s dripping on my neck.”
“Pretty much. Newcomers are always welcome, but they just don’t want the word spreading that guys come here just to have sex. They don’t need big brother up their arses.”
“That you would let me do this is one thing,” Sherlock said as he shifted his weight onto his knees between John’s thighs, “but to see you enjoy it is another entirely..”
“Well,” Lestrade said around a sigh, “if that isn’t a loaded question, I don’t know what is.”
about him."
Sherlock flipped his mobile in the air in smug satisfaction. He’d placed the order for both items earlier that morning, but what John didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. He’d known, the moment he found both items that John would approve, but it had dawned on him halfway through the day (as he was working on Mrs. Hudson’s sink) that with their new status, it would most likely be wise to run any purchases like that past John.
“Too bad I can’t fuck you over that trash bin,” John noted as he nodded towards a bin beside a bench. “Guess I’ll just go home and have a wank.” Cupping his groin, and showing off the outline of his erection, John turned on his heels and headed off in the direction of their flat, leaving Sherlock to zip up his trousers then hurry after him.
then?” He swiped the back of his hand over his mouth, catching a dribble of water, then cocked his head at John.
Ignoring the other voice in his head, the one that sounded suspiciously like John, Sherlock withdrew the kit from beneath the sink in the bathroom and withdrew a hyperdynamic needle and an elastic band before replacing the kit exactly as he’d found it.
“Guess it's your lucky day.” John said as he rolled a condom over his cock, “Fine then, flip over.”
“The one and only,” John laughed, “I’m his partner. Now in more ways than just one.”
“Okay,” Sherlock agreed as he let his hands drop to his side. “I’m all yours now, Sir.”
REGULATION is a real place. I have never been there. But their website makes it look amazing.
“When you say
The driver cleared his throat in the front of the taxi, getting John’s attention. With a hasty apology for his delay tossed the driver cash, then stepped out onto the pavement. A familiar feeling of nervous excitement pulsed through him.
Thankfully for him, Sherlock was able to glean from his words what needed to be done. The new angle aided his efforts, and it was only a matter of seconds before John was writhing beneath him.
“Can I ask you a question?” Sherlock asked while casting the D.I. a sideways glance.
John opened his eyes to find Sherlock’s lips twisted into a smirk as he eyed the bulge in John’s trousers. Luckily for John, Sherlock wasted no time removing him of his belt, trousers, and pants. In almost no time, John was standing before Sherlock wearing nothing but his socks. Before he had time to feel silly, a warm hand wrapped around his cock. Sherlock applied pressure, guiding John by his cock until his thighs pressed up against the bed.
Glad that he’d put on a vest under his jumper, John pulled the oatmeal jumper over his head and tossed it to Sherlock.
“Well, how do I look?” Sherlock asked ten minutes later as he stepped into the hall. John hadn’t gone far, managing to make it just past the bathroom door before he propped his shoulder against the wall to wait. (But mostly to shout abuse at Sherlock to hurry the fuck up.)
little to conceal his erection. “Is that answer enough for you?”
Sherlock bowed his head, regretfully allowing John to remove the collar and place it on the desk.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was just putting the last plate on the drying rack when Sherlock stepped out of his room. He was wearing his favorite pair of pyjamas and was just sticking his long arms into his blue dressing gown when John motioned towards the kettle.
“Let me be nearby, at least. I can’t let you face him completely alone. Wear an earpiece, and a GPS tracker, I’ll do the same. We’re a team, love. Let me help.”
“If we’re staying in,” John said huskily, reaching down to adjust himself through his pyjamas, “I’m going to shower. Wait here; I’ll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.”
“My case, inside pocket next to our toothbrushes,” Sherlock called out. He reached for his belt buckle and had his clothes off before John had made it to their cases. Quickly looking over the bedside table he found the remote to the AC unit and by the time John returned cool air was blowing over the bed.
to look at the pile of torn clothing that had been Sherlock’s outfit, John turned to his boyfriend.
Sherlock realized frustratedly. Just when Sherlock thought he’d reached his breaking point, as he was about to open his mouth and speak despite John’s warning, the door swung open. John stood on the other side, naked and glistening from his shower. He had one hand on his cock, which was already erect.
Sherlock clambered onto the bed and rolled onto his stomach. He watched John as he rounded the bed, heading for the bathroom door. He was pleased that they were staying indoors today. He wasn’t ready to face the world just yet, and it had nothing to do with the scarlet rope around his neck. His mind had been blessedly quiet since spotting John at Lotus the previous evening, and he wasn’t quite ready to welcome the chaos that greeted him every time he stepped outside.
as she blew her Nana one last kiss. When the grave was filled in, and they were the only three left aside from the ushers from the funeral home, John finally let the tears fall.
“Yeah, but…” Sherlock said, raising himself up on one elbow, “Can I flip over? I want to feel your hands dig into my hips while you plough me into the mattress.”
“Yeah…” John tried to take a step towards the car when his left leg buckled. He held a hand out to his side to adjust his balance and Zed caught it. “Ta,” John mumbled as he moved, with Zed’s help, to lean on the car. “I... it's just, god they got him. I mean I knew they would, but drugs weren’t part of our equations.”
“When your arms or shoulders get sore,” John continued as if he hadn’t heard Sherlock, “Drop the Captain and use Sir, and we’ll switch up the position.
“John,” Greg began in a warning tone, but one look at the other man showed Greg that John had no intention of changing his mind. “Be safe.” He said instead, then held his hands out to the young lady in front of him. “Ms. Kato, your mother has been worried about you.”
Sherlock swallowed hard, realizing that they were about to put into practice what they’d just discussed. Excitement jolted down his spine, and he had to bite back the demand that John hurry it up and get on with the sex already.
“Of course.” The husbands then took turns correcting each other as they gave descriptions. John wrote down the significant bits, like the scar on Otto’s left thigh and Theodore’s red birthmark on his neck.
“As am I, Greg.”
John managed to get a cup of tea into Sherlock, which they both drank in bed. The room was quiet, save for the soft slurping noises as they drank the still too hot liquid. After a few moments of silence, during which John forced himself
“Mycroft,” he snarled, dropping his feet to the floor and hunching over in resignation.
"Foreigners…" John chuckled at the driver then handed him a fifty-dollar bill. "That ought to pay for the therapy you require after driving us here. Sorry about that, mate, we're just newly married and a bit too happy about that."
Emotion threatened to overwhelm him as he read the tags once more. Sherlock could read the history of the man who had once worn them in those seemingly simple discs. They whispered stories to him of another man in another lifetime. In his mind’s eye, he could see John on the battlefield. Feet planted wide for balance, one foot slightly in front of the other while his eyes surveyed the chaos around him, searching for anyone who might be in aid of his medical expertise. It wouldn’t be his job to retrieve, but of course, he would because that’s what John did. He put himself in harm's way to protect others.
I need to drop a quick apology! If any of you have been following the Omega RP Accident and I have been posting, you'll see that the RP is written in the present tense. I keep slipping up and dropping presence tense in this fic. Every time I think I've caught each mistake, I find more. Grammarly usually does a good job of finding those mistakes, but it has failed me a few times.
"Decent enough, with a spotter." John shrugged, “We all had some training, but I could never get the angles and the wind-down.”
“Great, thanks.” John turned and faced the direction of the source of the reverberating music. Another narrow hall brought him out into the main fanfare. It was a large rectangular room with a stage at the far end. Back in the 1920’s Lotus had been a cocktail bar set in the basement of an old department building. It had been known for its entertainment and atmosphere. Now the stage was widely unused, save for Friday nights when Zed held karaoke night.
“Erm, no. Not if you want to be able to use this sink again.” John said, not at all in the mood for banter.
“Oh, right,” John said, shaking his head in confusion.
“Yeah,” John said and nodded briskly. “Thank you; we’d never have gotten together if you hadn’t called us idiots and told us just to kiss already.”
He found a vein in his left arm, then balled his hand into a fist. The leather band, declaring John's love bit into his flesh, but he ignored it. John didn't truly love him, if he did he'd be here helping him. Not off drinking, and quite possibly flirting with the nearest thing with a pulse.
“Yeah, well, I’m not done with you yet. I still have a day and a half with you. To enjoy this.” John released his grip on Sherlock's hair, using that hand to grip the other side of the doorframe. He stood there, blinking and dazed. Seeing but not comprehending the room in front of him.
"Without meeting the girls first, I can think of three other reasons why they might cut communications. Except, we know from Mrs. Kato's worry that Moon Young isn't simply avoiding friends." Sherlock sighed and brushed a hand through his hair. "Hurry up and get me to Lilianne's flat. Please."
“I was afraid you would like that, Locky. It’s just faux leather.” Jesper sighed but nodded his head in agreement.  “I have an idea for this Captain of yours. Give me two weeks, three if you want to wait for the rest of his wardrobe.”
“I’ve got you, my love,” John whispered, bending low to kiss Sherlock’s kneecap. “I’ve got you, always.”
“My submissive has already been told that he can only orgasm if he achieves subspace,” John explained to the crowd over the sounds of Sherlock moaning around his finger. “If anyone would like to help out, the rules are as follows. His cock is off-limits, you can touch his back, shoulders, and nipples. Gentle touches only, if I see anyone getting rough or handsy with him, Elvio will be showing you the door. His face and hair are completely off-limits as well. I want him to come from being fucked, and that alone. No more than three touching him at a time, so don’t hog the space.”
“I’m trusting him,” John repeated, “Thought if I ever cross paths with the cunt who hurt him, there will be a body to hide.”
“Sofa?” John suggested.
off.” Mycroft’s disembodied voice sighed from the far side of the vehicle. “You and I need to have a tête-à-tête, after which I will instruct the driver to drop you off at the location of your choosing.”
“Alight,” John said while placing a loaf of bread in the bread box. Half expecting Sherlock to ask about Mycroft, his shoulders nearly sagged in relief when Sherlock began speaking.
“I trust I don’t have to tell you that things have just become very difficult for my brother,” he began wearily. “Though he didn’t seek out this hit, his body doesn’t know that.”
“Absolutely never… Huh.” John pondered out loud as he changed into more comfortable clothing, “So, you wanted a secretary. Couldn’t Mycroft have helped?” On a whim, he picked up the shoebox that had once been under his bed, tucked it under his arm, and stepped out of the room.
“Promise,” John replied as he stole a kiss. “Can I take your collar off for a bit? Help you undress and get comfortable? I made tea.”
“Alright.” Sherlock shrugged, then reached a hand out to squeeze John’s knee. “Better than last time, I have him to help now.”
“Yeah sure,” John said. He missed three taxies while texting Sherlock the information.  As a fourth cab drives away he let out a frustrated groan and looked to Sherlock, about to demand
“Obedience tasks, please.” Sherlock decided after a moment. “Restraints are fine as well.”
“If this,” John said quietly, inches from his ear, cupping Sherlock’s cock in his palm again, “is out of my reach at any point for the rest of the day, you’d better hope you have permission. Today, you will begin learning that you are
"You've got that right." John gruffed out, slotting their noses together and leaning up on tiptoes for a kiss. "Let's go. You have the tracker?"
John's family's back story was of his own making. I had NO clue that would pour out of me. (Also, sadly cancer treatments CAN render a man sterile.)
“Oh, I plan on handling you later this evening,” John growled, watching Sherlock down the last of his whisky and place the glass heavily on the table.
After flicking the syringe to work out any air bubbles Sherlock sighed and brought the tip of the needle to his skin. He'd get the scissors after, and cut the leather band off. But for now, he wanted the release that only the cocaine brought. As the needle pierced his skin, he became aware of someone standing in the door. Expecting it to be John, he sighed and looked up.
helping him.”
"Two missing persons, actually," John spoke up, choosing to ignore Sherlock’s announcement. While he enjoyed Sherlock’s openness, this meeting wasn’t about them, and the sooner Greg was able to focus on the case, the better. No doubt, when the dust settled, Greg would be inviting him out to the pub, where he’d be thoroughly interrogated for any information on what it was like to date a Holmes.
"Mm, get some sleep, John," Sherlock said, lifting his head a fraction and distractedly kissing the air in the general direction of John's face. Though he missed his mark by a mile, John hummed appreciatively as he pulled away. He looked up and watched John as he retreated tiredly down the hall.
Silence, only broken by the heavy sounds of their breathing, wrapped around them as John bent down and pushed up the sleeve of Sherlock’s dressing gown. He delicately lifted Sherlock’s arm with both hands and pressed a row of kisses along Sherlock’s radiocarpal joint.
“Did these women have a pattern of attendance?” Sherlock asked, opening one eye and regarding Paige with a calculating gaze.
Sherlock turned to his mobile and tapped out a quick message. He grinned at John’s quick reply and allowed himself the brief indulgence of teasing his partner.
“John and I will head to the Yard,” Sherlock announced as soon as he’d finished adding Paige and Zed’s numbers to his phone. Sherlock paced the living room while John saw them out. When the squeak of the hall floorboard announced John’s return, he turned and grinned at him.
smaller than his. Even in its fully erect state. John knew that was childish of him, but it didn’t stop him from taking pleasure in it. He and John made eye contact as the man traced a line around the underside of Sherlock’s collar.
“What’s the plan once your brother gets back to us?” John asked once Sherlock had sat down beside him and stolen half his paper. Thankfully, the half that John had finished reading.
“What would you like, hmm? Would you like me to suck you off? Or do you want to feel my cock against yours, equally as exposed as yours?”
“You’ve now mentioned at least twice that your mouth has uses other than getting you into trouble,” John stated, taking one step forward, so he was standing between the doorframe.
Heads up! Trigger warnings apply to the end of this chapter!
“Sex makes me hungry,” Sherlock shrugged, his voice a low growl that matched the rumbling in his stomach.
With the same level of care and almost religious attention, John swapped out the red collar for the new one. It was half leather, half chain, with the chain attached at both ends by two O rings. It was a perfect compromise, in his opinion. He’d wanted to see Sherlock in a complete chain collar for this stage but understood that, from a sensory viewpoint, it wasn’t pleasant for everyone.
“Shh, trust me, love. There is a method to my madness,” John whispered as he unlocked the bracelet. With a soft brush of his lips against the underside of Sherlock’s wrist, he placed both bracelet and collar on the nightstand, then looked up into Sherlock’s eyes with what he hoped was a soft expression.
“I’ll be needing both your numbers, the address to your club, and several hours to reach my contact in the Met,” Sherlock stated as he walked over and stood in front of Paige, his tall frame towering over her sitting form. He stretched out his hand, shaking the woman’s hand, then was hurrying off in the direction of his coat.
a fast entrance, then hold it to the count of ten. Let me feel you stretching me open, then for god's sake, move like your life depends on it. If you come fast, that’s fine. No shame in that. Quick and dirty is just as much fun as slow and sensual.”
did was anything but casual.
“I’m already
He thought as John dragged a single finger across his body. From sternum to groin John's finger left gooseflesh in its wake
At first, John enjoyed the silence as it folded around them. It was familiar, mixed with Sherlock’s sounds humming a tune known only to him and the scents of his aftershave. However, the closer they got to home, the deeper it hit him what they were in the process of starting.
