Sherlock laid a calming hand on John's shoulder, "It is just human nature, John." To the man, he said, "My boyfriend happens to have served in the military a few years ago, so I do suggest you leave."
There was no reply. John rolled his eyes. What should he expect from his friend? He was deep in his mind castle or whatever it was called. He was going to have to drag him himself to the cupboard.
"I guess this is what we practised for," muttered John. He cupped his hand at the back of Sherlock's neck as they touched lips. This time John knew what to expect and he found himself being pulled deeper into the enchantment he was under.
"How are you so good?" John finally asked him.
Clara + I together again
"This is what is wrong with the world. We cannot celebrate a holy holiday anymore without a bunch of queers ruining it."
God, does this woman have my entire life story memorised? John thought.
The whole Holmes family went to a restaurant that night.
John nodded. His stomach began to do flip flops as waited with bated breath for Sherlock to lean down. John closed his eyes as Sherlock's smooth soft lips captured his own. The room seemed to heat up while time slowed down. John's hands itched, for some unknown reason to him, to pull his friend into a tighter embrace and to feel his hands wondering about his hips and back…
John and Sherlock took the time to go out for a brisk walk and it was icy enough that their breaths came out as visible puffs. There was a lone robin, hopping from branch to branch ahead of them and the hedges next to them were topped with snow. It had probably rained last night as there were puddles of glass-like ice dotted along the lane. They didn't pass anyone else on the way and it seems like they had the whole world to themselves. Sherlock wrapped his arm around John who relaxed into the touch. They turned onto a patch of grass and the frost crunched underfoot. The sound echoed into the air around them and Sherlock laughed with delight. John loved it when Sherlock laughed as it rarely happened. They returned to the house to find lunch nearly ready however there was just enough time to open the rest of the presents.
"Another Christmas tradition of ours is to go to a restaurant on 23rd December," Sherlock told John.
The next ten minutes was Sherlock guiding him through the throng of children and adults alike. They all were laughing and chattering in good humour, but to John, the world was silent. There were only him and his friend skating together side by side.
Sherlock gave Mycroft all the cameras he had collected from the flat over the last couple of years and some board games they both liked and John several jumpers and some DVDs he had asked for.
Mycroft continued working on his laptop throughout but became increasingly annoyed at the addition of Christmas songs. He grudgingly agreed to go to the party as long as they "turn that infernal music off. "
"Uh, thank you, Mrs Holmes. I would like that."
They did some last-minute shopping; the usual things like fighting villagers over the last bit of cranberry sauce, joining the rush to hid a present that was forgotten during the beginning of December, and refreshing themselves with a cup of hot chocolate down by the local café.
For the rest of the day, Mrs Holmes locked herself in the kitchen to make food for their Christmas Eve party.
Time ticked by before John decided to go to bed again. Unlike the night before, he wasn't completely exhausted so he took a proper look around the room. The main part was a bookcase and while the bottom few shelves were dedicated entirely to non-fiction books, the others had fossils and rocks and bones on, all clearly labelled with a name and date. To the left of it was a wooden desk with a few more books stacked neatly on the side but mainly with piles of papers covered in a neat scrawl. The wardrobe was barely visible through the number of posters it had stuck on it such as the periodic table, identifying birds, a labelled diagram of the human skeleton and lots of complicated formulae, though none, John noticed with a smile, was about space.
Because he was older but smaller, John was annoyed at her use of 'little brother' but got over it immediately because it was amazing news. He told Sherlock that what had happened.
"With a murderer?"
The door to the room was barely closed before John's lips found his way to Sherlock's. His hands were entangled in the messy curls of the detective's hair, and Sherlock's arms were crushing him in the strong embrace.
They skated together with the cold wind blustering in their faces for almost an hour. By the end of it, their feet were blocks of ice but the hands they held together were toasty and their faces were bright red. Whether it was from the cold or blushing, no one could tell.
"That'll be Myc," Mrs Holmes beamed. She opened the door to reveal that it was, indeed, Mycroft.
After a quick cup of tea, then moved to the lounge where the presents under the tree were. They each selected a gift with their name on it and took it in turns opening them. Mycroft gave Sherlock a new violin, Sherlock gave his parents a set of books, brainteasers and DIY manuals, Mr and Mrs Holmes gave John a new watch and John gave Mycroft a new umbrella. Next, they cleared up last night's mess and Mrs Holmes started on the roast.
Mrs Holmes tutted and sighed, "I do wish you would stop working every day, Myc. It's Christmas."
A hand rested on his shoulder. John turned his head to see Sherlock wordlessly gripping his arm to help him up.
Gotta cancel
After large amounts of jumping to get to it, John had to swallow his pride and ask for help.
It was nearly dark by the time they had returned home. The Christmas tree was twinkling merrily in the corner, casting off a warm glow. They had some sandwiches whilst talking a bit more about what was going on in their lives.
Sherlock mumbled to himself for almost two minutes with John being able to catch only the odd word here or there.
The next two days flashed by in moments: Christmas shopping in the icy wind. Hot chocolate by the fire. Watching some young children build a snowman. And every single brush of their hands. Every touch.
"It's Christmas," Sherlock announced gleefully and they both went to the kitchen to see everyone else.
"Just over 5 months," he replied.
John could hardly refuse and followed the young boy to a different room. There were lots of toys set out with six other children playing with them.
John entered first into the room and stood awkwardly at the foot of the bed. Sherlock, though, calmly entered the room and sat on the chair that faced the window.
My blog is PotterWhoLock but there is also Good Omens, Dan and Phil and lots of random thoughts and reblogs on there.
"Sher…" John began, but he was cut off by a shift kiss on the lips. He was then pulled upstairs, back into Sherlock's room.
"I love you too," Sherlock smiled as he rested his lips on top of John's forehead. "Let us go back before we are sorely missed."
"Mother, Father, John," he acknowledged, "and my little brother Sherlock."
John could feel his face flushing and, to avoid further embarrassment, hurriedly answered, "Sorry, I'm staying with Harry." He rushed to his room to continue reading his letters.
John reflected how different it was to his own family. His abusive, homophobic father. His meek mother. His alcoholic sister. Their Christmases consisted of beer cans littered across the floor, an anaemic tree if they were lucky to have one and lash to his back for a present.
When John reached Sherlock, he squeezed his hand to show that he was back and try to understand the conversation.
"Well, um, yes," John said, averting Sherlock's gaze. "I suppose I can now. I am more than happy to do it…I mean since you are my friend and all… not because…um, never mind. I am perfectly content to do this thing for you."
I'm just tired, he thought. Everything will be clearer in the morning.
He pulled back quickly as he realised his intrusive thoughts. Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
"John, love, would you like a mince pie?" Mrs Holmes said as she ushered the friends towards the couch. "I made them myself."
"Being my boyfriend. I assume you can join me."
John woke in the morning to find Sherlock sleeping next to him. He probably deserved the rest because as well as the five days that they have been here, he had no idea where Sherlock had last slept and as much as Sherlock tried to deny it, he was human. John took the time to properly look at Sherlock; he looked so much younger asleep. His curls were ruffled and his face relaxed instead of the tense look or frown he usually wore. John couldn't believe that this man, the world's only consulting detective and with a brain capable of understanding things that John could never even dream of liked him, a boring army doctor. Just then, Sherlock woke and his eyes lit up like a child's would.
The following day, he slept in until about 10 am and made his way downstairs to find a Full English Breakfast waiting for him. His hosts were all bundled up in their warmest clothes and huddled by the fire. Good mornings were exchanged and John sat down in front of the crispy bacon and eggs.
After that, they sat in the dining room to eat their meal. They pulled the crackers, told really bad jokes and even Mycroft put on the paper crown. There was roast beef with creamy and crispy roast potatoes, boiled peas and carrots, buttery Brussels sprouts and flavoursome gravy. Sherlock didn't participate in the conversation and John almost laughed when he caught Sherlock reading the casebook under the table. The conversation turned to John's life pre-Sherlock and he recounted his dull life of average grades, studying at St Bart's and then the army. When he talked about getting shot, he gripped Sherlock's hand but managed to finish his life story.
"You and John will be in your room, Sherlock, and Mycroft in yours. I have left them both as they were," Mrs Holmes told them. They nodded and thanked her before retiring upstairs.
"Myc!" Mrs Holmes went over to him and lightly slapped him on the arm. "We don't need your unnecessary comments now."
"Every Christmas when I was younger, our family would come here," explained Sherlock.
The house itself was a small two-storey house but was designed to be spacious inside. As John walked in, he was blasted with the heat from the fire; comforting smells of cooking wafted around his senses. It was probably one of the first Christmases that he had spent time in a cosy family environment.
It was the cold that drove him out of his clothes, it being more than enough to stunt any form or thought of an erection. Besides, it would only be fair, he had been watching John do dives and swim naked for the past fifteen minutes and it would just be rude at this point to continue in his dressed state.
That week had been a complete trial in his physical control. The trip to the lake doubly so. He had been so afraid of sporting a boner that he was almost willing to wait those bloody awful two hours shivering on the shore than go skinny-dipping with John.
Seeing Sherlock then strip himself of the ridiculously soaked pants and crisp shirt (not so crisp anymore since their emergency swim) until he was just in his pants was an interesting experience for John. He had seen many
it. But he still yearned to see the army doctor actually masturbate himself. God, just to see that strong arm flexed and pulling on his cock.
And so, after a quick dinner, a cleansing shower and a few parting words of goodnight that is how John ended up in the present moment.
“Oh I was just keeping vigilant on my surroundings, really John you don’t need to be a genius to pay attention to more than one thing at a time. Though, now that you say that, I take it that you failed to notice the rat you stepped on earlier…”
John tossed over for the fifth time. His arms were aching, his legs were aching, his back was aching but the thing that bothered him the most currently was his mind. Try as he might, John couldn’t divert his thoughts from what had happened that day.
on his knees sucking Sherlock. Or oh god, what if
Hesitating for only a second, Sherlock stuck his hand down his pants, he didn’t even have the mind to be ashamed of how desperate he was. All he could think of was the low grunts John was emitting and applying them to his dozens of fantasies.
But he was scared to move, scared to breathe. The army doctor would be on alert, his senses peaked and a single miscalculated move might mean Sherlock would get caught. If there was just a way to watch without the risk. A sudden grunt made Sherlock flush red from his face down to his crotch, he suddenly lost the ability to hear as blood rushed through his brain and rang in his ears. His heart stole two beats for each single one it was given and his cock hardened to a painful point.
He needed a fantasy, he wanted to get back to sleep but he also wanted to have a really good orgasm. He searched his memory for some lady that he dated, but found he couldn’t even remember their faces. The one thing that kept him hard was the brief picture in his mind of Sherlock’s face upon finishing the case.
Was it possible to have a wank without any thoughts? A simple, clinical process?
He should have known that as a writer, there was no such thing as a nondescript image in his mind’s eye. Instantly and without his permission, details came to him like moths to light.
His clothes hung on a tree branch to dry in the warm sun and for a moment he was transported back to his early training days in the army, before deployment. Those foolish scouting trips in which the men never really took it seriously until their CO would start yelling at them. The endless nights of laughter and jokes and dared skinny-dips into the mosquito-infested ponds. And then the bright days of hiking, marching, drilling, singing and general dicking around.
Of course, at the moment John had felt nothing but relief to be safe from those god-forsaken, heinous insects and gave no care in the world to the sorry state of his clothes. He and Sherlock swam quite a bit away to the opposite side of the shore, hoping to put as much distance between them and the little, murderous dipshits as possible.
naked men and although he did give their dick a once-over on occation, it was more of an instinct than an attraction.
Sherlock wanted to open the door, he wanted to see what John was doing. He knew what he was doing. He could
Oh god, how did Sherlock not even realize how sensuous and sinful he looked after a case? When his smile lit up a room and his eyes were bright like stars, cheeks flushed with adrenaline, and his lips were wet from his constant excited licks? John wanted to see Sherlock look like that every single night, he wanted to be the cause of that look. He wanted to taste that look. He wanted Sherlock’s practically orgasmic reaction to be due to him. He wanted to see that look painted on the marble sculpture that was Sherlock’s naked form.
Now he held his breath, he knew the sound of John’s bedside drawer like he knew the sound of each indiginous bird species in the UK. But he cared far more for the sound of that wooden squeak and subsequent plop of a heavy container on wood than he did for any squacks or chirps of birds.
Sherlock was well-endowed, not so much as John but a respectable length that was as lithe as the rest of his form. Sherlock waded into the water, wincing at the sudden cold and that is when John tore his gaze back into his head and dove down to distract himself.
Back in his bed, and he couldn’t get his mind off the illicit image of Sherlock’s nude form from his mind’s eye. John stubbornly refused to touch himself to thoughts of his flatmate, it just wasn’t proper etiquette to wank over the gorgeous body of your assumadly asexual flatmate without his consent. Granted, he couldn’t ever imagine
Finally, they managed to escape Greg’s lecture with a promise of being in the office sometime later that week. Once out of earshot, Sherlock hunched near John and whispered, “Mummy’s not all that pleased with us it seems.”
Sherlock had been magnificent (as usual) during the fight but there had been this single point in their long 3-mile hike not a day ago, where he was treated to seeing Sherlock completely naked. And it was that his mind refused to leave.
for permission to do so. That would go over marvelously, ‘Hey Sherlock, ever since our little skinny-dip I can’t stop thinking about your body. Is it alright if I picture you doing something very sexual to me, so I can have a good wank? Yeah? Thanks.’
? Then I figured it out. It wasn’t any of that. You could very easily have shown me. It wasn’t that you couldn’t, or that you didn’t trust me. It was that you didn’t want to, and after I reached that conclusion, I realised I didn’t even care.” Sherlock laughed, shaking his head at his own stupidity.
“You told me that you’d wanted to be a doctor. If I remember right, you were pissed that you couldn’t be a healer, and because Hogwarts doesn’t offer the usual muggle subjects you wouldn’t be able to be a doctor either. Well, that’s just a reminder that I think you’ll be a fantastic healer and I suppose it would be handy to have if you become a doctor anyway. People like sentimental things like that don’t they?”
“I appreciate the gesture. But I have to be there for him.”
height, that’s bound to raise suspicion.”
“You didn’t have to.” The smile in his voice was audible, and Mycroft closed his eyes, relaxing back into the chair, and squeezing Greg’s hand gently.
The shorter boy returned moments later with a plate. Judging by the slowness of his breathing he presumed Sherlock had, against his best motives, fallen asleep. He was passed out, long legs sprawled over the side of the bed, hands clasped over his stomach, soft, slow breaths leaving his lips. He looked elegant.
“Myc?” His voice came soft and broken, he didn’t move, but his eyes were open now, staring at the ceiling, hand still clasped comfortably, firmly in Mycroft’s.
“I thought I pissed you off.” John muttered after some time of just sitting there.
Christmas day came faster than expected.
“Why you’re unable to sleep.”
Sherlock followed suit, his hands trailing John’s waist as the shorter man stood on his toes to press a gentle kiss to his lips. John’s hand found Sherlock’s curls as he kissed him harder, Sherlock could only smile into it, knowing what it meant.
“Yeah, yeah.” She replied, ruffling his short dirty blonde hair. “Leave your only sister alone on Christmas.”
“And the cuddling?” John asked, turning his neck only to have Sherlocks curls tickle his nose. But he smiled anyway, pushing his face against it, pressing somewhat of a gentle kiss to the top of Sherlocks head.
Mycroft was seventeen, he was nearly an adult for Christ’s sake he could do practically anything his heart desired. Well Mycroft didn’t have a heart, just an empty cavity where one should be. Here was Sherlock some snot-nosed kid chasing after him, hoping he would answer his every beck and call.
“Not at all. I never saw the point, so I never learned.”
They left the greenhouse when the heat became unbearable, and Greg insisted they just walk about the grounds of the house as his legs had cramped from sitting still on the train.
John was exhausted by the time he reached his front door. Apparently the taxi price from kings-cross to his house had gone up since September, so the cab driver could only take him part of the way with the money he’d nicked from his dad the year prior.
words left his mouth he knew he’d been wrong to say them.
He’d skipped his tutoring, missed it maybe, to hang out with Sarah Sawyer. Sherlock wasn’t sure why, but that felt like betrayal of the highest calibre. He went out of his way to help John, help him with something he needed, something he’d never done for another person before in his life, and John had the audacity to stab him in the gut by replacing him.
Sherlock had never seen John go from zero to one hundred like this before, usually it built up over time, but this was immediate. “John please, just breathe, look at me, and breathe.” He removed his hands from John’s shoulders and took his hands instead, lowering down and tugging John to follow suit. “In and out, slow down.”
Well, the fact that he was magically inept helped his case as well. Nobody said it, but it was obvious that is what they were thinking.
John gripped the handle of his broom, if it weren’t for his gloves he could’ve seen just how white his knuckles were.
What he failed to grasp was that Mycroft was in control of the umbrella, until the prefect moved it from covering him.
Parents especially.
to talk to about it.
“Sure, you have a legacy in wizard’s chess to reclaim.”
John seemed to flick through a series of emotions all at once, going from surprised, to shocked, before concerned and then almost… Sad. “We still don’t have the money, Sherlock.” He replied, and Sherlock could hear the disappointment in his voice.
“I’d be honoured for you to. Let’s see if you can guess it right.”
“I know what that is. Well, sort of, I don’t know the exact phrase, but muggles have a different word for it anyway. Its when your body gets overridden by anxety-“
go well?”
Sherlock smirked, pushing harder, watching as John's face contorted into a gasp. The doctor put his hands over Sherlocks shoulders, pressing his head into the crease of his elbow, he was breathing heavily. "When have I ever?" The detective undid his belt with ease, sliding his hand down, and under Johns waistband. He couldn't be bothered trying to deal with the packer, because pulling it out of his boxers would be likely to make things awkward, or embarrass the doctor.
One goal an hour in, he let out a grumble of frustration at that one swearing at himself in his head, but that one was the end of it as the game ended moments later. It was one of the shortest ones he’d played, the new chaser for the Hufflepuff team wasn’t as good as theirs, and pretty soon he was landing for touch down, to celebrate with his team.
“You’re also good company, if that makes you feel any better.” Sherlock offered him a smirk, before looking back out the window
So, the close proximity of the lanky genius wasn’t the problem. It was just that Sherlock’s arm was in a precarious position. John’s chest was a no-go area, for multiple reasons.
Well, maybe not every day and night. It could be anywhere from one hour to twenty-four, sometimes even further than that. Despite the danger of wearing it for prolonged periods of time, John didn’t seem to care. And though it hurt his ribs, he never complained.
Sherlock knew exactly what to do, but John didn’t know that, so he nodded simply. “Got it.”
“What’re you planning to do once you leave Hogwarts?”
“Pretty good, introduced Myc to Dad, they got talking about science for a bit. Dad’s a teacher and Myc’s super interested in muggle stuff. You should have seen the look on his face when we got a cab back to Dad’s apartment. It was boring, but I was giddy for a week after that they got on well.”
Without spewing his guts onto the floor, he managed to make it to the wall, slamming his hand against it twice before drawing the circle against the stone with shaky hands, he could barely feel them now, and his gloves were stained with the blood from his nose. He tumbled into the tunnel and kept running, knowing that staying in the confine of the channel would do him just as much good as submerging himself in a crowd.
"Sherlock- I-"
Sherlock placed his own hand over John’s, watching as eyes trained to the tattoo that had stopped growing up Sherlock’s hand, a small smile on his lips. “I will call you Hamish for the rest of your life don’t test me.”
“My pacing?”
“Wow, somebody must love you mate, you got a girl back home then?” One of the other boys asked.
“No Father, you don’t understand-“ Greg got up quietly, pulling on a pair of boxers pulling on Mycroft's dressing gown as the cold air hit him and he shivered, unsure if it was just the cold or nerves. “You won’t- You can’t!” Greg opened the door, walking slowly. He felt bad for eavesdropping, but he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the letter he’d found.
John was still clueless, because of course he was. “Why’re you annoyed?”
Regaining his composition, he decided to snap back as he knew he probably should, considering the driver had practically insulted his boyfriend, intentional or not. “He has in fact, Afghanistan actually. Considering he got shot for your safety, it mightn’t kill you to offer him a bit of respect.” Sherlock replied quickly, his tone biting, and the driver quietened immediately. “Baker Street if you don’t mind.”
“A little, like a headache.”
“Is it possible for you to go a minute without being a smartass?”
of good and healthy habits, refused to let him wear his binder to bed, in any circumstance.
Anderson was his height, if a few millimetres taller. He liked to think himself a ladies man. He wasn’t all that attractive, his hair and his gait was ridiculous, and his tone of voice sent unpleasant shivers down the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“Parents thought it was a requirement for a gentleman. Like making a princess practice balance, they got me dance lessons.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Sherlock replied, his tone had dulled considerably, and John frowned.
“You’re a prick.” John laughed.
“I'm not wearing one.”
“It helps me think I guess. When the commotion is below me, I can focus. I’m lucky I can see well.” He’d laughed when Mycroft had asked him. The prefect smiled fondly at the memory, eyes still on Greg as he gaged the match.
“Sorry, my brother?”
“Sherlock, you know more than anyone that I’m in love with you. Nothing will change that. I’m going to learn more as- whatever
Clearly Sherlock was not.
Curse the universe that John for once in his imbecilic existence
“No, I’d just rather avoid your nagging.” He replied, opening the car door, gesturing for John to go first. The car was like a taxi, but somehow more sophisticated, Sherlock pulled the sliding glass cover over, so the driver could hear him. “Driver, home please.” He ordered. “If mother asks, the cigarette didn’t exist.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and pulled the jumper over his head and went after John. The Gryffindor was slipping down the corridors practically silent, toward a wall.
“Worked that one out did you?” Sherlock smiled, John Watson, always surprising him.
The Ravenclaw frowned at him, playing with his hands as he tried to form an answer, a lie, because whilst John was his only friend, he still wasn’t sure how John would react. “I don’t know, because I don’t. That’s like asking somebody why they don’t like onions, surely there’s a reason, but the reason shouldn’t matter.” A little defensive, but it wasn’t John’s place really to ask those types of questions.
“’Ello?” The voice of his sister was comforting on the other line. John was so grateful she was sober in this period of her life, he had no idea what he would have done if he didn’t have her now.
His father deemed that enough, and walked away to the kitchen, leaving his son shaking in the corridor, quivering with tears streaming down his face as he struggled to calm his breathing.
John could still feel his hand on his stomach, grounding him.
Mycroft was getting sick of it.
“I got hit in the face with a quaffle. And then I couldn’t breathe.”
“John.” He answered simply, moving his hand to cup the shorter man’s face, leaning down to press his lips against John’s, gently first, before John pushed back harder.
“Sherlock? You awake?” John asked quietly, Sherlock opened his eyes; he could just about see John’s figure in the dark.
“Gregory, can you hear me?” He asked, checking frantically for injuries, his hand swiped over the back of the Gryffindor’s head.
and it appeared he wasn’t going to ask the question so John continued. “I dunno, it seems like a room I could have. Not you. Like, I expected something mad, like a science lab.”
“Father will be pleased to hear it. The swank part, not the pornography.”
They found the Holmes’ and John at one of the pillars when they got to Platform 9 and ¾. Mycroft's parents gave them a courteous smile and a greeting, Sherlock gave a nod to his brother and John gave him a
He was sitting up now, elbows on his knees, twisting the ring around his finger.
“Why’ve you got your wellies on? It hasn’t been raining sweetheart. C’mere so I can do your hair.” He asked, taking a seat on the floor by her play dressing table, and grabbing a hair tie off it. He’d been practising for ages to learn how to do braids, Rosie had been begging him to do them for her ever since she’d seen another girl at school with twin plaits down her shoulders.
John nodded, keeping his gaze. “I won’t, I won’t, not unless you want me to, I should have asked first. I’ll ask from now on, yeah?”
“No- I- I don’t know.” He sighed out an irritated breath. “I don’t know
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes, taking his hand off his face and straightening his posture. “I can take it, honest.”
“You like it though, and you’re warm.” Sherlock spoke, pulling the doctor down by his jumper to kiss him properly. “Seeing as Rosamund is going out, I thought we’d stay in.” John smiled at that, always up for cuddling on the sofa, he pressed another kiss to the detectives lips.
John looked up at him, confused as to the need for him to break the quiet. It was late, and they were in Sherlocks tower, studying before lights out and John would have to rush back to the Gryffindor commons. If he got caught then he could say he got lost,
Mycroft sighed, breathing beginning to slow now he’d calmed down, he supposed Sherlock was
The house elves were in the kitchen, probably resting. Even if he wanted to run the risk of getting in trouble on his first day there, he didn’t know where the hell the kitchens were anyway.
“Sherlock, people with anxiety get panic-attacks, I don’t have anxiety, I
” John replied in shock dropping his boots, they hit the floor with a thud and John simply stared at them as they were tipped over on the floor.
When it was a quidditch practice that had gone horribly wrong. Mycroft was at the hospital bed to keep him company through the night, given that the remedy Madame Promfrey had given him caused a bit of pain.
Sherlock quirked up an eyebrow, so
He didn’t understand.
“Do you know what happened?”
“Your wedding ring.” Sherlock replied pointedly.
“And now I'm bored.” He spoke airily but swallowed thickly.
fine.” John replied, pushing himself up to kiss Sherlock again, not satisfied until the taller man relaxed into it, kissing him back.
Even Sherlock’s straight O’s for his summer exams were overshadowed by the glossy green Head Boy pin, sent through the post so Mycroft could outshine him one last time.
“Why?”
“Damn straight.”
Mycroft attempted to ignore the comment, feeling heat rush to his cheeks. “Yes, I
“Alright sure.”
“Indeed. The Queen of England gave it to me herself.” He replied, enjoying the eyeroll John gave him from behind his daughter’s view, and the exhilarated grin that now resided on Rosie’s features.
“The ducks. Rosie, what did you feed the ducks?”
“Yes of course I do, thank you.” Sherlock replied, swiping the paper from her hand and sprinting down the hall.
After enough staring at the door, Mycroft sunk to the floor and placed his head in his hands. Even though he knew there wasn’t anything he could have done it still swirled in his mind that he
“I wasn’t-“
“My dad does, he’s always just too pissed to remember. But this isn’t from him, or Harry for that matter.” John muttered, examining the package that had been dropped on his lap by one of the school owls, he didn’t have one of his own.
The doors to the commons burst open, Professor Snape with Professor Flitwick in tow, looks of urgency written clear as day on their faces.. “Mr. Holmes, you must come quickly, it’s your brother.”
“Thank you. Can I kiss your cheek?”
“You don’t honestly believe her, do you?”
He could still remember the squeal of joy and the kiss on the cheek she’d given him as a thank you for it. And he certainly remembered the span of three weeks in which it was the only cup she’d drink out of.
Besides, websites like that were a cesspool for date-rape. Considering his slender disposition and fairly attractive features, he couldn’t risk it, and he didn’t want to go through disappointment after disappointment either.
Sherlock kissed him, hard, curling his fingers inside John pushing against the soft spot that made John moan into his mouth, melting against him.
Mycroft walked into the Gryffindor commons, he seemed to spend more conscious time in there than his own houses common room. Greg was sitting in his usual spot at the table, shuffling cards, an anxious habit he seemed to have. He glanced up noticing Mycroft’s presence as he sat down, a small smile lighting up his features. He liked that the Gryffindor’s mood seemed to lighten when he was around, for most other people the opposite was true. But yet either a smile or a wave or a small nod was given by Greg, even when simply passing one another in the halls.
“John, are you alright?” Sherlock asked, before opening the door.
“It’s Greg.”
“That’s a change. I mean what are we to each other? Boyfriends? Friends with benefits?” He cringed at that, saying it seemed to leave a sour taste in his mouth. “Because I'm sure that flatmates-that-make-out-in-the-kitchen isn’t a sufficient label.”
“Why not?” John asked, clearly before he’d thought, as his face tinted red the moment the words left his mouth.
Then it came for John to take his shirt off, leaving him in his boxers and the blinding white fabric that compressed his chest flat, a stark contrast to his tan skin.
John visited for the summer, just like he had done the year before. Sherlock was glad to have him, considering things at home had been going just as well as he’d expected, Mycroft had moved out, he was living in London, with a job at the ministry curtesy of their father. He visited a lot, mostly to check up on his greenhouse and to have dinner considering he was useless at cooking himself.
A look of guilt crossed her face, and she tucked her curled hair behind her ear. “I was going to replace it, I just need to save up the money, don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
Sherlock’s hands found the small of John’s back, pulling him closer against him, and John talked his fingers in Sherlock’s hair, keeping him close.
“I do.” Sherlock grinned. “Wayne Buttery cheats on his wife every Wednesday with the choir instructor in the staffroom after lunch. You can always tell because he’s never able to redo his tie the same way. It’s a wonder she hasn’t noticed yet considering she also works here. It’s remarkable how blind people can be. A few simple deductions on her part and she’d be so much happier.”
“Why?”
“Greg got the password off Mycroft for me.” John spoke, like it was supposed to be obvious. Sherlock supposed maybe it was obvious and he wasn’t working at his highest calibre.
John just needed to slow down, take a break, and as much as he hated to, he needed to talk.
“Why?”
notice him. “Sherlock! C’mere!” He called, and reluctantly, Sherlock turned around, so not to cause a scene, so not to embarrass the traitor, walking over to the couple and trying desperately hard to keep his boiling annoyance off his features. “Sherlock, this is Sarah, you know her right?”
The Slytherin placed a hand on Greg’s cheek, something he’d found would instantly soften Greg to the point of compromise but he disliked manipulating his boyfriend so he only did it when necessary. “No need to be defensive. It was a statement, you have no reason to be.” He pulled Greg in to a short kiss and took his umbrella in the process. Greg pulled away with an eyeroll and began heading for the door.
“Funny.” John muttered, turning his head to Sherlock a last time. The brunette was staring at his hands, body tensed and eyes in the same vacant expression they’d been in when the hat was on his head. It’s like he wasn’t there, asleep or off in another world, he didn’t even flinch when the applause went up for the next person.
“Mate, it’s alright, I didn’t mean to impose.”
“So, what do you think?” Mycroft asked, he was somewhat nervous, given that this was Greg’s first impression of an entirely magic household. From what he knew, the Gryffindor didn’t see much of his mother, so their house was relatively free from magic, except for some photographs and post-cards.
Truth be told he was searching for his closer acquaintances to see if they had a spare space in their carriage, though he was partially checking to see if his little brother was wreaking havoc yet.
He didn’t expect it though, so much so that he froze up when it happened.
“Or maybe you just hate taking compliments.”
“No- John-“ Sherlock stammered over himself, before placing a hand over his eyes. “The watch is wonderful, genuinely, but you could’ve bloody hurt yourself!”
He didn’t know what he had done.
“Yeah…”
“A protest.” The Ravenclaw replied simply, opening his eyes and looking up at John with a frown, he didn’t understand why this didn’t make sense to him. If they put him in enough harm’s way they had to get him out, and him putting himself in harm’s way as a result of their punishment was their fault. So, if he got it to escalate enough then maybe he had a chance.
It was a replacement wasn’t it?
“It’s going to be okay, Myc.” Greg spoke gently, Mycroft didn’t look at him instead choosing to stare at the stone floor.
“Christ, remind me to get you a more difficult one next time.” John laughed, as he looked at the now solved Rubik’s cube Sherlock was tossing between his hands, slightly agitated from being stuck in the car for so long.
He refused to let go. He ran with them to the hospital wing, still holding Greg’s hand as he lay in the stretcher. They’d since put him to sleep, but the words
“Spoken like a true Gryffindor.” Sherlock’s mother, Lydia, replied with a proud smile and both Mycroft and Sherlock rolled their eyes, John supposed snark ran in the family as well as deductions. Despite his knowledge of the two being brothers, he’d never actually seen them side by side. Well exempt from the train station at the beginning of last year.
“But-“
“Boys! Dessert is being served!” Mrs Hudson called up to them, breaking that moment of serenity.
As far as anybody was concerned, they didn’t exist.
He hated what John did to him somehow adoring it at the same time. The thoughts he put in his head. How excitingly human he made him.
why he dated her. She fucking took two years of his life from him, just to make him love her!” The frustration rose in his voice, the more he talked about it. The anger was now uncorked and flowing through his words
“Okay.” Again, he picked apart the wrapping carefully, and John watched intently as he did so. Inside was a blue notebook, written on the front was a title of sorts. “Everything you need to know about the muggle world, a guide, by John Watson.” He smiled as he read it aloud, flipping it open to the first page.
Eventually he got the knitting charm down, after much trial and error. Mostly error.
Turning his back again to put his binder
“Then you’ll remember a crucial point regarding your feelings before you cried yourself to sleep.”
He still watched all the quidditch matches but stayed out of view so he didn’t put Greg off when he was playing.
Declaring that was probably a mistake. As it turned out, flying was not only the one thing Sherlock couldn’t do, it was also the one thing he was horrendously bad at.
“I believe my brother is…” He paused struggling to find the words, as he placed the ace of hearts, much to Greg’s chagrin. “
He had expected Sherlock to know, John however, he did not foresee.
“You did well.” Sherlock remarked.
He doubted anyone would notice.
“I’d prefer you didn’t get absolutely plastered, you are working tomorrow, remember.”
“Clearly.”
The seeker nodded, eyebrows furrowed in thought. “Well uhm, if you want, I do extra practice on Thursdays. I’ll drag you down from the commons if I have to.”
name!”
Despite the fact that John now slept, dressed and had sex with Sherlock, in Sherlock’s bedroom, that they now shared. Sherlock had never seen John’s chest.
until dinner.”
But in the end he hit the same roadblock. This was Rosie’s teacher, and he’d been very insistent ever since that one fling in Uni, that he was one hundred per cent heterosexual. Maybe that was a lie to himself more than anything.
His hair had gone greyer over the summer, the messy tufts salt and pepper on his head. Mycroft found it cute, well, he thought it
The police trainee tilted his head to the side so his words would be audible, but he didn’t lift it from the table. “How’d you figure that then?”
ENJOY!
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock.” John replied.
“Nope.”
Madame Promfrey looked at him like he was insane. “Mycroft is fine, his boyfriend isn’t.”
Christmas was quickly approaching, knowing Sherlock, he wouldn’t go home much to Mummy and Father’s distress. John Watson was a muggle-born, clearly of an unwelcoming household, so it was unlikely he would be returning home on the holidays either.
In Sherlocks first run-in with him, he’d made the deduction that he was cheating on his girlfriend with Sally Donavan. Now he and Donavan were dating, he still managed to find another girl to satisfy himself.
“No.” John replied quickly, too quickly.
“Gregory, you’ve been my friend for two years, you should know I won’t be going. Besides, mother and father are insistent I come home since Sherlock refuses to.”
Then John
your place.” Greg replied coldly, despite his body being filled with fire, he noticed the kettle had switched on and the hob was glowing red as his anger grew out of hand. “I’m going out.” He replied, storming don the corridor to grab his coat.
John stood up, laughing, bitterly, funning a hand through his hair, and licking his lips. “No, you aren’t, you’ll want an answer at some point, you’re willing to put your life on the line to get an answer so don’t try me with that bullshit.”
Sherlock knew from the moment they met.
Sherlock had gone home to get away from confinement for a bit, John had told him he should but the Gryffindor was pretty sure Mycroft forced him anyway, though his letters to John made it seem like home was just as big a prison. John knew that not to be true, Sherlock was just one for theatrics, and he told him as such in his letters (the Ravenclaw did not appreciate being called a drama queen).
there.” He continued, and Mycroft shook his head.
He bit his lip and made an attempt to change the subject. “Are you going to visit this summer? I think mother will combust if she doesn’t get to meet you for the second year in a row.”
“Oh, Johnny what has he done to you?” She sighed, gripping the steering wheel and leaning back in her chair, with her eyes squeezed shut. She had her dark hair pulled back into a bun, it frizzed out at the sides of her head in little wisps. She wore circle glasses and a grey cardigan over an obvious pyjama top.
Ravenclaw won the house cup, with a lot of help from Sherlock, though that wasn’t really a shocking revelation. He’d been doing well in classes, and one particular event, in which he’d calmed the growth of a particularly dangerous plant in the greenhouse, had given him one hundred points on the spot.
“Maybe I did, what are you going to do about it?”
After he set the pen down he glanced up at John, eyes tracing down over his body before he clasped his hands in front of himself. “Sherlock Holmes, and you are Dr Watson I presume?”
“Okay just gimme one second. I’ll be right behind you.” He replied, running up the stairs to the sleeping quarters, and rifling through his battered old messenger bag.
The pulse was there, steady, and he was breathing.
“The cliché answer is because I love you. Whilst that’s true, that isn’t the full extent of the answer.” John looked at him intently, and he took it as a sign to continue. “When the issue first arose, I didn’t understand. I viewed it as a waiting game:
“Alright then, we have a clever one, do we? Let me be clear that there will not ever be a tolerated ridicule of another pupil in this class. The only bad word spread, should be from
to get under his skin. “And you’ve also been told not to be in here without my supervision.”
Mycroft looked up, his interest gained now, as he watched his little brother walk to the front of the hall. He was taller than most of the others in his year, skinnier too. His darker curls and nose drastically different, now brought attention to Mycroft.
“I-I don’t-“ He inhaled sharply, his shoulders hunched as he leaned into the bar, still staring into his mug like it was the most interesting thing. “I don’t know.”
He dropped his gaze before he was caught, and instead went to staring at his hands, cracking his knuckles as a distraction from everything else. The noise. The
“Yeah, oh, shit sorry. John Watson. Christ I hadn’t even introduced myself and you invited me in, I'm so sorry.” John laughed, embarrassed, rubbing a hand over his face.
“Breathing John. Steady.” Greg noted, squeezing his shoulder before dropping his hand.
“That’s a stretch and you know it.” Greg replied unamused and John rolled his eyes.
“Because you’re my best friend and I wanted to give you something that wasn’t stupid. I care about you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock knew that was a lie, John had been with him on a date and he caught sight of an absolute sleazy bastard trying to drug a girl at the bar. Sherlock wanted to resist it, but John caught it as well, so they made a ruckus and began the chase when the reprobate tried to run.
but it would’ve been too mean to say out loud, he was sure his tone put the message across anyway.
Unsure of what else to do, Sherlock simply lay beside him, flat on his back, his hands clasped over his midriff. The shorter boy didn’t acknowledge him in the slightest.
It wasn’t until Greg pulled him aside after quidditch practice that he realised something was wrong.
"Do you want to fuck me? Or will I blow you?" John smirked, seizing control, and surprisingly Sherlock didn't protest. He ran his hands over Sherlock's back, down over his ass, as he tried to steady himself.
“I kinda just had to jump for it, hurt my wrist pretty badly but Myc fixed it in no time.” Greg spoke he was standing somewhat awkwardly in their kitchen, hands shoved into the pockets of his shorts. “You’d need to ask John about the fall though, that one was all his glory, poor bugger dislocated his shoulder.”
“Sherlock.” John laughed. “Do you know who you’re talking to? I’m not exactly made of money, never have been.”
The Gryffindor greeted him with a nod and a smile and went back to reading the book on the table. He had his elbows propped up the table and was resting his face in his hands as he read, brow furrowed in concentration. His notes had been cast aside, the quill Sherlock’s parents had gotten him set carefully atop the pages, John’s notes had become a lot neater and confident since he’d received the gift. There was an envelope peeking out from under the book that was a ghastly shade of pink, and a mug sitting on the table where Sherlock sat.
“John?” A voice came muffled, and he could only offer an unintelligible grunt in response, squeezing his eyes shut tight before he attempted to open. “John!” The voice came clearer this time, it was Sherlock.
“And you complain about me being boring, come on.”
Sherlock had asked him to come to his house for Christmas, knowing that John would say yes, desperate to escape his shabby, unwelcoming household.
you be
Sherlock didn’t reply, choosing instead to make an indignant noise in the back of his throat and walk over to John, kneeling as he took the needle gently from him. His hands were steady as his fingers hooked the end of the needle, his thumb on the plunger, with the size of his hands he only needed to use one. Despite being embarrassed. John resisted a laugh as he took in the scenario. A lot of people would pay good money to be in this position with Sherlock Holmes on his knees in front of them.
“What?” He asked simply, his eyes dilated slightly every time he looked up at the younger boy. He’d noticed that after a while of staying with him in the summer, they stopped doing that when he talked about Sarah. It was one of the dead giveaways about the Amortentia.
Dessert was considerably less awkward.
“Years, two years of my life from me- I know.” John cut him off, clearly he’d already had that thought. “I feel so dizzy all the time, unsure of what I said or did or how it effected all my choices. I'm scared, fucking terrified, because I remember it all, but I can’t tell.”
changed him. All good changes, he was assured.
John looked surprised, doing a full turn to take in his surroundings. It was an empty room, not big enough to echo dramatically, but enough to feel lonely without another person. In the middle was a mirror, a few metres away from where John stood.
“Look whatever murderer you’re texting can wait! I need your help!” He called, some of his anger seeping into his words and he cursed himself further.
“I’ve gone mad.” John spoke when they finally pulled away from one another. “God- Sherlock- I-“ He stammered over himself, trying to look anywhere but Sherlock. “Where does this leave us then?” He asked finally.
“I got hit in the face with a quaffle and then I couldn’t breathe.” John muttered, it sounded ridiculous, but it was in truth what had happened, he was slightly embarrassed by it too.
And so life went on smoothly.
Greg gave an overexaggerated gasp. “Scandal. Mycroft Holmes with a dirty mind?
They’d got the books and John managed to stare at the newest broom model for a good five minutes before Greg dragged him away to do something productive.
It hadn't quite set in yet that he’d be going home and possibly never coming back (unless Sherlock did something immensely awful. Considering the route he was currently taking that didn’t seem completely implausible). Father had set him up with an internship at the ministry, if he played his cards right, in a years’ time he could be permanent and four positions up.
All too quickly his body fell forward into John’s with a strange amount of elegance John didn’t understand how he had given the circumstances. The Gryffindor managed to manoeuvre Sherlock’s lanky frame, without getting tangled in the lead of his headphones, so his head was in John’s lap, and John’s back was against the wall. If he fell asleep then he wouldn’t fall forward or back, and if Sherlock woke he’d be easily found.
Mycroft wasn’t sure why he was so surprised, he knew from the beginning in the field that Greg would be fine. Well, that’s what he’d tell the Gryffindor, he wasn’t fully aware that Greg would make a full recovery until Madame Promfrey had reassured him that.
“So, maybe it’s best you let your parents know.” Greg added again, tentatively.
“What’ve
glad I learned this now, and not years ago when I was actually still looking. Of course I already knew that, you idiot.”
Greg found it strange. He was there to grab some paperwork that should have been posted to Mycroft so he could give it to them when they met for lunch.
“Now that’s just forced!"
“I was late, I might have gotten lost in my Mind Palace for a bit.” He laughed awkwardly. “I’m sorry if it upset you.”
Sherlock set a mug of tea on John’s bedside table. “Green one today, you’ll be wearing your dark jacket for most of the day anyway.”
“I’ve taught you well then.”
“I warned you not to get your hopes up, brother mine. We were cursed.”
“I think I'm gonna break up with her.” He said, still a bit uneasy at the idea, unsure of the repercussions.
Sherlock stood up, walking to his desk, pulling one of his drawers open, and pulling the fake bottom drawer out of it, and pulling a neatly wrapped parcel out from it, setting the fake bottom of the drawer on his desk, before walking back over to John, dropping the parcel in his lap before taking his seat opposite him. He drew his knees up, watching John as he looked at it.
“Okay, calm down, I didn’t mean to pry.” He bit his lip for a minute, before turning the book around for Sherlock to read, despite the fact the Ravenclaw had already read it from where he’d been sitting. “I don’t get this bit, give us a hand.”
John shifted a little bit with the motions, but he didn’t complain, he knew Sherlock liked the soft fabric under his fingers.
Then it hit him.
Sarah looked appalled. “You can’t honestly be saying that you’re going to do it? That’s
John turned to Stamford, who was sitting beside him, casting one last glance to the first year before speaking. “D’you reckon his name is
Mycroft had met him at the station, and then their driver brought them home. Because of course they had a driver.
John rolled his eyes, as if Sherlock
“Gross.”
He was just waiting the inevitable.
“To sleep I’d imagine. You’re in pain, we’ll resolve it when the painkillers kick in.” Sherlock replied, taking Johns mug from his hands, which had now stopped shaking. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder, letting his fingers linger before leaving quietly, shutting the door behind him.
John glanced down at Sherlocks crotch, seeing the fabric of his trousers strained against his erection. "Can I reciprocate?"
Sherlock glanced up at that.
“I’ll be there in a sec, Mycroft wants me for something.”
“Mr. Holmes you must go back to the commons.” Madame Promfrey ordered, as he sat in one of the uncomfortable chairs beside Greg’s bed in the wing. His fingers were still laced between the Gryffindor’s even though his hand was limp, and every time Mycroft acknowledged that fact it made his stomach twist with anxiety. He just needed Greg to wake up and squeeze his hand back, like he did when Mycroft said or did something nice, or he’d made him laugh.
“Boss, you alright?” Anthea’s voice came from the bottom of the stairs that led to the girl’s dormitories.
“Yeah, doctors orders.”
Sherlock twirled his quill around in idle boredom. He’d finished the work that needed written, and for an unexplained reason, John wasn’t present in class.
"My b-bed- it's bigger." John felt the arousal pool in his stomach again, seeing Sherlock reduced to a stuttering mess,
sticking in his head?
“Not in the slightest.”
“What if he wasn’t with you, what if he got one of his mates, a metamorphagus or something, to sit with you while he went and did it?” John froze at her words, how had they both been so stupid? Surely Sherlock would’ve worked it out the moment the situation arose. Somebody must have changed themselves to look like him, metamorphagus, Polyjuice, it didn’t matter, it was plausible. “John?”
Greg didn’t say anything, and instead chose to watch Mycroft as he worked, trying he focus on the gentle caress of nimble fingers over his arm, rather than the dull pain that ached from his wrist.  He moved his fingers when asked, turning his hand as far as possible without the sharp pain crying up his arm, trying not to grimace as the Slytherin gently prodded at his wrist.
“Heartbeat?”
He didn’t have the best broom in the world, but it was decent. That didn’t matter in the slightest when he was such a good player.
John went a brilliant shade of red and turned around to grab his broom from the forest floor where it had fallen. “Sun’s coming up. I’ll walk you back to the commons.” He muttered making the same motions as before against the trunk of a thick tree. “Same time next week?” He didn’t turn round but tilted his head to the side Sherlock was at behind him.
“Aren’t you going to be annoyed if we win tomorrow?” John asked, after again, a considerable amount of silence.
“People brought you presents.” The Slytherin spoke to change the subject to something lighter.
“Denying you participated.”
He was pacing, holding his phone up to his ear, he was shaking his hand out of nervousness, unable to jitter his knee standing up, one of his other nervous habits. It was clear he was in distress and Greg got the feeling in the pit of his stomach that it definitely had something to do with the letter.
Sherlock placed a gentle hand on John’s shoulder. “I know.”
Sherlock didn’t move, didn’t turn, just continued to stare at his ceiling. “What, John?”
Instead John nodded, offeing  SMOLE“And what does Sherlock think of it? He’s made no comment to me.”
“Whose knickers are twisted, bud?” John asked as he walked through the door, smiling as Sherlock pressed a kiss to his cheek, before pulling the doctor’s phone from his pocket, at this point John had given up any protest to that. “You look lovely darling, date tonight?”
“Anything?” John asked, handing sherlock his bag and his books, shouldering his own, keeping the stethoscope around his neck, like he’d forgotten it was there.
“Precisely why I haven’t told them. I’m not an idiot Gregory.”
His brother’s name was written on the back of his neck. Which birthed the habit of wearing collared shirts all the time, the suits followed shortly after.
“Thank you.”
“It may be unpleasant for you to hear.”
“Yeah, I just feel guilty y’know? She isn’t even a bad person I just don’t… I don’t like her anymore.” He replied, trying to justify it to himself more than anyone else, Greg clearly seemed to realise it,
“You are being a child, Gregory. Honestly. You should know it was a fake smile, the laugh too, if you listened to my tone of voice you’d hear the disinterest. But I think you’d rather sit in than get kicked out for me acting like usual.” Mycroft replied, pinching the bridge of his nose in annoyance. “Why are you so bothered by this?”
They had settled down when a car drove up outside. John noticed Sherlock's clenched teeth and taut body. His hand that rested on John's knee squeezed unconsciously. It only meant one thing…
"Ah, um, thank you," John said as he shuffled to the bathroom. He changed from his itchy jumper into his pyjamas before he slipped into the soft covers of the double bed. It was a bit disconcerting, at first, with Sherlock in the room, but he was off in his mind palace. It wasn't long before John fell asleep to Sherlock's soft breathing.
That evening, as they were watching a murder mystery and Sherlock was making his usual deductions, John became very aware that his knee was brushing Sherlock's. He turned his head to look at Sherlock's profile. Sherlock's thick, black curls were messy but in quite a cute way.
"I'm not gay," John said quickly. "I'm doing this as a favour because we are friends."
While Mrs Holmes berated Mycroft, John found his hand being interlocked with Sherlock's.

"Yes. So, at midnight, John and I were there, talking to Moriarty, "
The next few hours passed in a blur of fun jobs and sampling Mrs Holmes' recipes.
John was shaking in rage but stopped immediately when Sherlock embraced him. He calmed him down with his soothing voice. John ate a bit more before rejoining the party. It was five to nine so there were only close friends of the family left.
Yes, that was right. All because of this warmth
Partway through the day, Sherlock and John found themselves under the mistletoe again. He could feel the heat of the Holmes' gaze, waiting in anticipation for the inevitable kiss.
John felt his body tighten. He turned to the man and said:
"Sherlock, look at me," John said as he cupped the detective's cheek, "I love you for the man you are; your incredible mind, not because of sex," assured John before realising what he had said.
He touched the curling corners of the fragile paper and wondered what a teenage Sherlock would spend each hour of his day doing. One moment he would pour over a book about the psychology of the human mind, while the next minute he would end up writing a thesis about the effects of different types of tobacco.
Mr and Mrs Holmes gave Sherlock a subscription from a science magazine he had liked and Mycroft a tin of biscuits and chocolate.
John had barely put his other foot onto the ice before he slipped down, face first, onto the rink. A sharp pain bloomed from the bridge of his nose through to his temples.
Sherlock immediately started playing 'Jingle Bells' on his violin to annoy his elder brother. John began to chuckle at the antics of the two brothers but stopped when their mother glared at the couple.

John took a step back but Sherlock stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. His hand was warm and soft, John noted.
Next was a beautifully-decorated Christmas cake that tasted even better. The raisins were succulent and there was a perfect ratio of icing to cake.
All too soon, they were in the back of a cab and on their way to see Sherlock's family. They both held hands as they walked up to the house. The heat of the hands seemed to warm up the rest of John's body, including his face as they rung the front door.
He turned around and began to walk towards the bathroom. He could not help the smile tugging at the corner of his lips. Sherlock told himself that it was a smile of relief, yet his fluttering stomach hinted at something different.
"Yes," Sherlock said before leaning into a deep kiss again.
No! He thought. No! Sherlock is not cute! He is just looking more dishevelled than usual.
John slipped himself between the warm sheets of Sherlock's bed. It didn't take him long before his eyes drooped and sunk into a deep sleep.
The doctor nodded and scuttled back into his room. He could still feel his lips tingling from the kiss; the thought of it made his stomach swirl.
Even though they weren't proper boyfriends, John hoped he had found a new family in the Holmes'.
"You do," both Sherlock and Mycroft agreed, turning to scowl at each other for 'stealing' their line. Sherlock dug his nails into his palm. He could honestly not express the amount of aversion he had to his older brother, even if he wanted to.
"I don't need to sleep. You have the bed," Sherlock said.
"It's been so long since all the family's been back together," Mrs Holmes joyfully exclaimed as she swept the normally cold Mycroft into an enveloping hug. "It's been nearly 3 years if I remember correctly."

John had a red jumper that one of his patients had brought him years before. It was not only red but covered in bottle green trees that stood out starkly against the dun brown of the reindeer's coat. The only problem was that it was hidden right at the back of his wardrobe on the top shelf.
Sherlock and John arrived back at the house and watched a few Christmas films together. Dinner was a tasty lasagne and, afterwards, the roaring log fire was back on again. They exchanged stories of what had happened that day except for Mycroft who had "had important, top-secret government work."
The next morning, they woke up bright and early. Each one wrapped themselves up in scarves, hats and coats to go for a walk in the snow. It was bitterly cold and John's face felt raw by the end of it but it was a great chance to explore the village. What amazed him the most was the festive lights that decorated the large tree within the centre of the village.
"No...my fault...I told...shouldn't have...can't...unfair..."
John was introduced to Sherlock's childhood best (and only) friend and although it was a bit awkward at first, they got on pretty well by the end of it. All too soon, the guests left and John felt the familiar sense of after-party tiredness. After promising to help clear up in the morning (he was so tired that he forgot it was Christmas the next day!), he stumbled into bed and fell asleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're going to have to do this at my parent's house anyway so we may as well practice now. It will seem more authentic."
They entered the restaurant and although it looked small from the outside, the interior was bright and large. There was a wood-burning oven in one corner and the furniture was mainly polished wood with a few red covers. There was an ample choice on the menu so everyone tried different dishes, suited to their taste. The pizzas were large and very filling. When the desserts menu came around, they decided to probably act like a couple and ordered a cheesecake to share.
"Sherlock!" He called out. "Sherlock, I need some help!"
"So, how long have you been together?" Mrs Holmes asked as she handed John a china cup of tea. She settled down on the couch opposite them and stared with interest.
At 3 pm, they put the Queen's speech on and John had to stop himself standing to attention like the Beefeaters on the TV were! The Queen talked about how another year has passed and John thought back to this time last year. There has been a party in 221B with Molly and Lestrade and Mrs Hudson and John hasn't even realised his feelings for Sherlock. Before he knew it, John had daydreamed away the whole speech and a Christmas film has been put on. He leaned into Sherlock who wrapped an arm around him and with a dark, warm room and a full stomach, he fell asleep. He was safe and happy with Sherlock.
"I'm trying to work," called Mycroft out in disgust.
They moved to the kitchen and John couldn't help but eat a nearby cookie. He offered the plate to Sherlock who shook his head because eating was a basic human function that was beneath him.
He bumped right into Sherlock.
"Of course he can skate!" John mumbled to himself as he tentatively put one foot onto the ice. "Why shouldn't the great Sherlock Holmes skate?"
"Boyfriend," he smiled. They kissed until the door opened and an angry-looking man came in.
The chat continued until, at almost 11, John yawned and realised he was very tired.
A couple of days later, John received a text which both terrified him and made him feel ecstatic:
“What?” Greg replied, calmly, trying to avoid getting John worked up, but considering the boy currently had his face planted against the bar, he doubted that would be an issue.
John was trans, the premade suits never fit him quite right.
“Okay, Gavin.” Sherlock tied his scarf, walking out of the library with the charms book under his arm, and a pleased grin barely hidden in his features.
That wasn’t until the case ended and he woke up with Sherlock clinging to him like his body warmth was a life source. He lay on his stomach, face buried in his pillow in such a way that John couldn’t fathom how he managed to breathe, his naked torso pressed against John’s own through his t-shirt and he was breathing slowly, content.
clever.” He was concerned at this point, did Mycroft know what was going on? Was he keeping it to himself?
“We’ll keep you notified of when she wakes.” She cleared her throat and nodded at them. “You are free to go.”
that John Watson would save you?”
Sherlock laughed at that. “I could but QI is on later, I was going to do the experiment in the ad breaks.” He replied, looking up, and handing the doctor his phone back.
“Y-Yes…”
Sherlock could imagine how nice he looked in them, the frames would probably be dark, to contrast his hair. His hair, fair and short, unlike Sherlock’s own curls, dark and almost to his shoulders. He could imagine John asking to run his hand through it, unlike everyone else that just ruffled the curls without restraint.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. It was also very
He doubted they worked anyway.
However, and John didn’t quite understand why, Sherlock continued to help him put it on.
This time he couldn’t, not as well at least.
“Anxiety.” John corrected quickly. He still got mild amusement out of the things that Sherlock pronounced wrong, hearing him try to talk about a television one on of their late-night flying lessons had been the funniest thing John had heard in a long time.
Mycroft frowned at her. “I don’t try to control him, I just try to keep him away from trouble so incidents like these don’t occur.” She offered him the raise of an eyebrow. She didn’t understand a lot of his methods, though this was the closest she’d ever come to questioning him.
like his teachers used to do back in primary school. Though he figured Sherlock wouldn’t appreciate it.
“Well we’ll have to fix that. But for now, do you wanna spend the leavers do with me?”
It wasn’t from a night-terror this time. But from the realisation that he’d been asleep in the first place, because he didn’t remember falling asleep.
The person he held in the highest regard, seeing him, that was a vulnerability he wasn’t prepared to unlock.
“Look for once in your life can you not be a prick and help me?”
“Relatively. I forgot how much of a pain in the ass this is.”
“Yes, but only you could’ve seen that. Anybody can check a pulse.”
“I figured you’d be here.” Mycroft spoke, calmly and he took a seat opposite the now drunken Gregory.
John raised a brow. “Why can’t you just tell him yourself?”
“Well, it calms you down, reminds you of your father, and the happy memories you’ve shared. The music, and the chatter distract you. And you like a drink.” He smirked.
Sherlock didn’t need to be told.
John looked up, turning to Greg in confusion. “He did? He told me he knew, but not from the beginning, I thought he just figured it out over time. He knew, that prick knew from the very beginning and didn’t say anything!”
John laughed. “’Fraid so.” He replied, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, having the height advantage now.
To his knowledge that was the first time his little brother had smiled since arriving at the school, or perhaps his eyes around the castle were losing sight, he’d have to check up on that.
“Conductor I assure you it isn’t, the boys are truthful in what they’re saying. You must take them back.” The nasally voice of Professor Flitwick came from behind them, and John gave Greg a grateful glance. “I hope your parents are informed, you may not arrive home until tomorrow morning.”
“So, I now know you have no issue with the violin, though I do go days on end without talking, and other days on end without stopping, would that bother you?” Sherlock spoke, breaking the silence. John looked up at him, confused as to why Sherlock was telling him this, why he was asking him this. “There’s a flat in central London, two bedrooms, and a fairly spacious living area. I know the land-lady, she’ll give us a better rate.”
This was originally going to be chapter 4 (I think?)... I decided not to use it then, but still wanted to use it as part of the story, so I hope you enjoy this quick little chapter. :)
John was going back to war. Each of them had avoided having this argument, not wanting to ruin the precious time they had left together. Now with their final moments together before John left, Sherlock couldn’t keep his feelings locked away.

“Yeah, I could really go for a cuppa. And maybe a custard cream as well?”
They laughed and Molly began telling John stories of other nightmare customers she’d had while working in Mrs. Hudson’s shop as they went out the door together.
“We’ll write and call, love. It’ll be okay…” John tells him, rubbing circles on his back.
Sorry I haven't updated in a while... Life's been pretty crazy lately, even despite the whole pandemic thing... My college went online so I've been focused on that and I'm going to have to find a new job but I don't know when I'm going to do that... so life's been great.
Sherlock pushes John’s hands away from his face. “So you’re the only one who’s allowed to risk their life?” He retorts, backing away and wrapping his arms around himself to hold himself together. “Do you think I can’t handle it?” he demands.
“She sure is. She’s like a second mother to everyone who works here. I’d better show you the register now so I don’t end up being scolded by her. I’d hate to feel her wrath.”
“Sherlock. I have to go. There’s a car waiting for me. It’s time for me to go,” John replied, grabbing his bag from the floor.
Sherlock blushed. He looked down at his shoes and then back up at John after a moment. “Er… shall I get you that tea and biscuit then?”
“John, why isn’t it a pleasure to see you, dear. How are you?” she asked, giving him a smile.
“Of course, that’s no problem!” Molly replied in a cheerful tone. She reached over to the register and clicked on the small size option which was twelve ounces. “John will just finish ringing you up and we’ll have that for you in just a minute,” Molly told her before walking back to the espresso machine.
He got to Mrs. Hudson’s shop with about two minutes to spare. His breathing was heavy and it was clear that he’d ran the entire way there. Mrs. Hudson came out of the kitchen when she heard the door chime.
“Hey, John. Anything I can help with?” she asked.
John laughed. “Well, they’re idiots then. That was absolutely amazing what you just did. Definitely personal and a bit invasive, but incredible nonetheless.”
“Of course, dear. Would you like Earl Grey for your tea like you usually do or something else?”
John sighs and turns away from the door, setting his bag down once again. “I’m not leaving you, love. At least not forever. I’ll be back… We’ll write, we’ll still be together…” He cups Sherlock’s face with his hands, running a finger along a sharp, pale cheekbone. “I’ll still love you no matter what,” he says, looking into his boyfriend’s eyes.
“Cleanliness is happiness, dear, that’s my motto,” she told him, as he washed his hands in the sink.
“Yeah, actually, I—”
“You’re obviously not a good worker if you don’t even understand my order. I have no idea why you were even hired. You’re just a lazy slacker trying to make an easy buck.” John was pissed. Sure he was new, but he’d been kind and polite to her and now she was insulting him? Just as he took a deep breath to tell her that she could shove her non-fat caramel macchiato up where the sun don’t shine, Molly came to his rescue.
“I want a tall, non-fat caramel macchiato with sugar free vanilla syrup and extra caramel drizzle,” she told him as soon as soon as she’d gotten to the counter. John closed his mouth, a smile still on his face but now completely fake.
“John, don’t go-”
“I want a tall, non-fat caramel macchiato with sugar-free vanilla syrup and extra caramel drizzle.” the woman interrupted.
“Then you know exactly how I feel and yet you’re leaving anyway,” Sherlock replies, not looking John in the eyes, trying not to cry even though his heart is breaking.
“Yep,” John answered, popping the last consonant. He’d finally gotten his breathing under control and gave her a smile.
“Are you sure you don’t want a biscuit with that?”
“Yes, Mrs. H,” Molly replied, smiling.
John felt a lot better after her little speech. “Thanks, Molly. I needed to hear that. But yeah, I agree. That woman was such a bitch.”
“Well, dears, I have some errands to run so I’ll leave you to it. Molly, make sure to show him how the register works. That’s the main thing he’ll be working on for now.”
“No, I’m trying to cut back; running low on money. I’ve been meaning to get a job, but school and rugby have kept me so busy that it hasn’t really been my priority.” He shrugged and looked down at the floor. He felt sort of embarrassed sharing his financial problems, especially with Mrs. Hudson. She was a motherly type and would be sure to fret over him.
“I could go with you,” Sherlock whispers. “I could fight alongside you.”
ing with each of her steps. John smiled and opened his mouth to greet her when she spoke.
“Piss off.”
The next day, John was a whirlwind of movement. His anatomy professor wouldn’t stop talking even when the class had ended and John didn’t want to miss out on any information in case it ended up on the test. He’d kept eyeing the clock nervously, not wanting to leave while the professor was still lecturing but also not wanting to be late for his first day at Mrs. Hudson’s shop. As soon as the class was finally over, he’d haphazardly shoved his books and notes in his brown, well-worn bag and ran out of the classroom and sprinted across campus. His bag was filled to the brim with thick textbooks and notes and was a heavy weight where it was slung over his shoulder. The weight made his shoulder ache even though he should be used to carrying around what felt like a ton of bricks as a med student. John couldn’t afford to let his hefty bag slow him down. He pulled the strap higher up on his shoulder and powered through. He knew Mrs. Hudson would be understanding if he was late, but he didn’t want to begin his new job off on a bad start.
“Well, you know me. There’s no such thing as too much tea. Besides, you make the best biscuits in all of London.”
“Molly Hooper, I can have as many mottos as I like. You’d better keep in mind that I’m the one who signs your paychecks,” Mrs. Hudson told her with a laugh.
“As past experience proves,” Sherlock jokes.
“I didn’t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, makes it clear that you come from a strict background, so an authority figure in your life is military, possibly former military. A parent, most likely your father. Furthermore, you simply asked for “a cuppa.” If you weren’t a regular, you would have asked what types of tea are available here. So you already one in mind. You didn’t need to specify because you come here fairly often and each time order Earl Grey, which is why Mrs. Hudson remembers your preferred tea. Then there’s your bag. It’s fairly worn, so you’ve had it for a long time. Even took the time to patch it up. You find comfort in the familiar. But the certainty of structure and routine you’d find in the army isn’t your only reason for wanting to join. No, you want to be a doctor. There’s a medical textbook sticking out of your bag. Not the usual reading a student takes up during their spare time, is it? So judging by the state of your bag and the secondhand textbook sticking out of it, you probably can’t afford to get your degree without the assistance that would be provided by entering the army.”
“Well, why don’t you bring your bag into the back and we’ll get you an apron.” John followed her into the kitchen and set his bag on the bench she gestured to. She then showed him where to clock in and out and had him put an apron on and wash his hands.
“No it won’t. You still won’t be here.”
After his classes, John headed to his favorite coffee shop to get a relaxing cuppa and perhaps have one of the owner’s delicious biscuits. He opened the shop’s old wooden door and entered. The door’s bell rang to announce his presence. The owner, a kind elderly woman named Mrs. Hudson, came out from the back to greet him.
“John! How are you today, dear? Ready to start your new job?” she asked cheerfully.
Molly was a good teacher. She went through how to take orders and charge people on the register. John knew it’d take him a bit to become efficient with the machine because technology seemed to hate him, but Molly was patient and willing to go through it again if he needed it. For the first few hours, things went smoothly. Customers came in, John greeted them and took their orders, Molly made the drinks, and they went on their way. Simple. John was building up his confidence and things were going really well. Molly was great and the customers were kind. He should’ve known it wouldn’t last.
John smiles and pulls away, cupping his love’s face. “Nothing can keep us apart, William Sherlock Scott Holmes. Absolutely nothing.”
John’s eyes widen. “No, Sherlock. No. You can’t do that. I need you to be here, safe. Or as safe as you can be considering you chase criminals for a living,” John chuckles.
Mrs. Hudson smiled and patted his cheek, “don’t mention it dear,” she said, “I’ll see you tomorrow. Enjoy your tea.”
“You two have fun! Bye, now!” Mrs. Hudson said. Her two employees called out their farewells as she went out the back door.
“A bit on the slow side, but you know how it is. There are good days and bad days… Can I get you anything?”
Once Mrs. Hudson had gone into the back kitchen, John turned to Sherlock. “How… Er, how did you know that I’m thinking of going into the military? You’re spot on, of course, but how could you possibly know that?” John asked him.
“What is so difficult to understand? I said I wanted a tall. Starbucks never has to question my order.” She scowled at him and pulled her large sunglasses down just enough to glare at him over the lens.
to go. I can’t just stay here when I know I can help. The guilt will devour me otherwise...”
“Brilliant!” John breathed, looking into the boy’s pale blue eyes.
“Why don’t you work here? I could use another worker to help out,” Mrs. Hudson said, handing him his tea in a paper cup.
“Of course, that’s an excellent choice. I’m sorry though, I’m not sure what size a tall is? I’m new here…” John told her, his smile now apologetic.
“Maybe not, but it is what it is, love.”
“I love you too, John,” Sherlock whispers, his face buried in John’s neck.
Sherlock tilted his head. “That’s not what people usually say,” he told John.
“That’s not it at all, Sherlock. I know you can handle it. Of course I know you can handle it. You spent two years dismantling Moriarty’s network, remember? You can handle it, but I can’t stand the thought of you getting hurt.”
“Sherlock, I’ll be back. I promise!” John goes to Sherlock and holds him, despite his boyfriend’s protests. “I love you so much, darling. This is just something I have to do. I
“I guess it’s just you and me now, John! Ready to have some fun?” Molly asked.
“Sherlock, you know I have to. It’s my duty. I’m a soldier, it’s what I do.”
his mind adds.
“Just some tea today. And make it to go, please” John responded. He dug his wallet out of the back pocket of his jeans and set the money on the counter.
“Yeah, just thinking about that woman from earlier.”
A tall, tan woman with large sunglasses and a blonde bob haircut entered the shop. She walked up to the counter, her high heels
"Really? That’d be wonderful! When would you want me to start?” John eagerly answered.
Sherlock gives him a small smile. “Promise?”
Anyway, I thought I'd post a chapter to this fic since it's been a while since I've updated. I still plan to finish this story, but I don't know when. I'm hoping to this summer, but it really depends on if the world goes back to normal and what the heck happens to my original plans for this summer/fall. My point is though, that I will finish this story at some point. I have an outline made, so I know what direction the story is going to take and how it turns out. Thank you for your patience.
“Of course, love. I’ll come back, I promise. Besides, even death can’t keep us apart.”
“No problem, Mrs. H.”
“I’m sorry, ma’am, but this isn’t Starbucks. Our sizes are small, medium, and large. If you could just tell us which size you’d like, we’d love to make your drink for you. And like I said, I’m new so I’m not used to the Starbucks lingo a lot of people use,” John told her. It had become almost painful for him to smile at this woman now. She was rude and a line was beginning to form behind her.
Prologue
A smile played on his lips. A young Sherlock sounded so sweet, so innocent…so delicate.
They all turned around at John's arrival and rushed to him, clamouring for him to play with them. He nodded and let himself be dragged into a game of trains which was comprised of pushing toy trains around a wooden track and doing impersonations of the 'mind the gap' announcement. Next, he had to sit through several lessons where they each took a turn and teacher and taught him the alphabet and times tables. After this, he was shocked to find that half an hour had passed so he told the kids to grab some food while he made his way back to Sherlock.
"Oh, God, I am sorry, Sherlock. I thought you didn't hear me. I just wanted to ask you for your help…what are you staring at?"
"I know, John," Sherlock said. "I never thought otherwise."
Soz, little bro
He shook his head to get rid of the memory of the moment and proceeded to find a suitable, stable stool.
The next morning, they were up early again to set up food. It was Christmas Eve and the party would begin at 5 pm.
"Sorry, it was just too loud in there,' apologised Sherlock.
"Where the boy died?"
Sherlock was looking above him. Coincidently they found themselves in the entrance, and right above them was mistletoe that Mrs Hudson had  put up only an hour before.
The next few days passed with subtle, longing glances between the two friends. Decorations were put up with a large tree in the corner. Thankful customers came by to drop a present or two. Mrs Hudson kept herself busy in the kitchen making a variety of Christmas treats and a holiday feeling filled the air in 221B Baker Street.
