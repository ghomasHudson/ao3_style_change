"I'm gonna fucking kill Stark before I let that ever happen," Strange growled. "Even if at some point Jade will be older than him going back and forth between possible timelines and aging differently, I imagine, I'll just..."
"It's not a lie," Steve quietly said. "But I'm a mortal, and we're both men."
He first took a form of a nurse, but the Captain received care in a private facility, and it seemed that everyone knew everyone there, so they only asked him if he was lost, not even letting him further than the reception.
"Or anywhere. I'll key you into Friday's processes, so she can open you any door if Strange is in danger, so you can come to him anytime. But you have to promise to give us some privacy in return."
"Well, I'm not a counselor," Phil at first tries to straighten the question out for a serious answer since this is the first impression he's making, but when he sees the bored faces of the athletes, he thinks better of it, and switches tactics. "Or your mom, Rogers."
"Because that worked out so well for your family," Strange said, and Loki banished the projection out of spite then, without thinking.
"What surgery?" Rhodey was looking at him funny.
Literary everyone took some kind of daily medication to decrease their secondary sex hormone production. The buildings were full of air filters, but people still used scent-blocking cosmetics. It became a universal taboo to mention secondary gender even in passing.
“Get yourself killed. In the vision everyone was dead, but you died in front of me. And it was my fault. What if it really will be, because I created the time-GPS?”
"You'd have to ask her since she'd dumped me, but you know this already," Tony pointed out. "
"Groot, how did you come back? I thought you were sent home," Quill wondered, making Mantis say.
Sometimes, like when they were just having fun spending time together, Tony wondered if the mark was a guarantee that they could have that always if somehow he managed to convince Rhodey to stay with him for good. As much as anything could be a guarantee, at least.
“It’s for the best,” Tony assured him, now feeling as if a pressure was lifted from his shoulders. He didn’t need an OSP officer, he didn’t need any disruption to the fragile status quo - all he wanted was just to go home.
"If you're talking about the Hulk, I just consider him a bonus."
"I'm sorry, Banner, but without my hammer, I'm useless," Thor was no longer hungry, so he stood to get back to work.
After all, he had sold Tony to Obadiah right after he was born and his blood test showed he was an Omega. Unfortunately for Howard though, by law, an Omega had to stay in his parents' house until at least the age of 14.
"Right. One is that your posts get as many likes and shares as anyone on the team, but you don't update so often as the others."
Then, the edges of his vision started to blur, and he couldn’t breathe.
As far as Tony knew, Steve was the only OSP officer who didn’t seem corrupt. He not only scheduled a real visit (not just falsifying the paperwork), but also wouldn’t take Tony’s lies at face value, and that was… admirably naive.
attraction between me and Stark, but when you treat me like a hot potato, who you'd be more than happy to pass on to someone else when I don't remember begging you to date me in the first place, I almost wish I had a crush on someone else!"
And then, all Steve could remember were standstills next. Bruce bringing back the Vanished. The attack. Thanos back from the dead.
"I could, but why would you want that?"
And he didn't let go of Quill's hand for the whole night, although he didn't try anything after the kiss either. But even the best nights had to end, so they were going home in the limo, Gamora arranging for the driver to take Rocket and Quill back last, maybe to give them some time together.
Tony also came to visit and turned out how he was plagued by doubts about whether or not he'd be a good father, and Steve had not much to tell him because he didn't know anything about the topic, but Tony didn't need that.
Going out was nice, especially if Tony didn't mind being seen in their company, but Steve just spent hours on a plane getting back to this continent, so he wasn't that keen on dressing up and being recognized in the restaurants and everything.
Banner picked up things so easily as if he was using magic all his life, but he only got the right amount of power to do it right. Loki wasn't going to mention this, but at the same time, he couldn't just accept it.
Whatever it was, when Loki arrived, Barnes seemed not only aware of who he was, but also right about Loki's motivations. Mostly.
"Yeah, yeah, and they are always so grateful that they barely want to let me go." Steve clearly meant the supposedly cured patients.
"Yes. And do you know what else has happened?" Thor was glad to have Banner somewhat back, now also picking up some clothes that were still humungous on him, but better than the alternative. "Asgard, my home planet was attacked by my evil sister, and I'm going to take the Quinjet to fight her, and I need your help. I need all the help I can get. In fact, why don't you go to the Quinjet now, and I'll also try to ask Valkyrie to join us..."
"What do you have in mind? Should we take over the world? A galaxy? Or poison everyone at dinner and see if the nanobots can find and neutralize a toxin that's not from this planet?"
Turned back time correctly, when he all but saw how Stephen would have done it only twice.
"But I do! I would do it for any Avenger, but since it's you, I'll just have to do it all the more."
"No, you aren't! And she doesn't. And-"
"And now I want to do it. So, what do you say?"
And, if nothing else, the human had some decent moves for a mortal, and Loki not only stayed for a couple of hours then but promised to return.
"And what if I didn't want to wait until then?"
The girl just held out a hand, and Ebony collapsed. Then she made another gesture, and Strange was free, and another, and he was good as new. And angry as hell for some reason - at Loki.
"Yes, yes, you're right," then it was awkward, and Thor could only pray Bruce wouldn't notice his faint blush. "It's just... I kind of got close to the other guy."
"Fine, then I'll do it," Tony quickly offered when Steve was just about to get rid of him. "You are a tough person to bargain with, Rogers, but you win. I haven't been a bottom since college, but I don't think it should be a problem. Look, I came prepared, I even have lube."
"Thanks."
Tony was so weak physically he couldn’t have argued with Steve at this state anyway. But it was so much easier if he didn’t have to.
But that was a terrible,
"No."
"Yes, I'm quite sure, that's what I'm saying."
Going back to his old life, therefore, wasn't just a thing when there was no fight to be fought anymore, but also something he thought he desperately needed.
"So, what do you guys think?" Coulson asks and gets a knowing look from Maria. "I mean, it's time-consuming, and maybe nobody would read it..."
Was about to, but then Spiderman jumped between them, almost taking the hit.
First, there was the issue that the more Tony seemed to be doing academically well, Howard's expectations only grew ever higher. And second, he always told Tony to think for himself, instead of copying him, but when Tony started doing that, it turned out Howard didn't want Tony's opinion at all - except if it matched his own.
"I'm not!" Loki was upset how Tony didn't seem to get it. "Haven't you just heard anything I've just told you?"
"I'm not. But it's not the same. No amount of tech could replace... forgive me, I'm tired. I wanted this to happen, and the suit is nice, and I might just borrow it if Thanos appears one day. But I'd like to return to the Sanctum if you don't mind."
"Hm?"
Shocking Steve so much he almost forgot to talk.
"I'm sorry."
"If the villagers see you, they'll talk, you know," he heard Bucky's voice from the inside. "So unless you want them to have the wrong idea, either leave or just come in."
"You need to sometimes get away from your screens, Tony," Steve remarked, only half convinced Tony meant it as a prank, and haven't completely lost his mind working too hard.
"You sure have a funny way of showing it."
“There’s no need…”
"I'm sorry about that, but-"
Except, Tony barely felt any pain or nausea then, and after… he not only slept but when he woke up in the morning, he felt warm and rested. Not just not horrid as the week before, but perhaps better than ever.
He loved Tony so much he would have waited for him forever.
"What's your problem?" Steve also became tense and annoyed by how Tony was acting, not just the other way around. "You know, I tried to be a good sport, truly, but I'm starting to think Pepper was right, and your only grievance with me is that you'd date Bucky if I wasn't."
"So, I always went to school with older kids who basically didn't pay attention to me, right? But one year when I got to go to summer camp, Mom convincing my father I should spend some time with people of my age, rather than interning for Stark Industries as the year before and before and the year
"You're just all talk," Barnes turned them around with a swift motion, getting the upper hand, but only using it to kiss Loki.
"Like I need my team's ego to skyrocket any further," Fury mutters, but just when Phil wants to take it back, he adds. "But if even I think it's a cool memory to have a poster of the team to keep, I can't even begin to imagine the young girls of the school will feel about the idea. Just a side note, Coulson, if we're going to do this..."
By the time Bucky was done, Tony wanted to get back to the repairs of his suit, but Barnes didn't just leave.
"Yeah, maybe too much," Barnes only said.
Finally, when they were back for a while, and they met with the other Avengers, it turned out they shouldn't have worried.
"Ah, so it's like now?" Loki teased. "Come evening, you might just be asking my hand in marriage."
"And I'm back to Captain."
All the while Tony now was working on everything but weapons it seemed. "Just" the logistics of how to get water, food, electricity, and the basic healthcare to everyone was about twice as difficult to maneuver if not more.
"Steve isn't my boyfriend, or...
"Good job," Fury says, but it sounds more sardonic than honest. "I've always wondered why you hated him so much but figured it must be because he's the captain..."
"Um, what just happened?" Tony's mind seemed to reset. Not the usual way he reacted to a kiss like that, but it was also anything but ordinary that Rhodey would kiss him. "Am I dreaming?"
Thor was about to show him how much he meant it too when Bruce stopped him.
He wanted Tony to do this, otherwise, he wouldn't have asked for it. And the first couple of times, Steve felt both safe and satisfied too.
Quill just stared, and she took it for a yes. Quill expected it to be a one-time thing, but the next day not only Gamora sat with them, but Drax and Mantis as well, and even though Quill was jumpy, Gamora only took his hand one day, when Rocket wasn't at the table, and quickly said.
"Now that I can hold and not instantly crush the produce, I think it should only get better," Bucky told him. "And I'd do it anyway, Stevie still doesn't like the food of this era as much as the recipes his mom used to make."
For the Time-Heist, Vision went back to the past with Rocket to collect the Soul Stone from Vormir, only to be told one of them had to die to get it.
"I'm not really into your sullen boyfriend either."
Tony muttered something back Steve didn't quite catch.
As if Loki was known to admit defeat! Ever!
If you lost control of it even for just one second, it could kill you or worse. Destroy everything and everyone around you. And sometimes, when the pain was too much even for a seasoned mage, they'd lose control on purpose. Cautionary tales were full of them.
"Don't. I'd rather you just left it in the lost and found if you don't want it," Rocket told him. "I can't afford Ronan thinking I talked to you let alone did you a favor."
“If I let you?” Tony was confused. What?
"I'll also get you a coffee if you manage to survive."
it, or should I click my heels three times?"
“Tony, you can’t keep blaming yourself for-“
"Don't worry, I wasn't going to do anything else."
"Uh-oh, why?" Ronan only mocked Rocket now. "Is Quill your new boyfriend, Rocket? Groot just wasn't good enough for you anymore?"
Also, if he could be the one to save the world, he'd do it (he had been doing that for a while now). But he didn't want to give Strange the satisfaction, since it was all the wizard's fault.
"It's not about that," by now, the movie was completely forgotten, and Steve looked as defensive as he felt.
"Don't argue with me, I need complete agreement and support from you to become even more awesome."
"Tell me when you change your mind," Strange sat on the stairs, biding his time.
"Friday?" Steve only asked her.
He also looked like he wanted to say something, but then looked at Tony by his bedside, and only shook his head.
"It's not possible, I'm sorry. But we can still be friends," Thor offered, feeling like they already were. And, once he checked, and thanks to Loki's magic, the disk from his neck also disappeared, he only needed to put up some clothing and was ready to go. "Come with me."
He only orders some soda and some fries to keep himself from staring at Rogers who is devouring two menu's worth in just a matter of minutes, and just to make matters more impressive, he not only doesn't get any on his "civilian" clothes, but he doesn't stop beaming at Phil while doing it either.
"I'm talking about Thor and you."
” Tony’s mood and tone took quickly a turn when he was now suggestively whispering in Steve’s ear. “We could say your wish is my command...”
“Do you wish me to stop, sir?”
"I... haven't looked into the possible futures just yet, I need to readjust," Stephen told him, but it was a lie. He didn't want to look, because it would also mean that he'd see how without an excuse to see Stark every day, they'd probably never see each other ever again.
"Why?"
When he let the Captain go, he expected shock, panic, or maybe even some disgust, but Steve only asked.
Steve stared at him for a long second, but then graciously said.
Only, sometimes he got so comfortable that he kept forgetting the nefarious plan, and that was alarming, to say at least. Making him think he should leave as soon as possible.
They were just kidding around, like so many times before, really, so Tony had no idea why Rhodey chose this moment to just - out of the blue - kiss him.
" Bucky quietly added. "So please don't insult me by denying it."
"Only tomorrow?"
"And you don't use their furs as clothing or something?"
"Perhaps," Loki told him with a smile. "Are you willing to bet Steve's life on that, though?"
"Maybe you never considered another man as a potential partner before me, and by then, it was too late," Bucky told him.
Until one day he appeared on the doorstep of Bruce's lab, asking the scientist if he could turn Steve back - for real.
He sure won't give birth without help... He was more pain than he ever thought was possible already.
"Or else?" Getting the righteous Captain to threaten him could be interesting, but Loki was disappointed fast.
"Try a year. For your own sake, or Rhodey will retaliate and you'll end up worse than just a ruined wall."
"Yes?"
it. If Steve knew he could get off topping people and it could be just half as good as with Tony, maybe he would have tried it before. He was disappointed thinking that - as usually, it was the case with Tony - it was only a one-time thing, but he turned out to be wrong.
He even couldn't help but avoid Pepper and Rhodey as well, because Tony knew Rhodey had destroyed Dr. Zola's files before turning the rest of the damning evidence over incriminating Schmidt, but in order to know what to file as a document and what to leave out, both Pepper and Rhodey had seen it all.
"This is only a guess, but since you've just banished a very important power that's crucial to this universe, the balancing powers might be trying to force it back to existence in another way."
"I get it," Tony offered. Rhodey talking to him was already better than he expected. "But you were there for me when I needed someone for 20 years. So at least let me help you financially if nothing else."
"Ultron? Ultron is history," Thor laughed, but regretted it immediately when he saw Bruce pale.
"Remember this?" he asks Steve when he finds it.
"You had an altercation last week that caused a rift, negatively affecting the whole team, and the issue at hand concerns all three of you. That's why I gathered you."
"Are you sure about this? You've just said..."
"Hey, you're back." But Tony seemed so happy to be trusted and needed, even all smiles and teasing jokes and very hands-on even now that the Heat was gone, that Steve couldn't tell him this. "How are you feeling?"
"Oh, great, not only break my heart but destroy my company as well," Tony theatrically said. "But do you know how many people want your job? And how many are more qualified to do it? Give me a break."
"Quill, you look like a tomato," Rocket was only ever too happy to declare. "And no worries, we can get you in as Groot's plus one, if you wanna join us as all."
"Maybe not just because of that," Bruce said.
But then, Vision's eyes stared into nothing, looking back at him empty, just a frozen machine without his memory files now - therefore the "joke". There was nobody there anymore.
"Because then I could use time-magic to find the perfect way to tell you that I do."
"You're right. So
"Groot's asexual," Mantis now told him. "It's pretty obvious. Like, everybody knows."
And Strange wasn't obtuse to notice what Stark must have meant when he was giving him a suggestive look.
He had devised an electronic Nest (a metal shell) that would act as a substitute to a real one, in case the Omega’s Alpha was dead or too far to help, easing at least some of the Omega’s distress by keeping them "safe".
But it's hard to do that when the certain person whom you were talking to had experienced many rejections when younger, and now you were tied to their emotional landscape because you were secretly making them feel better, and you could directly sense the sharp pain your words just caused.
“Then I want you to help me,” Steve told him.
"At the risk of repeating myself," Tony got back to his previous line of thought. "Where should we go? Somewhere with a dress code?"
That made Rhodey only chuckle, "Does this seem like something that would happen to you in a dream, Tony?"
"And lose all the joy of sneaking around?"
"I... can't, Tony," Steve had to come clean. "I'd love to take some days off with you once we're both back on the meds, but-"
Well, that everyone was staring at them was putting it mildly.
"Oh, I'm..."
"Nobody knows!" Thor pretended to be even offended by the idea just for fun. "Why do you even think anyone knows is beyond me..."
"You don't look like you do."
"I have no idea what she's talking about. She's malfunctioning worse that I first thought."
And Steve was unexpectedly having fun at his own expanse, even when they jumped to 1970. But then, they were almost arrested on sight, and they were stuck.
"I got that, and I have been dealing with just that for a while now until you show- I mean, she engineered a way for us to meet again."
"Well, there are always ways around that, I can show you if you want."
"I'll make Friday order some pizza when I'm hungry."
"So you don't even try to deny our chemistry," Tony only heard what he wanted to hear. "Are you shy? Maybe even-"
"Yes, to just Steve, then you'd never be Captain America again, even though I also have a very good guess how the Serum works now," Bruce warned.
Even when he opened his eyes with great effort, he couldn't place his surroundings but managed to find his clothes and a joined lavatory where he could take care of his business and drink some water.
"Steve, I hate to say this, but you should be very careful."
"Anything else on your mind, Coulson?" Fury then asks.
It was a suit. That also flew and amplified magic, and Tony must have thought it would cheer Strange up if he was allowed to test it, but it made him miss Levi instead. And it wasn't a lie, he was also missing his magic, even though now he had steady hands.
"In what sense?" Vision wondered.
"What, Bucky told you we were just friends or something?" Loki wondered, but then Natasha helped him out.
" Maria implies something else with her tone, making Nat laugh but stop when she sees Phil's expression.
When things usually weren't. And Loki was the last person even in the ring with three mortals who had a right to promise her anything.
"Sounds sensible."
"Well, guess what, I'm doing exceptionally well nowadays..."
It took him 4 hours to catch up on the latest neuro-interface tech researches, design a pattern that didn't rust easily, devising a metal alloy that was durable, yet 27% lighter.
“And I was also thinking what would happen if we wouldn't let the doctors take the blood of the pups when they were born,” Steve added.
"I have footage where there are physical signs of attractions between them."
"You're an unexpected hindrance to my existence."
"Sure, until you just might," Loki agreed. "Even if you can go a decade without blood, how do you know the same can be said of two decades? A dozen? It's only a matter of time, so-"
But having two close calls on his life, he also wanted to do nothing with it. He couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if they weren't found just for a little bit longer, but one kiss - especially given the circumstance - didn't mean anything, and that was only proved right when they avoided even mentioning it in passing since.
"Maybe you did me a favor," the doctor only sighed, and Loki at first didn't realize Strange was talking to him once again. "If I'm no longer Sorcerer Supreme, I don't have to deal with these people any longer."
“I’M FUCKING FINE! I DON’T NEED AN ALPHA WITH A HERO-COMPLEX BECAUSE I DON’T NEED A RESCUE! WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?!”
"And I'm a demigod, so what's your point? I defeated you in battle, you even admitted to it..."
Bucky was what some obscure texts on Asgard referred to as a "draugr" (what the Midgardians would call vampire), and a royal draugr in that, meaning that he didn't come out of the transformation as a flesh-eating zombie.
At first, Howard hit him for it. It wasn’t a proper Omega behavior to invent things (Omega children weren’t supposed to think for themselves when their Alphas would do it for them later anyway). But Jarvis helped Tony hide his creations, and the next time Howard had found them, they were more advanced, so he started to sell them.
"Oh but I will, and you will escape with me, Banner."
And when he woke, they were already in space.
"What are you even saying?" Thor was not only in considerable pain, but also couldn't follow.
"I can only get it right when it means something, though, you know?"
It turned out to be almost as a repeat of the night before, except this time Tony let Steve do this, but still was giving him acerbic looks. While Steve ignored the fact that grinding together was primarily a male Alpha couple tendency, and it was nowhere as satisfying for him as if Tony took him for real.
"And I'm right here,
"How much lighter?"
"It's not a spell. If you learn to channel my magic, you can use it to keep your hands steady," Strange explained. "It's a constant effort, but you-"
"Not exactly the challenge I'd like to take you up on."
"She's must be-" Strange almost answered, but Loki only - ever so slightly - shook his head. "Actually, I have
Tony only looked at the spray in his hands. It incapacitated Alphas for a couple of minutes, and he never saw one in real life. It was probably just a bottle of water to lull him into a false sense of security, but he still would have loved to test that theory on Obi.
So maybe he needed to change tactics.
"A mortal killing me? Now I know you're delirious..."
He not only didn't manage to convince Thor, but only provoked him, it seemed because he attacked Steve, so Steve had to extract himself to the future with the Stone finally, leaving him behind.
"You came running when I was hurt. Then the next threat comes, and you even fought on our side just to make sure I was okay..."
"AH! But I've got news for you!" Rocket laughed. "Everyone knows! Hell, we've been betting when you'd finally get together, and I'd be damned if I let the grouchy machine girl win."
Somedays, he felt understood, sometimes even emotionally getting to Tony. On other days, there was nothing he could do but accept that Tony was still dealing with everything, and wait him out on the other side.
"Now who is lying."
Tony could only inwardly groan. But he'd be a hundred times more irritated soon if he didn't learn that spell so...
"Quill, if you want to go with me, all you have to do is ask," Rocket gave him a charming smile.
"What is this place?" the doctor turned around as if just from the decor he could tell that it was one of Thanos' ships.
So when Captain Marvel mentioned she was shorthanded on some missions in space, Vision immediately wanted to go.
"Sorry about Yondu. I can't even begin to phantom why he was acting so strange," he told Rocket, but "strange" didn't even begin to cover it. Yondu was way over the top nice one minute, only to be a complete jerk to Rocket the next...
"And the point is?"
"He's already being prepared for the arena. I hope he'll give us a spectacle before he dies."
For someone to turn to dark magic, and become proficient, not just the pain of a catastrophic event was needed, or one prolonged period of despair. It was only constant and powerful pain that almost broke you that would push you to the next level.
“Tony, you have no reason to lie to me.”
Decided to give all three of them 2 chapters each.
"Yes, and if we were to do it, we should do it right."
"If you're talking about elevated pulse, and heatedly exchanged words, you should consider we despise each other," Tony told Friday.
Then he just went through the motions and didn't let himself think. He didn't even have it in him to be a proper villain, it seemed. Not the acting deranged part - that was surprisingly easy - but how he was plagued with doubts.
"I want to be. But I also don't want to close myself off from you, and I'd like her to meet you. If you don't show, she might just think I made you up to make her feel better, you know."
“You aren’t listening, are you?” Tony stopped after a while.
"Ah!" Stephen said, expecting something like this, but still not expecting this completely.
Only seeing Steve next when there was a mega-threat again, some crazy Midgardian scientist going too far with his experiments, and this time Loki showed up not to scavenge alien shipwrecks but to back the Avengers up.
Some old lady must have heard because she was giving them weird looks.
"You're cruel."
Time almost stopped, and Tony was caught staring - he couldn’t take his eyes away.
"And you said there were two things, so what's the other?"
"As I hoped not, since you aren't attracted to men," Steve told Tony. "But so far you were the only one who spent time with him other than me, and you could also take a break sometimes, maybe you'd sleep better. You know, every other year you decide to leave here and join the land of the living."
"Here?" was all that Strange asked.
"Astro projection, is it? I take it the simple but glamorous life of a doctor wasn't enough for you, finally?"
"You aren't joking?"
for Loki to agree, but he was quite surprised when he not only found Thor living there with a Midgardian wife but saw how most of the Avengers still alive and kicking as well.
It was just Loki's luck. Mess up one of the human's life of a select few he couldn't fix - not without permission.
"In that case, I can also give you some closet space," Tony couldn't believe it, but Stephen was smiling at him.
"I didn't. With you dying," Steve said. "I'm selfish like that. I've spent the last weeks thinking I can't even imagine a life without you."
"No, it's not. And as an Alpha, I can show you. If you let me," Tony let his suit retract and put the nano-housing on the table. Closing the distance between them.
When things changed, they’d always turned only to worse for him. And he was just an Omega, completely powerless anyway.
"You know, I think your spells are based on science. If only I had my lab to test everything I can do with your powers..."
Or maybe an impending horrible space death was just making them even giddier, because neither of them got much to lose, and this way, at least, they could be as honest and giddy as they would like.
"Besides, what good would it do now? Just use your head, Quill," Rocket told him. "Ronan won't forgive me either way, and that was true a month ago all the same as it is now, no matter where I sit."
"So why not ask her directly?" Bucky tried to dissolve the tension before Friday was the reason they'd end up with a fight. "Friday, what made you lock us in when we're not fighting or pose a threat?"
But, nobody called Tony out like that without some kind of response, so the next morning Tony found Steve with a giant poster and sharpie.
"It's not a joke, Tony! It's a very serious offense that I used you like this, and-"
"Everything's different now," Steve warned.
“Go on.”
That said, Frigga did let him out of his prison, and Thor snuck him out of Asgard, but Loki couldn't return to Midgard without the Bifrost, and Heimdall was loyal to Odin only. And he also wasn't sure Barnes would want to do anything with him anymore.
So, it wasn't a choice, not really.
"Damnit, Gamora, I've already said that he's mine," Quill joked. "I'm taking him. But you can pay for the limo for everyone if you have cash."
"Obviously, she ages differently," Strange took her hand protectively. "And she's more powerful than all of us combined, so how am I supposed to stop her? Of course, you'd know that if you would have been around..."
"I need your car."
Or at least, there shouldn't have been. Except when he was only wearing a towel, drying his hair while using Bluetooth earbuds to listen to a playlist simply titled
He was in the middle of nowhere as far as he knew, and hungry and sleepy, and with no power left in his limbs. So he only meant to close his eyes for a bit, but when he opened it up again, somebody's boots were just right in front of him.
"No, we weren't," Bucky admitted, thinking a hundred years were quite long enough for a secret to stay a secret, although he still didn't feel ready to deal with the consequences.
And not to mention, he had to date this Schmidt person every other night, and while Tony didn't want to end up in one bed with Schmidt ever, the more time passed the more Tony overheard about Schmidt's operations, so he was more intimidated to admit he wasn't who Schmidt thought he was.
Still, Tony shouldn’t have flinched. Another careless mistake like that, if he left his mind wander, and Jarvis would be only memory. Tony was quite sure he’d die without him.
Steve was part of the team still, but now almost useless, having regrets for the first time since he was changed back. He couldn't even hold up his shield for long now, not without his arm going numb.
"Will you ever stop?" Loki closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Unfortunately, him taking Tony's sadness away also seemed to have empowered Stark's confidence.
"I doubt it could be any harder."
At first, they weren't a team: Vision avoided both of his teammates as much as he could, and Nebula was eerily silent too, only Rocket making some noise, but not because he was talkative either - he was just so used to Quill's playlist that he wouldn't pilot the ship without the music blasting from the speakers.
"Does this mean-"
"I know how it works, I just didn't think you'd figure it out," Loki noted.
So Rhodey moved in with him, and Tony felt horrible because he knew this would have never happened without the accident, but they were talking again, even if just during meals or randomly when Tony was making the special braces for Rhodey.
"That's why I thought we were in agreement," Bucky went to gather his gym bag, ready to leave. "Yet if I didn't stop when I did, you would have freaked, and that would have made him even more skittish."
"I've seen your medical history, and most of what you had have some kind of treatment now, just... I want you to be sure. The human body can't handle the transformation back and forth, so if I turned you back to just..."
"Just turn back time and bring him back," Steve couldn't care less about anything else.
"The Sanctum needs to be repaired, or we're all dead already," Wong also appeared. "But if the Time-Stone is used incorrectly-"
"Not how I've been feeling lately," Steve could only sigh. Losing the fight to Thanos was just too much. Steve spent many days walking the halls like a zombie, unable to accept what happened still.
"I could never hate you."
"You don't want your body back, is that it? You secretly wanted to get rid of the monster for years now, only to realize it took over your body, and now you'd rather just not have it back at all."
Strange still wasn't playing along, so he didn't know. Loki could have kept it from him. But there must have been a reason Jade locked them up together, and not one by one with a perfect future counterpart. This way, they could get a glimpse of the future, sure, but also talk.
“Alright, we better take a taxi to get you home fast then,” Steve only forfeited with an unreadable expression, but Tony didn’t mind. Only when they passed the intersection where they were supposed to be going did Tony turn to him.
Well, challenge accepted. After that conversation, Loki did everything in his power to do just that, actively trying to force his will on Bucky, but...
"Oh," Bruce reddened. "I wasn't talking about
has nothing on us!"
It was only a joke, but it was true that Bucky was the least interfering guest he'd ever had in his lab - even counting his robots. And he didn't sound like someone who'd try to steal Tony's data for SHIELD at least, which couldn't have been always said of Nat, for instance.
"He did?"
Bruce just gave out a very un-Hulk-like, mortified shriek and buried his face in the pillow.
Tony felt quite alright, the first time since they’ve met. Steve clearly just needed a new partner after losing a bondmate, and Tony could be that. At that moment, he desperately wanted to be.
"But what?"
"Please don't," Stephen thought how ridiculous he'd look doing that. "It can't be undone. But, if you help me save the world, I'll help you with whatever paperwork Miss Potts seems to be adamant about."
"Whatever you say. I give up. You win! We'll never get out of here," Tony lay down on the floor between two treadmills, taking cover. He couldn't bear the thought of looking in the direction of either super soldier. God only knows what they could have been thinking.
," Tony eluded one of the popcorn bowls that were circulating, which Bucky was trying to pass to him, by almost tossing it to Bruce. "How long have you been fucking him behind my back?"
"For the record, I'd never done that."
“I’m sorry I... what is... I don’t. I mean... that’s not... you can’t be...” Tony was incomprehensible.
"If you realize I'm more likely to keep you around longer if you amuse me, amuse me," Loki wasn't about to deny any of his wrongdoings or occasional malevolent intent either.
"I was thinking... why a bake sale?"
"Tony," Bucky only told him, kissing into his neck.
Steve didn't come to reprimand Tony and already regretted doing it the minute it was out of his mouth. The other super soldier was fine and told him Tony only needed more time, but whenever there was a risk of them going somewhere where Tony could or would appear as well, he completely retreated to almost Winter Solider silent, and Steve hated it.
"Then I'll go to the Doc then, he said he'll teach me."
"If you wanted, we could watch porn together, instead of these movies," Steve stated as if that would ever work.
And while Ebony's inadequacy came hardly as a surprise, Loki's worry whether the doctor lived or not was.
"You? Oh no. Buck, if you ever hurt Loki, I won't be able to be friends with you anymore," Steve then just said, which made Loki smile, but not his partner.
“So if I take a blood sample right here and right now, wouldn’t I find some illegal substances in your blood?” Steve asked him with a sad expression, then he stepped closer, and lowered his voice. “I’m on your side, Tony. This isn’t a trap. If you give me a good enough reason, I’ll make sure to get you out from under Obadiah’s care. But you gotta tell me at least some part of the truth. Even if he isn’t the one who hurt you, he’s still guilty of negligence at least. I wanna help you. I’ve helped many others like you already. But you have to trust me.”
"I just saw how uncomfortable you looked, so I lied."
"Dude kinda needs a haircut, but if I tell him this, Thor is gonna be pissed too."
Given how the topic was Pepper's mark, Tony might have looked Rhodey's up just trying to make sense of it all (and with Rhodey it wasn't hard either because for military and government officials their marks were in a more database that was open for the public).
"But why buy one? You can just borrow mine anytime you like," Steve told him.
"Well, I won't, because there's no way I'm taking it," Peter said. "And if you don't mind, I'm trying to watch a movie here."
"I see. I haven't been threatened in what it feels like centuries, so... I suppose I could let him have his fun," Loki said, just before Bucky kissed him in appreciation, and when they parted...
"If you're worried about your boyfriend, we're protecting him. In class. Not that he couldn't take Ronan, but the teachers don't like trouble, so... don't worry, we've got him."
A couple of people took pictures, so now the social media was full of them kissing, and while people just mostly ignored Quill, Rocket had it worse, with everyone saying he started it, and finally, it wasn't a surprise that Rocket's parents saw, and decided to get a private tutor for their son, after all, not even letting him attend school any longer.
Then he had a double shift at the hospital, and when he got back, only stepping into a relaxing shower for two minutes, Tony was there in his room, ignoring the fact that he was only wearing a towel.
"That makes absolutely no logistic sense," Tony couldn't help but say. But Steve and Bucky stopped arguing, so that was good. If they weren't already too far gone. "But anyway..."
"I don't want pity!" Quill said. "And no matter how rich your parents are, buying me a phone won't make up for the fact that you stood there watching when Ronan beat me up and might have just laughed about it too!"
"Believe it or not, it was an accident. I was too preoccupied with trying to juggle rescuing you, eliminating the guy who kept torturing you, two stupid mortals, and your daughter who you let follow you to an enemy spaceship."
He was never tortured, and he was comfortable - but at what cost. He was given the finest food, room, clothing, books. But the books were always strictly on paper so he'd have no chance to hack them to get out, and Tony felt like he was kept in a cage because he wasn't only locked in a room, but he was watched 24/7 by armed guards.
“To?”
Except maybe when one day when Loki was reading in his tent, and he heard the voice.
“I have friends who could probably forge us two passports, and if not, they’ll know a person who can.”
“What have you done?”
Steve couldn't even believe what was happening.
" Thor tried to calm him. "I know this will be hard to believe, but hear me out."
"Umbrella was a keyword used in secret SHIELD communications more than once in the past," Friday told them. "Probably that's why Sergeant Barnes is unfamiliar with it."
Like when he offered up
"I'm pretty sure you're going to trick me. But I'm telling you this because I might just have a better idea."
"I don't mind, as long as it won't attack me in its current state if I try to use the toilet real quick," Bucky told him, making Tony type with a smirk.
Or so he thought, but it was just then when Stark had stepped in with a bunch of obnoxious balloons that were meant to inspire the Captain to "get well soon", and when he saw a random black cat, his first instinct was to transform his watch to a weapon and aim it at Loki.
“Then give me a couple of months and I’ll show you we can make it work. I promise,” Steve kissed Tony's knuckles lightly. And the Omega knew there was no way he could deny the Alpha anything when he was smiling… In a way, that bright gesture held more power than any of Obi’s threats before.
"They like you, which I can't say comes as a surprise."
"Alright, but just because you asked so nicely," Yondu almost gave him the keys, but then stopped him. "One thing though."
"I want to try it," Rhodey seemed both excited like a little kid, and also hesitant. "But if you invented it, shouldn't you fly it?"
It wasn't at all nice to collapse on the floor from even the effort, followed by the pitying look the mortal gave him.
He didn't even leave a dent.
"You remember how you've told me once that I could be so much better off if I had some peers who were like me?"
Strange, however, living through an eternity of pain with Dormammu, doubted it was anything he couldn't take, and... it was his only choice. Something he wouldn't expect, because everything he could (all 14 million of them) didn't hold the solution for the problem.
Except, they all sort of knew Thanos was getting stronger with every Stone he took, and his army would be quite a challenge even on its own, as it had been on countless times in the past, on countless planets already.
If not for Asgard, he would have considered staying a little bit. But he needed to get back, and when they came across Loki with Hulk by accident, it only meant Thor needed to do it that much faster.
"I'm already regretting this," Stark said. "But fine. He probably wants the Stone for himself, so we defeat the creepy alien first, and then I'll kill Loki."
“Act like you’re the one and only true Alpha on the team.”
"He just missed his pet," Thor said.
Only, Banner was returned then promptly.
"I'm... already... weird. I can't... be gay as well. Or bi, but that's not what people would say, even dragging Peggy's name through the mud..."
"I took the liberty of locking it, boss. Just as deactivating all of your security codes."
"I'm not that horrible. So you either tell me what's wrong, or I'll just accidentally leave Thor behind for the next tour, giving you two plenty of time to sort it out."
"Shouldn't have used that spell, Strange," Wong only murmured then. "But if you're staying for dinner
"Giving us a real chance, for once. And I have some ground rules..."
"That's just one person with a bad sense of humor if you ask me."
"It's not only death that would be spoiled if you knew about it. Think about it this way-"
“I don't get it.”
"You don't get to make that decision, mortal."
“And I couldn't care less about the regulation if your thinking isn’t clear. I won’t-“ Steve now looked at him, alarmed. “I’d be the happiest Alpha to assist you in all your Heats before you think otherwise. But I want you to tell me that before it hits.”
"She didn't!" Quill insisted quickly before Rocket would believe her even for a minute. But his desperate attempts to save Rocket from a possible humiliation must have looked as if he was trying to save himself.
He wasn't into men per se, but as a doctor, a body was a body and at least Stark was good, so he had no regrets, though it had to be one of the weirdest morning afters when Strange woke beside his own naked body still sleeping, while his Astral form sitting at Strange's desk, Stark busy working already.
"I shall tell Rocket you said that," Vision could only promise. "I think he won't hate it completely."
"I did. But if you hate it, I'll-"
"You really like me," Rocket then stated.
So, they were not only thrown back to a room, but a prison, and now the witch assured them that the cell was shielded from magic attempts at escape as well.
Loki didn't think Bucky was in danger. Nor that he'd care if that was true.
"It's a date!" Drax declared, raising his juice glass as if it was a drink, and they were toasting to it, and Mantis was already doing the same, and Quill could only shot a very nasty look at Groot who was about to do the same, but when seeing Quill, he quickly just took a sip of water instead.
"You haven't told him? Am I your dirty mistress now, Cap?" Tony gave him a look, making Bucky stare at them both.
He only collapsed again on the way back, and that's how he was found. By Captain America himself.
"So, I finally get to hear what you really think of me. Don't hold back."
"Apparently, Tony Stark can," Strange told him before turning to Tony. "You must forgive us. Disciplines are taught right from the start that they can't teleport without a special ring, and you just proved that principle wrong."
"You used to be a surgeon," Steve looked at him. "You operated around tissues all the time, and somehow found a way. So concentrate the time-spell as you would have a scalpel."
disappointed by you, Loki. I was tempted to melt you into a puddle, but then I was told that then the body of my Champion would be gone as well, and that can't happen. So if you want my forgiveness, you better find a way to switch back and do it fast. Otherwise..."
"I'm sorry, I know I barely know you, it's just-"
"No, it's not. I'm just not a Jedi Master to teach anyone anything," Steve hoped a pop-culture reference coming from him would somewhat distract her. "I mean... the time of the superheroes is gone. We need neighbors helping out neighbors now, not Captain America, so that's what I'm going to do. Help out where I can, but not claiming I have any insight how it's going to be all okay when even after years I still have bad days, even if not so often now."
"I need you to drink my blood," Loki told Bucky then. "It should be potent enough to restore you, and if I'm lucky, my magic will save me from dying, unlike a simple human."
"I could give you my phone for real this time. That way, maybe you could reach me to ask if I was back in town for Thanksgiving or something if you'd still want to meet then."
The doctor was a capable and kind Beta, explaining it very politely to him - even sending Steve out of the room since he couldn’t provide any official documentation Tony was his.
"Fine, I'll help you, and we're going to discuss this once I can kill you without harming the only hope for this universe as well."
"You're surprisingly funny Captain, considering that you're friends with my idiot of a brother," an insult, disguised as a compliment. Classic.
Even though Tony tried not to rely on Rhodey's patience like that so often nowadays.
"For the record, I'm-"
, Tony," Pepper told him. "I begin to think I made a mistake not when I started dating you, but when I started working for you."
"Wait. You're right. It may be selfish but I want you."
"You know what? Forget it. Maybe I die faster this way," Loki wasn't about to repeat a request, not even if he was only torturing himself at that point by being stubborn. But then, the Captain showed up with a complete feast in strange containers, and Loki had already devoured half when he felt Steve's eyes on him, watching him with some kind of wonder. Maybe even... some kind of weird fondness?
Question: Do any of you want to join me and write any of the challenges? Could be fun... ;)
But his discomfort only grew, just when he thought it reached the worst - not really leaving a chance for him to talk.
"Ah! So you're gay? That explains a helluva lot," Yondu seemed unfazed.
Tony would have agreed to everything at that moment, but it was torture to think they'd have to stop, even if for the sake of relocation.
"Well, I say this: I won't go if you die," Bruce stated.
It didn't take a lot for Tony to learn this, and for a while, as a prodigy, it seemed Howard was proud of him. Not when Tony got older though.
"Fine, be that way," Thor didn't seem to get how Loki wasn't doing this on purpose. "I'll fetch our father alone first, and we'll deal with you later."
"How 'bout a deal then?" he offered to Loki. "You conserve your energy by not talking, concentrating only on getting better, and I not only won't let anyone know you're here but once you're sufficiently healed, even take you wherever you'd want to go."
"Oh, Captain, you should have said so," Loki gave him a knowing smile. "I understand my charms are almost irresistible to some people, I just didn't know you were one of them. How would you take me? Rough and fast? Or maddeningly slow? Or could it be that you have no idea?"
Now he wondered how could he put the same thing into a better context to be understood.
He could ask the internet how
idea, because Tony had just returned from space, and he wasn’t taking any hormone adjusting medication or could bother with the usual scent-masking routine, and as he closed the last of the distance between them just for a kiss, Steve suddenly felt flushed and very needy.
It was such a lame excuse really to dance with Rocket, but by then, Quill was already doing it, and...
"Except, it's not just bullshit, is it?" Loki was still incapacitated, but otherwise suddenly in a good mood, only too happy to stir some trouble. "You broke free of your control years ago. You only acted as Winter when you last saw Steve because you wanted him to give up on you. For his own sake. You love him so much you want to keep him safe, even if it also means you'll never see him again."
"Anything?" Rogers asks, and Phil tries to tell himself, Rogers doesn't even know Coulson is gay, so there's no way he'd be flirting.
"Clues as to why I'm here?" Steve walked up to a table where some a screen displayed many windows loading, probably some program running in the background.
What was he doing? Strange started to think it was a horrible idea that he came to the Tower in the first place when Stark was looking at him as if contemplating something, but that didn't last.
"But I'm a bad boyfriend, and I was convinced when Killian showed up that he was her destined, so I looked up her mark and found a completely adorable guy for her instead."
"I'm sorry to disappoint, Cap, but no matter how highly people think of me, I'm still not a wizard to turn back time," Tony, of course, would say that even if he had Friday stashed away somewhere, so there was no way of telling.
“Then let me see what I can do about breakfast. But you should be resting.”
was masquerading as an Alpha.
Coulson thanks him for the opportunity and leaves, but later at night, as he listens back to the recording on his phone, and gets to Fury's bit on the aliens, he feels so bad for not paying proper attention and Fury even noticing it, that Phil pulls up his laptop and spends hours on the internet learning more about the sport.
"So here's the deal. Let's do it. I'm in. All the way. Not holding back, not apologizing for it either. If you still want it, I mean. Even knowing that Capsicle and I tend to have some fuckups like we just did."
"The reserves of secondary sex medicines are going to run out in 2 months. This means people will be forced to go back to traditional roles, and the governments are trying to avoid absolute catastrophe, passing new laws every day, trying to deal with the problem before it hits," Tony explained, and Steve only nodded. He was too preoccupied to listen to the news while Tony was sick, but he heard something like that in passing. "Given that both Peter and his Aunt are Omegas, if they don't provide documentation that they belong to an Alpha, they will be sent to an Omega-boarding school and an Omega-commune who knows where 'for their safety'. I promised May yesterday to mark her and adopt Peter with her so that they're both safe. Believe me, if there was any other way, any other Alpha I could trust with them, I'd do everything in my power to make it happen. But Pepper will marry Happy, and Rhodey was also asked by Maria already..."
"Sounds great."
, doing a mix of old dance styles he once knew, and the new ones he saw in a couple of videos, he only noticed Steve and Tony were there when they must have already seen him.
"Do you wanna meet my mom?"
"If I can't speak properly, the speech recognition still should work at least until I can switch to manual mode. I set up a machine learning rig to learn human speech that's not quite legible but has some meaning. You'd be surprised how many people upload videos of their
"A rough estimate then, or some compatibility test, I'm sure many can be found on the internet," Steve shrugged. "Then ask her to do a calculation with you and Buck. And finally, for all of us."
When Loki ran out of magic, he took it from the people around. He took more than ever before, and he wouldn't have survived if he tried to contain it, but he only needed to last for a very short while, then even if he exploded, he'd just have to make sure to do it in Thanos' face, far away from Tony, right? And not let the dark magic take his right mind until then.
“I became an OSP member because I dropped the ball with Bucky. I should have taken better care of him, and I’ll carry that mistake with me all my life. But at least I’m prepared to do whatever it takes so nobody would go through the same pain as Bucky did then.”
And Loki was about to tell him it wasn't true, but Tony shut him up with a kiss, then saying.
Had it been Thor, Odin, or maybe even Frigga, who was hurt, and things would have gone very differently, even though they were Loki's family, who supposed to care.
"For the record, a lot of us only lost because we thought it would happen sooner," Bruce told him with a smile, and Steve was glad.
As for the rest - they could always figure that out as they went. This time, truly together.
"You have a pacemaker and you didn't tell me?" Rhodey seemed more furious than surprised.
"I also got treatment, although it took ages for Bruce to get it right. Now I eat human food, or whatever is close to consume, and the nanobots synthesize them into something close to blood, so I can sustain myself," Bucky told him. "Sometimes the bots need to be checked out, and normally it's a health risk to have them constantly in my body, but..."
Bruce was so different than for instance Thor and his friends that Loki begun to think that maybe it wasn't quite horrible that out of all the mortals he could have been switched with, he got Banner.
The good Captain must have thought Loki was the same, being attracted to men only, and trying to make him feel better.
Because after all, Loki wasn't just angry like the green monster. He was betrayed and so humiliated that the fury he felt was just a way to cover up the truth, even from himself.
"Then, make me angry," Loki couldn't believe he barely got his mind back and he was volunteering for yet another possibility to lose it again. Not to mention, endanger Banner in his body, because the Hulk could hurt him if he didn't like what Bruce was going to say.
"No, if we're doing this, then Friday shouldn't just grill Tony and me," Barnes announced. "You know, sometimes I wonder if you aren't trying to push me toward Tony because you're so fascinated by him yourself."
Stark had what the magical texts called a "restless pioneering soul", who no matter his achievements, his conquests, or even his wealth, would always live in turmoil. He'd never settle because after everything he'd done, there's always something bigger, better, and more. Whenever Midgard had a group of people like this gather in one era, revolutions came and rewritten history.
“I mean I can only imagine what it was for like you with Obadiah,” Steve looked at him. “So if you’re with me, we decide everything together.”
Thank you all for reading! I hope you guys will love this chapter as much as I do! XOXO
Better than nothing. Maybe he was selfish for the first time in his life, but he didn't want to lose his friend.
"And you don't need to do that."
Or, it was the original idea, but when Steve and Thor went back to Asgard, Thor wasn't himself either. They were both almost killed by the guards if it wasn't for Steve panicking and then suddenly remembering Mjolnir.
"I'll settle for some cruel torture I can inflict on you upon your recovery later as retribution. Like, you won't be allowed to date anyone else but me. Ever. Or complain about the fact. And you brought this on yourself, Mr..."
That made Thor turn back.
"I do, it's true, he's nothing without me. Used to be, but now a six-month-old child is running the family business instead of him," Loki told the old lady, who was still there, but then made a very swift escape when Loki openly turned to her.
"Could we... get back to Earth?"
"I was thinking a snake."
Then, Nebula was badly injured, and while her physical body and her mental capacities weren't reliant on each other, her power reserves were running out as well.
But then, Tony was kissing him, and Steve didn't exactly have many garments to lose.
"Tiny and Hulk. Best friends forever."
like that," Barnes only hissed. "One more comment on him and I'll-"
Odin putting him in a cell that Loki couldn't escape, even when healthy. And giving away so much of his blood to Barnes sort of wrecked his magic too - Loki hoped it wasn't permanent, but still. It wouldn't be enough to escape anyway.
"Nice. I'd buy that," Coulson tries to be nice because Steve looks harrowed after the whole ordeal, but maybe it's too much of a compliment because then Steve's head snaps up hearing that.
“I’d never not want you. Obviously,” Tony said. “Otherwise we wouldn’t be in this situation.”
Loki never gave it much thought, but it was true. As a male who had a capacity to be a woman, and also as a Frostgiant who was raised to hate Frostgiants, giving birth and having a kid inherit his origins was his worst nightmare.
"We haven't been..."
"What's up, Cap? The land of living has finally proven too much for you to handle so you decided to visit my crypt?"
"I... didn't know," Quill couldn't believe it but felt quite sorry for Rocket. He didn't only sound like someone who was upset because he just had a fight with his friend, but someone who was only friends with Ronan at all because he had no other choice.
"And if I'm not?" Steve found himself wondering out loud. "Or if he isn't?"
“Let’s do it. The only thing I need is to check if the hospital can go on without me for two weeks. And if someone can take over the group.”
By the time he managed to articulate it well enough though, the rest of the Avengers had bagged the criminals.
Trigger warning: Steve starts out quite low (depression, grief, survivor's guilt, ...) in this one.
"Shut up and give me 5 minutes to fix this," Tony told him, but Friday spoke at the same time, telling them something completely different.
“Did Obadiah threaten you in some way? In some emergency cases, I have the jurisdiction to take you to the closest OSP facility, if he’s abusive or a threat to your mental or physical well-being. That means you’d never have to go back, not even until the investigation is concluded.”
He took the device from the Captain's hands with some difficulty and tried to type, but that's when he ended up back on the pillows again, his eyes teary from the sudden pain.
"But it's impossible-"
"I don't want to change that either," Tony said. "I was thinking of another type of favor too, actually."
That's when Loki changed. Which was lucky too, because he didn't want to hear the rest.
“You wouldn’t mind?” Steve was floored, but Tony gave him a look.
"It's tradition."
And Tony felt ashamed with them knowing who he really was, even if the mark was only proof of what they must have already sensed when they were with Tony.
But that was over when Rocket showed up, with his indispensable bodyguard, and wanted to give Quill his phone back.
"Steve, I'm not one of your kids in training like Wanda or Peter or the others in need of parental supervision at all times, and I can do things on my own, you know," Bucky told him a couple of days after moving in, but nothing seemed to change, and Steve only seemed to shut down after that.
But, they didn't do that the last time and Steve wasn't about to let Tony fuck him in a freezing HYDRA facility in Siberia either, knowing pretty well that it would be just angry sex.
“You mean you didn’t know?” Steve couldn’t quite believe it either. He was so convinced, all along...
Tony only got another shrug, but he was convinced Levi was now laughing at him when Strange got back from his morning shower and saw them interacting.
Threatening Tony to blow up every time Tony got worked up just thinking about what happened or what would happen now. And he didn't have the green eye-thingie to restore the Tower if he destroyed it, not to mention, Pepper and Happy didn't have shields like the wizards to save them from the shockwave.
And he had spent months in a Midgardian hospital bed with the ever so strange mortals as his only company - he was too week to do anything about his condition, and the Midgardian medicine quite frankly was underwhelming compared to what magic could offer.
"You know, you might not be dying. There's a chance that you, as a Frost Giant, could take the cold of space if the ship completely broke down, and you can examine all the things you want."
"Oh? If that's a thing, that's Steve's jam, not mine. Helping elderly ladies to cross the street, rescuing kittens from burning buildings, waking up coma patients with a single kiss..."
"Well, I'll be seeing you-" Tony said, and wanted to leave, and judging by his expression, he wouldn't return either, not soon...
"I was thinking about applying for a teaching/research job in Oslo. It would be only a couple of days, and it's not so far so I could divide my time between here and there. If you think that's a good idea."
"I want to sit here," Rocket wasn't calm either. "And I'd be damned if I let Ronan dictate anything in my life again!"
Once on the corridor, probably full of adrenalin if not Alpha instincts, Tony then took a second to plaster Steve on the closest wall and kissed him like there was no tomorrow. Then he left to suit up like nothing happened.
"It so is."
"Just don't, Quill. Ask who you really wanna ask, I can still be there anyway."
"A month, and that's my final offer," Tony said from the door.
"Excuse me?" Rogers asks, and Phil shakes his head.
"Wait, a kitten, kitten, or is that some kind of euphemism for something I don't know and possibly don't wanna hear about?"
"A vision of a possible future, obviously," Strange woke up next to him. "I've told her to stop doing this, but when she desperately wants something, she looks for a future that matches her expectations, and keeps you in a loop in it until you go mad or just give in."
"YEARS??!!!" Bruce couldn't take it. "How did that happen? I can't... I think I'm having a panic attack."
Steve, on the other hand, maybe relied on Loki too much. Bringing him a case that he didn't even share with the other Avengers, asking for Loki's help. At first, Loki didn't know whether he agreed to do it because he was looking for validation of the good Captain, or he wanted to betray him.
He might have been unable to sense real grief as humans would, but every time something reminded him of Wanda, it was as if he started a very complicated and tasking calculation he never got to finish, and the cognitive unease was unbearable.
"You're smarter than you look, but still wasting my time by being dumb," Loki noted. "Repercussions don't apply to gods. I can curse someone without having the same magnitude of a curse lingering over my head."
As strange as it was, when Loki had no enemy to fight (and protect Midgard from), and his magic would turn against him, Tony would take it and use it in his process of inventing.
That's why, when after a busy day Steve had found Buck with a new arm that smelled of Tony's tinkering from miles away, and Bucky just shrugged it off, he made a mental note.
"So, can't you restore Friday? Maybe you should strip the talk show host persona off of her, but she didn't do any irreversible damage, did she?" And that made Tony shut up so abruptly Steve started to worry.
“So you thought I was an Alpha all along? You were willing to surrender to me because you thought we were both Alphas and I didn’t want to be fucked?”
He wasn’t in Heat so it was unhurried and quite nice, actually. Steve held him like he was a valuable and fragile thing, and Tony guessed only half of that was how Steve didn’t want to hurt him any worse than he was already hurting.
"I'd rather die knowing that Earth was safe. And that's why I did the spell as well."
Loki could only laugh.
worked, and get thousands of pages of the information, even in the form of videos and lectures, easy to comprehend, learning a lot of things.
So, he had to use
and his head lolled to Bucky's shoulders.
It was a simple oversight: they drew attention the minute they appeared because - unlike people back then - had no scents. They could have passed as Betas in most aspects if nobody looked closely, but they too had scents, even if faint. Steve and Tony didn’t even get as far as the SHIELD building. It was not good.
"But your other friends just might, if you sat with them!" Quill hated how Rocket treated him sometimes. Making decisions for Quill saying it was for the best, and not even willing to discuss it - the same as it was when he was trying to force the phone on Quill.
Loki found he could relate, although they were nothing alike, so he wondered if he should do one harmless experiment when he had enough magic for it, and that's how it started.
"Would you like me to stay as well?"
"But your dad, you said..."
Only, Ronan tried to ruin that too, shoving Rocket to the floor, calling him names, provoking a fight. It was Groot who managed to punch Ronan first in retaliation, and he was already being escorted out by a teacher, when Rocket wanted to probably do the same, and Quill wasn't sure how much longer he could hold him back.
Dark magic came from pain. Everyone was so quick to point fingers at the users of it, but truth was, there was a difference between an accomplished dark mage and a child that used one dark spell unwittingly once.
"I didn't read it from your mind, true, but your behavior told me everything I need to report to Steve."
Loki tried to hate this earnestness, but couldn't, not when Steve bought him food plenty times of the day, talked to him, and even risked petting Loki ever so often, knowing full well that Loki would bite his hand off if he wasn't in the mood for it.
"But if we can't manage something simple as that, there'll be worse chaos than we've ever known before. If riots were to start in one country, they can spread like wildfire. And no army can stop the people who are so desperate that they have nothing to lose. Not on the long run. We either manage to weave a safety net all around the world, providing for everyone, or we might as well just give up now," he explained it to Nat when they all were having dinner one night. "So my next Iron Legion isn't a bunch of walking weapons, but some highly specialized units that can drop off packages, evacuate people, or help spread crucial information that could save lives..."
Steve would have loved to say he wasn't at least somewhat offended by that, and it didn't change how he treated Tony. But every time they talked after that night, and Tony was giving him shit, as usual, Steve was wondering how much of that was just Tony's way of talking, or was it because now he knew firsthand how Steve stayed an Omega and just couldn't accept that.
"Yeah, because being my husband is burying the lead there," Phil can only laugh, while Steve only leans closer with a teasing smile.
"Not," Rhodey ended up coming way too close for what seemed like a simple childish disagreement between them. "Lock the suit away, and I'll still say the same."
"I can take Gamma radiation better than anybody in this room."
"That I have no reason to stay," Thor corrected. "Way back when I offered to become your partner..."
"And you were having eye-sex with that hooker."
Tony left without a remark or trying to collect his phone.
"All I was thinking was how I wanted to do it? Then I just did," Tony suggested.
Steve didn't think either, but that was just his bruised ego talking. Just because he was taken aback by anyone kissing Bucky right in front of him, and how Bucky let it happen.
"Meaning that child is probably mine and will be extremely powerful."
"I'm sure you can figure it out, being my spokesperson," Groot teased him.
"Thank you. Steve."
"So I'm supposed to believe that you have a spell to keep your hand from shaking and you haven't used it on yourself just yet?"
"If it's any consolation, a century is nothing, Steve. Goes by in a blink of an eye." That at least earned him a small smile.
"We'll all die," Stark clearly didn't. "And it's going to be your fault."
"Street-smarts."
"Then maybe I could take a look."
So he took the phone - strictly temporarily - and was just about to return it to Rocket's locker once again the next day, still early when Ronan caught him in the act.
Except, after a week, the emotional toll must have got to Steve, because he broke down.
"I wouldn't even dream of wasting your precious time on my boring person any more than necessary by being in your company," Strange said, and it was Loki's turn to smile. He was sure nobody ever has sent him to Hel so openly while being so entertaining.
"A Vision."
He seemed so genuinely happy to show him off, to have someone and let the others know as well, eliciting some jokes from them that were teasing, but not malicious, that even Bucky found himself more relaxed about it.
"Thank you! Someone at least is making sense," Tony sat up, gesturing in the direction of Bucky. "
"Do I have to take it off? Can't I just sleep in it?"
So he chucked the phone to Rocket's locker and thought he was done with it, but he was wrong.
"I wanted to thank you for making Bucky a new arm," Steve picked up some mechanical parts on the table until the other Avenger came and took it out of his hands.
"And if I was an average mortal, that might just be true. But a minute ago, I was also the Sorcerer Supreme, standing between all supernatural threats and this world. Which means that by cursing me, you undid the natural balance of good and evil and that power is bigger than even you."
"I'm warning you, Doc, if you ever as much think of a rectal exam or something like that while you have my body, I'll return the favor."
"Why thank you," Steve couldn't help but note, and wanted to follow Bucky to their room when Pepper put a hand on his.
“You said your walkman was done. Just don’t tell anyone I gave it to you,” and Rocket left, while Groot followed.
"Leave me out of this, Barnes, I'm warning you," Tony also had to say. One minute he was accused of getting too close to Barnes, just for the next to be too friendly with Steve?
"I'm just not the tech guy," Rogers admits, and Coulson nods deeply as if he didn't know that already. "I'm fine with posting a photo of myself once in a while, but not after every workout, if you know what I mean."
"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you didn't care," Strange said, showing signs of distress for the first time. "Like you clearly don't care about anybody other than yourself, or the fate of this planet and everyone on it, or your father and brother..."
So he acted deliberately obtuse now, a little bit of fun.
This way none of the Chitauri of Midgard's mightiest heroes would know that Loki was working on protecting them, except a couple of civilians he had to save, because they were too busy staring at the alien ships and screaming, unable to help themselves by simply running away. Seriously pathetic.
"I believe that's what I just asked."
"Who?" Rocket was now eyeing Quill half-hesitantly, half-suspicious.
duty to scan through them as the social media advisor.
Or at least that's what Strange thought, until Thanos came, and was defeated. And he had his body back, feeling much better about that, but quite like how he also lost an opportunity for something else.
"Indeed, not all people realize what a burden it can be until they already have made a few friends and there's no turning back," Tony told him as if completely serious, making Steve laugh.
It was just his luck that he tried to be covert, but Barton was the first to notice him, yelling at him from a roof.
"You'd feel a little bit more... happy is a strong word, but maybe less... burdened and lighter, if you will."
"You saved your life, you know," the Grandmaster visited him soon. "When you managed to return my Champion, you proved you had value, while that other guy in your body..."
"Stop talking like you know me," Loki now could only warn Bruce. "You know nothing."
"I was wrong," Wong stared at Strange. "He'll not only kill us in days but let the word be destroyed in a matter of hours. Why didn't you stop him?"
But just a stolen party ship, a lost eye, and a destroyed home planet later, Hela was gone, and the Revengers were still all alive, just as all the Asgardians on board, and though Loki didn’t come with them, he said his goodbyes in a form of a clone.
He could also note how ridiculous but over-the-top-cute Steve was, keeping his shield right next to their bed, almost cuddling it even asleep, and just snap a picture of it, and keep the memory forever. (Secretly being fond of it so much he set it as his wallpaper.)
That was why it was so strange when one morning, quite early, Bucky was making pancakes for an early breakfast - Steve's request - and Steve was distracting him one second, kissing into his neck and whispering into his ear, but jumped the furthest way possible when he heard someone coming.
After nobody talking to Quill for such a long time in this school, Quill rather found it endearing and entertaining than annoying. He secretly looked forward to all their lunches now, and Rocket and Groot joined Film Club too, and it was the best.
"Are you trying to provoke me so I might just provoke you better?" Bruce was only too right because that's what Loki was doing.
"No. The talk of what he'll do to you if you ever break my heart."
"Oh no,
Loki was about to show Thor how he wasn't just all talk, clawing one or possibly both his eyes out for this, but then Steve stood, and was leaving with him.
"My mistake then, I'm special. Or you are," Tony smiled at him. "But it's true."
"Brother, if you truly think I'd make myself look like this even to get you off my back, you truly never knew me," Loki told him, then gave the annoying human a what he hoped decently threatening look. "Is this some kind of failsafe? That if someone curses you, they get caught up in the same spell?"
It should have been great. Steve had never shared his Heat with anyone before, the couple of flings he had were too casual for that, even back when he had to go through his Heats before the medication.
"But still..."
Maybe he wasn't Iron Man, but he was still toxic to everyone and everything around him, just as Schmidt was.
"Ha! Hahaha," Coulson laughs, but it comes out forced, and it's not like he knows what is the normal reaction to this. "Nice one, you almost got me."
"Yes, right after Pepper takes my head for it."
"Cute kitten! But she sick."
"You can also use Astral Projections to do your work while sleeping," the Doc offered.
“But really, what would it take for you to directly answer any question I ask? Are you okay, Steve?”
"Come on, don't quit, he's completely drunk, you know how he gets," Cap only stayed to try to calm Tony down, and if needed, restrain him physically if he had to, but so far it wasn't going well.
"You won't get rid of me that easily," Bucky gave him a lazy smile, and Loki couldn't help but smile back.
“It’s alright. I have you. You’re safe,” Steve tried to soothe him by scenting him, while only holding him close still.
"I... can't help but think about.... it occurred to me one time, that I'm in a unique position that nobody else is, not really, and now I can't stop wondering how it would feel."
"It's not him I don't want to see me like that," Bucky told him with effort.
"That's not what he told me."
Saying it was for Thor's sake, and how the curse should naturally end once Thor was "safe", because Loki feared that he was way too careless after the death of their father.
But still, it was impossible, right? So Steve only waved goodbye when the Guardians were leaving, aware that he might not see Thor ever again.
"If I learn magic, you'll have no power over me, right?" Tony, however, didn't listen. "And tell me this: if I was the happiest person alive, and well, would you ever put me down just so you can leach on my darkness once again?"
"If you want a different proposition, you better do it yourself. I'm all ears," Strange told him in return.
“I... can I touch you?” Tony carefully asked.
"Then call someone in who can help. I'm sure you have mighty friends and we'll sort this out in a minute."
"Enlighten me then, how did you manage this particular problem then, Strange?"
And there it was again. Quill's anger which overruled every reason.
The next time they talked, Tony was more lucid, and according to Dr. Cho, he was on the road of recovery, albeit a long one.
Except that then there was something wrong with the ship - "a fucking faulty Terran part!" according to Rocket - so they were stranded for a couple of more days.
"Have you missed the memo on how I look like now, Captain?"
While Barnes no doubt could be proud that he managed to put the issue off for now, seeking ways out of Loki's grasp with the time he just managed to procure for himself - just all the more challenging for Loki.
"She's a toddler?" the Spiderman wondered.
"No, I hate jerks, it's... just don't. It's more like-" Coulson is trying real hard to express something pretty simple, in reality, but he can't say that, and rephrasing goes so slow that Rogers has plenty of time to interrupt him.
"In some cases, it's not a victory to win a war if you know it's going to happen."
"Damn, the white won't cover it up," Tony noticed. The extreme colors of the palm trees and the sunset on the water were indeed showing still. "And I'm not sure how many layers of paint can a wallpaper absorb before the paint will just start to break up. Maybe it’s best to put another poster on top?”
Loki knew he was supposed to be angry, but he could hardly be when it was the truth.
"And am I supposed to call a crane to get this into my room as decoration or what?" Rhodey either didn't get it quite just yet or was teasing him, or both.
"I think... Wong told me something the other day, but I didn't listen," the Doc was positively radiating stress out of his every gesture, and Tony found it curious that he was so relaxed just this morning that he would fall asleep while meditating. "It's also possible that I'm not gonna die."
"You mean to say you made the lunch you've brought?" It wasn't even bad, but certainly edible, especially compared to when Thor or Cap or Peter tried to make something.
“You’re having a panic attack. Let me help you,” he heard Steve’s voice, but he could no longer make out the Alpha clearly. He wanted to get away from him because that was the problem right from the start. Tony didn’t need help, he only needed his workshop to survive.
"I'll be good," Steve told him. He hoped it was a white lie, and that he'd be good truly. "Thank you, Tony..."
"That doesn't explain anything!" Quill couldn't believe this. "Not that I'm saying I am..."
"I begin to suspect doing the right thing would be more appealing if sometimes it wasn't just so damn tiresome," he noted, picking up a fighting stance.
"Yes?"
"You know me so well," Loki mused, not even entirely kidding. "But if this child is as powerful as you suggest, I might just want to raise them. Use them to fit my own selfish purposes and evil agenda you've just outlined."
Just when Steve was half-convinced Tony was also gone, and it was like an absolute miracle to have him back.
“You mean to say you haven’t noticed?” Tony just laughed. “Seriously? Do I look like I’m just ticklish while we’re having sex or something?”
"What, Barnes, are you threatening to kiss back?"
"Whatever
"I thought we were stating random facts," Steve shrugged, grinning.
"Anytime," Groot either didn't notice the sarcasm or went along with it.
"It's not. As far as I know."
"I have a better idea."
Tony told her that he had never had a meaningful conversation than in his whole life, while he didn't hold back when he told her on no uncertain terms that she was crazy even suggesting that Tony would need anyone and that's why the panic attacks started.
"Oh," was all that Tony could say. "So I have to tell you that I feel the same way? But I already kind of did."
"I've tried it plenty of times while testing, and believe me, I've had enough of it for a lifetime." Not to mention, Tony was still not very fond of confined spaces with his occasional panic attacks. "You can hop in right now, or maybe even later, should you choose..."
Then there was the issue of Tony Stark. Notoriously only dating Alphas - so much so that rumor had it he was born an Omega, but Howard paid people to turn him into an Alpha - suddenly kissing Steve.
“What?”
“Hm?”
"Friday locked us all in for a reason, right? Not just Bucky and you, or you and me, but all of us."
"Oh? And if he also likes you, what then?" Bruce wondered.
“And that’s horrible, Tony,” Steve pushed him away gently. “But I need to get to the store and buy you some suppressants.”
But even if it was the real thing, he could probably run only a couple of steps, and he’d be caught and bought back again, facing a provoked Obi.
"I can't possibly..."
"You mean it? You'd buy a mug or something with my face on it?"
His foot got stuck under some debris of concrete, which he couldn't repulse nor simply target without blowing his leg up as well. While he was still taking heavy fire and was desperately trying to command Friday to let him switch back to fully manual combat mode.
"Do that and I manufacture you a whole set of mugs in return. Did you also want a webpage featuring it?"
"Why thank you."
"It's not. I came looking for you only now because the crappy Midgardian technology is incredibly slow on the uptake," Bucky told him. "But now they have nanobots that can be injected into your blood, and heal you on a molecular level if needed."
"Let them try."
They waited, but nothing really happened. So Strange was coming closer to him, and Loki tried to signal with his eyes that he should stop right there, but then the doctor still went ahead and kissed him.
But it would be so much easier if it was any other player, and if his mind wasn't still frozen by the fact that Rogers just admitted to being gay, and that means Phil doesn't have a crush on a straight man (again), but...
"And it's just my luck. I fancy a guy twice in a century, but it's never right, is it?" Steve helped him out.
, if you know what I mean."
"Well, my fault. As it always is, isn't it? No matter if I care too much or too little for something, whether we're talking about the fate of Earth or a relationship, I'm always wrong, and you'll be always the first to point it out, won't you?" Tony wasn't as laid-back as he first seemed to be either. "And as much as I appreciate that, maybe I would be more tempted to run the numbers if you came here asking that I should run four. One also including you and me."
It was almost surreal, the exact opposite of their last time together. There was no rush, urgency, or hormones making them do it, and Steve was lucid this time.
"No, no, I've been nothing but hard-working, caring and patient,
Tony must have noticed that Steve didn't knot, or maybe all he wanted right from the start was to get off quickly with someone that night, but he left only telling Steve an "I'll see you around, Captain" from the door.
Shit. And that certainly qualifies as a real reason for Steve to ask him follow-up questions of the topic, so they aren't quite done with it, not just yet.
"I'm sorry, I should let you go sleep," Tony typed, not happy he'd have to leave any work unfinished, but other humans preferred more sleep than he had the luxury to afford.
Nat didn't look like she believed him, not really, but at least she didn't voice that, only putting a hand on his.
"I've told you to call me Steve a hundred thousand times," Steve got used to Thor's antics by then, but they still bickered a lot about it. "And you have no reason to stay, but now I feel like I could finally do something else."
"You hated it," Tony could sense it from Steve's painful expression. "You wanna go back as fast as possible because you can't stand the thought of spending one more minute with me-"
And after just about 10 minutes, she realized that the Grandmaster would only transfer so much credit to her if she gave him a spectacular show. Which, to Loki's misfortune, meant that she suggested magically dueling Loki, and the Grandmaster was
"To get something you lacked as a child. When your parents clearly were capable to give it, yet they withheld that from you. You feel cheated, so you cheat others. Kind of not that complex of a character, aren't you."
“Tony, I wanted you since I first time saw you. It took everything to not knot you when you were in Heat, but I couldn’t because it wouldn’t have been… right.”
"Is that what he'd told you?" Groot asked Quill. "And you believed him? I thought you were supposed to be a kid of a con-man."
And Quill then not only hit Ronan because he wanted him off, but because of Yondu too, and that would have only earned him a worse beating too if Rocket didn't step between them.
"I think I begin to sense that," Quill gave Rocket a smile, who seemed irritated at first, but then his complaining didn't fit the fondness he addressed Groot with.
"Under different circumstances, I would have, but since I just had to dump Friday, there is a lot of work I need to-" Tony started, but was interrupted by Bucky.
"As your friend, I gotta be honest: you seem in desperate need of one if you pay off cripples just to spend some time with you."
But Tony had no clue. And when he just sat there, temporarily forgetting to even work on Rhodey's braces because he was confused, Rhodey shook his head.
Tony just gave a "what did I tell you?" look to Steve, who couldn't help but laugh.
"Was this your objective then, Friday? Locking us in, riling us up, until neither of us can stand to stay in a room with each other ever again?"
"That's the key to a lie too, by the way," Bruce was now even trying to change the subject for Loki's sake.
"You can do that?" and the Captain seemed truly impressed, unlike the Aesir who believed that someone using magic was a sign of physical weakness. "That's kind of cool. So what, are you going to become a human?"
If there was one thing that Howard Stark didn't like, it was when people were "weak".
"I'm not."
“Old enough to know better. But it’s not a lie. I’m good. I have certain… privileges. I’m allowed to do them, so I’m also capable of… losing them, if you know what I mean,” Omega Gods, even marginally mentioning the truth to an Alpha when Tony knew there won’t be any repercussions felt extreme. Despite how he only dared to do it because he knew nothing would change. “So please, I’m begging you. Take me back. Now.”
"I expect he wanted to do that for a long time. And he could have used his magic or the staff on me, or just picked any of his favorite knives that would have done more damage, but he didn't, so if anything, I should be grateful," Thor mused.
And if Loki wasn't allowed to generate mayhem, the second best thing was a worthy opponent to fight and infiltration. He even enjoyed his missions with the mortals - although he made sure to complain left and right about them, lest they suspect.
"How long was I green?"
Also, the pull he felt for Tony could no longer be just the byproduct of their biology, but it was still there. Different, but better as far as Steve was concerned, because what remained of their connection was something that they've built together back when they were dating. Which meant that if anything went wrong or changed that was beyond their control, they could still correct it in a way that wasn't.
And it worked even though both of them knew what the real intent was behind, because as Barnes pointed out, Loki enjoyed not knowing Bucky's dark secret just yet, and it's not like he couldn't take it from him any day later when he got bored of Bucky's tactics.
"You can practice on me."
And how? Well, that was the ingenious part of Loki's plan if he did say so himself, even though understanding his wit would have been only possible if anybody had at least as good of an understanding of magic as he did, and there was no one fitting that description, but alas.
"That's true," Friday agreed.
"I... think this is the closest I got to ever watching a game." And it's not a lie, he knows squat about sports.
"Can't. But if you truly teleported without a Sling Ring, maybe I could teach you to control it."
The Avengers did not comment on Loki's appearance in the Tower later, only Thor interacting with him by giving him a crushing hug, but then the others had their ways to let him know they noticed his presence.
It was absurd, but also very Steve, and it at least made Stark shut up, while Loki ran a crude diagnostic spell, cursing Odin that he never encouraged Loki to use his magic to heal people, only for fighting.
"I wouldn't want you any other way," Tony told Rhodey.
“My spare phone, what else,” Rocket said from the door. “And I have all sorts of subscriptions but also music, so you’re welcome.”
So when Hulk bought a colorful string on the market one day, and then pulled it on the floor as if expecting Thor to do something with it, Thor tried to figure out what it was just to make him happy.
"Now see, that where you're wrong," Quill couldn't help but laugh. "He threatened to get me back to the system every single time when I was a kid and I did something he didn't like... only kept me because people suspected a "widowed father" less to con them, and-"
All cheerful and seemingly high on adrenalin.
So even though Tony never went back to the psychologist, he knew he was proven wrong once again. And if she was right about his friends, she was probably right about other things too.
"Leaving, I thought it was obvious."
Steve, on the other hand, wasn't sure.
“Ah, you know how it is,” Tony tried to force a smile, but when Steve only looked at him with concern, he gave up on that idea fast. “I mean, you don’t, but he’s the best. I’m very lucky to be serving someone like him.”
"Yes. He sustained quite an injury just to save me. I was overwhelmed and exhausted and didn't even notice I backed into a weapon, so if not for him, I'd probably be dead," and the Captain either didn't care that Loki was trying to claw his hand off, or was too preoccupied to notice. "And not only that, but even after, he fought the Chitauri and protected the civilians."
Steve was shocked when Tony began to undress him, and then too turned on to do anything about it. So when Tony impatiently undressed too and started to rub them together just the right way, Steve only encouraged it by taking them both in his hand, enjoying it when it made Tony growl in appreciation, giving Steve a look full of lust and desire.
But then, Loki spent some time with the humans, and he had to figure that when it came to emotions, the Aesir weren't that different, just had longer lives to play out the same pre-written scripts of life, everyone just playing a part.
"I chose one on the other side of the country to get away from my parents," Rocket just gave him a sad smile.
The only way Tony could not involuntarily surrender the entire story in front of
"I'm sorry, what, could you repeat that, Mr. Stark?" one journalist asked, making Tony smile.
"And this has nothing to do with the fact that all the basketball team members are both insanely athletic and simply gorgeous," Maria points out, giving him a knowing look. "And you could be around them for a while since you've just said yourself, it's not easy to interview all of them at once..."
Actually, Loki wouldn't admit, but this lowly creature had a quicker brain than probably Odin and Thor combined, which was admittedly a low bar, but still pleasantly refreshing.
"This would be so much easier if you were a kitten," Bruce told him. "And you should know, I'm not into men in general, so I have no idea how to do this... but Hulk and I both agree that we kinda... like you."
"Why do you even care?"
"My data shows you should have a seat and talk. I could guide you through a number of exercises that might help you to open up."
Loki couldn't decide whether the Captain was toying with him, and mortals really kept these strange things as companions, or this was just a trick for Loki to humiliate himself, but he had an idea.
He wanted to tackle Captain America out of the way, claiming he was attacking him, but only when he got there did he realize he didn't have the time to do that.
"Of course you didn't," Rocket told him. "But I'm telling you right now. If you want to survive this semester, you better keep out of Ronan's way and just pray he'll forget you even existed. And I'm telling you this as a friend, not a threat."
"Where did you get that cat?" Loki only asked narrowing his eyes on Thor, as if he planned any of this.
"You know, sometimes I'm convinced he likes you better."
"I'm going to make a box for you Super-legs just to put a warning label on it saying you shouldn't try to lift vehicles with it," in a way, it was funny too, because usually, Tony was the reckless one, and Rhodey tried to talk him out of it.
"The next time you do something like this, you should mean it, Stark, or you might be in for a surprise," he told Tony, who only gave him a fake smile.
"When was the last time you didn't just preheat something?" Bucky told him. "A month? A year? Ten? Do you even have a recollection of how food that didn't come out of a box looks like?"
"But if you don't let me recap everything for you: I'm truly sorry about everything, but I'm here now."
"Oh, and I'd be on top. You might have more money than me, and-"
"I meant to say that the online perception of you is that you're nice."
"You had been already useful, are you kidding me? Taking the Stone from Jane, telling us where to find it in the first place... Besides, I'm not a child just because I'm not a mythological god, I'm a scientist who can calculate the risks, and I'm telling you, I want to do it."
It was then not only Loki's curiosity that he continued to pull misery from Tony but also a "justified" motion. Loki was a deity, and if he could help mortals so much through Stark by taking so little action (doing something he had always done for others with not much effect, nor was it then his choice whom to support), then he had to, right?
He even made a self-deprecating joke, making Loki smile.
"When it's us, there's always something, isn't it?" Steve could only give him a small, bittersweet smile.
"And she only likes me because she knows I'm the exception to the rule."
"That wasn't me flirting," Nat quickly said before he could tell her. "Just me telling you that in a world where there isn't a chance the find the perfect match anymore, you're quite a catch."
"You want to have penetrative sex, ‘rewarding’ me with it," Steve only then realized. "Get out."
"You'd be only too lucky if I wanted to have someone like you, who can't even keep a six-month-old child safe..." Loki wasn't happy about that.
When he reached the elevator up to the Tower and Steve was still following him closely without a word, Bucky's breathing and heart-rate returned to normal, he regretted not handling the situation better, as Steve must have as well because he was giving him lost puppy eyes.
"Maybe you aren't so boring either, after all," the Grandmaster laughed cheerfully, bringing Bruce back to the room Loki was kept as well. "Maybe you could even fight each other. Or, the two of you could try to face the witch. I'll try to decide which one should we do next week."
"She said it will never happen. I've placed a good enough sum against her, because never is a long time," Rocket shrugged. "But my point is-"
“Alright, but they better let you go.”
Nobody touched Tony without malicious intent, and… what? There was something about this Steve that was so unusual.
"Stop talking before I change my mind," Bruce warned, but when Loki only grinned in turn, he didn't.
"I was right, everyone pay up!" was all Tony said, while Clint, Rhodey, and Bruce were paying him, mildly annoyed. "Welcome back you two! And congratulations. Just don't polish each other's hammer in the kitchen, or anywhere near the food we eat. Also, don't break up soon, because there's also a bet on that."
"My name is Steve. And no, but I have a bike, and I trust you can figure out the rest once you're better."
And she laughed, even if that was only to make him feel better. An almost laughable concept in itself, yet, as Vision had found, when it was Wanda who was smiling or laughing at him like that, it worked.
Happier than since years, even though most people on the street hadn't even noticed him, and Nat got quite furious with him because Steve hadn't told her what he was gonna do.
"Really? Because I mean it..."
"Nostalgic, are we?"
Found a spell that wasn't exactly harmful, but could end the "duel" with Loki's immediate win right before the witch could get a chance to hurt Loki, which seemed like a good plan.
"I'm had the therapy, and now I'm an Alpha, Tony."
Steve was disorientated and could not see, sure, but still could use his Alpha voice on him. Commanding Tony to fall asleep. And then, darkness took him.
Thor gave a dissatisfied noise hearing that nickname, but Hulk must have been right and he needed to sleep badly because once his hunger ebbed, he was already halfway there.
“He had 4 Stones?” Steve pointed out. “It’s a miracle you could even engage him. I couldn’t. Not really...”
Then, Loki was on a spaceship, when Strange appeared. He threw a knife at him without thinking, but it passed through.
, so if you had a problem, you could have already told me in private. The fact that you didn't, only shows you know you messed up."
"You have 5 minutes to get over yourself and put on your tux, or you're coming like this," Gamora threatened.
And hell, it was killing Tony but he couldn't push of Rhodey didn't want it. So he kept working on the suit, and on Mark 41508 (or at least that's what it felt like), he deemed it worthy to show Rhodey as his birthday present.
"I mean, if you wanted, you could bring me some."
"And if this isn't just pity..." Strange started because he didn't want that.
Not only did he get to see a magical duel, but he also made sure to note to Loki that if he didn't win, he'd fall out of favor. Technically, Loki had an escape plan out of the planet should something go wrong, but he didn't want to leave just yet.
“If this is supposed to be a pep talk I don’t see the silver lining just yet,” Steve said.
But when he did, he told them so far what they were watching was shit, "had to" educate Steve how any popcorn coming from the microwave wasn't worth eating, and then proceeded telling Bucky he shouldn't learn about how this century worked from a man who didn't even know it himself.
"I believe the term was 'beings whose humor was synthetic too'," Vision mentioned, with another faint smile.
“Is that…?”
"Yes, in fact, I would. Just not here, as I've said."
Quill hated his new school. It was a prestigious school where there was Latin on the curriculum, the students their uniforms correctly, and they always had not only toilet paper but also soap, the fanciest freshener, and a stack of real towels on the loo.
However, Strange misunderstood him.
But that also meant Steve and Tony were no longer compatible.
"I think I've just come up with one," she told Vision in her last moments. "What will the villains of this galaxy see just before their well-deserved death?"
So when Loki didn't have more magic, he started depleting his life force, using "red" magic, which was red because the caster used his or her blood as a last resort. Casting spells that took years off from the caster's lifespan, but unmatched in power.
"Enlighten me, what are they?"
He woke up in a real bed - inhaling an Alpha’s scent that was way too pleasant, so he thought he was still dreaming. Only when he blinked open his eyes and saw Steve’s regretful face close did he remember, and part of him wished he didn’t.
"Yes, but you did teach me how to cast an illusion, and use the gaps between reality to hide anything, so all I did was just combine the two, and hide while keeping the illusion up-"
"I didn't mean it for missions."
"Well, that might be an advantage then. Maybe you should show a little bit of that side of Cap as well."
There was simply no way Steve would accept that. He used the sanitizer and fast healing foam Tony had used on Bruce before. Alerted Friday that they will need a Quinjet for transportation and Dr. Cho should prepare the new Regeneration Cradle.
"Only prefers to annoy me more, probably, ever since I shrugged him off the first time we've met," Tony surmised, while the cloak only patted his shoulder, making Stephen laugh.
Bucky would have questioned why shouldn't they try to wait the program out, but given how the other two acted, he only took a couple of steps back, gathered some speed, and delivered a punch right in the middle of the door, using his whole body weight behind his metal fist.
In his line of work, Loki's reputation was as good as his livelihood. You couldn't be a proper villain if you were a laughing stock, after all.
“No, I’m just-”
Those who turned completely dark had been suffering constantly for decades, so it wasn't usually born out of nothing, as the stories sometimes would lead you to believe.
Like Wong's horrified face when instead of knocking on the Sanctum's door again, Stephen magicked himself in.
The last thing Thor needed was to be given to the Grandmaster - again! just - as a pet now. Who knows what that lunatic would do with a small beast. Maybe even eat him or something.
"It flies," Tony finally revealed. "I figured you could be a better help to the army piloting a flying suit than with SuperLegs."
“You don’t know that.”
Loki still avoided Thor every time his brother tried to pet him, but otherwise acted like a well-behaved cat with everyone else.
Falling for thirty fucking minutes.
“Why not? I promise to be very gentle. At first. If that's what you like. If not then-"
"That Barnes was the mortal and you were the god in your relationship," Stark finished the line of thought. "The cat to your dog. The Watson to your Sher-"
"I mean, we weren't exactly talking, so..."
"So how did you like the movie?"
"Just sit somewhere else!" Quill told him. "I'll be out of this school in weeks if not any day now, anyway, I'm not worth it."
"Maybe, maybe not. But you gotta let me try," Banner said.
"Right after you told me what I needed to hear. Not even my mother could bring herself to do it, not to the degree you did at least."
"Exactly!" Quill was confused. "How is that any proof? If anything, it's as Ronan says, and I had a nefarious plan to seduce you..."
"And let me guess: Wade is bad news and we don't like him," Steve surmised.
"What? No!" Tony told him, but his carefree chatter was good as gone. "If you must know, there is something I never told anyone, but-"
" Steve told him, and when Tony looked at him, only shook his head. "Nevermind. It just reminded me of something that happened a long time ago."
"Wait, so you're saying you
“Because I’m the one who gets angry?”
"Besides, Rocket doesn't even like me like that," Quill was pretty sure, although by then he had an inkling that Rocket might not be straight.
"Oh no, you could just teleport yourself upstairs, or a couple of meters to any direction," the Doc insisted, so Tony closed his eyes, and tried to remember the
that Friday was right, but even if she was, it hardly matters."
"If you truly want to know and not just listen to your own voice speaking, try to let me figure it out first, would you," Tony was frustratedly typing away, cursing under his breath.
"I mean, not that I was looking for any. But seen some players post about everything and anything, and that's not a good idea either, believe me..."
"If I'm lying about not trying to trick you, I can give you a false reason you know," Loki already felt tired just thinking about justifying all his decisions, and they hadn't even started just yet.
“But-“
“I can’t… I won’t let you go back there, Tony. Even if I lose my job, I could really care less. If I’d let this slide once, what’s the guarantee that I won’t do it again?”
"Who wouldn't," Phil tries, but then Cap comes up to him.
"Not my feelings for you. I don't care how, I don't care if we fight a lot as two Alphas would. I can even undergo surgery if you want an Omega. Just say yes."
"It's only for one night, you understand. I can't take any of them as lovers, so..." Loki wasn't fooling neither himself nor Bucky with that excuse, but it was also okay when Barnes shut him up with a kiss that was almost better than Loki's memories.
He didn't count on Hulk stripping naked for the night, but also taking Thor with him to his bed instead of leaving him on the blankets like the last time.
"I could teach you so many things," he was telling Loki, who only dared himself to not react, in the hopes that it would discourage the topic, but it wasn't working. "Things I'm sure not even the Aesir know about. I could take you to new highs you didn't even dare to dream of..."
“STEVE!” Tony yelled, and the Alpha burst into the room, despite how he was told he wasn’t allowed. “We’re leaving.”
How he'd "give birth" to this newly formed Nebula copy who would be physically a child, but mentally having all her memories were a different matter, but...
"There is definitely some attraction, although I can't say how much."
can't even trust I have your back. God knows Stark will never trust me and who can blame him, Natasha keeps waiting for a good enough reason to eliminate me, and don't get me started on Fury because..."
"Let's fix it then, Walter," Tony didn't want to drop everything just to type this in, so he muttered it still barely audible, but this was the first time he got an amused smirk from Bucky.
"I think I've... better things to do, see you," Clint left, just as most people have followed his example.
"At this moment, I suspect neither am I - not completely," Loki noted.
"Careful with what you're calling crappy," Tony gave him a warning. "But I think I'm finally over it. After all, when I've completely gone off the rails, and you both held me I don't think I've ever felt so... recognized before? Safe, although I wasn't wearing a suit? I don't want to say warm, it sounds like something only a clingy perv would say, but-"
"You won't tell Steve such bullshit," now Barnes wasn't just hesitant to leave, but he only came back to Loki's bedside, his glare so intense, that it was almost funny.
"I don't know. But that's the point. If you like me and not just feel some misplaced gratitude that I took you in, I'd like to figure it out first. With you."
And maybe Stark thought he was still being a bitch about a spell he used himself or took it as a sign of how the extracurricular part of their arrangement should be ended, because he never approached Stephen suggestively again after that, and that was good.
They aren't helping when the whole gang is laughing at him, and Maria sarcastically notes "who could have seen this coming?", and now Natasha is laughing so hard her tears are falling, and Clint isn't far behind.
Except, he wasn't. Suddenly, pain seared through him like hot lava, emerging from his abdomen, but radiating everywhere so badly, that he ended up on the floor, right next to his victim.
Phil carries on unperturbed.
That’s why it was so strange when Obadiah came to Tony’s workshop, and relocated him to a much nicer room, made his other "spare" Omega called Pepper dress Tony in a fancy suit, and threatened Tony.
"It's only thanks to you, Captain."
"Tony, is it true?" Steve, of course, was offended. "What she's saying?"
Steve's predictions of the world not needing superheroes but common folk who were still willing to take a part came true, so when Bruce had "cured" himself, and now only became the Hulk if he chose to, and mentioned that in the meanwhile he also cracked how Steve could be turned back to himself, he was just telling it as a joke, but Steve's mind kept on working on that.
"Oh no you won't," Strange stood between him and the door. "The powers that child carries are essential to the Sanctums. I won't let you just simply walk away with it."
"Aww, and you say the sweetest things, hon," Loki only hoped that payback was fair, and Strange would hate that nickname just as much as he did before.
"So you know who he is," Loki said. Already cloning himself with a simple illusion and sneaking behind Barnes, but Barnes might have expected that from their previous encounters because he was alertly positioning himself in the only place of the room where he couldn't be surprised that way. "But I'm not here to kill you."
"Happy Birthday. Tell the military they can reimburse me for it later..."
"A classic, hiding behind Pepper now, are we?"
"So I can directly contact you if the planet's under attack and we need your help."
"I live here," Tony would have told him with some edge in his voice, but still couldn't, which meant more typing. "It's meant to be so safe if a conventional army came through the windows the implemented security measures should identify them as hostiles and get rid of them without me lifting a finger. But I had to disable some functions a couple of weeks ago, and with this new code, I could get them back."
"Fun times indeed," Loki couldn't help himself.
"Tiny and Hulk: best friends."
"Only if you're interested in something like that," Bucky told him without a blink. "I came here to tell you-"
"For what it's worth, you saved us by showing up just on time," Steve said.
"Buck, I'm sorry. You're the most important person to me, no matter what. But you have to tell me things, so I don't have to find out like this," Steve ran after him, and everyone in the bar was openly staring at them, but Bucky didn't care.
"It's okay, the cat's out of the bag anyway," Bucky softly kissed him, and Steve couldn't help but instantly think how just a second ago it was Tony he was kissing. "We could use the time to regroup if you're still in."
"It's the young of a dog. And if anyone saw you, I could just say you ran away in the Battle, and I'm only keeping you until I find you a home. It's perfect. You could even leave this room without anyone suspecting," and Steve typed in "puppy" to a magical device, and produced pictures of the said animals.
"What the hell, Tony, seriously?!" Steve went up to them, expecting Bucky to be as shocked as he was, or get a little bit upset, something. Instead, he wasn't.
Except, this time, even this unimaginable power was handled by Thanos, and Loki was starting to wonder if all this was for naught. If Doctor Strange and Wanda hadn't shown up to save the day then, with Thor giving them a hand, Loki would have died for nothing.
"People count on you."
"You need to recover, and I need to complete your braces-"
Funny, because with Barnes, even when Loki tried to make himself look bad on purpose, he only got understanding, and only got Bucky angry when he saved his life despite Bucky telling him no.
"Disciplines spend decades learning magic, and you can't attend the meeting anyway..."
“Then I don’t want to make you unnecessarily uncomfortable, Steve, so just don’t fret about it too much, ‘kay?” Tony kissed him, and Steve was both pleased to have Tony just looking at him the way he was at the moment, and still felt somewhat disappointed that Tony didn’t even seem to want to try it the other way around, not even once.
"You know how pro teams also have trading cards, showcasing their players, and stuff like that, right? Also, players endorsing products? So I was thinking, maybe we could have a smaller version of that. Selling posters and merchandise with..."
"I can't go to the gym 24/7, and Fury can't find me here," Bucky offered and explanation with a small shrug. "He keeps insisting I need to 'talk to a professional' of his choosing, threatening to not let me do missions or go outside until I do."
Before he didn't see his stepfather as a man, so of course, his actions and motives were beyond what Loki would dare to question, even on the deep corners of his mind.
"You most definitely right," Tony agreed. "I like it this way the best."
But it would also mean that he'd risk the magic controlling him if he didn't succeed in controlling the magic. It was a dangerous step in the evolution of any magical, and even when you did it once, pulling such energy and using your body to channel it was forever risky.
The whole thing started when Quill got to the school for rich kids, like Gamora, whose father was one of the most famous politicians in the country.
"Aaand I didn't even give him SuperSpeak," Tony only muttered to himself, ignoring how the horde of reporters were all simultaneously trying to ask Tony and Rhodey questions.
"Really?" Steve doesn't look convinced, and Peter is overselling it, so Phil quickly jumps in.
"I have thought about it a lot. And this body is just as much of a different person to me as the Hulk was to you. So if there's any way for me to get back and not die in my original form, I want to do it, Bruce," Steve was ready to beg if he had to, but he was understood just by the way he said it.
"Sounds to me as if you wish you didn't," Nat seemed to be worried about him then, so Steve quickly had to take even that hint of truth back. She had enough on her plate with Clint now, he didn't want to pile up on it, and for no good reason too.
"Call me Steve. And... could you maybe advise me about that? I know you're busy, but if I wrote a post I wasn't sure about..."
"Ha, that's new," Bruce noted then asked. "And just for the record, now you're not a cat, and I'm still very much naked and in the same bed as you so... nothing happened?"
"It's not... a joke."
"I couldn't," Tony agreed. "So I only hired and assigned him as her assistant, and I'm only biding my time until they realize-"
"You had a girlfriend before your accident?" Stark misunderstood.
"Even living in the caves as a madman, but still going strong because of all the energy I have on Asgard as a deity is still better than-"
Just one time, when Stark came to talk to him, Loki took his pain, self-doubt, and constant worry, and wondered if it would have any impact on how productive Stark could be that day at all.
"To do exactly what?" Strange didn't know what Stark was on about but had a wild guess that he won't like it.
"Are you kidding me? You're a space pirate now."
Given how tiny his new form became, all distances seemed to only multiply. And everything he would use to orientate himself was also too far away, he got lost fast.
He could bring Bucky to the Tower by not taking no for an answer, but he couldn't force the others to suddenly befriend him, nor Bucky to do anything he didn't want, when he has been already through too much.
"Not how I planned my morning," Bucky then told Steve, looking at him with an almost sad smile.
And after that Rhodey took the suit flying for about a whole 10 seconds in the garage before he asked if he could take it out on the open for real, and Tony sat down with a coffee, scrolling down on Twitter for the longest time until Rhodey had returned.
And the person sitting next to him might have been a super-soldier, a tactical advisor, a mentor to the kids, but at that moment, he was also just Steve, as he was when he was just a teenager and his mom died, and Bucky would have done everything to cheer him up.
"The money isn't bad," Steve looked at him with searching eyes. "If you have time to spend it."
And Phil did. He didn't expect the team to suck in front of a camera this much after all the selfies he'd seen in his research, and Peter no doubt helped, but...
Back before Ultron, he could move the hammer somewhat, but didn't want to disappoint Thor or any of the others who couldn't... but now was an emergency, and even though Steve changed so much and he feared how it might not work, when he got separated from Thor and the guards have cornered him, too twitchy to listen to how Steve meant no harm, Steve didn't have much to lose.
"He's my best friend, and my adopted brother," Groot told Quill as if reading his mind. "But he can be too much, sometimes, even unintentionally."
It wouldn't have worked if Loki didn't know that the Captain meant every word and if... it didn't remind Loki of how being a Jotun in Asgard felt like.
