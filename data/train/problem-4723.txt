May sobs lightly against Steve’s shoulder. It’s a heartbreaking view, and Tony just can’t be a part of that. He averts his eyes, keeping his attention on Bruce who has discarded the charts to look some things up on the tablet he got from Tony about a year ago.
“Hmmm, you have no idea how much I love that,” Tony whispers against his mouth. Steve grins through the kiss.
staring. But he can’t. All he can really do is just sit there and wait for something to happen. He needs to focus, to concentrate. If he distracts himself with doing something, he’ll forget again. He doesn’t want to forget again.
She should call Steve! Yes, that was the best solution she had. But as soon as she took her phone, she remembered her friend was on some kind of mission. She could still call him, right? There was no problem with that. After scrolling through her phone for a bit, she found his name. But what if she’d distract him by calling and he got shot? That would be her fault, she couldn’t do that.
“It’s not his fault!” Tony finds himself almost shouting. Realizing that he’s shot up again, he slowly sits back down. Shit, Steve is really missing in this situation…
“I don’t know, maybe Lily or something. She’s kind of cute,” he jokes. Peter gives him an unimpressed look.
Hope and Scott are there as well. Hope’s skirt is shorter than the other’s. It’s black, accompanied with a yellow cape. Her leggings, too, are yellow. Her brown hair is put into a sideways pony. Scott has his usual grey, black and red.
“Don’t listen to him, he’s just joking around. Of course you and MJ will have a good time and who knows what it’ll become! You can only try!”
FRIDAY responds. Tony pushes himself back on his feet while he waits for the call to come through. It goes on and on, almost two minutes maybe. Tony doesn’t even expect for her to pick up anymore.
“But… why are we pretending?” Tony wonders. Mary huffs out a breath, clearly disbelieving. Tony just wishes they wouldn’t be arguing about this in front of the kids. He takes a quick look behind him, finding the girl crying against her older brother, while Peter is just glaring at the two of them. The middle-son ignores it all.
Steve relaxes then for a bit. “Oh, I’m sorry, where are my manners? Steve Rogers.” Steve holds out his hand, and Peter takes it.
The man checked on Yaël taking her prescribed sleeping pills too. These surely caused her to sleep and, by chance, stopped the wandering into memories, which Yaël kind of kept from sleeping since she panicked a bit as she thought about those. And one can’t sleep while stressing out about sleeping, right?
“He attracts danger to everybody he knows, Peter. He has enemies, and every moment you spend with him, is another moment where his tower is bombed by another revenge-mission or something like that,” Aunt May concludes. Peter takes another deep breath and lowers his shoulders for a bit.
Crap, he’s going to have to fall if he doesn’t want Mr. Stark to realize there’s something fishy going on here. Or spidery. Great.
The moment they touch down, glass seems to come from everywhere. Peter feels it cutting into his skin, leaving marks into places they shouldn’t be. There’s noise everywhere as the car slides forward, the roof scraping onto the asphalt, creating sparks everywhere.
“I understand,” Peter says. He doesn’t. But he can’t really care about that, now. He can’t be disappointed at Steve now. This isn’t the time for it. “I need to go.”
“Yes,” Scott sighed. “You stop to teach your classes, eat an apple, drink some water and then you always immediately come back to the gymnasium to train some more.” The fact that he was right, was annoying her.
She got in the shower, turned the water to some lukewarm temperature, which felt kind of cool to the rest of her skin, except for her burned shoulder. Yaël sat down and let the water stream over her.
After that, he turns off the screen and closes his eyes, figuring that the best way for time to fly is by sleeping it off. Meanwhile, in the back of his head, he thinks back over the message Natasha left for him.
“Same…” Peter mutters, but he figures that he’s got more friends than she does. Maybe he needs to introduce her to Ned one day. Though that could also lead to Ned meeting Wade, which could lead to Ned figuring out Peter is Spider-Man. Better not risk
“I know, I know. Stupid Idea, I should know better,” Tony admits. “I just… Peter wasn’t talking to me, you weren’t talking to me, the team was being secretive… I was miserable, and I just figured ‘who will even care?’… And before you start shouting at me, I know people will care, I was just in a bad headspace.”
On the fourth week, Peter handed in the first initial ideas he’s been working on in between helping Francis, only to find that, once again, Mr. Stark
Pepper sighs as Tony walks forward. There’s a greeting for Clint (“Hey birdbrain.”), followed by Sam (“Hola Birdbrain two-point-oh.”), to which he gets flipped off for by both men. Natasha simply nods at him.
“There’s just not a simple ‘solution’, Tony. It’s just something I must figure out on my own. And I know you want to help, and I admire you for that, but you
“How about we take a holiday, huh? During Christmas break? After New Year?” Tony asks. Peter shakes his head.
Peter gives her green eyes a long look, taking in the by-now familiar face that comes with the Black Cat. Her dark mask is still in place, surprisingly sticking where Peter thought it would have fallen off easily.
“Uh, in an airplane, about to leave,” he offers as vaguely as he can. Tony just smirks across from him.
“Yeah, uh, I’m not really the leader of the group, that’s something we mostly leave for Steve,” Tony says. He can remember going to battle yesterday. There was an argument, Peter was there, and so was Steve. But Tony can’t remember they were fighting against a scientist? Jesus, he needs to find out what’s going on.
“It’s ohso quiet, tudududuu, tudududuuu…It’s oh, so still…” Yaël sang to herself just to see her breath in the cold air. How long was she standing here? She was feeling a bit sad. Why couldn’t she just enjoy an evening without getting herself into trouble? She felt like, like…like she needed a permanent babysit or something, but she was an adult, right? It wasn’t her problem that those guys were stupid idiots filled with testosterone!
“I know how hard you’ve been having it, Peter,” she starts suddenly, looking at him with her sad eyes. “It’s been such a rough time for you, and you had trouble getting back on track, but you found your way back all on your own. I’m so proud of you;”
Somehow, Peter managed to finish his school-year. He didn’t experience it, mostly living in a blur at the thought that Gwen wasn’t there anymore. The school had come together to memorialize her, but Peter hadn’t gone. He had been at Gwen’s grave, instead.
“You know I can see you, right?” MJ suddenly asks without moving her head. Peter feels his face redden. Johnny simply laughs.
So, Nilla had been kind or right. Agostina, their mom, had been a traitor towards the Queen, because she had been on Odin’s side instead on Hela’s. And to make sure people would stop looking at Hela as Odin’s daughter, the one that had slaughtered thousands, Hela had changed her name. Yaël sighed.
By the time he gets there, he’s welcomed by Wanda and Vision, the former smiling at him. He’s never really seen Vision smile, though, and wonders if he’s even able to.
The phone call stops, and all Tony can then see is a picture he’s only seen shortly in passing. Peter never really likes to show it, uneasy to talk about it. And even now it feels slightly like he’s invading his privacy, but Tony still finds himself staring at the picture in the background.
“C’mon hot-shot, let’s get you home,” he mutters, throwing Johnny over his shoulder. The guy complains with a tired grunt, but snores on the entire way out of the house. That guy, the one who organized the party but which Peter can’t remember the name of, waves at him and drunkenly tells him he’ll see him tomorrow. Peter doubts that, but he doesn’t voice his thoughts.
That’s how the weeks went on; Yaël went to work and played some cello and she saw her friends every now and then. Well, Wade still walked in whenever he liked too, and so did Wanda after a while, just to hang out. Wanda was one of these friends you don’t need to constantly talk to to be good friends with. So most of the time, when Wanda came over, she just got sick of the business of the compound, brought a book and just sat down and read a bit.
Peter’s turned around by a confused Dr. Strange. The man next to him holds up his glowing hands as if he’s ready to defend himself.
“Biochemistry,” he says proudly. “Though I’ve taken a few classes for electrical engineering as well. I like to combine things.”
“But, Dad, I’m ready for more than that now!” Peter complains. Because it’s true; he can do so much more. Especially now with the suit! Give him another Electro, or Lizard! He can take them all down!
Well, Peter would have expected Mr. Morita to say this. Instead, it’s Mr. Stark who marches up towards Wolverine and glares at him as if his look could kill him.
“Whatever! You don’t have to repeat it all the time, man!” Scott complains, sad that his joke has failed once again. Peter will never let him have that one, because Scott’s just fun to mess with. As Tony deals in the cards again, Steve turns towards Peter.
Peter looks away in embarrassment. There’s no reaction from Tony who is closing down his programming and leans back in his chair, grabbing his cup of coffee which surely has gotten cold now. He takes one sip, then stops and glares at his cup before putting it down again.
“Hell yeah,” Yaël whispered at herself as she prepared herself for the next battle. Thor used to have the tendency of looking down at her, calling her ‘just one of Loki’s toys’. But during this fight, Thor hadn’t shown his arrogance yet, which she could get used to.
“Hi, Mary,” Tony greets the woman in front of him. She looks just like he remembers her, with straight brown hair cut short, dark eyes radiating the friendliness she’s holding inside herself. There’s her mouth that he recognizes in Peter now, along with the forehead. Tony finds his breath catching upon seeing her.
“Where’s Tony?” Peter asks with a cracking voice. He rubs his eyes, letting out a yawn. Then he turns back towards his Aunt, who is still seated on the bed looking relieved.
“Your name sounds familiar, are you family of anybody I know?” Tony asks, wondering why the name is bringing up something in him, and cursing because he can’t place it at all. What’s wrong with his super-brain lately?
“Alright, I’ll get everybody ready,” Loki then says. He turns back towards Steve. “You should join your family, take a seat before all the good ones are taken.” There’s a grin on his face, though it doesn’t look mischievous. Steve nods, bowing slightly before turning into Tony’s direction. Then, before he goes, he stops in his steps, giving Yaël a short look.
. He wasn’t going to cling onto her, right? Well, he had never done that before, so that was so not going to happen now.
“Uh, yeah, no, that guy might be a dick sometimes but he’s a friend,” Peter returns, pointing behind him to the hurt body of Dr. Strange, who is trying to get himself back on his feet. “And we don’t really take kindly to people hurting our friends.”
“You come asking for help?” Natasha asks in disbelief, letting go of Barnes and walking forward. She looks menacing, so Tony prepares himself. “After all you’ve done, you want us to just help you?”
Miles thinks back of his little Samsung phone. It was the best one back in its day, but it’s pretty outdated now, and the screen’s been replaced more than a couple of times. Miles often drops it on the ground, after all.
“In case you’ve missed it, I have to be in Wakanda regarding the accords tomorrow. So, until then, the AI and the Vision will be on it.”
“No, idiot, to the medical center firstly and then to your new room.” Right, she didn’t have a place to stay anymore. All her stuff, her cello, her new clothes, her sofa, they were all gone.
Taking a crouched position, the girl goes towards a roof-window and gives it a light tug. It doesn’t budge,  but that doesn’t seem to throw her off. Instead, she takes something out of her utility belt and places it on the window. Much to his surprise, he recognizes the technology the moment she activates it.
Yaël woke up in her tent, which colored red by the sunlight… as usual. After wandering around in Oslo for a little while, she decided to buy a tent and some camping gear, so she’d be able to go wherever she wanted to. When she firstly arrived at the Lofoten Islands, she had cursed that poor life’s decision as the summer was the time of the year when the sun apparently didn’t go down around the Lofoten Islands. So the first few days, Yaël had to get used to fall asleep while the sunlight was still lightening her tent.
“We know you don’t want to give him the burdens that rested on your shoulders at his age, but with his youth he might actually bring in some interesting stuff,” Blondie points out.
After that, they put up the next commercial break. It’s once again surprising, since Tony would have expected it to be over once the winner has been chosen. They’re all called off the stage while the people start cleaning up Peter’s stuff. They’re once again handed bottles of water, and Peter’s given a white robe. He takes off the wig at last, handing it to Johnny who gives it a funny look.
“No way.” Johnny is slumping in his seat, clearly unhappy with the sudden turn of events. “Is this because of the crap that happened in Lagos? I mean, it’s bad, of course, but it’s not our fault!”
to do all he says now, anymore. Not since Tony tweaked her code a little bit after the Goblin incident.
While walking towards the automatic doors, Yaël understood that what she was about to do, was lower than low. It was going to be repulsive, no wait,
“He likes it,” Tony returns. “By the end of the year I figure he’ll have two more degrees to add to that first one.”
“Uh, hello, Darcy,” Steve returns hesitantly. Darcy smirks until her teeth are bare, and then she puts a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
He doesn’t even realize he’s flying. One moment they’re still at the bank, and the other he’s back in the tower, the mask of the suit pulled away from him. Tony doesn’t even look at the black suit, instead guiding his boy back inside.
“What the-?” he starts, noticing the picture on the front page. It doesn’t seem possible, but it’s very recognizable. He can see himself – or Spider-Man, rather. There’s a shim next to him on the picture, the face faded due to movement but the rest of her body clear enough to show who it is.
Mary must be seeing the expression on his face. Through her tears she starts shaking her head while reaching out her hands towards him.
“Are you still on about how you’re best friends with Tony Stark, huh? You, what, they’re mascotte, now? Do they get you to clean their suits back there at their building?”
“Is Peter here? I can’t imagine he would have wanted to miss coming here?” Steve asks instead, guiding the conversation a whole other way.
“HEY!” Tony complains. Steve points towards Peter when the engineer leans up. Peter just gives him a wave. “Peter? You’re back?”
“He had some other matters to attend to, regarding that friend of yours. They get along pretty well, I suppose,” Tony mutters. Peter feels his cheeks heat up again at the vague mention of Yaël, but Tony can’t see it, luckily. So, yeah, that’s going to be awkward for a little while…
“Oh, that’s awkward,” she states, ducking once and grabbing Peter by the arms to turn him around. With a trained movement he escapes out of that struggle, bringing some space between the two of them. “And now what?”
“Peter?” Tony asks, already pulling Peter’s mask off. The kid groans, kicking the debris that has fallen on him away and coughing painfully.
“No, no, I haven’t seen or spoken to Tristan after that one confrontation,” she assures him with a wink. “I guess… I never wanted to admit it, but I might have had feelings for Harry’s best friend for a while. I was just too proud – or scared, I don’t know – to admit it.”
“What’s that?” MJ asks all of the sudden. Peter looks to where she’s pointing, finding something… black? In the crater, it’s lying there. Looking like some sort of black goo perhaps? Peter’s about to get down and check it out.
Class goes slow, but eventually the bell rings and Peter throws his stuff back into his bag. When he stands up, he suddenly has two people looking at him, those being Ned and Harry.
“You loved her, didn’t you?” Peter asks, and Mr. Stark keeps his head down, instead downing his glass once more in one go. After that, he simply takes the bottle with him, and starts walking back towards the couch.
“Yeah, Tony told me where you two were so I thought I’d help out a bit,” Steve offers. Peter smiles but shrugs.
She knocked on the door and someone replied with “Uh, yeah?” Her hands pulled open the door. Yaël recognized Stark as soon as she saw him. He was talking on the phone but stopped for a second, since his mouth fell open as soon as he saw her. Yaël signed that he was still on the phone, so Stark started talking again, finishing his conversation.
"What counts is that you don't get shot at," Tony returns. "Besides, we pulled the names out of a goblet. Fate put the teams together."
is able to help him. More than Tony helped him, at least. Then again, Tony barely helped him since it’s because of him that he even was at that airport in Leipzig.
Peter’s expression shifts slightly, but not for long. He doesn’t wake up, though, so instead he sits down. Steve drops the box at his feet, leaning forward once more to kiss Tony’s cheek before heading back to the door.
“Yes, except for Steve, who is here,” Tony adds. Bruce whistles, a bit overwhelmed by the information.
“Just, make sure you guys don’t get possessed instead,” Peter urges through gritted teeth. Talking demands a lot of his attention. He’s not even aware of his own hand going up towards Steve, only realizing it when Steve lets out a painful grunt. Looking at his own fist in horror, Peter realizes he’s just punched him in the face.
Tony shrugs. “I’m not sure how I got married here,” Tony says, lifting up his hand and seeing the wedding ring missing. He’s not sure he even saw Mary wearing one. “Other me got married to the first girl I loved. She was actually in a relationship, but we had a drunken night where I knocked her up. In my universe, she never left her guy and married him. Here, though, it seems like she made the wrong choice.”
“What’s wrong, Peter?” aunt May asks, opening his door and raising her eyebrows when she finds him sitting on the bed.
“So, uh, how’s the food in-“ Peter can’t finish his sentence. His ear is suddenly filled with loud noises; an explosion, of sorts. He reaches for his ears, head feeling like it’s splitting apart. Meanwhile, under his feet, he’s pretty sure he can feel the ground shaking. Startled, he looks up to Harry who gives him the exact same worried expression.
“I’m not in the mood for sex tonight,” Steve returns, almost in a whisper. He keeps his eyes shut as Tony undresses him.
there’s no way for anybody to kill her except if you’re the Winter Soldier – and even he has failed at it so far.
“I did not!” Bucky slurs in return, crawling towards Steve but stumbling again. The two make a hilarious sight. Tony doesn’t regret this evening at all!
“C’mon! I’m sure you can arrange something with Mr. Stark about the internship! He’s your dad, after all,” Ned counters. Peter jumps forward and waves his hands at him while making a shushing sound.
Yaël immediately jumped out of the shower when she heard the blow. She climbed in some clothes and sprinted to the place where the noises came from. There he stood, shaking as he was staring at the hole in the ground.
“Guys, you can’t be serious,” Steve interjects with red cheeks. Yeah, he feels pretty embarrassed about it all, but that’s Steve for you. The only thing that makes this mostly horrible for Tony is the fact that their slightly sex-averse son had to find them in that position. And that after the whole demisexual-discussion they’ve had to completely understand how their son really worked.
“Not like I needed a driver’s license in space,” she tried to bitch back, but it sounded a bit weakly. Peter looked at her like he just saw her turn into the green creature everyone thinks about when you say the word ‘alien’, with eyes wide open. Cap, on the other hand, already knew she was an alien. He was just surprised she remembered it and he was probably putting the pieces together since she talked to him about her banishment the night before. “Oh yeah, apparently I’m an alien from outer space. Who knew, right?” she tried to sound uncaring about it, but that topic, too, was a big frustration. Her life was a big frustration.
Peter doesn’t think. He needs to just do. So he jumps into the air, higher than he would have expected. Swiftly, he lands on the black nets Venom has put together. MJ turns her head, startled by the sudden movement. Peter prepares himself for impending doom.
“Well, he seemed pretty annoyed at Rogers for some reason,” Happy says. “Kept telling how the guy didn’t care enough to come over, or something like that.”
“Yeah, well, being the son of Tony Stark I don’t need to identify myself all the time,” Peter mutters. Gwen laughs again, but she doesn’t wait until Peter follows to get inside.
“Stop doing what? Telling the truth? I thought you were all about the truth?” Tony asks him. Pepper wants to roll her eyes, let out an annoyed sigh, but she holds it in. She’s not weak, she can handle a few minutes of these two.
“Seriously, Peter. Fuck off,” she hisses at him. “Just… get your head straight, stop pushing everybody away. Maybe after that, we’ll talk.”
“Uh, I’m not sure yet,” Peter returns. They get out of the cab, splitting the bill as always. Then Johnny, surprisingly, throws an arm over Peter’s shoulder, acting like Peter hadn’t been acting like an ass the entire day.
They locked her up in a very white bedroom, with no windows, no colors, nothing…only a chair and a bed. Loki never did a thing to give her more freedom and after a while, Yaël understood that she had just been a prisoner. Sometimes, when the guards guided her through the metal, shiny alleys, to some sort of ‘trainingroom’, she could see Loki talking to a screen with a big purple mannish creature on it, which she heard Loki called Thanos.
“Hello?” he asks the moment he sees the first bit of brown hair show up. Appearing there, is a woman about Tony’s age, though with no bit of grey to find on her head. She’s dressed smartly, like she’s at the verge of going to a meeting or something. Though, the most striking thing is her face.
“You don’t have to do that, Steve,” Tony finally says. He takes his free hand and puts it on Steve’s cheek, finally giving him a small smile. Peter hides away his excitement, keeping himself from throwing his hands in the air in a victorious gesture. “We’ll figure it out after this weekend, okay?”
Peter waits until his hair is grown back to a size long enough to hide away the scars on his head. The first person he tells is May.
Aunt May isn’t home, running another shift at the hospital, once again working too hard to bring money on the table. It’s bothering Peter quite a lot, thinking how he’s got one sickeningly rich father who would be able to get them out of their troubles without any effort. The only problem is that said father has no idea he
FRIDAY says. Peter nods and sighs. When the door suddenly opens, Bruce (holding a large bowl) and another woman walk inside. The woman looks… strong. If anything, it seems like she feels probably a bit out of place, too.
“I’ll have FRI call you when it’s ready.” Peter waves at him before leaving the room. He runs into the elevator, thinking first about going to Pepper’s office but eventually thinking better of it. It Tony would ask where he is, FRIDAY would tell him. Besides, she might not even be at the tower right now. For all he knows, she’s back in LA. He doesn’t keep tabs on where Pepper is all the time.
“Oh, come on! Aren’t you getting tired of this?!” Peter shouts to the guy. The Goblin just laughs but otherwise doesn’t respond to him. Peter groans and throws his head back, not really keen on falling again. Sure, he’s still on his meds, but he doesn’t want to actively trigger himself into another panic attack.
Somehow, it’s Steve who seems opposed to that idea. “Yaël,” he somehow warns her, and Yaël holds up her hands in a questioning stance. Then she rolls her eyes.
Scott nods, and the two say their goodbyes to everybody before heading out of the room. Bruce then, too, comes to stand up.
So Peter does what he wouldn’t have expected to be doing. In a flash of something unexpected, he grabs her by the middle and throws himself over the roof. Swinging by two isn’t that hard, but it asks for a bit of adjustment. Peter doesn’t even recall the journey back to the apartment. Neither does he really remember what exactly happened afterwards.
Yet, having a Steve would be fun too. He’d be so mad at Wade, well, he would’ve preached to the psycho until Wade would’ve fallen asleep or something. But right now, her dear friend still thought she was dead…
Two hours later, after getting another positive feedback-form from Tony, it’s about time to head out at last. While Tony is out taking a quick shower, Peter hurriedly calls his Aunt to warn her that he won’t be coming home tonight. She assures him that it’s okay, since she has a night-shift at the hospital anyway. They make arrangement for tomorrow, and then Peter puts his phone aside again.
“Peter Parker,” Natasha calls out, still wearing her uniform. She has her hands on her hips and a murderous look on her face. Peter’s breath gets stuck in his throat, and for a short second he fears for his life. Johnny, too, seems frozen in place.
There are a few occasions when Steve joins Peter on patrol. Peter would then just swing around, and Steve follows him with his bike. Sometimes there's nothing for them to do. Today they had the chance of stopping another burglary before they were joined by Johnny and Wade and they went out for ice cream. It was fun, some long-needed bonding time.
“That looks good,” Tony says with a smile. He’s surprised when the man suddenly startles. The drawing pad flies out of his lap and drops onto the ground. The cup of water he’d been using to wet his brush tips over. “Shit, I didn’t mean to startle you!”
“The suit, I’m going to need it back,” Tony finally says. He hates himself for doing this, but it’s the only way.
But, then why didn’t it work with the meteor? He should have been warned about that beforehand, shouldn’t he?
he counters immediately. Tony just smirks and grabs Peter’s arm to take a good look at the web-shooters. Peter just hopes he doesn’t recognize the design from what Peter showed him at the interview. “Wh-what are you doing?”
She stared at him for a little moment, before pulling out her corset and dress, so she was only sitting in a thin shirt and an underskirt. The real Yaël cocked an eyebrow as she suddenly remembered very vividly that no man was supposed to see her like that on Helvegen. It was kind of funny to see her that former-self wasn’t a prude either, she had never been ashamed of her body. Not that Lopt could see much, but on a planet like Helvegen, this was already very naked.
The sun is shining high in the sky. It’s mid-April now, and spring is full in swing. Peter’s already left his coat at home, now daring to only walk outside in a thin sweater above his t-shirt. Knowing that there won’t be any crime-fighting for the following month, Peter isn’t bothering to put on the suit in the morning.
“Let’s get you out,” Tony returns. He moves to pick Peter back up, but right as he starts moving, a woman starts screaming behind him. Startled, Tony turns around to figure out what’s happening. There, he sees Steve running towards something. There’s blood on the ground, glass scattered around them all. Even from where Tony is seated he can see the red spots on Steve’s clothes. Whatever just happened, Steve got hit.
-“ Of course Stark immediately assumed what happened, and he was probably going to point his finger at her for making his son feel so bad.
Mary’s home is exactly what Tony would have expected the average family home to be like. There are pictures on the walls of her and Richard, most of them with the addition of Peter in many ages. The lights give a warm glow into the long hallway that must lead to the living room.
A little to his left, there’s a tall man with a beard and a cap is looking out through the window. He’s wearing glasses and a hoodie, hands tucked away in his pockets. Next to him, there’s a blonde woman with a face he doesn’t recognize. She’s got a hand on his back, not in a romantic gesture but in some sort of assuring way.
He should have known that he would chase Steve off one day. Things were too good to be true, after all.
“Because- uh… we’re public figures and- uh… it could make people wonder if they could take us seriously…”
Tony finally looks up to him, reaching out a hand and passing it through Peter’s hair. His eyes seem glassy, like he’s not completely awake from the anesthesia he’s probably been given.
“Tony what’s going on?” Steve asks in worry. Tony just grunts, closing the hatch of the jet and forcing the aircraft into the air. They didn’t even get to say goodbye to the others, but that hardly matters. There’ll be other times for them to go to New Asgard. And sure, it sucks that it’s now because they’ve got everybody together again since the war, but Tony can’t in his good conscience stay here knowing that something is risking Venom to escape again.
“Well, well, well,” she grinned as she stepped out of the little wall of ice Yaël had tried to create. Yaël bit away her pain and tried to get back on her feet, with not that much success. By the time she was on her knees, she had to quickly dodge a ball of fire coming from Nilla by steering it away. She pulled herself up on the wall, leaning against it.
“I understand that when you got your powers, everything had been amplified as well, right?” Banner counters. “Sound, smell, touch. You heard things you weren’t supposed to hear. You felt things before they would happen, right?”
As for Felicia… well, nobody really knows where she is. According to her classmates, she hasn’t been at school since the whole deal with Venom. Peter’s not sure what exactly happened, but since there have still been reports of the Black Cat wandering the streets, he figures she hasn’t completely disappeared from the world.
“Maybe because I’m from out there,” he hissed while quickly waving towards the sky. “So, you’re from Valhalla?” Lopt threw his hands in the air after that answer.
Then she starts walking off, giving him a wink and sticking out her tongue before turning her back to him. Peter watches her go for a moment, seeing a whole other side of Michelle that he’s never seen before. At first, he thought she was some sort of cyborg like in those Terminator-movies. Her icy-cold glare used to bring those thoughts into his head, really. Now she seems… human, in a way?
To be fair, Tony loves babies. Back when he had been with Pepper, almost at the beginning of their relationship, the thought of ever having children with her had been near to constant. But to be fair, his true knowledge of his paternal desire came to him the moment Peter came into his life. It was by then that he understood how much he loves being a father, having a kid to call his own.
So Peter’s alone, with a sleeping Tony Stark next to him. And he’s looking at the phone on the nightstand. It’s stayed here all the time, and even though Peter can’t recall bringing in the charger for the thing, it doesn’t seem to run empty on it.
Somehow, talking with Rhodey, Natasha and Cap helps quite a lot. They manage to distract him with sparring sessions and self-defense lessons. He’s not as strong as Cap, and surely not as agile as Nat, but just the basic moves are enough to make him forget about Pepper for a little longer. Yet, not completely, and every night in bed he stays awake instead of falling asleep. Some nights he just wanders around the compound and finds himself looking at the starry night, but other nights he hides himself in the lab, where he starts working on some new modifications for his teammate’s uniforms.
Johnny greets awkwardly. Unimpressed, Tony gives him a silent look while he waits for him to continue. “
He feels horrible in all ways. Being connected to FRIDAY like this, to the actual entire tower, Tony feels violated in many ways. There’s an intruder in the thing that feels like another part of his body. It’s unwanted, it’s probably causing lots of damage. And, as far as Tony knows, the girl still hasn’t found her way out. He’s making sure of that.
The rescuing of a loved one is a reoccurring theme in the movies Peter’s watched over the years. Batman had it with his girl in the first two movies, Superman was constantly having to save Lois Lane. But everybody always knew the hero would make it. At least, they mostly did. There is one movie where the girl dies. And that’s the movie that convinced Peter that the girlfriends should never know about the guy being a superhero.
“I’ll explain it to MJ, you’ll get Dr. Banner?” Harry asks. Peter nods, leaving his room again to get to the workshop. Bruce is there almost all the time when he isn’t in his guest room in the apartment downstairs. He’s got a whole floor to himself, according to Tony the same one he had when the Avengers used to live here, still.
Once he can see again, he’s startled so much he actually starts crawling backwards until his back hits the wall. In front of him stands the Goblin, hovering on his board and looking at Peter with intense eyes. His face looks normal, though, less murderous. He’s got the pointy ear-pieces, but the suit looks different in a way.
Peter tried to keep low as much as possible, only showing glimpses of himself, moving too fast for any camera to capture him. But Dr. Connors eventually found out who he was. After threatening to turn the whole city into lizards – how weird is that? – Peter and Gwen worked together to stop him. Gwen made the antidote, Peter stalled Dr. Connors for as long as he could. He ended up getting shot by a cop, and Gwen’s father eventually found out who he was after pulling away his mask. Peter and Gwen’s dad did get to the top of the tower to confront Dr. Connors. The antidote worked, but Gwen’s dad died, trying to protect Peter.
Peter salutes her in agreement, taking the note with the message for Tony from her and putting it on his desk. Then she straightens out her skirt and starts walking back out of the workshop. When she passes Dum-E, who is on his way back to Peter’s desk, she gives the bot a light kiss on the ‘head’.
“Yeah,” Yaël said loudly, so the two women would surely hear her, while keeping on rolling “And I’m sleeping with Thor too, so I have two shower stalls to choose between!” Idiots. The women looked at her in shock and they hurried off to get as much distance between them as possible.
Dr. Thatch nods. What Peter isn’t telling her is that it’s been hard at first, training. Mostly because he has to hold back his strength all the time, not wanting to appear
Michelle doesn’t seem happy. He can’t hear what she’s saying – and he’s not able to use Karen’s tricks to listen in again, thanks Dad – but he can see on her face that she’s angry in a way. Then, without warning, she stands up, pushing the table aside and starts walking.
Yaël should tell Charles one day that his voice was extremely soothing, as her words were stuck at that moment. Surely the telepath didn’t need to hear her say it as he could hear her think it. So he smiled the most warm smile he had as he started telling her random stories about adventures he once had, about a certain species of flowers, about a book he had read…
“Look,” Lopt said. Man, the name Lopt sounded so incorrect… “What if I told you that your lives, and the lives of creatures living on other planets, depends on it?” Lopt said while pointing up to the stars, which made Yaël notice that it was already night. “You mean Valhalla?” Raido answered.
Peter looks up, seeing Francis standing there at the door. He’s a thirty-something year old man with darkened skin and dark brown curls, with deep brown eyes hidden behind two round glasses. He looks like the typical nerd combined with stylish superstar, mostly wearing suits and carrying around expensive watches and a wedding ring that looks the exact opposite of cheap.
“So how’s it going between you and Bucky?” he hears Steve ask somewhere behind him, probably to Natasha. The spy turns towards him, her short red curls bouncing up and down in the movements of her dodges.
“Uh, Peter…” Tony doesn’t continue his sentence. Steve quickly notices Mantis sitting nearby, on the bed playing cards with Shuri, who is laughing because of something.
“It’s alright, Peter. Tony didn’t do anything at all. I’m just thinking too much about stuff,” Steve assures him. He turns off the fire and lifts up the pan, sharing its content over the three plates Peter prepared. Then he offers peter a glass of water before getting away from the counter. “I’ll go wake him up, you enjoy your breakfast.”
Mr. Stark looks downright horrible; his hair is all over the place, even from where Peter his standing he can smell the alcohol. The dark circles under his eyes look even worse than before, and his cheeks are wet; probably from the tears that are rolling down.
“You still have the phone?” Steve asks. Peter nods, picking it out of his left pocket and showing it to Steve. The man nods, puts a hand behind Peter’s head and then gives him a kiss on the forehead. Peter can’t react at all, blinking a few times before realizing Steve is no longer standing in front of him.
“You two are going to lead us, right?” Korg turned to the saved gladiators for an answer, who all started to cheer. Was everybody on this planet as ingenuous as Korg or had that something to do with being locked up for years?
“That needs to stay in,” Cap says, and Tony grunts in annoyance, throwing his head back and breathing out heavily. Then he makes another attempt at opening his eyes, blinking more often than not as he tries to adjust to the light around him. The first thing he sees is Steve sitting in a chair next to him.
“Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so… No, not really.” Steve could feel it coming, could read it in her face. She had known exactly what he had been doing this Saturday; training and catching up on some history at the library.
The school is undergoing some reparations due to the whole conflict between Wolverine and Deadpool, causing for some classes to be relocated until it’s finished. Other clubs have been cancelled for the time being, including the Decathlon team that Ned had been anxious to join (and also bugging Peter to do so as well) ever since he’s gotten here.
“Ah, you mean intercourse?” Thor asks to clarify. “No, we do that in the privacy of our bedroom, do not fear.”
,” Tony adds, his hands raised in the air in surrender. “As I was saying; I do crazy shit when I’m sleep deprived. I’m sorry.”
It takes a few moments for Bruce to calm himself down enough. By the time he’s got his back against the wall and his head thrown back, he looks simply exhausted. His breathing is still deep though fast, but when his eyes meet Tony’s there’s no trace of green in them left.
The goons let out a simultaneous growl, and they rush towards Peter, fists raised in the air and anger clear enough to be read in their eyes through the masks. Meanwhile, the shop-keeper hides behind the counter and grabs for the phone above him.
“Just shut up and kiss me, you ass,” Steve returns. He lifts his hands from Tony’s hips and puts them on his cheeks.
“No,” Peter whispers out, but he doesn’t know what he means with it. Is it a plea for Mr. Stark to stop chasing after him? A warning for himself, to say that he shouldn’t think like that? That he
“Ah, Peter!” it comes from far away, but when Peter focuses on the source, he can see Steve running up to him, a cap on his head and wearing a hoodie that doesn’t even fit him at all. “I’ve been searching for you!”
Mr. Parker’s homework?” Mrs. Cooper asks, still not seeming to believe it. The guy – who is he, even? – groans, seemingly losing his patience here.
They arrive at the compound in about twenty minutes. Tony stretches his back the moment he’s back on his feet, handing Steve back the helmet. He doesn’t put it away, instead hanging them on the steer. Then he hurries towards the door, motioning for Tony to follow him.
The whole room turns quiet. Tony sniffs once again before he carefully lets go of Peter and gets back on his feet. Then he marches towards Strange, and despite the guy being that much taller than him the sorcerer jumps away nervously.
“Yes, the weather is particularly hot today,” T’Challa agrees when he sees Tony adjust his wardrobe. Before they can walk outside, a person (a butler?) hands both of them a bottle of water. T’Challa thanks the man in his native language, and he gets a bow of the head in return. Tony watches it happen, and then he takes a grateful swing of his bottle. The two start walking again afterwards.
To be completely fair, Peter doesn’t just react the way he does because they’re practically his parents. He’s only just walking into the penthouse when he hears some sort of crash, and two people sounding an awful lot like Steve and Tony laughing.
, was it really that hard for somebody to say what he should do? Sure, it’s not that he needs permission or something from anybody, but just some encouragement is enough, he should think.
They’re there to pick up Natasha in just five minutes, and after that it’s just the two of them again. Pretending not to be bothered about this, Tony nudges Peter while giving him a faint smile.
“Uh, yeah, no, it’s just a school trip,” Peter quickly explains. “It’s nothing- look, Happy I got to say; you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.”
Mr. Stark said so, himself. “You know she came back at my front door, once. Before you were born. And she was in tears, as if she were having a panic attack.”
He doesn’t know how much time has passed since he was taken and now, but he knows it can’t be much. Mr. Stark drops him gently on the ground, but Peter still stumbles forward and starts breathing heavily. Behind him, Mr. Stark steps out of his suit.
Okay, no, who is he kidding? Of course he wants to go with them. To meet Tony’s Aunt? That would be awesome. The woman could become Peter’s great-aunt or something!
It takes ten minutes before Tony returns, sans Steve. He looks hurried, running to grab his jacket and then supposedly following Steve out the compound. All the while, the three remaining men at the table stay suspiciously quiet.
“I’m glad you’re back,” Tony finds himself saying in all honesty. Steve leans forward to kiss him once more.
Everything went well during this one, his parents got married, she even added a picture of her first ultrasound of Peter, and after that he’s ready to go to the next one.
“FRI, what hour is my appointment?” Tony asks, still postponing on starting the car. He looks up at the blue sky, remembering when it was red and bleeding. But, it could also have been his imagination. How could nature adapt itself to war like that?
FRIDAY suddenly says, interrupting Tony’s peace. He sighs, rubbing his forehead and wondering when this day will just end.
“Listen, Sharon, I need to know; did they give you any trouble?” Tony asks, and Sharon bites her lips before she looks down again. Because it can’t be that she got away with bringing Steve and the others their weapons. They would know somebody did it, and given that she was seen talking to him at the funeral, her bosses will only assume.
“Who’s got the first shift of babysitting me?” Tony then asks, realizing that he’s got no other option other than to agree to it. Just after he’s finished his sentence, the door opens, revealing none other than Natasha.
Tony nods, letting Peter and Steve pull him along to where they want him to go. He turns his head once more, shortly. The light side is far away now, barely even visible. It’s alright, though. The stars are more beautiful to look at for now.
“It’s called a bitchy-resting face. Look it up, blue-eyes,” Mr. Stark responds. Steve then glares back at him before pushing himself from the desk and nearing Peter. He takes a small look at the device in Peter’s chest, and then nods.
But as soon as he sits down on his seat in the plane, before Tony can even speak, his phone goes off. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Could it be possible that Tony has ever heard his ringtone before? Peter hopes not.
“You made it cliché the moment you went down on one knee,” he whispers against his lips. Then he pulls back, taking the silver-colored ring from Tony’s finger to put it on. Of course, it fits perfectly. It would have been awkward if it didn’t, since it’s almost impossible to resize it
“These people… I wish I could do more, you know. I’ve been trying to bring awareness about it, but nobody really listens to it.”
Peter nods in understanding, but to be honest he feels like he’s heard too much right now. His brain needs a break.
“What the-?” Peter asks. They start running through Manhattan, making their way to Times Square. Peter knows that, if there’s something important happening there, it’s almost surely broadcasted live back there. Harry’s right beside him, running just as fast as him. Peter’s glad for it, for Harry being here. Sure, he’s not always the best at being supportive, but he shows it in those grand gestures.
“Nah, she said something about some business to take care off,” Peter returns. Of course Johnny would want to know about Felicia, he
“Heh, my Aunt would freak! She’s been trying to get me to get my grades back up at school,” Peter mumbles back. “Besides, I can barely manage to convince the Avengers to let me fight alongside them.” Then he just shakes his head. He really needs to find some people more of his age to vent to, but instead he finds himself talking to an adult woman who shouldn’t really bother listening to him.
There’s a moment of silence. Peter can finally see what’s happening as he stands at the doorway. There he sees Steve, kneeling down on the ground while holding Mr. Stark’s face in his hands.
The day he finally got to talk to Gwen was when Peter decided to help out another kid that was being bullied by Flash during lunch. The guy was tilting the boy up, pressing his face against his plate of pasta as a revenge for not sharing his homework. Peter stood up for him, Flash started to kick his ass, and then she came to save the day, humiliating Flash in front of the entire crowd.
“Well, okay, the tritium is alarmingly enough. I’ll, uh… I’ll give Dr. Octavius a call. Can you maybe give me some description of what the girl looked like?”
“I beg your pardon?! You did cause a goddamn scene in case you forgot! All the time you want to be considered an Avenger, and when you get your orders you don’t want to listen to them because you’re not an Avenger anyway?!”
Mary seems to catch on as well as she grips the steering wheel tighter. “So, uh, where are you, currently? In this year, I mean?”
“You sure you don’t need any help with ‘im?” the man asks, lowering his glasses a bit. Peter shakes his head, positioning his backpack and then picking Johnny back up. He’s completely out of it, so he lifts him back over his shoulder and closes the door with his foot. After handing the driver some money through the window, he gives him a wave.
“What’s wrong with Tony?” she asks, pulling a few strands of hair out of his face. Steve is grateful for her, she’s the first one to actually
“Don’t say it has something to do with you battling that giant robot in the city?” Johnny asks, changing the channel back to the news where they’re doing a coverage on the battle. “I mean, it looked badass, but I also feel like you weren’t part of the team, you know?”
“Yes, I mean, maybe we should keep an eye on him…” Yaël mumbled as she saw Wade and Logan turn around, while everybody else was still frozen. Charles forced them to calm down and go to separate rooms, he was probably going to have a talk with them after this mess got cleaned up.
“Seriously?! What does it even matter?” Without letting go of James’ hair, she continues the first braid before finishing it off. Then she goes on to the second one while glaring at the two men.
The hours continue quickly after that. While Steve helps out with the last few tasks that need to be accomplished, Thor hurries back to his quarters to get changed at last. Steve isn’t left alone for long, though. He gets in a conversation with Lady Sif and Hilde, and is eventually joined by Bucky and Sam. When he asks where Clint and Scott are – since they’re often hanging around with the four of them whenever Steve isn’t with them – Bucky simply explains Clint with Peter Quill back at Jane’s. Apparently, they seem intent on doing her hair and make-up. Meanwhile, Scott is with Hope, supposedly having gotten into a deep conversation with Natasha about fighting tactics.
Instead of being disgusted by Peter’s sick state, Mr. Rogers only holds out his hand towards Peter with a smile. Peter accepts the handshake.
Somehow Yaël was afraid that Steve would want to talk about what she had been going through, what she had seen and why she had been sick. She wanted to talk about anything else, but that. Not because she was ashamed, but because she didn’t feel like it. The things that happened to her wasn’t the hot topic that Yaël wanted to talk about the whole evening. She was craving for other news than hearing herself tell that story again. It happened, but other stuff happened to other people too and she wanted to hear about that, shake off her own problems for a moment.
“Travel stuff, man! I need a good swimming suit! And a camera! Even bought myself a new phone. I’m rich, I can definitely afford it!” he says with a wink. Then he hurries to put it all away in his room. By the time he returns, Ned is there as well.
“I will not travel back in time! Such a feat is dangerous and could have disastrous consequences!” Strange protests.
It had been somewhere in between, well, kind of like a friends-with-benefits-thing. She had just passed his apartment whenever she felt like it and he took her random appearances very casually, just like she did with his frequent disappearances. He had told her that, with his secret-ass-job and all, she shouldn’t worry if he’d be gone one day. And that was exactly what had happened. One day, after struggling with the spare-key he had given her, she remembered it clearly, Yaël had walked into his apartment and it had been empty. Not empty like nobody was home, but empty like nobody was even living there. Every single piece of furniture had been taken out.
After she hung up, she stared at the paper where she just wrote on during the phone call. Great, she had an appointment for tomorrow. Why didn’t that feel like a victory at all? She saw the bottle, that she had put on the table to write the appointment down and took it on her lap again.
“I’ll keep my eye on you, pal. You always disappear around midnight and I’m still curious as to where you’re going all the time.”
“Yeah, well, all of that aside, let’s get to the actual business, shall we?” Cho asks. Tony leans back in the bed, looking at the Doc and giving her a nod. He can sit back and listen for a bit. “Your vitals are currently normal. The results of your blood-tests seem a bit deviant, but nothing indicates that you are in direct danger. Despite that, the injection you’ve performed on yourself could have been extremely life-threatening to a point of paralysis had you missed your target.”
Peter leans back, mouth open as he nods in understanding. He would have expected Rhodey or something, but given that the man is out of town for his revalidation the following week it’s not like he can just ask him.
“I’ll see you then,” she says, looking at him as she kisses the picture. Then she winks, walking out of the room and leaving Peter in here alone with his thoughts.
“Dad, don’t you have anything better to do?” Peter asks in annoyance. Tony jumps up before snorting in his coffee. Then he drops his cup and holds up his hands.
After that there are no more messages, and Peter puts his phone away again. Then he looks at Dum-E, who points once more at the cup of coffee.
“Of course,” Peter hisses bitterly. He wonders who else is really involved. He doubts they’re going to get Iron Man or War Machine into this, but there are still other ways for them to sneak up on them. After all, Rhodey is still a skilled soldier, and Tony has his mind.
“I’m fine,” he assures him. “As long as I have you, Peter and my friends I have everything I need.” He gives Steve a smile, puts his head against Steve’s shoulder and then pulls him towards the door opening. Sure this sucks, but he’ll bite through this. At least for now.
Peter gets to the living room, confused when he doesn’t see anybody there. The TV is turned off, the pillows of the couch untouched. Peter’s pretty sure he heard Johnny walk around earlier, didn’t he?
This whole story was so vague. Yaël never noticed the Queen was so powerful she could send people to other planets. Nor did she ever seemed to have an interest in Yaël, but Nilla’s story sounded logical. Of course she wasn’t executed, Völuspá needed her. But what were these strange plans Nilla was talking about? Yaël had a bad feeling about this situation.
“You want proof, I can give you proof,” the guy says before fishing out his phone and searching along on it. Then he turns the device around and points it towards the two others in front of him. “See here, Mr. Parker handing his homework.”
Tony sighs. He should get this started. He claps his hands together, taking the compresses and soaking them with antiseptic. He reaches behind him, swabbing it over his back. He has the hope that that injection will be enough, but he figures that it might not, so it’s best to take the worst first.
“I think I got that, yes,” Pepper says, slightly chuckling. “Looks like the entire former team is getting their priorities straight.”
Tony returns about forty minutes after he’s been called away. Entering the visiting room, he lets his mouth fall open in confusion upon seeing only Steve sitting there with no Peter in sight. Steve clears his throat, ignoring the ache in his chest upon seeing Tony again. After all, they still have a lot to talk about.
Then another piece of paper comes out of the printer. Mr. Stark takes it out, gives it a quick once-over before shoving it back towards Peter.
“Get a higher frequency!” Bruce shouts somewhere. He figures that Tony agrees, as suddenly the fight seems less straining. The parts that were crawling back up his face come loose, and it even get to a point where it looks like the suit wants to get off as quickly as possible. Peter sits up the moment he feels like everything is off, throwing the black goo – the thing he remembers seeing back on the crash site – somewhere in the room. Tony seems prepared for it, dropping a container on it the moment it’s free of Peter.
There was a time that they couldn’t imagine a life without each other, being very close friends…well, with some extras of course. Her heart stung a bit as this was the first time she actually felt like she missed him. They were used to not seeing each other very frequently, and if they’d meet, it was always for a very short time. But it’s been a year, apparently. Had he forgotten about her? Maybe something was wrong with him? She tried not to wonder too long about it, as he wouldn’t do that either. They didn’t wind up in each other’s business as they knew they were both capable of handling their own business.
. As far as these people are concerned, I don’t even exist,” Yaël muttered while rubbing her eyes. But if she didn’t exist, then why did the UN decide to put her on lockdown too?
?” he asks with a clear urgency in his voice. Steve seems to startle upon hearing his name. Once he sees Tony there as well it seems like he’s hesitating on going his way or staying where he is.
While I was intending on the timestamp to be longer, instead I decided to maybe make it into a full-length story. So, with that, I decided to post this teaser, instead. I'm not sure if I'll manage to finish another complete story, but I'm sure as Hell willing to try!
“Shit, why does Richard have to be so messy all the time?” he hears Mary calls out in the background. Tony then finally drops the vials and figures he should help looking.
, you know it’s urgent,” Steve retorts for the fourth time as well. Now dressed in his full uniform, he’s the exact opposite of Tony, who is standing there buck-naked.
“What the hell? How can anybody get the better of him? Isn’t he, like, the most powerful of us all?”
“Wow, but if he’s your dad, that’s kind of great, right?” she asked with a big smile. But Peter just shrugged.
It’s best not to dwell on it. Peter takes his first step inside of the penthouse, looking around and seeing what looks like a wreckage – as if the Hulk had been walking around here and stumbled against everything. Peter’s mouth falls open, surprised at how completely different it looks from the last time he’s been here.
So Tony lets out a relieving breath, grabs his own box and marches up to the couch. When he nears them, he looks down at the two.
“How are you feeling, Peter?” Dr. Cho asks. Peter makes himself cozy on the chair and clears his throat.
“Aunt May, listen, I’m not overworking myself!” Peter quickly gets out, grabbing for her hands and taking them in his own. The woman looks at him with a worried expression behind her glasses, and Peter thinks back of the last time he wore his. “I’m doing fine. Great, even, because I get to work alongside Mr. Stark. We’re working on some sort of suit and-“
Peter looks at her, but suddenly feels unable to answer. Because he can’t remember ever really kissing her other than that first time right before he got together with MJ.
“Gross, man, I don’t need to know about what you and Steve are doing when I’m gone!” Peter mutters, complaining about the image he desperately tries to get out of his mind.
I felt like it was necessary to show that, despite the fact that Harry's cured and so, it's not possible that Peter won't have any sort of reaction to it. With that, I suppose it would have been realistic if he would look up in Harry's eyes and suddenly see the Goblin in front of him. Besides, with the way Peter's body works, I'm sure he's not able to stay on the same medication for long. Eventually, his body will get used to the meds and work around it. He has to change quite regularly. He knows this, and he's aware of how to act in this situation.
“I will miss you, Tony,” Steve had told him after Thor flew back up into the sky. Some part of him had hoped that… Tony would say it in return. That didn’t happen.
Hurriedly he mutters his address to the driver, turning his head back to check if his dad is still following. Luckily, the car drives off the moment Tony rounds around the corner, looking angry and scared at the same time. Peter lets out a long breath, actually surprised that he noticed him leaving already. He thought it would have taken at least a few hours or something like that.
“You’re a good man, Tony.” Mary looks down to the ground, hands pulling away from Tony’s to take the vials of blood. “The reason I shut you out wasn’t only because of Peter.”
One woman nods before hurrying inside. Just as she passes through the door, Steve Rogers does the same but from the opposite direction. Once he sees Peter and Tony standing there, he runs towards them. He, too, looks horrified at Peter’s condition.
“Well, he’s Spider-Man, of course!” Creepy Stalking Guy says, and then the alarms start ringing inside of Peter’s head. How does this guy even
“Alright, perfect is a strong word,” he returns. He then turns Tony around to face him again, hands not leaving his shoulders. “But I never said you
No, you know what? Scratch all of that, she was going back to earth and she’d be going on with her single, easy life. Just drunkenly sleeping around with random dudes seemed just fine to her.
“Sounds… amazing,” Tony breathes out, hurrying towards Peter’s side to see what he’s got so far. “I wouldn’t make this so long; it’ll throw it out of balance.” Tony points his finger at the neck of the bot that Peter created.
“CAAAAAAP!” Wade calls out, throwing his arms around Steve’s waist, with that slightly pushing Tony aside. As Deadpool starts hanging on Steve almost literally, Tony notices the amused look on Steve’s face.
You know what, forget it. Forget I said anything…” Then he drops his stuff, the mask he’d been using to protect himself from the sparks, and he starts to walk to the door. “I don’t need this shit.”
Afterwards she kind of regretted it, because being mature was her only chance to get out of her sickening apartment…oh, and because Fury gave her even less money after that. Great…
“You’re extremely sassy today, what’s gotten into you, FRIDAY?” Tony asks in a mutter. “You’re not afraid you’re going to be replaced now that you have a little brother, are you?”
thing to say, it’s that orange isn’t a good color on Steve. It’s too wild, too heavy. Too much like fire, while Steve’s more like water instead. He’s always so calm and reserved, and the orange overall just seems to mock everybody around him while he’s wearing it.
“I guess you’re right,” Tony sighs, allowing Steve to pull him along. “Though I need the journals.” He points at the box, and Steve leans forward and picks up the heavy box with just one arm, just so he doesn’t have to let go of Tony’s hand. Tony grabs his tablet and the remaining journal, and lets himself be guided back to his son by Steve.
“Okay, just shut it for a moment,” Strange says in that typical low voice of his. Peter listens and keeps his mouth shut. After that, he’s released from his hold again. Peter shakes his arms loose for a moment. When there’s another groan from behind him, he turns around to see Bruce sitting up a bit, looking around in confusion.
This is the second person now that has suggested him to go for that internship, and immediately he wonders what it would be like; he’s never been inside of Stark Industries, never had reason to. The building is not too far from Oscorp, yet Peter has avoided it like the plague whenever swinging just because of the elaborate security system.
Peter can see Tony stumble through the portal. It’s a relief, the biggest one he’s felt in the past few weeks, to see him get through unharmed other than a few scrapes, looking dusty and dirty. Peter wonders in what kind of world he was sent to.
He thinks he should be glad that Harry and Johnny are there with him as his mental support, but to be honest it's not that much of a comfort. It's probably even worse now, given that he now gets to be embarassed about his superhero-dads in front of an entire crowd.
“I’m not a babysitter!” Felicia returns angrily. The thing that had been electrifying Venom up until now seems to have run out. Venom grunts again, slowly regaining control of Eddie’s body once more.
“Uhm, it wasn’t, but I suppose I forgot to mention that as well,” she utters out. Tony gives her an unimpressed look and Pepper stops breathing for a second before rolling her eyes. “He asked me while we were cooking, both of us covered in tomato juice because we’re both not very good cooks. It wasn’t anything as spectacular as I suspect you would have done.”
Peter doesn’t really feel like having an emotional talk right now. His emotions are all over the place; one moment he’s pissed, and the next he’s at the verge of crying his eyes out because of abandonment issues. He should get it together.
“I’m glad you’re alright, Peter,” she says. Her light-orange curls fall perfectly over her shoulders, and had she been about Peter’s age, he thinks he would probably have fallen in love on the spot with her. “You  had us worried for a moment, there.”
“I- uh, it’s Peter,” he then says. Doesn’t need to keep Steve in this tension. There’s a short silence, and then some shuffling sounds.
“Run along, then!” Natasha calls out after him. Peter waves at her before running back inside. Then he starts a slow jog, nodding at all the people he sees inside. There’s Dr. Selvig – who still doesn’t really seem to know who Peter is, and sometimes just mistakes him for another intern (which he actually kind of is…) – and Jane Foster, followed by Darcy and that guy called Ian. Peter hasn’t really spoken a lot to them in the past, but he’s sure that, if he would ever get the chance, they might end up in an endless discussion about science.
Much like the fact that he feels tired 24/7, or that he keeps on being spotted on patrol without remembering going. He doesn’t want to alarm Steve, so instead he told him about school, Aunt May, Shuri fixing Rhodey’s back.
Everybody stares at the bottle in confusion, clearly wondering what that has to do with it. For a moment, Tony wonders how much they know about Peter’s situation. They probably know he takes things for the depression, but they’ve never really discussed the other parts, haven’t they?
“Let us inside, please,” Peter says, voice shivering all of the sudden. If FRIDAY would stimulate him in using the codes, that could only mean that there’s something incredibly wrong, right?
“Dad, hey,” Peter says with a smile. Tony smiles back. He pulls the kid into a strong hug, taking in his scent but noticing that here isn’t any on him. That’s odd. “I need you to wake up, okay? For me? Can you do that?”
Peter is quiet, unmoving. His eyes have already bruised, and there’s a cut on his cheek that has already been stitched by Dr. Cho earlier. His arms and legs look blue and purple as well, and there’s an IV passing some fluids with medication through his veins. Tony hates to see him like this.
They take a drink and they get to talking. It’s light banter and discussions about their plans after school. Vision doesn’t go to school, but he entertains everyone by adding logical comments that nobody really asks for. Ned describes his apartment in Massachusetts, and his expectations of how college is going to be. Harry then reveals all the places he’s planning to see on his trip.
“No, I’m not. Why do you think she’s always been so rude to you? She just doesn’t want you to notice how much she cares, because she’s afraid for it.”
“Right now, Clint’s bringing the quinjet here to get me, and then we’ll pick up Steve and move out,” she explains. Tony just nods grimly.
Peter looked at her like he was trying to figure out what she just had said. Yaël sneezed and cleaned her nose with a tissue. “You and Wade were the ones who started stalking me in the first place!” was Peter’s reply. He didn’t seem annoyed, he just wanted to clear the stalking-issue out.
