“What are we playing for?” Sam asked, once they were settled around the table and the chips were out.
license, so we piled into the car to go take a look. There was an old barn whose roof had been lifted clean off the building and set down again half a football field away, almost undamaged. And then there were trees that had been ripped apart into kindling. Sammy had nightmares for a month after that. I probably shouldn’t have let him come with, but wasn’t like I had anyone to leave him with, really. Not when I wasn’t supposed to be going myself.”
Cas took a deep breath, and sat at the small table in the corner of his office. “Have a seat, please.”
“What does that mean, her estate?” Gabriel asked. “Not to be blunt, but I’m going to be blunt. Is there enough money to maintain this place?”
The corner of Cas’ mouth quirked up in a smile. “A warm creamy tone. I thought it would look lovely with the dark cabinets, and I could bring in the color with the accessories. I almost went with a green, but really between the cabinets and the windows there isn’t that much wall anyhow.”
“This is certainly a beautiful collection.” Whether or not it held any academic interest was yet to be determined, though even a quick perusal of the library made Castiel’s heart rate quicken. He could tell at a glance that most of the books were newer and of no particular value, but he could also tell that some of them held potential.
That might be too tall of an order, but Dean isn’t going to give up before he even tries. Cas needs to relax. One way to do that would be to push shots down his throat until he gets all slouchy and bendy, but they don’t really have time for that option. He’s also not sure that showing up in front of the family matriarch with a serious buzz going is the best idea, no matter how much fun it might be.
Cas led the way back to the dining room. “How much longer before I’ll be able to cook in my kitchen? It looks like it’s getting close.”
The little house had needed some serious work. Dean had done the heavy lifting, though Sam and Jess had done a lot, and some of their other friends had helped as well.
Mariel made a little cooing noise, and Sam grinned. “See? She agrees with me. Thinks that Uncle Dean has a little crush on Castiel Novak.”
Dean burrowed down into the bedding, not really interested in responding to the anxious repetition of his name.
Dean is reminded of some of those nature documentaries that Cas likes to watch, when Dean would rather be watching wrestling or some mindless sit-com with pretty faces. Better yet, a Dr. Sexy marathon. Not that the documentaries don’t end up being interesting, probably more interesting than the aforementioned sit-coms… but it’s the principle of the thing. Cas doesn’t admit he likes watching Dr. Sexy, and Dean doesn’t admit he enjoys the documentaries. It’s one of those things they’ve silently negotiated over the years. If one of them were to break the rules it would probably cause some sort of seismic imbalance in the universe or something. Disaster.
Adler led him around next. His own team was small – two senior sales associates, three junior, and an administrative assistant. But then there were a lot of other people to meet, too. There were colleagues at his same level in the organization, Directors of different regions. More sales associates, more admins. Then the President, Gordon Walker himself, and the rest of the executives.
Cas shivered. Dean’s voice had gone even lower than usual, with a faint growl to it that slid down his spine, curved around his hips, and settled low.
Dean looked across the bar and gave Ellen a thumbs-up. Cas followed his gaze, nodded approvingly and then followed suit.
Anna is beautiful in the late afternoon sun, her dress a slim column with lace and beads and sequins that shimmer in the light. Her hair is done up in some elaborate design, a veil flowing down her back and behind her. Her bouquet is enormous, all white with hints of palest pink. She smiles and gives tiny waves to the guests, until finally she turns all of her attention to Vincent.
He had to turn off these thoughts, had to concentrate on the task at hand. He had to trust that Charlie would be watching her information sources, which were far better than his. He likewise had to trust that Gabriel would be doing what he could from their new home, that he would be pulling together the right resources.
“We should wait for the fire to go out entirely. Nearly time. We should consider that the ghoul was sent after you on purpose.”
He didn’t bother going back to his office. He had his keys and wallet in his pocket. He didn’t need anything else.
A few trips later and the boxes of books were returned to the room, and the writing table and chair located just so in the middle of the floor, facing the view of the windows. “Do you not have anywhere other than the boxes to keep your books?”
Dean insisted that he stay away. “Just for now, Cas. I want to do the cleaning up so the first time you see it finished, it’s all sparkling. Please?”
“Uninvited, perhaps, but not unwelcome.” She smiled brightly at him, and he couldn’t be annoyed with her. She was maybe the best thing about Sandover. Maybe. Definitely. He couldn’t count a certain blue-eyed HR director, because that? That was thoroughly against the rules.
“What else did you bring?” Charlie asked, clearly taking pity on Dean by offering a distraction. She started digging into the other two boxes.
They were shown to their favorite booth, sliding in… Charlie on one side, Dean and Cas on the other. Cas reached over to take Dean’s hand, resting both of them on Dean’s thigh. He stroked his thumb over the gold band encircling his ring finger.
He’d always been able to think better when his hands were busy. With a determined nod, he turned off the television and headed down to his shop. He already knew what sort of cabinets were going into Cas’ new kitchen. Cas had shown him some pictures he’d found online of kitchens he liked, expressing in particular an admiration for the dark rich tones of stained cherry. The cabinets needed to be special, not just the same cabinets you could find anywhere — and he knew just what to do.
He must have found it, because with a sub-vocal curse, he leaned in and pressed his lips against Castiel’s.
Cas makes a growling sound in the back of his throat. “Breaking it off is… well, it’s fine. It was coming soon in any event. Danny is far more pretty packaging than substance.” He tosses back half of his beer, then starts coughing for a long moment before catching his breath again.
She glanced at him sidelong, the bridge of her nose wrinkled in concentration. “Something you’re not going to want to hear,” she admitted. “We’ve got a bit of a potential problem.” She typed another search string into the parameter box, scanning over the results with her eyes. Most of it didn’t make sense; she tended to use raw data in her analyses, because she could and because she could get more information on a screen than if she ran it through an interpretive algorithm. He thought that’s what she’d called it before, anyhow. He often got lost when she was talking about how she knew what she knew.
She stood, her gaze hardening. “You’ll regret this, if you don’t work with me here. I can make your life a living hell.”
Cas closed down his laptop and descended the stairs to the front room. “Oh my.” There were more boxes than he had anticipated. Did he really own that much stuff?
“Yes, yes, of course.” He reached to unclip the cards from the hem of his shirt and handed them over.
“I’m working security for the wedding,” he explained. “Spent some time vetting out the people doing the event. If you’re working for Stark Designs, you would have come through the process.”
Cas thought he would have ended up being lonely after Gabriel left, if it wasn’t for Dean and the work being done on the house. They were still working through necessary repairs rather than tackling the remodeling — things like replacing rotting boards on the porch, switching out light fixtures that no longer worked, and cleaning the furnace thoroughly.
“Fuck,” Dean groaned. “Cas.” He reached out to touch Cas’ face, his hand trembling slightly. “Is… is this okay?”
Sam just rolled his eyes, but for all that, Dean knew he was serious. This house was close to Main, just a couple blocks away from Sam’s office in what the locals called the Professional Building, because the old brick structure happened to house not just Sam’s legal office, but an accountant, a dentist, and an insurance agent. The house’s location alone made it attractive to Sam and Jess when they’d moved here from California. The price made it even more so. Sam might be a lawyer with a degree from a prestigious law school, but he was also a young man newly married. He’d stayed in California at first, but he’d been miserable.
“I’m a med tech. I work in the radiology department at the hospital – so I end up doing a lot of x-rays for people that broke something.”
“Uh, no. Not really. Just… maybe try and make some overtures? At least let him know you’re open to more. You never told him anything about Aaron, did you?”
“With all due respect, Mr. Novak, it’s what she desired. You’ll find that her last will and testament is executed properly, and entirely legal.” There was a hard edge to his tone, though it remained coolly professional.
Still dazed, he crosses over to the right-hand side of the bed, the one closer to the windows. Come to think of it, that’s likely why Dean subconsciously chose the left side. He always positions himself between the door and whoever else he’s with, especially if that person is Sam or Cas.
“Brownies, and cookies. Most of them are leftovers from Christmas that Amelia insisted I bring with me.” Cas took each of the containers from her as she lifted them out of the box.
“Ah. Yes. Proper salutations. Hello, Dean. Good morning. Were you serious about there being suitable vehicles available at Singer Salvage?”
“I’m not going to sit down – I’m a sweaty smelly mess and I’d ruin the chair. But did you see the news?”
“You’re presuming guilt.” Castiel sliced a bit of cheese from the wedge to give himself something to do with his hands. “Did you come to Havenport because of him? You followed him here from… wherever you were before? Kansas, did you say?” He knew Roman had come here from somewhere in the Midwest. Kansas was as likely as anywhere else. He hadn’t paid particular attention, because he didn’t see the information as relevant in any way.
At the end of the workday, he took out the piece of paper that Dean had left his contact information written on.
Dean knew the rest of the security staff were curious when he’d sent out the alert about Gordon Walker. Thankfully, one of the benefits of being the Interim Head of Security was that he didn’t have to explain himself to anyone. What would he say, anyhow? This cute guy I met a couple days ago gave me a head’s-up about him? Which would then beg the question who was this cute guy, how did he know, was he sure the guy was a reliable source, and on and on and on.
“No, I don’t think we’re getting cranberries this year,” Dean said absently. “You don’t even like cranberries.”
“Some. Not as much as I wish I did right now. Bobby, and now Sam, have made it their life’s work to study dragonkind. To find out the truth, rather than just the carefully cultivated image that Lord Michael presents. I mean, Michael’s rule isn’t really awful, not really. It’s just…” He shrugged helplessly.
“Well. Interesting story, that.” He ran his hand through his hair. “It was given to me by a young man who thought it was important. He wasn’t able to read it, either.”
“So… what do you think about maybe getting together sometime, after Sam and Eileen are back, just me and you?”
Castiel frowned. “Perhaps. Do you need it written down? It would be faster to read you some excerpts and work that way. If you were to come to my home tomorrow evening we could try that approach.”
“Land, primarily. Coupled with investments in various stocks and bonds. Unimportant to the topic at hand, however. It seems that Mr. Roman has an interest in rare books and documents, particularly those that predate the invention of the printing press. It seems he has a notable private collection. Some of the works he owns have never been translated into English. He expressed an interest in having our expert examine some of his pieces and perhaps provide a translation. In exchange he intimated that he may be interested in making a sizable donation to the Museum, even so far as sponsoring a collection to carry his name. The Roman Collection of Rare Works.” The Director’s eyes took on a gleam of fervor. “Hadn’t you said something about some pieces potentially coming to the market in Scotland? We might be able to afford to send you there to evaluate their suitability for the Museum.”
When Dean arrived to work three days later, Sam was with him. Cas was confused. Sam wasn’t exactly dressed in work clothes, at least not construction work. The contrast between Sam in his dress shirt and sport jacket, Dean in his jeans and flannel shirt was striking. “Hello, Sam. What an unexpected pleasure.”
She sighed, shook her head. “It’s after eight. Pack up your work and go home, eat some dinner. The book will still be here tomorrow.”
“Meaning Michael,” Cas says knowingly. “He’s mastered that look of arrogant disdain, hasn’t he. Of course he’s been learning at Zach’s knee since he was born.”
“That is artistry. Excellent craftsmanship is a kind of art that is not always appreciated as much as it should be. This work may be transformative in nature, but that does not make it any less of an art form.”
Castiel took a moment to calm himself. He liked calm and order. The idea of someone ransacking his home, his sanctuary… “Very well. Let’s return to my home. I’ll tell Mrs. Crombie I’m leaving for the day.”
“Nah, that was part of it, but… I dunno. Just the general attitude, you know? The whole ‘I can’t believe I’m sitting in a hick diner and what exactly was that sticky spot I stepped in’ sort of a vibe.”
“I thought you said you didn’t work magic. I… perhaps we should discuss it further in the morning. I confess that right now I am so tired I can hardly see straight, let alone think coherently.”
“Oh, thanks, Bela.” Dean reached out to take the packet from her. A faint hint of some spicy perfume tickled his nose.
He returned to the cleaning, taking a spray cleaner and paper towels to the old kitchen table. It was uneven and like much else, the paint was peeling, but he liked it. He found it charming and comfortable, unpretentious. Real. This table had seen many things. Castiel realized he really didn’t know very much about the life Great Aunt Hester had lived. If he was going to live here, perhaps he would see what he could find out. He was good at that sort of thing, at digging into old records to reconstruct a story. With all the books that were here, surely there were some papers that would reveal something about who she had been.
Gabe? That makes a lot more sense.” He’s kidding, mostly. Dean actually likes Gabe and his insane sense of humor – when that wit isn’t aimed at him.
Charlie laughed. “Why, when we’re calling this a special occasion, does your mind go straight to burgers?”
“Yeah, we haven’t had enough time yet to really absorb that this place belongs to Castiel now, so he doesn’t know, either. I’m guessing the kitchen’s going to be pretty high on the list. He likes to cook. Good at it, too.” He smiled fondly at the younger man.
Cas closed his eyes, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his temple. “You are undoubtedly right. But without having any idea what, it’s hard to know what to watch for.”
Cas apparently decided to accept his dropping the subject, and moved on to the next topic. Expense reimbursement. Exciting stuff – though being in sales, it was probably going to be something he needed to understand. He’d be entertaining clients and prospective clients, after all, and he sure as hell didn’t want to get stuck paying for things out of pocket because he’d screwed up on understanding the rules. He’d made that mistake once in his first sales job out of college. Never again.
After pointing out the bathroom nearest the bedroom they return to unpack their luggage and put things away in the armoire. Cas still feels uncomfortable despite Dean’s protestations. He agrees that sharing a bedroom, sharing a bed, should be a non-issue – but that is predicated on a very large assumption which in Cas’ case, at least, is entirely invalid.
The figure lowered his hood, revealing Richard Roman. He smiled, a chilling smile, as he leaned forward over Dean, looking into his eyes. “Such an honor, Mr. Winchester,” he crooned. “To become one with the spirit of Malak is a privilege beyond all others. Far beyond the one I granted to your old partner, Mr. Lafitte. Yes, yes, I remember him. He was… disappointing, really. Fought against the transformation to the point where I had to concede failure and destroy him.”
The event crew were still at work, though he thought most of them were a second crew. Stark had claimed that there was no way he could get everything done in two days; he needed a week. Naomi had backed him up on that. Security had countered with two and a half days, but he could work 24 hours a day. He hadn’t been happy, but when they’d added a storage space that he could have things delivered before the window opened, he’d accepted it. Or else he’d realized that was as much as he was going to get, and his other option was to step aside and let someone else handle the job.
Dean snorted. “That’s because I’m not. I’m an investigator. A criminal investigator, privately employed.”
“Yeah, attorney-client privilege. That doesn’t extend to your impressions of people, does it? Just to the things they actually tell you?”
Dean gave a signal to the Caterpillar operator. He returned a thumbs up, then shifted into reverse, backing away from the house. The chain attached to the support posts tightened, then strained. Cas found himself holding his breath as the beams started to bow.
Standing right behind her was her uncle, Cas Novak. He looked like he’d just picked Claire up from daycare on his way home from work, going straight to the grocery store before heading home. He wore a disheveled navy suit with a white shirt and crooked blue tie, an ugly beige trench-coat that fit him horribly over the entire ensemble. He blinked, sporting the perpetually confused look Dean had grown used to on him. It shouldn’t be as appealing as it was.
His cottage was on the outskirts of town, barely in Havenport at all. He had neighbors, but they were spaced farther than in the city proper. He opened the gate and crossed to his door, pausing for a moment on the doorstep.
Usually he can suck it up and be happy with what he’s got, because having Cas as his platonic roommate who sometimes dates other guys is better than not having Cas in his life at all.
“Yeah, well, almost doesn’t get the job done. I’m good.” He moved back towards his sofa. “Sorry, gotta sit. I can move around, but it’s hard, and I’m supposed to still take it easy.” He lowered himself into the cushions, then patted the arm of the chair beside him.
He offers one of his blinding grins, the one that always makes Cas wonder what mischief he’s planning. He reaches out and hugs Dean, slapping him on the back just hard enough to make Dean rock.
“Thank you, Dean.” Castiel stood, lingered for just a moment, resenting his job in a way that he rarely did. “Perhaps I will see you on site.”
Dean sighed. “I always miss her the second she’s gone. Sam and Jess too, I suppose, but mostly Mariel.” He smiled crookedly at Cas, glad that he at least was still here.
Ellen set a bottle of beer in front of Dean, popping the cap off and tossing it into the bucket behind the bar. “Rumor has it you’ve been working up at the Albright place. That why you haven’t been around much lately?”
“Thank you, it is,” he said, his hand reflexively coming up to stroke the tie down the center of his chest. As far as Dean could tell it was an ordinary tie. Zach Adler wasn’t exactly on the cutting edge of fashion. He tended to wear black or dark gray suits with black or dark gray ties. This one was dark gray, but maybe there was some sort of a stripey pattern woven into it, that caught the light differently.
That struck uncomfortably close to home. Castiel stood up and walked to the window, looking out sightlessly over the ocean.
Cas opened the door a moment later. His hair was disheveled, his eyes perhaps too wide, but he was freshly shaven, and wearing that pair of jeans that looked insanely good on his ass. He also wore a slouchy blue sweater, sleeves pushed up to his elbows.
a man. His original impression of Teeth and Eyes was confirmed. The head was far more globe-shaped than any person he’d ever encountered, with wispy hair of uneven length growing from a grey skull mottled with green that resembled nothing so much as lichen.
“So then what possible reason could there be for making one of them leave if they’re going to date? They both do a good job.”
A pang of longing shoots through him from head to toe. He clenches his fist in the soft cotton of the quilted coverlet. He can’t turn around. He can’t. Cas is asleep and doesn’t know what he’s doing. If he knew, he’d be utterly mortified. Dean would be, too, if Cas knew that all it took for him to pop a boner was for Cas’ mouth to land anywhere on his skin. His breath tickles. He’s so warm. It feels so damned
Then he’d heard a growl that raised the hair on the back of his neck. Most likely that had been a dog, and yet he’d still felt uneasy. The result was tossing and turning in his bed for hours before finally falling into a fitful sleep.
Cas took a series of long, slow breaths. “Gabriel warned me they were up to something. He also told me I should inform you, which I didn’t do. I suppose… I suppose I was hoping that if I ignored it, it would go away. I know better. I really do.”
“Analyzing myths and symbols, I remember.” Dean took a sip of his beer. “Maybe next time I come by you’ll loan me one of your books. I’m curious.”
Castiel had significant doubts whether there was actual love and romance involved in this event. Not because dragonkind weren’t capable of loving humans. They could and did spend a great deal of time in human form, and were certainly capable of love and enjoying sexual congress in that form. No, his doubts were grounded in Lord Michael, and of what he knew about Bela Talbot.
Dean raised a brow at that. Bela worked in Sales, though she wasn’t one of his direct reports. She was an assistant working for Cal Jenkins, the director for the North region. She had a reputation as being very ambitious, which Dean could admire. Nothing wrong with being ambitious. He was ambitious himself. Still, something about her made him uncomfortable. She played the game too hard, he thought. Worked the relationships inside the company, rather than making her mark with the clients and letting her work speak for itself.
Dean chuckles. Trust Cas to turn a simple question of how far east they are into a discussion on how much distortion occurs in any given type of map.
Cas’ lip twitches, his eyes twinkling in amusement. “Here.” He hands Dean his earbuds. “Listen to your favorite music, and I’ll be right here. If you need to grip something, take my hand.”
The next hours passed in a surreal haze. Castiel found the small wooden cart and took it, feeling a strange mix of guilt and exhilaration. By the time he returned, Dean had wrapped the remains in scraps of canvas he must have found amongst the waste in the alley, and had done his best to remove the blood. If they were fortunate there would be rain tonight. If not, they might need to return with buckets of water and nonchalantly rinse the cobblestones, hoping that no authority figures passed in their direction.
“Oh. Yes. Of course.” He rearranged her to safely pass her back to her mother, his arms immediately feeling empty when she was gone. He touched her tiny hand one last time, his finger lingering, before he pulled his hands back and pushed them into his pockets.
“NO!” Roman screeched, launching towards the object as it exploded in a cascade of shards, releasing a cloud of sickly green and purple. Castiel had the brief impression of a human form, but there was no time to study it.
After Castiel signed some papers, and promised to read through some of the more complicated bits and ask any questions, Sam gathered his things together and excused himself.
Cas tilted his head to the side. “Then you are not necessarily averse to continuing our acquaintance? No. I must be more direct. Charlie is always telling me that I am far too vague and unspecific when dealing with other people. It usually serves me well, when I am moving among humans without wishing to “out myself”.” He even used finger quotes. Who even did that any more?
On top of that, he still needed to find somewhere to live. He was in a long-term stay hotel right now, and no lies, that place was a little scary. Still, it was so much better than a lot of the places they’d stayed when he and Sammy were kids, when Dad had gone off the rails, in those dark years between Mom’s death and when they finally ended up with Bobby.
Castiel considered for a moment, then shrugged one shoulder. “Perhaps it helped that it was a very specific topic. If you think he’s trustworthy, then yes. He seemed to know what he’s doing, and I would rather not have to meet with other people simply for the sake of getting additional bids.”
“Not anything particularly, no. Not above everything else. This is rather the quintessential American small town atmosphere, isn’t it.”
“Ghoul,” Dean answered, nonchalant. “Usually they disguise themselves walking around looking like the last person they ate. This… does not bode well.”
“I agree that Aragorn is ‘hot’,” Cas said. “Though for different reasons. I find his steadfast devotion to Arwen appealing, as well as his noble character.”
With a final shriek of protest the framing was pulled away, and the whole back of the house collapsed in a cloud of dust.
“Not indoctrinating. Educating. It’s what you do with children. You educate them on what’s important in life. Okay. I’m going to put some Zepp on while dinner finishes. Apparently sometimes you have to educate adults too.”
He moved forward, his gaze unerringly flitting from one security device to the next. Cas briefly wondered what his plan was to deal with them. Did he even plan to? Was he counting entirely on his speed in his draconic form to escape, after he did whatever he was going to do?
He almost went up to Cas’ office then and there, but… he couldn’t, right? Not after not saying anything right away. And it was over. He’d stood up for himself. It was his right to choose who to hire. It was.
“I have reason to believe that one of the Wing is present and intending to disrupt the wedding proceedings. He goes by the name of Gordon.” He pulled out his phone, quickly keyed in his code to open the lock screen, and turned the screen towards Dean.
“Yeah, she did last a long time. Impressive.” He tossed the can on top of the cookie sheet. Castiel winced at the loud banging sound it made.
“I made a divider to keep them separate. I saw it on Pinterest. It’s quite clever, really. You cut down some cardboard to the size you need, making feet on the bottom so that it’ll support itself, then cover it in tin foil. Then you take one of those plastic liners, a large one, and tuck it down into each of the compartments. That keeps the different sauces separate. People have amazing ideas when they need to solve a problem. I find it quite inspiring.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted him, navigating the treacherous route between them with the added obstacle of his grocery cart. He glanced into Cas’ basket. Just a basket, not a whole cart. Smart move, that. Had to be easier to get around this hellscape without a cart. Not much in there, though. He spotted a bunch of carrots, tied at the tops, looking rather wilty this time of year, along with a carton of eggs and a bag of deli turkey.
Gabriel laughed. “Oh yeah. Frogs and mud, and you watching them all seriously, and getting upset when Luc captured the frog you were observing and pulled on its legs.”
“Work one of these myself? No, that wasn’t my intent.” He toyed with a piece of paper. “Kevin – Mr. Tran – mentioned Malak. Supposedly Roman is near obsessed with his history and the legends surrounding his entrapment. He believes that a part of Malak is still… not exactly alive, but not dead, either. Contained. And under the right circumstances, he could be brought back.”
“Good choice. You want to help? I can show you what to do, and stop you from making any big mistakes.”
“No, but you are a specialist with a lot of training and a lot of responsibility. I’m proud of what you do. You shouldn’t minimize it.”
“Bartholomew… Bartholomew never gave of himself. He took, and took, and took some more, making it seem as though I was the one who was at fault when he wasn’t able to take any more. He made me feel as though I was constantly failing, that nothing I did was good enough, and somehow he made me believe that pleasing him was something I should want.
He was going to start by not thinking about it for a few days, though. Maybe a little whiskey. Not too much, though. Been there, done that, didn’t have any intentions of returning.
Now, he wasn’t sure it was worth the risk of Walker getting to ‘The Flight’ before he did. Having the palace security alerted was important, but he didn’t dare rely on them entirely. There was a reason that dragonkind were dominant over humans. The Walker Wing had resources. They were capable of working around the anti-dragon measures just as much as the Novaks were.
“Cas, man, this is amazing!” Dean clapped him on the back, then pulled him in for a quick, fierce hug.
Cas takes a sip of his wine. It’s very good wine. Zach and Naomi spared no expense. Cas figures there’s no reason not to indulge. He and Dean are staying right here at the estate. No driving required. All he’ll have to negotiate is a couple flights of stairs, should he choose to get intoxicated.
It doesn’t fit any more. Apparently he’s gotten a little broader across the shoulders, filled out a bit around the waist. Which means he needs a suit for the wedding, and has to pretend like he doesn’t, because Cas would Not Be Happy if he knew Dean had to spring for a suit for this shindig.
“Cas, you rebel, you,” Dean said, grinning in appreciation and approval. “All the while neglecting to share the specifics with the fam?”
“That’s not fair, man. I’m not as good with words as you are. Didn’t Gabe say you’re a writer? Of, what was it, something on ancient literature?”
“But you’re an architect. You pay attention to things like floor plans, flow, window placement. Everything.”
He could see the consideration in those blue, blue eyes, weighing and discarding various responses. Finally Cas shrugged one shoulder and tilted his head to one side, meeting Dean’s gaze unapologetically. “Do you know anything about the art?”
He nodded. “Perhaps, if the classes were at a good time, I might join you. I’ve thought about it on occasion. I would like Sandover to do more in reaching out to different communities that have a harder time getting a job. The deaf community is one that we’ve been connecting with. If I could communicate at least a few simple phrases through ASL I think it would make candidates feel more welcomed.”
The man was unfairly attractive, particularly focused like this. He looked entirely at home in Castiel’s space. He had untapped depths, certainly. “If you’re a private investigator, that implies that someone is paying you for your work. Who hired you for this job?”
“I haven’t been here in Havenport for long, but this library has been my priority. The rest of the house isn’t as well-appointed. Given your expertise, however, I doubt your interest lies elsewhere.”
“It seems to be some sort of journal or memoir. The text isn’t particularly organized. It will go off on a tangent for many paragraphs, and whether it returns to the initial thought or not is inconsistent. I’ve skimmed through the entire book, reading what I can without researching the symbols. I have enough familiarity with Enochian to be able to read some passages, enough to get the gist of what is being said even if some words and phrases will require further research and analysis.”
Cas sat across from him in the booth. Times like this, when they were out with Charlie and Dorothy, he often got this wistful feeling. For all intents and purposes they were double dating, except they weren’t actually dating at all. He refused to be jealous of his friends. Just because his heart ached every time Charlie looked at Dorothy with adoring eyes, every time she bumped up against her, every time they whispered something and laughed… Dean sighed.
“It will be,” Dean said confidently. “I’m going to do my best work for you. I’ll make sure the crew leaves you alone. You can hole up in your study with… hey, that reminds me.” He reached into the bag he’d brought with him, pulling out a box awkwardly wrapped with newsprint. “Here.”
Dean clearly saw his capitulation. A fond smile crossed his lips, and he relaxed back into his chair. “Tell me this. Based on what you’ve read, does magic seem to be a skill that only some possess? Or could anyone do it, with the right knowledge?”
The potential trouble with the Bela situation paled in comparison. It shouldn’t. They were serious charges, and honestly he didn’t know how he was going to prove his innocence. He could lose his job over that.
“Fair enough, and I’d have to agree. On first reading they seem like a straight-forward adventure, but then there are themes and shit that just sneak up on you. I like that they don’t shy away from difficult stuff, but that they’re still hopeful. There’s enough depressing crap going on in the world. I like to have some go-to fiction for when I want to feel good about something.”
Cas cleared his throat. “Claire and I have had some discussions about the meaning of Thanksgiving,” he explained. “About how there are some aspects that are culturally troublesome, but that the idea of getting together with family and friends, and taking the time to acknowledge the things that we’re thankful for, is valuable.”
“No. Let’s consider our options a little longer, but we can’t afford to take too long to decide. Perhaps bring in Gabriel as well, so that it isn’t our decision alone.”
Cas pulled his lunch out one item at a time, arranging them neatly in front of himself. Dean scanned it curiously. The dude usually ate healthy, except for when he indulged in the cheeseburgers with them. Today was no exception. The sandwich looked like some sort of whole grain bread with turkey and sprouts, plus a container of carrot sticks and celery, and an apple. The grand finale was a small container of home-made hummus.
He’d learned many things that way, developed some interests he might otherwise never had encountered.
“Actually we do. I asked him what his holiday plans were. He said he’s spending Christmas with his family, but he’ll be back on the 28
Going back to their regular lives is surreal. It may have been only a handful of days, but being able to openly show how he really felt about Cas had been amazing. Now, back at the house they share, Dean just feels weird.
“I know, it’s a great place, or at least it could be. Kind of sad to see how shabby it is, but it’s got great potential.”
“Yeah. They are, because they’re dicks that way. I’ll work on them, but I don’t expect it to succeed. They like keeping you under control. They like keeping me under control too, but I’m better at making it more pain than it’s worth. You, you don’t like the conflict. Living here, though, you have a shot at making them forget about you. You okay with talking to Winchester?”
Fuck. Awkward flirting. “I’ll just bet you are.” And did he really just say that? His mouth did not have permission to say that.
“I have,” Cas says. “I’ve looked at various house plans on the internet, and considered what I want long-term, and looked at my monetary situation. It doesn’t make sense to me to only do the bare minimum of what needs to be done. If I’m going to renovate, I would prefer to do it all at once.”
Castiel saved those for later. He wasn’t particularly hungry, though he appreciated the two bottles of water that Gabriel had stuffed in his pockets. He thought he might look up that recipe with the tater tots. It was strangely delicious, and he liked to cook. He found cooking soothing, the repetitive motions, the concrete result at the end. He needed to eat, so it was practical too.
“No,” Gabriel answered. “She and our parents had a bit of a falling out when we were young. Castiel would have been eight or nine at the time.”
This would be so much easier if he waited until his kitchen was complete. Then he would be in his own space, with all of the beautiful new appliances installed. He’d have the professional-quality stovetop with six burners, including an indoor grilling surface. The tools he had to work with in Dean’s tiny apartment made everything so much more complicated — but not impossible. He wanted to do it now, though. He didn’t want to wait.
“I’m sorry, dude, but reading about emotions and what people are thinking isn’t at all the same thing as learning how to read someone’s facial expressions and body language. Even TV, everything’s edited and carefully constructed to make things clear, including the soundtracks. You get a bouncy happy song in a major key when Dr. Sexy looks at Dr. Piccolo, you get an entirely different interpretation than if you use that same footage and underlay it with an ominous growling rumble.”
When Cas shuffles into the kitchen in the morning, he has to physically stop himself from ruffling his hair and kissing him lightly on the lips. When he comes home from the hospital and Cas is sitting on the couch, he wants to drop down beside him, so close that their bodies are pressed together head to toe, but he can’t.
“Honestly? I don’t know. It’s the sort of thing that I’m hoping I’ll know it when I see it.” He grinned when Castiel made a face. “Not generally in favor of following your gut instincts, are you, Cas.”
It was difficult to talk when his throat felt tight and he knew his face was flushed. But something about her was kind without being pitying, open and warm. So he focused on her and somehow found the words. “I greatly prefer it to Chicago. The house is everything I never knew I wanted, and will be more so in time, after the renovations are complete. Whenever that will be.”
Soon they were seated at a table in a corner of the Anchor. The luncheon rush was over, so there weren’t many other patrons around. Castiel preferred it that way. He didn’t particularly enjoy being in crowds.
The grocery store two days before Thanksgiving was a particularly cruel and inventive form of torture, Dean thought to himself as he narrowly avoided getting clipped by a shopping cart wielded by a wild-eyed suburban mom. “Son-of-a-b…”
He swallowed. “No. It wasn’t just something I said. Cas. I… I meant it. Every word.” He stepped forward, reached out to grip Cas’ bicep through the coat. The heat burned, in the best way. “Every word. Does this mean…” He tugged lightly at Cas’ blue-striped tie. “You quit.”
“A small amount of work conversation after hours isn’t completely off limits,” he finally said. “I am generally in favor of promoting from within, but I agree that the internal candidates are, perhaps, not ready for a more senior position. Have you had a chance to look at all of the resumes I’ve forwarded to you?”
“Awesome.” He grinned. After rinsing the worst of the garden dirt off with the garden hose, he followed Cas inside the kitchen.
Or if he wanted to get the security force watching for something else as a distraction. No. That was certainly a possibility, but he didn’t believe it. Still, he’d keep an eye out. Just because he didn’t believe Cas was setting up some sort of an elaborate distraction didn’t mean he wouldn’t still be alert and observant about the situation as a whole. He wouldn’t cut off any existing security measures in favor of anything driven by Cas’ warning.
“Hm. Okay, I guess you can manage, at least temporarily. Any particular instructions for the things in your apartment?”
Friday is a lovely day. After a lively breakfast where Dean entertained Cas’ cousins’ children with silly stories and faces, the two of them head out to town by themselves. Cas plays tour guide, pointing out various historical sites and how the styles of architecture in use tell a story all by themselves. It’s lovely and relaxing after the chaos at the estate.
Dean grinned. “Quick service here, especially during the slow time of day. Besides, you were getting deep inside your head there. Interesting stuff. But now… time to try the best burger you’ve ever had in your life.”
Cas considered that. “Yes, I have met Sam, and on more than one occasion. I have not spent time with him socially, however.”
He paused, though, and pulled out his phone. He scrolled through his contacts until he found it. Castiel.
According to the information in the book, the salt of the sea water needed to mingle with blood. Roman pulled forth a blade from within his robes, examining its edge with an unholy glee.
Castiel flushed a moment, looking away. “Good morning. Do you drink coffee? I’ve put some water on to boil.”
“Yes. You’re so serious all the time, Cas. A smile and a bit of laughter is good for you. Now let’s choose a spell.”
Cas nods. "That's fine. I always liked it up on this floor better anyhow, so if the price is some noisy cousins, well, I’ll pay that." He turns towards Dean. "The rooms up here are a lot smaller, and you’ve probably noticed the ceilings are lower. They get lower with each floor. About a hundred years ago, this floor was primarily servant quarters, though the nursery was also up here. The rooms were converted after live-in staff went out of fashion."
Castiel stood up and went to find the cleanser and some paper towels. By the time he’d finished polishing what was actually a lovely table, the lawyer had arrived. He straightened, feeling his shoulders tense and his pulse race.
The whole family has arrived, though they aren’t all seated yet. Dean looks around and spots Cas’ grandmother easily. She’s seated at the head of the table, though her chair isn’t pushed in. She’s small, white hair arranged in a neat chignon atop her head.
“I have also wanted you to kiss me for a long time. And to kiss you. So.” He took a breath and stepped forward, placing one hand on Dean’s cheek. “May I?” His gaze dropped to Dean’s mouth, then rose back to his eyes.
Cas turned to face Dean. “I don’t know, honestly. By the time I was home again it had been years. I hope it was, because the alternative doesn’t bear thinking about. He was a wonderful person, Alfie. Sweet, intelligent, kind. He didn’t deserve what happened to him. But we were talking about you, not me. And Richard Roman.”
“Hello,” he guy said. His voice was low and gravelly, the sort of voice that sent delicious tingles running down Dean’s spine. “I’m Castiel Novak, with Human Resources. I’ll be getting your paperwork squared away and running you through orientation.” He set his own copy of the Sandover binder down. It was quite a bit thicker than the one Dean had been given “Orientation is scheduled for your first two hours here, and then your managers will meet you to continue your introduction with job-specific matters.
“I actually did have some warning,” Sam admitted. “I was aware that someone was looking into the county records of Mrs. Albright and her husband. I got copies of everything that was released to them, so I knew we were fine, from a legal standpoint. Challenging a will generally requires grounds a lot stronger than not liking the terms. It’s a person’s right to leave their property to whoever they want, within certain parameters that don’t apply in this case, so your ownership of the property is solid.”
Well. Nothing to be gained by standing on the step. He unlocked the cottage door and went inside, lighting the oil lamp and going about his evening routine. After making himself a simple meal, he settled down to read through more of the strange book Mr. Winchester had delivered to him.
Becky’s smile doesn’t leave her lips. She steps back a half step, and looks at the two of them. “I’m just so happy to see the two of you so happy. Maybe in another year or two there’ll be another wedding here, hm?” She reaches out to squeeze Cas’ hand.
“Sam. Winchester.” Cas’ eyes widened. “Of course. I should have known. I am familiar with the name, though we have never met. Are you also, then, associated with one Bobby Singer?”
He headed straight for the refrigerator, scanning the contents. Ah, there it was--a large bottle of mango/passionfruit juice blended with protein powder. Even in his human form he needed more protein. The powdered form wasn’t as satisfying as a large medium rare steak fresh off the grill, but it was fast and easy and would suffice for now.
Charlie tapped the server on the arm. “Give that guy over there at the bar another of what he’s having,” she said, tucking a bill into the glass on his tray. “Compliments of my friend here.”
“So being an equal opportunity kind of a guy, you have to have noticed that Cas is attractive. And that the two of you click better than I’ve seen you with anyone since… ever?”
They’d built new supports inside to maintain the structural integrity of the part of the house that was to remain intact, but what if they somehow failed as well? Why had he agreed to this? Was he about to be responsible for irreparable damage to the old home he loved so well? He didn’t want to utterly destroy the existing home! His heart felt like it was jumping into his throat.
He wanted the dinner to go well. The Winchesters, all of them, had been welcoming and understanding of his challenges fitting in to this new community. Dean had given him free use of his own home while Cas’ house was undergoing construction. They’d never once made him feel that they thought he was weird or eccentric. They made him truly feel for the first time that what had happened to him wasn’t his fault and didn’t make him a lesser person.
She controlled a fond smile. “Yes, he’s been checked out. He’s going to have some lovely bruises, and he’ll be sore for a few days, maybe a week or two, but nothing more serious than pulled muscles and deep bruises. Might be a good idea to visit the doctor in the morning, just to be sure.””
He took a deep breath, then pulled out his phone, texting Charlie a quick, coded message to let her know he was going in.
“So anyhow,” he continued, “I’d like to treat you to lunch to thank you for the connection.” There. He’d done it. “Charlie Bradbury and I… you remember her? She was at my orientation too?”
So Sam and Bobby being interested in the community meant that there was at least some evidence that dragons lived there, dragons that weren’t sworn to Lord Michael and therefore any peace between them was uneasy at best.
, damn it. Dad may have been the one to come out and greet them, but there’s no guarantee there aren’t various aunts, uncles, and cousins watching them from any of the numerous windows.
“No, no, I won’t hear any protests. La la la.” She literally covered her ears, then stood up, leaned over to whisper something in Castiel’s ear. A faint blush rose to color the tips of his ears, then she kissed him on the cheek. “Toodles, dudes. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. Well, I take that back. Because, you know. There’s lots of fun you could get up to that I wouldn’t. Couldn’t. Anyhow. See ya on the flip side.” She waved, and then she was gone.
Cas shrugs one shoulder. “I don’t even know most of them. Social acquaintances of Naomi and Zachariah. Friends of Anna and Vincent. Some family friends that my grandmother has known for a very long time.”
The walls of the cavern were damp, but it appeared that symbols had been either painted onto the surface or carved and then lined with the luminescent mosses. They shed an eerie glow over the space.
“You can tell a lot by whether someone laughs or groans at them. Or, sometimes, a combination of the two.”
“Can check references. I can.” Gabriel knew that the idea of cold calling people was enough to give Castiel hives, while Gabriel had no problem at all with it. When they were children he’d pranked people on the phone so often that his phone had been confiscated. Not that he’d allowed that to stop him. He’d simply gotten more creative.
“Pie is much easier than bookshelves. It’s a matter of perspective — and where your skill sets lie.”
Dean knows this is it. This is the moment where everything changes, one way or another. Once he says anything, it can’t be unsaid.
Castiel hadn’t come across any works in Enochian in quite some time. It was an exceptionally rare language with very few extant works – which was a large part of his excitement over the book coming into his life. Before starting his translations in earnest, he picked up one of his own books and read through it, letting the familiarity of the work remind him of how to read and understand the language. He’d always had a knack for languages and recognizing patterns and symbols. When he’d realized those talents could be used to study ancient texts in dead languages, he’d known his life’s purpose.
Cas raised his chin slightly in a gesture Dean knew meant he was bracing himself to say something he wasn’t sure would get the reaction he wanted, but felt was important enough to say anyhow. “Dean Winchester. Would you do me the honor of joining me for dinner? As… as my date?”
“Yes. I would like the kitchen completed as quickly as is reasonable, though I recognize that first I need to make decisions as to what I wish to have done. I have been putting together some ideas. I will be ready to discuss them and get your thoughts within the next couple days.”
Cas was surprised to find that he was actually tempted by the offer. “Yes… yes, I will consider that. Thank you.”
Okay then. Dean picks up his phone to check the time. 9:30 pm. Early for Cas to get back from his date; Friday night dates usually go to at least midnight, if not the next morning.
wife. And most likely, Sam’s baby. Dean’s niece. Not Dean’s baby, not Dean’s wife. Dean wasn’t married.
Cas startled and turned towards him. Dean nearly gasped. Before he hadn’t noticed that he had eyes such an intense blue that they nearly glowed. He hadn’t noticed the unruly way his hair stuck out in various angles, as though someone had just run their hand through it. A tingle of attraction raced through him, just like it had last night.
He opened the bottle and drank a third of the contents in a single long pull, wiping his mouth afterwards. Plucking an apple from the bowl of fruit on the counter, he went to sit down beside her on the sofa. “What are you working on?”
If it was anyone else he’d think they were trying to flatter him in order to get something from him, but Charlie always said exactly what she was thinking. She was right, though. He tended to keep to himself when he wasn’t on the case. An accidental slip in a social situation could spell disaster.
He picked up the pace, not quite jogging, but lengthening his stride and moving quickly. There was a lot of distance to cover. Soon he rounded the corner to the vast hallway leading to the antechamber, slowed down, and eased around the edge of the wall. He paused a moment to let his vision adjust; it was dimmer in here, without the floodlights illuminating the courtyard proper.
When Dean said he needed a few weeks to catch up on his other commitments, Cas honestly didn’t expect to see him at all until he was ready to start working on some of the other projects. He pushed aside the unhappy feeling in his chest, ignoring it as he always ignored inconvenient emotions, and when that failed, channeled the feelings into writing emotion-laden scenes in the next Steven Emmanuel manuscript.
Shit. Maybe he had been distracted, focused on what might be going on with Adler and Bela, especially now that he’d sent the offer to Billie and she’d accepted.
Mr. Winchester shook Gabriel’s hand and smiled at Castiel, not making a move to try and shake his hand. That was interesting, and refreshing. He hadn’t even made one of those aborted gestures that people made when they started to do something and then changed their mind halfway through the motion. It was just a smooth evaluation and transition into the simple smile.
“Aargh.” He buried his face in his arms. “Fine. Ask him. We don’t even know if he’s going to be in town.”
Dean was the last one to make it to the front door. Charlie looked pointedly at her wrist, though she wasn’t actually wearing a watch. Cas simply stood patiently, hands lightly clasped in front of himself. The way he stood made the shoulders of his suit jacket bunch up strangely. Dean firmly squashed the desire to fix it.
He hopes it lasts this time. He distinctly remembers positioning himself exactly this way before turning off the bedside lamp to begin with.
“That’s a difficult question to answer. There are things in each that I greatly appreciate, sometimes things that I didn’t even recognize until longer after my first pass through them.”
Dean swallowed and played with a pen to give himself a moment. Damn, did this guy have any idea how hot he was? He hit all of Dean’s check boxes. Dark hair just long enough to bury his fingers in? Check. Intense blue eyes? Check. Killer thighs? Check. And that voice… shit.
That was for another day, however. Today he was going to walk along Caroline’s main street. Perhaps he would even smile and nod to people he encountered. He didn’t have to go inside any of the shops if he didn’t want to, but that was an option too.
Ellen came around herself to take their order. “Hey there, boys,” she said. “Welcome to the Roadhouse.” That was directed more towards Cas.
Dean, Sam and Jess chatted amiably about the baby and various everyday types of things as they ate pizza and got the table set up for poker, giving Cas the time and space he needed to get his feet under himself again without being obvious about it. He deeply appreciated it.
Wont to do so? Dean stifled a grin. He didn’t know if he’d ever heard anyone use that phrase in actual speech, not just some stuffy old literature novel. It was kind of adorable -- and kind of hot. Who knew he had a kink for archaic usage of language? “No apology necessary. I think it’s an interesting thought. And this isn’t the big city. There’s time for digression. It makes things way more interesting than just sticking to the topic all the time, don’t you think? And if you never get back to the original topic, then it wasn’t all that important to begin with, or else we’ll just catch up on it another time.”
Now that was a loaded question. Dean really, really, really didn’t want to make Cas uncomfortable. But he also didn’t want to be dishonest. So how did he phrase the answer in a way that wouldn’t set Cas on edge, at least not any more on edge than he already was?
The hooded figures turned towards Castiel as one, stepping forward. Adrenaline surged through him. It was now or never – and he had never done this before.
“He asked about your place, actually,” Sam continued, either oblivious to the looks Dean was sending him or pretending to be. Cas would wager on the latter. Sam was, in his experience, extremely observant.
Michael and Luc returned in the late morning, carrying Styrofoam cups of hot coffee. “Didn’t think to bring us any, huh?” Gabriel groused. “Or, you know, hot chocolate. Coffee shops usually sell hot chocolate too. With whipped cream. And sprinkles.”
He tightened his hand into a fist. “I was thinking that I should go. If I stay any longer I will be tempted to stay far too late, and I must be at my best tomorrow.”
“I will be in touch as well. And perhaps after the wedding… perhaps.” Unlikely. But perhaps he would allow himself that tiny bit of recklessness, or at least the hope of it. “Good bye.”
Cas leaned in, touching his mouth to Dean’s. Last night there had been the taste of alcohol on Cas’ lips, pleasant but vaguely disturbing at the same time. This morning the only flavor was the mint of Cas’ toothpaste, and the unmistakable taste of Cas himself.
Michael directed a piercing look at Castiel. “Request the information, Castiel,” he said. “Ask for the copies of the bank statements and any investment documents that might be relevant.”
The room inside is nice, spacious by Dean's standards if cramped in comparison to the other rooms in this place. There are two modestly sized windows with blue and yellow striped drapes, an armoire, two night-tables with lovely lamps on them, one on either side of the bed. The bed itself is covered with a quilted coverlet, exquisitely pieced together in bright colors. Fluffy pillows are perfectly arranged against the headboard. There's a big oval braided rag rug on the wide-planked wooden floor. On the whole it's a much more comfortable room than the suffocating formality on the main levels. Their bags are sitting against the wall just inside the door.
“Fuck, you’re Steven Emmanuel.” Dean reached behind himself to support himself with one hand on the wall. “And this is the first book in the new trilogy I’ve been dying to read. Months before it’s actually released. Shit, Cas. I can’t believe this.”
“Fuck yes, I like that. But you’re right. I’m a mess. Let me… let me take a quick shower, huh? Here you are looking like a dream, and I’m a mess.” Dean brushed his fingers over Cas’ shoulders. “This is my favorite suit of yours. The Wednesday suit.”
“I called Gabriel, even though I knew Bartholomew would be furious about that too. It was an international call, and therefore outrageously expensive. Gabriel thinks it wasn’t the money, it was that I was talking to someone who cared about me and had a more objective point of view. Gabe knew something was badly wrong, so he returned home. The rest of the story is ugly and lengthy and … and sad, but it ended with me on my own again, this time in an apartment leased by the family under Michael’s name.”
They walk from the terrace doors to the path leading towards the garden. There are large urns filled with white and pink flowers, spiky ones and full blooms, tiny ones spilling over the sides in cascades. They’re lovely and smell good, but Dean has no idea what they are. There are roses in there. Those, at least, he’s confident in the label. A string quartet plays soft churchy music, hidden behind a screen.
Dean smiled crookedly, shrugging one shoulder. “True. I grew up here in good old Caroline, Kansas. Small town, neighbors who were always aware of my business.”
What the hell was he supposed to say to that? It certainly couldn’t be ‘thank you’. No one could know about Steven Emmanuel. No one but Hannah. Not even Gabriel knew.
He carefully moved the porcelain out of the cabinet, stacking them on the countertop so that he could clean the shelves.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. I don’t remember all of the details… something about certain conditions of the tide, a ritual, being in the right location… it was all very specific. As I recall, most of the really powerful spells referenced in the journal require more than just words and intent. They require rituals, and are particularly potent during the full or new moon.” He glanced towards the window. It was full daylight right now, so the look revealed nothing, but… “Dean. I believe tonight is the night of the full moon.”
“Cas! Get your ass over here!” Meg growled impatiently. Cas shook his head to clear it, and followed her.
Dean moved to walk slightly ahead of Cas, eyes scanning the street as they moved along. There were many dark corners, a few alleys. Castiel didn’t usually pay much attention to them, since he walked this direction daily. Familiarity caused inattention, in his case. Far too often he paid much more attention to mentally teasing apart translations than to where he placed his feet. Translating wasn’t an exact science, after all, particularly with dead languages. People used idioms that didn’t make sense on a superficial level, so sometimes a literal translation wasn’t the most accurate one. Even a work as popular and well-known as the Bible had multiple translations, where some particular choices could notably change the meaning.
It seemed to take forever before he heard the sirens in the distance, but then suddenly Sheriff Mills was there, cuffing the man. Cas stood up, stumbling slightly at stretching his muscles after being so tense.
Cas fixed Dean with a flat look, then pointedly turned towards Charlie, dipping a carrot stick into the hummus.
The guy was maybe an inch or two shorter than Dean, about his age. His hair was such a dark brown as to nearly be black, styled in artful disarray. Either that or it had been styled more conservatively and he ran his hand through it so much that now it looked perfectly, deliciously mussed. He wore a navy suit with a blue striped tie and white shirt. It didn’t fit particularly well but still managed to look good. His shoulders filled out the jacket nicely, and though the trousers were slightly baggy, it still looked like he had great legs. He kind of wanted the guy to turn around so he could check out that ass.
Castiel stepped inside and seated himself in one of the chairs. It was far more comfortable than the old wooden chair in his own office.
Cas gave him a flat look that clearly communicated he wasn’t up for listening to Dean spin some bullshit story.
, Dean thought, a weird tightness in his chest. He scowled. A distraction like Cas was the last thing he needed right now. He certainly didn’t need to be noticing that the guy’s dark trousers fit his ass just so.
And yet, a voice whispered in the back of his mind, the thought of Dean and relationships might make him anxious and nervous, but he wasn't in a full-blown panic. He was lying flat on his mattress, not curled up tight in the fetal position around his pillow or locked in the turret room rocking on the floor with his back blocking the door. He didn't know what to make of that.
“Excellent.” He smiled and stepped into the small office, looking around briefly. “You have a lot of books.”
He needs a suit anyhow. Every guy should have at least one, right? Witness this occasion right here. Going to a wedding. Need a suit.
Dean makes a face. He doesn’t dress up for dinner except for the rare dinner date. Even his dates, such as they are, tend to be on the casual side. He nods though. “Okay. This is where I meet the grand matriarch of the family, huh?”
“Pulled pork to go along with the salad,” Jess informed him. “You know that’s a price you pay to eat here. There are some vegetables and non-protein or carb-based foods being served.”
“Oh, oh, this is one of my favorite scenes,” Dean said, leaning forward. On the screen, the huge doors in the Hornburg opened, and Aragorn walked through, returning from the presumed dead. “He just looks so hot right here. Those eyes. And the scruff.”
According to the maps of the area, the stream that ran through his property joined up with the river upstream of Caroline. Perhaps someday he would walk or even run that path, seeing what lay between here and there. It would be a long trip but certainly doable, assuming the terrain was negotiable. He found the idea appealing. Long walks by the water were pleasant, and soothing.
Dean grinned, pleased and impressed that Cas had remembered that. “Yeah. Someday I’d like to get into restoring classics as a hobby. When I have more room. Nice big garage, space to pull a car apart. For a while I thought I might go into that as a field, or maybe mechanical engineering, but…” He shrugged. A good mechanical engineering school was more expense than an average business school, and with Sam at Stanford they couldn’t afford two good schools. Sales was something he could rely more on his personality than on his degree. He knew how to turn on the charm without being oily and gross about it, and that went a long way in sales.
“I… I’ve been thinking, about something you said a while ago. About… Erin. Or at least, I’d thought it was Erin. E-r-i-n,” he spelled the name out. “But then, tonight, you and Sam were talking about Aaron, which was clearly an A-a-r-o-n. Are they two different people? Or the same?”
“You recall how I told you it mentioned many figures purported to be magicians? Figures who history cannot confirm ever existed? It goes on from there, intermingling notes on those ‘sorcerers’ with experiments in working magic themselves,” Castiel informed him, giving him a flat look. “They even claim some success, recording these spells as though they work. Unless it was intended as a work of fiction, it’s pure garbage. There is no such thing as magic, everyone knows that.”
Dean frowned and turned his attention to the beehive of activity below. There were so many people. Some were working on setting up the lights, ladders and those cherry-picker things lifting people in the air to fasten nets of tiny lights overhead. Others were working at a dozen long tables, unpacking accessories and cleaning them. Most of the people at the tables were female, but there was a guy among them, standing beside a petite blond, head tilted to the side as he listened.
Cas pulled another mug down from the cupboard, checked it quickly to make sure it was clean, then poured. “Cream or sugar?”
He figures he’s best off not giving Cas too much time to think about things. If Cas has time, he over-analyzes everything and overthinks it, which would ruin the spontaneity of his reactions to anything Dean says or does. Then he looks stilted and artificial. Not good. He needs to get Cas to relax and enjoy himself.
And the panel in the center of the vent hood had been replaced. No longer was it a simple piece of stained wood. Now? Now it was a beautiful piece of carved art, bas relief, a design of honeycomb and flowers and two exquisitely worked bees.
“I’m never too busy when you need to talk,” Sam said. “I just wish I wasn’t all the way in California right now. Maybe you can come out here for a bit, while you figure out what your next steps are.”
He reached over to pick up his phone. Nothing. Not that he expected anything. Hoped, maybe. No. Hope was a dangerous thing, and more often than not led to bitter disappointment. He’d learned very young that hope was cruel.
Dean huffed a laugh at that. Of course Cas would find character more important than physical appearance. But wait.
Cas’ gaze shifted to Dean, then away, then back again. He tugged at his tie, then straightened it. “It’s an issue I am passionate about,” he finally said. “I realize that it’s a strict policy, but I like it that way.”
“Dude. She’s been pushing me at you practically from the beginning. She knows I’ve been mooning after you forever. Yes. She’ll be thrilled. And those double dates can
He missed the bleak look in Cas’ face, since the other man was figuring out how to fasten his shoulder belt. “Yes, I would like to meet her.”
Cas looked offended. “Absolutely not. Wagering on the career prospects of new employees is completely inappropriate.”
“Mr. Roman and I are not close personal friends. We may have a shared interest in old books… though with what you’re telling me right now, the nature of our interest is unlikely to be the same. Why do you think Roman is involved?”
“That sounds amazing. I’ve heard all about your awesome cooking, but I haven’t had a chance to try it yet. Do you want me to bring anything? Bread? Maybe some beer? Or wine, I suppose, if you’re making fancy stuff.” Dean didn’t even pause, talking right through Cas’ panicked silence. Could it be that he hadn’t even noticed? Either that or was just disregarding it?
Two dragons twined about each other in the sunset sky, gold and red sinuous necks twisted about one another, tails wrapped in a perfect interlace knot. Their scales glittered metallic in the lowering sun, limned in the fading light. Grace and power was defined by the tension of muscles, the exhilaration of freefall, wings tucked just so, ready to snap out and catch the air at the critical moment. The ground was so far below that it was little but a vague indistinct haze of color. The image was vibrant, glowing, intense.
Dean is never going to tell anyone, ever, that he notices when a tee shirt makes someone’s eyes pop. Even if that someone is Cas, who definitely has the most beautiful eyes he’s ever seen.
He just … yeah. It might not be one sided, but that didn’t mean Cas actually wanted to do anything about it. That was the whole reason he’d pulled back last night.
Cas had to close his eyes tightly against the sting of tears. It had been so long. He should be over the pain. “He… had an accident, after I left. Before I even reached England. A carriage, in the narrow streets. They said the horses spooked, and Alfie was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” He shrugged. “A most unfortunate accident.”
“Not really. Just that they have very good bacon cheeseburgers, and you are close to the proprietor.”
“Thank you.” He took a sip, and yes, it was pleasant. He could taste the smooth sweetness of the honey under the malt.
“It’s Sam,” he said reflexively. Dean wondered if he even thought about it anymore, or if it was one of those classic call and response things. ‘Bitch’. ‘Jerk’. ‘Hey Sammy’. ‘It’s Sam.’
They stood there for longer than they should, just staring at each other, before Dean came to his senses enough to step aside, silently inviting Cas in.
He was wringing his hands right now as he searched for the words to convey what he was thinking, what he was feeling. The dichotomy sorta kinda made his head spin.
Dean frowned, not having moved ahead with Cas. His brain had stalled somewhere on ‘dragon’, and needed a moment to catch up.
Cas nodded again, carefully folded his hands together between his knees. It was mind-blowing, knowing that this man here in his apartment, sitting on his ratty old green velvet recliner, was not just an awkward but ridiculously hot guy in a trench coat, of all things, but was also a dragon.
Cas had really amazing lips, even if they were a bit chapped. They were pink and full and… and stop it, Winchester.
One day, about a week after Gabriel returned to Chicago, Dean came up to the turret room and knocked on the door. “Hey, Cas? I know you don’t like to be interrupted when you’re working, but there’s a truck here with a delivery. You want me to sign for it?”
“There is a rusty anchor outside the entrance. It may have originally had a different name. I’m not certain.”
He nonchalantly strolls into the house they’re sharing, attuned to Cas. There’s a lingering aroma of coffee in the air. That means Cas has been home long enough to make a pot of his afternoon coffee. Morning coffee tends to be a straight brew, but afternoon coffee? That can be an indulgence. Sometimes, if he’s feeling particularly in need of pampering, he’ll make himself a cappuccino, steaming the milk and everything. Or is that a latte? Dean can never keep those fancy coffee drinks straight in his head.
“That sounds awesome. I was thinking it’d be good to be close to the office, as long as that doesn’t make the cost ridiculous. This job has a big commission component to the salary, which means there’s great upside but also it’s going to take some time to build up a client base. So I don’t want to go with anything too crazy until I’m more established.”
They didn’t speak during the walk to the seaside cottage. But when they arrived, Dean paused. “Looks different by daylight,” he commented. “It’s got a certain charm to it. Do you garden, in the summer months?” He ran a hand over the wooden flowerbox mounted under the front window. The box was painted blue with yellow-centered white daisies painted along the upper edge.
“Didn’t live in a house, before?” Dean watched as Cas poured them each a tall glass of the lemonade, then sat down across from him at the small table.
The intensity was too much for Cas, so he shrugged a shoulder and turned away from Dean, looking out one of the windows towards the stream that ran through the property. He ran a finger over the frame of the window, thinking it was very smooth. “I hope it lives up to the anticipation you’ve been harboring,” he finally managed to say, pushing the words past the lump in his throat.
That had been his primary objection. If anyone found out, he would become a laughingstock. But in the context of current events, he couldn’t see that it would do any harm to follow the theory to any conclusions it might drive.
Fuck. Was that not okay? “Uh, yeah, sorry. Guess I’ve been shortening it in my head. I’ll stop if you don’t like it.”
Dean flicks his glance over to Cas, and suddenly Cas understands exactly what he was talking about with the bit about holding entire conversations without speaking a word. Dean wants him to roll with whatever he says.
“Not right now, thanks. I’m just trying to get a handle on how things work around here. I know I’m not going to get it all figured out tonight, but I’m getting a start at it.”
It didn’t make sense. Was Dean not together with the woman? They’d looked like they were together, but he supposed that appearances could be deceiving. Even if they weren’t together, it didn’t mean that they couldn’t have an amicable relationship for the sake of the child.
“Dude, they’re just jeans. They’ll be fine after a trip through the washer.” He stood up, moved behind Castiel and clapped him on the shoulder. Dude was warm, warmer than he would have expected. Full body blush, maybe?
“Well, that’s true. Also I can safely just call you my favorite brother, because, after all, who’s the competition? Question stands. How are you doing?”
“Maybe.” He couldn’t deny that he’d considered it, but damn. How do you just go from talking about the latest details on the remodel to just dropping in a little ‘by the way, I’ve had both boyfriends and girlfriends, and the style of the plumbing makes no difference to me’? Big deep conversations weren’t his cup of tea. He hated talking about anything that smacked of emotions.
Dean laughed again, stroked Castiel’s hand and played with his fingers briefly before turning and heading back towards the cottage at a loping run.
“You sound like Jess. She’s an artist. Goes on about color theory once in a while. I pretend to tease her about it, but really it’s good to know when I do the occasional painting job. Sometimes people know exactly what they want, but other times they just say ‘blue’ and want me to pick the right blue. With what I’ve learned from Jess, I know better why a particular blue will or won’t work with their woodwork and trim.”
By the time Sam walked into the house Mariel was sound asleep, but Dean hadn’t moved to put her in her crib. His brother stopped when he saw Dean. “Oh yeah, forgot you were coming for lunch today,” he said, keeping his voice low to not wake the baby.
“Yeah, you did, but I understand. It’s a lot. Guess I’m not as surprised as you are that Hester would have cut Mikey and Luc out. She really didn’t like them. I’m probably more surprised she didn’t leave the whole thing to her causes, but she must have remembered you fondly from when you were little. You always were a polite little cuss. Weird, too.”
“He did, but it got a little crazy. Apparently the two older nephews weren’t terribly thrilled with everything going to the youngest, and… yeah. They went back to Chicago now, though, so Sam was talking to the other two today.”
“I don’t know, man. I mean, the spark should be there at least at first, don’t you think? Whether the spark comes first or the friendship comes first, there should be a spark at some point.”
After returning to his office, Castiel worked on the translation for a little while before his meeting with Director Holloway. He was occasionally distracted by thoughts of Dean and the death he was investigating. Did Dean think the young man’s demise was somehow related to his investigation? If so, how?
“Yes. They’re quite fascinating. And I suppose there are some similarities, yes. I’ve seen objects similar to this before. I’m not entirely sure where, but it looks familiar enough for me to believe I’ve seen something similar.”
“I had a similar thought, earlier. That would have been… well. That’s an exercise in futility, isn’t it? It didn’t happen that way, and who knows. It might well have been disastrous, rather than the idyllic boyhood summers we’d dream of.”
Soon they were arranged in front of the television, Cas and Dean on the sofa, Charlie curled up in the recliner. Some of the bowls of chips were relocated to the coffee table in front of the TV.
“Dammit, Cas!” Dean barely waited to slide into their booth at the diner before swearing at his friend. “Mildred? Really? Doesn’t that show just how stupid the policy is? What does it matter if the receptionist is dating the building manager? What’s he going to do, show favoritism by filling her repair requests faster than anyone else’s?”
Sam frowned thoughtfully. “Yeah… okay, I can see that. I don’t know that he would see it like that.”
“I wouldn’t say odd. At least not in a bad way. Just because you liked different things from your brothers didn’t make you odd.”
Damn. Dean could already feel his next few free evenings evaporating into oil changes, new exhaust systems, and teaching Cas basic auto maintenance. He’d have to check the steering and the brakes, take a look at the timing belt, make sure there weren’t any leaks — all for an ugly-ass car that in his opinion should have never been on the road in the first place.
It had taken a surprisingly short time to build enough of a client base to pay the bills and even expand. They’d hired Mildred Baker to be their receptionist and administrative assistant, then brought on Charlie’s friend Kevin Tran as a second tech consultant. They were considering bringing in a third in the near future, if they could find someone with the right fit.
He cleared his throat. “So… first up, let me say I’m sorry for your loss. Mrs. Albright was a wonderful lady. We’ll miss her in Caroline.”
Castiel reached out, their fingers touched, and then their palms. A shiver of attraction trilled through his body, electric sparks tingling, racing, rebounding back again to settle in his chest with an ache of regrets. Dean’s thumb rubbed over his knuckle, just this side of a caress, and Castiel’s mind went places it shouldn’t. He made a sound of unhappiness, then pulled his hand away again and shoved it deep into the pockets of his trench.
Cas can’t deny that. He sighs. “There are three sitting rooms, and two additional rooms that you might quantify as a living room and a parlor. The difference between them is largely a question of semantics.”
Dean stared at the phone. What the hell? That was… okay. This did not exactly give him warm fuzzies.
“For the sake of argument, let’s say there is something more than fantasy to this book of spells,” he agreed. He pushed the pile of his translation across to Dean after quickly locating some of the relevant sections. “There seem to be different types of spell. The author delves into spells of healing, weather working, calling fire and other types of energy, and summonings. That last category makes me uncomfortable. Calling forth spiritual animals for various purposes seems like it could easily turn to malicious intent.”
Dean laughed. He would not have expected that out of Cas. “Sure. If that’s how you want to put it.” He crossed over to the old turntable. He moved the speakers so they’d be directed towards the kitchen, then located his prized vinyl and started it playing. “Yeah?”
Castiel nodded. “You can take some time to decide. And while you’re thinking about it… you’ll need a place to stay.” He ducked his head diffidently. “I don’t have a lot of room here, but maybe it’s enough?”
It was tempting to offer his couch; he didn’t really want to take him home. Didn’t want to be away from him.
“How’s this afternoon sound? I have to finish up this project, but I can swing by and pick you up around three or four and we can scope out what he’s got. Some of them take too much work to pull right away, but he’s always got some that are either working or close enough that we could get it up and running within a day or two.”
Dean tried to watch, but his vision was blurring. He touched his chest, hissed with pain, brought his hand back to see red on it.
“I apologize for the lack of comfortable sleeping accommodations.” There wasn’t really anything other than the overstuffed chair, but he could give Dean his pillows.
“The douchebags,” Cas agrees. “Naomi is the oldest in the family. Dad is next. He and my mom will be there. Gabriel’s coming but won’t arrive until Friday; I forget the reason. Hannah and her husband, and Alfie will be there too.”
As luck would have it, Dean was sitting in the common room with a pint of frothy ale when Castiel entered. The room was smoky, making Castiel’s eyes water, and forcing a cough from his throat. He set his jaw and headed towards Dean’s table, pulling out a chair and sitting across from him.
“A wealthy man who thought his wealth gave him a right to do whatever he wished,” Dean surmised. He looked at Castiel thoughtfully. “Where is your friend now?”
Dean pulled up at Singer Salvage and got out of his truck, carefully avoiding the puddles. There had been rain that morning, too much for it to be easily absorbed, especially in the packed earth outside Bobby’s place. Cas got out more slowly, tilting his head to the side as he looked around. “This does not look like a safe environment for children,” he commented.
Never mind that the last three weddings he’s gone to, he hasn’t needed one. Two of them were too casual for suits, and the third? He was the best man at Sammy’s wedding, so he had a rented tux for that.
Cas opens the armoire too forcefully. The door bangs against the adjacent wall, making him cringe. “Sorry,” he apologizes.
“I believe that I do. I have been performing some research, looking at home plans online. I know at least the general outlines of what I would like, if not how to accomplish it.”
Dean feels very much like a fish out of water, but hell. No way he’s going to let that show. “Pleased to meet everyone,” he says, putting on his most charming smile and raising one hand in a half-hearted wave. “Those I haven’t already met, that is.”
Cas touched his nose, confused, then shook his head quickly to clear it. “Yes. Clean nose. Understood.” He reached out, then, touching Dean in the center of his chest. “Thank you. This is very important to me, and I appreciate what you are doing. Thank you.” He hesitated a moment, then leaned forward and placed a quick, chaste, kiss against the corner of Dean’s mouth, then turned and slipped out of the small room.
She turns back to Dean. “Now give me a kiss on the cheek, and sit down beside me. I want to talk to you over dinner, get to know you better, dear.”
“Bartholomew… we met when I was in my first year of college. That time was full of so many changes for me, so many freedoms. It was exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. I had never really been on my own before. I’d never really had friends; I’ve always been considered… unusual, in a way that adolescents do not treat kindly.”
“Come on, then.” Bobby led the way into the salvage yard, to the section where he kept the vehicles that were better repaired than scrapped for parts. There weren’t that many at any given time. Around Caroline people tended to drive their cars until they weren’t worth fixing even for someone like Bobby Singer, but there were exceptions.
Dean laughed. “Sure thing, kiddo.” He changed the album to play the Immigrant Song, laughing as Emma and Claire sang along, performing exaggerated moves.
“He worked for Richard Roman. He approached me with concerns that he had. We were never given the chance to delve into the specifics of his concerns, though it amounted to Roman being up to something nefarious. The book I brought to you for translation, Mr. Tran smuggled it out of Roman’s collection and delivered it to me.” Dean looked troubled and tinged with sorrow for the young man’s life.
Gabriel plopped down on the threadbare Persian rug, sitting cross-legged in front of Castiel, and pulling a lollipop out of his pocket. He unwrapped it carefully, then dramatically inserted it into his mouth. “Mm. Strawberry lemonade. I’ve got some more; you want one?”
“I am presuming guilt,” Dean admitted. “There isn’t enough evidence yet to pin anything in particular on him, yet my instincts scream at me he is responsible for many evils including and beyond the death of Mr. Tran.”
“What, you think I don’t know you guys well enough to know this is what you’d choose? Dorks.” She rolled her eyes affectionately.
“We really do appreciate your invitation,” Cas said. He swirled his brandy in the glass, then took a sip.
Dean could just see it, Cas with his endearing awkwardness, his sex hair and brilliant blue eyes, his sharp intelligence but socially inept ways, his insecurity. He dreaded where the story was going next, but hoped Cas would continue. He didn’t say anything, but simply held Cas’ gaze, silently communicating his attention.
“Sure. I’m Charlie Bradbury, and I’m in IT. Information Technology,” she clarified when she got a blank look from one of their other trainees. “I’m a programmer, though I can also deal with hardware problems fairly well. Personal trivia… hm. I love fantasy and RPGs. Role playing games. Online and live action, board games and computer games, you name it. I’m a geek girl and proud of it.”
Bela stepped further into his office, walking the short distance to his desk with a distinctive sway to her hips. “So, Dean…” Bela said, hiking one leg up as she sat on the corner of his desk. Her skirt had a slit in it that reached almost to her hip. It fell away, revealing the long length of her leg. She did have nice legs, he absently noticed. Not that the sight of them did anything for him, other than triggering a vague aesthetic appreciation. “Now that Naomi is retiring, have you given any thought to who you’ll hire for the open position?”
