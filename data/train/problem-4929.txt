"I'm taking you back to Malibu. Right now!" Pepper replied, coldly, pointing to make her point. Without another word, she moved to the closet and pulled out a suitcase.
"You think I'm falling for your trap?" she asked, playing angry. "Maybe, you're falling into my trap!" She stated as she spun her back on him. Her hair slightly slapped her face.
"Why must it be a she?" Toni protested. "Why can't you use a different pronoun? Why are you being sexist to shields? What did they ever do to you?"
Sam glanced at Toni before adding, "Fifty-eighth, Para-rescue. But now I'm working down at the VA." He cracked his hands before adding, "Sam Wilson."
"Sorry. Sometimes I don't know my own strength," he stated, letting go of her as if she was burning him. "Maybe, you should rest." He was looking at her as if she was going to break.
Steve stared silently for a few seconds before he narrowed his eyes at her. "No, you stop, Toni," he said, almost yelling. "There aren't many things I agree with Schmidt about, but there is one. You're a special, and there's no denying that. Don't ever try. I don't want to hear it." His tone wasn't cold, but it wasn't exactly warm. He sounded annoyed.
Steve gave them each a harsh look as he blocked their path to the time traveler. "Not all at once," he said in his cold Captain's voice. "Give her some space."
"Come on, Stark," the man said annoyed, his voice becoming clear. She was definitely sure now that she hadn't heard his voice before. She would've remembered his irritated voice. "We don't have time for this."
Tears started to fall from her eyes. "I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. The media will love it," she said, softly. "Barton will tease me endlessly." She paused yet again, fighting hard to keep going. "I gotta go." Three words pop into her mind, but she didn't say them. She just couldn't, as the only thing she could do was hung up the phone.
"Isn't that admitting it?" Howard asked, stepping toward with his eyes trained on her. "And who's Fury?"
With a sigh, Peggy turned slightly and stepped to the sleeping Howard, who was snoring softly. "I never realized he snored," she replied. "Might have to record this and tease him with it later."
Toni really wasn't afraid of her death as much as Pepper was, but Toni wasn't going to mention that to Pepper. She wasn't going to mention her guilt either, because that would make it worst. "Pepper."
"Who's he," she asked, as she felt the top of the blade. She would be out in a matter of seconds; she had to hurry.
She had to stop and catch her breath as she thought about his death. Though she didn't have that legendary connection that Rogers had with him, she had a connection, which she didn't approve of, with Barnes, and knowing that he would die stopped her in her track. She bent down with her hands on her knees as she tried to breathe. "I hate this," she muttered to herself.
"Geez," Toni joked. "You're such a tease. Does your mother know you act like this?" She walked toward Rogers' room to change. The hospital bag with all of her things was in there, so she could just put them all together.
If she wasn't crying and scared, she would have thought Rogers' determination was cute, but she didn't want to think about that. Toni shook her head as she took a deep breath, and she allowed her mind and thoughts to overtake her.
Tony's back hurts like a bitch, and he's starting to regret rejoining the Avengers, though he should stop trying to quit being Iron Man as it never sticks. Ever. He keeps saying that he's done, but he's always putting the stupid suit back on. He's too old for this shit. Too damn old for it all.
Dropping the broken tool on the ground, she pulled a smaller instrument; however, she broke that one too. "Seriously?" she muttered. She couldn't believe she was having this much trouble picking the damn lock. She took out a half-diamond pick and tried again. "Shit," she cursed as she was hearing footsteps. She look down at the feed and swore. Someone was coming her away. She needed to pick this now.
"Traitor," Tony barks as his eye brow raises. Breaking out of Rhodes' grip, he turns in his chair. "Wanda and Vision?" he asks, slowly. Those are the last two that he expects Jim to use as backdate. Really the last two. Is the President busy? Is the Pope—which is probably a good thing because the things he would say- busy?
Toni shook her head in a no fashion, because she hadn't gotten it pass it; however, she understood it. He was following someone that could've been a criminal. "Do you have any idea of who attacked me in the alley?" Though little by little she was getting over it, it still woke her in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat. She was beginning to believe that Peggy was noticing.
On the other side, Barnes leaned closer and placed his hand on Toni's knee and squeezed. His other arm rested behind her at the base of her neck, playing with her hair. "She needs to rest," he said, eyeing her. Her eyes were closed, feeling completely comfortable with the both of them.
Toni opened her eyes and looked up to him. Their eyes met, and he could see that this was anything but an insult. "I insulted you and was cruel beyond belief to you. In fact, I made it my goal to anger you, to frustrate you, just to see your temper. I want to bring you down to my level, but nothing. Sure, we yelled, and our fights are epic. Just ask everyone, but you never take it personal, always being the bigger person."
Toni let out a sigh as she face-palmed. "Romanoff, let him go. The legal hassle isn't worth it," she said. "I so don't want to deal with an angry Pepper. She'll pitch a fit if she heard we manhandled a reporter." Romanoff turned and gave her a look, but she didn't say anything. "Besides, this isn't as bad as the naked pictures of me that the media got once."
Toni blinked her eyes a few times, trying to keep herself awake. It was a battle that she knew she would lose again, and this time, she doubt she would have another dreamless sleep. "Hey, I think he looks good without hair. I do say he is dreamier without it."
I will also note that I added an Steve/Tony/Buck tag. I decided to do this because I don't want to leave Bucky broke hearted. Besides, I can see it happening. They all love each other. So this will end in a 3 way relationship.
Toni's legs still felt like Jell-O and hurt like hell, but she refused to let that show on her face. This man annoyed her, and she refused to let him see that. She also didn't like the use of Pepper's name, because only Happy, Rhodes, and she were allowed to use it. Why the hell did he think he could use her nickname? She should be 'Miss Potts' to him. Plus, it was her damn name on the building not Pepper or anyone else. She had a right to be here. "Geez, I feel like chopped liver. It's my name on the door, is it not? So why not discuss what you have to discuss?"
Fury narrowed his eyes. "I don't consider myself an expert in everything, though there're only a few things I don't know. Really only a few things," he replied, annoyed. "But there was no Toni Sark, who worked with the SSR."
The genius let out a howling chuckle, knowing exactly what he was thinking. People couldn't refuse this face…Well, unless you were Natasha, but according to Toni, it was because she had no soul. "Well," she said, still smiling. "I don't have anything besides the shirt—well, your shirt-on my back, so…" She wasn't sure how to say it or even what to say. She didn't like not having resources. Granted, it wouldn't be too hard to get her hand on some money. Her face was the only money that she needed.
"I don't know but it couldn't have been good." Bucky blew out in a large puff before standing. "It's late. Let's get some sleep."
He laughed. "I see. However, you should be focused on-" The Stalker couldn't finish his sentence as he was ripped off her and was thrown to the ground. Toni stumbled forward without anyone holding her.
As he stares at the hologram in front of him, he can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. When and why did the Brooklyn Twins decide he isn't good enough? Did he say something in his sleep? Did he mutter something that he shouldn't have said? Or did they just grow tired of him? Tony isn't sure, but he's tired and too exhausted to deal with his insecurities. He needs to rest and he knows it, but he can't.
Before anyone could respond, someone answered from the doorway. "He could be, but what would be his reasoning for that?"
Light flashed on startling Toni, but she didn't move. "Turn around, Toni," Barnes ordered. His voice was hard.
Feeling the cold draft, Toni shivered as she looked around the room. From her spot in front of the windows, the whole room was open to her, and she knew this was some kind of a lab. She noticed a few blue glowing equipment on lab tables across the room and wires leading everywhere. She wondered briefly if the Tesseract was present in this room as the blue glow was incredibly bright in one of them; however, she doubted that Skully would be that stupid to leave it in here with her, even if she was tied to a chair.
"You think highly of yourself," he said, stopping a few feet from her. He was looking at her with such disgust that it made Toni wonder how she was even alive.
Toni watched as he walked away and disappeared into the crowd. She took a look around, as she had no idea what was going on, and she didn't like it. Sure, she recognized some of these guys from camp, but that didn't mean she knew what was going on. They appeared to be stopped somewhere in the wilds, nowhere near camp.
"Well, I don't care for your man hands, but you know, we never get what we want," Toni said, trying to inch closer to the guns on the table.
"He only wishes to check on your status," the AI answers. "We have been researching the effects of prolonged separation."
After she regained her senses, she looked up to meet her attacker, who placed his hand firmly on her mouth to stop her from screaming or talking back. She could see the red mark on his face from her head butt, but it was his eyes that stopped her cold. He was staring deep into her eyes, looking for something, and she did her best to part up a front, though she didn't think it worked. His smirk cut her deep.
Peggy looked her over as she took a few steps toward her with the gun still trained on her. "Keep your hands where I can see them."
The word 'betrayal' echoed in Toni's head, pounding at the sides trying to get out. Steve and everyone else might have let it go, telling her that she had to forgive herself. She just didn't think she could do that, not with Barnes' ghost haunting her. She couldn't forgive herself for his death. "Just tell me what you want, and I'll do it," she pleaded, her voice cracking. Something in her shifted, and the idea that she could help Bucky lifted a weight off her shoulder… and if she dared say it, she felt almost relieved. She had to do it. "I'll do anything, Bucky. Anything."
With a heavy sigh, Toni closed her eyes, resting her head against the chest. "You're my home, Silly."
When the genius stopped running, the Captain found her at a base of the big, leafy tree on the edge of the mostly empty Cemetery. The parking lot, a few feet over, was separated from the green fields by a huge metal gate with one opening; her white Audi was parked near the opening, making for an easy escape for her. It was the only vehicle in the lot accept for two cemetery vehicles, a black SUV, and a lone motorcycle, which looked oddly familiar. Next to Toni stood her Iron Man suit, which landed with a light thud when it dropped from the sky, and it stood close only a yard way, acting like a body guard.
She thought to herself as she flashed back to the letter. She was doing the exact thing that her father told her not to do. She would be getting an ear full from him if he was here.
"What?" Steve asked shocked. How did he know that he was planning on seeing her? And why didn't Dugan want him to see her? "I was –"
His smile faded slightly. "Neither I nor Steve were going to leave you down there," he admitted. "Something could've happened to you."
Exhaling slowly, Toni, who was in the tent that she shared with Peggy, pushed herself up into a sitting position on the cot. She glanced at Peggy's cot, which vacant and neat. For as long as Toni knew Peggy, she was immaculate and never had a hair out of place, and it made sense that she would be that way now.
“The problem is that you don’t need to be out until odd hours of the night. You need to be professional and not disgrace our family with your teenage shenanigans.”
She laughs. “It’s been about two minutes. Our coach kept us late to go over some details for our competition tomorrow. Don’t worry.”
Steve takes his hands and gently pulls him back to the couch. His eyes are wet with tears as well. He whispers, “I can’t believe this is happening.”
The next day after school, Tony goes home with Steve to get a break from his suffocating family drama. They head into his room and begin to work on their respective projects. Tony has tons of homework, so he sits on Steve’s floor to work on reading for his American History class.
He could tell she wanted more information, but he couldn’t bring himself to open up about it yet. “Yes.”
“You’re welcome.” She narrows her eyes and stares Tony down. “So, what exactly is going on between you two?”
They find themselves standing in front of Steve’s beat-up olive-green Ford from the sixties in the school parking lot. “We’re here.”
“Oh. That’s funny.” He chuckles a little before moving to sit on the trunk of the car next to Tony. “Oh, we got a good spot.”
That Friday, the school is buzzing with excitement. Because the football team and cheerleading squad had been practicing in the summer as well, they are prepared for the season early. This means scrimmages and games starting right at the beginning of school. Not that Tony was complaining. He loved the football games and he wasn’t the one playing, so none of that mattered to him.
Tony has to resist the urge to outwardly sigh because he has known Pepper since they were toddlers and yet his father has never cared to learn anything about her. “Yes, sir.”
She places a hand on his arm comfortingly, before telling him, “Then you can pick through the other schools you applied to.”
“Makes sense.” His nonchalance fills Tony with relief and he lets a small smile work its way onto his face.
“Except that’s kind of the motto of the Stark family: ‘It doesn’t matter who you are, only what people think of you.’”
“Okay.” Steve pauses, before admitting. “I’m sorry I talked you into going the dance. I made you feel guilty for not wanting to share that we are dating. I thought it was because you were ashamed of me or something and you just didn’t want to ruin your image. I’ve always resented that a little. Now, I’m so, so sorry for feeling like that and guilting you about it. I know that you knew this would happen. So, I’m sorry.”
He heads downstairs to grab something to eat before heading to pick up Steve. He roots around in his cabinets before pulling out a bowl and some Lucky Charms. When pouring the milk, he splashes some onto his shirt and swears loudly before dabbing at it uselessly. He gives up after a few seconds and decides to start eating, not bothering to go sit down and instead continues to stand at the island.
Tony sits in his chair and poses, though he gets distracted halfway through and looks out the large window next to him, causing Steve to screech, “Hold still!”
Tony puts it on so that Steve can hear it. He starts with the B side, where all his favorites are, and is pleased to see that so far Steve is liking it.
All the breath leaves his lungs and a grin spreads across his whole face. He can’t believe that, not only are they staying together, but Steve wants him to meet his mom. “That sounds amazing. When?”
He stands up, getting ready to leave when his father says, “Have you given any more thought to working for the company?”
“I understand. Are your parents strict about girls?” Steve asks Tony as they walk upstairs to his room.
She is silent for a few seconds before finally sighing and telling him, “Tony Stark, you are an idiot.”
He leans in and kisses him. Steve seems a little surprised at first but kisses him back. He pulls away after a few seconds, though, looking mildly alarmed.
His speech goes on for two minutes exactly, but it feels like forever. At the end, everyone cheers, and he spots his aunt, mom, and dad in the crowd somewhere towards the back, with honest smiles. He grins before sitting down.
He stands up and walks up to the podium at the front. He lines up his notecards and addresses the audience with an award-winning smile and a cheerful, “Hi, everybody!”
“Don’t be. I’ll be off at college next year, so you won’t even have to worry about it.” He shrugs and avoids her eyes.
“Thank you.” He sits there patiently, and Tony is confused for a moment, causing Steve to prompt him, “Okay, time for you to hold up your end of the deal.”
“Kate, from the cheer squad.” He points to a small girl with medium length black hair in a black and white polka dotted dress talking to a few other girls he recognizes from the cheer team.
“Yeah, it was whatever. She isn’t the most outwardly friendly. Don’t get me wrong, she’s nice, and I love her, but small talk isn’t her thing.”
“Got lots of homework and if my grades fall, I’m toast. I’m already on thin ice after the other night.”
“Since Piper Miller in sixth grade, I know. I was there. But still, you don’t have to make this so weird.”
“Don’t get smart with me.” He snorts when his eyes fall on Tony’s yellow apron. “Where do you work?”
The other boy squints and mimics being blinded. “How is it that you spend all summer on the beach and still look pale?”
“Thanks. I’ve been trying to get that flip down forever now.” She explains as they climb into the car.
“I got home Friday night and told her everything. She wants to have you over for dinner. I just didn't really know how to talk to you about it.”
Steve laughs and a blush creeps up his face. When they walk into Tony’s room, Steve’s eyes widen. He looks around at the tidy room with multiple posters and a shelf full of books and records. Tony tosses his jacket on the bed and sits down.
Tony’s chest pangs and he wills himself not to frown. Instead, he jokes, “Do I look like a master chef to you?”
"No!" she screamed, as she turned slightly, reaching for the closest thing. Being on the bed, the closest thing was a pillow. Not caring what it was, she hurled it at Bucky as hard as she could. "Get out!" she wailed, screaming at the top of lungs. However, the pillow never hit it marked, drifting left, as it soared through the air, hitting an ugly gray lamp. The lamp went flying on impact, shattering as it hit the floor. It sounded like someone had smashed a window, as broken pieces of ceramic scattered everywhere. However, none of this mattered.
Losing tract of time, Toni just sat at his grave and stared, unable to push herself to leave. She didn't-couldn't leave him again, even if he was already gone.
"No…Yes." He took a deep breath. "You aren't the only one who overthinks. You aren't the only one who feels guilty, but I can Bucky's face, mad at me for being an idiot." A smile grew on his face.
"I have something to discuss with Rogers in private. You wouldn't want to wait here." He said, his smiling returning.
"If was a bomb, I wouldn't just have got a broken arm. And it wasn't like I did it on purpose," Toni stated.
she countered. Toni glanced down at her feet. She was still wearing her hospital soaks, which were an ugly color of gray.
The tags started to cut into her palm, and Toni was surprised that her hand wasn't bleeding yet. She glanced down at the tags before she spoke, "Yes."
He took a deep breath. "Maybe, Bucky would know." It would be useless to ask why she needed a homeless shelter again because she wasn't going to tell him why.
"I wouldn't say rundown," she replied. It had a homely feeling that she wished she had at her place. She took her deep breath as she continued her walk.
Tony gets up, but before he can take a step, he notices an Avenger on the steps eyeing him. Wanda Maximoff—God, that woman likes the color red- is perfectly still, and it's a scary sight to see her eyeing him. He isn't sure how long she has been standing there, though he feels uncomfortable at any amount of time. "How can I help you, Ms. Maximoff?" he asks with a hint of fake charm.
"You did make it clear that you wanted your device back," Phillips replied. "And I had you followed. Did you really think we wouldn't?" He looked down at the papers in front of him. "So tell me what this device does?" he asked as he stared down at a picture of it.
Rhodes gives him a look. "This is not a request, and if I have to get Wanda and Vision down here, I will. I think FRIDAY will agree with me on this. You need rest. You look like the walking dead."
He gave her a cold look before turning away, heading toward the quinnjet. "We don't have time for this. Let's just get back to Shield and hand in our report." His escape plan disappeared.
"Toni?" Howard asked, his anger disappearing. He had noticed her eyes widen at the sight of the water.
That almost broke Toni more as she couldn't stand to that look in anyone's eyes, especially in someone as young as Harley. Sure, she could see the start of a crush in his eyes, but she couldn't bear to break his innocence. He deserved to keep that as long as possible. Unable to do anything else, she got to her feet and took off. She needed some space or she was about to freak.
"Yes, Captain Rogers," the AI responded quickly. "How may I help you this morning?" The British robotic voice was calming to the Soldier for some odd reason that he couldn't understand. The AI was everything that Steve didn't understand in this time. He shouldn't be calming but he was.
"And I bet there's a lot," she stated, knowing her father was a lady's man. That was one of the reasons for her parents' fights. Her mother had thought her father was having an affair and had even accused Peggy of sleeping with him. Now, Toni didn't know if her father had cheated and she didn't want to know, but she wouldn't have put it pass him.
," he said, stressing her last name as if he didn't believe it was her given name. "And I think family is the correct word for us."
Peggy kept the gun trained on Toni, but one of her hands dropped to her pocket and pulled out a pair of handcuffs. "You can explain it to Colonel Phillips." She took a few steps toward Toni. "Hold out your arms. I'm placing you under arrest."
After few long minutes of Toni trying to get the Howling Commandos and Trip to leave, they finally left, and for a while, she just watched as they walked away. She was annoyed at their slow pace, but she knew there was nothing that she could do and she was angry for nothing. Dugan and Jones were allowed to be slow in their old age, but it was painful to watch how slow they were, when she could remember them so young.
The AI responded a second later. "As you wish, Miss. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."
He was awfully confident – it was like he hadn't just been saying she would think him crazy if he was wrong. Something must have given her away the moment he'd mentioned family.
After stopping at a store to pick up a few items for genius (Something that Steve took great joy in paying for), the couple found themselves at a small out of the way diner. Steve hadn't said much after leaving the apartment. Try as she might, Toni could only get a few words out of her boyfriend, who had been silence even with her jests. "Steve," she said, as they sat down at a table in the corner. "Talk to me."
"Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer, a lot of people are gonna die-" Steve started, but Toni was no longer paying attention. If he didn't want to talk to her, then there was no point in her listening to his speech. She was sick of his self-sacrificing way, and she couldn't deal with it anymore. If he wanted to be stupid, then so be it, but why did he have to be like this? Why did he always do this? Was it because he thought he was prefect? Did it all go back to that? Was it something else?
Looking back on this moment, Toni would blame the pain—not the panic attack which she would deny—that made her jump. "Shit," she uttered, loudly, as she turned to the SHIELD agent. She wasn't sure what she was expecting as she looked at him, but he was out. However, judging by the sounds he was making, it wouldn't be long before he came to. If he came to before she was out of the car, she was screwed.
"Just a difference of the opinion, something I don't think we can get over," he said, interrupting her. "But that is not the point. Let me take you somewhere. I want you to see something."
As she allowed him to deepen the kiss, her mind wandered to Barnes and stayed on him. It wasn't by choice, but there was something in the back of her head that wouldn't allow her to forget him. Something was wrong. He told her after their kiss that he would come back
Even though she couldn't see his face, Pepper could tell this man was quite the looker. "I wouldn't say that much," she said, loudly. "But close enough." As her voice echoed across the room, the whole room turn to her, besides the elderly man with a cane. He was still smiling as he looked at her.
Toni took a deep breath as to gather her strength; however, his dress uniform wasn't helping. He looked so much better in this than he did in the USA flag. Don't get Toni wrong. She was patriotic, but she would not go running around wearing a flag. "Why are you so mad at me?" she asked.
Salty glanced at her. "Probably for a good reason. Just look at you. You would blow up the whole camp."
Tony groans loudly. "No, I don't want them in here," he says quickly. He can see the gears turning in her head as she stares at him. He can see her expression change as if she is hit with a realization, and he knows it isn't good.
, Steve thought, fondly. He bent down and looked at her. "Yes, I am aware," he said, loving the fact she was wearing them and had no interest taking them off. "But it's good that you admit it though." There was a wink in his eyes as he teased her.
"I'm not your daughter and I'm not from the future," Toni denied. She knew he wouldn't believe her, but she would try. She didn't want to talk about their relationship. Plus, he couldn't learn anything from the future. "Do you even know how insane you sound? I. Am not. From. The future."
She leans back slightly as her eyes travel the entire length of his body, but they focus on the expression on his face after a once over. "What's wrong? What did they do?" her voice turns cold, bitter.
Toni's eyes dropped to his hand on her knees. He heart was pounding in her ears, wanting nothing more than to jump into her father's arms. But how was this possible? How was any of this possible? "Are you really here?" she asked, her voice shaking. "Please."
"I think she's growing on you," Salty countered. "I also think you're going on her, which I thought I would never see."
Toni let out a sigh as she glanced toward the doorway to see her father and Peggy. For losing Rogers, Peggy looked like she was functioning well unlike Howard, who looked like a mess from his hair to his clothes. It reminded her of the long nights that her father would spend in the labs after her mother's death. It was disheartening to see him like that. "I think you need more beauty sleep, Stark," Toni replied.
"Peachy." She replied as she stepped toward the door and glanced at Peggy, who had fallen to her knees. It was a truly sadness sight to see Peggy crying on the floor and Toni had no idea of what to do. She was never good at comforting someone in pain. Should she leave Peggy alone? Should she go to her? What should she say?
"Yea, Tony," Steve says as he steps forward trapping Tony between him and Barnes. "It was a mistake before, and it'll never happen again. Sure, you don't have the history that we have, but who cares? You're our future, and we'll never leave you hanging, alone. You're just as important to me as Bucky is."
Toni didn't reply, still feeling slightly ill. She wasn't quite sure of why; maybe it was her reactor, which worried her. She hadn't had the chance to check yet, not that she could do much without a lab. Her only hope was that Bruce was there to check it for her. She wasn't in the right mindset to check it herself, and besides, she wanted to get wasted as quickly as possible. She couldn't check her reactor and drink at the same time.
"I got this," she stared, glaring at his helping hand. She was struggling with him, not sure of who this person was.
She almost fell out of bed, dodging Salty's hand, but she kept pulling at the IVs as she had to get out of here. However, she wasn't fast enough for Phillips, who raced to the other side of the bed. "Leave me alone."
Steve's smile was huge as he stared down at her. Sure, this wasn't going to be easy, and this wasn't going to be a fast fix, but as he looked down, he knew it was all worth it. Toni Stark, even if she didn't believe it, was worth it, and he would fight an army to be with her. It would be worth it to see her smile, to know that she was happy. It would be worth it to hold her in his arms. "You." Even with the dark mark on her face, she was beautiful.
Zola crossed to the table and stared at the Arc Reactor. "I do not want to see a woman tortured like this. Please tell us what we want to know." There was some hesitation in his voice.
Fury didn't feel guilty about that. Sure, he wanted nothing to become of their world, but he wasn't going to let anything happen to theirs. "Yes."
For the next few minutes, Steve remained beside her until she was quiet. Bucky was the first one to leave, as this was not his area and he felt uncomfortable. After leaving her side, Steve lingered in the doorway watching her. He wanted to make sure she was okay, before he left her. After a few silent minutes, Steve exited the room even if he was still worried.
Maya took a step forward, closing the distance between them. She was almost touching Toni, while the expression on her face changed slightly. "You still hadn't forgotten about that, have you?"
Toni glanced around to see if anyone was looking at her, but no one was paying attention to her. They walked past her without a second glance. Taking this as a sign, she walked to the doors with a look in her eyes that said she knew what she was doing. When she reached the door, she took a deep breath. She was about to open the door, when she heard footsteps behind. She was going to ignore them, but the woman's voice stopped her.
Steve only glanced at the monitor for a second before he glanced back Thor. He really had no interest in listening to Loki, as he knew that would help no one. Loki would love to get into their heads and fuck them up. Steve wished that they would just locked him up and throw away the key.
He stepped out of the bed and headed toward the kitchen to find something to eat. If he couldn't sleep, he might as well eat to keep up his strength. Though he couldn't really cook anything besides eggs, he had to admit that the kitchen in the tower was impressive and it made him want to cook as he had never seen anything like it before.
Phillips laughed. "I see you don't like him, but you're not the only one." He paused. "Is there a reason why?"
Maya was seconds from death, but she didn't stop fighting, not that Toni blamed her. Death was one of Toni's greatest fears, and no matter how often she faced it- and she faced it a lot-, Toni could never truly face it, face lack of control, the unknown. Even now, Toni was tired, overheated, and in pain, and her possible death was screaming at her at the highest volumes. She could feel her worry and concern yelling at the back of her mind. She could feel it build up inside of her, though it could be a panic attack that she refused to acknowledge.
It had started to be an obsession to him, always keeping the photo close and safe. He took it everywhere with him, even if he still had no idea of who the woman was. Even after the chair and pain, he refused to let go of it. Refused to let her go. He wasn't sure what that
The expression on Bucky's face drops and he looks like he's physical pain. For a few long seconds, the former assassin is silent as he breaths in ever slowly. It's like he's about to do something painful. "I had…a nightmare…"
He smiled as he remembered Romanoff's reaction; she gave Toni a look of irritation that no one could keep a straight face through while saying, "Stark, why in the hell do you think I want to see that." However, Romanoff couldn't keep a straight face either as Toni gave her Toni's famous puppy dog face, which made her break out in laugher. When Toni showed Barton, he couldn't keep a smile off his face (which Steve didn't like at all) and kept turning it to look at it in different angles. It made Steve want to slug that smile right off his face, but that wouldn't be good. Toni wouldn't have approved and it would've earned an ear full from her. Banner, on the other hand, just shook his head at the picture and sighed as he eyed the brunette's big smile.
Toni let out a sigh as she turned to her boyfriend, who was neck dip into the wrapping paper. At first, it was cute/ adorable to watch Steve try to save it for next year, but now, it was annoying. Yes, Steve had come a long way from the 1940's man frozen in time, who had habits that should've died in the snow; however, somethings died hard, and this was one of them. "Steve," she called out, staring at him as he attempted to fold the wrapping paper. "What are you doing?"
“I forgot; Pepper is going to be cheerleading.” Clint rolls his eyes and makes a kissy face at him, causing Tony to give him a small shove. Their conversation was cut off by the warning bell before Tony could retort.
They walk outside and climb into his convertible. As he pulls out and the wind blows faster, Pepper attempts to flatten her hair to no avail.
Steve smiles at him and Tony guesses that was Steve’s way of attempting to calm his anxiety about the situation. While it comforts him a little, he definitely can still feel his legs shaking beneath him. He takes a deep breath and decides to just go talk to his family.
Steve runs his hands along Tony’s scar, smudging ink along his skin from where it had rubbed off onto Steve’s hand while he was drawing.
“Yes, sir.” He shakes their hands and puts on his best winning smile. “It is very nice to meet you both.”
“He wants me to take over the company. He is pressuring me into that career path so much, Steve, and I don’t know what to do.” The more he talks, the more emotional he feels, and so by the end, he is practically yelling when he says, “What do I do? I don’t want to do that; I don’t want to run his fucking company!”
“Don’t worry about it. Does it make me look like an artist, all covered in ink?” He jokes, wiggling his eyebrows.
He knows he shouldn’t blame Steve for his situation, and he doesn’t, but he is more than a little bitter about the prospect of having to spend time working with his dad for the company. Especially because that company is at the root of many of his personal and familial issues. He just doesn’t have the energy to pretend like everything is good though, so he brushes off Steve.
“Thanks! Did you see that catch? I was all like” – he mimics jumping and catching the ball – “and the one of the defensive lineman was like” – he growls and mimes a charging bull – “you know?”
Tony’s face lights up and he immediately directs all his attention to his boyfriend. “Ooh! Draw me!”
“I can’t accept this.” Howard lets go of him and Tony stumbles a few steps back, pulling at his shirt.
“These are new shoes!” She protests but moves them anyway and just like that, the tense air evaporates. “Do we have any classes together? I skipped all the APs and I know you didn’t, but maybe English or an elective?”
They are saved from their awkward silence by the football coach calling, “Barton! Locker room, now!”
Tony wanders into the cafeteria the next day surrounded by his friends. He can’t help but smile when he sees Steve sitting at a table by himself towards the middle of the room.
“Ah, Tony Stark. I was just talking to your father a couple days ago.” He peers around them and picks up the stash, much to the boys’ dismay. “What do you boys have here?”
That night, he finds himself going to Peggy’s diner. He is nostalgic and hungry, so he figures that would kill two birds with one stone. When he gets in, the diner is practically empty, not a surprise, except for a college aged kid working the register and a familiar blond sitting at a booth. Despite all the empty chairs, he decides to slide in across from him.
They break away and she checks her watch. “Well, I have to leave for my shift. Please, come back soon.”
They chatter about the new school year and activities until they pull into the school’s parking lot. He checks the time to see that it is only 8:20. Him and Pepper sit there for a few seconds in silence, trying to mentally prepare themselves for the day ahead. Tony finally sighs and turns off the car. The second they step out of the car, Pepper’s friends from cheerleading call her over.
“I could say the same to you.” She tells him with a knowing smile. “I made a lasagna; I hope that’s okay.”
When he gets there, Steve opens the door. When he sees Steve’s concerned look, he bursts into tears right there.
Tony falters and takes a step back. Howard doesn’t look the slightest bit remorseful and instead looks at Tony with raised eyebrows as if he is expecting an answer. Tony doesn’t dignify him with a response and instead turns on his heel and heads up the stairs to his room.
“Nah, they just put on a show like that in front of other people to make it seem like they have good parenting skills. But jokes on them, they don’t need to worry about me having girls in my room.”
Pepper cuts in, “So, I’m having a party Friday night because end of the cheer season and all that. You two should come.”
“No, it’s fine. It’s not like I have anything to do at home.” He shrugs before turning away to avoid her knowing look.
He goes about his day in a tired daze and barely participates. His teachers give him a questioning glance and some space because they know that if he isn’t constantly talking during class, it must be a bad day. He is both relieved and frustrated because he doesn’t want people seeing him like this.
“That sounds great.” Steve gives him a cheesy grin and Tony figures this would be worth the paranoia associated with bringing him to his house.
“Wow, you have an extensive record collection.” He says in awe as he runs his hands along the sleeves.
“I disagree.” Steve stares at him so intently Tony thinks he can see straight into his soul. “I think you finally deserve something good.”
His work the next night could not have been duller. The novelty of having his first job wore off quickly, so he is left wandering around an empty diner in the middle of the night, mindlessly wiping down tables and cleaning glasses, while Peggy finishes her paperwork in the back. This is her last day working at the same time as him because he now knows how to do everything, so his boredom will only get worse. He supposes it is better than nothing, though. For now, he just has to act like he wouldn’t rather be anywhere else.
As if on cue, the door opens to reveal Pepper’s dad, Eric Potts. He looks at the situation before him with his daughter doing her makeup and a teenage boy on her bed, failing to hide the alcohol in his hands. His expression scrunches up and he sighs loudly.
They stand in tense silence for a good thirty seconds before Steve addresses the elephant in the room. “Listen, about the other night-”
“Hi! Are you ready to start? You look tired already, and you haven’t even started. Are you sure you don’t want different hours?”
Tony does, in fact, remember that. And as much as he wants to get mad and defensive, he knows Steve is right. “You’re right.”
“Well, I’m not happy about any of it, so we’re even.” He snaps, before storming past them and heading to his room.
When they get to school, Tony feels like a two-ton weight has been dropped on him. He is not mentally prepared to handle school today. Between the stress of finding a job, his dad, and having to hide it all from his friends, he would have been perfectly content to wrap himself up in a blanket at home and never set foot outside. And it’s only the second week. Unfortunately, he needs to be at school. If he flunks out of high school, he can’t get into college, which is his number one priority.
“Yeah, it’s been cool so far. Do you want something to drink?” He asks, heading over to the kitchen.
Tony follows Clint to his car as they chat about the game and their plans for tonight. When they get to Clint’s car, Thor is already there waiting for them, leaning against Clint’s car. Clint gestures them over to his trunk and pops it, where his duffle bag with football stuff is.
“Alright. Well, just let me know.” She tells him before softly singing along to “Bennie and the Jets” by Elton John.
They part and Steve turns and unlocks the door. When they walk in, they are met by a woman in her early fifties, with blonde hair that is peppered with grey. She immediately gives them the biggest smile when she sees them. She pulls Steve into a hug and he returns it, before she turns and gives Tony a hug as well. He is floored for a moment before hugging her back.
He accepts the money and deposits it in the register before spinning around to make the drink. He freezes for a moment because he doesn’t know how to make a latte, but luckily his aunt is there to help him with the steps. He is done with it in about two minutes, which may have irritated the man, but it was good timing for the teenager.
Fury can barely control his homeroom class enough to go over the announcements because no one could stop talking. Thor was currently going over the cheerleading roster to try and find himself a girlfriend before the game. His phone buzzes in his pocket every three seconds as Clint asks him a multitude of questions about whether he was coming to the game, what time was he getting there, asking him if he wanted to hang out with the team afterwards, and more along those lines. Pepper, who is already one of the most energetic and cheerful people Tony knows, was practically shaking when  she got in the car this morning.
Tony has to resist the urge to nervously mess with his shirt. “I gave Pepper Potts a ride home from cheerleading practice.”
Clint rolls his eyes. “Come on. It’s not like a three-dollar sandwich puts a dent in your massive bank account.”
“Yeah.” He checks his watch, stands, and brushes the crumbs off of his pants. Tony frowns a little, so Steve clarifies, “I should go. My mom’s a nurse and gets home from work around now and I don’t want her to notice I’m gone.”
Bruce let out a sigh, because there was no denying that Toni was a child at times. "Maybe, but we should give her time."
Rogers blinked, trying to focus his thoughts, and turned completely to Barnes. "Yes." He paused "What about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?"
"I love you, Punk," he says, a bit calmer. "It's you and Steve. I need you both. You both keep me sane, and I didn't realize how much at first. When you b-broke up with us, my world, my everything came crashing down," he utters. "I lost it. Completely lost it, and I all but punched Steve when you walked out."
Steve paused, glancing back to the window before looking at the door. He hesitated for a second, fighting with himself. He knew it would be logical and quicker to wait, but he hated doing nothing. It was like he was back on the sidelines, and he hated that. Hated it.
Steve glanced at Toni, smiling once more. "It takes some getting used to, but I had help." His smile could light up the night—anyone who disagreed with that get an Iron Man kick to the knees. "And it's good to meet you, Sam."
Toni took a deep breath. "Why do you think someone's bothering me?" She didn't think she was that freaken readable, which also irritated her. That was the last thing she wanted. She fought the urge to look around, as she was felt eyes on her again. Maybe, she was just imagining it.
It felt like she was having a heart attack, as her mind wouldn't work and her heart was skipping a beat. She pulled the jacket around her, barely recalling Spector pulling it around her shoulder. How was this happening? How did he know what was going to happen? "What?"
"I don't blame you for this?" She said, softly, as she waved her bruised wrist at him. With a light brown leather jacket, the wrist was hidden from prying eyes.
Her eye twitched, because it was his fault. That stalker was his, though she had no idea of how he was able to do anything in this time as her hand went right through him. However, it seemed like he could touch some things as he was touching that tool. "Why don't you tell me what this deal is first," she said, still struggling in the chair.
He knew this was probably why Rumlow was angry. He couldn't be an effective weapon for Hydra when he was like this, and he understood why. He couldn't have weakness. He understood that his punishment would be harsh for following her, but he couldn't help it, and he would not regret his actions. He got to see her face, to see her emotions for the first time. He got to see something other than hatred when he looked into her eyes, and it was addicting.
However, she absolutely had no filter at the moment, ready to attack anyone who even looked in her direction, and she blamed it on Pepper and her vacation….okay, it wasn't Pepper's fault, but she was moody and she could and would blame whoever she liked. The genius had it up to here with stupid, as it seemed like all she did was babysit people, who didn't know what they were doing. Seriously, baby sit. Toni had forgot how stupid people were, forgot that a CEO was highly paid Babysitter. Was this how Pepper felt? Toni hoped not. God, she hoped not.
Sam Wilson peaked his head in and with a soft smile, he spoke, "I made breakfast. If you guys eat that sort of thing."
Toni had felt that something was off with Sassy, but now, she knew something was off. Carter wasn't like this. She didn't talk like this to Toni. "I would've punched them all in the face." She flexed her arm.
"Does Phillips knows about this?" Peggy asked. She also had a concerned look in her eyes. "Maybe, you should speak to someone."
She stared at him in disbelief. Did he just say it was okay to feel something? This man didn't believe in sharing emotions. He didn't believe in emotions at all, thinking of them as a weakness. "No, it's not," she argued, resisting the urge to snap back with some snarky comment.
Toni popped the stress ball up again, but as her mind wandered, she put too much force in it, and it flew over her head. Not thinking about the outcome, she threw herself back in her chair as she tried to catch the stress ball high in the air. Her eyes never left the ball, as she chased after the ball, which went flying over her head. In her mind, she saw herself catching the ball with little trouble, but that wasn't what happened. Instead of gracefully, the office chair went flying out from underneath her, and in her surprise, she landed on her face as she was unable to stop herself. With her mind focused on the ball, she paid no attention to her angle or path, and she smacked the floor hard before she realized that was happening. If face planting was bad enough, the chair landed on her
… Fond of? Cherishes? Likes? Tony isn't sure, but he won't call it love. That's impossible. Tony Stark does
Rogers stood up and walked to her. "I got this too," he stated as he took the pan from her and put the ice pack down.
Barnes was a good few feet in front of her and for some reason, she had trouble closing the distance between them. It was like her body didn't want to move and she tired too easily. What was wrong with her? Did something happen to her and she not know it? "Bucky!" she yelled, running into the house. "B-"
He leaned closer to her as he sat on the edge of his seat. "You're awake. I never thought I would see your beautiful eyes again." His hand left Toni's upper arm and traveled to her face where he cupped her face. "So glad." His thumb started to spiral again, gently rubbing her cheek.
Shaking her head, she made her way back to her tent. They were on the move again with the SSR targeting Schmidt's hydra bases. Right now, Steve was out with the Howling Commandos taking down base number two, and it was the second time that she found herself going crazy. She wasn't sure why she was worried or why she was so invested. This was the past and what was going to happen would happen. There was no changing that. People were going to die and there was nothing that she could do to change it. It was useless to worry.
After school, the hype reaches its peak. The stands thunder as everyone from their high school, the opposing high school, and various people from the area clamber on to get the best seats. His ears are practically bleeding with how loud everyone around him is screaming when the kickoff happens, but he still has the biggest grin on his face.
She rolls her eyes and gives him a light laugh. “Oh, all right! Can you come a few hours earlier so I can be there to train you?”
Tony takes a deep breath and tells Steve, “He said I either have to break up with you or he won’t pay for MIT.”
He rips open the envelope and scans the page, his eyes quickly scanning every word on the page. He can hardly believe what he’s seeing.
“I’m trying to be nice and get to know you by asking you personal questions. For example, what is your favorite color?”
At work that night, Steve doesn’t come back either. Tony isn’t surprised. After the day he’s had, he’s honestly a little glad. He’s too tired to sort out all of his feelings. Despite the fact that he’s used to staying up late to work on papers or projects, it’s nothing like his frequent late nights here at the diner. He has fallen asleep more times than he can count in the last month. He doesn’t think he’ll be able to process his emotions or complete a coherent sentence if Steve were to show up.
Steve looks at Tony laying across the counter, practically asleep. He hesitantly asks, “Can I get some coffee?”
The next day at school, things were weird. Steve and Tony eat together at lunch, which is weird, but not new. They aren’t overly affectionate for obvious reasons, although neither of them are fans of public displays of affectionate anyway. Steve goes to the diner every night still. It is similar to when they were friends, just with kissing and actual feelings. It’s weird for Tony. But good.
“Enough to make me not nervous, but I also feel confident in my decision-making abilities.” Tony says, though he isn’t sure how true that is because he definitely is regretting talking. Plus, his head is getting a little swimmy.
“That’s good!” She smiles at him, and it makes him feel just a bit better. At least one person believes in him.
After a couple minutes, he is ripped out of his spiral by the phone ringing. He picks it up and winces when his voice comes out as more of a croak, “hello?”
“Try asking your aunt, she might need someone to come work at her diner.” She gives him a small smile before she follows her husband into his office.
There we have it! The last chapter of this story. I've really loved writing this, so I hope you guys enjoyed reading this as well. Also, let me know if you would want any one-shots from this universe. Comment and let me know your thoughts!! :)
“Speaking of which, Starwars is showing at the drive-in movie by school Saturday night. We should go.”
“Hold on, your collar is a little crooked.” Tony hurriedly reaches up to fix it, but Steve quickly stops him. “No, you just made it worse. Here let me help you.”
“I’m going to college!” He yells with her, whooping and screaming enough to alert the whole neighborhood.
“Your welcome.” She tells him back in the same aggressive tone, though there is a small smile on her face.
He hears the front door open and mentally crosses his fingers that it isn’t his dad. For once in his life, luck seems to be on his side because moments later his mother enters the kitchen.
This catches the boys attention. He looks up at Tony and his eyes widen in recognition. Tony wishes he hadn’t said anything.
Howard closes his eyes in frustration and seems to have an internal battle before relenting. “Fine. But that doesn’t mean I’m happy about it.”
“Alright. Since it is a minor incidence, I will let you off. You will need to pay the fine, however, and this will go through your parents because you are a minor.”
To say that things are weird between Steve and Tony would be an understatement. Steve hasn’t been to the diner in days. While they usually talk frequently, they haven’t spoken since the party. Tony hasn’t even really seen him since then, other than a few glimpses in a crowd of other students. Steve is clearly avoiding him, and Tony can’t blame him.
“No, I just thought it would be nice for us to have a family dinner because we hardly ever do.” His mother tells him as she scoops him some food for his plate.
The next day at school, they announce the next school dance. The winter formal is another big staple at Hayes High, along with every other stereotypical high school activity, so the whole school is buzzing with excitement. There have already been five big asks with posters and flowers, and at least a dozen other more subdued date arrangements. While Tony usually likes to see everyone get excited about school things, this is just getting gross.
“Don’t try to trick me, Tony. I’m not an idiot. All you want is to go to college. Would you honestly give that up?” Howard teases cruelly.
“Yes! I converted him to a sci-fi lover!” Tony threw his arms up and yelled, catching the attention of everyone around them.
His day goes much of the same. They already start to take notes in his advanced chemistry class, much to everyone’s dismay. He barely gets to see any of his friends, due to their less challenging schedules. At the end of the day, he finds himself on the bleachers working on his homework while Pepper has her practice. She catches his eye a couple times and gives him a small smile.
When he gets there, they have to rush through the school towards the classroom where their gowns are held. On the way, however, he bumps into his parents.
Though, he has known her forever and if he can’t trust Pepper, then he can’t trust anybody. He decides to dial her phone number on impulse. She picks up on the third ring.
“I’m taking it.” He doesn’t respond to her questioning look and instead sits in the hallway and starts his homework.
“Uh… I’m good, thanks.” He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, before returning to his usual seat.
Tony laughs, before giving the other boy a high five. “Yeah, those college scouts are gonna be all over you this year.”
They work in a rhythm, cleaning all the dishes. Despite the fact that Tony hates chores and has never really had to do them, he finds himself enjoying his time with the Rodgers’.
“I was planning on going with Pepper, but she didn’t really want to go anyway so she’ll be glad to be let off the hook.”
“Well, you didn’t seem interested in talking to me at all, as weird as that sounds. I’m surrounded by people all the time who talk to me for selfish reasons, and I saw that day as an opportunity to get to know someone real. God, that was cheesy. I’m sorry. Also, I’m aware of how privileged I sound. ‘Poor little rich boy has too many friends.’” He scowls into his drink.
Steve is interrupted by Pepper coming outside and Tony is both frustrated that he doesn’t know what Steve thinks and relived because a part of him doesn’t want to know. “Hey there you are! I was looking for you guys inside. What’s going on?”
The next day, Tony found himself looking forward to seeing Steve. He passes him in the hallway once and they smiled at each other and Tony feels giddy at the idea of getting to sit next to him at lunch. He doesn’t know why though because yeah, he wants a new friend, but to get this excited? That has to be a little weird.
“Hey, do you want to hang out after school?” Tony jumps as Clint starts talking to him, having almost fallen asleep at their lunch table from staying up late getting ahead on his homework, due to him having substantially less time to do it the rest of the week.
Tony sighs and slumps on the porch. As he sits there, he thinks of what to do. He should go to Steve’s. He should go and explain what happened to him and hope they can figure something out. He puts that as his last option though, because he isn’t ready to go there and possibly end things. He subconsciously massages his bruised arm as he thinks of other people. He could go to his aunt’s, but he isn’t sure what he would even do there other than sit with his thoughts and he didn’t feel like explaining the situation to her. Plus, his parents would call there, and he doesn’t want to see them. He thinks of Clint but knows that definitely isn’t an option. They aren’t close friends in that aspect, he definitely doesn’t want to explain his situation. Ultimately, he decides to rip of the band-aid and head to Steve’s.
“I’ve got to go now. Enjoy the game you two.” She gives them a genuine smile, before jogging to the sidelines where the other cheerleaders are waiting.
“But I mean, we haven’t tipped off anybody yet. We don’t even look like a couple. We’ll just be two single dudes who hang out together because they don’t have dates.” Steve pushes with a large grin on his face.
The next night, he spends his first free night in what feels like years taking Steve on a date. They decide to go roller skating at a rink about thirty minutes away from their school. Steve is surprisingly good at it and can glide with relative ease. Tony, on the other hand, falls over every five minutes. His hands are scraped up and he has bruises all along his legs, but he has a large smile on his face and Steve is laughing at him and that’s all that matters.
“Anthony!” Howard places his fingers on the bridge of his nose in an attempt to prevent what appeared to be a coming headache. “What could be any better than taking over my company?”
“Tony. You know I love you too, but this is insane. We’ve been dating for almost six months and you have been planning for this since you were eleven. It’s your dream. And if you don’t, you’ll have to take over Stark Industries.”
“I’ll meet you by the stage.” Pepper calls, disappearing into the crowd, as Tony pulls away from the hug.
“He’s doing great, Howard. He’ll be perfect for the company.” William tells his father, enthusiastically shaking his hand.
Today is graduation. Their senior year is officially over. They are soon to be college students, which is just as scary as it sounds. Him and all of his friends are splitting up to go all over the country and he probably won’t see most of them ever again. He tries not to think about it.
“We’ve been dating for a month and you keep saying that, so at this point I don’t believe you.” He scowls.
“For sure!” He didn’t have to fake enthusiasm about this, as Hayes High football games were legendary.
