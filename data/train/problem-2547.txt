“You picked the flowers, John.”
“Okay then” Greg said, trying, once again, to wrap his mind around the man that was Sherlock Holmes.  “Anyway, you wanna tell me why your wallet was in the flat of a man that killed two prostitutes last month?”
“Yeah, I know what a wedding is and it’s called a honeymoon, not a bloody...nevermind, I just never took you to the as the type to attend one. A wedding that is.”
“Yes?” Sherlock replied, still apparently confused at Greg’s amusement.
Sherlock made it clear, to everyone.  His personal life was no one else’s business and Greg was prepared to offer him that privacy.
“I’ll be unavailable for the next two weeks.  Don’t bother me” Sherlock said, in that bored yet demanding way that he has and then strode away.
I sent him one back of a hedgehog and I haven't heard from him since.
Both men had a slight limp to their gait and neither found it comfortable to sit for long periods of time, nor on hard surfaces at all.
The top three runners were coconut & lime, chocolate and rhubarb & rose petal.
That was it.  Halloween was sorted.  Mycroft would have to spy on the American ambassador on his own.
The man, John, just chuckled as Sherlock strode away and turned back to Greg, Holding out his good hand.
The quarantine is over...or is it?
“Ah, Mycroft” Sherlock said, rather amiably considering not only their usual relationship, but also his current position. “Enjoying an evening stroll.  This isn’t your usual neighbourhood, is it?” And there was the usual childish bantering.
“What do you mean, this is our bloody wedding” John shouted.  Seriously, why he had dragged Sherlock away from their guests when he was only going to be loud enough for them to hear was beyond Sherlock.  What was even more puzzling was why he was confused as to why they were there.
And then he laid back down and went back to sleep.
Sherlock could tell the exact moment that it all dawned on John that he had, in fact, helped organise this wedding.
“Yeah” John replied cheerily, not looking up from his book.  “Karren, the woman I met at the bookstore” at this he nudged his current book up a bit and Sherlock decided he didn’t like where this was going.  Clearly, anyone called
“Ignore the order, false alarm” he said into the phone somewhat weakly and hung up, as he slammed the lid of his laptop shut.
“Again, I think I would have remembered.”
“Substandard product.  Are you here about the body?” the man asked, ripping Gregs attention away from the man’s lack of hygiene.
“More” Watson called out excitedly and Sherlock pulled a salmon atrocity out of the wardrobe and threw it over her blonde curls.  The child squealed with laughter and proceeded to try and pull it off again.
It wasn’t right to be thinking that. His friend had been verging on the edge of Hypothermia, shivering, yet still looking extremely annoyed. That, and Johns wife had been dead for less than a year.
Looking like a teenager who had been told to clean their room, Donovan stomped away.
Just then the far corner lit up, catching Gregs attention, and he turned to see the light from Sherlock’s phone light up the mans face.  Sherlock looked happy, like really, truly happy.
to ask him how to keep Mrs Hudson safe from heatstroke.  He actually sent me that laughing emoji, with tears of mirth.
“...rules made up in your own head!”
Greg had been right.  Meeting Mycroft Holmes was a slightly terrifying experience.
“And you…” Greg indicated back towards the house where Sherlock was.
Oh, god!  This is worse than the time I had to decide whether to tell Molly her current boyfriend does in fact detest cats.  I still haven't decided if I should tell her.  I think I should, but the John in my head tells me to let her find out herself.  I mean, I could set him up so he is arrested so she will just dump him and I won't have to say or not say a word to her but Molly is already skittish about potential partners being criminal masterminds, so that probably isn't a good idea at all.  God damn Moriarty, making my life difficult, even now!
. Your relationship is obviously, you know,
It's a picture of the door to 221, but there, spray painted in bright red, are a series of numbers and symbols that takes John a few minutes to decipher.
"Sherlock? Oi? You hear me?"
"Then go back."
"They are." John says sombrely.
Sherlock had managed to clear the shelf in record time through a decisive combination of kicking at the debris and swearing loudly before squeezing himself through the gap as soon as he could.
“The wound,” Sherlock says in a strangled voice, “will never heal.”
on crunching glass.
"Healthy
"Get down!" John yelled, tackling Sherlock to the ground and pushing him beneath a row of pews as bullets sprayed around them, tearing the tops of the benches and showering them with splinters and chunks of wood. Sherlock watched as John rolled onto his stomach, aimed, and concisely sent bullets into each leg he saw from under the benches, firing more as they collapsed and their heads appeared, the look of surprise frozen on their faces as bullets ripped through their brains.
Or: he can go out there now, cry and beg for John’s forgiveness, and a rocky road is paved but exists. John joins him for the remainder of his travel.
“Yes you will.” John replies, and his voice is hoarse, raw from cottonmouth and dry spit. He can feel the blood trickling towards his brain, pooling in the crevices.
"I have to admit I was quite confounded by just how the victims were related. Taking Emma's methods into account, I knew they had to be. She didn't strike randomly. She wanted to send a message." Sherlock says as he sips from the carton of milk on John's tray; it seemed that he finally understood the frustration of trying to make someone eat when they kept refusing to.
"Don't go where I can't find you." He muttered lowly in John's ear. John nodded, laying his forehead back down on Sherlock's.
"The Woods" - Daughter
She stands before him, raw. Her eyes are red. She’s tired.
Mary had always been his favourite assistant.
"Pink? What do you mean?" He asks, looking down.
Angelo — and his name was only ever just 'Angelo', or 'boss', or 'pops', or even a 'sir' now and then — was a man notoriously distrustful of strangers, and he had good reason to be, if not only because of the bar that he certainly did not run serving booze he certainly did not have. He'd been in Baker for near twenty years by the time I met him, and word around town was he'd been chased out of Sicily on account of a bad bet, or some kind of family debt, or that he'd been caught in bed with a duke's wife, or caught with the duke himself—the story changed depending on who was telling it. Although he used to joke that he had a bad neck from always looking over his shoulder, I never found out what exactly it was he'd been watching out for.
Sherlock ignores her, and approaches the plinth the laver sits on, slowly circling it from all sides.
The man raised his gun and fired.
"Wonderful. Well, welcome home, then."
He tries to sit up faster than he should have, and feels his head rock like a buoy in choppy water.
“39.” The voice repeats. “And a handsome man like you, a doctor, unmarried, and a confirmed bachelor frequently seen in the company of the great Sherlock Holmes. Well. One has to wonder.”
But Sherlock was prone to leap off buildings at impossibly heights and survive. A train would be child's play for him if he had truly planned it out, if he had known that he was going to leave again, leave him, leave John out in an empty compartment without so much as a goodbye.
"It's alright." John murmurs, a slow smile coming to his face. "It's alright. You don't have to be sure all the time. It means you're human."
John knew very well what Moran was planning to do. He was too smart to fire into a crowd, not because he might hit a civilian, but because he might miss. He was a trained sniper, accurate from a distance, not running across bumpy cobblestones that might jar his aim.
"Curious?"
They sit outside, underneath the lights and canvas umbrellas, amid the sounds of clinking glass and comfortable conversation. John's fingers trace the condensation from his glass through the rough grooves of the wooden table. Soft acoustic music strums through the open door from inside the pub. Birds flutter in the treetops of the woods behind them.
A careful smile crept on John’s face. Sherlock suddenly despised the kindness in it, envied the ease of its appearance, like nothing bothered him.
He looks down, scanning the forest, through the tangle of branches and thickets, until he spots what he's been looking for: a thick pack of dark spots, moving at an inhuman speed towards the hollow where he left Sherlock and Lestrade. That's a problem, a very big problem. He needs to get them away, and quickly, but they're too heavy to take two at a time—and there's no way he'll leave one to fight for themselves no matter the chances of it happening—and they need to lose their scents
Mrs Hudson comes up with tea and biscuits. Her pot is appalling compared to John's, but Sherlock drinks it because it means she will not disturb him for the rest of the day trying to get him to eat.
"Spit it out then," Irene hummed. "I can hear the gears turning."
. All involving Moriarty, all involving Sherlock’s planned fall. It had Moran’s name all over it, metaphorically. Sherlock’s own face made a shoddily applied appearance in the space between her breasts, the picture with that damned idiotic hat on his head.
A cold dread began to work its way through his body.
He ducked back down, out of sight, and stared through the limbs of the banister at that curly dark hair, at that pale face, at those long legs tucked under the pew in front of him, at that man that was currently a.) not dead, much less six feet under and b.) wasn't currently giving a care in the world that he was alive—alive, right there where John could see him—as if John's life hadn't slipped off the banister and shattered to pieces in front of him.
"What do you want me to tell you, John?"
, like ice that hadn't thawed. "If I recall you looked quite like this, didn't you? You can do it again."
A shaky sigh tumbles from his chest. He cards his hands through his hair, as if that will somehow fix him.
He settles into his persona like shrugging on an old, comfy jumper. He straightens his posture and quiets his mind. He is Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and he knows nothing about anything and he is willing to die for it. He’s never heard the name Sherlock Holmes, never met him or talked to him or loathed him or loved him. He doesn’t even know who he is. Just a stranger, that’s all. No one he believes in. No one he’s heard of.
“You’ve a lovely home.” Lestrade says as he looks around the room. “You said Mycroft bought it for you?”
Sherlock decides not to add “Unless you want there to be”. He’s seen John without a towel. Not a Ken doll. Surprising. Interesting. He wonders if John would feel stimulus like a normal person. He is in a unique opportunity to seduce an angel. The experiment to end all experiments.
The train swayed lazily back and forth, ignorant of its passengers, ignorant of their baggage, ignorant of their circumstances. The train knew no more of the fact that it held the world's only consulting detective and his partner-slash-assistant-slash-best friend than it did of how exactly the universe worked and if there was a god spinning it all around. It just knew its duty, go here and go there, rest, then repeat. Go from Prague to Sarajevo, go from Berlin to Prague, go from Bruges to Leipzig, go from Novgorod to Klaipeda…the destination doesn't matter to a train. It, for lack of a better description, simply doesn't know any better.
"He was a client?"
John paused, chewing his gum.
"I stay," John begins. "Because sometimes I think I'm just as selfish as you are. Actually, sometimes I
He turned the knob and opened the door, but what did he expect to see? John, waiting for him with a hot pot of tea? John, smiling from the chair or dusting their skull like nothing had happened? How odd it was that when John had moved in the skull was
Sherlock nodded and picked up his fork, taking a large bite of egg.
This man was getting annoyed with him. Good for him. He clearly did not have much patience.
he found out. He had been right, as usual, when he had said that John needed a battleground to feel useful. After the abysmal event at Moika Palace, John had helped deal with the fallout between the Tsar and the Grand Duke; he and Felix both had been put under house arrest, and outright exile seemed likely. The abdication in March had been the death knell they had all been waiting for, and they left for the Crimea, where he’d seen Felix off onto the Marlborough with his wife and daughter. He knew that returning to Petrograd would mean certain death, especially considering how close he’d been to the royal family, even with a different name.
"Apologies."
"Sherlock," He huffs. "Sherlock, what's wrong?"
"Do I look like I could be arsed to care about bloody
"I asked if you could hear me, but that question seems to be answered." Sherlock looked back out to the alley's entrance before gently wrapping his hands under John's arms and lifting him upwards. "Come on you great idiot. We need to get back to the hotel. I swear to God, if you've gotten anything broken—"
understand
“That’s different. You don’t have to touch me to hurt me.”
"After all this time, you're still amazed by me, by the things I do, by who I am…it's like you're never bored with me."
Moriarty sighed. “If you insist.” He pushed the centermost white pawn forwards slowly, with a pointed finger.
John nods, not taking his eyes off of Sherlock, who grimaces at his brother.
“Not here.” Sherlock answers. “Same as you.”
John coughed, nearly dropping his fork. "S'fine. Why?"
"You would do the same if it were him." Irene responded tartly. "What does that say about you?"
"John? John, I swear, if you do something so predictably tedious as die on me tonight, I will find a way to drag you back from the hereafter so I can kill you again—"
“Oh, don’t you go get all high and mighty
John scoffed. "So we're all just your normal undead creatures of the night then? Ta very much."
“I have several theories.” Sherlock answers, leaning back in his chair. “Fire is a predominately dangerous element, one that man has struggled to control since its discovery, or rather since humanity discovered that we could summon it to usefulness. To say ‘fire walk with me’ is suggestive that someone wishes to be its equal or otherwise have a mutual energy on par with its chaotic destructiveness. Or perhaps they want to purge it from themselves and walk with it, unharmed. Or, even more ludicrous, they wish to demonstrate the idolatry of human hubris and try and control fire, make it do what they want.”
“I trust them with my secrets. They’ve been very good so far, wouldn’t you agree Dmitri?” Felix said, and the tips of the Grand Dukes ears reddened.
“Nachash.”
“Well, we can’t just sit here all night.” John said finally, withdrawing his hand to get his husband’s attention. “Game’s afoot.”
The Diplomat nodded. “I understand that your wife works with you?”
"I don't want to always wonder what sent you to me."
catching a show.” Sherlock said lowly. “Think of something else.”
Slowly, he turns around.
"Simple. One in the chamber."
"This isn't a
Then, they'd arrived at their hotel, an unremarkable concrete inn with a rickety elevator and even more untrustworthy stairs. Yet they both agreed it was perfect since the last thing they wanted to do was attract attention. John trusted Sherlock's knowledge of inconspicuous residences since he had seemingly become a connoisseur of them during his global trek.
John turned his head aside and spat, a trickle of red running down his mouth. "Full moon tonight."
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
*   *   *
did with most everything—but had listened anyways to all the reasons why John thought it was a bad idea, why they should wait, how it could be used against them. He acknowledged it all, and shrugged, and asked again. And John said yes.
John looked to him from the window, confusion in his face.
"Gum? They gave you
Walking slowly back to the den, he loaded the bullet into the chamber, coming around the sofa and Sherlock, who hadn’t moved a muscle. John looked down at the gun, then held it out, pointed towards his own heart, so close he couldn’t possibly miss.
"Sherlock Holmes." He says, but with Nachash's voice, poisonous and airy in a way John's never was. "Thought I'd give your bird back to you. You don't mind if I taught Polly here some phrases, do you? And you," he turns to Harry and smiles. "I know some people who will very upset to find you missing."
It was not an option.
Their ride was silent, at least until they got to their floor.
He wakes in the night. Dim light swathes the room from the shaded bedside lamp. Sherlock is staring at him. He tells him to go back to sleep.
Sherlock inhales sharply and curses. John hears him shout at the driver to go faster. His voice is hoarse like he's on the verge of tears.
"For now." She says, smiling solemnly. "You're not getting off that easy."
“Sherlock you have to eat.”
John stood, coming to rest in the negative spaces between them, and flickers of all of their past conversations floated down towards him.
“Which question do you want me to answer first?”
I stop, remembering, cycling through backwards memories. When
that. You know what this has been like for me. This is the longest conversation we’ve had in
call yourself worthless, John." Sherlock said, kneeling in front of him and taking his hands away from his face. "You are many things, but worthless? You'll never be worthless. Never. Do you understand? You mean so much to—so much to me. You will never be worthless in my eyes, not even if you shot me in both kneecaps and insulted my mother."
He stands by the edge of the pool, looking down at the pale, red-headed corpse that will be identified shortly as Lily Teague.
?” He asks, shaking off his surprise. “
"Yes, that's it, talk dirty to me." John said dryly. Sherlock made a noise of irritation before he open-mouth kissed the tip of John's glans, gently tonguing the slit, and John thought that the crackle in his ears sounded like bursting fireworks.
“Shhh”, John said with a smile. Brilliant John. Beautiful John. Yellow John.
“What?”, Sherlock asked, unable to stop himself.
Sherlock didn't answer, but John turned to look at Harry and greeted her with a hug. "Hello, Harry!"
Sherlock looked at her and said lowly. "Look, I'm flattered, but I'm not interested. Good?"
She looked down, not feeling capable of looking at him in the eyes. "Sherlock, I..."
A warm hand placed on his shoulder. A warmth that was capable of breaking all of the coldness from that terrible basement he’d been kept in. He knew back then that he was really back at home.
He turned to look to the drawer of his bedside table, not for the first time.
“You are better than you think you are, John”, Sherlock said desperately, because John
"I missed you", was all Sherlock said and he meant it.
He grabbed the stack of folders Lestrade had brought him as soon as he came back from the death. Cold cases from his time away. That would keep John enternained for long enough. He smiled as he placed them onto John's lap.
Instead, Sherlock just shrugged. "At least you called me Sherlock, Johnny boy. So we're getting somewhere." He said winking at him and John just couldn't be mad at him. It was impossible.
"...You."
"Because you love her."
John looked disappointed, no longer angry, he was in pain, not physically, but somehow emotionally, like Sherlock's words had hit him hard. "You know? Each day it feels more and more like I really don't"
"Well, next time you plan on dancing by yourself don't invite me to your house, then." John said, trying to sound serious, but being unable to hide his mockery tone.
All of this had been a mistake. Sherlock knew that from the very beginning, from the moment they met and he convinced himself of it when out of nowhere he asked John if they could share a cab. Stupid.
Hawthorne looked startled for a moment. “He was the jumper of St. Bart’s? Wow. I did catch the news on that. Lot of coverage from the press for days.”
"Any clues?"
It was a nice color, after all.
John chuckled. “No! It’s just- have you looked at yourself?”
said,
I did”, John replied.
greaser
Sherlock interjected, “and the optical nerve!”
He sighed as he took out his biology book. Not even his favorite class made him feel any different, any better, and he was sad, no, not really sad. He was angry, no, not really angry. He couldn't figure out what it really was, until he realized: he was just disappointed. And no, not at Sherlock. At him. For allowing Sherlock, the bloody idiot, to enter to his life, to change him, to make him happier. No, not happy. Different. Irreparably different.
Sherlock frowned and stared at him. Waiting.
It turned out that the manor had been sold around six months ago, and the existence of said passage was never made known to the newcomers. The old owner knew about the reputation of the people who were about to buy the house -the man used to be a MP during Thatcher’s administration- and he was the one who broke into the room and took the first papers he found, for he knew they were valuable no matter what.
“-Plus, you did a great job tonight. You deserve some spare time”, Sherlock said quietly, in that deep, soothing, profound and complex voice of his.
Harry widened her eyes and made a big 'O' with her face. "So that's who you were with!"
He couldn’t bring himself to. He had to say it all. He had kept far too much from John and he was exhausted of secrets, he was exhausted of that invisible barrier that had drawn between them. He knew this wouldn’t fade it away, he knew his chances to go back to what they used to be were minimal and that nothing would ever be the same, but John needed to know. John had to know. He dragged a deep breath that came out shaky, “Moriarty had targeted you”, he finally admitted.
Sherlock looked at him, surprised by the sudden exhibition of emotion, and smiled back. "You'll drive."
Eyes were difficult to draw.
When he got home, the street was filled with police cars, agents and detectives, working on solving the case. He let out a sigh. It was unbelievable that something like that could have even happened. It seemed more like a nightmare than reality.
pretender, you follow?"
Hello, did you miss me?
John had greeted Melissa when they’d met at Scotland Yard. He’d recognized her immediately, recognized her by her
How could she say to him that she exposed him and his feelings towards Sherlock? That she was direct and crude and real and went straight to the point? That Sherlock was surprised and that she was confused because the detective had actually showed a hint of emotion? How could she tell him that? She decided she definitely couldn't, so she had to come up with an excuse and do it fast. "Jeez, you are such a drama queen!" -the only thing she could come up with.
unpredictable
"Confirmed."
He felt a hand on his forearm and he turned to look at it. John was looking at him with wide eyes. “Are you okay?”
John nodded and opened the door wider, allowing Sherlock in. Sherlock stepped inside and took a quick look around.
“That’s not under my control”, John replied.
He came back to his flat and closed the door behind him, leaning against it and closing his eyes. He couldn’t lose John, not after all the things they’d shared already, he couldn’t let him go.
"What?"
He turned to look at her and rolled his eyes. "This is your fault." He said.
“I’m sorry.”
Harry blinked in surprise. "What?"
Harry smiled even wider and looked very amused. "Oh my god! TELL ME EVERYTHING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW!"
"Sometimes it's so hard dealing with you, Johnny boy. Can I at least turn the radio on?"
John cleared his throat. "...Because you know... She likes girls so..."
“Yes, hello, I need an ambulance immediately-”
Sherlock relaxed his face and smile. "Oh, no need to apologize, John. That's what I'm here for."
"Of course I'm sure."
John had to admit the idea didn't sound that exciting without Sherlock, he wanted to go with him, even if that included trying to ignore his sister's jokes implying his love for the detective. He wanted to go with him. But his sister wanted to go, so he was going with her. He wanted to thank her for everything, whatever it was she had done to help him. "Fine, fine, get ready to go! We'll be leaving in an hour."
“We could have met there, you know?”
The bell rang. History. They had
Sherlock scoffed and looked at John accusingly. "Do you live under a rock? Or you are just
The nurse stood there, looking confused and taken aback for a moment, before sighing and saying "yes, sir", as he opened the door and left.
He knew sentiment was the cause of all of his problems, it had already happened once, how did he fall again for that one? He hated himself, for being so weak, so silly, for placing his attention on such mundane things, for being so human.
Sherlock didn't reply.
*******
And God, Sherlock was perfect.
Sherlock looked down, ignoring John's eyes, which looked so penetrating, so big, so
She shook her head. "I-I..."
"What?", Mycroft asked, raising an eyebrow.
But he remembered the conversation John had had with Irene Adler back then. The way he stood there, silently, as Irene acknowledged his feelings. When she talked, Sherlock rolled his eyes, imagining some kind of comeback from John, some response, utterly denying all accusations, as he had done a thousand times before.
“You were wondering. So was I. But when I looked at you, playing the violin and looking like a painting by Vermeer, I realized that- I want this. I want us. I mean if you’re willing, if you’re willing to want me back.”
I didn't remember either that I had deleted half of my life.
Things got awkward between them sometimes. There were moments when they looked at each other silently and then tore their gaze away from the other, and then this horrible silence fell over the flat, and John didn’t know how to fill it, didn’t know what to say. Sherlock looked like he didn’t know what to do either, and no matter how hard John tried, he had no idea why it happened, he couldn’t understand, he couldn’t put a name to it.
He felt so much anger repressed inside him, ready to burst. "He cares about me? No he doesn't. He does not at all."
"Let's go idiot, it's late!" John said, grabbing Sherlock by the elbow and dragging him towards the door.
John shrugged and fixed his eyes to the floor, as if it was going to fall if he stopped staring at it. “Yes. He’s gone. I’m just cutting all the links I had left of him.”
"No I'm not Harry! I would never ever fall for someone like him, Okay Harry?"
"Alright. Look." The old man said, standing up and taking a bag of erasers he was keeping under the table. "Those are the ones you are going to shake. The reason why I'm doing this is because you
Sherlock hadn’t known Sebastian personally. By the time he was captured he was wearing a suite which seemed as expensive as Moriarty’s Westwood. He looked like a completely normal man, his expression was stoic, he was definitely younger than Jim and, as far as Sherlock could deduce, had suffered an addiction to drugs before meeting Moriarty.
Sherlock looked at John with a sigh. "Fine."
They had fallen asleep at some point. After Sherlock had poured his whole heart out to John, he felt completely exhausted and collapsed against the couch, closing his eyes and wondering if he had just committed the worst mistake he could have ever done, when a few minutes later John sat right next to him, looking at him fixedly, not saying anything, neither of them doing it but saying it either way. They didn’t kiss, they didn’t do anything else, but at the moment it wasn’t necessary. Sherlock was happy enough.
He wasn’t really in the mood. His hand had been trembling and the atmosphere simply wasn’t right. His flat didn’t have the magic of 221B, his flat was devoid of life, devoid of energy, devoid of creativity, devoid of
John looked at him with a smile. "Goodbye Sherlock, please, please, please, be careful. No drugs, no smoking, no drinking, nothing!"
Tuesday couldn’t come faster.
As if he would have such luck. Nurses came and go as if his room was an open bouffet, and every once in a while other doctors would check on his vital signs. He got his mask removed two days later and Mycroft would keep an eye on him most of the time, and when he wasn't there he kept his minions by the door, guarding it. He would escape through the window but he was on a third floor and felt too weak to do it so, plus, John was there.
But now, standing in the middle of an empty flat, a flat as lifeless as he felt, the only 'Chiaro' he had left was the hideous white of the walls, standing as empty canvas, reminding him of the life that was and the life that is.
Mike scratched the back of his head. “Well, it’s more like an idea that popped into my mind out of nowhere and-”
Hawthorne raised his eyebrows, looking startled. "Well, it's the first time a patient comes to erase his
John smiled. "Say it again", he whispered.
"So you don't want to talk about it..." She said looking down.
Sherlock looked up and stared at Mycroft angrily. “Bugger off!”, he replied.
“Of course”, John said with a smile.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Why?”
“Give me a 2H”, John said, focused.
“Alright, that’s all I wanted to know. Thank you.”Sherlock said turning his back at Victor, but his wrist was suddenly caught and he had to turn back. Of course Victor would do something like this, Sherlock knew that, the question was if he
Sherlock frowned, without knowing what to deduce from the conversation they just had.
Sherlock reacted and realized it was already dark, so it was late. He was sitting on his chair and looked at the woman, sitting in front of him, looking at him, smiling. He had forgotten she was still there, he had forgotten even what he had been thinking about all this time. "Excuse me, what?"
Sherlock shook his head. "No I didn't, I just didn't consider all of the variables."
"Why did you bring me here? out of all the places you could have taken me to, why here?", he sounded defeated, disappointed. He couldn't help it.
Sherlock cleared his throat. "I want to talk to you."
what he painted as he was doing at that moment.
When the elevator doors opened and John and Sherlock joined Lestrade, Sherlock could see Lestrade looking at their joined hands and smiling slightly. Sherlock simply cleared his throat. John didn’t seem to notice. Lestrade stood straight and looked at the elevator doors.
lose you. I refuse to let you go."
Sherlock stood in the middle of the living room, looking at the stairs leading to John's bedroom intently.
"Oh no, go ahead. I want to have it." Sherlock said, coming closer to Mycroft. John looked at them, not knowing what to do.
“Good.”
John really had no idea what he was angry about until he saw Sherlock sitting in the same little chair at the turn of the corner as always. Damn it. He felt a rush of heat in his head and realized the root of all his problems (as had been usual so far this year) was, once again, the greaser.
He stared at her. He still couldn't deduce a single thing from her. Why? He didn't have the slightest idea. He could see nothing.
Sherlock's attention snapped back to John. His left hand was trembling, but other than that, he didn't look much different. If someone who didn't know John were to look at him at that moment, they wouldn't notice anything odd about him.
Sherlock sat up in a rush. Everything was turning. His breathing was ragged. John was holding his arm.
John stopped and stood frowning and wondering if his name had come from
He’d have to act but he would have to wait until she was far away from John, enough to assure that she probably wouldn’t hit the target when she aimed, based on her (possible) inexperience on handling a handgun.
"You-", John was starting to lose control, now not even bothering with hiding his trembling hand, it looked as if all of John's body was trembling with rage and if Sherlock saw a couple of tears starting to strain John's eyes, he preferred not to focus on them. "You made me see you die. You-", he turned to point at the tape, "jumped in front of me? I couldn't I- how, how could you do that?"
Sherlock dragged a deep breath, feeling frustrated. He shook his head, looked down, looked up, then simply replied. "Your voice is the one there, not mine. You know better."
"Why?"
They struggled even harder with her but she was starting to recover consciousness and at least was able to walk by herself, muttering words nor John nor Sherlock could manage to understand. Finally they left her at the bedroom shushing her and closed the door quietly, going downstairs and sitting at the kitchen table. "Come on, I'll make you some coffee, I like talking to you when you're sober."
“Yes.”
His mother folded her arms and her face dropped. "He hasn't gotten home yet."
"What?"
"Since when do you care about my own sake?"
"Are you coming or not?"
He licked his lip as an impulse. He couldn't help himself, the temptation was too big. He could simply walk out that door, two or three blocks to the east of shops and flats and grey dull buildings and finally he would get what he was craving for. Simple.
"Your date, Sherlock, I heard that you were going out with a girl. I want to know it all!"-she was too drunk to realize all the things she was giving away.
But Sherlock was right. If he wanted to draw a body, he couldn’t get all metaphysical and start enunciating whatever made the person who they were. He had to observe the composure of his body, the structure of it, the bags under the eyes, the wrinkles, the posture, the height, the weight.
Mike looked down and shook his head. "And are you alright?"
John stood up immediately to grab him. "Sherlock! You can't drive like this."
John shook his head. "Yes, it's just that I didn't expect you to live in...here." He said as he casted an eye all over the house.
“I guess, goodnight, then.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a small smile on his face, “I’ll be fine, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock walked just behind him. John never turned, not once, to check if Sherlock was there, he knew he was.
"Will you delete him from your mind again if he doesn't?", Greg asked, sounding slightly bitter about it.
John felt a bit disappointed, but not completely surprised, he would have been surprised if Sherlock would have said yes. "Come on, give yourself a day off, you've been working hard enough!"
-", he stopped himself immediately.
Lestrade's eyes widened before he broke into a smile.
"Don't worry John, he'll come to sense soon." Mycroft said, looking at Sherlock's back.
John looked at the portrait info.
"Oh God stop it, stop this and tell me right now what is happening! Because something is wrong Sherlock Holmes! Don't you dare telling me it isn't because it is,
John smiled because for him,
"Once this is over, can you please delete the blog?"
Sherlock snorted. "Have you seen him? Do you really think he is the one who got me drunk?"
Two human hands, to be exact.
The first time Sherlock saw a painting he was 4 years old. The National Gallery of British Art was too big and he felt too small, lost amidst the labyrinth of passages, portraits and landscapes. He remembered it clearly, the steady presence of his mother by his side, holding his hand and smiling tightly. She loved this, he could tell.
John lifted his head from Sherlock's shoulder and looked at him. He was feeling slightly better now, at least he wasn't crying, and he felt calmed enough to talk about this. "It's better isn't it? Before we became too attached... Before we fell..."
"You're not Sherlock Holmes. I don't know who you are, but you're not him."
"I came here because I wanted to." He said with a small smile.
"I would appreciate it if you didn't remind me that damn accident every time!"
The class had been terrible, he spent the whole time trying to focus on the lesson he was receiving, instead of in John's hair and how badly he wanted to touch it and hold it and drown in his smell and God, when did all of this happened? When did the game become something more than just that?
Greg's eyes were widened. He just expected Sherlock to say "sorry" sulkily and not meaning it. But this was far much more than he could have asked for.
John had been at lunch break when he was kidnapped and he was taken somewhere. Somewhere with feelings attached. Somewhere related to their own story. Melissa might have gained access to those memories when she erased John’s, considering that Melissa was the killer. Which was just a theory, only a hypothesis that Sherlock honestly didn’t want to prove correct.
Warning for a bit of homophobia!
He looked at her and frowned. "Why would I?"
Sherlock snorted. "Involved! I'm not involved. Nor planning to."
"Shut up Harry, you're not helping!"
"Right, you and your crazy obsession with following the established paradigms..."
Harry didn't react. "God, you are useless." Sherlock said frowning.
Sherlock looked down at his book. "So?"
And Sherlock’s thoughts vanished.
John grabbed a charcoal and took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.
"Sure, see you then." Mike said, turning towards the group of friends which was waiting for him outside. John nodded as some kind of greeting towards them, and they smiled at him. Perhaps he wasn't that much of a burden for them, perhaps they enjoyed his company. Well, hopefully.
John smiled as Sherlock turned to look at him, “hello”, he said.
"I'm taller and older, I wouldn't do that if I were you." The greaser said and it should have sounded like a joke, except some thing in the way he talked told John that Sherlock wasn't joking at all.
“And that has worked well enough.”Sherlock nodded and stared into Victor’s eyes seriously, they looked full of resentment. “Stop killing yourself, Victor. And stop trying to drag me down with you. Goodbye.”
"Oh, it's so funny when people
"And I'll see you tomorrow."
A loud clank resounded in the kitchen, followed by a muffled “shit!”
"I don't know, maybe you forgot to say something"
And just like that, he fell silent.
greaser
John leaned a bit closer to Sherlock, and for a second, for a tiny little second, Sherlock could see in John's eyes a glimpse of recognition, a glimpse of the old John Watson, the one who had apparently vanished. The doctor stared at Sherlock's face, then said calmly. "You should stop consuming them, you know?"
After a long time without talking he looked at Mike and smiled. "So... I'd better be off."
Harry grabbed her head between her hands and closed her eyes. "What are you doing?"
He grabbed his keys and walked out the flat, heading west.
"It seems not." Sherlock agreed.
I'm sorry for the angst, I truly am. I don't enjoy it, I don't even know why I do it, I just sort of do. Plus, I watched the special so I'm definitely angstier than ever. If you want to understand better this crazy idea that popped into my head for the final problem, just read the notes at the end of the chapter! x
weak, nerd!" He said as he stopped laughing.
“You need a rhythm”, he continued, “that rhythm is determined by what you saw in the mirror, how to draw broad shoulders, a straight back? You follow a rhythm, you set the rhythm, you set the longitude of your traces, you follow along those traces and you have the contour, it all follows a pattern”, he said as he traced the shoulders of his torso, “you also need texture, see?” He said, pointing at the left side of the picture, that had been darkened in order to create the illusion of the chiaroscuro, “the darkness and the light are capable of creating that texture, you believe there’s another dimension because the light effects make you think there is.”
********
John laughed but then his expression turned a little more serious. "Let me take you home, it's the least I can do, after all you did..." He pleaded.
John looked at him and raised his eyebrows, perhaps he
Sherlock nodded, a small smile in his face. “West London? I’m in Central London, so it’s on its way”, he said walking already to the doors.
That's why he was wanting so desperately for it to be Monday already, so he could see Sherlock again and convince himself that there was absolutely nothing between them and that nothing would ever happen,
Sherlock stood silent for a moment, simply staring at him. John felt his heart stopping in his chest. “Don’t be absurd, John”, he finally replied.
“Tell me what you want”, he whispered into Sherlock’s ear.
John thought about it. Were nude men in Sherlock’s mind? He stopped himself from commenting on it, but it was an interesting fact.
”, he asked in amusement.
John felt a little relieved. "Oh good, let me add that to the book I'm writing about you."
“Care to fill me in?”
"Don't worry, we all have secrets, Mr. Holmes. It's okay if you don't want to tell me, I'll find out anyway, eventually."
“Did you take in the shape, the color? Since you’re so fond of colors”, Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes.
“I am.”
Tom came back from the kitchen and took a seat next to Molly, holding her hand. "Looking good, John."
Not thinking about the scar.
John smiled sarcastically, he was frowning and tried to hide his tone of anger, it didn't work. "Fine,
"Sherlock Holmes." The boy in front of him said with the biggest smile on his face. Sherlock felt his heart stopped beating, just like that. He might be suffering a cardiac arrest. Or probably he just had forgotten how much he missed that face. Except he didn’t. But he did. But he didn’t.
“John?”
John had to admit the fair was cool. He like those kinds of things. Well, actually before this one he hadn’t been to a fair before, and as soon as he walked in he thought about the horrible idea he might actually be wasting the best years of his life. Of course he was, but that was definitely going to change.
John hesitated for a moment. "No. No, there was no such thing as a relationship. I mean, not really. He was just my friend." He shrugged, feeling like a big-ass liar. Sure, just his friend. If Sherlock would have been just his friend, he certainly wouldn't be sitting in that place with those wires on his head.
Idiots.
“People do little else, John.”
How could he even put it into words? How could he express how much he admired John Watson and how much he hated the fact that he admired John Watson, because he had proven him
After a long day, he was finally able to fall asleep.
"It's not obvious to me."
“Yes. We did our research. Well, apparently is a place which helps you forget someone. It just deletes it from the patient’s memory. Just like that.”
"Oh don't you worry, now you boys have fun!" She replied.
"He... Stopped for a second, made sure it
Sherlock stood up as soon as he saw the boy walking down the hall, and hurried towards him. "John!"
"Shh...shh...it's okay." Sherlock whispered, refusing to let go of John's hold.
And Sherlock allowed him to.
Sherlock arrived a few minutes later, with his perfectly combed hair and his heavy leather jacket.
John realized he was, in fact, smiling and cleared his throat before answering his sister. "I'm not."
"He never goes out with a person like... You. So who are you? Why did he listen to you?"
Sherlock finally turned to look at John. “He is?”
John was so curious, he wanted to know what was going on, what had happened to her. She had been dead for three years and now she was back? How was that even possible? Well, it couldn't be that surprising to John, apparently faking death was easier than he thought. She wasn't the first case.
If he did, John was dead.
"I'm sorry, do you know the patient?" Hawthorne inquired seriously.
"Oh but we both know what happened."
"She is dating someone." Sherlock replied without looking at the woman.
*********
Perhaps the fact he had already had five cups of beer was helping with it.
“This is getting boring, you know?”, John said as Sherlock looked through the window. He had just finished a drawing -a surprisingly good drawing- of a right leg, but it really was getting boring.
Absolutely terrified. And he had no idea what of.
"For a while, if you don't mind."
John nodded again and looked down. An uncomfortable silence feel between them. Greg knew that leaving Sherlock aside, they didn't have much to talk about. This was turning far too awkward, so Greg did the only thing he could and spoke again. "...Just, some murders. Missing people, you know, the usual." He said as if he never had stopped talking.
John’s breath caught.
"Heartbreak Hotel." Sherlock said while he mumbled the lyrics of the song, something John found very funny.
"Mine does." John said convinced.
"Watson"
John stood fixed to that spot, unable to move. His brain couldn’t process it all at the same time, it was still trying to adjust to the warmth of Sherlock’s breath by his ear, to the softest hint of his lips touching his earlobe, to the touch of their hands. It took him so long to respond that he hadn’t even realized that Sherlock had walked away.
As soon as he arrived home, he deliberately and with a lot of effort placed the little blue box where the syringes were in and tucked it inside of what used to be John's closet in what used to be John's bedroom. He knew that if he had the need, this wouldn't avoid it, but would delay it. Entering John's room was painful, so painful he almost had to give up on his task. He finally managed to do it, hoping the invading memories would be enough to keep him out of that room.
He walked towards the kitchen and put the kettle on.
“They’re terrible”, Sherlock said out of nowhere, then he bit his tongue, feeling a bit uncomfortable for having spoken to John in such a way.
Fanart made by
not an illusion, not a fiction created by his mind. A fact.
"Sherlock...that was... That was..."
He gathered all his will, recalling what had happened the last time he took them. The accident had been his wake-up call, in that moment he knew he had to quit them for real, forever. Forever.
“It was-”
“We were nothing.”Victor cut Sherlock sharply.
Then John frowned and looked at Sherlock, surprised. The greaser sighed. "What?"
"Maybe...", Sherlock said between kisses, "...we should get some sleep."
------------------------
"Alright then, I'll call the patients. What's his name?" She said, grabbing the application that was in her desk.
"Your brother. I know that he has found out I am back, Mr. Holmes. He wants to get rid of me. The whole British government is looking for me. They want me dead and I don't want to die."
"Sherlock?"
the slim, lean line of…no no, not of Sherlock. Someone else. Definitely someone else, an imaginary someone else…
John turned to look at him for a second. The greaser was laying on the chair in such a wonderful way, he could barely see him, but his silhouette looked incredible. "And what do you want me to do about that?"
His acute sense of smell activated as soon as he stopped in the counter. He would recognise that smell anywhere,
Victor looked down and shrugged. “I don’t know. A lot, probably. They don’t work anymore.”
“You’re beautiful”, he whispered with a smile.
As soon as the teacher passed to the next desk, John turned to look at Sherlock, who took the magazines out of the bag again and continued reading one of them. "Sherlock!"
As a present to you all for your loyalty, support and yes, patience with this fic, I've created
Sherlock relaxed his face a bit and smiled. "Righto."
“None of your business”
The experiment didn't go exactly as planned and teenagers started enjoying the use of the pill (just like Sherlock), which led to the rising of the counterculture during the 1960s (a topic that I personally LOVE).
His phone chimed. New text message.
Sherlock said lifting his eyebrow.
Then, without saying any other word, John moved the blankets of the hospital bed and tucked himself next to Sherlock, who simply looked at him with surprise. John leaned his forehead against Sherlock's shoulder. "I thought you'd died on me."
John seemed to have remembered something, because he stood up immediately. "Oh! Hold on a second, the tea! I'll be back in a minute."
John looked at him with something akin to wonder.
“You need to draw the limbus! Don’t forget about the limbus!”
Sherlock frowned. "Well, you saw it by yourself, John."
The rest of the week passed by. Sherlock didn't come back to school for the rest of the week and John wondered how on earth did his brother allow that? However, he got used to seeing Sherlock every time he came back home, sometimes it seemed like the greaser knew John's schedule and was waiting for him, to talk to him? Fix things perhaps? Certainly not. It was to ignore him and make John feel like shit. Which was working.
“No, it’s not- it’s not you.”
wrong. After they kissed, Sherlock turned to look at John, who didn't dare to look at him back and instead was looking at the lockers. His expression was unreadable, but Sherlock knew he was hurt. And he was
“You”, was all he managed to produce.
Sherlock didn't move, he didn't look up at John, he barely answered. "Thinking."
“Good.”
"So?"
"We'll administer some paracetamol, but it's all we can provide during the withdrawal, Mr. Holmes."
"Hello?" He heard through the phone. A woman's voice. Harry. Damn it. He was hoping his mom would pick up.
He stared at the portrait, trying to unveil its mysteries.
John’s eyes widened. “No.”
He closed his eyes and drew his fingers away.
Greg looked down. "No, I suppose you don't."
"I...um...wanted to apologize." Greg said clearing his throat.
class”, Sherlock said rolling his eyes.
"But you hated me, Sherlock. From the first day, remember?"
"Then why are you smiling?"
------------
And it only got slower. He couldn't relax anymore because there was a lowering of his blood pressure and he had counted 46 heartbeats in the last minute which meant that now he was keeping count of something which meant that the good effects of the morphine were gone.
It was a slow recovery and Sherlock would get frustrated and desperate. He'd be livid and short-tempered, and John put up with him every single time. Sherlock silently wondered when John would finally snap and leave, but he never did.
Jim groaned but finally stood up, feeling a little dizzy after last night's events. Moran went out the door hurriedly, Jim following him.
“Yes, you can. You can do anything, John”, Sherlock replied.
“Hello? Yes, I’d like two plates of Thai rice please”, John said as he talked on the phone.
Greg entered back to the room and said goodbye to John. He asked Sherlock one last time before he left. "Are you sure?"
“Y-Yes”, John’s voice stuttered.
"Stop what?"
faced him. "You have questions. Ask them or we're not leaving."
Mycroft just shook his head, and kept reading the book, as if nothing had happened.
She nodded, then she looked down and a small tear came down her face. She wiped it off fast, but not fast enough for John not to realize. He frowned. "Hey, everything okay?"
He sat, unable to wipe off that silly smile off his face (and he really didn’t want to). John came with two plates and two mugs and placed them over the table. Only then did Sherlock realize how hungry he was.
And he found the balance again.
Sherlock turned to look at him. "What about me?
The greaser's face suddenly turned serious and he looked down, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths. John leaned down a bit so he could take a better look at Sherlock.
Sherlock didn't know what to think, he didn't say a word. to be fair with himself, it had been an impulse, and impulse he was only aware of when they were halfway to the restaurant. Irene Adler was walking next to him, both were very quiet, but not in an awkward silence, more like in a thoughtful one, a very real, crude and mysterious one.
annoying..." John said with a smile.
her, she had helped him. Why doing it then? Why-
Lestrade rose an eyebrow and turned to look at Sherlock. Sherlock shook his head. "No."
John turned to look at him in surprise and smiled. "I'd like that, yes."
He didn’t go back to Sherlock’s flat that night. He didn’t want to seem eager and there was always a moment at the start of relationships, or…whatever this was, when John felt terrified that using love too much at first would prove disastrous to the future, and god, he didn’t want to ruin this, whatever this was.
"I'm tired of this. My parents don't seem to care, and she is only getting worse and worse and I can't help her. And I feel... Powerless."
"John! You are just a kid! You can't just go around pretending you know everything about the human body and thinking you'll solve a murder!"
----------------------
"Tell me the truth." Sherlock said seriously.
Now, more than ever, and unfailingly, unfaltering, I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
"While I was away, was it...hard for you? Did you...miss me?"
"After all you let me get my ass kicked..."
They were shaking the last couple of erasers when Hikes entered. "Holmes, Watson. Take a seat."
Sherlock laughed but kept kissing him eagerly. John's hand found Sherlock's cock and started pulling down as well, and their kisses turned frantic and messy and they couldn't care less. "John...", Sherlock gasped.
When he was in the bus a girl sat by his side. She was about a year younger, with light brown hair, wearing a polka dot dress and a left-sided pony tail. He looked at her as if she had lost her mind. She smiled shyly and muttered a barely hearable "hi." Sherlock turned his head to face the window, because that was better than having a small talk with a girl. She didn't give up. "... So you are the new one, what brought you here?"
be there, do you hear me? Are we clear on that?"
Sherlock sighed and turned to look at the window, pulling the glass completely down, and the wind was high but it was warm and it was comfortable.
At some point, Sherlock could have defined his life as a Chiaroscuro.
Lestrade was staring blankly at Melissa as he said in shock, "a cold case."
Of course John's father wouldn't like Sherlock, but Sherlock wasn't looking for approval anyway. He seriously didn't care. The problem was John did and throughout the whole dinner he kept smiling shyly at the greaser, like asking him
"Dull. Boring. Predictable."
"What? Oh yes, yes. I have too much research to do, find my way into Moriarty's web."
"But...why John? Did something happen?"
“Indeed.” He looked at Sherlock up and down. “You do look better.”
Melissa bit her lip, there wasn't much to do. Yet there was still another card on the table. "You know, Mr. Holmes? When Dr. Watson came in here, asking for our assistance, he didn't do it out of caprice, he hadn't slept in days, he was lonely and suffering nightmares and constantly seeing you dead in them. The only reason why he took that decision was because he was certain you had died, and the only relief he could find was that this procedure was permanent. He'd never see you again because you were dead, and he didn't have to think about you again because you were gone from his memory. It seemed to him like the only possible solution.
But no, he hadn’t. The message had been clear: ‘goodbye’ as in
Greg took a step aside, hoping John would show a hint of recognition. John was looking around everywhere. He turned to look at Sherlock at the mention of the name and his eyes widened.
Sherlock tried to not let his disappointment show. He wasn’t quite certain if it worked.
John didn't let go, never stopped for a moment, but his hands moved from grasping Sherlock's lapels to slide over his arms, until he took Sherlock's hands, that were still resting on his lips.
John thought,
"Why what?" Harry said looking at John quizzically.
“Hm?”
2. Don't worry, there is a happy ending! Don't let this kind of chapters bring you down!
hard. They stood silent for a moment, looking into each other's eyes, not moving.
It had been so long since that night.
Lestrade swallowed, "I- I... No. He is not."
He climbed up the stairs fast, filled with a deep need to see John again. He didn't even know what was happening right now between them, he just felt that John, being at Baker Street, being with him, was the right thing. The best thing.
“John”, Sherlock said.
John turned to look at him immediately. “What?”, he asked.
“Do you seriously think I only kill for the sake of it? Please Sherlock, I enjoy playing with their brains, with the memories they tried so hard to forget, I enjoy seeing their eyes, them begging me to stop the pain. It’s more interesting. Funny, isn’t it? The way love hurts and harms.”
"Wow! This is Elvis? He is not at all as I imagined him!"
But the last words John said before leaving:
“You’re not. Look! The brushstrokes express more than the painting does. Look at the shapes, the spirals of the trees, look at the amount of oil painting he put into the brush, look at the strength of the strokes.”
Sherlock remembered it all, quite clearly. Every single memory pierced into his mind, everything they had gone through. So many things, so many moments, so many cases. How could John not remember? The sleuth hoped that through the silence wouldn't filter the endless begging he was doing at the moment, that John could get over that shock, that this apparent PTSD that was threatening to take him away would vanish, that he would go back to being who he was, that everything would go back to being how it used to be.
John started screaming.
She finished the salad. Looked at Sherlock, who was looking at the window, thinking, as usual. She smiled. "Let's go back to Baker Street."
to be with someone as brilliant bright incredible talented smart amazing as Sherlock Holmes.
It hurt, he tried not to make a big deal of it, but he couldn't stop thinking about it, he needed to calm himself and stop thinking about what happened, so he took his coat and thought about leaving the apartment dramatically, but when he got to the living room, Sherlock was not longer there.
“Because-”,
"a nerd." John said, swallowing.
The man he had put in danger so many times and in so many ways.
Lestrade stood up in a rush and followed him.
Melissa gasped, bringing a hand to her mouth in surprise, "...is Dr. Watson-"
"Not today..."
Sherlock had saved him. Back when they first met. John had felt lost and somehow found another purpose in his life thanks to Sherlock. He couldn’t explain it, but he felt it.
He kissed his knuckles. "Shh- shh. It's okay love, you'll be okay", was all he managed to say.
"You had already saved me John, more times than I can count. And you did save me this once. I'm here, I'm alive."
The greaser looked up and tilted his head. "Problem?"
"Sherlock, she worked with Moriarty, remember?"
As soon as he did, he let go of John’s hand and walked away from him, sitting in the chair again.
"Look, just forget about what I say, let's shut up and shake erasers. I don't need your help, I don't need anything." He said taking some of the erasers from the bag and moving towards the windows to open them. He had lots of memories about
The reply came almost immediately, Sherlock’s fingers literally trembled as he unlocked his phone.
"I don't know."
*******
“No. Tell me what you dreamt of.”
John looked up and smiled at him, his breathing was fast and ragged, he looked just as eager as Sherlock felt. His hands skimmed up until they landed over Sherlock's pants and he pulled them down, Sherlock gasped at the sensation and at the intimacy of this.
"So you escaped from your house and took a boy to his house?"
There were so many things he wanted to say, but now he couldn't.
"I'll get there in a moment. Second of all, Harry won't come back in a while."
"Because he was leaving me. I knew it. I knew I was nothing but his
"And I think you know exactly why." Sherlock leaned closer to Mycroft. "So just say it now."
"He always overreacts, I feel fine! I'm fine!"
Sherlock thought, but didn't dare to say.
"Yeah, I'm better. My head is aching a little but..."
Oh God. Sherlock felt John’s pain as if it was his own. He felt that thought as if it was crushing his heart, tearing him apart. He felt he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think. He felt the strength leaving his body by putting himself in John’s place before he decided to get his mind erased, he could feel the desperation in John’s voice when he listened to the tape, but he never really understood the weight of it all.
John barely moved. He tried again, caressing John's hair with his fingers. "John..."
John drew a small circle in the middle between the pupil and the iris to leave it blank and create the illusion of light.
"So you got it wrong..." John said smugly, with a smile on his face.
John stood straight, ignoring the tingling sensation the warmth of Sherlock’s skin had left on his arms.
“Oh! Mr Holmes!”, Melissa said, standing up excitedly. She grabbed the tape and put in on the player.
The sun was starting to come out when Sherlock opened his eyes once again. He hadn't had any nightmares after he fell asleep on John's arms. He widened his eyes.
He didn’t know what he was saying, but he knew it anyway.
Sherlock shrugged, “Baker Street”.
And he was erasing it.
"I don't think so."
The greaser ignored John categorically.
"Did you see the way he was looking at you when I mentioned the condom things? Oh John, he was so jealous!"
John smiled weakly. "Thank you, Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock was particular on his own. His curls, his lean, tall figure and even those suits he wore created such a huge contrast with the prototypical image of the artist that it made John wonder whether he should be a model instead.
John looked at him with a frown, but Sherlock simply stared at him, invitingly.
Greg shook his head. "No man, you're drunk."
It wasn't quite clear, it wasn't specific enough, he couldn't understand any of it.
And fascinating.
No. He couldn't let John see them. He didn't want John to see him. Didn't want John to pity him. Didn't want to see the downturn of his face as soon as he felt them beneath his touch.
He brought his hands to his ears, wishing to block the sound away. This was too painful, this was even more painful than what he felt like before taking the pills. An irrational fear took hold of him. He realized he wasn't shivering because he was cold, he wasn't that cold anymore, he was
“Now people will definitely talk”.
hospital
Lestrade sighed. "Fine. I'll give you the details later. You should get some rest, you don't look well."
"I'll bet you are. Take your word on it…" John muttered, his eyes still shut.
Whatever the reason, John moved on into the crowd, following after Sherlock and not knowing whether to tell him or not.
"When am I not?" John replied with a pained grin.
Sherlock finds what he was looking for, a glass mixing bowl, and shoots his brother a glare before turning the tap on and filling the bowl full of water.
She stands loudly, striding out of the dining room and leaving the faceless little lackey to clean up her mess.
Smoke breathed out from bloody lips. Dark eyes turned upward.
"You know I wasn't talking about Sheol."
John let out a ghost of a laugh. “I don’t feel strong right now. I wouldn’t have then, either. When the bond’s shut off, you assume the worst. I would’ve come here, months too late, and found out what happened to you. And you know what I would’ve done? I would have followed.”
He moves to exit the room, but Sherlock's there first, shutting the door with a long arm.
“I hardly think you’ll become a devout acolyte, Captain.”
In that moment Sherlock's brain swells and shrieks with anger, calling for
He manages to untangle himself from the sheets and sits up, against the side of his bed. Wordlessly, Sherlock joins him.
"If you're not going to let me leave then you can at least acquiesce to going on a walk."
"It's unwise to underestimate an opponent when given contradictory evidence." Sherlock pauses, thinking. Considering. "It is surprising, however."
“You summoned me here. You obviously had something to say.”
!” Harry squealed, leaping off the couch to hug her brother.
The air seemed to swell in the room as John steps forward, putting a hand on Jim's shoulder, which looked small under his palm.
"Yes, because that is the absolute definitive sum of a relationship, whether we're
Sherlock knew instantly what he was talking about, as well as that this was not the incoherent babble of a dream nor the dark dregs of a nightmare. He felt a tinge of jealousy for all the wrong reasons. He had been the one who was going to let John in first, but John, being that brave man that he was, being the soldier, he was beating him to it. But Sherlock's envy passed like dirt swept up in wind as John continued.
There’s a draft of air and his reptile brain stirs in discontent. Sherlock has left.
"Did they die?"
"Do you want anything else?" He asks as Sherlock puts the plate in the sink. "Some pasta, maybe? Or an apple? I think we've got some Thai left—"
Does he want him to come back? He’s not sure. It’s
He leads them into a high vaulted room covered with rustic furniture meant to look hand carved and large rugs printed with Native American designs. A large stone fireplace gapes out at them, big enough to fit a queen sized bed in.
Irene's hand tightened in Orso's hair, yet he made no move to draw himself away. "Yes," she said, eyes narrowing. "Perhaps you should. Maybe John would acquiesce. Or perhaps you should go back to China until you've drowned yourself in all the sorry opium dens this world has to offer. Don't raise your hair like a cat every time the subject of love arises. We're all going to lose those we love most, that's what we've been doing for the past hundred years, it's what we will be doing for the next centuries to come, and John is no different from the rest. The fact that you love him isn't enough to change that. You say I cannot look my existence in the face? I say you're the coward, Sherlock Holmes. We both are. How's that for love?"
John shuts his eyes.
"Her name is Hanne." Sherlock said calmly. "I lodged with her family in Syria. Vacationing Norwegians. With my conversational knowledge of the language, I fit right in. Perhaps a little too well…" He added, eyeing Hanne, who was still red in the face with anger.
He nodded curtly. The largest concern was John – when properly fed normally, he would wake within the next hour. But nearly an entire day, suffering from silver poisoning and an infectious bullet wound, with nothing to eat but wild animal blood and nicks off his mate’s wrist? It was worrying; most would be on the verge of breaking, and many did not make it back from that same precipice. He was surprised Sherlock could still string a sentence together, even with all his mighty faculty, addled by panicked silver.
"John—" Sherlock starts, following him down the hall.
His toe has edged over the line of salt. The seal has been broken.
Lestrade bites his tongue. With the events of the day, everyone is a little high strung. He can let this one pass.
“—so it is some other staining substance you wouldn’t be caught dead in. Jam, possibly, maybe even wine although you abstain in moments of stress because you fear mother’s problem is genetic, or—oh.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Someone hit you and drew blood, didn’t they? You’ve healed overnight, so it was only superficial, and I’m recalling that the print of your shirt is only available in a few neighbourhoods in Stockholm, so perhaps you’ve been here longer than previously thought. You’ve met someone here who was mad at you enough to punch you regardless of the consequence and either ruined multiple shirts or you were caught off-guard by their presence and rescinded a short trip in favour of a longer stay, because you’re attached to this person and you feel responsible—no, you feel guilty, like you owe them something and can only offer more of your time…”
Is not for those men
occasionally, they overlap and meet each other with near-impossible precision and what you hoped would happen actually happened.
"What am I then?" She asked pleasantly.
The man scoffs.
Although, it is a bit of a disappointment, if only because it doesn't technically look like what he'd expect it to.
“Did you know they were here? When I took the case, the client spoke of a rabid hound. Did you think then—”
The cold air nips at his feet and he draws them back under, grazing Sherlock's leg.
“Yeah, exactly. You were right, Sherlock.”
“You…but you didn’t use an alias, you came just after he left. He must have sent you, he must have left you in charge—”
The man smiles through bloodied teeth.
Before he opened his eyes, he knew John was there. John there, with him, where he should be, and he wrapped his arms tighter around him, placing a kiss at the nape of his neck, tasting the faintest trace of delectable iron.
"Oh, yes, that. The serpent is a symbol of expansion of knowledge and the wings represent ascension, so it's about ascending to another existence through knowledge."
As Billy fed, John hobbled towards him. Sherlock could still make out the headlights of his car in the darkened distance; it had been a lifetime since they’d found it, since they’d argued behind the bar, since his biggest problem was Harry knicking blood.
“And so was Jim. But John,” Moran shakes his head. “There’s a Queen-and-Country fellow through and through. Can’t tell if you’re the Queen or Country, though.”
worse in the world."
Sherlock walked into the garden quietly, or as quietly as one could when they knew they could be seen.
was here—Nachash was here, right where you were—”
"Oh come
“I won’t deny that you are right when you say I have something upstairs. I just don’t want to scare you.”
He felt a vibrant, lush sensation in the back of his head and irately shook it away as if dusting a cobweb; he had almost forgotten the feeling, like brushing against velvet warmed in the sun.
"Sherlock?" John asks, and his gaze darts to him. "Are you coming?"
"It's a lot like your blood, in a way. Only it's…not."
Mycroft
Sherlock is asleep.
"Well, Sherlock...you hungry?"
to make it from. It’s truly, in every sense of the word, a monster.”
Their flat is a mess.
Sherlock leaves him murmuring to himself as he heads down the stairs to open the door, a smile plastering itself to his face. He likes ill John. Ill John is interesting, to say the least.
"What game are they trying to get me to play, Mary?" He asked, tossing his bag in a chair by the door and tearing off his cap.
"We'll help you," Sherlock said suddenly, ignoring the immolation that roared over their bond. John would be furious, but if his suspicions were correct it would be something he could perhaps forgive. He was good at that. "Just tell us. Enough stalling."
Harry bangs her head against the wheel in frustration. A woman walking her dog past them jumps as the ground quivers.
John’s changed. Why has he changed, and so noticeably? Sherlock always assumed he’d stay the same. He was supposed to stay the same, ensconced in 221B with Mrs Hudson, drinking his too-bitter tea and reading his tediously predictable books and waiting for him to come back, same as always.
Yet always when I look death in the face,
He stared his great eyes up at John and unflinchingly said "The agency."
“You knew about the web?”
“Yes.” Sherlock says in the hushed darkness. “Everything ends.”
"Yes."
“You’re going to kill the monk. Rasputin.”
“He’s having too much fun with you.” Harry says, her voice calmer than the situation calls for. “You need to calm down. Don’t fear him. He thrives on it.”
"It's alright, I'm a doctor." He said calmly, his cadence practised and measured, and she trusted him through the haze of a drugged stupor and the language barrier. "Here, ease up, that dart really did a number on you." He helped her sit up against the wall. She didn't understand anything he was saying. "Whatever it was though, it was a mild sedative, and you should be right as rain soon enough." He smiled kindly. His eyes were so blue. He really was quite nice.
"He could be a threat to your homeland."
"Mary left you in Bruges because I told her to." Sherlock repeated, his voice as smooth and cold as ice.
"JOHN!"
He steps forward, his chest almost touching John's, who's looking up at him with some unfathomable expression, wide-eyed and endless, too deep for him to peer into and know with certainty what it was; very well, he'll take a guess: love.
“Yes. I was…trying to be kind.”
Mortimer is beside her in an instant, digging into his satchel and producing an old splintered crucifix. Sherlock side-eyes it, but shakes the notion off. His critique of Mortimer’s methods will come another time. If it brings John wholly back to him, he doesn’t care how. He doesn’t care.
“That’s all he’ll be doing.”
"Sherlock—"
"Johnjohnjohn…" Sherlock reached a trembling hand out to roll the doctor over.
“You’ve been feeding him.” He said darkly. Sherlock didn’t answer, and he strode up to his brother, yanking his arm up so he could see the damning marks: two puncture wounds, right at the wrist, unhealed. “You bloody idiot,” he hissed, “do you know what you’ve done?”
“John.” His husband responded, eyes wide in a sallow, pale face. “I thought you were in Pakistan.”
—and now, here in his hands, is John's record of his time in the army.
did he know where they were staying? Why hadn't he rung them up and said he was in town?
he snatches his phone so fast that he nearly sends it flying across the room.
“—but the baby’s all turned around the wrong way. We’ve got to get the forceps out and right it so it can be born out into the world.”
John stepped forward, and for a moment he was worried his mate might drive it straight through Irene's cat-and-cream smile. But he shoved the stake at her flatly and stormed past.
“Yes, I had noticed.”
John's head swam like a boat untethered from its moor as Moran hoisted him up by his shirtfront, sending enough pans and metal trays clattering to the floor to draw Sherlock's attention far more quickly than dragging John into the street. He scrambled for his dropped gun.
Mycroft hears a faint sound, a choked breath, and he knows Sherlock’s realised it. What’s happened.
"No, that's all well and good, but…aren't you disappointed or upset or mad or something? I'd understand if you were, it wasn't the best thing to do, but it was right, I mean, think of all the people that have sat here for god's sake—"
"Hands. On. Your. Fucking. Head."
"Then what is it about? Alchemy?"
Thank you so much to everyone who has stuck with this! I know that there are some silent watchers in the wings, so I'd like to thank you as well, even if you've never reviewed, because you matter just as much and you're giving this story an audience, which is all I wanted. Thanks for making my first post to AO3 so wonderful!
, like when he pulled the arm off Mycroft's Action Man when he was three. John was no doll, he was a man, it couldn't have been that easy, that irreparable, it sounded like lightning cracking in the sky—
"This is how you wanted this parting moment to be?" Sherlock asked finally.
The man took a moment, pausing to think. "Three days," he said at last. "But I've gone without for longer."
Mycroft glanced to the right, a habit he had when he was annoyed, and exhaled heavily.
Sherlock sighs loudly if only to interrupt Lestrade.
He blinks, lets his gaze drop to the wet tile of the floor. Mycroft chooses to see the wetness in his eyes as bathwater.
"I mean you're the only clipper that's not on anything. No drivers, no cigarettes, nothing."
"Well, there's only one consulting detective in the world, so it's not like I have my pick of the field." John smiled and let it fade. "I have to go."
He takes a deep breath of frigid air and continues on, humming as he picks up stray pieces of wood and shaking the snow off. Sasha trots happily beside him, glancing up curiously as he hums.
do that to me again, I'll be sure to kill you myself."
A quick glance through watering eyes proved to Sherlock what he already suspected, that Mikheia had thrown himself through a window by the quickly heating metal stairs, not quite between the first and second floors.
Feathers. He can see feathers loosen from John’s broken wing as they float to the top of the water. John’s face sinks under the surface. There, in the middle of the Serpentine River, it swallows him up like a snake who’s been waiting, jaws open. Like Nachash.
"This is why I don't want
“If this whole flat burned to the ground right now, what is the first thing you would take?”
When he opened them a second later, he was alone.
“I know, but…I feel like I can’t stop. I feel like my descent is accelerating and I can’t do anything to stop it.”
, so he might taste the sweet lightness of epiphany before they were locked away forever.
John moved in exasperation and Hanne's eyes widened, all the fight fleeing her. Both John and Sherlock followed her gaze to where John's gun lay tucked into his waistband with just the hilt peeking out. He had made sure to let his cardigan cover it, but it had been momentarily pushed aside by his arm.
? Sherlock, that’s insane—”
The same could not be said for his mate; as the days went on, he began to notice that Sherlock was content, but not satisfied. He would often join John in his nightly activities, but soon he appeared less and less, wrapping himself in a cloak in the dungeon of the castle, running experiment after experiment late into the morning.
John lands on top of Mikheia, who coughs roughly into the dew-spotted grass, a white fist still clenched around the bloody wrench.
. I have made the terrible faux pas of inviting guests over and making them await our arrival.”
John squeezes his fingers around Sherlock's. Feels him respond.
“We should torch this place.” John said finally. “There’s enough blood spilt here as it is.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes then stood, straightening up to scan the surrounding rooftops.
John groans and Sherlock can tell by the tension in his jaw that he’s biting back pain.
Sherlock’s eyes rake over him for a moment.
I stand, and the ceiling current moves to run beneath my feet.
“Why?”
"But I am."
"It seems that despite your agency's exhaustive intricacies, your skills of coercion still need a bit of work." He said, unable to keep the smirk from his face. "Mikheia was never yours. He will never be yours."
"We're going to need to face this together. I need you at your best. The both of you."
"Nor do you." John's response was curt but muffled, white noise submerged underwater.
, I know you do. Let me go and help him—"
He sheds his coat at his feet and nearly impales himself on the tall iron bars guarding the edge of The Long Water as he vaults over, into the cold shallow water.
She starts the motor and the car rumbles to life. Quickly glancing out into the street, she turns out of the space. As they pass the corner, the man is gone.
“Has it—” Sherlock’s voice cracks and he swallows, water dripping over his mouth. “Has it occurred to you that this is something you can’t fix? With all your bureaucratic clout or your precious connections? That maybe this damage is…irreparable?”
“Semantics.”
Nowhere on the ground, at least.
“I’ll be with you.” John answered firmly, and Sherlock made a concentrated effort to not react, Moriarty’s words echoing through his mind.
A look began to grow on Sherlock’s face as he stared down at him, something at once both amused and tortured, as if he were seeing something he didn’t quite understand, and in that bemusement there was a bitter humor.
“I apologise as well. I am…not in my right mind at the moment. My wife has abandoned me for a
And with ghastly whispers tell
The yakuza will come for him in, oh…an hour and fifteen minutes. They will break the door down, flood his little one room apartment, shove a gun in his face and demand to know where all the money he found went to and where their leader’s body is, and then he’ll smile and joke, perhaps throw a tantrum barb someone’s way, and before they know what’s happened two will be on the ground, one may or may not be dead—their mobility, or lack therof, will not remain so unclear however—and the last will have his own gun pointing at his face, taken right out of his inept hands.
It was a tiny, ramshackle operation, with little organization and less planning; only one man ran the entire counter, with the help of a few native Russians who spoke little English and sorted the mail accordingly; often, he would feel a leap as mail was delivered to him, only to have it be for someone else. He had begun to hate the sight of the horse-drawn carriage as it rode in, bearing sacks of correspondence, parcels, gifts, because at once he craved news from his husband and feared it.
And Irene—Irene could
His heart pounds painfully, his blood starting to feel sluggish, as it grows heavier in his chest.
“Keeping our secrets, are we? What’d you do, John? What deal did you make to get that piece of meat you wanted so badly? You haven’t even bedded him yet. Makes me wonder what was so important about him that you had to forsake all of us, tripping over our bodies in the dark so you could get your cock wet.”
, sir. A white night. The sun doesn't go down for two more hours, if it goes down at all."
"No." He shook his head, idly tracing a pattern above the scar the spear had left over half a millennia ago. It hadn't gone in cleanly. The shaft hadn't been well made, and had splintered with the force of running through John's body, leaving him pinned in the sand to bleed out. It would have taken at least an hour, perhaps longer. He'd have plenty to think about, staring into the blue sky as his life trickled away. The mamluk and the spear were both long disappeared into time, and all that was left of them was the man before him now, still bearing their scars. "You had time for your existential crisis while you were alive. I missed it entirely."
All the air deflates out of Sherlock's lungs like he's been slowly crushed under a ton of rocks and he's just now noticed the weight.
—not to say it wasn't John.
The click of a key. The opening and shutting of a door, and John found himself pressed in the cool darkness between Sherlock and the door.
He stared up at the entrance.
"I'm sure you've realised that I said a lot of things yesterday that I did and didn't mean. It tends to happen when you're not in your right mind."
He rips the knob out of the door in his haste. It swings open, banging against the wall.
"You spoke with her." Sherlock said, and it wasn't a question.
"Correct."
John showers and gets ready for bed, coming out of the bathroom to find Sherlock curled in his chair instead of the detective's own, a book open in his hands as his gaze skims the pages. Something warm and affectionate wells inside him.
“Say something.” I huff finally, bringing an unlit cigarette to my mouth. “Don’t make me read your mind. Still can’t do that, in case you forgot—”
"John." Sherlock moved forward. "John, you're bleeding. Let me help you. I want to help you." He laid a hand on the scar again.
Sherlock's hand was white with strain.
of all people if you can believe that. Moriarty had you all pinned under his thumb, he had people out there ready to kill you, and so I did what I could to ensure that didn't happen. He killed himself to make sure I had no other alternative but to jump. And I did, for you and for everyone."
because I’m not there.”
“If this is where you make a bad metaphor about crocheting, I’m leaving.”
about that, so unnatural about the fact. It was like a fish swimming on dry land, or a head existing without a brain nestled snugly inside. John was meant to be here.
John stopped, letting his hands fall from Sherlock, switching his affections off like a powered-down machine. He stood in that sparse carriage with his messy hair and in his stolen jacket, his thin little thermal, and his pyjamas, and he looked so damn
“Not this time, no.” Sherlock answers solemnly.
“We’ve changed.” He said.
“For what, exactly?”
“What’s a hangover?”
"Are you still treating me like a Cornetto back there?"
“What’d he say, then?”
“Sherlock, don’t you dare turn this on me, alright?” Lestrade says, whirling around to face him. “You know I’m trying my best and if I had any way to sweat him, any chance that it would lead us to John, I would do it.” He pauses, controlling his temper. “Look, I know what John is to you, I heard Moran say it just as clearly as you did, but turning on your friends because you can’t hurt your enemy is
“She was your sister.”
"More or less. I started to believe it was Moriarty almost from the beginning. He does love dramatic gestures."
and it's quite obvious that it belongs to a high-end call girl, one Lily Teague if I'm not mistaken."
"The phrase is 'pull the wool over your eyes', and I am doing no such thing. I don't want a

need gold?" Lestrade questions. "Isn't your family one of those rich blue-blood types with palaces and a hundred servants? Did you sleep in a different bedroom every night?"
“Tedious.” His mate answered, hanging his coat out by the fire to dry.
Sherlock makes a noise of agreement. It's all he can manage. "Mrs Hudson won't be pleased."
Wordlessly, Sherlock shoves himself away from the table and paces the length of the kitchen, hands carding through his hair.
"A home office?"
"Why not?" He opened an eye to look over at him. "Would you want it to be slow?"
"'Tis pride, rank pride, and haughtiness of soul; I think the Romans call it stoicism"
"We are parts of a whole that happen to fit together. We are…incomplete."
Bits of light and consciousness flicker piecemeal into his head. They were leaving, going somewhere, John was laughing and his breath steamed the air and he had shoes this time, and then he wasn’t there, then it was all white, a face full of snow…
He can't fit into the tub with his wings folded as they are, so Sherlock spreads them out, one angling awkwardly against the cold tile of the bathtub and the other stretching out to the sink as he lays John's head against the back of the tub. He's thankful for the weak light because he doesn't think he has the strength to see just how damaged John is. Because of him.
A bracelet? He left a shagged-out and thoroughly calmed Sherlock for a—
“Did you sleep well, sir?” Mikheia asks as he kneels over the bricked hearth, carefully lifting the lid of a metal pitcher of raw milk before wrapping a towel around his hand and hurriedly crossing to the sink as he submerses it in cold water. John turns the memory of teaching him a rushed form of pasteurisation over and a smile tugs at his face. The black mood has passed, and now he stands in a comfy home with a good friend and he is a little bit less lonely than he was before. Small things, he supposes.
Sherlock stares at him silently, his eyes darting over John's face.
"There was someone waiting outside in the front, smoking a fag." John said, answering the unspoken question. "The people they sent were sloppy. They didn't expect us to fight back. He clipped Mikheia, but Mary got him in the throat."
She lit a cigarette.
Sherlock didn't answer. John paused, listening to his steady breathing.
Sherlock had not moved for the entire speech.
And with that Sherlock left, leaving behind a flurry of cold air and a roll of coloured bills.
"Who said it was only Moran?" John asks quietly and Sherlock looks over at him, taking in his intentionally blank expression. He doesn't know if the red on John's cheeks is from fever or something else. "Revenge doesn't have an expiration date, Sherlock."
“How many times will I have to say goodbye?” Sherlock asks quietly.
“He’ll kill me?”
In the center of the canal, a mad rush of gondolas churned in the frenzied water, their drivers battling to turn their rudders as they raced around the bend, shunting into one another as the knocked against the tethered barges likes flies to a horse. Above, people leaned out of their windows, perched on the sills to get a better view. All around were figures cloaked in black, eyes shining from beneath the set white mask of the bauta, the volto, Colombina—anonymity, that generous gift of the carnevale season.
?” Seb replies, borderline panic turning the question into a shriek.
“You said I’m just as observant as you, but I feel I don’t agree at the moment. I need you to tell me what I’m not seeing.”
"What do you want, Mycroft?"
you let go of everything you had
“I—I don’t know—”
"Yes, but you do that every day." Sherlock says solemnly, offering a slightly compunctious smile. "I suspect it's getting rather boring."
"Okay…" John frowns, unsatisfied but willing to overlook such an odd answer. "Why cocaine? Why not—I don't know, pot or acid? Crack? Bath salts?" He adds, upon Sherlock's sour look at being made fun of: "I'm broadening my horizons, Mr. Holmes."
“Would you like to talk about it?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, thinking back on what could possibly have made John so cross, so suddenly. When he came in from work an hour ago he seemed quite peaceful, so something happened between then and now that made him irritable. He had found a human thumb wired to a potato in the fridge before he made dinner, but that wouldn't faze him anymore, much less make him angry. Angry was a word he didn't usually use when he thought of John. John was irritable, annoyed, cranky or upset, but he was never
“While we’re here.”
He scrambled up to his feet, the ground cresting in waves beneath him as his vision cleared and he looked down.
The lift dinged, as if it was irately reminding them that it had other things to do than serve as their hormonally-charged, private broom closet. With something that sounded like a groan, Sherlock pulled John out and into the hall, but didn't anticipate that John, in his enthusiasm, would push back, sending Sherlock into the wall behind them. The hall was silent save for the sound of their gravid kisses and heavy breathing.
The fingers persist, running softly over the base of his neck. Gooseflesh rises, prickling upwards at the intimate touch.
It’s just a flesh wound, thank god. Probably a stray bullet, or a cut from the saw horse. He doesn’t have time for relief. Not now.
John had been right.
Dumbfounded, she watched him go, turning back to her work when she noticed a weight in her pocket. Reaching in, she pulled out a large wad of bills, banded together neatly. Willing her lip not to tremble, she shoved it back in.
The detective frowns, eyes narrowing at what he sees.
"Sorry, what did you say?" Mycroft asked, doubling around.
"Why?"
With a cry of pain, John pitches forward, onto the floor, and lands harshly. Sherlock yanks his hand back as if John is made of fire and he's been burned. Like he's the victim.
or not? You don’t have that power anymore, not since you threw yourself off a building and made me watch. You
“Is London always like this?” Harry asks, face pressed against the windows as she looks out.
"Be that as it may," Sherlock said with a slight grin. "It is not my well-being that I care most for. And you're willingly choosing to stay in Bruges, I can't even imagine your suffering, it's like purgatory-"
"I know enough."
"I do own a spherical object with the world written on it. It's called a globe. I don't know if you've heard of it."
affects you this much.”
“Of course I did,” he repeated, smiling. “You do know what I like.”
But…some part of him feels tainted that a stranger has wandered around the place where he felt truly safe, protected from the outside world. Anything could happen out there in London but nothing could harm him
He didn't feel anything towards the people he killed. Not guilt, not remorse, and certainly not pity. What guilt had they shown when they torched the church and let those kids and their teacher burn alive? What remorse did they have when they kidnapped young children and then left their bodies for their families to find? What pity did they have when they murdered innocent people? If they had the ignominy to not feel any of that, then John would treat them accordingly.
He disappears into the room down the hall. I don’t have the courage to ask myself why he didn’t go upstairs.
"Didn't you ask yourself why they weren't watching you in Novgorod? Why they used tranquilisers?"
He groans, pressing his head against the cool floor. He probably looks fucking crazy but bollocks to that. It feels nice. He already knows that polar swim in the Thames has made him sick. One of the better perks of being medically trained. Self-diagnosis. Early-onset flu, maybe even hypothermia, but it was too early to tell—
, when his thoughts drifted unfiltered to Sherlock.
“You know what I mean.”
“Of course I remember.”
“There are other ways, John. Surely you know that. The bullet was just a failsafe.”
Sherlock stopped his motions, tucking one end of the unfinished dressing in so it wouldn't fall out while he thought.
“We’re going home tomorrow.”
"It's not your life that you need to worry about so much as your mother's and sister's."
He had to know.
"I will never leave you, John." He said it as a fact, as something that could not be disproven, ever. "I have to go talk to Molly."
“Quinn.” Sherlock says in greeting.
got it," John answered. "And if you're willing to pay the price of a man's life for a name, so be it." He reached into his trousers and tossed the gun at him, still warm. "You want it so bad, you can shoot me yourself."
. It’s Russian.”
The hairs on his neck began to rise.
He caught up with him quickly near Manezhnaya Square, the two of them alone in the cobblestoned yard, fountain bubbling weakly in the chilly air, half frozen over.
“Not if I have anything to say about it. Sherlock, do you even take him anywhere?”
So far away and yet you feel so close
“It is done?”
He stares at the door to his bedroom—well clearly
“Was that really called for?” He croaks, opening his eyes in the thick darkness to glare in the direction of his captor.
John looked at him for a moment, surmising. Although he could feel him again, it was from a distance, the way hatchlings shrink into the egg at the first glimpse of sunlight. There was something Sherlock was afraid of, something he was afraid that John would know.
what I want. It is. I don't think I've ever wanted anything more, but—" He stopped, moving his face to rest in the negative space between John's neck and shoulder as he wrapped his arms around John's waist. "But I want this too."
A breath of laughter escapes Sherlock.
! Don't you dare let yourself…leave! Don't go, don't go, don't go—you
"Is that a threat?"
"He could have killed you, tonight. He could have called Moran and told him to get rid of you and he wouldn't even bat an eye, but he
It was his first live kill in over a hundred years. He loved it and he hated it, the struggle between life and death, the will of the creature, the essential fight to eat or be eaten. Rich blood poured into his mouth and spilled down his throat in a hot cascade, salty, metallic, beautiful. The stag was healthy; he could taste it.
John laughs and it is more than a breathy chuckle.  "Yes, Sherlock?"
Sherlock shook his head.  This was just like trying to discuss
"As in, I think you should move back.  With Watson.  And all of your things.  In Baker Street.  With me."
John lowered the paper and let out another sigh, this one more like a heavy huff of breath.
Mycroft had told Greg to give Sherlock two weeks.  He had given Sherlock three and had not heard even a whisper from the man.  Not even a text telling Greg to stop bothering him.  Which meant that Greg was now officially worried.
So here Greg was, at the wrong end of the country and playing peace negotiator between Sherlock and the Hexham constabulary while Sherlock tried to solve a case for a private client, and not a single fishing rod to be seen.
Greg took another few steps closer.  Instinct told him that this man wasn’t going to hurt him, especially if his wrist was actually broken, which Greg was certain it was.
"'s this okay?" he asks.
Between games, I stand up and take a very quiet lap through the cooler living room, to dry off the thin sheen of sweat that has formed on my body from sitting in the not so cool kitchen.  Still, it is a far site better than Baker Street at the moment and for the first time ever, I am glad that John lives all the way out here, in the middle of nowhere, and not at 221 B Baker Street.
“How did no one mention this to me?” He asked, looking out at their guests, waiting patiently in the seats.
The sheets are wonderfully cool against my skin and I let out a little sigh of satisfaction.  Another sigh leaves my mouth when I turn my head and realise the pillows smell of John.  John has such a wonderfull, homey smell.  I could get lost in that smell.  And apparently I do, because it is not until the left side of the sheet is being pulled back that I realise that John has returned.
“Yeah, I noticed he was off.  Has he, you know, started…”
“Not unless you take into account that this one was a Jewish butcher.”
Sherlock was in fact, looking forward to Halloween home, with john, watching old scary movies on the couch.  It would be chilly and John hadn’t had much work lately so, not wanting to up the electricity bill and use the heater but not thinking it cold enough to go through the effort of lighting the fire, he would bring his thick, soft blanket down and they would both
I don't understand.  There used to be one.  I stayed in it on two occasions.  It had a fold out bed and all.
“HOW WOULD YOU KNOW!” John shouted.
“Refused to pay?” Either this was a drug deal gone wrong or a pimp asserting his power over his ‘
), and gave a slow shake of his head.
Greg should know by now to always expect the unexpected when it came to Sherlock Holmes, but that still didn’t prepare him for walking into 221B Baker Street and seeing a stark naked Sherlock bent over his chair with an equally as naked John pounding into him from behind.
'  I'm not sure what he is dreaming about but the grip is actually a bit painful so I gently rub his hand and his grip loosens.  A content sigh leaves his mouth and his whole body relaxes against mine.  A bit too much apparently as in the silence Johns relaxed body lets go and an almighty fart rips through the silence.
“I’m sorry, but, do I know you?  You seem a bit familiar.”
“You could have been wearing gloves.  After all, there were no fingerprints.”
"John?" I ask, because now seems like a good time to see if I can get more from our situation.  John seems very soft and squashy and pliable at the moment.
In his fantasy, Sherlock’s mouth moved in time with Johns hand, his suction increased when Johns grip tightened. A small sound, more desperate than anything else, sounded in the back of Johns throat as he imagined Sherlock humming his own pleasure and it was with that thought, the thought that Sherlock wanted to do this to John, with him, that sent him over the edge. With a muffled cry, John came, warm and spilling over his hand and t-shirt.
Apparently not as asleep as I thought.
“Oh, you know how it goes.  I refused to pay, so they decided to use their fists and feet instead.”
~~~~~~~~~~
In the background, he heard the sounds of Sherlock moving about and eventually, he made his way back into the living room.
“That from the little wifey” The forensic tech taunted and without another word, Sherlock’s face shuttered closed and, tapping a quick reply to whatever message he had, he locked the phone and put it in his pocket.
John has air-conditioning.
’ bit at the end really wasn’t necessary.  Why in the hell would Greg bother contacting him if the bastard wasn’t even in the country?
As brilliant as the man was, Sherlock Holmes, apparently (
“John got home” she said.
A small chuckle leaves Johns mouth and I can feel it travel over my chest.  It is a wonderful feeling that leaves goosebumps in its wake.
Greg thanked the doctor and then made to leave, only to stop again.
If it hadn’t been for the slight twitch he had seen as his torch swept the left hand side of the room, he would have kept moving, mistaking the noise as outside interference.
“Neither can I.  Why do you think I asked you to wear that suit this morning and meet me here?”
"What took you so long to answer" I grouse, pushing my way into Johns flat so he can shut the door.  It wouldn't do for Satan (or his vengeful and cheerfully sadistic bride) to direct all of their hot air into Johns safe haven of euphoric temperatures. "I have been out there, on your doorstep, dying for ages."
“Oh, my god” he said lightly.  “How could I not know that I had been planning my own bloody wedding?”
By the time John got back with Japanese take away (clearly out of revenge for Sherlock ruining the book, as Sherlock didn’t like Japanese food) he still hadn’t thought of anything.
Sherlock let out a sigh and muttered something about wasting time and took off towards the house where the body was waiting.  “I’ll meet you up there, John” he called, impatient.  “Don’t be too long with the formalities.  I know how you get when you’re being friendly.”
“Putting up shelves?” Greg asked, his grin getting bigger.
He was about to ask why when a loud shout came from the other side of the doors.  A very familiar shout.
Deciding that letting John continue to hug me is probably more than a bit not good I start trying to move my legs from under his.  Apparently, this is the wrong thing to do.  John growls, pulls himself closer and then proceeds to drape an arm over my waist.  Fuck. Despite this being one of my deepest fantasies, this is also a right bloody nightmare and not at all how it was supposed to happen.  Well, it wasn't supposed to happen, at least not outside of my mind palace.  And both of us are supposed to be naked.  And there should be more bodily fluids being transferred other than sweat.  And both of us are supposed to be aware of the fact that we are cuddling.  If that what this is.  Is this cuddling?  Maybe John just likes to spread himself over the bed and I just happen to be in the way.
"Yes, John?" I ask again.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Action 3 at prime location. Priority…”
Sherlock was a bit put out.  He liked explaining these things.  When other people got it, it wasn’t  clever, it was just normal.
"John?" I ask and John chuckles, trying to smother his sounds of mirth into my shoulder.
“We are shagging our way across London” Sherlock supplied at the same time John yelled “Can you please get your dog away from my arse.”
“Seriously, more cake” John practically groaned as he spied the plate on the table.
There were hand jobs in the shower, frotting on the couch and mindless rutting in the hallway.  John discovered how glorious Sherlock looked, naked and bent over the kitchen table and Sherlock received the best blow job of his life on the stairwell.  At one stage, it occurred to John that he should be disturbed by the amount of stiff patches on the bed sheets, but then Sherlock distracted him by sticking his tongue in John’s arse and John forgot what a sheet was.
Sherlock + John = Blissful Happiness.
huddle under that for warmth.  If Sherlock played his cards right, he would be able to wriggle his feet under John’s thighs.  Maybe he would forego socks, so his toes were like ice, then he would have an excuse.
Now he just had to get Watson into her bed upstairs, John into their bed and put the rest of that cake to good use.
Sherlock considered this.  Of all the things he would have thought John would have liked, he never would have guessed that something so safe and ugly would be his choice.
at Sherlock, stating that they weren’t even engaged (of course they were - John said yes) was a slight overreaction on John’s behalf.
Greg then told him that he would have to go to the hospital to at least have his arm x-rayed.  At first the man declined, and then, when standing up garnered a pained yelp out of the man, he conceded that it probably wasn’t one of Greg’s most idiotic ideas.  Greg refused to let the barb - one from a junkie he had only just met - bother him and assisted him to the ambulance.

Underneath it is its English counterpart:
"That's not what I'm looking for." Sherlock replies brusquely, continuing his examination. A moment later he straightens, dropping the girl's hand with such tactless carelessness that Lestrade's brow raises. "No, there's nothing here, not a thing—"
"What? No kiss hello?" Moran frowns as he toys with something in his hands. "That's no way to greet an old friend."
He would kill John one day, when he was ready to watch Sherlock burn, but until then he was going to have some fun. He would never let Sherlock forget that every time John went out, he would meet another Moran, another bug caught in Moriarty's web, and Sherlock would know that, with each meeting, John took one more step closer to his own death until finally it was Moriarty himself sitting across from him, ready to kill him, ready to make them both suffer.
"I meant personality-wise."
It made enough sense, even if John had only remembered being taken. He remembers the smile that grew on his face as he typed a reply to Sherlock, along with the bubbling excitement that what they’d been waiting for to break them out of that weird orbit they’d been in around each other for weeks was about to happen—Sherlock was going to come home and John was going to tell him he loved him too, the mad genius, and then they’d have the shag to end all shags and they could finally just be
“Does it really matter?” John asks with a shrug.
“Mine? Whatever for? I know I’m not the only theologist in London, and certainly

The night before my fall, I knew the iniquity of my city was going to be destroyed. Me, the machine, I knew. Of course I knew. Machines function at a higher processing rate than most people. I let John call me those things, I let him say those words, because I knew him angry was far more bearable than him wrecked, or him dead. I would let him do anything, I would let him destroy me, if it meant it was me and not him. I accepted my chemical defectiveness long ago. I can admit it now. I know who I was, and I know the worth of that man to John.
“Sherlock.” John said lowly, and he forced himself to look where John had focused his attention: the white figure, unseen by mortal eyes as it skirted the walls like a crawling bug over the meandering, intoxicated crowd, no more aware of the danger than they currently were of their own feet, judging by the state of them. It disappeared into a narrow alley and they darted over, standing side by side at the lip of the darkness.
"I told you, Sherlock Holmes!" Emma calls happily as Lestrade and another officer haul her away. "I told you I would take your heart!"
John pushed and he pulled. John's exhale was his inhale, heavy and desperate as they grinded against each other, moved with each other like they should always have belonged that way and they were just now realising it.
He presses play and holds the phone up to his ear, as though he hadn’t memorised it long ago, as though he could pretend it just happened.
John has been unfailingly quiet.
*     *     *     *     *
Azazel floats across from him, arms crossed.
The situation he’d found himself in now was different; this time, he had only himself to worry about. He knew his limits, his knew this kind of pain, and knew it well. He had someone to get back to after all this was said and done.
"I'm still sorry. I promised you I'd get back alive."
He stepped over some of the night's latest casualties, propped against whatever wall they happened to fall against as they descended into a heavy, drunken sleep. They would wake in a few hours, when the sun came overhead, breath smelling of sour wine, which had done nothing but worsen their thirst.
Mycroft can see the suspicion blooming into a fragile realisation.
"Well, you two make a right pair, don't you?" John asked with no mirth in his voice, only an acidic sharpness. "The Holmes Brothers: helping the helpless, but only if it's convenient. The slogan just writes itself—"
"Not particularly. I try not to eat while I'm working."
“You told me you’ve been through this before.” Sherlock says, poking about his plate with the edge of his fork.
“I made it a point in my line of work to be attentive to detail, so allow me to share with you what I’ve found. To begin with, your flat is far too nice for a graduate student, even one of your age and skill, to afford, especially in this part of London, so you must have come by it through an inheritance or you have another line of work. I’d already deduced that you and I were of the same breed: we have various experiments lying about, we work best alone—I believe you referred to me as singular? a phrase which struck me as rather odd until I remembered that individuals, upon meeting someone new, will often project aspects of themselves onto the other in conversation in order to test the waters so to speak and see how well that projection is received—and we also share a taste for Vincent-Girardin montrachet wine, which often runs around 250 quid a bottle, and I do so appreciate your generosity in pouring me a glass, really you could have offered me a chardonnay worth £5 from the corner shop and I’d never know the difference, but you do have a habit of leaving both your bottle’s label showing and a guest unattended with a phone that has working Internet. As to the monetary element, you allowed me enough time to get a good look at the photos in your hallway, or lack thereof as you only have framed certificates, odd for a man of your age to have no pictures of sentimental value, isn’t it? But upon closer inspection—and, as a constructive criticism, you really must open your wine faster and keep your guests within eyesight more frequently—I realised that many of the certificates were out of date, at least in context with your age. Were you really a graduate of the class of 1923 at Cambridge? Obviously the presence of the framed items are to give the appearance of normality, yet aren’t supposed to be scrutinised so closely, so there’s no sentimental value to you, and the lack of personal pictures rules out inheritance. Surely, if Aunt Helen loved you so much to give you a house and enough to pay for rent and expensive wine, you’d have a picture somewhere. I must infer, then, that either you have no close relations or that you look astoundingly good for a man who is about to become a centenarian.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the sitting room.
Kita holds her head in her hands, looking quite bored with the shivering creature across the table.
As he prepares himself to open the door, he already knows what he’s going to do.
"St. Bart's." He said, holding up his thumb. "And Leipzig." Extended his long forefinger against John's flushed, damp skin. He let John run a hand through his slightly wet hair. "I can't lose you again." He admitted quietly. "Not when I just found you. Not when you came back into my life like you could hear those thoughts I'd had between waking and sleeping, when I wished for nothing else but you."
, John. I'm sure you know by now how useful your opinion is to me."
“So we agree, then.” Sherlock says, pursing his lips to keep the grin from emerging.
"A key?"
“Only when necessary. It’s
And he: "They are among the blacker souls;
, I called him, I just don’t remember what he said is all.”
John gave a sigh then resumed eating.
"Everything that could ever happen because of my actions look like streets, at least to me. I know which ones are smoothest, that will take me where I want to go, and I know which ones are full of potholes that stop in a dead end. But those are only the clearest ones, the simplest decisions. There are some situations where I have to choose immediately and everything is a giant blur, like watching cars rush down the highway. Some paths feel better than others in the moment, but that doesn't always mean they're the right ones."
He’d said he thought Sherlock belonged in Vienna but his logic was flawed; he belonged wherever John was, as John did with him, but he had no means with which to convince him. There no war to be fought and won in love, no battlefield to claim, no dead to bury. John would win no glory, no medals, no commendations, for loving him. He would only ever earn that love in return, which was less of a reward than it was a reflex, something that was expected. He needed to be challenged. This, at present, was what he needed to grow past the ceiling that had been lowering down on him since Norway.
He nods his departure to him and stars to walk away.
Outside, the night descends into a new day, following the same path it always has. The traffic of London filters through the window, frosted over with dew, as it always has.
Sherlock smiled, watching him disappear into the crowd. John was well-suited to the task, possessing certain charms that he lacked, gregarious when it suited him, friendly without seeming disingenuous. The perfect complement, his equal, perhaps not in sheer intellect, but in other ways. Though he might not admit it, John was smarter than he in some areas; moral fortitude; self-control; matters of the heart.
“Does
"Told him to sod off. I felt bad about it at the time, but that's what he gets for asking me when I'm getting antiseptic poured on my back by a doctor who was having trouble with English…I feel better about it now, though."
There was still a chance that it wouldn’t work. Many of their kind had died for less. John had been shot through and poisoned; Sherlock had been stabbed deeply near a major artery. Animal blood was a meal substitute, not as sustaining as human, not nearly as fully bodied, but it was better than nothing. John would be dead if they had had nothing.
"I also want to meet Stanley." He mutters as he lays his lips against Sherlock's forehead. "And your parents, I suppose, since that's the proper thing to do. But mostly Stanley."
"I wouldn't say that if I were you. I've killed men for less than that."
Not that Sherlock expected it all to be rainbows and sunshine after what had happened, but he wasn’t ready for this.
Graceless
"No. I don't want you to take revenge on him for me."
"Well," John laughed humourlessly. "Then that makes two of us."
, something to pat on the head now and again. And then Irene…”
The room was
, you know I worry.”
Sherlock finds that John is not the only unnatural being wandering around London.
“London was burning then.”
The demon is decidedly
The bullet must have been in his body a short time – perhaps five minutes. The problem at the present moment was both the silver poisoning and the wound itself; the denser the wood, the great the impact, and John was dehydrated, unable to heal, subsisting off the equivalency of scraps, slowly poisoned by the blood churning through him.
"John, you think you were wrong about what, exactly?"
“He live with me,
Guys...I'd just like to say I'm really sorry for this.
Sherlock smiled down at him. "I've been known to write a verse or two in my time."
, before the Golem came back. Before they could catch him again and do god knows what.
There was a start.
“Sherlock,” he said, spitting fur out of his mouth, savoring the loamy, damp taste of wild blood.
The bucket they had propped on the saw horse against the window had toppled over, scattering the light layer of hay they’d placed on top of it. From outside, in the dim light from the lone candle in the barn, it only
"He gave you that?" Sherlock asked, stepping forward.
“They are idiots, John,” Sherlock sighs, shouldering out into the cold night as John follows. “They make everything difficult. I could hire a plane, perhaps. Write my name and location in the sky.”
“What is your name?”
Mycroft said nothing about the tear tracks cutting through the smoke and grime on Sherlock's face, just as he didn't mention the blood on his hands or the blankness of his stare. If life with Sherlock had taught him anything, it was that the most human elements of his brother were best kept unmentioned.
"I don't know. I haven't really been into mutilation to be honest." He says, smiling. "But I suppose if I were to get hurt or sliced up or whatever, the atramentum would take care of it."
"Then it seems I have no other alternative if I want to extract any modicum quiet out of you—" Sherlock paused, turning to Mikheia. "You planned that, didn't you? You were exceedingly loquacious in the hopes that I would become desperate enough to agree to your terms."
Sherlock slowly raises his head. The eye roll is so pronounced it's almost tangible.
His phone rang three times.
"Isn't it?" Sherlock frowned, as if any other conclusion wasn't logically possible.
“Let’s go out,” Harry huffed, throwing herself into the plush armchair. “Let’s bloody go somewhere – come on, you two are like old nans!”
"Tell you what, Holmes." He smiles with red teeth. "You take me to your mate Lestrade, and I'll tell you where Watson is."
Sherlock smiles at John's stricken expression.
Mikheia's gaze snapped to him and a sly smile came on his face.
John shut his eyes. An image of the refrigerator suddenly came to him, culled from the recesses of Sherlock’s thoughts.
Dead, because the killer wanted to be heard. Because they knew how to hide evidence. Because they knew how to hide in plain sight, how to get a date with a man close to the one they wanted, how to laugh and smile and not feel anything at all.
that logic wasn't even a factor anymore, it was something left in the dust as his heart sped away.
Sherlock blinks, brow furrowing in confusion.
John Watson wanted many things at the moment. He wanted to burst inside and see if what he saw was real, he wanted to go pick a fight with whoever was closest so he could get hit, see stars, feel pain, and know this wasn't just a dream like he feared, and he wanted to go back to the hotel and crawl into bed and lay there forever.
Sherlock looks away from Harry and frowns. "Why are you so apprehensive?"
It was as if John had never been here to begin with. It was as if last night had been a dream meant to tide him over before the nightmare struck, some island of peace and bliss that he knew—he
Greg, you magnificent arse." Lestrade growls and Sherlock shrugs.
Somewhere nearby, a frog croaked. Birds roosted on the water, diving for fish and rustling the water from their feathers.
“No,” Lestrade says, shaking his head. “You’re right, Sherlock. I don’t know, but I understand it. If it was Molly, that box of patches would be empty and I’d have alienated everyone that was trying to help me. Don’t be like that, Sherlock. It won’t help you and it certainly won’t do John any good.”
He tries to raise his head, but it won’t agree to the movement.  It’s not as if he can go anywhere; the straps binding his wrists and ankles to his chair make free range of motion difficult. A challenge, really, but not impossible.
John himself had contemplated suicide more than once, not because his life was unbearable but because it was a feasible solution; he only outpaced Sherlock’s logic in that one regard, and when he had told Sherlock rather casually of his past contemplations, his husband’s gaze had snapped to him, wearing a wild expression he didn’t often see, and had grabbed him by the lapels, hauling John right up to his face as he bit out forcefully: “You will
He must have sat there looking at the bullet for longer than he thought, because in the next moment Sherlock was coming in, back from the shopping.
“I asked him to bring me.” John says stonily.
There are no tears.
John is not a particularly violent person, but right now he wants to hurt something. He wants to tear that tiger's goddamn head off.
. Not me. I was wrong. Not me.”
"Yes," The boy answered, pulling a piece of paper from his pocket, "But I was told to keep it at—"
"Sherlock!" John calls, and suddenly Sherlock is no longer annoyed with him.
Sherlock nods.
"There will never be another you. Not for me, at least."
Sherlock never thought angels slept. They weren't human, so why would they need it? John said he liked it. It passed the time when Sherlock was occupied.
“If you must know: I had a note.”
"I'm serious."
couldn't he act on it?
John closed his eyes, feeling the fresh hot blood trickle down his back, feeling the cold sweat break out, feeling his eyes clenching shut underneath the blindfold, feeling the abject terror that he might never see Sherlock, even though he had just found him again. Despite the numbing pain that ate away at him, that tore his skin to raw pulp, he'd felt a sense of happiness. Happiness, because at least Sherlock and Mikheia had made it to Leipzig. At least they were safe, where these fuckers couldn't get to them. If John were to die, let it be so Sherlock could live.
A large, calloused hand grabs him under the arm and hauls him to his feet, but something’s wrong. He feels as if he’s standing on a wave, the ground churning beneath him like he will never have steady footing, like he is constantly in a state of losing his balance, stepping down on that imagined stair into nothingness.
Bits of light and consciousness flicker piecemeal into his head. They were leaving, going somewhere, John was laughing and his breath steamed the air and he had shoes this time, and then he wasn’t there, then it was all white, a face full of snow…
and demand that Sherlock teach him before he was distracted by hot food.
His love.
has wedged itself to the point where there's no dislodging it and Sherlock would much rather it stay there than take it back. He draws back and kisses John's forehead, his temple, his eyelids and the philtral dimple between his perfect mouth and his perfect nose. He gets gritty wet sand in his mouth, but what does that matter? The phrase
“I want to
"Don't I know it." Sherlock smiled his 'please-do-what-I-say-look-at-all-this-charm' grin. "You know the inside of the Kremlin well, then?"
Sherlock leans back to look into the parlour. Empty and quiet, dust filtering through the weak light.
His knees give out as he reaches the stoop of 221. He can't bring himself to move off the ground, his knees coming to his chest as his arms wrap around them. They're his once more. His heart lurches.
"Nothing, John."
It will all be okay.
That didn't stop him from caring. Was that what caring was, that obsessive need to protect Jim? To be around him at all times, watching the intelligence flicker behind dark eyes? To invest himself in the existence of another? He didn't know.
He cracked them open and nearly cursed at the light that spilled in. Was it possible to hate inanimate objects? John discovered that no, it was not.
“I didn’t die. I’m still here, Sherlock.” John rises, moving carefully as one does with cornered animals. “Hey, look at me. Look at me.” He takes Sherlock’s hands away, holding his cheek in the other.
“I’m not too concerned with that, darling. I’m stuck with you, and you with me.”
He looked up as John came in, eyes sweeping over him and collecting whatever data that was useful to him, knowing John's circumstances, his motives for coming, and his future the moment he sat down.
John looks up at him, brows knitted in the expression he uses when Sherlock says something unconventional.
“I—well, I went there for Rachel. I wanted…I’d heard something about her. I wanted to see if it was true.”
Sherlock flew down the lawn, dewy grass coating his shoes, before he caught a flash of movement to his right, where the lawn banked off into a private garden lined with trellises and decorative statues, nice to look at in the light, but in darkness turned into looming objects to hide behind.
He turns it, hearing the tumblers click, and pulls the drawer out.
There was already a team swarming the tiny red cabin. He waited until the last of the sunlight disappeared behind the trees then stepped out of the car, glancing around.
"Excessive denial, mostly. I told myself every morning that you would come through that door and every night I said 'Well, maybe tomorrow'." John looked away, a smile coming to his face. "And then you did. Well, not through the door, exactly, but you know what I mean."
He closes his eyes.
“Okay, that’s it—” Harry sighs angrily, spinning the wheel wildly before they come to rest in a perfectly parked parallel space.
, not saving Sherlock. John was not supposed to be firing bullets into people's heads, he was supposed to be patching wounds and taking temperatures and doing anything but this.
“Felix, please. Perhaps one day you might even call me Bébé.”
"I'll stay here with Mary until things blow over. We weren't the ones they were trying to kill this morning. Is there somewhere nearby that you can go to? Somewhere safe?"
Oh my God!"
“No”, Sherlock said, grabbing the charcoal from John’s hands.
"The perfect temperature for having a milkshake" Sherlock said smiling.
smile
Unzipped.
"SHERLOCK HOLMES IS DEAD!", John snapped, losing his patience. The sound reverberated through every corner of the office, and the sound was so deep that the glass of the windows almost vibrated with the volume of John's voice.
“Done!”, he said walking away in order to appreciate it better.
That anticipation was followed by the memory of John’s soft lips against him, claiming his with a raw and deep need, the memory of John’s hands touching his as he guided them towards his cock, the feeling of touching him,
"Morning", Sherlock said, still smiling, his mind providing him the memory of last night.
"No, I'll tell him!" Tom said, sitting up straight. "So... Sarah is throwing a party and she wants us there."
"Best plan ever." John said trying to be sarcastic and hiding his annoyance. "See you later, mate."
“Yes. Hm. I think that’s the right combination, or as close as it might possibly get to be. But you’re the expert.”
Sherlock sighed, but complied. The wound was covered, but John could tell it was starting to heal, for the skin around it was less red and swollen, and it didn't feel hard to the touch. Sherlock hissed however, as soon as John put his fingertips. John withdrew the hand immediately. "Morphine not strong enough?", he asked worryingly.
"Same goes for you. Please don't tell him anything. Goodbye." He ran towards the classroom.
"This will be fun." She said with a small smile. "I'd love to see the nerd hating
"Did you bring the whole British government to search for her in my apartment?"
He palmed John's hard cock over his pants and they couldn't stop kissing, wouldn't stop kissing. There was no turning away from this and right at the moment, Sherlock couldn't care less.
Sherlock froze right in place. He needed to focus. He knew he had heard the clinic's name before, and he was certain he had stored some information about it in his mind palace. He closed his eyes but he came up with nothing, he just couldn't
