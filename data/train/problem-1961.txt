John hesitated then walked up to the table.
John glanced away and seemed to be calculating the remaining of the time the two of them would have together. He looked back at James. There was disappointment in John’s eyes and the thought that John would miss him made James feel bolder.
The other ship was in complete disarray. Some of it’s sails were up, some were down and some were tangled in the rigging. The Morstan sailed right across its path, crossing the T. If the Morstan fired again, the ship would be at her mercy.
He wandered out of the dance club and disappeared into the night. Frankie reached for his phone and made the call. Now that Sherlock was out of the club, he wasn’t worried to tell someone where to find him. He wondered if he would get a reward for the information.
The Scotland leaned heavily to the left as the shift abruptly turned in the channel. The ship lumbered to the right and sailed directly at the Morstan. It would be a broadside hit.
“Wait, what about the other contacts in his phone. Family, friends? Why didn’t you try them?”
Tell Me What You Want to Do
“No, not for him. But something he said. If John Watson wasn’t responsible for shooting Magnussen, then who is?”
Frankie smiled for a moment then took another sip.
“I don’t want anything from Sherlock. We are just acquaintances.”
“Oh God, yes!”
“Nothing will stop me. And when I get out of here, we will never be apart again.” John said quietly.
John wanted to deny it but his mouth was too dry to speak. He could feel the sting of tears coming to his eyes. He blinked them away as he held Seb’s gaze.
Sherlock tossed the covers off his legs and exposed himself to John. John froze when he realized Sherlock was completely naked under the covers. John felt a lump swell in his throat and he forced himself to swallow it down.
Mrs. Hudson was standing at the bottom of stairs.
“Personal would be an embarrassment but nothing more. Given what has already been published about politicians I doubt Mycroft could be involved in anything more depraved than what is already out there. As for criminal- everything he does is with government sanction. Even an act of murder would be for ‘Queen and County’. No, the threat is not criminal. Therefore it must be state secrets. Something that if it was released would show Mycroft to be either a threat to England or a traitor to her.” Sherlock rattled off quickly without seeming to think about it.
“How can one person know everything that is going on in an area as large as the Caribbean?”
Sherlock seemed perplexed by John. “You believed me?”
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder. “Obviously working.”
Sebastian Moran stood outside the walls forward base as the sun blazed just above the horizon in the west. This time of year, the Helmand River was a muddy brown smear that laid across the parched earth. It was low but still not at its lowest level. The sound of the evening wind picked up and it was all Moran could hear. The tall thick walls blocked out most of the noise coming from the camp. The wind was a soft hum of the breeze as it blew across the ground before it was swallowed by the sparse vegetation.
Sherlock rushed over and picked John out of the chair and hugged him. He leaned down a placed a kiss on the stunned man’s lips.
“And why would you be willing to give me such a valuable commodity? Surely, you could find a more lucrative buyer of such information?” Magnussen asked.
“No, John, we
“Show me.” Sherlock said.
Mycroft watched as John seemed to pale even more than his sickly appearance. Sherlock’s eyes flashed in anger and he moved to place himself between John and Mycroft.
“Williams, get on the radio! Get us an airstrike!” Moran shouted as John tied the bandage on Seb’s arm. “81 Romeo, Adam one calling 81 Romeo Baker! What the fuck is going on over there?!” Bullets hit the top of the wall and a sharp spray of rocks and dirt hit Moran’s face.
“Several, but if I could suggest?” Moran stepped closer.
The smaller man was leaning back in his chair and studying the contents of his teacup. He seemed to be ignoring the conversation between his associate and Mrs. Holmes.
“Of course he has the good doctor. His attention and focus will be on Johnny Boy and not on what is coming next. The Iceman will lose his right hand man and I will be able to start to dismantle his empire even more.” Jim Moriarty picked up the teacup and blew on the brown liquid before taking a hesitant sip. He hummed in contentment as the tea coated his tongue. “Perfect.”
“No, but someone whom she trusted. Someone who could get close to her and who has some kind of emotional connection to her. She may not have even known about the connection, but it is significant to the killer.” Sherlock rested his head against John’s shoulder as he spoke.
“Charles Augustus Magnussen.”
The muscles around Moriarty’s eyes twitched before he could stop it. Magnussen saw the shift in his micro-expression.
“Because whoever this is . . . knows what he is doing. He won’t be caught on something as simple as a camera.”
He kissed John’s forehead and laid his head down, resting it on top of the omega’s. John would wake soon, then it would all begin again. The need and hunger. But now, Sherlock had a moment of peace and realization that no one, nothing would matter more to Sherlock than the battered army doctor.
An idea slipped into John’s head. He let the water drain away in the sink as he set the last mug in the drying rack. He turned and looked at the dark haired omega. John studied Sherlock for a few moments. The omega was attractive and alluring; even unique but was he really different from any other omega John had slept with. Maybe Sherlock was like any of the dozen omegas he had known and bedded. Sherlock was just like the others he had been with.
“Hide here. No one will look for you here.” John said as he grabbed his pistol.
“Please brother, I just had the carpets cleaned.” Mycroft turned to the door and called out. “Enter.”
“NO.” It came out too fast and too emphatic to be true.
John hummed into his Sherlock’s mouth. He slummed forward into Sherlock’s arms.
“Easy. He chose you over me.” Moriarty said. “Now get dressed. We are going someplace that will require your arse be covered.”
“Sound’s good to me,” Greg Lestrade said as he stood up straight. His sword still in his hand and now pointed at Roylott.
Sherlock’s brain pushed through the fog and started to comprehend what was being said to him. Sherlock shoved the young girl off his lap and stood.
“But I was enjoying being a pirate.” John turned  and looked up into Sherlock’s smiling face.
“One of the snipers was Moran. He saw John with you. You think he saw someone he used to serve with . . . someone who had been important to him. Is it possible that he wants for himself and Moriarty is just as much in the dark as we are?” Mycroft said.
“He’s dead in your hotel suite, sir, and you don’t have any personal connection to him?” Dimmit sounded doubtful.
Sherlock’s index finger moved slowly to draw an outline around John’s filling cock. John hissed and closed his eyes. Listening to the sultry voice of his soon to be bond mate. Sherlock pressed a little closer.
“I don’t know his name but I can give you his description. Eighteen to twenty years old. Tall, fair skinned. Elegant hands with long fingers. Well maintained.”
John leaned into Sherlock’s stomach and breathed in the scent of his lover. It calmed him and reassured him.
Mycroft looked down at his hands, then around the room as he tried to control his anger and bitterness towards Greg. He glanced at Sherlock who was staring into the flames but was surely listening to what he was going to say.
The raised area only had a table and chair. Sherlock’s laptop was placed on the table facing a wall placard with newspaper clippings and printed internet stories. There was a map of London in the center of the collage with stings radiating out to the various clippings.
The call disconnected and John glanced at the clock. It was two in the morning. He looked and saw his sister’s bedroom door was still closed. Her suitcase sat by the front door. For a brief moment he wondered if he should wake her and tell her where he was going. Would she be sober enough to understand what he was telling her? Would she try and leave again? After several minutes of arguing with himself, John decided she needed to sleep. Besides, he needed to get to Sherlock as soon as possible.
The detective waited for John to continue. The silence in the room was broken by the sound of traffic outside. Horns and people talking. The sounds of London. Finally, John spoke.
“He loved you.” Sherlock whispered. Afraid how the words would make him feel. The knowledge that someone else had loved John like he had. That maybe – just maybe, John had loved someone else.
“He told me he was up for a promotion. He was expecting on being stationed in England. But before he would take up his new position, he would have been given a few weeks leave.”
“Gentlemen, things are progressing nicely.” Moriarty said as he turned and looked at the four men assembled there.
~221~
He threw the covers off himself. He rushed to the chair and grabbed his pants. Hopping on one foot he tried to quickly dress.
John unfolded the note and read it.
“Obviously, but we can’t turn this street into a combat zone.”
Standing in the living room was another hotel waiter.
Moran cupped John’s face with his hand. “It’s alright John, you’re with me now. I will be your alpha. I will take care of you.”
Sherlock pouted and tried to glare through one open eyelid. “The pain is about five foot six and blonde.”
“Yes, we were . . . are. We’re not together. I haven’t come back to him.” John said shaking his head.
“My sister said there is a problem with at my flat. A robbery. I need to call and check.” John lied.
The rest of the squad came to where John and Blackwood were. They watched as John poured ‘Quick-clot’ into the wound. Murry asked who had killed the man with the knife, John said he didn’t know.
John smiled broadly and nodded his head. He followed James down into the maze of the communication warren. They walked into major’s quarters and James retrieved the bottle for his duffle bag. He poured the golden-brown liquid into John’s and his mess kit cups. They sat down on camp chairs and savored the ‘illegal' alcohol.
“When I left? He threw me out! He chose to be your sniffer dog and told me to go pound sand.” John snarled.
“Over there!” he pointed.
He lowered Sherlock to the floor, then pushed the man into the wall. Pressing his body close, John returned to kissing Sherlock’s mouth, before dipping down and mouthing at the omega’s long thin neck.
“No, I don’t want a blowjob.” He let a high pitch laugh slip out of himself. “Never thought I would ever say that to you.”
John Watson had the pleasant soreness of hard exercise. His muscles hummed with the strain they had been through. He rubbed his shoulder where he had hit his opponent hard for a tackle. Knocking the other player into the turf and out of the match. John walked loose limbed into the locker room to the jeers and shouts of his rugby teammates. It had been a great game and they had won. The adrenaline was riding high tonight.
“Mister Holmes, I still have questions to ask of you.” Lestrade said.
Sherlock had been watching John as Barr tied off the rope. He had never seen the captain without his shirt on before. He’d never seen John’s tan torso. The curve and dips of muscles under smooth skin. Suddenly the most fascinating thing in the world to Sherlock, was watching a single bead of sweat travel down the centre of John’s chest. Over his sternum and across his flat abdomen, only to disappear in a thatch of pale brown hair below his navel. He suddenly had an overwhelming need to know what that single drop of perspiration would taste like.
“Even a non-lethal GSW would cause you difficulty. Even if you have a physical on call, there is still the annoying neighbors who will be curious about the noise. And the blood trail. And the CCTV cameras showing you carrying my body out of here.” Sherlock was trying to buy time. He knew someone was watching what was going on. Surely, Mycroft’s sniffer dogs had followed him here.
~221~
“Hardly.”
The government man nodded. John stepped around the table and held out his hand to Moran. The blonde alpha looked down at the offered hand then up at the stranger. He took John’s hand and shook it.
Sherlock mind tried to place the man. He remembered the name being mentioned in the small boat as they raced away from Hope and his crew.
“Well, if you don’t want to take me home, then just keep drinking. I won’t be around a drunk.” She snipped back at him.
Sherlock and John come to an understanding and Sherlock solves his first case.
“WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! I’M BONDED TO SHERLOCK!”
Magnussen left. Mycroft sat perfectly still at his desk. He had less than a week to figure out how he could rescue Sherlock from this mad man.
“Just stop the act. I know who you are and why you are here. SO LEAVE! I’m not part of this game Moriarty has with Sherlock. I don’t want to play. Get out and never show your face around me again!”
“What happened?” Sherlock asked.
John cocked his head to the side and lifted the corner of his mouth in a cocky smile. “I’ve been wondering that too.”
“I never beg and the only thing I would ever want from you is your annihilation.” Sherlock stepped forward.
Sherlock turned away from Mycroft. The younger Holmes glared into the fireplace. The cold grates where grey. He kept his face turned away as he struggled to keep the tears at bay. He wouldn’t cry in front of his brother.
“A contact from Kandahar. He was working with opium smugglers from China.”
Sherlock took a step forward. It was that simple. He would just join John. He would go to his alpha. Sherlock took another step forward, then another.
2010 London, England
Sherlock’s hands held John’s face as the alpha’s hands roamed over the omega’s body. John widened his stance and pulled Sherlock tighter into himself. The kiss ended and Sherlock pulled back far enough to focus on John’s eyes.
The Second You Say You’d Like Me Too
“He thought you were being unfaithful.”
John cleared his throat. “He’s not the gift. This is.” He waved James forward.
“John!? John!?” Sherlock shouted.
“I expect nothing less,” Mycroft said as he stood up and left.
“I would think it would be very evident what I was doing, John.”
John wondered what happened to the first soldier who was using the radio. His thoughts went to the worse. He remembered the young soldier’s face. Barely out of his teens. The man had a girlfriend back home. John felt sick.
John stared at the young man for several seconds. “No Sherlock, no drugs."
Captain Greg Lestrade climbed up the ladder onto the deck. A squad of marines followed him with their muskets ready to fire. The pirates stared back at him; bandaged and bruised. Lestrade looked them over then walked up to Blackwood and McMath.
“Hmmm . . .”
“My drug use?” Sherlock sneered.
“Then you should choose a name that is more appealing to your mood.”
“You can not refuse. We are both on the committee. Tonight the recipients for the grants will be announced. We are both expected.”
“Anderson did forensics?” Sherlock asked.
Hesitantly, Sherlock walked up to John. “Good morning, Captain.”
“I am sorry sir, that won’t be possible. She disappeared after speaking to us. Her body was found in an ally just off the main road by the docks.” The government man leaned forward and whispered. “Throat slit. She was oriental, you know.”
“Yes we were. In fact, you meant everything to me, but I guess that wasn’t enough for you. You needed more than I could give and I – well, I’m an idiot too.”
“John, you and I both have seen the results of bondings that went bad. The complications and the . . . abuse.”
“So this is your final plan? Killing us in Mycroft’s home?”
“Look. At. Me.”
McMath brought his hands up and slowly started to massage Sherlock’s shoulders. Using his thumbs he pressed deep into the muscles. Sherlock moaned and pushed back into the pressure. McMath smiled.
“You still have that pistol you used on Hope?” John asked.
“Yes,” she smiled.
“You know it’s right to leave him behind. But you don’t have to be alone. I’m right here.”
“Murder is still my department. There was a shooting down on the docks several weeks ago. Two men were killed that night. Since then there has been two more murders involving men from the same gang.”
He crossed the street and rushed ahead of John to intercept him. He waited at the corner, when John turned and walked right into him.
Greg hesitated again. “He made mistakes.” John didn’t say anything. Greg continued, “Look, it’s good to see you’re back. Let’s go get a pint sometime.”
~221~
“Sherlock, we live in a city of eight million people. It’s going to be impossible to avoid casual contact.”
“Victor was killed by Jim Moriarty and his bodyguard. And they killed Sholto too. Killed him here and you told the police it was John.” Sherlock took a step closer to Frankie.
John opened his eyes to see his imagination slip into reality. Sherlock’s pale shoulders visible and just as inviting. His dark curls messed from sleep. His long limbs only just concealed by the thin cotton sheet.
“Yes. And then drop him off somewhere.” Moriarty thought for a moment. “We have a brothel in France that will take him, don’t we?”
He was not one of the patients the attending was lecturing on and John was about to walk away when he looked at the man’s face again. It was Wilderbrant.
Sherlock felt the pain of the accusation in his chest. How could he tell John the truth? How could he tell the blonde that hurting him was the last thing Sherlock would ever want to do?
John watched as the dark-haired man turned and walked away. John’s eyes lingered on the man’s naked body. Suddenly, John realized he had made a mistake. He looked just a moment too long. His body started to react to the image of the man’s body. The smooth skin taut over muscle and bone. He could feel a stirring a desire bloom inside himself. It was something he could never allow to happen.
~221~
An eloquent smile came to Mycroft’s face. “I have a talented and expedient agent here in London. As soon as the news of my return was released, they made arrangements for my return. My home here has been opened up and prepared for my arrival. As well as new wardrobe waiting for me. My agent has made the arrangements with my tailor.”
“What is this about?” John finally asked. He stood up and marched over to Sherlock, who twisted to confront John. “Is this about you? Are you doing this? You saw that picture and decided to drag James into your little drama?”
“I received a bottle of scotch from an old friend back home. Want to crack the seal with me?” James whispered to John. Alcohol was complete forbidden in Afghanistan, but many soldiers found ways to sneak it in.
Greg looked somberly at John. “As much your fault as the rest of us are to blame.”
As soon as John heard the sound of the air compressor starting up, he moved swiftly. The noise of the compressor drowning out the sound of John coming down the stairs. He made it to the door of the room just as Moran fired the nail gun at the wall.
“Alright, to work everyone. This ship won’t repair itself.” John turned towards his crew. “McMath, I want an accounting of how much powder and ammo we have left. Barr get those rails replaced and ready for sanding. James, how is the canvas?”
“If I want to see naked women, I would have stayed with John.” Sherlock said as he started to circle around the room and exam its contents.
“Let me go.”
Sherlock quickly lifted his head and reached for the phone. He checked the caller ID then answered the call.
“I believe she isn’t too busy to speak to me.” Sherlock walked pass the woman not giving her the opportunity to prevent him.
John tried to sit patiently as he watched the two people joust back and forth. She explained she kept information as well as photos on the phone for her protection. Irene told Sherlock she found something but didn’t know what it meant. Something, people were willing to kill her for.
John caught a glimpse of the man on the top of the building. The grey orb of the moon back lit him. A basic mistake for a soldier to make; to be exposed and visible in the moonlight. But even though it was against everything John had be taught, he stopped and stare at the man. His long thin body tentatively revealed by the wind spreading his coat out and away from him. His black curls blending into the inky dark sky. His pale skin cast even paler by the moonlight. He was remarkable looking. Almost gothic in his beauty.
“The last thing I remember was Jim was injecting me with something he said I would really enjoy. I think it was a speedball.”
Sherlock laughed. “Don’t start acting like you care, Mycroft. Your concern is only to control me. Remember, you are the one who said ‘Caring is not an advantage.’”
“Sherlock, why? How could you tell her that?” John groaned.
John looked up and saw the man lying in the bed. Words choked as John’s throat closed off.
“Frankie’s Backdoor,” said Sherlock as he pulled himself off the wall he was leaning on. He stepped around the desk so he could look into John’s face. “It was a professional hit. He was murdered by someone who knew who he was and was familiar with killing.”
John and James looked at each other. Then John reached out and placed his hand on Sherlock’s forearm.
John was sitting in the car with Sherlock. The engine was running. John pressed the button on the mic. “Alpha two, thank you alpha one. Alpha two out.”
“Mycroft has placed more surveillance in the flat while we were dealing with Adler. They were there for your protection.”
“Boring.”
“Pardon!?” Smith asked dumbfounded.
John sat silently and watched Sherlock. He smiled softly.
The climax rocketed through John’s body. He shouted out Sherlock’s name as he bucked forward into Sherlock’s hand. Coming in his pants like a lovesick teenager. Sherlock held John up against the wall as John’s knees gave out and his mind blanked completely. John shook and shivered as body succumbed to Sherlock’s voice and suggestions.
_________
Jim glanced around the crowded room then saw Sherlock working his way towards him. A smile came to the smaller man’s face as he saw the dark hair twenty year old. The two pushed through the other party goers and slipped up against each other. Jim pushed up onto his toes to speak into Sherlock ears.
“Mark that into your diary, John. Mycroft was not only helpful for once but actually said thank you.”
“Seb, I need you and four of your best people in London in three months. Experts in explosives. I have a project.”
“We were two men who fucked. We didn’t mean any more to each other than that.”
Sherlock groaned as his world shifted sideways. He felt John palming his groin. Sherlock gasped. He didn’t know how aroused he was until he felt the pressure of John’s hand on him. He rested his forehead on John’s and closed his eyes. His attention fixed on the sensation of John’s hand. When he heard the snap of a button being undone and the rasp of a zipper, he forced his eyes open. He needed to watch. His own hands moving rapidly to John’s waistband.
“Maybe this conversation would be more comfortable for everyone if you would like to put some clothes on, John.” The stranger said.
He turned as saw a PC standing near a curtained off area. The PC looked to be in his thirties. His hair was brown but silvery grey streaks were already apparent. The police officer had soft brown eyes that were warm and one would find comfort in them.
“You don’t need to worry about Dimmit and the incident at the Langham.” Lestrade interrupted Mycroft’s thoughts. “We are still investigating, but I sincerely doubt you will be implicated any further. Smith confessed to murdering Victor Trevor. Said it he was ordered by Moriarty to do so. There were other members of Moriarty’s crew there too. They are the ones who . . . um . . . were the ones who . . .”
“He was shot. Sometime around three.” Dimmit said.
“Nothing but quiet.” Sherlock said deadpan.
“That is a very good question.”
John’s face turned red. He took several deep breathes as his lips thinned and the corners of his mouth dipped down.
“Don’t you dare say my own good!” John roared at the man. He glared at Sherlock. “Do you have any idea what I went through when you threw me out? You didn’t give much of a damn for my own good back then. You didn’t seem to care that you were ripping my heart out of me. Did you even miss a night of sleep . . . oh, I forgot. You’re the sociopath who doesn’t sleep. So I guess my departure didn’t even register with you.”
“Mycroft? You think Mycroft was involved?”
“I could kneel if you prefer.”
“I really need to get some things done before I go to sleep.” John turned away.
Lieutenant Colonel Sebastian Moran sat in the first truck leading the convoy to Pakistan border from Kabul. He took his demotion and reassignment without complaint but the anger burned brightly beneath. The former combat officer was now in charge of escorting supplies across the rugged mountain range. The paved road followed the rivers and lakes along the mountains. It was one of the greenest spot along the jagged and desolate road from Peshawar.
“It’s easy to have a high opinion of yourself when you have omegas throwing themselves at you wherever you go.”
Mike and John went and joined Sherlock in the sitting room. Mike sat back down in his chair; the chemistry book resting on the arm of the chair as he balanced his notes on the other.
he thought.
“Yeah, I thought the two of you weren’t speaking to one another.”
“I told him to leave. He needs to get the hell off my ship.” John said.
“Of course.”
“John, I have a trust fund.”
“Where are you going?” John stood up still clutching his phone in his hand.
“Dead.” Greg said.
“I thought . . . How many omegas have you been with?” Sherlock asked a little bolder than before.
“What the . . . bloody hell, what are you doing here?!” John groaned as he saw the man standing in the doorway of his own flat.
“I’m . . . Who are you hiding from?”
Mycroft sat in his chair. His eyes fixed on the thin thumb-drive in the blackmailer’s hand.
Sir Henry’s mouth fell open as Stapleton nodded his head.
Mycroft went into his office and closed the door. He paused as he the thought about Culverton Smith. He remember meeting the man several weeks ago with Elizabeth. He remembered Elizabeth didn’t trust him. He wondered if the world could be that lazy.
“Good, then I will be rid of him. Maybe I will be rid of my meddlesome family too. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? The two of us free and on our own!”
“I am Dr. Watson’s solicitor. You are prohibited from speaking to him again unless I am present.” The woman said as she removed a card from her jacket pocket and passed it to John. He took it and read the embossed name on the it. Isabella Chatwells.
“Everything points to Moriarty as being the boss and you were just a bar owner that was selling a little coke on the side.” John continued. “You should have left when you said you were leaving.” John said quietly. “You should have run.”
“The baby . . . I need to get to hospital now!”
“I was right! I was right!” Sherlock was dancing around the front room of their flat.
“John’s ordered we take powder and supplies from the Scotland. We’ll leave their cannons in place. So this won’t be a very profitable victory this time.” Blackwood criticized.
Sherlock felt a wave of anger bite into him. “John is not stupid. He is . . .”
Sherlock slowly pulled back for the desk he had been leaning over. He could feel the ice slipping around his heart.
“Wiggins, do you have it?”
John looked at the name. He frowned. “It’s Lestrade.”
John rubbed the back of his gold watch. He turned it and looked at the open face. Suddenly he felt guilty.
“It would hurt him more if he had to live knowing he was to blame for all of this. You know . . . conscious and everything.” Moran said in hope it would convince Jim to leave John alone.
“Sherlock, I can’t leave the risotto right now. Can you come in here and talk to me?”
“Careful Charlie. You shouldn’t speak about things you do not know about.”
“Never, John.”
“No, someone far more valuable to me. My assistant.”
2010 London, England
“Boot’n out homeless. This is a popular place for them to kip.” Wright said as he turned on his torch and moved into a darker part of the building.
John looked like he had been slapped. His stomach did a flip and he felt he might vomit his tea.
The rain fell and the field became a slick muddy pitch. The men continued. Sliding and grabbing each other as they chased and tackled each other. When the game was over, the men were better for it. James walked up and wrapped his arm over John’s shoulder.
Mike didn’t notice and took her hand and shook it enthusiastically. He then turned to John and smiled.
Mycroft leaned back as if he had been physically slapped. His eyes jumped to John. He saw the stern and fixed expression on the alpha’s face. He thought if he pushed it further, the alpha would attack him. Mycroft tipped his head down again and showed his neck to John. Submitting when he would prefer to control.
“Sebby!?”
James leaned forward and kissed John’s forehead, but John didn’t respond to it. Slowly, he kissed John’s cheek then moved to John’s mouth.
He approached her bed and stood over her.
“I don’t see why,” Sherlock began to argue.
“Dropped. Insufficient evidence and since you refused to press charges, he is free.”
Sherlock glanced away from the insanity that he saw in the man’s eyes. For a moment Sherlock wonder if it had always been there but he had been too distracted by the drugs to notice it before. Or had the twelve hours Jocko had beaten and tortured the man cause the fissure to open up in Jim Moriarty’s soul and allowed the monster to escape.
“What do you need from me?”
No one who knew John before he joined the army attended his graduation ceremony. No one who knew him as a civilian congratulated him on his success. He kept telling himself he didn’t care.
The morning after Harry had left, John went to the cabinet where they kept the jar for their rent money. It was empty. John could feel his stomach twist. Apparently, Harry had used the money for one last splurge before she abandoned him. It would have been bad enough that John had no money to pay for this month’s rent, but the bigger problem was they hadn’t been able to pay last month’s rent either. John was now two months in the rears and he wondered how long it would take his landlord to toss him out on his arse. Toss both him and Sherlock out.
“You.”
“I’m here to arrest him.” Greg said seriously. “There was a shooting down in Dockland four days ago. Witnesses claim they saw Sherlock there.”
John replied.
John disappeared back into the smoke. The yellow glow grew and now smoke was coming out of several windows of the building.
“What?” John blinked at Sherlock.
” He whispered.
“Yes.”
“What question?” John shouted back.
“No,” John said.
“Wait . . . where have you been?” John tried to concentrate as he pushed Sherlock back with his chest.
“Packing.”
“The landlord came by yesterday.”
John turned too. “So you ran repeatedly into his fist, Sherlock? You purposely broke your wrist? You throttled yourself?”
2017       John walked back across London from Euston Street. He knew he needed to calm down after meeting with Sherlock. He was furious. He wanted to punch the dark haired man in the face. Why did the man constantly think he needed to come to rescue John? John was a soldier. He fought for his nation. He had seen more depravity and death than even the poncey Sherlock Holmes. He could take care of himself. He didn’t need Sherlock. He didn’t need anyone. He would be his own hero.
“Not going to happen.”
Smith smiled back. He was looking forward to visiting Lady Smallwood in hospital.
“Not every ship’s going to be a gold ship, George.” Cullen said. He pulled himself up a rope and back onto the deck of the Scotland.
Sherlock wrapped his arms tightly around his chest and rolled over onto his side. He could hear Mycroft’s voice plaguing him in his head. ‘
“You should never attempt to see him or speak to him again.”
“Leave me alone, Sherlock. I don’t want to talk any more tonight.” John’s voice was muffled.
The dark haired man didn’t respond to John’s voice. John struggled but he got Sherlock up and into the bathroom. He filled the bathtub with tepid water and got Sherlock undressed. Sherlock woke up as John lowered him into the water. The dark haired man cursed and lashed out, but John was surprising strong. He was able to keep Sherlock in the tub and soon the addict was calming down.
“Sherlock, you don’t understand. You are so naïve.” Mycroft said as he pulled his shoulders back to appear taller and more in control.
“He was trying to kidnap John.” Sherlock said. “He shot me so I wouldn’t stop him.”
“I do.”
Sherlock’s body jerked from John’s touch. Sherlock’s eyes scanned over John’s face and honesty he saw there.
Sholto laughed out loud. It was deep and boisterous laugh that drew the attention of the other customers.
“I need – I need to work.”
Sherlock woke up in the forecastle. He had finally fallen asleep in the early hours while the rest of the ship was silent. His head was resting on his arms, folded across the table where he had been working. In front of him was John’s watch. He had finished it in the early morning hours. Now the sun was shining through the window fully. It had to mid-morning or earlier afternoon.
“WHO!?”
“John?”
Moran wanted nothing more than to put a bullet hole right between the man’s eyes, but Moriarty had insisted that Magnussen was a valuable asset. Moran forced himself to hold his hands at his sides while Jim spoke to the freak.
Smoke covered over the deck as he walked up to Holmes. The screams of the dying were fading into the background as his mind focused on Sherlock Holmes. He leveled the muzzle at the man’s head.
“I know you’ve read it.” He said not looking up at her. “Give me your impression.”
“Will I enjoy it?” Sebastian Moran asked.
“I would prefer to starve.” He said calmly.
“Do you have to ask?”
“You need to lay down before you fall down.” John said trying to sound light and unburdened.
“Schistosomiasis? Caused by the Nile River parasite Schistosoma,” Sherlock said without looking up.
Mycroft could hear not only the dead bolt being turned but also the chain on the door as well. The door opened slightly; the night-chain kept the door from being open further. His mother’s violet eyes became visible in the slight gap between the door and the jamb. She recognized her son and quickly closed the door. Mycroft heard the chain being removed, then the door opened again.
John glanced around before descending the stairs. The area smelled of urine and garbage. Foul and rancid. He grabbed the doorknob. It was cool in his palm and slightly slippery. He twisted it but the knob didn’t turn.
“He was whipped.”
He pressed the doorbell for 221B. The doorbell chimed and the older woman answered the door again.
“You don’t expect me to honestly believe that.”
“Are we friends?” Mycroft asked raising an eyebrow.
“Looky, looky, sleep’n beauty is finally awake.” The voice was definitely English. Maybe Liverpool.
Moran watch through the scope as a red cloud of blood and brain matter sprayed out behind the woman’s head. She slumped forward and fell out of his view.
“Is the ship sinking fast?” Sherlock asked.
In the morning he returned to the flat. His suitcase was packed and sitting in the hallway. Sherlock was gone and Mrs. Hudson was crying.
The hairs on the back of neck were standing up at full attention. His eyes shifted to the left and right as he looked into the faces of the people walking with him. They weren’t looking at John. They didn’t seem to notice him. But something was off.
Sherlock sighed and looked back at the fire. “We are fools, Mycroft.”
The doctor winked and stepped away from the injured man. Moran watched amazed as the smaller omega moved from gurney to gurney in the triage unit, and ordered his staff around. The captain quickly assessed each patient and determined their treatment before moving on to the next one. Moran knew that omegas were now fully intergraded into the army but he had never known one to be so fearless and intelligent. The injured men . . . mostly alphas . . . moaned and cursed, their anger and fear made the triage area a heavy soup of pheromones. Even Moran was having difficulty remaining calm in the haze of competing scents. He would have thought most omegas would be cowering in the corners, but the omega doctor ignored the pheromones and treated his patients.
“Deal.”
“Jawn . . .”
“It takes several weeks to cross from England to the Caribbean and back again. Remember, William and Mary only took your throne in a few months ago. The request for Mycroft’s return had to travel five weeks to get to him, then another five weeks for him to return. And I’m sure he didn’t leave right away. Remember, his dear little brother went missing.” The man smiled around the mouthpiece of his pipe. The smoke curled around his head.
“Where is Victor?” Mycroft asked.
“Well, some of the boys want to get a photo.” Greg teased the younger man.
“Why would I be afraid to tell you something?” John tried to look innocent.
“One more time. I never met the man. I didn’t know him. I was at the Langham for my own reasons. They had nothing to do with Moriarty, Victor Trevor or even the Holmes. I saw Sherlock there at the Gala being manhandled by some bastard of an alpha. I intervened and pulled Sherlock away from the man. We ended up in my hotel room later. I wasn’t told to seduce Sherlock. We bonded of our own freewill.”
The attorney cleared his throat. “Ah, sir . . . we have not been able to negotiate with the Black Lotus Tong since the death of General Shan.”
“Then why do you do it?” John asked.
Mycroft is a patient in the hospital.
Magnussen’s ship was tied to the Morstan. Sherlock climbed the railing and jumped over to the other ship. Magnussen followed Sherlock. He stood on the rail for a moment then turned back to John and his men. He reached in his coat and pulled out a small bag. He tossed it over to men.
“His leaving? Mycroft said he left because his secretary was pregnant.” John said remembering the conversation from days before.
“That’s who the killer is.” Sherlock said.
John and his crew were planning on robbing an art exhibit that was going to be displayed in the room the following month. The floor plans they had for the hotel did not have the security improvements for the grand ballroom. John needed to identify the locations of every camera and every motion-detector in the room.
Moran stepped closer positioning himself between Moriarty and John. He reached up and wrapped his arms around Moriarty’s shoulders.
“Where have you been? I mean I got the invitation to your graduation then you just disappeared. Did you ever get to be a surgeon? I thought maybe you immigrated or something. Did you join the army like you wanted to do?”
The dawn was rising over the dark grey mountains as the Humvees drove east. The sky shifted from blue to violet to red as the sun slowly climbed to the tips of the peaks. When the sun cleared the tops of the mountains, the blazing yellow light blinded the men in the vehicles. Sholto put on his dark sunglasses and watched as the scenery changed from the green farmland near the river to the dry high desert to the east of the river.
John kept staring at the medal in the box. Hesitantly he lifted his hand and closed the lid. “I don’t deserve a medal. Not one from the King of England or any country. I didn’t serve my country well.”
“John, to rest of the world, Mycroft Holmes looks like a respective business man with a disreputable brother. Very few know the truth. And those who do, fear for their lives.”
“Yes, sir. The staff has been hired back. The cook has stocked the larder with your favorite foods. A new set of carriage horses will be here tomorrow morning. Your valet is waiting for you in your private quarters. Dinner will be waiting for you after you bath and change into more suitable attire. There are letters on your desk that arrived today for your attention.”
Mycroft hesitated by the doors as he scanned the room for the four individuals he wished to speak to. He immediately saw Lady Elizabeth Smallwood. The elegant woman was dressed in a blue pencil skirt suit of immaculate tailoring. The clean sharp lines of the suit declared understated and very expensive. The soft white drape of her silk blouse both accentuated her throat while limited the appearance of her age.
“You wrote that bloody test?” Mike glanced up from his notes. “No wonder it was so fucking hard!”
“No, yes, no.” Sherlock said.
He glanced at the water. It had to deep enough to allow the big ship to dock here. He tried to determine the distance he needed to swim. At least two hundred feet – maybe more. If Sherlock weren’t shackled he knew he could do it, but with the extra weight and limitation of moment he wasn’t sure.
Moriarty studied the man for a moment. The man was small in stature. No taller than postbox. He had slight oval head with a broad forehead leading upward to a receding hairline. His thinning blond hair was mussed from the man dragging his fingers though its short course strands. He was clean shaven but his pasty skin had red splotches from both fear and excitement. The man wore a tailored white silk shirt, but he had rolled up his sleeves. His dark red braces trapped the white shirt to his sweaty, pudgy, short body. Moriarty thought the man looked more like a troll than a financial tycoon. More of a joke than a serial killer.
“Oh shite.” Bill Murry muttered.
Sherlock watched until St. Thomas was a streak of green above the blue horizon. He went and stood next to John.
He still carried his AR but he had no idea why. The area had been under Allie control for years and no one ever attacked the convoys on this route. Mostly, he had the overwhelming desire to shoot someone. Anyone. He was just waiting for the opportunity to do so. Most men were transferred out of this unit within a few weeks of arriving. Getting the experience of transporting supplies without any of the extreme danger. After a few weeks they would be transferred to more strategic routes. Not Moran. He was here as punishment. Or they had forgotten about him. He remained while other, less competent soldiers, moved on. Moran was going to murder someone soon.
“I say it is and I’m here to buy it.” Sherlock set a thick envelope on the bar before he shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his coat. Moran’s eyes passed over the white envelope but he didn’t reach for it. “Here is your asking price.”
“What is it?” John asked as he slowly started to stroke down Sherlock’s back having smelled the anxiety scent coming off the omega.
“John, I’m sorry. I just thought . . .”
“Well, you’re the closest person I know to a doctor I can question,” Lestrade said as he turned back to John.
2017      John walked steadily down Euston towards the tube station. The foot traffic had lightened as it was past nine am and most of the people were already at work in the various buildings. John tried to not wonder why he had lied to Greg about Sherlock being sick. He didn’t want to think about why it was so easy for him to alibi the man who had crushed his heart so badly a seven years before.
“Why not?”
“Who thinks that?”
“Damn it.” He hissed.
Sherlock felt the stabbing twist in his chest. John, almost naked, holding another alpha. Comforting another alpha. Sherlock gripped his phone tightly. He stared at John bare leg and the visible curve of his hip and flank. No one was to see John naked. No was allowed to know how soft and smooth John’s skin felt.
“Let me guess. This one has Mycroft Holmes’ fingerprints on it and this one has Victor’s.” Sherlock said as he lifted the first bag then the second.
Sherlock didn’t believe in sharing the housekeeping chores. John was forever cleaning up behind Sherlock. And Sherlock never went to the shops. The only food in the flat was what John brought in and cooked himself.
Sherlock laid next to John, both men naked on John’s bed. John’s heat is only a few hours away, so Sherlock had chosen to spend the time mapping out John. Taking his time to enjoy their first moments together before hormones wash over them and they are both lost in the primordial need of heat and rut. Sherlock’s long fingers slowly stroke down the doctor’s body, textually examining every mark, and dip and curve of the omega’s body. John sighed and stretched into Sherlock’s touches. His skin becoming sensitive to the simple touch of the alpha’s finger.
“You told Lestrade I was sick with the flu. You didn’t tell him I had been shot. You lied.”
This is a very dark chapter. Be prepared for graphic description of violence.
Moriarty smiled and removed the blade.
The three men started up the stairs, pushing Sherlock out of the way. Sherlock tried to grab them and hold them back but the last man simply overpowered the younger skinner boy.
“Of course I am. How very idiotically observant of you.” The man tried to take a step back but John didn’t release him. John smiled wolfishly. The previous concerns of the other stranger rapidly disappearing. “If you are planning something nefarious, I should warn you, I am highly skilled at baritsu.”
This building was different from its neighbor. The attic appeared to be completely empty. Even in the darkness, it looked like nothing was being stored in it. The floors were swept and the cobwebs removed.
John leaned forward and lightly kissed Sherlock’s mouth. The dark haired man reached forward and wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders. But before Sherlock could deepen the kiss, John broke it.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “I don’t remember your home being one of my favorite restaurants.”
Mycroft glowered wonder how someone’s ethnicity determined how they would be murdered.
He reached out to grab Sherlock’s arm, but the omega slipped out of his grasp and slid over the bonnet of a car as he chased after the taxi.
~^+^~
John smiled and squeezed Sherlock closer. “Good. Let it rest.”
Sherlock looked up at his brother.
John growled, “Let’m guess. He’s claiming I beat up and raped Wilderbrant!”
“No one told me. I observed.” Sherlock said.
“You should get angry and walk five miles every day.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth curled up teasingly.
The blonde stranger smiled. “Seb.” He shook John’s hand again.
“John, I haven’t said a word. I wouldn’t. I would never say anything.” Sherlock hated how he sounded like he was pleading. He bit the inside of his cheek to stop from saying anything else.
“Well, look’ie there.” Greg said then gave a high pitch whistle.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock agreed knowing full well he had no intention of keeping that promise.
James and John glanced at each other then John returned his attention to Sherlock.
“Good.” Blackwood smiled and nodded his head. He returned his attention back to his men as Sherlock left.
“Don’t presume to tell me what I can and cannot do, Seb. I may decide to keep him for myself.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed to see the grip of a handgun protruding from underneath the man’s jacket. Sherlock quickly looked at the man’s face. It was square and sharp. Skin pulled tight over cheekbones and his forehead. A pale scar, starting in his blonde hairline moved down across his face, through his brow and down to his jaw. His eyes were flat grey and appeared lifeless.
Mycroft was afraid for his brother.
“You can call from the XO’s office before dinner. Five minutes, Watson. But you won’t be allowed to go home.”
“Come along, pretty boy. Dine with me so I can enjoy your presence at my table.”
“I’m afraid that I won’t be able to stay very long today to discuss any . . . new proposals. But if you contact my office, my secretary will make an appointment for you.” Mycroft said as he tried to retrieve his hand back from Smith. The shorter man refused to let go.
“John?”
“I’ve killed people before, Sherlock. I know I can do it again.”
“We did.”
“Whose been talking out the side of their mouth!?”
Sherlock’s wet clothes clung to his body as he shivered. The heavy hammer hit the wedge sitting on top of the manacle’s lock. The vibration sent painful shockwaves up Sherlock’s arm. He winced but didn’t move. The hammer hit the wedge again and the lock broke. The chains fell away from his wrists. His hands were free.
Sherlock lived with his homeless. Eagerly accepted and protected by them. He disappeared and eluded Mycroft’s spies. When he woke up in a crack house, he was surprised by the man he saw. He was still under the spell of the heroin but he could tell it was Greg Lestrade looking at him.
“I learned this mountain climbing in Switzerland.” Sherlock said.
“Sherlock, open your eyes.” The voice commanded softly.
“You don’t sleep with omegas when they want more than just a good time.” Sherlock repeated John’s words back to him.
It had been a week since John had walked out of 221 B. Sherlock was reclining on the couch and staring up at the ceiling. He was still dressed in his pajamas. He had worn the same pajamas for the last four days. He wrapped his silk dressing gown around him like a protective shield. His bare feet propped up on the arm of the sofa. He had taken to sleeping on the couch. He didn’t want to return to his bed.
The car immediately pulled away from the kerb and blended into the traffic.
“But I shot you . . . our bond . . . ?”
Mycroft could hear the fear and confusion in his younger brother’s voice. Suddenly, and for the first time in a long time, Mycroft felt a twinge of emotion. A need to protect his sibling.
“Okay, I’m John.”
The flat was silent except for the sound of John’s feet stomping down the stairs and the opening and closing of the street door. Sherlock sat perfectly still listening. Waiting for John’s return. Hating himself all the more.
“So you didn’t murder anyone?”
“He put you into rehab?” asked John.
Sherlock turned away and opened the door. He walked out closing it behind him. Mycroft tried to read the paper in his hand but he couldn’t. Sherlock’s question kept repeating in his head. Mycroft depressed the intercom button and Anthea answered.
Sherlock stared at John for a moment, then glanced away shrugging his elegant shoulders. He crossed his long legs and carefully placed his hands in his lap.
Sherlock’s attention quickly shifted back to Jim, who was still gripping Sherlock’s hair tight in his fist.
“The number is blocked. Who is that? Is that the murderer?” John asked. Was it the man he was looking for that just called him?
“I’m doing that, but we’re not going to leave you here.”
“Who is that?” asked James.
“Take him into custody. Make sure his solicitor knows where he is. I don’t want this to get fouled up over a technicality.” Lestrade glared at the short pudgy man. Smith’s shoulders slumped as the constable took him into custody.
Sherlock watched as a warm blush came over John’s cheeks. The blue of John’s eyes softened and his expression melted is adoration. Sherlock suddenly wanted to see that expression often on John’s face. He wanted to be the reason John looked that way. He too felt a similar warmth and a need as John.
~221~
“Did you call his brother again?” John asked. He could feel anger at the other Holmes.
The cannons of Castillo San Felipe del Morro bristled out like the spines on a porcupine. Some pointed out at the entrance for the bay of San Juan while others pointed over the waves of the Atlantic. The rough surf of the Atlantic buffered into the rocky coast of Puerto Rico. Up against the old fortress walls of the Spanish settlement. San Juan was one of the oldest cities in the Caribbean. It was more European than any other. The wealth of the New World and the Spanish Conquest had passed through its harbor on its way back to Spain. It was a vibrant and wealthy colony. The perfect place for ‘The Woman’.
“I repeat, you didn’t save me.” Sherlock growled.
Sherlock wasn’t surprised he was so easily recognized. “I’m sure something so . . . pedestrian would be ignored by you. No, on the contrary, I am happy that John found a diversion for a short time.”
Seb smiled and reached for two small shot glasses. He grabbed a bottle that was high on the shelf behind the bar. Pouring two glasses, John noticed it was a bottle of McCallan. He raised an eyebrow. Seb handed one glass to John and lifted the other in salute.
“You’re an omega.” Sherlock said looking down at the envelope in his hand. John wasn’t sure if it was a question or statement.
“You nearly gave me a ‘eart attack! What are you doing down ‘ere?” Frankie’s voice was still shaky.
He kicked his leg through the sodden clothing and slipped it on. John was still naked from the chest up. The muddy water of the river slid down the curves of his muscles and over his tan skin. James stood beside him and watched.
“Sherlock . . .” he held out his hand but Sherlock remained sitting. “I said come here.” Victor tried to sound authoritative, but his words were masked by his hand and his fear of John.
John’s mouth went dry. His stomach did a flip as a surge of want went to his groin. He forgot about the boots in his hands. His eyes moved over Sherlock’s body then back up to the surprised expression on the man’s face. Surprised then withering.
“Second, Moran knows exactly who John is to you and will be using the good doctor to try and influence you and therefore me.”
James eyes darted down to John’s thigh. Then back up to the man’s dead eyes.
“Why would he want you?” James asked.
Sherlock prided himself of being completely aware of every possibility. He was able to determine the outcome of every situation, but John Watson confused the omega completely. The tan soldier with the alluring eyes, never behaved or said what Sherlock expected. Sherlock had been able to rebuke any solicitations of bonding. He had refused to engage in any of the ritualistic dating practices that his mother and brother insisted on. He didn’t need a mate, he didn’t want one. But somehow, he apparently was dating John Watson. And he didn’t find the idea repulsive.
“What?”
Okay, long chapter with big spoilers for SIB. Of course the best dialog is not mine but Moffat's and Gatiss'. (Two of the best fan fiction writers out there.)
“I just want to get the facts straight. You can appreciate that.”
The Enclave was closed. The doors were locked and the windows dark. John didn’t hesitate by the front door. He went around the corner to the back door. The back door had an alarm on it but beside it was a set of steps that led down to another entrance often neglected. Or at least it was when he worked there.
Jim looked confused. “Our deal?”
Victor took one final glance between the three men and then fled the room. His hand still pressed to his bleeding nose.
John blinked his eyes several times. “You don’t want me available.”
Sherlock looked up surprised to see John walking into his flat as if the man lived there. A slight blush came to his pale cheeks. Standing behind Sherlock and leaning over his shoulder was Detective Inspector Lestrade. Both men had been looking at a photo in Sherlock’s hands.
“Your payment.” John growled.
Bridgetown was not London but it was the largest town on the island. It was mixture of cultures. English, French, Spanish and Creole. The town smelled of rich spices and sea. The heavy perfume of the tropical flowers mixed with pong of unwashed sailors.
“I’ll be back, James. Don’t worry. I’ll be back here with you.” He gave a weak smile.
~221~
“Better not. It’ll draw too much attention.” John grabbed his boots.
“Wait, let me understand – if you figure out who was running the criminal network, then Mycroft will quit telling what to do?” asked John.
John took a seat on the front row. Sholto started his briefing, explaining what the squad was going to be doing. It was a simple patrol. The Humvees would take them out to a drop off point and the team would circle around several villages then meet up with the second squad day after tomorrow. No one was listening to him. All eyes were fixed on John.
He hadn’t been on a date since the night he met Sherlock Holmes. He hadn’t wanted to. It had been several weeks now and he still thought often about the proud and strange omega. He wondered if Sherlock was seeing anyone. If the omega was engaged yet. Sherlock was in his mid-twenties. John wondered how the man had stayed unbound for so long. ‘
“Don’t you think that is a bit premature?” Mycroft asked.
John glanced around at what was behind the bar and shrugged. “What ever you recommend.”
“We all knew.” John said coldly.
“I was temporarily incapacitated but I am more than competent now.” Mycroft said as he gave the gun up.
“Do you swear?” Mycroft pushed.
“Why am I only hearing about this now?” Jim asked. His voice was dark and threatening.
“If you don’t want your shoulder dislocated, let go of the omega.” John’s voice was cold and vicious.
Of course the best dialog in these chapters were written by Gatiss and Moffat.
Sherlock didn’t remember the body or that he had called for Lestrade to come. He took a moment to glance at the body stilling lying in the room. He looked over the dead man’s clothes and the floor surrounding him.
Greg was silent for a moment as he thought. “Alright.” He made a decision. “I’m a Detective Inspector now. With that comes some extra perks and responsibilities.”
Moran smiled. “Good. I was hoping you would say that. I’ve already spoken to your XO and he is filling out the paperwork as we speak. And please, call me Seb.”
Sherlock pointed to several short intentional marks on the inside of the cover.
“Your argument was with me. You shouldn’t have included John. Not seven years ago and not now.”
“Not very,” Sherlock said. “John and I were not together when Trevor was shot, but neither one of us shot him.”
“I immediately informed the hospital staff when I arrived. They insisted that she had died of natural causes. Something about the bone marrow from her broken leg causing an embolism. I rejected that conclusion. Therefore, if it is not a natural death, and I sincerely doubt anything about this appears accidental, that leaves homicide, suicide or undetermined as a manner of death. All of which needs to be investigated by the police.” Mycroft stated with his routine mannerisms, but there was still something off in his voice.
“I am the one needing help.” Again another Irish accent. Moran smiled at the man but kept the gun trained on the other three men.
They were below decks on the Mary Mortsan. The first gun deck of two. The ceiling was low on the deck – no more than six and half feet. It was claustrophobic for Sherlock and any man over six foot two inches tall would have to be careful of the cross beams.
The two men were standing on forecastle watching as the sun finally settled into its repose for the night. The gentle wind was rustling Sherlock’s long curls. The skin across his nose had taken on a rose-gold tint. His silver eyes were more pronounced. Sharper and more intense. John couldn’t look away from him.
“Mycroft won’t allow it.” Sherlock sputtered.
“Probably shouldn’t, haven’t eaten today.” John said as his stomach growled.
“Let me guess, you’re here to warn me off of him.”
“Dead? James was shot? What happened? A robbery? Some kind of hate crime?” The words babbled out of John’s mouth.
The call ended and John was left standing at the nurses’ station staring down at the receiver in his hand. John felt a hollow sensation in his chest. A flash of deja’vu came to John. He remember how it hurt when Sherlock told him to leave seven years ago. This wasn’t as bad; by no means as painful, but it was a shadow of the past feelings. The sense of worthlessness. He couldn’t even be bothered to call John himself. John wanted to tell himself it didn’t matter. He didn’t want to hear the man’s voice again. He didn’t want go back to Sherlock. He couldn’t go back. But that didn’t help. There was the fleeting moment when his heart remember how much it loved Sherlock Holmes.
“John, I am not the enemy.” Mycroft said emphatically.
Sherlock stood in the foyer of Mycroft’s home. The younger Holmes was studying the Thomas Gainsborough on the wall. It was to be an oil painting of a distant ancestor. The subject had the same dark wavy curls of Sherlock and the sharp expression of Mycroft. But the individual’s eyes were dark, almost black, like Jim Moriarty’s. Sherlock had seen the painting countless times, but it was only now that he noticed the similarities in it to the three brothers. Inwardly, Sherlock sighed as he acknowledged his failure to notice before. He felt himself stupid for missing something so obvious.
“Yes you can. Just tell them you can’t go. You refuse to go.”
He stepped into the room and glanced around. There was soft music playing in the background, but he didn’t know why. The various conversations was drowning out most of the notes. There was at least a hundred people attending the gala. The men were dress in tuxedos and the women were wearing evening gowns. The cost of extravagant jewelry in the room would put a sizable dent in the NHS debt.
“You’re still too tall, but you taste so good. I can’t stop.” John said as he licked over the scent gland. Brown sugar and the tartness of spiced apples assaulted John’s senses. He pressed his swelling groin into Sherlock’s thigh, as listened to Sherlock moaned. The omega slumping against the wall, submitting to the alpha’s touch.
“No. He never even spoke of him. When Daddy died seven years later, he only listed two children in his will, Sherlock and myself. Sherlock was only fifteen. I doubt he even remembers Daddy being gone for those five years.”
John’s hand remained on Sherlock’s cheeks for several seconds as his eyes moved slowly over the man’s face. His dark curls skimming across the pale forehead. The dark eyebrows over the silver-blue eyes. And his lips. Curved and plumb. John’s eyes rested there on Sherlock’s lips for one then two breaths.
“Sorry, John. He is fine. Transferred out after you left. Got two new recruits in, neither as good as you with an assault rifle let alone a Lupua. We miss you, John.” Moran lied to the man. He couldn’t bring himself to tell John he was no longer in the army. He could never tell John he deserted.
The two men walked down the center of the gun deck when Sherlock glanced out of open gunports.
The blond stranger with grey eyes pulled out a knife and cut Sherlock’s bonds. Sherlock held the groan at bay as he rolled his shoulders. He brought his hands forward and rubbed at the red marks encircling his wrists.
Violet tried to look steadfast as Moriarty stood over her. His black eyes looking down at her with a feral glow to them.
The two men turned and started to walk back into the compound. The sounds from the river fading as they walked behind the sandbag walls protecting the camp.
John’s own mind slipping into its primitive state.
“The other one? Oh, yeah . . . Moriarty, no he hasn’t. A helicopter was seen leaving the building at the time of the raid. It was found outside of Cheltenham. The pilot was dead. Single gunshot wound.”
~221~
“Then three days ago.” Sherlock said indifferently.
“Mycroft, how pleasant to see you.”
Sherlock stared at the officer. John realized that Sherlock hadn’t immediately refused. It made his chest twist.
“Well, it took you bloody long enough to get here.”
John made a muffled sound into his arms.
“We sail east after Magnussen.” John said. His eyes squeezed shut against the growing pain.
“Have these been fingerprinted?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes.” John asked trying to sound unafraid.
“Jim wanted you to commit suicide, you know. He wanted you to be completely and totally disgraced. Your death will be reported as a complication of your drug overdose.” Smith said. His voice taking on an edge of excitement.
~221~
He pressed his cheek into the stock of the rifle and took one deep breath. Looking down the scope he could see into the woman’s flat. The red laser dot was centered on her forehead. He released his breath part way then stopped breathing. A gentle squeeze of the trigger and then the gun pushed back into his shoulder. The report was muted by the suppressor.
It was dark when John and Sherlock left the police station. The taxi drove east with the two men sitting silently in the backseat. The situation felt both familiar and awkward at the same time. John wanted to talk. Wanted to tell Sherlock about James and himself, but he couldn’t. The words wouldn’t form. He didn’t know how to start.
“Would he leave Victor? I mean would that be something that would push the two of them apart?” John asked.
The two men continued to glare at each other.
Greg shifted his weight and ground his pelvis into Mycroft’s. “I think we can go out into the country. I’ll find us a nice open field with tall grass. I’ll take you there and lay down. Let you ride my cock as the sun light warms us.”
“Connections, John.” Sherlock said as he pulled his mobile out of his pocket.
“Is that what you say to yourself to make yourself feel better about Detective Lestrade?” Sherlock finally turned and glared at his brother.
Magnussen turned his watery grey eyes at James Sholto. “I believe we need to encourage the crew to tell us where Holmes is. Once they see their captain bleed, they will be more amenable to producing him.”
“Sherlock, you should have told me he was hurting you,” Mycroft said softly. “I would have done something. I would have made sure it stopped.”
“I don’t need to tell you what to do next. I’m sure you won’t take my advice anyway, but just to let you know . . . John is no longer part of this game. Don’t go looking for him. You won’t find him.”
. My Lady Bracknell was well received.”
“You’re a medical student. Are you now his dealer too?” Mycroft asked as he struggled for a justification for the raid.
John’s hands slipped up under the collar of Sherlock’s dressing grown. He felt the warm naked skin there. John opened his eyes and realized Sherlock was naked under his open robe. His hard cock jutted away from his body towards John. Sherlock’s mouth was all over John. He nipped at John’s jawline and sucked bruises into John’s neck. Sherlock’s hands grabbed the younger man’s wrists and pulled them above John’s head, pinning them there. Then with his free hand he quickly worked on John’s belt and fly.
“Thanks, any time you boys need a place, just call Maggie.”
Mycroft stood up from his chair and stiffly walked till he was behind his desk. He absently adjusted some papers on the blotter then glanced up at the footman.
“The cane? Is that the reason? He was right. You are an idiot.”
“Like?” John asked remember the dildo presently hidden in the bottom drawer of his dresser.
“No, no, no. Nothing so profound.”
John blinked his eyes. “He wants to hurt Sherlock?”
As soon as they were alone, John grabbed Sherlock and pushed him up against the door. He pressed his body into the taller man and reached up to grab the back of Sherlock’s neck. Using his hands, he guided Sherlock’s face down to his for a vicious kiss. Hard and controlling. Sherlock was caught and trapped by the older man. John nipped at his lips and pressed his body into Sherlock’s.
“You better wake up soon so I can yell at you and tell you, you are a bloody idiot.”
The accountant sighed heavily as if a major weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He quickly jotted down the request about US smuggling, relieved he had something to make his boss happy. Deflecting any ire Moriarty might have had against him away.
Culverton Smith looked like he was going to argue again with Moriarty. The taller man sighed and stepped over to the bed. He yanked the pillow out from under the old woman’s head. She gasped and groaned.
Carefully, Sherlock and Blackwood laid John down on the table. Mike immediately went to work. Tearing John’s shirt and exposing the wound.
A third message came in from different number that said he had seen Sherlock with two men get out of the car at
“The character of villain has more to do with perspective, dear brother. I’m sure that in this scenario, Jim would easily see you as the villain and not himself. You are, after all, the one who prevented him from having a normal childhood. From having a family to belong too. As it stands, you are far more villainous than Jim. And as for John, he’s innocent.”
“I think we can all agree that would be best.” Lestrade said as he stood up. “I would hate to have to run a background check on a doctor.”
John huffed out a small laugh. “Odd you would say that.”
“John are you alright?” he asked.
Sherlock tried to remember if he saw someone with a camera. He tried to remember if he had the sensation they were being followed . . . watched. Nothing came to him. He never felt afraid that day, but the threat was genuine and close.
John Watson seemed so plain and boring, but the man was anything but. Shorter than the average alpha, but just as strong. His compact frame and hideous jumpers hid the well-earned muscles of a soldier. Blond hair flecked with grey. Sherlock was certain it had been fairer while John had been deployed. The Afghan sun would have bleached John’s hair to a pale gold. A simple round face that held secrets. The more Sherlock looked at it, the more Sherlock found it interesting and handsome. The compassion and care of a doctor was present in John’s eyes and expression. The wear and burden of a soldier was there in the lines around his eyes and the creases around his mouth. The dichotomy of the two played in Sherlock’s mind. Soldier – doctor. Killer – healer.
The man held the knife out in front of him. He glared at John. His face twisted up into a distorted mask of hate. John shouldered his rifle but the magazine was empty. The bolt was locked back. The trigger wouldn’t even pull. The man shouted and ran forward. He waved the knife side to side as he rushed towards John, squatting on the ground next to the wall.
“Your squad? Why?” John asked suspiciously.
“I saw Joey today.” John began. “He came by the coffee shop. He was surprised I worked there.” John paused expecting Sherlock say something but when the other boy didn’t, John continued. “Well, he told me they are looking for another bartender at the ‘Backdoor’. Joey said the pay is crap but tips are good. I could make twice maybe three times as much there in one night I could make at the coffee shop.”
“Yeah, he’s in here.” John stepped closer but the PC held out his hand and stopped John. “I need to ask you a few questions first."
“I worry about my brother constantly. I would do anything in the world to keep him safe. Therefore I will refuse to allow any consideration of a bonding between you and my brother, Sherlock.”
“John, the odds against you actually knowing someone who has been murdered are quite high. Make that two individuals, the odds increase logarithmically. The odds of having both men murdered with the same weapon and not be connect are astronomical. So we must consider there is a connection. I agree that you are not the connection, but I need more data before I can solve this.”
“And Holmes is your alibi for the time when Sholto was shot?”
“Yes,” John answered meekly.
Greg grabbed the photo from the pile and held it up for John to see. The soldier immediately recognized himself and James in the car they were driving that day.
“I wouldn’t go that far.” Moriarty frowned. “Time to go. I’m sure Mycroft’s face is plaster across the news. Accused of murdering an omega in his hotel room.”
This can be a difficult chapter to get through as it talks about Sherlock and his drug use.
“I don’t know what I would do if something happened to you again.” John whispered. Possessively, he wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist.
Mycroft shook his head trying to clear it. “You must be mistaken. I have been here since midnight and nothing has happened.”
came the reply.
“And the cotton?”
“He shot me!” Smith repeated.
The pain in his arm became sharper and more defined. He looked over and saw the red swollen tissue and the stitches. Mike was presently wiping away a black tar substance. It took John several seconds to recognize the scent of the goo. Ichthammol.
John could feel the warmth coming off of James’ body. It stirred something inside John that had been dormant for many months. Maybe even years.
“No . . . I have other plans for you.”
He waited for Holmes to come down to the crew’s quarters and sneak into the man’s hammock, but Holmes never appeared. He then started to follow Holmes around the ship. McMath had noticed the big burly Henry Barr always standing guard over him. Barr could snap McMath in two if he wanted. McMath thought the big man was interested in nailing ‘silver eyes’ to the bulkhead too. It was okay by him. The two would have to take turns with Holmes.
