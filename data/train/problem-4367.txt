Most of the crowd had been inside, so Cas remained unseen until he sensed a presence behind him.
It definitely helped that it was Christmastime, and the joyful atmosphere in Lebanon was radiating all the way back through the bunker.
“Enough flirting.” Sam groans, as if it was painful to see the two of them constantly orbiting around each other for years. “Are you gonna help or not?”
“Yes, why?”
Sam sighs but he looks patient. “I don't know man, but to me it sounds like you’re trying to get in Cas's pants.”
Cas was back at full strength before he knew it; his wings were perfectly healed and his grace was considerably stronger than it was before. He had also earned a promotion from when he was last revived — a rank surpassing all of the other angels.
Cas pulls away first and Dean reluctantly lets go, his hand still lingering on his shoulder, still leaning into Cas’s personal space. And
Cas was trying to go unnoticed by the Roadhouse, but the bar was lively and crowded to his dismay. He tried to stay away from this side of Heaven — away from any chance of seeing
“Yes.” Cas reddens and shoves his hands in his trenchcoat pocket.
“Now we put presents under the tree, right?” Jack turns towards Sam.
Dean lets out a laugh. “Die Hard? Now that’s a classic. We gotta show Jack that one.”
Cas is distracted, flipping through the channels. An angel of the lord in a man-cave channel surfing, Dean thought he’d never see the day.
Later that day, Dean finds Cas in his den, or ‘Dean’s man cave’ as he tried to get everyone to call it. The name doesn’t stick.
“Hello.” Jack says with a wave of his hand. “I’m here for the ‘Star Wars.’”
“I forgive you, Dean. I trust you.”
Dean lets out a laugh and he walks out of the kitchen, feeling a kick in his step and a flutter in his heart.
“Man am I glad to see you.” Dean grins, his smile reaching the corners of his eyes and the dimples in his cheeks. He lifts a hand to Cas’s cheek and pats him playfully, before bringing his hand back down.
Bobby huffs with his arms crossed. “You’re his best friend. The least you can do is give him the time of day.”
The Empty was loud. Castiel was lulled into an abrupt sleep and soon dragged out of it due to the gut-wrenching screams of dead angels and demons. The entity had no control over the chaos, until a light so bright lit up the shadows and made its way towards Castiel.
You, what — became God once, then survived Purgatory for a year, but you can’t confront your crush because you’re embarrassed?”
Jack nods. “I know that. I can.... feel your love for him. And
“You know.... I-“ Dean swallows thickly. “I listened to what you said. And I- I
The two didn’t require words in order to explain the honest emotions they felt towards one another. Just gazing into each other’s eyes, basking in the presence of one another, and kissing like the world revolved around only them was enough to convey the message.
Cas blinks at him, then continues rolling the dough.
“I’m gonna go get the tree from storage. Cas, give me a hand?” Sam asks, interrupting Dean from his thoughts.
But Cas deserves a romantic confession. It has to be somewhere they can watch the sunset and Dean can reach over, lace his fingers through Cas’s, and tell him that words aren’t even enough to describe the emotions that he has for the angel.
“Jack?” Cas asks, before being pulled into a tight hug.
“Never.” Cas doesn’t hesitate. “I would do it again and again.”
Kelly smiles smugly. “We talk.”
But Cas knew that those were all just fantasies, illusions of his brain that served no purpose than to temporarily humor his desires. Realistically, Dean wanted nothing to do with him anyway. Cas wondered what Dean might think if he were to go down and visit him and Sam. How awkward would it feel to see someone who sacrificed themselves for you, someone who confessed their love and was presumed to be dead, but is actually alive? Cas couldn’t imagine how Dean must feel, and he didn’t want to. He knew it would only hurt him more.
Jack remains quiet.
“Dean.” Cas says as he gazes into his eyes, with his own watering the same way they were the last time they spoke. But this time, there was no danger looming over them, no ruthless God to be destroyed and no ultimate destiny to be fulfilled. It was just Dean and Cas with Sam and Jack, and the family that they found along the way.

Jack peers into the box, and slowly the tinsel and garland and plastic candy canes start floating out of the box and into the hallway, adorning the walls. Miracle leaps out of Dean’s lap and chases the ornaments as if they were one of his toys.
for love advice but ... thanks.”
“Well, anyway, there’s more of this in storage. You think we should bring them out?” Sam suggests.
Dean shoots Cas a cocky grin. “Well I did defeat God and kill Hitler, I think that makes me pretty worthy of an early retirement.”
Cas frowns and

so he keeps his eye contact. And he sees Cas start to tear up.
Dean presses a kiss to Cas’s hairline, so gentle and so loving. He bumps his forehead against Cas’s and kisses his lips gingerly, smiling against the angel’s matching grin. “I love you, Cas.”
But..... there never seems to be the right time. Or, the
“That’s my boy! Now come here, Jack. We got all the time in the world for this marathon.” Dean says.
“Oh man, what is it?” Dean asks, feeling like an excited little kid.
He hears two sets of feet stomping in the dirt and making their way towards him. Cas turns at the touch of his shoulder, and it’s just like seeing him for the first time again.
“I never thought that you...that
Cas glances at him curiously but then focuses his attention back towards the TV. “Oh, found it.” He says in a satisfied tone.
Later, the four of them surround the plastic tree Sam and Cas put up. It’s decorated beautifully with colorful fairy lights and glass ornaments.
Dean says after a moment. “You got it?”
“I think it’s perfect already.” Cas says.
He’s gotta .... Dean’s gotta do something.
“Jack.” Cas waves him over to sit on the couch between him and Sam.
“I am happy.” Cas admits. “Or, happier than I was last time I worked for Heaven, being here just brings back bad memories. But even so, I believe in Jack and his plans to be a hands-off God. He is perfectly balanced with Amara anyway. But last time I was here, I hated myself so much to the point that I thought I… I thought I deserved to die for what I did to my brothers and sisters. But now I’m trying to forgive myself. I’ve finally learned how to love myself. But I still can’t face Dean, not now. I need more time.”
Cas smiles widely back at him, his nose scrunching up, and Dean wants nothing more than to take a picture of him right now. He wants to make Cas laugh more, smile more. And he’s been thinking that he
Cas’s cheeks turn an impossibly darker shade of red. “H-How do you know all that?”
“I know he doesn’t.”
“I’m taking you with me.” Jack exclaims as he pulls away from his father. He shoots him a toothy grin, filled with confidence and pride. “Sam and Dean.... we defeated God. So now we’re going to rebuild Heaven.”
Dean sputters out a response, his lips betraying him as he can’t speak a single word except for “Oh.”
he’s blossoming pink over his cheeks.
“Hey, you got my blessings dude. Just take him out for dinner before you.... you know. Cas deserves to be treated well. He deserves you.”
“Yes.” Cas says, his cheeks glowing. “I’ll go get him. We can watch right now.” And Cas turns to leave, not before pressing a lingering kiss to Dean’s cheek, leaving them both blushing and grinning like two idiots in love.
would be a fan of Star Wars?” Charlie says with a smirk. Dean playfully pushes her as she pretends to fall over.
Cas stares at Dean, whose face is bright and blushing. Dean must’ve been spending too much time outside, though he doubts Jack would’ve made it possible to get sunburned in Heaven.
Cas stares at Jack, adoration seeping into his soft gaze. He was different than when he last saw him. Jack was older and grown, though he still carried that childlike spark he had in his grin.
Cas thinks for a moment before responding. “I believe I am happy. I love my son, I love Sam and Dean, and I’m content just being here.”
And of course Dean loves him back. Of course he wants to tell him.
Cas and Kelly enjoy each other’s company as friends. Most of their time together is spent walking along the beach, hand in hand, talking about Jack. Cas has even told Kelly the occasional story from his days before humanity even existed, although his memory is still hazy from Naomi’s several lobotomies.
Cas stares blankly for a moment, before he tilts his head and a soft expression adorns his face. “You already have me.”
“Are you comfortable?” Dean asks.
He puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder to get his attention and their eyes meet.
“Dean, what are you saying?” Cas looks lost, and a little hurt. Dean wishes he could take away that pain, but there’s only one truth left to say.
They glance at each other and shrug.
“Oh my god.” Sam groans.
“What? W-what’s going on? Nothing. What’s going on with you and Eileen? I mean, no correlation.” Dean says, his eyes shifting side to side. Not smooth at all, he curses in his mind.
Guilt gnaws at Cas’s heart. He speaks in a whisper. “I didn’t think you’d want to see me.”
“Of course, Sam.” Cas follows him into the hallway.
“Hey, Cas.” Sam greets, and Cas turns toward the other Winchester with a smile and nod.
He comes up with a joke to try on his new unsuspecting victim.
Jack buries his head in Cas’s shoulder, holding him in a loving embrace. Cas rubs soothing circles against his back to help calm him down.
His cheeks flush and he looks up at the ceiling. “You got me there!” he says, back in his bravado persona.
Dean’s expression breaks. “You’re my best friend. Of
“Hey, cheating? I don’t have angel mojo like you do to decorate that fast.” Dean complains.
“Mrs. What?”
see Dean yet. He didn’t want to hurt Dean anymore, so he figured that the best thing for him to do was to stay away.
“Oh, uh, just stretching.” Dean says, whistling casually.
Something you can
“Dude, gross,” Sam says, walking into the kitchen.
Dean glances at Cas and then back at the screen, sneakily snaking an arm over his shoulder and tugging him closer. Cas sees the redness dusting over his cheeks and feels his heart soar.
“Sure, Sam.” Cas moves over and Sam joins him.
“I think it’s called an ‘ugly sweater.’ Jody sent it to us. For Miracle!” Jack explains.
Dean huffs and presses his hands against his forehead. “Are you serious? I just kissed you. I don’t kiss all my best friends, you know.”
He squints his eyes, “What are you…?” He shakes his head. “No, there’s no point.”
Dean takes a step closer. “So I uh... I wanted to thank you. For everything. Really, Cas you -“ Dean ducks his head shyly. “You again and again, always looked out for me and Sam. You
“Everything I have done since I’ve fallen from Heaven is because I love you, before I even realized what loving you meant. But to me, it means more than having my wings and more than being in Heaven. I don’t regret sacrificing my life for you, Dean. And I can’t promise you I won’t do it a thousand times more, but I will stay here with you, as long as you’ll have me.”
Jack grins at his father, hope returning to his eyes. With the childish God and the risen angel, Heaven was going to be liberated in the way Cas had always wanted it to be. It was going to be the splitting image of a perfect Heaven for everyone, but especially for Dean.
are you wearing?”
Dean looks over at the angel who’s still staring intently at the screen. He’s perfectly occupied, not like he would notice if Dean were to —
Sam walks up to him and pulls him into a friendly hug. “We missed you, man.” Sam pats him on the back as they pull away.
“Actually, I know a movie we could watch.” Cas has a mischievous smile on his face. “I think you’ll like it. It’s a Christmas one, sort of.”
“With you? For eternity?” Cas’s eyes soften.
Is Dean’s technique that he hadn’t realized he was using until Sam impatiently pointed it out.....
His soul is as bright and beautiful as it was when he first dragged him out of Hell. He carries himself more poised now, with his shoulders confident and more self-assured.
“You can visit him, you know.”
Cas places a hand on his shoulder and squeezes. “Let’s make this place something he’d look forward to.”
He bites his lip and averts his eyes. “You mean ‘like’ as a brother, right?”
Dean’s eyes widen at the sight of him and crinkle softly. He lets out a laugh, a sigh, and pulls Cas in for the tightest hug they’ve ever shared. Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s waist while Dean tugs at the fabric of Cas’s trenchcoat, bringing him even closer. Dean’s fingers gently caress the hair on the back of his head and Cas lets out a soft breath, closing his eyes and breathing in his familiar, woodsy scent — exactly the way he remembers it. They sway slightly.
Cas slowly turns around and shoots him a pained smile. “Jack.” He joins him on the dock.
Dean waves his hands exasperatedly, both of their backs now turned on him. He comes up behind Cas to peer over his shoulder.
“Cas? Cas!”
Dean is so
his real father, to me and to him.”
༶ ༶ ༶
“Let’s begin.” Jack says, and he turns toward Castiel who’s standing by his side.
Dean Winchester was
“Nah, that Hallmark crap? You know they only make those movies to get sales for their cards. Like, are they even trying to make them good? It’s all commercial.” Dean complains.
“You got any better advice then?”
Well, not all the time in the world, as Cas and Jack were still building their perfect Heaven. However, with the other angels in charge of their respective sides of paradise, Heaven had started to seem like a truly orderly place. An orderly place that was different from last time, because now, there is
Dean simply stared at it and pushed the plate away, “He dies a lot, Sammy!"
“Fuck you, Sam, I’m being nice.”
Cas tilted his head to the side and frowned, “I come when you call.”
“Yeah, okay. Go North. Stay low,” Cas replied.
“True but still, all the more reason to not get your ass in this mess.”
“I know,” Cas sighed and ran a hand round his sweat covered neck. “Here-”
The Cab driver asked where they were going and the Regis was first on the route. As they drove closer Dean’s stomach twisted into knots. The miles closed in and the ornate building hovered on the horizon. It held a forbidding a hotel should never have.
“Cas?” A tired voice called from behind him as if right on cue.
“Angel teleporting is always awesome,” Max whispered as he gazed at their surroundings.
‘Cas,’ the whisper was barely audible but he’d heard it, ‘Cas’
“I’m not sure.”
“It’s an angel, Dean… I don’t know where your heads at but I think you’re broken.”
“No, it is… new.”
“Dean!” she flew at him and wrapped him in a hug. Fake coughing to cover her unleashed enthusiasm she stepped back and composed herself. The nod was tight as she spoke, “Welcome back.”
Rolling her eyes Meg ordered a shot of whiskey, “You know what I mean Cas.”
“No, it’s dangerous. She can kill angels, no, maybe heaven will be able to help. I don’t like asking those douche bags but maybe they can help track the cupid down?”
“Meg?”
“Castiel, your human seems unsurprised at my sudden appearance. Is there something you would like to tell me?”
“Did you get any info while you were in there?” Max asked.
The cupid was horrified and began to cry, “Oh no! Is it the same things as last time?”
“All of it?” Dean whispered.
“We’d be dead and still not with the others,” Cas maintained, “We’d be dead and then I’d have to listen to you moan about that too.”
Smiling, Cas walked on, a little taller than a moment ago. He worried and regretted telling Max all the time. He considered simply wiping his memory for good and letting him live a different life but he was too selfish for that. He needed a friend, someone who knew everything about him and Max was that person for him and always would be. They walked the miles and filled them with idle chatter. Max was explaining the finer points of baseball, Cas really didn’t care but Max did and so he listened. They arrived at the village around twilight. Once again they looked like they’d been in the jungle for days. Max moaned at length about the mosquito bites and how it wouldn’t be suspicious at all if he was bite-free.
Then they came. Naomi and two of his other siblings barged into the room shoving Jo away like a pestering fly.
“Wow,” Max gawked.
“Well, that’s neat,” Dean whispered as his ass clenched around the solid piece of flesh tearing him up.
“Look what we have here boys. Dirty little humans taking what isn’t theirs,” A broad-shouldered, mean-looking guy spat, his black eyes focused on their spoils.
The collective sigh of relief from his answer was audible.
“Not possible Dean… Angels hate demons. The only reason they hang in the same bars is to avoid the humans and witches who they hate more.”
“You’ll tell him you’re not marrying the woman of his choice you mean? Or any woman for that matter? When? When will you tell him, Dean?”
“No Dean!” he growled, stubborn as ever.
The voice hissed, “You went into his mind?”
“I think I need to sit,” Sam whispered as he slid to the floor.
“That Dean was chosen to lead as Micheal’s vessel in the war against the demons. A future that will never come true as long as I exist.”
Meg frowned, “Yeah, we did the same. What am I missing?”
“Uri.” The call came over the radio and Cas smiled. It was hugely inappropriate but he couldn’t help it. A smooth, seductive voice wrapped around him, then began throwing orders like popcorn at a drive-through and it never got old. The man on the other end was delicious and it had his mind wondering, “Sir?” he replied.
“There is an Angel pacing on our porch.”
“How old is that thing?”
Cas’ eyes went wide, “What?”
Dean could feel Sam’s breathing becoming laboured under his hands, blood started to leak from his ear. Terror consumed him as the life left his brother and he made what might be considered a reckless decision, “Heal him. I think… he’s… please”
“Just one?” Cas asked, making sure he didn’t want something more gradual.
Cas started to move and the pain returned but now he knew what was coming Dean could relax. He sighed as inch after inch of Cas’ monster dick filled him. Dean shuddered as Cas moaned his name, oh holy god this was amazing.
“Drawer.”
Meg took a swallow of her drink and glared, “And she’s a high-level witch. And she's the most skilled criminal defence lawyer I’ve ever met in my life. She hangs out in a demon bar for god's sake.”
Cas screamed in frustration, “No, you won’t because it’ll never be the right time.”
“Castiel,” Dean whispered.
The packing continued onto pictures. None of them together, only family, friends and Dean started to get scared.
“You sure?”
Jack smiled, “Yeah it’s nice isn’t it?”
“Demon’s and humans like to eat.”
Closing his eyes Cas focused on the man’s mind. Disjointed images flashed but one became more prominent than the others. A door, it was a solid metal door, he focused on the details. A flash, something similar to a warehouse or maybe an electrical building? The location felt far away, across the country, Kansas? A sign appeared and confirmed it, yes Lebanon. “I have it. If I don’t contact you hit on Charlie and get her to scry for me. You still have my feather right?”
The dream changed and Dean was in the city with Sam at his back. They were older now, it was more recent. Cars rushed by and it made the brothers nervous.
Dean shuddered at the implication and Cas’ lips met his once more. It was another brief and tender graze of soft flesh, then it was on.
Cas glanced at his concerned friend, “You know I can’t do that.”
That did it, he swivelled and smiled tightly.
Dean sat back in the chair, “A few months, tops.”
Dean writhed as the pain became worse once more. The curtain moved almost soundlessly but he heard it. He couldn’t open his eyes to see the person who insisted on being his saviour, it bothered him, who was taking him? He knew somewhere inside that this wasn’t good. The voice was eerily familiar though yet Dean didn’t know anyone in the city and so dismissed it. Cool fingers touched his brow and darkness claimed him once more.
“Hey,” Dean said as he walked towards him, closer than he should have. Closer than any normal human would have in any normal situation.
“Cas?”
“We’re Marines damn it, we’re not supposed to just fuck off on random walks Uri.”
Cas raised his eyebrow at the word love, was it love? Something unnatural was definitely at play but their connection couldn’t be denied. Cas tapped his fingers gently on the wood of the table, it made them both pause for a second, another nervous gesture he’d recently acquired, maybe he should make notes, it was getting harder to keep up with the new aspects of his personality.
Frowning, Max refocused, “Right… how do we find this scrolling thing?”
“Shut up Dean,” Cas replied as he forced another inch in.
“Wait, so I’m part of you?” Dean asked, voice, full of both wonder and annoyance.
Three hours later they were in the empty lot next to the bunker with a boosting spell to point an arrow at their cupid. Dean hoped the witch was watching because they'd needed some weird ass ingredients from the gross stuff draw. It was annoying because he was going to have to make Sammy go and replace them. None liked the gross stuff draw, well except jack.
“Dean,” Cas whispers, tugging one hand loose to rest gingerly against the side of Dean’s face. Dean’s eyes slip closed and he holds himself so carefully still, as if afraid that this is all still some illusion, something he cannot accept.
For how much longer, he can’t guarantee, but just for now is good enough.
“Dean was always meant to die,” Chuck says, slowly twisting his wrist. Cas cries out in pain, tucking his head towards his chest, trying and failing to pull away from the pain radiating through every cell. “Even if you hadn’t saved him all those times, he still would have gone out in that stupid blaze of glory he was always glorifying.”
“I know,” he murmurs back, pressing his cheek to Dean’s crown. “I… I didn’t think I would see you again, either.”
Dean’s coming death couldn’t
“Are...are you all right?” Cas says as the pain fades to the background, eyes slipping closed as he rolls his head against Dean’s thigh towards his stomach. Dean barks a laugh, disbelieving, and shifts the hand in his hair to cup his face.
“‘M here,” he rasps. Dean sighs, tipping forward to press their foreheads together.
Cas strains against his bonds, wrists tied much too tightly against the small of his back, eyes never leaving Dean’s too-still form on the floor.
Cas pulls his own hand from Dean’s neck and places it gingerly over Dean’s chest. Dean releases Cas’s coat and latches onto his wrist with a grimace, but within moments the wound is healed and Dean can breathe again.
Dean whimpers into it, because this wasn’t something he thought he could have either, but he can, and he is, and Cas is
Cas exhales, breath rushing out in relief.
“I just,” he starts, voice cutting off, seemingly stuck in his throat. He turns his gaze back down to his hands, facing away from Cas, “I don’t want to...to wake up, and. What if this is all a dream?”
Cas grits his teeth against the pain, rolling over onto his stomach. He clenches his fingers in their binds and squeezes tight as he uses his good leg to push himself across the concrete towards Dean, biting back a cry as his leg is jostled. His brow furrows and he pushes on, refusing to let the pain get in his way.
Dean swallows thickly. Cas stills beneath his hand, eyes wide.
Chuck releases his grip on Cas’s grace. Cas goes limp with a gasp, limbs weak and trembling. Chuck hums.
“You weren’t supposed to leave me, again,” he whispers to the sky, bees bobbing in his peripherals. “I
“No, not—” Dean pauses, sucks in a breath. “I know why you made the deal,” he continues, voice rough. “But how… how could you not
“Dean,” he starts again, “I meant everything I said before the Empty. Do you understand? I love you. That hasn't changed.”
Dean can only nod.
Cas grunts softly in response.
Dean is much too anxious, Cas determines one Sunday afternoon after his return, and he’s not sleeping. While not entirely out of the ordinary, considering...recent events, Cas does not wish to see Dean so run down and jumpy.
_words gone
“If you don't feel the same, that wouldn't change anything,” Cas says, “I still want only the best for you. Will you let me help?”
He pulls back just enough to tangle one hand in the lapel of the trench coat over Cas’s heart, the other cradling Cas’s cheek in his palm, and Dean nearly loses all of his words. He didn't think he’d get to say anything to Cas’s face ever again. Cas's gaze doesn’t waver, the gentle expression nearly sending Dean to his knees, but he forces himself to stay upright.
“You have me,” Dean says, tears welling in his eyes again, his hand winding around to grip the back of Cas’s neck tight. “
"And you'll... you'll stay?" Dean asks, eyes searching Cas's face.
It makes Dean’s skin crawl.
Despite the crack he feels growing between his ribs, it’s impossible to not feel the peace the meadow evokes. Dean sinks to his knees and lets it wash over him. The breeze ghosts across his face like a comforting caress and his breath shudders in his lungs as he collapses back into the grass, tears burning fresh behind his eyelids. The grasses itch as they brush against his cheeks, but he can’t be bothered to move.
His next words out are barely a whisper.
A buzzing catches his attention. He cracks his eyes open and watches warily as a bumble bee bobs it’s way towards him. He stays as still as he can as it lands feather-light on the back of his hand, crawling curiously towards his sleeves. He watches, exhausted, as it crawls up and up and up, too tired to do anything to move it, when it settles against the bloody handprint on Dean’s shoulder, staring up at him. All Dean can do is stare back, hope hesitantly unfurling in his chest. Is this
“I always thought love was destructive. That loving people meant they could only leave. But you didn’t destroy me. You saved me–again, and again, and again. Your love made me whole in a way I still don’t know how I deserve. But I’ll try to understand. I’ll try to be the person you always believed me to be. I’m sorry I didn’t try before. I’m sorry I couldn’t show you.
“No,” Dean whispers, and even to himself it sounds utterly, irreparably broken.
Dean steps back into the devil’s trap, and he presses the point of the blade into Belphegor’s chest until it breaks the skin and the fabric beneath the knife blooms a violent red. The first drop of blood always used to turn Dean’s stomach, used to make everything in him scream that he should stop, put down the blade, and just walk away. It made him desperately want to leave all this behind so that maybe, just maybe, he could forget Hell and Alistair, forget that doing this is exactly what made the world go to shit–but not today. Today the blood grants him the illusion of control, and Dean holds on to that feeling tightly. This time, he lets himself play the part because,
“Not about the colt, necessarily. But yeah, of course, there’s more. There’s always more. That’s why you gotta let me stick around.”
“What was it like?” Dean asks passively, green eyes dark and heavy-lidded in the low light. “Before–,” Dean gestures vaguely, “before all of this, I mean.” His lips hover, parted, near the cold glass mouth of his open beer bottle. Castiel can’t decipher his expression–there’s something secret held in his gaze. “Can you tell me?” Dean prompts when he doesn’t receive an answer. Castiel purses their lips, perplexed and treading lightly.
“It’s okay, Cas. It is. The things you’ve done for me… I already know. You told me this before, Castiel, and it goes both ways. This isn't your fault, but even if it was, you’d already be forgiven. You saved me. You did. From hellfire, from death and danger over, and over, and over again. You saved me from being alone. So if I can return the favor, if I can stay with you now, then I'm glad to do it. I owe you that much and more.”
CHARLIE: He hasn’t brought it up?
[ January 26, 2014. 18:17 ]
CASUALTIES: KEVIN TRAN, GUNSHOT TO THE SHOULDER FROM MILITARY FIRE.
“Thanks,” Dean says blandly, pausing a moment before sitting down on a cushion by Cas’s side. He hasn’t looked in a mirror, but he knows its true. He hadn’t shaved since they left for their mission a couple of days back, he can still feel the dried flecks of blood on his face and hands where he missed them with the washcloth, and the dark circles under his eyes haven’t left in months. Cas looks at him for a long time, his expression indecipherable.
CAS: I think–wait, no–
Dean scoffs. “Yeah. I sure know how to pick ‘em, don’t I,” he says, more to himself than to Benny, who shifts uncomfortably all the same. “It’s fine though,” Dean continues. “I am–I’m good, man.”
The words are out of their mouth unthinkingly, and Castiel hopes desperately that Dean doesn’t see this as the admission it is. That they may well have said everything they’ve kept bottled up for decades. Dean’s brow pinches, and he struggles with a reply before Castiel shakes their head, dispelling the tangible tension between them. Cas smiles kindly, but it doesn’t reach their eyes.
CHUCK: You got it. Hey, boss, I know this sucks. I’m really so–
BENNY: Copy that. See you then, brother. Over and out.
A second more to find the words.
to see you again, so badly I didn’t even care to think–,” Castiel sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face and casting his eyes downcast. He’s looking more and more jaded by the second. “I was so, so selfish, and look what that got us.”
“So,” Benny starts, the measure of his voice slow and cautious. “Did you… is Lee–”
Dean turns away, putting distance between the two of them in an effort to hide how unsettled he is by Belphegor’s apparent candor. He scoffs and prays it comes off as irritated rather than uneasy. “Wow, you really like the sound of your own voice.”
DEAN: Hey, Cas. It’s uh– it’s me again.
, the way I feel about you. Think about you. I’ve never needed anyone before the way I need you. I see the way you loved me–
I’m so sorry we left you, but we’re gonna get you home safe, okay? I promise. I promise.
. So I'll throw away ego, I'll throw away self-preservation, I'll throw away this whole damn war, because I am
Castiel does look Dean in the eyes now, and he knows what he sees. He understands, but still, he has to fight it. To resist Dean’s recklessness tooth and nail, even though he has no illusions about where this situation is headed.
As soon as Dean and Charlie step out of the car, they hear shouting. Dean curses under his breath and they sprint towards the commotion. Charlie snags her cast on a branch not far into the woods, but she calls out for Dean to keep going without her, and so he does. He runs as fast as he can, trampling branches and clumps of dirty snow and god knows what else under the soles of his shoes. He skids on a few small patches of yet unmelted ice, and feels the scrape of branches on his face as he moves, near blinded by the dark, but he pushes forward nonetheless, not stopping for a second. He has no idea what could possibly be going on, but he knows it can’t be good.
Cas turns off the transceiver in a hurry, praying to a god he knows isn't listening that whoever’s coming didn't hear his transmission.
“Cas, please.”
“I’m… ya know.” Dean shrugs half-heartedly, but the grimace on his face and his death grip on the steering wheel betray him. He chews at his lip for a moment, brow pinched together, and when he finally speaks again, his voice comes out unusually small. “Why do things always go wrong, Charlie? And I don’t mean–I don’t know. Maybe I’m being a baby, but it seems like me causing the literal end of the world was bad enough. Why do I always have to make things worse?”
BENNY: Dean? Mic check. Can you hear me? Me and Harry just got back.
In an instant, their only shot at killing the devil sinks below the inky surface of the water.
“This is taking too long,” Dean sighs quietly, and it’s barely discernible against the mechanical hum of the engine and the low rumble of tires treading over damaged asphalt. Dean has lost the capacity to care enough that his hand is shaking on the stick shift as he pulls back onto the main road. Another failed search, and another small spark of hope that he didn't even know he had left has been pummeled into dust. He thought he’d seen something in the trees this time, black hair and blue eyes in the midst of all that green ghosting at the edges of his vision, but, of all people, Dean should know that ghosts are never what you want them to be. He returns to the road empty-handed again.
BENNY: Hey, Dean’s not picking up. Where's he at? Did he leave with Cas already, or–
“Yeah, well… we rarely get what we wish for.” Cas looks him dead in the eyes and, in that moment, Dean feels completely, utterly,
DEAN: So? How is he? Is he–will he be–
“And I know it too. Hell, I’ve
Castiel treasures those dreams, and though they are not his to hold onto he clings to them tightly and keeps them tucked safely in his chest. Despite the cold, he is warmed to his very soul–or whatever semblance of a soul that he might possess. He can picture Dean’s face perfectly in his mind's eye, in all its rosy, golden, freckled perfection. The crookedness of his nose where it’s been broken a few too many times, his eyes that flash bright green like the sun does in the moment before it sets. Castiel feels less alone than he has in days, and he treks onward, with renewed vigor, because if he has the chance to see Dean once more he’ll take it and run with it without a second thought.
[ January 26, 2014. 05:07 ]
“Let me guess, you’re not like the rest of them? Well, I hate to break it to you, but,” Dean pauses, inspects the knife still in his hand, then looks back at Belphegor with an intentionally phony smile, “I really don’t care. Because, to me,
Dean looks at Charlie and the ends of his lips quirk up just a little. It’s as close to a smile as he can manage, and it’s fractured like he doesn’t believe her for a second, but he appreciates the effort all the same. “Thank you. For being here. I know I’m the one who should be reassuring you.”
I hope you’ve enjoyed this! Again, I’d really like to thank everyone who supported this while I was writing it originally, especially Kate, Maggie, and Nikki. I wouldn’t have stuck with this without your encouragement! Comments and kudos are always appreciated <3
“Maybe I deserve it.” Dean’s stomach twists into a tangled mess and something at the back of his mind tells him he shouldn’t subject Charlie to this, how saturated he is in shame and self-loathing, that she has enough on her shoulders as it is. The monsters in his mind are louder, though, gnarled and ugly enough to give voice to his vices, so what’s one more sin amidst the legions of others. “Maybe this is what happens when you put the fate of the world in the hands of someone worthless. I mean, Charlie, look me in the eye and tell me I haven’t failed miserably at almost everything I’ve tried. You can't do it, can you?”
[ January 29, 2014. 16:37 ]
With a put-upon sigh, Dean scrubs his hands together. It’s more for something to do to ease his restlessness than it is for warmth, although the chill in the air has the cheeks and noses rosy on the both of them. He glances quickly over at Castiel before he can stop himself, taking in the profile he knows so well–the slope of his forehead, the angle of his jaw, the sharp point of his nose, the sliver of blue beneath his lashes. Even the dark shadow of his stubble and his tousled hair have become fundamental aspects of Dean’s image of Cas after having grown accustomed to them in the last few years.
DEAN: Is he secured?
, and
“You’re it for me, Cas, you understand? You’re everything. You have been for a long time. I mean, just look at me. I put the end of the world on hold for you. I prayed to you even when I knew you couldn’t hear it, and now, even while everything’s falling apart, I'm spilling my guts like some lovesick kid writing letters in a dollar store diary, and you know what? I don't even care, because it's
DEAN: Anyone got eyes on this guy? I can’t hold the line forever.
me. I terrify
And, just like that, Castiel shatters completely. Every last ounce of resolve he had, what little hope there was left to stop Dean from doing whatever awful thing he had in mind crumbles now into nothing. Dean has always been like this, an unstoppable force, a whirlwind of thrown caution, of steadfast affection, and of good intentions with more than a hint of self-destruction, and he had pulled Castiel in, enraptured him, and made him fall in every way imaginable. Dean is as he’s always been, only this time his dogged constancy is what breaks Castiel’s heart.
Don't make us leave y–
“Dean–”
Castiel looks an absolute wreck, sprawled out on the floor of his cabin facing skyward with his eyes glazed over as if he’s seeing visions in the greyed wood panels of the ceiling. The state he’s in, he just might be, little orange bottles scattered on the ground around him like leftover party favors. Dean’s by his side in an instant, pulling Castiel up until he’s sitting as close to upright as he can manage.
The wheel that locks the door from the outside spins, creaking so loudly that Dean and Castiel can hear it from where they sit on the opposite side of the room. It’s a desolate scene, cold metal walls reaching high up to an empty darkening sky, the few bookshelves and tables scattered throughout the circular room all barren now, save for just one small metal cart.
demon mentioned him…”
Castiel’s answering smile is small but earnest. It’s funny, they think to themself, how nonchalantly Dean said it.
Charlie sniffles and wipes her eyes with the back of her hand. “I know.” She manages a small smile that Dean knows is as much for her own sake as it is for his. Dean sees her gaze flick over to Cas’s hunched figure, and before he can say a word of warning against it she’s striding swiftly in his direction. Dean knows there’s no stopping her, and, quite honestly, he doesn’t want to, so he settles instead for following quickly in her wake.
DEAN: Get some rest, okay? I’ll see you in the morning.
BENNY: Hey, we’re here. Is he–?
find him, leaving him out here, a victim to the elements, his body nothing but a meal for the hungry wild things in the wood.
“Maybe not, but I just thought–,” Castiel exhales shakily, “I thought, that maybe you wouldn’t have to be so alone in all of this.” He pauses, and Dean pretends he doesn’t notice the sentiment slip from his features, his expression stiffening until he appears as reserved as the day they had met. “I suppose you've made your choice, though.”
Where the comings and goings of history made barely a mark, Dean has left no part of Castiel unaffected. The chink in their armor had always been there, but, without even knowing it, Dean took that breach left in his wake a fissure, one that consumed all logic and reason, all caution, everything Castiel has ever known, thrown to the wind.
BENNY: I know you are, brother. I know.
He can’t bear it for more than a second. He tears his eyes away and stands, setting his jaw and striding resolutely toward the doorway. He’s nearly outside again before Castiel speaks.
JODY: Wait, is that–?
In his last moments of lucidity, Castiel lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder, fitting the pads of his fingers perfectly onto the raised bumps of the years-old scar where he had held Dean for the very first time. His hand moves upwards then, more steady than it’s been in hours, to cradle Dean’s cheek as tenderly as he can. Dean leans into the contact and he knows, without a shred of doubt, that he could not live without it, not now that he’s had it. It’s an awful, gnawing, unholy feeling to be loved like this and to know that it can not last, no matter what they might try. Dean is sick with it now, though, and he can't go back. Not ever. Their story ends like this, like a tragedy, the two of them victims of hubris and fate and circumstance, but it’s okay, Dean thinks. So be it. At least they’re closing the book together.
BENNY: I don’t know, brother, he’s just–hold on.
“Don't say his name. Just don’t.” Cas’s expression turns cold, and he doesn’t respond, choosing instead to stare steadily at the road ahead. Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and wonders, not for the first time, why he can’t seem to open his mouth without hurting Cas’s feelings.
“Before the apocalypse–well, the first one. Before hell.” Dean studies them intently. “Before all of that. Everything. What was it like?”
“It’s okay, Dean. Tt’s alright,” Cas continues, in what he must know is a futile attempt to reassure him. “I got more time than most, probably used up the last of whatever speck of grace I might’ve had left, but we need to be realistic. It’s been days since this happened. Who knows how long I have left. I already feel it in me, changing me into something I don’t want to become. And if–
supposed to post this hours ago but the finale promo vid came out OOPS
“No,” Dean replies finally, picking up the demon knife from where it lays on the surface of the cart. “No, I’m not. Not for you, at least.” He turns back towards the demon, stepping into the intricate Enochian devil’s trap painted carefully on the floor. He tries not to remember the day it was painted, Cas demonstrating the symbols first, drawing them on scrap paper with a near-dry ballpoint pen. The wood beneath their fingertips, paintbrushes in hand. The warmth of Cas’s fingers wiping off a spot of paint that had found its way onto Dean’s cheek. Dean presses the blade to the demon’s neck and looks him in the eyes, and he tries once more not to think about how the blue of them looks stale and dull compared to Cas’s. He tries, and he tries, but it’s a futile effort, so, instead, he continues pretending.
FATALITIES: ED ZEDDMORE, MILITARY FIRE. MANDY DUREN, CROAT ATTACK. COLE TRENTON, INFECTED, EXECUTED.
Dean’s grip on the steering wheel is unforgiving, his knuckles a ghastly sight of white-yellow fury and peppered with spots of dark red dried blood, and it’s ugly against the black of the dashboard. Charlie sits beside him, peering out the passenger window, resting her uninjured arm on the door and using it to prop her chin up. She's tired, of course, they all are, but turned away from Dean as she is, he can barely make out the dark circles under her eyes. That’s fine, though. It lets him feel less guilty.
“You love so completely that you’ve brought the world to its knees, that you’ve unwritten fate itself, and I didn’t know I was capable, but... I think I could love you like that, if you let me. If I’m being honest, I already do.” Dean shakes his head, and a smile begins to shine through the cracks of his broken expression. “
It’s silent now. The buzzing of his phone has long since stopped. Dean has no idea how long he’s been sitting on the floor like this, seconds rolling into minutes rolling into hours, the mark on his shoulder–a ghost of his best friend’s touch–his only company.
JANUARY 29, 2014
CHARLIE: Will it? Will you? God, Dean… what are you going to
“People talk,” Belphegor replies casually. “Well–not people, but you know what I mean. Besides, it’s not difficult to put the pieces together. The colt can kill anything. You want the devil dead. You’ve been capturing demons. You think the demons have the colt. One plus one, ya know.”
BENNY: We’re closing. His truck’s parked up by the lake. Pursuing on foot.
“But that’s okay,” Dean continues. “I still gotta say this.” There’s a tremor in his voice, and he feels like he’s made of glass, but, in this moment, he can’t bring himself to care.
There are 5 of them, and they walk past Castiel so slowly that it's painful. They seem more coherent than most, watchful, calculating, and this kind of croat is far worse than the rabid kind, Castiel thinks, dread settling heavy in his gut. The pure spiteful vigor they seem to get from the havoc they wreak makes them that much harder to fight or escape from, fervently pursuing a destructive mission that they no longer have the capacity to understand. Castiel concentrates on the weight of the rifle still strapped to his back, readying himself. 4 rounds left–maybe 5. God, it had better be five.
After a too-long silence, Dean clears his throat and looks back up. “How about you though, man? Are you good? You almost–”
DEAN: Cas? Cas are you on?
“Yeah? What is it, Cas?”
Castiel is quiet for a long time. He stares at nothing but trees and dirty snow and the long line of the asphalt leading endlessly onward. His knuckles are white on the steering wheel, and his breath curls out from between his lips like smoke. When he finally speaks, his voice is so quiet that Dean almost doesn’t hear it. He half wishes he hadn’t.
Charlie rests her head heavily on the window. “I know it is.” With her good hand she absently fiddles with the pull of her zipper, and she doesn’t turn to look at him this time, but it’s dark and Dean’s eyes are on the road so he pretends it doesn’t make a difference. “But we’ll find him, Dean. Eventually.” She tries to say it like she means it, but Charlie’s never had a gift for telling lies.
And if you’re ever gonna come back here, wait a month, hell, a year if you can before you do. Understood?
Charlie parts with a kiss on Castiel’s sallow cheek and a squeeze of Dean’s hand. “This isn’t your fault either, you know,” she whispers as she passes, but Dean doesn’t respond with anything more than a sad smile. He climbs into the cold metal back of the truck, pulling Castiel up after him, and they share a weary look as Benny pulls the opening closed and the lock clicks from outside.
When he realizes how long he’s been staring, Dean looks away, but as soon as he does he feels the distinct intensity of Cas’s gaze boring right through him in much the same way. Dean refuses to meet his eyes. They go back and forth like this for what seems like forever, caught up in some twisted version of a staring contest until, finally, it seems that Cas has had enough. He exhales, and it’s deafening in the silence, drawn-out as though he’s steeling himself for some great feat.
“I hope you’re right.”
“I thought that my talking was the whole point of all this. So, I’m talking.”
“No.” His hand stills, flattening on the table, and his voice is even and measured. “Do you?”
Dean doesn’t reply. His glare is persistent. He’s about ready to snap for the hundredth time in under an hour, and he knows it's plain to see. Finally, after a tense minute, Lee lets out a heavy sigh.
[ January 26, 2014. 21:38]
He stumbles over an exposed tree root, and he tries to catch himself, but it’s still terribly dark, and there’s nothing to hold onto, and so, Castiel falls, inelegantly, to the ground with an aborted cry. His vision swims, and bile rises in his throat. The woods feel like they’re pressing in around him, ready to swallow him whole. Every rustle of leaves is deafening, the moonlight is bright as a spotlight, and god, he can’t do anything but lay on the cold wet dirt of the forest floor because he
Shit, they're getting closer, I have t–
Dean, man, are you there? Did you leave already?
“No. No, listen to me,” Dean hushes him, “You were right. You were. With our luck we were never gonna get a happy ending anyway, were we? But at least, this way… Cas, you’ve given more to me than you can ever know. Even now.”
WE’RE MOVING OUT AT 06:00. BOBBY’S CLOSEST SAFEHOUSE HAS A FORTIFIED PANIC ROOM. WE’VE USED IT A FEW TIMES BEFORE. IT’S MADE TO KEEP THINGS OUT, BUT IT’S GOOD ENOUGH AT KEEPING THINGS IN, TOO.
CASTIEL: 10-2, everything’s working on our end. Is Dean with you?
CASTIEL HAS IT–THE CROATOAN VIRUS. IT MUST’VE HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS KNOCKED OUT AFTER #237, BUT HE DIDN’T START EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS UNTIL LATE LAST NIGHT, BEST GUESS AS TO WHY IS THAT HE’S NOT FULLY HUMAN.
The car door shuts violently, and Dean slams his fist on the dashboard hard enough to bruise. Charlie slips into the car beside him with much less fanfare. She closes the passenger door and looks over at him.
Charlie smiles back at him, and it’s not as big and bright and toothy as it used to be before all this started, but it’s nonetheless a comfort. “Just because you feel like you need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, that doesn't mean that you don’t deserve support. You deserve to be okay just as much as the rest of us, Dean. Even if you don’t believe it.”
“Belphegor is dead,“ Dean replies bluntly. “You feel like joining him?“ Dean glares down at Lee with such unadulterated disgust that it in and of itself is an act of violence. Lee looks back at him pitifully.
“No,” Dean sighs, equally quiet. “No there isn’t.”
DEAN: (sighs) Same old. I’ll get you up to speed at the briefing. 05:00 tomorrow.
DEAN: Maybe the other buildings? Fuck they must’ve known we were coming.
DEAN: You got him?
“Dean,” Cas looks at him so intensely that Dean has no choice but to meet his eyes. “When I told you–”
[ January 26, 2014. 03:22 ]
Dean. He was last seen an hour back by the trucks. Tire tracks show him heading west, and in the snow he should be easy enough to–
“Cas…”
Slowly, Castiel nods, and they start, if not at the beginning, then very near to it.
CHARLIE: We will. Take care of yourself, Cas. You’d both better come home safe, alright?
“Anyone else have anything to say?” Dean’s eyes dart to the other end of the table where his best friend sits wordlessly, reclined in his chair as if he has somewhere better to be. He’s the only one who hasn’t yet spoken. “Cas?”
“What about the army mooks?” Dean shoots Lee a warning glance, but he’s already looking over at Charlie. She looks thoroughly unimpressed, and, even though she still has a cast on her left arm, Dean’s surprised Lee has the gall to question her. “You got any news on them? Because–”
DEAN: Try the other rooms then. Is that all the demons?
“No need to apologize, I get it,” Dean replies sincerely. “It’s been a long couple of years. But we’re getting closer, alright?” Benny’s obviously not convinced, but he nods and Dean places a hand on his shoulder. “You good?”
It’s a handprint. He knows it is. He had looked at it once, for a fraction of a second, before tearing his eyes away.
BENNY: Yeah chief, he ain’t going nowhere.
“No, Lee,” he replies unfalteringly. “No. You threw that away. You threw it away when you decided to take that deal. When you decided that working with demons–with
“As good as I’ll get.” Benny’s eyes dart behind him to glance at Cas, and it’s only for a split second but Dean catches anyway. “I’ll see you out there, brother.” Dean nods at him and Benny walks out the door, closing it behind him. Cas is still sitting there, scratching absently at the splintering wood of the table in front of him. Dean looks down at him intently until Cas finally meets his eyes.
“I’m coming.” Cas stands and brushes past Dean, but before he reaches the door Dean stops him with a hand on his forearm. He doesn’t hold on tightly, not using nearly enough force to keep Cas from leaving, but Cas stills all the same.
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” he prays, “and I love you. I love you,” Dean takes those three words and holds them close, repeating them until they fill up every inch of space in the empty room. Until he’s breathless.
“When I told you I loved you,” Cas insists, his tone leaving no room for argument, “I wasn't lying to you, Dean. It wasn’t out of pity or guilt or whatever other excuses you’re using to try to convince yourself that it's not the truth.”
This is Castiel. I’m trying again. Can anyone hear me? I’m traveling east still.
LEE: Dean, they're almost on us. Please, we don't have time for this.
It’s an exhalation and exultation all at once, and the truth of it leaves him trembling.
Dean and Castiel drive the rest of the way in silence, steeping in their sorrow like they always do.
“That’s it, that’s the truth, I swear!”
DEAN: Think I saw something. Pull over, make sure everyone else follows suit. We’re making another stop.
They all turn at once, and the liminal time in which they wait feels like a decade, but it’s only moments before they hear it again. The sound of branches and frozen soil underfoot, this time clearly accompanied by unfamiliar movement in the trees. Dean turns on his heel, rifle in hand, finger on the trigger. He holds his breath, and for a moment it seems like it was just his imagination, but the branches move again and his breath lapses almost entirely. He lowers his gun and then he forgets how to move because there is Castiel, in all his grimy, unshaven, blue-eyed glory, standing a mere few feet in front of him like he hadn’t been gone a second.
“It just is.” Dean’s grip on the wheel tightens impossibly further. “The safety of my friends, of the camp, that’s on me. But still, I keep trusting the wrong people, not paying enough attention. I should’ve seen right through Lee, Charlie. I’ve known him forever. But I didn’t. I didn’t want to. And Cas… god, Charlie I–,” Dean’s resolve crumbles and his voice breaks wretchedly. “He’s probably dead already. He’s dead and the last thing we did was argue. I didn’t even get to tell him–”
Dean can’t speak, can’t breathe, and before he knows what he’s doing he’s launching to his feet and throwing himself at Cas. It could be a trick, god knows he’s been fooled enough times, but who fucking gives a shit anymore?
damaged organs, severe trauma around his skull, and whatever else he can heal, remaining grace and breath leaving him in a rush. Dean’s wheezing has gone away at least, his breath steady and sure, and Cas sags, exhausted.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean lets his head hang back, considering. East, he thinks. The sun rises in the east, new beginnings and shit. Not a full plan, but a start. He gets an itch in his fingers that buzzes down to his chest, the need to go, the need to move singing in his veins.
“Where we goin’?” he mumbles. He lets Cas pull him along willingly, stumbling after him. Cas squeezes his hand, and doesn’t answer until they’ve reached Dean’s room.
, Dean thinks, as he forces himself up from the bed, forces himself into movement, or his thoughts are going to spiral deeper and deeper until he drowns. He exhales, shaky.
“Dean,” Cas can’t help but whisper, breathless, and he leans forward to press his lips to Dean’s forehead. Dean trembles in his hold, a low keen catching in his throat. “Come lay with me?”
Mildred had said.
Cas’s eyes rove frantically over his features, looking for any sort of deception. All Dean can do is lift the hand tangled in the trench coat to Cas’s face, cradling Cas between his palms.
(What was he thinking, wanting to settle down someday? His father had always told him that hunting was all he was good for, and he’d been taught time and time and time again that there was no leaving the life.
_just drivin
Dean doesn’t answer.
Cas exhales roughly, and without a second thought, he surges forward, pressing his lips to Dean’s. Dean sucks in a breath sharply in surprise; a wounded noise escapes and then he’s responding, lips moving against Cas’s and holding him close. Tears well in Cas’s eyes, dripping down his cheeks, and when he pulls away for air, he finds that Dean is in a similar state. Dean huffs a laugh and then winces, doubling over as the pain catches up to him, his hand slipping from Cas’s neck to his chest and clutching tightly at Cas’s coat.
He has to get out. Out of his room, out of the bunker, out of Lebanon if he has to, but he can’t stay here. He can’t. He bolts up from his bed, snatching his jacket as he flees
"I'm here, now," he continues, cradling Dean's face in his palm and leaning down to press a kiss to Dean's temple. "And I am not," he places a kiss to Dean's cheek, "going," one to the corner of his mouth, "anywhere."
“Can you really blame a guy?” Dean snaps, snatching his hand back. He looks like he wants to move further, but he’s locked in place, unable to go too far. “After— we only just got you back, man, and— y-you keep— how am I supposed to trust that you’ll stay?”
I know I was shit at saying it, but dammit I tried, okay? I tried. To show it when I couldn’t say it. But we just weren’t ever speaking the same language, I guess.”
Cas reassures himself in relief as the darkness grips him tighter.
“Your brother will come racing in to save you,” Chuck continues, gesturing as he speaks, “and Jack will be there, too. They’ll make some valiant effort to save the two of you, try to beat me at my own game, but it’s not going to work. I’ve written every possibility, every scenario that could ever happen. Each one, I win. It's literally impossible for me to lose!” he says with a giddy grin, arms spreading out to his sides in victory.
"Cas," he breathes. "I
“Stay,” Dean pleads. His eyes are closed, brows furrowed, panicked.
He presses their lips together softly, ready and willing to pull back if Dean isn’t willing. Dean whimpers beneath the touch and responds almost immediately, desperate, and Cas forces himself to keep it gentle as Dean clutches at him tightly. They kiss for a moment more and then Cas is pulling away, nosing beneath Dean's chin, peppering kisses against his pulse point and up his jaw to press his lips against Dean's ear.
Cas’s heart breaks all over again.
“Don’t
“Me?”
He tosses the phone onto the passenger seat and pulls back onto the highway, ignoring the buzzing of more of Sam’s worried texts. He’ll update Sam when he’s good and ready. Sam will be okay until then.
Dean exhales shakily. Swallows. “How— how much you mean to me,” he whispers hoarsely. He hesitantly meets Cas’s stunned gaze. “You had to have known. All the prayers—?”
He still has his guns in the trunk, all of his supplies. He takes care of a hunt or two further north that catch his attention. One ghost nearly blows out his knee when it sends him tumbling down the stairs, and it aches like a mother after spending the night in the Impala.
It's four in the morning and he hasn't slept in as many days. He's staring at the ceiling, mind so loud it's echoing in the silence of the bunker's halls. The stone is pressing down around him, the absence of Cas weighing so heavily upon him that he barely feels like he can breathe.
“Excuse me?”
"Never again."
Maybe he was just always meant for the road.
you keep leaving,” he says, and the defeat in his tone makes Cas want to kneel at his feet and beg him to understand:
Cas stills.
His fingers spasm at the memory, at the want and grief that races through him. Bits of grass uproot in his hands and his breath escapes him all at once as if he’d been punched. He’d hurt Cas. He’d hurt him so bad,

“Dean—” Cas starts, but Dean pulls away, lifting his head to search Cas’s face desperately.
Dean is
“I’m not going anywhere,” Cas answers, steady, and he reels Dean back in. Dean goes willingly.
He stumbles from the Impala like a man possessed, hoping against hope that Cas would maybe, somehow, appear in the grasses swaying gently in the breeze. He said he’d woken up here before when he had come back, so if there was any remnant of his ashes here then
Cas pauses, mid-step, and then he is running, racing around the corner and throwing open the door. Dean is on the floor, head in his hands, lamp shattered across the ground next to him. His head flies up towards the intrusion and he immediately freezes, eyes blowing wide.
“Dammit,” he hisses through clenched teeth, leaning forward to press his head to the steering wheel as he sucks in ragged breaths. He can’t do this. He just needs to go already.
“Please,” he breathes. “Please stay.”
Cas is stuck for eternity, now. This is the closest Dean will ever be to him again.
He forces himself to keep driving, though, pain be damned. He gets too antsy staying in any one place for too long, anymore.
“Dean,” Cas says gently, “I’m not going to force you into anything you do not want to do. But you need rest, and I believe this is the best way of doing so.”
Dean stills against him.
all right? Cas, you’re a mess.”

“Perhaps I could...stay the night?”
Dean grabs his face between his palms then, fingers holding him steady. Cas's eyelids flutter, exhaustion dragging at his limbs.
But there, not three feet in front of him, is the familiar beige of Cas’s trench coat. Dean stares at it a moment, disbelieving. His breath is stuck in his throat, eyes wide and already burning again as he lifts his gaze to soft blue eyes. Cas stares back at him. His face is unreadable, but there’s a warmth in his eyes that is unmistakable.
Sam keeps trying to call him. Dean can’t bring himself to answer the phone, not trusting himself to keep everything in check. He doesn’t even know what he would say, what he
After Chuck is defeated and Jack leaves, Dean finds his way back to the meadow.
“Are we?” Cas asks, eyebrow arched, challenging. Dean flushes, but doesn’t move.
Cas. I missed you so much.”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean huffs, turning back to filling the mug, “sure know how to scare a guy.”
Don’t
“Cas?” Dean breathes. Dean is still coming to, but Cas can feel darkness seeping in at the edges of his own consciousness, startling him back into awareness.
“Dean.”
“I’m here,” he says again into Dean’s crown, fingers stroking through the hair at his nape as Dean starts to quiet, sobs turning into shuddering gasps for air. He slumps against Cas, exhausted and spent, but Cas holds him upright, murmuring into his ear as he calms. They sit like that for a while, Cas kneeling in the middle of his bedroom, Dean secure in his arms, the quiet surrounding them comforting, instead of oppressive.
It takes awhile, but Jack is able to bring Castiel back from the Empty.
"Dean," he whispers, breathless, pressing his crown to Dean's throat. Dean tips his cheek against Cas's hair and sighs deep. Sam had told Cas in not so many words how hard Dean took each of his deaths and disappearances, but to hear it from Dean himself hurts Cas worse than any physical injury.
“Huh?” Dean pushes when he doesn’t answer. “You keep
his asks, voice wary. He’s trying to mask his worry, but Dean can see right through him. He should have left a note or something, maybe.
“Yes, you,” Cas says sternly as he reaches forwards and grabs Dean’s hand. Dean’s mouth snaps closed. “Come with me.”
"Dean," he says slowly, fingers hesitantly resuming motion, "I...you do not have to say it if you don't mean it."
He keeps driving.
_idk yet
Dean’s eyes fly open at that, shocked. “What?”
“Shut up,” he says, and walks Dean backwards towards the bed. Dean sits when his knees hit the edge. “Will you let me help?”
“Every time, I have come back, Dean,” he says, once again gathering Dean’s hands between his own, thumb rubbing soothingly back and forth across scarred knuckles, “I've always come back, and I've come back to
You can stay, if you want. But I. I want you to stay.
Dean reaches up to grip desperately at Cas’s wrists.
"Always," Cas whispers, holding him tight.
Later, he knows they’ll need to talk things through, figure everything out, but for now Dean could stay here in Cas’s embrace for years or hours, as long as he’s here.
He’s only twenty minutes from the bunker when the blades catch his eye. His chest aches at the sight and it takes everything in him not to turn and run as the windmill comes into view. He’d at least had a body before, something to burn and ashes to spread to the wind so Cas could be free.
“I missed you, too,” he answers. He starts to pull away, but Dean’s fingers tighten on his wrist.
“I should have told you,” he rasps as the bee disappears from sight. He takes a steadying breath and closes his eyes, the meadow quieting around him. “I’m so sorry we missed our chance.”
“That’s not up to you,” Chuck counters. He reaches his hand out towards Cas and squeezes, and Cas’s chest constricts in pain. He gasps, doubling over, feeling his grace ebbing further and further from his reach.
He pushes it down each time it rears its head, and continues on.
_dont worry abt me sammy
and by his side where Dean’s been trying to keep him for years.
They sit like that for a moment and just breathe, pipes clanging in the distance. Cas shifts uncomfortably, arms pinned beneath him.
“Dean,” Cas answers, his voice so weak he’s not even sure that Dean heard it. Dean shifts against him. Cas concentrates on breathing through the pain, waiting for Dean to realize
Dean breaks then, sob tearing from his throat as he crumbles before him, free hand coming up to cover his face. Cas grabs that one too, and hauls Dean in close, one hand still clutching Dean’s hand to his chest, the other holding Dean’s head to his shoulder as he shakes apart. Dean’s hand winds around and grips at Cas’s shirt so tight Cas is sure it will tear, but he can’t be bothered to care right now. Dean wails into his shoulder, tears drenching his shirt and all Cas can do is hold him tight in comfort as his own heart shatters to pieces at the sound.
“Because, see, I already know what’s going to happen,” Chuck says, pacing leisurely around them, tilting down towards Dean's unconscious form as he speaks. His footsteps are quiet in the vast emptiness of the warehouse, but each step seems to pound in time with Cas’s own injuries, pain driving higher at each step. For all Cas knows, Chuck could be doing that on purpose.
Dean’s gaze drops to their joined hands. He’s trembling, Cas notes. Cas squeezes his fingers and Dean shudders.
Cas’s chest twinges. He gets back off of the bed, walking around and coming to a stop in front of Dean. He cups his face in his hands and tilts Dean’s face to his own ever so gently, Dean blinking in shock.
“No no no, hey,” Dean says in a rush, words quiet. Cas can hear the desperation in every syllable. “Come on, Cas, stay with me, man.”
"We're gonna be fine," he says, reassuring. His eyes are steely as he waits, hand steady on the gun. "I'm not letting him take you away from me.
Cas’s grip tightens just that little bit more and Dean nearly unravels. Cas is here, in his meadow that Dean had picked out just for him. He’s alive. He’s
He doesn’t have a lot of time to think on it, as the bee doesn’t stay in place long. It lifts up back into the air; Dean twitches as it comes towards his face, blinking quickly as it bumps into his nose once and flits off back to the flowers.
“I could, I could watch over you, like I used to,” Cas says, suddenly fumbling, heat rising to his cheeks. “And physical contact— in the doula classes, and with Jack, I learned that physical contact is a wonderful stress reliever—”
he asks again, pressing. “After everything— how could you—?”
, Cas, you’ve always had me.”
"I do," Dean rushes, arm tightening across Cas's chest. "I do. Love you. Have for a long time, I think. It's just..."
“Are you all right,” Cas repeats, straining through the tightness of his chest. He opens his eyes to look Dean over, searching for any sign that he's lying.
Five minutes later he’s clambering into Baby, phone tossed on the seat, and he drives.
“I’m real,” Cas whispers, lowering their fingers to hold against his ribs, so Dean can feel the rise and fall of his chest, the steady beating of his heart. He catches Dean’s
“Okay,” Dean says under his breath, thumb swiping across Cas’s cheek. Cas is almost certain that was more for Dean than himself, reassuring himself that Cas was alive. Cas wants to reach up and grab him, intertwine their fingers, and assure Dean that he’ll be all right. But everything hurts, it’s difficult to breathe, and he’s not going to be awake for much longer; draining his grace like that wiped him out. Survivable, but dreadfully exhausting.
“Dean,” Cas calls, but Dean doesn’t stir. His limbs are bent at awkward angles, the whole of him a heap atop blood splattered across the ground. Too much blood. Cas would almost think he was dead if not for the wheezing emanating from Dean’s chest at every shallow breath, every minuscule rise and fall. If he could just get close enough
He thinks Sam calls out to him as he leaves, but his ears are buzzing, ringing and static at war in his head. He falls into the front seat, hands shaking as he tries to put the key in the ignition.
“I missed you,” Dean continues, and Cas pulls back to press their foreheads together.
“But I haven’t even said hello.”
“You need to sleep,” Cas explains, tugging him through the doorway and closing the door behind them, “it is evident you haven’t been getting enough. You’re running yourself ragged, and I won’t allow you to continue doing this.”
Eventually, though, a voice in his head that sounds too much like Cas gets him up and moving. The heat has become oppressive, the wind wicking away his tears before they can hit the ground below. He heaves himself to his feet, skin too tight across his bones, and he stumbles to the windmill. The shade of it is a welcome respite from the heat. He collapses back against the side and slides to the ground, far away from any of the delicate life he could too easily destroy in his grief. He thunks his head back against the old wood and pulls his knees to his chest, eyes clenched shut. His arms rest against the tops of his knees, hands dangling, and he takes deep shuddering breaths as the surrounding calm sinks into his skin, pulling the grief from his lungs. It’s too hard to hold onto any intense emotions here. Dean doesn’t know how it works, just that it does, and he breathes in time with the slow rotation of the blades.
Dean lets it ring and pulls up his texts, typing slow and methodical.
"I'm not leaving," Cas promises, voice weak from pain. He's fading again, clinging to consciousness with a death grip. He has to make sure Dean understands. "If we can...can defeat Chuck, I'm not leaving, Dean."
“I love you, too," Dean whispers into the quiet, eyes screwed shut tight. Cas pauses.
Cas smiled, “I’m always here, it's not as if I’m difficult to find.”
Dean pilled all his stolen goods onto Sam, “Go Sammy. Now.”
Cas watched for a lie as Dean gazed up at him and smiled when none came. Dean stroked his fingers over the other man's face, relishing in being able to touch him.
“Dean, my name is Dean.”
“Yeah, I think near the roof somewhere. There weren’t any windows but now and then I would here a chopper, it was close.”
Meg stood and began to pace, “There are terms.” She said it like it was a dirty word.
“There is no way you know me that well… maybe I need to get a new human friend. One that is less observant.”
“Good.”
Castiel frowned, “No, Uriel tried to take him. The boy got hurt fighting back. I intervened.”
“Hey! I didn’t ask for a makeover!”
Rounding the corner he stopped, hard. What he saw had his boots slamming to a halt so fast it jarred his spine and near had him ass first in the mud. Sam lay sprawled on the floor, unconscious and bleeding. Though it didn’t look serious Dean’s heart pounded in his chest. He wanted to move but his feet stuck to the damp soil in terror. A blur of two tall men fighting with swords had him trembling and panic raged in his chest as he glanced from his brother to the fight. What could he do... they were... they were Angels. He knew by their sheer speed they were nothing human. What could he possibly do against them?
Max ran a hand over his face. “Friend, we’re in a jungle. What are you talking about?”
“How long did you think it’d been?”
They moved towards the pick-up location it was hard going due to the overgrowth and the encroaching dark. Turning on their flashlights as they trekked was necessary, keeping everything human was the only choice they had right now they'd taken a lot of risks today.
‘I’m in your head you douche,’ she snapped.
“His?” Ruby interjected, “These animals took you and experimented on you, Dean. It doesn't deserve human pronouns; it’s the same as the others, a monster. They obviously have an end game we don’t know about; why else would it stay out there?”
“Marine,” Cas nodded at his third in command.
They both ignored the Angel, took to the stairs and then out into the midday sun.
“Sarg is pissed huh?”
Dean nuzzled into Cas’ neck like a puppy, it felt amazing, like being drunk.
“I love you too.”
They both looked at him like he’d lost his damn mind.
“Well shit.” Dean growled, “Where the hell did he go?”
“…right…”
“Dean? Are you upse-”
“Dean?”
“What are you?”
Cas gathered the broken man in his arms and stood, “I’m your only friend.”
“I think you broke my everything.”
“It’s raining.”
Sam cursed and sat at the counter and watched them.
Dean stepped closer and Cas frowned, unsure of this new serious man in front of him. Dean had changed this last year without him, so much had happened, he’d lost so much more than he thought he had back then.
“Dean,” Cas’ asked, voice cracking and unsure.
Meg frowned, “So you showed her mercy? You stopped.”
The demon growled and stood with clenched fists, “You have a feeling!? You never have feelings! You’re like a cold, perfect statute Cas. You’re seriously harming my calm right now.”
Dean blinked and there was nothing. Where he could have sworn someone had been was only empty space and two knee prints in the mud.
“Dude, stop swooning over the Sarg and get your ass out of that hole,” Max chastised.
“Cas, dude I’m joking… you know that right? Sure, I’d prefer tenure and who wouldn't want to go into work knowing the likelihood of being shot was minimal? But I chose this, I chose you and your mission.”
“Now Dean, today I’m going to test something new. I had to get special permission for this so you have to behave, I may not get a second try at it.”
The nod was short and sharp as if he didn’t want to admit it.
Dean sagged onto the table with a sigh as the door slammed closed.
“Babe.” Dean smiled and grabbed the other man’s shoulder, “That won't happen… I swear. We can do this together once I tell him.”
“Yeah.”
“You and Dean making out behind the bleachers.”
“Yes human, Seriously,” she glared at Cas, her eyes full of annoyance at this situation and of the unknown which she detested.
The tall, pale-haired angel glanced at Sam, “Samuel, I’m Naomi.”
“Holy shit,” he hissed.
Max huffed, “Fine, but I want them healed the next day Cas, I mean it!”
“You’re not going to like it.”
“Get that mess cleaned up and get your ass back here. This whole thing is turning into one giant shit show and I want you home. All of you,” Dean signed off.
“Sam, Rube’s, this is Castiel, he saved my ass.”
“My new, less observant human friend. Maybe they'll be a less sarcastic too.”
“Dean, Cas has just gone to heaven, he’ll be back. You’re being insane, is this something to do with that cupid case? Have you been cursed or something?” Sam frowned and started cleaning the bacon up.
“Which side?” Cas asked.
Meg nodded, “They’ve had it for a century and understandably the witches want it back.”
Instinct kicked in as Cas tried to use his gift, pain wracked through his body and he screamed.
“How sure?”
“DO NOT LAUGH CASTIEL!”
Cas nodded, “I think so”
“Yes, but you’ll need a talisman to enter,” he replied, ignoring her witty comment, then moved quickly to the door. Returning a few moments later with one of the necklaces Dean had provided him and handed it to Meg. Should he ask Dean for permission? He wasn’t sure with regards to human etiquette but in this, he’d rather ask for forgiveness than permission, the thought of waking Dean hurt his soul.
“That is a problem,” he frowned and considered every angle until the obvious came too him. “We do it all at once.”
Dean started to cry, sobbing, huge tears, “I can’t live like this… he’s my soul mate and now he’s gone.”
“He may be correct,” Cas added.
Considering it the Angel frowned, “So they could follow you here?”
Cas frowned, “My feathers are not fluffy.”
Dean had been playing the piano since he’d finished his company's annual gala speech. The Yamaha Grand sounded perfect in the empty room and he relished being able to spend some time alone. The Cloverleaf Hotel was the only place to hold a corporate New Years Eve party in New York. The five-star hotel was all grandeur, class and the best service money could buy. When his assistant suggested it, initially he’d recoiled, this place had so many memories of…him but business had prevailed like always. Dean pressed his cool fingers onto the ivory keys and listened to the sounds of merriment and fireworks, he was glad everyone was having a good time but he couldn’t bring himself to go and join them. Instead he was sucked into the memory of the last time he was here.
“Yeah.”
“Dean?” the man whispered, “Oh god… Ruby! It’s Dean!”
“Can you, I dunno, make him appear like you did before?”
Frowning, Dean stood and brushed himself off, why did Cas always make him so flustered. It was something in the way he looked at him, Dean shook the thought away like always.
“I don’t see what severed trees have to do with this Meg.”
“I try.” Dean grinned, “It’s kind of you to pay them more.”
Dean grinned, “Oh they really have kept you out of the loop, haven’t they? How long have you been earthbound?”
“Yeah, got tonight off from the corporate machine so I thought I’d come say hi to my favourite feathered friend.”
Cas laughed, “Sure if you want them to melt your insides. I’m using Holy fire.”
“Novak!”
“Ah!”
“We’re taking fire! Stand by,” The woman called into her headpiece.
“I’m not upset.” Dean added, “I’m annoyed, Jack is off with Sammy and I have this witch to deal with. I could use you.”
“Like a backup plan?” Dean asked
Her blue hair became dishevelled as she took her frustration out on it. Rage and worry shook her tiny body. Grabbing the edge of her grey Coda t-shirt she glanced at the man in his arms like she would an enemy or food.
"You see?" Sam laughed, "He sees Dean. Fucking angels."
“Okay,” he said, moving to embrace his friend, tightly, “Just don’t fucking scare me like that again, not this close to a refresh. You’re terrifying like that.”
“Right, you ready Cas?”
“Don’t think too hard feathers. We’ll figure it out,” Meg said as she punched his arm lightly. He frowned and watched her move to the liqueur cabinet and pour whisky into a crystal glass.
Sam stared at his brother, “Dean just stay there I’m calling Rowena.”
“No, it’s in the basement.”
“I missed you, big bro,” he said but the tone was wrong, it had lost it’s playful edge and was something closer to sorrow. “I’ll go in a second. There's just something you have to deal with if you're up for it?”
“What the hell?!”
“Dean, can we hurry? I hate the city, it smells weird,” Sam hissed.
“Where we going?”
“Shit, so they’re trying to wipe out my kind once and for all? Cas, you know what this means right? If someone let your human out, whether by mistake or design, they’re coming for him eventually. If Crowley finds out what they’re up to the war will start now and not whenever they’re planning their move.”
“I don’t-”
“You’re staring at me.”
“So why did you save my brother?” Sam asked Cas.
The pain from their separation was gone now, Dean’s pain had faded much faster than Cas’ almost as if he was being punished for trying to leave. Cas was startled by the soft sound of snoring pulling him from his mind. Dean had slipped down into the soft pillows of his bed and had fallen back to sleep. Leaving quietly, Cas crept through the door and back to the library where Meg was waiting. She sat in one of the wooden chairs rotating her cell in her hand ferociously.
“Well, whatever it is I’m sure we can-”
Cas frowned playfully, “That’s the one with the traps, isn’t it? The guy with the hat? India Johnson?”
“Oh god,” Dean moaned.
“This isn’t time for your whimsy Meg, I’m serious. We go in and get everything in one go, we’ll need something else though from the vault so we have to go there first, though maybe… I’ll have to consider the logistics.”
Tears trailed down Cas’ cheeks as he dressed, “Dean, I can’t do that. I can’t hide until you find your balls or your bastard of a father dies.”
“It saved me?” Dean whispered and Sam nodded.
“His name is Castiel.”
“I’m not going to ask why you’re so far away from where you should be, I assume it will be an interesting story. Equipment malfunction?”
“The one that was supposed to happen but God stopped it?”
Cas’ fingers used his face as something to hold while he abused his body. It was categorically the best things he’d experienced in a long time. He felt safe, he shouldn't but he did, Cas wouldn’t hurt him.
Dean took a moment to admire the Angel who against everything he had been taught was fighting for them, to protect them. He wasn’t sure what had happened, maybe Sam had been caught in the fighting? Castiel was facing him as they battled on. Blue eyes blazed like cold fire and Dean was in awe, he had never seen anything so beautiful.
“It was back during the war Meg, we were all asked to save a little every day so that we could use it in the event it was required.”
The frown flowing over her delicate face was suddenly marred by a shit-eating grin, “No dude, you’re done for. I’m going to go outside and dig your grave right now.”
Dean considered it but the pain of being away from Cas was too much and he slumped with his head on his arms on the counter.
