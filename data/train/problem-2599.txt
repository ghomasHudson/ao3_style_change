“I cannot allow you to look into these,” he warned our client. “The reports concern others who are in an equally unfortunate situation to yourself. However, there is sufficient material here for me to ensure, with the help of a contact of ours at Scotland Yard, your husband’s conviction for blackmail and extortion. He is but a petty criminal: he would spend two years in prison, and would afterwards no doubt exact his revenge upon you and yours. The alternative is that you use the threat of conviction as the leverage that you have spoken of: an incentive for him to cease his interference in your affairs and, if so much can be achieved, his interference in the affairs of others. In this, too, I will engage to assist you as far as I am able. I place the decision in your hands.”
walking home bootless so that you can pride yourself in having committed an unsolvable crime.”
He shrugged, and tossed the book carelessly onto the table. “I’m skeptical myself about the wisdom of sporting an eye-patch during courtship, but I’m certain that I can employ a seaman’s accents and vocabulary to excellent effect.”
“No time like the present,” Sherlock says, withdrawing his hand and managing to sound almost businesslike. “The first step is close physical proximity, but obviously we’ve got that covered. Once you’ve finished stitching me up, we should try kissing and caressing.”
,” he interrupted again, stopping me cold, “I’m saying that I need more time.”
motive that I am concerned with. Did you not observe anything extraordinary in her behaviour just now?”
She had walked all the way from Camberwell in spite of the wind and rain; her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright from the exercise. She entered our lodgings with cheerful familiarity, for she had called upon us frequently since the resolution of her case. Seeing our client, however, she stopped short with a courteous apology for her intrusion; Mrs. Jennings, who had at first frowned at the interruption, appeared mollified. The news Miss Morstan had to communicate was as delightful as its bearer: my assistant had informed her that my two afternoon patients had cancelled their appointments: I might therefore spend the rest of the day at my leisure. I thanked her warmly for her trouble, and promised to call upon her as soon as I was able. With a nod to Holmes and a smile at me, she withdrew from the room.
“Certainly not. And yet, if one ignores the overblown and quixotic, the substance of the tales is nonetheless instructive. The same might be said, incidentally, of your stories in the
“I would advise you not to go home in the meantime,” Holmes cautioned. “I endeavoured to conceal the absence of these files with empty covers and blank paper from an adjacent office, but your husband may already have noticed that they are gone.”
He blinked.
“No!” Sherlock pants, seeming to recover himself. “No, that was good. Don’t stop.” He lies down again and grabs John’s hand, but John resists.
“It is possible that her husband married her for her fortune, rather than for love,” I offered. “That may explain why he is tempted to seek his pleasure elsewhere.”
I met Victor by chance when he dropped by to discuss the case with Sherlock. I’d been visiting Sherlock a lot that week for one reason or another, and so I happened to be at 221b when he came. It seems that he and Sherlock got together in their fourth year after Sherlock was bitten by Victor’s pet snake (while trying to extract its venom, no less). I can’t believe Sherlock never told me this! They “had some good times together” (Victor’s words, not Sherlock’s), split amicably and have been in touch on and off ever since. They seemed to be on very good terms.
He patted my knee in awkward acknowledgement, and rose to fetch the
After dinner, Holmes took up his Stradivarius, and I settled into my armchair with rising anticipation. When he can be persuaded to play, rather than sawing over the bridge and fingerboard like a recalcitrant schoolboy, I would not trade my seat for the prime place in any concert hall in London. As he swept his bow experimentally across the open strings, I allowed myself, more fully than ever, to appreciate the lean grace of his body: its lines and curves – so different from a woman’s - and the delicate precision of his movements. His music, however, soon drew me in, and then even desire was forgotten. Holmes played Bach as if he were alone upon a cathedral spire; he played Mendelssohn as though a hundred-piece orchestra were at his back, lending thunder to his crescendos and carving rough contours above which his melody could soar. There was no artifice in his performance, and he held nothing back. I did not realise how I was staring at him until the last notes had died away and he had dropped his gaze to his instrument, apparently disconcerted by my silence.
“You will do no such thing!” I exclaimed, surprising us both with my vehemence. Then, without further thought, I added, “Holmes, have you not considered that
“Why ever not? I’ve been told that it’s perfectly normal for close friends to discuss their sexual experiences, man-to-man.”
Yeah, we kissed, okay? I’m not giving the details, because this blog is only rated teen-and-up.
“Do you imagine that I care? The wording of the newspaper reports suggests that it is a groundless rumour, propagated by her husband in order to discredit her. I put this view to Agatha, but she insists…”
He shrugged. “As I said, the case was simple enough. And, for the rest, I merely obeyed my own sense of justice. On reflection, I found that I was more willing to condone infidelity and indecency than blackmail. I am glad that you agree.”
“I’m not…”
,” Sherlock brandishes his injured hand, distractedly. “I
Sherlock assured me that my concern was unnecessary: he’d be working with an old acquaintance from university. A bloke called Victor. Maybe it was the name, but my mind instantly conjured up a picture of some Oxbridge Adonis – single, early thirties, athletic, as tall as Sherlock perhaps, with dark, shoulder-length hair. As it turned out, that wasn’t far off the mark.
“No indeed!”
“Not necessarily,” John says, then repeats it with more conviction. “Actually, no. But I need to know that you’re really serious. I mean, a minute ago we were joking about it all being an experiment, and I know it’s more than that, but marriage is a whole different ball game.” He swallows hard. “I
At these words, my coffee cup slipped from my fingers. It struck my knee, bounced to the floor, and spilled half its contents down my trouser leg. Holmes was at my side in an instant, mopping up the scalding liquid with his sleeve before it could soak through the cloth. For half a minute we scrambled to save the furniture and rug from yet another unwieldy stain. Crisis past, we found ourselves kneeling a mere foot apart before the fireplace, regarding each other intently.
I risked a glance at him. He was examining the contents of his glass, tilting it back and forth in the firelight. “Mary Morstan loved you very well, just as you are. The same applies, no doubt, to the ladies who took liberties with your clothing this afternoon.”
Returning home from my professional rounds one morning, I was surprised to find Holmes sprawled in his armchair, reading a novel. My surprise was all the greater when I saw the book’s cover: it featured a pirate, balanced precariously upon the bow of a ship, one arm around the waist of a singularly buxom young lady, whose expression of vacant adoration strained credulity, given her immediate danger of tumbling backwards into the waves. Holmes was evidently several chapters into the tale, and was reading with avid attention. Four more books of a similar ilk were stacked at his feet.
,” he gasped, even as our noses collided painfully.
I had not led a sheltered life. I had served in the army, and witnessed many things that I did not speak of on my return to London society. Inversion, however, was a matter to which I had given but cursory thought. I had considered it to be the result of a misdirected animal passion: man humping man as one goat might ride upon another, for no reason other than propinquity. The notion that genuine attraction, or, indeed, feelings of a more tender nature, might lie behind the act, was wholly new to me. Once it had taken root in my mind, it ceased to shock and began to intrigue me.
“Oh, for God’s sake, John!” Sherlock huffs, grabbing John’s hand and placing in unceremoniously on his half-hard cock. “You’ll never know unless you try.”
" I have related the substance of the following events, so I will not repeat them in their entirety here. To return briefly, however, to the subject of evasions in my narrative: I believed, when I wrote the tale, that my style of writing was sober and restrained, yet rereading it never fails to set my blood racing. I cannot help but wonder, in complete accord with Holmes, how my readers can fail to
It was more of a battle than a kiss. Holmes plainly had no idea what he was doing, nor desire to stop and learn. I struggled for a better angle, digging my fingers into his shoulder blades as he clutched at my shirt. “
Their kiss is gentle at first, but charged with meaning. It doesn’t make John forget his wariness of physical attraction to another man, but the reality of Sherlock’s slight stubble and broad shoulders – the
“That’s just as well,” John says drily. He picks his way towards the bed. “You do have… er… “
“We’ve done all of that,” he retorted, archly.
“It was, in the end, a very simple affair,” Holmes replied. “The difficulty will lie in exploiting what we have learned to bring about a satisfactory resolution. You will first wish to consult with Miss Warrens, who has, I believe, been waiting for you on the street corner this past half hour.”
“Because sexuality doesn’t work like that.”
“There is a difference,” he said, tightly. “I can touch her, as I touched you, to achieve a given effect. But most physical contact between lovers is a spontaneous expression of their desire for intimacy. I cannot feign that convincingly, nor respond as I ought to when she places her hands upon me.”
’ when you came home, although goodness knows why. Cleaning up after me instead is an act of friendship that I appreciate.”
Sherlock nods. “I propose six steps, although when listed they do sound somewhat crude and pedestrian…”
I wondered, hazily, if I would ever be able to let him go.
“Innocent?” Jennings repeated, dropping the folder onto the table. “How, then, do you explain their frequency and duration?”
“During the brief time that Mrs. Jennings was in our sitting room, I perceived a number of subtle indicators which, taken together, presented a suggestive picture. A particular motion of her eyes, and the places in which they lingered. The dilation of her pupils. Subtle alterations in her breathing. The reorientation of her body towards an object of her appreciation. In short, indicators of sexual attraction.”
John gives a startled laugh, and Sherlock scowls at him. “As I said, they sound…”
I hoped that he would elaborate, but in this, as so often, I was disappointed. He merely smiled and took up his violin, commencing an energetic sonata that forestalled any further questioning on my part. “We shall need our wits about us tonight, my dear Watson. We are treading upon delicate ground.”
than a one-time lover who bolted at a clap of thunder and refused to risk his heart.”
“Well, what are you aiming for?” I persisted. “Should it be romantic? Passionate? Forceful? Sensuous? Seductive?”
“I have but one more,” Holmes prevaricated smoothly. “I should like to know your maiden name.”
“Of course, my dear fellow. As long as you need.”
Perhaps he had already detected more than he cared to: his gaze returned to the equipment in his hands. “You intend to call upon Miss Morstan, I presume.”
“Women, I have observed, often become restless when they are alone,” Turpin opined, with the air of an indulgent connoisseur. “They yearn for the companionship of others of their sex.”
“Flirtatious?” Sherlock suggests.
I had several patients to visit that afternoon, and their complaints were severe enough to warrant my full attention. I confess, however, that my thoughts returned frequently to Holmes, and to our freshly laid plans for the evening. I did not regret my impetuous offer to instruct him. On the contrary, I was happy to be of service: it was rare that my knowledge of any relevant subject exceeded his. I was also excessively curious. Holmes’ sharp intellect and masterful personality held their own fascination; I had observed the effects on several of our female clients, who called at Baker Street upon the flimsiest of pretexts, long after their cases were resolved. Yet, he had always appeared more perplexed than gratified by this unwanted proof of his charms. He made no active effort to please anybody. To witness my aloof, talented friend in the role of a suitor, for the first time in his life, and under my instruction, was an intriguing prospect.
“This is not your usual choice of reading material,” I remarked, when no explanation seemed forthcoming.
We had come to the point without any great effort, after all. I touched his hand. “Certain of what?”
“I am aware of it, my dear fellow,” I remarked, somewhat impatiently.
But it turned out that he had someone else in mind. As he informed me in his usual delicate way: “I can’t go with you, John. Nobody would believe for a second that we’re together.”
see no reason to further consider the subject.”
“Nevertheless, all that I’ve read upon the subject… whatever are you laughing at, John?... My extensive
Sherlock’s lips are warm and tender.
“Agatha is an incurable romantic, not unlike you.” His grimace was half-hearted at best. “She believes it is a case of sentiment run wild.”
This request, I was certain, would be the last straw for Holmes, who in general despises surveillance work unless it affords ample scope for deduction as well as observation. I believe he was on the point of refusing the case when a diversion occurred: the young lady whom I was courting, Miss Mary Morstan, entered the room.
“You’re missing the point! I’m saying I don’t want to
We did not move again beyond small gestures, such as a caress of the shoulder in passing, or an arm about the waist as we sat close together upon the sofa. Holmes initiated the contact as often as I. At times it was awkward; at others, I caught my breath at how natural it felt to interact with him in this way. We did not discuss it. In truth, I preferred not to question what might happen once the case was resolved and my “instruction” no longer required.
“I have made a copy of the entry in question,” she replied, holding out a slip of paper. “‘
“Touch me,” I said, and his fingers returned to the nape of my neck, sending sparks of electricity down my spine. I caught his other hand and placed it on my waist. “Tell me what you want.”
Then they lie down, and Sherlock starts to touch John, one-handed, everywhere except for his groin. His touch is exploratory; he varies between the tips of his fingers and the palm of his hand, his tongue, lips and teeth, changing the pressure and the pace. It’s odd, and not entirely erotic, but rather intense. Unused to lying back passively, John rests his hand on Sherlock’s arm, feeling the muscles flex as Sherlock moves over him. He looks into his eyes - narrowed with concentration as Sherlock tests his reactions - and feels a slow, prickling arousal at being the focus of that fierce intelligence and attention.
John shifts his kisses to Sherlock’s jaw and then his neck, losing himself in the warm, familiar scent of him, and the salty skin beneath his lips. When he touches the tip of his tongue to Sherlock’s pulse point, Sherlock’s breathing becomes ragged, and John pushes him gently onto his back, letting go of his cock for a moment in favour of running both hands up his chest and pressing kisses to his throat. John’s fingers reach Sherlock’s taut nipples and he squeezes gently; Sherlock groans and thrusts up against him… and then suddenly Sherlock is scrambling into a sitting position, overbalancing as he tries to put weight on his injured hand, his eyes wide with shock.
My final prescription signed, I made my way homeward with a flutter of anticipation beneath my sternum. It was something of a let-down, upon entering our lodgings, to find the fire lit but the sitting room empty.
Returning to character, I took the arm he offered, and we walked the few paces up and down the room together.
“Only one: Joanna Warrens, my maid of honour.” Mrs. Jennings pursed her lips, then added, with some asperity, “I assume that there is a purpose to these questions?”
“You are too much on edge,” I told him, fighting my own urge to fidget under his gaze. “This will come more naturally if we are engaged in conversation.”
“Undoubtedly it would, if I had any to draw upon.”
“At least in
“Your talents are wasted on Agatha,” I muttered, nonsensically, against his shoulder.
“Sherlock, please tell me you’re not suggesting I have sex with another man just to find out how straight I am.”
I swallowed hard against the ache of emotion. Overt praise from Holmes was rare; in such a moment it could not fail to affect me.
Holmes smiled. “Very true. Her oscillation upon the pavement is not quite consistent with her subsequent conduct or with the story she has presented to us. A woman seeking revenge upon a man who has wronged her thus does not hesitate – why should she? However, this is not the feature of her case that most interests me.”
“Why?”
This is clearly neither a new nor a welcome idea to Sherlock. “Don’t think, just feel,” he parodies, with a grimace. “That seems to be fairly common advice on websites for the sexually uninitiated. But I didn’t realise losing control was a
Although I did not see what help we might provide, beyond our discretion, I trusted that he had some reason for insisting upon a confession. It was no easy matter for our client, however: although Holmes had spoken gently, she turned pale at his words. The slightest suspicion of sexual impropriety could destroy her reputation in an instant; it was likewise a subject so intimate that an admission to two male strangers must have seemed abhorrent to her. As her silence persisted, my sympathy for her predicament grew acute, and I looked to my friend in a wordless plea for clemency.
I stared at him, dumbfounded.
“No! Well, obviously not
He laughed. “I dare say that, when I left home this morning, I knew rather less about the subject than you. However, with borrowed tools I was able to effect some temporary repairs. This was only possible, I might add, once I had conducted an extensive examination of the house and grounds.”
Sherlock’s experiments are often noisy, messy or otherwise unpleasant, but to be fair he generally has them under control. This evening proves an exception: a loud crack, followed by a yelp of pain, brings John running downstairs to the kitchen, where he finds his flatmate surveying the smoking ruins of his attempt to accelerate the ageing of stainless steel. The cheese grater has shattered, and several pieces of it are now embedded in Sherlock’s hand. “Stupid!” is Sherlock’s only comment, with an expression of profound self-disgust, and then, holding out his bleeding hand: “John, would you mind?”
“Yes. Well.” John ties off the thread. “You’re not always this cooperative.”
. They stare at each other for a long moment in silence.
“What purpose?”
So, this is my first blog update for a while. It’s been hard to find the time. As most of you know, earlier this year I became the proud father of a beautiful little girl! And, as if she wasn’t enough to keep me occupied, Britain’s most wanted criminal mastermind made another appearance! But now something else has happened, and this seems the easiest way to tell you all. It even involves a case, of sorts.
Sherlock’s injured arm is flung out beside him, but his good hand is still gripping John’s waist with painful force. Acting on instinct, John prizes it off and stretches Sherlock’s arm above his head, pinning him down and intertwining their fingers. Sherlock’s face goes slack, and his whole body arches out of rhythm. “John,
“I’m glad you think so.” His tone was dry, but he tugged at his shirt with uncharacteristic self-consciousness. I smiled in encouragement, but he turned away to peer out of the window at the darkening street.
He had no need of my instruction, now. As he worked his tongue slowly, exquisitely, between my lips, I surrendered all control, letting him caress and explore me. He groaned into my mouth, and my desire throbbed hot and deep. My prick swelled tightly against my trousers; I shifted, desperate for relief, and then his fingers were there, unfastening the buttons and easing my underclothes down my legs. He leaned in, pressing against my side as he took my prick in his hand. Discomfort dissolved into aching pleasure at his touch. He stroked me slowly, almost meditatively, yet I could hardly catch my breath.
“Now I
The storm outside, the howling wind and the lash of rain against the window, all seemed but a distant counterpoint to the gentle pressure of his hand and the passion rising within me. Pleasure spiralled inexorably at each motion of his fingers. I buried my face against his shoulder to stifle my moans. His lips and tongue caressed my neck, his breath hot against my dampened skin, and then he stroked me harder, faster, and nothing else mattered but his closeness. I pulled him on top of me and thrust up against him, craving connection in every inch that our bodies touched. He ground his hips downwards in answer, and ecstasy coursed through me in waves, splitting me open as I clung to him.
His low voice, close to my ear, sent shivers down my spine, even before I registered his words. He had spoken my Christian name as though he had done so every day of our lives, but this was the first time that he had ever addressed me in this intimate way. Astonishment and hope flared sharply in my chest, but before I could speak he pulled back as though burnt, turning his face away. His cheeks were flushed.
“You clearly have some ethical concerns,” Sherlock says slowly, “but the main issue here is that you’re not interested in the idea of sex with a hypothetical male partner, however attractive he might hypothetically be.”
“Roll up your sleeves,” I instructed my friend.
“You made me a declaration just now, which I fear was met with monosyllabic ineloquence on my part,” he said, smiling faintly. “John, I have wanted you since the moment we met, and have been in love with you for almost as long. I did not always care to admit it,” he added, his voice dropping lower as I stepped again into the circle of his arms. “I took the case in part out of desperation, as a last opportunity to test your sentiments before your marriage.”
“I imagine that she has examined his private diary,” Holmes interjected, before she could speak. “Your husband is a lawyer, madam: the card you left with our housekeeper indicates the address of his firm on Chancery Lane. Given his profession, he often works at unusual hours: his absence from the house would not, therefore, be cause for suspicion. You speak with conviction, so you have some other evidence that you consider persuasive enough to justify my involvement. It is not tangible: had you found a locket of hair, or a trinket, you would have brought it with you and produced it immediately. Your hesitation suggests that it was obtained by underhand methods. A stolen glance into a private diary is the most probable explanation.”
Never let it be supposed that Sherlock Holmes, when committed to a case, will leave a single stone unturned in his efforts to resolve it. Over the following days we barely saw each other, for he spent almost every free hour in Hampstead. Whenever we did coincide in our lodgings, however, we continued to touch.
“I told you this morning that something unusual about Mrs. Jennings had caught my attention. Had you forgotten?”
Turpin blinked rather stupidly and cleared his throat. “You were right to consult me as you did, sir. I am delighted that, in this instance, your fears have proved unfounded. The virtue of your charming wife is beyond question. Should you ever again have cause for suspicion, you may rely upon me to throw light on the affair.”
“Then why stop?”
“Could you not work up some fondness for her?”
friend – on such a subject. Have you considered the form that your instruction would take?”
He turned towards me, startled, his gaze flickering from my flushed face to my clenched fingers. “You are quite emotional, Watson. The romantic in you seeks yet again to cast me as a hero. But you must be aware that our client and her lover have little chance of a truly happy ending.”
With a look of surprise, he complied, refastening the cuffs about his elbows. At my further suggestion, he undid his top button, tucked his shirttails into his belt and, following a brief dispute on the relative merits of authenticity and aesthetic appeal, exchanged his ample trousers for a more snugly fitting pair. As a final touch, we arranged his hair so that one dark curl fell artlessly across his forehead. I then stood back to inspect our handiwork, with what I hoped would pass for disinterested approval.
“Rather, I should say, you have no need of it.”
“I concluded that I’m not gay, Sherlock,” he says at last.
“At St. Stephen’s, in Hampstead.”
I gasped and shivered as he removed my shirt, until his hot mouth teased over the exposed skin of my shoulder, and an answering heat rose within me wherever his lips touched. His fingers on my bare chest caressed, circled and squeezed until I lost focus and could only clutch at his waist and pant against his cheek. But then I found the wherewithal to slide my hands into his back trouser pockets and pull him towards me, and his knees almost gave way as he melted against me.
“My dear boy, you appear positively scandalised!” He clasped my elbow to help me to my feet, making a visible effort to reign in his glee. “To preserve our friendship, I should explain that my invitation to wed Agatha comes from her father, not from the lady herself. You will no doubt acknowledge the distinction, although many would consider the consent of a daughter to be a secondary consideration in such a case.”
“Her motives are just as underhand as mine,” Holmes continued, quickly. “She hopes to prompt my rival into a declaration, and believes that the sight of me kissing her will arouse in him the requisite jealousy and possessiveness.”
There, I’ve said it. You know where this is heading. Please spare me the ‘I told you so’s (in fact, I’ll disable the comments for this post).
? All his experience gleaned from short-term relationships with women seems irrelevant when faced with this man who’s become the undisputed centre of his universe. The second possible outcome of their experiment is suddenly foremost in his mind. He desires Sherlock – can’t believe he ever doubted that – but what if Sherlock doesn’t, or can’t, desire him?
Thanks for reading! :-)
“And you yourself were attended by bridesmaids, no doubt?”
“22 Curzon Street is the home of a Miss Joanna Warrens,” Turpin prevaricated. “She is a well-respected spinster who lives alone, and whom I have determined to be an old schoolfriend of your wife’s. I have watched the house around the clock, but have not observed any gentleman enter or leave; nor have the neighbours seen any stranger in the vicinity. My conclusion is therefore that your wife is
He fixed me with a look of open curiosity, but asked no further questions. It was just as well: I already felt as if the evening’s exertions had stripped away my defences, leaving me raw and overexposed. I needed time to recover my equilibrium. It was unacceptable that a little play acting should have stirred up my feelings to this extent. We did not speak again for the remainder of the evening, and by the time I rose the next morning, he had already left for Hampstead.
“Holmes?” I called.
“You have been married for some five years,” he said to our client, his sharp eyes skimming her wedding ring.
“What do you talk about with Agatha?”
the house during my wife’s visits?”
The afternoon sun had long since been smothered by a greying mist, and the room was chilly, although I had scarcely noticed it until that moment. I scraped together the coals in the fireplace, then took several pages from Turpin’s report and tore them vindictively into strips before setting the whole lot ablaze. I believe that all three of us felt the warmer and the brighter for it: we smiled at each other like mischievous children as the flames rose and the sparks crackled against the chimneypiece.
John speeds up a little, keeping as much contact between them as he can and willing Sherlock not to panic. He’s slick with sweat now as well as lube, but the angle is perfect. Sherlock’s breath stutters, and a moment later John feels the force of his orgasm everywhere they touch. He’s hardly even aware of his own physical pleasure: it's subsumed by his overwhelming desire to draw the moment out forever, and to feel every inch of Sherlock’s trembling body against his. Even once Sherlock relaxes completely, sinking into the mattress with an exhausted sigh, John can’t bring himself to let him go. But he pulls back slightly to look at him: Sherlock’s pale face is flushed and his hair is in disarray, his lips swollen and parted. His eyes focus on John with an expression of awe and confusion, and a vulnerability that makes John’s chest ache.
“It was not the most compelling of our adventures,” I agreed, flushing despite myself at his choice of words. He was regarding me with that razor-sharp attention that he generally directed towards the muddy footprints around a corpse. I reminded myself how abruptly his interest would dissipate if he divined my thoughts; I had so often heard him speak of emotion as an irksome flaw in the human psyche.
Sherlock’s lips twitch upwards. “It’s fortunate, then, that I’m practically ambidextrous.” And he raises his uninjured left hand and trails the tips his fingers gently down John’s cheek.
Don’t you just love the Victorians? They’re so eloquent and poetic, and such fun to write! :-)
Had I not registered the almost imperceptible frown that creased his forehead, I would have dismissed the matter as a joke. As it was, I set down my medical bag and seated myself - hat, coat and all - in the armchair opposite him.
“I’m not embarrassed. I’m just not used to you… you know. Being so appreciative.”
He looked up with a quizzical frown and, in part to cover my utter inability to finish my sentence, I crossed the room and took him into my arms.
embarrassing you,” Sherlock says, sounding inordinately pleased.
,” I remarked, eying the weighty tomes he had discarded upon the table. “But Holmes, such tales are hardly… Would not real-life experience be a better guide?”
For about a minute Sherlock appears undecided. John forces himself to stay quiet and give him space. But then: “I suppose we could try that,” Sherlock mutters at last. “As an experiment.” He turns his gaze to the ceiling, the frown of determination settling back over his face. John can practically hear the command “let go!” resonating through his mind like a mantra.
His cheek was now pressed to mine, so I felt, rather than saw, his smile. “Then let me confess, John, that you have distracted me too thoroughly to care about the etiquette.”
“That was truly well done,” I said at last, in a low voice.
“That is a pity,” I remarked. “Applied to one’s own concerns, such powers must be infinitely more valuable. Many would-be lovers would give their right arm for the ability to gauge the state of another person’s affections.”
Mrs. Jennings was now regarding him with a touch of awe; her former reserve had all but melted away. “I am truly astounded at how much you have accomplished,” she said. “I cannot ever thank you, or your friend, enough. With one evening’s work, you have freed me from troubles that had tormented me for almost a decade.”
“Go on, then,” John prompts, after a moment’s silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Concurrently with, I hope,” Sherlock corrects him. “And I think the list might need expanding.”
“Then I do not very well see what is to be done,” I mused. “The husband is the wronged party, after all. He will surely persist in gathering evidence until he has created a scandal.”
I frowned at the images which this latter remark conjured in my mind. “Is she not a pretty girl?” I enquired. “Do you not wish to touch her?”
Then: “You are extraordinarily patient,” Sherlock remarks.
Over the next few days, Holmes came and went at all hours in his plumber’s outfit. His reports on the case were characteristically cryptic, but I learned that his progress with Agatha was unremarkable: she had accepted him into her court, but had not yet accorded him her exclusive attention. He chafed at the want of opportunities; for my part, I struggled to comprehend how, after so many hours in her company, my friend could fail to impress this girl more deeply than a crowd of adolescent layabouts. I did not envy her his insincere attentions. I convinced myself that his long absences were a matter of indifference to me. Yet I fear that Holmes and I were both short-tempered with each other that week. This continued until the fourth day of his campaign, when he unexpectedly addressed the subject.
ask me to kiss her,” he muttered in the direction of his boots. “I did not realise until this morning that I could extract the information I needed in any other way.”
“What else would it be?” His tone implied that the question was both ludicrous and mildly offensive. “I must remove Lady Blackwell’s letters from Milverton’s house. A flirtation with his housemaid is the safest plan that I can conceive to obtain information on the layout of Appledore, and the habits of its occupants.”
None of this, in itself, is worthy of remark: it is not unheard of for a woman of wealth and connections to marry a poorer man. However, I also ascertained – and here you must forgive my indelicacy - that you did not care for him. You will recall that I asked you about your wedding. It was plain to me from your manner of speaking that the memory was a source of aggravation rather than pleasure to you. I also noted, as it is my profession to note, that your… preferences in a partner… lay in another direction.”
“I do not wish to make you uncomfortable,” he murmured, his thumb caressing my wrist. “This must be very different from your interactions with women.”
me like you just did.” He takes Sherlock’s hand and kisses it, tasting his own come on Sherlock’s fingers. A fierce, indefinable emotion is churning in his chest. “There’s no limit to what you can do.”
tried out our conversation in my head, but I didn’t expect to reach this point so soon. In reality you never say or do quite what I expect you to.”
“There are certain features in a space such as this which must appeal, consciously or not, to anyone planning an illicit rencontre,” he explained in a low voice. “Seclusion is of course required, as is dim lighting and an excellent view of the door. In this half of the room the tables are spaced at least five inches further apart than in the other, and observe how low these candles burn! I anticipated that our man would seat himself here, even before he had moved in this direction.”
“Holmes, this is no laughing matter!”
“Don’t try this with Agatha,” I panted at last, sliding my hand from his hips to the front of his trousers, where his erection was pressing against my stomach. Heart pounding, I palmed him slowly, and he moaned, splaying his fingers against the wall. Then I dropped to my knees and kissed him there, between his legs, breathing in the heady scent of him, intensifying it as I dampened the fabric with my breath and tongue. His hips jerked forward and he clenched his fists in an effort to hold himself still.
It’s easy for John to read Sherlock’s emotions because they mirror his own. For a moment he feels completely out of his depth. The coward in him longs to deflect this with a joke – his usual joke about people who might talk. He resists, because he owes Sherlock more than that. But the alternative is frankly terrifying. He never talks about his feelings, and neither does Sherlock, which is presumably why he seduced him this way. The “experiment” gave them both the chance to set aside the weight of expectations and lower the emotional stakes. Maybe that’s still the best approach, even now.
When he says my name, his voice resonates through all the bones in my body.
that I choose, whatever the outcome of this conversation,” I murmured, raising his hand to my lips. “Say something, Holmes,
The air seemed to vanish from my lungs. This was different – formidably different - from sitting back and allowing him to practise his skills upon me. He was watching me closely, his expression guarded. Before I could second guess myself, I shifted towards him, and angled my knees so that they brushed against his.
“Which one of us is the romantic now?” I teased. “Were you expecting a passionate embrace, or a candlelit serenade, and one of us on his knees?”
Absolutely nothing happened at the club that night. I sat and watched Sherlock dance with Victor, had a mid-life crisis, then went home. And the next morning, I separated from Mary. We’re getting a divorce.
The truth was that I had, myself, experienced physical appreciation towards other men. I had had close male friends for whom I would have laid down my life in an instant. For a former commander I had felt an admiration that bordered upon infatuation. Yet any indication that such feelings might take me beyond the realm of friendship, or any desire on my part to express them through sexual acts, I had dismissed as a momentary lapse in judgement. It only now occurred to me that this attraction had been equally poignant, and not substantially different in nature, to that which I had ever felt towards women.
In response, John presses in harder, and Sherlock clutches his waist convulsively. Then, hooking a leg behind Sherlock’s calf, John carefully aligns them and starts to rock his hips. The movement is familiar, but everything else is new and exquisite: the slide of Sherlock’s erection against his, the thick scent of his arousal, the strength and the pliancy of his body. It’s one of the most intimate things John has ever experienced. Having come already, he feels no urgency, unlike Sherlock, who is soon pushing erratically up against him. “Focus on me.” John murmurs. “Stay with me.” And Sherlock starts to match his rhythm, engulfing them both in a giddy rush of sensation. John longs to whisper encouragement, but isn’t sure whether that would help or distract him. He settles for nuzzling his throat and jaw, until Sherlock twists his head and meets his lips in a breathless, open-mouthed kiss.
“Yes, some friends of my husband’s.”
“Oh, no. Perish the thought.”
“Don’t worry: Victor went home,” he said (just slightly bitterly?) as I walked in, but then his eyes flicked over my face and down to my bare ring finger, and he went very still.
.” He underlines his words by shifting forwards until their foreheads are touching, and slinging his arm around John’s waist, pulling him closer still. “I don’t even believe in marriage, in general, but with you it’s the next logical step.”
unforgivable.” I regarded him slyly from the corner of my eye. “Particularly as my last lesson appears to have been in vain.”
suggests that a profession of eternal devotion and, perhaps, one chaste kiss upon the lips, would be fitting in such a moment.”
“Then, if you do not object, I’d like to extend our lesson.”

“I have no need to spy: a single glance reveals to me that at least two other persons are paying you court. Shall I tell you how I know this?”
There is a long, shocked pause. “Tried… being gay?” John says at last, his tone implying that he finds the idea highly improbable.
Sherlock is watching him closely. “John, I think it might be easier for us both if I touch you first,” he suggests.
I must here confess that Holmes’ expression of withering contempt at this latter speech obliged me to cover my face with my handkerchief for several minutes to smother my laughter. Holmes watched me cough and splutter, a smile tugging at his own lips. “It is not so very amusing, Watson,” he admonished. “You would not be so well entertained if you were dependent on Turpin to ‘throw light’ upon your own affairs! But we have obtained the information we came for. Let us move to another table, where we will draw less attention to ourselves. Jennings intends to dine here, I see, so we will have ample time to enjoy the
John looks down at him, trying to calm his own racing thoughts. He feels shocked himself, and guilty and slightly hurt. But then he remembers Sherlock’s involuntary groan and the twitch of his body, and has a glimmer of understanding. “When I touched you, it made you react in a way you didn’t expect – is that it?”
“Screw scientific rigour,” John agrees, giddy and ecstatic and completely unable to stop smiling. “Only with you. And…um… that includes the part about the relationship, if that’s what you want.”
“You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?”
Later that day, immaculately attired in evening dress, Holmes and I stood at the corner where Duke Street runs into Grosvenor Square, some three hundred yards away from our client’s home. The night was cold; our breath froze in the air between us, and although we had not been waiting above an hour, my injured shoulder had already begun to ache. I did not, however, regret for a moment that I had accompanied my friend. A frisson of anticipation passed through me when the clock struck a half past seven, and, turning to Holmes, I saw an answering gleam in his eyes. When adventure beckoned we were, as always, in perfect accord.
“You are too hasty, Watson,” he interjected, his voice calm, though strained. “Based upon the insights of a single day, you are reevaluating all your current relationships. Your opinions will soon settle, and then you will wish these words unspoken.”
“‘Was’ being the operative word,” I remarked pointedly, glancing at the folders on the table.
what is motivating my wife in these afternoon visits.”
“It is
. John closes his eyes. “I’m quite happy as I am, thank you.”
“I do not object.” I licked my lips. “In fact ...”
“I was tested last month after that incident at the undertaker’s,” Sherlock says. He shovels the last of his papers unceremoniously onto the floor. “Clean. And you are too, so if you agree we can dispense with condoms until step six. I did buy some lubricant, though. Look.” He retrieves an assortment of bottles from his pocket and holds them out for John’s inspection.
We duly relocated to the opposite part of the room, where I continued to reflect with amusement on the denouement of an affair that Holmes had considered so promising. It was rare indeed for his instinct to fail him. I could not help but ask if he were not disappointed. “For, far from the intrigue you had foreseen, there appears to be nothing more to this business than mutual misunderstanding,” I mused. “The wife suspects that the husband is unfaithful; the husband suspects the wife, and both are happily mistaken”.
We lay panting, cheek to cheek, tight in each other’s arms. I ran my fingers through his sweat-damp hair, and pressed my lips to his temple.
“I… any of that.” His breaths were coming faster; he raised his hands distractedly to my arms before dropping them to his sides.
Mrs. Jennings flushed. “My motivations are my own affair. Will you, or will you not, be able to assist me?”
He turned at last to face me, and looked so much his usual self – sharp and self-contained, if somewhat agitated – that I could scarcely believe what had just occurred. My racing heart stumbled with the momentary dread that I had, once again, been carried away by our play acting. Yet, there was something in his voice that convinced me the situation was as complicated for him as it had become for me. I straightened my shoulders, and attempted a smile.
“Agatha did not prove to be a very reliable friend,” I remarked, after a moment’s pause. “She told you that Milverton would be sleeping at this hour.”
, in a way I hadn’t seen him look for a very long time. It always melts my heart a bit when he drops his mask and shows some human feeling. Just seeing what he
“I intend to introduce myself to Agatha – that is, the housemaid – as she returns from Hampstead market tomorrow morning,” he said. “From what I have observed of her interactions thus far, I believe that self-assurance bordering on arrogance is the quality most appealing to her in a suitor.”
“John…”
“You exaggerate beyond bounds, as ever, Watson,” he replied, scowling into the fireplace. “But if you truly wish for my opinion, you shall have it: I am in no doubt that Miss Morstan returns your sentiments.”
Sherlock fixes him with the unblinking, analytical gaze he generally directs at tobacco ash. John does his best to meet that gaze defiantly, because this is absolutely
“Do you imagine that she intentionally misinformed me?” His brow furrowed. “It is not impossible: my questions were rather pointed, and she is astute, in her own way. But most likely she was unaware of her employer’s late-night rendezvous. I should have foreseen it. I was unforgivably distracted.”
I stared at him incredulously. “You wish to talk about the weather
The next morning, I confess that I rose several hours later than was my custom. On leaving the restaurant, I had succeeded in catching up with Holmes before many minutes had elapsed, and we had followed Jennings as far as Chancery Lane. Although I was unsure of the purpose of our expedition, I had the greatest faith in Holmes’ sagacity, and was more than content to wait, pressed close beside him in the dark space between two gas lamps, while Jennings entered his office (with Turpin’s brown folder tucked under his arm) and exited (without the folder) a short while later. Holmes had then picked the lock and searched the building while I stood guard outside. When he emerged, his coat was bulging with what appeared to be an entire shelf’s worth of stolen files. I immediately relieved him of the heavier items, despite the fact that he refused to enlighten me as to their content, and we roamed the street until we could find a hansom cab to take us home.
She regarded him in surprise. “Very nearly. I was married on the ninth of November, 1883.”
“… and our way ahead is clear!” I anticipated, eagerly.
A few minutes later, John has him sitting by the bathroom sink with swabs and towels, a large bottle of saline solution and a pair of tweezers, and has started the painstaking task of cleaning him up, testing for nerve damage and extracting the embedded metal. Sherlock appears to have retreated into his mind palace, responding mechanically to John’s requests and barely flinching as John probes his wounds. For a while they sit in companionable silence.
“She would not long resist you, if you did.”
“On the contrary, it is obscured by a veritable thunderhead of moral ambiguity,” he corrected me cheerfully. “Settle the bill would you, my good fellow? I believe I know where he is heading, but he may yet surprise us.” And before I could recover from my own surprise, he had sprung to his feet, seized his coat, and strode from the room amid a swirl of black fabric.
you to pose as my boyfriend. You’d have thrown a fit, refused outright, and spent the next two days reaffirming your heterosexuality at every opportunity.” He might have had a point.
Mrs. Jennings gave an exclamation of concern and hurried to the window. “Oh, indeed! I told her that I would return within twenty minutes. How I must have worried her!” She hastily gathered up her cloak and hat. “You will excuse me, gentlemen? We will discuss the alternatives that you have presented to me, and return tomorrow to consult with you further.”
Taking the base of his prick in my hand, I lowered my head.
to be precise.”
“In Agatha’s case, I doubt that much subtlety will be required,” he replied, morosely. “But the advice is apt. Perhaps I might suggest that she conserve some body heat, by taking my arm. May I?”
“I’m… interesting?” John asks, skeptically.
“There speaks the romantic in you.”
He did so, and it was warm and tremulous, and brilliant and tender and
Our dealings with the notorious blackmailer Charles Augustus Milverton are now public knowledge; however, I omitted several details from my published account of the case. While the identity of Milverton’s killer is a subject of intense speculation among readers of the
“They were inconclusive,” he answered, jaw clenched, and then all at once his stormy eyes were full upon mine. “If you must know, I received the impression that you were less strongly attracted to Miss Morstan than you were to
When I was intimate with women, their response to me, and the pleasure that I could bring them, interested me more than my own completion. With Holmes, whose every word and gesture had long been my obsession, the fascination was acute. I took his balls in my hand and gently rubbed and squeezed him, pressing hot kisses to his prick. His hips jerked uncontrollably and he moaned my name. Steadying him with my free hand, I took his length into my mouth and watched, mesmerised, as the tension shifted throughout his body: his face slackening, stomach clenching, hips straining towards me. A few experimental twists of my tongue had him writhing beneath me. He was close to the edge: too close for me to tease him, so I hollowed my cheeks and slipped my other hand downwards to press against his perineum. With a startled cry, he climaxed into my mouth, leaving me choking and spluttering like the novice that I was.
“We do indeed,” Holmes replied, with an amused glance at me. “But I fear that it will not be to your liking. You asked us to prove that your husband is unfaithful to you. Our investigation last night revealed evidence of a rather different nature.”
“Quite so,” Holmes replied, flashing me a grin. “Dr. Watson and I liberated the evidence in question from your husband’s office yesterday evening. Seven years of detectives’ reports on your visits to Curzon Street are now at your disposal. Since they were no doubt purchased with your money, I have no scruple in allowing you to deal with them as you see fit.”
Looking back upon that evening, I can still recall the sense of surreality that pervaded the lesson from that point. Holmes-as-Escott proved to be a witty, resourceful conversationalist, and a smooth-tongued flatterer, as he honed his skills upon me. With practice, his performance became more polished, but what rendered it compelling, to my eyes at least, were those tantalising slips into awkwardness or idiosyncrasy, which made him appear most like himself. In such moments, I could almost imagine how it would be if Holmes himself were this attentive, this admiring, this open with me. I knew that it was nothing but role play on both sides, yet the insidious charm of it drew me in, in spite of myself.
“Not really. You can’t help being interesting.”
I don’t know how much Sherlock deduced about the other patrons at the club that night, but I certainly didn’t pay them much attention. And I probably blew Sherlock’s cover while I was at it, too, because to be honest I just couldn’t take my eyes off him.
I lay still for a long moment, as stunned as though I had climaxed myself, and awash with a fierce, protective tenderness. He was silent, one arm flung across his face. Not wishing to crowd him, I stretched out at his side and placed a shaking hand against his sternum. He opened his eyes slowly, blinking dazedly, but as his gaze focused he regarded me with an intensity that laid my heart bare.
something that Sherlock is going to talk him into. Not like all the other questionable things he has found himself doing in the name of ‘science’ over the years.
“You know nothing of the sort, sir! Or have you been spying on me?”
“It… It’s…” John groans inwardly. He and Sherlock have
want to continue flirting with you.” He squeezed my hand, then let it fall. “Flirtation implies superficiality, or a lack of serious intention. That is not my style or, ultimately, yours.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen. “John, of course I’m serious! I’ve wanted to marry you since the day I saw you proposing to someone else - though I realise that’s not good and I probably shouldn’t say it. I know sex is important to you, so I had to see if that side of things could work between us, hence this whole “experiment” - which, incidentally, has been something of a paradigm shift. But this isn’t about sex for me, and it certainly isn’t about idle curiosity. You said…
“With the same self-selected participant?”
Holmes and I stood together at the window for several minutes after our client and her lover had disappeared from sight. The street below us was crowded in spite of the gloom: hansoms splashed through the mud, the breath of the horses mingling with the fog, and cloaked and shivering pedestrians darted like shadows beneath the gas lamps. Our warm, bright lodgings were as if a world apart, existing for us alone. The very walls were steeped with our history: the soft contentment of quiet evenings spent together, the thrill of our shared adventures, the glow and spark of a fast-forged friendship.
John nods dazedly, and picks up the tweezers again. Now, his hands are not so steady. He is achingly aware of every part of his body that’s touching Sherlock’s: his ankle, his knee, his hand… Unable to help himself, he runs his fingers up Sherlock’s wrist to his pulse point. Topping 100 beats per minute. Jumping at his touch…
We remained upon the sofa for the best part of an hour, during which time the newspaper was thoroughly dissected by Holmes, and shuffled about distractedly by me. He then moved to his workspace, to resume an experiment on the adhesive properties of beeswax. Interpreting his silence as an invitation, I seated myself at his elbow, to write up some notes on a recent case. I made a point of consulting him frequently as I did so, passing him my pages with a deliberate brush of our fingers and, to my delight, he began to respond in kind, leaning in so that his shoulder nudged mine as he mixed and measured. Our progress was tentative – perhaps strangely so, given the beginning we had made – but by the time our dinner was served at a quarter past six, we were sitting with our ankles entwined beneath the table, and his hand upon my knee.
“Almost.” His expression shifted into something resolute, yet furtive. “Agatha has asked me to kiss her.”
As the grey light of dawn crept through my windows, I began to question the very foundations upon which my future was to be built. I had always assumed that I would marry a woman, so I had not hesitated to act upon the appreciation that I felt for Mary Morstan. But could my assumption have blinded me to a deeper passion for a far closer companion, which had operated upon me for years before I had ever heard her name? My mind recoiled from the question, as if I had struck at a dam and then sensed, in the awful trembling of the stones beneath my fingers, the full force of the torrent pent behind it. The thoughts pursued me through vivid, fitful dreams until the morning.
“No, of course not,” I answered warmly. “I apologise, Holmes. Of course we have a duty to our client. You have concluded, then, that she is engaged in an affair with the female friend whom she visits?”
I’d never seen him act that well either. Sherlock, who goes stiff as a board if you do so much as hug him, was practically melting against Victor! It was so much more convincing than with Janine. And Victor was giving back as good as he got. I was close to intervening at one point - he was getting quite possessive! He had his hands in all sorts of places. But it was impossible not to see how good they looked together. It wasn’t all for show, on either side. You could tell they had a history.
“Yes,” John says, shortly.
Well, perhaps a few details…
“In that case,
“Relax your face,” I instructed him, taking a moment to compose my own. “Now smile at me – just so – and let the smile fade, except in your eyes.”
“I see little reason for alarm on that score.”
He considers him for a moment, then smiles. “Pass me the lube.”
Then a clap of thunder rent the air like a gunshot.
“Come to my room,” he said, his voice hoarse.
“And so on, and so forth,” he muttered, dismissing a legion of unspoken inanities with an impatient sweep of his hand. “For heaven’s sake, Watson, let us pass over the obligatory small talk, or we shall exhaust my stock of patience before I’ve begun!”
“You have already told me that you are not a hero, Sherlock,” I breathed distractedly, and then, without any conscious decision on my part, I was kissing him again.
He smiled slightly, glancing at me from the corner of his eye. “
’. When I asked my husband about his plans for this evening, he claimed that he was attending the theatre, alone. Would you gentlemen be so kind as to follow him from the house, and provide me with a report of his activities?”
“I’ve had stitches before, John.” Sherlock reminds him.
John looks up incredulously, but Sherlock appears to be perfectly serious. Disconcerted, John returns his attention to Sherlock’s hand, holding it steady as he positions the needle. He places the stitches quickly and neatly, but is increasingly aware of Sherlock’s gaze fixed on him as he works. The silence seems a little intense now, and he breaks it without thinking: “I’ll take these out in a week or so. Don’t try to do it yourself. And if you see any signs of infection in the meantime, you need to let me know. Redness, swelling…”
less important to me than the knowledge that I loved this man, and that he loved me. That was the one clear answer, whatever else we had feigned or fallen into or simply tried on for a while. Of course, I might not have been quite so philosophical, had I not continued to hope.
“You should know my methods by now,” Holmes chided, his cut-glass accent softening to a pleasant southern county drawl. “Allow me to introduce William Escott, the co-founder of a thriving plumbing business in Highgate.”
“I really can’t comment at this early stage,” Sherlock matches his tone, giving a lazy smirk. “We haven’t yet completed all the activities on the list. I take it you’d be willing to try some more at a later date?”
Changing tactics, I drew his lower lip between mine and caressed it generously with my tongue, until his breathing shuddered and he slackened his grip. I then nudged him backwards until his shoulders hit the wall and pressed my open mouth to his. He groaned, sinking down to grant me better access. It was several glorious seconds before he had the wherewithal to reciprocate, but once he did, he copied my movements with growing skill, until I was not pinning him in place so much as leaning against him, weak-kneed with desire.
And he in no way appreciates poetry (“call that poetry, John?”) so I’ll stop. He’ll say I should finish writing up the case, so in case any of you actually wonder or care: we did catch the blackmailer. Apparently it was one of the doormen. While he pretended to search the patrons on their way in, he was actually attaching ingenious little hidden cameras to their clothes, which he used to take photos while they were inside. Sherlock found one of those cameras on my shirt that morning.
Holmes and I both started in surprise, seasoned campaigners though we were. The very walls seemed to shake, and the gas lamps guttered, sending the shadows reeling. We gazed at each other for a moment, wide-eyed, then he chuckled, and pushed himself up onto one elbow. More slowly I followed suit, my gaze lingering on his tousled hair, swollen lips, and crumpled plumber’s outfit. I could not help but smile. His lips twitched in response, but his eyes were already drawn to the window, and his expression hardened with a new resolve.
You had not, then, married your husband for fortune or for affection. What had induced you to such a step? Here, I was obliged to fall back upon probabilities and speculation. You might have been motivated by a general fear that your preferences would otherwise be discovered. Yet the timing of your marriage was suggestive, occurring at a juncture when your husband-to-be was in urgent need of funds. I therefore hypothesised that he had some power over you, and had chosen that moment to exercise it. Perhaps he made a specific threat to denounce you as an invert if you refused him.”
Sherlock hesitates, then rolls his eyes, some of his usual arrogance returning to his face. “John, it should be blatantly obvious, even to you, that our ‘experiment’ didn’t dignify the name of scientific enquiry. There were no pre-agreed objective criteria for success or failure. Only two participants, both self-selected and with a strong personal interest in the outcome. And as you say, sexuality is hopelessly illogical anyway.”
As for Holmes, the mere mention of “the weather” was sufficient to make his fingers twitch. After a brief, stilted exchange upon the subject he was shifting his weight from side to side, and bouncing on his toes.
might not quite be sufficient to prepare him, genius though he was, for a convincing flirtation with an accomplished coquette.
Trying not to rush, John places a hand on Sherlock’s knee as he once did so many months ago, but this time he slides it very slowly inwards and upwards. His other hand slips under Sherlock’s shirt onto the warm skin of his back. Sherlock shivers and breaks the kiss. “Shall we… go to my bedroom?”
“Very well.” I took a deep breath, and stepped into the centre of the room. “Show me.”
“I am neither as fit for, nor as desirous of female company as I used to be. It has been years since I have flirted. It would be an exercise in futility now.”
He compressed his lips into a tight line. “Even if I could, Watson, I believe I lack the ability to express affection in such a way.”
He uses that moment to really look at his friend. Confident as he’d seemed, Sherlock clearly isn’t entirely comfortable with the situation. He’s let go of John and crossed his arms defensively over his stomach. His forehead is furrowed, his eyes shut, and he’s practically vibrating with nervous tension. John thinks about easing that tension away, or redirecting it…
“Are you completely satisfied with our friendship?” he asked.
“How appalling!”
“But you enjoy sex, are occasionally attracted to men and have no convincing reason to restrict yourself to one gender in your search for a partner.”
“I assume that you require instruction?” I prompted after a moment’s silence, ghosting the backs of my fingers over the curve of his throat. “There are many different ways to kiss, you know.”
“I do not mean to be intrusive, my dear fellow, but is this for a case?”
When I finally emerged from my chambers, I thought it wisest to suppress the insights of the night until I had leisure to consider them further. Anxious that no change in my manner should betray me to Holmes, I occupied myself with my toast and marmalade for rather longer than my appetite required, and retreated behind a newspaper as soon as breakfast was over. The human imagination, however, has a perverse will of its own. My thoughts strayed irresistibly towards Holmes, and, before many minutes had elapsed, my eyes were likewise drawn in his direction.
“Well, is she?” I enquired.
I was shaking now myself; I fumbled for what seemed like an age with his trousers. The firmness of his erection against my fingers left me dizzy with want, but it was the trust that he had placed in me - his submission to my guidance - that almost undid me. Once I had freed him, I laid my forehead against the quivering muscles of his abdomen, slowing my breathing even as he fought to control his.
“And/or a romantic one.”
Holmes shook his head. “You forget two essential questions, Watson: why did she hesitate outside our door and, more importantly, why did she overcome that hesitation to consult with us in the first place? Discover
other evasions in the narrative appear to have passed unnoticed. For instance, nobody has questioned my implication that Sherlock Holmes could effortlessly charm, and ultimately engage himself to, Milverton’s housemaid Agatha.
“Presumably you had no reason to do so,” he sighed. “But yet, you are the warmest hearted man that I know. I would have been astonished if you had persisted in condemning a mutual love between two equals for mere reasons of convention.”
John lies back down so that they’re face to face. “You saw how out of control I was when you touched me,” he says slowly. “There’s not really a right or a wrong way to respond to… you know. Sex. But if you try to think your way through it, you might not enjoy it so much.”
SHERLOCK:
He turned away; I stepped swiftly forward to bar his path. “Perhaps you do not wish to hear this from me. But I need you to understand: I have been blind to my own desires until today. I never thought to make the comparison before, but now that I have, I find that Miss Morstan has not ever been more enticing, more absorbing, more beloved, more
“You know my methods,” Holmes replied. “When in conversation with a client I do not merely study her attire or facial expression, but also the myriad of unconscious looks and gestures that reveal the inner workings of her mind.”
I am certain that he heard me, but he did not react at all; his posture was rigid and forbidding, his eyes still fixed on the flames. With a touch of desperation, I continued: “Yesterday, when you were observing Mrs. Jennings and Miss Morstan, you also looked at me: why?”
He turned slowly to face me, eyebrows raised.
“Number… eight on the list?” John asks, closing his eyes and tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “Right after the anal sex and the romantic relationship?”
“You do know that ‘gay’ and ‘straight’ are just two ends of a spectrum?”
“I’ll have to paraphrase,” Sherlock says. “John, I want to be as close to you as I can get. Physically. Legally.
“I have a few things on my mind,” I began awkwardly, after a moment. “Holmes, what is your true opinion of my relationship with Miss Morstan?”
This backhanded compliment failed utterly to divert me. “Instructive?” I repeated. “How?”
He cleared his throat, and returned his gaze to the text. “I am gathering information on how to court a woman.”
My throat constricted at this admission, although I was certain that any regret, except as far as it pertained to the case, was on my side alone.
I leaned back in my chair, my mind reeling. In idle hours, I had sometimes wondered about Holmes’ intimate past, picturing him with elegant, high-born ladies or, occasionally, raffish, bohemian men. Such imaginings had never convinced me, I confess; yet that a man as charismatic, as striking and as inquisitive as my friend should have no romantic experience at all, had simply not occurred to me. I found the idea strangely absorbing.
“I have a great many talents,” he answered, with a knowing smirk. “And
“Agatha’s
could teach you how to flirt?”
“You read that in one of those novels,” I challenged him.
*****
He scoffed. “Hardly! It is obvious to me nonetheless.”
Far be it from me to undermine the public’s confidence in the boundless talent of my friend. The reality of the case was, however, somewhat different. It makes for a more entertaining tale.
You’ll think I’m a bit of a shit for doing that. You might be right, though there are some things I can’t tell you – extenuating circumstances, as it were. Let’s just say that Mary and I were both different people, when we fell in love. I’ll still be part of her life, and still be a father to our baby girl, but I told her I needed Sherlock more. She cried a bit, but said she’d been expecting this to happen since the day Sherlock got shot. That was kind of a turning point for me as well.
“Oh yes, of course!” John exclaims, turning eagerly towards him. But then, despite himself, he hesitates, because really, what could be good enough for Sherlock after
“The experiment will need to cover a range of activities,” Sherlock says, quickly and tonelessly. “I’ve attempted to sort them in ascending order of intimacy, although I’m aware that this is subject to debate. First: close physical proximity; second: kissing and caressing; third: hand jobs; fourth: frottage; fifth: blow jobs; sixth: anal intercourse.”
“No!” John repeats, as repressively as he can. “Not good.”
“I shall be glad to do so,” she declared, “for the fewer words we must squander on this sorry affair, the better for us all. I believe that my husband is unfaithful to me, and I wish for proof.”
“Yes, that
Sherlock and Victor came into the club hand-in-hand. Sherlock was laughing at something Victor had said, and his eyes were sparkling. As was the rest of him. I’d never seen him in clothes that tight, and that’s saying something! He was wearing this midnight blue shirt that… well, I don’t know much about fashion. But you could see his muscles
“I believe so, despite Turpin’s touching defence of her ‘innocence’ and ‘virtue’”.
“Absolutely,” John says, without hesitation.
I let out a breath. “Forgive me, Holmes, but I do not understand the problem. On the evening of our first lesson, you touched me several times in what might fairly be described as a flirtatious manner. Is that not sufficient for the level of intimacy that you’re trying to achieve with her?”
“Go ahead,” I smiled into his eyes. “Show me.”
“I love you,” John says, completely unable to help himself. “I love you so much, Sherlock. I’d do anything to be with you.”
you raise yourself above the commonplace,” Holmes remarked, ungraciously. “Countless others have consulted me on the same question, but most of
With a repetition of her thanks, which Holmes waved aside, Mrs. Jennings took her leave. I do not exaggerate when I write that there was a new sparkle in her eyes, and a spring in her step. I joined Holmes at the window, and watched her cross the street to where another young lady stood waiting. Although more homely, and more simply dressed, Miss Warrens was nonetheless radiant as she advanced to meet her companion. She took both her hands with affectionate confidence and stood on tiptoe to kiss her cheeks. The two of them lingered for a moment in animated conversation, their smiling faces illuminated by their pocket lantern. Then finally Miss Warrens gave a cheerful wave in the direction of our windows, and they set off together down the street, arm in arm.
“I do not doubt
“Is her husband aware of it?”
“But I was oblivious to their interest,” I countered, shaking my head. “Such interactions lack in substance. I find them ultimately unsatisfying. If I cannot have again what I had with Mary, I would rather do without.”
“Then to whom?”
He makes a surprisingly good job of it considering that he can use only one hand. John moves help him, but his eagerness – or Sherlock’s proximity – makes him clumsy at undoing the buttons bottom-up and backwards. Finally Sherlock bats his hands away – “Do your own!” – and they both start laughing.
It was a considerable relief to me when the doorbell sounded shortly after two, announcing Mrs. Jennings. I rose to my feet, but Holmes was faster: he opened the door for her, then ushered me towards the most comfortable armchair. “I fear that Dr. Watson is still feeling the effects of last night’s adventures,” he said, addressing our client. “After following your husband from the house as agreed, we did not return here until the early hours of this morning.”
“I fear the contrary,” he returned gallantly, before inclining his face towards mine and murmuring: “Your cravat has been straightened since this morning. You did not do it yourself: the knot is tighter than you prefer. This was the work of your first admirer. Your second was more circumspect: in her ploy to approach you, she pretended to examine your watch. The nervous perspiration from her index finger left a smudge upon the glass - here.”
For the record: I’ve only put on four pounds since my marriage! And the bags under my eyes are no bigger than they were before. And lipstick on my cheek, baby vomit in my hair and an “assortment of minor injuries from domestic D.I.Y. projects” can all be washed off or covered up! But Sherlock was having none of it. He seemed rather amused that I was arguing with him: “You really are a fascinating case study in the power of reverse psychology, John. Suppose I’d
I couldn’t take my eyes off Sherlock. But it wasn’t (just) because of the way he looked. You probably think I was jealous of Victor, and okay, maybe I was (a little), but that wasn’t it either. The thing was: Sherlock looked
,” Sherlock murmurs against his lips.
“It suits my purpose.”
A thrill passed through me at this unexpected opening; my heart leapt against my ribs. “Not at all,” I said quickly, holding his gaze, “for it is perfectly true.”
I admit to a certain relief at this explanation, although the feeling was short-lived. The false position in which we would place ourselves, the danger of capture, and the risk to my friend’s career and reputation, were serious objections to the scheme, quite apart from the deception of an innocent girl. Holmes, however, insisted that it was the only viable course of action. Milverton would not give up the letters for anything less than the exorbitant price that he had requested. As for the housemaid, Holmes assured me that he would toy neither with her virtue nor with her heart. She had several suitors, whom she delighted in driving to a frenzy of mutual jealousy, and as one of the crowd he would prove as strategically useful to her as she was to him.
"I swear to you, Holmes:
“It is settled, then.” I took his arm, my own heart lighter than air.
oooOOOooo
“How so?” I asked, surprised.
“Do not tell me you know anything about plumbing!” I exclaimed, admiring and relieved in equal measure.
“Do you mean to say that you have never…?”
“Sorry.” Sherlock makes a visible effort to repress a smile. “Go on.”
. We’ve danced around this question for too long, but now it is addressed and there is no concealment between us. If you want us to remain friends, I will not consider our friendship lacking. But if you want anything more, then I… I am offering.”
I took a brief moment to savour the fact that Sherlock Holmes, through a lie of omission, had induced me to give him an entirely unnecessary lesson in kissing that afternoon.
John bites his lip. “Maybe it’s not necessary, but it is kind of the best bit...” Unable to resist, he traces his fingers gently down Sherlock’s side. “Look, this is an experiment, right? And it’s just you and me. If I do something that feels good, you could try just letting go and seeing where it takes you. And if you don’t want to, that’s fine too. I’ll stop whenever you tell me to.”
“He was your commanding officer. You admired him very much…” Sherlock begins, his sing-song inflection indicating that he’s prompting John to continue the tale.
“Sofa,” he gasped, and we stumbled backwards, fumbling at each other’s belts and buttons. He fell hard onto the cushions and I fell with him, my trousers around my knees.
“It would do little good for us to stand around and discuss the theory,” I persisted, with more confidence than I felt, dropping my arms to my sides, palms open. “Come, my dear fellow, we have agreed to this. You must practice: go ahead. Pretend that I am she.”
“Specifically: you attempted anal intercourse. With Major Sholto.”
was the mistake, not this.” I stood too, my heart pounding with the force of my sincerity. “Our friendship is the most important of my life; as to anything more…”
“That was remarkable,” I said at last, my voice regrettably unsteady. “You have a talent for observation.”
“It defies logic. But
John looks up, and time seems to stand still. Because Sherlock might have sounded casual, but he’s looking right back at John with a mixture of wariness and defiance, spots of color burning high in his cheeks. He appears to be holding his breath, waiting to see if John will pick up on his unsubtle hint. Because this is what Sherlock has been leading up to from the start.
“Who the hell told you that?” John asks, but Sherlock merely gives him an enigmatic smile and raises his eyebrows expectantly. John groans. “Can’t you just… deduce it or something?”
“Insights into the feminine psyche, as well as an overview of courtship rituals and hints as to acceptable language and behaviour. Despite appearances, romantic novels are more forthcoming on these subjects than the
“It is a privilege to escort you thus,” he remarked, sweetly, a moment later. “I know that you have a great many admirers.”
oooOOOooo
“It is not sufficient, Watson,” he said. “You must teach me how to touch her.”
He regarded me curiously. “Yesterday evening, when I first mentioned the possibility of homosexual attraction, your response was one of disbelief and distaste.”
Keeping his hand where it is, he shifts his fingers so that he’s cradling Sherlock’s testicles, massaging him gently. Without stopping, he moves closer, tangling his legs with Sherlock’s, half leaning over him and bringing their mouths together. Sherlock gives a shaky sigh and relaxes into the kiss, even as his cock slowly hardens under John’s palm. So far, so good.
He reached beneath his desk and drew out another pile of folders, neatly labelled and dated like the first.
“I never thought you wanted…” John begins, but he can’t quite say it out loud. The concept of Sherlock, sexually attracted to him… Sherlock, in a relationship with him… is too improbable. He can’t shake the feeling that is all a colossal misunderstanding. “We’d have to start slowly,” he finds himself saying instead, the ‘we’ safely indeterminate. “Step by step, only going further if we’re both comfortable with what we’re doing.”
I could not repress an admiring smile at this speech, although my friend had delivered it in a weary monotone, with little of his usual flair. Our client, on the other hand, appeared nonplussed, although she readily confirmed his supposition.
“Fit?” Sherlock supplies. “
The case of Mrs. Sabrina Jennings did not, at first, appear to be anything out of the ordinary. From the window of 221B Baker Street, where I had just taken luncheon with my friend and fellow-lodger Sherlock Holmes, I perceived a fashionably dressed young lady lingering indecisively on the pavement outside our door. She took a step forward, paused, turned away, and then returned with a resolute air, only to still her hand the moment she touched our bell pull. My curiosity was aroused, but when I described the scene to Holmes he did not take the trouble to rise from his chair, or even to open his eyes.
got that from a book.
“Concentrate, John.” Sherlock sounds amused but also… turned on? John has never heard that particular tone of voice from him before. He makes a valiant effort, focuses his wandering attention, and tends to the remaining cuts as thoroughly and gently as he’s able. After the longest ten minutes of his life, he positions the gauze and applies two bandages, wrapping them slowly around Sherlock’s fingers until most of his hand is encased.
“Yeah. What’s with the flattery? I’m not going to give up and send you to hospital, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“No, no, that’s fine. Sorry.” John clears his throat, licks his lips. “Fine. It’s just… ambitious, for one evening,” - and now he can’t carry on another second without making sure that the ‘hypothetical male partner’ is off the table - “...especially if my test subject has injured his hand.”
Pleasant though it was, her short visit would not be worth recording, were it not for the rather extraordinary change that it produced in Holmes. He sat up straighter in his chair, and stilled the restless motion of his fingers against the armrest. His gaze became intense and searching, focused first upon Mrs. Jennings and then, briefly and disconcertingly, upon me.
“No, indeed,” I blustered. “You have just implied that our client is sexually attracted to... to Miss Morstan, of all people! Do you believe that her interest is reciprocated?”
“I was just surprised.” Sherlock says, sounding furious with himself. “But I’m fine now. Really.”
I immediately turned to the window, and saw that Jennings had likewise left the restaurant and was now crossing the street at a brisk pace, with the agile figure of my friend leaping from shadow to shadow behind him. Repressing an oath, I signaled to the waiter and fumbled in my pockets for the requisite notes and coins, before hurrying out into the night in pursuit of Sherlock Holmes.
It all started when a friend of ours from Scotland Yard mentioned (over a beer) that Sherlock was going undercover at some high-end nightclub. Apparently several of the patrons had been targeted by a blackmailer. Not something Sherlock would normally be interested in (although I think it’s safe to say he’s not fond of blackmailers!), but quite a lot of money was involved. And possibly the P.A. to a minor official in the British government. I’m sure Sherlock had his reasons for taking the case.
“I assure you that ‘the affliction’, as you term it, is not confined to the male population, the lower classes, or indeed to any other faction of society,” Holmes answered, sharply. “Is that your only thought on the matter?”
“I do indeed,” Turpin replied, shrugging off his heavy coat. Despite his assertion, there was a hint of apology in his reedy voice. “I have dedicated the past seven days and nights to this affair. Your wife frequently leaves the house in the afternoons and walks alone to the same address: number 22 in Curzon Street. This I have documented meticulously, as you can see.” He opened the slim brown folder that he had been carrying beneath his arm, and slid it across the table.
Dr. Watson was, I believe, distracted at the time, but I paid close attention to your husband’s transaction with Turpin yesterday evening. He paid him a mere two pounds. This, for seven days and seven nights of work! Turpin generally charges three times the amount. Such a discount could only ever be offered to a favoured client, from whom he has received, or hopes to receive, a great deal of extra business.”
John is reminded forcibly of their first day in 221b, when Sherlock was practically falling over his own feet to gain his approval. Strong as the attraction between them was, even then, John little imagined then that six years later he’d be standing with Sherlock beside his bed, about to make love to him. “You’ve never done this before, right?” he asks, finally voicing a question that has bothered him since their first evening together.
“No.” He raised his chin. “
Mrs. Jennings thus dismissed, Holmes returned to his chair by the fire, pressed his fingertips together beneath his chin and stared into the flames. Intrigued though I was, I knew him too well to interrupt his thoughts, so instead took up a newspaper and settled quietly into the armchair opposite. Glancing now and then in his direction, I was pleased to see that his dejection had been replaced by a look of interest and anticipation.
Undressing with Sholto was solemn and erotic. With Sherlock, it feels natural. Almost. John drops his clothes onto the floor, grinning at the general chaos and at the sight of his friend struggling to pull down his slim-fit trousers. But by the time Sherlock steps out of his underwear, they are both serious again. John’s gaze drops instinctively to Sherlock’s crotch, then guiltily away, until he remembers a full second later that he’s allowed to look, now. His mouth goes dry, his stomach twisting into knots of excitement and apprehension.
He did not look up, but my breath caught in my throat at the sight of his smile. “None whatsoever,” he answered.
“Okay,” John agrees, hoarsely. “But can you just… can you kiss me again before we start?” And Sherlock obliges, kissing him keenly and deeply, keeping their lower bodies apart until John is half hard and pressing instinctively towards him.
“When enjoying the touch of one’s beloved, some distraction of thought is only proper,” I retorted, keeping my tone light.
A rakish young man in a workman’s outfit emerged from the bathroom and came striding towards me. I stared at him in bewilderment for a full five seconds, until his lips twisted into a familiar smirk.
JOHN: You got that from a book.
“For science, of course.”
“I do have some experience in this area,” I persisted, warming to the theme. “My knowledge of women extends over many nations…”
Sherlock is watching him, wide-eyed. “Frottage is…” he begins.
“I suppose you could say I had a crush on him,” he says, his eyes firmly fixed on the tweezers. “When I found out he was interested in me I was flattered. And I thought perhaps… But then when we tried, when it came down to it, it just felt wrong and I couldn’t really…I wasn’t… “. His bravado failing abruptly, he makes a vague downward gesture and leaves Sherlock to fill in the blanks. “So anyway, I learned my lesson. End of story.”
“Damn it, Holmes, it is not just about the music! It’s… you know that you are… that I…”
“You know best, John. As always.”
. If I could first become habituated to flirtatious touches, I might better be able to initiate such myself.”
I believe that, in all the years I had known Sherlock Holmes, I had never once heard him stumble over his words, or hesitate so long in their selection. His unexpected sensitivity touched me deeply, even as I hurried to his aid.
Sherlock lifts his chin. “Never. But I’ve done my research.” Then, still looking at John, he starts to unbutton his shirt.
His hands are calloused and tremble a bit when he touches me.
and a bottle of good wine. We had not waited above five minutes, however, when a small, wiry gentleman entered the room, peering about him expectantly with dark, beady eyes. Holmes gave a start of recognition: the gentleman was Mr. Turpin, a private detective with whom he had been obliged to collaborate on a recent case of forgery, and whom he had charitably described as a “bungling fool.” Holmes immediately raised the menu to conceal his face: a wise precaution, as it turned out, for Turpin was soon headed in our direction. I assumed that he, too, would seat himself in one of the alcoves, but to my surprise he approached Jennings instead, drawing up a chair at his table. This, then, was the mysterious ‘T.’ whom Jennings had come to meet! This, the well-kept mistress! I could not help but smile at the incongruity.
someone like that…”
“You’ll be interested to hear that I’m engaged.”
I can’t even remember what I said to him then! My heart was pounding so hard that I felt dizzy. It’s all a bit of a blur. I think it was something mundane, along the lines of “have you eaten?” or “can I move back in?” And he didn’t answer: just sat there, staring at me. So I took a few steps towards him, and he stood up and came towards me and…
Emotion clogged my throat and brought tears to my eyes. I had never in my life been prouder to call Sherlock Holmes my friend. And in that moment my doubts fell away, and I resolved to seek with him, if he would accept me, that deeper intimacy that I had dreamed of.
“I’m not embarrassed,” John says stubbornly. “For what it’s worth, I think you’re pretty interesting too. But you already know that. I mean…” He shakes his head, distractedly. “God, that sounds…”
“Is that another compliment?”
Love and happiness swelled so sharply in my chest that I burst out laughing. He grinned, and shifted to make room for me as I lay down to face him. My hands drifted to the nape of his neck, the warmth of his skin seeping into the backs of my fingers.
I’ve got nothing against Victor (why should I?), but I wasn’t sure we could trust him. And I doubted he’d be much use to Sherlock in a fight or with a gun. So I suggested that maybe I should go along too, as back-up. Sherlock pointed out that this would defeat the object: it would be no use him blending into the crowd if I were there too, busy “skulking about in a jumper and scowling at Victor”. He also pointed out that a blackmailer who was trying to take compromising photos of the nightclub patrons without anyone noticing would hardly resort to fist fights or firearms. But I just had to make sure that Sherlock would be okay, so I offered to put product in my hair (don’t you dare laugh!), wear the sharpest get-up Sherlock could find for me, and sit unobtrusively at the bar keeping an eye on things. Surprisingly, Sherlock agreed to this.
“You think it’s too soon.”
“All the metal is present and accounted for. I can reconstruct the test sample to prove it. Besides,” Sherlock adds with deliberate emphasis, “I have complete faith in your abilities.”
“Sherlock,” I said, looking up. He was staring at me, deeply flushed, his eyes dark and his lips parted. My chest clenched. “May I?”
Jennings leafed rapidly through the contents. “I see little of interest here. You did not attempt to discover what occurred
be like, potentially, with a man he loved, was a revelation to me. And I thought about all the times we’d been on the brink of that – him and me. We weren’t a couple, so we’d never been all over each other like that, but still: after cases sometimes, when we’d sprinted halfway across London, we’d stand close together as we caught our breath, and smile at each other exactly like that in the flashing blue lights, as if we were the only two people in the world.
He coughed. “She
I shook my head in bewilderment. “None.”
We heard a quick step upon the staircase, and a moment later our housekeeper announced the visitor. Holding the door for her, I noted that her elegant dress was complemented by some expensive, although rather old-fashioned, jewellery that encircled her wrists and glinted amongst her dark ringlets. Her features were striking, her bearing somewhat haughty, but it was the mixture of desperation and defiance in her glance that made the strongest impression upon me. Holmes merely bid her to be seated, and to state her case as concisely as possible.
“Ah! So you have also obtained the information you were seeking.”
“That was my motivation for taking your case,” Holmes replied. “I surmised as much during the course of your first visit, and was convinced that I could be of service to you, although perhaps not in the manner that you had supposed. Your scheme was conceived out of desperation, and was very unlikely to succeed. Even if your husband had been unfaithful, you could scarcely threaten him with exposure on that account, given that his evidence against you was of far longer standing.”
“Physical attraction does not equate to a desire for intimacy.”
I hastily pulled off my own shirt then set to work, more slowly, on his. His chest heaved against my fingers as I stripped his clothing away; when I placed my mouth upon an exposed nipple, he arched his back and cried out, tangling his hands in my hair to hold me in place. I obliged him for a long moment, relishing the rising heat of his skin against mine, until I could wait no longer. Without ceasing the motions of my lips and tongue, I slid my hand back down to his groin.
The dam cracked at the sound of his voice, speaking my name. I stepped forward, heart bursting, and pressed my lips to his. He gasped, but did not pull away, and after a moment he shifted against me, angling his face to mine and returning my kiss. His lips were tender, his touch almost reverent; the intensity was such that my eyes drifted shut, even as my other senses saturated with his nearness. I stood as though dazed, inhaling his breath, cupping his cheek in my hand and feeling his rough, warm skin beneath my fingertips. I leaned against him, and relaxed into his arms as they tightened around me. This was completion; this was bliss as I had never known it. Until that morning I had not even considered it possible.
Instinctively, I shook the hand he offered, then cast my eye over his disguise. A plumber had been called to our lodgings the day before, to repair a leaking faucet, and Holmes had recreated every detail of his appearance, from the spanner in his shirt pocket to the water stains upon his boots. He even wore a well-trimmed goatee beard. In terms of authenticity, the ensemble was flawless. Given the task in hand, however, I thought that it left something to be desired. The real plumber, upon whom it was modelled, had been a phlegmatic, dull sort of chap, with no advantage of face or figure.
He paused, holding his breath, as I curled my hand against the nape of his neck. This time, I rubbed light, tentative circles against his bare skin. “Agatha insists…?”
