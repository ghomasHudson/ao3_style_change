Next week: Dean makes a fateful decision. Meg has dangerous baggage. Cas is forced to confront an uncomfortable truth.
Dean grabs a condom off the nightstand and rips it open while Castiel waits on all fours, stroking himself loosely in a desperate search for relief and distraction. His hand tightens on his cock, almost involuntarily, when he hears the snick of the lube bottle again, followed by the obscene sound of Dean slicking himself up. A wave of arousal rushes and tingles through him, the throbbing between his legs urging him to push back towards where Dean is.
Castiel has waited for Dean’s apology for more than a decade, but now, seeing him there, forehead scrunched with tension, unable to meet Castiel’s eyes, he suddenly finds that he doesn’t need to hear it anymore. He reaches out a hand to cover Dean’s. “You don’t have to say it, Dean.”
scared. Not of riding a bike downhill maybe, or of stealing a loaf of bread, but of… of not being enough. Of being a disappointment and being left behind.”
Dean nods eagerly and leans forward. “Which makes what I’m about to tell you even more interesting. There was another body with sulfur at the scene a week later.”
He reaches for the bedside table, feeling around the drawer past Dean’s gun to get at the small, purple bottle of lubricant tucked just behind it. If there’s one thing he wants before he leaves here, it’s a memory that will make him feel not merely wanted, but connected to Dean, to this thing between them, long after the door of the bunker creaks shut in his wake.
After another moment’s dramatic pause, Sergei finally turns the suitcase to face the rest of them. The only thing it contains is a small glass vial, nestled in a heavily padded compartment. Inside the vial is a swirling substance that looks somehow both liquid and gaseous, its movements utterly unpredictable in the way only living things can be.
One thing is absolutely, abundantly clear: he will not let himself fall into the trap of endless overtime again. He’s committed to being there for Claire in every way that he can. But SucroCorp’s office is only a twenty-minute drive from Lebanon, along mostly empty country roads, so he wouldn’t be facing a long, stressful commute.
Cas frowns at a spot on the tabletop, at war with himself. What Dean is saying certainly makes more sense than the thought forming in the back of his mind. And yet…
can’t tell my boss about because I’m super not allowed to share any of this information with someone who doesn’t work for us."
Charlie and Meg look inordinately pleased with themselves, and Castiel could have sworn he saw Charlie wink at Meg, leaving him to wonder whether he’s just added another item to his list of things to be worried about.
“It’s just, something happened tonight, at my house,” Dean says eventually. “I’m worried there’s something after you, and I need to know that you’re being safe.”
So that’s it then. Dean not only has to get Cas to believe that there was no joke, and certainly not at Cas’ expense. He also has to make it known that he really wants the two of them to reconnect — that he remembers the promise they made to each other way back then.
Dean ignores him. “Please. I know he’s a grumpy, arrogant bastard, but I was kinda hoping he could be
Cas is supposed to smell like weed these days. Instead, he smells a little like cheap soap, but mostly like Cas. Dean couldn’t put a name to that smell if he tried, but he could pick it out of any crowd. He almost forgot what it was like.
Luckily, Sam has no such issue, even though he still looks mighty pissed off. “I can promise you that Jack and Cas can hold their own,” he says. “What are the details of the hunts?”
The smell of disinfectant and despair trails after him as he follows the signs to the ICU. The nurse at reception directs him to the nearest waiting room, where she says someone will be with him shortly. It becomes clear pretty damn quickly that Dean’s definition of “shortly” is very different from hers.
Hanscum’s expression shifts to something almost pitying. “Are you sure you two didn’t just have a fight?”
“There’s no U.S. base in Porto Azzurro,” he says, then takes another bite of ciabatta. His stomach has stopped being angry with him, which is a relief and is doing wonders for his temper.
“Did you get to ride them?” Jack asks, and Claire launches into an eager account of their morning at the stables, clearly no longer interested in the goings-on at the gazebo.
“He wanted Cas,” Dean says miserably. “He wanted Cas, and he got him. Fuck.” Dean rubs at his face with his palm, almost hard enough to hurt. “I should’ve listened to him. We should’ve gotten the hell out of here while we still could.”
As soon as it’s socially acceptable to do so, Dean picks up the phone, watching as Cas pads over to the kitchen to make some coffee.
“So… thanks again for meeting me. I really wanted to ask you a few things about the Meg Masters story.”
Jimmy tells them both a story about something that happened at school. It’s surprisingly complicated, and he seems to be making up at least half of it as he goes. Dean’s pretty sure LA public schools don’t keep live dragons as classroom pets.
a conviction,” Sam says, voice weary with repetition. They’ve had this conversation many times. “Or they do, but then it turns out the cop was crooked and we have to retry the whole damn case without the arresting officer’s testimony.”
“You mean your crush,” Meg says shrewdly, her smile razor-sharp. “Well, I don’t think you need to worry on that account. He definitely likes you back, Cas. That’s what Charlie told me, and her intel on this stuff is usually solid.”
Charlie stops and turns to face him, forcing the surrounding crowd of vacationers to flow around them. “So what? You’re gonna pop the question and ride her coattails into the sunset?”
allowed to curse in front of Jack?” In response, he gets a glare that just as clearly means, “Yes, Dean. She is literally Death. I’m not in charge of her.”
With that, Dean storms off. After leveling a last glare at the crowd in general but Donatello in particular, Castiel follows him down the steps and along the sidewalk. Dean doesn’t make directly for the diner, but instead ducks into the next side street and slumps down on the small brick wall that rings the first house on the left. Wordlessly, Castiel sits down next to him.
Cas pulls Dean closer, and the change in angle has him brushing against Dean’s prostate, setting fire to the smoldering spark of his arousal.
field write intentionally convoluted prose to make themselves sound more important. Probably because so many people think historians are a waste of space.” Castiel tilts his head, considering. “I would’ve thought your discipline wouldn’t have as much of a problem with that.”
The room fills with Cas’ heavy breathing and the soft, drawn-out moans spilling from Dean’s lips. Cas grabs hold of Dean’s hips to change the angle, and hits Dean’s sweet spot, turning moans into gasps and shouts.
Ten minutes after he hangs up the phone, Dean’s still riding the buzz of what he’d consider a pretty successful interaction with a damn attractive guy. Who also happens to have a smart, sarcastic sense of humor.
“Uh-huh,” Dean says, strolling back behind the counter, and Castiel can’t help but notice that his legs are slightly bowed in a way that’s unreasonably attractive. “Hope you’re planning to pay for it this time.”
“Hey, no, that’s not what this is about.” Eileen closes the distance between them and bumps her arm softly against Castiel’s. “I just thought maybe you needed a friend.”
There’s no answer for a moment. Then, “Maybe I just wanted to go someplace quiet so we could talk. Get to know each other better.” Dean’s voice still carries a hint of teasing, but it’s less pronounced, sidelined by something that sounds almost like shyness.
Over the next twenty-four hours, Castiel keeps telling himself that he’ll call the airline and cancel the flight — just as soon as he’s not so busy.
He can feel Dean’s muscles tense below him, so he wraps his lips around the head of Dean’s cock, slowly sinking down.
In the beach chair next to him, Jack frowns down at his own drink, using a neon-green crazy straw to stir the layers of reds and yellows in his potbellied cocktail glass. “This tastes like candy, but not,” he tells the top of the tiny green umbrella sticking out over the rim. Then, with a smile, he adds, “I think I like it.”
Cas fills the glass straight from the tap and hands it to Dean, who does his best not to wince at the warm temperature or the metallic taste.
“I’ll take the couch tonight,” Dean says, eyes focused on the task of extracting the right combination of pillowcase, flat sheet and a comforter. “You’ll throw out your back if you keep sleeping on that thing.”
When the squad car is out of sight, Dean creeps out of his parking space, turning the radio’s volume down once more. He keeps the headlights off, navigating by the sickly, intermittent glow of streetlights instead.
Its squat wooden front is topped by a giant neon sign of a cowboy riding a bucking bronco. The sign spins in circles, and it’s almost as tall as the rest of the building.
When there’s no answer, Dean turns to Cas to find him frowning and pressing his lips into a thin line, in the particular way he has when he’s working up to something. “You could,” Cas finally says. “But if you like, you could share the bed with me. I… I would be alright with that.”
“I take it the neighborhood wasn’t always like this?” Cas raises the glass to his lips again and drinks deep. It’s good beer, and it’s helping him chase away the last of his jitters from the unsettling trip to Poe Homes. Earlier, getting into Dean's car to drive up here, he thought he saw the shadowy outline of a man watching them from next to the empty apartment building. But here, with the benefit of a good drink and good company, he realizes it was probably nothing but his nerves, playing tricks on him.
Cas scowls at the picture. “Bruno Peruggia. My aunt’s ex-husband. He’s Italian, and he’s the reason we moved away from the States when I was eight. He talked my aunt into following him here. But a couple years after that, he met someone else and left.” Cas’ scowl deepens. “I always thought he was an asshole.”
Cas nods. “If I had told you, you would have been angry. But worse than that, it would've been effectively a goodbye. No matter how long the deal would have taken to come due, our relationship would have been changed forever. I didn’t want that. I wanted to hold on to what we had, to our family, until the very last possible moment.”
“Kissing you,” Cas says, and Dean’s stomach drops. “Not… not like that,” Cas adds hastily, presumably getting some sort of vibe from Dean. “I just meant, I wasn’t thinking. About what it would be like, for you. I shouldn’t have kissed you like that without getting your permission first. It wasn’t fair to you.”
Dean’s head shoots up with the unexpectedness of that statement, and he immediately regrets it. “What for?” he manages to grit out past the pounding in his head.
Castiel descends the stairs to the war room, feeling heavier with each step. He never wanted to leave in the first place. He wanted to make sure Jack was adjusting. He wanted to spend his evenings sitting in the bunker’s kitchen or the library, watching the Winchesters bicker. He wanted to sit and talk with Dean over shots of whiskey, enjoying the company even as the taste of the burning, amber liquid passed him by.
This is another chapter where John Winchester's A+ Parenting makes an appearance, so be warned that there is some internalized homophobia and homophobic behavior, including a brief mention of past violence against a minor. (Everyone will be OK in the end, I promise.)
Finally, about half an hour before the rest of the guests are expected to arrive, they all get a quiet moment. Jack, Claire and Kaia are jumping up and down inside a small bouncy castle Mildred just “happened to have lying around my basement.” The adults are settled in various places of the living room and kitchen, and Dean has just finished putting the final touches on his pies, the placement of the letters on them a little crooked because Dean let the kids put them on, rather than insisting on the perfection he could have produced himself. The sight of those lopsided letters only further hardens Castiel’s resolve.
“Sure.” Cas raises his own glass, which Amara fills with about three sips’ worth of wine. “You want some too, Dean?”
Dean is seriously considering trying to find a desk to hide under, but Donatello’s already spotted him and is waving him over. Feeling twice as heavy as his actual weight, Dean steps through the doorframe and slumps into the chair on the near side of Donatello’s desk.
He taps Cas’ arm and inclines his head toward the woman. Cas nods and follows Dean as he heads over. Before Dean speaks, he hitches on his best “talk to me, I mean well” smile.
Most all the seats have weird, sticky goop on them, and half of them don’t fold up anymore. Which is why it’s more or less a miracle when Dean walks into the theater to find not only Charlie but three other people squished into adjacent spots that all seem to be holding their weight okay.
“What?” Dean asks, vaguely alarmed at being caught out. “Oh, um. No. I mean, yeah. I’m eating it. See?” To demonstrate, he licks a stripe all the way up the cone and what remains of the gelato. When he looks back at Cas and grins, Cas has his head tilted, watching him with a thoughtful frown.
It’s to be expected, considering he managed to fall asleep on a couch, his head on Dean’s chest. But a few aches are more than manageable in exchange for a soft good-morning kiss and Dean’s quiet smiles as he bustles around the kitchen making coffee, bacon and pancakes.
“I have an idea,” Castiel whispers, and he closes the last few inches of space between them. Their lips slide against each other, slotting together perfectly, like they were always meant to fit this way.
But when he tries to move on to selecting books and toys to bring, he’s abruptly stumped. There are just so many of them. It’s possible they’ll be back by the end of the weekend, but what if not? What if they find a place to stay that isn’t here? Or what if his mother is sufficiently angry that she won’t let them come back? Naomi isn’t a cruel woman as such, but she does have her moments of pettiness, and she definitely holds grudges.
Castiel’s heart swells almost painfully in his chest. His cocktail long forgotten and his fingers shaking a little, he types,
“It’s nice to meet you, I suppose,” she says evenly, before turning to Claire with a small smile. “Go ahead, Claire. Let’s take a look at that room of yours.”
From the coffin, Cas’ voice sounds, distinctly grumpy even in their current, life-threatening situation. “Anyone wanna untie me so I can help?”
Six days after his night of báijiǔ-fueled insanity, Castiel finds himself behind the wheel of a rental car, driving the familiar streets of Kansas City at five in the morning. The sun is not yet up, and Castiel can’t help but feel like an intruder in his own city. He’s been away for less than a year, but he’s uncertain of the welcome he’ll get from Dean, and there isn’t anyone else here that he’s particularly eager to see.
Dean looks around. The desk, desk chair and every other piece of furniture in the small, overheated room is covered in dusty tomes. The smell of decaying paper is normally something Dean considers pleasant, but it’s so overwhelming combined with the heat and closeness of the study that it’s verging on unpleasant.
Dean blows out a deep breath, trying to force his thoughts into some semblance of logic. Cas doesn’t
The sound of spitting, then Cas emerges from the bathroom, wearing nothing but a low-slung pair of striped pajama pants. They’re Dean’s favorite because they’re half a size too small and leave very little to the imagination where Cas’ assets are concerned. Watching Cas walk over to the dresser, Dean almost forgets to be mad.
“You too,” he says, smiling and jerking his chin in the general direction of Charlie’s outfit — a forest-green dress layered with emerald lace. Both shades go nicely with her red hair, pulled up into a sleek ponytail that reveals dangling earrings. Castiel squints at them. “Is that…?”
He blinks, hard, trying to quiet the swimming in his head and jolt the world back into focus. Vaguely, he registers Nick’s weight lifting off him, and the blurry outline of him walking away.
Dean meets his eyes, a barely-there spark of hope flashing across the green of his irises. But then it’s gone again, and Dean pulls away. He gets off the bed and walks to the open door of his closet. His jacket is draped over it, and Dean digs in one of the pockets until he finds a small, glinting object. He returns to the bed and holds it out for Castiel to take.
Castiel continues to tell his story, scenes forming and reforming around him, and before long, the two of them find themselves at the edge of a spring, tucked underneath a rocky cliff and shaded by a grove of birch trees.
Huh. Based on the many times he’s watched "Cockneys vs. Zombies," Dean’s pretty sure that’s a Cockney accent. You don’t hear a lot of those in the Midwest.
his loved ones to make it through the coming battle. So he deepens their kiss, licking at the seam of Dean’s mouth and pulling at his robe, impatient to feel the give and shift of muscle under naked skin.
Cas winces, acknowledging Dean’s point. “I did read that as an unfortunate and probably unintended double entendre, yes.”
The night they made their move, everything went wrong. They had barely begun their work when a night watchman spotted Missouri and pointed his gun at her, finger shaking on the trigger.
Castiel can feel Dean bristle next to him, but before either of them can truly react, Zachariah continues speaking. “Of course, it hardly matters. The real value of a man is in what he does for a living, don’t you agree, Dean?”
Determined not to be cowed, Castiel squares his shoulders and straightens his spine as he takes Claire’s hand and walks to the front door. Dean is right by his side, the warmth of him solid and grounding.
, anything at all Dean is willing to give him. Dean rolls his hips into Castiel’s, both their cocks fully hard again and dragging against each other, the friction of it so good, but not nearly
For a beat, there’s nothing but the scrape of their shoes against the uneven concrete of the sidewalk. Then, “How come?”
Dean blinks down at his lap, nodding slowly to himself. Then he gets up, grabbing the bottle off the table. “It’s my turn in the bed. You take the couch.”
And to have an easy out like that? It’s not like he really wants to do this work; it’s risky as fuck. It just so happens that he’s a good driver, and he needs the money.
At least he does until a fly lands right on his bottom lip while he’s trying to eat, and he almost swallows it along with a bite of his burger.
“The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence thrilled every fiber of my frame.”
a story worth telling.” He breaks off a big piece of waffle cone and puts another fry on top, stuffing the whole thing into his mouth. “Trust me,” he says, even as he’s still chewing. “I’m a writer.”
“Turns out you’re more trouble than you’re worth, Dean-o,” Nick drawls, leaning back lazily against the passenger door. Dean notes that he isn’t strapped in, presumably for better range of motion in case Dean tries to stop the car and run. “One of my little birdies tells me you went for a visit to the LAPD this morning. Whyever would you do such a silly thing?”
It probably should have occurred to Dean that he doesn’t even know what apartment Cas lives in. He stares down at the piece of paper in his hand, but the only number on it is the one he recognizes as the address of the building. He looks around and, to his relief, finds some mailboxes tucked away in the deeper shadows behind the stairwell. His heart beats a little faster when he sees that one of them is labeled “Castiel Novak” in Cas’ familiar, neat print. The mailbox reads “8” next to some kind of Chinese character, and he figures that means Cas lives on the eighth floor. It’s the best clue he’s got anyway.
“Well,” Dean shrugs, leaning his forearms onto his thighs and giving Cas a shy, sideways smile. “You were easily the hottest guy I’d ever seen, so I forgave you pretty quick.”
“The only one that counts, Dean,” Alastair hisses. “Possession. Complete control over the actions of a human soul. There’s nothing like it.” The demon’s joy sets Sam’s eyes flickering with manic glee, and Dean clenches his hands to control the nausea clawing up his throat at the sight.
Cas nods his acknowledgement and closes the door. He doesn’t turn his back on Dean and he doesn’t lock the door behind them, but it’s a start.
“Oh, um. Yeah. Sure.” Dean almost fumbles the Ziploc bag in his haste to get it open. When he finally manages to get a grip on the cookie, it’s perfect — crisp and crumbly and the exact shape it’s supposed to be. He breaks the cookie in half to reveal a small slip of paper tucked inside. Hands trembling, Dean pulls out the paper.
Of course, Dean lost his shit at that. Cas’ constant lone-wolf, self-sacrificial suicide missions were getting extremely old, and he was just so tired of it all. It was one thing for Cas to run off at every opportunity instead of staying at the bunker, with his family, where he belonged. But it was a whole new level of hurt, knowing Cas had made a deal that would take him out of their lives permanently, probably sooner rather than later, and he hadn’t so much as thought to share the news.
As Mick lets out a bone-deep, guttural death rattle, neon-green, viscous liquid spills forth from the wound. Dean jerks his hand back just in time, and he, Cas and Garth each take an instinctive step back as a radioactive rivulet of what is presumably Mick’s blood runs down his immaculately tailored suit, then drips down the stairs to puddle on the espresso-stained hardwood floor.
Both Charlie and Eileen notice the change in routine, of course, and ask about it. Dean makes up some excuse about Cas doing research for a modern-day novel set in a bookstore. This doesn’t explain why Sam comes by the store around lunchtime too, setting himself up in one of the reading nooks with a laptop and a stack of case files.
“Where’s the party again?” Charlie asks, and Garth rattles off an address before pulling Castiel in for a hug. Castiel stops for a moment to marvel at how natural the whole thing feels. There’s no awkwardness to it — just friends hanging out. Friends who happen to be naked, but without any sexual connotations. It’s freeing.
The white noise of his own thoughts is so loud, he doesn’t even notice Jo until she’s already dropped onto the chair next to his.
Dean knew they couldn’t stay at the bunker forever, but it's still a little daunting, giving up the first safe place they found after years of uncertainty and horror. He can see it in Sam and Cas’ eyes too, that slight edge of worry — what if everything they’ve carefully, slowly started to build falls apart the minute they’re out on their own?
“It’s, um. It’s not a good time, Dean,” he tells the closed door. “But I’m fine,” he adds, after a beat of silence from the hall.
“Think so,” Dean says, though he kind of doubts it. “But could you…?” He trails off and mimes Cas wrapping his arms around him.
Cas walks out from behind the counter, not letting go of the weapon. Without so much as acknowledging Dean’s presence, he moves past him and to the door, locking it.
No one’s more surprised than Dean himself when he says, “Me too, actually. Had a late night last night, so I should go get my four hours this time. I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”
He imagines those same hands curled around Dean’s throat, squeezing. Imagines himself watching helplessly through his own eyes, unable to make his body obey him.
he left. “You guys were still pretty new, but in spite of all the bad shit going down at the time, you seemed… happy. Don’t know that I’d ever seen you smile as much as you did around him.”
until Castiel can feel something tensing at his core, filling him up until his skin feels too warm, too tight around him. Dean takes hold of Castiel’s cock then, working him with firm, sure strokes, and Castiel spills between them just as Dean tenses up and shouts his name into the semi-darkness of the room.
They put in an order for two black coffees and chat idly until Charlie returns with their drinks. When she’s gone again, Dean leans down to rummage in his messenger bag. He reemerges clutching a printout of a Brain article.
Under the anxious direction of a man with the fatuous air of a low-level manager, the employees are busy affixing a blood-red banner to the rear wall. It reads, in impressive gold letters:
“I'd like to be inside you tonight. Will you let me?” Cas asks, reaching between them to slide his thumb across the tip of Dean’s dick through his boxers, where a wet spot is growing on the fabric.
Dean forces himself to remember that as long as the bullets he’s packing weren’t forged from angel blades, the real Cas should be fine. He raises his gun and shoots naked Cas in the middle of the forehead.
Still, there it is, undeniable: a drop of red, stark against the white porcelain of the bathroom sink. And another, and another, dripping steadily now. Dean looks up and finds a trail of red leading from his left nostril and down his upper lip.
Bobby took Dean under his wing, teaching him the intricacies of caring for gems and clunkers alike. He also had connections in the biz, and the first time he saw Dean behind the wheel of his Baby, he asked if Dean ever considered being a stunt driver.
Gabe digs in the inner pocket of his suit jacket for a badly creased booklet that turns out to be a racing form. “Tomorrow, we’re going to the dog track and putting the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.”
Instead of answering, Cas crowds into Dean’s space and pushes at his chest until Dean’s back is to the door.
Besides Dean, the only close friend Castiel has made is Balthazar, another student in the history department. Unfortunately, Balthazar is never terribly interested in talking about Dean, and the one time he brings up Castiel’s favorite subject of his own accord, it doesn’t go as well as Castiel might have hoped.
Vaguely, he remembers Sam coming in at some point to take away the rest of the booze and tuck him into bed. He was drunk enough that it didn’t take more than a small shove to make him keel over onto his pillow.
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, mostly. It’s one of the few places left where you can still get a decently priced drink or meal.”
“Yes,” Cas says absently, still looking at the doorway. “I thought I saw…” He shakes his head. “Never mind. Just my imagination. Let’s go.”
“To Dean,” he reads. He stops short for a beat, eyes wide, but then soldiers on to the bitter end. “This book would not exist without you. Thank you, my love.”
Cas heaves a deep sigh, like Dean’s being deliberately obtuse. Maybe he is? He doesn’t know anymore. “You said ‘for one,’ Dean. That would imply there was another item on the list.”
Castiel feels a faint echo of outrage at the idea that someone called the police on them for kissing in a car with their clothes on, but he swallows it down. They’ve probably had this conversation, perhaps more than once, and Dean looks a little distant now, like he’s caught up in the memory, so Castiel moves away fully and gets out of the car.
Dean nods his thanks and retrieves the flask, lying back on Cas’ mattress and turning the small metal object over and over in his hands. As the quiet of the dark bunk settles around them, Cas becomes extremely conscious of the soft sound of Dean’s breathing, and how they’re close enough that it’s almost impossible not to touch. It would be so easy, and Cas could have sworn Dean was being flirtatious during their conversation in the smoking room earlier.
“Hello, Sam.” Castiel smiles nervously as Sam sits down in the chair opposite. “It’s good to see you.”
“Until there’s no other choice?” Cas’ voice rises with every word, the tension in him snapping like a live wire. “Dean, when exactly will that be? Two days from now? Three? How do you think he’ll feel if you… when you…” Cas trails off, swallowing hard. “How will he feel if he never got to say goodbye? What am
“The first thing you have to understand," Dr. Mia Vallens says, "is that there’s nothing wrong with you."
Cas leaves a little while after that, to try to get some work done, and it isn’t until Charlie goes home and Eileen arrives for her afternoon shift that Dean realizes the problem with Cas coming to trivia night.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks, keeping his voice soft, non-confrontational. He can still salvage this; he just has to tread carefully.
“The police told me,” Castiel interrupts, fighting to speak past the roiling mix of fear and grief that has him by the throat. “Are you safe?”
“We’ve started calling it his Dark Day.” The shake of Sam’s head is sad and fond in equal measure. “Though not around Jack, of course. We just tell him that Daddy has to go out of town for a day and he’ll be back again tomorrow.”
Finally, he zips up the duffle with the money inside and grabs the straps so tightly, his fingernails dig into the soft flesh of his palm. He’s going to track Bobby down, if he has to drive all over town to do it.
Dean uses his thumb first, pulling and teasing at the ring of muscle around Castiel’s hole, circling it, but never dipping inside.
Dean leans back against the bench, eyes fixed on the sky again, searching for Andromeda. How do you find something when you don’t even know what it’s supposed to look like?
Sam waves him off. “Well, anyway, the point is, she said she wouldn’t accept my help on the case unless I gave her a chance to prove that she wasn’t a fraud.” He leans in even further, until he’s more than halfway across the table. “Do you have any idea what the statistics are on people who try to defend themselves in court?”
On second thought though, it wouldn’t hurt to at least find out what Charlie wants to tell him, right?
When they get to the dining room, a lovely breakfast buffet is waiting for them, consisting of eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes and various pastries, along with juice and freshly brewed coffee.
Dean adds a second finger, and Castiel’s hips work into a frantic rhythm. The tip of his cock is almost touching the sheets, but not quite, and it’s just as well, because Castiel wants this to
His esteem for Marv hardly grows when the next thing out of his mouth is, “And yet you asked. Must be hard to get into the right frame of mind for picking a sex column when you practically have ‘dry spell’ stamped on your forehead.”
With a final shimmy and a spread of his arms, he walks back to rejoin the band, which is still playing, transitioning into the next piece. As he squeezes past Donna, the edge of his suit jacket snags on one of the seats, and something metallic hits the floor with a loud
thinking,” Castiel says, and then, because it’s all he’s been able to think about, he surges forward and presses a kiss to Dean’s lips. “You were being stupid, and you should have called me.”
“I understand,” Cas says, but grips his mug a little tighter, trying to ground himself in its solid warmth.
“Well…” Betty’s eyes take on a faraway, dreamy look that immediately alarms Castiel. “You started talking about your friend Dean a lot. How he has very green eyes and nice, soft hair and the prettiest smile.”
Dean sinks into the other chair, wincing a little at the hard surface. It almost seems like it was designed for deliberate discomfort. They probably don’t want people getting too cozy in here. “Answers about what?”
Dean’s been working on learning ASL for his sister-in-law’s benefit, but his skills aren’t anywhere near hers and Sam’s, so they both talk as they sign to help him keep up.
At the mention of the word “mate,” Cas flinches and struggles harder. Dean takes an almost involuntary step forward. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Garth doing the same.
“No idea.” Dean lets go of Castiel’s arm, much to Castiel’s chagrin, and takes Jack’s hand instead as they cross the street. They make their way to Rowena’s dance studio, where the meeting will apparently be held, judging by the number of people currently walking towards it from all corners of the square. “But smart money says it’s no emergency.”
Dean already knew it had to be, knew he hadn’t been talking to anyone else on ConnectYou, but it’s still a punch to the gut.
Missouri spends the next two hours showing him how to draw sigils to weaken or banish demons, and devil’s traps to imprison them. She teaches him the words to a Latin exorcism that will force a demon from its vessel, and a blessing to recite for making holy water. She watches as Cas fashions a hex bag that can hide him from supernatural creatures.
When it came time to choose his major, Dean thought back to evenings spent in the kitchen with his mom, and her anecdotes from the crime beat at the KC Sun. That time she’d turned up a crucial piece of evidence that helped the police identify a serial arsonist. The deep, satisfying glow of knowing she’d played a part in making sure a bad guy couldn’t hurt anyone else.
He shakes his head, smiling, and turns on the small bedside lamp. When he looks up, Cas is closing the door, his back to Dean. He doesn’t turn around, even as he starts unbuttoning his shirt. (Who knew that anyone could make pink flamingos look so damn attractive?)
Dean’s throat produces a strangled sound. “I tried apologizing, and offering her money too. Don’t think she wanted either of it. But listen, you’re, um, you’re kinda freaking me out here. Are you saying this woman really put a…” He trails off, still feeling ridiculous every time he’s about to say the word “curse.”
Except there’s no formal law enforcement anymore, and a jail cell wouldn’t have a bunch of guns mounted on the wall, in pride of place above the bed.
Dean’s hand lands on his arm. “Oh no you don’t, Cas. You’re an official resident of Lebanon now. Gotta do your civic duty.”
“I told you, the apartment supervisor is my uncle,” Betty says. She springs off the couch and gives both Castiel and Dean a once-over. “You guys look happy.”
Castiel nods. Because it’s true, distressing visit from his mother and occasional irritation with Balthazar notwithstanding. He
“Anyway,” Charlie says, shrugging. “This year, I figured I’d pay him back by decorating the town a little.”
Castiel opens his eyes (when did he close them?), wanting to see Dean’s face as he says the words again, wanting to hear them spoken back with reckless abandon. Instead, his gaze catches on something at the other end of the room.
Castiel’s laugh is startled out of him, wet and raw, and it won’t stop. It keeps bubbling up, not caring that he’s having a hard time catching his breath with the sheer muchness of this night, of his hand held in Dean’s.
If anything, he seems a little shy now. He ducks his head, and then his eyes flick up for the barest of moments, looking at Dean from under long, dark lashes. Even in the dim glow from the streetlights overhead, those eyes are very, very blue. “I enjoyed watching
Castiel nods his thanks and sinks into the cushions of Gabriel’s couch. It’s been a while since he’s been here. Their relationship has become a little warmer over this past year, especially since their joint summer vacation, but it’s still rare for them to actively seek out each other’s company.
When Dean looks over at Meg, she’s studying the squat and sturdy Taurus G2C 9mm in her lap. A black ski mask is sitting bunched up on top of her head, like the world’s least flattering crown.
Castiel was sufficiently angry last night that he considered leaving without any kind of message to his mother. But whatever her faults, Naomi cares about him and about her granddaughter’s well-being, and Castiel likes to think he’s not a cruel person.
“If you two promise to behave, I’ll take Mr. Winchester’s license to my cruiser and run it through our system. That should tell us what we need to know,” Hanscum says, looking back and forth between them with evident concern and just a hint of confusion.
again?” Dean’s voice sounds mocking, but he seems to regret his tone when he catches sight of Cas’ expression.
All it takes is a gentle tap on the hip for Dean to lift up and allow Cas to slide his jeans down his thighs. Entranced by the imprint of Dean’s cock against his boxer briefs and the small wet spot near the tip, Cas bends down to mouth at it.
Less than a minute later, Cas pulls up next to Dean. He gets out of the car, and there’s a soft, happy shine to his eyes. “Dean,” he says. “This place is beautiful.”
“Research,” Dean says blankly, until the pieces slot together. “You’ve been watching porn so you’d know what to do in case we ever had sex?”
Dean likes to peek over Cas’ shoulder while he’s writing, but he always gets batted away, because “it’s not good yet, Dean. It’s just words at this point.” So he retreats, but not before he gets a kiss for his trouble.
Gabe nods vaguely, eyes now following a girl with dark hair and a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “Yeah. Why?”
Dean huffs, taking refuge in the sense of grievance that always sits just below the surface when it comes to Cas. “It’s not like you’ve exactly done a great job of talking to me, man. I’m still mad you made a stupid deal and didn’t even tell me.”
Inside, though, it looks nothing like a smuggler’s hideout — more like a mad scientist’s lab, except the scientist is an artist. Every chair and table is covered in pencils, paints and other art supplies, and Dean can’t see the walls for all the paintings and drawings; some finished, some not. Most of them show places in or around Porto Azzurro, though some are of Cas and one is of a man with brown eyes and long, messy hair. That one has furious red scribbles all over it.
Also next time: In the past, Dean gets another chance to say goodbye. In the present, Dean makes a new friend who has game-changing information to share.
He looks a little lost. It reminds Dean of the times when Sam was little and wanted to know when Dad would be home. Dean usually told him some reassuring lies, but he just can’t think of any for this particular situation.
It’s the third week of school now, and Dean has been texting Castiel all day, claiming he’s reached his limit for thesis research and needs a break. Castiel makes various suggestions — take a nap, switch subjects, drink more coffee — but none of them seem to please Dean.
Castiel shakes his head in disbelief. “Your own son is more mature than you.” He gets up. “I need five minutes. Keep an eye on Jimmy, if you think you can manage.”
Dean’s lack of funds means he never moved out of his parents’ house, even when his parents were no longer in the picture. He only has another couple of years to go on the mortgage, at which point he might be able to spend money on some of the finer things in life. Like a suit for work that didn’t sell for sixty percent off the sticker price because of a weird stain on the collar.
He starts the engine. By the time he buckles himself in, he’s already flooring the gas pedal, executing a hairpin turn around a lamppost to make it to the exit of the lot as fast as possible.
A surge of affection wells up in Castiel’s chest, all the more powerful for how unexpected it is. He nods his permission. With remarkable gentleness, Dean cradles Jimmy’s head and scoops him into his arms as he backs out of the front seat.
“Doesn't matter.” Dean slides his thumb across Cas’ forehead, watching as the crease disappears under his touch.
Thumbs hovering over his phone screen, he considers calling the whole thing off. But he hasn’t seen Eileen in weeks, and if he does cancel, he knows how the night will go. He’ll curl up on the couch with a bottle of whiskey and check his phone every two minutes, like a pathetic idiot.
“Please, Cas,” he hisses, not sure he could keep his voice steady if he raised it above a whisper. “Want you inside me.”
Castiel digs the nail of his thumb into the soft flesh of his palm, the slight sting of it helping to settle him as he chooses his words. “Mother, I’m very grateful to you for all that you’ve done for me and Claire. All I ask—” He looks down at his hands, then back at the diner, taking comfort from the soft glow of the lights inside and from the knowledge that Dean is there, closing up from the day’s business. “All I
“I’m ready,” he breathes out, nosing at Dean’s hair, at his temple, kissing the sweat that pearls there. “I’m good. Fine. Need you. Please, Dean.”
Hope and fierce affection rear up, and I remember another night; another conversation about going home.
Dean’s arrival has set off the bell above the front door, and Cas’ head snaps up at the sound. With some unease, Dean notices there’s a shotgun resting across his lap.
Poe Homes is a real public-housing complex and yes, it’s next to Edgar Allan Poe’s former home. One of the highlights of the annual Poe festival is a reenactment of Poe’s funeral procession and wake, including a wax replica of his body.
Castiel nods politely at the formidable, middle-aged woman who rules over the Roadhouse’s bar with an iron first. Dean seems happy to reintroduce him, so Castiel refrains from pointing out that he’s been living in town for the past decade and sees Ellen most Sundays at the farmers market in Fountain Park.
Garth gets up, and he and Dean both step forward to shake hands. “A pleasure,” Ketch says, warmly. He seems to be British as well, and even Dean knows enough to recognize his accent as a much more sophisticated one than Mick’s.
With a sound almost like a sob, Dean bears down, pushing into Castiel slow and deep. Castiel’s body rolls up to meet him, and the give-and-take of their rhythm feels natural, instinctual. Castiel breathes into it, loses himself to it, escalating waves of arousal carrying him along.
The chorus of scoffs and mutters that meets Dean’s statement is painfully familiar. He ducks his head and smiles. “Hey, I get it. You’ve heard it all before, and it sounds like bullcrap. Believe me, I was right there with you.” He looks up at Cas to find him already watching, a small smile on his face. “But then I met my husband, and he… he made me believe that there really might be a way to move on from your soulmate and be happy, you know?”
“Please?” Jack asks, directing big, wet puppy eyes at Castiel. In the face of Jack’s expression, all his hurt and irritation melt off his skin as quickly as a single snowflake.
Charlie bounces up from her seat with the enthusiasm of a sugar-addled toddler and wraps her arms around Dean from behind, mussing up her fashionably cut bob against his stubbled cheek. Dean got a bit of a late start this morning, so his shave wasn’t as thorough as it might’ve been.
With a sigh and a creak of joints, Bobby sits down on the foot of the mattress. “What d’you remember about last night?”
“Come here,” Cas says again, pulling Dean into another kiss, fingers tangled in his hair, tugging gently. And suddenly, one of Cas’ hands travels down between them, and Dean feels another man’s fingers stroking him for the first time. He gasps at the gentle tease of it, loose fingers traveling up and down his shaft, swiping across the head. He rolls his hips down, trying to move closer, get more, and Cas chuckles. In response, Dean tightens his hold on Cas’ cock and speeds his movements.
Dean doesn’t open to him, and after another moment, to whistles and catcalls, he pulls back, not meeting Castiel’s eyes. There’s a smile on his lips, but it’s too shaky to be a real one.
Castiel nods, his mind racing to come up with a solution that will keep Dean from putting the rest of his things into the open suitcase that sits between them on the floor. “So we’ll be careful. We’ll only see each other here, not in public. At least until we figure out a way to get you out of this.” Castiel reaches out again, and this time, he doesn’t pull back. His hand lands on Dean’s where it’s resting on his thigh.
When he checks the display, he recognizes Rowena’s number. His hands shake when he picks up the call.
“Wheeeeee!” Claire echoes from the backseat, throwing both arms in the air for good measure, and Castiel laughs harder than he has in a long time.
Of course, Dr. Vallens hears him, because she’s got some kind of fucked-up super hearing. “Anything you want to share with us, Dean?” She gives him that look: the one where she dips her chin and narrows her eyes, as if to say,
There’s three payment tiers: one that just gets him the basic search, a medium one that gets him the search as well as access to the ConnectYou message boards, and a premium one that includes all that, plus matching ConnectYou t-shirts for him and his “lost connection” and a free photo shoot of their first meeting. That option sounds a little weird, so Dean chooses the medium one and enters his credit card information before he can second-guess himself.
looking forward to, no matter what Garth has been insinuating), and then pretend to let himself be staked.
He strides to the fridge and starts to pull out the ingredients he’s going to need. Apples. Eggs. A lemon. A stick of butter. As he crosses to the pantry to retrieve the flour and spices, Mrs. Butters blocks his way; diminutive, but immovable. “At this hour? Dear, you look exhausted.”
He turns away from the mirror, blinking into the late-morning sunlight that streams in through tall, narrow windows. They’re in a small multi-purpose room that’s been set up expressly for Castiel to change in. Aside from a cheerfully patterned carpet, the room contains nothing but the mirror, a couple of chairs and a small side table with snacks and a mostly full bottle of champagne.
The man says nothing at first. His eyes drag up and down Cas’ body, the movement overly familiar, almost obscene. Eventually, the man’s gaze comes to rest on the name tag pinned to the front of Cas’ vest. “Hello there, Cas.”
Capping his rebellious day, Castiel snuck past the CEO’s office to head home almost two hours before his usual time. That gesture felt particularly daring because Zachariah Novak likes to keep close track of who spends how long at the office. He seems to operate based on two rules: first, more is always better; and second, leaving before sundown shows insufficient commitment to the job.
“There!” Gabe points halfway down the block at a gloomy driveway set into the first floor of an office building. Their goal now in sight, Cas and Gabe quicken their steps, trying to get to any kind of space that will offer even a slight bit of shelter from the wind, and from the driving snow that’s now started up.
It starts again as he’s pulling into the parking lot at home, and no amount of pinching his nose seems to make it stop, so he walks upstairs with the sleeve of his jacket pressed to his nostrils.
In fact, Cas is determined to go to bed without delay and have a good night’s sleep that will definitely, absolutely not be disturbed by dreams of Dean Winchester.
The coffee isn’t quite as good as Dean’s, but the food is delicious, and Castiel soon goes back for seconds. As he loads up his plate, he bumps into a young, dark-haired woman wearing a black chef’s jacket and a wicked smile. “Enjoying the food?” she asks, in a tone that suggests it’s some sort of test.
“Not to be a stick-in-the-mud,” Cas says, completely ignoring Dean’s immediate snort, “but what does that have to do with the show?”
They sit in silence, watching the progress of the night watchman’s flashlight across the cemetery grounds and cataloguing it in the notebook they’ve brought along.
“I didn’t believe it was you,” Castiel blurts, before he can overthink it. “When you told me your name. I thought… I thought maybe someone was playing a joke on me because—” He falters and watches the water, where a small motor boat sputters past, carrying oyster cages. “Because you were the one I was looking for. On ConnectYou. And—”
“No, listen,” Dean hates the pleading note in his voice, but maybe pleading is the only way to make Cas understand. “I’m doing this to help. To keep you and Jimmy safe.”
In fact, he has his back turned, busy talking to a man in a luxurious black coat and a gleaming pair of spats. In passing, Cas hears the cop say “Toothpick Marv.” But Gabe pulls him along, and soon they’re out of the alley and in the comparatively bright environs of the sidewalk in front of King’s Funeral Parlor. A furious group of squirming, cursing line girls is being crowded into a squad car by a small handful of overwhelmed-looking uniforms. Cas and Gabe head the other way, blending into the small crowd that’s gathered on the sidewalk to watch the commotion.
Lost in that thought, he jumps a little when Cas puts his hand on his lower back, a warm, heavy weight guiding him to the place they came here for — the bar. He lets himself be led, but shoots Cas a warning glare. This isn’t the kind of place where they can afford to be handsy; not unless they’re spoiling for a fight. For once, Dean isn’t.
Four hours later, Castiel finds himself signing a stack of papers that will let him trade in his BMW and purchase a gently used Ford pickup. The sales associate explains something or other about warranty and insurance, but Castiel is distracted by the view through the dealership’s windows: Dean pulling silly faces at Jack and Claire until all three of them are doubled over with laughter.
“Is there anything to say?” he asked instead, so careful as if Dean could shatter at any minute, at the slightest probing. He hated it. “He loved you. And—”
Cold wind swirled through the trees’s crowns, ruffling their hair and taking some leaves. They rose in momentary cheer, dancing and spinning through the air, but eventually, they all fell down. Soon enough, grey feathers joined them on the dancefloor, adding a contrast to chaos of mostly red and orange.
— spoke three damned words and disappeared. His answer was still stuck in his throat, making it hard to breathe.
Hope flared up in the hunter’s body at the best sound he’d ever been blessed with, and he moved to stand in his love’s orbit. It was home more than the guitar solo he’d tried to learn to play at 16, or the false notes he and Sam sang along in the impala. It was warmth inmidst cold nothingness. Dean looked at Castiel, who stood there, dazed, confused and worried, and found light in the midst of this endless void. The smile he couldn’t help was the one he greeted real wins with, when for once, nothing had gone astray. Dean had seen heaven; it didn’t remotely compare.
Dean grinded his teeth together and clenched his hands into fists. He found the anger that so often masked his pain, and gathered the courage to look up again. Jack’s sad stare broke his heart all over. He must’ve been there when Cas made the deal, he realized. This was his father he just lost, and Dean is taking all the attention on himself like the selfish being he is.
Castiel rustled his wings to get more into the mix, hoping the wonder of their play would spark some emotion. A sad smile adorned his features, slowly dying. He didn’t feel it. Ever since he regained his grace, he missed those little things that made him
A gooey portal opened up behind Dean at the same time as the door broke under Death’s knocks. They were shielding each other from the ones who wanted them dead, but for once, it wouldn’t be enough. Cas placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder, still bleeding from the sigil he’d drawn on the door.
. The words still rang on his tongue after all these years. It was the one thing he would never regret. The warmth it had spawned within him melted the effects of his icy grace, burning him with something that was so inherently
“Dean?” he asked, desperate for clarity. The human didn’t answer. In fact, he showed no sign he’d heard him in the first place. “Dean,” he tried again, almost whining now. Still, no answer.
He walked into the darkest night, hoping his light was following. No, Dean shook his head. He’d seen darker. The darkest night was an empty void taking his crying love from him, right in front of him, while he stood there paralyzed. This was nothing compared to the waves of grief pulling him under then. There was still hope, and it was in the adorable angel stubbornly following him.
“Are you sure you don’t want to do a bit more research? We’ve barely scratched the surface,” Sam pleaded, but Dean shook his head.
Something crunched under Dean’s shoes, but he didn’t stop to see what it was. It could be bones for all he cared. All he knew was that he had to keep walking. This was their only way out, their only shot, and he was not about to throw it away. He didn’t really know where he was going. Or maybe, he did; it was confusing. He moved step by step, steady and determined, letting his instincts lead him, somehow, somewhere called home. If this was one of those cheesy chick-flicks, they would say he was following his heart. But how could he, when his heart was walking behind him?
. And there was happiness because of the angel, there always had been. Dean took a deep breath, collecting the words that burned his tongue. This time, they wouldn’t be a goodbye, an apology. They’d be a new beginning, the sun rising after a long night. Even if they wouldn’t make it, even if they’d falter and fail, they’d find peace in this moment, in these words.
The hunter shook his head in resigned anger. Nothing was ever as it seemed. “Castiel!” he screamed out, filling the word with love as much as he could. “Cas! Where are you, man?” His voice broke, and a tear fought its way into the open. He shouldn’t have let him go, shouldn’t have even given him the chance to. It would haunt him forever. It was just like purgatory. He shouldn’t have let him go. How could he have ever made the same mistake twice?
He hid the slight tremor in his hand by subtly moving it behind his leg. “Who are you?” he asked back. He was close, he could feel it; Cas must be just around the corner. If only he could find said corner.
Dean had taken the case in the nearby town because of its proximity to the coastline. They’d never been at the beach, he said in rare excitement. It was almost addicting to see Dean this happy. He deserved it. Cas looked up as the sun waved its goodbye in the background, painting the sky in blazing colors. He smiled as his eyes found a hunch of green in it.
“I can get you to the Empty, but you have to find Cas on your own,” he clarified, “And have to ask for the long way home. It won’t be easy.”
But that wasn’t what shattered him, slowly and delicately teared him open like even hell hadn’t ever managed to. What made him pray to whoever was willing to listen, knowing nobody would come to their aid, was that Cas was crying.
Dean sat on the ground, fighting desperately against an onslaught of sobs, shoving Sam’s arms away as he attempted to hug him. He didn’t deserve comfort. Hell. he should be the one giving comfort. Sam had just lost Eileen, and Jack lost his father, and Dean couldn’t handle how he was ripped apart again and again. Here he was, the big brother, the secondary, or more likely, third father figure, and he was the one throwing a tantrum in grief.
Dean would never believe his luck. A part of him would never believe this story, scoff if told to him, memories already bathed in doubt. He couldn’t trust his own mind, could he? Soothing grace touched his mind, assuring him once more.
The clouds darkened around them, throwing them into an eerie silence. In a blink, Dean’s figure was almost gone. Castiel reached out again, stumbling over his eager feet, but he knew he could never touch him. Not here, not now. His true happiness lies in something he can’t ever have.
“I really didn’t need to see that,” Sam, ever the cockblock, interrupted. As Castiel turned away, Dean pulled him back for a quick peck, just for the hell of it. He was allowed to do that. Holy hell, he was allowed to do that. No cage in hell would ever be able to contain his grin, not ever again.
“It’s good to see you back,” Sam greeted them before Dean could think of a good retort to his earlier line. He welcomed Cas with a hug, and then embraced his brother too. The last time Dean didn’t mind everything being so lovey-dovey must’ve been when they were kids. Or maybe in the Empty. Not that he’d admit that. He briefly squeezed Cas’s hand, just to remind himself that he was still there. The angel looked at him, smiling softly, and laid his head on his shoulder, nuzzling closer.
The angel remembered stabbing Dean, over and over again. It was one of the memories the Empty had tortured him with, had filled his nightmares with. The place’s icy grip stuck to his bone like bubblegum to a shoe; he couldn’t escape it.  Shouldn’t Dean be dead anyway? Cas didn’t know what’s real anymore. He’d killed him, long ago, and then was ready to be killed by his very hands too, corrupted by the mark, a soul tainted black. Why would he ever come to get him out?
He heaved in a heavy breath, hot with irritation. Then, the words registered. Dean blinked. He couldn’t care less whether the Empty lost sleep, it had slept for millennia, after all, and it would do so until the end of time. Cas was here, so really, who were they to question him? Did they think they could just take him, especially after that speech, without him following? For an eternal entity, it could be incredible stupid.
“Dean?” Sam asked, crouching down before him. When had he come here? How long had he been standing there? Numbly, Dean looked up, so much pain exhibited behind glassy eyes. Then, he looked away in shame and wiped his eyes.
He trekked on, no matter how long the way home would be. He blinked into the light now, throwing shadows around them on rough mountain walls. It was their light at the end of the tunnel; Dean couldn’t help but wonder whether that meant they were dead. Had they already failed?
They could make it, they could win. They always managed, somehow. Reality and love could win against the cruelest of gods. Dean turned around, gasping as he greeted his angel. There he stood, in all his glory.
Maybe, in this moment, they found a new destination that would always lead them back to each other's arms, or maybe it had been there all along. Their journey was the same as yours, the same as anyone’s, yet so uniquely different — they’ve defied the universe, won a challenge set up to fail. At last, they knew the way, knew where to place their feet — where they’ve always been going. Home. Turned from promise to reality, alive between their arms. Home. The long way round.
“I love you,” Castiel confessed. The words stabbed right through Dean. Cas’s eyes were so impossibly sincere, and Dean knew it was real. He’d wrecked the angel to the point he was his moment of true happiness, his death sentence.
“What do you mean?” Dean frowned, “I’m getting you out of here, of course. You really thought I’d let you rot here? ‘Cause no way, man!” The small flicker of hope in the angel’s eyes teared right into Dean’s damaged heart. Alas, it was accompanied by sorrow, almost an apology in those blue eyes.
Dean couldn’t take it anymore. Did everyone know except for him? “Yeah, I know,” he snapped, his voice breaking like a teenager’s, just with more tears. “That’s the whole damn problem!”
Dean brokenly chuckled at the memory. The angel had been so innocent back then, so eager to prove himself, to become a part of their team. Dean hadn’t taken him seriously, not really. He’d been so different, so tamed, and he wasn’t sure how to handle it. His fault. And then, he’d interrogated that cat, and chose to stay behind with Fred Jones. Nothing really made sense, but it was intriguing, charming.
Eventually, a whisper answered him, barely audible. “Who are you?” He scanned the area again and again, but there was no figure to attribute it to. It came out of nowhere, quite literally. “Who are you?” it repeated, closer to him now. It was a choir of voices speaking in unison. Dean shuddered.
Dean tried to swallow the pain, wet his dry throat to prepare for an answer. Because Cas deserved it. He hated how he was only allowed to hear this in his friend’s death bed confession, how, of course, everything he ever dreamed off turned real in a nightmare. Careful what you wish for, or some shit like that. It wasn’t fair.
“The Empty claimed him,” Jack stated, and Dean couldn’t do more than nod. The boy looked down, reminding Dean suddenly of his young age. “He did this for me.”
Castiel’s feet ached in tune with his heart as he walked. It is a weird, longing feeling, and he almost raised his hand to reach out to the man walking in front of him.
He hadn’t stumbled over anyone yet, just put one foot in front of the other. He’d run if he had any idea where he was going. Cas was here, somewhere. He just had to find him. It was purgatory all over again. “I need you, dumbass,” Dean mumbled, his eyes searching tirelessly. “So, where are you?”
He wanted to touch him, to feel him, to hug him, just to make sure he’s really here. Castiel knew it was against the rules, they were not to touch each other as Dean was not allowed to turn around the entire way, but the angel couldn’t help himself. He was never the biggest on rules. But still, Dean remained just out of reach. Worse yet, fog rose as they walked, clouding Castiel’s view.
“Thank you, Jack,” Dean nodded, “And Sam, Cas is alone in there. I can’t—I can’t leave him there. I have to do this. For
. It’s exactly what he’d done. He found his sun and flew too close, watched his dreams fall like his brethren, beautifully like shooting stars. But, Dean came. He came to bring him home. Was it all a dream? The sun came down, reaching out to him in the absence of light, as he’d done so long ago in hell.
Next to him, Dean bowed down towards the water only to be surprised by an oncoming wave. He almost jumped away but was caught by the sand. Cas raised his eyebrows. “Cold?” he teased. Dean retaliated by splashing water his way.
. “He chose to save you.” Yeah, because this was what the angel came down to. Saving Dean Winchester. “This was his decision, it’s not on you.”
“Good,” Dean answered with a lopsided grin and took off his shoes. Castiel questioned him by tilting his head. “Because now that we’re here, we’re not gonna leave without feeling the sand between our toes. Come on!” He ran the short distance to what was more of a sorry excuse for a beach and Cas followed, entranced.
“The pact requires true love,” the Empty stated, “do you meet its requirements?” It was still mocking them, filling the air around them with sniding qualm. A tear escaped Cas’s eyes and Dean was reminded of the acidity of them.
“Who are you to think that you could wake the Empty once more?” the voice asked, steadier and louder than before, like it had arrived. At the same time, he meant to feel breath on his cheek. He threw a punch into nothing as he spun around once more.
“No,” Dean shook his head, “I need to say it. Because you deserve to hear it.” Cas’s eyes were impossibly patient, giving him all the time in the world. He was the calm ocean against his forest fire, waiting for him like he’d done for years — Dean couldn’t let him wait any longer.
Instead, he nodded at Sam in appreciation and wrapped an arm around his angel. They’d walked through hell and worse, and showed the universe their love, and the universe had bowed to it. There was nothing left to hide, and nothing they couldn’t beat together.
“Dean,” Cas answered, his lips wrapping lovingly around the syllable like nobody else ever could. He was still beautiful standing there, still Castiel, and a tear escaped Dean’s eye. Grey dust grabbed at his vessel, beating Dean’s heart to smithereens, never to be healed again.
Cas returned his stare and considered his answer. The sun had risen again in front of him, and he bathed in his warmth, letting hesitant emotion be his guiding light. Wanting to take it all in, he stepped closer, almost reaching out to touch him -
“Goodbye, Dean,” Cas said and pushed him to the side. Limply, Dean fell to the ground like a damn puppet, like he’d been robbed all his strength that held him up. In a way, he was. The Empty’s dark and cold tentacles engulfed Cas and he was still smiling.
Dean looked at Cas as he said his next words, wanting to miss not a single moment of his reaction. His eyes only hopped onto the Empty’s form briefly. “We’re taking the long way home,” he announced.
It’s an old tale, from way back when, a tragedy woven between two hearts at odds with the forces of the universe. It was cosmic, epic, melancholic. Dean had always known how it ended. But there was something about knowing and still attempting it; it was a thing with feathers that perched in his soul, singing a tune regardless. He’d learned that from a friend of his, who was still standing in front of him, petering away, dust to dust.
“No,” Dean quickly intervened, “Don’t you dare say it.” The angel had a habit of thanking him before he died, and Dean couldn’t take losing him once more. “Don’t you dare. ‘Cause we’re getting out of here, Cas. I’m not leaving you here.”
Dean shook his head without looking at him. “I’ve got you. Let’s stay just a little longer.” He pleaded with a hopeful smile and Cas knew he was smitten.
Behind them, the sun disappeared behind clouds, revealing the familiar surroundings of the map room. Home. Dean looked back at Cas and smiled. With the angel at his side, it truly was home. They made it. Dean laughed in realization, and drew Cas close again, reuniting their lips. They made it.
Castiel looked away, out onto the water that was nibbling at the little sliver of sand that’s barely a beach anymore. He had neglected to realize that this strange melancholy was a feeling in of itself, something to lead him home. His smile awoke a little.
“Where’s Cas?” Dean’s heart stopped. No, that would’ve been a relief. His chest hurt as if someone grabbed his heart and squeezed it until every last ounce of pain dropped out. There was no hint Cas had ever been there on the ground Dean stared at, just the normal dust and dirt. They really ought to clean this place. Another day though. When his limbs weren’t so heavy they could’ve dragged him right to the bottom of the ocean. “Dean?”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Dean asked, watching the tears rolling down his friend’s face, the ones that were drowning him above all else. It wasn’t the way he dismantled him with words rather than weapons, laid him bare in a way nobody else had ever done, in a way that told of love, that pictured him as this bright being he wasn’t. Cas looked right through him. He always did. It made sense, since he’d gripped his soul and raised him from perdition all those years ago. Didn’t make it true though.
“The longer we wait, the longer Cas’s in there. I can’t keep him waiting. Plus, the kid’s story checks out.” At his brother's adamant pleading, they had looked into the story, and as far as they could see, Jack was right. And that was all Dean needed.
“Of course we did it,” Dean said, his cheeks starting to hurt with how much he was smiling. He never noticed how he could see them at the edge of his vision when he smiled wholeheartedly — something he knew was promised to happen a lot more now. “Who do you take us for?”
Cas slowly let his hand wander to Dean, who was shivering, hoping to provide some warmth. “We should go back,” he said. “You’re gonna catch a cold.”
No. Ancient, familiar rage boiled his blood and he narrowed his eyes, glaring at the shadows. It was bleeding love, protective and fierce. There was no fear, because everything was already on the line —  Dean had nothing left to lose. “Don’t you dare,” he growled, at nothing and everything in particular. They couldn’t lose now. Not with him standing in the light as Cas succumbed back to the dark — it wasn’t fair.
The tear Jack had opened flickered before them, promising hope just like Cas always had. Like the angel’s crack in his chassis, it was a tear in the universe’s fabric—it was literally breaking the story they were trapped in. Taking a deep breath, Dean stepped forward. In a blink, he saw Castiel stepping out of the portal only to be stabbed in the back, screaming his grace out in a last rebellion. It seemed that he was never allowed to stay alive.
“I love you,” he said, whispering the promise into the sky so it may let it be known to the whole world; Dean Winchester loves Castiel. It was a simple fact of life, and he was found.
. Nothing could ever bring them apart. Golden light drowned out the retreating darkness behind Cas, and the angel looked up in admiration, that childlike adoration in his eyes that had Dean absolutely smitten.
It was too good to be true, Castiel knew. He’d been trapped in a night sky without stars, captured in a last moment of happiness so he would always bear the guilt of having his happiness being the harbinger of tragedy. So his bliss was the start of his eternal torture. Wherever he looked, there were no stars, no hope, only failings. He’d broken the universe and now paid the price.
Jack mustered him with this confused look, complete with a slight head tilt, staring right into his soul like Cas had done, right down the tear the angel had ripped into it. “You were Castiel’s moment of happiness.” It wasn’t a question. He said it like it was so obvious, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Well, damn him for not seeing it. Throw him back in perdition, so that Cas could come save him again, could come back again, take him back to the start.
Dean shivered, stumbling in surprise at the threatening breath on the back of his neck. It’s just Cas, he told himself, but it took everything in him not to turn around. It would doom them. They were right, though. Castiel’s eternal promise was to follow him, however battered and bruised he turned out. How was he worth this? Was it truly love, devotion? Or had he infected him with his poison, and it was mere manipulation?
Cas shrugged and gazed back at the sea. “Watching the sunset,” he replied. The sky’s last flames caught in Dean’s eyes, and the angel couldn’t help but stare and admire how much more beautiful the firmament would be if it were green instead of blue.
His soul had been broken and shattered countless times, but now, every last particle constructed a wondrous mosaic with the ragged pieces of Cas’s grace, cosmic consequences pulling them together rather than apart. One could’ve called it celestial, heavenly, divine even; but it was fundamentally human, terrene.
Suddenly, Jack spoke up: “There might be a way.” Dean looked at him sharply, but the nephilim didn’t budge. He was sad, and there might be teartracks on his cheeks, but at this moment, he possessed a wisdom no three-year-old should exhibit.
of their feet dulled alongside color, and Dean strained to hear any sign of hope. For, why would the Empty let him go? Why would it give in so easily? But Jack had told them about the old tale, the deal that had to be respected were it to be tried again.
There was something off about the picture though, nothing ever as perfect as it seemed. His eyes shone with unshed tears, his smile smudged with sadness. He looked just like when they’d said goodbye the last time, and Dean couldn’t take it.
“The most epic love story ever written,” Jack answered and Dean blushed. Suddenly, everything was too warm and too much all at once. Realization was still sickering in, overwhelming the man. He retreated slightly, away from Castiel, even though the angel felt like safety, love, everything he’s missed for years and didn’t even realize he needed.
. Dean shoved it away, pushed it into comfortable numbness, but he couldn’t. Because Cas was leaving. He was saying goodbye and it was all to save Dean.
They were two stars finally found, lighting up the dark, walking away from the night sky, from a graveyard. Walking home. Their light burned on, growing to a calming, graceful blue as it filled their own sky. It was filled with a love that had done everything — it had defied the universe, defied doubts and fear — and had survived. But then again, what isn’t alive can never truly die. They’d pulled it into life, away from the realm of uncertainties, of will they, won’t they.
“Dean Winchester,” a thunderous voice growled, the vocal vibrations shaking the realm. Black goo was born from the night around them, slowly building up to a figure. It was a thing of nightmares—it’s skin moving, breathing, black goo; its eyes glowing dimly like forgotten stars; and worst of all, a wide, toothy grin. “Why are you here?”
Dean loosened their hug to look the angel into his eyes — the drowning blue a sky he was falling into, or maybe, flying. He gulped, suddenly nervous like a schoolboy standing before their crush. “There’s something I need to tell you,” he said, fighting against the instinct of wanting to escape these piercing, knowing eyes, because his words held so much weight. “I—,” he started and stopped. This was stupid. He’d said it before. He just let Cas out of hell through a deal that required true love. Why couldn’t he just say it?
, he would’ve replied once before, and some shadows still wanted him to, but he found that he didn’t care. Something had changed, and that something was the angel at his side loving him unashamedly. Castiel, who was never afraid to love.
“It’s me,” Cas confirmed, his form barely touching the light. There was a soft smile on his features, and Dean mustered him as if he saw him for the first time. His piercing blue eyes like home, so much more heaven than the guys upstairs could ever claim to have. His black hair, always a little disheveled.
He wanted to scream it out, wanted the whole world to know, but his throat was dry and his lips wouldn’t move. “Don’t do this, Cas,” he pleaded instead. It was all happening too fast. He was about to lose his best friend, his reason to live, his love—and nothing he could say could change their fate. Yet, the one thing he had to say, the one thing he had to give Cas before he went, he couldn’t.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean whispered, even if it was goodbye. Still, he kept going, never even daring to glance back. “Even when I can’t say it to your face.”
“Dean, I’m here,” Cas tried to say, “I’ll always follow you.” But the fog swallowed his words. It was too good to be true, it had always been. “You’re not alone. I’m right behind you and I have been all along.” His voice gave out as the suffocating fog filled his lungs, worse yet, closed his angelic eyes. He blinked, crying, wandering, hoping he was still walking the right way. A little light was there right in front of him, and that was all he had.
The silence he entered was suffocating, drowning him in doubt. Where’s the angel? Dean’s heart hurt, a confirmation that he’d gone. It had all been for nothing. Why did he ever think it would work? The universe wasn’t one to grant favors like that, not to them anyway.
Finally, he looked up again, breath slightly hitching. Behind Sam, Jack looked on in concern, hope still evident in his young eyes. It was the same hope that brought Cas’s eventual downfall. “He—,” Dean started. When did speaking become so difficult? “He saved me.”
The fabric of stars was in their hands, being overwritten as they stood there. “You’re not leaving,” Dean promised, and Cas looked up at his sun that lit up the world. Finally, Dean pulled him close, holding him in the here and now, just tightly enough to make sure that no dust escaped his vessel. “Not on my watch,” he whispered defiantly, his voice breaking, and Cas almost chuckled.
“It’s okay,” Cas assured him. As Dean glanced up at him, the angel’s face was lit up in admiration for his adoptive son. He had never seen something more beautiful, more serene than the love in his angel’s eyes. He was glowing with love, and Dean was basking in his light. He was the stars blinking hope into the night, the moon guiding the hunter home, the sun over a long lost planet. Otherwordly, yet wholly home.
The love the angel had seen within him, the one he’d claimed to be infected and infatuated with, it consumed him. He’d always assumed his anger to be worst, but really, it was just worry. The angel had been right. It was burning and blistering his skin like lava, like hell, but he couldn’t let that stop him, couldn’t deny it any longer. It was worse than hell as he stood there alone in the emptiness. He’d chosen hell. This? This had rolled over him like a sudden, cursed speeding train, but it’d been his fault through and through.
He could feel his palms sweating as he made his way up the stairs, and found he was staring at the way Dean’s arse moved when he walked. He averted his gaze and watched his feet move up the stairs instead, feeling like a pervert.
Gabriel looked up from the magazine he was reading, “Who, your mom?” he asked, “Well...to be honest nursing is pretty hard. You could just work for thirty minutes and you’d already be overworking yourself.”
“I’m not hungry anymore,” he heard his mother say, the legs of her chair scraping against the tiled floor. Castiel got up quickly, trying not to make any noise as he rushed to his room. He closed the door softly, hoping that his mother hadn’t heard. He heard hushed voices and then eventually footsteps coming up the stairs, but there was nothing more than that. His mother hadn’t heard him, but he had heard all.
He crawled into bed, but left the lamp light on his desk on; he wasn’t all that comfortable yet and he didn’t want to ruin his calm by seeing things in the dark again.
“And now,” Gabriel said, looking at Michael as if for permission. Michael nodded slowly and Gabriel continued, “And now...Lucifer’s broken out of the mental asylum he’s been in for the last five years.”
“I think we’d feel more comfortable keeping an eye on Castiel,” Michael said, looking towards Castiel for a reaction. He just shrugged – it was the safest idea after all. If Lucifer somehow found out where he was staying, and figured out which room was Dean’s, at least Michael or Gabriel could get a couple of punches in, in self defence. He would be weak on his own and he didn’t know how strong Dean would be against his older lunatic brother.
Castiel woke up that morning with his lower back aching. But it was a good ache. Well, more like it was an ache that came out of a good thing. A thing that made him feel loved and made him feel special.
? Castiel signed, looking at Dean’s face. Dean simply shrugged and bit into a sandwich he’d gotten from the snack bar, “I kind of do,” he said, “he seems nice, but I can’t trust him – he could easily hurt my mom.”
Everyone congratulated Dean on getting everyone out of the class early, but Dean seemed a little irritable about the detention aspect of it all. Castiel walked beside Dean the whole way to the library, while Dean complained about it all and about how much of a bitch Miss Rice was.
“It’s when you can’t talk,” Dean muttered, trying to avoid getting into trouble for talking when he wasn’t supposed to be.
“You can’t ground people for telling the truth,” Gabriel said, “that’s like locking someone up in jail when they’re innocent!”
When he got there, his mother was standing in the kitchen with her arms crossed in front of her chest, “boyfriend, huh?” she asked, her tone letting on just how much trouble he was in. Her eyebrow was cocked up on her arrogant face. He swallowed harshly before nodding slightly.
I'm sorry it's taken forever to post a new update, I literally just finished it in my math class. Life has been literal hell for me at the moment and I'm trying my best to hold on. I hope you enjoy this chapter and I'll try and upload the next update as soon as I can. Sorry for any inconvenience.
“Castiel was wondering...” Gabriel said slowly, trying to catch every movement of Castiel’s hands, “whether he could go over to a friend’s house and spend the night.”
Dean continued to eat his sandwich, a little moodily. Castiel wasn’t sure how to help in anyway; he wasn’t used to situations like this. His mother hadn’t met anyone ever since his father had left before he was even born. Gabriel and Michael had known the man and apparently he’d been a great big bag of dicks – but not as bad as their mother. Lucifer had even met him, but obviously Castiel couldn’t get Lucifer’s opinion.
I'm sorry it took forever to upload but my mental health has been terrible recently. This is the last chapter of the fanfiction and I made sure it was nice, big, and hopefully detailed enough. Admittedly, I left the end of the chapter with someone talking and without the hints of their future. But it's up to you what happened after that.
She smiled softly, “you can have dinner up in your room then, so you can get it done by whatever date it is due.”
Castiel fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow. He noticed with a small smile that the pillow he lay on, which used to smell like Dean was beginning to smell like him. It made him happy before he went to sleep.
These were the moments he wished he could talk. Mutter a silent sorry and then walk off, leave Dean abandoned in the school corridor. He couldn’t do this now.
Castiel nodded slowly, still looking at the man behind Mary who gave him a grim smile, “hi,” he said, as Mary went up to get Castiel a drink of water, “my names Chuck.”
Talking and eating at the same time was a talent of Gabriel’s, most of the time it didn’t even sound like there was food in his mouth.
“You totally cheated, Winchester,” Gabriel muttered darkly, throwing the remote onto the ground without much anger, merely feigned for entertainment.
“Pretty much,” Gabriel said, “So, what did you two get up to?” he asked, raising his eyebrows insinuatingly. He did this every time Dean and Castiel snuck off together, but admittedly the most they’d ever gotten up to was making out in the school toilets, sharing a cubicle. Not exactly the dream make-out spot, but you weren’t allowed to in the hallways.
Dean looked up and Michael was standing there, looking murderously down at the boy beneath him. It took Ashton a full minute to get back up, looking dizzy and in pain.
“Oh...hello,” her tone turned dark, Castiel looked up and his mother’s expression had turned a little pale, but she seemed relatively calm, “how have you been? Yes, that’s good. Anything I can do for you?”
Castiel felt safe, he was on the floor, curled up between his two brothers. Dean was either on the floor or the bed, he wasn’t sure. He’d closed his eyes and pretended to be a sleep long before everyone else had gone to bed. He hadn’t wanted to deal with anyone, not after everything that had happened. He felt like everyone was babying him – like he couldn’t take care of himself. Though he admitted he would have no chance when it came to a fight between himself and Lucifer, but he didn’t really appreciate the babying.
They took Michael’s car, rather than walking. It was easier. Their mother was out, working on some book with her company- trying to get some positive reviews off of big names authors, which apparently took a while to do.
It was a long hard confusing story to tell Mary, but eventually she began to understand the situation. She called the police and told them what had happened and where Lucifer might be. Twenty minutes later, they called back, stating that they couldn’t find Lucifer at the scene, and that there wasn’t enough evidence for the mother to be charged with anything.
“So,” Dean smiled, “I hope it isn’t too personal a question, but, is it mental or physical?” he asked. Castiel frowned slightly, but persisted to get out his books and write it on the piece of paper.
Gabriel grabbed the cartoon of orange juice and took a swig out of it, “exactly why I wanted to stick around!” he exclaimed, chucking the cartoon of orange juice back into the fridge. Michael got it back out, making sure to close it properly while glaring at Gabriel.
Castiel turned and looked to see Mary at the stove cooking more pancakes, Charlie was sitting at the other side of the table looking ready for food and Adam was getting out cups for everyone’s drinks.
Dean seemed to relax, then and there, holding his hand visibly on the table and listening to all the people talk but not hearing the words.
While he wasn’t too sure what his opinion of Dean Winchester was yet, he was happy to get off the dirty cafeteria floor and follow Dean towards his table of friends. When he got there, he was surprised to his brother, Gabriel there.
Gabriel smirked, “yeah I know...anyway,” he sighed and shifted in his beanbag, “he wasn’t as sane as we are. He was different, and when Castiel was younger he would always hurt him in some weird and wonderful way – mother didn’t think it was unusual, said it was just child’s play.”
“You’ve been standing in the middle of the corridor for the last five minutes,” Dean muttered. Castiel looked around at the empty corridor. Dean was right. Few students remained as well; getting extra things from their lockers for class or whatever else they were doing; finishing their cigarettes in the school bathrooms. Castiel bit his lip and looked down at the floor. He was turning into a massive mess.
“Oh dear,” Mary said, standing up automatically and grabbing a bunch of napkins. He thrust them into Castiel’s hands and told him to dab the area where the gravy was until it was all gone.
Dean walked forwards and wrapped his arms around Castiel, hugging him tightly. Castiel lifted his arms and put them around Dean’s neck, hugging him just as tightly, propping his head up on Dean’s shoulder. He looked over at Adam, who looked uncomfortable. He wondered if the boy was homophobic, or whether he was just uncomfortable with the public display of affection – either way Castiel didn’t care. He wanted to feel loved.
Dean frowned, “it’s a bit hard to ignore someone when they have you pinned against a locker and are about to punch your face in.”
“Why not talk Castiel?” the voice asked, despite having just said he knew why, “that’s right – I fucked up your vocal chords, now didn’t I?”
The cafe near the school is where they ended up. People were sitting around them, chatting as if nothing bad had ever happened in their lives, which was a much better surrounding, than say, a hospital, where some people were given life and others were slowly dying.
Dean watched as his mom paced back and forth in the lounge room, Sam was sitting on the couch, looking between everyone with a slight look of worry. They had told him what was going on, and that Castiel, Michael and Gabriel might need to stay for a while. Sam nodded and said he was willing to lend anyone a room.
The news of Lucifer Novak breaking out of a mental asylum was big news around the school; and like Gabriel had once said, Novak wasn’t a very common last name, so many people picked up that Lucifer was somehow related to three students in the school. But, Michael and Gabriel kept their heads held high, Gabriel even threatening a younger student that, if he didn’t shut up about it, he’d call Lucifer and set him on the young man.
The air seemed to disappear from the room as he felt metaphorical hands wrapped around his throat, the room around him seemed to grow darker as he felt warmth pour from his eyes and down his cheeks.
Castiel nodded and made his way to the desk where the teacher had pointed. On the way members of the class continued to give him weird looks; already he was known as the freak and he’d only been here for a few seconds. Mental mute was whispered around the room. Oh how he wished he could tell them otherwise in a way they could understand; at least not without getting back to the front of the room and writing it on the white board.
, Castiel thought to himself, smirking slightly as he opened his brown paper bag and pulled out his recess for the day.
Castiel wanted to hang up, but he couldn’t. All of his limbs remained frozen in their place, in fear. He could feel his body shaking and his breaths getting harsher. His brain felt dead.
Castiel looked at the far wall where nobody was standing, though he could say Gabriel’s smirk in the corner of his eye and Michael crossing his arms slightly, trying to look like he hadn’t agreed to Castiel staying in here with Dean.
Mary had called later on that afternoon saying she would be in late because there had been a car accident close to the hospital, which she said was a very lucky irony because it seemed most of the victims would be able to make it – and sure enough later on it was on the news. Dean pointed out that he could see his mom in the background, getting a stretcher and helping place someone on there. Castiel could see the look of pride on his face – he kissed his cheek softly and laid his head on the other boys shoulder.
He rushed towards the English rooms and hoped that he had the right room, as he knocked on light blue, terribly painted, wooden door. The door was opened and he walked inside the room, his teacher was standing at the front of the classroom, close to where the door was sitting, looking at him suspiciously.
It made him feel like he was Dean Winchester’s, that he belonged to him in a way he’d been told nobody else had. But it was an unequal ownership – he owned Dean too.
It always started off it with Dean saying ‘hey’ and sitting down next to him, pulling out his books. Then he would hold conversations with Castiel that lasted so long that his wrist became sore from writing before the class had even properly started. He liked Dean; he was friendly and funny but not a pushover. He stood up for himself and his beliefs whenever he could; though Castiel tried hard not to bring religion or anything into the conversation, which was quite difficult when it came to History.
When he’d found out he was Gabriel’s brother? He didn’t know how he’d felt; like he couldn’t approach the boy anymore; that there was some rule amongst siblings. You couldn’t be friends with both of them. Or flirt with one of them. Dating your best friend’s brother was a common cliché amongst the girls of the school – though he personally hadn’t heard of many boys doing it.
Castiel slowly sat up and tried to step around his brother’s bodies, he felt he stepped on Michael’s hand at one point, but his older brother simply grunted and curled in tighter on himself, snoring a little in an attempt to get back to sleep.
He was shut up by pair of lips pressing against his own, tugging softly on the hem of his shirt, flinging a leg over Dean’s own two. Dean broke away for a second, and the tugging on his shirt became a lot more frantic. He sat up, cold rushing in as Dean took his shirt off before throwing it into a stray corner of the room. He placed his lips back onto Castiel’s, feeling his body swell with warmth.
The big issue was telling Dean that if Castiel came over, he wouldn’t be the only one coming over. But, he knew Gabriel and Dean were good friends, and that would help, but he didn’t know how Dean felt about Michael.
When Castiel had been thirteen and some people within the special school had started dating, he had once tried to ask a girl out named Susan. She had shook her head and said that his scars were too scary. That’s when he started wearing scarves pretty much anywhere.
The door opened slowly and Sam popped his head into the room, looking at Dean with curiosity, “what are you doing up so late?” he asked, looking at the time on the alarm clock next to Dean’s bed.
They discussed a few more things, like school. They didn’t want their grades to drop but they didn’t want to put themselves in danger either.
He noticed Gabriel go pale, which was a rare occurrence, so when Dean noticed he instantly began to panic, “what?” Dean asked, “What happened? Is it really that bad?”
“This new guy she’s seeing is named Chuck,” Dean said over breakfast – he and Castiel were sitting outside of some cafe close to school. It mainly served cereal, coffees and tea. Some snack food – but at least it was good food, “she says he’s a godsend.”
Through-out the rest of the school day Castiel couldn’t help but feel excited. In Science, he couldn’t seem to concentrate. He didn’t know why but he couldn’t just stop thinking about going over to Dean’s for the night. Castiel wasn’t used to having friends, so he assumed that was what was different. He actually had a friend and he seemed pretty loyal about his friendship towards Castiel.
It seemed to be taking forever, and he got a scare at around one thirty in the morning when there was a light knock on his door.
Gabriel stood at Castiel’s locker, mobile phone held towards his ear. He waited and waited and eventually the tone stopped a voice replaced it.
“Seeing as your conversation seems so important,” she said, “would you like to share it with the class for an open discussion?”
He wanted to call the police, tell them where Lucifer might be. But what if he was wrong? He would be embarrassed and the police officers might think he was lying to them. That it was simply a prank.
“I’m disgusted, Castiel,” she said, clearly, her eyes shining with disapproval, “absolutely disgusted. After everything I have done for you – bought you food, given you shelter, even when you look like a freak-.”
Sam held out his hand, shaking Castiel’s hand confidently. Castiel tried, once again, to do the same.
He passed the note over to Dean with shaky hands, holding his breath in as his eyes scanned over Castiel’s messy writing. Dean looked up and gave him a smile, “so...you’re saying you like me?”
“Dean’s in the kitchen getting you another glass of water, just in case you needed it when you woke up.”
The dull dialling tone of the phone was enough to lull Castiel out of his state of shock. But rather that sitting the phone back on the desk, he dropped it onto the floor and ran out of the room. Not listening as the principal cursed him for being rude and breaking the new phone they’d purchased – running past Dean and Gabriel and not hearing them shout out for him. He heard Michael at some point as well, but he continued running, running and running until he was outside of the school.
But they may slow down again soon, because I have school tomorrow :/ I normally take my laptop with me to school and attempt to write at recess, lunch, and generally between classes. But do you know how hard it is to write ultra gay fanfiction in PUBLIC?
Castiel opened the door slowly and looked in, finding Dean in bed, awake, he grinned and slowly walked into the room, closing the door quietly behind him. He was supposed to be sleeping in Sam’s room and Michael and Gabriel were supposed to be sleeping in here. Mary had found out about the dating situation. But Michael and Gabriel had ended up swapping rooms just after Mary went to bed – saying it might be better if Castiel had warmer, more familiar company. Gabriel couldn’t help but wink when he had said that.
He heard footsteps come up behind him and immediately regretted sitting in a place where someone could easily creep up behind him. His breathing became heavy and in pants, the palm of his hands began to sweat, and he felt arms wrap around his body again.
“What?” Gabriel asked, “Like kicking your ass?” Gabriel blue clad character aimed and kicked Dean’s red clad character in the head.
“I didn’t catch that,” Gabriel said, sitting back further on the bed, sitting his back against the wall.
“And now, you do this to me,” she said, slamming her hand down on the countertop angrily, “do you have any idea of how this may affect my reputation?”
“No,” Mary said, “there’s Chuck’s number, the lady at the front desk at work, 911 and my direct work number.”
“And if you kill him,” their mother said, “then you get a lot of money, you get to leave the hospital, and my reputation will increase-.”
He started to undress, taking off his scarf first. It felt nice to have breathing room around his neck; it felt like the air was licking at that sensitive, scarred piece of skin. He slowly began to peel off his clothes, the skin where the gravy was spilled feeling a little warmer than the rest of his skin as it was exposed to the cool air around him. He got into the shower, happy to realise it was the same as his own.
When he finally snapped out of it, he stared at the door in front of him. There was a button, he pressed it, and he heard a ring from inside. There were footsteps and slowly the door opened.
Dean sighed, “I’m staying home tomorrow,” he said defiantly, “I don’t like the fact that you’re stressing.”
Kissing was slowly becoming one of Castiel’s favourite things to do. It was weird how suddenly it had turned from ‘thing he had never done before’ to ‘thing he always wanted to do.’
He knew he was young. But he didn’t care. He didn’t regret it – and hell, even if he and Dean split up in a few weeks, or a few months, or a year – he still wouldn’t regret it. Because Dean Winchester wasn’t the type of man you regretted being with, even if things ended horribly.
“Oh you know, just a break in from a psychopath,” Gabriel said casually, “alien invasion, gang came in trying to recruit members-.”
As soon as they got home, Mary was all over Castiel, wrapping him up in a blanket despite the fact that he was wearing his trench coat again and making him sit on the couch with promises of whatever hot beverage he preferred. He went for a cup of tea, because it felt like the perfect time for one. Coffee would just worsen his anxiety.
Castiel wanted to ask why, but didn’t know how well Dean would be able to see him sign in the darkness. He tried, but Dean seemed to get the gist, “I feel like being a sappy shit,” he mumbled, sounding tired, “plus...I can’t sleep...you’re too far away from me and I don’t want something to happen to you just because I couldn’t get to you fast enough.”
When it did open, Dean practically body checked Mary in order to get to Castiel. He ran straight to the couch and hugged Castiel tightly, almost making water spill everywhere, “you’re okay!” he exclaimed, “what the fuck happened?!” he asked, his voice cracking and going up a few octaves. He heard Gabriel whisper behind Dean, looking at Michael with amusement as he whispered the word “testi-pop.”
“We’re not allowed to have so many people in here at a time,” Mary muttered quietly, glaring at the four boys, “so behave and it won’t be a problem, understand?”
“I haven’t heard any threats, there’s been nothing on the news,” Mary said, scrubbing the dishes harshly. Sam had attempted to make grilled cheese using the microwave and it hadn’t ended well, “maybe you should go back to school for a while – but if anything happens you’re back to staying home for a while.”
Castiel knocked once and unlocked the door, Dean’s hand appeared through it and he handed Castiel a white shirt and a pair of stripy pyjama pants. After that came a pair of red briefs.
“Staying and not being allowed to go anywhere is quite boring when you think about it,” Dean muttered, pressing the buttons on his gaming control harder, as if that would make the attack much more affective, “at least with the thought that you can leave the house and go down to the shops or something – that makes staying home more entertaining. I feel like we’re just on lockdown with more things to do.”
Dean gave him an odd look, but then shrugged it off, “the reason I asked is because my brother is taking psychology here. He would have found it interesting to meet someone who was mentally mute.”
“Mo-!” Gabriel’s mouth was covered quickly by Michael’s hand. He glared at the older boy and said something muffled, which sounds an awful lot like ‘what the fuck!?’
Castiel nodded, hoping Charlie knew that he didn’t really mind as he went and grabbed his own warm pancake and chuck it on a spare plate. He didn’t know what to put on it. There was jam, syrup, and lemon and sugar?
Castiel woke up panting heavily and drenched in his own cold sweat. He looked at the time; it was two in the morning, much to his disappointment. For the last few nights, his usually peaceful nights had been plagued with horrific nightmares; all involving Lucifer, his older brother.
“I don’t understand,” Dean muttered, “why didn’t you guys take Michael’s car to school today?” he asked.
Castiel felt that last bit of negativity fly off his shoulders. He breathed in deeply and sighed with satisfaction. It made his heart soar.
Castiel bit his lip softly, he had liked the kiss but not the words that had come after. He didn’t want Dean to feel guilty for something he couldn’t prevent. Memories began slowly coming back.
Without motioning or signing anything, Castiel leaned in and hugged Dean tightly. The other boy instantly started rubbing his back soothingly as he began to make weird sobbing noises that didn’t even sound human.
Castiel nodded and shook the hand that was offered to him. So this was Chuck, the godsend. He was wearing the same uniform Mary would wear when coming home from work. So, Chuck was a nurse as well it seemed.
Mary frowned worriedly about the situation, “then we need to call the police,” she said, “he’s an escape mental patient; he could hurt anyone, not just Castiel.”
Castiel just gave Sam a grim look as the boy nodded and went back to eating his food, almost looking disappointed at the fact that Castiel wasn’t mentally mute.
They were all sitting in Dean’s room again in beanbags. Castiel was reading Dean’s bunch of sign language books, Michael was trying to beat Dean’s high score on some video game that they’d found behind the TV, and Gabriel was looking through Dean’s CDs.
A body flew past Dean’s vision and slammed into Ashton, who stumbled into the lockers, almost looking like he’d caused a small dint in the flimsy metal, “how’s it feel to be slammed against the lockers Moseby?!”
He went straight to his locker and got out some of his textbooks after checking his timetable and realising he had math first up.
“How about you come over to mine tonight?” Dean asked, “You can stay over. I have plenty of room in my room for an extra bed.”
“Studying,” was all Dean said, looking back down at the book he was reading and trying to bend his fingers the right way to sign
Copious amounts of coffee were drunk that morning from the cafe that was close to the school building - except for Sam, who Dean had learned not to give coffee to the younger boy because the poor guy would start bouncing off of the walls. Out of all of them, however, Sam seemed the most energized so it wasn’t like he needed it.
Dean and Castiel turned around to see Michael and Gabriel making their way towards them. Dean beamed, “really? That’s how I get most people interested in me.”
“Have some pancakes!” Mary said, putting some more on the stack that was sitting in the middle of the table. Charlie instantly went and grabbed the top one, lathering syrup onto it, “sorry Cas,” she said, cheerfully, “I like them fresh out of the pan!”
“You know we won’t let him hurt you, right?” Dean asked Castiel, looking at him with still a tiny hint of concern.
Castiel felt his body go warm and he didn’t quite understand why his body was doing so, but he smiled anyway and nodded slowly. He just hoped that Dean wouldn’t get into trouble from his mother for not going to school the next day and deciding to stay home for him.
His old high school had not so much been a high school, but more of a place for mentally disturbed children to go to; the second closest thing to going to a mental institution and possibly seeing his brother again for the first time in five years. But he’d been declared normal, after he’d shown traits of being mentally disturbed by the situation that had occurred many years ago. So now, he had been enrolled in a normal high school.
Michael, he was protective and a little stiff when it came to humour, like their mother. But he still loved him.
“It’s about our mother,” Gabriel said. Dean always noticed that they never ever called her mom. They always said mother, coldly and without an inch of respect in their tones. He knew ‘mother’ was a snobby way to say mom, but neither of them were snobs.
Castiel smiled, he was happy Mary had someone. If there was someone who deserved to be happy, it was most definitely her. The woman had practically, in a way without even mentioning it, adopted him and his brothers without a moment’s hesitation. Apparently she had been the same with Charlie and Adam.
Besides, he was sure Lucifer was much stronger than him. Maybe not mentally but at least physically; he’d be able to pin him to his bed and slit his throat in two seconds, and if he was sober he’d have even more of a chance to get the job done. If he was drunk though, Castiel still wouldn’t have a chance in hell to save himself.
Castiel froze, he hadn’t thought of it like that. He could feel his palms break out into a sweat again and the hairs on the back of his neck standing up. Now that he thought about it, he had been feeling like he was being watched, no matter where he went, for a while now. That didn’t stop the sweat pouring from his palms.
There was a brief silence, where all Castiel heard was the beating of his own heart in his ears, it almost blocked out the next thing someone at the table said, “I guess this is what you get for naming your son Lucifer.”
“Shut your Aussie talk and pay attention,” Dean muttered, “Really? Do you want to do remedial English again?”
“You need to join the library before you can borrow those books,” she said, “with five dollars you can get your own card and an unlimited borrowing limit.”
“Well, then, avoid him,” Michael said, continuing to look down at Castiel who looked embarrassedly down at his feet, “look, you shouldn’t be at school.”
“What about her?” Dean asked for Castiel, who looked too exhausted to sign anything – or maybe he was just sick of everyone’s crap.
He hung up, without saying goodbye or I love you, which was quite normal for all of them. He sighed, “sorry lil’ bro,” Gabriel said with a small sigh, “looks like you’re chilling with me and Michael as well tonight.”
Sorry for the pretty small chapter. I will make up for it with hopefully what will be a decent sized chapter for the next chapter. But, despite its small size, I hope you enjoy it.
Castiel had made a habit of sleeping with the door open just in case Lucifer climbed in through the window and Castiel needed to make a quick escape. He’d lately considered even hiding his own knife underneath a pillow, just in case.
“To Kill a Mockingbird, again,” Dean muttered while walking back to his seat, “we read this last year...I swear, the guy isn’t even trying anymore.”
Sam and Dean went to school, not without complaint, and Michael and Gabriel spent the time attempting to help Mary any way they possibly could before she had to go to work.
He slowly got out of the bed, not wanting to leave the warmth of Dean’s arms – but he did it anyway, almost regretting it instantly as he felt his feet touch the soft carpet. He padded his way over to the door and into the hallway.
“No publicity is bad publicity,” Michael said, imitating a squeaky tone which Dean assumed was an imitation of their mother.
Castiel nodded, relieved for an excuse to not sit with the family for dinner that night. Dinner times had been tense, overly so, and it worried Castiel. He didn’t know whether it was because of what had happened at school, what his mother believed about him not going to school, or because of something else. But he sure wanted to find out. He didn’t really plan on going up to his room and studying; he planned on sitting at the top of the stairs and eavesdropping on the conversation. He needed to know what was going on and he knew that was the only way he was going to find out.
It would actually be really interesting to read what you guys think, or hope, would happen after all of this. If you could write that down, that would be a very interesting read! :)
He was sitting at lunch, next to Dean, trying hard not to turn his head and just stare at the boy as he ate, when Gabriel sat down and started signing at him.
Dean walked down the school halls, wondering if he looked like a lost puppy. He felt like one; the school felt empty despite the three hundred other students around him. Castiel wasn’t there, and therefore the school was empty and worthless and had lost all its meaning. Most days, it was the only reason he got up in the morning and forced himself into his car. Also because Sam needed an education – he wanted to go to college, become a Lawyer. As for Dean – he’d given up ages ago. He failed most of his school tests and felt like a deadbeat. He'd only found his enthusiasm for school coming back again once Castiel had started coming.
“Well...” his mother stood there awkwardly for a second, before shrugging her own shoulders, as if to mock him, “alrighty then,” she said, clapping her hands together awkwardly and placing them in front of her stomach before walking away, probably to make a phone call to some important person. Castiel didn’t know and he really didn’t care.
Charlie spoke a lot about comic books and how she wanted to apply for a job at a comic book store nearby. Adam called her a nerd, making Charlie roll her eyes at him, though you could tell it wasn’t said in a mean way; but a friendly teasing way. Sam spoke about some teacher who was a pain in the ass and how he couldn’t wait until he was finished in the fresh hell that school was, Dean laughed at him and remind him he still had a few more years to go.
Gabriel muttered something that sounded like ‘sweet’ and put it in his school bag to take home the next day.
Michael’s hands were shaking slightly and he stuttered as he spoke, “Lucifer called Castiel and threatened him,” Michael muttered, “which means he knows exactly where Castiel is...he was probably watching him the whole time.”
Castiel rolled his eyes as Gabriel turned around to change the song on the stereo. Some other weird pop punk band began playing through the speakers. Castiel couldn’t tell the difference between the sounds so he assumed it was music by the same band.
Having feelings for Dean Winchester and not being able to pursue them was hard. He didn’t want to bring Dean into this whole Lucifer mess; he didn’t want Dean to get hurt either physically, or emotionally. If he just stayed away, he wouldn’t have to hurt Dean at all.
Castiel climbed into bed next to him, instantly wrapping the covers around himself and burying himself close to Dean. It was a cold night, so Dean wrapped an arm around him and tried to get as close to Castiel as was humanly comfortable.
“She’s such a hardcore Christian freak,” he said, “even most Christian’s can see the fault in their religion through-out some aspects of History but she just makes it seem like everything is perfect and the way to be and that God can do no wrong,” Dean muttered, “Naomi Rice is probably the worst teacher I’ve ever had,
It startled him, remembering the details, but he felt it also put him at ease. He could remember what happened. He knew why he was in here, it wasn’t going to constantly be asking about what happened to him and nobody would be denying him the answers, like what happened in some of the movies he had watched with Dean.
Mary just shook her head and thanked them both for whatever they planned on doing and then went to work, saying she should be back by six o’clock and that Chuck might be coming over.
“I hope you have a good day honey,” she said in a sickly sweet voice, kissing him lightly on the cheek. She was wearing a white business suit, wearing a pearl necklace around her flawless neck and a gold and diamond ring. Her hair was in a professional looking bun and she had her most professional looking stilettos on.
Castiel headed towards what Dean supposed was Gabriel or Michael’s locker. He smirked slightly as the dark haired boy turned his back on him.
He heard the sounds of water and dishes being stacked stop from the kitchen. He even felt Dean stiffen beside him. The news reader looked grave, and he wondered if he actually cared, but Castiel doubted the man did.
“You okay Cas?” he asked on day over lunch. Gabriel was over in the middle of the cafeteria, wooing a couple of cheerleaders. Michael was with the chess club trying to form strategies for the upcoming chess tournament.
Castiel rushed over to the whiteboard and wrote his name down the bottom and whatever the note from his mother said. There were several more in his lunch bag, waiting to be used on his other teachers.
Everyone nodded quietly, refusing to argue. Mary seemed pleased with the response, smiled, and left the room without complaint. That’s when Dean walked over to him slowly and tentatively, before leaning down and kissing his lips softly, “I’m sorry I didn’t get to you sooner.”
Castiel pushed his feet over the edge of the couch. Everything felt fuzzy around him again, surreal. He wasn’t one to nap during the middle of the day, and the fact that he had fallen asleep in the morning and now it was night time felt weird to him. He slowly made his way to the kitchen, where he saw Dean standing there, talking to Adam.
When he was nine and his brother was sixteen, he was asked to cover for Lucifer as he went out with a few of his friends and got mindlessly drunk. Castiel had failed to keep their mother off his brother’s tracks and that night, while Lucifer had been drunk to the point where he shouldn’t have been able to walk, Lucifer slit his throat.
Castiel shrugged. He felt too lazy to bend down and get a note of paper from his bag and to get a pen out as well. He was shocked to find that Dean had one already ready.
While the discussion continued, Castiel’s head moved left and right, almost like he was watching a tennis match. He was so distracted; he poured lukewarm gravy into his lap as he tried to aim for his roast potatoes. He made a shrill squeaking noise, which made everyone stop. He dropped the gravy boat on the table, trying hard not to knock it over the kitchen table and covered his face embarrassment, unsure whether it was from shame of his squeaky noise or because of the mess he had made everywhere.
If Michael and Gabriel noticed how on edge Castiel was, they didn’t ask. But someone who did notice and ask was Dean.
A younger boy, maybe three years younger than Dean, walked towards them carrying a food tray. He gave Castiel a weird look and changed his course, sitting down next to Gabriel.
His mother hadn’t even shown interest in anyone that way. She was all work and no relationships. Though, Castiel was secretly happy for it. His mother would settle for nothing less than perfect, and if that were the case he was sure if he was to get a new step-father he would be a massive douche.
He slowly sat up in his bed, now three in the morning, petrified that a hand may reach out, grab him and pull him underneath the bed; he jumped into the middle of the room making sure to leave a decent bit of room between the floor near his bed, and himself. He made his way out into the hallway; he could hear music coming from Gabe’s room; he had insomnia and spent majority of the time awake listening to music and doing his assignments. Michael didn’t mind the music, he’d gotten used to it, and so had Castiel. His mother slept downstairs in the master bedroom- not able to hear it at all.
“We need to devise a plan, you realise?” Dean said, turning the game system off and turning towards Castiel and Gabriel, “what if Lucifer does come to the house and then breaks in and tries to hurt one of us?” he didn’t mention Castiel’s name but everyone knew he was thinking it.
Sam was sitting in the lounge room now, looking calm although heavily amused, “I don’t think I’m comfortable leaving you alone in the house – next time we come back we might not have a house.”
In the morning Castiel felt nothing but dread. Dean was still asleep next to him so he shook him roughly awake. He muttered something about wanting another five minutes, and turned over, his naked back turned towards him and his face turned away to the other side of the room. Castiel sighed and dragged himself out of the bed, picking up a spare shirt from the floor, hoping it was his, and replacing a pair of pyjama pants with a pair of jeans.
Castiel glared at his brother, his face heating up and he was sure it was slowly turning red. He glared down at his food, surprised it didn’t end up on fire.
That maybe they’d all returned home to get some clothing and Lucifer had held them up there, which he felt they wouldn’t be too smart to do but he didn’t know.
He spent a lot of time at Dean’s house and when they weren’t talking, or helping out Dean’s mom, or watching TV, listening to music, playing video games, whatever. They were kissing; and it didn’t matter who was there to witness it. His brother’s had complained many times about the openness of the two when it came to publicly displaying their affections, but Castiel was sure secretly that Michael and Gabriel were just happy that he had found someone to be like that with.
Dean came down into the kitchen not long after, taking a pancake off of the middle plate and smothering it with jam before stuffing at least half of it into his mouth. Mary turned around at just the right time to catch him doing so and looked at him with dismay.
“Alright, deal,” Gabriel said, “I’ll go with him tonight with Michael and we’ll all stay there. You’re right; it will be a bonding activity.”
Mary shrugged, standing up from sitting on the edge of the bed and making her way out of the room, almost with a sadistic smirk on her face that only a mom would be able to wear without seeming like an evil bitch, “you’re the ones stayed up until one in the morning, you deal with it.”
Something that Castiel didn’t know about Dean was that Dean had his own car. It had come as a shock when they had walked out of the school building, and instead of heading towards the bus stop, Dean had taken him into the car park and towards an old Chevrolet Impala 67’, the black beauty shining brightly in the sunlight.
Castiel made a small noise in his throat, making Dean repeat the question. He got out his timetable and pointed at the first class up there.
Gabriel turned to look at Castiel who was sitting on the couch, staring at the TV and watching the news.
Lucifer was sent somewhere, Castiel never knew, but after doing research at school he was sure his brother was either in jail or in a mental asylum. It had broken Castiel’s heart, seeing in pictures where his brother could possibly be; but he knew it was for his own safety.
Dean shrugged, “it honestly isn’t anything flashy,” he muttered, “you can’t actually leave the hospital in your condition, but...” he flashed a smile, “you’ll see, okay?”
He heard another groan and turned around to see Dean slowly getting out of bed, “I hate school days,” he said, “not just Mondays, just school days in general – especially when you have a psychopath running around the place.”
Dean sighed and turned to look at Castiel with a sombre look, “I punched Ashton in the face after what he did to you. I broke his nose. I was in the principal’s office at recess and they were deciding what to do with me.”
Dean’s face was red, but he sat down, his tray of food sitting in front of him. There was an empty seat next to Dean, which he tapped lightly, indicating that Castiel should sit there. He nodded and sat down hurriedly. His brother was in front of him, smiling, “so, how’s the first day been so far?” he asked.
James shook his head, sighed and went back to looking at the board. He looked at Castiel from the corner of his eye, who was signing to Dean to see if he understood sign language at all. Dean shook his head, saying he didn’t know sign language and James continued to look at him weirdly until he completely turned towards him, “are you deaf?” he asked.
Dean pushed past two of the football players and a boy from his and Castiel’s math class before pushing aside Ashton and grabbing Castiel, making Aston fall to the ground and hit his head on the metal frame of the bubbler and Castiel stand behind him, Dean adopted a protective stance as he watched Ashton slowly get up from the floor, looking pissed.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, slowly pulling away, “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable, I’m probably-.”
Castiel tried to make an ‘mmm’ sound, but it sounded croaky and distorted. But Dean seemed to get the point anyway.
Michael was standing in the lounge room looking a little amused, “they were cooking microwave popcorn and they burnt it.”
When it was lunch time, Gabriel went over to sit with the jocks, who he seemed to be great friends with despite never playing sport with them. Michael went over to the lab geeks to discuss the science fair; Sam was sitting with a bunch of boys who were supposedly in his English class...which left Castiel with Dean.
“Tell who what honey?” his mother asked in that fake sickly sweet voice of hers. It was like she was afraid she was constantly being watched by cameras, that if she dropped her facade for one moment, the whole world would know how she used her children as trophies and didn’t actually love them like a decent mother would.
Castiel wasn’t even sure he was mad anymore. He got up slowly, pulling Dean up with him as he turned his wrists and tightened his grip around Dean’s hand.
His mother held his lunch in a paper brown bag, rolled up at the top. Castiel tried to resist the urge to roll his eyes. His mother had never done this for him, the mental schools food in the cafeteria had been free, after some kid freaked out about the milkshakes being five dollars after the kid had only three dollars to spend.
“Mom, it’s me, Gabriel,” he said, “if you actually bothered to check the caller I.D you would know that,” he said, rolling his eyes at Castiel who smiled.
He made a small little groaning sound, the most human sound he’d made in a while, and he heard a voice call his name which slowly became clearer every time his name was repeated.
Dean simply nodded and said, “No problem,” as he watched Michael turn around and head towards his car, where Castiel was already standing against the passenger side door, waiting to be taken home.
It was during the middle of class that Castiel really needed to pee. He’d drunk too many cups of coffee and while they had helped him stay awake, they had also had a major effect on his bladder.  He was quick to ask to go to the bathroom, getting another student to get the teachers attention and he signed a simple ‘T’ with his hands. The teacher was obviously able to see his discomfort, and let him go without argument.
“We need to talk to Castiel,” Michael said instantly, he turned toward the couch to see Castiel, who had looked amused at Sam and Dean’s petty argument before, but was now looking startled, like a deer caught in headlights. Michael felt a moment of pity for the boy, but knew this was important.
He grabbed out a notepad and pen, and began to write, sitting on the edge of the boy’s bed without his permission. He felt it would tell Dean just how serious he thought the situation was.
He wished someone at his new high school would have a massive freak out about the price of food. Then he wouldn’t have to deal with the crappy sandwiches his mother made.
The door swung open and Gabriel smiled at him, “hey little bro,” he said, “what are you doing awake so early?”
Castiel’s mouth was agape, and he almost felt the urge to cry. Dean’s mom had learned to sign before his own mother was even willing to. Mary smiled at him softly, “we’re learning at the hospital how to sign, so we can talk to deaf patients.”
“My name is Dean Winchester,” he said, holding out his hand for Castiel to shake. Castiel shook it, remembering what his mother said about how unappealing floppy fish handshakes are.
“Are you okay?” she asked slowly. Castiel nodded, “good,” she said, “So, you two can explain to me why you’re in here Castiel,” he said, looking between Castiel and Dean.
“She’s pathetic,” Dean said, “She can’t take another person’s opinion simply because she can’t defend her own,” they walked into the library, none of the other students appeared to be there, though, Castiel wasn’t fazed. They sat down at a table in the corner, surrounded by fiction novels. Castiel looked around at them all, seeing if any of them caught his eye.
Dean simply shrugged and continued to chew on the pancake hungrily, amusement dancing in his eyes as he looked down at Castiel, who was admittedly quite amused. He would never have gotten away with something like that in his house; his mother hated it when he accidentally spilled something on himself, even the tiniest drop of sauce – or even something like a pea that didn’t stain his clothing permanently. She was fussy. Mary was also fussy but you weren’t like to get punished for eating like a wild animal.
“Have you got any friends here?” Dean asked, “or are you new to the school as well; I don’t believe I’ve seen you around before.”
At that point, Sam was wearing an empty bowl on his head and Gabriel was drumming it along to the beat of the movie - which was probably a really weird scene to walk in on now that he thought about it.
“Are you okay?” he asked. Castiel shrugged, it was a stupid question. Did he really look okay? But he knew Dean was trying his hardest. He tried to stand up from his seat on the couch but stumbled and almost fell into the TV.
He was slowly helped up the stairs and he couldn’t help but feel a little pathetic. After spilling gravy it seemed to have rendered him unable to do anything. But despite the embarrassment, he didn’t make any move to stop Dean from dragging him around.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Charlie’s in the kitchen cooking dinner tonight and Adam is in the lounge room with Sam.”
“Castiel, go to bed sweetheart,” his mother said suddenly, turning towards him and pointing up the stairs, “now.”
He looked up at Dean; he wanted to feel angry that Dean hadn’t gotten the guts to tell him. But he couldn’t feel mad at Dean. His brother’s had probably told Dean not to tell him.
“Third,” Dean answered, “he’s trying to recruit me onto the school’s football team and he thinks if he keeps giving me As for doing shit all, I’ll agree to being on the team.”
It was a week before Michael allowed Castiel to go back to school. Though, Castiel had wanted to return the day after the incident and thank Dean for basically saving him, Michael had said no. He had spent days on the couch at home, while his mother was at work and his two brothers were at school. He had been so bored.
He pushed the note over to Dean, who read it with a confused look, “what night?” he asked, though his cheeks had turned a little red.
Dean ignored him, standing up quickly and rushing over to open the door. He stepped back hastily as Michael and Gabriel practically flew in, topping over a few photo frames as Gabriel clumsily banged into the wall – luckily none of the glass broke.
Dean looked rather speechless, “well...that sucks...” he bit his lip, “my mom likes you guys, and she adopted Charlie and Adam so...”
“I’ve decided to carry around a piece of spare paper and a pen around at all times,” Dean said, “just in case.”
He heard the muffled exclamation from the door and turned to look out the small rectangular window. Mary Winchester was standing there, looking behind her as if talking to someone else. She opened the door, and people poured inside. It took him a while to notice the faces of Dean, Sam, Michael and Gabriel.
He felt his palms sweating slightly against the vinyl of the steering wheel, he told himself to breathe and not to panic – surely they were fine.
Miss Rice lost her patience. She stormed towards Dean and grabbed the back of his leather jacket and dragged him out of the classroom, Dean looked startled to say the least as he was pushed out the door with the door slammed in his face. The teacher smirked out the glass window that was in the door and about half the size of it, “also Mr Winchester,” she said, seeming to have calmed down as soon as she had pushed Dean out of the class, “you’re once again not in uniform!”
“Hey!” Dean exclaimed, putting down his knife and fork, “I’m helpful! I’m the comedian of the family; I keep things happy.”
“You know,” Dean said, they were in the middle of their math class and the teacher was up the front writing algebraic equations on the board, but the teacher wasn’t really strict when it came to talking in the class room, “I used to think Michael had a crush on me.”
“What would you do if he suddenly turned up?” Dean asked, “I know you probably don’t want me to ask such things, but you need a plan.”
Mary opened the white front door wider for him, so he could pass and come into the main entrance. He’d always loved walking through it, all the family photos of her, Dean and Sam, eventually progressing to Mary, Adam, Sam and Dean and then last but not least, a bunch of photos of Mary, Charlie, Adam, Dean and Sam altogether. It warmed his heart; the only photos Gabriel, Michael and his mother had around the house was her getting publishing awards in ceremonies, her first time on Oprah, Ellen and Jimmy Fallon – you name it. But nothing of the three of them. She was only a celebrity, not a mother.
“You’ll be fine,” Dean said confidently, but Castiel could see the doubt in the other boy’s eyes. He could read Dean like a book, one that he had already read several hundred times.
Castiel shook his head politely and decided to have his pancake plain. Sam simply shrugged but didn’t move the plate back towards him.
Dean drove them all back to the Winchester household, and he knew everyone was thinking the same thing – thank God nothing had happened today. That maybe Lucifer wasn’t even around. Maybe, just maybe, they were going to be okay.
He felt a nudge against his shoulder and he looked beside him. Charlie had gone and Dean had taken his place, looking at him with a concerned look, “are you okay, Cas?” he asked, he had another pancake in front of him, this time on a plate, but he hadn’t touched it yet, instead he was watching Castiel with worry.
“Are you kidding?” Dean asked, standing up and looking at the teacher incredulously, “the whole game of heaven and hell is practically a golf metaphor,” he said, “the one with the least amount of sins wins and they go to heaven while the other goes to hell and gets mocked by the rest of the players that have lost the game.”
