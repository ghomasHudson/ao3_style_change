John to believe him. He dares a look at John, and is relieved to see John looking at him openly, steadily.
“John, I –”  His blood is still pumping through his veins, and his cock is throbbing, though not as insistently as it had been just a moment ago.  “I want –“
John knows the answer to the question with a burning certainty that takes him by surprise. His lip twists, but he holds it firm. He shakes his head, hand still over his eyes.
“You’re welcome,” Uncle Augustus says brightly, heedless of Mycroft’s tone, and he winks at Sherlock, which makes Sherlock giggle. He hugs his nutcracker tightly to his chest, and when Uncle Augustus turns to greet Gran, Sherlock wanders away with his nutcracker, eager to examine it up close. He can’t say what it is that catches his attention, but there’s something about it that seems special. It’s not like some of the gifts Uncle Augustus has given him in the past; it’s not a clock with animated figures on its face, and neither is it anything particularly innovative, but there’s something about its understated strength and beauty that Sherlock likes. He sits on the couch by the Christmas tree and examines it, swinging his legs as he holds the nutcracker this way and that, wondering what kind of soldier it is, realizing he doesn’t know enough about the army and he should do some research.
Anderson twists at the ring for a moment, frowning at how tarnished it’s become, and John watches with horror from the other side of the road.
John nods, his shoulders stiff, wondering what exactly lies ahead of him. They reach the edge of the forest, and he stares, a chill already settling over him as his eyes sweep over the dark cluster of dying trees ahead of him.
The man is silent for a moment, thinking. “I don’t really have one,” he finally says. He frowns as John comes out of the kitchen with a tea tray. John sets a cup on the table beside the customer and hands the other to Sherlock, then heads back to the kitchen, eager to watch the proceedings with Mrs. Hudson and Billy.
“But he didn’t, did he? People lie, John. Sometimes they lie so much it takes over their lives. It’s their own choice, and there’s nothing you or I can do to stop it. They have to decide not to lie, the same way they decide
Ahead of them is a strange misty area, a mixture of black and green in the bleak greyness that surrounds them.  It looks almost like the fog rising off a pond.  The smell is coming from there, and John feels cold creeping over his body.  The girl looks up at him, beaming.  “That way!” she says.  She runs forward and tugs on his hand.  He stumbles after her for a moment, but stops, pulling her back.
John’s not sure why he’s nervous; he’s a grown man, after all.  And yet, he finds himself clearing his throat and nervously adjusting his shirt collar with his left hand while his right tightens on the handles of the small gift bag he holds.  He takes a deep breath, then lets it out in a whoosh and reaches out to ring Mary’s doorbell.
John flushes. “Yes,” he says. It’s much different, he thinks, to talk about this now while they’re both safe and out of harm’s way than it is to say in the heat of the moment while he’s terrified of losing Sherlock forever, even if the sentiment remains the same.
“I want to fix your leg,” Sherlock says after a moment, and he does, really, but something about the way John’s looking at him, something about seeing John in this room, about the way the twinkling lights flicker over his features, the way John strokes the little birds, something about it all makes him not want to move, makes him want to stay there longer.
John can’t help the huff of laughter that escapes him. For as intense as he’d been the day before, Sherlock is equally as pathetic today.
“Shut up, Mycroft,” Sherlock says, his moment of pleasure gone as quickly as it came. He pushes Mycroft’s hand off his shoulder and ineffectually shoves at his hip.
it when John’s concerned, and he knows John will be more concerned if he looks away – but he hates it, hates every second that John sees him like this, hates the way fear is crawling over his skin, hates the way he feels naked and exposed.
Mycroft smiles, but it seems a bit more genuine this time.  “You’d be willing to forfeit your payment for him?”
John frowns. He wants to ask Sherlock more, but he doesn’t want to have that conversation here, where everything is so idyllic and magical, and so he leaves it for the moment. “So, the water you made – you meant that it was connected to this pond?”
, something with Mary, judging by the late hour, and something which has John’s footsteps slowing to approximately one-third of their usual pace.
“I think he’s angry,” Billy says to Mrs. Hudson, who is emerging from the kitchen with a cup of tea, presumably for Sherlock.
Mary twists her hands into the fabric of her trousers and takes a deep, shuddering breath. “You really are an idiot, John. Have a little self preservation,” she tells him. She stands and turns to leave, and when she turns her back to him, John notices bandages peeking out the top of her shirt.
“John,” Sherlock says. His voice is crackly again, but there’s a sense of urgency to his tone that makes John listen carefully. “I told you to be careful. Stop seeing that man.”
“Brilliant,” John murmurs, low and tender. “You’re always so brilliant, love, that’s it, you’re alright, now.” The words are nonsense, but they curl into Sherlock’s ear like bliss and he unwraps one arm from around his leg, curls it around John’s and presses closer, turns his head just a little bit, nuzzles the length of his nose against John’s trousers. He doesn’t feel like he has control over his actions; he feels as if he is floating on a cloud, as if the only thing that’s real is John’s voice and John’s fingers and John’s leg.
Outside, it’s another drizzly day, unremarkable in any way, and yet inside the flat, 221B is brimming with promise once more, filled with warmth that makes his pulse quicken and his stomach flutter if he allows himself to focus on it for too long, and with pleasure, he focuses as long as he likes and relishes the feeling.
Sherlock reaches for him and pulls his head down for a kiss, startling John at first, but John melts into it easily, opening his mouth, their tongues sloppily pressing together, and then John shifts his hips, settling deeper into Sherlock.
“Well, apparently, neither of us are most wizards, then,” John says, not as heated as before, but still eyeing Sherlock in a way that makes him feel as if he’s under a microscope, which is a strange turn of events for him. “Anyway, which was it, then? Beauxbatons? Durmstrang?”
“I waited for you for so long,” Sherlock tells him again. His voice is hushed and intimate and it cracks on the end of his words.
Sherlock lets out a shuddering breath and brings his arms around John, his hands fisting into John’s shirt. John tilts his head up and presses it into Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock presses his cheek against the side of John’s head. He’s shaking against John, and John pulls him closer.
“You’re much stronger now than you were before,” she says.   “So you might make it through the forest.” She smiles at him as if that’s reassuring, and John feels fear coiling in his stomach. Sherlock believes in him, though, and so John forces the fear down, pushing it aside. He doesn’t have time to be afraid; he needs to focus.
She steps forward and leans down in front of him. She covers his hand with hers. “If you want to find him, you need to relax,” she tells him. “There’s something only you can do, but you haven’t yet realized what it is. Drink some tea, and think about why you want to find him.”
, Mummy; he doesn’t need a rest,” Sherlock says petulantly, but when Mummy steers him over to the tree, he puts him down tenderly, and strokes his broken arm. Mummy and Mycroft have left him alone now, so he leans close and whispers, “Don’t worry, we’ll fix you up soon.”
“You always were a good boy,” Sherlock says fondly, reaching up and carefully patting the top of Redbeard’s head with one fingertip, which is about the same size as the head it’s patting.
John looks up from the paper and takes in Sherlock’s attire, his brow furrowed and his mouth slightly open.  “Archery?” he asks.  “You – of course you have an archery tournament.  Archery.”
“They took you away from me. I told them – I told them about what happened, and they thought I was crazy – they – they still do,
“You don’t – you don’t have to,” John says. “It was silly. Just, talking about the wedding, and the wine –”
John is surprised by Sherlock’s thoughtfulness, but before he can comment on it, Sherlock continues.
“You’re home early,” Sherlock suddenly murmurs, not moving from where he sits, keeping his eyes closed.
crowding his mind, thoughts he doesn't like to examine, and he’d only meant to lie down for a moment, to rest, to try to turn off the world for a while, but now he is suddenly aware of the sounds of John in the apartment. He feels a strange sense of shame wash over him because he hadn’t even heard him come up the stairs, and he hadn’t meant for John to find him like this; he’d only meant to rest, but he’d gotten stuck inside his own head and he’d lost track of time and suddenly he’s aware of John’s footsteps in the flat, of John hanging up his coat, of John stepping into the sitting room and stopping awkwardly, and he feels exposed in a strange way he doesn’t understand. He never used to feel this way if John found him like this, but everything is different now, in ways he can’t fathom.
She adjusts her dress when she stands, twisting it at the waist a bit, letting the luxurious crimson fabric shift and resettle. “How do I look?” she asks Sherlock, holding her arms out to the side
“Care to elaborate?” John asks, annoyed, going to lean against the doorway to the living room so he can see Sherlock.
“Move, John,” Sherlock says. His eyes are trained on Arthur, and his voice books no room for argument. There is an aura of power around him that John usually loves to see, but this time is different.
John laughs, and Sherlock can’t help but let a corner of his lip twitch upwards in response, despite the agitation that’s still curling in his stomach, but not quite as much as before.
The side of John’s mouth quirks into a grin for just a moment, then settles again into something very much opposite. “There was a late term miscarriage. It’s fine. It just – it brought up a lot. But it’s.” He stops, clears his throat, waves his hand through the air and gestures to 221B, his eyes anywhere but on Sherlock. “Made me think how nice it is to be back.”
Sherlock smiles at Mary, a smile John doesn’t really like. It’s tight and insincere. Nonetheless, Sherlock extends his right hand and Mary takes it.
“Yes, you can. Come sit,” John says again, gesturing towards the chair. Sherlock gives him a dirty look, and John sighs. “A patient had exploding snaps that malfunctioned and exploded in her face, quite horribly, and she brought them with her, and they exploded in
John shifts in the embrace until he can tug Sherlock’s head down for a kiss.  It starts as just a peck, as a press of lips together in reassurance, and then John moves his mouth a bit against Sherlock’s, lets his lips part, lets his tongue dart out, and then they’re kissing and it’s long and luxurious and Sherlock feels as if his heart is splitting open inside his chest.
“I must not have been a good teacher, then,” Sherlock says distractedly, eyes flickering over his sparse music library.
And it’s true; since he’d gotten him the week before, Redbeard has scarcely left John’s collar or wrist. At first, it was strange and a bit annoying, but John’s growing accustomed to it now (though he’s hesitant to admit it).
He remembers the first time he came to 221B, the way Sherlock lounged on the couch, smoking his stupid pipe, drawing him in with his strange words. He remembers it so clearly he can almost smell the smoke, and he inhales deeply through his nose, imagining the scent. He remembers walking towards Sherlock, holding his dog tags out, remembers the metallic sound as he dropped the chain and tag in Sherlock’s hand, remembers how he made the mistake of thinking Sherlock didn’t care about people.
John feels fear churning in his stomach, fear he can’t welcome. Terror wells inside of him and he realizes that Moriarty may be telling the truth. There had been no door, had there? He’d come through the lake. Does that count as a connection to Sherlock’s closet?
“Did she now?” Sherlock asks. He raises one eyebrow, and John can’t read the expression on his face. “That sounds…
The kettle whistles, and John pours their tea, bringing a cup to Sherlock, who miraculously revives to sit up and take it, sipping cautiously and then sighing, shoulders relaxing as he leans back into the couch.
Her voice is soothing, and he swallows nervously, his throat dry. “I – is this – what is this?” he asks. “Where are we?”
“If that’s what you believe, then maybe that’s the case,” Sherlock says with a shrug. “The world isn’t some infinite being that has existed forever and will exist forever. It’s not black and white, John. It’s what you make it.”
“You know, you don’t seem like the type to enter a competition,” John remarks later, from where he sits beside Sherlock in the taxi headed for the athletic center.
“We just talked a bit, really,” John continues. “He told me you used to chase Mycroft around when you were little and Mycroft made it rain on you.” He grins a little, wishing he could see a picture of Sherlock at that age.
Mary doesn’t reply for a moment. She looks down and twists the bracelet on her wrist, and the bags under her eyes seem exaggerated, somehow. “I’ve been this way since I was a child,” she tells him. “My parents took me to priests and exorcists and psychics, but there’s nothing anyone can do; it’s just how I am.”
, what you’ve done -” John says, but he stops, and Sherlock opens his eyes. John’s eyes are right there, blurry as they are through the tears that won’t seem to stop, and they’re staring into his own. “Thank you,” John murmurs. “Thank you so much. You’ve saved me so many times.”
“I’ll take you,” she says. “But I can’t go all the way to his house. I’ll give you directions when I have to turn back.”
Sherlock stands next to John with a small half smile on his face. “It’s nothing to do with you, Billy,” he says. “I think he just wants to stay with John,” he adds, watching as Redbeard’s head pops out of John’s collar from the inside, much to John’s chagrin. Redbeard squeaks in agreement, and Sherlock reaches out and rubs the top of his little head, resulting in more squeaks from Redbeard and a shiver from John when Redbeard’s tail rubs back and forth across the base of his neck.
The woman looks up at him and clutches the cupcake.  Her eyes are wide, and she seems to be on the verge of tears again.
“Right,” John says, watching the strange instrument. The pendulum has begun to move, though neither of them are doing anything to push it, and it’s creating swirls in the basin of sand. They don’t make sense to John, not yet.
“He,” John confirms. “I met him outside the flat, actually. He’s old – around ninety. He fought in World War II, and he hasn't got any family left.”
Mary blinks, looking down at her tea for a moment. She hesitates, and then looks back up, searching Sherlock’s eyes. “There’s really nothing you can-”
“You’re so good,” John tells him again, and Sherlock feels as if he’s melting, as if there’s fire flowing through his veins, as if he is a puddle of molten flesh held up by nothing but John’s leg and John’s fingers in his hair. His breath hitches and he leans into John’s hand, moans startlingly loud when John pulls on his hair again, a little harder. He feels disconnected from his body, feels like a bundle of nerves waiting to go off whenever John chooses, and he loves it.
Sherlock eyes him for a moment, notices the sincerity in the slant of his eyebrows and the slight tilt of his head. “It was,” he admits after a moment, eyes drifting to the side and hand tightening on his teacup. “If I’m honest, I don’t have a lot of good memories of my childhood.”
Sherlock looks up at him, hesitant, and John crawls onto the bed, keeping his eyes locked with Sherlock’s as he straddles him, shifting forward until their faces are just inches apart and propping himself up on his arms, planted on either side of Sherlock. Sherlock reaches up and cups John’s head with one hand, the other still propping himself up, and John carefully settles his weight on Sherlock’s hips, stretching his legs out, pressing them against Sherlock’s and relaxing when Sherlock doesn’t seem bothered by his weight. “Alright?” John murmurs, eyes flickering back and forth between Sherlock’s.
The spell of the morning hasn’t worn off; they’re both warm, pliant, hazy, sleepy.  But arousal and desire sing sharp in Sherlock’s veins, and he swallows, looking up at John and curling his arms around John’s back, letting his legs spread wider.  “You,” he says, voice earnest and rough.  “I want you.”  He pauses, thinks of staring at an empty chair for so long, thinks of staring at an empty space where a chair once was, thinks of a mustache that should never have been, of loneliness so all-encompassing he needed vices he hadn’t turned to in years just to make sense of it.  “Please,” he adds, letting his fingers drift up and down John’s spine, eager to feel his skin, to be sure he’s there.
this; he doesn’t like feeling like he’s fighting to make a sound, feeling like he has to focus on how to play the instrument rather than what he wants to express. He loosens his bow and has to force his hands to put it gently back in the case rather than throw it, and does the same with his violin, closing the case with more force than necessary and tucking it away, not giving it a second glance before he goes back to his computer with a huff.
“Alright, dear,” she says.  She pats his arm consolingly, and it only makes him tense.  He doesn’t need consoling; he needs action, but he feels uncomfortably lost and unsure of what to do.  “Do you want a cuppa first?”
Sherlock closes his eyes and holds the paper directly in front of him. Then, he begins to murmur something John can’t understand. He doesn’t think it’s English, but he can’t be sure. Sherlock lets go of the paper, but it doesn’t move, and stays floating in midair. Sherlock’s hands make a complicated, vaguely circular movement around it, and then suddenly, he stretches his arms out straight in front of him, flicks his wrists quickly until his hands make a ‘stop,’ gesture, and the paper flings itself forward to slam into John’s forehead.
John shifts up to his toes again and kisses Sherlock once more. Sherlock closes his eyes, feels the sweet, chaste press of John’s lips against his, feels something in his heart melt and shift and rearrange, feels goosebumps wash over his skin, feels his hands smooth out over John’s back and pull him close, feels John shift back down to his feet as he breaks the kiss. Sherlock curls his arms around John’s back and holds him close, craning his neck down to bury his head beside John’s in favor of kissing him. He’s not sure he’s allowed to do this, but he can’t
“Is your room alright?” John asks, his fingers woven into Sherlock’s hair, his face just inches away.
“No, too busy,” Sherlock says, slamming the door behind him. John sighs as he listens to Sherlock bound down the stairs, wondering where exactly he’ll be going later that evening. With a grimace, he stands, going to the kitchen to search for something in the fridge besides the head so he can at least eat before he goes to who-knows-where with Sherlock.
Sherlock frowns, thinking about it. He thinks Mummy and Daddy might miss him and get sad. His shoulders fall.   “But –”
Sherlock manages a smile. Somehow, the things he cannot say aren’t fighting with him any more; they’ve calmed, quieted, retreated. He’s said them, he thinks, and he feels tired. He leans forward and rests his head against John’s neck, and John’s hands shift to his neck and his back, holding him close. It’s without fear that Sherlock lets his arms encircle John’s waist, and he inhales, closing his eyes, his mind feeling clearer than it has in ages.
John’s expression closes off and his shoulders drop as he lets out a weary sigh. He runs a hand over his face and keeps it there, just for a moment, and Sherlock feels his heart clench, his fingers itching to do something and not knowing what.
“No surprise there,” John says. “What about Stonehenge, though?” He gestures towards the television. “What do you think?”
“Fuck, Sherlock, that’s so good,” John says, moaning again when Sherlock’s hand starts to move faster.  “I’m so close already, that’s it, just a little more, yeah, faster - ”
“I think I’ll manage,” John says, and he must be imagining the way the skull somehow looks disappointed.
John is staring at the little fox, his heart pounding, and he feels immeasurable gratitude and love swirl in his chest. He leans down on shaky legs, his fingers still tangled with Sherlock’s around the handle of the lantern, and reaches out with his free hand to clasp the little fox’s shoulder. “Thank you,” he says, his voice thicker than he’d expected. “Thank you so, so much.”
“Get the glasses down?” John asks, looking up at him with an easy smile as he puts the corkscrew into a bottle of wine.
John just stares at him for a moment, his left hand flexing and unflexing a few times, before he nods. “Right. Yeah.”
horrible. The only reason you lasted as long as you did is because Sherlock found ways to protect you.”
John steps closer, though, and pulls him into a hug, Sherlock’s face pressed into John’s stomach. John rubs his arms up and down Sherlock’s back over the blankets, spreading warmth over him, and Sherlock pulls his arms out of the blankets to wrap them around John. His heartbeat is picking up, but his headache’s starting to go away, and he’s starting to feel warm.
They’re both in the sitting room one morning, John reading the newspaper and Sherlock sorting through some scrolls, when there’s a tapping on the front window. Sherlock recognizes the owl immediately, of course, and goes to let him in.
He goes downstairs and Mrs. Hudson is in the foyer, wringing her hands. “John, dear, you should really stay in,” she tells him.
Sherlock takes his eyes away from the woman to look at John.  He takes in the details of John’s posture and face for a moment, and then raises an eyebrow.  “Interesting,” he says.
Sherlock scoffs. “That’s nonsense. You’d need much more data to determine that sort of thing. Exact time of birth, planetary positions…it’s why I’d never be a fortuneteller. There’s no room in my mind for that.”
“Anytime, mate! I may miss drinking, but I certainly don’t miss the hangovers,” he continues. “You two look right miserable.”
“That’s why,” Sherlock repeats. “Having said that, I’ll be keeping these,” he says, shaking the dog tags and smiling at John.
“Come sit down with me,” John murmurs. His voice is soft, soothing, but there is an unfamiliar tremor to it. Sherlock shakes his head against John’s neck; he’s not sure he can move now that he’s given in; he won’t be able to bear it if he’s read this wrong, if John is just being kind, if John doesn’t –
John doesn’t say anything; he’s not sure he can. He shakily walks toward the stairs, grasping the railing for support. His bones feel like they’re breaking with every step, and his neck is burning. Mrs. Hudson follows closely behind him.
“Do you want me to keep her address?” Sherlock asks a moment later. “Do you want to choose her? Because make no mistake about this, John. If you keep her address and you contact her, you
“It would be much worse if I didn’t talk back,” the skull offers, and John has to admit, it has a point, but he’s not sure he’s okay about acknowledging that, so he silently trudges up the stairs.
“Typical dirty sales tactics, don’t you think?” John whispers. Billy and Mrs. Hudson stifle a laugh and Mrs. Hudson swats him on the shoulder.
“Oh, sorry mate, the light’s gonna change, gotta run,” the other man says suddenly, waving at Anderson and jogging off in the opposite direction.
Mycroft comes to Baker Street with an unusual job for Sherlock and John, and John learns a bit more about what exactly Sherlock is and what kind of magic he can do.
,” Sherlock says impatiently. John grins and ducks his head, then undoes Sherlock’s belt, thumbs open the button, and carefully eases down the zip. Sherlock’s breathing starts coming faster and when John’s finger carefully and lightly runs down the length of him, separated only by the thin fabric of his pants, his eyes fall closed and he feels like he can’t even stand up. “Oh,” he breathes. His stomach is quivering and John is breathing even heavier now.
Sherlock stares at Moriarty for a moment, disgust on his face, and then he turns to John, his eyes roving over John’s face even in his weakness. “Moriarty grants wishes,” Sherlock says. “But he’s different than I am. My magic is bound by the structure of wishes, but he’s broken that structure and calls what he does wish granting when it’s not. He doesn’t understand the importance of a balanced payment for a wish. He always takes too much, and it’s taken its toll on him. He’s insane, John, just go
“I didn’t think I’d ever see him again,” Sherlock says, not taking his eyes away from the little pipe fox. “I’m surprised Mycroft used him as payment; I would’ve thought he’d want to keep him from me for the rest of my life just to be spiteful.”
John smiles and stands, and Sherlock follows. Sherlock picks up the urn, and John, with no shoulder injury to hold him back, picks up the empty bottle the water had once been in.
Sherlock shakes his head, stepping into the sitting room. “It’s fine,” he says. He thinks of watching John and Mary dance while he played his violin, of shooting Magnussen in the head, of seeing John’s face afterward, of leaving for a suicide mission. “You’d be surprised to know that I do, in fact, have some compassion,” he says. He tries to keep his voice light, but it doesn’t work.
A few days later, John enters 221B warily. He’s just had a shift at the clinic, and things with Mary have been going well. Even so, the thought of Sherlock telling him he has a terrible face is daunting.
“I’m glad he gave him back,” John says. “Was he just living in that pipe in the meantime?” he asks, frowning at the thought.
Sherlock closes his eyes and looks upward for a moment, rooting through his mind palace for some hint of what to do next, but it’s showing him things he’s not sure he
“Many things,” Sherlock replies. “In this case, exactly how strong is your gateway to the spirits? Exactly how hard will you work?”
Sherlock takes a breath. It’s shaky and thin, higher than usual. “I’m sorry,” he says. His voice is breaking, and John can’t stand it. He doesn’t understand what’s happening. He has the distinct idea Sherlock is coming apart in his hands and he doesn’t
He looks down at her. She’s staring up at him as she drinks and he smiles. She breaks away from the bottle for a moment and gasps for breath, coughing a bit and looking confused as to why she had to stop.
John frowns.  “Right.  Thanks.  Bye, Molly,” he says.  He hangs up and replaces Sherlock’s phone in his pocket.  “She says I have to go to Baker Street,” he tells Mycroft and Billy.
“Sorry – what?” John asks, remembering how vehement Sherlock had been that John had to do this job, that he would never be in Mycroft’s debt.
“It means exactly what it says,” Sherlock murmurs, looking up at the sky. “Nothing more, nothing less.”
“I love you,” Sherlock finally manages, voice soft, low, his words disappearing into the safety of John’s skin.  “I always have.  I always will.”
– he had turned and met John’s eyes.  He had seen disbelief there mixed with fear and shock, and there was
He registers the sound of Billy shouting for him in the background, so he glances once between Sherlock and Billy, then quickly stands up and runs over to grab Billy and bring him back.  It takes only a few seconds, but it feels like eternity, leaving Sherlock alone and vulnerable.
Sherlock smiles.  “I do typically have rare interests,” he says.  “And there’s more to archery than meets the eye.”
John blinks, unsure of Sherlock’s tone, unsure of the small smile on his face. “I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or an insult,” he admits, his own voice softer, his eyes locked on Sherlock’s. Something seems to be threading between them, some kind of intimacy that settles over John’s skin like the warmth of the sunlight above them.
– is this what Moriarty meant? Is his heart being burnt out of him now, as he stands here and makes these
“I know,” John says. He feels oddly touched that Sherlock would say such a thing to him, but then a thought occurs to him. “It wasn’t Mary’s either,” he adds. “I don’t know why she felt so guilty; she went home early crying and apologizing.”
John touches his face, turns it towards him. Sherlock jolts at the touch, but John doesn’t remove his fingers, and Sherlock finds that his heart is racing. He can’t control himself, can’t control his expression, and he knows how vulnerable he looks, he
“John,” she says. Her eyes are kind and filling with tears. She tilts her head, her dark blonde hair shifting away from her face in an intimately familiar way. Her eyes are blue and he’s well acquainted with them. They settle on him unerringly and she smiles, though her lip quivers. “John, I’m so proud of you; you’ve done so well for yourself, haven’t you?”
She shrugs him off, still sobbing, and sits up.  She’s hiccupping for breath now, and John feels something break in his heart.  It’s all so clear now, and he knows what to do.  His panic begins to recede.
“Oh, I wouldn’t move if I were you,” Moriarty calls. John had somehow forgotten he was there, so wrapped up was he in Sherlock’s story. “That was touching, by the way,” he adds. “Truly.”
There aren’t any sounds coming from inside the flat, and while that would be a sign of a peaceful home for most people, it makes him a bit worried about exactly what Sherlock could be getting up to in there. A quiet Sherlock is not always a good sign, and so he opens the door and braces himself for the worst, hoping Sherlock isn’t doing anything too crazy as he’s not in the mood to deal with it.
“Goodbye, John,” Sherlock says. He smiles at him, sadly, and the smoke grows closer to his face. John reaches out his hand, his fingers trembling. He steps forward once more, closing the distance between them. He’s eager to touch him, to pull him close, to save him from whatever is happening.
“Go straight,” she tells him. “Or, as straight as you can around the trees, at least. You may see paths to the left or right, but don’t take them; you’ll just get lost. Go straight and walk for a minute or two, and you’ll come out at…at
They surface a moment later, and John sputters, his hair flattened to his head in sopping wet clumps, his arm wrapped around an equally wet (and therefore much diminished in size) Redbeard. John looks around him and his eyes widen when he realizes where he is; he’s in the lake he’d come to with Sherlock when they got Redbeard. He’s near Mycroft’s house, then, he knows. There’s no sign of him, though, and John startles when he sees a familiar woman sitting on a large rock beside the lake.
And they do, walking together in whichever direction the traffic lights favor. Iris’ cries soften after a few minutes until eventually they disappear altogether and she falls into an exhausted sleep. Tension seeps from John’s shoulders, and Sherlock feels unaccountably relieved.
people did, not something anyone would want to do with him. Nevertheless, he and John are giggling and chatting as they make their way home, and John seems delighted by almost everything Sherlock says. It’s a strange, heady feeling, and Sherlock can’t keep the small smile on his lips away, nor would he want to.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I have a set of robes I usually wear. They’re quite thick, and I put a lot of wards on them. They help keep the magic out.”
Though it was a few weeks ago that John met Arthur, the experience is still fresh on his mind and he feels a shiver of distrust go up his spine, his jaw clenching and eyes narrowing. The man on the roof puts his arms in front of him in a gesture of surrender, palms facing John. “Easy,” he says, taking in John’s aggressive stance, his voice gruff but kind. “I’m a friend of Sherlock’s.”
They walk in silence, and John steps closer to Sherlock, so close that their arms are pressed together. When they arrive at the tree, John’s overwhelmed by how beautiful it is, and he tilts his head back to try and look up at it, but he can’t see all the way to the top. The fruits, surrounded by vivid red flowers and lush green leaves, glow with the same magical light of the lantern he holds with Sherlock. John swallows, overcome by the sight, suddenly aware of how lucky he is that he’s able to witness such a thing. His heart is beating faster again, but this time, it’s not out of fear.
Sherlock smiles back. It’s warm and open, and John reaches out blindly for Sherlock’s hand, not daring to take his eyes off Sherlock’s face. He finds it and tangles their fingers together.
alive. So, essentially, your presence here ensures two things at the same time: that this building and its contents continue to exist and that Sherlock remains alive,” Mycroft says.
“Do you expect me to do everything for you?”  Mycroft asks.  “I don’t know how Sherlock puts up with you.”
Sherlock puts both of his hands into his hair again, squeezes, and then turns back to John, taking him in, data flying through his mind almost quicker than he can process it. “You asked a woman out on a
Sherlock wants to protest, doesn’t want him to go, but he nods, and John climbs over him. He comes back quickly with a warm, wet flannel, and he prods Sherlock until he’s lying flat on his back, and Sherlock melts into the mattress, feeling boneless and pleased. He knows he’s looking up at John with a smile he’d normally want to hide, but he can’t bring himself to care.
“I can’t go back after this,” he says. He lets the words drift into John’s skin and imagines them sinking in and staying there forever, safe inside of John. He feels lightheaded and dizzy at the thought of knowing he could feel this way, of knowing he could have this, and then not having it. “If you change your mind-“
John’s touches his knee and Sherlock looks up questioningly, then his heart beats faster and he stares with wide eyes as John reach into his pocket and pull out the belt of his old dressing gown, folded into a tiny square.
“Concentrate,” Billy says, his voice muffled.  “I know it’s hard, mate, but you have to focus.  No distractions.”
“You know I hate meaningless expressions,” Sherlock adds. His lip is quirked up in a familiar smirk, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “And for the record, I’m being neither nice nor considerate. I’m never nice, John, you should know that. I’m quite selfish.”
“Still magic,” John says, wondering exactly what kind of world Greg is used to that lighting a cigarette with a wave of his hand is normal.
The spirits fall quiet, apparently having come to the same conclusion, and they begin to move, clearing a path for John and Sherlock to take.
“What a day,” John says, sending a floating beer in Sherlock’s direction with a flick of his wand. Sherlock takes it and drinks it, though he doesn’t normally like beer very much.
Mary’s lips thin to a firm line for a moment, and then she nods stiffly. “I’m fine,” she says. “Do you understand what happened to you today? Did Sherlock tell you?”
And in that moment, his hands in the air, the helicopter roaring in his ears, a dead body at his feet – dead by
“You waited here for me all that time?” John asks, unable to focus on Mrs. Hudson and Billy while he tries to process everything else Sherlock is telling him.
“What?” John asks, turning around abruptly.  “What?”  He looks between the two of them rapidly.  The man is smiling his smarmy smile, and Sherlock is just staring at him with a murderous expression.  Neither are looking at John.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow, but they lack anything resembling an edge because he is so content with John being so close. “Why do I have to do it?” he complains, voice rough from sleep.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker over John’s face, but he doesn’t look convinced. When he speaks, his voice is a calm murmur, but the urgency in his eyes betrays his tone. “Isn’t it a bit much to suddenly learn that your life expectancy has increased exponentially? And that you’re tied to me for the duration of it?”
When the two men come into the alley, John and Sherlock are ready.   The fight breaks out quickly, and John is fighting with a fervor he hasn’t felt in ages. His body is responding faster than ever, and it’s like the lethargy that’s plagued him for months now has evaporated. He feels alive, his blood is pumping through his veins, and he notices that Sherlock has already taken out the suspect’s accomplice when the suspect, currently gripping John’s left forearm, pulls out a knife.
He’d meant to pick her up and analyze her, memorize her, and yet he thinks he has drastically misjudged what a factor sentiment would play in this moment, and he thinks that’s always the problem with anything to do with John. Instead, he finds himself staring at her, smiling a small smile when her tiny fingers curl around one of his. He knows it’s just a meaningless action, something all babies do, but it feels special somehow, and his heart flutters in his chest.
“If you want to go to the kitchens, you don’t have to sneak there,” Mycroft continues. “Herbert will give you a meringue. I’m sure he’s already set some aside for you.”
Sherlock sighs. “Uneventful,” he says. “I had to negotiate the terms of an old wish with a rather unsavory character. It took a long time to track him down, but we found him eventually and did what we had to do.”
“I’m finished,” Sherlock says, being sure to soften his tone so he doesn’t sound angry. He’s not, anyway. He feels a weight in his chest that he doesn’t understand, a sadness pulling at him that he can’t shake.
Sherlock sits up straight, suddenly as alert as he can be and focused on John. “Yes,” he says. “I did. It does.”
“Pass me the urn and the water, one at a time,” Sherlock says, leaning down to look at John through the open window.
“No, with Mary,” John says. He smiles a bit. “I asked her for dinner, actually, but she was busy. She wants to go out tomorrow night, though.”
“Er, right, thanks,” John says, stepping into the little curtained off food stand.  There’s a small counter with two stools next to a stove, and the smell inside is heavenly.  It’s testament to how strange the past few weeks of his life have been that somehow, the idea of some kind of half man, half fox creature doesn’t send him running, and he resists the urge to laugh.  He feels crazy enough as it is.
“All moved in,” John says awkwardly. Sherlock glances up to see him looking around at the sofa and then the chair Sherlock’s currently in, before settling down into the opposite armchair, adjusting the pillow to suit his needs. “Er, it’s a bit chilly, isn’t it? Do you mind if I…?” He gestures toward the fireplace, and Sherlock waves his hand in nonchalant acquiescence, though he’s actually quite eager to witness and analyze John’s magic.
Sherlock pulls away, breathless, and stands. John eagerly follows, reaching up to kiss him again even though he has to push up on his toes to reach him properly. Sherlock ducks his head and their kiss deepens, and John can’t help but groan, pressing his hips against Sherlock’s, curling his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. He takes a step backwards, urging Sherlock with him, doing his best not to break the kiss, and Sherlock follows. Clumsily, they make their way to the hallway, kissing as they go, breaking apart in surprise when John’s back thuds into the wall.   John giggles, pulling Sherlock’s head down for a kiss. He leans against the wall for a moment and savors the feeling of Sherlock’s body against his. He moans when he feels Sherlock’s hardness pressing against his hip, and he can’t help but twist his hips, pressing himself against Sherlock. Sherlock gasps, a low, breathy sound.
“Oh, indeed,” Sherlock says, raising one eyebrow, then looking out over the path as a bit of embarrassment flushes over John.
John’s quiet for a moment, and so is Sherlock. Sherlock’s taking another drag of his pipe, and the smell, once annoying, has become comforting to John. “We met every day after school for a few months, until it was his birthday. We were going to celebrate together, but when I got to the park where we usually met, he was crying. He said it was time for him to go. I didn’t know what he meant; I thought maybe he was moving.”
, somewhere deep, deep inside of him. He swallows and then clears his throat. “Every day you meant more to me,” he says, his voice choked. “And you – you
Sherlock doesn't reply as John walks over to the corner of the expansive room, the bird and butterfly following him, and stops where the small waterfall flows over some rocks into a tiny pond. John steps closer and awkwardly leans down to splash his fingers through the water, then looks up at Sherlock with an incredulous laugh. “This is brilliant!” he says.
“Oi,” John says, laughing, nudging Sherlock’s long leg with his foot. “Don't sleep down there. You have a bed.”
“I wonder what today’s weather will be like,” Sherlock suddenly interrupts, narrowing his eyes at the fortuneteller.
Sherlock smiles back, and ignores the way his heart is trying to beat its way out of his chest, and focuses instead on the familiarity of John, of going to Angelo’s, of
John shrugs, chewing his food. “Not really,” he says once he’s swallowed. “I mean, they’re attracted to me, right?”
John takes a sip, and the liquid is hot against his tongue. It’s a well-prepared cup, and he eyes Sherlock suspiciously. “Have you done something to this?” he asks.
Sherlock smiles wickedly and shifts until she’s straddling John. She leans down and kisses her, soft, warm, sweet, full of promise. She strokes her fingers along John’s jaw, presses a tender kiss to the corner of her mouth. “Let me show you,” she says. “You can’t be expected to deduce
“Don’t be crass; of course I’m not a spirit,” Mycroft calls back.  He sounds bored, but when John glances back at him, he looks like a snake ready to strike.
John nods. He feels confused and vulnerable, but he wants to be sure Mary’s okay. Sherlock stands and John fights the urge to reach out and grab hold of him, to have a minute more with him. He’s the one who said he wants to see Mary, after all, so he lies still as Sherlock goes into the hallway. He listens weakly to muffled voices outside Sherlock’s door before Mary comes inside.
Sherlock is quiet beside him, picking at his own share, though John can feel him watching him with a curious and intent expression that would make John a lot more uncomfortable if he weren’t so hungry. Once John has finished most of his food, he takes a drink of water, then takes a deep breath, feeling much more comfortable.
The building to his left is old, and there are at least 16 different spells on the building itself. Sherlock can feel them, enchantments and protections and heavy, cold magic that feels like it’s gripping him and won’t let go where his arm is pressed against it. He pushes away from it and launches himself at Dad, curls his little hands into his robes and starts to cry.
He feels hopelessly incompetent and incapable of expressing himself, feels as if his mind is sluggish and his body is in the way. He doesn’t understand why it has to be this way, but John is regarding him as if he hasn’t done anything strange, so he allows himself to feel a hesitant sense of encouragement.
“How’d you – right, I won’t ask how you know all that. You’re brilliant. But I don’t think I can afford the rent here.”
; it feels, for a moment, like it did when they stood beside the tree in his ballroom so many years ago, and he looks up at the tree for a moment, then back at John, and John seems to know exactly what he’s just thought because suddenly they’re both giggling, the surreal quality of the moment washing over them, and Sherlock feels a lightness in his heart he doesn’t think he has felt since that one night, so many years ago.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, voice barely above a whisper. “It’s – I’ve never… I don’t know what it means.”
“You are most certainly quite delicious to them, yes. But don’t you find it strange that today of all days this spirit, of a magnitude you’ve never encountered before, decides to follow you around and go so far as to pierce your skin with its teeth?” Sherlock sounds a bit agitated, and John frowns.
Something akin to relief rushes through him when he sees that the creature making its way through the crowd is none other than the little fox-boy from Angelo’s, marching determinedly through the crowd of spirits.
Angelo doesn’t say anything, but he puts a food of plate in front of John, whose eyes widen.  “Thank you,” John says, reaching for his fork.  He takes a bite, and the food seems to melt on his tongue.  The flavor is unlike anything he’s ever eaten, and he closes his eyes for a moment to savor it.  “It’s amazing,” he says.
, of spirits. They’re in every size, shape, color, and form imaginable; some look vaguely human, some look a bit like animals, some are oddly enough geometric shapes. Some of them are quite corporeal, but others are wispy like smoke, and yet all of them are carrying a glowing lantern identical to Sherlock’s and John’s. He looks down at theirs, and sure enough, it’s glowing just the same as all the others, the light a warm orangey-red in the darkness.
“You-“ John begins, anger simmering at the surface. He’s clenching and unclenching his hand at his side, but Sherlock seems impervious to his anger. “You – what
,” Billy says with a cackle. Mrs. Hudson snorts and then does her best to act like she hasn’t been laughing when John looks at her in annoyance. Sherlock ignores them and seems inordinately pleased, if the flush that creeps up his neck means anything.
“Comment on my state of mind, or whatever it is you’ve figured out since you came in the room,” John says.
. He doesn’t even know these people, and now he’s going to go to the shops for them and make dinner? He can’t understand why he’s doing this.
Mrs. Hudson frowns and reaches out, holding her frail hand against his arm. He feels doubt creeping in on him, but he shakes his head, thinking of Arthur alone on the bench, alone for so many years, alone like him.
“I’d like,” Sherlock blurts immediately, then blinks, realizing what he’s said. John begins to laugh, high-pitched giggles, and then he’s kissing him and laughing at the same time, and Sherlock thinks he’s melting into the couch.
again, and Sherlock looks away for a moment, a flutter in his heart that makes him feel like he’s floating, like he can’t breathe.
“The poor dear,” Mrs. Hudson murmurs. Billy makes a sympathetic sound in agreement, but John is too tired to reply.
“She’s drinking water instead of wine and she keeps touching her stomach but not like she’s ashamed,” he says, looking up at Mycroft for approval.
He turns to leave, and this time, like a flood of sensation, his body feels like his own again, and he’s in complete control. He’s taken one step towards the doorway when the man’s deep voice interrupts him.
Sherlock stares at him for a moment, his eyes still wide, trying to process what has happened. John keeps hold of his hand, covers it with his other hand, until Sherlock’s hand is surrounded by both of John’s, warm and protected.
They’re freezing cold against his back as they get closer and closer to him. Even in the muggy warmth of July, the cold is far from pleasant. He swallows hard as he steps forward, and a sweat breaks out on his already clammy skin as he feels one of them make contact with his back, a solid presence despite its form, which appears to be made of something akin to thick smoke. He dares a glance over his shoulder as he staggers forward and he sees a large eye staring back at him on top of a mouth full of sharp, pointed teeth, solid amongst its foggy body. He’s not sure what would happen if those teeth manage to grab hold of him, and his body is shaking as the mass of spirits comes closer to join the one already attached to him. He’s not willing to find out.
He’s distantly aware that the spirits are drawing closer to him, and he realizes that he must trust Sherlock if he wants to succeed. Sherlock told him he was strong and powerful, told him he can do this, and apparently everyone has known this for a long time – the spirits have always known it, Sherlock has always known it – John’s the only one who hasn’t believed it. He suddenly opens his eyes, a wave of concentrated energy and power washing over him as he lets himself fully trust what Sherlock has told him, fully believe in Sherlock’s words, fully believe in
Now that he’s faced with John, with the worried John he doesn’t like to see, Sherlock doesn’t know what to do. He ignores John’s words, unable to focus on anything but what he needs to do. “John, I – that is to say-”
John regards him suspiciously for a moment, but when he seems genuinely curious and not judgmental, John answers, against his better judgment. “She was, actually. Felt guilty, she said, but I can’t see why. He had an aneurism; there’s nothing she could’ve done. She was actually quite kind to him.”
“I don’t really understand why she has a problem making friends,” John says with a frown. “She’s always friendly.”
Yet he could say nothing.  He’d had no time to say what he had wanted to say. Even if he had tried, the roar of the helicopter, the megaphones, the horror, and his pulse pounding in his ears would have drowned him out. The words were lodged deep in his heart, and so he spoke easier words instead.  The words he’d wanted to say were nothing but the painful core at the center of his unraveling universe; a rock of emotion deep in his body wrapped up in memories of sentiment he hadn’t let himself think of since he was a child.  He had choked them down and turned to face the lights of the helicopters, thinking only of John, and hoping more than he’d ever hoped before that John could finally be safe.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No,” he says, his voice choked. He sniffs, his breath catching. “You’ve saved me, John.”
Mycroft gets his Hogwarts letter later that summer. Sherlock watches as Mummy hugs him, and then Dad makes a fountain of glittering confetti shoot from the tip of his wand. Sherlock giggles, delighted, and asks him to do it again. He does, because he likes to indulge Sherlock, and Sherlock watches carefully, feels the swirl of Dad’s warm orange magic and the distinct sharpness of his spell, feels the movement of his wand deep inside his stomach. He blinks, watches as the brightly colored rainbow confetti floats in the air, falls, and disappears.
“No,” she says. “I haven’t. But that doesn’t mean I’m not certain they’re real.” She turns to John, frowning. “It must be very hard for you.”
me,” John snarls, ignoring the pounding in his head and the confusion of the spirits. “I’m thankful for them and I appreciate them, and I asked them to help me. It’s up to them if they do. But I’d like to give them the choice to make on their own, thanks, rather than manipulating them for my own needs.”
John smiles at him, his heart skipping beat at the sight of this annoying man living and breathing and whole.
John looks up and sees Sherlock. He’s surprised enough that he manages to gasp in some air, and he tries to breathe shallowly through the small coughs that still try to take over.
John blinks, thinking she’s one of the oddest people he’s ever met even if she is very kind. “Right, sorry,” he says. He turns back to the fire and sips his tea, pointedly not looking at her, marveling at the oddity of his life. After a little while, enough time for him to have already finished half of his cup, she begins to play.
As usual, I'd love to hear your thoughts!  I hope you're enjoying the story, and thank you for reading! <3
Sherlock laughs, his scowl disappearing, and grins at John. “Nothing new about that,” he says. Now that they’re out of Mycroft’s presence, Sherlock seems to be filled with a sort of manic energy. He steps into the forest and John crowds him as he had before, the chill immediately descending over them.
and then his mind catches up to him and without even thinking about it, he is dipping his head, his hands tugging on John’s waist, pulling him closer, and John’s lips are back.
Sherlock smiles. “No, she told you all you needed to know. Any more would have been dangerous and irresponsible. The wrong information can seriously alter the path someone chooses to take. That’s why you needed to see a real fortuneteller after that fake this afternoon.”
“See you,” Arthur replies, sitting back down on the bench as John walks away. John makes his way slowly out of the park, the early winter chill making him too cold to be comfortable. He coughs more than he’d like on his way home, and he feels a bit feverish. By the time he makes it to Baker Street, he’s exhausted, and glad to be home.
John frowns.  “Are you lost?” he asks.  “Do you know where your house is?”  It occurs to him that her house can’t be here, but that doesn’t seem important now.  He pushes the thought aside, focusing on the distress of the little girl in front of him.
?” they’re saying, and the big teeth and eyes are beginning to look scary again. John’s heart pounds, and he looks to Sherlock for help, but Sherlock is standing still, staring at the spirits. He seems a bit shocked.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock says, wrinkling his nose. “When you brought the spirits out of the forest, Mycroft could sense the disturbance in the energy. He figured out what was happening, and he could safely pass through the forest since the spirits left. You are the only one besides Moriarty who’s made it through, John. Not even Mycroft or I could have gone through unaided before now, with the spirits under Moriarty’s thumb as they were.”
Sherlock goes back to the doorway to the living room and leans against it, watching John with a neutral expression on his face. “No one said you were,” he says.
John has a mysterious nighttime visitor who tells him a bit about Sherlock's past, and something unexpected happens with Mary.
“I’ll give you this,” Sherlock finally says, reaching into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and pulling out a plain, unadorned silver ring. “Wear it on your pinky.”
Without thinking, he lets his fingers drift through Sherlock’s hair, the soft curls winding themselves around his fingers. Sherlock turns his head suddenly, blinking up at John.
“You’re gorgeous,” John says, choked, his eyes traveling over Sherlock’s body, taking in the smooth, pale skin interrupted only by the occasional mole or freckle. John wants to connect all the dots with his tongue, wants to taste every inch, wants to find every spot that makes Sherlock moan and writhe, wants the cock that lies hard against Sherlock’s belly, wants
“That’s certainly not the face of belief,” Sherlock says. He looks amused, if the slightly raised eyebrow is anything to go by. “John H. Watson,” he repeats. “And what does the H stand for?” he asks.
John’s thumbs slide back and forth over Sherlock’s hands. He doesn’t say anything, just looks up at Sherlock, and Sherlock can’t look away, can’t move. He is frozen to the spot, his mind spinning in circles, taking in useless data he can’t read. He feels his breath hitch, feels his entire body long to take a step closer to John, but he doesn’t dare.
defective that makes it matter so much to him, but then he feels the crown in his pocket, and he feels the usual conflict rise inside him; perhaps it’s not a false memory after all. Perhaps it’s true.
. He takes the steps two at a time and pushes into 221B, ignoring the sounds of Sherlock playing the violin – for some reason, it annoys him to discover that Sherlock can do such a beautiful, sensitive thing – and slams the door shut behind him.
John’s hands are trembling, but he manages to shake her shoulder nonetheless, her bones frail under his hands. She doesn’t respond, and he shakes harder. “Mrs. Hudson, please,
Mary smiles in agreement, but then glances up at the clock and stands abruptly, her face turning serious. “It’s already 1:50,” she says. “Time flies, doesn’t it?”
John closes his eyes and covers them with one hand. His head hurts, and this conversation isn’t helping, but he knows that Sherlock is right.
John’s still for a moment, just looking at him, his eyes soft and warm and open in a way that makes Sherlock shiver, and then he kisses him, gently shifting his hips, making Sherlock writhe beneath him and moan into the kiss.
“Call Molly,” Billy suggests, and John is grateful for Billy’s presence, which has slowly become comforting to him.
“Let’s go to bed,” John says. His voice is hushed, and Sherlock’s heart shifts into a fast, heady rhythm as something jolts deep inside of him. “I don’t – we’ve only just, I don’t want to rush,” John says quickly. “We have time, yeah? I just want – we have the monitor. Iris will be fine on her own. Can we-“
The fox-boy nods eagerly, his tail twitching, and John nods at Sherlock. Together, they turn and walk towards the tree. The monsters are watching them go, but they fade out of John’s focus, turning into a background blur of colors and shapes. The only thing he can focus on is the tree ahead of them, Sherlock’s fingers woven into his, the rough feel of the handle beneath their hands.
anything, because surely Sherlock knows a way to fight the spirits, one of which is so close to John that he can feel its breath, oddly hot, wafting over his face. He presses closer to Sherlock, squirming away from the nauseating sensation of the spirit’s breath, sure that this is the end – but suddenly, the voices of the spirits stop and the spirit in front of him pauses and then retreats at the sound of a small scream.
“That’s a bit philosophical, isn’t it?” John remarks, eyes following a small butterfly that flies over their heads.
He’s breathing regularly, and his pulse is fine, but John’s eyes keep flitting frantically over his features, trying to absorb as many details as he can, to ascertain whether or not he’ll be okay, but it’s near impossible because he has no idea what’s just happened.  He glances up towards where the woman was, but he can’t see her; she’s already gone.  He has a feeling he should chase her, but he knows he can’t leave Sherlock, and panic is beginning to build inside of hi.
John laughs again, but it’s tinged with something darker and he hopes desperately he can control himself. “Is this when you tell me I should’ve listened to you?”
His arm moves fluidly with his bow, he effortlessly expresses everything he feels, and he is so involved in the music that when he plays the final note, hushed and gorgeous and lush and full of his heart, and when the pure and vibrant sound stops ringing around him, his ears become aware of the quiet of 221B in a new and transformative way. Suddenly, the silence feels loud and beautiful and full of promise again, and he lets out a shaky exhale and feels a chill of frisson run down his spine as he lowers his arms, ignoring the pain he feels from holding them up for so long, his mind and heart still fully in the mood of the piece. When his violin is down and he lets the music leave him, lets the atmosphere uncharge from the magical moment he’s just created, he hears a creaking floorboard and he swings around with wide eyes when he realizes he’s not alone.
Gently, almost reverently, Sherlock reaches out and takes his hand. He pulls it away from John’s face and sets it down beside him, curling his own long fingers around it.
His voice is thin, shaky, and Mary seems concerned, but she bites her lip and nods, face downcast and a bit sad. John turns and leaves as fast as he can without running, the spirit behind him the whole time.
“It’s alright, dear,” Mrs. Hudson says, leaning forward and holding his forearm. “He’ll be right back.” Her hand is soothing and it feels nice against his chilled skin, and he closes his eyes and nods. Everything seems to be swimming around him.
the one who confirmed that your father died young, and the same with your mother, and the fact that you lived alone. Once she knew all of that, it would be very easy for her to imagine that you faced a lot of difficulties growing up; most children who lose their parents do. As for your independence, that’s also easily extrapolated from the data you gave her.”
John kisses him softly, soothingly. His lips are warm and he presses them against Sherlock’s and Sherlock feels as though he’s melting, as if he could cry. His entire body feels as if it’s on fire and nothing he’d ever dared imagine this would be like compares to the reality of this feeling. John holds his lips still for a moment, just keeps a gentle, reassuring pressure against Sherlock’s, and then he shifts his head a bit.   Their noses bump, just a little, and it makes Sherlock’s heart skip a beat. John kisses him again, and this time, he lets his lips part. Sherlock feels the warmth of John’s breath against his lips and his own lips part easily, and then John kisses him again, and it’s smooth and sweet and it’s
John blinks, his mind jumping out of its trancelike state and jolting back into action as he watches Sherlock swim further and further away. He clears his throat. “Right, yeah,” he says, though Sherlock is likely to far away to hear, and swims after Sherlock.
Sherlock hesitates, unsure how to proceed. He’d forgotten John doesn’t know about them in his haste to fix his leg.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says sharply. He slings his bow over his shoulder and approaches John, helps him sit on the bench for a moment. “It was my decision to make, and I made it.”
, tired of searching for someone everyone says doesn’t exist, tired of wondering if he’s crazy, tired of being so lonely. He thinks maybe it’s time to give up.
“Of course, of course,” John says, leading him over to a bench. They sit, their knees pressed together, bodies turned toward each other. Sherlock can’t believe this is happening, can’t believe this is real.
John stands, and though Sherlock knew it was about to happen, he’s still left feeling cold in John’s absence, a feeling that takes him by surprise. But then John takes his hand and pulls him up and Sherlock can’t help it, really; he bends his neck down and cups John’s head to kiss him again. He doesn’t feel as skilled at this as John is, and so he just presses his mouth against John’s, closes his eyes, holds their lips together for a moment and relishes the feeling before he pulls away. When he opens his eyes, John is smiling at him. Sherlock has the urge to close his eyes again, but instead, he lets John tug him along to Sherlock’s bedroom, grabbing the baby monitor on the way.
“It’s certainly true that meeting someone can change your luck,” Sherlock says, moving to stand beside John and leaning forward to enter his personal space. “However, I will tell you this as many times as you need to hear it. I don’t believe Mary Morstan is your Lady Luck.”
Mycroft rolls his eyes, and John forces himself to ignore him.  He reaches into Sherlock’s jacket, desperately trying not to focus on the way Sherlock doesn’t react to his touch, and pulls out his phone, glad Sherlock has told him the passcode.  He scrolls through the contacts until he finds Molly.  He calls her, holding the phone tight against his ear, his eyes trained on Sherlock’s still form as his free hand returns to clutch Sherlock’s shirt.
“I’m not taking a bloody skull with me to the grocery store,” John says. “People think I’m crazy enough as it is,” he added, thinking of people avoiding him on the streets as he runs from things they can’t see.
Sherlock feels warm and safe and loved and there’s a fluttering deep in his stomach.  He wants to touch, to taste, to feel, to devour; he wants so much, but he doesn’t know where to start.  He starts small: he lets his thumb swoop a little bit higher, just brushing the tip of John’s nipple, hardened in the cool morning air.  John shivers, and Sherlock feels his cock harden and he presses another kiss to John’s chest, shifting his hips, letting John feel him.
While John’s at work the next day, Sherlock ventures into Diagon Alley. He wears his thickest robes, the ones he’s cast warding spells all over to keep the magic away from him, and he goes straight to the botanical shop. He makes his purchases and leaves as quickly as he can, then goes straight home. He goes into his secret room and carefully plants his new items, easily getting lost in the familiar but long unused skill, and casts the necessary magic to ensure their growth. He puts his fingers on his chin and tilts his head just so as he stares at the room around him, and then waves his hand until small fairy lights are suspended throughout the entirety of the space, glowing soft and warm.
John’s heart is pounding, but he gathers the trash from his lunch and throws it away, not looking over his shoulder as he heads to his office, his body moving in his usual routine but his mind spinning in circles he can’t keep up with. He doesn’t have to turn around to know that the spirit’s behind him. He can feel it, can feel the cold seeping towards him and the goose bumps continuing to break out over his flesh.
“He doesn’t want to talk about that yet,” Sherlock tells Billy. He presses his knee closer to John’s and his thumb starts moving in soothing circles on John’s back.
