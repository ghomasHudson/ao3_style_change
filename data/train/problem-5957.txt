"Tony?" he gasped as tears began to spill down his cheeks. Tony was alive, as his nanite case was still glowing blue, but his vitals were already beginning to crash.
Tony exclaimed, nearly collapsing with relief when he saw Steve's X-302 emerge from behind a pocket of marshmallow-like clouds. "Honey, I can—I can see you. You're—you're almost here, and—"
"Dad's right, little guy, there's no sense in pushing things if we don't have to," Papa said in his Captain's voice, which Peter knew better than to argue with. "You can take it easy tomorrow and then go back the next day."
"We could build even more power plants, therefore reducing the overall strain on each individual plant and also reducing the chance of an accidental overload," Peter finished. "That's—well, as long as the extra energy buildup won't put any undue strain on the containment vessel, it should work."
Peter's attempt to defend Gwen's honour was interrupted by the arrival of their teacher, who promptly launched into a lecture on the fall of the Iron Curtain following World War II. Since those events occurred after Papa's time, him having been frozen in 1945 before the Allies won the war, Peter made sure to take decent notes knowing that he would be sharing them later on with Papa and Uncle Bucky. Papa especially had become very interested in the events that occurred shortly after he was frozen, and Peter suspected it was because he was searching for historical parallels with the current political climate.
"Bucky!" he cried, choking against the putrid fumes as he pounded on the canopy, trying to focus in on his friend. "Bucky, can you hear me?"
“Nothing,” Steve says instead.  “It doesn't matter now.  I've got you.  I've got you, and I’m not letting you go.”
"Well… yeah…" Steve said. That was no exageration, he really did stink at poker. "But I don't understand what that has to do with Tony."
"Well, I promise this'll only take a minute, and then you can both be on your way." Leading them into the same conference room that they'd stopped off in earlier, Fury closed the door, crossing his arms. "I've just received word from King T'Challa that the Wakandan government has decided to formally open a diplomatic dialogue with SHIELD, one that also includes your team."
"Oh, so now you wanna get all doctor-y on him?" Tony asked. "Well, too late, Strange, you don't get to hear his little secret. Just suffice it to say that he's a helluva lot stronger than he looks
And eating dessert before dinner was something that Peter turned down. At least once every couple of weeks if Dad was busy in the lab or something, he and Papa would take a detour on the way home for ice cream.
“You're sure you don't need anything, honey?” Dad asked as he attached the final lead.  “I’m sure Pete wouldn't mind lending you one of his polar bears or something.”
He at least had the wherewithal to emerge from his mind fog in time to brace himself for the high-pitched shrill of the bell. He had already been caught unawares by it twice that day, nearly knocking his computer to the floor one of the times in his haste to cover his ears, and he really didn't feel like having to listen to Flash tease him about being afraid of it yet again.
Ma nodded, wiping her eyes. "He reminds me so much of Steven at this age," she said. "Such a fierce strength of mind, but trapped inside a weak body that's trying to hold him back. And now he'll finally be able to break free from it, just like Steven."
“Gotta say, I do enjoy that giddy optimism of yours,” he says, his voice just a touch lighter than before.  “Even when it’s being ridiculous.”
Evidenced by the fact that he was already on his third backpack for the year, and it was still only October.
Pulling back on the handle, Bucky stepped back, allowing Steve to reach inside the tank and grab onto the collar of one of the soldiers, yanking him out and launching him twenty metres away, where he landed with a rather sickening
"Okay, but take off your clothes for me first, yeah?" Tony asked. He tugged rather impatiently on Steve's tight blue t-shirt. "Please, baby, I wanna see your gorgeous body."
"What I'm about to tell you could end both my career and yours," he said. "And I'm not talking about the whole happy retirement-type end. I'm talking about a court-martial, going to prison-type end, do you understand me?
that it will, Captain," clarified Dr Cho. "But Peter did sustain a pretty notable concussion, so… it's probably best to plan on a few days, maybe even a week. That way if he wakes up sooner, it'll be a pleasant surprise."
"I think that's part of it, little guy. HYDRA has always tried to take out as much of its opposition as possible." Papa gave Dad's hand a quick squeeze, no doubt thinking of Grandpa and Grandma Stark and how they were killed on HYDRA's orders. "But Dad and I have also theorised that the main reason why they gave us all that drug in the Miami bunker was to take over our minds, probably to try and force us to become part of them."
“Okay, so now this piece,” Peter said, holding up the piece shaped like a rearing horse, “is called a knight, and it moves in an L-shape.  Like this.”  He proceeded to demonstrate the very movement on the board.  “I like to save these pieces until later since they’re pretty powerful, but my Uncle James likes to take ‘em out pretty early, so it’s up to you.”
"Ah, I gotcha. Then I promise I won't tell anyone," said Steve. "And, if you don't mind, maybe I can bring in one of my sketchbooks next time and we can draw together?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit that kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Good," Steve said softly. He handed Tony the soup spoon, waiting nervously for him to take the first spoonful. Peter had told him it was delicious, but from what Steve had seen over the last year, Peter was far less picky about his food than Tony was.
Steve scrubbed his palm down his face as he glanced back at Peter, lying as still as a corpse on the stretcher. His lips were no longer blue, thanks to the warming packs and blanket and the heated IV fluids flowing into his skinny body, but he still looked just as pale and lifeless as he had down in that Miami hospital, and no matter how much Steve tried to tell himself that it wasn't the same, it didn't seem to be working.
"My papa's done all sorts of videos for the school," Peter said. "Our principal asked him 'cause his grandfather was one of Papa's Howling Commandos. We watch his fitness challenge videos in our gym class, and he's also done some on bullying and following rules for the younger kids."
“Shh, honey.  None of that matters now.”  Tony didn't like thinking about what might’ve happened if he hadn’t met Steve.  Or if he hadn’t gone back to the bookstore that Monday and literally broken in to check on him.
“Yeah.  Okay,” Tony says.  Carefully, he places his hands on Steve’s leg, one on his ankle and the other just below his knee, bracing himself on one knee as he resumes his mumbling, his fingertips gliding up and down Steve’s leg, pressing lightly on various parts.
With a slight shudder Tony returned his attention to the screen, sitting up straighter as the code completed its compile and the words INITIATE SYSTEM appeared across the top of the screen.
"No! Please, no!" Bucky cried as Sam grasped onto his right hand, not taking his eyes off Winter Soldier, who had almost managed to break through the restraints holding his metal left arm in place. Bruce was on his feet as well, standing by the back wall and looking like he was ready to pounce.
Steve watched his teammates file out of the room, turning to Tony once they were alone to find him idly tracing his finger along the chain holding Steve's dog tags underneath his shirt. He was deep in thought, and judging from the tight set of his jaw and the slight narrowing of his eyes, it wasn't a particularly good thought.
"I'll say it as often as you need me to," Steve whispered into Tony's hair. He pressed a kiss to the top of Tony's head before getting to his feet. "Are you ready to go see Peter now?"
"Coming!" Shuffling his way into the kitchen, Peter found Papa putting a plate of three huge slices of pizza at his place at the table, ruffing Peter's hair as he sat down.
"Oh, yes," said Grandma. "Joseph was the most wonderful artist. While we were courting he used to draw me pictures all the time, and I always carried at least one of them with me wherever I went. And he was also such a gentleman. Always offering me his arm when we were walking, opening doors, things like that."
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he worried his bottom lip between his teeth. "I'd like to suggest that we try and put a tail on Beck, but the last time we tried that the agents we used turned out to be HYDRA, so—"
"Oh, yeah," said Dr Strange from his perch at the top of a stone staircase, about ten or so metres away. "You're much more of a Thanos."
"Yeah, Papa, I promise," Peter said gently. He tipped his head forward, wrapping his arms around Papa's neck and sighing in contentment when Papa hugged him close. Peter absolutely adored his Papa bear hugs, and Papa always gave them willingly.
Gritting his teeth, Steve pushed himself up to a sitting position and slid his legs over the side of his bed, careful to not allow his casted left foot to bang against the floor. The cast was also driving him completely mad. It was so bulky and heavy and made the skin underneath it itch like hell that he'd been sorely tempted on multiple occasions to try and rip it right off of him, and likely would've already done so if Tony and Peter and the rest of the team hadn't been doing such a good job of distracting him. Sam especially seemed to understand Steve's need to "jump right back into the swing of things", and as such the two of them had been discussing the extent of the Avengers' involvement in the compiling of evidence against the numerous HYDRA agents found to be embedded inside the U.S. government and its corresponding law enforcement agencies. So far they had agreed that Nick Fury, Maria Hill, and George Stacy would take point in the tracking down of any rogue operatives, with the hope that it would help SHIELD to further distance itself from the HYDRA moles once embedded inside it and reestablish the agency in a more positive light, with the Avengers assisting with searches if it became necessary.
"Mmm, no bet," Steve said through a mouthful of eggs. Pretty much any new aircraft turned out to be the best thing he'd ever flown so… "And besides, I'm pretty sure that you're still about a hundred or so short on your tab, so—"
"Yeah, that is a pretty big mess," Peter agreed, just as the bell rang to signal the end of the lunch period, the shrill noise causing him to jump. He was usually able to brace himself in time, but apparently today he'd been too distracted.
"Yeah, I do, but I still think you should take a break," Sam insisted. "There's no reason for you to exhaust yourself before our first meeting with a prince. Especially a prince who's grieving."
"Yes, I can understand that," said Steve. "And I've already told your father that you're welcome to stay as long as you like. I know Agents Barton and Romanoff have been very grateful for his help."
"P-peter?" Papa gasped, his right eye opening just enough for him to look up towards Peter's face. But instead of relaxing a bit Papa immediately tensed, his cheeks going pale beneath their multitude of bruises and his hands shaking in fright. "Who—who're you? What've you done with my son? Oh God, what've you done to my son?"
"Building artificial Spider Vision," Sam said, impressed. "Bummer that you and Rhodey'll be the only ones that'll be able to use it though."
Once again, thank you so much to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints.  You guys are awesome! 💗
"Are we just s'posed to walk through it?" he asked Peter. "It's not gonna like, catch us on fire if we're not worthy or something, right?"
"Hold tight, little guy!" Steve called over the escalating noise, much like an airplane preparing for takeoff. "Peter, just… don't let go of me!"
He was cut off by Steve's downright wicked grin as his long artist's fingers slid down his chest and abdomen and underneath the waistband of Tony's soft pants, closing around his straining erection.
"All right, all right," Steve said, his shoulders dropping in resignation. He leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead. "I won't be long, okay?"
He didn't release Steve’s hand until they had arrived safely back in Tony’s office, where as soon as the door was closed and locked, Steve began to violently shake.
Especially since Obie had already tipped the Joint Chiefs off that something “incredible” was coming.
As Uncle Thor put it, only Loki could cause so much trouble from a prison cell, but Peter also secretly wondered if Loki didn't just miss Uncle Thor from time to time, and therefore was making up problems just so he would come back to see him.
"No, I doubt that, buddy. You're the smartest person I've ever seen so I know you can understand just about anything, but—"
"All right, but we still want you to take it easy, little guy, okay?" said Steve. "Just let us take care of you."
looks. "No, we're not going to kill you, Mr Lang," Steve said. "However, we would appreciate you answering some questions for us."
"Yeah, he was," Peter said. "He even told me we could go shopping for a telescope once we get up to the Compound this weekend." He didn't add that it was beyond weird that they just happened to be preparing to study the space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union right after the occurrence of an actual space phenomenon.
And he really had no business being attracted to anyone at the moment, either. Not with his son in the hospital fighting for his life, and everything else that was at stake.
"No, I—" Steve started, hissing as the pain ramped up to an unbearable level as soon as he moved his arm again, finally giving up when Natasha planted her palm on his shoulder, halting his movements.
"Okay, but in the meantime, what're we supposed to tell him, hmm?" asked Uncle Sam. "'Cause I'm not lying to him. Not about this. You break a kid's trust once over something like this and you'll never get it back."
"Peter," Papa murmured, patting Peter's back with his bandaged fist. "Peter, it's okay. I'm gonna be okay."
"Okay, so, you gentlemen might've noticed that the cockpit has been slightly rearranged," Anthony said over the comm. "This is because in order for the power source to be able to propel the aircraft through the planet's atmosphere and into space, we had to make the whole thing quite a bit lighter."
Peter gulped, biting his bottom lip. "Well… no… but that doesn't mean that I can't still do it. Right?"
Peter nodded again, stepping around the hologram as he studied it while Tony watched him fondly. Peter had always been curious, to the point where it often got him into trouble when he was little, but the fact that he could simply look at a complex hologram and almost instantly understand it was something that both amazed Tony and filled him with pride at the same time. There was no doubt in his mind that Peter was someday going to change the world with his brilliance, and when that day came, he and Steve would be right there in the front row, cheering him on.
Before Steve could reply, an alarm began to sound overhead. Steve gulped as General Okoye pressed a bead attached to a bracelet around her wrist, generating a holographic image of Earth in her palm.
And then another suit appeared, reflecting the faint moonlight in bright spots of white as it flickered across the screen and disappeared, followed shortly by yet another suit.
But now they were both finally healed, and as far as Tony was concerned that meant there were no more excuses.
"That's not why I'm here, Tony," Howard said, so clear and with such conviction that Tony jumped. He hadn't heard Howard speak like that since he was six years old, before his heart surgery.
"Steve, that's not it," Natasha sighed as she plunked back down onto the chair. "I guess I just never expected you to take this one lying down. After everything you've been through, and everything you've overcome, I guess I just never thought you would meet something that would actually beat you."
"Yeah, you guys didn't count on me, did ya?" Peter removed the glasses again, relaxing a bit when the flying suits and the building both reappeared and trying to figure out exactly what he was going to do with this information.
Steve scoffed, releasing Bruce so harshly that he stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over a piece of a fender that had broken off a car. He bent over, his palms on his knees as he tried to force his muddled brain to work.
"It's okay, Steve," he said softly. "I'd rather be able to joke about it than just be wallowing in misery all the time, you know?"
O'Brien nodded, taking another sip of his drink. "Ah, yes. Time. The healer of all wounds." He downed the rest of his glass, setting it back down on the table. "And you, Captain? Your wounds are all healed?"
Papa chuckled as he patted Dad's shoulder. "Thor does tend to be a bit loud, but I suppose that also helps him be a better bodyguard. Scares people away."
One might've thought that after surviving being bombed, kidnapped, experimented on, and nearly suffocating in the middle of the desert, Peter might've earned some kind of get out of jail free card on any further life-altering trauma, but apparently the bombing/ kidnapping was only the warmup. It was barely a year later that the wormhole from space opened up over their Tower home, allowing the Chitauri aliens to invade New York City. And then that led to the huge mess with Project Insight and trying to figure out how to deprogram Uncle Bucky, which then led to Obie breaking into the Tower to kidnap Peter
And then he turned on his heel and climbed into the car. Tony watched as it drove away, leaving him behind, his heart cracking in two and his mind spinning so fast that he felt lightheaded.
"Hey, Captain!" Sharon replied, shooting Steve a quick smile. "It's always good to see you. How's it going over there on the flight deck?"
He hadn't felt that physically attracted to someone in… well, he supposed ever.  Steve was no stranger to lust, or to hiding it.  As a gay man serving in the Army Special Forces, he had perfected the art of keeping his wandering eyes to himself out of both necessity and to maintain the proper chain of command, but this went far beyond that.  He felt, for lack of a better term, like he had just been ambushed.  Only this time, instead of being forced to dig for survivors in the resulting rubble, it was like he was searching for his heart instead.  The heart he had slowly buried over the last twenty years.
"Yeah, but as much as it might be uncomfortable, it's actually good that it is," said Steve. "I'd be worried if we weren't taking this as seriously as we are."
"Yeah, we're—we're friends," Peter stammered. "She's in all my classes and on the Decathlon team, so… we've gotten to be pretty good friends, and…"
Steve's heart fluttered as he released the breath he'd been holding. He had tried so hard to picture what Peter would look like once he was healthy again, and had also been very nervous that he'd somehow get it wrong and make Tony upset.
Steve's entire body was prickling with fear as he reached for Tony again, winding his fingers into his hair and tucking his head under his chin. He had heard far too many stories of families being ripped apart by Hitler and his Nazi regime during the war, soldiers who didn't know where their loved ones were or if they would ever see them again, and Steve just couldn't fathom how he could handle being separated from his own family.
"I'm on it, Cap," came Hill's voice over the comm. "I was just seeing Prince T'Challa off. The fire brigade should be here in about five minutes."
“February 12th, 2019,” Steve continued.  “My team sets up a meeting with a possible source of information on the illegal sales, but before we can meet up, a single sniper shot is fired into an adjacent apartment building.  Not three seconds later, the entire building explodes, trapping dozens of innocent civilians underneath the wreckage.”
"Thanks," Liz answered. She jerked her head towards a rather grand staircase that led to the second floor, the bottom three steps covered in a massive pile of coats and jackets. "Um, you guys can put your jackets there, and there's pizza and drinks in the kitchen. Most of the team is in there, so…"
" Tony begged. He placed both hands on Steve's shoulders, his brown eyes glassy as they pleaded with him to listen. "Please, just go get cleaned up, okay? I promise nothing else is gonna happen while you're in the shower."
"I'm pretty sure I wasn't insinuating anything, sweetheart." Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's forehead, his fingers trailing lightly up and down Tony's bare side. "Sleep now. I know you're tired."
Steve swiped at his eyes, stealing another glance at Tony who hadn't moved a single millimetre, his eyes still glaring bullets at Obadiah Stane. For however much it was hurting Steve to watch what Stane did to Peter down in that Miami bunker, he knew it had to be a million times worse for Tony. Their previous discussions notwithstanding, Steve knew that talking about it was completely different than actually reliving it, and he also suspected that Tony hadn't been quite prepared for how much pain physically laying eyes on Stane again would cause him.
"More urgent than our boy?" yelped Tony, nearly smacking Steve on the chin with his head as he straightened. "What could possibly be more important—?"
"And don't forget that you'll be gone too for a while," Gwen added. "So I think it'll go faster than we think."
"Shut up, Ned!" Peter hissed, wincing as a group of upperclassmen glanced their way as they walked by. "No one's supposed to know that Uncle Bucky's as old as Papa!"
"No, it's okay," Steve said. "You and Peter are more alike than either of you realise, and that includes both the good and some of the more frustrating traits." His full lips curled into a smirk, that little half-smile that he reserved only for Tony. "It's endearing most of the time."
"As Captain Rogers so studiously noticed, this engine bell here is in fact a rocket booster that's designed for extra-atmospheric flight, otherwise known as space travel. As such, the aircraft itself has also been equipped with brand-new inertial dampening technology that will allow the pilot to manoeuvre easily through the vacuum of space without experiencing the massive G-forces that would otherwise cause him or her to black out. Now, I'm sure all you guys are pretty antsy to test this stuff out, so Colonel Phillips has asked me to let you know that while the Air Corps currently has no concrete plans to utilise these new features for actual space travel, I have been charged with developing simulations in which each pilot will be able to participate once they have been able to demonstrate superior proficiency with the normal operations of the aircraft."
Tony pressed their foreheads together, cupping Steve's face in his hands. "You know I'm not trying to nag you, babe, 'cause you know I just don't do that. But honey, we gotta do something about this." He paused, pressing a soft kiss to Steve's forehead. "This demon of yours seems to be of the particularly vile type, and I'm starting to think that it's not one you can fight on your own."
Steve was jolted back to reality by the blaring sound of a master alarm, indicating that Bucky had missed his go/no-point and was now sailing off into open space.
A wide smile stretched across Peter's round face, one that Tony couldn't help but return. He could never resist one of his son's smiles.
Joseph instinctively grinned behind his oxygen mask, his eyes flicking back to the photograph of Sarah, her hands resting on top of her rounded belly. As a matter of fact, after going back and forth about it for pretty much the entire eight months of her pregnancy, he and Sarah had finally settled on their two name possibilities just the previous night.
“That was pretty impressive, Peter,” he says.  “You have a very natural stroke pattern, and I can tell you took your swimming lessons seriously.  Would you mind showing me the butterfly stroke now, please?  Down and back?”
To Steve's relief, Phillips only nodded as he sat down on a corner of his desk, suddenly looking much older.
"No one'll know the difference, hon," Tony whispered as Thor started one of his rants about how he was planning to rip the gauntlet from Thanos' arm by ripping off his actual arm, a manoeuvre he had insisted on practising during their most recent training sessions.
"I'll pick the two of you up at ten after midnight, all right?" Mr Stacy said, giving Gwen a quick peck on the cheek. "Have fun!"
There were a few caveats.  Taking Sam’s suggestion that maybe he didn't need to work every single hour the store was open—and Tony’s vehement agreement to that suggestion—Steve and Tony had asked the young lady who’d been covering for him, Andrea, if she would like to become a permanent employee.  She had responded with such an enthusiastic ‘yes’ that Tony had immediately told her she could transfer to the store while still retaining her usual Stark Industries salary, which was far more money than Steve could ever afford to pay her.  Andrea and Steve had already worked out a rotating schedule which would not only give him every other weekend off, but also allow him to take an actual vacation in a couple of weeks’ time, down to Delacroix, Louisiana for Sam and Bucky’s wedding reception.
"I think we need to head down to Wakanda," he said. "We need to warn King T'Challa and his people of what's coming."
The cat stared at Tony for several seconds, tilting her head like she was contemplating whether he was worthy or something.  Then she walked back and forth across the doorway three times before heading back towards the back where she’d come from, pausing once to look back at Tony over her shoulder.
Steve nodded, his back ramrod straight and his jaw clenched so tightly that it was throbbing as he watched Thanos yank the stone out from deep within the soil, shaking it free of dirt before holding it up to the sun, as if he were admiring it.
“Yeah,” Steve said softly.  In addition to all of the evidence they had uncovered of Stane’s collusion with Hammer Industries and their supplying of the Sokovian insurgents with weapons, Colonel Rhodes had also provided proof that the Army’s very own Deputy Chief of Staff had provided intelligence on the troop movements of the U.S. Special Forces teams to those very same insurgents, painting targets on their backs that were just too good to ignore.
"Tony," he said, as he touched his husband's cheek. "Sweetheart, maybe you shouldn't be watching this. You don't need to—"
be fine. We'll drop him off at the party and then we can go sit at a Starbucks or something and wait till it's time to pick him up."
"I know," Steve groaned against him. "I know 'cause I can feel you. I can feel you all around me." Steve's words were choked, which meant he was getting close. "You feel so good, Tony. So incredibly good, I can't—I can't—"
"More," Steve said as he wove his fingers through Tony's hair, his wedding ring pressing into Tony's scalp. "Please, mo grá, I need—"
Tony breathed as Steve carefully worked him open, going from one finger to two as he pressed kisses to every available bit of flesh he could reach. "Steve, baby, I'm ready. Please, please, please, please, please—"
"Thanks," murmured Gwen. She elbowed him playfully in the side as they made their way towards the exit. "So, who's picking you up tonight?"
"Christ, babe, what the hell happened to you?" Tony demanded, his face etched in concern. "You look like you just took a nap on the surface of the sun!"
"Yeah, I can understand that," Peter said, breathing a slight sigh of relief as he finally was able to open his locker. There was no way in hell his dads would ever allow him to go overseas by himself at age sixteen. "I'm sure there'd be a dorm or something they could put you up in though, isn't there?"
Steve’s about halfway through writing his third workout when it suddenly hits him.  While Peter may already know the fundamentals of the four strokes, he would probably still benefit from having Steve in the water with him to demonstrate certain things, such as how best to push off from the wall and how to time his strokes to ensure that he touches the wall with outstretched arms.  Most of the coaches Steve had when he was a beginner taught like that, and Peter deserves nothing less than the best.
“February 9th, 2019,” Steve suddenly said.  “My team is sent into Sokovia for the fifth time.  Our mission objective: to hunt down the source of the black-market weapons being used to arm the radical insurgents hell-bent on destroying the country’s legitimate government.”
Tony tilted his head, his brown eyes softening in the soft nighttime lights of his lab as he reached for Steve's hand.
"I wish you could, honey," Tony cut in. "But since Damage Control is a government operation and you're not an official part of it, the Armed Forces Committee probably wouldn't accept the help even if they wanted to."
Tony watched as Steve paused in mid-chew, glancing furtively in his direction while Thor stuffed at least half a taco into his mouth and reached for another.
"We miss you too, bud, and we'll keep ya updated no matter what," said Dad. "Get some sleep now, yeah? You look tired."
Gamora suddenly shrieked, causing both Steve and Alt-Steve to jump so high they nearly hit the stratosphere. Because it wasn't Peter who had just stepped through the circle. Or at least, not his—
Stepping inside, Peter immediately glanced up, his eyes going wide at the sheer number of books crammed into what appeared to be a no larger than ten-metre by ten-metre space.  Towers of shelves stuffed with books stretched from the impeccably carpeted floor to about a half a metre below the ceiling, with each aisle marked with a hand-drawn sign indicating the genre and the author’s last names, arranged in alphabetical order.  As soon as the door closed behind him, Peter halted, closing his eyes as he drew in a slow, deep breath.  He had always loved the smell of books, and the entire place seemed to be saturated in it.
“I know, and I will. Thanks.” They sat in easy silence for a few minutes, all eating food now before Tony spoke up.
Steve thought about it, and realized they were right. Steve didn’t really do much with Tony outside of team stuff, so how was he supposed to get Tony to think of him as more?
“I guess I’ll just take a break,” She said, though she still seemed reluctant to the idea. Tony smile though, and pulled her into a hug, kissing her on top of her head.
“If you think it’s supposed to be Thor’s hammer then yes. The cookies are an assortment of holiday themes and Avengers symbols.”
“How are we going to decorate all of these cookies?” Tony said, looking around the kitchen. He and Steve had been working over the past two days to make a ton of cookies and had easily made several hundred cookies.
Steve and Tony both sighed, unsure of the answer they just received. It didn’t go unnoticed by Peter though.
“Isabel, please.” Finally, she turned to look at him again. He smiled at her, a warm one, trying to convey that he wasn’t the enemy here, and he wasn’t trying to just be mean.
“A bit of sleep and a couple cups of coffee. Not very specific, but I’m willing to bet that it actually means that you’ve had more cups of coffee than actual hours of sleep in that time span.” Tony said casually, doing his best to not sound accusatory. Isabel shrugged.
Tony looked shocked, not saying anything the entire speech, and just staring at Steve. Without saying anything, Tony nodded his head, tears starting to fall a bit.
“Yes, but you admitted it was just being rebellious and nothing more. And just like every teen does that, every dumb one that gets caught gets punished.”
He discussed with Sam how he should do it, who said Steve just needed to go and ask him. No huge grand gestures were needed, just a nice, straight to the point 'will you go on a date with me?’
“FRIDAY, can you tell everyone who’s in the tower to come to the kitchen, please? They need to help us decorate cookies.” Steve asked as he pulled out multiple bowls to put different colored icings in.
“Thanks, Pops, but we really have a lot we still need to do,” Peter said, and Tony was the one to respond.
“I doubt it. Rhodey was with them till this morning, and it’s barely 1pm. They’re probably not even out of bed.”
“I know a loop that is about five miles and ends with that fancy ice cream place two blocks away that you really like.”
Tony smiled, handing Peter to Steve, before wrapping both of them in a hug, to which Steve quickly reciprocated.
It was one of the only ones that Steve had actually seen, as it was one of the only ones Tony had in front of the entire team. He wasn’t sure if he was glad that he didn’t see the majority of them, or if he was hurt by it. It’s not that he wanted to see Tony in pain, but it was starting to feel like he was avoiding Steve. They were on good terms before the incident and were close. Steve was even starting to develop feelings for the genius, not that he would ever admit it.
“Meeting with Evans. Got some last little details to go over before he sells us his company. Shouldn’t be more than a few hours,” Tony reassures him, but Steve was not having it.
Steve’s words seemed to fall on deaf ears, as Tony was now fighting to break loose of Steve’s grip, so Steve let go, letting Tony curl into a hyperventilating, shaking ball. Steve ran his hand up and down Tony’s back, giving him encouraging words when JARVIS spoke up.
“It’ll probably help you feel better,” Steve mentioned when he saw Peter hesitate. After a contemplative pause, he nodded his head, and Steve pushed his plate over to Peter.
Steve sighed, unsure of the answer, but before he had the chance to speak, both saw Peter enter the kitchen, looking like he just rolled out of bed.
And that stopped Steve. Tony, loved him? What? Since when? Steve quickly snapped back to reality, going back to trying to get Tony calmed down.
"When you brought me your bike. I noticed you leaving the lights on on purpose, but didn't really connect all the dots until you asked me to go on a ride with you."
Then, the rumors started to fly. Since the media found out about Peter before Steve and Tony made any type of announcement about it, there were a lot of suspicions about how Peter came to be. The most common one was that Tony had had an affair and that Peter was the resulting consequences of his actions. Another popular one was that the boy’s family had been killed by the Avengers, and the superheroes felt guilty about it and took him in. They had heard everything from kidnapping to secret SHIELD experiment to alien baby. The last one was Tony’s personal favorite.
“Okay, I’ll go check on him and then be right back.” Tony said, “Make sure you don’t make too much of a mess without us.”
“Exactly. And we can do stuff with the team as well. Some stuff can be just the two of us, but I think everyone on the team could use a little extra holiday cheer this year.” Tony smiled again, bigger this time, as he leaned in to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek.
"Definitely. This could feed at least five people - probably more - but I want leftovers, so it's okay.”
“Y-Yes. Yes, absolutely yes.” Tony said softly, shaking, as he leaned down, the ring still in the box in his hand, to hug Steve. Steve laughed, hugging Tony back as he also tried to fight the tears from falling down his face. They sat there for a few minutes, both crying and laughing and hugging, before Tony pulled back, handing Steve back the ring. For a second Steve looked panic, but Tony quickly spoke.
“Hey!” Tony scolded playfully, “Watch the language in front of the baby. I’m pretty sure we don’t want his first word being a special four letter one.”
“Peter agrees. Your possessiveness is getting to be a problem.” Tony turned to Steve, saying it in a mock serious voice, to which Steve reciprocated in rolling his eyes.
“They’re not going to be young forever!” Tony would always say, “Steve and I will have plenty of time to be alone together once they’re older.”
“See! You already know the basics. I told you it would be fine.” Tony pulled Steve into him again, wrapping him in a hug with a peck on the lips.
Ever since Peter was adopted, the media was worse than they had ever been before. Steve and Tony had kept quiet about everything during the entire adoption process, fearful that it would fall through at the last second for a dumb reason, so outside of Pepper, the adoption agency, and the boy’s aunt, no one knew what the couple was up too. While the team was not thrilled with being kept in the dark, they understood Steve and Tony’s reasonings. The media, however, was not as forgiving about the surprise of finding out that there was a 6-month-old being in the care of the superhero’d power couple.
“Well, why not?” Steve said, getting a little defensive. “He knows we’re married, but that never seems to stop him from hitting on you at every opportunity. Maybe having me around will actually make him think twice about it.”
“Hey babe, I think we missed a present,” Steve said, stepping away from the tree to try and make sure Tony was the closer one.
“Yes. That’s what we talked about when all of this first started. Just sex. No feelings or anything like that. And last night definitely fell into the latter category.”
“Sure. The kids would absolutely hate it if we took them.” Tony grinned, causing Steve to roll his eyes.
Steve knew it had been a rough couple of weeks for Tony. No one could deny that, and while he knew that it wasn’t his fault, Steve couldn’t help but feel like it was.
“I guess I should have talked to you about it instead of just letting that fester,” Tony said, finally willing to make eye contact with Steve, who just shrugged.
“Put the book down for a few minutes and look and talk to me, or I’m taking the book and you’ll get it back tomorrow.” At the threat, Isabel finally looked at him. It was the first good look he got at her face, and it made him realize how worn out she actually was.
“Did I do something? To make you not want to do this anymore? Or make you think I didn’t want it anymore?”
"A break?" Steve had been hoping to try and convince Tony to watch a movie tonight as well, though that might have included the rest of the team once they got back.
It had been two months since Peter was adopted, and six weeks since the media circus had started. They had relented a little, but not nearly as much as they had hoped. There was still a huge crowd of reporters at the front of the building. Tony was entering the kitchen, where Steve was feeding Peter breakfast, looking to get a cup of coffee before a meeting with Evans, the owner of the company that is being bought.
“Why were you curious at all? Have you drank or gotten high before?” Steve asked, not liking what he had just heard. Peter shrank a bit in his seat.
“Not enough,” Isabel mumbled, having pulled the pen out of her mouth to write a note in the book, before returning to her original position.
"I think there's just something wrong with the battery. Have you not ridden it enough?" Tony asked, and Steve shrugged - choosing not to mention that he had actively not ridden it for over a week - except to make sure his lights were never turned off to make sure the battery died.
“Finish your dinner babe. I still got a little extra surprise for you after.” Steve raised his eyebrows in question, but didn’t press on when Tony shook his head, refusing to say anything more. They talked and cuddled more as they finished dinner, looking out on to the frozen pond, looking at the ways the trees hung over it and the pine needles fell on the ice. Eventually, after checking his watch a number of times, Tony pulled Steve up and pulled him over to the pond.
“I’m sorry I made you guys ever worry about that. But no, I promise, I’m not trying to kill myself. Just stupid teenage rebellion. Well, maybe not that stupid because the exact reason we did it here was in case something went wrong because I do know there are always risks when using drugs and drinking. I know with Spiderman and stuff it’s a little different, but it’s just that. Everyone does it.  I’m just, not a little kid anymore,” Peter explained. Tony went back to combing his hand through Peter’s hand.
“What should I do? I’m terrible at talking to people, especially Tony. I just get nervous every time I see him.”
Tony could tell Steve was trying to catch his eyes, but he was feeling petulant and refused to look at them.
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” Tony said, guiding his son to sit down at the table, “Why don’t you eat some breakfast.”
“You’re going to let them leave once they’re adults?” Natasha would always ask, which earned her a glare and a mumbled response about them not needing to move out when there is so much room in the tower already.
“Like I got hit by a bus. Repeatedly,” the teenager mumbled, leaning in a bit to his father's touch.
"I- uuuhhhh- what?" Steve was sure his fair skin was now bright red from embarrassment as he attempted to hide the picture, but Tony stopped him, pulling the pad of paper out of Steve's hand. As horrified Steve was, all he could do was stare at Tony in shock while Tony continued to examine the picture. The only thing that could have made it worse wa-
“I know. It just feels like it sometimes. I don’ want to share my family. I don’t think the constant hounding of reporters and rumors flying everywhere are helping either though.”
Steve wanted to cry. He knew he would be hurting Tony by doing this, but if it meant Tony not dying, he didn’t really see what other choices he had.
Much to people's surprise, Steve preferred the future over the past. He didn't really understand why people assumed that it was the latter, except maybe nostalgia. Sure, Steve missed some of the people - and getting used to the 21st century took some time- but it really was better than what he used to have.
“Well,” Tony spoke up after some time had passed, “we still need to answer my original question. What are we going to do about it?”
"Are you sure there's enough food?" Steve asked, looking at all the ingredients spread across the counter. He hadn't eaten sushi many times before, so he wasn't sure how much they actually needed.
“Then you better just come with me now, and then I won’t know how little sleep you got and make you start catching up right away.” Isabel sighed, knowing he wasn’t going to budge on this. He watched as she thought for a minute, before finally speaking up.
Steve had done some research to figure out a "problem" with his bike, and asked Tony to give it a look.
"That's actually really cute. Like in grade school when you passed a note to your crush. Oh, and the other condition is that I'm keeping this." Tony said, pointing at the picture.
Steve's next attempt at getting Tony's attention was admittedly, much better than the first, though required a bit more manipulation.
Steve realized his mistake when Tony brought up sparring. He didn't mean it as a team thing, he meant it as a way to spend time with Tony and show-off.
4 years. It’ll be 4 years in February. And the first one we were called on to Avengers stuff, so that doesn’t really count, the second one you were in the hospital, and last year-” Steve hesitated at that one. They were together in New York during last Christmas, but the holidays were a mere afterthought as they were still working on repairing their relationship after The Accords. “I just want to go all out this year. It’ll be nice to be able to focus on the fun of the holidays for once.”
“What? Is there something else?” Peter wondered. Steve and Tony looked at each other as if having their own silent conversation before Steve spoke up again.
“It’s amazing babe,” Steve said, taking Tony’s hand to guide them to sit down. They cuddled into each other, kissing a little as they sat down, though it quickly changed to eating the food in front of them.
“Tony I promise, I was not flirting with Sam. And whatever I did to make you think I was, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it.”
“Hey, dad. Pops. How was the trip?” Matt asked, leaning against the wall, arms crossed and a tight smile.
Steve, on the other hand, was not doing as well as his husband. Everyone always seemed to want a piece of his husband and his child, and he was not happy about it. Whether it was everyone wanting to meet and play with the new baby, or someone needing Tony for SI stuff or whatever, it seemed like he could never spend time with just his husband and their son, and it was wearing on him. Steve was snippier with people and did whatever he could to make sure Tony and Peter were either in the Tower or with him, though he preferred for both to be true.
“Even if it were, you’d be a bit of a hypocrite for getting mad at me about it,” Isabel said, crossing her arms and doing her best to avoid eye contact with Tony.
“That was weird,” Tony commented, bringing two large trash bags out to start putting the paper into.
Both stared at each other in silence, Tony trying to deep breathe to calm himself. He didn’t want to push Steve away. He wanted to be with Steve, but so much information was being thrown at Tony, it was taking him a little while to process. Steve eventually got up from the couch and walked closer to wear Tony was, and grabbed both of his hands.
“Are you going to give me a hint about where we’re going for dinner?” Steve asked as Tony drove them.
"It's really no problem. I like helping my friends out. You can even wait in here if you want while I do it."
After a few minutes of silence, Tony finally spoke, though his voice sounded like it was about to crack.
“Not that you need it, because you’re probably a lot more prepared than you realize, but yes. I will absolutely help you in any way you need. Though you will still be going to sleep at a reasonable time tonight.” After another moment, Isabel let her shoulders slump but got out of her chair.
That wasn’t really important at the moment though. What was important was that he was staring at a sleeping Steve after having spent the night. In and of itself, having spent the night with Steve wasn’t a bad thing. They were friends with benefits after all. The issue was, that they hadn’t even had sex last night.
“I still don’t get why you want to go get a Christmas tree. We don’t even have any ornaments to put on it.”
Steve had convinced everyone in the tower to "coincidentally" be out the one night Steve decided to cook, so that he would be able to spend some time alone with Tony. Once Sam left, and he checked that everything was set, Steve went on the hunt to go and find Tony. As Steve expected, Tony was in his lab, but it didn't take long for Steve to realize that he was on the phone - and it didn’t sound like a very pleasant conversation.
“I-I’m fine…. I just- I just wanna be alone…. Just for- for now.” Tony pulled himself into a tighter ball as he spoke, wrapping himself more securely in the blankets. Steve nodded, placing a kiss on Tony’s forehead.
“Tony, stop thrashing, please,” Steve pleaded, trying to get Tony’s wrists pinned with one hand, so he could take out the arc reactor with the other, but Tony was relentless.
“Think about it like a mission. The end-goal is to go out with Tony, but you gotta do recon and build rapport before that.”
But Tony seemed to be getting better. He was tired a lot, sure, but he wasn’t holing up in the lab or his room with Bruce and Nat anymore. He didn’t seem as jumpy in general and was able to feel a panic attack coming, and would leave and do his breathing exercises to get him through them, and then come back and join the group as best he could. He was even starting to go back to some of his bad habits again, even though everyone always tried to stop him. And he was starting to talk to Steve again, which was what made Steve the happiest. Tony just made Steve happy.
“Got a bit too caught up in the sex part I guess,” Tony said, which made Steve start to laugh. At first Tony didn’t mind, but he started to get a little offended when Steve kept going.
“It’s just that everyone seems to want a piece of my family all the time,” Steve confessed. “The media wants pictures of Peter or friends want to play with him; People want interviews with you and forget that you’re married and think it’s okay to flirt with you like you’re not. You guys are my family, not there’s. I don’t like feeling like I always have to share you guys.”
“Hey sweetheart,” Steve said softly as he walked over to Tony. He placed the toast and water on the bedside table and crouched down next to his boyfriend.
"Hm?" Steve tried to come off as confused as she and Bruce walked into the room, which Steve now realized was empty, except for himself.
As Tony’s breathing started to turn normal, and he wasn’t shaking anymore, Steve slowly let go of him, giving Tony the freedom to sit up and look at Steve face to face as equals, instead of underneath him.
“Fine. But can we at least put some clothes on first. I don’t really want to have this conversation when we’re only in our boxers.”
“He’s never going to see you as more if you do nothing except stare at him all the time. You have to put yourself out there so he notices you as more than just a teammate.”
“Yeah, I don’t want to risk a manic or depressive episode during AP’s, so I’ve been making sure to eat and sleep and take breaks.” Even as he said that though Tony could see the bags under his eyes, and the energy he usually held was gone. Steve stepped closer as well, carding his hand through his son’s hair.
Tony nodded as he finally pulled his hand away from Steve, pulling it into his chest, wondering if that was going to be the last affectionate touch he’d get from Steve. He watched as Steve turned away and went to go put on clothes, and then quickly exited when Tony realized that it was a little weird to watch the person you were essentially breaking up with, get changed one last time.
Obviously, I am taller than him. I know that I am better than him. I am obviously stronger than him. Why is there no good girl to look at me? This stupid boy has to take off the bill first, and has a child? Later, it’s a real busy man. .
"I think my parents, I never thought I would miss my father, but now I find that I actually love him, just like he loves me silently."
"Hey, you are stingy, I can't eat him anymore." Steve puts the child in Howard's arms: "Hey, raise the child, but don't raise fat!"
The loss in Steve's eyes passed by. He stared at the floor and didn't dare to look at Tony. He moved a little outward and was afraid that Tony thought it was too sticky and resentful.
Steve grinned and walked up to Tony in two steps, took the coffee on the table, picked up Tony and went to the room.
Howard had asked this question a long time ago, and Steve was untimely thinking. But he did not think about such a problem at that time, and did not know how to answer it. But now I understand my own mind, but I can't answer.
Steve touched his head very gently, pinched his face and held the man on his lap: "What happened to come over to me?"
As it was, they had spent most of the night doing anything but sleeping, both trying to take the other's mind off of what was coming. Tony knew it was probably hypocritical of both he and Steve to use sex to distract themselves, but at the time neither of them cared. Any sleep they'd managed to get had been fleeting and plagued by nightmares, so after a while they just decided to hell with it and took turns pleasuring each other until they dozed off, only to wake and start all over again.
The Avengers were supposed to fight the battles that regular people couldn't, and since Peter was in no way a regular person, that meant he had an obligation to help.
"Steve, we're getting back into the what-if territory again," warned Sam. "Now correct me if I'm wrong, but usually people aren't allowed to take anything with them when they're let go from a company like this, right?"
"Oh, and like you haven't been spending most of your free time with Betty lately?" Peter shot back. "You're with her every day after school!"
"There're worse things, Петр. Стив and Тони are two really good guys, you're all damn lucky to have each other."
Peter let out a heavy sigh, his puppy-dog eyes blazing in such full force that a knot rose in Tony's throat. "Look, I'm—I'm sorry, Dad, but I just didn't want you to be all alone up here. I mean, you're mainly here anyway because of me, so…"
Next it was Steve's turn. "I'm so proud of you, Buck," he said, clapping him on the back. "That took a lot of guts."
"Yes, I guess so." Howard cleared his throat, glancing at Tony who hadn't budged a centimetre from Peter's side. "He deserves only the best, Captain Rogers, and I'm pretty sure he's found it with you. Take care of him. Take care of them both."
Stepping over Thor's sprawled-out legs, Steve made his way towards the rear of the Quinjet, shaking out his arms and rolling his head to try and stretch out the tight muscles in his neck and shoulders. Natasha looked up as he passed, giving him a quick nod from where she and Bucky were huddled together on the bigger couch, watching a movie on her tablet. It was one of Peter's Star Wars movies from the looks of it, which Peter had introduced to Bucky while Steve and Tony were on their honeymoon. That was back when Bucky could still barely look Steve in the eye—or really anyone besides Peter and Sam—and Steve smiled as he realised that Bucky was probably missing Peter now almost as much as he was.
Tony's fingers brushed across Steve's lips, his eyebrows knitting into an even deeper frown. "All right, so, do you want to talk about it? 'Cause that's probably a better idea than trying to burn off your skin, don't ya think?"
"Mr Beck is still speaking to the gentleman from Human Resources, sir," said JARVIS. "However, Mr Hogan is standing by to escort Mr Beck off the premises as soon as their discussion is concluded."
Her words hit Peter like a blow to the chest, and he literally stumbled back a step. "Um… how—how do you think you know that? 'Cause I'm pretty sure that I've never said anything about being Spider-Man, and I
"We sure did," agreed Steve. "Wanda, Pietro, once T'Challa sounds the charge, I'm gonna need the two of you to hang back here, behind the shield line."
“Yeah, Mags,” Tony finally forces out.  He clears his throat, giving Mags what he hopes is a convincing smile.  “Thanks.”
Tony thought, his lips curling into the slightest of smiles. It was already almost eleven at night, not exactly the best time to be napping.
Intellectually, Peter realised it was only a bill, which meant that it wasn't law yet and there was still the possibility that it wouldn't get passed. And, given the massive bill in which it was hidden, there would definitely have to be at least some debate on the subject.
out of practise on his flirting techniques. He tugged on the collar of his t-shirt as he cleared his throat, very grateful that Anthony couldn't see him at the moment since his face was likely the colour of an overripe tomato.
"Peter!" Steve cried as he patted Peter's pale, clammy cheek. "No, no, no, little guy, don't do this to me again, I can't—!" He pressed his ear to Peter's chest, nearly collapsing in relief when he heard the sound of his heartbeat and air moving through his lungs.
"I think she did," answered Steve, his cheeks flushing hot. "She never said as much, but she was almost as perceptive as Peter, so… I'd be shocked if she hadn't at least suspected it was the case. And to her credit, she never told me that I needed to find a gal to settle down with. Oh, she encouraged me to go out, especially on double-dates with Bucky, but… she never wondered why those dates never went anywhere." He picked up Tony's hand, tracing his fingertips along the lines of his palm. "And I know she would've loved Peter too. Unconditionally."
"Well, I guess they've gotta keep staying ahead of the curve," Steve replied as he sealed his canopy closed, patting it for good measure. "Besides, it's not like they're getting retired or anything. They'll still be in use."
"Aww, man, I actually know that!" Peter hissed as poor Cindy's eyes went wide and she gulped. "Papa's a huge baseball fan, and he's always telling us stuff like this whenever we go to a game. Dad just listens politely 'cause he doesn't really care all that much, but it's really cool if you think about it. The fastball is pretty self-explanatory, just designed to get there as quickly as possible, so the batter actually has to decide that he's gonna swing almost before the ball even leaves the pitcher's hand, but the curveball—"
Peter thought, hoping against hope that it was just some sort of weird movie magic with the theatre when another freezing bolt shot down his back. He sat bolt upright in his chair, knocking Gwen's head off his shoulder as he whipped around to see Uncle Bucky already on his feet, heading towards them.
“What, Steve?  What?” Tony asks, just as hoarsely and pained as Steve.  “Got some famous last words you want me to transcribe for you?  I s’pose my handwriting is decent enough.”
"Good afternoon, Colonel," Tony said, barely concealing his smirk when Phillips snapped awake, glowering in Tony's direction. "From the sounds of it everything's been going fine up there."
And what a restful break it was. Aside from his wonderful vacation to Ireland with Tony and Peter, Clint and Natasha had spent a month out in Indiana with his sister-in-law and her family along with the Maximoffs, while Sam and Bucky ended up with season tickets to the Mets, inviting George Stacy to join them whenever he was available.
Tony groaned. Fixing the dumb ship had already taken a lot longer than he'd thought it would, and the thought of waiting yet another ten hours only to find out that there was still more to fix disturbed him in ways he had no desire to admit. But if getting the tesseract off of Earth was as important as Thor said it was, then he really had no other choice in the matter.
Tony glanced back at Steve, his heart swelling at the look of pure elation in his glassy blue eyes. He still had Peter in his arms, tucked adorably against his chest with his fists clutching handfuls of Steve's shirt, just like he always did with Tony when he was a baby.
"Okay, so, you know you don't have to worry about scaring me, right?" Gwen cut in. "My dad's a police chief, Peter, and I've already lived through a bunch of the same stuff that you have, so… I doubt whatever you saw down there is much different."
"You're right," Steve said as he pecked Tony on the nose. "Don't really want him to start gnawing on the furniture, I don't think it'd taste very good."
"Well…" Peter said, attempting a smile. He didn't add that one of the biggest reasons why he and Papa hadn't gone with Dad was because New Asgard was located just a bit too close to where Papa had been frozen for so many years, and Dad hadn't wanted him awakening that particular demon at the moment, a decision that Papa eventually came to agree with. Papa's current demon-fighting repertoire was already busy enough, so that one was just going to have to wait its turn.
As it was, there was probably enough Kevlar in the uniform he was currently wearing to almost classify it as armour, but Steve wasn't about to say anything. Aside from the images of the devastating space battle that Tony often saw in his nightmares, Steve knew that the memories of his condition once the team found him in the hidden HYDRA bunker were a very close second. Right up there with Peter as he lay comatose in his hospital bed after the battle down in Miami.
"Tony," Steve said as he reached for his husband, gently but firmly removing his hands from the man as his twitching grew worse and he started gasping for breath. "Bruce, what's wrong with him?"
As they flew directly over the rippling area Steve began to squirm, trying to escape Tony's vice-like grip. But Tony held him tight, refusing to budge.
And now, Peter not only was able to see Dad and Papa every single night for pretty much as long as he wanted, he also had Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam spending most of the days with him along with his papa's ma, who just the night before had asked him to call her Grandma.
movie he watched with Peter not too long after the Battle of New York, when the heroes were attacking the space station through a barrage of cannon fire.
"Yeah, probably," Peter cut in. "Let me double-check with Gwen first, okay? Hopefully she'll be back at school tomorrow." Gwen's little brothers had been passing a respiratory bug back and forth for about the last month or so, and she had finally succumbed to it the day before. Peter had asked JARVIS to send some chicken soup and a bouquet of tulips to her house before he'd left for school that morning, and he could still feel the flush on his neck from the thank-you text she'd sent him once they'd arrived.
Peter gulped, remembering the hopeful look on Gwen's face when she told him about the dance. "Um… the school is gonna hold a kind of a prom for the underclassmen, it's the night before the regular prom, the first Friday in June, and I was—Gwen and I, we were hoping that—that we could go. So, you think we could go?"
"Sweetheart," he said as he curled his arms around Tony's waist. "I don't know how else to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. I need you to tell me what's going on with you, and that means everything, okay? Even the stuff that you don't like talking about."
Quill's eyes went wide as he held up his hands. "Well, actually, I don't even have a son, so there's really no way that you could—"
Tony breathed in, his face impassive even as his eyes turned glassy. "That's—that's good, Steve. That's really, really good, 'cause… damn, honey, I don't think I could've watched too much more of that, and not—"
Peter's deep frown was tempered only by Natasha's use of his special nickname, one that had caused Uncle Bucky's eyebrows to shoot up in shock the first time he'd heard Auntie Nat say it. Милая ошибка meant 'sweet little bug' in Russian, but apparently it also meant 'sweet mistake', which Uncle Bucky hadn't thought was very nice until Auntie Nat explained that that was just one of the weird intricacies about the Russian language.
And it wasn't like Tony didn't agree, either. HYDRA was evil incarnate, and there was no doubt in his mind that the world would be a far, far better place once it was wiped out.
"Thank you." Steve waited until Stacy and his young partner had crossed the street before he and Tony exited the coffee shop, heading back towards the Tower.
"I'm coming!" Peter said again, sucking in a deep breath as his mask closed over his face. Then he raised his right arm, palm facing the sky, and launched a web at a nearby tall pile of debris, giving it a quick tug as it latched itself on. Lifting himself off of Titan's floor, Peter quickly launched a second web through the portal, bringing him through. He flipped in the air before landing gracefully on the Wakandan plain, his mask retracting as he saw his dads standing about three metres away, clutching each other's hands like they were the only things keeping them upright.
“You're right, Tony, you're right,” he said quietly.  “Just so long as you remember that we’re a team.  There's nothing we can’t do as long as we stick together, like your father and I.  Howard and I worked really well together, so there’s no reason why you and I can’t too.  Right?”
“Jesus, Pete, will ya keep it down a little?” Tony hisses.  “And what the hell are you yapping about?”
And as much as it devastated him to admit, Bucky was right. Peter needed to overcome the HYDRA programming on his own, and while having to witness it was going to be one of the most heart-wrenching things he ever experienced, Steve had no doubt that Peter could it.
Steve smiled, brushing another light kiss across Tony's lips. "Are you okay?" he asked. "You seem… distressed."
“You're not gonna mess up my leg, Tony,” Steve says, as firmly as he’s able.  Tipping slightly sideways, he holds up the armoured finger.  “Just give me a count to three, okay?”
Not even a second later a massive blast shook the complex just as the first Hammer suit became airborne. Tony immediately took off in the direction of the blast, and was about three metres or so away from the ceiling when the second blast hit, opening an entire spider-web of cracks in the thick concrete that looked on quick glance to be deep enough for him to break open.
At 4:55pm, Steve says goodbye to Clint and exits the office, arriving on the sublevel to find the Starks taking seats on the visitor’s bench by the pool.  His heart does a little leap as he spots Tony, who’s dressed in a tight AC/DC t-shirt with the long sleeves bunched at his elbows and a pair of black jeans that somehow make his gorgeously round ass look even perkier.
Tony smirked. "Why, honey, are you trying to insinuate that Bruce and I are smarter than a bunch of vultures—I mean… news people?"
He was cut off by the sound of approaching footsteps, and he turned to see Mrs Stacy standing in the doorway. "Dinner's ready," she said with a kind smile. "Gwen, why don't you show your friend where the bathroom is so he can wash his hands?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Ready, little guy!" Steve called. He quickly scrambled up a small pile of debris as Peter drew back his arm, jumping into the air to catch the shield just as another target crashed to the ground behind him, taken out by Wanda.
“Thank you,” Tony bites back.  He turns back to his armour without another word, his shoulders hunched so tightly they look almost painful.
“You can, Tony,” Steve says.  Gritting his teeth, he reaches for Tony’s wrist, curling his fingers around it.  “I know you can.  I've watched you tinker with plenty of stuff a lot smaller than my leg, so I know you can do it.”
There was a short pause before JARVIS continued. "I am afraid, sir, that without the procurement of the tesseract, Project Phoenix as written by Master Peter will not be successful."
Tony gave a stuttered nod. "We should get down to Wakanda as soon as possible," he said. "Soon as we make sure Pete's okay."
"Oh!" Steve said on a gasp, blinking as he watched Thor land in front of Thanos, his face filled with so much malice that he was almost unrecognisable.
And with that Steve slid his beautifully large hands underneath Tony's ass and hoisted him into his arms, carrying him up the stairs to their bed and laying him down on the lightly perfumed sheets. He crawled up next to him, hovering over him as he stripped Tony's clothes off, his eyes flicking down to Tony's already straining erection before leaning down to kiss him.
"Oh, absolutely," agreed Gwen. "In fact, I'm thinking that we need to buy a bunch, just in case everyone else wants to try some."
Gwen was openly crying now, dabbing at her eyes with the crumpled-up napkin and half-hiding her face in his shoulder. Peter was debating whether to try and extricate his hand from hers so he could put his arm around her shoulders, when he suddenly felt the all-too-familiar ice bolt race down his spine just as the floor literally started to shake beneath his shoes.
"JARVIS, can you please soundproof the room?" Steve asked as he kicked the door closed, his blue eyes already darkening in the dim, bluish light. Steve cupped Tony's cheek in his right hand as Tony's legs wrapped around his waist, his body already buzzing with electricity. He absolutely
Steve glanced over at his husband, a soft smile stretching across his lips as he reached for Tony's hand. "To each their own, I suppose."
"But he's my son too!" Steve cried as the tears finally escaped, rolling down his cheeks. "Tony, what's wrong? Don't you recognise me? I'm your husband! I love you, how can you not see that?"
"I didn't do anything. I just—I just—" Steve attempted to take a step, halting when he felt a hand curl around his arm, gently tugging him back as Bucky was loaded into the emergency vehicle, with Sam climbing in behind him. "I didn't do anything… I just—I couldn't—"
"I love you," Steve said, without missing a beat. "I love you, and I love Peter, and I'm never going to leave you. Not ever."
"Will you boys and girls be needing anything else?" the waitress asked as she stepped back, eyeing Sam up and down.
"You're all set, soldier," Tony said with a wink. "I'll see ya soon. Oh, and remember: no punching anything. Or diving out of any high-rise windows. Or any windows, for that matter. Or jumping out of any planes without a—"
"Yeah, well, maybe that should be a clue that you shouldn't anymore!" Steve wheezed, swiping the tears from his eyes as he cleared his throat. "I do appreciate it, though."
"I believe those were your words, sir, not mine," replied JARVIS. "I was merely asking a simple question. The fact that you chose to construe it into a commentary on Master Peter's tendency towards absentmindedness was not at all due to my influence."
Steve woke with a start, shivering and panting as he shot bolt upright on the bed. He gasped as he hugged his knees to his chest, glancing frantically around the room as he tried to get his bearings, his lungs screaming for air and his skin burning from the freezing cold Arctic water that he had just crashed a plane into for the second time.
Having someone with him did help, but only a little, and by morning when there still wasn't any new news and still no one who would answer his questions, Peter's patience had finally reached its breaking point.
he screamed inside his head, even as his last shred of rationality knew that it had to be.  The fake mission, the booby traps, the groaning sound mimicking the sinking
Blinking back tears, Tony pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and took the notebook, reading over the lines of code that Peter had been working on practically non-stop for the last three months.
And it wasn't until he’d managed to hoist himself up to clean up the mess that he realised that for the first time in his life, the blast of shame that usually followed his final list item for the day hadn’t occurred.  Even though he’d been taught his entire childhood that masturbating was a sin, even though he’d been told for most of his life that being attracted to men instead of women was immoral, and wrong.
Tony's expression grew serious. "I know you're not perfect, honey, but I do know that you're perfect for me, and for Pete too." He brushed his lips across Steve's forehead. "You might wanna be prepared though, 'cause I have a strong feeling that Pete's gonna launch himself at you as soon as you're close enough."
"Ah huh," Phillips said, tapping his fingers on his desk. "And it's not gonna be any more dangerous for the pilots to be carrying four satellites each instead of two?"
"Um… yeah," Peter said, clearing his throat. "Um, this afternoon Gwen asked if I wanted to come to her house for dinner sometime, she said her mom wanted to meet me. She actually asked if I could go tomorrow and I told her that I couldn't since you guys weren't home, but… would it be okay if I did?"
After getting Steve to sip some water and helping him into a pair of sweats that he found in the footlocker, Tony helped him out to the car and drove back to the Tower.  Once there, he spent the next hour helping Steve shower and shave and get dressed, ordering them both some soup and bread once Steve decided he was hungry.  Like Tony suspected, Steve hadn't drank much or eaten all weekend, and was so weak after getting cleaned up that Tony had to help him eat.
"No, I think I'll just stay here for awhile, if that's okay," she said. She patted Peter's shoulder, and Peter practically melted at her kind, gentle touch, one that reminded him a lot of Ms Sharon. Maybe staying there wouldn't be so bad after all. He was in Papa's old room, after all.
of Clint’s arrows as they fly through the dry, frigid air, each landing directly into their intended targets.
"I was… I doubt that I would've lasted another six months, honey." Tony dropped his chin to his chest, self-loathing emanating from him in waves. "The night that I got the call about Peter, I was so drunk that I thought someone was trying to pull one over on me. It wasn't until the doctor called me back for the third time that I finally realised that he wasn't actually trying to bullshit me, but even then… it wasn't until I saw Pete with my own eyes, saw his tiny little self lying there in that bassinet, that I really believed it was true."
Again, Peter shook his head, grabbing onto Steve's right arm and yanking it forward as Doctor List stepped inside the cell, a long silver syringe in his hand.
"No, you're not being stupid, you're just… afraid. And it's okay to be afraid as long as you don't let it control you. Isn't that what you and Papa tell me every night?"
Steve smiled as he watched him race out of the kitchen, rolling his shoulders to try and loosen his stress-tight muscles. It had been a long time since he'd driven Peter to school on his motorcycle. With Peter's body temp instability combined with the rather finicky spring that New York had had so far, it just hadn't been warm enough to do so until now.
"But it wasn't real, Peter!" Gwen said. She pressed her palm over his hand, tilting her head to meet his eyes. "Look at me! I'm right here!"
“Yeah, sure.  Knock yourself out,” Tony said warily.  “But I want you to let me know as soon as you find something, all right?  ‘Cause if we’ve got a glitch in the system somewhere, then—”
“Sokovia?” Peter said, his head snapping back in surprise.  “JARVIS, does this say these bullets were sent to Sokovia?”
"Yeah, okay, but can we please dispense with some of the lovey-dovey talk?" asked Carol. "'Cause I'm pretty sure that I'm either gonna puke or go into sugar shock here."
"Just give me a second, hon," he called as he socketed something into place, punctuating his words with a muffled cough. "Just gotta get this tightened, and…" He poked his head out, letting out a soft groan as he wiped a smudge of grease from his cheek. "What's going on? Is Pete okay?"
"Okay, so that's all fine and dandy," said Rocket. "But what happens if someone dies after everyone shows up? Does that mean they're really dead this time? Like, no take-backs?"
As Peter finishes his two laps, he looks up to see Dad talking with Mr Rogers, gesturing in the same animated way he uses with his rich shop customers.  As the water clears from his ears and he removes his goggles, Peter can’t help but notice that Dad’s even standing a bit different.  His shoulders are pulled back and his back is straighter, almost like he’s trying to impress Mr Rogers.
Peter stirred slightly, breathing in deeply as he opened one sleepy eye, his eyebrows furrowing in confusion as he focused in on Steve.
They had all stood by Steve and Tony during some of their darkest hours, and now they were all there to celebrate with them on one of the best days of their lives.
“But not more than you, right, bud?” he said into his son’s hair.  “Isn’t that what we all decided that one night?”
"Yeah, right, hot stuff," Tony laughed. He stole another kiss, giving Steve's ass a quick squeeze. "Love you, honey."
since aside from only maybe a handful of people, no one currently living in Langara had ever even experienced peace.
Three hours later, after navigating the snowy roads and a couple of detours, the three of them were cuddled up on the couch in their brand-new living room watching a movie, steaming hot cups of cocoa in their hands—complete with candy cane stirrers, and Steve’s heart so full he feared it might burst.
"Tony, is that really necessary?" asked Papa. "He's just a policeman, not one of D.C.'s politicians."
Holding his breath, Steve raised his hand and knocked three times on the door, stepping back when he heard Tony's approaching footsteps.
"Which means that the Triskelion mess won't be done by the time Congress is back in session," Steve finished.
"But—but—!" Steve sputtered, rapidly shaking his head. "Tony, if Smythe was really placed there at the school to stalk Peter, then why hasn't he tried something by now? He's already been there for a few weeks! And who exactly forced Principal Morita to hire him in the first place? And are we absolutely sure we can trust the FBI? I mean, they still won't give us all that much information on Toomes, and—"
"Well, we can hope, right?" Steve said as he kissed Tony's forehead. "Rest now. I'll come back once your soup's done, but call me if you need anything before then, okay? Please?"
The doctor's words reverberated inside Steve's throbbing head, and he dropped his chin to his chest, pressing his palms against his temples. He couldn't tell if the doctor didn't know about Peter's extraordinary genetic makeup or if he was just not mentioning it, but in that moment nothing terrified Steve more than the thought of Peter sitting in one of these cells instead of him.
"Thank you, Colonel Phillips," he said as he glanced around the room, pausing just long enough to make a quick eye contact with Carol before turning his attention to his slide.
"Ah, my HUD's registering eight, plus the two reserve built into each of my gauntlets," answered Rhodey. "You think that's gonna be enough?"
As long as that went okay, Steve was then going to get down on one knee and ask Tony to be his husband.  He’d had the ring ready for weeks now, one that he had personally designed and commissioned from a jeweller recommended by JARVIS.
Steve breathed in, deliberately lowering his shoulders. "Carol and I will be up there for over two days deploying the satellites. Once we're done and everything's activated, we'll reenter the atmosphere and report immediately to the hangar to wait for Colonel Phillips's instructions."
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree with Mr Stark on that one, Senator," said one of the senators from Oregon, Tony couldn't remember her name at the moment either. "However, Mr Stark, is there no way to make your… Iron Legion, a bit less conspicuous? While I don't agree that they are frightening, I do feel that they send a rather… aggressive message, and one that could perhaps become misinterpreted as time goes on."
"Tony? Sweetheart, are you okay?" Steve asked, obviously alarmed as he gently wiped the tears from Tony's cheeks. "Are you hurt? What happened in there?"
If it hadn't been for the four large satellites mounted underneath the rounded wings of Steve's and Carol's aircraft, Steve would have almost been convinced that it'd all been some sort of mad dream.
"Uh huh. Loads," Peter whispered as he raised his head, sniffing. "Dad, I'm—I'm sorry. About… well… all of it. I—I was just trying to—I didn't mean to cause any extra trouble, and now—"
"Connects directly with the user's hippocampus," Tony said under his breath. "Yeah, I'm not sure I'm too thrilled with this one either. JARVIS?"
"As long as you promise not to punch anything for a while, yeah?" Tony said sternly. "And for Christ's sake, Steve, I mean it."
"Yes!" Steve rasped. "Tony, we could bring Peter home, and he would barely even know he'd been gone!"
"Okay, J," he said as he ran his fingers down his goatee. "Give me an estimate of how much force this thing would be able to block, yeah?"
"Mmm," grumbled Bucky. "Not sure I like that. If we're gonna be risking our lives to get there, I'm gonna wanna know why!"
Grabbing Steve's discarded t-shirt from the night before, Tony slipped it over his head before padding over to the tiny half-bathroom to pee and brush his teeth. Next to the sink sat a brand-new toothbrush and razor still in their respective packages, just as Steve had told him, and Tony couldn't help but smile as he helped himself to some of his man's toothpaste and shaving cream as he tried to make himself at least a little more presentable before Steve came back.
As it was, Steve hadn't been able to sleep more than an hour or so at a time since the battle. What sleep he did manage to get was restless, like he was just waiting for something else horrible to happen.
"I'm—I'm scared," he said, rubbing at his nose. "And I'm so tired of being scared, but… I guess I can't seem to stop and…"
"Very good, sir," JARVIS said. "And Dr Banner reports that he and Dr Cho are about five minutes out. They are planning on transporting Captain Rogers to an Atlanta hospital once he is stabilised. Dr Cho has requested that an entire section be cordoned off for his care."
"Something's coming, and we've got—we've gotta be careful, 'cause I think something's—I think Thanos is gonna—!"
Peter had just started going over his latest editions to JARVIS's code—which included three more additional layers of encryption—when someone knocked on his door.
"Um… yeah," Peter said, stamping down the guilt welling deep inside his belly as he grabbed his jacket. "Ah… thanks."
"Stand by, Master Peter," JARVIS suddenly said from Peter's pocket, where his phone was resting. "Mr Stark and Captain Rogers are en route to your location, with an estimated arrival time of ten minutes. Are you requiring any further medical assistance?"
The corners of Tony's lips curled into a slight smile. "Eh, I'm not. Would've been upset if I'd missed a chance to ogle you in all of your mother-hen glory."
Hope was a dangerous thing, and something that Steve had never put much stock in, preferring to go on facts and plans instead.
Steve lets out a sort of morbid chuckle.  “You know, if you put half as much energy into finishing your part of that grant application we spent all of last week working on as you do trying to find me a date, we’d never have to worry about replacing worn-out equipment ever again.”
"Wow, Liz's house is nice!" Ned exclaimed from next to Peter, his jaw dropping in awe. "No wonder she likes to have parties!"
"You know I do," Steve growled as he slid his arm underneath Tony's knees, picking him up and carrying him to their bed. He crawled up over top of him, his knees pinning Tony's hips in place as he looked down into his husband's eyes, dark and lust-blown and so full of love he felt he could've drowned in them.
Quickly dismissing that thought as ridiculous, Steve pursed his lips and clicked on Howard Stark's name, bracing himself as the file began scrolling across the screen.
Which only made the fact that Steve was now missing all that much worse.  The thought of having to tell Peter that his papa was missing, maybe even presumed dead—
"Ah, nope, not too busy," Peter answered as he slid on his glasses, rubbing at his temples as he hefted himself off the bed, trying to fight off the slight headache behind his eyes.
And I also can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Well… all right," Hill said after a short pause. "Prince T'Challa is waiting for you guys over in the mobile offices that we've got set up, but I'd advise you to keep your meeting brief, and to the point. He's got quite a bit on his mind at the moment."
At least his uniform wasn't torn up. In fact, aside from a few splotches of dirt here and there, Steve's uniform hardly even looked used, much less like it usually did during a battle of this scale.
Steve shuddered as he pressed his forehead against Tony's, his thumb rubbing soft circles on Tony's cheekbone.
"That's true, but this would most likely be someone who would know what to do with the schematics," said Steve. "Someone with at least the know-how to build one of the suits."
"Look!" Sam cut in, causing Tony to whip around as Sam pointed his guns towards the sky, and the shimmering beam of golden light that was hurtling directly for the ship.
"I don't know why, honey," Tony finally whispered. He leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Steve's forehead. "I'm not sure we'll ever really know why. I do think you tend to put a bit too much pressure on yourself, and I also think you sometimes see things as pure black and white when there's usually a few shades of grey thrown in there."
“None of these people are strangers, Obadiah, and you know it,” Tony said firmly.  “And neither are the two FBI agents who’re on their way in here to arrest you.”
"Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence," Tony grumbled, shooting Rhodey a raised eyebrow. He pressed his palm to his chest, feeling the rapid flutter of his heart as he rechecked the readings on his data pad yet again.
"No, but Pete's pretty much on a whole other level," said Tony. "He's… something else." He paused, contemplating his next question. "You said the serum procedure hurt?"
"Mmm, maybe not," mumbled Tony. "But still—Steve, if you hadn't found us in that desert when you did, Pete would've been dead. And now—" He pulled back, looking down at his hands. "I kept—I kept waiting for you to show up. While Pete was—while he was in my arms, begging for me to help him, I couldn't do a single damn thing. All I could do was tell him that Papa would be there soon. That once Papa got there, he would be fine. But then—"
Peter buried his face into his polar bear, trying to ignore the fact that his glasses were pressing uncomfortably into the sides of his nose as he debated on what to do with this new information. If he showed it to his dads it would only make them even more determined to send him away, and that was the absolute last thing that he wanted. Like it or not, if things continued to progress the way that Papa feared they might, the team was going to need all the help they could get for the conflict that was sure to follow.
"I'm not sure I would use the term, 'tinker'," said Dr Strange. "But yes. I can manipulate time to my advantage when necessary."
"And in the meantime, Captain, Mr Stark," he finally said. "We're just supposed to trust that you and your… team will do the right thing?"
The ride to the pub was quiet, with Steve navigating the busy New York streets in the pickup truck that Tony had bought for him for his birthday.  Every couple minutes Steve would pat first his jacket pocket, then his left jeans pocket, making sure that the documents and ring he had so carefully tucked inside hadn't suddenly up and vanished.
"You can hold his hand if it helps you feel better," Shuri said as she quickly soaked another cloth, wrapping it around Tony's right forearm. "It will not hurt him."
He got a glimmer of satisfaction when the chairman's face paled and he let out an embarrassed cough. "Yes, well, my sincere apologies, Mr Stark. I'll definitely take that under advisement in the future."
But he wasn't about to say all that to Steve. Steve already had enough to worry about, as evidenced by the tight line of his jaw and the sorry state of his beautiful blue eyes.
"I want to touch as much of you as possible," Steve whispered as he hooked Tony's leg over his arm. He carefully pushed inside him, his lips never leaving Tony's skin until his hips were flush against Tony's ass and he let out a long, shaky breath.
"Oh Christ, Pete, I'm so sorry," Dad whispered as he drew Peter back into his arms, his armoured fingers massaging the back of Peter's neck. "Buddy, I'm sorry. I'm just so worried about Papa, and—"
"Oh, just that Major Kowalski here overheard one of the cadets spouting off his mouth this morning out near the baseball field," said John. He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Apparently he was the one who drew the short straw last night and was out there looking for sympathy. Which he didn't get, by the way."
"Yeah, yeah, just had a kind of interesting thought." Tony gave his head a quick shake, squeezing Steve's hand reassuringly. "JARVIS, has Beck been escorted out yet?"
But while he had expected to land at yet another defining event from their past, one that would hopefully give him and Tony some more clues as to where they needed to go next, he had definitely
"Do you think you can get the prince to safety?" he asked as the guard T'Challa had referred to as General Okoye rushed forward, her face twisted in worry.
"All right," he said softly, squeezing Tony's hand. "Thank you, sweetheart. I'm sure Bucky's already told you this too, but I can't tell you how much I appreciate all the work you've put into this."
"Oh, I don't know. Maybe the fact that you look like you haven't slept in about a year?" Rhodey said with a frown. "I'm sure it doesn't do Peter any good to see you like this—"
"We can see ourselves out, Mr Stark," Stacy said as he offered Tony his hand. "Thank you for your trust."
"God," he whispered as his fingers glided up the strong arms that held him close at night, across the broad, heaving chest that covered the biggest heart that Tony had ever seen, and down the textbook washboard abs that actually rippled beneath his fingertips to where his cock stood at attention, weeping slightly and simply begging for Tony's touch.
"JARVIS, is there any way you can boost Tony's firepower?" asked Bruce as he and Dr Cho pulled up next to Steve in the massive converted Suburban the team kept for local medical emergencies. Steve immediately climbed into the back where Dr Cho was waiting, laying Peter down on the stretcher.
“Mmm, I’m afraid I’m gonna have to overrule you on that one, bud,” Tony said.  “The doc said you need to make sure to eat with those painkillers that you’re on, so… how ‘bout I make you some popcorn, yeah?  You can just nibble on that while you watch a movie.”
"I think we're pretty much set out there, buddy," Tony said as Sam and Bucky entered the room, taking their seats against the back wall. He held out the MAUDE glasses, which Peter took with a trembling hand. "You still good with all this?"
"What do you mean, and what?" said Peter. "That's not it, is it? You're not gonna not see him again because of me, are you?"
Steve, who Peter seemed to emulate almost as much as he did Tony.  Peter had loved books since he learned how to read at age three, and had taught himself how to draw almost as soon as he could hold a crayon.  Tony had already lost count of how many times he’d witnessed the two of them with their heads bent together over their sketchbooks, working on whatever latest drawing had caught their fancy.  Or how many times they'd gotten into debates about books, discussing character motivations and timelines and plot holes, and other such stuff.
“Oh, swimming is such a lovely sport!” exclaimes Mags.  She slides into the booth next to Tony, folding her hands as she regards Peter.  “You must tell me more, young man.  Why no more soccer, hmm?”
"Well, you look terrified, like you've seen a ghost," Steve said. He tipped Tony's chin up, trying to meet his eyes. "Can you tell me what's got you so scared?"
And after five years of marriage—or was it still only four? The whole going-back-in-time thing still tended to mess with Tony's mind on occasion—to still have that kind of passion and hunger for each other just had to be something both very rare and very,
"Yeah, I do," Steve cut in, swearing as he swerved to avoid another missile, one that looked remarkably similar to the missiles he usually carried. "Soon as we go through all this is gonna stop. JARVIS?"
Not even Howard coming to Tony three weeks later to tell him that he was pushing him out of Stark Industries, a decision Tony still believes to this day was strongly influenced by Howard’s business partner, Obadiah the Asshole, could compare.  He should’ve known something like that was coming when Howard proceeded to shut Tony out of all of his mother’s funeral plans, giving him the lame excuse that he was “too busy with the baby” to be able to help.  At the time, Tony tried to brush it off as Howard not knowing how to grieve, combined with the guilt he must’ve felt since Tony’s mother had asked Howard to drive her that evening, but Howard had been too drunk to do so.
Plus, he figured that sometimes Papa just needed a break from being in charge all the time. While the whole 'with great power comes great responsibility' thing definitely sounded cool, in reality it was sometimes just a heck of a lot of weight on a person's shoulders. Weight that not even a super soldier should have to constantly carry.
"Whoa!" Peter breathed as a vast body of water suddenly appeared below the jet, surrounded on three sides by mountains. "This place looks awesome!"
Not one of his finer moments, Papa had said, his cheeks pink with embarrassment. Thankfully all the cuts he'd received from the glass were healed up by the next day, but Peter knew it still wasn't something that Papa enjoyed thinking about.
"You know, you can't really blame me, Anthony," Hammer said as he turned back around. "I mean, you went ahead and created a sword with untold possibilities and then tried to insist that it was only a shield, so at least I'm not a hypocrite, like you are. I built these suits to be an army, and an army they're gonna be!"
"Mr Lang owes twenty thousand, three hundred and forty-four dollars and thirty-eight cents, sir," answered JARVIS. "As of today."
Old and worn, like Peter's favourite stuffed bear that still sat on his bed back at the house. Time had not been very friendly to him.
"Not feasible!" Steve exclaimed through clenched teeth. "Our son was in a coma for months! One that we had no idea if he'd ever come out of, and now you're telling me that it wasn't
"Okay, but just… hang on a second, yeah?" Tony asked. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose with shaking fingers. "It's not that I mind you guys visiting with my son, 'cause I know he loves the company, but don't you think that someone should've asked me first?"
"Yes, so I saw," Grandma said. "But unfortunately for Joseph, even though he was a pilot as well—and a damn good one, I might add—his family wasn't in the proper social circles, so he was sort of looked down upon by most of the Air Corps elite."
“Well, okay.  I’m sure the polar bears will appreciate that, but I just wanted to ask,” Dad said.  He planted a kiss on Papa’s forehead.  “Just let me double-check a few things and we’ll be ready to roll.”
In the span of six years, Tony had gone from being a single dad who manufactured weapons and lived under the shadow of an overbearing asshole to a married superhero who was now literally attempting to save the universe.
"Ready to go?" he asked as Gwen zipped up her bag, offering her his elbow. She took it with a flourish, one that made him laugh as they exited the classroom.
Sarah smiled, a bright smile that was so like Steve's that Tony nearly did a double-take. "Tony," she said. "It's nice to meet you."
“But getting back to the important stuff,” Natasha says mischievously.  “I’m gonna guess by your reaction that you thought Stark was handsome?”
say anything like that ever again!" he rasped in Howard's face, barely restraining himself from punching the smug look right off it. "I don't give a
"Just like this," Tony rasped as he rolled his hips up against Steve's, with Steve's answering groan nearly causing him to climax right then and there. Tony knew Steve had had no intention of asking Tony to return the favour, but there was no way Tony was going to pass up a chance to see his gorgeous husband let go.
Uncle Bucky looked down at the floor, studying the tops of his shoes as his teeth worked over his bottom lip.
But not Peter. Peter he had just pulled apart, leaving him to die out there on that barren rock. And now—
"Because it's bullshit," said Tony. "Changing the relative distance between atoms messes with the Planck Scale. So, theoretically, you shouldn't even be here."
Tears pricked Tony's eyes once he heard Steve click off, but he quickly blinked them away. He didn't have time for tears now. He needed to keep gathering evidence.
Papa turned his head, his blue eyes swimming with tears as they scanned Peter’s face.  “P-Peter, I—I love you.  I love you so much, little guy, and I’m—”
"I know, Papa, and I am," Peter replied. He quickly downed the rest of his lemonade, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "Can I be excused now?"
"Yeah, he is, but I wouldn't put much past Loki," Bruce said. "I suppose it all depends on how big a mess he's caused this time."
"I still think the files should be the priority," Steve said after a short pause, thankfully sounding more like himself. "JARVIS, can you just take over the server duties for the time being?"
This Steve is filled with confidence, but still apparently humble enough to keep most of it reigned in as he and the rest of the field are introduced to the audience.  As Steve’s name is called and he waves to the crowd, Tony’s jaw drops open, his eyes scanning back and forth across those glorious shoulders and ogling the way Steve’s back muscles ripple as he slips out of his warm-up pants and tosses them onto a chair.
"Two Dr Pepper floats, please," Papa said to the waitress once they were seated. As soon as she stepped away, Papa leaned forward, his blue eyes radiating concern. "So… I was talking with Chief Stacy up at the school while we were waiting for you and Gwen, and—"
"Eh, pretty much the same old shit—I mean, nonsense," answered Tony. "Davis keeps pushing me to get rid of the Iron Legion 'cause he says it's scaring people, which is just a bunch of bullshit, and they're all still whining about the Triskelion mess not being done yet. I swear, if they would actually get their heads out of their asses every now and then and actually
Closing his eyes, Steve took several deep breaths, attempting to relax his tense muscles. Rain was still falling against the windows as he propped himself up onto his elbow and leaned over to give Tony a quick kiss on the cheek, his heart jumping into his throat when he realised that Tony's skin was so hot it nearly burned his lips.
his helmet retracting into his collar. "I've sure never seen anything like this before. Those things seemed especially nasty today."
He was brought back to reality by Gwen's fingers snapping in front of his nose. "Earth to Peter?" she said with a giggle. "Where'd you go?"
Dad shrugged. "Oh, I don't know. Papa's not really interested in trying to incorporate shrinking tech into our training repertoire, and frankly, neither am I, so—"
, so—I'm gonna make sure that we don't have to. Pete—he's already been through so much shit, and he's only a
With another hard shake of his head, Steve slotted his discombobulating thoughts into their respective compartments and threw himself into the discussion regarding Mrs Bird and her three chicks. Once again, he barely noticed the passage of time, only glancing up at the clock by chance when he noticed that it was nearly dinnertime.
Steve asked. "It's an endearment, like sweetheart. It means 'my darling'. My papa used to call my ma that a lot."
"Yeah," Tony said, a bit more sharply this time. He had absolutely no business standing there ogling a pilot while his son was in the hospital fighting for his life, no matter what shade of blue his eyes were or how broad his shoulders were or how his jaw looked like it was strong enough to cut glass.
“You know, if it weren’t for that ring on your finger, I’m pretty sure she would've asked you out,” Peter said as soon as the door had closed.
"Okay, but I'm pretty sure that's against Air Corps regulations," Tony said, gasping as Steve's fingers trailed down his stomach to curl around his leaking cock. "I might even have to lodge a complaint with your superior officer."
Sam asked. "Guardians? I swear you just sounded like you were straight out of one of Peter's movies."
Steve demanded, almost too harshly. "Why is all of this happening? I understand that we can sometimes have bad dreams, but why ones like this? And why now, all of a sudden?"
Peter shrugged his skinny shoulders. "You and Papa never seem to have problems working together, so why should they?"
"Oh, he's doing fine," Steve said, so automatically that he cringed. "Well, I should say that he's going to be fine. It might take a few more days, but… he's getting there."
"I don't doubt it," said Uncle Bucky. He pursed his lips, his eyes intently studying the board. "I wouldn't worry about your dads too much though, Петр. They know damn well what you can do, they just don't wanna admit it 'cause they think that'll mean you won't need 'em as much anymore."
"Now then, Mr Stark," Davis began. "If you don't mind, I'd like to begin with a few questions regarding the various weapons contracts that your company Stark Industries used to hold with the U.S. Military."
"Hey, Steve," she said, patting him on the shoulder. She jerked her head towards Peter, her brow furrowing into a frown as she took him in. "How's my милая ошибка doing?"
"I've cleared you to work down in Dr Banner's old laboratory," Phillips said. "Believe me, no one's gonna wanna go in there after what happened to him."
"Our?" Thanos said, looking up towards the sky in surprise just in time to watch Dad slam several stories of a destroyed building right on top of him.
"No!" Peter shrieked, causing her to whip around, her eyes wide. "No, please don't go away. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, I just…" He took a deep breath, forcing himself to smile. "My name is Peter. Peter Stark-Rogers. What's yours?"
Shuddering, Peter folded himself into Tony again, trying to make himself as small as possible. "They can't have me, Daddy. I'm not gonna be… what they're trying to make me be."
"Nah, bud, I'm not worried about Phillips. But like I said; he came by just a few minutes ago and told me that he would personally make sure that I got out of here on time tomorrow, so you make sure to dust off your party hat before I get there, okay?"
"Tony! Are you all right?" Steve cried as soon as he opened the door, because of course Steve would instantly know that he was upset. He was halfway off the bed too, as if he'd thought he was going to go looking for Tony or something.
And so was Peter. Steve had seen enough of Peter to know that he had just as much—if not more—of his father's resilience and tenacity, and Steve couldn't wait until the day when he was well enough for he and Tony to get him out of that hospital room and take him home, where they could finally be a real family.
"Probably be easier for me to find you a beer," he grumbled. "Let me go see if there's any left in the Officer's conference room, yeah?"
"Tony—!" Steve started, quickly interrupted by his husband who had been obviously thinking the exact same thing.
"I've been telling Uncle Thor about when we've gone to the baseball games," Peter said. "And then he asked if we could maybe go and see one of the hockey games, and since I'm not gonna be able to see Gwen at all while we're gone, I just thought maybe we could go…"
Peter sighed as he shoved a french fry into his mouth, shooting Gwen a grateful glance when he felt her hand squeeze his knee under the table. Gwen of course knew pretty much everything that had gone down in that Georgia prison, but so far Dad, Papa, and Pepper had been able to frame the footage they'd shared with the news stations by saying that Peter had been taken from school during the dance by HYDRA, with their intent being to use him as leverage in order to get Papa to cooperate with their sadistic plans. Peter had admittedly been pretty upset when Dad and Papa had sat him down to explain why they were going to skew the news stories, but unfortunately since he had chosen to disobey them again by not sharing what he had found with Dad, they told him that he had no say in the matter. He wasn't eighteen yet, so that meant their decisions were still law.
"No, no, honey, you know I'm joking," Tony cut in, brushing his fingers across Steve's full bottom lip. "Well, I guess I'm kinda only half-joking, but anyway, you know I don't wanna leave Pete here alone. Not now, not…
"Dad, it's fine," Peter cut in. "You don't have to worry about me." Papa, Uncle Sam, and Uncle Bucky had left for a debriefing with Director Fury up at the Compound over an hour ago, and Peter knew that Dad was already anxious to join them. Peter's dads had warned him that the debriefing might become an all-day event, and had even gone so far as to arrange for him to hang out at Gwen's house after Decathlon practise, something that Dad and Papa never did unless they had no other choice.
Steve—was missing.  Presumed to be kidnapped by HYDRA, an organisation that was supposed to be dead.
As soon as Mr Toomes was out of earshot, Peter raked his hands through his hair, trying to make some sense of what he'd just overheard.
Steve gave a sheepish shrug. "I'm sure the rest of the team won't mind having that week off. Sam's mentioned wanting to take Bucky down to New Orleans to meet his family soon, so…"
"Ah, there should be plenty of it," Grandpa said dismissively. "The military never discloses exact numbers of anything to anyone who's not one of 'em. There'll be enough."
be, and… I'm so scared that I won't be able to concentrate on completing the mission if I'm worrying about him."
Tony breathed in, his lips twitching into a smile. "It's perfect, buddy," he said softly. "When I see Colonel Phillips tomorrow I'll let him know that we can go ahead with the construction."
Not to mention the fact that he'd have to be a complete idiot to try and hurt Peter, knowing that he would immediately bring down the full wrath of the entire Avengers' team upon him.
"Tony," Steve said gently. "One of my ma's good friends cleans houses for a living. If you want, I could ask her to stop by the house in the next couple of days and check on your father for you?"
Which at the moment didn't seem like it would be anytime soon. Not surprisingly, ever since Liz's party and the disaster that followed, Dad and Papa had cracked down on Peter even more, even going so far as to station extra security guards around the school again and install new safeguards on his phone, alerting them if he so much as stepped a toe over their predetermined perimeter. At first he had been so angry with them for taking away his Spider-Man suit that he made the decision to not speak to them until they gave it back. Even though it had been destroyed beyond repair, Peter felt that as long as he still had the suit in his possession he could at least pretend that he was Spider-Man.
Unable to speak, Steve had simply kissed him, carrying him off to their bedroom a short time later so he could show him his appreciation.  Of all the gifts Tony could’ve given him, he had somehow managed to come up with the best possible choice.  Being able to get out of the city from time to time, with all of its noises and nosy people so he could enjoy things like ice skating, hiking, and other simple activities with his family sounded so wonderful to Steve that he was practically salivating just thinking about it.
Tony nodded, even as he stifled a sigh. Steve and Sam discussing the team's upcoming HYDRA raid on their run very likely meant that Steve once again managed to avoid discussing his nightmares that were steadily getting worse. Just a few nights prior, Steve even managed to completely chase Tony from the bed when he started thrashing around so badly that Tony couldn't contain him. He'd been just about ready to summon one of his suits when Steve finally managed to wake himself up, remnants of their tattered bedsheets clutched in his fists.
