Sherlock blinked at the therapist and this time didn't say
Later the boys of Baker Street celebrated the closed case over a curry at Angelo's. In the middle of the table lay a bouquet of foxgloves, daffodils, and irises, Sherlock's gift to John. Because nothing says
"Sher

Yes, well.
Because anyone, just

go away, and so John said it at the top of his little lungs to make the big dog go away.
The guy hovering near the exit, pressing at his belly? Delicate constitution, recently vomited.
Sherlock Holmes turned, he frowned at John. He knew that face, knew that face, he knew—
moan. By this point John's so completely visualising what's going on behind him that some fast-beating, butterfly-winged bit of him is giddy, flattered, and suddenly empathetically horny. He's thinking a whole range of sexy things and he's about to maybe say something when there's a knock on the door and—
"Maybe especially when they're watching."
London is no battlefield but when John Watson sees one man in a fireman's carry over another's gore-red shoulder his response is immediate: Stop the bleeding.
John stands beside him. Sherlock looks up.
"You fill my heart," said Gregory Lestrade.
The man frowns at the box of sweets on the table, as if someone else brought them.
"I'm John," John said.
"You must be Sherlock…"

"I will kill your little brother and hide his body," whispered Lestrade into his sweetie's ear, to which Mycroft Holmes replied in such ribald detail that Greg giggled like a hormone-addled schoolboy.
Sherlock Holmes squints at the little man. The little man licks his lips again.

Now face-to-face with the over-tall pretty boy, John glared up and growled, "I might even find it
This time Sherlock's waiting for it, and sure enough, John shoves him with a shoulder again, only lighter…and for longer. Eventually Sherlock says, "Did I pass?"
she told me to come talk to you." Sherlock took a deep breath…held it…held it… "Deductions! I deduce things! And I deduced that you fancy me!"
"Daddy made it this morning for your mummy and she said 'mmmm!'"
And now this stranger, on bad knees of which they must not speak, squinting far-sightedly at him and grinning a mouthful of nice teeth.
"I do want to sleep here, and I don't want to actually get up just yet," John said.
"What did you expect?" John asked, smiling over at him.
“Thank you,” he said quietly.
So deep apparently that he’d not heard John leave. When Sherlock emerged from his bedroom to make a cup of tea, he read John’s note. This did not feel good at all -- he’d wanted to speak to John and get a little more clarity on his plan for this so-called date with the woman. He grabbed his phone and called Lestrade.
He looked down at the sheet before turning to read the first page. He’d written it after some older boys had destroyed his experiment in the chemistry lab. The whole book was filled with all the bad times he’d had here. He ripped the pages out and tore them into little pieces. He pulled the other two notebooks out of his drawer and ripped those to shreds as well. He lay down on his bed and turned away from the mess and willed himself to sleep.
"Let me write out the cheque for you, dear."
"I don't know. We can figure that out when she gets here."
"Just out for a fuck then are you? Have enough friends you can't imagine making more? Well bully for you, mister, what a tender world yours must be."
"I'll impress with a lot more than that if you don't
Sherlock doesn't look up.
"Where does it hurt," he asks because, though he can see where it hurt—the man's fists are pressed against belly and chest—the asking helps a person focus on something

Until…until he does.
Sherlock recoiled. "I follow him when he's annoying, but I
But Sherlock's wrong.
The man grinned up at John and said, "I'm Sherlock."
A bunched up pair of black jeans soaked up Sherlock's come and John's crotch soaked up his moans. A couple minutes after that Sherlock's arse took care of John's needs.
Slow fingers running down a shower-damp belly, Sherlock watched a skitter of goosebumps form exactly where those fingers touched. He was fascinated by that comet trail, so he lipped then laughed when new gooseflesh tightened John's nipples into dark, pink buds.
—and the bones of the body—
Uncaring that the incoming crowd had to sluice around him, Sherlock Holmes stood in that doorway and

"I may or may not have borrowed my brother's Bentley," Sherlock Holmes replied.
So just as John's thinking he'll come back to this pub tomorrow, just about the time he's thinking he's found a comfortable place where he can settle in with a whisky and self-pity, well right about that bloody time the damn bartender leans on the bar, bends at the waist and he

say it and yet—"
Sherlock shook John's hand. Sherlock let John buy him a beer. Sherlock answered seven questions, magnanimously coped with more praise, and looked mildly stunned. John just chatted on, progressively more animated and complimentary.
"Do you like it when they watch?"
The windows got a lot foggier.
"Dear god you're already hard," John whispered.
"The mushroom."
This was when John responded on instinct. Watching Sherlock nurse (that was the only word for it) filled his mouth with moans, made him want, and so he turned onto his belly, spread his legs, and whispered "Sh-Sherlock,
Another woman and two men managed to not-quite pass through the kitchen.
Sherlock smiled. “Just give me your phone,” he said suppressing a chuckle. John smiled, handing his older model phone over and letting Sherlock punch his number into it. “There you go,” he said, handing the old phone back.
They both sat and smiled at Evangeline.
“I know, I was only teasing,” Greg said, a twinkle in his eye as he took a sip of his tea.
“Da! Da! Da!” Jackie happily slapped two blocks together as she repeated the word over and over again into the camera on Mycroft’ mobile.
“In a manner of speaking, yes,” Mycroft said, a blush marring his cheeks.
“It’s short for Jaclynn,” Mycroft continued.
A week passed by quickly, Mycroft and Greg simultaneously dancing around each other and working together seamlessly to take care of Jackie. Mycroft was shut into his office more often than not, leaving Greg with Jackie for stretches of time, something Greg wasn’t complaining about. He quickly found himself falling in love with Jackie.
Legwork. Mycroft curled his lip in distaste as he watched the video feed playing on his phone, tucked in a hidden nook in the wall. He abhorred legwork and had hoped to be done with it ages ago, but this mission was of a delicate nature and required his precision in execution. There was no sound in the hall he occupied, the sound of his breathing prominent in the dead silence. It was two twenty in the morning and the air was still with it, no life force disturbing the peace around him. The weight of his gun was a comforting presence in the hand not holding his phone, and the comm nestled in his ear provided another level of security, no matter how fragile that security may be.
“Sorry,” Liz whispered, her voice watery. “Sorry, sorry, sorry,” she started sobbing again.
“M hm.” Sherlock rested his head once more on John’s shoulder, throwing his arm around John’s waist.
John got Sherlock to hold her as he looked her over, sitting on the edge of the bed and laying her down or sitting her up as directed. Greg and Mycroft watched from the middle of the bed, both working their way through their plates.
“Please,” John said. Sherlock disappeared into the kitchen and John looked down, watching Liz’s face. In sleep, she seemed so much more peaceful and John felt sorrow over the stress that someone so young had already endured. He gently brushed back hair from her forehead, looking up when Sherlock re-entered the living room. He took his mug with a grateful smile, taking a sip before leaning forward and putting his mug on the coffee table. They sat in silence, Sherlock retreating into his mind palace and John enjoying the peace and quiet.
“Better?” he asked. Mycroft shrugged non-committedly.  “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Serving as furniture, three. Either as a chair or table.”
“John, have you thought about putting her in Muggle school or daycare?”
“Okay,” John said a while later, pulling away. “Sorry I woke you,” John said.
“Do I look like I have had contact with them?” she asked bitterly.
“Whom exactly would you want to have for company?” he asked, narrowing his eyes and trying to read Mycroft’s mind. His imagination immediately jumped to Mycroft having secret lovers that he wanted to have over, and Greg’s stomach curdled uncomfortably.
“Ah, the fancy stuff. I should’ve expected that from someone as posh as you. My apologies.”
“Pardon?” the police officer sputtered.
John and Sherlock bid the family goodnight shortly after they had finished eating and Mycroft got Jackie down for the night quickly after that. Ten o’clock found Mycroft and Greg in the sitting room, hiding chocolate eggs and wrapping little Easter presents for each child.
“It is getting to be quite late,” Mycroft commented. “For her, at any rate.”
“Alright, let’s spread the rest of these out on every available surface and then call it a night,” Greg said, kissing Mycroft on the nose.
Greg looked back down and pulled out the collar buried at the bottom of the box. It was stiff black satin to match the corset, with a delicate gold colored filigree weaving over it. It didn’t have a ring or any inscription- it was more a symbol of what Mycroft was offering.
“Do you really think this is necessary?” Sherlock asked. “It all seems a bit stupid.”
In the morning John showered and went down to make breakfast, opting for coffee instead of tea while he read the paper. After eating and enjoying his coffee, Sherlock hadn’t yet appeared so John left a note that he would see Sherlock later and he left to start his day.
“Don’t be like that,” Sherlock said. “I was just checking -- we’re partners, right? It’s just a change, isn’t it?” He stood up and put the kettle back on. “I mean . . . you don’t think things seem different already?”
"A servicing kit for his violin," he said. "Not quite as personal but I think he'll like it."
"We just worked a case, Sherlock. Unlike you, some people need actual rest and relaxation."
Sherlock threw his stick into the woods. “I’ve had enough of that sweetness,” he said. “It kind of made me feel sick. I’ll make some tea, but I think I’ll jump in the shower.” He got up and picked up the plates to carry them inside. He threw them into the bin and washed off the silverware and then took a quick shower to rinse off. He returned with two mugs.
"Oh, okay," John said. He moved through the sitting room to the stairs, climbing up to the bedroom. He walked in and looked around. It was nice -- bigger than his room now. He moved around. He didn't have much; this would be plenty of space. He came out and made his way down to the sitting room again. "It’s a nice room," he said.
John smirked and tried to squirm away.
Sherlock smiled back and then looked out the window. The taxi pulled up in front of John’s, and Sherlock quickly slipped the driver some notes before following John to his door.
"That's awfully romantic of you," John said softly. His hand, without his really thinking about it, now traced Sherlock's jaw and neck lightly.
“Rest is what you need -- the doctor said it, even Doctor Watson said it. A few days without work and he is part of your work so please, just take a break. Do you want Mother to come stay with you?”
John thought for a moment -- he hadn’t expected to stay and didn’t have any of his things. "Yeah, I will," he said eventually.
“I can tell you right now, John,” Sherlock said. “I do not always do the right thing.”
"Okay, that could work."
John smiled. "That sounds good."
"It's not going to be anywhere if you keep interrupting," John said sternly.
“All right,” Lestrade said, a bit confused. “Can I ask what you’re doing that is more important to you than a case?”
"That is unexpected," John said. He took a sip of wine.
Sherlock grabbed the box and retrieved the lock for the shed. “You can lean your shovel outside and then take it when you go,” he added as he moved to the door.
"I've regretted not saying it before you . . . left.”
John moaned softly. "I am. Just a couple times, I wondered . . ."
"Not really," he said. "What about you?"
"Yup. I don't think it matters either way," John laughed.
The first time in a long time he thought about Sherlock again was when he realised he was falling for a boy. He’d had a few girlfriends and he still found them attractive, but he found this boy attractive too and he wanted to talk about that. He didn’t know how his team would react but when he got the nerve to mention it, no one seemed to care one way or the other. John started dating his first boyfriend.
"Don't go -- what is it you think?" he asked. "What's wrong?"
“Both, I suppose,” Sherlock said. “What’s the point? I want Molly to be happy, but realistically most relationships don’t last.”
John looked over. Sherlock was staring back at him, and John knew exactly what he meant. "Oh. Oh!" He shifted on the bed. "We could . . ." he said, nodding.
John smiled. "You're heading there now? Do you mind walking with me?"
He found a book to read and lay down on the sofa, but it wasn’t long until he got bored. He got up and moved to the kitchen, looking for something to eat. Then he’d remembered they were out of bread.
“Hello, John,” Mrs Holmes said. “How’s your mother?”
"Me too. I'm glad to be home, I mean. I didn't bump my head," John said.
“Firstly, don’t say ‘we’ to mean you and him. You and I are the only ‘we’ around here,” Sherlock said. “Secondly, I wish I had waited for you.”
"You know, dated two people at once."
“No, I’m afraid I don’t have a fax or email,” Sherlock lied. “Can you put it in the post . . . or perhaps you could stop by when you’re around Baker Street again?”
John stood up and started cleaning up his tools. "It's no trouble at all."
"What you're doing is perfect," John said. His hand slid down Sherlock's chest and stomach, touching his warm skin.
“Like what?” Sherlock asked skeptically.
Sherlock snapped back awake at the noise, pushing himself up quickly. “I fell back to sleep,” he blurted out guiltily and then shook his head to get it clear. “Fine,” he said. “If you must know, I woke up, cleaned up, slept, woke up and slept again.” He gave John a smile. “Thanks for the tea,” he added as he reached over for the mug.
Sherlock turned to look at John. “She wants you,” he said.
Sherlock looked over at John to see if he was still awake. “Do you know who they’re going to see?” he whispered.
"I missed you too," John said. "I missed this."
"I think so," John said.
“Yes, I’m fine. We’re both fine, so stop being so uptight,” Sherlock said. “In fact, you’ll definitely need to lighten up to fully experience the activity I’ve come up with.” He winked at John and finished his tea.
Suddenly, Sherlock’s arm was being pulled -- it was the handsome man who was calling him a pet name. “Sorry?” he asked.
“One glass is not a habit, John,” Sherlock said. “Does that mean you don’t want one?”
"Okay. I forgot I can't go up, but I'll be quiet," he said.
“All right, John,” Sherlock said. “I’m not going to fight with you. I guess I’ll get started on the case.” He stood up and moved to his desk, grabbing  his laptop and then returned to the table. This time he sat next to John, shifting his chair close and sliding his laptop against John's plate.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he also looked forward to see what he could find. Then he remembered he also had to be looking for the man, so he glanced back at his computer to remind him of the face.
“What took you so long?” Sherlock asked, looking up.
Sherlock rolled over and said, “Yes, I do want to do it again. But I don’t want you to go out and do it with other people. Now that I know what it’s like . . . I don’t want you to. Maybe you’d like it better with a girl or with someone else, but I don’t want you to do it with anyone else.”
“It was not,” she said.
“So you admit it –- your intention is to get sex. I knew it,” Sherlock said. He took a sip of tea even though it was still too hot. “I don't know. Maybe you should have that intention with me . . . you already said I fit all your criteria. Unless you really do fancy blondes. . .”
“That wasn’t actually my task, though,” Sherlock said. “That just came to me – sometimes good ideas just come to interesting people. My original task is a little more . . . dangerous.”
“Your parents are dead?”
John shrugged. "I don't know. All I know is we started chasing a suspected murderer and the adrenaline -- I was running like I hadn't been able to in a long time. The cases gave me purpose again, something exciting like the surgeries used to."
"Your father and I are going to Paris," she said.
"Fine," Sherlock said begrudgingly. "Just like a client." He looked at her closely, up and down her body and then said, "Hold out your hand, flat in front of you, please."
“As I said, we’re two businessmen. Are you in the market for some business?”
"Why does it bother you so much?" Sherlock asked.
"But I've thought it," Sherlock said. "It was my secret."
"All right," Sherlock said and then thought for a minute. "Actually, let's order in instead. We should be here -- I mean, I'd rather stay in."
Perhaps offering to help Mrs Hudson do her shopping wasn’t the smartest idea John had had that morning. She slipped two more bags into his arms and then said, “Thanks for carrying all that.” She turned quickly and called out, “We need to stop at the kiosk before we go.”
Sherlock hummed with approval, but the shift in position meant he could no longer reach John’s cock. Instead he gripped John’s shoulder, kneading the muscle with his long fingers. John kept going, licking and softly blowing air on his nipple. The sound Sherlock made had John smiling as he moved down lower. When Sherlock realised what John was doing and his body filled with tension in anticipation. He dropped his head to watch as John moved down his body. John used his hand first, stroking Sherlock before slowly taking him into his mouth.
“Well, first off, you don’t know that, do you? Maybe it’s exactly the same except another person just happens to be there –- you don’t know for sure since you don’t know what sex is like,” Sherlock said. “Secondly, just shut up about it. I mean, you know I’m not one who is ‘into’ feelings and everything, but I have a feeling this whole conversation is quite insulting to me.”
“And why’s that?” Greg asked.
Sherlock saw John through the window. He looked even more handsome dressed in normal clothes, though Sherlock hadn’t expected the jumper. Still, very handsome, he thought as he went over to the table.
“I just don’t want you or John to be disappointed,” he said.
“What are you talking about?”
"I want to see what you're working on," John said.
“Are you making fun of me?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock had been listening, of course, but he'd kept his eyes focused on his computer. "Yes, I will go," he said without turning his head.
“The case is me, John -- just to be clear,” Sherlock said. “Are you sure?”
Sherlock opened a file. A research request. It was better than nothing, he guessed, so he got to work.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said, turning and curling around John. “You’re stubborn though – it was annoying.”
“That’s good,” Sherlock mumbled. Because it was. It felt incredibly good. He spread his legs a little.
John nodded. "Can you explain why you don't know, so I can understand?"
Harry said, "Look, I'm not staying here - I've got a room at a halfway house for the night since my train leaves early in the morning. But let me take you two out to dinner -- to thank you or celebrate or whatever. I want to, so let's . . . okay?"
“It does not,” Sherlock said. “You make weird noises,” he added, pushing on John’s arm with his foot.
"I didn't say we were married, John," Sherlock said. "I'm not sure it's what either of us thought or expected but . . . what if they're right?"
"Don't gloat," John told her, glancing over at Sherlock. "Ready?" he asked him.
“I think we’ve got a case for you,” Lestrade said. “Poison -- your specialty.”
"Well, you set it all up so you tell me," he teased.
She smiled and rolled her eyes. “You can go any time -- you’re not being held against your will,” she said. She glanced around, looking for her new husband. “I think it should be wrapping up soon -- we’re leaving for our honeymoon tonight,” she added.
"Well, we're here, it's cold, you already have your shirt off, and now I know you like them," Sherlock said. "But it was just an idea . . ."
The water was quite cold at first since their skin was hot after their walk. Sherlock walked in slowly, the water almost burning his skin. Eventually he bent down and went under the water.
Sherlock's head nodded gently but he didn't say anything. He took another sip of tea. "What are your plans now?" he asked.
He licked his lips and tried again. "Do you come here a lot? Maybe you can recommend something good?"
"Well, I mean it’s likely, isn’t it? That’s what happens when you join an Army that’s fighting somewhere.”
John headed to the surgery where he was having his interview. He walked inside and saw a lobby full of patients, and in a short row of chairs a couple people dressed up like he was. He sat down beside the woman in the middle seat, offering a polite smile before looking through his resume for something to do while he waited.
"Enough! Go upstairs," John said angrily. He started to tug her along. "Where's your phone? Have you talked to your sponsor?"
John smiled. "We need rent money," he said.
"We can go," John said. He took Sherlock's hand and tugged him through the crowd.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock said, taking a long drag on his cigarette. “Not quite cooking, but it’ll be edible.”
"Did you make something?"
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. “All right,” he said. He climbed up and then realised he should probably face away from John. He held his body up with one arm so he could reach down and hold himself.
"I don't know what you want me to think about. I liked it. I told him I did," he said. He could tell he sounded a bit defensive about it, and he didn't know why. What was she trying to make him say?
John was a bit taken aback, but he was smiling wide. "Oh, that's great. I was hoping I’d see you again as well."
"I know that," John said. "I was just saying. I mean, a lot of people aren't really listening and it’s going to make this last longer. I'm glad you yelled at him."
“What do you mean?” Sherlock said. “Before I never liked anyone but you. Did you really think that would change?”
“I’m sure it’ll be fine – we’ll be able to keep busy and everything will be fine,” Sherlock said. “I think we should stop talking about it actually. Let’s just have a normal evening, okay?”
John laughed. "Okay, no dares to take off clothes."
"Okay. Um . . . about what?" John asked over the water.
Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile. “All right,” he said. “I still don’t have any condoms,” he added.
"Alright, alright, relax," John said. "I'll see you tomorrow."
Sherlock had poured three cups and brought two of them out into the sitting room. John's face looked relieved and Sherlock felt relieved.
Sherlock smiled at his reply -- it was rather silly, but at least he was no longer bored.
When he woke, he cleaned up properly before having a shower and running a quick errand. When he returned, he lay down on his bed to read, but found his eyes struggling to stay open. He really needed to finish the chapter, but unfortunately his brain was exhausted, so he set the book down. Then he thought a bit more about John and their conversation before eventually falling back to sleep.
Sherlock looked over at John and then stood up from the table and went around to his side. He kneeled down a little, pulling him into a hug. "It'll be all right," he said. "Whatever version of her comes through that door . . . we'll deal with it."
“Then lie,” Sherlock said. “Come on, John – don’t go soft.”
Sherlock reacted to the touch and shifted a bit.
“Well, it’s just salad but I got you some biscuits and ice cream for dessert,” Sherlock said. He pulled some things out of the fridge and began mixing vegetables into a big bowl. “It’s all healthy, so don’t start nagging.”
"What are we doing with him?" Amanda asked.
"What's sore? I want to help you," John said.
"You help me, John, all the time," Sherlock said. "I probably don't say thank you enough, but I hope you know how grateful I am for you."
"Well, I know he wasn't feeding you or anything, but he took care of you in his own way. And mind you I'll be keeping an eye on the traffic through here," she added.
John took a quick shower, shaving for the first time in a few days. It felt good to come out tidy and fresh-faced. Before he came down to the sitting room again he dug through his closet for his suit. He chuckled as he put it on, leaving the jacket off and wearing the vest casually. He came down the stairs and saw the display in the kitchen. "Oh, well, good thing I dressed for the occasion," he said.
"I never forgot you. I just wanted to send a thanks to Sherlock," he said.
“I don’t know about that,” Sherlock said. “But I am impatient. I’m tired of watching all those people.” He finished his drink. “Can we go?”
John nodded. "Yeah, of course I can," he said.
He finally looked over at Sherlock who always got slightly annoyed when John wanted to rest in the middle of a case.
“We’ll see,” Sherlock said. “What did I like last night?”
“It’s not allowed,” he said. “Because of the team.”
After leaving Lestrade, John headed to the bookshop. He took his usual seat, unsure if she was here or not.
"I need to focus so I can't." John went to move around him, but the guy blocked his path a bit. John tilted his head and sighed. "I'm taken anyway. I need to go."
John looked around. "I don’t know," he said, shrugging. "I haven't bought very much since I came back."
“I won’t -- you know how I am,” Sherlock said. He pushed the stool back and stood up. “Come on, I should go wash these things.” He picked up the bucket.
He looked over. “Bring him here? Why?”
"Impressive," he smiled. "Nothing new there."
“What’s wrong?” she said. She sat straight up and looked at him. “What’s wrong with you?”
“Good,” Sherlock said. “Yes, it’s good.” He took another sip of tea. “Do you need any help with anything?”
John nodded, opening his legs a bit more. "Kiss me again . . .”
“No, we didn’t have plans,” Sherlock said. “I’m just . . . I just feel off.” He moved back to the table. “Sorry . . .”
John smiled and didn't reply as he watched the film, his body warm and comfortable.
“I thought of it last night before I went to sleep and got up early this morning to make sure we had the equipment,” Sherlock said. “I take challenges very seriously, as you know.”
“I don’t know,” he said, trying to move her away. “I don’t think we should . . .”
Sherlock could feel tension already coiling in his belly. He shifted slightly. "Let's lie down," he said, moving toward the bed.
John glanced up a bit surprised. "I was, yes. How did you know?"
“No time,” his mum said. “Dinner’s at five -- I know it’s early, but you know your grandpa . . . you can play in the shed tomorrow.”
John’s face warmed as he wrote down the details.
“John’s a doctor,” Sherlock said.
“After they’ve gone to bed,” Sherlock said. “I doubt they’d care but she might get fussy about us messing with her plants. We’ll be careful.” He handed John a bottle of water, and they headed upstairs.
Sherlock looked up. John really was handsome. His hand slid to John’s bare back, caressing the muscles there as well. His hips began to rock ever so slightly against the bed as his hand moved lower to grasp John’s arse.
“Lawrence.”
“All right then,” Sherlock said. He wasn’t sure why he was even talking to this guy, let alone acting this way. All he’d wanted to do was get in Lestrade’s good books, but now he was interacting and probably making a fool of himself like he had in the past.
Sherlock snuggled against John. "I've changed my mind about the cold," he said. "Today's been my favourite day in a long time, all because of it."
He went to the window again and watched John walk away. This was going to be interesting.
“What do you want?” John asked, looking up.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stared out the window. “Wait a minute,” he said suddenly. “Why did he call you and not me?”
"How about this Saturday?"
John nodded. "I could say the same thing."
"Embarrassed," she said, taking a sip. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock laughed. "Your poker face needs work," he said. He handed John the deck. "Shuffle again before taking them if you don't trust me."
"Alone?" John asked. "Are you going to the art gallery?"
John looked after the waitress and shook his head. "No, I don't think so," he said.
John grabbed it and hit him back with the pillow, grinning wide.
"Flatmates," Sherlock said.
“Okay,” Sherlock said again.
“It doesn’t matter . . .” Sherlock said. “Just -- don’t ever leave me.” He hadn’t let go and didn’t want to. Sherlock was oblivious to everything going on around them. “I love you,” he whispered.
Sherlock stood up and moved over to the fire. “Should we pour water on this?” he asked.
He found the website of the band from the first night and found their PR person’s name. Then he checked it against the second band. And then he went to the PR’s website, finding a list of all the bands they promoted. Then he tried to find one that was playing nearby. He got dressed and headed out.
"Oh. Did you see anything interesting?" He asked.
He closed the laptop and asked, “When do we leave?”
“I decided to let him sleep in,” she said. “We’re not in any hurry today, right?”
John stuck his tongue out and went on his own computer.
“Well, what qualities does that person have to have? Because we’re at university, John, your pool is somewhat limited,” Sherlock said.
"This is how it was in the very first dream I had about you," Sherlock said. "But when I woke up, I thought about it in other rooms and other places." He pushed himself up and pulled John's pajama bottoms down, exposing his hard cock. Sherlock leaned back down, holding it as he started to lick and suck.
“Well, I suppose that’s important,” Sherlock said. “I’ll try to keep that in mind . . . if you want to keep going.”
"Yeah," John smiled. He looked over at Sherlock and studied his profile.
Sherlock stood up. “Do I have to do everything around here?” he complained, smiling a little. Even though he didn’t have all the pieces to the case, he knew it wouldn’t be long until he did, and that relief had lightened his tension.
Once they got into the taxi, Sherlock turned. “John,” he said. “What are we going to do at your flat?”
They walked to the shop together and chatted -- John trying to get her to recommend books. She seemed to be smiling for most of the conversation. John didn't ask about a boyfriend, but he noticed she didn't mention one either. They parted ways when she went in a back door, but John felt good about their talk.
"Sacroiliac!"
so Sherlock just…leaned forward.
But not knowing isn't the same as not being sad, so even though he wasn't supposed to stop in the park on his way home John stopped. He didn't realise he was pulling the bouquet apart and he certainly didn't realise he was hitting ducks with a marksman's precision each time he chucked a flower into the water.
She's heard every single possible thing—yesterday a thief called to report a thief in the house he was robbing—and before a minute is up, help is dispatched.
think?
"Let me amend that: I'm certain you can't."
John Watson chuffs out a laugh. Yeah, it's easy to read people at these things. Then again, that's probably the point. Here men and women are stripped to their basics, artifice almost impossible to maintain as they try speed dating their way to love.
The tall, drunk man smiled benignly at the small sober man in front of him. And then the tall man held up a staying finger, as if the small man had interrupted him. "Wait. That's not right."
"You heard me."
John Watson turned from the bridge railing, blinked himself alert. A dark-haired boy stood a half dozen feet away, wringing his hands. The boy looked simultaneously murderous and terrified.
"Move!"
here."
At the sound of his bear's name Sherlock's eyes suddenly filled up and his mouth pulled down. "But she's p-p-" he tried to say but couldn't.
It takes forever.
don't even know if I'm—"
And he's over it.
Sherlock takes another chest-filling breath.
Then it was Al's turn to tickle Fate with his reply. "Well, why don't you bring him with you? Surely it can't hurt."
He blinked at Mike. Mike grinned at him. "Yeah, he's always like that."
John moves closer, their bare bodies warming the world beneath the duvet, and he wiggles his foot between Sherlock's ankles, hooking them together. He bows his head a little more and Sherlock does again what he did all those years ago, before John was deployed, he brushes his lips against the short, short hair and starts monologuing.
Unlike 'last time,' this time Sherlock Holmes slicked up good and found John Watson's arsehole on the first go. He set to friskily pounding his way toward orgasm as he read case notes over John's shoulder.
"Mike Stamford?"
Sherlock grinned. "I'm Sherlock Holmes. I'm the man who's about to make your life a lot more interesting."
Over the many, many years they will rut and fuck and love Sherlock will find himself here often, doing what he for the first time did now: flicking his tongue from the bottom of John's hole to the top. Salty? Yes. Sweet? Yes. Musky, dark, soap-scented, sweaty,
While I can't speak for what it was like in ACD-canon era, right now Montague Street is well-to-do, full of hotels and flats, and is planted dead centre of a lot of colleges, museums, and busyness. It would have been a good spot for Sherlock to fill in his "too abundant leisure time."
"What?"
That final lesson Sherlock observed that when he told John about his war service, his sister, his wound…that John welcomed the knowledge, that it somehow made him more, not less, and so Sherlock was more. For the first time and in someone else's eyes, Sherlock was

And both start over.
Sherlock turned his head to the right so he could roll his eyes undetected.
"Nose."
I've also shared below a few wee things I have learned about these items. P.S. The prices you see on the photos were as of mid-2015...
What really happened was they tussled for a good twenty seconds. There was a lot of teeth clenching and jabby fingers annoying grippy ones. Then, when he finally heard himself grunting his swears, John Watson yelled, "Fine!" and let go, and the not-really-a-driving-instructor shouted back, "Okay!" They both sat back hard with jaw muscles twitching and chests heaving and now the windows were fogged up and because Sherlock Holmes just now realised that John Watson's hair smelled really, really good and the man had very strong hands and a deep-voiced way about him when he was cursing, Sherlock sublimated a whole raft of confusing emotions by shouting, "And you failed the driving test!"
“Hey! You!”
When Sherlock pointed right at John, intoning, "—and my colleague can prove it," John
While the biscuits thing is no surprise, you'd really think that, as a medical examiner in London, I'd have seen so many murder victims that I'd be incapable of even thinking mildly mutinous thoughts much less homicidal ones, but there you go.
Maiko smiled. She knew how to fix that.
John Watson growled and ripped the form into twelve angry pieces, threw those on the floor, then said "Fuck it," and leaned toward Sherlock Holmes—who was already halfway there, mouth open.
(Next up: Regent's Park to Baker Street...how close? Common sites the boys would see?)

because they are poison too but we still eat them and do you come here a lot I was sick and now I'm getting better and mummy wanted me to have some sunshine it makes me tired do you get tired in the sun what if we ran all the way over there and back again do you like running?"
Sherlock turned his head to look at John even though the room was dark. “Do you have any guesses?”
"All right," Sherlock said, standing up. "I'll go to my room now, but if you need anything or if anything happens . . . come get me."
"It's not just sex," John said. "It's the intention behind that as well. And I don't prefer blondes . . . I just never thought of you like that. "
“That’s John,” Sherlock said, his eyes still on Lestade. “Tell me,” he repeated.
"No, I'm fine," she said. She moved around the room. "Why do you use the knife to hold your mail?"
“We would need to ask Mrs Hudson,” he said. “She’d have the final say.”
Sherlock sat back in his chair and thought for a moment. The room seemed incredibly silent for a moment. "Is it true?" he asked slowly.
"Good," Sherlock said. "Should we sleep for a little bit? Then we can get up and you can eat something."
When he emerged, his brother said, “You’ll need to see a doctor.”
Sherlock smiled. “Let’s leave that for a bit,” he said, pinching John’s arm a little. “Let’s just be us here at home for a while.”
"His brother," John explained to her, though he was still confused about what exactly Sherlock was doing.
"I . . . it’s just a bag," he said. "With my name on it." He said it without any real conviction. It was an amazing gift -- very personal and unique.
“I’d rather . . .” Sherlock said. He sat himself up properly and reached to hold John's cock again. “I’ve got condoms . . . do you have lube?”
He shifted in bed and turned to look at the empty side of the bed. Sherlock had been gone so long -- they shouldn't be apart anymore. He stood up and moved quietly down the stairs. He stopped in front of Sherlock's room and knocked softly.
John replaced his cards. Just a pair, still nothing. He didn't let it show on his face.
Sherlock slid over to her chair next to John. “Are you going to be hitting on my date all night?” he asked.
In the morning, Sherlock was up before anyone else. He went downstairs and put the kettle on, making a pot of tea. He took a mug out to the back garden where he smoked a cigarette, finishing right before his mother appeared.
A moment later Sherlock heard a knock downstairs, and Mrs Hudson’s door open and close. Then there were noises on the stairs, so he stood up and opened the flat’s door.
John walked back home and went up to his room to start packing. He was excited for the trip, but he was nervous. They had changed and he was worried the trip would be awkward -- what if they couldn't be like before? Different didn't have to mean bad but he was still nervous about it.
"I used your bed sometimes," John admitted, closing his eyes and tucking in comfortably.
Sherlock shifted, reaching for his trousers and pulling out his wallet. He retrieved the condom and threw it on the bed. “It’s new -- I just put it in there,” he said. “Just in case.”
"Ritual? What’s going on?" his mum called.
"Oh my god, are you obsessed with my body? This will complicate our new world if all you want is to get all over me."
John stood and moved to the bed with him, admiring his movements. Sherlock immediately reached John's hard cock, kissing him hard as he held a firm grip. Then he began to stroke him as his mouth moved down to John's neck. He pulled John almost on top of him and began rocking his hips against him. "It's good," he moaned, twisting his hand as he nipped against John's neck. John nodded, rolling his hips against Sherlock's.
Sherlock found himself laughing out loud. “Have you been drinking?” he asked.
He’d been seen by a doctor who’d confirmed that no bones had been broken. He’d been told to rest and had been given painkillers, which Mycroft had confiscated.
“We’re just coming up with ideas,” Sherlock said. “Are there things to do around there?”
John laughed as he got up. "I think I can manage it. You can cook next time," he said.
John shook his head. “There’s more,” he said.
“I’ll find a film for us to watch or something,” Sherlock said awkwardly. He got his laptop from his desk and started looking at the web. “What do you like now?”
"I don't know. In my dream we were quick because it was familiar. Now, I want to know every little thing that drives you crazy," he smiled.
“In a few hours,” Mycroft said, now reading papers he’d pulled from his case. “You should sleep,” he said. “Unless you think there’s something wrong with your head . . . just sleep unless you think it’ll kill you.”
Lestrade recognised the sound of desperation in Sherlock’s voice. His heart went out to John actually. “Well, there’s something you two could work on,” he said.
“Are you the jealous type?” Sherlock asked.
They left the shop together and walked to her flat, talking about how busy the day had been for both of them -- John made up things to fill his day. When they arrived at the building, she led the way inside. She walked in first and John followed, shutting the door behind him. "This is a nice place," he said. He want to turn and take it all in, but suddenly his head exploded -- pain burst from the back of his head and before he could see what happened, he fell and everything went dark.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at his brother looming over him.
“Well, I thought you were also charming until I noticed how quickly you turned on me last night,” Sherlock said. “It was cruel.”
Sherlock opened the freezer and there was a full loaf of bread. He put two pieces in the toaster, glad he had found it but still a bit annoyed. After he finished his sandwich, he made a cup of tea and went into his room.
He waited for the reply.
"I brought dinner," he called back.
"Well, no, but that doesn't really explain why," John said.
“No reason,” she said, reaching over to fiddle with his hair.
Mrs Hudson thought for a moment. “You’re less horrible, I think,’ she said cheekily.
“We were always different that way,” Sherlock said. “I’d rather get lost in logic.”
"No," John whispered back.
John held his hand and nodded. "You've changed mine, Sherlock. Even Harry said it. I know we're different."
“Here’s your tea,” Sherlock said. “Everything all right up there?”
"Oh shut up!" John laughed, throwing the pillow back.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said. “If I’m your boyfriend, I have to.” He snuggled in. “I don’t want to ever miss you like I did before. I know that part of that was my own fault. I won’t let you go so easily this time. I missed so much because I was stupid.”
“Well, because there was no audience and if you’d shown up, the rest of them probably would’ve assumed I was paying you to be my friend,” Sherlock said. “It was easier to just not really be noticed -- and they would’ve definitely noticed you.”
"Hello? It's John," he said.
“John, what is happening?" Sherlock said. He felt panicked but his feet were frozen on the pavement.
"Hmm, not always," John admitted. "Are you good at watching?"
"She looked all right -- I mean, she didn't look like she'd hurt herself," Sherlock said.
"That sounds fine," John said, getting comfortable against Sherlock.
"What do you mean?" John asked. "I live here."
"No, it was a man."
He opened the flat door to see John lying on the sofa. “You are a sight for a sore eyes,” he said with a genuine smile.
“He’s not,” Mycroft said in a way that piqued John’s curiosity.
"What?" John moved towards the bed and sat on the edge. "How is that going to help? I can tell you what happened." John was panicking a bit. What if Sherlock regretted what had happened?
"I know," John said. After a second of hesitation, he started petting Sherlock's hair. "There's a lot we should have done before. Said before." He took a deep breath. "We have time now."
"Sherlock, all I'm doing is working the case and using my skills to do it. You want me to stop? That's fine. But if I stop then I stop across the board -- you can work the case alone."
"I do the things I like. That includes hanging out with you, Sherlock."
“Someone has to,” Sherlock said. He leaned back against the sofa and put his feet up on the table. “Actually, can I ask, why aren’t you in your pajamas?”
"On your way where?"
Sherlock made the tea and brought in two mugs. “Other than that, work was fine?” he asked. It’s what he would normally ask when John got home, even though admittedly he wasn’t always paying attention to the answer. It seemed strange now that John’s work was more of a danger than the work they did together.
“I slept better than I have since this started,” Sherlock said.
"Are you?" he asked. "Or have you just read about it online?"
"Of course. Did you find anything today?" John asked.
“Promotion . . .” Sherlock said. “Hadn’t considered that.” He took a drink. “Well, you won.”
Sherlock, too, made a noise of pleasure. “Feels good,” he mumbled. “Everything . . . feels good.”
“Correct.”
"Hey."
“Sherlock Holmes!” Mrs Hudson shouted from the other side of the flat door.
John moved the phone from his ear and peeked out of the bathroom. He crept into the kitchen and started quietly making himself a snack to take up to his own room.
“Good night, John,” Sherlock said. He walked to his own room, not bothering to turn off any lights.
"Obviously he did not," Sherlock said. "Why are you going to Paris?"
“Well, show your thanks by having everything packed when we get there.”
John turned at the sound of the door, the phone falling from his hand. "Sherlock! I thought . . . why are you home?"
"I hope so too," he said. "Sherlock, how did you know about that place? I mean, enough to vouch for it?"
"Oh, multitasking cases, huh?" John smiled. "Anything interesting?"
“New jobs or return visits because of problems with other work you’ve already done?”
John’s noises built Sherlock’s confidence, and he moved on John’s cock more freely, licking and sucking and using his tongue. Although it was all quite interesting, his mind was clouded by his physical urges and he found his hips rolling against the bed as he got even more turned on by what he was doing and how John was reacting. John watched Sherlock's body moving on the bed, watched his mouth and lips wrapped around his own cock, and he could hardly believe it was happening. He moaned Sherlock's name and gripped his hair. Sherlock loved John’s hand in his hair –- it felt as intimate as what he was doing to John. It all felt so good, but after a few more minutes, he lifted his head and said, “Should I keep going or should we try something else?”
“I’m not a baby,” Sherlock said. “Besides, if you care so much, you probably should have said something before I was in the sun all day.”
“Do you have what we need somewhere in this room?” Sherlock asked. His hand went to his own cock to stroke himself impatiently.
"Impressive," Sherlock said. He stubbed out his fag. "I'll go make a salad. Will that be enough for you, do you think?" he asked.
"Couldn't it just be a favour?" John asked, smiling up at the man.
"John doesn't have a gun," Sherlock said firmly. "The walls don't need any more holes."
Sherlock moved over closer to the shower. “I wasn’t lying,” he said.
They lay there in silence.
“Yes, John’s here,” Sherlock said. “Yes, he’s all right.”
"I'm still tired," he admitted. "But I'm okay."
John nodded.
"Thanks." John dug in right away. "So really, what was she talking to you about all day?"
Lestrade coughed and said, “Not yet . . . we’ve got the blood of a dead man, though, so you can start there.”
"I'll need it back right away. You really don't have email?" John asked skeptically.
"I don't every day!"
“Well? Did you ask him out?” she asked, taking one and sitting down.
"No, it’s not," John said with a laugh. "Is bribery good for a detective?"
Sherlock’s mouth dropped to John’s neck, just as the bell rang and the doors opened. He stepped back to let John out, following him closely. John led them to his room, swiping the key and pushing the door. As soon as he closed it, he pulled Sherlock close again, kissing his mouth.
“I never locked my bedroom door – you could’ve come in.”
"Well that's all I can ask, really." John checked the time. "I'm going to check my temperature before we go to bed. I'll be right back."
That was the bit Sherlock hadn’t quite figured out yet.
“Of course not, John. I was making a joke – remember jokes? Hmm, you assured me yesterday that we weren’t boring and today you seem to entirely lost your sense of humour. . . this does not bode well.”
John watched the tall, handsome man walk over and put the wine in front the woman he was talking to. "I'm John," he said, looking up at Sherlock. "Is this your date?" he asked her.
"Not indefinitely, but for a little while. Maybe I'm not done playing," John grinned.
John headed up to his room. He changed into a clean pair of pants and took his jumper off so he was in his t-shirt before coming back down.
John nodded. "Yes."
That was interesting, Sherlock thought, as he took a quick sip of his drink and grabbed the wine glass, heading back to the table. As he approached, he saw the man sitting next to Mrs Hudson. He decided not to smile, but he couldn’t help appreciating his presence, hoping it would liven up the rest of the reception.
“No,” Sherlock said. “Can you help?” He pulled the sheet back. “Lie down and help me.”
“I knew you could do it,” John said.
Sherlock shifted on the bed. “How have you changed then?” he asked.
"But you don't have a sponsor," he stated. "You're doing this on your own."
“I’m working on a case,” Sherlock said. “I have a few questions.”
“You can’t imprison me, force me to stay where I don’t want to be.”
John took the envelope, shifting to sit up and see it a bit better.
"So this is where the magic happens?" she asked, immediately wandering over to Sherlock's desk.
“It’s okay,” Ellen said. “I have.”
"You got shot, Sherlock Holmes, that's what I learned at St. Bart's when I went looking. It hurt so much, didn't it? I know it did because it says in your records that you wouldn't stop moaning about the pain, about the blood, you were babbling they said, that's the word written in the file: 'babbling.' I can see it clear as day, the bullet dug away some of that fatty bit of your shoulder and it bled so much, too much, more than you thought it could. But the worst part…as you watched the red run through your fingers you waited in that alley for the next bullet, because that's all you could do, all your body would let you do with legs gone to lead and the mercy of disassociation telling you all of it was happening to someone else."
The thing that will be addictive is John himself. His dichotomous nature. His strengths, weaknesses, his praise and rare rebukes.
Sherlock slid right on down, nuzzled with that nose at the top of John's arse, then dabbed his tongue on a freckle at the plump swell of John's left cheek.
Brave words.
Head bowed, shoulders shaking, silent but for the gentlest sobbing, he made every effort to respond, but due to the profoundly unfamiliar thing happening between his legs, he was simply incapable.
John starts walking the perimetre of the room, Sherlock follows. Once they're on the other side, John stops, points with his chin and whispers. "How about her?"
The man calls himself Mr. DangerMouse, for god's sake, and each time Sherlock concedes John got something right, DangerMouse leaves a message telling John he's 'amazing,' 'smart,' or 'incredible.'
Sherlock, who in circumstances such as this would usually say something cutting because in any situation where he feels a fool Sherlock's too stupid to do anything else and yet, well, this time Sherlock did something new: He giggled. He giggled his head clean off.
"He was jealous of you. The informant. He wouldn't show himself and then…you touched me."
Sherlock threw himself, some lubricant, and a case file onto their bed, only in reverse order.
Sherlock frowns, puts the wallet down, steps back…and sits hard in a chair that wasn't there before.
Charing Cross station has been there one and a half centuries, it'll continue on. And yes, Simpson's, as mentioned in ACD's canon, it's still there. As is "the rushing stream of life in the Strand," where this central station sits.

That was good. Because something was about to go right.
Sherlock does like running, but he doesn't like being confused and his new friend is talking so fast Sherlock can't hear a single, solitary word.
Sherlock did fall asleep though, because the man—John thought it was probably Sherlock's daddy—fell asleep, too. John didn't know why Sherlock should stay awake but since it was important, he wriggled out of his chair, and went over to touch Sherlock on the shoulder. "Mustn't sleep," he said, until Sherlock blinked himself awake.
"Why?"
It was about being eight-years-old and making a promise. It was about being only little and not realising how long some promises take to keep.
"Fffuuuuck off!"
And then suddenly they did, one laughing, the other with a lop-sided smile but they didn't go far, not really.
John went to fetch coffees and dither over cakes. In the end he returned with a slice to share and in time to see a vaguely familiar dark-haired bloke drop a twenty pound note in front of Mike and, without breaking stride call back, "And yes that one's clean of pus and fecal matter."
Sherlock doesn't care that it's Remembrance Day. And he doesn't care the mud's wrecked his expensive shoes. What Sherlock does care about is the short man standing at 'his' grave...
And then, up close, he hears a soft-voiced man.

"I know you feel strongly about your heterosexuality, I know you have a reputation as a bit of a Lothario, as a matter of fact I know you were chatting up someone in this queue not two minutes ago."
In lieu of a reply Sherlock Holmes lay back down and serenely opened his legs, his arms, and his mouth.

John Watson could not be reached for comment because John Watson might possibly be crying.
It'd be very ambitious of him, of course. Sherlock out masses him by more than a stone and a good half foot. Still, it'd be brilliant if he tried. Like any tantrum-throwing child Sherlock'll take shouts over silence any day.

The gowned woman and a man exit the lift. There is silence. Everyone descends a few more floors. "Why did you pick me?"
Then Sherlock wiped his nose on the back of his hand and turned Rosie so John could see her rotund little belly. He wasn't really surprised to see stuffing innards peeping out from a two-inch split in Rosie's seam, one clearly working its way up toward Rosie's little bear heart.
The woman by the pillar, the one who keeps thumbing at her bare ring finger? Adulterer.

For Sherlock Holmes, before there was Baker Street, there was Montague Street.
Lestrade looked up, squinted, confused. "Who're yo—"
When a flash of sequins sparked in the doorway the good doctor registered nothing more than their gleam.
John looks out the window now, too. "Thank you, love. Thank you."
That bit is not really this story's important bit, though. The important bit had nothing to do with a lesson in the results of over-consuming dried Turkish apricots, revenge farts, or anything gross.

No. No. And no. What John Watson reflected on just then was that he was absolutely thrilled it was so cold that even inside the heated car he was still wearing an over-sized winter coat. A coat that just about reached his knees and so hid one mother of a surprising erection. Correction: It hid the erection that surprised him. John completed this reflection by acknowledging he hadn't intended his day to go in precisely this direction.

Shoving hands in his pockets, John frowns, and reflects that this is the very quickest a blind date's ever gone sour. Except is it a date? If the person you're supposed to date is the entirely wrong gender then—
When finally the grass had seen quite a bit more of Sherlock's fluids, and John had found a rather doubtfully-hygienic tissue to give Sherlock for wiping, they sat there and just breathed themselves calm.
Sort of.

Captain John Watson was always a good soldier. He knew when to follow orders. Dr. John Watson, however, knew something else entirely: sometimes seconds are all that stand between a dead hostage and a living one.
The silence was broken by a knock on the flat door. John frowned but put his computer aside, heaving himself from his chair and going to open the door. He was met with the sight of Mycroft on the other side, umbrella hung delicately off one arm and a garment bag in his other hand. He smiled cooly at John.
“Let’s get you in a nappy,” John said, tone gentle but betraying that he was still unhappy with Sherlock’s behavior. Sherlock felt a few tears slip down his cheeks as John led him over to the dark wooden changing table. John sat him on the light blue pad on top, reaching forward to strip him of his Belstaff. After he was done, he pressed lightly on his chest to get him to lay back. Sherlock went without complaint, one hand tucking up under his chin while he tucked the other thumb in his mouth. He was still quietly crying, mouth curled down around his thumb.
John smiled back. "I'm having a great time," he announced. It seemed the special dances were over. The dance floor was opened to everyone, and Molly started making her way around to meet with guests.
"You're no fun," she said, settling in herself. After a few minutes of silence, she said, "I spy with my little eye someone who has greatly changed over the last year or so."
She was grinning like she had just won a great prize. "I'm in the area for a little while and thought I'd stay with my brother in his fancy flat," she said.
"Not with a man, no," John admitted.
“Everything,” Sherlock said. “To me, you are everything -- my partner, my friend, the only one . . . I want to be around.”
"So he really left? I really didn't think he would, but then when his mother is involved . . . well, he doesn't like to upset her."
John took the letter from Sherlock and opened it carefully.
“Remind me to move this to my shoe before we get in the water,” he said.
John glanced over at him. "If he wants to, of course."
"I am being perfectly normal! You're just . . . imagining things." It took everything in John to keep a straight face – everyone knew that Sherlock Holmes didn't imagine anything. He observed. "Are you eating anything or not?" He turned around again and finished up, bringing his plate to the table and sitting opposite Sherlock.
John raised his brows. "That's a bit surprising for you," he said. He raised his glass to Sherlock.
Sherlock stood up a bit too quickly, definitely ready to go. He gave Angelo a wave and they headed out.
Sherlock thought for a moment. Was he happy? He couldn’t imagine saying it, but he didn’t feel compelled to argue.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’ll be in my room,” he said, grabbing his bag and disappearing up the stairs. He dropped his bag on the bed and then moved it to the floor, lying down and staring up at the ceiling. Like he’d done so many times before. Already he felt like a child again. He hated this feeling. He also knew it was ridiculous really -- he wasn’t a child, but an adult. He got out his phone and typed a text to John.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Sorry, I lied a little -- I remember everything actually and I liked it all.”
“Anyway,” John said. “What’d you find out today?”
Sherlock still didn’t know what to do. He didn’t like her compliments, and the kissing really didn’t make him feel anything.
John's brows furrowed. "Did he say from which case?"
"Why does anyone go to Paris?" she said. "It's the city of romance after all . . ."
Sherlock slid his finger from John’s body. He grabbed John’s hand and led it to his cock. “You do it,” he told him as he reached for the bottle of lube and slicked the vibrator. He pressed one hand onto John’s thigh and slowly guided the vibrator in, moving it with the rhythm of John’s stroke. “Fuck, you’re gorgeous,” he said.
“Did she get anything for me?” Sherlock asked.
"I think you should take them off now."
Sherlock shook his head. He dropped the book by John’s feet, grabbed his sleeping bag and spread it on the floor before getting in. “I’m just going to keep this book here in case I can’t sleep, I can read with the light of my phone. I won’t wake you.”
John let himself in and climbed the steps slowly, moving into the flat. He looked over at Sherlock, still in his chair. "I have your usual," he said.
“Not precisely,” Mycroft said.
John looked up at the sound and watched Sherlock for a moment. "Yes, I'm sure whatever you come up with will be great."
"I'm excited for cake," John said.
Sherlock thought for a moment. Then he came up with a plan. "How about you then? You don't seem very boring," he said. "What do you want to tell me about yourself?" He brought his tea in and sat down in his chair.
"No, she's left. I was just going to get out of your hair so you can work."
“Dead cold,” Sherlock said. “It’s not really a case, I suppose. To anyone but me, I mean.”
"You win," Sherlock said. He pushed the door shut and stepped in front of it. "You hide now." He closed his eyes even though the room was quite dark. "Go."
“Oh my god, John,” Sherlock said. “I think she’s right – I don’t think we are interesting anymore. We’re just . . . stupid now.” He picked up John’s whiskey glass and took a sip, leaning back against John’s shoulder.
John leaned up and kissed Sherlock's mouth. "To be fucked," he murmured against his lips, repeating Sherlock's words.
“I think so,” Sherlock said. “Should we say something -- that seems like the kind of thing you would want. Like when your gerbil died.”
"Chinese?" Sherlock asked but he was already dialing the number. He ordered John's usual and then hung up. "Won't be long -- eat some salad at least, all right?" he said, tucking into his.
“Your joining the Army . . . I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
That didn’t seem good enough for Sherlock, but he had no choice here. He picked up the cigarettes Mrs Hudson had bought him, and he grabbed his coat to go out and walk around for a few minutes to have one. The smoke burnt his lungs a little -- since John had moved in, he’d been smoking less -- but it also felt good. When he finished it, he went back in and put the kettle on, boiling enough for three cups, just in case.
“What do you care?” Mrs Hudson asked.
"Of course not," John said. "We're friends . . . from the start, you said you were married to your work. You know what the truth is."
“I hope so,” Sherlock said. “Quite frankly, I’d be happy to bypass the police altogether, but I don’t know how to get real cases myself. I’ve got a website, but everyone who’s contacted me has been so . . . boring.”
“That sounds excellent,” Sherlock said. He turned to look out the window, but reached over and rested his hand on John’s thigh.
She patted his arm and got up to leave. John leaned back in the chair and looked around the much tidier flat. Something heavy was sitting in his chest -- he didn't like thinking Sherlock was mad at him. He also didn’t like thinking of Sherlock feeling confused. Sherlock hated that and John hated the idea he’d contributed to it. Ever since he moved in, people seemed to be surprised with how much Sherlock had taken to John. John didn't think much of it, but if that were true John didn't want to mess it up. He finished eating and kept his phone close, hoping Sherlock would write back soon so they could sort this out.
Things were going really well until he started talking to his mum about it. She wasn’t upset about any of it, but a conversation they had put doubts in John’s head he couldn’t shake. She didn’t seem surprised at all that John was dating a boy. When John pressed her on it she admitted she assumed Sherlock and him would end up together. It surprised John -- he had never thought about Sherlock that way but then again they had been really young. When he went back to school after the weekend and kept seeing his boyfriend, he couldn’t stop seeing Sherlock, comparing them. They fought and eventually things ended.
“But you weren’t around tonight . . .”
“You can take care of it,” Sherlock said. “I will take care of John.” A taxi pulled up. “Give me the address.”
Sherlock looked at the plate but didn’t pick up a fork. “Perhaps I’m ill,” he said. “I never get ill. Do I seem ill? I thought you were a doctor, why didn’t you prevent this?”
Sherlock watched him walk off. He looked up and noticed that somehow another band had started playing -- he hadn’t even noticed a change in the music. He looked round but the man who’d grabbed him was gone. So was the tall, ginger man. He looked up to the front -- so was the girlfriend. Sherlock turned and left.
“True, but . . . it was too hard. I’m not good with saying things, feelings,” Sherlock said. “I missed you.”
John rolled his eyes but smiled. "And what do we do when he shows up here?"
"It was interesting to meet you," Sherlock said to her. "Good luck."
"I've slept on the sofa," Sherlock said. "If you'd rather sleep in my room, you can."
"No," John said.
“Just enough to volunteer to go outside in the cold to chop wood,” his father said. He motioned to the wood pile. “Let’s do a bit to take into the shed to dry so we don’t have to do this everyday.”
“And you’ll come with me tomorrow, yeah?”
“Mr Holmes?” a voice responded.
"It feels so good, John," Sherlock moaned into the kiss. "You . . . I love everything . . ."
“When they got back to Sherlock’s cave, John noticed that it too was cold and dark but Sherlock’s cave was bigger than John’s. Sherlock went inside and made them both a cup of tea. John told Sherlock about all the brave things he’d done that day, but Sherlock didn’t have any acts of bravery to share at all.”
"I don't think so," John said, looking around the room. "It’s just a matter of settling in."
“I’m joking, John,” Sherlock said. “But maybe with the cases . . . let’s work together on those, yeah?”
"I suppose so," John said. It seemed their one night would be just that, like he suspected from the start. And moving in with your one night stand? Sherlock was right. It would be weird. "I should go. I'm sorry about the mix up,” he said.
John stepped inside and shut the door behind him. "I..." He didn't know what to say. He moved closer. "Can I get in?"
He stared down at the street and the people walking on it. Some were talking or laughing; most were walking in pairs. He looked to see if any were arguing, but they didn’t seem to be. They probably would be before the evening was over. He was safe here in the flat -- no one talking or laughing or regretting choosing him. He finished his glass and carried it to the sink.
Suddenly the pleasure was too much for Sherlock. “Yes, John, yes,” he began mumbling as he felt his cock jerk and spill. His hand moved desperately, wanting John to feel this good as well.
"Yeah. I am going to ask some colleagues about some places they recommend."
