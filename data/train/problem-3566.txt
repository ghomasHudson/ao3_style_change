“England is
Cas’s heart stutters, and he chokes somewhat. Dean drapes smugness artfully over his face, the expression chipping a horrid sculpture into Cas’s patience. “She has a son?”
“Castiel, I…” Charles’s brows slant downwards, “I trust you, my boy. Humans, though… I don’t want you to be hurt. How can I know that by going down this road you won’t be endangering yourself?”
, baby –“
“Hmm?”
“I was hungry,” Castiel explains further, “Do humans not eat fish?”
Immediately Cas is slammed up against the van. “What the fuck –“
Dean’s mood sinks under such nauseating charms. He looks for assistance in the bartender, but he swam to safer shores at some point, serving drinks elsewhere. Unfortunate. He was starting to like him.
Dean clears his throat, uncurling from his position. He rests on his heels, tilting his face towards the sun to let it dry his tears. The sun warms him, allows him to carry on with his goodbye. “I still want you to have this peace. You deserve it… deserve a lot more than what you got, that’s for sure. You deserved a better life, one clear from all the bullshit that I seem to attract… one where you were with someone who could love you proudly, in the open, the way you deserved.”
“But what if I need to breathe –“
Crowley held up the joint in question, “This? Are you referring to this?” Cas nodded. He smiled while crushing the grass into his ashtray. “Now, can you please tell me why I had to waste perfectly good drugs?”
“…Apparently.” Dean scoots closer to him, skittish. “So… no
It’d be easy. Instead, Cas chooses door number one.
light on the other side.”
“Before you came here,” Adam says, “I had a vision.”
“Right!” Cas places the bags down, opening one to dig inside. In a beat, he presents Jack with a stone. “This is Green Aventurine,” he explains, “it’s for good luck, not that you need it. But we hope it reminds you that we’re always here for you, wishing for your success.”
Cas deflates, “I guess… you sure you don’t -?”
It was the last.
different from the guy on tv. Almost didn’t recognize him, at first, actually. But then he looked my way and I just… I knew it was him.” Dean sighs, “Then, when I
didn’t ask for Yellow Eyes to kill mom. She made that deal… same way Cas did what he did, to protect those they loved. We were the suckers who got stuck picking up the pieces, is all.”
Except Cas only knew Dean in moments, a painful admittance.
Cas squints, backing off from the other man. Concerned by the energy roiling off him like thunderclouds. His brow furrows with the acrid stench of both the alley way and Dean’s derision. “Is that where you and your brothers-in-arms look? If you care to at all?”
“Should they even be called Hawaiian shirts if we’re not in Hawaii?” Cas asks. Dean hears the mattress squeak, and guesses his husband sat on the bed. He digs through the duffel, Cas monologuing in the background. “Are they called Coloradan shirts since we’re in Colorado? If we buy them in California, won’t they be Californian Shirts? Or is it because they’re
Dean toys with his amulet. He stares at the shoreline, floating alongside Castiel who watches him. They’ve been like this for a long while, unmoved by the final strokes over to the finish line.
“Which is?”
“Good,” Adam says, “and how do my hands on your body feel?”
“You were mesmerized by an angler fish,” Castiel explains, “They’re creatures with these hypnotic lights on their –“
“No…” Dean tugs Castiel back towards him. He stays where he was. “Stay here,” Dean insists.
Of the years he knew Dean, Cas never wondered where the other man would hang up his jacket. Cas imagined, of course. A sprawling ranch where he rode horses during his off time, when the sheriff’s badge was away. Or perhaps a functional apartment that he slept in when not at his desk. Jokingly, Cas also pictured Dean sliding into a box like all the other Ken Dolls. Although from last night, he can attest that he packs
“This is nice…” he hums.
“Perfect.” He drops the phone and races across the street. Meg, anticipating this, has the buzzer ringing him in active already. Cas throws the door open and bounds up the steps. Because of his shoes, he blunders the landing and skids hard into the wall. From across the hall he hears a snort, and after rubbing the bump on his head Cas sees her.

“It’s shit,” Rufus growls, “like someone ashed a cigarette in it.”
“I really meant what I said about your car,” Cas tells him, “It’s absolutely beautiful. Figured you detective types would go for something a little less

wanted to raise him.”
Cas pauses, spoon hovering over his cup. “If you don’t like coffee… why are you drinking it?”
He slaps his cheeks twice, “Well! Enough of that!” Cas crawls over to his desk, crushing a half-filled carton of rice and shoving an empty whiskey bottle from his path. He climbs into his chair, knees at his chest so he can rest his chin on them. First, he picks up the paper Kelly gave him, flips it around and realizes it’s actually a flyer.
No answer, as expected. He pockets the strange necklace and, feeling lucky, Cas sticks his hand back into the drawer. Searches the section again for any further oddities. While it seems like there’s nothing left, Cas keeps at it. Scraping against the sides until something bends.
Dean nods, wringing his hands. “I’m not looking for a fight either. I’m… I think it’s time we talked.”
“Beautiful.” Cas defends them on instinct, stepping forward. “Humanity might be all of that, but it doesn’t make them any less deserving of life. Of a second chance.”
like everyone else,” Dean said, “are you?” Mia’s lips flattened into a tight line, a refusal to answer. Dean continued, not expecting her to. “Okay, can we shoot her now?”
before she leaves.” His brother’s façade gives nothing, but Cas knows from experience the storm lurking within. Has one just the same. Except where Cas’s is wild, Jimmy has trained it over the years. Precise enough he can lift a brow and thunder echoes in your bones. That rattling is all he can handle for the moment. Better trail out and let the clouds dissipate than stay and risk further blows. Like Jimmy deciding he can drive Claire to whatever lie she concocted instead of him.
Barely an hour passed since he rung Eve. Cas waited by a random phone booth out in the middle of nowhere, halfway between one point of civilization and another. Ringing and ringing while dust from the barren, scrub-covered land blew in the wind. As he considered hanging up and trying again, someone finally answered. “Hello?”
The closer they get to the wreckage the more details Castiel identifies. On the seaweed-like flag a faded skull stares down at them. Barnacles pepper the shell of the vessel, a veritable ecosystem developing over the years since the ship first sunk. And at the front rests a very familiar statue-like figure.
“Preposterous,” Charles scoffs, “What could a human teach you that you don’t already know –“
“That’s a dangerous point of view to have, Dean,” Adam warns, drawing him from the off-ramp. “How can you speak so carelessly about yourself like that?”
“Calvin.”
Maybe he can answer them all someday.
, and all she did with her newfound freedom was climb the few feet from her lobby to her private floor. She camped in her kitchen for hours, drinking; the empty, nearby bottle of wine was full when Mia first retrieved it, an older vintage the cashier advised her to pop open during celebrations.
needed me. Worked a few jobs here and there in every new town we stopped in. Road trips were few and far between in those days, thought we could actually settle down for real. But then, on a morning just like when Sam left…” Dean reaches for Cas, sliding his hand over where Cas’s rests. Shudders deeply while fingers splay over Cas’s skin. “For all the anger and fighting, Sammy and dad were a lot alike. Makes sense they’d both want to ditch me, too.”
Nick pales, visibly shaken by the blow. “I don’t… why would you…” Pursing his lips, he removes himself from the coals Cas stoked under his chair. Flees, but not too far. Cas watches him grab a wad of cash from out his pocket and flash it towards a girl serving two cold beers. Drags her away, tray still in hand, to a more secluded section of the venue.
She owed him nothing. Still, Mia swore an oath when she accepted her diploma. As she noted during his first visit, this was a man who needed help.
Finally, Dean switched to his thumb and pressed it just below Cas’s lips.
human with Dean. Like always, Dean’s smile widens at the thought. He tries hiding his rapidly flushing face, but Cas tears Dean off of him. He ungraciously dumps Dean onto the bed, blue eyes betraying his cool demeanor as they glow with mirth from Dean’s startled squawking. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Cas was gone. His wings were still there, and Sam was, too.
Through the windshield, they see Sergei stretching with no coverage for his pasty skin. Cas swallows down the sour taste darkening his tongue when Sergei, surprisingly flexible, moves into a position that swings his belly around and flashes his oddly hairless junk. Sole eye of his snake staring at him. “Did I upset the universe?” he asks aloud, “Is she mad? Pushed me down a long flight of stairs and this is one of the many steps I’m crashing into?”
“Well, if he was unhappy then that would explain it.”
Another officer piped in, snickering. “Probably just gonna blow the money on reefer, anyway.” This sets off a chain reaction of laughter Cas ignores, accustomed with the grating noise.
Cas shrugs, twirling the burning joint between his thumb and forefinger. “Kind of got a lot piled up in my brain basket, man. Not really in the mood for grub.”
“Like I said before, our conversations were mainly about his ambitions and, most times, one-sided,” she tells him, “I’ll admit there are things that I didn’t know about, every teenager keeps secrets from their parents. I know I did, and I’m sure you did with yours.”
“Are you actually a therapist?” Dean asked, an incredulous lilt to his tone. He jerked his thumb at the wall of degrees Sam noticed before. “Or did you shift into this poor doctor’s life after you killed her.”
“You think she wants to party?”
“Hearing her out,” he said. Sam, on instinct, glanced behind himself at Mia. She hadn’t run. She didn’t flinch when their eyes locked. As they did, Sam saw an apprehensive trust hidden within her eyes. Sam wouldn’t comment on it, to try and ease her fear. He was still a hunter. He still had the gun. His opinion might change, and she might need to spring into defensive mode again when Sam levelled the weapon at her. “You’re not human,” Sam pointed out what’s already obvious.
“Don’t worry about it,” another voice pipes in, a rougher copy of his friend’s, “scoot on off and let us deal with the hippie, right?” Recognizing this speaker steals the breath from Cas’s lungs.
. They were very clear –“
“How are you at making coffee?”
When they happened upon the family, Dean broke into his antics once more. He waved and hollered, speaking to them in the bastardized tongue he used on Castiel.
He grabs the only book that strayed from its pack, flipping through Kerouac’s
“Gordon?” Cas waits a beat, then says, “No, I don’t think so. Was he… someone you knew?”
“Right…” Cas casts aside his doubt and produces a notepad and pen, “Anyway, I think we should probably start so you can get back to your children, dinner, and…
“Yes, later,” Castiel hums, “I like later.”
“Cas…”
!” Immediately his face stretched in regret, rubber band snapping as he leaped forward in years to his appropriate age. It didn’t matter; the barb struck exactly where it intended, puncturing soft underbelly, unguarded by Dean’s calloused defenses.
“And he snuck in pie. Oh don’t think I didn’t see that!”
He scanned Cas again, chuckling. “Clearly looks like it.”
… this is all
Dean shrugged, “So did ours.” He expected that to feel weird saying, but it hadn’t. Sam gaped at him, like it had. Maybe Dean’s in shock. Maybe he was too used to having a dead mom. Dean carried on regardless. “If you think a sob story’s gonna convince me of anything, try hitting me when the kids got enough pages to fill a book larger than Moby Dick’s, or
or beds.”
Mia approached him with care. “Dean,” she started, voice gruff but also soft, “I’m right behind you.” She laid her hand on his shoulder, overtly aware how he tensed from his words and then again, somehow worse, once she touched him.
He blames it on the other authors. Before he never would have believed there was anything more but after reading one story… then the next… and sifting through passionate discourse giving logical evidence to the fact, Jack couldn’t deny it.
“Why you wanna know?”
“I said it’s nothing, okay?” He stood, body rigid and tense like a taut bowstring. “I think we’re done here.”
“Sleep with other people. In the same bed and stuff… I was never convinced but this…”
From what Jack tore, he guesses it must be the header. Because the numbered list that remains, decorated with a broken border of flowers and interweaving vines, make no sense.
“What? Because I forgot my library card?”
Castiel eyes the amulet around Dean’s neck, the only part of him that hadn’t changed. “Well, maybe the next time you spot some jewelry you won’t put it on.”
Castiel skews his head to the side. “Why are you weird?”
“He not a fan of us?”
“No!” Castiel responds, facing his father, “No, I will not! I’m
.” Winking at a scandalized, cherry-cheeked Dean, Cas continues. “Now, is there anything I can do to spread a little love? Nothing draws attention at a party more than a sour puss.” Claire’s lips twitch, his efforts cracking at that shell. Her composure won’t crack, however, too old for such simple tricks.
Coughing, Dean glanced up at some teenager standing nearby, gaping at the scene. He wore a large brown jacket a shade lighter than his skin over a deep blue polo that matches the visor currently worn like a headband, so his bangs wouldn’t  his face. A ring of keys dangled in his hands. Keys that, Dean guessed, were for opening the very door he pummeled as if it were a punching bag.
Sam and Eileen don’t deserve shadows because of his pain.
Castiel rolls his eyes, “Then why is this here?”
He returned two hours before they did. Settled down with a sandwich in the kitchen, interrupted by his phone chiming with a text from Dean.
“But if you don’t how will you ever know you’re compatible,” Cas teases. Stretches his legs open, rubbing at the inside of his thigh until Dean looks at him. Then trails his fingers along other, more

Sam spends more of his time out of the Bunker than inside it. When he returns he hides away in his room until the next journey away. Dean also doesn't travel far from his bed, recovering. Being Michael’s prison took a toll on his body he was unprepared to deal with now that the archangel no longer resides inside. The times he was roaming the halls, Dean moved so sluggishly he could barely make it to the kitchen. And Castiel, the outlier among the three, locked himself into a role rather a place. His hands hover between the Winchester brothers, trying his best to heal them from the scars of Michael's wrath. He took charge of cleaning the Bunker, making sure the boys were fed with whatever Castiel could find. Granted most of what was made stayed on the plate to turn stale. Castiel focused so much on the others that most days Jack caught him zipping between their rooms.

supportive?” Thousands of examples flickered like a clip reel in his mind. Small things. Dean skipping breakfast so Sam can eat the last of their cereal. Wearing the same clothes, weeks on end, because Sam needed a new wardrobe, reedy body bigger than what they had. Risking arrest with every five-finger discount or hustled game or back alley trick; supporting the way their dad couldn’t.
“Well that depends,” he says, “what should I know a thing or two
“Victor!” She hisses, slapping his shoulder, “Don’t be rude.” Victor turns his glare from Cas, huffing defiantly. Challenging her. She stays firm, waiting until he signals defeat by slumping further into his seat. Smoothing a few baby hairs, the woman faces Cas again. “Please, grab a chair and join us.”
“I know what names are!”
“You treat me so much better than he does, Cas, what would I do without you?”
you’re still on the beat, sniffing around places where your nose don’t belong.”
“None that I can think of.”
Castiel stares after where the amulet falls, watching it become smaller and smaller. A deep-sea vent burns in his chest, muscles seizing at the tremors within. “No…”
and sitting with shrinks that run through the same spiel over and over. Always comes back promising he changed, how he’ll never touch the stuff again. The last place he went was suggested by his lawyer. This one had recently opened and… and it messed him up.”
“Now you can be a little selfish,” Cas says. “
Sam rolls his eyes, reaching forward to tousle Jack’s hair. “You’ve got great power there, Jack. Use it responsibly.”
Cas scoffs, fixing his hat back onto his head. “I wasn’t jumping the fence.”
“Shit.”
“We can do more than the regular cop, but it’s much more hush-hush. Sure… it’s not as flashy, but it’s good work.”
Dean slowly rises from the face hole, Adam not fighting him this time. Leans on his elbows, staring at the floor. At the small droplet that splattered there. “What if I don’t like that person?” he mutters, “What if I look in the mirror one morning and I don’t… don’t recognize that it’s my reflection. What if I become someone so wholly different now that I… now that I
in not fighting with an eighteen-year-old girl. Cas squares his shoulders, bearing the burden of being the responsible one. “Let’s just say having a shared, vested interest in the outcome of tonight’s event means I can play nice for a couple hours. Can you?”
With one phone call, Cas debated whether he should call for a lawyer or a ride. If the former, Crowley would expect payment in a fashion Cas felt uncomfortable giving. Keeping the situation close and closed, Cas opted instead for Andy. Leaving a message with Bobby at his usual hang to pass along. In hindsight, he should have told the younger man a bit more.
Castiel flushes, pulling at his collar. “Sorry to disturb you, Dean, I was sent to find you and… what are you doing?”
years.
He ruffled Jack’s hair, pulling him into a loose hug. “So did I.” They continued forward, happiness making him light-headed.
Although, he already feels like he knows why. If only he could put a name to it.
“Nope,” he says, leaving the bathroom. Jumping out from the mirror. “Not going there… not this early…”
Jimmy squints at him, mouth trembling with the desire to frown. He retains his composure. “Actually, Amelia and I tried talking her out of getting glasses. The optometrist said her eyesight wasn’t too bad… if she cut back on the
Cas grabs his sunglasses, putting them on. “I need some grass.”
Lucifer studied Mary from his own perch. She didn’t know how long he watched, her skin prickling with that feeling of a thousand stares tracking her every move since she crossed over into this other dimension, the apocalypse world. He raised his hands, shackled by a pair of handcuffs that Mary smuggled in with her. He winked, then blows her a kiss.
Dean floats towards Charles, undeterred. “I’m trying to get home – to land. Like I was saying I’m not really one of you. I’m human –“
Dean stiffens, frowning. “Yes – yes, sir.”
He’s thrown onto his back, a hand around his neck. Chuck expressionless while he struggles, looking almost bored. “Nothing, Castiel,” he says, “I have nothing planned.”
“Really?”
“You should be.”
He let himself in, and after two more flights of stairs, Cas stood in front of his lawyer’s door. Too rattled from earlier Cas barged in, greeting Crowley with a nervous grin and muttered, “What’s up, man?”
“No,” smaller man huffs, stomping his foot, “you can’t. Not until after you answer a few of
your problems.”
Claire, smoke dope in my presence.”
Dean let go, marching into the backyard. Silently Dean joined Sam, amassing wood in his stead while Sam assembled the pyres.
“So I could save Sammy before they could get their hands on him.”
After a lengthy chase that dragged them off the path, Castiel managed to drag Dean away from his new friends.
He knows that there’s no going back now. Seeing this through to the end is what he must focus on. Putting his family and duties in the back of his mind, Castiel prays that’s where they stay. And that nothing will come up that will endanger them.
“A cult?” Cas asks, leaning against the other side. He infuses enough disbelief in his voice Cas almost convinces himself that label never crossed his mind. “What are you talking about?”
. Only every meeting he visited, no one took his bait. No eyes flashed in recognition, nor did they give any sort of tell that showed they knew of such a place. He probably visited half the AA’s in the entire Los Angeles area, and after this ends will drive onto the next half.
“I’m dancing, Dean!” Cas says, jumping in time to the beat, “I’m dancing!” They circle each other, never letting the rocking mass interrupt their act. Staying close despite the strong tides crashing into them.
Sam found Dean near the front desk, angrily slamming on a concierge bell. “C’mon, c’mon…” he grumbled, “it’s way past lunch break.”
“Hey,” a lifeguard barks at him, perched high atop his station, “Are you going to pick that up?”
Cas sags on the van, checking his chest where a bruise definitely begins blotting his skin. “Thank God I don’t pay taxes.”
“Likewise. It’s not often I meet one of Dean’s colleagues on the force,” she giggles, studying his appearance. “Aren’t cops supposed to be… a little more clean-cut?”
“We cover ourselves,” Dean explains, “but they’re not always…
“I knew there was something…” He hands the folder to Dean, grinning. “She’s one of them. The missing kids.”
and it
it wasn't. I may have started things, but… what happened between stories was left up to you?” He sounds unsure, but it's the only possibility that eases his guilt. Makes him feel less like a dictator playing with his family like pawns on a chessboard and more like a rancher guiding his cattle where they should be. Both not great options, but one slightly above the other.
Cas’s stomach curdles. It was obvious what Dean’s motivations were – had been repeating them near constantly since his story began – but hearing it again turns everything sour. Gives the previous mention about the lengths he’d go for his brother a darker edge. “And what about the kids?” Cas levels a fierce glare at the detective, “Were they important?”
“Obviously not,” Dean said, sliding into an oversized leather jacket. Another relic of their dad’s. Dean couldn’t leave without it. He couldn’t explain why. “But since you’re insisting on doing this, I might as well make sure you don’t get taken advantage of.”
“I mean I can’t complain,” she chuckles, “Dad said you need my help with a gift?”
there disapprovingly,
“Thank you,” she says. Out the corner of his eye he sees a dark shadow dashing across the street, suspiciously hurry. “Do you have a –“
Dean handled the fire. He struck two matches from a box buried in a kitchen drawer, then tossed them into the kindling. Sam, meanwhile, held a very
Dean slithered closer while he was distracted, hand drifting by Cas’s elbow. Almost touching, not quite. Eyes hard in a fashion fitting if Dean hadn’t flayed himself open in his apartment. His rushed stitchwork cannot hide the few extra pieces of skin that still linger around them.
“Oh, so firm,” he admits, “especially since I didn’t come here as a customer… or to talk about sex.”
Ted grins wide, pupils dilating in a scary way. Thinning like a predator on the hunt, ready for the moment he can tear into a defenseless creature. “Fired up is good. It’s only making me want to do business with you more. But before we get to that, why don’t you give me a little backstory on your company.”
Cas nods, chuckling, “I’ll bet. You probably just come here to watch. Me? Nothing good was on at home, and I didn’t have anyone waiting up for me who can do what they’re doing.” Their dancer grips the top of the cage and summersaults, landing with a fierce rattle that shakes a few misplaced bills onto the floor and earns ear-splitting applause even over the loud background music. “What about you?”
Sam braced for the bullet, wincing preemptively. Instead of his life flashing, all Sam saw was what would happen after. Dean arriving to see Sam failed at stalling Buddy, his lifeless body dripping blood alongside Mia’s and Jack’s, meaning Dean was well and truly alone in the world. Alone because of Sam.
The burn barely began to fade when Dean walks into the kitchen, disturbing him. Jack quickly shut his laptop, unwilling to let the other man see what he worked on. Mainly because of the shift in his storytelling focus.
Those pearled emotions seal themselves tightly in a clamshell, Castiel sending them back into murky depths. “How would you know?”
“Fine,” Claire says, “I
Castiel frowns, tipping his head to the side. “What’s that?”
Castiel wanted to say that it’s nothing special – how dolphins are as common as the tides. But after catching his breath he saw Dean’s gummy smile and twinkling eyes and how his tail spun round and round in imitation of a whirlpool. He couldn’t muster up the annoyance from before.
“I wanna do this,” Calvin shifts, blanketing Cas’s back with his body, “
“It’s already working,” Cas growls, sliding his legs out of the pants. Meg tears at the buttons of his shirt. “I can feel the change… my power returning!” His pants and shirt are flung to the corner and Cas pauses for a moment, basking in his nudity. A hand squeezes his hanging, heavy cock, but he guides Meg away from it. “No,” he tells her, “you’ve already done so much. Let me show my…
“It was my dad’s, and I think you should have it since you are my son,” he tells him, “I trust you with her.”
“Dammit…” Cas strode past the protest, reminding himself why he was there in the first place.
“Yes, about Jack. We need to talk about him,” Cas tucks his chin to his chest. “Before we get into it, I must confess I haven’t found too much that pins down a – uh… an

“No,” he sighs, “but I’ve much more depth than a… a… a reoccurring
It was ridiculous, made in jest, and held no actual weight in a discussion, but Dean latched onto the throwaway line like it were the last life preserver on the Titanic. “You know what, Cas, you’re right!” he crowed, “Scamming
“Lovin’ ain’t got a market value.” Pamela removes her hand from his and fixes her shirt, tugging on the hem and revealing more of her cleavage. Cas whines in the back of his throat. “I’ve another hour before my shift ends. You manage to find somewhere you can relieve yourself and make it back by then, we can party.” She points at him, a ray of seriousness poking from behind flirty clouds. “And don’t think I won’t know. Last guy who tried telling me the drip on my leg was rain escaped the draft, and not by running north. Understand?”
Rising, Dean stretches. Winces as a new disc pops and cracks in his back, “Motels ain’t what they used to be…” He throws his legs over the side, scrunching his toes in the shag carpet. Smiling, “But at least some things’ll never change…”
“Is that why you’re here?” Cas asks, “kill me one last time? Take me off the board because I’m not important to the story?”
Cas wanted to, though. He’d mention it, during lazy mornings spent entangled in each other’s arms under the covers, or as they undressed together – sometimes helping each other, sometimes not – his eyes glanced to where it was and he muttered a hint Dean swallowed with a kiss. Cas subtly snuck it onto chore lists and, once, startled Dean when cooking breakfast; snaking his arms around his waist, hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder, and asked, “When are you hanging the mirror today?”
Cas still needed one last thing until they met. An opportunity only the universe could present. Exiting the library, he cleared his head and began wandering the campus again. Tuning into the youthful energy radiating inwards like an electrical plant, their hopes and dreams of the future giving him a different high than the one grass does. Although he smelled that familiar sweetness heavy in the air.

Wandering, Cas happens across more strange sightings.
He hums, barely looking at him. “Never thought about it like that.”
“Yes, it is.” Mia scribbled a quick note in her journal, frowning. “However, sharing your feelings is not

“Wrongly.” She twists her cigarette nub in a crystal ashtray. “I love my kids because they’re mine, but that doesn’t mean I can’t hate them, too.” Eve must sense the confusion emanating from his scrunched face, as she continues, “Love and hate… they’re not so different. How can you hate something if you didn’t love it first… or experience love without knowing how awful hate is? It’s like… hippies and cops. They hate each other, but I’m sure if the other were to disappear they would greatly miss them.”
a niece?”
” He holds the fish out to Dean, “Come on, why don’t you eat?”
Cas abandons his car, walking across the lawn and towards a creaky, front porch. Each step whines under his weight, settling only when he reaches the top. A few more steps past a dusty porch swing, and Cas leans
“Hmm…” Cas’s neck slinks backwards as Rufus peers closer, head aching from how it’s forced against the wall. Waiting while the older man digests his story. It sticks in his throat like bad phlegm. “Where’d you meet the girl?” he asks, “You can recall that, can’t you? Or is it just more boobies?”
Castiel nods. “That is… a comforting thought.”
Cas does, letting Dean shut the door softly after him. Delicate, with more care than he has shown the entirety of their conversation. He lets this act of kindness slip through the cracks, mind too wracked with the tangled web of the past few days, and how Dean has jumped into the fray and messed it up further.

“It’s not just that,” Dean corrects him, “I also don’t want to work with
“Yeah, but I’m sure we’re close –“
“I’m pretty sure I’ve had lots of opportunities,” Dean tells him, “I just… never took them.” He shrugs as best he can. Sighing when Adam brushes one of his love handles, scratching it. Warm delight making Dean’s toes curl. “It wasn’t something a guy like me was supposed to do.”
con.”
’. Sure… not because it’s hard holding down a fucking job when you’re six sheets to the wind and counting…” His explosion near the church begins making more sense.
If Cas could control it, he would walk on clouds the rest of the way towards his car. Fate thinks differently and makes him so heavy he crashes through the clouds and onto Earth once more. She sends a messenger from reality reminding him that while he may revel in joy of what to come, presently the promised ending is chapters off.
His brows knit together, nerves settling as a wave of irritation rolls onto his shores. “Yeah, I can
Jack frowns. As Castiel tells him this, Jack searches within himself to find his soul. While he cannot find it, he does now understand the cold absence lodged in his chest. “Is it… bad, that I don’t have a soul?”

This… Dean never so openly showed affection with Cas since that day. He prepared for the change in their relationship, expecting it even. But though nothing was left unsaid, and they shared a room, Dean and Cas never felt farther apart.
. So, when you’re ready to start, let me know.” Adam spins on his heel, grabbing for tinctures and potions on a nearby counter. Mixes them. Feigns busyness while Dean readies himself.
“What the hell?” Dean yelled at him, massaging his sore wrist, “Sam, what do you even think you’re doing?”
“Jack wouldn’t have left without a reason.”
For once, Cas resists his impulses. Of throwing his arms around Dean, dragging him from the couch and into his room; cocooning themselves from all that troubled them until Cas laid every piece of skin Dean flayed in this makeshift therapy session where it belonged. A good idea that would only delay them further from the point Dean promised at his arrival. He can sense that if they drove onto this highway’s shoulder, they’d never reach their destination.
Cas scoffs, “Probably because Bobby packs it with grass, man.”
“Yes. Why are you wearing them?”
“Then why ask?” Cas glares at his creator, mustering enough fury that he trembles from an entirely
Castiel blushes, glancing away. “Nonsense, there’s no need to –“
“Because I was waiting on you.” He huffs, turning, “Don’t gawk boy, you look dumber than you already are.” The man carelessly dumps his half-filled coffee cup and heads towards the exit. “Come on,” Rufus calls, seeing Cas rooted to the spot, “I don’t have all day!”
But that won’t be until later. Now, Dean shimmies out of his boxers. He pulls the panties on, flicking the bow twice once it’s settled. “Are you ready?” Dean croons, jiggling the knob, “because it’s time to
“Of course it was my fucking brother, Cas.”
Buddy hurriedly swarmed he and Mia, crowding them further against the fireplace. The gun wavered. Not enough Sam might risk retaliating, but every few seconds it left him and was trained on Mia. “Look how far you’ve sunken, baby,” Buddy purred, stroking Mia’s chin with the gun, “teaming with hunters? I knew you were a traitor, but I didn’t realize it had gotten this bad.”
“Well, there is my Baby –“
“Our future…” He relaxes, allowing a few more kisses before he starts again. “Y’know, I… I thought I’d never get to say that. Figured, after Jack took the reigns from Chuck, this was all we’d get and – and having everyone back was nice. But you weren’t there, and I hurt. When you died, I wanted to sit there and let myself waste away and join you. Except if I did, you’d be so angry and – that’s what’s been keeping me going. You loved me so much – and were pained whenever I was… I couldn’t do that to myself. Punishing myself wouldn’t be fair. So I thought about
“I didn’t know Stanford specialized in that type of discipline, but I guess everyone’s getting with the times…”
The amulet begins sinking into the deep, Dean glowing bright before his human body returns. Charles lets go, Dean’s arms now scratching at his throat while bubbles pour from his mouth.
Cas rolled his eyes, scoffing. “Thanks, but I’m fine with helping people in my own way.”
“I saw you, Castiel Novak, jumping over what most people know as a fence – a barrier that separates open space from enclosed spaces, usually private property – with my own two eyes.” Dean strangles his notepad, losing patience. “How is that
Adam squeezes Dean’s ass over the towel, Dean yelping. “Why I’ll admit you’re a beauty, my heart is spoken for. As is yours.”
Last thing he remembered Cas locked his briefcase after closing it. Now the clasp rests in the opposite direction.
Dean leans into his car, grip on the roof strong enough Cas fears the metal will bend. “You might consider yourself high and mighty, above the law,” he whispers, twang thick with contempt and urgency, “but there’s a reason we traffic in the big leagues, and
Sam met Jack on the way there, “You on your way to the garage?”
He rubs his knuckle at the space between his brows, humming a sour note. Dean makes being nice so
Dean’s atypical car door slamming during his exit. “What?” Dean asked, his voice a dark and stormy sound that rattled Sam’s bones like lightning, “Dad hunted with you when you were his age. It’ll be fine.”
“Bacon and whiskey? And porn! Like those aren’t your favorite things –“
“What?”
this part of yourself?” he asks, “Suffocating it because other people had
“It most certainly did!”
Cas bunches the suit jacket with his trench, and then gathers his shoes. “That was fresh, this is stale.” They move towards the door, Cas pausing beside it. Without warning he spins and wraps Meg in a heated embrace, dipping her.
Still unsettled, Cas can’t go back out like he is now. He paws the handle of Dean’s medicine cabinet, flinging it wide. “Fuck,” he hisses, seeing nothing besides bandages and cotton balls. A bottle of dolls would’ve been fantastic. Something innocuous he could chew on. The buzz isn’t half of what grass is, but Cas doubts he could escape Dean’s wrath if he lit a joint here.
Dean gagged. The toxic rush of seconds ago disappeared, spilling out from the seam Sam pulled loose.
“I think it was… no, wait – actually…”
“What about the thing I gave you?”
“Yes?”
“It was,” Castiel agrees, “Why’d you stop, then?”
Switching gears, Cas climbs back up with a new plan. Finding Claire, Dean, and dragging them both out of this altered reality.
“I found one,” Castiel tells him, “The snack came with the bed.”
“I didn’t think I could ever be a cop, but it’s actually easier than a lot of folks like to think –“
They’ve met up every now and then, calling on the other if backs needed scratching. Never putting a label on what they shared. “My co-workers saw you the other day,” she mentioned one night while they lay side by side, bodies spent. “Asked if you were my boyfriend.”
Cas squares his jaw, squinting, “How so?”
Which is why seeing him here unnerves Jack.
“No, no that’s not – that’s not what I’m talking about.” Dean points up towards the large vent above. “
but not really – and you know what it used to be? Some base of operations for this clinic. Real mouthful, let’s see if I can remember…” His lighter snaps open, flame kissing the twisted, paper tip. Cas breathes it in, stepping into Dean’s personal space. As he speaks the next few words, smoke curls around a blushing detective. “Institute for the Conscious Repair of the Human Soul?”
was. Hell, I was
Interesting. Cas won’t betray his piqued curiosity, instead throwing his head back with practiced ease; a stoner’s laugh hollowing out his cheeks. “Wow,” he snickers, “didn’t know Uncle Sam approved of the British Invasion…”
His eyes were bright gold.
“I love you.”
“Well,” Cas snorts, smile ghosting across his lips, “what would a father be if he weren’t a little
“About the missing kids, how they’ve been pushed under the rug?” Cas speaks over him, scowling, “About Project Carnation and whatever the
Cas rolls the seat back and forth, peering at the drawer. Chews on his lip while he thinks. He walks his fingers across each tab while debating how he should go about investigating the fastest.
That’s changed, too.
“Men,” she sighs, “if you were left in charge the time between a proposal and a marriage would be about as long as a commercial break!”
He does, regretting it.
I know I said I'd update this on Sundays, but given Supernatural coming back I've decided to switch to Thursdays lol.
difficult. “Your brother,” he growls, aggravation waning while he ignored another exit off the highway of Dean’s past. “He and your father got into fights?”
He nods, “Like mother, like son.”
“Is it? Dean –“
Cas waits. Rewarded, moments later, when Meg’s voice crackles to life. “Clarence? Still there?”
“It’s the only one he would buy,” she shrugs. Looking at his rearview mirror, he sees her studying the passenger seat. “So… who is this guy,” Claire asks, kicking, “really?”
“I don’t,” he concedes, dragging his hand along the counter as he moves closer to the doors. “But that doesn’t matter. Because I’m going in there, and you can’t stop me.”
“We should sleep,” Castiel tells him, “we still have a long journey ahead of us.”
Cas huffed, glaring at the road so he didn’t incinerate his passenger with the intensity of it. “Unfortunately, your masterful skills at describing the most important details are second to none.”
that makes Castiel’s head spin, and he wants to know what that is.
“You’re – you’re brother,” Castiel squeaks, “You’re ‘little Sammy’?”
“I wouldn’t be here without
“You’ve got experience with cults, too?”
“C’mon Castiel, you should know by now…” A familiar voice breaks through static, Cas’s grip tightening on the rusted rail. “This close to the end, anything goes.”
When Dean mentioned that he and Cas were leaving, visiting the First Man and his angel lover, Sam supported the decision. Getting him out of the Bunker, even for a short while, might aid in Dean’s recovery. He thought so, as did Cas. Both sharing over coffee early in the morning that this might be some needed change. A good trip can do wonders for Dean’s mood.
first time at the rodeo. Although it’s been hard getting back in the saddle after I moved out here. I’ve been hopping around, from meeting to meeting, trying to find a place that I…” Cas glances around the room, struggling with his next few words. “Somewhere that I might… fit in?”
“Hold on,” he drops the spoon, head skewed while he wraps it around the other man’s logic. “If you weren’t here for the coffee… why stay?”
“I don’t know,” Pamela says, “if I use a toy or two, we can call the whole thing a demonstration and write it off. We have these new love beads that came in I’ve had my eye on… remind me of the beaded curtain separating the rest of my pad from my…
would, anyway… ‘
“No one’d let me see him!” Dean’s head rolls, chin settling on his chest as he faces Cas. “I tried his office, no one’d say a peep. Calls were left unanswered and he never followed up. Wasn’t able to run into him by accident. I knew I’d need a little grease on the wheels if I were gonna get my meeting with Sammy. Becoming a cop seemed like the right idea at the time. Lawyers and cops work together on occasion.”
in a contraption named an
Cas nods, scrabbling off this doomed ship with the offered floatation device. Standing, he strolls towards Dean and glimpses the men on the other side.
enjoyment. He sowed seeds of unwanted fantasies. Dean cleared his throat, repeating the question, digging out those dropped seedlings before the bartender’s imagined wanderings might flower.
“He was out,” Cas lied.
Smirking, Cas stretches languidly. Adds a wink that throws Dean further off, blush staining his cheeks. “So,” he asks, “what’s Abby think of all this?”
“Father, no!” Castiel yells, railing against the grips of familiar faces, “Please! It’s not what you think!”
Sam hung by his shoulder, buzzing halo bothersome in Dean’s ear. “I think he likes you.”
“Was he expecting you?”
Mia waited for Dean to respond. Instead of snagging the obvious bait, he hunkered down on one of her brass stools, shoulders hunched and fists mangling each other in a facsimile of prayer. She busied herself, setting the empty bottle nearer the sink while she washed clean her glass. Then, Mia asked Dean if he wanted anything. His non-answer meant she needlessly flipped cabinets open and shut, trying to fill a void with something other than words. Mia hadn’t much she wanted to say to Dean.
Bobby offered her his gun, gaze darting to the smoldering embers of their campfire. It didn’t add light, or warmth, but it seemed appropriate when Mary broached the topic of stopping for the night. “Your turn.”
“Humans cannot become like us – were not blessed by the sea as we were, what could…” His stare settles on Dean’s chest, on the amulet resting there. “That damnable magician… Joshua if you were only alive in my time –“
Fitting, given the last time Cas was in the area it was a small Mexican-American community on the verge of being bulldozed by developers. Cas remembers a time when he and his friend Cesar sat outside his porch and shared grass, discussing horrible futures such as that. “Don’t know where I would go,” Cesar muttered, flicking the nub to the ground, “I grew up here, man. Why should I abandon ship when those pasty assholes can kick up their heels anywhere else?”
“Monster,” Dean says, “Fucking
“Okay…” Sam said, “Do you have notes that we can look at – if, if that’s not an invasion of privacy, or whatever? Maybe we can establish a pattern or – or see whether there’s differences between sessions based on what you wrote?”
“I have a few feelers out,” he says, “possibilities I’m considering. Do you know anything more about where Jack might’ve gone in that time after your fight and when he came back?”
“Yes, and you’re supposed to be finding one –“
“I don’t think Heaven is above,” Dean tells him, “I think it’s down here. It’s so beautiful… and everything around us is amazing…”
Sighing, Andy scrambles into a seated position. Legs folded over each other like a lotus, pizza box open in his lap. Though slightly ruined and cold, Andy grabs a slice and happily chews on it. “Nah, man, I smoked the last of my stash yesterday.” Cas’s disappointment must be obvious if Andy notices. His friend sprays crumbs in his rush, “Don’t worry though. I was planning on hitting up Serg’s for more. You can come with?”
“You get used to it,” he says, urging him with a harried wave, “now come on!”
Dean scowls at him, colorful imagery unappreciated. He doesn’t fall for the bait, instead continuing with his story.
Castiel must notice this queasiness, because he grazes Dean’s elbow. Uses words Dean cannot presently grasp. A wave of concern sweeps across Castiel’s features, transforming them. Drawing Dean closer, lost in his orbit.
“Then you
His actions rile up the calmer of the two but doesn’t provoke more of a reaction than a wobbled lip. The agent smooths his hands down his jacket, scowling. “Apologies, my name is Special Agent Mick Davies, and my associate,” Mick growls, jabbing the other with his elbow, “is Special Agent Arthur Ketch. We work for the FBI.” At that, they produce their badges in practiced synchronicity.
Jack shrugged, “I mean, it was kind of annoying, but I learned to ignore them. When I learned how harmful the content was, however, I was very glad to hear that TikTok went ahead and took some sort of action – Hey!”
Dean squeezes his socks, glaring at the door. His irritation fades, weirdly, the longer he stares. Replaced with a different feeling, comforting. Without needing to, Dean guesses it’s not Sam on that other side. Tossing his socks, Dean stands and slowly inches forward. Drawn by gravity, a name perched atop his tongue. Waiting there, scared of being spoken. Of being wrong. He doesn’t
Cas shrugs, audaciously winking at Dean. “I didn’t say anything, Dean,” he says, “you hearing things? Some of that smoke find its way up your nose?”
She stripped off the borrowed clothes she wore, marching to her bathroom naked. Mia twisted the knobs beside her faucet, hot water cascading from the spout and filling her tub. Then, she opened her mirrored cabinet for supplies: perfumes, bubble baths, a box of matches and a green cylinder of pre-rolled joints. As she closed the cabinet, her stare lingered on the features of the face she borrowed. Mia traced the edges of Dean’s father’s face, frown deepening with each passing second. “You must have been a real rat
Unlike other spaces he saw, Dean put thought into his decoration here. Posters from old Westers hanging on the wall. A huge profile of John Wayne with a smoking gun taking most space. Small table pressed into a corner; a record player plugged into a nearby outlet. An empty sleeve for Bob Dylan’s
Dean parked sloppily, again; however, pocketing his keys this time as he left Baby. He didn’t acknowledge the front door, shuffling into the backyard for another glimpse of Cas’s body.
Dean finds joy in the simplest of activities. Castiel barely noticed when the pod of dolphins swam by them. They were chaotic tricksters that visited Castiel’s home often – usually to chatter and play with Gabriel. He learned to ignore them at an early age. Dean, however, watched with awe as they passed. Then without notice Dean sped off after them.
Dean grins with maliciousness glinting off his sharp teeth. “Did anyone ever tell you, Cas,” he says, “you should’ve been in the Olympics?”
Cas lies because, like with the Empty, it’s the only choice he has.
of having love.”
he should have one. Now, he thinks back on where most precincts would keep their files. All shows hide those secrets in a dark dungeon, away from public view and protected by thick red tape. Cutting through that will be another problem, first he must find the stairs.
“Go to hell.”
A burly man chats with Dean, dressed like his friends. Hair pulled tight in a ponytail, and a carnation blossoming over his shirt. His voice, southern and swampy, croons a hypnotizing tune that’s hard for Dean to resist in his loopy state. “Now, you can see how living life that way is crazy right? Forcing yourself to conform to a bunch of made-up, invisible
bunch of mind-controlled zombies.”
partake some…?” Without waiting, Cas grabs a pinch of grass and spreads it across an empty paper. Rolls the joint and slowly licks along the edge, gaze never breaking from Dean’s. The other man watches intently, pupils dark while following the drag of Cas’s tongue. When done, Cas blindly reaches for his nearby lighter. As he flicks it on, the spell over Dean breaks.
!” Stomping ahead of him, Dean leads Cas elsewhere. “I know a quicker way to the garage.”
Cas runs from the room, Martin’s kaftan sliding over his knees jolting him out of shock. Hurrying down a funhouse hall, exit never closer despite how fast he moves. Floor tilting, knocking him off balance. Obstacles littering the area.
Cas shrugs, “I can smoke, I guess.”
“…If you have a pen, I can totally give you the address of my guru who guides me through the exercises! I can sense you would benefit greatly from it, your aura is so – it’s so green. Not a good green though, the sickly kind you see when you’re… sick –“
Dean nods. “Being there… changed him. Made him ‘realize’ law wasn’t what he should be doing, but
on the back of some mangy dog. Until
He paused, fingers midway through scraping more gel off Dean’s locks. “I’m doing the best I can,” Cas tells him, “it’s not my fault you think
“I am your father, Castiel,” he said, “By the Lord’s grace, show me that respect.” Cas won’t deign him with a response. Not even as he hurls the glass at the wall, shards shattering everywhere. “Fine,” he says, “you want to be a big boy. Then you’re a big boy Castiel. Go on out there and do
“Just…” he nods, glancing fleetingly in his direction, “thanks.” Dean hurls himself into his car, not waiting for Cas’s response.
He pocketed the notepad with a scowl. “How do I know you’re really what you say you are.”

Claire joins them, “Because he’s a pig.” Her bowl clatters like a gunshot on top of Kaia’s bits of milk spraying out at them.
Sergei ignored the man in the midst of his crises and approached him and Andy. Offered his experience in guiding them towards hidden truths about the universe they’ve been missing. Cas scoffed, “Me and the universe understand each other just fine, Serg.”
“Yes, but… in here? I thought you…” Jack trails off, unwilling to bring up the massacre. The scattered bodies - of their
Almost Christmas, at least. In fifteen minutes. But before they exchange gifts with their family next morning, Dean and Cas discussed a more intimate setting where they can unwrap each other’s presents. Given how this is the first year they’ll celebrate Christmas as a
Charles groans, kneading his brow. “What’s honorable in running away, Castiel? In leaving your family in a panic because they had no idea where you went! If it weren’t for your guards we still would have been scouring the seas searching for you instead of following in your damnable chase.”
“Find him, of course.”

“Nah, I’ve been doing this since Alexander the Great was in toga diapers. Can’t be that.”

Clumsily, he opens his car door and falls into the front seat. Starts the engine and drives out of the parking lot, sparing a brief peek at his rearview mirror where Dean’s outline fades with all the other shadows.
“Andy,” Cas saunters into view, drawing three sets of eyes to him, “friends of yours?”
“Forgery Castiel?” Crowley smirked, steepling his fingers, “What sort of investigation have you gotten involved with this time? I don’t remember you needing fakes to take photographs…”
“Dunno. Probably to give me my shit that he took.”
Dean pauses, eyeing him warily. “What?”
. But I was able to teach him a few things and he did the same with me.”
“A book,” Cas repeated, hands shaking, teeth grinding, “Heavily anticipated. People really want to know what happened to your husband… one of those things like when people rubberneck car crashes? The publishing company promised that it would bring a lot of acclaim… maybe even to the people I feature in it?”
He chuckles, “You see the way he’s dressed? Better hope I don’t rub off on
They stand across from each other, neither satisfied with how this conversation concluded. And while hearing that Dean’s involvement with Jack’s disappearance wasn’t the sinister imaginings his mind created, the messy truth leaves him as unsatisfied. Doubly disappointed.
The board restructures itself once more.
“Jack,” Castiel greets him; a deep, exhausted rumble purring from his chest. “How are you?”
’ could describe. It’s somewhere in the middle of the room, covering at least three shelving units.
Briefly, Cas considers shouting. Alerting the others that Chuck hadn’t gone far, nearer than they figured. Except Chuck’s head lolls around once more, clearly expecting Cas to do exactly that. His jaw tenses, Cas rising on shaky legs. “What do you want?”
Alone, Sam balanced the baby bag and Jack’s carrier in his hands. He chased after Dean, climbing the steps as a man, tall, white and utterly average, descended. They bumped shoulders, Sam mumbling an apology on reflex. He heard the passerby say something while Jack spewed raspberries in response. He didn’t give it more thought than that.
Cas hopes the tremor in his lips isn’t visible. “Oh, Jack,” he growls, hiding shaking hands under the table, “Right… she did mention that name, quite a lot. I guess what with my stomach turning on me and the
It’s maddening, touching Cas like this, like he always wanted. He dreamt of being able to for longer than he could remember. Daydreams and fantasies of Dean, curled into Cas’s side, leisurely and lovingly memorizing every inch of the other’s face. Those moments were always pretend, too human to ever be real, to expect from an angel like Cas. Now, as his thumb swept along the bow of Cas’s lips, Dean paid his respects to the thousands of imagined mornings and nights that would not be. Dean worshiped Cas in a way he never wanted to, but in the only way he’d ever be allowed to.
, that’s against the law.”
“I didn’t make them do things they didn’t want to, did I?”
His mood darkens, storm clouds rolling over his features. “Because of the storm? Learning about a whole world that exists adjacent to yours? Hidden under the tides?”
“What?” Dean touches his bangs, as if remembering they were there. Like having hair brushed aside, flopping over his ears and curling at the nape of his neck were
Although that’s just one oddity to tack on, many more concerning him. Like how there seemed like a never-ending source of people flowing into the house, taking up every inch. Cas left claustrophobic by how packed it became. Afraid the walls strained from the effort of confining such a large crowd. The only one concerned.
“Cas is telling the truth, Mister uh – Cas’s dad –“
, Cas?”
“Well I was in the area,” Dean tells him, a perplexing comment Cas files for later. “And every now and then those big cases get too stressful, roughing up a hippie or two helps blow off some steam.” He stops in front of him, pulling back the lapels and revealing the gun holstered in its leather sleeping bag.
“It’s… it’s like this,” he starts, “Even though there was nothing
“Wow,” he whispers, rubbing at his cheeks. “Y’know after I… after I spent that day in the library I… I didn’t think I could do it again. Thought it was a fluke. But I remembered how easy it was before and the next day I… did it again.” His eyes shine with fresh tears as he wipes away the ones already fallen. “Thank you Jack.”
Castiel steeples his fingers and taps at his chin. “There are many different solutions… given the limitations we’re working with, however, your options are limited. Although maybe a
Lies and charms were unnecessary when he caught sight of the man behind the counter. A memory bubbles forth from a bog he avoids whenever navigating the landscape of his mind. Of past encounters that would be better forgotten completely. Cruising late at night in a park, being approached and lead to a shadowy corner where no one would disturb them. Repeated muttering of how he could lose his job if discovered, suffocating the vibe. Fingers trembled as they tried unzipping his pants. When he finally started working him over all the nervous energy exploded, and the man burped on his dick midway through a blowjob. Cas left soon after, dick limp but unspent.
Dismissed, Jack returns to his room.
“…Right.”
? Was it this world – did I… help me make it make
“Have you heard of…
“I don’t think there’ll ever be the right girl for me.”
“Why, though,
Her smile falters, resurging with a smug edge as her chest puffs with a second wind. “On my windshield,” she explains, digging into her purse again, “I noticed a ticket under one of the wipers. Meant to bring it up with him except… a few days later, that’s when he disappeared.” Kelly hands the crumpled slip to Cas, “Will this help?”
Nick stuffs his manhood back in his underwear, shifting. “I don’t know who you think you are or-or what gives you the right to come barging in here –“
Without any of the earlier adrenaline, Cas is inclined to join Dean. Relax now that the worst is over, the danger averted. Despite how heavy his eyelids were, however, they cannot close. They resist, staring at his and Dean’s hands. At how their palms touched, Cas wondering how they stayed so soft. Their fingers slotted together in an almost perfect way that makes him question whether he had fallen asleep. And if he awoke, Dean and he would be at separate ends of the car. Opposite sides, like they’re used to. Not this.
story ever. One that would prove without doubt Jack played God. He spent all night typing the story – adding in whatever crazy idea flittered into his mind. Then, when finished, Jack flew to different stores and grabbed a few necessary props for morning. After laying them outside the doors of his fathers' rooms, Jack returned to the setting of his fiction.
“Just Sam is fine. And yeah, better than okay, actually,” Sam said, “What finally convinced my brother to finally

“Enough!” Charles says, body shaking with rage, “Castiel, you will return home with me at once –“
means you and I, together. We get to do whatever we want with the rest of our lives and… there’s no one I’d rather have at my side. In my passenger seat, or – when I’m tired, and need to lay my weary head to rest – on the wheel.” His fingers unfurl like spring flowers, a silver key nestled in his palm. Cas gasps, stare darting between it and Dean. “It’s not a ring,” he says, “because what’s the point in those if we’re legally dead. Besides, we’ve spent so many years running around in circles… never saying what we should have… I’d hate for that to be the symbol of our relationship. This, though, I… Baby’s mine. But –“
Dean focuses only on the music and dancing. It’s easy, losing himself in the rhythm. Forgetting who he is, where he is, and
“A little concerned, to be honest.”
Sighing, Cas shifted on the couch. “I need some fake credentials and paperwork, and I know you can either do it or get someone to do it for you.”
“Real boring chit-chat you’d find a waste of time –“
He tugged on the lapels of his rumpled jacket, wincing where it squeezed. “I fit this… no hassle last time…” Cas sucked in a deep breath and finally the button cooperated. Although further breathing became more complicated. At least the boots he found distract from suffocation, as each step the leather chafes his bare ankles. When finished Cas bets he will have a new blister. Pain is worth it seeing how he needs to reflect some sort of professionalism instead of the beach bum vibes he normally radiates. Beach bums are rarely tolerated in the fancy communities of the rich.
– around his ankles, “it doesn’t work all the time.”
“Do you have a first name, Harris?”
“What do you mean?”
it, Dean. You… how could you?”
Someone knocks on the front door. It echoes in the quiet emptiness of Kelly’s house, reaching all the way upstairs. Cas freezes, unsure what to do. When another series of knocks follow, louder than the first, he switches into a panic.
It’s almost
“Because you seemed very…
“Almost a year,” she amends, “It won’t be a year until May rolls around and – and when that happens it will have been a year since Jack graduated… a year since he left high school and what has he to show for it? Nothing.” Kelly chokes on a sob, lamely covering it with a cough and stalling for composure.
Castiel squeezes Dean’s shoulder. “From the moment I laid eyes on you Dean, something has been stirring… growing within me. I thought it was curiosity, but the longer I spent in your glow I realized it was something…
“He never wore his ring,” she says, “And there weren’t any pictures of them in his office. Found out why as I caught him hiding it in his drawers when I walked in.”
“Tell me what?”
garbage day at Angel’s Oasis.
Jack pounds his fist to his forehead, cursing himself. Had it truly been too long since he had his powers that he had forgotten what it felt like? Because of him, his family unknowingly lost their free will. Became the very characters people thought they were.
He scans the beast, an unexpected piece of the puzzle. Tries and identifies where it fits in this grand mystery. Cas checks that no cars come before stepping outside. Hurries over and tries opening the passenger side door.
“When I was younger,” Dean starts, a small smile on his face, “Back before my dad was… who he is now. When my mom was still alive, she’d tuck me in and she’d… she’d sing me a lullaby. It’d change from time to time, but whenever I was feeling low she’d always go with ‘Hey, Jude’. Then she’d kiss my forehead and… and tell me that no matter what happens – no matter how bad I feel – that there’s always someone looking out for me. She’d say it was angels up in Heaven…”
“You couldn’t have tested your powers with any other kind of story?”
It’s a sign. Cas’s confidence booms now backed by both logic and fate.
“It’s common for adults to have difficulty in reconciling the image of the mother in their heads with the person they actually are,” Mia said, “Kids take their parents for granted, a lot of times forgetting that they have a life outside of their children’s concerns, and this continues despite growing out of adolescence.”
Dean holds out his hand, counting. “Well we have cars, boats, motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, buses, trains, airplanes – although really those are untrustworthy if you ask me – and…”
They lapsed into an anxious silence after. Even Jack fell into a quiet lull, entertained by the pacifier Dean stuffed into his mouth when he set him on the desk. Although his focus, like theirs, was trained on the screen. Together, they watched people – regular people, given how their eyes didn’t flare – walk in and out of frame for longer than Sam would have liked. When it seemed as if they hit another dead end, Sam saw Dean storm into view. “This is us,” he said, Sam’s own figure appearing at the same time the man from earlier had.
“Let’s not think about that now -”
Kelly froze, hold on her ring finger slack. “What?”
Sam’s jaw hangs, from the information and how casually they discussed it in front of them. “You went skinny dipping?”
Discretion is key, but right now all he has is the one for his car. “I’m not allowed to discuss the private affairs of my clients – you know how it is.”
, too. I had to be

Cas obeys, trailing behind him. “I thought you said sex
“We thought you were a goner,” Sam says, “The storm came from out of nowhere… the ship – how did… they said no one could have survived?”
by guys… it doesn’t really matter to me.” Cas advances as Dean puts more distance between them. Arms held wide, like Cas might pounce now. “Only if they
“I…” Cas hadn’t thought that far ahead, about what Dean would wear. He never had those problems, sleeping in the buff. But now, seeing all Dean’s bare skin in front of him. The flat lines of his stomach, and the curve of his legs that give him the appearance of riding a horse even with nothing under him. There’s a definite problem rising, one Cas prays Dean won’t notice. Which, from how he lies on his back, limbs splayed, shouldn’t be a problem. “Sure, whatever,” he growls, settling onto the floor beside the bed, “sleep however you feel comfortable. Good night, Dean.”
“Hey Jimmy, it’s Cas –“
Dean’s hands hold tight, and Castiel struggles to free himself. When he does, Dean’s fingers squeeze the clownfish.
“Oh, right!” Cas crawls off of the stranger, kicking, and into the sea of manila spread across the sidewalk other pedestrians avoid. They give him and the British Invader a wide berth, knowing if they drifted too far into their orbit it would mean getting involved. “Y’know, usually I’m so careful,” Cas tells him, chuckling, “I’m always focusing on everything because each living thing gives off their own energy and – and it’s so beautiful man, you don’t even know. I do this kind of meditation that helps increase my own personal aura that lets me see what a lot of people don’t. I swear, each time I finish it’s like the colors get brighter and every day is a rainbow!”
Dean returned partway through this struggle. He whistled, slamming the door behind him. “Stripping for the baby?” he chuckled darkly, his eyes dull and his grin vicious, “Not what I imagined when I told you to go nuts with him…” Dean emptied his pockets onto the room’s lone table, tugging his necktie free when done.
, your
thing too far?”
“But he was gone for too long. I was getting antsy, ideas popping up in my head that got more awful as the day wore on. Dad, still fuming, ordered me to quit worrying. ‘Cept I couldn’t, I just wanted to go out and find him. When it was time for bed, that’s when I… digging in my duffel. And his duffel – his duffel…” He chokes on that word, coughing. Dean wipes at barely formed tears. “I hadn’t noticed earlier but I should’ve… it was… Sam’s wasn’t there. He didn’t leave with it so it must’ve been gone earlier, meaning – well, you probably already guessed. I couldn’t… he didn’t even tell… Anyway, dad noticed, too, and…” Dean trails off, swallowed by his suit jacket as he curls forward. His clipped breathing one of many bad omens. He must have been dangling on the edge of this since the beginning, but Dean couldn’t pull himself onto solid ground.
Shaking his head, Castiel breaks from the trance. He calls to Dean. “We best get going,” he says, “There’s much more to see on our journey.”
Castiel waits a long beat before saying, “Radical.” Then they kiss...
Dressed in a pea green suede blazer, salmon button-down, and his cleanest corduroys, Cas waltzed into the Information Center. “Hi,” he said, flashing the pale, platinum blonde behind the front desk a charming grin, “I’m looking for a professor here. A Mr. Pellegrino?”
.” He hated that he’s right. Sam silently gestured his assent to Mia.
Cas pauses, turning to Dean. “Sorry,” he says, “the lady at the counter – she said they were having issues since the last occupants. Something about them breaking the lock?”
jumping the fence. But only because I told Kelly I would do so.”
Two hours later Jack realizes the help he sought wasn't there. Everyone talks in a code Jack doesn't have the drive to pick apart. At some point he might need to, especially if these were the humans he wants to connect with. He'll have time later. What he wants to do, though, is write.
And Castiel, in his stupidity, disregarded her warnings. Waded into her rising tides.
“I know Cas, I

“It’s not like that!” he yells back. Andy grins, winking while giving him a thumbs up before driving off. Cas sighs, a terrible weight settling on his chest. Pinching the stub of his joint, Cas place the unlit grass in his shirt pocket while closing the distance between them. “Kelly,” he says, “it’s been a while.”
It’s strange, seeing Dean carefree in this way. There were no traces of self-destruction or childishness. Instead, it was a more mature expression. Of being at peace. Like all the warring shards of Dean lay their arms down and united towards a common goal. One Sam can get behind, even if he needs time getting used to Dean’s new quirks.
Cas hums a low note as he takes in the room. First at the plastic-covered sofa bracketed by two armchairs, also saran wrapped. He walks past the coffee table with a tasteful array of magazines and studies the furniture. Runs a finger over it and winces when he hears the squeak. There’s barely a speck of dust, a fact he comments on with a snort.
Cas accepts her clue, reading the line where the officer marked the location. Recognizing the area code, he swallows a groan. “I think this might,” he tells her, “thank you, Kelly. Not just for this but for telling me everything. It must have been hard.”
“Perfect.”
“I love you so much.”
“Uh…” Belatedly, Dean realizes his stupidity. His jaw drops, as if he can vacuum the question back. Pretend he never said it. Castiel, looking saintly under the bar’s neon glow, recovers faster. Replies before Dean might withdraw. “Yeah, yes I’m… I’m gay. Be pretty weird if I wasn’t.”
Cas was –
“Yes.”
when you made that e-mail,
“Mr. Zymcka,” Ted Gaines closes a file, smiles, and reaches for Cas’s offered hand. “Please, call me Ted.” He’s shorter than Cas expected, but the added height of his shoe’s heels might sway the contest in his favor. The perfectly coiffed gray hair, stale black suit, and pale, block square jaw unfettered with stubble, however, check off the standard boxes from what Cas knows about schleps in finance.
it for the first time. He bobbed his head around, seeing more than what there was. And the smells were indescribable, though he tried.
Dean nearly forgot. Chuck… if only. His anger would have a target, instead of hanging around him as if it were a fog. Miasma thick he cannot see past a never-ending reel of those few,

options waiting. All because you won’t work with the Empty –“
Andy giggles, scratching his neck. “Noticed he was having trouble walking on the sand so I told him he should take his shoes off… at some point my arms fly and smack into him. He almost hits the surf, but I swoop in last minute, big hero shit. He’s safe but his shoes started new lives with the fishes.” More laughter, “Did you mean what you said? Think either of them have a chance at dropping out?”
“Woah, easy Janet,” her boyfriend said, glancing around the crowded space. He looked very skittish, tan face blanching at the prospect of being noticed. “I know he gave you that low mark, but –“
Cas hums, extracting himself from the other’s hold. “I need some grass.”
“Cas,” Jimmy sighs, Cas already imagining the wrinkles caused by saying his name. “What do you need this time?”
“Different needs, indeed.” Billie sighs, stepping closer. “Might I ask… do you feel that today’s meeting was the right fit for you?”
. Trench coat, suit jacket, and white button-down paired with his crooked blue tie. Dean’s hand drifts close but can’t touch. Not yet. “It is me,” he tells Dean, “you… probably have a lot of questions. About why I’m here, and – and what was said when the Empty…”
“Don’t pin the blame all on me, that message has been in the air for far longer than I’ve known Jack.” Cas waves the digression aside with his hat, refocusing on the meat of their conversation instead of the dripping fat. “If you don’t think his actions were motivated by an economic or educational sense… are you sure there wasn’t anything else you two argued about.”
chance anymore?” Then, with a disturbing amount of severity laced through his voice. “How many more chances are you going to give Dean?”
“My lab partner,” he said, “We bonded over our mutual appreciation of Vince Vincente and the Goonies… there were some days he’d give me the extra sandwich his mom packed, for some reason?”
Once the door shut, Jack returned to his laptop with another idea for a story. Choosing Castiel for a main character, he started writing another short ficlet imagining his father taking time off for himself. Setting down in the Cave and watching a movie or a show. Maybe with a bowl of popcorn and a nice, warm blanket around his shoulders. He worked tirelessly to ensure Jack, Sam, and Dean managed through the days and the moments he had for himself were never truly relaxing.
“Yep.” He pops the ‘p’, scratching Cas’s scalp while stubble scrapes freckled skin. “Think maybe I can get a taste of your candy cane, sunshine?”
“Drugs? At a meeting for…
“All the time,” Dean says, “especially towards the end. Seemed like every little thing would set one off, then the other… and no matter what I tried there was no making peace with either of them. But finally Sam storms through the door too early in the morning, slamming a piece of paper down and going off about new experiences, freedom and…” He slides his hand off the tie, down his chest, and onto his waiting knee. Pressing on it, keeping him from bouncing. “It was an acceptance letter. For college. That… that was one of the scariest moments of my life. Dad nearly had an aneurysm… Sam wouldn’t listen to reason… second dad started raising his voice, he – he just took off. Figured he needed some air; Lord knows the friction in the room made for some awful breathing. I’d’ve gone after him ‘cept dad were looking so cross-eyed I was afraid what might happen if I moved even an inch.” Dean’s twang makes his story sound like a country classic strummed achingly slow on a beat-up Gibson. Cas, not overly fond of the genre, taps his foot along to the tune.
. I’m
“What?”
Sam walks in first with his face hidden behind the porn magazine Jack stole from an all-hours gas station. He joins Jack at the table without noticing he was there. His eyes scan the page thoroughly before flipping over to the next one, a lecherous grin on his face.
“I am your king and you will address me as such,” Charles bellows, voice as thunderous as the actual lightning cracking from above. “Really, Castiel, is this the kind of blobfish you’re running around with? I know our relationship is contentious but you’re too old to still be this rebellious!”
“What?” Dean’s gaze bounced around the room, from Sam to Jack, then Cas, finally returning to Sam. “No, but I… the Internet, mlm is… it stands for…”
There’s much left unsaid before he can begin the process of forgiveness. “You hoped the cops could help, then? Even after Sammy left?”
Chasing the sinewy lines of his savior’s arms to broad shoulders, Dean feels his chest tighten in a desperate need for fresh air. However, it’s not terrifying like before with Roidy. This is unique and comforting. He inhales, then exhales. He has no trouble breathing. He still feels that tightness.
“I’m not in the mood,” she mutters, shuffling over a few inches. “And I don’t have any money.”
. And because of this I only knew of our mom through stories he and, sometimes, Dean would share… but then one day Dean he… he happened to run into her.” He rubbed at his neck, head bowed so the fringe of his bangs shielded his eyes. “And she’s back in our lives. Just like that.”
back. You’re gonna bring them
though. Dammit. “And with the kid kicking, we haven’t even finished our mission.”
The club drops. Sam runs towards Dean, trapping him in his arms. Castiel nearly jumps to his defense, stopping only when he notices the water pooling at Dean’s eyes. Dean sniffs, pulling back. “Sammy, I –“
“What?” Dean hisses, whirling on him, “I thought you promised me you wouldn’t be carrying tonight.”
Castiel hums, rubbing at his jaw. “I’m better than most people,” he says, “I just wish…” He offers Jack a weak smile, opening his book again. “You don’t have to worry about me, that’s my job. You focus on finding a hobby... that's more important.”
He’s unprepared for such freedoms. The simplicity of making a choice. A foreign concept when all your life, every decision was already made for you. For other people. Keys don’t choose which doors they open. Hammers don’t make plans on which nails they’ll hit and which they’ll avoid.
“…Dropped out of college the very next day,” she tells Cas, “Used the money he gave me to pay for an apartment while I took a job as a secretary. Not the life I wanted but… I don’t regret Jack. He was the only good thing to come from the entire ordeal.” Kelly relaxes, legs sliding across the floor until she hits the legs of Cas’s chair. “That’s why whenever Jack asked about his dad I… I lied. Told him he was a soldier, and we were set to marry after he finished up his last tour. But he died overseas, before he was born. I always thought I would carry this to my grave… somehow Jack found out about the bastard.” She pauses, glancing at Cas. “How did
” Dean sunk deeper into his seat, kicking Sam’s abandoned chair. “You have had friends in your life, right? I know I
Dean studies his angel, raising the glass jar to almost eye-level. If he imagines hard enough, Dean can discern features from the cinders and clumps. He tries picturing Cas in his glory, in the moments between battles, in times where Dean’s heart skipped. Visions of the other man, his eyes aglow and jaw unhinged by agony, are what appears. Their freshness overpowers his better memories.
“Well, you’re right,” Dean tells Cas, donning the amulet. His head bows slightly in examination, gently brushing a thumb across its features. “But I didn’t pick this out. Was a
They swim together, hand in hand.
His eyes widen. “What? Why would you…”
annoyed. But Cas crumbles that into a tight little ball and shoves it elsewhere. There were bigger things on his radar than some slight trickery. He needs focus for the mission ahead. Especially since they came upon the very house Claire talked about.
“That is great, Jack,” Dean sighs, “You are the coolest person in the whole universe! There is no one more awesome than you.” He moves to sit, but notices the open magazine where Sam left it. Dean curdles with disgust at the naked woman’s suggestive pose. “Gross! Who left this here? We eat here!”
“I’d rather not –“
He glances at his watch, then above to find the sun’s shuffled further along in its journey.
Marble. Statues are carved from stone – marble, specifically – he remembers from an old teacher’s droned lecture that returned with vengeance. Spoken during a field trip to some museum where Dean barely stayed awake as they flew room to room, always seconds from collapsing, waking momentarily for the next exhibit. Except when they entered a room of statues, and Dean managed fifteen minutes of attentiveness. Aided by chiseled features of a statue hidden between two columns near the farthest corner of the room. A man, naked,
“Me?” Sam scoffs, “Dean, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
A light flickers to life, and Castiel glances around. He frowns, turning to Dean. “This isn’t so bad Dean,” he starts, “My brothers are much messier than this.”
“Cas!”
He already knew what he would be writing about - his fathers were a great source of inspiration. But what would he like to see his fathers doing? This weighs on his mind, a small headache forming at the base of his skull. When he presses against it, kneading it, an image springs to mind. Like Athena from Zeus's head. Immediately he sees all four of them seated around a table playing a board game, laughing and spending time with each other. “Happy,” he decides, “that is how I want to see them.”
“Yeah,” he scoffs, “real bummer. Thousands of miles to see that I’ve already

chose. Saving him won’t absolve you of your own sins.”
That’s why he throws his arms around Castiel’s shoulders, Dean’s mind comforts him with seconds later. For safety. For stability. Since he, too, wasn’t dancing anymore. His legs were useless, bent further than normal. Making him smaller. Forcing him to angle his head upwards to meet his savior’s searching gaze. Lips parted silently, asking a question with the ghost of his breath. Dean thinks he hears an invitation.
treat you to a movie and a candle-lit dinner –“
“Exactly. A complete destruction of the American way of life. Entitled brats, thinking they deserve everything without working for it…”
Circling a low point, Cas sends a last-minute prayer into the universe begging for a sign. She answers with blinding speed, his eyes catching on a little smudge. It bleeds through the box’s edge and muddies the overall image, except peering closely Cas recognizes the wilting shapes of a flower’s petals.
Dean flew forward, cursing under breath. Then muttering prayers how Cas followed his instructions about knocking first. “Gimme a sec, Cas!” Dean tapped his phone, quickly finding the song he downloaded specifically for this moment. Orville Peck’s smooth baritone filtered through speakers he installed earlier, singing ‘Roses Are Falling’. Dean crawls towards the center of his mattress, sitting, cushioned by pillows. Scoops a few petals and peppering his legs with them. “Right!” he calls, stretching languidly, “You can come in!”
Meg snatches the joint back, “I think it’s something you need to find out.”
Experience tells Cas to go with Andy, despite how every fiber in his being wishes that it weren’t the case. “Fine,” he says, leading the younger man out his apartment, “but I can’t promise I’ll behave.”
“Or something like it.” Castiel reaches forward, combing through Dean’s sweaty hair in time with the music. “Hey,” he says, “it’s okay if you are. That you like… that you kissed me. It’s okay.”
“…Yeah.”
“Land.”
Castiel jumps forward and tackles Dean to the ground in another kiss, tangling his hands in Dean’s hair. He drags himself away, grinning overhead. “Dean.”
“Why’s that?”
“Yeah.”
Dean responded with a hefty pout, “I’ve been kinda busy… Is that all you had to say?”
“No…” Sam shifted, discarding the empty bottle on the nearby coffee table. “She died a few days ago, actually.”
“Yeah?”
“What are you thinking then? Revenant? Shifter?”
cheek in retaliation. “Speak for yourself. You might not think it, but Harrison Ford’s breadth of work is phenomenal.”
With how Castiel moves, effortless and graceful, Dean bets he likes dancing. And if Castiel likes dancing, Dean wonders, truly, how bad it can be.
“Stupid pigs,” Cas growled, rubbing filthy hands on his jeans, “think they can do whatever they want because they’ve got a gun. I can get a gun, it’s not that difficult…”
They huddled around Mia in the lobby, at the front desk. She clicked through different tabs on her assistant’s computer. “A while back, we had these teens break in and mess the place up searching for cash, or whatever. I didn’t press any charges – nothing was stolen, and all I had to replace was a window and a few magazines – but Jim didn’t want to come back to work unless I installed some type of security system. I didn’t want to hire someone new so… I caved and got cameras. I never usually bother with them, since they’d do

He’s fought with countless men. Punches and kicks and elbows at throats acceptable foreplay. Love bites that stung far too long, bled too much. Shook hands with many hunters while crossing America during his early years where he was figuring himself out. Their intimidating grip thrilling Dean more than they should while near his father. John’s idea of what makes a man still living in his mind, a shadow that won’t disappear no matter how many curtains he draws or lights he turns on. Persistent.
“I…” Chuck’s eyes glow, his throat seizing as this greater being chokes him. Cas fights past it, coughing. “It’s…
capacity, shadows still clung to his brother’s expression. He couldn’t tell, but there were moments when a fog drifted across his gaze. Cas would look at Sam, and vice versa. Shared concern flitting across the space.
“Well, that’s on you Dean. Remember,” Cas rises, smoothing the ever-present wrinkles on his shirt. He plucks a phrase from his memory and doubles down, taking a spear to the side of this grizzly. “This world, filled with sin, is always waiting with new disappointment. Maybe you’d feel better if you… dropped out of a life where expectations were imposed on you without your consent. It sure does feel good.” While biting, Cas feels his own skin boil from the fleeting admission. Scanning the man across from him, he thinks the momentary lapse in guard went unnoticed.
Now that freedom is truly his, what will he do? How will he end? Will he become someone he doesn’t like? Will people he thought would stay forever slip out of his grasp? Does he go first and leave so many people behind?
He hurries into his car, starting the engine. Glancing at his rearview mirror, Cas checks the color of the sky. Doing so only takes a few seconds, but his stare lingers. Away from the cloudless blue and towards a captivating black shape perched nearby.
Dean waited for the signal from Jack, a small thumbs up, and then he cleared his throat. “Okay, so here’s why scamming is a right for the gays and the gays alone…”
“…Cas?”
He swallows another mouthful, chuckling. “I guess I could load up a bowl,” he says, “but I thought you said you wanted to talk…?”
“Is part of it.”
“Jack,” Castiel winks and shoots an imaginary gun at him, “You are the best son in the world and deserve all the cookie flavored cereal!”
“Please, don’t –“
Gazing up at grand villa, leaning on his car’s roof, he applauds himself for the initiative of changing on the way over.
They didn’t have any. Dean asked for a vodka neat, Sam criticizing his choice as the bartender retreated. “You’re so boring.” That was three vodka neats ago.
He bristles at the soft tenor of his voice. “I’m

“What?” Dean followed his stare, brows scrunched in confusion, “my shoes?”

in Hawaii, and then shipped elsewhere? Can you imagine it – shirt factories, dotting the beaches? Oh, I’d hope the workers making all these Hawaiian shirts are at least being paid a fair wage, given how popular they seem to be…”
“No,” Cas shuffled forward, twisting the bandana in his hands, “I want to see how this looks on you…” He pulled the green fabric taut, wrapping the thick line around Dean’s head. Deftly tied it, then freed Dean’s strangled bangs so they could fall across his face again. Cas leapt backwards, inspecting the addition. Dean glowered heavily, but it did not distract from the overall look. “We might make a hippie out of you yet, Dean Winchester,” Cas chuckled, gaze roving ever downward. Taking in the rest of his outfit for the full effect. The wardrobe Cas stuffed in Dean’s arms; that he begrudgingly wore. A wrinkled t-shirt with Mary Jane’s scribbled all over courtesy of a stoned, bored Andy. The capped sleeves clung tight, showcasing amazing biceps the detective hid with ill-fitting suits. And Cas’s

. A young kid, barely old enough for all the hair on his uncovered chest and looking like every other white boy who washes up on their shores from the East. Andy talks up a chick with burnt red locks tied in a complicated braid. Leaning on the side of his van, one hand brushing at the freckles on her shoulder while the other tugs on the split ends tickling his neck. The back of his van is open, and Cas sees the makeshift bed. They lock eyes, Andy winking. Cas nods and carries on as his neighbor seals the deal. Andy needs a little fun if he’ll be camping in his van for the next few days.
There were more pressing matters at hand. Like Kaia, the most recent addition to their group. Finished with her cereal, she carried the empty bowl over and dropped it into an overflowing sink. Ran the water during beats where neither he nor Dean spoke. Careful, like she was listening. “Kaia,” Cas looks at her, “you have anything you want to add?”
“Hey, Castiel?”
Castiel ignores the last comment, joining Dean on the bed. “We do… although, I will admit to have struggled with it in my life. I’ve never really gotten sarcasm, which at times both delighted and exasperated my family.”
Dean deflated, anger whooshing out of him like a burst balloon. “It’s nothing.”
“There’s nothing else you’re keeping from me?”

“Another lesson my boy,” Charles says, turning his back on them, “the ocean is no place for humans. Now come along.”

“Although,” Dean chuckled, “it still feels like it was only yesterday.” His chest puffed up, goaded by the reproachful glance Sam shot his way. “What? It’s what I’m
Mia’s journal was open again and rapidly taking notes, her attention diverted towards Dean. “I’m guessing that’s not how you’re feeling about all this, then?”
He’s not far from his apartment. Climbing the steps, Cas sees a figure waiting. Leaning on the bannister across from his door. Cas rubs at his eyes, convinced he must be hallucinating. Thoughts taking on human form after he spent the past few hours driving aimlessly around while his brain spun crazy theory after crazy theory about him. Each one made the little ticker beating inside his chest hurt more.
“I can take care of myself.”
“I didn’t” Cas tells him, tongue curdling from the acid in his tone, “It’s Will. Will Bexler. I’m writing a –“
He slips the photo back where he found it. Cas came looking for clues, and that certainly was not it. Although seeing the picture reignites his long-dead curiosity about the other man. How could a bashful, little boy turn into a steely detective? Is he still a momma’s boy? And Cas didn’t know Dean had a brother.
He forces a smile onto his face, more like a wince than anything. “He’s… rough around the edges; surly. Especially after he’s had a couple of drinks. Dad and
…” he drawls, dragging the ‘o’. His ‘e’ rising half an octave as he fries the word.
“I’m sorry about your money,” Dean said, walking off, “I’ll see what I can do, if after booking or… whatever. Get home safely!”
“Let me guess,” Cas says, rising, “it’s that same building you and I were camped outside of. The one that
Castiel drags him into a kiss, one Dean returns heartily. His hands grabbing fabric while Castiel’s dance around his hips. Consumed by this, Dean ignores his cell phone being stolen. Only becomes aware of it when Castiel ends their goodbye with a smile, Dean’s phone in hand actively calling someone. “My number,” he explains, flipping his phone shut, “to use whenever. Hopefully
“I’m just asking,” Adam says, “guessing, actually, if your hesitation during this process has something to do with my gender expression.” He rubs at his biceps, fondling them. “So I’ll ask again – have you ever been massaged by a man.”
. “I don’t know how the answers got in my bag, honest!” he says, frantically searching the room. His gaze lands on Cas; anxiety bleeding into a cool irritation. “Dude,” he says, “did you kick me?”
Jack’s face hurts from how wide his smile gets. Then Dean clears his throat and thanks him. “Although I hope this means you’re done using your powers on us?”
Chuck vanishes, leaving Cas there. On the ground, physically. Mentally, spiritually, he’s adrift in the unknown. Floating towards an ending he always knew waited for him. An ending that he
Is this still a dream, he asks himself. Did I actually wake up? Dean waits, hovering near the doorknob. Remembers rushing last time, what waited there then. What he almost threw himself onto. Cycles through who might be waiting now. Something worse, a more terrifying monster. Or maybe mundane, like the motel manager. He’ll never know if he drags it out. Whether that’s motivation or warning, Dean can’t decide. What he does choose is flinging open that door and facing whoever was there.

experience.”
Standing, Cas deems the raid on Jack’s room over. He then starts on erasing any evidence that he was there. Fixing pillows, gathering the slides and stuffing them back inside the envelope. Resealing it, however, Cas notices an important clue that he overlooked. Kicks himself for ignoring it.
“When I could, I guess.”
“No!”
“Family expects a lot from you?”
“I didn’t leave.”
“Come
“I doubt this small enclave is where you originated from,” Castiel starts, “And you seem sad and wistful… like you’re missing something. This island is not where you wish to be.”
“I fuck guys,” he says, “sometimes I get
Sammy,” Dean says. Louder, rougher. Shattering the eerie silence of this deserted city scape. “He made a deal with that damned thing, his life for… for…”
Jack considers a movie theater, but trashes the idea almost immediately. “We have Netflix,” he says, “why would we go out to the theaters?” Then he thinks about sharing a meal, reminded of all the times they sat in diners. “But we do that all the time… I want it to be
Cas winced, “I… I called for you?”
Which brings him to the present, where Dean and Castiel solidify their feelings once more through kisses. Castiel crowds Dean against the counter, both growing bolder and louder. They still haven’t realized Jack watches them, tearing at their clothes as if inside their bedroom and not the communal kitchen.
“In about every town I moved to in the past two years.” Mia sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose as she wandered towards the fireplace. He watched her grab a box of cigarettes and a lighter from atop it. “Mind if I?”
“Yucky!” Dean hisses, “I think I am going to faint…”
“No, I can’t,” Castiel says, “not until you have a tight grip. Otherwise they’ll slip away.” He hopes Dean won’t argue, too tired to force Dean into following. If the fish escape he won’t chase after them. Dean is a grown merman, he can catch his own food. But he doesn’t have to if he does what Castiel says.
Snorting, Cas picks at where his shorts rode up. “Something we can agree on.”
The closer he gets, the more he sees what Dean does. Gasps when he notices the flashing light hiding in the darkness. “Dean, no!” His hand shoots out, reaching for the other. Dean’s tail flips wildly, making it difficult to grab. Castiel does, tugging him to stop.
“Yes, well, I find a lot of how therapists and therapy is portrayed on film leaves much to be desired…” She shifted, throwing a leg over her knee and laying a notebook she pulled from elsewhere on her lap. “Among other things.” She spoke so quietly, Sam almost missed it. “Anyway,” she cleared her throat, “before we get into our session, I do want to mention that even though I am a therapist, my specialization is in helping patients overcome grief-related trauma relating to deaths of loved ones. Is that okay, Mr…?”
