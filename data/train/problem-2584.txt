Mycroft lifted a hand in his direction. “Sit down. I’ll make it.”
“Unless she’s anything like her father.” Roger piqued up.
“I’m sure my mother would love that.” Sherlock sighed. “A date can be arranged.”
” He could practically hear the raised eyebrow. There was a continuous shuffling of clothes that suggested he was bouncing Maeve up and down with one hand while holding the phone with his other.
The lift was still waiting as they approached and Anthea stepped forward; assuring that people knew that they were intended to get in, a young man, a nurse, put him arm in front of the door with a polite smile. Anthea returned the smile. It was a well-practiced smile, something she was used to in her line of work, liaising with some of the most powerful people in the world. They stepped inside and turned, to face the doors as they closed, sealing them inside.
"Maeve doesn't think so" John told him as he picked up the squirming baby from her pram and brought her close to his chest.
“Precisely,” Mycroft pocketed his phone and stood up straight.
“That was nice of you Sherlock.” Mrs Hudson told him with the look one might give a dog that followed an order and got a treat in return.
“Useless chatter. Speeches. Some sort of auction where people compete to be the higher bidder to seem the most charitable. Dinner. Dancing. It’s all dreadfully dull.”
Interesting.
Greg nodded in answer.
“Why?”
“I’m putting my daughter down for a nap, what are you doing?”
“I should be returning to work soon,” Mycroft announced, still not bothering to look up from his paper.
“Not anymore.”
John smiled.
John struggled to keep up with his flatmate as he strode down the street. He was half-jogging to keep up with the long legged detective as he pushed the purple pram with great ease and care. He moved as though the pram was a part of him with graceful movements and simple flicks of his wrist to manoeuvre the pushchair. The ex-army doctor managed to keep pace but barely.
Maeve growled in annoyance.
“It is imperative that nobody speaks during the call,” Mycroft instructed the room.
Mycroft acknowledged him with a smile but turned towards the pair behind him. “You’ve yet to meet, John these are my parents, Siger and Violet Holmes; mummy, father, this is Doctor John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.”
Mycroft leaned in close and whispered, “ok?”
Sherlock fixed his brother with a dark look. “She’s noticed my absence.”
Mrs Hudson was visiting her sister and John on a date with the woman with bottle blonde hair that he met a Scotland Yard the day before. The consulting detective sighed, rising to his feet in a matter of seconds, stepping over the table and rushing down the stairs – his red dressing gown billowing behind him dramatically.
“You need to get out of the house.” Mycroft told him, “A walk in the park should suffice.”
“Yes, but when she is older and needs nagging to complete homework and eat vegetables and go to bed, you cannot expect me to do that.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “shut up John.”
“If it’s not too much bother.” Mycroft added with a slight smile.
“It’s only temporary,” Sherlock looked over his shoulder at the blonde.
Sherlock snapped the book shut, eyes flicking to his mother. “Why are you here?”
“Exactly, the owner called us, some PCs checked the scene and found a body out back.”
“I take it my brother does not approve of this attire,” Mycroft said with a small grim smile.
“I need to look over the files again.”
Mycroft remained stoic and continued to smile at his niece, she gurgled but didn’t return his smile, instead focusing on shoving her hand into her mouth. He commented, “She is rather like you.”
“Good.” Turning gracefully, he lifted up Maeve as John offered her to him. He instinctively brought her close, inhaling against her hair like he had done earlier. The scent was reassuring.
“Yes,” Sherlock muttered. His eyes flicking over her. “Is it nice?”
“Wow, that’s kind of you.” John cleared his throat.
“I thought,” he lowered his voice and He peeled his sweaty palms apart, placing his hands on his knees, and tapping out Frédéric Chopin’s Nocturne in B-Flat Minor, a favourite of his when he was younger. He hunched forward on the table, licking his lips quickly, his throat suddenly dry. “I thought that we’d taken all necessary precautions.”
“There is no possible way to stay mad at her,” he groaned dramatically.
“Boys, can’t you behave for a moment?” Greg asked. His face was alight with happiness and amusement, it was almost sickening.
Sherlock huffed. “I am running some very important experiments.”
Sherlock shook his head. “I-She’s back now.”
“Nothing.” Greg cleared his throat.
“Are you going to say hello to your grandma?” She spoke to Maeve in a softer tone.
Sherlock took a long breath.
“Talked no, deduced.”
“I’ll inform them when she is safe and in your arms.” He promised.
“Possibly.”
“Later.”
Sherlock came out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. He dressed in silence while Mycroft dried Maeve off and put copious amounts of cream on her red flesh, put her in a new nappy and a sleepsuit. He wordlessly handed her over to his younger brother the moment he was done and retrieved the soft bristled brush from the counter. Sherlock took it and brushed his daughter’s hair, pushing the strands forward.
“Bastard.” John muttered beneath his breath. Sherlock heard and smiled. John smiled too, he couldn’t stop himself.
Mrs Hudson appeared sometime later with her own presents. It was a bundle of hand knitted jumpers, cardigans and toys. The boys had bought her a new scarf, brooch and a framed picture of her and Maeve.
“If you can contain yourself -” Mycroft began in a hushed whisper. “- for the entire ceremony, I will allow you a free pass, so to speak.”
“Yeah, just peachy.” He struggled to keep a grip on her while her eyes wandered over all the new things, the buildings, the people, everything. He shifted her down slightly and gave him her hand, something for her to focus on, and she did just that, grasping two of his fingers in her fists and examining his hand as though it was the most interesting thing.
“What?” Sherlock practically jumped up. “Why would you say that?”
“You’ll bring him back for us,” she pleaded, eyes still full of tears, “you understand, you’re a father yourself, you must understand.”
“He’s in bad shape,” Greg told them, “we haven’t been able to get anything out of him yet.”
“You are tonight.”
“Did Mycroft bail you out?”
John put up the umbrella and pulled Maeve’s hood over her face. Then, he replaced Sherlock’s coat, pulling it over her small body and the umbrella high for a moment. Sherlock said something but Harry couldn’t quite make it out. John nodded and lifted the umbrella away from his partner, they took off across the street, her brother just keeping up with the taller man.
Sherlock nodded. “Ok.”
“It’s no hardship to sacrifice my time for her.”
“Maeve was restless.” He gave in explanation.
“Any reason you’re sitting here?” John asked.
“Slight raised temperature.”
“Sherlock,” he said with a sigh.
Sherlock lent down and kissed her cheek. He reached into his bag and produced some food wrapped in oil dotted paper. He handed it to her. “Goodnight Mrs Hudson.”
“Yes, she’s adorable, we are well aware.” Sherlock yawned as he entered the room, his eyes flicking over Anthea and Mycroft in a matter of seconds before landing on the back of the bouncy chair. He wore a pair of thin pyjamas, the top inside out and his hair was damp with sweat and sticking to his forehead.
The baby in her arms was chewing his fingers into a mess of salvia a snot.
Siger nodded and Sherlock allowed himself to relax slightly into the uncomfortable hospital bed.
“I can leave, I don’t want to wake her up.”
John did as instructed and took the offered seat, leaving one between him and Mycroft for Sherlock.
Mycroft stepped out and onto the pavement in one fluid movement. His grey eyes scanning over everyone on the pavement with a harsh ferocity and settling on his brother, he stopped in front of him. “What do we know?”
There was no answer.
“Have you been to Brighton before?” John asked.
,” Jim explained as though it was the simplest thing on earth. “
“Child abandonment” Greg offered in explanation, pulling his notebook and pen from his coat pocket. He opened it to the correct page and read. “New-born baby abandoned, found on a doorstep. The hospital phoned.”
“You don’t celebrate Christmas.”
“Expensive.” Sherlock muttered as an afterthought.
Molly finds out.
“You need to open your mouth a little wider,” John told her with a grin.
John added, “or her, this our life, not ashamed.”
“Mycroft.” Sherlock muttered.
Siger nodded in acknowledgement, “Mycroft was telling me about an experiment you were doing together the other day, care to tell me about it?”
Violet watched him walk away and sighed to herself as she continued to bounce the baby up and down slightly. She forced back the slight feeling of dread creeping up on her and stepped back into the drawing room. “Sorry.” She told them politely.
“I’m your favourite.” There was wonder in her tone.
The mousy blonde smiled and stepped closer to the pram, peering it at Maeve with a expression of awe and amazement, Sherlock glanced up to watch her in interest. It was far more interesting than the body at least, Molly spoke aloud, "she really is something special."
He closed his eyes and felt John’s hand slide down his shoulder and onto his arm.
“Shit.” John repeated.
“Do you think you could show us?”
“Tummy time.” He offered, stretching his neck backwards to look at the Detective inspector.
“Edmund is just saying,” Aunt Petunia piped up.
He shook his head. “He listened to the radio.”
“Well, make sure you say goodbye before you leave.”
She looked up at him with wide blue eyes, pleading for him to go on.
“She is a little girl, Sherlock.”
“No, it feels better.”
“Well you’re the one talking to a baby as though she were an adult.” Victor said and for a moment, it was as though they were at university again. The effortless banter of close friends flowing once more.
“We’re taking a bit of a break,” Greg said sheepishly, he scratched the back of his head and look at the floor.
“Where are you going?” John called after him.
“It’s hardly a difficult brewing process.”
John nodded.
John picked up the clean muslin from the arm of his chair and held it out to the taller man. Sherlock took it from him and wiped her face methodically, removing all traces of tears, snot and drool. When he was satisfied he sat down, leaving the muslin on his leg which he bounced impatiently as he settled Maeve into a slightly more comfortable position so that he could hold her with one arm. He placed the other on the arm of his chair and looked at Victor expectantly, “and?”
Donovan had been collecting statements all afternoon and Anderson running forensics, he’d had a call from Sherlock about a possible lead but there had been nothing else, no time or place. He’d tried calling back but the consulting detective had been screening his calls all day, he’d tried John but he was at the clinic.
“But you’re a graduate chemist,” John voiced.
“Take your time, I’ll put her down for a nap in a minute.”
He was no stranger to death.
John raised an eyebrow in surprise but nodded stoically. “I should get some stuff.”
“You wouldn’t get far” Sherlock warned, blinking past the pain and watching her intently as Maeve continued to wail in the bedroom. “John is ex-military and my brother runs the government, you’d disappear long before going to prison.”
The older man shifted the infant so that her legs were either side of his body and her hands were clutching at his shirt on his chest and back, her eyes wandering over her uncle as though he were the most interesting thing she'd seen all day and he was. “Leaving us to it, then.” He said with a smile.
“Everything is taken care of,” Anthea informed him.
John snorted.
The officer nodded wildly.
Mrs Hudson poured the tea and then gestured to Maeve. “Can I hold her?”
She replied with a babble-like sound.
Sherlock snorted, “My brother was sixteen John, and he had the money but not the means to bail me out.”
He took another step closer to the crib so that he was stood beside it, hovering, craning his back so that he was watching his sleeping daughter from a horizontal angle. Her hand was balled into a fist, resting beside her face. He blinked, letting his eyes close leisurely. He moved his hand. He opened his eyes and reached towards her, using his index finger and the skin of her hand. It was warm. Warmer than he’d been expecting. He let his finger roam gently over her thumb, each finger, and then the small bit of palm that he could reach with her hand balled into a fist. He kept his touches light, feather light, so he was just ghosting the skin, unwilling to wake her.
There was no way.
Hope you guys enjoy this chapter :)
He was the iceman after all.
“She’s calmer.” John nodded towards Maeve.
“…I know.” Sherlock finished for him twisting his neck to gaze at the blonde.
“You shouldn’t bother.”
The young officer shook his head, “a reporter was fishing but I sent him away.”
“Shit” He cursed.
“I’m fine,” the consulting detective dismissed quickly, glancing at the sleeping baby nuzzled protectively against his chest with her small head leaning on his collar bone as she snored softly; undisturbed by the pained sound and slight movement.
“You wouldn’t stop him from seeing her.” John said quickly. Sherlock could be cruel but it was an act.
“Are you sure he won’t mind?” Violet asked. It’s not that she doubted John, she was just worried.
Harold cleared his throat. “Do you think that’s a possibility people using her to get to you?”
Sherlock nodded and handed her over, wary of the vomit on her clothes. John took her from the younger man and placed her with her back to his chest and watched as Sherlock retrieves a pack of disinfectant wipes from the bag and wiped down the changing table. When he was finished he placed a clean muslin on it and allowed John to lay her down. She gave an impatient gurgle and Sherlock stripped her methodically, careful not to spread any of the sick onto her skin and when he did – on her leg and around her neck – he wiped it away with smooth quick movements.
“You know her mother.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and focused his attention on John’s parents. He flashed a small fake smile. “Mycroft Holmes.”
She whined, the sound high and quite loud for her. Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise. She didn’t like being woken up much, they had that in common. New-born babies were only awake 10% of the time. He kept up with the movement of his finger on his face.
“All necessary parts.”
“And you think Greg will ask you to work the case?” John asked, then sighed and continued, “of course he will. He’ll want this whole thing dealt with as quickly as possible.”
“Hello,” John smiled. He loved these moments. The ones where Sherlock was caught off guard and confused, his eyes softened and his face didn’t catch up with his mind for a brief moment, he looked like a child with his hand in the biscuit tin, caught out by a parent.
“If you need anything,” she said, still smiling but obviously disheartened. And with that she disappeared.
Sherlock looked up at the bags on the table. “Numbing gel, teething pads and rings. Ice.”
“I am a little…unprepared.” He admitted, standing up.
“And you’re a liar Sherlock Holmes.”
“I’ve sent someone.” Mycroft told him.
They left the room and Sherlock released a breath. John placed a hand on his shoulder and rubbed gently.
Mycroft’s eyes flicked over his niece. Greg said, “You managed to settle her.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Mycroft.” John nodded.
“Eloquent as always,” he frowned and took the seat opposite. It struck him how much he sounded like Sherlock but he shook the thought from his head. “And that, is my daughter.”
“That’s how you know so much about mulled wine.”
John pocketed his phone and went into the kitchen. Teas, tea would be good.
“Clue?” Sally repeated, unsure.
“No.”
“John.” His sister looked up from her hands and her small smile dropped.
Sherlock hummed in response, “Through the Looking Glass.”
Sherlock was wearing only a beige dressing gown, sticking to his still wet body and Maeve was wearing the same. An almost exact copy of his, though she had a nappy underneath. John was making breakfast. The blonde had a top and his pyjama bottoms on, greying hair mussed from sleep.
The car they hired was a limo with a driver, according to Sherlock’s mother it was ‘easier’ and the cheaper alternative. Sherlock didn’t put up a fight, he just put Maeve in the car seat and slid in beside her.
“I think she was a little bit excited to see her Daddy.” John commented, cocking his head to the side with a small smile. It seemed alien, the word Daddy falling so effortlessly from anyone’s lips but his own. Mycroft smirked and Sherlock’s eyes flicked to the army doctor.
“Uh-huh.” John went to continue walking.
“You’re a child,” John muttered as he walked out of the room.
Sherlock takes some responsibility and gives his baby a name.
“Well, that told us didn’t it.” John said to Maeve. She hit his chest with her fist. “Come on then.”
“I hardly think the bathroom is appropriate,” Sherlock quipped.
There was no answer.
“Father found you then.” Mycroft’s lips pulled into a half-smile.
“I will call our parents at a more suitable time.”
“There are” Sherlock agreed. “Pink will of course make an appearance in her wardrobe but in small doses.”
“She thought you were interest in her.”
Silvia nodded.
This took forever; I've spent the whole day on the last half of this chapter, an absolute nightmare and still not sure if I'm happy with it. Also, this week has been super busy.
“How did you do that?” Harold asked.
“Is it?” Sherlock asked, Lestrade hated paperwork especially where he and John were concerned.
John struggled to contain his laughter. “No you don’t. You love me.”
“Fine.” Sherlock reaffirmed. “We’ve been working a case.”
“You don’t need to do that.”
His mother appeared at the end of the hallway. A small smile on her lips.
“Well” Greg interrupted, not wanting to watch much more of this strange exchange between the doctor and detective. They were like an old married couple. “Sorry to break it to you, but Maeve isn’t allowed on the crime scene. I’m surprised you even let her out of the house.”
Mycroft raised one eyebrow.
“Yes.”
“Domestic life too boring for you brother mine?”
“Are you ok?” John asked into the darkness.
“The house is abandoned, it’s been used by homeless people as a lodge for quite some time, any evidence would be contaminated.” Sherlock placed a hand on his hip.
“But-”
“You have a point,” John conceded, turning onto his back. Sherlock followed and wrapped his limbs around the shorter man like an octopus. “Tomorrow: back to London.”
“Would you like me to call a doctor?” She was on her feet and at his side in a second. Eyes running over the baby and her boss.
“Yes, well,” Anthea shrugged, “there are worse choices.”
“Your middle name is childish.”
“Let’s go for a walk” Sherlock told Maeve.
“Every doctor needs a good set of equipment.” Sherlock frowned. “Innuendo not intended.”
“I wounded my pride John,” Sherlock admitted with a sigh of defeat.
“The loss is Evelyn’s not mine.” He admitted. “I’m not the one that will grow up without a mother.”
It was like water off the ducks back to Sherlock.
Maeve grunted in response. Her sleep misted eyes flicking to meet his then back down to his shirt, which she clutched in her small fists. He held her with one hand and stroked her with his free hand, running his hand over the soft strands. If she were capable, she would have purred, instead she leaned into the touch and released a content sigh.
“Ok, I get that but it’s just a colour. It doesn’t have to define her.”
“It’s lovely, we’ve met Sherlock’s brother and a lovely detective inspector.” Silvia added.
Anthea added, “She is unharmed.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and flicked over the baby in his brothers arms in more detail, taking longer and more detailed observations before flicking over Mycroft who was still not wearing his jacket, waistcoat or tie. If that wasn’t unnerving enough, the sight of him with a baby in his arms was enough to make him go into shock, he didn’t show it. His lips tightened slightly.
“I don’t remember everything,” Sherlock argued.
,” he said the word with quiet disgust, “you. And Jade will be happy you’re back, that cat loves you, the stupid thing. And you can sleep for as long as you like, and help Daddy with a new case, finding someone like when you were lost…” he cleared his throat and looked up.
“Is there anyone else I can call for you?”
Sherlock hurried from the building. His eyes fixed ahead and grip on his daughter secure, holding her bum and head to keep her close to his body. He could feel her breathing against him and the soft growl she released as their bodies jostled with each step. He passed two of Mycroft’s men, who nodded and held the door open for him. He stepped out and quickly blinked to adjust to the light.
Anthea scrolled for a moment. “There doesn’t seem to be needed for concern just yet if there are any further symptoms contact a doctor or go straight to the hospital. Until then, keep a close eye on her.”
“Take her with me” Sherlock answered immediately. His mother looked horrified. “I wouldn’t allow her to be taken onto a crime scene, Lestrade or Donovan would watch her while I take a look at the scene.”
“I kept him alive for you,” Sebastian told them.
“You come in like you own the place, you can make your own tea.”
“I do not say no to everything.”
“Well, I’m sure she’d love it if she could understand what it is.” John quipped.
“It started as a murder but turned out to be far more interesting.”
“It’s too early for that isn’t it?” Greg asked.
Sherlock’s head shot up at this, his eyes cold. The thought of his parents raising her made his stomach churn, they’d done such a great job with him and Mycroft, it would just be their second chance. He hissed. “They can’t have her.”
Sherlock sighed. “If I’m Scrooge then Mycroft is Jacob Marley.”
“You don’t have to eat anymore.” He said as though he was talking to a small child.
“Grandmother Christine was kind and accepting of all, she somehow raised out father and deserves to be remembered for that.” Sherlock explained coldly, keeping his hold on Maeve tight as he jiggled her up and down slightly. He added as an after note, sounding like a child. “And she liked bees.”
“Yes.”
“I should clean up,” the consulting detective changed the subject.
“Not for that,” John sighed. “I want to check your back.”
“She can sleep in my bed. As long as we set up the pillows to keep her from falling out or rolling over and set up a camera to monitor her.” Sherlock explained, rising to his feet.
“I had the ….pleasure of bumping into her earlier.” Mycroft flashed a slimy smile.
“She’s almost…unnerving,” Siger said after a few moments.
Neither John or Lestrade answered, they didn’t have to. The question was rhetorical, Sherlock was using them as a sound board nothing more, and even if they wanted to answer they couldn’t. It wasn’t possible.
“Yes…” Siger prompted, a small smile forming on his lips.
I feel like I'm constantly apologising.
John nodded. “He’s worried and that’s perfectly normal.”
Sherlock cast a doubtful look at her.
“So tonight is dictated by Mycroft?”
Sherlock raised both eyebrows and let the subject drop, he continued walking with Samantha following a step or two behind him, and he told her simply “No wife, or girlfriend, the mother is out of the picture.”
“Freeze.” A new voice shouted. Lestrade.
“And what are they doing now?”
Maeve slightly in her sleep and Sherlock trailed two of his fingers over her cheek, forehead and through her thickening hair. She sighed but remained asleep.
“She seems…”
Sherlock shook his head but didn’t falter in his movements, “Lestrade texted about a crime scene, John is already on route.”
They had stopped at a café and were now indulging in a cream tea.
“White chocolate and raspberry brownies?” He asked hopefully.
“You are awful.” Violet declared, she swatted her son’s leg playfully.
“I’m going to have a bath.” Sherlock stood up.
“Shhh.” He soothed, rocking back and forth as he kept his voice as low as possible.
“You miss it.” Sherlock said outright.
Sherlock huffed a breath and glanced over to the pram by the doors, Maeve was sleeping soundly and completely unaware of the scene change. Molly Hooper was lingering between the body and the pram, trying to keep an eye on him while watching Maeve sleep. She was wearing a hideous oatmeal cardigan with flowers and cut off chinos, her dark blonde hair typed back in a plait that was hooked over one shoulder.
“I’m not
“And you.”
“I would like that.” John nodded.
“The proof was left on my doorstep two days later, DNA testing proves she is mine, if there was any doubt.”
She stopped and sighed.
Sherlock looked bored by the suggestion but his father nudged his father and he quickly faked a smile at his mother. He managed, “It sounds…lovely.”
“Yes, yes very funny.” Sherlock declared annoyed as John and Siger laughed at a story that Violet was telling, struggling to tell as she chuckled.
Thirty-Six:  Sherlock returns and take a case; a string of kidnapped rich kids and if the ransom isn't paid quick enough, they die.
“Are your parents not an option?” Greg tried. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Of course they’re not.”
“The bottles are sterilised.” Mycroft added as an afterthought.
No small talk today then.
Sherlock’s eyebrows went up and back down quicker than a blink.
Greg opened his mouth to protest but Sherlock had already started striding away, he resigned himself to failure and sighed. John smiled weakly at his friend and fumbled to pick up the changing bag and carseat, he told him “I’ll get him to text you when he’s settled down.”
She frowned and attempted to push herself forward.
“She’s more aware now.” He answered, eyes flicking between the two brothers. “She won’t understand but she will be in distress.”
Sherlock attempted and failed to look over his shoulder.
“To tell us that she’s alright.”
“Bless you.”
“In various shapes and forms.” The blonde smiled.
Violet was dabbing at Mycroft’s chest, spreading the mess more than anything while the auburn haired man looked to be on his last nerve, face red. “Stop moving.” His mother commanded.
Sherlock was sure his cheeks were red now. “I-”
Harold seemed startled by the question but nodded. Sherlock rose to his feet, elegant despite the stones, and placed Maeve in his arms. He held her for a moment before bringing her close.
Sherlock typed a response at rapid speed.
He lifted Maeve and the car seat out of the cab and into Sherlock’s waiting arms. Then he climbed out of the cab. He gave Sherlock a pointed look, “what’s wrong with you?”
The auburn haired man nodded and refocused his attention on his niece, craning his neck to look down at her. She smiled up at him. He smiled back and picked up the bottle to show her, her eyes narrowed and her smile dropped slightly, replaced by a look of anticipation. He placed the bottle back on the table for a moment and shifted her into the correct position, cradled in one arm and picked it back up, popping the lid off with one finger and offered it to her. He guided the teat into her mouth and she suckled from it hungrily.
John nodded and went upstairs, in slow sure movements.
The scene before them was one from a horror movie. The room was in shambles, glass shattered across the floor and furniture overturned, complete disarray. The victim, a woman in her late twenties, positively identified as one Amanda Fowler, the woman who has called the police was on the wall. Her body was stripped of clothing and she was attached to the wall via thick iron needles through her hands and feet. Her head was bowed, throat slit and the source of the blood that had oozed over her body, down the wall and pooled on the floor beneath her. And the question on everyone’s mind was: How could one person achieve this and escape in twelve minutes?
“It has begun,” Sherlock muttered to himself, steepling his fingers and moving them to rest beneath his chin as he listened the footsteps of his mother and father.
“I was being presumptuous” The blonde declared, forking a piece of chicken along with his pasta and putting it into his mouth, he chewed delicately as Sherlock watched him intently.
“Of course.”
Maeve gargled.
“Want me to make it?” He asked, glancing over his shoulder at the dark haired man.
They stayed like that for five minutes, enjoying the muffled silence of the bathroom, one hand linked and the other, holding her stomach to keep her upright while she played with the sponge with her free hand, fingers squeezing the pink sponge, as she watched, fascinated. Maeve was not crying anymore but every so often she released a soft whine or whimper in pain.
John retrieved the present.
He stopped a few paces in front of her and watched as she noticed his expensive shoes on the road that she was engrossed in and her eyes darted to him, completely alert and curious. Sherlock feigned an expression of shock, mouth opening into a large O shape, and was resulted with the most wonderful and unexpected reaction, a toothless grin followed by a delightful giggle. It was a beautiful sound lasting only a few seconds that brought a smile of astonishment, pride and happiness to her father’s face.
“She’s doing more than asking,” Mycroft raised an eyebrow at the blonde man.
“More?” Sherlock moaned.
It seemed quite content, so fed and changed recently before being left here. A hat on its head. Pink. A girl then. A small wisp of dark hair peeking from beneath the knitted hat, curled slightly and eyebrows dark, like her lashes. Eyes blue, deep blue, bright. Most babies had blue eyes though, not a clue.
“Twenty-three days.” Violet told them, beaming as the crying faded into small sniffles. “It all happened rather suddenly.”
Sherlock mocked offence at the accusation and raised an eyebrow curiously, he countered “you were the one that came into my flat to cause trouble.”
“What? You think this is sibling rivalry?” John asked, his attention completely on the baby in his arms.
“Of course.” Mycroft repeated like it was the most obvious thing on earth.
Sherlock glared at him. The blonde took the buggy and with a quick goodbye to his colleagues followed the taller man from the building. Sherlock relaxed the moment he was outside, not completely relaxed but definitely more relaxed than he had been a minute ago. There was still tension in his shoulders but he released a long breathe that he hadn’t realised that he’d been holding. The women John worked with were insipid, most women in general were, fawning over Maeve and him.
“Good, yes, that’s good.” She nodded. His mother was obviously confused, too much planning.
“Ok, that’s better than crying at least.” John said aloud, more to himself than anybody else.
that I am clean.” Sherlock snapped. “I’m sure Mycroft would have told you otherwise.”
Violet nodded and set herself about preparing one while Arabella asked. “Where is that dashing soldier of yours then?”
“And how long am I…privileged with your company?”
“Yes.” John answered.
Sherlock nodded, “The dress is…impractical.”
“There is a lot to think about here” Greg told him calmly. “A baby will completely disrupt your life.”
“But he’s been killing them.”
Mycroft nodded and observed, “You are barking orders tonight, brother mine.”
“Babies are so messy,” Anthea spoke up after a few long minutes of silence. She was sat on the opposite side of the desk with her arms on it, lent forwards with her eyes fixed firmly on the baby.
“Perfect,” Sherlock answered honestly.
“Yes, just in time.”
Sherlock sighed and looked around the flat, there on the kitchen table was John’s phone. Idiot.
Sherlock hesitated but handed Maeve to the doctor.
“Hello,” he spoke, eyes flicking over everybody in the room whose attention was now on him.
Sherlock managed a nod. He stared at the blonde and realisation dawned on his face, he cursed himself inwardly and deduced. “You were bothered that I didn’t ask you to come with me, when we arrived.”
John nodded.
“Did you find anything in the journal?” John asked.
“A fool proof plan.” The younger Holmes grumbled and looked back down at the small baby asleep in his arms, she was snoring softly, her mouth slightly parted and eyelashes fluttering against her cheek.
“Can we get this over with?” Sherlock asked, not really looking for an answer, he was looking for a way out.
“It’s a sauna in there.”
John couldn’t hold back his laughter. Maeve looked horrified.
“Maeve’s…” He started.
“She’s not that bad is she?” He asked, worried, stepping into the kitchen.
“I don’t have time for this right now.” Sherlock rubbed his forehead.
Sherlock smiled up at him and nodded in greeting. “Victor.”
“Of course you did” John smiled, “I guess I’ll leave you two to it.”
“Sometimes you need to be told what to do and listen.”
Mycroft nodded. “When does he call?”
John frowned in disbelief.
“Yes, we met in a bar and fucked in an alleyway.”
“We’re going to go sightseeing.” John announced in a soft tone.
“Good.” Mycroft concluded and threw the memory stick at his younger brother. Sherlock reached out without looking and caught it, hand tightening around it for a millisecond before slipping it into the inside pocket of his jacket.
“I informed you-” Mycroft began.
He changed her and re-dressed her before pulling her back against his chest. The crying faded out and her lip quivered against the skin of his neck, tears wetting her cheeks. “A beautiful girl like you shouldn’t cry.” He told her. “Because I will always be here, Daddy will always be here. I’m here.” He jiggled and didn’t stop until she’d settled down. Feeding time.
“Small mercies.” John smiled at that.
Sherlock nodded.
“We also went on a date.”
“As did I.”
Sherlock handed him the bottle and John took it as he passed, and sat himself down in his chair. He shuffled Maeve so that she was resting in one arm and offered her the bottle. She hesitated but accepted it and started drinking. “So, where have you been?”
Silvia looked both happy and shocked. “The tower of London?”
John glanced over his shoulder at the consulting detective. “Just fine?
A soft whine stopped him. Sherlock furrowed his brows, reopening the partially shut door to look back outside. Another soft whine caught his attention, the consulting detective looked down at the source.
Sherlock was plucking his violin strings as they talked.
Maeve was babbling in content against her father’s chest. Her hands were gripped in his coat and her eyes were fixed ahead of her at his clothed chest, occasionally flicking up to his face as though to check he was still there. It was obvious that she was scared of him disappearing, somehow slipping through his grip. Sherlock could read this in her body language, of course, John knew, watching him from the other side of the room. The consulting detective’s hand was resting on the back of her head, occasionally stroking with his forefinger over the soft but thickening strands of dark hair. He displayed the care one would expect from any father while simultaneously demonstrating the behaviour of a professional. His eyes flicked in a precise and practised manner, drinking in all the information he could from every item.
“Haven’t produced anything yet but we’re running a wider search now, hoping to turn something out.”
“It was cold.” John defended. “And wet.”
The door closed again.
“And she won’t sleep because there’s so much new stuff for her to explore.” John told him. “She loves you and you love her, you’re not failing at this.”
Sherlock scooped her up, holding her against his chest. Her tears dampening his neck and the collar of his shirt. “Daddy’s here, shhh” he hushed, jiggling up and down. “Everything’s going to be fine, I’m here.”
“Well, it’ll certainly be an adjustment.”
“I’m fine” Sherlock quickly dismissed.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. His baby was currently sucking on his brother’s neck, small hands grasping the front of his suit. “She is a baby.” He said simply.
Violet looked appalled, “All the more reason to have her christened, this isn’t about you or your views, it’s about hers, to give her a sense of belonging and faith.”
“Yes, it is.” John looked up at the sky.
“The man responsible for this, the man holding your son,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “he would have been watching your son, that means you may have seen him at some point, I’d like you to think back and inform one of the PC’s of anyone that strikes you, anything will help, and if we can get an accurate description then we may be able to ID him.”
Mycroft watched his parents and quickly deduced. “You accused him of relapsing.” Violet managed a solemn nod and Mycroft inhaled sharply.
“How did your boyfriend swing this?” She asked in a hushed tone.
Siger chuckled. “I know but dogs are more expensive and harder to train.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“It makes little difference to me,” Sherlock admitted. “But the charity event is dedicated to children in need, focusing on children that have been or would have been abandoned if not for the help of this charity.”
Sherlock pulled off his clothes and shoved them deep into one of his coat pockets. He glanced at Mycroft and cleared his throat, “you and Lestrade.”
“You don’t have to come.” John added.
“Dinner?” Greg asked raising an eyebrow.
John shrugged, “I had a few pints.”
“Clothes.” Sherlock muttered like he wasn’t aware that he was even speaking, still lost in his mind and not focusing at all on his surroundings.
“I can’t sleep.” He hissed.
“Am I?” John asked raising an eyebrow.
“Jim,” Sherlock frowned in confusion.
Sherlock attends a meeting with Social Services and Mycroft is there to lend a helping hand, and stop his brother from getting into unnecessary trouble. Later, he attends a crime scene and is gifted with Maeve's first laugh.
“And…” John looked up, confused.
“Who’s this young lady then?” Arabella asked craning her neck slightly as Violet retook her seat, continuing with her movements to sooth the infant.
“Banana, peach, strawberry. The banana and mango.”
“Yes, you’re tired I know, you can go to sleep in a minute.” He kissed the top of her head. He looked into the kitchen and called, “Sherlock, she’s tired.”
John rolled his eyes, “do you have to be so dramatic?”
“Cute?” Sherlock repeated with disdain.
“A bit, between bouts.”
“It may be too much,” Sherlock muttered.
After a few moments he nodded and backed away, the young officer peaked inside the car and took a step closer to the group of officers, informing them of the man and his enquiries. Said man, was completely unnoticed, as he moved to the opposite door with the charade of lighting a cigarette he opened the car door and reached inside. He came back with Maeve, who seemed to be in the cusps of sleep.
Maeve’s lip quivered for a moment and she began to cry.
“Boys.” Violet warned.
“Or, he’s…” the blonde considered it, and recalled what Sally Donovan told him at their first meeting. He frowned, “he gets off on it.”
“Watch.”
Maeve looked up at him.
Sherlock shot Mycroft a confused look. The auburn haired man merely raised an eyebrow while his younger brother continued his ministrations on his upset daughter. Then it clicked. Sherlock’s eyes widened. Mycroft was giving him a brief escape. “How rude of me.” He said unconvincingly.
Sherlock's parents finally find out that Sherlock has custody of Maeve, a visit may be in order.
“That’s for the best.” Siger nodded and watched as John took a seat on the small sofa opposite.
Sherlock nodded and kept his eyes on the screen, watching Maeve shift in sleep slightly but not enough to wake herself. When he was satisfied he looked up in no particular direction and sorted the memory of her laughing into his mind palace.
“Sherlock, calm down, she’s not in the car?” Greg asked, rushing towards the BMW.
Sherlock’s head snapped to her. “Deleted it.”
“Dull.” The dark haired man murmured and dropped his head to rest his lips on his daughter’s head.
Maeve gurgled in response as her eyes roamed over the ceiling.
“Good girl.” He kissed the top of her head.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” she ducked back into the kitchen.
It was clear that he was uncomfortable.
“Yes, she doesn’t have a dummy instead she chews on our fingers.”
“Prove it,” Sherlock said with all the petulance of a child.
Anthea opened the door from the inside for her boss, eyes glued to her blackberry. Mycroft paused. “And Sherlock, Gregory and I will take Maeve off of your hands Saturday.”
Sherlock nodded.
The dark blonde craned his neck slightly to get a better view at the infant and smiled at the sight of her sleeping; mouth open and a line of dribble running down her chin but somehow managing to miss her father’s dark blue suit. “She’s the image of you.”
His office wasn’t designed with a child in mind. It was small in size and dark with stone walls and a large portrait behind the desk, it was bare and modern, unlike his various other offices which were warm and usually full of wood. Maeve remained asleep in her car seat, placed on the chair across from him. He flicked through the papers that Anthea had finished touching upon his detour. Everything was in order for the meeting.
“We are less likely to disturb her if she’s in there,” Sherlock informed him, speaking softly and refraining using his ‘don’t be an idiot’ look.
“Yes, when I have set up her Moses basket in my bedroom along with anything else that she may need. I have acquired a few different chairs for her but they also need to be set up.”
“Yes?” Greg repeated.
“Get dressed,” Sherlock said in his ‘don’t be an idiot’ tone.
Robert nodded and croaked, “h-he had a knife.”
When they parted John smiled dopily and asked, “What was that for?”
“Anthea?” Mycroft pressed the phone to his ear. The lack of an immediate response caught his attention and he looked up, pressing the phone closer to his ear. “What’s wrong?”
She sighed in response which he took for an affirmative.
“I’m sure there’s nothing to worry about then.” John decided with a nod of his head.
“You are not working now.” The elder reminded him.
Sherlock and John get some alone time and they go about the day solving the case.
John closed his eyes, put down his pint and told them simply, “shut up.”
Greg watched fondly from the doorway as the consulting detective attempted to wake his daughter, standing in the middle of the living room and bouncing her slightly in a comforting motion.
“She’s looking for a quick payday. Get your father to lend you his security team and the next time she steps foot on your property, have her arrested for trespassing, if the police need more evidence, send them in my direction. She’s done with you now, she knows how access the art work you’re currently curating and will attempt to take something and sell it further down the line. For now, she’s being watched and the moment she tries anything, the police will be informed. I’ve sent word to a contact at Scotland Yard and he’s making the appropriate people aware, they’ll want to see you tomorrow to get the full story, no doubt and charges will be brought. And, no need to worry about the show you’ve been working on, everything of value has been moved to an appropriate location until the threat has been resolved.”
“This is Detective Inspector Dimmock” the voice on the other end of the line introduced.
Sherlock smirked, "something like that."
“Reminding.” Sherlock corrected with a frown.
her straigh
Her face scrunched up but she didn’t wake. She was fighting it.
“Pepsi.” John answered.
Ten minutes later, John was sat on one of the chairs in the longue area of their room which was separated from the bedroom by only a rounded archway instead of a door. The ex-army doctor was reading the newspaper while the consulting detective was in the exact position he had been in ten minutes previously, his face angled towards Maeve but his eyes were closed. He was not sleeping, just resting and sorting through his schedule for the rest of the day, no doubt. It was a knock on the door that roused him from his thoughts, his eyes snapped open and darted to Maeve, who was, luckily, still sound asleep. He sighed and pressed a kiss to her hand as he sat up on the bed, watching as John walked around the chair towards the door which was out of sight. The door opened. It was his father.
“Yes, robbery murder, how interesting.” Sherlock feigned boredom.
Maeve whined in her sleep, stretching her legs and moving her arms closer to her body. Sherlock watched her intently for any signs of discomfort or waking, when there was none he relaxed slightly but kept his attention on her.
“She’s twelve weeks old.”
Sherlock was stood on the pavement. He had refused a shock blanket and to sit down, so he stood in the middle of the path with his hands rhythmically clenching and unclenching at his side. His mind was screaming; instinctively flicking from face to face, from floor to car, unable to focus on anything.
“Well, it was after I was discharged from the army…” John began.
“Hello,” Sherlock greeted.
“Fine,” John repeated, something between an angry and amused smile settling on his lips. “What are you twelve?”
“Disaster avoided” John said into the silent room. Sherlock chuckled.
Sherlock kissed the top of his daughter’s head and breathed in the reassuring scent that was her.
John looked at Sherlock for help but the consulting detective merely smirked and muttered, “They’re your parents, it was your responsibility to tell them, not mine.”
The problem was that Sherlock didn’t like people very much.
“For who?” Sigers brow furrowed as he picked up the car seat containing his granddaughter.
“God.” John winced sympathetically.
“She came in instead of calling, worried that she’d been poisoned. She was showing signs of a panic attack, almost fainted so we had her checked over by some paramedics but there were no signs of foul play. The paramedics said that she was exhausted, slightly dehydrated and her heart rate was elevated but all are normal in the case of a panic attack. We checked her house to reassure her but there was no sign of, well, anything, so we didn’t bother getting forensics in. We took her to a relative’s house. She called two days ago, still worried but there’s nothing we can do without cause. She’s been insistent.”
“As much as her mind can grasp.” Mycroft smiled, the fake kind.
“I suppose I have no right to be concerned, you are only my eldest son and first grandchild.”
“Right,” the shorter man said after a moment. He cleared his throat.
The only advantage of a pram was that most people, not all, would allow him to pass in usual circumstances. Now, with people in a Christmas frenzy, manners were lacking somewhat. It also allowed him to carry more shopping. He somehow passed through the crowd with ease and approached the shop he was looking for. It was a small but quaint shop tucked in between some buildings. A woman leaving the room opened the door for him and stood aside as he manoeuvred the pram into the room. It was an antique bookshop.
.” He was impressed.
“Do you want to get her or shall I?” the blonde asked.
“Hmmm” Sherlock hummed thoughtfully.
“And he customised it for you.”
Sherlock was unused to his father defending him.
Sherlock furrowed his brow. “Maeve is rather fussy today, she woke at five and has only just got back to sleep. Though Mrs Hudson is competent there is no need to put that on her, she is being extremely difficult today and needs to be around somebody that she recognises.”
The door swung open to reveal his mother dressed in a black and orange ensemble that practically streamed Halloween. In her hand was a plastic pumpkin with small toys inside.
“I brought extra memory cards.”
“He has a room here?” John seemed confused. “He never told me that.”
“This one?” Anthea smirked, glancing at her boss.
“Can I?” He gestured.
“There’s some take out in the fridge.”
“I’ve made dinner.” John changed the subject.
Violet continued, “- is stopping by the church before joining then.”
“Ready?” The blonde asked with a small smile.
“They are more concerned with your capability to care for Maeve.”
“Yes, hello,” he said. She rubbed against him. “Are you lonely?”
“France, I believe.” There was a flash of emotion across his face, anger and hurt. Molly was not used to seeing it. “She is no longer involved, never was really, it’s just me and Maeve now.”
“Respect?” Sherlock repeated with distaste, question lingering in the air.
John moved backward but Sherlock followed eagerly and kissed him again, chastely. His lips lingering for a moment, he placed a kiss on the corner of John's mouth and revelled in the pleased sigh that escaped the blonde, he drew back and stood tall, satisfied.
“He has no supplies,” Mycroft summarised.
Sherlock didn’t answer. Instead he picked up a small romper with grey hearts on and handed it to his mother. Violet didn’t bother suppressing her smirk. Sherlock rolled his eyes and told her, “Shut up.”
“I saved the best till last,” John said from behind the consulting detective.
Though Sherlock hated it admit it, Mycroft was right, he was involved and Maeve needed protecting, even from him but he would never give her up without fight. The fat git was just interfering again.
“Who’s Moran?” Greg asked.
“We’re doing dinner on Sunday right?” Greg asked.
Sherlock picked up a soft toy from the floor and threw it at him, the blonde dodged it with a grin, he sighed dramatically “I knew giving you that book would be a mistake.”
“Right.” Greg handed Sally Maeve, she took her without question.
“Yes but that’s not the bloody point.” John offered the bottle back to Maeve, she eagerly accepted. “You can’t just go off on your own, what if something had happened? You have her” he nodded to the infant “to think of now.”
“It’s…beautiful.” He managed a few seconds later.
“No.”
Sherlock was corresponding with the Parisian police, well, he was corresponding with them in the hopes of working the case though he doubted they’d take it seriously until he appeared in person.
They watched Silvia and Harold walk into the train station.
“Is there a reason you’re here?”
“How is her ladyship?” The blonde’s voice was rough with sleep.
“Fine,” Sherlock answered, undoing his button jacket.
“There’s a bottle on the side, it needs to be warmed.”
John winced. “And the other?”
“You like alcohol.”
“And she for me.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. He had expected more of a protest from his brother.
“Oh” Cecily fawned. “She’s happy to see you.”
“Yeah he does that, he’s rude.” John nodded.
“Yes.”
Sherlock sighed, “I guess congratulations are in order.”
“You didn’t tell them.”
The consulting detective picked up the two bags he had prepared as he exited the room, the purple ‘baby bag’ and a larger black leather bag. He closed the door behind him and walked down the hallway, pausing at the table to place the bags upon it before moving into the living room. He dedicated his free arm to holding Maeve also, using one arm to support her bottom so that she was sitting on his forearm and his other hand across her small back. Maeve’s chin was resting on his shoulder and she was looking behind him, growling loudly so that her body vibrated against his.
“This is far too sentimental.” He hissed.
“Sir.” Anthea called softly from the end of the hallway.
“Always,” Sherlock responded, elongating the vowel sound and hissing the s.
,” he said simply.
Sherlock stood up as he mother approached and handed Maeve to her. He managed a small comforting smile and announced, “I need to feed her soon, and she’s getting tired.”
“Do you think Uncle Greg will let us work the case?” Sherlock asked Maeve, tone instantly softening.
Mycroft nodded and absentmindedly handed his niece another carrot. “Do not tell anybody that I said that.”
Sherlock shifted Maeve slightly so that she was resting comfortably against him, head tucked into his collarbone as she started to drift back into sleep. He held the phone with his free hand. “Unavoidable?”
“Yes,” Sherlock gave a curt answer.
“Some of us do have work to do.” Mycroft commented as he strode over to his mother, Siger followed.
“Like that’s ever stopped you before,” Sherlock answered.
John opened the front door and took them upstairs. He paused at the top at the sight of Sherlock stood at the window, back to them, no longer wearing his dressing gown. And Greg, sat on the sofa, hands clasped together on his knees, he looked up at them and managed a small smile.
Sherlock looked mysterious and elegant, like usual. It was strange; to see a tall, dark and mysterious man in his billowing dark coat pushing a pram like there was nothing he’d rather be doing. “We’re going to be early.” He said for the fifth time today.
“Am not.” Sherlock insisted refusing to move his lips, instead he focused completely on Maeve; awake and content in his arms. He was sat on his armchair, one leg crossed over the other with Maeve resting in his arms while John was faffing around, getting everything ready for their Sunday visit to his parents while he offered no help.
“Did you contact the police?”
“Ok.” He took pity on her and lent forward. She immediately flashed a gummy grin and grabbed fistfuls of his unruly curls the moment he was close enough, directing his face to hers. She placed a long sloppy kiss on his nose. He closed his eyes and sighed in displeasure.
“Who is with her now?”
“I never thought you one for cats.”
“I’m doing the washing.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ignoring his own menu in favour of focusing on his daughter as she woke up prematurely with a groan of discomfort. He cradled the baby in the sling. “John.”
Sherlock opened it with delicate hands. She watched him and eventually, pulled the paper.
Sherlock snorted and handed over Maeve to the older man, he took her and positioned her to sit in his arms with her back pressed against his chest, gazing out at the world with wide eyes. He placed the bag and carseat on the floor beside Greg and lent down, placing a kiss on Maeve’s head before turning and heading towards the scene. Sally led him in and John followed them both dutifully.
“See, easy enough.” Sherlock looked up from the page he was on and smiled.
“Banana.” Sherlock enunciated, eyeing the blonde dubiously.
“Very funny.” Sherlock countered.
“She’s ok.” He declared. He ran a hand over her head and craned his neck to press his nose to her hair, he inhaled her scent and kept his face pressed against the top of her head. He took a step back, putting some space between him and consulting criminal.
“I need your help.” Sherlock said quickly.
Sherlock glared at his daughter. “I hate you.”
Sherlock continued to stare at him, not wanting to be the first one to back down. His resolve broke, “Fine.”
“I’m here by association.”
“We all love you. You’ve got your daddy and papa, uncle Mycroft and Greg. Me and granny,” he paused and added as an afterthought. “Please don’t tell her I called her that.”
“Yes,” Sherlock corrected.
“We have a new highchair, and now she can support her own head we can actually use it.” John seemed excited by the prospected then sighed, “God. That’s what life is now, getting excited about baby chairs.”
“All work, no play,” John said with a smirk.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but shrugged. He sprung to his feet in a moment and held out the necklace. Maeve eyed him suspiciously. Sherlock gave her a stern ‘do as you’re told’ look and fastened the necklace around her neck. It was tight, not tight enough that she would choke herself with it, but tight enough that she wouldn’t catch it on anything, hanging about an inch or so under her chin. She tried and failed to look at the necklace. Sherlock took pity on her and showed her the bracelet. Her eyes widened curiously and she reached out for the bracelet, small fingers catching the small beads. She looked up at Sherlock, as though for permission, he smiled and she continued to finger the bracelet, eyes flicking back to watch.
“Did you get any sleep?”
There was a small burst of laughter at that and amused glances. Mycroft seemed particularly amused by the story as he raised an eyebrow and took a sip of his champagne.
“No, I said that we’d go to them.”
“What do you want?” John asked, turning to look at the consulting detective.
“And Sherlock? How is he?”
Still on holiday. There are ups and downs.
Maeve squealed and kicked wildly in response, splashing the water around as her head dropped towards the water, watching it intently.
“She getting heavy?” John asked with a faint smile.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered truthfully.
“Drop the weapon” Lestrade told her.
“You’re going out” Sherlock observed. He was sat in his armchair with one leg crossed elegantly over the other and baby Maeve cradled in his arms drinking from her bottle eagerly. Sherlock looked up at John as he walked down the hallway and stopped into the kitchen doorway. The ex-army doctor was freshly washed and dressed in a white and red checked shirt, tucked neatly into his jeans with a brown belt and matching shoes. His coat was hooked over his arm.
“Sh-she’s been gone for three and a half hours.” The consulting detective told him.
John frowned, "it's normal to be proud of someone Sherlock, no matter if it's your child, sibling or partner."
“Yes, mother.” Sherlock said with all the petulance of a child.
“Mummy prefers I keep an eye on you.”
“Quite.”
“Don’t get moody with me because you’re hot.”
“You’re early.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and stepped into the house, Siger moved back and opened the door wider to allow him in. He walked in backwards, pulling the pram along with him with great care. Maeve was starting to wake beneath her blankets, face scrunching up in annoyance. “She looks just like you.” Siger told Sherlock.
“Come on, look at her, she’s so cute.” He continued.
John sighed and interjected, “nothing, he meant nothing.”
Molly looked up and Sherlock’s attention snapped from the microscope to the sleeping baby inside of the pram, she stirred and released a high pitched whine. He bit his lip hoping that she would just drift back into sleep. Maeve blinked herself awake, eyes watering and a single tear running down her cheek. He sighed, shooting a glare in the direction of the doctor that had just entered the room then back to his daughter.
and let you raise it alone?” He asked, offended.
The tea had gone cold. John fingered the edge of his saucer and remained quiet, too lost in his own thoughts to make polite conversation. Mycroft strode into the kitchen, there were wet patches on his shirt which was rolled to his sleeves and he had lost his suit jacket. Andrews looked up and busied himself with making tea.
“I heard that.”
“I’ll move back to London, at least for the pregnancy, then after I’ll move back to Sussex by the sea. I’ll work until the due date, of course, and it’s completely up to you how involved you are.”
Violet watched him for a moment. “And that’s it, you’re completely committed to be a father now.”
“I think they want to see if Sherlock’s the normal one.” He admitted with a smile.
“Mycroft.” He gave in explanation as though it was a full answer.
“The day she was admitted into hospital and gave birth.”
“Well, baby Holmes here is ok. She’s very responsive and her temperature is exactly where we’d expect it to be. She doesn’t seem hungry yet, but I’ll bring you the things you need to make her a bottle. And if it’s ok with you, we’ll give her a bath, clean her a little bit. So we won’t bother changing her.” She glanced over her shoulder at him smiled. She was young and obviously enjoyed her work. “I’ll just wrap her in the blanket and you can hold her again, if you like.”
Mrs Hudson quickly disappeared after setting down the tea tray on the desk, now fearing that the coffee table was too low and easily accessible by an increasingly ready to move Maeve. She muttered something about needing to do some shopping and wanting to let Sherlock get on with his work while Greg pulled out his notepad. No case file, Sherlock noted as he sipped his tea. It burnt his tongue in touch but he revelled in the feeling, he’d always enjoyed his tea and coffee hot, almost too hot.
Sherlock gave him his best ‘you are an idiot’ look. “You’re always there. Whenever I’ve run off into danger or just needed a pen. When I said that you didn’t count, I meant, I include you with myself and Maeve, as one entity.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and shifted Maeve to rest in his arm, cradled against his torso and offering her the milk. She accepted it, small rosy lips parting sleepily around the teat. He went back to focusing on the board, stopping occasionally to watch his daughter or dab at her lips with muslin. Greg and Sally watched in silence, in awe of Sherlock’s natural ability to nurture his child. The consulting detective remained quiet while going about the task, not speaking again till he had the newborn settled with her chin on his shoulder, protected by a muslin and rubbed her back encouragingly.
Sherlock glared at him.
“Yes, well actually he’s my flatmate, Sherlock…we’re together now and well, and we’re parents.”
“Sherlock.” He prompted, keeping his tone level.
“I’ll return her-” Mycroft started.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, I give them money or whatever they need. There are a couple that accept clothes and food as payment. Others accept food or veterinary care for their dogs.”
“And he’s like Sherlock but smarter.” John smiled.
“You’re home” John stated the moment he stepped into the bedroom wearing nothing but a towel secured around his waist.
“She won’t answer you Lestrade.” A deep voice told him.
Catastrophe.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and asked, “Is it?”
Sherlock shook his head, embarrassed and look at the ground. "I thought that I loved someone before but now I know that that wasn't love."
“No.” His youngest son answered.
“She wasn’t sick on you,” The taller man pointed out.
“No international crisis?”
“Lunch break,” Greg answered.
“I don’t think so,” He admitted, stopping on the spot and bouncing instead, rubbing his hand across her back in circles.
“Summers mostly,” he answered.
“No, instead he turned our living room into a giant nest of information about babies.” John sighed. It was endearing really, cute even, Sherlock just wanted to make sure he was covering all the bases and had all available data.
“Done, you can take the plates.” Sherlock instructed. He pushed the two plates towards his partner and lifted Maeve and the bouncy chair off of the counter. She looked around in confusion and Sherlock made a big ‘o’ shape with his mouth to grab her attention.
“She can’t talk John and I’m not a mind reader” Sherlock snapped. “She was abandoned, obviously and there’s a note but I can’t open it with just one hand.”
“So you’ve decided to co parent his child.”
The angle was wrong. He couldn’t see her properly.
They were all sat in the drawing room at the front of the house, spread across the sofas and chairs with tea on the table. Sherlock was sat alone in a chair with Maeve rested against his chest, head turned outwards towards the others while she chewed on her own fist.
“Good shopping trip?” John asked her.
