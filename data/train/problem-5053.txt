They reach a door and that’s where they find the beta from before, only this time he smells different than when Steve first scented him in the base. He smells of cherries and lilac.
Tony can’t help but smile as Peter tells him everything about his childhood. Peter’s face would light up and the smile he wore was infectious. Tony noticed from day one that he had Steve’s smile. It was bright and lit up a room. It was the kind of smile that made you want to do the same.
He places a hand over his stomach, feeling another wave of nausea overcome him. It’s too soon to tell, but God does he wish he could find out now. It would put his worried mind to rest.
Steve is admitted and the doctor orders an ultrasound. Tony’s leg shakes nervously as he awaits the news. His anxiety appears normal to everyone around him. He resembles that of a stressed and worried father. But the truth was he couldn’t care less about the child in Steve’s womb. He wasn’t hoping that the baby was alive and healthy. He was hoping for the opposite.
Tony sighs. “If I can feed her then you can get some sleep. That’s all I was trying to gain from this. I want to help.”
“I can’t wait to meet him.” Natasha smiles as she rubs her hand over the spot where her nephew was kicking.
Steve quickly shuts off the water and steps out of the shower, drying himself and wrapping a towel around his waist. He waits for another cramp to come, but when it doesn’t, he wonders if it’s run its course.
Tony rolls over until he’s hovering over Steve and ducks down to connect their lips. The kiss starts off slow and sensual, but that pace isn’t kept for long, and soon their kisses are heated and passionate. Steve moans softly and wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him closer.
Peter jumps up and down excitedly, and Dodger joins in by barking and chasing the little boy around playfully.
“I don’t know. All I know is he’s getting too close and I can’t risk him finding you. California is our best option right now. He won’t look there.”
It feels like forever since I've been on here and writing. Life gets busy I guess. I'm sorry it's taken me this long. I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
He should have called Steve and told him that he was going to take care of the base. Steve probably would have stayed home with Peter and avoided the mess Tony created. Or maybe they would have teamed up like in the golden days. And if Steve did end up getting hurt, Tony would have been there to carry him out of the base and to safety.
It’s been years since he escaped Hydra with his life and rid himself of the alpha that abused him. The nightmares weren’t as frequent as they used to be, but occasionally sleep was interrupted by one. Steve thought after two years he’d be able to go a full night without the nightmares.
Steve knows what he’s waiting for and with a shake of his head, Steve gives him his answer. “He’s not coming.”
“Don’t!” This time Bucky rises to his feet and takes a few steps away from the sofas. “Don’t try and make it better because you can’t. He’s gone. He might be your leader but he was my best friend, and I was ready to follow him before any of you.”
Not much is said about Tony after that. The comfortable silence that falls between them doesn’t last long, and soon Peter’s cries of distress fill the once quiet space. Steve is quick to try and calm his son down, only for his attempts to fail.
“With us,” Steve corrects and lays his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I know you’ll be an amazing father.”
Steve rolls his eyes playfully and leans down to peck Tony on the lips. Tony is quick to pull Steve back in for another kiss. Their moment is interrupted again, but this time Tony can’t find it in himself to be upset and he laughs.
James rushes back to the bed and crawls toward the wall, bringing his knees up to his chest and hugging them tightly. Steve approaches the scared little alpha and sits down on the edge of the bed.
Peter ignores the gentle bantering and turns toward the parked car, watching as his Uncle Bruce steps out and begins making his way over. Another car pulls up, and his Uncle Clint, Aunt Laura and his three cousins all get out, walking with Bruce.
“I don’t know if you know this but babies have their own schedule. If this kid wants out now then he’s coming.”
So I had mentioned smut before so maybe some more stony smut in the next chapter? Does that sound good? 😉
“You’ll be fine. You can run this operation a hell of a lot better than I can. It’s who you are, Rogers.”
He decides on leaving Tony alone. He doesn’t want to make him uncomfortable in any way. They could always talk more later. It was what Tony suggested in the first place.
“And your father?” Steve asks. He immediately senses the hesitation from Tony the moment he asks the question. He’s ready to backtrack and change the subject, but then Tony answers.
Steve releases her instantly. “Where the hell have you been? I’ve called you, your dad’s called you. Peter went looking for you-”
Tony is lounging on the sofa, skimming through the designs he had for their son’s room. He had shown Steve a few of his ideas but they had yet to meet in the middle.
“Pete’s fine and Sarah was good up until Harley thought it would be funny to wake everyone from their nap.”
They don’t separate after that. Steve doesn’t let her go, not even after the party has ended and they say goodbye to their friends. Tony wishes the party would have lasted a little longer, but they had the following day to start fresh with their friends by their side.
“I know it’s a lot,” Tony starts when he catches Steve’s wandering eyes. “But it’s better than the streets right? Or the place you came from.”
Tony finds the strength to lift his head and connect them with the blue ones on the screen. He straightens up and is ready to turn the screen off, but a presence in the room stops him and he turns, expecting to find Pepper in the entrance, but to his surprise he’s met with his best friend.
“I’m sorry. I was blind. I should’ve been more considerate of your feelings. I guess I was so caught up in finally having a baby that I didn’t pay attention to how it was affecting you.”
“Just one. It was a few weeks ago.” Steve can’t help but shift uncomfortably from the alpha’s gaze. Tony eventually looks away when Bruce moves across the room to grab a pair of nitrile gloves. Steve half expects Tony to be by his side when the exam starts, but to his disappointment Tony lingers near the door.
The alpha keeps his hand on Steve’s head, ready to bash it against the wall again if he needed to. His other hand trails between where they’re pressed together, and Steve’s breath hitches when he realizes what the alpha is doing. He struggles again.
The walls continue to crack and cave in, pieces of concrete falling around him. It’s the heavy smoke in the air that makes getting out difficult. Peter coughs when the smoke rushes into his lungs. He hacks and sputters, doubling over to catch his breath. The smoke is suffocating.
It comes back, stronger than ever when Steve’s belly swells with the new life. The bump is small and is kept hidden under Steve’s clothes, but Tony knows it’s there. He hates it.
“Is this…” Peter trails off, eyes going wide when he pulls out his suit. He smiles wildly and runs a hand over the red and blue fabric. “Wow this is…”
“I have an idea,” Clint smirks and Tony’s eyes travel in his direction. “Don’t worry you’ll figure it out in nine months.”
Captain America was a legend; a hero. He was a symbol. He stood up against the bullies. He fought hard for his country and the people that needed someone to look up to. He was a soldier, an Avenger. But to others he was more than that.
The atmosphere in the space has changed. Everyone else is still going about their morning and continuing their conversations, but Tony notices the way they send worried glances Steve’s way. Steve doesn’t notice, or if he does, he ignores them and goes back to picking at the muffin.
“It’s not this place,” Steve finally says. The tears continue to fall from his eyes and he frees one arm from around Morgan to reach up and wipe them away. “It’s fine. It’s just...I can’t be here. I can’t.”
“Don’t make me go. Please, Tony, don’t make me go.” Steve is in hysterics; tears are running down his face and he releases small sobs and whimpers.
“Don’t rush it. I’m going to get you some help okay? Maybe a few therapy sessions will be good for you. I know they helped me when I needed to talk.”
Steve Rogers was a friend, a brother, and more importantly, a father. Steve was selfless, ready to risk everything for his friends and family. And just like his alter ego, he was brave and ready to stand up for what he believed in.
His smile quickly falters when his belly tightens again. He places one gloved hand over the area, eyes squeezing shut in discomfort. He breathes steadily through it until it’s tapering off.
“Alright. Let’s talk business.” Tony scoots forward in his seat, only to slump back when his head throbs and his vision blurs.
He’s torn between looking for his father and getting back to the jet. He decides on the first option and continues moving, until another explosion erupts somewhere in the building. His papa probably already got the team out and they were making their way back to the jet. Captain America never risked the lives of his team.
Peter eyes the hand offered to him. “This isn’t a business deal. It’s a promise. Family promises to be there for each other. I guess I don’t expect you to understand that.”
And this time Steve believes him. He could do this. He wasn’t going to hide away from the rest of the world anymore. His freedom was returned to him and he was ready to take that large step. The world was in his hand now.
Natasha chuckles and offers him a hand. Peter eyes it, not fully trusting her to pull him up. She’d probably just flip him over again.
Steve thrusts slowly, relishing the feeling of having Tony enveloped around him. He increases the movement of his hips until he’s fucking Tony hard. Tony cries out, his arms shaking, struggling to keep him upright.
But Peter doesn’t want to hold on for so long. His papa had done that and it probably only caused him pain and misery. Peter wishes he could talk to his papa about that period in his life. There were still questions he didn’t have the answers to. He probably never would get them.
Steve’s death was still fresh. Sam needed more time to fully process the loss and figure out how to take care of the people Steve left behind. He was doing his best to keep Bucky from losing control and Peter from crumbling. It was a difficult task. More difficult than anything he’s ever had to do before.
He doesn’t fight back, knowing the consequences if he were to even try. He might be stronger than them both put together, but over the years he’s learned to submit and follow orders.
Tony knows what he’s referring to. The baby weight had yet to be shed completely. It was barely noticeable, but Steve noticed and obviously hated the leftover weight in his middle.
Tony watches the last conversation Peter and Steve shared. It’s nothing at all like the one he had with his parents. At least Peter got to say goodbye, and that he loved Steve. Tony regretted not being compassionate enough with his parents.
“Hey,” Tony quickly interrupts. “I don’t care that we’re not together anymore. I’m still going to help you with Pete. I’m not going to flake out on you.”
Tony had been ready to stop ignoring the calls and letters and go back to Steve, to tell him how he really felt and see if there was a chance of them starting over. But that had all come crashing down when he discovered Steve had chosen Barnes.
Sam wasn’t here now to brag, unfortunately; he was with Steve and Natasha on their newest mission doing God knows what in God knows where. Maybe he should have paid more attention than coloring.
Steve huffs and brings himself to a stop. Sam and Bucky do the same and they regroup, all panting from the workout.
“You’ll come home soon,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. He doesn’t miss the way his eyes fill with fresh tears. “I promise.”
A part of him wishes he could go back and fix the way they left things. He wonders if his papa had felt the exact same way. He must have. Why else would he have written so many letters?
Steve is awake and he glances up, sending Tony a tired smile. “Hey,” he greets, his voice thick with sleep.
“Hey, sleepyhead.” She smiles down at him. Peter yawns and sits up to stretch, his hair is even messier than before.
Alpha’s lips are on his again. Steve gives in and lets it happen, fighting the urge to vomit when the alpha’s tongue slips past his lips and into his mouth.
“My body’s fine,” is all Steve says before storming out of the apartment. The front door slams hard behind him.
He blames his hormones for the shift in his attitude but deep down he knows his past issues are coming back to haunt him. He wishes he could let go and not allow them to plague him, but he wasn’t that strong. Maybe he used to be but after Hydra and Alpha, the old Steve Rogers was gone and there was no telling when he’d emerge.
“Look!” The little boy points straight ahead, blue eyes full of excitement. He slips free from Peter’s grasp and takes off running toward the monument Peter knows is just a few feet away.
Steve barely touches the food given to him. Tony tries to offer him something else, only for the omega to shut down and refuse. Tony sighs and steps away to give him space.
The two guards step forward to remind the omega of his place, but their leader holds up a hand to stop them. He orders them from the room and the lock clicks in place.
Steve wants to go home. He wants to be with his son and curl up with him on the sofa to watch the movie they never got to finish. But the bleeding and intense cramping was alarming and couldn’t be ignored. It was Tony who dragged him to the emergency room. Steve didn’t blame him for caring so much.
The soft snoring Alpha makes is the only sound in the room. Steve lies awake, tangled in the alpha’s arms. He listens closely to the breathing in his ear, his body shivers from the heated air against his skin. He waits to make sure Alpha is in a deep sleep.
Sleep eventually does wash over him and Steve’s eyes fall shut. It’s not a peaceful sleep. He’s tormented by horrible nightmares. It starts the same way they always do, and no matter how hard Steve struggles to escape, the alpha pins him down and takes what is his.
By the time Tony gets downstairs, he’s not surprised to find Alexander Pierce waiting for him in the lobby. For once he’s not surrounded by his two big goons. The smile Alexander greets him with is still uncomfortable, but Tony pushes that aside.
Sam whips around to face Clint. “You know what, you’re the one who started it. Everything had been going smoothly until you ran your mouth.”
Those plans were broken now due to the horrible timing of his rut. He had wanted to be in the right state of mind before he took that big step with Steve. Right now he still had some time before the rut fully took over. But it would get worse throughout the next few hours. He just hoped he could keep his promise and not hurt Steve.
Peter frowns at the defensive tone his dad suddenly has. He didn’t understand how they went from laughing and talking about movies to this. He didn’t know much about his dad, but he did know one thing. Tony hated being uncomfortable. Only this time he wasn’t making awkward jokes to hide it. He was getting upset.
Steve frowns as he thinks it over. He hadn’t had a chance to look for one yet. Tony had returned back into his life and turned it upside down for the second time, all in the span of five minutes.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Bucky snarls. The blue in his eyes are almost black now, dark with rage. A rage meant for Tony.
Tony’s eyes open and the smile falters, immediately replaced with a frown. “You’re killing me, sweetheart.”
“You look like your dad.” Steve sighs sadly. He reaches out to gently stroke Peter’s cheek with his thumb. Peter doesn’t even flinch from the touch. “You’re so beautiful.”
Tony curses to himself when Steve refuses to pick up the phone. He’s ready to dial the number again, only to stop when Morgan needs him. He uses her as a distraction, and soon he has her fed and calm in his arms.
The growl Steve emits in response quickly becomes something he regrets. The baton digs deeper into his lower back.
Tony is ready to protest, but then he allows Steve to pass the tiny infant to him. The moment his son is in his arms, tears threaten to fall. Tony fights them back.
Tony heaves out a sigh and leans back into the leather seat. “I’m just trying to distract myself-wait, why am I even explaining any of this to you?”
Steve doesn’t announce his pregnancy right away. His plan...okay, maybe he doesn’t have a plan, but if he did, it would be to wait to say anything. He has no clue how he’s supposed to break the news to his teammates. Getting the words out to Tony had already been a bust.
Flash was clearly suffering, maybe more so than Peter and the chicken. He keeps his gaze down, as if he only had eyes for the food and nothing else. His plate has barely been touched. The mashed potatoes have been pushed to the opposite side, but otherwise his dinner remains intact.
Tony must pick up on his hesitation because he carefully passes Peter to Natasha. Her face lights up the moment he’s in her arms and his eyes flutter open to meet hers.
“Of course,” Tony says and steps further into the room, taking small, cautious steps toward his husband. “Steve, what did you do?”
Peter sighs sadly. “I think he would’ve been excited about a baby. He never mentioned having another one.”
Steve shuts his eyes when his cheek is softly caressed. Alpha leans in closer now, the smell of the alcohol on his breath makes Steve’s stomach churn. Every fiber of his being is screaming at him to pull away, but he knows if he were to act on that urge, that he would be punished.
He considered them friends. When Steve wasn’t around to keep him company, Dodger was there to listen. Tony trusted his new friend down in his lab, and more often than not, Steve would find both of them down there.
Bruce comes in a few times over the next few hours to check on his patient. Steve’s laboring is progressing fairly quickly, which doesn’t surprise the doctor. Tony, on the other hand, is terrified. His son would be born soon. And he wasn’t ready.
“Yeah.” Steve breaks their contact first and begins reading through the instructions, his brows furrowing slightly when he rereads the steps. “It wasn’t like this during my time.”
Harley decides he’s done napping and he stirs, small whimpers leaving his pouty lips. Steve jumps up to his feet to get to him, but Natasha is sending him a reassuring smile and calming down the newborn.
Steve has to bite back the snarky remark that forms on his tongue. He goes through the book, reading out the names as he goes; Tony hates all of them.
“Nat, please?” Steve begs. He wants to be done with this conversation. Talking about Tony was too painful.
“Try again. Since when are you giving up? I know you guys ended things but maybe one more shot wouldn’t hurt. Especially now that you have this little guy.” Bucky reaches over to mimic Steve and strokes the side of Peter’s face.
His thoughts drift to Flash and how he was supposed to break the news to him. He’d have to somehow get him alone and beg him not to tell anyone. That part should be easy enough. Flash didn’t want people to know that they slept together anyway.
Bruce smiles, but it appears sad. “Yeah he had us, but we were just aunt and uncles to him. That’s not saying that we didn’t matter, but Steve was his whole world. Steve always knew how to comfort Peter when he was sick or scared. They played and laughed and probably watched thousands of movies together. They were close.”
Natasha glances down at her lap, noticing that the fingers she had in the messy brown hair had ceased their movements. Peter doesn’t mind; he’s already asleep. The day had been the hardest for their youngest member. They had to bury a friend, but he had to bury a father.
“I knew I’d find you here. Enjoying yourself?” Pepper asks, almost as if she could read his mind. She was good at that.
“I’m fine.” Steve’s answer isn’t reassuring. His tone is still bitter and tight. “All I wanted to do was sleep and I can’t even do that.”
“You want me to fuck you?” Tony asks, his fingers still deep inside Steve’s ass and thrusting, hitting his prostate with each thrust. Steve cries out and clenches down around Tony’s fingers. It wasn’t enough. He needed more. “You do, huh? Look how needy you are. You want my cock that bad?”
“I’m sure you can, buddy. But don’t hurt him okay? He’s a little delicate,” Tony explains, patting his belly to emphasize his point.
“Then why does it always seem like you’re too busy with Peter and Harley and being Avengers? You don’t ask how my day was or if I’d like to go on runs. You can’t even help me with a stupid project.”
Peter is lying in the incubator, wires and plugs attached to him and the various machines around him. His little chest rises and falls steadily; the readings on the monitor look good.
Ned’s talking about...something. Peter’s tuned him out. He can’t decide if he should bother another attempt at SI or visit his papa instead. He’s leaning more toward the latter. He needs to vent to someone. And that someone had always been his papa.
But even with a new baby and her parents' insane jobs, life wasn’t too bad. It wasn’t until Peter turned 15 and his powers needed to be monitored closely did things start to change.
“Wait, there’s no proof…” Tony doesn’t finish that thought. He remembers the conversation he had with Pepper and the story of him chasing some random omega at the event Alexander Pierce held. Steve couldn’t be that omega...right? Steve had claimed he didn’t recognize Pierce. None of this made any sense.
The past is in the past. There was no point worrying about the what if’s and regretting past decisions. All they could do was move forward and lean on each other.
He’s greeted with red. Blood is all over the floor; the crimson stains the once white tiles. There’s smears of it on the seat of the toilet. Tony eyes shift from the terrifying scene to the trembling figure sitting against the wall. Steve peers up at him, his once sparkling blue eyes full of sadness; full of pain.
The one he’s chosen was one he’s seen countless times before, but yet this time the film was affecting him differently. What was supposed to be a harmless cartoon has turned him into a blubbering mess.
They make their way outside and into the parking lot where Steve’s black Audi is parked. He’s still not used to getting around in something so flashy. Back in his day he relied on his motorcycle, and that had been enough for him. But Tony had insisted Steve have something new and modern.
Sam smiles and nods. “Okay. What do you like drawing? Don’t ask me because I can’t even draw a stick figure. Don’t judge me.”
“I wasn’t expecting to see you here,” Natasha says, coming over to greet both Tony and Bruce. Her eyes narrow and Tony can only pray she doesn’t punch him.
Steve quietly steps into the room, not wanting to wake him. He kneels down in front of Tony until he’s eye level with his belly. Tony stirs slightly when Steve reaches out to place both hands over the bump, then he’s relaxing again and snoring.
His son is wrapped in a blanket and placed in his arms and Tony thanks her again. Tony makes sure Peter is secure in his arms, then he takes the gun and rushes out of the room.
One baby down, one more to go! Peter is on his way. His brother had to come first. I'll try and get the next chapter up by tomorrow!
“Nope. It’s fine. I love the kids and they’ll be excited. Sarah would love a sister. Lord knows the house is full of enough boys.”
Steve backs away from, his attention falling on his son when he whimpers. “Shh,” he soothes and cradles his son close. “I’m here. You’re safe now.”
Tony smiles at the scene and makes himself comfortable in one of the empty arm chairs. Steve continues to speak to their daughter, telling her all about his day and the Blue bird he saw during breakfast and the sketch he did of it later. Morgan smiles a toothless grin. It makes Steve laugh.
Those same words have been said before, and again before every single one of Steve’s missions. It was how they said goodbye.
The restraints around his wrists are removed and he is pushed back onto the exam table. He doesn’t struggle when the two alpha’s stand on each side of him and strap him down. He’s been through this before.
“Ah!” Tony holds up a finger to silence her. “I’m gonna stop you right there. We’re not in love. Maybe we were once but...that was a long time ago. We’re just friends.”
“What? You’re telling me you’re not curious? I wasn’t even a part of the team and I still showed up.”
Maybe he just needed more time. Maybe he needed a confirmation. He needed proof that Steve was being honest.
“Right, of course. Thank you for your time, Mr. Stark. Maybe we can meet again for another contribution.”
Steve doesn’t even wait for the AI to give him information on how he can leave a message, and he ends the call. It’s right on time, too, because the nurse appears and he’s being led into the sterilized room.
A sharp cramp in his midsection has Steve stopping abruptly, one hand flying to the spot when his belly tightens uncomfortably. Sam is the first to notice, sending him a worried look.
“Damnit.” Tony curses to himself and leans back in his chair, scrubbing a hand over his face. His right leg is shaking, his whole body is buzzing. It didn’t help that he could still smell Steve on him. The omega’s scent was deliciously sweet. He wonders if it has anything to do with the pregnancy or if that was Steve’s natural scent. He tries to rid his mind of that thought when his cock stirs in interest.
“Four pups,” Steve says sheepishly. He looks around at the others, wondering if they have any of their own or if they have as many as he does. Maybe they do. And maybe...some of their pups were conceived the same way.
“But I feel like I do. I don’t know how to explain it but I feel connected to him somehow. Maybe I’m just crazy.”
“I don’t know how. Well...I had one idea. It’s crazy and I don’t even know if she’ll agree to it but...maybe Pepper-”
Tony smiles back and affectionately rubs his thumb along Steve’s knuckles. “I know. All I want is for you to be happy. You’re free now. Free to do whatever you want. If you want to draw then you can do it. If you want to find a job then you can. I’m just saying you have freedom now and I don’t want you to waste it.”
The team of security escort them inside the tower and toward the private elevators. James is the most curious about the new location, but also the most protective. He snarls and bares his tiny teeth to the guards whenever one of them gets too close to his siblings.
“They’ll be fine. Make sure no one comes into this room until I’m ready,” Pierce commands, then with a snap of his finger, the two alpha’s follow after their leader.
“He was pissed that I took it,” Bucky says with a small chuckle, then he continues going through the pages, coming across more birthdays, Christmas’s, and all the holidays in between.
No one speaks. If they have something they want to say, it gets lost and the silence wins out. What could they say? Steve was gone and he wasn’t coming back.
Thunder rolls in the distance, the clouds above him darkening. Peter doesn’t wait for long, not wanting to get caught in the storm. He doesn’t go home right away, unsure about facing his family. He doesn’t know how to tell them the truth.
Steve sighs again and reaches for the small wastebasket, his grip on it slipping and sending the soiled contents to the floor. Steve curses and begins gathering the trash.
Peter doesn’t want to leave, but he needs time to think. Perhaps he rushed things and didn’t get a chance to really decide what he wanted.
The pain is excruciating, possibly the worst he’s ever felt, but he keeps his discomfort to himself. Grinning and bearing through the pain was something he was used to.
“You’re a good person, Steve,” Tony says. “And an even better mother. They were wrong about you. You’re more than what they tried to make you to be.”
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head and reaches for his glass again, taking a bigger drink until his wine is almost gone. “I get where you’re coming from, but we have to work together on this. He needs us both.”
“They’re delayed but I explained to Steve that with the proper care and treatment that they’ll be fine. I suggest meeting with Dr. Helen Cho.”
Happy helps Steve into the front seat and throws the bag in the back, then he’s rushing to the driver’s side and climbing in. His head whips in Steve’s direction when Steve groans.
Steve thanks them again and the pair leaves. Another presence lingers and Steve lifts his head, finding the other agent still in the room.
He can’t tell them. They would be disappointed and upset and would probably never look at him the same way. He didn’t need them as much as Ned said he did. He could take care of this on his own.
Peter doesn’t mention the fact that his dad was already on Bucky’s bad side and should probably never show his face at the compound unless he wants it beaten to a pulp.
Steve nods but it’s obvious he’s still concerned. He takes another drink of his coffee then sets it down and steps closer to feel his son’s forehead.
“Honey, let me try,” Tony suggests and much to his surprise, Steve passes her to him. Usually, Steve argued, deciding that he could do it and eventually he would, but right now he didn’t even want to try. Tony brushes it off, shifting his focus to his crying daughter. “What’s with all the fuss, Little Miss?”
“It’s okay, kiddo,” Tony assures and Peter rushes to him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s body and holding him close. “This is my fault. I’m sorry for causing more pain. I never meant-”
Tony comes in after him, a heavy sigh leaving his lips. Some time has passed since he’s been in his Malibu home. If the circumstances were different, maybe he’d feel more excited to be back, to be on a break from New York and his hectic work schedule.
“Eh. I’m fucking exhausted. I’m used to avoiding sleep and even then I barely feel the effects, but this...I’m constantly tired.”
Steve nods. “I think so,” he says, then he glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. “Do you think...maybe one more night? I’m nervous to be alone and...sorry.”
“Please don’t go. I still need you. The team needs you. Dad needs you. Please, Papa, don’t go. Please don’t leave me.”
Steve sighs and rolls over onto his side, wincing from the tenderness that still lingers. “I’m fine,” he assures when he catches the worried look that flashes across Tony’s face.
The words taste something terrible in his mouth. It was far from great, but he can’t say that out loud.
And he doesn’t want to think about the baby either. But it’s all he can think about. Nothing could fully capture his attention. He tried during Chemistry and again with his math test, but even that did nothing to distract him from his current predicament.
The penthouse still resembles the last time Peter’s been in it. He can’t help but wonder if his dad even lives here. Probably not. He probably owns a bunch of houses.
“Yeah well…” Tony takes a large drink of his wine. “You need more?” He gestures to Steve’s half empty glass.
“Petey?” Comes his papa’s soft voice. Peter wants to scold him for the nickname, but with his head buried in the dirty toilet bowl, his papa doesn’t get the scolding.
Steve puts the empty bag up in the closet, then he leaves the room and shuts off the light behind him. The first thing he notices when he makes his way down the staircase is a delicious smell wafting through the air. His stomach growls at the thought of food. His immediate assumption is Tony had ordered them takeout again, but he’s surprised to find the alpha cooking in the kitchen.
“I love you.” Tony ducks down to press a kiss to Steve’s belly. He peers up when fingers brush through his hair and he smiles at the blue eyes staring down at him. “Hi.”
Steve lets out a heavy sigh. He’s torn, that much Tony can tell, and honestly he doesn’t blame him. He’s a little hesitant to leave their baby for a few hours, but seeing Steve suffering was affecting him too and he wanted Steve to be happy again. A couple hours wouldn’t hurt.
Steve nods and sniffs. He quickly wipes away the tears that roll down his face. One hand falls to his belly and he releases a choked sob.
“I’m not! Oh God!” Steve groans, blindly reaching for Tony’s hand and when he finds it, he squeezes it hard. “Tony, please!”
He’s up way later than he needs to be, but the thought of names doesn’t leave him alone. He’s already dressed for bed and under the blankets with a cup of tea on the bedside table and a book of baby names balancing on his belly. He flips through each page, carefully considering the names he comes across. Some of them work well with both Rogers and Stark. But none of them pop out at him.
Then he picks up on another scent and his head snaps toward his right, finding an incubator and various machines around it. There’s a beta in a white lab coat standing near the machine and typing the readings into a tablet, but it’s not the beta scent that has captured his attention. His son is in the incubator, wires attached to his naked chest, connecting him to the beeping machines.
The world continued to spin and life went on, with or without Captain America. But Peter’s world was altered in the worst way. He lost Captain America too, but he lost a parent first. He lost the most important person to him.
Steve turns on him next, reaching for the arm that has the weapon and twisting it roughly, forcing it behind the alpha’s back. Rollins screams and tries to spin around to issue his own attack, but Steve is faster and presses the alpha deep into the concrete wall, using his weight to keep Rollins pinned.
He needs a name for her. The others never received a name, even when he had planned one out in his head. They probably wouldn’t be allowed to use it anyway. He wasn’t even allowed to be called anything other than Omega. That’s all he was.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures, feeling relieved that the AI was still online and not notifying him of any threats.
The minutes tick by agonizingly slow. He stuffs his hands into the pocket of his hoodie and rocks back and forth on his heels. He tries to fight the urge to glance at his watch; it’s all he’s been doing since he arrived.
The SUV eventually comes to a stop. Steve lifts his head, wishing he could see where he was, but the sack over his head remains, leaving him to rely on his other senses. There’s movement on his left and then the sound of the door can be heard. He’s gripped roughly and forced out of the vehicle. He can barely make out the scent of coffee; Tony was nearby.
Steve keens quietly from the praise. He wishes he could turn over to face his mate, but the alpha’s knot was preventing him from switching positions. He lies contentedly in Tony’s arms, enjoying the warmth and comfort his alpha brought.
Peter waves awkwardly and quickly scurries across the street. Tony watches for as long as he can until Peter disappears out of view, then with a heavy sigh, he retreats back into his tower.
He’s about to give up and retreat to his tower and hide away, but then he spots Peter crossing the street. Tony kills the ignition and slips his sunglasses over his eyes, and after a quick check in the mirror, gets out of the vehicle.
“No,” Steve decides and he holds out his arms. “Let me take him. They need to meet their baby brother.”
One shoots and Tony grabs the side of his neck. He’s met with a sting and his vision blurs. He stumbles back, colliding with the wall. His legs give out and he slumps to the floor.
Tony smiles softly and holds out a hand for Steve to take. Steve takes the outstretched hand and allows Tony to lead him out of the room.
“No.” Tony shakes his head and tries to reach for Steve’s hand to apologize, only for the omega to pull away. Tony sighs sadly. “It’s not your fault. Don’t be sorry.”
Steve frowns at those words. “Take him back? Tony, I’m not taking him back out there. He could get picked up or-”
Peter rolls his eyes and adjusts the strap of his backpack along his shoulder. “They’re pissed. Well, one of them is. The other is...strangely okay with it. I don’t know.”
Steve listens intently to the others speak about their traumatic experiences. It’s sad to hear about the abuse they’ve been through. Steve could relate. He knew what it was like to be abused by not only alphas, but the rest of the world.
“More!” Peter cries and stretches his arms out for the bag of chocolate. Tears are streaming down his face at this point, and Steve can’t help but feel bad. He wonders if he’s being too rough.
Tony sighs. “I’m sorry, kid. That project was supposed to be for me but I thought maybe you’d benefit from it.”
“Not sleeping,” Tony says and he lifts his head. “Although a nap sounds pretty good right about now.”
“Maybe you can,” Steve says and he glances back down at Morgan. She’s asleep. He crosses the room and carefully places her down in the crib, then he’s turning toward Tony again. “Maybe you don’t need me as much as you think. What have I done that’s been good? That proves that I’m what she needs?”
Steve forces himself not to think about the possibility of marriage. He had other things to occupy his already noisy mind. Peter was of course one of them. His son was getting bigger and smarter every day, never failing to captivate Steve with all of the new changes.
“What’s going on here?” Steve asks, his gaze falling on the pile of jeans and then back up to his son’s huffing and puffing form. “Uh-oh. I know what’s going on.”
The tears come first. It’s like a dam has been broken; the tears stream down his face, unable to be stopped. Peter chokes back a sob and rushes toward the toilet. He’d rather throw up than cry. He was supposed to be strong.
Steve continues to go with that lie, and each time he says those words, Tony appears more and more unconvinced. He doesn’t question Steve though, even when it seems like he wants to.
Yay they finally kissed! And confessed how they feel for each other. Now maybe it's time they mate properly.
Bruce frowns at Tony and gestures with his head to follow him when he gets up from the couch. Tony nods and rises to his feet, muttering to Steve something about getting more coffee. Steve ignores him.
Harley has decided that he wanted to be a part of this conversation and he steps toward the new alpha, sniffing him and trying to decide if he was a threat. James does the same, and much to the relief of his parents, he doesn’t growl at the stranger.
With his eyes closed again, Tony drifts in and out of consciousness. It’s not until someone is taking his hand and squeezing it tenderly does Tony force himself awake. The light is still blinding and he gives himself a moment to adjust to its brilliance.
Tony lets out a sigh. “Fine. He’ll be fine. Oh before you go,” Tony says, and he pulls out his wallet and hands Peter a wad of hundreds.
He’s staying with his aunt and he’s not surprised it’s her who questions him. He appears dressed for school, but school was the last thing on his mind. It would be a good distraction from his home life, and he did miss his best friend. He’d go to school tomorrow. But first he needed to find out about his dad.
“She wasn’t having it,” Tony explains as they stroll together through the courtyard. There’s a slight chill in the air, providing the perfect excuse for them to walk close to each other.
They’re about ten minutes apart, and have been for the past few hours. His water hasn’t broken yet but by the way things were progressing, he wouldn’t be surprised if it were to break any minute.
Tony sits up and wipes away the lingering gel from his belly, grimacing at the mess. “I guess this wasn’t so bad. I don’t know why I was expecting something else.”
New clothes are brought to him and he dresses quickly, this time ignoring the flare of pain. The alpha smirks and tugs Steve close to him and that’s when Steve notices the leather collar in his hand.
He doesn’t fuss when Steve takes him out of the car seat and cradles him. He remains fast asleep, content in his father’s arms. The team is welcoming, but understands that Peter needed some time to get accustomed to his new home and all the new people.
It feels right saying these words. For the first time in a long time, he starts to believe them. He starts to believe that his pup was finally safe.
Steve is held down tightly and slammed into the wall, a small grunt leaving him when he hits the hard surface. Cuffs are placed around his wrists, not that it mattered. He was done fighting back.
He would miss his dad and the time they spent together. He would miss their conversations. He would miss his dad’s jokes.
Separating from each other wasn’t the plan Tony had in mind, he felt safer in numbers, but splitting up made the most sense in their situation. They could cover more ground this way and find both their son and the exit a lot quicker. But Tony was still hesitant to leave his mate’s side.
Tony wishes he could pull Steve into his arms and comfort him. “I know. Honey, I know. It’s not your fault.”
Peter giggles again and Steve smiles down at him, his heart bursting with joy just from the sound. The laughter was not only a sign that Peter was enjoying himself, but that he was happy. All Steve ever wanted for his children was to be happy. Their happiness and the happiness of his mate meant more to him than anything else.
Bucky nods and lowers himself down in the chair he’s been occupying since Steve was taken to the room. He had no idea how long it was going to take until his nephew arrived, but he’d stay with Steve through every second of it.
He passes by his father’s room, grateful that the door is still closed. Sooner or later it was going to be opened and all of the belongings nestled inside were going to come out and sorted. Peter hopes that’s a task saved for later.
“Tony,” Steve says before his husband leaves. “We already looked all over. He just doesn’t know. We still have time so don’t worry about it.”
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Peter says, and his eyes flicker in the direction of the statue. “He didn’t keep his.”
Not a day goes by when he doesn’t think about what he’s left behind. He had walked away from not only being Avenger, but his team. From Steve.
Peter nods. “I uh...I went to see him...it’s nice. People really cared about him. There’s flowers and candles…”
“What’s going on?” Peter asks, excitement seeping into his tone. He tries to play it cool by clearing his throat and running a hand through his damp hair. “I’m not in trouble am I?”
Halloween had finally arrived. The Stark-Rogers residence was finally decorated and the rest of the compound had received the same treatment. A party had been planned for the evening after a little trick or treating (for Peter of course).
After the party had ended and everyone had left-Steve had tried to get Bruce to stay, but the doctor assured him he was fine and they’d see him again for his next appointment-all that was left to do was take their son’s new items and place them in the nursery. The room was slightly bare except for the bassinet, a changing table, and a rocking chair Tony had set up. Steve didn’t like the idea of their son sleeping so far away and the bassinet would later be moved to the master bedroom once Peter was born.
Tony growls from the way Steve begs him. He moves faster, shoving the growing knot in and out of the omega’s stretched hole. Steve keens from the pleasure that shoots through him and he clenches down tightly on the knot.
Tony peers at his son and meets his eyes. He’s never seen so much fear and pain in them. He had promised to never hurt his son again and to always be there for him. This was his opportunity to fully gain Peter’s trust and assure him that he’d never leave.
“I feel fine.” Steve shrugs, though he does start to wonder about the bit of nausea he’s been experiencing lately. He doesn’t want to get his hopes up. He’s done that far too many times.
Steve forces himself to his feet and enters the kitchen, deciding to make a pot of coffee before Tony wakes up. It was still too early for Tony to get out of bed, but Steve liked to be prepared.
Sam shakes his head and turns away, immediately pressing his ear to his comm and speaking. “Hey, Cap, we have a situation.”
Sam sighs sadly and comes to stand behind his husband, wrapping his arms around his waist. “I know. But he needs his best friend.”
Peter knew he was risking detention for skipping the last part of AP American History for this, but he needed to get Flash alone so they could talk.
“Hydra. They wanted the serum for themselves. They had a leader, Johann Schmidt. He used to be partners with Dr. Erskine and together they worked on the serum.”
“I don’t know,” Tony sighs. “Sometimes these things happen and we don’t know why. But it’s no one’s fault okay?”
“I’m not…” Tony huffs. “I’m not walking away. I’m taking a break. I didn’t want to be a part of this team anyway.”
With his body preparing for his upcoming rut, he grows anxious and he finds himself unable to sit still. He paces around the space, trying to think about anything other than the urge to mate with the omega upstairs.
“It might be too soon,” Bruce says, then his gaze falls on Tony. “Or can Jarvis figure that out, too?”
“I know you’re not. And the world’s going to know that too. But he’s gone now and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Captain America is still needed. We’re all counting on you.”
He doesn’t get very far in the book. He’s exhausted from running on very little sleep. His eyes are beginning to hurt and he catches himself reading the same sentence over and over.
Steve shakes his head and steps into the kitchen to properly greet Tony with a kiss. “I almost forgot about this part,” Steve winces and rubs at his belly. It’s still flat. Tony won’t allow it to get any bigger.
“It’s...amazing. We get this,” Steve says and he places his hand over the spot where their son was currently kicking.
“It’s better than the couch!” Natasha calls out to them, chuckling when Sam flips her off. “I guess it’s break time,” she says and rises to her feet, stretching and yawning.
The balloons were red and blue to represent Steve and Tony’s color. It sparks an idea in Tony’s mind and he packs it away for later. Their son was probably going to need a suit, and the blue and red colors would be the perfect combination.
Not a word has been spoken since they boarded the jet and took off. They’ve been in the air for only thirty minutes but yet it’s felt like longer. Steve had stopped asking questions once he realized Tony didn’t have any answers to give.
“You don’t remember?” Alexander chuckles. “You must’ve had more to drink than I thought. He’s blond and has blue eyes.”
“Jesus, Tony. What do you know about him? Because from where I’m standing he looks like he’s some whack job-”
Tony’s assured him more times than he can count that he was more than that. And maybe one day Steve would believe that he was a good omega, mate, mother, friend. To some he was even considered a hero.
Steve nods and steps closer until he’s close enough to reach for his son. “Harley,” Steve breathes out, tears springing to his eyes. “Come here, baby.”
“I don’t know if I could ever take your place,” Peter tells the painting, pretending that his father is standing in front of him. “I’m not...you. I want to be, but...no one can ever be you. I’ll be Spider-Man...one day.
“When I first met you, I honestly wasn’t sure what was going to happen between us. I never thought we’d end up here, in this very moment. We were never supposed to work, but fate had other ideas and I’m so glad you decided to give me another try. I promise to love and cherish you for as long as I live. I promise to be a good husband, father, and best friend. I love you and I can’t imagine living without you. So, Steve, will you marry me?”
Tony tenses, remembering that phone call vividly. It was the one phone call he regrets not answering the most. It was the voicemail he can’t bring himself to listen to again.
Natasha gets up from the sofa and disappears to the kitchen. Steve can hear her opening the fridge and drawers; she’s been over enough times that she knows where everything is and is comfortable in his space. She returns with a container of Chocolate Chip ice cream and two spoons, then she takes her original spot beside him.
Tony adds another finger, stretching and scissoring the omega open. He increases his pace, thrusting roughly, groaning in response to the wet sounds that fill the room.
Alexander carefully lifts Tony to his feet, catching him when Tony sways. The door is opening. Tony’s vision is still fuzzy; it’s difficult to make out the figures that come toward him.
Tony pulls away and leans back on his haunches to remove Steve’s jeans. He throws them behind his shoulder, not caring where they land. Steve sits up to slip his t-shirt over his head, exposing his firm and sculpted torso. It’s almost hard to imagine his body changing to accommodate the baby they’re trying to have. No one has ever seen him in any other form. Tony allows his eyes to linger a little longer than usual, picturing Steve’s taut belly swelling with life. A grin spreads across his face the more he envisions it.
Tony smiles and allows his fiancé to pull him in for a dance. They hold each other close, swaying softly to the music.
Happy pulls up to the front of the cool and turns in his seat to wish Peter a good day and to once again to remind him of the weirdos he would gladly take care of if they as much looked at Peter funny.
He tries to remind himself that checking out Steve, his friend, was not allowed. That inner voice-it oddly sounds like Natasha-mocks him, accuses him for still having feelings for Steve. Tony doesn’t listen. He didn’t have feelings for Steve anymore.
“Sure. I haven’t been in...forever but yeah it sounds fun. You’re going to make me wear the mouse ears, huh?”
Steve sniffs and uses one hand to wipe away the tears. His hand finds its way to his stomach. It’s a terrifying thought to know that just beneath his fingertips a tiny life is beginning to grow. It was unplanned and terrifying, but at the same time, he can’t help the spark of joy that courses through him.
Bucky releases a sob and grips the edge of the sink harder, his shoulders hunching and head dropping down between them. Sam comes up behind him and wraps both arms around Bucky’s waist, hugging him close.
The plan to fight back makes Steve’s stomach churn. For years he’s been taught to never fight and to always comply. In the past he’s fought back and the results were always the same. The rough beat downs were one thing, but when Alpha punished him, that was something much, much worse. Steve didn’t want to deal with that again.
He just wants to live a normal life. His papa always talked about that simple life. He couldn’t have the one his papa envisioned for them, but maybe he could have one meant just for him.
Steve comes over and kneels down so he’s at level with his son and lifts the helmet up, revealing the brown eyes he fell in love with since the moment they opened for the first time.
They break a part and Tony tucks the pup back in. He waits until James is comfortable and falls back to sleep before placing a kiss to the pup’s head and leaving the room.
Tony eases off, allowing Steve to take control. It was Steve who had the insecurities and Tony wanted him to be comfortable when they had sex.
“Is she still asleep?” Tony asks when he enters the room, the sound of his voice snapping Steve out of whatever thought he’s having.
He runs a bit of product through his hair, trying to style it like he normally has it. Lately his appearance was the last thing he cared about.
A good job. Steve has never heard those words before. Alpha was always telling him what a selfish and horrible mother he was to the pups. He was the reason why they were sick or dead. It was always his fault when something went wrong.
“Hey,” Tony comes over and takes a seat on the bed beside Steve. “He’s okay. Bruce isn’t going to hurt him.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers. The tears are rolling freely down his face now. He looks broken again, nothing at all like he had been around their friends. He had been wearing a mask then and he’d probably continue to wear it until he was strong enough to remove it for good.
Sooooo I swear Tony isn’t an asshole. He’s confused and can you blame him for second guessing everything? He has no recollection of the night he met Pierce and when he was forced to mate with Steve. For all he knows Steve could be lying. I promise they’re going to talk some more and Steve will tell him everything!
“I’ll help you,” she tells her brother. His face lights up and he cheers. “But you better help or I’m never doing this again.”
“Oh.” Steve frowns and glances down at his lap. He places a hand over his swollen middle. It doesn’t go unnoticed by the alpha.
Happy doesn’t appear convinced but he has no choice but to trust that Steve was right. “If you say so,” he says, then pulls out of the driveway and speeds off toward the road.
Steve crouches down in front of the alpha’s face. “I know you want this,” he says and the alpha’s eyes widen with fear. Pierce struggles again. “Don’t disobey. You want this. You’re only good for one thing.”
The little sound of jingling fills the room, followed by a loud meow. Sam groans when Alpine rushes into the room and leaps onto Bucky’s lap. She purrs contentedly now that she’s around him. Alpine spins around for a moment as she gets comfortable in Bucky’s lap. She rubs her head against his belly and meows again.
Tony takes Steve by the hand and smiles softly. “Let’s go to bed. For once I don’t want to think about them. I just want to be with my fiancé.”
The gift from Natasha is a fluffy red, white and blue blanket with an image of his shield printed on the front. Steve smiles as he runs a hand over the shield, already picturing wrapping his son in it.
So here he was, wandering around the room full of alphas, betas and a few omegas; people he didn’t really recognize. He thought he had seen a few familiar faces. After doing so many of these with the same type of rich people, he started to recognize a few.
“I couldn’t do this,” he says out loud, the words slipping without his permission. Steve peers up at him from where he’s been laboring. The bed had become his nest a week ago, another signal that Peter would be arriving soon. Tony wishes he had paid more attention to the signs. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes. “Talking to myself.”
Peter frowns and slants in his seat. “Maybe I shouldn’t bother. It’s not like Flash cares what I do. I could always just...get rid of it.”
He pushed everyone he ever cared about out of his life because he was afraid of hurting them. But he realized the pushing ended relationships. Relationship requires effort and he was trying his best to put forth as much effort as he could. He wishes he had put more with Steve, but that was the past and the person standing in front of him was his present and future. He couldn’t let another one go.
This year would be the same. Steve wasn’t even going to acknowledge his birthday. He had to practically beg Tony not to do anything. In fact he suggested they set the baby shower for July 4th. He’d rather celebrate the birth of his son than his own.
Happy listens and speaks up when given the chance. He praises her for the good grade on her history paper and asks about her plans for the weekend. Morgan didn’t have any, but she was sure she’d want to spend it with her parents.
“You didn’t have to. I know how you feel about me. We don’t get along and it makes working and living here difficult, I know.”
The progress was slow and had a few bumps along the way, but it was worth the wait. Steve was laughing and smiling again, but most importantly, he was a father again. He never failed to show their daughter just how much she meant to him. She was his everything. She was his whole world.
“Where are they?” Steve demands, his tone and scent bitter. The alpha only stares at him, his lips forming a smirk. Steve growls and slams Pierce back, emitting a small grunt of pain from the man. “Where are they!”
Steve brings her closer, doing everything he can to soothe her. Nothing works. She continues to cry.
“I know. I guess I didn’t know how. And he was dealing with a lot. I didn’t want to add to it you know. Then there was you. I didn’t want him to feel guilty because he had you and I...didn’t have one of my own. He’d do that...I know him.”
Steve doesn’t say those words out loud. He didn’t want to think about his son and Hydra. For all he knew his son could end up being a beta or omega. And even if Peter turned out to be an alpha, would he even be considered perfect? Did such a thing even exist or was Hydra just crossing their fingers and hoping they become the first to create one? Steve rids his mind of those thoughts.
“Friend?” Steve pulls away from Tony, brows furrowed with confusion. “How could someone like him be your friend?”
Tony increases his pace, plowing his fingers through the slick pouring from Steve’s body and filling the room with squelching sounds. Steve releases a small scream when he reaches his first orgasm. Tony watches in awe as Steve gushes around his fingers.
Tony frowns and takes another drink, making sure to gulp down the liquor. He’s ready to order another when Steve makes his way over.
“Shut up,” Bucky mutters and tries to punch Sam’s shoulder, only for Sam to move away and avoid being hit.
“When he could,” Peter says and starts to rummage through his backpack. He pulls out an old journal and opens it, then carefully slips out a piece of folded up paper. “This was the last thing he drew.”
“-so that I and everyone else a part of this marvelous organization can set out what we want to do: change the world.”
“Don’t worry.” Tony pats Peter on the shoulder in an attempt of reassurance. “If you can fend off thugs and save cats from trees then you can watch my daughter.”
Tony slept more these days, which was to be expected. His body was working hard to care for the life they created. Tony of course wasn’t used to being this tired. Staying up for hours came easy to him when he was working in the lab. But now that he was pregnant his body was constantly drained and demanding sleep. Steve was pleased because it meant Tony was finally going to bed at a decent time.
The omega carefully steps into the room, eyes glued to the man just a few feet away. The alpha’s presence doesn’t have Steve cowering and wanting to run in the opposite direction. Steve still keeps his guard up. Learning to trust alphas was going to take time.
“How can you be so sure?” Steve scoffs and shakes his head. He digs into the white rice, only to grimace. The appetite he had was lost now, but he reminds himself of the life he needs to nourish. “Sorry,” Steve mutters and with a sigh he sets his fork down. “I think I’m gonna go to bed.”
Steve comes closer, reaching out until he’s gently cupping Tony’s face. Tony places his hand over Steve’s wrist. He finds himself leaning into the comforting touch, but then he catches himself and pulls away.
“And then he just took off the ring, like it meant absolutely nothing.” Tony huffs and leans back in the chair. Pepper is sitting quietly at her desk across from him, a concerned frown etched on her face. She hadn’t said much when Tony first began to tell the story, deciding to let him ramble before adding her perspective.
, he thinks to himself. The baby was gone and they could move on and not have to worry about it anymore. That was easier said than done of course. Steve needed time to heal, and Tony would be there for him.
He would be lying if he said his curiosity wasn’t piqued. He often wondered what this new world was like and if he’d ever find his place in it. A part of him wants to explore it with Tony by his side, but the voice in the back of his mind reminds him of the danger lurking outside. Alpha would stop at nothing to get him.
It comes off as a joke, but Tony made stupid jokes when he was worried or didn’t have the proper response for a situation. He knew Steve wouldn’t take the small steps and throw himself off the cliff, but with the way the omega was acting, it made the alpha concerned and fear that maybe that’s what was going through Steve’s mind.
Pierce is gasping, his eyes wide and lips tainted red. He crawls toward Steve, reaching out for him. “P-please?”
One minute Tony is clutching onto Alexander’s suit and being escorted out of the room, then the next a sharp pain is radiating through his head. Tony grunts in pain and falls, hitting the carpeted floor with a thud.
The first time Steve meets Sam Wilson is fifteen minutes before his therapy group is supposed to start. Being punctual had always been one of Steve’s strengths. Maybe it was from his time in the army or because at a young age his mother made sure to teach him the importance of showing up in a timely manner.
“Because I knew you’d act like that. You’d be angry and disappointed. I just wanted to figure it out by myself and pretend it never happened.”
“You can stop blaming yourself,” Tony says for what feels like the millionth time since he’s had Jarvis awake.
“Surprisingly no. No one really knows that I’m alive,” Steve says, shifting uncomfortably when the alpha looks him over.
“How does it look?” It’s a question Alpha asks every single time. Ever since the first two failed, the alpha had started asking about the pup’s condition.
There was no point in trying to convince Steve that enough was enough. Tony tried that, but Steve wanted just one more chance.
“Wow.” The response Tony gives is lame and lacks any emotion. That’s when Steve decides to notice. His smile quickly falters and his forehead creases when he frowns.
Tony never thought in a million years that he’d be a part of something like The Avengers. The world already knew him as the famous billionaire philanthropist, and of course his new alter ego Iron Man, but he’s never been seen working with others. Tony worked alone. It was his preference.
Steve whimpers and nods his head. Tony backs away to allow Steve to undress. Steve sits up to discard his shirt, his face flushed as he reveals part of himself. Tony smiles at the sight.
He’d have to spend the next few days in his lab until his rut passed. The beginning wasn’t the worst part, but what was to follow was an entirely different story. Once he started he wouldn't be able to stop.
“Yeah.” Steve nods in agreement. He was already feeling the effects of not getting enough rest. “You going to stay?”
“I’m still happy. Darling, I’m more than happy. I have you and our beautiful kids. That’s all I need.”
Just thinking about the baby erases any previous pleasure. The bump is pressing against his own belly, a painful reminder that in a few months that baby will arrive and turn everything upside down. Tony couldn’t have that.
This time Tony does ruffle Peter’s hair on his way out. Peter watches his dad leave and then turns back to his breakfast with a sad sigh.
“You okay?” Tony asks. This time Steve turns toward him and nods, but it’s clear he’s trying to hide any pain he might be feeling.
Steve rolls out of bed, brows furrowing when the sensation doesn’t let up. It doesn’t hurt, the feeling was odd. He shrugs it off, deciding to pin the blame on dinner. Tony’s cravings were getting to him.
“Wow.” Steve is still in awe. He watches with bright eyes as the image of his son moves in sync with the movement in his belly. Steve glances between the two, chuckling softly when the baby stretches out an arm.
“You too. I mean with…” Tony makes a gesture toward Peter. It’s awkward between them and he can’t help but feel like he’s making it worse. It never used to be this way. If one of them was leaving for a mission, the other was always there to wish them luck and make time for a goodbye kiss. Even before they dated, a friendly pat on the back or a hug was still exchanged. Now there’s none of that.
“No one said you did.” Sam smiles and he comes over to stand beside Steve. He lays a hand over his shoulder and pats the area softly. “I’m happy for you, Cap.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate to do as he’s told and he lies down on the bed, flat on his back. Steve shifts on the bed, his cock straining uncomfortably against his slacks and he reaches down to touch himself, palming his hardening cock to ease the ache.
Tony doesn’t respond and he curls up around his new favorite pillow. It’s not long before his eyes are falling shut and the room fills with the sound of his soft snoring. Steve smiles and reaches over the pillow to get to Tony’s hand, taking it in his own and smoothing his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.
“Hmm.” He thinks and taps the brown colored marker in his hand against his chin. He studies his face and once a decision is made, he nods to himself and uncaps the lid.
Tony doesn’t know what to say and instead he nods. He turns away to hide his tears. Being here, in front of Steve’s grave, was still too difficult. He didn’t understand how the kid came here everyday.
“We don’t say that word,” Tony corrects the pup, “it’s a bad word okay? Little pups like you don’t say that.”
“I know. Do you think we’ll get to see any of those things happen? Or is Tony going to witness all of it?”
“I do,” he answers the question honestly. “Everyday I regret not calling him back. I regret everything. Well, aside from the night you were...you know.”
Walking away from Steve seemed like his only option. But in order to walk away from him, Tony would have to walk away from the team.
“And the pup...they think this is the one?” Tony asks. He can recall the others Steve had told him about. He wonders why the previous pups weren’t chosen. Surely the other alphas chosen to sire those pups fit the bill. Tony didn’t want to press for answers, not when it was a delicate subject for the omega.
“Tired.” Steve huffs and carefully lowers himself into the rocking chair Tony had put together a week prior. “I’m done being pregnant.”
Steve doesn’t even wait for her to finish and he jumps out of bed, cursing to himself when he trips over one of his shoes. He fumbles through the dark, searching blindly for his other shoe. FRIDAY assists by turning on the bedroom light.
“You can have me,” Tony says before kissing Steve again. He wraps his hands around Steve’s wrists and eases them off. He’s careful when he touches Steve, and even more so when he slides the leather jacket from off his shoulders. “Let me, darling.”
“Well, drop that habit. When I say you’re awesome or bad ass I mean it, and you will too. Screw people who say otherwise. Especially that pathetic excuse for an alpha.”
Peter is snapped back to reality when his phone rings. He quickly reaches into his pocket to retrieve it, cursing to himself at the familiar name and picture that appears on the screen. His uncles were going to kill him.
“I think he watched this like a thousand times,” Peter laughs at the memories of watching the movie over and over until they both had the lines memorized.
How could he possibly carry a baby? How could he care for one when he didn’t know the first thing about being a parent?
Peter blinks his eyes open, his lashes sticking together from the wetness that coats them. He sniffs and wipes at his eyes, but it’s not enough. More tears escape and stream down his face.
“What’s going on?” Tony’s voice has the pups quieting down and abandoning their games to rush to him.
“Mr. Stark, let me start off by saying that you are a gift to this world. Your work has helped shape this planet.”
“Never say never but if and when we do, he’s probably gonna be older and won’t need a nursery anymore.”
Sarah was quiet and reserved. Tony isn’t worried about her. She likes her space and he respects that. Peter of course is still too young to do anything. Though Tony does blame his youngest on his lack of sleep.
Bucky shakes his head. Fresh tears spring to his eyes and he takes a deep breath to calm himself before another sob could escape.
It’s easy to get Morgan back to sleep now that she's been fed and comforted. Tony waits beside her crib for a moment, eyes trained on the soft rise and fall of her chest. Once he’s sure she will stay asleep for hopefully a few hours, he leaves the room and makes his way back to the master bedroom.
“Sorry,” Steve sniffs and wipes at his eyes. Dr. Strange offers him a tissue and he gratefully accepts it.
“I think you have it all wrong. I couldn’t live without you. Tony, you’re the only one who can make me feel good about myself. I thought you’d hate me and how I looked, but I was wrong. I feel like myself when I’m around you.”
