“A watering can?” Sherlock inquired, arranging his face to indicate his enthusiasm for the topic of her favourite toy, which was easier than usual due to his genuine enthusiasm for having her home. His chest felt hectic and noisy; if he were to put arms around her again at that moment he was sure he would crush her.
each asked at intervals.
Sherlock, recently furious with worry and a sensation of having been left out of something rather vital to his health and happiness, understood John’s anger but thought it was not only misdirected, but out of proportion to the current situation—which was serious but not truly dire. John leaned away from Rosie, talking through near-gritted teeth.  “For you, that’s as bad as if you left her alone to go out for a pint and to watch a match at the corner pub.”
Despite how easy it had been to predict and elicit, Sherlock nonetheless got a small thrill when his phone almost immediately broke into song, and his screen lit up with
“Not much to work with in December, I notice,” he mused. “It gave me all that much more appreciation for your handiwork.” With one last push and pull at the head of the pin, he seemed pleased and smoothed the shirtfront with his fingers, just beside the buttonhole he’d made for John—a small pine cone, snow-in-summer, the tiniest chick from a pot of hens-and-chickens John had left on the kitchen table for the season. “You look very smart,” Sherlock said with finality.
“You’re just trying to slow me down,” Sherlock protested.
Sherlock made an affirmative hum.
**trope alert!!** **trope alert!!**
He leapt to his feet and by a sweep of his arms and force of his will, steered the supervisor and a few other bystanders rapidly away from the bus. In his usual voice-tone and accent, he announced, “Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps you’ve heard of me, sorry for the—”
“Even if not, you were trying.”
“Or else what?” John demanded.
Sherlock gestured with the tip of the knife toward the cake, questioning, and John shook his head.
John wanted to linger, had no reason to. “One or the other, I think.”
“More than all right,” Sherlock assured him, and rolled onto his side as he gathered up the covers and bundled himself, digging his head gratefully into the pillow. “You should sleep; what’s your morning like?”
He slept restlessly; riding post-orgasmic endorphins into sleep every night but waking at odd, pitch-dark hours to flip his pillow, turn over, and try not to think about the past’s if-onlys and the what-ifs of the unknowable future. He tried to find thirty minutes every day to sit, quiet his mind to the point of emptying it, and most days he managed it, but always he itched to be done, to get up and go, keep moving, and his brain revved back into overdrive in a matter of minutes. He knew it couldn’t hurt; he did doubt, this time around, if it was any help.
more intense than those anyone else—hence communicating them to others was all but a fool’s errand. Instead of swimming about in the muck of it all, people said things like, “I’m fine. That’s nice. That’s no good. I love you.” Simple, meaningless things that acknowledged the existence of emotion without going too far into them, lest we accidentally stick our hands in too deep and spill blood on the carpet.
,” Sherlock repeated, breathless and emphatic.
“There’s no one on there compares to you.”
Sherlock said all this while giving John
My lover--my love--what a wonder you are.
Putting John in the car to the airport was weirdly difficult, despite the fact they’d be back together at home in Boston in only a few days. The glow of having given John the ring—and a commitment—left Sherlock feeling a bit giddy, sentimental, and. . .
“Well, stay the fuck away from me, then,” Mellon joked, “Maybe get something from the doc.”
“We’re not divorced, darling; we were never married.”
“Yeah, no doubt you did. By the time I got word about LoPresti’s baby being born, it was already almost four; I reckoned you were probably on your way in. Wanted to get down here sooner to tell you but I got stuck in an ambush, men’s-room meeting with the GM.” He clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. “You’re good to go,” he said rather than asked. “All I hear from Razor is that you’re doing the right things, I’ve seen you in practice, you’re good.”
John’s mouth beside his ear. “I could watch you forever.”
In an unsettling juxtaposition of cuisines, the curry shop dropped two complimentary gingerbread biscuits in the bag with Sherlock’s goat and John’s lamb. They were from a shop--appeared to be from a box full, separated out and individually re-wrapped in cling film--and nothing to get terribly excited about, but John found himself considering pocketing both.
Mike: Nice!
“I’m using it right now, as you can see.”
“Can’t wait,” Sherlock protested.
Sherlock shook his head, as his mouth was just then occupied with a mango-infused cream puff pastry.
“Look at them fly,” John marveled, as the two watched the silent pyrotechnics of a meteor shower, stars dashing across the sky, trailing glitter in their wakes. “Chasing each other.”
“I think I saw them on the table in the sitting room. Left of my laptop, probably in a pile with some mail and a notice about the city smoke-testing the sewer system.”
, Dadda!” she sobbed.
“Thank you.”
“I like to cast a wide net,” Sherlock said, with exaggerated casualness. “You really never know until you ask. Didn’t I tell you weeks ago you should invite your poet-friend for a threesome?”
you. . .”
John frowned, then muttered, “You’re welcome. Sure, I’d love to come to your party. Thanks for asking.”
Sherlock’s reply was testy. “Luckily, I have one.”
“Then arrange it later,” John added. “Who’s first?”
Sherlock re-erected himself into some semblance of an upright man, putting a long arc in his spine as he stretched his arms overhead. There were flakes of his cum on his belly that pulled at fine hairs, a somewhat disgusting reminder of a rather good time. His phone told him it was nearly two o’clock. Shower. Shave. John was fixing them something to eat and Sherlock was ravenous.
“Gemma got new trainers.”
I like you dressed like this,” he said, and ran his hands over Sherlock’s bicep through his suit jacket and shirt. “Maybe take this off,” he allowed, and with nimble finger and thumb slipped loose the single button, then pressed his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and guided the jacket off them, sliding until it fell. John quickly swept it aside with his foot, a ruffian gesture that stole Sherlock’s breath. One hand pulled him forward by a hand tucked into the front of his trousers while the other found his nipple and plumped and tightened it through his shirt. “Pretty, pretty,
There was a long pause, with no sign of Sherlock typing back a response. John knew Sherlock well enough to recognise he’d just been given what passed for an apology in Sherlock’s vocabulary—admission of wrongdoing with no following expression of remorse—and accepted it more readily than he’d ever been able to when they were still together. Most things never changed, but a few actually did. Tempted to start shifting between apps, scrolling blankly, John reminded himself it was not healthy for the sleep he was so desperate for. Just as he moved his thumb toward the button to black the screen, the vibration went again.
“Sherlock needs an assist-it. He always says that.”
“Of course.” Sherlock’s fingertips in his pocket found the matchbook, moved it into position to withdraw both in one go. “I’ve got a case on, anyway.”
“There’s a decent red there,” Sherlock offered toward John, gesturing to a few wine bottles standing in a crowd at the end of the worktop. “If you like.”
Sherlock sniffed. “Not a bit; we’ve got at least a hundred and fifty items left on that list of things you wanted us to do together. In any event, addicts aren’t allowed to be bored.”
As the two began their descent toward the front door, John said, “Darling, I wish you’d told me your parents would be here; I’d have come earlier.” He scolded, “Shameful behaviour.”
“I’d have laid him out if it had gone on a minute longer, I swear it.”
John wanted not to think about it. “Yeah.” He stepped up to the kerb and waved. “Taxi!”
. Of the two of them together.
“You have a championship ring,” Sherlock reminded him.
“Behave for your granny, Watson,” he instructed, ignoring Mrs Hudson’s plea. “In bed no later than half-eight. John.” He threw John’s coat across the space between them; John lunged to catch it.
“Hello.”
When his turn came to entertain the assembly, Sherlock performed a Shakespeare soliloquy, with humour and pathos in every right place, garnering applause. He even bowed. There was mulled wine by the mugful, and of course the Christmas cake, with its boozy fruit left to plump and soften nearly two months. Sherlock gave gifts to the staff, books for the young ones, pens and stationery for the adults. If John had thought him marvelous before, this once-a-year version of him only served as further proof of his perfection.
He had plans for sturdy, beautiful fireplaces to warm Sherlock’s evenings and smooth-polished floorboards for his slippers to shush across in the morning. Plans to tint the plaster for the walls in whatever shades would please Sherlock’s eye. A pretty table beside a comfortable armchair, with a new stand for Sherlock’s pipes. Shelves for Sherlock’s books and a deep, wide bed in which to love Sherlock and never have to get up to leave under cover of night. A kitchen where he could touch Sherlock’s elegant hand atop the table, instead of beneath.
“It’s going to be strange coming back here tonight, with you on the plane to Chicago.”
“Both,” Sherlock replied. He wet his palm with his tongue, then said, “Tell me.”
It sounded weirdly rehearsed. No doubt Sherlock got asked on dates by better men than John every few hours; it was likely a stock speech he’d developed to let them down easy. John did not wish to be let down, so played it off.
“Do you know anything about electronics? He wants to put some documents into the computer.”
“There’s still the front door to paint,” was Mr Holmes’s reply.
After a few silent seconds which caused John to anticipate another change of topic, Rosie asked, “Is Sherlock cross with me?”
“Yeah,” John said, after a moment’s true consideration of Sherlock’s inquiry. “Yeah, I’m OK. I was thinking a lot today about the idea that no one else on the Thrashers will wear number eighteen, ever again. And tonight, looking up at the banners, and there’s so many guys who’ve been Thrashers over the years, and so few numbers up in the rafters. It really hit me what an honour that is.”
“We’ll sort it out. Talk to you later.”
“It’s not as grim as all that,” Sherlock assured him.
“I don’t
In the end, he did not say anything  to John about George’s glass vial of cocaine or his handful of unbottled tranquiliser tablets. Save something to talk about between goes, in John’s hotel room in Vancouver. Soon.
John laughed, and flipped it over to slide his thumb beneath the flap (gold wax sealed with
Sherlock frowned distaste even though there was no one nearby to see it.
“Come on me,” Sherlock urged. “Use me. Come all over me. Use my prick to make yourself come.”
“That’s easy for you to say, but I’ve only got a few days to make a good impression. I don’t want to leave them with the idea their son’s boyfriend is nowhere near good enough for their precious baby.”
“It is,” Sherlock had grinned at him, inviting John to go along. “You know it is.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said, but he pulled the collar of his coat down in back, leaned a bit to his left. They still remembered all the steps. With three fingers straddling the border of Sherlock’s neck and his over-long hair, John sought and found a bump no bigger than a marble in the middle of a sizable haematoma, judging by the way Sherlock sucked his breath and flinched away from the touch. “Tender there?” John asked.
“How’s Rosie?” Molly asked, and Sherlock felt her watching him from the other side of the lab bench. She never wore her white coat anymore, and she’d had her hair cut up near her jaw. Clicking heels. Matching pullover and cardigan and a single pearl on a fine gold chain. The feminine uniform of middle management.
Below are five available dates/times, please let me know which works best and I will look forward to seeing you both.
“Mycroft?” John ventured, and at last their embrace softened, and they drifted apart. Sherlock drew a handkerchief from the pocket of his dressing gown and passed it to John, who scrubbed the corners of wet, weary eyes.
“Shoulder’s fine. Grip’s fine.” Sherlock was beyond frustrated; there was no reason for him to be missing pucks at all, let alone in one particular area of his goal. “It just depends where I am; they get me low to the glove side and I can’t get across fast enough. Or they’re shooting backhands and even they don’t know where the hell that’s going to end up.”
It was the danger, which had once been a siren’s song to John—irresistible, enticing, erotic—that eventually caused John’s withdrawal in retreat. One too many threats to break his bones from one too many men with cauliflower ears and tattooed knuckles. More than his share of being driven too fast and too recklessly on rain-slick, winding roads. A ludicrous number of abductions; Sherlock had once joked John must by then be the most kidnapped man in Britain, but John had failed to join him in his laughter, only looking grim.
But of course, inevitably, despite his best intentions not to, Sherlock opened his eyes. John was just as Sherlock knew he would be: straining, moaning, open-mouthed and utterly unguarded.
“Better hit the shower so I can get to the airport on time.”
Sherlock’s mother deposited a second book, then excused herself upstairs, admonishing them that they must stay for supper, which made Sherlock look heavenward in search of deliverance.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, and he tilted his head, like a curious bird. “You’ve
George looked regretful, started rising from his chair to make an escape. “Know what? Probably forget I said anything. It’s just I opened my bag last night and there was just, like,
Out on the pavement, John extended his right hand, which felt perhaps even more wrong than parting without a handshake would have, and he immediately regretted it. When Sherlock didn’t respond right away, he regretted it
**trope alert!!** **trope alert!!**
Sherlock suddenly swung back into view. “You’ll come.”
“May as well keep your coat on, we’ll have to go right away or be late,” Sherlock told him. He gestured. “John, may I introduce my parents.”
“Mm.”
Sherlock looked intense and thoughtful.
he replied.
John lazed on a mattress on the deck, an umbrella angled to shield him from the sun, and Sherlock picked through the offerings on the tea stand, filling a small white plate to bring out for him. At last unable to rein in his curiosity, Sherlock directed a casual inquiry at their handsome, if inscrutable, host.
“A poster because it’s easy, or because you like making them and think it will suit the material?” Sherlock challenged. John had already begun doodling cascading cubes in the lower left corner of his page.
Sherlock texted,
Sherlock locked the bathroom door.
“So. . .” Sherlock put in, twisting up the false smile everyone fell for. “Open to novel inquiries.” He tilted his head toward John, who grimaced. The teacher’s pinched smile made her look mildly alarmed.
The tone of the teacher’s voice communicated concern over what they were about to be handed, and Sherlock felt a thrill of anticipation but schooled his expression to minimise the appearance of condoning outrageous behaviour. He arranged a frown, thinking it might spare him, but suspected no matter what came of the meeting John would somehow blame him for Rosie’s troubles.
“Take care. Just think about it. Call me when you decide.”
. In time with his steps, he thought
John chuckled darkly and chimed in with an emphatic, “Yes, she is.”
Thank you for reading and for all the kind and generous comments. I appreciate you more than I can say.
“They’re wonderful.”
“It comes and goes, then?” he asked.
“Are you getting adopted today, too?” she asked him. He nodded. His parents were beaming, and two teenage siblings posted selfies, presumably sharing the occasion with their social media followers. Rosie nodded acknowledgement. “That’s good for you. Congratulations! I’m getting half-adopted.” She pointed toward John and Sherlock. “My dad already has me, but Sherlock is going to adopt me because that makes a family more secure.”
“You shouldn’t have. . .” John said, not knowing what else to say.
John’s palms braced hard against Sherlock’s arse, shoving up and away, releasing and redirecting Sherlock’s aching cock to at last slip past John’s lips, across his tongue, against the back of his throat so he gagged and pushed Sherlock away and then started it all again. The throb of heat in Sherlock’s bollocks thrummed up his length, burst in his low belly, and John nursed the tip of his prick, suck-sipping and swallowing and growling pleasure through burbling lips.
“Everything is fine.”
Thank you, all you Lovely Readers, who followed and enjoyed this story, left me encouraging comments, and waited an inexcusably long time for the ending of this story. I loved writing it, and knowing you are there only makes it that much better. From the bottom of my heart I thank you, thank you, thank you.
He greeted his friends and stood between Sherlock’s and John’s chairs, leaning forward a bit with his hands resting on the seat backs. “You made it,” he commented. He tucked his lips between his teeth and pressed them back and forth a bit. “Nice to see you both.”
There was an open bottle on his bedside table—his contract rider required red wine—that he and his guest had swigged from when their mouths became dry from panting, still mostly full. Sherlock grabbed it around the neck and thrust it to his mouth, taking deep draughts, swallowing noisily. He licked his lips and got into bed, balanced the bottle between his thighs and reached for the open pack of cigarettes on the nightstand. Once he’d lit one and taken a long drag, he maneuvered the green glass ashtray closer to the edge of the table where he could reach it better. He sighed out the smoke, feeling rattled.
Seeing Sherlock--every time--was a pleasant shock. From every angle he was a different man--reedlike and severe standing upright in a finely tailored suit; soft-shouldered in his dressing gown and pyjamas; graceful motion and perturbing stillness; eyes wide and narrow--and in all of these, John had yet to find an angle where he wasn’t distressingly handsome.
John smiled a little and said, “I believe you. I want the same for you.”
“Can I have a phone?”
“So do what you need to do,” Lestrade finished, as he signed his name and wrote his room number. “and we’ll see how you look tomorrow night.”
Sherlock huffed a breath of a laugh through his nostrils. “True enough. Things he thinks are a waste of his superior brain.”
“Gorgeous.”
George turned toward him.
As John let himself back into the strange flat, Sherlock was half-slumped on the sofa, miles-long legs extended, ankles crossed, one heel on the coffee table. He dragged his fingers through his hair, dug in and scratched, disarranging the dark waves in a way that made John wonder if he was being secretly filmed for a prank; it was too much. He cleared his throat.
“Yeah, aw’right. Sign there.”
It was past ten o’clock by the time John and Sherlock made their way via low-lit, raised wooden walkways across the resort’s central courtyard, over stretches of white sand  and among small clumps of shrubbery, to the far side of the property and the generic white box of a nightclub with
“Not a cigarette lighter, then.”
“My own,” John smiled at him. “My wish come true.”
Sherlock hummed agreement around a mouthful of buttery toast, and said, “Agreed.” They finished eating and John stretched back in his chair, arms above his head, squinting at the sun.
John stepped forward to shake their hands, urging them not to get up on his account.
“I’ll send someone,” Sherlock said wearily.
Hello Year Two Families,
“I’ll put Harry is my aunt,” she reported. “Even though we don’t see her.”
“Come,” Sherlock whispered back.
“Worth a try, then. If you’re feeling, you know.” It was clear John still held a pro hockey player’s full complement of superstition; he was hesitant to utter a word anywhere close to what both of them were—silently, in the back of their minds—worried about. Just slightly worried. It was too early to name it. And the fear of it could bring it on—any fool knew that—so it was better to never let the thought enter one’s mind in the first place. Don’t invite the vampire to cross the threshold. Don’t speak of the devil, lest he appear. And don’t, for god’s sake, ever suggest you or someone on your team might be showing signs of—
Sherlock tapped and swiped at his phone, tying up loose ends and sending his brother an invoice for his time, despite the fact the case had nothing to do with him. Sometimes he approved the payments, either out of forgetfulness or disregard—surely not because he appreciated the fact Sherlock had just saved the nation countless costs both in currency and public good will. From the corner of his eye, he could see John stealing glances at him every few seconds. He smile-frowned, huffed through his nostrils, truly frowned, hummed. Sherlock caught him at it, raised his eyebrows. “Something?” he asked.
“Well, dangerous for me. If they found out I’d been lying to them for eighteen months.”
“I want you to adopt her. I want her to be yours, just as much as she’s mine.” John reached across and rested his hand on Sherlock’s knee, briefly, a reassuring brush of fingers. “I’ve always wanted that for her. And for you.”
“Sign for this package?” asked the delivery driver standing there.
“Of course not.”
The judge shrugged, smiling, “I don’t know. They don’t tell me. I only do my work, and then once that’s finished, the youngest person in the room gets to read the name on the card—see the little white card hanging there on the string?—and tell us who gets the gift. My work is to ask you and your parents some questions, and then we’ll sign our names. Shall we start?”
Sherlock cursed and sucked a too-loud breath, then hid it in a faked cough. He lay his hand on John’s elbow. “Finish ourselves by hand; imagine the mess.”
Thurston piped up, “Buncha cake-baking party clowns; their wives have a support group to cry about their tiny, shriveled dicks.”
John was acutely aware that cinnamon-sprinkled cappuccinos in paper cups were not in his meagre budget, but it was the first properly cold day of winter, and he’d left his gloves in the flat. His fingers were stiff with cold and a tasty hand-warmer would not go amiss, even if it did cost him three pounds he really could not afford to part with.
“I cannot imagine that could possibly be true.”
“About a three then,” John said knowingly, without sarcasm.
By the day of John and Rosie’s move, he and Sherlock had already been avoiding each other’s company for over a week, sending tersely worded texts and emails only when unavoidably necessary. When one knew the other was in, he made a point of staying out. The last time they’d been in the same room for more than a minute or two was when they’d set Rosie on the sofa between them and John explained that he and Sherlock just weren’t able to get on anymore, even though they’d tried, and so it would be nicer for all three of them if they had another flat—one for Dad, and one for Sherlock, and
“Brawlers road trip?” Sherlock joked lightly.
“All right,” Sherlock agreed, sounding less than convinced. John called up his favoured music app and rubbed his palms together, then twined his fingers and stretched them.
The Brawlers had an out-of-the-ordinary daytime flight to Long Island, and were mandated to be on the bus from their hotel at nine sharp. With just ten minutes to spare, Sherlock found himself wondering if he should knock on George’s door, as there had been no sign of life from him yet that morning. Sherlock was cross about even having to consider it; there was no way in heaven or hell he was going to spend the season nannying a grown man who’d been in the league long enough to know how to get himself to a bus on time. None of it forecasted positivity for their stint as road-trip roomies.
A grumble came back, sounding distinctly like, “What for?” but Mrs Holmes went anyway.
“Oh, here he comes—
The desk-woman pointed. “In the gym.”
“G’night then. Happy Christmas.”
The typing stopped. He sniffed and rubbed the heel of his hand across his cheek.
“She’ll like that.”
“All right, then. Enjoy the rest of your night.”
“I’ll wear it proudly.”
“There have also been a few incidents of putting hands on classmates, not hitting, but taking up personal space, even after the child has asked her to stop.”
“Never,” Sherlock moaned, and touched his midsection.
“Whatever you like.”
John looked stunned, smiling, but didn’t reply. His hand clamped hard around Sherlock’s, and he lifted it to press a kiss against Sherlock’s knuckles.
As he started out into the hallway, on his way to the bath, Sherlock came down the steps, and in his hand was a thick stack of the red envelopes.
at you. Look at you sucking my dick.” The contempt in his voice was undisguised; every third exclamation tilted over into unguarded pleasure, more wordless than not, but most of what he said was unmistakably disdainful in tone. Sherlock was a cocksucker and a queer, certainly no real man, probably no worthy person.
“Oh?” Sherlock encouraged him, and reached beneath the hem of his t-shirt, hands sliding up along the delicious geography of John’s muscular back.
John felt agitated and tired, suddenly, both at once.
John’s steps as he followed were dread-heavy, and he hesitated on the landing until Sherlock gestured at the open door. John nodded, forcing a cordial expression onto his face though his eyes betrayed him in the half-second before he looked away, directing himself toward the kitchen table to set down the pizza in its box. He had Rosie’s rucksack over one shoulder.
Sherlock reached between them to fold the laptop and set it aside. He clicked off the lamp and reached for John, nudging and wriggling his way into an embrace, head on John’s chest, curled tight beside him cradling John’s shoulder beneath one hand. He dug in, nosing close.
“Fine, then.”
“Would you like to call Dad and say good night, Watson?”
, and a short spoke from each side.
“You disapprove,” Sherlock accused.
Alex George had left a handful of pockets-emptied effluvia on the desk in the suite’s sitting room: key card, wallet, crumpled face tissue with blood stains apparent. Four dark blue Adderall, a pale blue Klonopin broken in half, and four round white pills each etched with a “10” on its reverse side. Sherlock wanted to laugh, or to scold him. No one should be so careless with their stash. Sherlock himself would never have left a single shattered sliver of even the tiniest rock of heroin, back when he’d been an addict. Nevermind that one could find oneself disastrously exposed by such wanton disregard for privacy; any fiend worth half a penny would have that pile of sweets pocketed and out the door in an eyeblink. A smirk bent up the corner of his mouth as he swept the pills into one palm with the edge of his other hand, clearing the table of Alex George’s crumbs.
“You are a bit, Watson.”
“Kind of. Sheep don’t wear clothes, though. Except Shaun; he sometimes wears a bike helmet. Or sunglasses once.”
“It’s not guilt,” Sherlock fired back.
“I had a patient recently,” John said, leaning against the sink, with a few swallows of water left in his glass. “Proper
John was dozing, exhausted from a day’s work and blissfully sated from an evening in Sherlock’s narrow bed. Through the strange silence of the house late at night, he heard the distant chiming of a tall clock in the Colonel’s withdrawing room, through shut doors and down winding steps, felt more than counted the twelve tones, and knew he must rouse himself before he fell asleep–once too often he’d been petted awake by Sherlock’s smooth, cool hand on his arm or chest, hissing whispers that it’s nearly morning, you must go. Better to go now.
John looked pleased with himself, nodded, frowning, as he skated in curlicues around the crease. “Not bad.”
The noises upstairs went on for hours. Furniture moving, Sherlock walking at various paces, a vacuum cleaner, a blender. Ice cubes being poured into a plastic bucket. Violin tuning, followed by something short John recognised but did not know the name of, and he hummed along. A blast of pop music that was quickly turned down to nothing--Sherlock had been taken by surprise at its volume. The rattle of the pipes all through the house, for longer than it took to do washing up or to take a shower. The unmistakable smash of something glass hitting the floor, Sherlock shouting an unintelligible three-syllable curse, doors slamming.
Sherlock turned his head just enough to bite down on John’s pectoral muscle through his t-shirt, reminding him to be grateful for what he had in the moment.
“Three,” Rosie corrected.
“So, safely assuming that your speeches and lunches and meetings on the west coast were productive and pleasant and that you were brilliant,” he began, “I feel I must ask whether you met anyone interesting.”
“The sun? I’m afraid it can’t be helped. Natural order of things.” John bit down on a grin. “Anyway, I brought you this.” John set down a cup of lemonade he’d concocted, generous with both lemon and sugar, and with a bruised sprig of mint pushed down into it. Beside it, a tin of ginger sweets.
Sherlock’s watch was losing time. Just a few minutes a day, but it was vexing to have something upon which he relied become suddenly unreliable. It would have to be sent to London, to Arnold & Son, for repair by someone who knew what they were doing; the local clockmaker was half-blind and could never be trusted to fit the delicate works of Sherlock’s watch together properly once they were out of the case. The only other clock he trusted was one he wound himself–an 18th century German one on the mantel in the Colonel’s study.
“That definitely doesn’t sound like not even having to talk.”
“Sorry, darling. What’s it called? Tiger. . .”
He sat down with his laptop, at the table, facing the open door (another cause of his pain: as he could never put his back to a door, he was forced to sleep on his bad side; the room was all wrong for him; he still hadn’t found another one suitable and cheap enough). Just as his fingers settled on the keys, there came a distressing racket above him, Sherlock’s huge feet, not walking. He was here, there, and everywhere, random landing spots for every step, some light, some heavy. It carried on for long moments, then stopped.
“Yes, make me,” Sherlock said decisively, and didn’t stop to hang his coat but rather left it in a heap on the floor where he’d let it fall from his shoulders. “Make me. . .
“Yeah, Sherlock, hi.”
“She’s not in my family except that I grew in her. If it’s a family tree, you have to put just people in your family—do you put only people you know?”
He jogged past the second set of gates, keeping his gaze fixed ahead of him. An oncoming young mother with a toddler kicking in a pram forced him to swerve left, and once he’d passed the imaginary barrier into the park, it was so easy as to be nearly automatic. Sherlock took a sharp turn, ran on, cutting off the half-mile or so it would have taken to circle around. Just past the halfway mark, he knew of a particular left-turn path that would take him past a derelict woodframe band shell surrounded by patchy grass and deteriorating wood benches. Not the park’s most appealing feature at the best of times, on a late weekday morning it was universally ignored by playground-bound nannies with their charges, and offered no helpful track for businesspeople cutting through on their way from the banking district to meetings in legal offices across town. But every city had a place where the friendless convened, and given its proximity to coffee shops with public restrooms, the nearby steady stream of people who might be persuaded to part with their spare change, and the police having better things to do than to discourage the daily roll-call of vagabonds and runaway teens, the disused old stage had become that meeting place.
“I want to go
"The Yips" is a term used to describe a player's fine-motor skills inexplicably collapsing for reasons not related to injury (in other words, it's more likely a psychological condition). Some players are able to overcome a case of the yips and return to their previous level of play; others never do, and their careers are ended by it.
“Or blood,” Sherlock fired back, with an arch expression of the eyebrows. John laughed. Sherlock added casually, “And someone is stealing women’s shoes in Chelsea.”
“Aww!” she protested, stomping one foot theatrically and pushing out her bottom lip. It was clearly put on—a caricature of emotion—but John played along a bit.
Steven the real estate developer, not pacing so much as stalking the room to mark his territory. Sherlock had offered his road schedule and Steven arranged a trip—under what pretense Sherlock neither knew nor cared—to meet him in Vancouver. Not the team hotel; Steven had booked a five-star suite elsewhere, upscale but generic—with the drapes pulled shut to cover the skyline, they could have been anywhere in the world. Sherlock shrugged away the offer, but Steven was already pouring—tequila in a shot glass, predictably mundane.
“No, but I need the toilet.”
“I happen to know there’s an excellent jeweler nearby.”
“Dude, you’re starting.”
Mike: OK, last one. Date/Marry/Kill—
“Can I suck you off?” Sherlock asked. There were many things he wanted, as ever, but there was something about the rough way Steven held his head, caught him with a tight grip beneath the chin, Sherlock found particularly. . .if not exactly pleasing, at least arousing.
Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes. He wanted to snap back that he hadn’t played at a ‘basics’ level since before he grew hair on his bollocks.
“Finish your food and clean your teeth. I have plans for the rest of the evening,” Sherlock ordered, and John needed no second invitation. He swept what was left into the paper bag it had been delivered in, crushed the top of the bag shut and binned it in the kitchen as he passed through to the bath.
“Sherlock, dear heart, your father needs you.”
Sherlock’s phone buzzed with another notification that pleased him.
“I’ll pass,” John demurred, though his gaze was directed at Rosie as he spoke. “Holiday tube schedule; I do want to get back before dawn.” He tipped his head toward the door. The violin was drawn down and tucked safely beneath Sherlock’s arm as he itchily turned the knob that loosened the bowstrings.
“They have a cleaner come in before the next renters arrive. It’s what we paid for.” Sherlock turned on lights and checked mirrors. A round, magnifying one extended from the wall on a brass arm. “Don’t ruin this for me, John; I’ve been looking forward to it.”
“Yeah, probably.”
“Of course I fucking know him. Don’t tell me you--”
John was halfway to the hospital before he remembered his therapist.
“Watson. Oh.” He set down his pen across the page of his ledger book, its figures swimming in front of hazy eyes. “This is a valuable lesson.”
Sherlock sucked a breath. He sat on the edge of desk with one jiggling foot on the chair, and waited.
John staged a hand-wringing gesture, as if warming them. “She always has been,” he agreed. Rosie was at the top of the play structure with her friend Lulu and two boys, all instructing each other about new and more intricate rules for their game of make-believe, never seeming to get around to the actual playing bit. John lifted his chin in her direction, to call up to her. “Rose, look who’s here.”
“So, this flat. . .”
?” Sherlock asked, entertained by the story but skeptical.
“I wasn’t sure your hourly rate,” Sherlock said, by way of reply.
He didn’t look away from the electron microscope’s screen, displaying the latest fashion in influenza viruses. “Finally taller than one of her schoolmates,” he reported. “I suspect some degree of malnutrition in the rival, though; he’s a recently arrived refugee. No doubt he will surpass her by the first of the year.”
As John stepped through the door from the landing, he was met with a chaotic mess of a flat, perhaps not its usual state (though he had his doubts) as most of what caught his eye as he gazed around the sitting room was an explosion of glinting, glistening, green and gold holiday decorations. Boxes sat open, overflowing with garlands of faux pine, oversized velvet bows in various shades of red, strings of small lights. There were two trees, which John knew by smell were the genuine article, one in front of each of the windows on the Baker Street side, awaiting their tarty Christmas finery.
“I’ve probably got a couple—”
“I put in several,” Sherlock assured her. John was already heading for the landing, but Rosie would not be moved.
“So it says. Anyway, there it is.” John crossed his arms over his chest. After a long pause, Sherlock turned halfway, looking over his shoulder.
wanted to kick himself. Eventually Sherlock set the unlit cigarette he was fumbling with between his teeth and put John out of his misery.
John, determined to keep the mood light—no small feat given Sherlock’s equal determination to wallow in his depths of misery—joked back, “From
Sherlock shifted his bags and John heard bottles rattling. Decided to make a cup of tea. He wondered why Sherlock had not yet gone upstairs. After another half-moment, Sherlock asked, “Do you like paté?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Later, still before midnight but after they’d let time pass to digest their meal, John on his phone, typing with his thumbs and occasionally grunting a light laugh at whatever he was reading in response while Sherlock bundled a cloth bag full of their dirty pants, socks, and workout gear and set it out on the landing to be picked up by the laundry in the morning.

At last, some truth.
Mags: Oh, I don’t know. We’re pretty tough.

“Oh, you got one, too? That’ll be Sherlock, as well,” she told him. "He pretends not to be sentimental, but every year at Christmas he makes everything so beautiful. Has his little party. He always gives me the most thoughtful gifts--lovely things I’d never get for myself. Last year it was a cashmere coat, my shade of red, with a bit of orange--I can’t wear blue-red, it makes me look sickly--cut so beautifully it reminded me of one I had in the 1960s, swinging London town, you know.”
“We got this, boys. Go hard up-ice. Get in their heads when we can, tell’em who they are.”
, as it had begun as him tracing letters for her to guess, though over time it was much less structured. He practiced his Arabic, which was shockingly rusty, right to left across her shoulder blades, then slowly followed a serpentine route down her spine. After a few minutes he could sense the sinking of her slender arms toward the mattress, and dipped his head to see her mouth had fallen slightly open and her eyes were closed and still. She had John’s same long, gold-blonde eyelashes.
“Very well.”
butter on it.”
Mrs Holmes looked alarmed. “You’ll come again tomorrow, for tea. When do you leave?”
She sank into her usual posture, school rucksack on her back and the purple overnight bag sagging beside her feet. There were clothes and pyjamas and toys and books enough for her upstairs, but it seemed she had new favourites every week. Things she wanted close by, to remind her of John while she visited. Things to show off to Sherlock. This time there was a book about rocks she’d borrowed from the school library, two fashion dolls and their own little bag full of clothes and tiny shoes and miniscule hair brush, and the little flannel blanket she’d dragged around behind her for the best part of her first four years. John had seen it rumpled up in the bag when he’d put in her glittering pink trainers (lately she only wanted to wear rain boots), but hadn’t mentioned it or asked her about it. Let her find comfort where she needed to.
“Oh, John! What’s the matter, dear?”
John laughed, then frowned. “I know the one you mean. What’s her name? Damn. It’s not as if you can just search for
“I just might let you,” John said, in a tone that might be serious or joking, and then kissed Sherlock on the cheek as he passed.
“Right,” John allowed, with knowing sarcasm. “Anyway, if the lump’s still there in a week, have it looked at.”
“I don’t want this. You can have it,” she told him, pushed her plate toward him, and began to slip into her coat.
“Thought you’d like to know the woman we met in Comfort’s clinic had the gold ingot safely removed from her sinus cavity by a competent surgeon. She’s in recovery and the gold is in evidence.”
Sherlock, who had not taken so much as an aspirin in five years, thought a handful of anything chased with a bottle of cabernet was just the solution he needed. Immediately following that thought was a fresh wave of panic, and he braced himself with one hand on the wet tile wall, hung his head and tried to breathe through his nose, waiting for the vomit to rise again.
He clasped her hand and they crossed the road. No doubt it was Sherlock who’d bought her the sweets; he was the fun one, after all. Rosie hadn’t got there, though, and John couldn’t bring himself to say.
He tied this buttonhole, as well. Holly and a birch twig--he’s clever that way. Sees things others wouldn’t, finds their beauty and shows it to you.
Sherlock felt the bridge of his nose pinching. Finally, he asked, “Do you know the phrase

“I’ve a case in which a particular plastic surgeon appears to be stashing contraband inside his patients, then fetching it out again later.”
She sought clarification. “Like a bothering thing?”
“Thanks,” John said, and the counter-girl passed the cup across to Sherlock, who handed it over. His hand was massive; the cup looked miniature in his grip.
“Not my boyhood bedroom, either, I’m afraid,” Sherlock offered apologetically, as they fitted easily into one another’s arms, hands stroking over shirtfronts and reaching into rear pockets.
Sherlock was clearly used to people doubting him and readily replied, “I have a foolproof memory-organisation tool called a--” he huffed again and shook his head. “Nevermind. I remember things.” He began banging about in his cupboards, replacing the sauce pot with another, slightly smaller one, and reaching for a glass cannister full of sugar.
“I’d have wanted to snog you in the boys’ toilets; look how pretty.”
“You know, John,” he began, and unbuttoned his shirt, peeled it back and off as he spoke. “I hope you know. I’m yours alone. And always.”

After she’d added
“I know,” he acquiesced.
“Did he use the term
“I’m not shocked,” Iain assured.
“Pity us.”
“I think having dance class right after school is a lot for her,” John said, hanging his coat on the hall tree, but not taking off his shoes. "It was the same last week.”
“This fella’s going to decorate his Christmas tree.” Rosie and John had pushed the narrow coffee table against the front of the sofa so there was room for them to sit on the floor; Rosie picked out small figures of animals, people, and vehicles from a basket that was usually kept under the table, and arranged them on the floor—slightly haphazard rows of soldiers all facing the same direction—told John their stories as she went. Now and then he added one, but mostly Rosie was content to do it herself, only wanting him present and attentive. They’d been lining up figures together since she’d been a toddler; they called the game Animal Parade despite the fact of other species and that it was not much of a parade, given no one marched anywhere and there was no particular occasion to mark.
“I’m not trying to start an argument.”
JW: Dinner and a movie! If this was one of those know-your-mate quiz shows you’d have lost already. We watch movies and eat together. On the team plane, that’s how we passed the time. Kind of how we got to know each other.
“Yep,” John interjected. “I’ll let you know. Should be pretty normal, I think. If anything changes—”
The second they were out of the drive, Sherlock wound down the window and liberated a packet of cigarettes from his satchel, shook one loose and lit it brazenly, while John watched with an expression of mild concern.
Mrs Hudson, with her hands clasped together in front of her heart. John alternated between feeling as though he was pulling it off, and feeling like a complete wanker.
“If I could get hard again this quickly I’d already be pulling your ankles up on my shoulders,” John told him, and Sherlock shivered something like an orgasm aftershock. Mugging, John stated the obvious, “I’ve missed you.”
John went on staring, smiling, until Sherlock felt a growling low in his belly and had to look away—didn’t look away—couldn’t—finally licked his lips and turned his gaze over one shoulder, toward the front of the house. John exhaled something not unlike a groan, arousal and frustration, a touch of amusement; Sherlock found it a satisfying sound to hear. Coast clear, he fixed fingers and thumb around John’s chin and guided him, meeting him halfway and kissing hotly, as if they would not be forced out of it by the intrusion of one senior citizen or another, sooner than they wished. Sherlock kissed John a fervent promise of more to come, confirmed it with one roaming hand under the edge of the white lace-hemmed tablecloth.
In the last minute of play, Boston put in the tying goal, and overtime seemed inevitable. Sherlock’s shoulders ached. Faceoff at center, Bouchard couldn’t get control of it and all at once Sherlock faced an onslaught; all he saw were gold sweaters charging at him, had no sense that his teammates were even on the ice, let alone in the mix. A rocket of a shot from up high, and Sherlock saw it a mile away, an easy save. They’d go into OT, where his guys dominated; the Rush hadn’t won in overtime since the previous October, over a year earlier. Three-on-three sudden death was just not something they had figured out. Sherlock twitched into position, ready to flick the puck aside and behind him, so his D could pick it up and run out the clock.
Sherlock sighed extravagant displeasure at being reminded the two were not in London at their leisure, but rather on a working holiday of familial obligation and real estate investment. They were expected at the family home in under ninety minutes; Sherlock was still naked in bed with one leg outside the covers. He flexed his toes. John pinched them in a half-fist on his way to his suitcase, open on the floor.
Sherlock started undressing. “They’d better get here soon or they’ll find me braced and waiting,” he threatened, and he could already feel the way his hands would stick and slide on the polished surface of the desk, and how his calf muscles would strain as he rose up on his toes.
“Love having you,” John told him, and released him long enough to slick his own cock, and a moment later he was thrusting his hips hard against Sherlock’s, his thighs tensing against the insides of Sherlock’s own, stroking himself against his hand and Sherlock’s cock. “Love fucking you. You like it.”
John huffed a little laugh through his nose, and nodded, and shifted the grip of his hands on Sherlock’s back, a demand that Sherlock not let him go just yet.
“I think to keep herself from lashing out physically,” the teacher inserted, “Which is actually a good thing. We want them to begin disciplining their own bodies, at this age.”
John’s face rumpled in that affectionate way it sometimes did, all the best lines in his face appearing as he grinned at Sherlock. He tugged at Sherlock’s trousers. “Let’s get naked,” he suggested, no growl in it at all, “And c’mere. Just come here close to me,
No. Those were his own problems to address. John was angry at
“How can you—” Sherlock began, in his usual voice, which surprised him.
He hummed, sounding grim. “Where were you, John?” he asked. “Last Christmas?”
“Haven’t seen Jordan tonight,” one of the men offered, and pulled out his mobile, started tapping at its screen. “I’ll text him and see if he’s coming.”
JW: I can’t speak for anyone’s personal views but now that the league is on the record, personal views have to be secondary when it comes to anything obviously tied to the league, the players, or staff. There are thousands of people employed by the league whose names no one knows; it’s equally about them and how they’re treated at their jobs. Hopefully they feel supported and maybe more secure now that the league has said unequivocally that sex and gender minorities are not going to face discrimination, and that targeting or harassing anyone isn’t going to be tolerated. It was just the right thing to do, as I said.
, but John responded before he sent it.
John was waiting by the baggage carousel, and Sherlock walked straight to him so that John had no choice but to embrace him; Sherlock held fast and breathed a slow, conscious breath against John’s chest. In. And out.
“Beth’s already invited us for Thanksgiving,” Sherlock informed him, unashamedly watching John as he left the bed, naked and hard-bodied and always so tempting. Sherlock checked the time once more, made calculations, felt grim and disappointed.
“Not entirely, no.” John had taken Sherlock’s hand then, kissed his fingers and given him a look. “Shut the door, darling; it might get loud.”
Street,” Sherlock prompted, correcting at least one of Steven’s misperceptions.
John gave him a wink and a reassuring smile. “No, I did; it’s lovely. And anyway what’s important is that we got away together. This has been absolutely fantastic. Every minute.”
—and tilted his hips back where he wanted them. He was close at Sherlock’s back as he thrust his cock into the space he’d slicked, pinching Sherlock’s hip, shoving at the meat of his buttocks with rough fingers, his chest thudding up against Sherlock’s back when he moved to slide between Sherlock’s thighs. He went hard, groping and gripping to pull Sherlock to him, against him, and now and then they caught each other’s gaze in the portrait mirror, and Sherlock shivered—taken—giving in.
“Watson, how lovely!” the lady of the house gushed, clasping her hands together in front of her chest. “Your impeccable eye for beauty hasn’t failed you.”
Sherlock and John kept missing each other, strings of unanswered texts, poorly-timed voicemails, and missed calls. John was forever in meetings and had a habit Sherlock found loathsome, of silencing his phone and placing it screen-down on the table in front of him. He texted while Sherlock was at the gym. Called while Sherlock was at practice. Attempted video chat when Sherlock was in meetings of his own, upright in dark corners of nightclubs or reclining open-thighed on a handed-down futon sofa in a half-step-up-from-student flat.
“There’s a decent curry shop around the corner--”
“I’m about to ask a weird question,” John said. “And if I’m wrong I’m going to be so completely humiliated, I’ll fling myself out that window there.” He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. Sherlock tilted his head, lifted his eyebrows questioningly.
“You can have anything you like there. You’ve only ever
“No, it’s fine. Alarm’s going soon, anyway. You’re up late. Can’t sleep?”
“Come here.”
“The cane. Well. And the limp.” He was afraid to take another step, for fear the pain and its outward expression would return as suddenly as it had (apparently) gone.
“Got home from school OK?”
Sherlock slapped his thighs and stood, brushing his palms down his chest to clear away any lingering crumbs.
John took up his cup. “I’ve biscuits and brownies and things, if you’d like something?” he offered, starting the quick walk down the foyer to his front door. Sherlock lingered, then followed. As they passed into the little flat, Sherlock looked around, turning this way and that exaggeratedly.
“You make the fire; I’ll bring the slick.” Sherlock passed through to the bedroom, and to his pleasure, John let go a complaining whimper of sexual frustration as he went.
Less than an hour later, Rosie was loose-limbed and gawp-mouthed beneath her covers, having become pliable and cooperative—downright cuddly—after her chat with Sherlock. John, himself exhausted near to giddiness, assumed a stretch on the sofa from which he knew he might not recover. After setting his alarm for the morning, he indulged an urge he knew might lead him toward trouble.
“It is too!” She stretched flat on her back on the sofa, pushing at the side of his leg with her bare feet. “I need more
“Who said this?”
“Ludicrous but perhaps necessary,” Sherlock replied, and they danced around each other as Sherlock went for the kettle and John plated takeaway sushi from the organic supermarket, irreverently accompanied by cranberry and pecan-studded bread rolls with butter, and two ginger beers in brown glass bottles—a real bachelors’ feast.
She rolled and reached, helping herself, her fingers sliding over the screen and changing the ratio, losing his place. John sighed and pushed his reading glasses to the top of his head, massaged the headache out of his eyes with thumb and two fingers. “It’s not even a game,” he grumbled.
They drank and grimaced and swirled the smoky brown liquid around the heavy bases of their tumblers. John’s eyes closed, long enough to slowly draw breath then softly sigh it away. The soldier, home from the battle. Sherlock slid down to stretch his legs and his back, letting his shoulders slump comfortably. The junkie, in the bliss of the fix.
He was famished, hurried to clean and put away his tools, then to clean himself–even changed his shirt–and was first of the men to arrive for supper, greeting the cook warmly and getting in her way–dipping a finger in the stew, tearing off the end of the bread loaf and eating it in too few greedy bites–until she swatted and scolded him.
“Not on your life,” he smiled. “Thirteen. When you’re thirteen you can have a phone.
Sherlock moved to the hall tree to comply with the order, and his mother said, “It’s nice to finally meet you. We’re in London so seldom, and the last three times we visited, you were overseas.”
As each child moved away, they were handed a gift by a volunteer, and many of them turned back to call out their thanks. Some came back around after having opened it to show how it worked, tell how it filled in a gap in their collection, say it was just what they wanted. John was astonished by how easily and wholly they believed in the magic of it. Of a crippled, sad man in a silly suit, who was going to tell their mum they loved her.
Sherlock hummed agreement, returning to his phone to read the morning’s news headlines. There was a lengthy silence while George finished his coffee, and Sherlock began to wonder why he hadn’t yet moved away from the table.
He saw the effect of his expressing dismay; John tightened his lips into a frown, briefly, and inhaled quiet but long, a steadying breath.
Sherlock hummed displeasure at his brother deducing the facts of his life.
“Forgot to change your emergency contact,” John said knowingly, and already he was feeling normal-sized and the right temperature, and with all the correct sensation in his limbs. He sat up and drew his legs over the edge of the bed, thinking of where his coat and wallet were so he could go free Sherlock from the grip of the NHS, probably Against Medical Advice.

Knowing it was time for final goodbyes, John tapped out,
“Magic,” John murmured.
John dirty-smiled and dragged his hand over his jaw. “Young, rough hands. Nice shoulders, chest. Thick dark hair and light brown eyes.”
“Come on,” John urged. “Just a look.”
“Mrs H,” he said with a nod.
“I do enjoy a disguise, I’ll admit. But I need you to create a diversion while I liberate some medical records.”
Sherlock’s eyes were glued to his laptop screen and his tone was distracted. “No. . .not really. . .”
“What’s that in real time?”
Obviously, having sex with Sherlock in order to connect with him was not going to be the way forward now they were living apart and moving on with their lives. But there was something to this idea of discovering new ways to interpret those happier, well-connected times, that could serve them.
“Can you write?”
They had barely set their suitcases down beside the inviting, white-sheeted bed before they were stripping off, sliding into swimsuits they’d had the foresight to put in the front pocket of John’s carry-on, sprinting down the length of their private cove into the crystal blue, Caribbean sea. Sherlock looked back at the teak-and-glass pavilion, tall sliding doors between the sun deck and the ocean-view bed purposely left wide open. Native plants flourished and bowed to shelter three sides of the little building, gifting shade and heady floral aromas riding the gentle ocean breeze as it teased at the sheer white draperies. Behind a lattice wall stood a deep, wide bathtub Sherlock resolved he and John would make excellent use of, at least once.
“It’s under control,” he insisted. “I smothered it.”
“Show me,” he muttered, and John obliged, adjusting his phone to give Sherlock a view of most of his torso, and of his hand working quick and tight around his big cock. Sherlock cursed and rolled his slippery palm over his crown before stroking downward.
“Bernard Comfort.”
“She doesn’t have to know,” John parried, keeping his voice even and mild. “Not at first, anyway. Maybe we can—”
Sherlock let out a frustrated, needy noise, and John hushed, “Quiet now, they’ll hear.” He slowed and lightened, letting their breath settle. They stared into each other’s eyes, telling each other the story, playing the parts. Sherlock’s gut fluttered and he gulped.
John nodded, with an amused if skeptical smile-frown. “M-hm.”
Sherlock was still adjusting to visiting his young friend only once a month, instead of the weekly visits he’d enjoyed for the previous few years. Jeremy’s parents had at last risen to the top of a waiting list for a particular private school’s day program, one they’d been trying to get Jeremy placed in for the best part of three years. His mother Beth had done a commendable job assembling educational, therapeutic, and social supports for him in the meantime, but even Sherlock—an outer-circle friend of the family—had known it was a source of enormous stress for both parents. Once Beth had shared the news, during one of his Tuesday morning visits in late July, Sherlock made sure to call the school and arrange to assume responsibility for the finances—anonymously, of course. The embraces he got from the Porters the following week told him they suspected he was their benefactor, but it wasn’t discussed, which suited Sherlock just fine.
Sherlock squared himself, took a step toward the agent, still on the other side of the room, now swiping his phone rather than talking into it. “Wonder if you’re free to show us a few more later this week? Say, Friday?”
“Thank you. Safe travels.”
Mike: It’s hockey, though. It’s a macho culture. It might be even tougher for players to be out in the workplace, when the workplace—the team—is so masculine-centric, as opposed to in some office where the dynamics are more person-to-person, office politics, and so on. Not that LGBT issues don’t come up, of course, but the overt hyper-male stuff in a sports team has to create a different atmosphere.
“Thanks. You don’t have to.”
A car was summoned, and arrived mercifully soon—thankfully not driven by one of Mrs Holmes’s pensioner friends supplementing her post-retirement income—and John went on being charming and jovial, ingratiating himself even to Sherlock’s father, who deigned to walk with them as far as the foyer. In the end, though, Sherlock’s mother stood alone on the front step, waving them goodbye.
“Are you feeling all right?” was John’s reply. Sherlock mugged insult at the implication he was perhaps sometimes less than discreet.
“I’d love to have dirtied up your little bed,” he whispered, voice dry and harsh beside Sherlock’s ear. “Wanting to suck you, fuck you, eat your pretty arse, but only this. Just this.”
Steven guided Sherlock’s free hand up to the bookshelf—
Sherlock was in fact deeply unhappy, dressed every night but with his mask on a table behind him and his arse on a stool, instead of in goal where he belonged. No need to shower after games; he undressed and disappeared as quick as he could, avoiding conversation in the room other than the expected attaboys for his teammates after a win. Once he’d skated out to give LoPresti the requisite pat on the helmet and a quick word or two of praise—“good game” said as little or as much as Sherlock wished to say without raising suspicion of sour grapes—he didn’t look at him again.
“Fine, then,” Sherlock allowed. “I thought we’d perhaps start out making a list.”
—which is well-reviewed as both hilarious and heart-warming. Bonus datum in favour: sweets and popcorn for lunch.” He squared himself to Rosie, her boot-clad feet hanging well above the rug and her head resting well below the back edge of the chair, and clasped his hands at his chin.  He narrowed his eyes. “Which will it be?”
“I didn’t,” John protested, recognising the joke in Sherlock’s praise of him.
Seated on the rolling leather desk chair, bent deeply forward, John went on teasing Sherlock’s cock to life with open-mouthed kisses, even as he tucked his fingers into Sherlock’s waistband and began urging down his trousers, humming encouragement when he had breath and space for it. Sherlock gathered John’s t-shirt by handfuls at his back and pulled it up, up, finally over and off when John pulled away to get his breath.
“It still is,” Sherlock said, and turned his hand palm up on John’s thigh so they were clasping hands, fingers slotting together. He realised he was perspiring. “My one easy thing. And the most important.”
They came up smiling, and Sherlock groped at the front of John’s shorts.
Sherlock strode to the next corner, keeping one eye on the second car as he scanned the road for a taxi. He waved and ducked inside, showed an impressive amount of cash in the rearview and told the driver to follow the blue Mercedes, not too close.
John. Frowning with his entire being. His shoulders and spine and even his knees were in on it, and his clenched fist was so far in on it Sherlock sidestepped, just in case.
“Yeah.”
Sherlock felt a twinge of the only type of jealousy he was capable of: envious of anyone who got to spend time with John when he could not. He was equally jealous of John’s colleagues from the foundation and the three hundred children who’d had the chance to deafen him while Sherlock was taking practice shots from his teammates.  He inched his plate away from himself and sat back, reaching to his inside jacket pocket to fetch out his money clip.
Then he nods.
John’s jaw is set tightly. He’s gritting his teeth so hard it hurts. He wants to be mad. About the overdose and the risk and the sheer stupidity of it all. But he can’t. Not now. Not listening to this. All this time he’d thought that Sherlock had just been… out. They’d known his brain was buzzing with activity, of course, but this… this is beyond even his worst nightmares. Just picturing Sherlock in that situation is unbearable. A living nightmare that you can't escape and you can't understand. John has had far too many nightmares like that to not feel his heart break at the mere idea of Sherlock being perpetually stuck in such a place.
“That’s what you’re asking me to do.”
Moriarty reaches for his jacket and a bucket of ice water is turned upside down above Sherlock’s head.
exuding from the man as he tries to get John to understand the basics of proteinogenic amino acid combinations in peptide chains is enough to make John forget all about the various trivialities and problems on his mind. Because it might be four o’clock in the afternoon after a long, uninspiring day at work and a twenty minute walk in the rain, but
But honestly, what does it matter? It’s good in the here and now and John does his best to
The moment that thought crosses Sherlock's mind, Moriarty leans forward, hand stretched out in front of him. For a shocked moment, Sherlock is almost certain he’s about to place a hand on his cheek.
Which is admittedly a likely scenario all things considered.
A bit of a shorter chapter than usual, but a very difficult one to write. I didn't want to include any additional scenes, I just wanted this chapter to be this one moment, which is why it's so much shorter than the other chapters. While I try to keep my chapters around 4000 words each, I think it's important to let the story decide rather than just trying to reach some arbitrary number. I hope that's alright.
But now that he’s here, that’s not how he feels. The thoughts in his head are not ready to let go of him and he’s not ready to let go of them. Perhaps that’s what you get for postponing important conversations until it’s too late. Regret. Two long years of it.
He clenches his fists and soldiers on.
Sherlock tries not to mind it too much. He tries to tell himself that Jim is not here to make him feel loved or appreciated. Jim is here to understand him and to help him understand himself. Help him become a better version of himself. Sherlock shuts down his desire as best he can and shrugs as much as he’s able to, bend backwards as he is. “They probably didn’t see it coming. Never do, ordinary people.”
But then Sherlock opens his mouth, closes it again, swallows and narrows his eyes. And John remembers where he’s seen this expression before. The day he had asked Sherlock to be his best man and Sherlock had gone near-catatonic for several minutes. When he’d finally begun to talk again, it had taken John an embarrassing amount of prodding to get out of him that it was the casual reference to Sherlock being his best friend that had caused the disturbance. That Sherlock hadn’t known, hadn’t even hoped…
“You mean to tell me that a Business student staying in London for an extended period of time would not get a British debit card?”
John has a little alcohol in the blood from the punch they’ve just consumed together with Mrs. H, but he’s had nowhere near the amount necessary for it to have any effect on him. He briefly congratulates himself on that account. Liquid courage is a tried and true though not particularly responsible preparatory measure for John whenever he wants to
They sit like that for a while. No word passes between them for the better part of five minutes, but there’s a sense of comfort and companionship so strong that no words are needed and few would have seemed appropriate.
John sighs softly. “Back to bed?”
Well… one person
It’s not because John is nostalgic about the Christmases of his childhood. They weren’t particularly Christmassy. On the contrary, his childhood Christmases were always rushed, cheap, depressing affairs, marked by arguments, awkward silences and one too many drinks to cope with it. Anything to avoid a repetition of those hellscapes.
Perhaps she isn’t the only one who has to rein in her emotions.
Holding Sherlock like this, feeling Sherlock’s arms around him, feeling his lips against his own… it’s like feeling the sun on both sides.
Nor is John a failure. He’s an accomplished doctor, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, a battle-tested army doctor, a tried and true detective in his own right (although Sherlock isn’t certain he’s ever actually told him so) and above all someone who’s managed to not only put up with Sherlock to a degree where everyone else, including Sherlock’s own family, have failed, but also to provide Sherlock with everything he never even could have imagined he needed from another person.
He takes a deep breath.
But then again... this is not just any surveillance visit. Sherlock is not alone up there. He’s with Jim Moriarty, as he has been for the past several days. He invited Moriarty there himself. He’s locked himself up with his worst enemy. How Sherlock could have decided to do so mad a thing… Mycroft may know his brother almost better than Sherlock knows himself, but he’s never been particularly good at understanding his brother’s behaviour when Sherlock is not using his brain to make the decisions and this is one such time. Mycroft can understand his brother as far as the temptation for an increased intellect goes. What Moriarty is telling him to do – enhance his faculties of deduction by eradicating the brunt of those pesky
Something at the core of John’s being aches at the thought of leaving 221B. It’s like coming home. This slightly run-down, quite probably drug-infested and permanently messy flat somehow feels more like home than the new house in the suburbs that he and Mary have lived in for over a year now. And Sherlock feels like coming home too, however abstract and improbable that sounds.
him. And could have had him still if he hadn’t been so unforgivably
John has no idea how to begin.
Mycroft lingers for about three seconds to hear if Sherlock has anything more to say. Then he turns and leaves the building the same way that he entered, leaving Sherlock sitting in his chair with Moriarty still wrapped around him.
Rosie’s face lights up in a bright smile of what she thinks is understanding.
let go? As if this is something to be hidden away, swept under the rug and forgotten about as much as possible? As if it can be unseen? As if they can just pretend that John hasn’t seen the thirty-odd pale lines meandering their way across the expanse of Sherlock’s back?
“What about him?”
he’ll wake up, not able to help him in any way.
When John is here, things aren’t good. But at least they’re better, so much better, than when Sherlock is here alone, trapped with nothing but his own thoughts for company. John makes things better. He takes Sherlock out of his own head, forces him to engage, forces him to participate in whatever small capacity Sherlock is capable of. He may not understand Sherlock the way Jim did, but he doesn’t judge him the way other people do either, at least not for now.
It has taken John two years to do this, to go back to the cemetery, to make the decision to move on. He doubts if he should have done it if not for Mary. She deserves better than what he has given her so far. She deserves better than being relegated to the side-lines on a constant basis, taking turns being cane, therapist and friend. Mary has listened to everything he has needed to say during the last months, but never once has she talked to him about her own past. She says she prefers it that way, but it just makes John feel the more guilty for taking advantage of her listening ear without being able to offer her his in return. She deserves better and he’s determined to give her that. Moving on from Sherlock seems to be the only way, so that’s what he’s going to do. Or try to do at the very least.
What does Sherlock like? Something personal, something not a lot of people would know about him. Something he would be able to appreciate not just for what it is, but for the thought put into it. John tries to cast his mind back, to remember if Sherlock has expressed a particular liking for anything recently. A Mind Palace would have come in real handy at times like this.
only the night before and thought about his feelings and come to the conclusion that he’s in love with two people and one of them is a man even though John has never been like that and he’d had so many thoughts and feelings rummaging around his head that it had all seemed insurmountable and staying with Sherlock rather than going home to Mary had felt like a symbolic choice and a far too final decision for him to make then and there and so he’d left and now Sherlock is not awake, might not wake again, and it’s all such a huge fucking mess.
The hours pass. People come and go. Molly and Lestrade are the first. Sherlock’s parents arrive late in the evening. Mary offers her condolences. John hears himself think that he ought to do the same and then wilfully ignores it. Sherlock would say that there isn’t space on his hard drive for niceties.
A muscle twitches in John’s cheek. He’s gritting his teeth, almost painfully so.
“So what do you think? Does it feel good to be Sherlock Holmes again?”
It doesn’t matter that Sherlock has goals of his own. It doesn’t matter that there are things he wants to achieve by this. Things he has wanted to achieve for what feels like his entire life, but is probably only for as long as he can remember. It doesn’t matter that all of that is within his reach right here, right now. It doesn’t matter that he put more work into reaching this point than he’s ever put into a case before. It doesn’t matter how much he has given up in the process. The path behind him is littered with the pieces of himself that he’s let go of along the way.
It’s not so much that Sherlock has relapsed. John is disappointed, naturally, but he’s witnessed some of these episodes before, albeit none as severe as this one looks to be. He’s seen Sherlock in mostly every state of sobriety or lack thereof. And he could never blame Sherlock for occasionally showing a touch of weakness behind that poised exterior. This is a part of who Sherlock is, even if it is John’s least favourite part by far.
John looks at him questioningly, causing a slight frown to appear between his brows. There’s that twitch of his mouth to show that he’s listening.
They settle down, Sherlock obstinately seated on the floor, but John and Mary sit down beside each other on the couch. Maybe Mary notices something hanging in the air, something loaded and heavy-feeling in the silence between them, because she glances at John as if to ask him to confirm that everything is indeed alright.
Then there’s his body. John has always thought that he was attracted to soft curves and voluptuous shapes. He’s always preferred shapely women. He's never minded women with a little extra padding in certain places. Sherlock is the very antithesis. He’s skinny, strong but not overly muscular, his chest is flat, and his hips are bony. But perhaps John has been mistaken all along when it comes to his own preferences. Because looking at Sherlock’s naked body is like looking at a marble statue. It’s a work of art, and yet it’s perhaps that little bit too close to physical perfection for John to fully ignore that what he’s faced with is a naked body.
Sherlock feels a short stab at that. But he doesn’t know how to reply. How to explain. He isn’t even sure he knows the answer himself. But he isn’t about to let John brush his concern off so easily, not now when it’s finally here and likely to stay. Not when he actually is concerned, slightly despite himself perhaps, but unmistakably so.
Maybe John can ask Mycroft for advice on a book that would live up to Sherlock’s standards. But that would lack the personal touch, wouldn’t it? Sherlock wouldn’t need to know that John had gone to Mycroft for help, of course, but the point still stands. At least John can’t let that be his only present for Sherlock this year, that’s for certain. He’ll have to figure something out to go along with a book, something a bit more personal.
Then he sees them.
“Is that something you know?”
“Also love him,” Mary finishes for him.
They’ve been silent for at least half an hour when Jim speaks.
Sherlock has fought against this side of himself his entire life, more out of a morbid, instinctive fear than any concrete knowledge of what it might unleash. Now he’s tired. It feels pointless to fight against what would undoubtedly be a relief at this point. A release from the pain of having too many feelings and nowhere to go with them.
cheeks are equally coloured.
“We’re playing the game,” he elaborates. Moriarty leans closer to him. He looks more than tolerably pleased. Whether it’s with himself or with Sherlock is difficult to tell. But he remains silent.
Mary nods.
So when at last Sherlock speaks again and all he has to say is “No, I don’t think so,” in a tone clearly meant to indicate that this conversation is at an end… well, then John lets him make that decision and goes out in the kitchen to make himself another strong cup of tea.
He doesn’t say much during their visit. After he initially expresses surprise at their presence only to be shut down in true Holmesian fashion, the only other thing he feels comfortable saying is to ask whether he should leave the room so Sherlock’s parents can be alone with their son. But Sherlock is adamant that he stay. So after checking with his parents, who seem surprisingly tolerant of John’s presence, John hooks the leg of his trusty plastic chair with one foot and sits down to watch as Sherlock’s mother fusses about the bags underneath Sherlock’s eyes and the appalling information available from the so-called information desk downstairs and Sherlock’s father smiles and shakes his head good-naturedly. Which is how John ends up the recipient of Sherlock’s silent pleas for help from the ten-minute mark onwards to the bitter end of the hour.
“I can’t explain what it is. It’s not explainable. But there’s something familiar about looking at him.”
Then John had stumbled into his life.
John leans forward, deliberately and in full control, pulls Sherlock gently towards him and kisses him again. Closes his eyes and loses himself completely in the moment. Forgets everything else.
It’s as if Sherlock already knows. The way he’s sitting there by the fire, staring into the flames. He has such an unreadable expression. As though he’s looking at things far beyond the scope of what everyone else can see.
“Jesus, Sherlock…” John pinches the bridge of his nose, clenches his teeth and tries
This is all the danger and anxiety and sleepless nights and desire for one too many drunken evenings and a constant soreness due to sitting in the same position for far too many hours at a time and a million other troubles and inconveniences. But the excitement and fun is nowhere to be found. There’s nothing to alleviate the pressure in John’s chest nor ease the worries gnawing away at him.
“You’re thinking about what it will be like not to be playing,” Sherlock said knowingly.
“Well, you mentioned wanting something better than the eighteen.”
“No, I rented a flat. So we can cook. Pretend we’re on holiday.”
“Out on a case?” John asked, only for something to say.
Mike: So that’s the word you prefer, boyfriends?
John would by then have ordered a top shelf whisky, and food to be brought out later, only after he was certain Sherlock had settled in. They’d talked the situation up one side and down the other, both of them were as sure as could be that Sherlock would get seamlessly back to work. But Sherlock knew John well enough by now to know he would have to see it to truly believe it.
“Hey,” John said softly, so many creases in his brow as he looked up, searching Sherlock’s face. It was inquiry, greeting, and comforting noise in equal measures. Sherlock took the easy way out.
“Thank you. I will always defer to you, not for reasons of biology, or of hierarchy, but because that is the way you need things to be. I understand that about you. And it does no harm to anyone—does Watson no harm, surely—so I am happy to acquiesce. What I am trying to do, in what I now recognise was the clumsiest of ways, is signal my commitment to her, for a lifetime.”
“Where are you staying?” Mr Holmes asked, nose wrinkling behind the wire nose-bridge of his spectacles.
“Good?” Sherlock smirked, though not unkindly.
“See, look at you. Giving yourself away,” John accused.
John turned and stepped across to draw Sherlock into his arms, leaning back to see him, with hands clasped behind Sherlock’s waist.
“She was yawning the whole time I was reading, though, so I don’t think it’ll be more than ten minutes before I can sneak in for it and be out of your hair.”
“It’s flu,” John said flatly, rubbing Rosie’s wrists in each of his hands as he’d at last let her recline down again, sniffling. “You saw the letter from the school that the kids have been dropping like rain with it the past few weeks.”
He allowed himself to be hugged, again and again. He stroked the chubby hands of the wriggly babies. Took time to indulge curious examinations of the buttons on his coat. Told each child he knew how good they were, how hard they tried. Told them to take care of whichever parent or siblings were nearby. Accepted kisses on the cheek. Felt warmth radiating off them, not just their bodies fevered with holiday excitement and too many sweets, but their joy at seeing him--Santa, of course, but he was in there, as well--and the unguarded way they spoke.
Sherlock shrugged and ducked, demanding, “Aren’t you finished yet?”
an anything.”
“Untrue.”
“Sex.”
More kisses, in that case, and hands stroking each other’s bodies in the dark. The length of his arm. His wrist and hand and fingers. The familiar fuzz on his chest and the firm muscle of his thigh. Mouth open against his throat, tongue tracing the edge of his ear, nosing into the corner of his jaw.
“Aw’right, Holmes, let’s work top shelf a little. Stick side high is biting you in the ass lately.”
“Those things put me at risk, not her. Never her,” Sherlock defended.
Mornings he woke early for sex with John when at home or, on the road, to work out. Thurston showed up at practice arenas before the team’s morning skate to fire away at Sherlock, never complained that he had to rise too early or that he was too hungover. Sherlock thanked him at the end of every session, and Thurston always gave the same reply, “No problem, what are friends for, asshole?” It occurred to Sherlock that until fairly recently he hadn’t really known.
“What are you, like, one of those—”
“Hey, dude,” came Kim’s voice. “What’s up, it’s Saturday morning and I’m asleep.”
“All right?” John asked him, knowing the answer, grinning against Sherlock’s jaw and cheek between scattered kisses.
“Be my guest.” George detoured through the kitchenette to grab a mug, crossed the sitting room to the round wood table by the window. Sherlock turned the handle of the coffee carafe toward him. “Early practice I don’t know about?” Sherlock prompted, knowing perfectly well there was no such thing.
Naturally, Boxing Day was their Christmas--the staff and stablemen, driver, cook--when none must work more than pleased them. The maids and footmen left their shoes unfastened and played guessing games, sang or recited, tried to catch each other under the sprig of mistletoe. The cook chomped a cigar end and leaned heavily on one chair-arm, watched some of the younger women moving about her kitchen, laughed at their ineptitude but happily ate every bite she was served. There were holly branches hung near the fireplace, and a wreath of cedar on both sides of the door. Candles everywhere. The kitchen was full of the noise of cracking walnuts--their shells carelessly left on the tabletop or underfoot--and the snap of paper crackers from which fell paper crowns and terrible puns and peppermint candies.
Sherlock stretched luxuriantly, limbs lengthening and back arching high up off the mattress. “What next?” he yawned.
“Nope.”
John had found a Michelin-starred French/Italian fusion restaurant in Chicago with an internationally admired wine list, somehow without consulting Sherlock, who could have told him about it before he’d even gotten out the entire question of where they should dine in honour of Sherlock’s birthday.
“Hey,” John said, a sudden realization apparent in it. “Your old room?”
Rosie shuddered dramatically and let out one of her excited half-squeals. Sherlock reminded her not to rush to judgment by holding up one finger.
“While I’m stuck home alone,” Sherlock complained, and pushed out his bottom lip.
Sherlock obeyed, lifting himself to sit and making himself available for John’s mostly-chaste but lingering kiss.
I plan to keep him until the day I die. Then I’ll lie here beside you, Mother, with John on my other side. I don’t think you’ll mind.
“Well, so, I’ll get out of your way. Enjoy the weekend.”
Well, what the hell did that mean? John read it again, then a third time. Nothing terribly personal, though the note itself was more personal than the generic holiday card. Shortly, John decided it was not a case of mixed signals, the signals were all quite clear: Married to his work, but you can help if you like. Also, Happy New Year.
Clearing his throat hard, John crossed his arms over his chest and took a half-step sideways. He made his own show of looking for Rosie among her playmates, half-faked a smile at her antics.
Sherlock sipped at the wine, let it release its mild effervescence against his palate before swallowing. “It’s only the appealing fantasy of a neverending holiday. A week in a beautiful place you don’t have to clean or maintain, uncluttered by your lifetime’s collection of junk, at last feeling relaxed and treating yourself to experiences you wouldn’t normally have, food you wouldn’t normally eat. You trick yourself into thinking it would always be like that. Or that it could.”
John, recently showered, damp-dry and wrapped at the hips in a white towel, paced the room’s angles from marble threshold to cherrywood wardrobe to mahogany footboard. Sherlock lifted his gaze from the tablet’s screen to watch him, half-believed John made redundant trips with the excuse of not knowing his way around Sherlock’s London flat strictly to accommodate his watching. Purposeful or not, Sherlock would take the win.
The rapid-fire patter was delivered as she shrugged out of her warm jacket and handed it to him, then steadied herself on his shoulder to step out of her boots, their soles just wetted from damp pavement; the rain had stopped. Sherlock regained his feet and moved to hang her coat on the hall tree, lining up her boots on the floor between two pairs of his shoes.
“Shall I let you go?”
“We just did.”
“Suit yourself,” Sherlock told him.
“The rapier on the bedroom wall,” John put in.
“So then, there we are,” John said, with something like finality. “I’m never going to feel good about you risking your life, getting hurt. One of these times it won’t just be your ankle and your wrist.”
JW: That was gratifying, yeah. And it was the right thing to do. I wouldn’t have expected less.
“Are you any good at shopping?” he asked.
Hovering above him, frustratingly distant on elbow and knees, John shoved a curved palm between Sherlock’s legs and dragged back and forth over his trousers, feeling for the shape of him, radiating an urgent need for response. Sherlock kissed harder, grabbed for his shoulder, the small of his back, pulling him down. John pressed his chest to Sherlock’s and kissed his jaw, nudging up his chin. He made a low, raw growling sound and scraped his teeth down the side of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock hooked a calf into the bend of John’s knee.
,” he read. “Wanted to speak to me about it, ‘but’? But thought it would be easier to sneak it through the courts behind my back?”
At last John was cornered into introducing Sherlock to his writing coach and editor, Iain Westcott, the professor with enough time on his hands to attend John’s talks on weekdays. Apparently. They ran into John’s poet in the middle of Boston Common—Sherlock and John on their way back to the flat from a movie theatre on the edge of Chinatown, Iain walking to one of the classes he taught at Emerson College, also on the edge of Chinatown. John hugged him, which Sherlock found unusually demonstrative, and Iain offered Sherlock a handshake and told him he’d heard so much about him from John.
Sherlock said faux-confidentially, “He thinks I give you too much.”
“I can think of one,” Sherlock grinned.
“A day in bed with you is one of the best things I can think of, and I am in no way complaining,” John told him, “But tomorrow we’re going to find something to do. Out there in the world. Something new and interesting and that we won’t soon forget.”
John’s eyes went comically wide and he leaned forward to emphasize, “So did I! As it turns out, it was a kiddie circus. I mean, sure, kids make a lot of noise when they’re amped up but I swear to you, Sherlock, it started at like eight and a half, almost immediately went to ten, and it never let up for a single second.”
John appeared, with a particular spark in his gaze Sherlock recognised immediately, and leaned up to intone, “We’re going.”
“Not to do with your illegible printing, then.”
John frowned, looked like he wanted to say the correct one of at least three different things. Sherlock knew he would get it wrong, so put him out of his misery before he spoke again.
“Very good, Watson. Good morning, children.”
Mother, he adores me.
Sherlock had been smoking out the windows of his flat whenever John was in the bathroom, or asleep, then rinsing the smoke from his mouth with cabernet. Apparently not thoroughly enough.
“No. Nothing.” An obvious lie. A hard, frustrated sigh. “Nevermind it. I’ll pour us a drink?”
“I’ll wear it to church tonight,” John said. “The infants’ play, then the carols.”
“Yes, well.” John cleared his throat and they shared a stare. John looked regretful; Sherlock dared him. “I’m going up for my phone, then I’ll go.”
It was already close to noon on Saturday when Sherlock finally got a text from Coach Lestrade confirming his suspicions. Nothing more to it than
“You’re not jealous,” John chided.
“Says the man with two weeks of media interviews on his calendar the moment we leave here,” Sherlock reminded. “Sounds like work to me.”
Sherlock considered it as quickly as he could. John was the one man in the world who was one-hundred percent on Sherlock’s side, but the fact was Sherlock’s on-ice struggles embarrassed him. He didn’t want John to see him at less than his best. John looked at him then, and Sherlock found he couldn’t say no.
Sherlock played at having to weigh up his decision, casting a faux-dismayed glance at the sink full of dirty dishes. “But there’s this mess,” he protested, already taking a step toward the bedroom despite it.
Sherlock forced a half-smile. “Perfect.”
D’yever tellya the time a’got intune argument witha soldier’s angry at me cos he’s
“She ate something. From a box. Pretzels or crisps—with taboule salad—and drank water. Watched something on the tablet. Animations.”
Sherlock let his head tilt, supporting his chin with his thumb, two fingers pressing hard against his temple.
“Thank god for it.”
“Not the mum that had you,” Rosie agreed. “But she’s the mum of you both, and the granny of me.”
Hello, Mother. I’ve brought you these. They’re from the hothouse, of course; we’d never have roses in December otherwise. I think you liked these, with the blush of pink at the heart. Quite a bit cheerier than these bare branches hanging over you--there--break these off--set them here, I’ll take them when I go.
“I’ll write it later, on the real paper.”
“LoPresti has five wins in five starts this season; his stats look better.”
“Fast as I can. I’ve a game to win between now and then.”
“Thanks, yeah. Thanks.” George had nearly reached the door to his bedroom when Sherlock spoke once more.
John laughed. His glass was empty so he set it on the kitchen table. They were stood there rather awkwardly, with table between them. John looked at the steamed pudding with just a slice or two missing.
“I’ll open a bottle?” Sherlock wondered, snugging himself up against John’s side, mashing piles of pillows until they were comfortably nested together.
“You know I haven’t.”
John pressed the buzzer while Rosie stretched up on her toes, extending her arm over her head, trying to reach the knocker.
Thurston arrived at the log house clean-shaven, his skin tanned from a summer outdoors, with a fading bruise under his eye resultant from a left hook during a sparring match at the boxing gym he owned. Kim’s cheeks were plumper than Sherlock remembered, and she laughed loudly and much, which Sherlock could see pleased her brother, who ran a constant low-grade fever of concern about her. Whenever she told a story, Thurston looked smilingly at her as if she had hung the moon. He drew out her chair at the dining table, held doors for her, asked her if she needed anything. Based on all facts in evidence, Sherlock thought it a good match.
The location featured was tropical, white sand and turquoise sea. Individual cabanas fitted out like high-end hotel suites, open to the breeze, huge white-linen-covered beds facing the sea. Not another soul in sight, though no doubt it would be easy to summon one to fulfill any need that should arise—more champagne, late breakfast, extra towels, a third or fourth for an erotic afternoon romp accompanied by the crash of waves on the tiny, private beach.
“You do spoil me, John.”
“I’ll grope you in the taxi on the way to meet the estate agent.”
Sudden, heavy motion beside him and a blur of blue and beige in his peripheral vision told him John was sitting up, moving aside. Going away. More peripheral motion, of John picking up the tumbled bedding they’d abandoned on the bed’s foot and now on the floor.
Mike: Your lips to the hockey gods’ ears.
John checked his wristwatch once he’d set the last plate in the rack to dry, and Sherlock felt a twinge of disappointment, feeling certain the next thing to happen would be John gathering Rosie’s things and hustling her out the door. To Sherlock’s surprise, John leaned up against the lounge door and said, “I packed her a few days’ worth of clothes and things. Thought you might like to spend the weekend, now you’re up and about.”
“I’d pay good money to see you weeping,” Sherlock told him.
“Watson will be sorry to have missed you,” Sherlock said, half-over his shoulder as they climbed the stairs to the flat. John reckoned he would never be used to ringing the bell, waiting on the stone step for someone to open the door.
Sherlock became aware of restless noises from the back of the house—inside the cramped study off the kitchen—his father huffing impatiently and shuffling papers, scraping the chair’s feet against the lino.
“New twist on the Nigerian romance scam. Some government tech experts are interfering, gathering data. . .A waste of my own superior brain to take all the details on board. Boring, boring. But, as you say, lucrative.”
“Just keep talking long enough that he doesn’t feel I’ve wasted his time; I suspect he’s holding out for me to raise my budget before he comes across with the good stuff. I’m willing to go another quarter million but he doesn’t need to know that yet. I know he’s the listing agent on that shuttered bank we passed; imagine an oak bar inside the vault.”
“I’m going to miss it.”
. But I have really fucked-up knees, and I like to party, so.”
“Some of us older than others,” Sherlock joked automatically, the mildest jibe in it, another old habit.
“Not at all, Mr Watson, I’m happy to. I’ll also have a bottle of champagne sent up. Would you like a brunch basket as well?”
for you, darling—instead of going on living together and always arguing, too often feeling grouchy and sad. After the expected questions (
,” Sherlock murmured. “What’s his name?”
“I know you do. That’s the thing, I know perfectly well how you need it.” He smirked. “Seen enough of you without work to know how that plays out.”
“Yeah.”
“Watson, are you going to finish this?”
“Nope!”
Alone together at last--not
Sherlock harrumphed at the implication he’d been so unforgivably naughty John was unwilling to subject Iain to more time in his company.
Skating toward the three men tossing pucks back and forth at the top of the circles, giving Sherlock privacy while he was being coached, Raynham called out, “Fire at will, guys. Five minutes, and I’ll let you go.”
“Was the front door not locked?” John asked, annoyed that Sherlock may have made Mrs Hudson vulnerable by leaving the heavy front door open for anyone to walk through.
Jordan’s eyebrows rose a bit, and Sherlock clarified, “Resort staff. You must have a regular spot for after-work drinks and so on.”
“It’s been a very long time since I’ve had any loved ones to whom I might give a present,” Sherlock said, an explanation rather than an ending to his original statement.
Steven closed in on him, and just the way he stepped so boldly into Sherlock’s space was disarming, made it clear he was not the sort of successful, powerful man who wished to slide into submission behind every closed door. He was master of his domain, no doubt, and Sherlock felt himself being claimed. Steven reached between them and unfastened the button on Sherlock’s suit jacket. His eyes were green, and stared. Sherlock’s mouth crooked up at one corner and he let himself be manhandled, his jacket slid from his shoulders and tossed onto a nearby chair, his sides and chest and the back of his shoulders evaluated by sliding palms and dragging fingers. Steven leaned in as if to kiss him and Sherlock lifted his chin to offer his throat instead; amenable to the redirection, Steven licked a narrow stripe up the side of his throat, tongued the lobe of his ear.
“I was talking to Iain about it on the way back.”
“The apology? Or the drink?”
John burped a laugh. An eighteen year old Macallan whisky must run close to two hundred quid. “Yeah, I’d say that could be OK. If you don’t have anything better.” He smiled at his own joke and decided to take a seat in the threadbare red armchair across from Sherlock’s preferred seat. He admired the decor, and his eye was caught by what was on the television, a local news moment interviewing people-on-the-street about where they were last Christmas, and where they planned to be for this one.
“In that case, let’s go. If anyone gets in our way, we’ll just walk over them.”
“I won’t keep you.” John gave what he thought was a friendly--perhaps even professionally distant--nod, and carried on his way.
A shake of John’s head, a rueful smile. “Yes.”
“Bit early for the tree, isn’t it?” John asked absently, rearranging himself to stretch his legs—careful not to bump any of the toys—and cross his ankles. Good thing he’d taken up yoga those years back to calm his often stormy mind or he might never get up again.
“No doubt,” Sully affirmed. “Put in two, smash the OT, we’re back here listening to tunes and eating pizza. No worries; we got this.”
Repeatedly, Sherlock’s inner voice wanted to remind him in alarmed tones that this was not where they were meant to be, that John was not his partner nor even his doctor anymore. He hushed it and concentrated on the sensation of his headache draining away from beneath the skin of his face. He exhaled long and loud. After another breath, he put his arms around John’s back.
“Everything is fine, but they do need you here to sign some papers.”
John stood dumbly for another moment and finally cleared his throat and ventured, “What do you do when you’re not on a case? Not working. For fun.”
“So you
directed at his phone’s screen.
Sherlock nodded, with a grim half-smile. “You should come visit,” he said.
John couldn’t help but smirk. “I think it means you’re never the same person you were, so even if you try to relive parts of your life, you can’t, because they don’t fit you anymore. Those experiences would never feel the same.”
Sherlock waved the hand in question, dismissing all of it as nonsense. “And his was so filthy it—” John caught his hand and held it, mostly by the wrist, not carefully.
“Stop! I’ll go from here.”
Sherlock held the back of one hand in the palm of the other, in front of his waist. He longed to match John shout for shout, but controlled his voice. “Of course, I inquired about it. Called the solicitor. But I only wanted to be sure—”
Sherlock hummed. “Come along, then. I need a second pair of eyes and Mrs Hudson has her book club. I don’t know why mature women feel they must pretend they are sharing a common reading experience when their actual aim is to drink wine and share gossip, but I’m told it’s none of my business.”
“I’ll get it,” John volunteered.
“No, I do.”
“My dad was one of those hockey dads,” he said, as he finished up, “You know the type. He sacrificed a lot for me to keep playing, keep finding challenges, keep improving. He gave up his own dreams to play pro hockey, in order to support our family. He moved our family across an ocean to give me opportunities. My mother packed my lunches, kept my schedule, and made sure I kept up my grades in school—just in case.” There came a laugh, then, acknowledging that not every dreamer gets to the major league. “I’m told they’d have been proud of me, and I like to think that’s true.” He paused for applause in honour of his late parents. “What I know is true that there are two people I want to thank, above all. The first is my sister, Kim Watson, who has been beside me since the day she was born.” He turned toward her and his voice went thick as he told her, “I’m lucky to have you as my best friend.”
Sherlock waved it away. They fell quiet, each to his own worries and up-too-late thoughts, and enjoyed the wine and the quiet, ears out for any whimper or cry from the room upstairs. After a few minutes, John drained the last of his glass and stretched a bit, stifling a yawn.
“Shut off the lights at least!” George called after him, as Sherlock slammed the door behind him. He went straight to his own room, through to the bath, and ran the hot tap to wash his hands. His urge to lick and sniff was rampant and disgusting. Dropping the torn-apart paper wrapper from the small bar of soap into the sink, he scrubbed and scrubbed, even digging in the tips of his fingernails and scraping them full. By the time he was done, his hands were bright red and stinging.
“That’s one word for it,” John allowed.
A soft knock on the open door as he stepped closer, cleared his throat, “Uh, hi, Sherlock? I wonder if you’ve got a--Wow.”
Sherlock thought this over, then made a noise of affirmation. John’s fingers in his hair sent tendrils of tingles across his scalp, threatening to lull him back to sleep. “How many days did you work before?” he asked softly, and John laughed, probably thinking it was half-asleep gibberish.
SH: You’re right, of course. There is a certain air in the dressing room—
“You want to?”
a 221B ficlet
“Good, then. All right.”
John frown-smiled and shook his head. “Hm, nah, I should—” he tipped his head.
“I couldn’t have saved MacHugh’s goal on the power play.”
“So. You can imagine; I’m sure you know where this is going,” John said, holding up his hands in surrender. He kept his voice low, even though Rosie was two rooms away behind a closed door. “Mum’s nodding out next to the exam table as it becomes obvious someone—no doubt her boyfriend, it’s always Mum’s boyfriend—has sexually assaulted the boy. So began the cascade of phone calls and dealing with Services people and signing statements and certifying findings and all.” John waved his hand in the air. “The whole mess.”
Within the hour, they’d brought a bottle of wine and the last of the good cheese, along with some cashews and pick-your-own strawberries from the kitchen. John had got a fire going in the bowl-shaped fireplace centered on the wooden deck nearly as big as the entire flat back in Boston; and Sherlock had fetched every sex accessory they’d packed and laid them out on a small table beside an over-the-top piece of outdoor furniture: a queen bed piled with pillows, its lower corner draped with soft throw-blankets, a mosquito net hanging above, ready to be unfurled at dusk. There was soft lighting, a sound system playing Adés, Stravinsky, and Chopin—music to set a particular mood—one suited to the decadent scenario presented by a bed outdoors in the mountains on a summer evening, with no one nearby to see or hear the practical outcome of evoking such a mood.
“I will, indeed.”
“I’ll get it,” John volunteered.
Sherlock resumed his seat with three pencils of varying lengths and points and a yellow, lined pad; he dealt them each a sheet of paper and a pencil.
SH: Kill them all. Take their things.
“They all were. Oh, it was a relief to see them turn brunette. That’s the Scott side coming through.” She lifted her head toward the closed door to the little room off the back of the kitchen. “Eansworth, I’m coming in. I’m showing John the scrapbooks.”
He should have saved it. He saw it coming. He was ready for it. And yet, the music was playing and the Gold Rush players were clumped up in a huddle off to his right, congratulating their goal-scorer. He could imagine what the play-by-play and color guys were saying on the BSN broadcast right now, wondering how Holmes could have missed that save, no one in front of him, a long lob from high up the ice with plenty of time for him to get himself in catching position, or even to stop it with his chest. Maybe he’d flinched.
John set his wine glass on the side table and caressed its foot with his fingertip, listening, with his lip-corners just barely lifted.
John pressed his lips together, then said rather softly, “That doesn’t sound like resentment; it sounds like—”
Reaching for the stack of bedclothes, John said, “You’re frowning like mad. Head hurting a lot? Here. Sit.”
which he recognised, and which made him feel a bit weak-kneed. Was John meant to be playing. . .?
“Hey, yourself. What’s for dinner?”
“For Sherlock to adopt me. Is it a present because I’m getting adopted?”
He was called Steven, a name Sherlock was fond of because it had been the name of his first lover, a coffee shop counterman with sharp, gravity-defying fringe and a strong jaw. The newer, older Steven walked Sherlock down a corridor past closed office doors and glass-walled conference rooms on one side, half-walled cubicles on the other. Steven greeted the few people they passed, the not-too-friendly boss. Sherlock shifted his eyes down and to the side, eyed him up from Prada oxfords to Hugo Boss suit to silk necktie and sapphire-studded tie tack.  Matching sapphire links in the French cuffs of his shirt. It occurred to Sherlock that for the first time in many years, he was about to have sex with a man even wealthier than he was.
John squeezed and shoved at his pinned wrists—an urgent, commanding motion.
Mutterings of agreement could be heard all over the room. Sherlock had clenched his fists the second he sat; easing his fingers open revealed red half-moon slits dug into his pale palms. John had told him he looked good. Coach Lestrade had said the Gold Rush were just lucky. Twenty minutes and it would be done. His teammates would work on scoring; with any luck he’d have an easy third.
“Oh,” the man said, and stood straight. “That’s kind of you.”
Sherlock did not ask how his brother came to have his calendar. “I do, in fact, and if Mother doesn’t set John loose directly we’ll be late for it.”
He jogged across the grounds to the house, was still the last to arrive at the table despite his effort to hurry. He carried in the pocket of his trousers the little notebook where he kept his sketches, its pages bulging from tucked-in scraps of treasure.
“I have to learn how to live like a real person again,” John mused. “Last time I did it, I was. . .six? I don’t think the same rules apply to a man of thirty-eight.”
“Fucking hell.” Cursing through tight teeth, and Sherlock sighed pleasure, losing the plot as he lingered in the sensation of becoming muzzy-minded with lust, sensation overtaking thought, until John whined and nipped at his lips, and Sherlock reached lower, to tickle John’s bollocks then roll them against his cupped fingers. John tried to kiss, only managed the faintest brush of dry lips against Sherlock’s own parted ones before Sherlock resumed the earnest motion of his quick wrist, light fingers, and John thrust into the curl of his palm. Sherlock slid a foot down John’s ankle, toed his sole to move him closer, a sort of embrace.
John looked perfectly gorgeous in a pinstriped navy suit, taking a risk with a dress-striped shirt in paler blue and white, with a white collar. Sherlock had watched him knot his necktie and found it an impossibly compelling sight; doubtless John’s head was clearer for having had a hurry-or-we’ll-miss-our-reservation blow job back at the hotel. Sherlock quickly decided, set his menu aside, and nudged John’s ankle with the toe of his shoe.
“Ah, Watson! Excellent. First: Are you hungry?”
“It’s no bother,” Sherlock replied from the kitchen, where he was methodically opening one cupboard door after the other. “What’s your drink?”
And then he was coming, thick pulses that crisscrossed the soaked-in stains of Sherlock’s own spunk on the front of his shirt. John shivered and dropped his head back, and Sherlock worked the pad of his thumb in firm, massaging circles over the back of John’s thumb, their hands still clutched tight together and resting on John’s thigh.
He sent a frantic text to Alex George near-begging him to throw any of Sherlock’s belongings he saw around the suite into his bag and bring it to the arena. He summoned a car, knowing he’d never make it. The expression of snide amusement on Steven’s face nearly razed him; he felt scattered and small, splintered to bits.
“Does it matter?” Sherlock was exasperated. Perhaps feeling a bit guilty. But he’d been the one refused access to their ill child while the
John laughed.
“Every last one of my buttons has been pressed until it has stuck.”
“I’ll take care of them, Eansworth,” Mrs Holmes dismissed him. “I just thought you’d want to see the boys before they go.”
John looked down his own front—pastel, watch plaid button-down and narrow jeans—and asked, “Should I change, then?”
Sherlock slid and picked the sturdy, engraved business card off the slick-polished surface of Mycroft’s massive desk, tucked it between the notes in his money clip to keep it secret and safe.
John flicked his gaze up above Sherlock’s head. He was stood in the doorway between the two rooms, and there was a sprig of ribbon-tied mistletoe pinned to the center of its frame. “Look at that,” John said, and reached for Sherlock’s hand, and stepped at last as close as he’d longed to.
He’d have lain on a bed of nails if it meant Rosie slept every night in the same room.
. John’s transformation from slack and silent to tense and growling in the course of those few moments was magnificent; Sherlock felt privileged and powerful, bringing him to life.
Sherlock put his hand on top of John’s, and directed his gaze upward toward the cliff. There was not much to see; too high for birds, too rocky for plants. “That bit looks like the Shard,” Sherlock said, pointing to direct John’s attention.
As Rosie was asleep on the bed just a couple yards from the little dining table, John had his laptop’s brightness turned down as low as it could go, squinting through his cheaters to check for typos.  He sat back and let his focus soften, gazing into the dim as he worked out how to write the next bit in a way that was definitive without being unkind. It was a delicate situation—one he and Sherlock had not discussed in the intervening days—and which must be addressed before they spent time together. Better to get it set aside sooner than later, so they could enjoy the holiday with Rosie as their sole focus. No questions unanswered; no tension in the air. Or at least no more tension than was usual.
By the time Sherlock heard John’s footfalls descending the stairs, he had finished the washing-up and was in his chair with the file folder full of newly-squared-up papers, bare toes of his right foot wriggling into and out of the carpet.
“Is that a directive, or. . . ?”
Of course Sherlock was plainly aware he was the cat looking to get itself killed through self-indulgent curiosity; always had been. Inching closer, half-out of the shadows, eventually donning a third or less of some disguise or other and walking straight into the thick of it. Thugs and schemers looking at him through narrowed eyes, knives no doubt folded inside their pockets, if not already in their hands. Now and then there was a foot chase, a climb up an aged and rusty fire escape, a dog trained to go for the bollocks. It was a damned shame his body was betraying him by beginning to break down when he was as keen to take on all comers as he had been at twenty-five. His reflexes were slower—still quicker than most—and his eyes and ears were becoming alarmingly lazy. Danger was intrinsic; a knock on the head now and then was a good reminder that he must stay alert and on his toes. And perhaps not go alone to a counterfeiter’s warehouse in the earliest hours of a Tuesday morning.
John thought about where he’d been the previous Christmas, and Sherlock brought the bottle and two rocks glasses, handed them to John and let him pour. He opened cupboards below his book shelf, which also held the TV set.
With nowhere else to be but there, in their own bed, in their own flat, knees touching and hands on each other’s naked torsos, Sherlock relished the luxury of being at home, in bed with his man. He hummed—sleepy—sated—and John rested a hand against the side of his throat, stroking his thumb over the bump of Sherlock’s adam’s apple.
“They’ll find me out, and they’ll come and take her, and then I’ll have.” He sobbed, and Sherlock’s heart broke.
“Mm.”
“Did he finger you?” Sherlock wanted to know. He could imagine John’s hips rocking in time, the flex of his calves as he held his legs bent back at the knees.
“Not really my thing.”
“Let it be a lesson to you,” Sherlock replied. There was a protruding overlook, about twenty feet long, with a floor made of glass which reminded Sherlock—perhaps too much—of a diving platform. “Shall we walk out there?” he joked.
And then he was gone again.
“Did you think you were taller than last time?” he asked, aware of the tightness of his teeth even as he joked.
“I’ll draw a picture for Granny for her birthday.”
“Yeah, sounds like that's what he said. Ol’ Bernie Comfort.”
It was true Sherlock had frequent, fond memories of their first encounter—how shocked and reticent John had been when Sherlock moved from side-by-side masturbation, to taking John firmly in hand, and finally kneeling between his knees on a hotel bed, licking and swallowing, urgent to taste him.
“Fine with me,” Sherlock agreed. The tequila was as terrible as it was expensive, and he longed to get the taste out of his mouth.
New hockey term! Well, a sports term, generally.
Sherlock reached for her and they embraced. “I can’t wait to see you again, Watson.”
“Are you going?” he deflected, unwilling to acknowledge having so quickly and so thoroughly succumbed to the post-adrenaline crash. John’s hand on his shoulder had not been thrown off, despite the turbulence.
In Sherlock’s room, John fidgeted with whatever came to hand—an antimacassar draped over the back of Sherlock’s armchair, the corner of the pillowslip, the handle of the wardrobe—and his breath was huffy. Sherlock unbuttoned his coat and had to wait for John to step aside before hanging it inside the wardrobe. As he did, John sat heavily on the edge of the bed, tapping his feet restlessly against the floorboards. Moving to unfasten his shirt cuffs, Sherlock smoothed his voice as he asked, “Something’s bothering you?”
“The children went to care?”
“Good,” John said, quiet, soothing, and though no time passed, at once Sherlock became aware of sounds in the kitchen, cutlery and the taps, stoneware plates set on butcher block worktops. The television or radio. But no, John was talking back to it. Laughing, but quietly.
“In the meantime,” Sherlock said, brushing his hands together to clean them of crumbs and sweep away tension, “I’ll text Thurston and see if he’s free tomorrow for a shoot-around.”
John stepped into Sherlock’s space and ran a hand down his shirtfront. “Oh, is that how it is, pretty boy?” One eyebrow rose above his mischievous gaze. He pressed a palm against the center of Sherlock’s chest and gave a gentle, insistent push. “To my room, then,” he demanded, tipping up his chin to direct Sherlock backward. “I think I deserve some of your attention.”
“He said he would have been having multiple and frequent amourous encounters with ladies, as well, except that he couldn’t convince any ladies to shag him.”
John frowned, looking vaguely embarrassed. “There’s a lot of glad-handing, posing for photos, making small talk before and after. I don’t mind the time I’m talking, and I enjoyed writing it more than I imagined I would—I had some idea it would be like writing theme essays in school, but it’s actually kind of, I don’t know, fun.”
“Of course I do. The Thrashers had control to my right, high in the circle. Our defensive pair were Siven and Ross, but they were gassed, looking for a change. I figured if they got the puck they’d ice it just to get a rest. You were up high to my left, waiting near the blue line. Hamilton had a huge amount of zone time, something like thirty-nine seconds, putting intense pressure on us.”
“A bit. His mum—Clara—was married to my sister Harry when Archie was very young. They divorced. But you could say he’s a cousin.”
Sherlock’s mother called over her shoulder. “It certainly is, Sherlock.”
“Excellent.”
John grinned behind the rim of his glass, shook his head with amusement.
“Thanks for that. I’ve got to get to the clinic. Enjoy your day.” He cleared his throat again, and allowed himself to turn his back. He heard the door shut with a sound thump as he marched up the pavement toward the tube station.
(and thank you, Trixie, for the inspiration)
John raised his eyebrows but only said, “That’ll be fun.”
“I used to type a lot, before. You don’t remember? When Sherlock and I were working together on his cases, and then I’d type up the stories for people to read.”
Sherlock’s face blazed hot—the top edges of his ears—and he stripped off the shirt with no further attempts at a teasing slow-reveal.
“I don’t think you are.”
Sherlock, by then nearly finished with his breakfast, scraped up the last forkful of eggs and potatoes from his plate and used speaking through the resultant mouthful as an indication of casualness. “Talking of health and safety,” he began, “What’s Doc giving out in the way of sleep aids these days? Do you know?”
His mother hummed, half as if she were shaming him, half as if she couldn’t be bothered listening to him while she had John nearby to admire—a sentiment Sherlock well understood. In moments Sherlock had stirred up the entire company to the point of bustling them into the entry hall in a swirl; before his mother could register protest, or his father complaint, he and John were striding down the front path away from the house. Mycroft tipped his chin at them as the drivers of two waiting town cars opened doors for them. John looked amused and surprised as Sherlock shoved at his shoulder in a frantic attempt to put him inside the second car.
John nodded, though his facial expression indicated he was ill-inclined to fully accept Sherlock’s line of argument. He looked weary. “You know what I’m going to say.”
Palms licked and fingers sucked, taking him in hand with a sounds and sensations so much like relief, mouths close but not quite kissing, now and then a nuzzle or nudge with chin or nose. His low hums, his soft groaning, his fist wrapped just loose enough, sliding a twist of the wrist. Their bodies moving together and apart, panting,
Such thoughts reminded him that as well-balanced and ready as he felt, there was a shard of not-quite-right stuck in his chest, and he texted John.
“I don’t wear any.”
Sherlock nodded.
In a tone Sherlock by then had come to know well--of contentment and a little disbelief, warm with adoration--John’s easy response was, “Now I’ve got you, my own one, I’ve nothing left to hope for. I’ve no need to make a wish.”
John cradled Sherlock’s jaw in one rough-gentle hand, sighing in an entirely different way, all the while Sherlock fervently loved him.
John finished by once again thanking the Thrashers and the fans for the honour of retiring his number, then waited with Kim beside him as the banner bearing his name and number, and the dates of his years with the team, was brought forth with a flourish, rolled tight on its hanging rod. When it was raised and unfurled, the crowd somehow got even louder, and music played, and the GM was making the retirement of Thrashers’ 18 official though whatever he said was largely drowned out and ignored. The banner was affixed to wires and began its ascent to the rafters. John’s face fifty times its usual size, up on the scoreboard, was both smiling and tear-streaked. All players present banged their sticks on the ice, on the floor by the bench, on the boards in front of them, that unique form of applause. Sherlock stood—everyone stood—and he whistled and whooped with the best of them.
“Mine.” Sherlock held up his thumb. “An artist in Kansas City makes them; luckily I find myself there a few times a year. Had it made, my last time through.”
Sherlock wished for something to eat that wasn’t soft and easy; he needed to gnash his teeth.
“Yes. Do it.”
“He shouldn’t look at you that way,” John muttered, and put his hands on Sherlock’s chest, firm at first but quickly becoming gentle, stroking over the fabric of the white shirt, across and down. “No one should.” He sounded indignant, though his voice was much softer, and then plaintive. “You’re too precious for it.”
“You know she’s not our mum,” John said, mildly questioning. “She’s neither of our mum.”
“I know. But I’ll try to arrange it if you want me there. Just say the word.”
Mags: How about around the league?
They are both super nice in person and on the phone.
JW: Were you, really?
Kocur was once again wearing the captain’s C on his sweater—and though Sherlock had, as usual, voted for himself, he was satisfied that if it had to be anyone other than John Watson, the team had done the right thing by going back to Pietr Kocur. Sherlock wasn’t sure about Kocur’s new linemate, a rookie fresh out of Harvard called Joe Mercer, and didn’t fully trust him, but the kid was a worker and listened more than talked, both good signs he might work out.
John wondered why Sherlock could not just say
“You don’t have to watch her every second,” John told him. Sherlock glanced his way and John half-smiled to show he wasn’t criticising; Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at him and John looked away. “One of the perks of her getting older is that we can trust her not to do a runner. When she was two and three, remember we each had to stand by a gate to be sure she didn’t go greet a dog or take herself home?”
“Good, then. I’ll check in with you. Coach Whitehouse will be in touch later today to set up some one-on-one time. Make sure you take advantage of it.”
“Hm. Old habits.”
Sherlock pursed his lips and transferred the offending pot from the cooker to the sink, turned the cold tap on it and raised a new cloud, this one of steam. After a silence that would have been awkward were John not so amused, Sherlock said huffily. “I’m making jam.”
“Fuck,” he cursed, under his breath but aloud. He finished his shower and returned to the dressing room, where he bundled into workout gear rather than his usual suit, pulling his sweatshirt’s hood around his ears to indicate he wanted to be left alone. On the shelf in his locker was the thing every Brawler dreaded: a postcard with the logo on one side and a hand-scrawled note on the other.
John reached behind his head and clicked off the lamp beside the sofa, dug his nose into his pillow. It was an interesting concept, vaccinating themselves against the negative outcomes of disconnection. He’d keep thinking it over. Sleep on it.
Sherlock went for his water bottle, mentally chanting his mantra, then slid on his catching glove and crouched in front of his net.
“Yes.”
John hummed agreement; she wasn’t wrong, but it was another topic that didn’t really need to be explored. They arrived at their flat and very soon were free of jumpers and jackets and shoes, Rosie’s school bag on the floor, John ducking to look in the fridge for something they could eat. He had the strangest craving for buttered noodles.
“They sold privacy to me as an amenity, so I have to hope that’s true.”
OK, so we edited out the boring stuff like Hi, can you hear me? and introducing ourselves (we interviewed them via conference call). We talked for about forty-five minutes, sometimes about dumb stuff you don’t care about like how we decided to start the blog and hockey-geek stuff you might care about but which is not fun to describe in this format, like who we like for the upcoming season, and why Graham McInearney is the most undervalued center in the league right now.
“Thanks for that,” John said, his expression mildly quizzical, gaze flicking up and down as if reassuring himself it was Sherlock he was talking to. Sherlock squeezed his own hands; he had a terrible urge to open his arms to John just then, as he had many times in the past, in the wake of similar stories of bad days. But it was no longer a job for him.
Throughout an hour-long haranguing from Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes had come across as perhaps not apologetic, but definitely subdued. He defended the shape of the letter to John and the attached motion for Sherlock’s adoption of Rosie, chalked it up to a misunderstanding of Sherlock’s wishes.
“OK. Remember though, I asked you about my name Mary?”
“Why not? Children can be quite nice.”
, you said?”
John swung his feet out from under the blankets, thinking of a walk to the kitchen for a glass of water. Normal things in normal places: the kettle on the worktop. Kitchen towel on the stove handle. Non-skid rug by the sink.  After that he’d go to the bath, open the cold tap and drench his face. A shock. A gasp. A reminder that he must breathe.
Sherlock was saved from having to come up with more items for the To-Do list John seemed to want from him by the server bringing their appetizers and the sommelier the next course of wine. To his mild amusement, the first pour was offered to John for his approval, and with a light shrug he sipped—Sherlock could see him holding the wine in his mouth, coating his tongue before swallowing—then nodded and said, “Very nice, thank you.”
Sherlock curled up closer to himself, drawing in his knees. “How thoughtful,” he said, and meant it, though it sounded as if he was teasing. “After the game with the Thrashers, I’m on a plane to Philadelphia, and you come home. This is madness. Call the Brawlers’ office and ask them to take you back. Here.” He held out his phone. “Use mine.”
?” Rosie whined, leaning at an impossible angle on the arm of the sofa, with the unfocused gaze of exhaustion obvious in her eyes, crowding into John’s space despite the fact the two of them had been rowing for something like three hours.
“McInearney’s on fire so far this season,” John offered, referencing the Gold Rush second-line center, just then skating past his team’s bench to bump gloves in celebration of his goal, the first of the game.
“Naturally,” Sherlock replied, mock-dismissive. It was too obvious to require articulation.
“What a fanciful notion,” Sherlock replied, moved as ever by John’s tendency toward romantic poetry in even the most mundane of circumstances. Not that the dozens, perhaps hundreds of hectic stars were a mundanity, of course; Sherlock appreciated the spectacle as much as the weight of John’s head resting in his lap.
“Here, c’mere.” His head pulled back by the hair at his crown, and he spit, and it landed on his own thigh. Tight grip around his upper arm to urge him to his feet, and a stumble to the bed. “Face down,” Steven commanded, and Sherlock obediently lay down on his belly, mashed his face into the bleachy pillow, nodding, nodding,
“Best not drink any more of this,” Sherlock mused, spinning the cap onto her mostly-full bottle of orange soda. He stood, swinging her rucksack onto his own shoulder. Rosie was already obviously in much better humour, having got some good-quality calories into her. She reached for Sherlock’s hand, and while she double-timed, Sherlock cut his normal pace in half to match her, and they made it to Baker Street in sufficient time to meet her needs.
It’s more the situation. It feels absurdly surreal, sitting here with her and Sherlock, knowing it’s his wife in the chair and his best friend on the bed. It to be the other way around. Then at least some of his feelings would make a little sense. He’s grieving. He’s grieved before. He’s even grieved for Sherlock before. Back then, it had felt
If you haven't noticed, I expanded the last chapter with another segment, so please go back and read that if you haven't already before proceeding.
John represses a sigh. Some nickname he’s got settled with, and from his own wife at that. Perhaps he deserves it.
Moriarty, on the other hand, seems to revel in it. He enters into the game, smirk glued to his face and eyes glittering with amusement.
Some people say that your life flashes before your eyes when you’re in a life-or-death situation. After being shot and nearly bleeding out on the second floor in a deserted and utterly derelict building outside Kandahar, John can testify to the fact that your life indeed does not flash before your eyes. Because you’re too bloody scared to think and the last thing you feel like doing while watching the blood leaving your body at an alarming rate is take a moment to reminisce about childhood fishing trips.
And John has no idea how to answer that. Instead, he pulls Sherlock to him and kisses him again, willing his lips to convey things that John doesn’t have the words to explain.
Sherlock has decided to treat this like an experiment apparently, for both of their sakes.
John takes Sherlock’s gasp into his mouth, a hot gush of air passing from one to the other, and it suddenly strikes Sherlock than none of the kisses he’s begrudgingly had to bear witness to between John and his various girlfriends had looked as passionate or as desperate as what John is sharing with him now. He moves his hips experimentally against John’s, feels his movement immediately reciprocated in kind and then some. John practically grinds up against him.
. He could at least pretend not to mock Sherlock outright.
These two first chapters have been such downers, I'm sorry. I'm afraid this is hurt/comfort with a very long way to go before we get to the comfort.
“Serbia?”
Which is perhaps what’s at the centre of all this confusion. John doesn’t know what it means. Not Sherlock’s disappearance, not Sherlock’s reappearance, not those looks, not how it makes John feel, not any of it.
“I think we can both agree that this is pretty damn far from
Somewhere in the back of his mind there is still the occasional sound of an angry alarm bell. A subconscious warning that he needs to be on his guard, that somehow this is not wholly and unquestionably good. That he needs to be careful or he might get burned by the candle he’s orbiting in an ever shrinking circle.
“How does it make you feel, Ice Man? Even you must have a heart somewhere in there, I suppose. You’ve held your own little brother back all these years. Talked him down over and over. Told him that he was just a stupid, scared little boy who couldn’t hold a candle to you. Repeated it again and again. Until he forgot that it was a lie.”
When Sherlock stirs in the morning and calls to John from his bedroom and John enters to find him trussed up in bed, duvet caught between his legs and curls splaying out across the pillow with a few stray strands sticking up at all sorts of odd angles. And Sherlock reaches out for him and taking that hand feels like coming home all over again.
Sherlock almost recoils, but Jim’s hand on his prevents him from turning away entirely. Unable to escape, he instead turns his shocked eyes to the person he would loosely refer to as his partner.
Sherlock’s expression instantly softens. He slumps slightly in his upper body, dispelling the tension that was keeping him upright. Then he steps forward, slowly, as though he’s afraid of John’s reaction. When he’s close enough to touch, he envelops John in his arms with so much care and precision that he must feel as though John might be close to collapse, quite probably in a puddle of his own tears. And although John doesn’t feel close to tears in this moment, the sheer tenderness of Sherlock’s embrace makes John feel so incredibly cared for that he almost does cry. Sherlock holds him as though he was holding the most precious, fragile gem imaginable.
The first few days back at Baker Street are chaotic to say the least. Family, friends and (as Sherlock would have put it with all his usual tact and diplomacy)
. It’s been an age since Sherlock has allowed himself to just
“I know. I know you do, and it’s not up to me to decide when or if you want to move back in with her. This flat is… it’s here for as long and as often as you need it, but you can leave any time you’d like. You just didn’t want to leave now, and I felt I needed to remind you of that.”
It’s as though he's a house of cards. He collapsed at the wedding (perhaps even before that – perhaps it started all the way back in Serbia if Sherlock is being honest with himself), and since then the cards have been lying on his desk, every piece present but a poor representation of what it used to be. Sherlock has spent ages trying to rebuilt himself only to see it fall apart again and again and again until the very thought of trying one more time had become exhausting and sad, failure a foregone conclusion.
