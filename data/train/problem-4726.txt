Soon, Tony was cracking up under Steve’s hands, who knew all the most ticklish places in his body. Steve asked Tony a few times if he was ready to give in and get ready for bed, but his stubborn partner shook his head effusively as he tried to get away from him, ineffectively. It was until Steve lifted Tony’s t-shirt and pressed his mouth against his belly, blowing raspberries, that Tony couldn’t take it anymore.
“Of course we can talk Cap! Don’t thigh you star-spangled ass. What do you want to talk about, huh? Do you want to ask me for an improvement on your shield? Do you want a color change, I don’t know, something a little bit pinkish? Do you think your pants need to be tighter? Because let me tell you, your fans would totally love that! Or maybe you want my help to steal Fury’s eyepatch! I know you’ve been thinking about that too! But let me tell you something here Gramps, we are definitely going to be benched after that, are you…”
“We need to talk Tony, it’s not possible you keep avoiding me like this anymore. We’re a team, we need to be in touch in order to work correctly in the battlefield,” Steve argued, sitting down next to him.
“I’m not going to be mad or anything, baby, I promise,” Steve assured, and he meant it. Even if the reason turned out to be something completely flimsy and senseless, Steve would never hold a grudge. That’d only continue the vicious circle they’d gotten themselves into. “I just want to know so we can fix this once and for all,” he said, and he could feel Tony tensing.
Because of that, Steve saw himself forced to allow Clint to wear normal jeans and not the elastic-waist ones he usually wore whenever he was Little; he had had no choice but to let Clint watch an action movie which any parent would never let a toddler watch; he had had to serve snacks before lunch, and not after; and he hadn’t been able to talk Clint into eating something more nutritious than the Chinese food he had had demanded. The only thing Steve hadn’t consented was to grant him permission to stay without a pull-up, and even if Clint had disagreed very loudly, Steve preferred to deal with a pout than with an accident.
However, that description only applied to Tony when he was in his adult mindset. His baby side, on the other hand, had proven to have a looser grab on his emotions, impulses and behavior. Steve had seen Tony acting a bit unfriendly towards Clint a few times when being in his Little headspace, and Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that what had happened today had been caused by another fit of jealousy of his baby.
“Hey there, sleepyhead,” Steve greeted when he was sure Tony was aware of his surroundings. A tiny smile tugged at his lips as he stretched, and Steve couldn’t help brushing another kiss now over Tony’s forehead. “Did my baby have a good nap?” Tony nodded, movement barely imperceptible. “Good, it makes Daddy happy when you rest.”
Without further ado, Steve slid his hands under Tony’s armpits and scooped him up, enjoying how his baby curled into him. “Do you like it when Daddy carries you?” he asked, because Tony hadn’t exactly said so, and Steve still refused to let even this slide. Tony nodded. “I want a verbal answer, sweetpea,” he ordered as he gave the baby a loving pat on his diapered bottom, making him whine. “So?”
Steve brought the back of his hand up to wipe his forehead, sweat running freely down his face regardless of the fact that JARVIS kept the tower at an ideal temperature all year round. It had taken him all afternoon, he had struggled a bit with understanding some of the instructions and he had found out that nails and screws could multiply or disappear out of the blue, but it had been all worth it. The guest room wasn’t a playroom anymore, it had been turned into a nursery and it was just as Steve had imagined it.
“Of course baby boy, I promise this is between just you and me,” Steve assured, pulling him closer in a gentle way. Tony hesitated a little, looking around to verify the room was empty before he let his head rest on his shoulder and enclose Steve’s neck with his arms. “Let’s go and get ready for bed,” said Steve when he started to walk toward the elevator, patting Tony tenderly on the back.
Distrusting everyone in order to avoid being disappointed yet once more was a pretty understandable coping mechanism, and Steve didn’t judge Tony in the slightest for acquiring it. However, the fact that Steve comprehended hadn’t made Tony’s supposition any less painful.
"Then why are you looking away?" Steve pointed out, and Tony wasn't even aware he was doing that. Although he couldn't make himself turn his head to look at him either. "Tony," Steve called him with that tone of voice that served as a warning sign.
“JARVIS, is he OK?” Steve decided to ask the AI, knowing that the chances he could understand Tony were almost non-existent.
Although Tony tried to think nothing of it, he couldn’t help noticing how often Steve hung out with Clint. Of course that was nothing out of the ordinary, Steve started to spent time with Clint way before Tony and he began dating. And, to be honest, Tony couldn’t even tell if Steve was spending more, less or the same amount of time with Clint than prior their fight, though that wasn’t really the point of the issue. What intrigued Tony was what Steve and Clint were doing when being together.
Tony took a few steps forward before stopping and turning around to look at him, anxiety written all over his face. Pushing aside the thought that he should’ve waited until after lunch, Steve smiled, nodded and gestured with his hands to go ahead. After staring at him for several more seconds, Tony turned around, and with the tip of his index finger stuck into his mouth, he began looking around the room.
“Captain Rogers, I took the liberty to call Agent Coulson, he’s on the line and he’d like to talk to young agent Barton,” JARVIS announced out of the blue, startling the three of them. Clint lifted his teary face, calling for his daddy, and began crying harder when the room was filled with Phil’s voice, looking desperately for him.
Tony flopped down onto the couch, eyes fixed on the dozens of open boxes that flooded his workshop. The clean-up would be a pain. Tony might like neat and tidy places, but that didn’t mean he liked to clean. He would prefer to build a robot which get rid of the mess than tidying up himself. As a matter of fact, Tony might as well do that – after all, it wouldn’t be the first time, nobody knew but Dummy’s first task was throwing away the coffee cups, food wraps and all that got accumulated on his desk – but right now he needed to focus on the contents of the boxes rather than the boxes themselves.
“Diapers are for babies!” Clint repeated, voice angry but eyes beginning to fill with tears. Steve didn’t want to have two crying littles at once.
Because of that, Phil wanted to reciprocate. He wanted to be there for Tony like Steve had been for there for Clint. If Clint had a hard time despite being a toddler, Tony would have it worse being a baby. Steve had told him his assistance wouldn’t be really needed since Tony didn’t slip into his littlespace without his encouragement, but Phil had promised to help if it was ever necessary anyway. And he was determined to keep that promise.
“It’s okay champ, Uncle Steve’s here,” Steve soothed, as he sat down on the other side of the couch where Tony was, swinging Clint’s legs up so that he was sitting sideways. Clint let out a sob, and hid his face against Steve’s chest.
That was what had led Tony to his current predicament. He had woken up with a strong urge to pee, and even if he had been about to wake Steve up so he took his diaper off as usual, Tony had refrained himself from doing so. What was the point of wearing a diaper if he wasn't going to use it? There was no doubt Steve wouldn't mind if he did, Tony even got the feeling that Steve wanted him to. So, Tony might as well do it.
“It’s okay, baby boy, as I said, it’s just not in my plans to leave you. I’m afraid you’re stuck with me for a very long time, sweetheart,” he threatened jokingly, earning a smile from Tony. “But you know, I’d really like to know how you came up with that idea.” That comment made Tony’s body go rigid once more. “I know, honey, I know,” he hurried to say before his baby could refute anything, “Daddy’s being a bit obnoxious today, but if I did do something that made you think such a thing, well, I need to know so I don’t make that mistake again.”
But now, Tony would give anything to have Steve right there beside him, because that stupid nightmare had unsettled him more than it should have, more than he was willing to admit. Once his anger towards JARVIS decreased a bit, Tony realized his heart continued pounding like a jackhammer, he’d broken out in a sweat yet again, and he could literally feel the fear creeping under his skin, because as illogical and implausible it was, he couldn’t help thinking someone would slam open the door at any moment and drag him out of bed and into a place he couldn’t nor didn’t want to imagine.
“No, I haven’t broken your nose sir, my sensors tell me it’s perfectly fine.” Was that mock on the AI voice? Why do all the things he invented always turn against him?
But then Tony took quick glance to Steve’s face, and he knew that any attempt to lie wouldn’t be well received.
“OK, see you in an hour then!” Steve looked at Tony when he said this. Tony rolled his eyes boringly. He kept forcing his brain to think about something, but still nothing. Maybe if he jumped from the balcony, he...
“I don’t have another one. Drink from your bottle now, and I promise I’ll buy you one tomorrow, you can even choose it,” Steve offered, pressing the nipple against Tony’s lips. Tony pushed it away once more.
His father made sure Tony never got his hands on anything Howard considered childish, he even got someone to go through Tony’s stuff in his dorm once in a while to make sure he wasn’t sneaking in anything he shouldn’t. Even Rhodey confessed to him once that Howard had contacted him and offered him a large sum of money in order to keep an eye on him and report back to him if Tony ever did something out of the ordinary. Rhodey denied the offer, of course.
Tony looked around with the intention to find something that may help him, and a twinge of guilt settle in his stomach when his eyes laid on Bruce.
, carton included. Tony still remembered the morning he stepped into the kitchen and ran into the recycling bins Steve had bought to help everyone sort the garbage. It had been very difficult to implement the habit of recycling in the Tower, but Steve had that thing of making you felt guilty in a way for not doing the right thing, so everybody ended up agreeing.
"Noodle soup and steamed vegetable salad,” Steve replied, and he chuckled when Tony pretended he was going to be sick. Why couldn’t Steve eat like a normal person? Why did he insist on eating healthy food when there were different types of delicious junk food they could choose from? “Wipe that look off you face, I made hamburgers for you,” Steve stated, making Tony grin.
“No! Let me go!” Tony demanded, but Steve had already walked toward the rocking chair and sat down on it, placing Tony on his lap before he could hold onto something to stop Steve. “Let me go, you asshole! How the hell did you find out this room? Why the hell did you this?! How dared you! Let me go this instant!” he kept demanding, trying to loosen Steve’s grip, but he wasn’t strong enough to achieve it.
First, there was the fact that Tony had no idea how to go into his littlespace at will. According to comments he had read on the Internet, there were certain triggers that helped people to get into it more easily, like playing with toys, watching cartoons, wearing diapers, building a blanket and pillow fort, being baby-talked, but it was clear that those things didn’t trigger anything in Tony. He had tried.
Without warning, he picked up Tony and balanced him on his hip, wrapping an arm around his waist and a hand supporting his butt. Tony squealed in surprise, it was the first time Steve carried him like that while being completely awake and Tony was embarrassed to admit it was kind of scary. He threw his arms and legs around Steve’s neck and waist, feeling stupid. If Steve let him fall, Tony wouldn’t get hurt seriously – Steve was tall, but not that much – though the floor looked unusually far from up there.
“I apologize, Sir,” JARVIS said, “but you gave Captain Rogers full access to the Tower, and that includes information, unless you order me differently.”
Tony remembered clearly the day he was summoned to his house out of the blue. It wasn’t his birthday – not that it mattered anyway, he had never had a birthday party or anything like that–, and it wasn’t Christmas either. It’s was a Wednesday, in the middle of the school year, all holidays or vacations still very far away. He felt uneasy, having no idea why his father wanted to see him all of a sudden. His hands had started to sweat as he walked to his father’s office, millions of thoughts about why he was there were zooming through his mind. He knocked on the door and went in, and he could feel his knees turn to jelly when he saw his father sitting down behind the desk, holding a package of pull-ups in his hands.
Steve struggled with all his might to resist the gigantic urge to scoop Tony up, and the hurt pout on his baby’s face made it even more difficult. Turning down his incitements had been fairly easy when Tony had been in his adult mindset, doing it when he’d evidently slipped into his little headspace was proving to be tortuous. Not even halfway through their way towards the nursery, Steve couldn’t take it anymore and held out a hand to him. Guilt flared in his stomach when Tony took it with both hands in desperate contentment.
For instance, Steve found Tony wandering around the tower several times a day instead of shutting himself in his precious workshop as he usually did. And even if Tony pretended it wasn’t on purpose, it was obvious for Steve that running into him all the time was not a simple coincidence.
From that moment on, Tony’s life was invaded by people who told him he had to get rid of his Little side. Howard didn’t hesitate to send him to numerous psychologists where he had to put up with endless hours of therapy, trying to explain something he didn’t even understand himself. But he wasn’t stupid, quite the opposite he was a genius, so he never told the truth to any of the psychologists, he just said enough so his father would be satisfied when they reported back to him about his sessions.
were the kind of moments Steve wanted to have. The ones he wanted to share with Tony. Peaceful, entertaining and fulfilling. It was just perfect, Tony snuggled against him, trusting he could sleep calmly as Steve would take care of any trouble that might arise. Because that was all Steve wanted to do, he just wanted to take care of Tony in every possible way. The age play would just allow Tony to take part in that process and benefit from it.
Should he ask Phil to help him? Should he print all the information he had found online and give it to Tony? Should he get JARVIS to display to Tony the websites he had visited? Should he just sit down with Tony and explain him himself? Steve had no idea of how to proceed.
"No. That was what Howard made you believe, but he was wrong. I already told you, there's nothing wrong with this. And I do want to help you,” Steve urged, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder and squishing it as a sign of support, he didn’t like seeing Tony having this mental war.
Steve smiled at Tony in agreement, and after dropping a quick kiss on his forehead, he stood up, lifting him up in the process, though instead of placing him on his hip as it’d become customary, Steve set Tony down on his feet on the floor. Tony felt perplexed, and had Steve not turned around and walked away into the hallway, he’d probably wonder why Daddy wasn’t carrying him.
Tony started to gasp for breath as though somehow the air in the room stopped being enough to fill his lungs. Why on earth had he destroyed everything?  Why hadn’t he remembered that his teddy was there, abandoned by him a few weeks ago because his owner was too afraid of hugging him because it wasn’t an adult thing to do? Steve was usually the one who retrieved it from the nursery and handed it to him whenever he managed to let his little side out, and Tony was the one who always took it back to the nursery once his adult side came back, sometimes a little bit mad at Steve because he encouraged him to keep it on his bed even if they weren’t age-playing.
“Of course, I love playing with you,” Phil said before brushing a kiss over Clint’s shoulder. Clint squirmed a little.
But obviously Tony wasn’t going to do fulfil his request, not when he had been trying to get out of this for more than an hour now. As soon as Steve moved away to grab the diaper, Tony stood up fast and walked away, totally forgetting the fact that his jeans were around his ankles. He tried to keep the balance, but by the seventh step he took, he fell down flatly on the floor.
“And I need to finish that before I start signing the papers,” Tony explained, a cocky smile appearing on his face.
But Tony wasn't paying attention to him, not yet. He kept sniffling and babbling something about Ted. Steve was still clueless about who or what that Ted was, so he just kept rocking him as he murmured reassuring words in his ear. It wasn’t until he paid attention to what Tony was clutching in his hands, that he understood what his partner was trying to say. Teddy bear. The only one he had. The one he was pretty sure Tony loved even if he said otherwise. And Steve couldn’t deny there was a stingy sensation in his chest, due to the fact that it was the one he had given him.
How was he supposed to handle a situation like this? The way both Tony and Clint had slipped into their headspaces hadn’t been precisely ideal, though Steve had actually imagined himself spending a nice afternoon with them. Who would have thought that after only an hour, he would be about to witness a double meltdown?
According to Phil, Tony had tried to get back to his normal headspace during all the time he looked after him, but once Steve was in charge, Tony had had no problems with staying little. Whether that had been due to having being sick or because Tony had wanted it that way, Steve didn’t know, though that didn’t change the fact that it had been the longest time and the littlest Tony had been in all the time they’d been age playing.
Phil seemed completely oblivious of the fact that Steve’s confused expression wasn’t caused by Phil not wanting him to make any noise, but by Clint himself. Or rather, by what Clint was wearing. A t-shirt and what was undoubtedly a diaper. Why on earth was Clint wearing a diaper?
Tony curled into a small ball, hoping that position relented the waves of pain his bladder was sending through his stomach. He was bursting to go to the bathroom, and after holding it for almost an hour, his full bladder was demanding for immediate release, but Tony refused to do it.
“No, you’re going to spill the water.” Steve refused, his mouth twitching. Nothing never turned out well when Little Clint demanded to do big-boy things, and Steve had learned that almost as soon as he had begun babysitting him. “Just finish your meal so we can go and play.”
“I’m sorry if I did something that made you believe I’m leaving you, I promise it wasn’t on purpose. And I mean what I said, I have no intention of breaking this relationship, neither as your boyfriend nor as your daddy, unless you–,”
Settling Tony had been a battle, so to speak. He had been too flustered to listen to reason, and even if Steve considered the fact that Tony had been deep into his Littlespace to be a positive development, he couldn’t help thinking everything would have been much easier if Tony had been in a different mindset.
Unfortunately, the timing couldn’t have been worse. Had it occurred a few weeks earlier, Tony might not have felt this disgruntled. He might have allowed himself to appreciate the effort Steve had made, to picture how it would feel to be put to bed in that crib that looked nothing but comfortable, to wake up in a room that transmitted an inexplicable sense of security, to have a place that would certainly help to make the experience more real.
Sorry for the late update. I've  been more than busy with work and I just couldn't get around to writing anything. Right now I just couldn't make myself work, and I needed a break, and here's the result. Sorry if it's too short.
“It is! It can be very relaxing, Phil and Clint do it and it seems to work for them, it seems to really help Clint deal with bad days,” he spilled out before he could stop himself, even covering his mouth with both hands, but it was already too late. That information wasn’t something he should shout to the four winds, Clint might have said he wouldn’t mind if someone found out about it, but he had said he’d rather they didn’t. How could he screw more things up when the thing he wanted to do was fix this misunderstanding?
“If you hadn’t been so concentrated on looking for the cookies I told you not to eat, you would’ve realized you wanted to go potty,” Steve scolded, though his tone of voice was anything but angry. Clint ignored him, still sobbing behind the cushion he was pressing against his face.
Due to their lifestyles, Steve and Tony spent too much time away from each other. They knew that would be something they would have to deal with when they started dating, and it hadn’t been much of an issue yet. If one day they felt like seeing the other and one of them was away, a video call solved the problem. Nevertheless, Tony was sure a call wouldn’t be enough for his little side. Steve seemed to be the world for his little counterpart, he craved for Steve’s cuddles, praises, care and attention, and the mere thought of falling into his littlespace without Steve being around gave Tony goosebumps.
Thank you so much for your comments and kudos, they truly make my day. I promise I'll try to update sooner this time.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked from the door, startling Tony a little. He felt his chest tightening more.
So now there he was, standing outside the elevator while trying to get rid of the trembling the nightmare and utterly exhaustion had caused, his hand hesitating whether to push a button or not. Tony was completely on the edge, all his energy drained due to excessive work, restless nights and starvation, but mostly, for forcing his Little side away. All Tony wanted to do was ride the elevator to Steve’s floor and let the man take care of him. But, at the same time, he wanted to go and hide in his workshop again, wait until this craving went away and feel proud for being able to control himself one more time. For making Steve lose.
Tony’s poor choices had screwed everything up, and now the problem wasn’t whether Tony was going to give Age Play another chance or not, but rather if Steve would take him back. Chances were he wouldn’t. Why would he? Tony had shown him how unreliable he was, how volatile. Steve might even kick him out of the team as a precaution. As the Captain, he couldn’t afford to have a team member who couldn’t play well with others, and since Clint hadn’t done anything wrong, Tony was the one who needed to go.
“Hey Tony, I was wondering if you would like to spar with me,” Steve asked as soon as he was in front of Tony. Needless to say they both froze immediately.
Why couldn't he stop being a Little? Why couldn't he be a Little without all the remorse that that endured?
And Tony didn’t know whether it was because Steve was taller and broader than him, or because of his current position, or because of the word Steve had just articulated, but all of a sudden, Tony felt incredibly small and unable to give verbal answers, so he just nodded shyly. Steve didn’t hesitate to hug him, and Tony couldn’t have been gladder for that, since he could literary feel his face turning red.
“Yes, you were. We were already a step from getting over with it, and you backed off for no reason at all. You would have left and you would have gotten very moody as you usually get whenever you start struggling against what you want,” Steve explained, pulling him closer and rubbing his tummy affectionately. “It would have gotten you more time, but eventually you would have ended up where we already were. I just wanted to save us some drama and get over it already.”
Every time Tony played, Steve couldn’t help noticing certain tension in him, as though he was uncomfortable. That tension eased a bit when Steve joined him, but Steve couldn’t help thinking there was something a bit odd in the way Tony interacted with the toys.
By now, Tony must have figured this pattern out and he hadn’t complained about it at all. When Steve had been a little hesitant to let him go to the bathroom days later after that particular night, Tony hadn't insisted any further. He had looked a bit distressed and ashamed, and he had waited until Steve left the room to retrieve a glass of water to use his diaper, but other than that, Tony hadn't showed any signs that indicated he had gotten mad whatsoever at the way Steve was handling things.
No, if things were good between them, it was better to leave them like they were, it wasn’t worthy to cause another fight for something Tony wasn’t even sure he was going to like. So, forgetting the whole situation would be the best thing to do.
Steve breathed another quiet sigh, mentally trying to cheer himself up. You had to hit rock bottom before you can bounce back up, right? He had to be optimistic and see the bright sight in all the tribulations they’d been through, after all, they’d provided him with a clearer idea of what Tony truly wanted.
It had been until the movie that Steve had gotten JARVIS to play sounded interesting enough that Tony decided to look at the screen in front of them. That had been the moment when Tony had seen the bottle laying all innocently on the coffee table, and after a little while, Steve had leaned over to reach for it.
Steve had loved it. And he had the feeling that Tony had too. Otherwise, how could anybody explain why Tony had looked so peaceful and relaxed once he went back to his adult mindset? He could have been upset, embarrassed, or regretful, but he never showed any of that.
A shame Steve wouldn’t dare to do such a thing just now, because Tony would surely consider it something too childish, and childish things were off the table now. Anything that could be remotely related to Age Play was. Tony had made himself very clear in that aspect, he wasn’t willing to give age playing a try, and Steve had to and was going to respect that, in spite of what he wanted.
“Shh, it’s okay sport, I’m done,” Steve announced, and Tony couldn’t help looking at him out of the corner of his eye. “C’mon kiddo, look at me. I’m not mad at you, it was just an accident,” he declared, caressing Clint’s abdomen affectionately.
"Just because," Tony said as he crossed his arms over his chest, pouting. Steve sighed loudly. That pout meant that Tony was in what Steve started to call "sulking mode", and when he was in sulking mode it was impossible to talk him out of it.
“I’m hungry,” Tony said. No matter how much he’d like to continue with the cuddles, his stomach had started to demand food a bit loudly. All the running from his workshop to the guest room had whetted his appetite.
Toys. Tony had gotten JARVIS to do an Internet search to find the best rated and most popular toys all over the world so that he could purchase them. Who would have imagined JARVIS would find that many? Board games, puzzles, action figures, video games, building sets, Tony thought he even saw a scooter at some point. Next time he would have to be more specific with the A.I., because, even if Tony appreciated the effort, getting that amount of toys just make his objective harder to achieve.
What really caught Tony’s attention were those LEGO toys. Without exaggerating, JARVIS had gotten him more than five thousand bricks in different sets. Tony had spread all of them on the floor in front of him and, with the help of the manuals that were in their packages, he had built an entire city, including police stations, hospitals, parks, office buildings, schools, and even an exact replica of his Tower. Tony was very satisfied with the result, he had even made the cars move by themselves in the streets. Certainly, no kid would have been able to do that. And that exact thought had been the one which made him feel disappointed.
“You gotta be kidding me!” Tony exclaimed when Steve took the book once more. “if you’re going to continue reading, why are you keeping me here?” he complained.
Wow, it took me forever to write one more chapter for this story. I don't know, I've been kind of busy, I was hooked with other to stories and I guess I wasn't really in a mood of writing lately.
Without any warning, Tony felt two hands on his sides, and before he could do anything but squeal in surprise, he found himself sitting sideways on Steve's lap, hands clutching to the fabric of his t-shirt just for the lack of having something else to do with them.
"Tony?" Steve called, startling him a little. "Hey, hey baby, it's okay," Steve soothed, placing a hand on his forearm. When had he gotten closer?
Pancakes for lunch wasn't exactly what Steve considered a proper meal, but after all the drama from an hour ago, Steve didn’t have it in him to deny Clint anything. When Clint told him he wanted pancakes instead of pizza, Steve felt he didn’t have any other choice but to agree. Making pancakes with Tony perched on his hip and Clint by his side all the time making sure he created the shapes he requested had
“You know it wasn’t your fault, don’t you?” Natasha asked, her face crinkling in annoyance. So much for being comforting only a few minutes ago. “These things tend to happen, it comes with the job.”
Tony started to blink more and more often. Perhaps if he closed his eyes just for a few seconds once in a while, Tony would cheat his body and make it believe he was already resting. He shut his eyes and opened them again after counting mentally to ten. Tony repeated this action for a while, eventually closing them more frequently and for more time without even realizing it. Needless to say it didn’t take much for him to totally doze off.
"So, I wondered how it was possible for such advertisement to show up here if I never visit such websites, and you certainly don't either. I thought to myself a virus must have been the responsible. I was even going to scold you for not being careful and visit every website the browser shows you whenever you do research," Tony continued relating, putting the tablet down on the couch when he made sure Steve had seen what he showed to him, "I went to the history to try to identify the website where the virus may have come from, and let me tell you, I found some very interesting sites."
Grabbing his teddy bear, Tony got out of the bed, and stayed right beside it. It had been a good idea indeed; he could feel he could actually do it this time. He pushed a bit, feeling confident, and he couldn’t help wincing at the sharp burning sensation it caused. He had been holding it for too long. Pulling his bear against his chest, he tried to relax. After a couple of minutes, a spurt of pee escaped without much of an effort, but Tony clamped down, mortified. It didn't last long, though. Before he knew it, pee began to come out unstoppably and soon a hot and wet sensation spread all over his crotch. Tony squeezed his eyes shut and curled his toes, groaning quietly when the ache in his lower regions were gone.
Restraining himself from putting Tony down on the changing table to get him ready and put him to bed as soon as possible, Steve walked slowly around the room, bouncing Tony a little with the intention of sending him further into dreamland.
When Steve turned around, carrying two plates with both of his hands, he sighed heavily as he looked that Tony’s chair was empty. Putting the plates on the table, he looked around in search of his stubborn partner, finding him in his way to the bathroom, was he really going to wash their hands for the first time by free will? He didn’t think so.
Steve pulled the covers up around his baby’s shoulders as carefully and quietly as possible, afraid he might wake up at the slightest movement or sound. Steve even refrained from putting up the drop-side of the crib just in case that disturbed his sleep as well. It wasn’t like Tony would fall out of the crib, and if by any chance something like that threatened to happen, Steve wouldn’t allow it, since he had no intention of living the room while his baby remained there.
Not the proposal Tony had in mind at all. Half an hour later, Tony found himself with a book on his lap and a sleeping Steve next to him.
Playing with Legos and watching Disney movies, that would do. Tony even allowed himself to suck on a pacifier while he built an entire city out of Legos –JARVIS had really shown off its ability to find and purchase the most awesome toys online. Tony had been so immersed in his play, that he never heard neither the doors of the elevator opening nor the footsteps that approached the living room where he was. To be fair, Tony couldn’t be mad at anybody for this. Not even JARVIS, because being sure nobody was going to be in the Tower, he hadn’t even bothered to ask the A.I. not to let anyone in. And he didn’t even have to, not really, since nobody used to walk into his personal living room.
Natasha picked up the movie this time. A spy movie. She actually didn't like them, but Clint and she did like to point out all the mistakes and unreal things that happened in them. Thor was just happy to see whatever everybody else was watching and Bruce stayed there even if he preferred to sit down on a corner a little far from them and read a book. Tony thought about excusing himself and go to his room, but Steve nudged him discreetly towards the couch when he noticed Tony’s intension. He didn’t even think about complaining, after all, the movie might give him an idea of how to sneak out. Hope springs eternal.
That, and the reassuring hand rubbing circles down his back, helped to ease the anxiety, but not completely. Tony was sure his lungs temporarily forgot how to do their job correctly while Steve passed the living room on his way to the kitchen.
“Hold tight, honey, daddy’s gonna get the supplies,” Steve asked once he had put Tony down on their bed, patting his left tight affectionately. By the time he made it back to the bed, Tony’s face was lost behind a pillow. If Steve had thought nothing could embarrass Tony more than being diapered, he had been mistaken. Being changed out of a wet diaper could totally make him reach a higher level of embarrassment.
“Hey, no Tony, no climbing out,” Steve warned as he approached him, scooping him up and balancing him out with ease.
Tony huffed as he sprawled out on his back on the floor, staring blankly at the roof. Why couldn't he do things correctly?
Taking him more time than it usually did, Tony reached the door. The feeling that he was doing something he wasn’t supposed to accompanied him while he walked down the hall, which was stupid. It was his room, it was his floor, it was his Tower, so he could do as he pleased. And if Tony wasn’t supposed to leave a room without notifying Steve, well, then Steve should have been there when he awoke.
“C’mon, you can’t sleep here, the couch isn’t that comfortable,” Steve lied, it’s was more than obvious that Tony had furnished all the Tower with the finest and most comfortable furniture on Earth, but there was no way Steve would let him sleep there.
“I know this is difficult for you, so I won’t insist, at least for now. But I do mean it, I’m more than willing to help you, Tony. Whenever you’re ready, come and look for me.” After saying this, Steve stood up and left the room, not wanting to push the matter any further and make Tony more uncomfortable than he evidently already was.
“Why?” Steve questioned again, as he wondered if Tony realized how childish he acted whenever he got mad.
“Unless you tell me you like to wear tutus when you’re alone in order to relax, I have no intention of talking about this any further,” Tony pointed out, causing Steve to chuckle a little.
"So, all your gestures and coddles weren't a way to make me get interested in this Age Play thing?" Tony asked, glaring at him.
If there was ever a complaint about all this, Steve could definitely blame it on Tony. Because if Tony had agreed to spar with him when he asked, instead of staying in his workshop working on some upgrades he could have easily left for later, Steve would have never gone to Clint’s floor, looking for somebody to train with.
“About the age play,” Phil said, and Steve couldn’t help feeling a bit annoyed. The more Phil said, the less he understood. He shook his head. “Man, I thought you knew, I mean, you two spending a lot of time together and everything. I thought he had mentioned it or something,” he babbled, clearly mortified, “And even if he hadn’t commented you anything, he isn’t precisely discreet about it, you know, sometimes his behavior goes further than just being a man child, I thought you had figured it out by now or at least I thought you had an idea of it. I mean, you’re here, he knows you come and go as you like, he would’ve asked JARVIS not to let anyone in whenever he was little if you hadn’t already known and he didn’t want you to find out,” he declared, speaking tensely and faster than usual.
At first, Steve thought it was all in his head, a product of his imagination, after all, Clint did enter the nursery even if it was only to drag the chest of his favorite toys out of the room, not wanting to spend more time than necessary in there. He could perfectly be the one who was leaving things misplaced, he had never been an organized person, and it was always hard to get him to clean up after playing. Steve had had to take him back into the nursery several times in order to make sure he put everything away properly, since Clint tended to throw things and run out in his haste to move on to the next activity, whatever it was.
“No, I’m not,” Steve assured, bringing Clint closer to his chest. “But it’d be nice if you listened to me when I warned you about something.”
Second, well, I guess I'm still keeping it slow, but I do think Tony needs time to come to terms wih everything. Steve would surely keep encouraging him, and pushing him to go beyond his comfort zone, but not that drastically.
A wild pink color washed into Tony's cheeks as he leaned over and clasped the front part of the onesie. Steve bit his lips in order to hold back a grin, though he was certain he might not be doing a good job.
“Tony!” Steve scolded when he saw that the thing that had hit him had been the sippy cup. “Why did you hurl that at me?”
Tony felt how the blood drained from his face as his breathing suddenly speeded up. He had already used the diaper, without even realizing it. This was far the first time he had had an accident, so he shouldn’t be freaking out like that, but the heart of the matter was that Steve will find out, and Tony was sure as hell Steve would try to change him, and that, that was something Tony wouldn’t allow under no circumstances. Thus, he couldn’t panic right now. Tony needed to climb out first, leave the room before Steve showed up and hide, he would have plenty of time to freak out later.
Phil sighed before proceeding with a concern tone of voice, “look, I didn’t want to bother you with this, but I don’t really have an option. Clint’s feeling Little and a bit upset. I’ve been talking to him and I managed to calm him down enough for him to take a nap, but I’m afraid he’s going to continue feeling Little when he wakes up and I’m going on a mission now, so he won’t be able to reach me.”
However, wanting Steve’s complete attention had nothing to be with being embarrassed. Jealously? That could be a reason, since the beginning Tony had shown certain reluctance to let Steve go with Clint when he was little, so it would make total sense if Tony was jealous of Clint. And if that was the case, Steve needed to clear things up.
Steve made shushing sounds while he got off the bed as carefully as he could, the less the mattress moved the higher the chances of Tony not waking up would be. He was a light sleeper, and after all the sleepless nights he had had, the least Steve wanted was waking him up. Tony stirred a little when Steve covered him up with a sheet, but his eyes never cracked open.
“Natasha’s waiting for you outside, she’s flying you back home,” Phil informed after he settled into the chair that was next to the bed.
"Seriously? JARVIS! Stop ratting on me!" Tony ordered, glaring at the roof. Steve chuckled. "What's so funny?"
There it was, he’d finally said it, without beating around the bush. He’d taken the first step, and even if it was somehow relieving, anxiety and uneasiness refused to disappear. His hands got more restless, so he began rubbing his sweaty palms against his pant legs, trying to even his erratic breathing.
“I… no-nothing.” Tony stuttered, realizing how futile this was. He turned around and walked a few steps away, but Steve was faster and placed himself in front of Tony to stop him from leaving.
Even though Raawry never left the crib – something Steve made sure of, as Tony’s little side had been especially fond of it – Steve couldn’t help noting the soft toy was positioned differently every time he entered the nursery; and unless it had been possessed by some spirit like it happened in those movies Clint had made him watch during movie nights, the only explanation there was for that was someone must have been moving it. It wasn’t like Steve found Raawry on one corner of the crib one day, and on the opposite the next day, it was more like it was a half-inch to the right or to the left where it had previously been, or its face was slightly pointed to a different direction, or it was leaning more on the pillow than before, as if somebody had tried to place it exactly like it had been but failed.
But then the fourth time happened, and Tony was right where he had started. There had been no nightmares, no battles, no Expos, nothing that could be considered stressful. Tony had been chilling out in their living room, drinking some coffee and catching up with the world through his tablet, delighted by the fact that he had a free afternoon – no deadlines to meet, no meetings to attend, no recovery from sleep deprivation to do, not even maintenance of his suit. He had literally nothing to do, something that happened once every leap year. And all of a sudden, Tony had felt how he began to sink into his littlespace.
“I don’t want you to be bigger, I enjoy taking care of my sweet little baby,” Steve claimed, tightening his embrace. “I love carrying you around, bathing you, feeding you, cuddling you. Those are things I can’t do with Clint, and it’s okay, because I’m not Clint’s daddy, he has his own daddy, I’m
, just indicated Phil that he was trying to get back to his normal headspace, which mortified him more. According to what Clint had told him, being caught between two headspaces wasn’t fun.
“Take it easy, there’s nobody but us,” Steve soothed when Tony’s gasped. Steve had opened the door of their room and was heading outside. Tony was going into the kitchen wearing just a t-shirt and a diaper. If somebody saw them, there would be nothing he could invent to explain his current attire without having to admit this was something related to Age Play. “And I asked JARVIS not to let anyone in without authorization,” Steve assured.
Steve followed Clint, out of the corner of his eye, in his way to the counter where the box of pizza lay. Clint opened it and stared at it with a thoughtful expression on his face, scratching his chin. Surely, he was trying to decide which slice was the biggest one. Perhaps Steve should have gone and serve the other slice himself.
“Really, Tony, really?!” OK, now he was really starting to get angry. He was tired, he was hungry, he just wanted to have some dinner, take a shower and sleep. Was that too much to ask for?
“Oh my God Steve, would you please tell me what’s this all about? I agreed to come here without telling me what for, but you’re taking forever,” Tony exclaimed, exasperated.
“Of course,” Steve agreed without hesitating, though he wondered why Clint would ask for such a thing when it was Tony the one who paid for all their food.
There was no way Tony thought he might have been mistaken. There was no way Tony wanted all those things back. That couldn’t be.
"Why the hell would you want to help me?! Why the hell would you like to get involved in something like this?!" Tony rubbed his temples, a headache was starting to build up due to not being able to really understand the man in front of him.
Tony turned a little bit and reached a pillow that was next to him, hugging it and burying himself deeper into the fleecy blanket, which was incredibly comfortable – did he own a fleecy blanket? Right now he couldn’t remember. He moved a couple of times more in order to find the best position to let himself fall into unconsciousness again, and cursed when his foot hit one of the bars. Damn bars, why were they so close to him? When Tony woke up again, the first thing he’d do would be getting himself another bed, one whose bars weren’t that close to the edge and wouldn’t be on the way when he tried to move and stretch.
Tony wanted to tell Steve to mind his own business and get away from him as fast as possible. He wanted to kick his ass for unsettling him like this, for making him want to do something like this, for giving him the hope of having something he had already come to terms with never being able to get. Tony wanted to beat Steve for sticking his nose in this matter, for finding a way to meddle in his life. But most of all, Tony wanted to throw his arms around him and ask him for comfort, he wanted to let Steve take care of him.
"OK Tony, if that's what you want, I will," Steve said as he left the room, leaving Tony with a nasty taste in his mouth.
daddy, and he didn’t want him to baby anyone but him. It was stupid and illogical, but Tony couldn't bring himself to care right now.
An idea, it always started with an idea. Every time Tony got an idea, no matter how small or brief it seemed to be, it usually ended up taking over his brain, impossible to eradicate, slowly developing until it was fully formed and was there to stay.
For the last days, Steve had been looking on the Internet for the perfect items to finish furnishing the room, and with the help of JARVIS, he had placed the order. To his amazement, everything had arrived in just a day, and Steve had waited for Tony to leave the tower to go to a meeting to start putting everything together, wanting to be a surprise for him. He was looking forward to seeing Tony’s expression when he saw his new nursery, he would surely love it.
“I need to go to the bathroom,” Tony blurted slurringly, straightening up so fast that Steve barely had time to tighten his grip on his waist.
“Of course you do! The prefect Captain America can’t have anything out of the ordinary!” Tony snorted, folding his arms over his chest.
Clint tensed up when Steve moved closer to the bed, but his distress had been such that he practically jumped on him when Steve sat down on the bed, clutching his t-shirt and pressing his face against his chest.
“Oh, I see,” Clint said, hands fidgeting nervously, “maybe we can watch a movie while he sleeps, I’ll be quiet,” he promised, an expression on his face indicating how much he wanted Steve to agree. “Phil’s not here, and I-I’m feeling little,” he confessed with a tiny voice, an ashamed blush sweeping up his face. Steve pursed his lips.
“No,” Tony denied one more time, though Steve could tell by the way his voice sounded that he was more awake.
Tony looked down at the paper he was signing – when had he started staring into space? – and groaned loudly when he saw three of his signatures at the bottom. How on earth had that happened
“No, I CAN’T! I have to finish this now. It’s my job, or you think everything you see here, everything the team uses, everything you use is paid magically?! Of course not, I pay for everything with the money I get from my company which happens to sell the things I do here. So, leave me the fuck alone once and for all! DON’T I KNOW WHEN TO STOP!”, his fists hit the desk in order to emphasize the last sentence.
Steve had been a bit hesitant at the beginning whether he should go this far or not. Tony hadn’t exactly been thrilled when he turned the room into a playroom, and Steve was afraid Tony would refuse to go inside if the room got more childish. But after the events from a couple of weeks ago, Steve thought there wouldn’t be any problem now.
Thus, in one of those rare afternoons where he had nothing to do and no one to hang out with, Steve went to the nursery with the intention of cleaning and tidying up, as well as deciding what things to keep and what things to get rid of.
“We have a pretty little shy baby here, don’t we?” Steve had commented fondly as he returned to his place, sitting next to him. When it had been quite obvious that Tony wouldn’t be lured out of hiding this time, Steve had lifted him and placed him on his lap, where Tony had hidden his face against chest.
It took him around an hour to calm him down. And it was mostly because Tony got run down from all the crying and ended up falling asleep in his lap. Steve stayed right there for several minutes longer, afraid that Tony would wake up if he moved an inch. He didn’t mind, though. He loved it when Tony fell asleep like that, allowing him to look at the peaceful expression, which he usually wore after throwing a huge tantrum.
The problem arose when Tony's schedule cleared up a little, because then he had time to think and realize how high his stress level had gotten over the last three weeks and how nice it would be to have a 'little' break.
Despite his stubbornness, Tony had to admit that the captain was a freaking genius in his own way. Steve had given him everything he had always desired but never dared to get or ask for, and now he had taken everything away, leaving Tony with a sensation of emptiness. Truthfully, Tony had been the one who had asked Steve to stop doing what he was doing, but that wasn’t the point here. The point was that this whole situation was pushing Tony to the verge, he longed for Steve’s attention and care, and the absence of it was making his mind unstable, making it difficult to stay in his adult mindset.
“Daddy’s going to get you out of the crib, sweetheart,” Steve announced as he stood up, slid his hands under Tony’s armpits and lifted him up. It’d already been established his baby didn’t mind being carried or manhandled, though Steve was adamant to show him that nothing was final, that he’d always have the chance to choose differently if he wished.
A much bigger surprise when Tony had allowed him to be in charge of everything taking into consideration his intolerance of uncertainty. And Steve was totally taken aback when Tony played along with everything Steve suggested.
Both of them were fast asleep on the couch in Clint’s living room. Steve was leaning on the back of the couch with his head hanging down in a way that Tony knew he was going to regret it in the morning, while Clint was curled on Steve’s lap against his chest, a hand clutched to Steve’s t-shirt. Without being able to take his eyes off the screen, Tony flopped down on his bed, his mind a complete mess.
“Not anymore,” Clint announced, pouting when Steve moved the sippy cup closer to him once more. “I want a glass,” he repeated, and he slouched in his chair. If Steve wasn’t going to allow Clint to keep the sippy cup away from him, then he was going to keep himself away from it.
And, if by any chance that was not enough to absolve himself from any blame, Steve could also argue that if Tony hadn’t given him full access to the Tower, he would have never stepped into Clint’s living room without knocking or giving him a heads up.
Steve might not know how to bring up the topic with Tony yet, but he was convinced now that ‘as soon as possible’ was the time to do it.
Before dinner, Steve managed to get Tony to carry on with the task of selecting the stuff he wished to keep, and by the time it was time to go to bed, Steve could proudly say his baby had finally accomplished it.
Tony, which was even worse. It was true that Phil had done everything he could to look after him, however, Steve knew – and little Tony left that clear – that the only person Tony wanted taking care of him when he was little was Steve. Perhaps in the future Tony would be comfortable around another ‘adult’, but not for the time being.
Nonetheless, Tony would never say it’d been Steve’s fault, or that they both shared the blame, because the one who was stuck in medical right now was Steve and not him.
“That’s not an excuse, and it just worsens this situation,” Tony stated before turning around once more and leaving the room.
conversation. In a way, he would prefer just to go straight to the practice and skip the awkward chat, but he knew that would never happen. Steve liked to talk things out so they both were in the same page and there weren’t any misunderstandings – something Steve should have done when all this started, but OK, that topic was already forgotten.
“As I was saying, I don’t think what Howard made you believe was right. There’s nothing wrong with this. And I meant what I said, I do want to help you, Tony. I want to make you understand this is totally fine. I hope you let me help you.”
“No problem, Cap,” Bruce said, pulling his torn pants so they wouldn’t fall down. Seriously, where were his spare clothes?
Not waiting for an answer, Steve stood up, pulling Tony up with him and leading him outside the room. Tony just let himself being pushed, too focused on the pain of his hand to be able to refute. It really hurt.
By the time Tony finished reading the last one, he was too tired and too hungry to go back to his workshop. So, he opted to rest for a while and have something to eat before resuming work. Steve would arrive soon and he would surely bring some food with him.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?! Let go the fuck of me!” Tony said, kicking his legs, almost knocking over the table. Steve breathed heavily once more.
Getting the feeling he wasn’t supposed to be there, Steve thought about turning around and leaving. But the stupefaction apparently messed up his brain and made it send wrong messages to his body, because instead of leaving, Steve went deep into the living room, standing a few inches in front of them.
“Phil, I have no idea of what you’re talking about or what all this is about,” Steve assured, taking a few steps towards the armchair and sitting down on it. Suddenly, standing up there without doing anything seemed just off.
That thought made Steve feel awfully uneasy. Tony had claimed he wanted to have nothing to do with Age Play anymore and Steve had chosen to respect his decision after seeing how determined Tony was. But what if Tony wasn’t? What if Tony didn’t really want to quit age playing? What if Tony had been struggling with that and Steve hadn’t noticed because he’d stayed away in order to give him some space? What if Steve had been neglecting his baby?
Phil pressed a kiss against Clint's forehead before heading to the closet, his mind already trying to figure out what the best way to coax Tony out of there would be. He would need to be very careful if he didn't want to scare Tony away. According to Steve, Tony was still struggling with all the age play thing, so it was highly probable that Tony wouldn’t be thrilled to be around an adult who wasn’t his daddy.
Perhaps because the one who Tony wanted right now was daddy, not Steve. Daddy would scoop him up, rock him, and take turns between whispering reassurances in his ears and kissing him on the side of his head until Tony calmed down. Tony couldn’t really explain why, but he was sure that was exactly what he needed right now.
, a little voice in his head said, and Tony knew exactly what it meant. Tony had never stopped wanting to be Steve’s baby. Logic and caution had told him to get away from that sort of relationship before it was too late, before everything went downhill, but some part of him wished to continue even though things turned out badly. Not for nothing it had been impossible for him to keep himself away from anything related to Age Play, to stopped missing Daddy even when he had Steve around.
"N-not li-little," Clint argued, making Steve sigh. Clint might be into Age Play, though there were some times in which he didn't like feeling little and he tried to remain “big” – as Clint’s little self referred to his adult self. Especially when Phil wasn't around.
But Tony doubted his patience would be everlasting, and maybe this would be the last straw. Perhaps this would finally drive him up the wall and make him back off. What would he do if that happened? How would he handle this situation on his own? Because he may hate when Steve insisted on Tony letting himself be Little when he hadn’t been for a long time, but at the end of the day he was always grateful for that.
"Let's go then," Steve suggested. He turned around after holding Tony's hand and walked towards the elevator.
“Daddyyyy,” Tony whined in apparent misery. Steve huffed, his lips sewn into a grimace, knowing exactly what Tony’s aim was.
“I’m not saying you are, but won’t you feel better if you knew that, even if you had one, you’ll stay dry and clean?” Clint shook his head once more, “I promise to take it off if you wanna go potty,” Steve persisted.
Tony found himself one night, tossing and turning unable to fall sleep, his mind stubbornly reminding him of the crib that was just a few meters away from his room, telling him how easy it would be for him to get up and walk over the nursery, assuring him nobody would catch him as Steve, as well as Clint and Phil, were going to be on a mission for the next couple of days. “Ah! This is stupid!” he grunted against the pillow, minutes before kicking off the sheets, getting out of bed, and heading to the nursery.
Tony felt a tingling sensation on his stomach when Steve placed a hand on it that made him jump a little, but soon it turned into a soothing caress as Steve began to rub his thumb around his belly button, clearly being careful not to tickle him. That was good, the last thing Tony wanted right now was Steve to start blowing raspberries on his abdomen.
Apparently, that had been the right thing to say, because, all of a sudden, Tony pushed the pillow away and threw himself to his arms, clinging to him almost desperately. It hurt, the broken ribs and scratches were still there, but it was nothing Steve couldn’t bear, so he remained quiet and let himself melt into the hug as much as Tony was. God, Steve had sure missed this!
Why the hell did the Board want an updated version of his StarkPhone? The one that had been released just a couple of months before was more than perfect. A StarkPhone Plus? Really? Were they freaking kidding him? Greedy old bastards, they just wanted more money and didn’t care if the customers were already satisfied with their phones. Seriously, they just wanted a version with a larger screen. What a…?! A larger screen? Even if they knew how bad the critical response was when other companies did the same with their products? He just couldn’t let his company take that road. He had to add something more than a larger screen to this freaking plus version so its purchase was worthy.
Rearranging the pillows behind him, Tony looked for a more comfortable position and focused on the browser he had just opened, trying to keep his mind occupied so he wouldn’t fall asleep. He might not want to go back to work yet, but he did need to finish some things before going to bed today. The newest technological advances was the topic he usually liked to read online, and today was not different. Seeing how some of the latest creations were far behind his gave him some kind of pleasure.
It had taken Tony an embarrassing amount of time to calm down. Steve had ended up sitting down on their bed, where they currently continued, Tony curled on Steve’s lap, the trail of tears still fresh on his cheeks. Tony’s mind was still a mess, trying to understand what had just happened but getting distracted by Steve’s caresses.
Tony had been drunk the first time he had slept there, otherwise, there had been no way he would have climbed into the crib in his right mind.
“Go ahead then, daddy will change you later,” Steve conceded, and he had to bite his lip to hold back a smile when Tony looked down at his crotch with eyes wide open as if he had forgotten – or maybe he hadn’t even realized – that he was wearing a diaper. A miserable groan escaped from deep within his throat, and Steve couldn’t help chuckling this time.
Besides, what was the worst thing that could happened? That Steve ran into Clint and Phil while they were making out on the couch? That wasn’t a big deal, especially since both of them had caught him and Tony doing the same thing several times.
“C’mon, is that all you’ve got?” Steve teased, resisting the urge to chuckle when a huge moue appeared on Clint’s face. Did he use to pout before? Steve had no idea. Maybe he did and Steve just didn’t realize it, his perspective had truly changed after he found out Clint was into Age Play.
Steve’s knees felt shaky when he focused his eyes on the screen and saw what looked like a porn website – he had the misfortune of being able to recognize them pretty well – but not a normal one, but one whose theme was undoubtedly related to Age Play, as the girls on the main page were wearing childish attires as well as diapers. Hadn’t he closed all the windows he opened when he was looking for the information he wanted to share with Tony? He was pretty sure he had.
It started with very simple things. Steve paid more attention to Tony. Smiling every time they exchanged glances. Praising him for all the little improvements Tony made on their suits or weapons. Patting him on the shoulder or back whenever he could. Seeming truly interested in every aspect of his life, even if it was something related to his company or his creations, things Tony was sure Steve couldn’t really understand due to everything he had missed to learn for taking a very long nap.
"I want more," Clint asked, handing him the now empty plate. Steve huffed in amusement, Clint’s had ketchup stains all around his mouth and front part of his t-shirt. How did he always managed to get that dirty when he ate? Steve had no idea.
No, Tony needed to put an end to this. That nursery had showed him Steve was willing to go further into a territory Tony didn’t want to risk stepping in. If he let this continue, going down into that headspace could stop being something he did at will; his little self could get more attached to Steve – and vice versa – and the separation would be worse. Tony couldn’t allow his reasoning be blinded by how good and fulfilling it was when he was Little and Steve was around.
Tony could accept that – dealing with feelings had never been his forte – but what he couldn't accept was the reason why he had felt so bad, why he had had the need to cry as pitifully as he had cried. That reason was what he had disliked the most of the whole experience. That reason had made him feel incredibly stupid and ashamed. That reason was what had made him feel terrified. And it didn’t matter how much Tony mulled over it, he just couldn’t accept it as a valid cause.
“Why don’t you stay like that?” Phil proposed, “There’s nobody in the tower but us and Clint, you don’t have to worry about someone seeing you. Clint is wearing one two,” he added, as if that would make Tony more comfortable.
“Is it here yet?!” Clint asked with a huge grin on his face, pout completely gone. Steve raised a questioning eyebrow at him while he lifted Tony from the counter and held him in his arms once more, enjoying the way Tony latched to him immediately. “Is it?”
Unfortunately, to that day, Steve was still clueless about that much-needed reason. Whenever Steve had brought up the topic, Tony had literally shut him out. His level of anger began to increase every time Steve ignored his petition of not discussing that topic anymore, until one day he got so mad he stopped talking to him for a whole month. Steve might have wanted to have Little Tony back, but that didn’t mean he was willing to lose Adult Tony, so he eventually had to let it go.
And what to say about bedtime? No matter what, Steve always managed to run into Tony whenever it was time to go to bed, a glass of warm milk always held in his hand. There was even a time when Steve went to his workshop almost at midnight, Tony had been a little bit upset when Steve had asked him to stop working because it was way passed bedtime. But Steve hadn’t left even if Tony had angrily ordered him to. Contrary to that, Steve had sat down on the couch in front of Tony and started to chitchat about something that turned into an unusual fairytale a while later. Tony wasn’t sure about this, though. When Steve began to tell him about HYDRA and dragons, he was already dozing off. Tony woke up on the couch the next day, a blanket wrapped around him, with no memories of how he had gotten there at all.
“And you have a thing for getting away from me,” Steve said, shifting a bit and pushing the pillows behind him into a better position, so he could lean on them more comfortably and in turn, pull Tony closer until he was leaning on his chest, still imprisoned between his arms.
Tony squirmed a bit nervously as his cheeks grew faintly pink. Steve wondered what thought had made him react that way.
The good thing was that, in spite of little Clint’s stubborn and mischievous personality, Phil had never had to get physical trying to keep him in line. Thus, when Phil held his hand and pulled him towards the elevator, Clint only whined and complained about how unfair he was being, but he didn’t try to resist.
"No, you're not. Why did you say no? What did you mean?" Steel kept questioning, walking back to the bed and stopping right in front of him.
"I said I don't want to!" Tony spitted out just as his back came up against the wall, becoming aware of the fact that he wouldn’t be able to step further away.
In the end, it kind of worked for his father. He got what he wanted, because Tony thoroughly repressed his Little side. He never got his hands on diapers, pull-ups, or any other of the things he wanted again. Every time he felt his mind slipping into that headspace, he forced himself to stay out of it. Yes, Howard achieved his goal to make Tony believe this part of him was wrong, incorrect, disgusting. But one thing was for certain: repressing and getting rid of it were two totally different things.
To ease the vast burden all that was causing on his conscience, Tony never looked the footage for more than five seconds. He knew that didn’t exonerate him from the guilt, what he was doing was undoubtedly incorrect, but that somehow reaffirmed his excuse of being doing this solely because that was the only way his own mind wouldn’t drive him crazy.
"No! I don't wanna wear that! It's for babies and I'm a big boy!" Clint complained as he managed to dodge Steve again. How was Clint doing that while laying right in front of him? Steve had no idea. Perhaps he was being way too careful afraid he might hurt him again, or maybe his movements were a bit restricted by Tony, who was standing right behind him, hand stubbornly clutched at his t-shirt.
For the next few minutes everything remained quiet, and only the sound of their mixed breathing disturbed the silence. A sporadic fidgeting indicated Steve that Tony was feeling anxious, but that was to be expected. Undoubtedly, Tony was trying to figure out a way to get out of this conversation, and realizing Steve wouldn’t allow that to happen made him restless. At least he hadn’t attempted to run away, and Steve took that as an improvement; so if Tony needed more time to get it into his head that the only way for them to leave this room was solving this issue first, well, Steve had no problem with waiting.
It had been a long month, and the fact that he’d been injured hadn’t had nothing to do with that. Steve had finally gotten his baby back, and it’d been a bittersweet irony to not being able to interact with him at will as he’d been used to, especially when it was clear Tony was craving for it too.
“No, of course I do! It’s quite comforting to wake up in the middle of the night and hear you snoring from the other side of the bed,” Steve said seriously, but the smile making itself known in the corners of his mouth let Tony know he was mocking him. He roared with laughter when another pillow was thrown at him.
After a few more minutes, Steve’s insistence paid off. Tony began stirring, unconsciously leaning into the touch of his hand – Steve loved that – as he slowly came awake. His eyes blinked open, and for a moment he stared at Steve without really seeing him, his eyelashes fluttering several times more before he became aware of his surroundings.
If this was something Clint wanted to keep between him and Phil, Steve had no problem with that. The less involved he was, the blurrier that mental picture with his and Tony’s faces would turn.
However, that tendency stopped when Tony started dating Steve. The first time Steve caught him hiding in his workshop not wanting anyone to find out he was running a fever which seemed to worsen by the minute, Steve had literally dragged Tony out of there and into their room, and spent all day applying cold compresses over his forehead in an attempt to reduce his fever. The time Tony had gotten a terrible flu, Steve had made sure he stayed in bed until he was completely recovered and he had cooked chicken soup for him, entertained him when Tony was bored out of his mind and even helped him to blow his nose (okay, Tony should have seen a pattern there, he should have realized Steve began babying him long before they started age playing).
“I don’t know what to do,” Tony confessed with a tiny voice, looking away. He couldn’t look at Steve in the eyes, not when he was sure his face was as red as a tomato. He had colored up as soon as Steve had brought up the topic.
“Tony, I read the instructions on the package, but I’m not quite sure I got them right, and if you keep moving I won’t be able to diaper you, so please, stop this already,” Steve said without being able to disguise the frustration in his voice. He tried to turn Tony around, who had fallen on his stomach when he was dragged.
“Come on Clint, get up here, there’s plenty of space.” Steve said, patting the empty spot in the bed next to him.
“If you’re making such a fuss over a teddy bear, I don’t even want to imagine how you would’ve reacted if I’d bought you flowers.” Tony couldn’t refute that comment in the slightest, “And it wouldn’t have been very congruent if I’d given you chocolates when I’m always telling you to eat healthily. Besides, you liked the teddy bear, didn’t you? You even slept hugging it,” Steve commented.
If adult Tony was reluctant to take medication, little Tony proved to be much worse in that aspect. No matter how much Phil insisted, asked, begged, threatened, blackmailed or tricked, Tony wouldn’t agree to take ibuprofen. Phil had to crush the pill and dissolve it in water to get Tony to take it. Everything would have been okay after that if Tony hadn't refused to drink from anything that wasn't a glass, and if Clint hadn't picked that exact moment to kick his legs in annoyance because Phil had stopped reading the book.
“He’s okay,” Natasha reassured, tenderness uncharacteristically tinging her voice, “even if he broke all of his bones, I’m pretty sure he’ll be good as new in a couple of days.” Tony stopped pacing to look at her, eyes wide open in horror. “You know what I mean.”
daddy, and I love having you as my baby,” he emphasized, and he could feel Tony’s hands clutching his shirt. “So, don’t say that I prefer spending time with Clint or that you’re boring, because that’s not true. If the only thing you want to do all afternoon is to be rocked by me, I’m perfectly happy to do that. Remember I wanted to give this a try not only because I liked it, but because I really thought this was going to be beneficial for you too,” he assured, smiling when Tony snuggled closer to him. “And because I do want this to be a two-way street, if you don’t feel comfortable being my baby and you think you’ll feel more comfortable being a bit older, you can tell me, I wouldn’t mind.”
So, Steve just wanted to soak in the moment. He just wanted to keep holding Tony against his chest and enjoy how his baby melted into the embrace as though this was something genuinely longed for, how his baby nuzzled like a kitten into the comforting warmth, how his baby squirmed happily when he pressed kisses to the top of his head and how his baby smiled shyly when he whispered into his ear how much he’d missed him and loved him.
It had been a surprise, actually. Steve was definitely not expecting Tony to use his diapers anytime soon, especially not when he was clearly struggling with things Steve considered sort of trivial and easier to accomplish, like calling him ‘daddy’ or playing with toys. Therefore, waking up and finding Tony with a soaked diaper that night had taken Steve by complete surprise. A pleasant surprise. Tony was trying very hard to make this work, and Steve couldn’t be happier.
The rest of the afternoon was uneventful. Tony seemed perfectly fine with doing nothing but relax and Steve couldn’t really say he disliked the idea. He’d planned numerous activities to keep his baby entertained and spend some quality time they both needed and deserved after all the ups and downs they’d been through – things that went from coloring to making some pretty cool craft projects which JARVIS had helped him to find on the Internet – but his baby hadn’t been so thrilled when faced with those proposals, and snuggling on his lap as they watched a movie in the living room ended up being what he preferred to do.
“Come here, baby boy,” Steve said as he lifted Tony from the bed enough to place him comfortably on his lap, ignoring the groans of protest Tony emitted when Steve took the pillow away from his face. “How does this baby boy plan on drinking his bottle if his pretty mouth is hidden behind a pillow?” he crooned, kissing his nose. Tony groaned once more, but he snuggled into Steve instead of trying to get the pillow back. “You’re such a good boy, Daddy’s very proud of you,” he praised after retrieving the bottle from the nightstand and offering up the nipple which Tony latched on without hesitation.
“OK, that’s enough! Steve has no say in those things,” Phil said before Steve could agree. Steve was willing to do anything to refrain Clint from getting mad at him, with Tony was enough. “He might babysit you sometimes, but he’s not the one who has to deal with a fussy toddler when you haven’t slept or eaten correctly or when you’ve had an accident,” Phil scolded, and his glare deepened when Clint stick his tongue out at him.
Steve couldn’t help chuckling. He liked this, he liked how light the atmosphere was around Phil and Clint, and how both of them didn’t care to show their daddy and little side even when they weren’t age playing. It showed how comfortable they were with each other, how stable their relationship was. How awful it would have been if they had kicked him out of it. How painful it would be if Tony and him never reached that level, because it would have been all his fault.
Steve went straight to the nursery. In case of causing a bigger issue, the A.I. hesitated to give him access to that room when Tony was taken there against his will – something that Steve would never try to do again, twice had been more than enough, thank you very much – otherwise JARVIS didn’t even ask him to identify himself anymore to be able to get in.
"Of course you’re not, you’re a big boy, Uncle Steve’s just being silly," Steve said condescendingly. "Let me take a look where I hit you," he asked. Clint shook his head, but he allowed Steve to rearrange the two of them until Steve ended up sitting down on the floor and Clint on his lap.
In this time of the year, people tended to get sick due to the sudden temperature changes, so it was almost impossible not to catch something. It was true that the number of people who Tony interacted with on a daily basis was limited, and that was why he hardly ever got sick, but last week he had been on a business trip with Pepper, and he surely had come into contact with a lot of people. Pepper had called in sick a couple of days ago, and Tony was afraid he would have to do the same very soon. Figuratively, of course, because if he actually called his company to let them know he wasn’t going to go to work, he would cause a lot of confusion.
Tony shook his head as if that would help him to get rid of those thoughts. He was giving this matter a lot of thought, which only stressed him and that was exactly what he had promised Steve he wouldn’t do. Besides, even if Steve wouldn’t hesitate to go all out for him, he was also the kind of guy who liked to keep things simple, so he might not have done any of the extravagant things Tony was imagining him doing. Steve might have as well planned something more mundane like watching a movie together, so Tony was getting all distressed for nothing.
With hesitant movements, Tony placed a hand on the door knob and twisted it open very slowly, still a bit reluctant to go inside. As expected, Steve was sitting on the bed, and Tony felt his heart beating with a mixture of apprehension and indignation, experiencing a sudden worsening in mood. It would have been a normal reaction – seeing Steve’s heavily bandaged upper body, scratched face and arm immobilized in a splint could certainly throw anyone who knew him off balance – but that hadn’t been what had upset Tony.
From then on, Steve had encouraged him to continue calling him like that, which wasn't very easy either. Tony could feel his face on fire every time he pronounced that word, his brain stubbornly refused to accept there was nothing wrong with that.
But nothing was never easy when dealing with Anthony Stark. He wasn’t just going to give up. He knew this had nothing to do with whatever unfinished gadget he had over his desk. This was because he just didn’t want to face Steve right now. He was still mad at him, he did remember that, and staying with him would just lead him to do what he was successfully avoiding to do for more than a month now. He couldn’t let that happen again. He promised himself he wouldn’t do it again, and he had all the intention of being truth to his word.
By the time the pizza was ready to be baked, Tony was a complete disaster. His face, arms, legs and onesie were stained with flour and tomato sauce; and his hair was scattered with some of the toppings that never made it to the pizza. Needless to say Steve couldn’t have cared less, besides the fact that he was thrilled to see his baby having such a good time after how tensed and anxious he’d been when at the beginning of their playdate, the mess provided the perfect opportunity to continue getting information on the sly.
“I don’t feel like talking right now,” Tony informed, turning around and moving towards the elevator.
“Then why you never do the things I ask you to do right away? Why do you fight this so much? You just get moodier and start doing things that are not good for yourself. I just don’t get it, I’ve told you I’m perfectly fine with this, why don’t you believe me? Huh?”
“C’mon kiddo, it’s going to be fast, I promise,” Steve said, pushing Tony a little bit from him, but he only succeeded in making him clutch even tighter.
It was a fact that Tony didn’t want the captain to leave him, but if he decided to do it, Tony at least hoped it didn’t happen right now. Right now he just wanted Steve to come and help him, because the lack of air was making him dizzy, and he had broken out into cold sweat, and holding his teddy’s arm wasn’t helping at all, and he thought he would pass out, and he was literally freaking out, and the only person who was capable of helping him in this kind of situation was Steve, but Steve was going to kick him out of his life right now, and he didn’t know what was going to happen then, and he didn’t know why he always had to screw thing up, and…
“For being a book that was written for teenagers, I’ve got to admit it’s really good, it really caught my attention.”
But don’t misunderstand him, Tony wasn’t saying he would have agreed if Steve had asked. He knew perfectly well Steve had never meant to give it a try with the intention of humiliating him or a way to get aroused, Steve’s mother hen trait had always been so tangible that Tony was sure Steve only wanted to take care of him. And, truth to be told, all the research Tony had done about age playing after their argument – no need for Steve to find out about that – had shown him how fulfilling it could be for both parties.
With a skill that he had acquired without realizing it, Steve proceeded to unsnapped the crotch of the white and blue striped onesie that Tony was wearing, revealing the diaper underneath. All the blocks that had been decorating it had disappeared, which only confirmed the diaper was wet. When Steve undid the straps, he could see out of the corner of his eyes how Tony observed him with half-open eyes. The expression of mortification Tony usually wore whenever his diaper was changed was now replaced with one of pure curiosity, though the sight of pink blush on his cheeks continued appearing.
“Okay, okay,” Steve conceded. Clint’s meltdown had been enough, Steve didn’t have the strength to deal with another one on the same day. “When Clint finished his juice, you can borrow it.”
“That damn expression you always wear whenever you want to hug me but you don’t dare to do it,” Tony said.
Smiling warmly, Steve leaned forward to press a kiss to the side of his baby’s head. Then, taking advantage of the nearness, he groped under the pillow behind them and straightened up once he found the three items he was searching for: a pull-up, one of those normal white diapers meant for adults, and one whose aliens and spaceships design showed it’s been created for Age Play purposes.
“It can wait.” His voice sounded as if he was trying very hard no to show his partner that he was getting into his nerves.
"I'm sorry sir, but you asked me not to let anyone until you finish, no matter what," The A.I. answered, causing Tony’s smirk to fade.
Never had Tony imagined that, even if Steve had tried to talk him out if it on the following days, the one who would resist the idea the most wouldn’t be him, but Tony himself.
If somebody walked in at that exact moment, he or she would definitely get a wrong idea. Good thing Tony had been very clear when he ordered JARVIS not to let anyone in, no matter what; unless it was a matter of life or death, and even like that, JARVIS would have to ask before opening the door.
“I know, I don’t know what I was thinking, I can’t really understand why I did what I did now,” Steve acknowledged, turning his head to look at Phil. “And I’m sorry for telling him about that, I really didn’t mean to, I swear it just slipped out,” he apologized, turning his head now to look at Clint.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Steve said, leaning over to kiss Tony on the brow before lower him back a bit until Tony was almost completely supported by Steve’s arm against his back. “You’ve been so good, daddy’s proud of having such a good boy,” he praised. The burning in Tony’s face was back in full force, though Tony doubted his face had had any shade but red during the entire evening.
Over the last thirty minutes, Tony had been rubbing his eyes and yawning constantly, and even if he stubbornly tried to focus his attention on the Play-Doh sets he was playing with while he watched the movie played on the TV, it was obvious he was tired and sleepy. Steve figured it would be a good idea for Tony to take a nap. Taking into account his horrendous sleeping habits, any opportunity to sleep had to be taken. The problem was that getting Tony to sleep was never an easy task, especially when it wasn’t nighttime, so he hoped a bottle with warm milk helped him to achieve his goal.
Shamefully, when that day arrived, when Tony found himself unable to shake off the idea of age playing, he couldn’t bring himself to go and inform Steve about it. He paced restlessly around his workshop for almost the whole afternoon, and got cold feet whenever he managed to reach the elevator, incapable of handling the uncertainty.
“Eat that one, and then you take a bigger one, the biggest one if you want,” Steve said, and he knew any suggestion he made was going to be rejected when Clint shook his head forcefully. Steve sighed again. “Go. Go and get another one,” he conceded, not really understanding why the size of the slice mattered, but not willing to deal with a crying toddler either.
"So, the fact that you haven't grabbed a bite the last two days is deliberate?” Steve questioned, raising an eyebrow.
But Tony had refused to let that happen. And Steve being his caregiver had gone into daddy mode on him, attempting to help, but that upset him even more. And when Tony was upset and between his two headspaces, he tended to do the most adult thing to do in this situation, at least according to him: sulking and hiding from the captain.
It wasn’t like Tony didn’t know that. He knew Steve continued looking after Little Clint every now and then; he did it way before they started age playing themselves, so, why would he stop? Besides the fact that Steve was the kind of person who liked helping others whenever and however he could, he’d never denied his taste for Age Play. If Tony wasn’t willing to let Steve babied him anymore, Steve wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to hang out with someone who still enjoyed and needed that kind of attention.
“Shh, it’s okay sweetheart, daddy’s here,” Steve lulled, patting Tony on the butt a couple of times as he carefully leaned forward to grab Clint’s hand. Tony squealed slightly and tightened his embraced around Steve’s neck, surely afraid he might fall off his arms, but Steve’s grip was firm.
“You know, Raawry doesn’t really count, I wouldn’t have gotten rid of it even if you had never picked it,” Steve informed, smiling at how protectively Tony hugged it. “But I wasn’t lying when I said I was hungry, so just choose one more thing so we can go to the kitchen.”
Anyway. I needed to distract my mind and this was the result. I hope you like it and sorry again for taking this long to update.
With both arms braced against of the back of the couch and an untouched book resting on his lap, Steve sat in front of the TV, eyes fixed on it. The loose t-shirt as well as the sweatpants he was wearing verified he planned on doing nothing but staying in, which meant Tony had no option but to proceed. Unless the alarm to assemble went off, that would give Tony the perfect excuse to postpone things for one more day. Unfortunately, even though he kept his ears well open for the next few minutes, no alarm was heard. Of course it wasn’t, why would destiny stop messing with him? Why would enemies work on a schedule that was convenient for him?
It was always the same. Whenever Clint got immerse in any activity, he tended to overlook his body functions. Phil had to pay close attention to him and remind him to go to the bathroom when Clint showed any sign of having a full bladder, otherwise he would continue doing whatever he was doing and make use of his pull-up, which he totally dreaded and only leaded to tears.
to be mad at Steve. It made him feel uneasy, cranky and, just unhappy. If they couldn’t spend too much time together per se – battles to fight, work to do, SHIELD stuff to deal with, creations to develop, volunteer work to offer to do, deadlines to meet – having an argument made it much worst. It deprived him of the possibility of stopping whatever he was doing to go and steal a kiss from Steve just because he had felt like to.
So, Tony allowed himself get into his Little mindset, now when it was still out of free will and not a slip caused by pushing that side away for too long. Now when he didn’t have to be focused more on his surroundings than the toys in front of him, jumping every time he heard a noise, afraid somebody may walk into the room and catch him while his Little headspace was in charge.
Maybe what Tony needed was a playmate, one of his ‘own age’. Playing with another little might be the thing that made the difference in his behavior, and what better option than Clint? Clint surely knew how to have fun with any toy, he made noises when he played with toy cars and airplanes, imitating their real sound; he faked his death way too dramatically when they played with water pistols – a bad idea when you were inside, Phil made sure to point out; he hid in places that would be unreachable for a real toddler when they played hide-and-seek, though he always gave away his hiding place because he couldn’t stop laughing. Even if Steve still wanted Tony to be a baby, it would be nice to see him playing like Clint did every now and then.
Steve took a deep breath before talking again. “Okay, you have the right to ask me that, and if you don’t want me to, I’ll avoid babysitting Clint as much as I can,” he assured as he pushed Tony away a little so he could look at him in the face. “But if I’m gonna do that, I need to know why. You need to tell me what’s bothering you.” Tony shook his head, looking slightly uncomfortable. “Yes, you do, sweetheart. How am I going to make things better if I don’t even know what the problem is?” Tony sucked his lips into his mouth. “Are you jealous of Clint?” Steve questioned again, and this time Tony nodded. “Why?” Tony shrugged. “Tony,” Steve called with a warming tone of voice.
“I’m sure he hasn’t given up on the idea of having a pool in the living room,” Steve commented, earning a chuckle from Phil. Little Clint didn’t seem to understand that they already had a pool in the Tower, no matter how many times they had explained it to him. “But seriously Phil, you don’t have to worry, I’ll keep him out of trouble. See you when–”
“Clint, I’ve made you that dish hundreds of times and you always eat it. You love it.” Okay, maybe Phil was exaggerating that fact a little, Clint avoided vegetables as cats avoided water, but he would always end up eating them if Phil served them with something he really liked.
“Steve,” Tony called as he looked down at the fidgeting hands in his lap, afraid he wouldn’t be able to talk if he faced him.
Still indecisive, Phil took a step forward and realized he would need to make fast decisions and act more quickly if he didn’t want this whole situation to be out of his hands. Even though Tony was clearly torn up for having wet his pants, he didn’t hesitate to run out of the bathroom right past him.
“Of course I’m not OK, I just stubbed my stupid pinky toe!” Tony complained, too melodramatically in Steve’s opinion. He had seen him take way more awful blows during battle, but whenever he hit himself like this, Tony loved to overreact. Perhaps because Steve tended to get all worried about him, overreacting too, to a point where he even offered to kiss it better. Tony claimed he didn’t like it, but when Steve pressed several kisses to whatever part of his body Tony had hurt, that expression of contentment in his face couldn’t be mistaken.
He was enjoying the bubble bath, he truly was. Steve had undressed him, helped him into the bathtub, scrubbed his body and washed his head with such patient, care and affection that it hadn't been possible for Tony not to love it. By the time Steve had finished, Tony had been more than ready to go to bed, so he had gotten a little taken aback when, instead of taking him out of the bathtub, Steve had retrieved some bath toys from a washbowl Tony hadn’t noticed before and put them on the water.
So, that was what Tony was going to do tonight. He was going to fall asleep in the couch of his workshop intentionally. If Steve tried to make him walk all the way to their room, Tony would complain and claim he was too exhausted to do that. And if Steve then tried to carry him as if he was a damsel in distress, Tony would squirm until Steve understood that wasn’t the way Tony wanted to be carried.
“No, it is where it’s always been,” Steve assured, trying not to think too much about the fact that Tony hadn’t looked at him not even once yet. “Are you OK?” he repeated when he saw Tony kept rubbing his toes.
“Hey, normal human being here, not a super soldier,” Tony said, his voice choked, and even if Steve was clearly hugging him too tightly, Tony didn’t try to struggle free.
The whole choosing thing had proven to be quite successful with Tony, so Steve thought it wasn’t such a bad idea to continue with the same tactic. If Steve asked Tony whether he liked or disliked being diapered on a changing table, he would probably get all flustered and failed to answer; however, if Tony just had to do a simple motion to indicate that was one of the things he enjoyed, it’d be more probable he managed to do the task without so much fuss.
While being in his little headspace, Tony felt so relaxed, in a state of carefree and responsibility-free he had truly never experienced. It was like an infinite-floaty space that seemed boundless and filled his head with not-completely-known sensations and feelings. When Steve fed him, changed his diapers, carried him, it just felt right, it felt like that was how things were supposed to be. Tony didn’t have to worry about anything anymore, he only had to sit back and let himself be taken care of – something totally new for him, he was embarrassed to recognize.
Despite the fact that Steve knew perfectly well Clint was an adult in the full sense of the word, seeing him there, sitting cross-legged on the bed holding very tightly to his chest what seemed to be a dragon stuffed animal while he tried so hard to hold his tears back, Steve’s heart melted immediately and his brain failed to see Clint as nothing but a small frightened kid.
“No, daddy,” Tony complained, but he didn’t hesitate to throw his arms around his neck when Steve balanced him on a hip, head resting on his shoulder.
“Yeah, I said that, but… but, it’s all so… so sudden,” Steve babbled, not knowing what to say. “Hey, wait, let’s talk about this,” Steve pleaded when he saw Tony opening the door.
“Clint? Did he tell you what he needs?” Steve questioned. If his memory served him correctly, they didn’t have anything planned for the afternoon.
“JARVIS, lock the door, please,” Steve asked politely, wincing a little when he heard the noise made by a body bumping into a metal door. “I’m going to cook us something to eat. Anything special you would like me to make?”
Making pizza from scratch had been a wonderful idea. Messy, but still wonderful. Once Tony had gotten over the fact that it was okay to manhandle the food with his hands and that the mess which resulted from it wasn’t a big deal, he started to have fun with the process. He giggled in delight during all the time he kneaded the dough, apparently enjoying the sensation of burying his fingers in it as well as squeezing it; and when it was time to sprinkle the toppings, well, he’d gotten a bit too creative.
To be fair, I didn't update the last two weeks not because I was playing KH3, but because I've been having a lot of work and I just couldn't get around to it >_<. And I'm quite still busy, so I don't promise to update next week either, but not for the lack of trying, I promise :p
“Jeans,” Tony said, making a face at the outfit while he pulled down his t-shirt, as if he was trying to cover his pull-up with it. Phil found it ironic how Tony seemed to be more embarrassed now than when he had been in front of him practically naked.
“Then you will have to be given time-out,” Steve shrugged, turning around again to take the plates from the counter. Being thrown things didn’t actually trouble him, it was just a matter of respect, really.
Nevertheless, it was not possible to avoid someone forever, Tony knew he would have to face Steve sooner or later, but he really preferred it was more later than sooner. But apparently life hated him, because by the eight day after the incident happened, Tony crashed into Steve right outside the communal kitchen, when he was sneaking some coffee. At midnight. Who goes in the kitchen at midnight but him? Steve was surely waiting for him.
It must have been one of those days when Clint hadn't been able to help slipping into his little headspace and Phil hadn't been around. He tended to look for Steve, as being little while he was by himself was not a good idea. Besides, Steve turned out to be a good babysitter.
There was no turning back. Tony had accepted and agreed to give Age Play a chance. However, it was one thing to say you would do it, it’s another to actually carry it out.
His heart beat rapidly, thick beads of cold sweat ran down his entire body, and his breathing was heavy. Typical reactions of a nightmare, Tony had experienced them way too many times to not recognize them. No matter what he did, he had never been able to avoid nightmares. And he had literally tried everything, from not eating before going to bed to sleeping sitting down. Eventually Tony gave up, due to his lifestyle they were inevitable, so Tony figured it would be a better idea to focused on dealing with nightmares rather than trying not to have them. With the help of his reasoning he could downplay whatever he had dreamed.
But one afternoon, Phil had required his assistance once more, and Steve had ended up babysitting Clint until Phil had been able to make it to the Tower. Clint had hidden under the bed for the first hour, not really wanting to be Little when Steve was the only one around, but too deep into his little headspace to try to go back to his adult self. It wasn’t until Steve took out one of his toys – a remote control car – and started to play with it pretending to have a lot of fun, that Clint decided to come out from under the bed.
Steve and he were OK now. It had been weeks since their fight and reconciliation, and everything was just going smooth. Some harmless arguments from time to time – Tony had been too reckless during battle, Steve insisted on senseless bonding activities, Tony wanted to skip a checkup, Steve denying Tony coffee until he ingested something more nutritious – but nothing out of the ordinary. Steve had worked hard on making up to him, and Tony had appreciated it.
Phil fought back the urge of taking his phone out of his pocket and snap a picture of the trio that was sleeping on the bed. Steve lay in the middle of the bed with Tony snuggled against him using his chest as a pillow, and Clint was curled up on the other side, in a way that told Phil he had been reluctant to go to bed. Phil smiled fondly at the thought of Clint fussing, he didn’t like taking naps, but he sure needed them when he was little.
Tony might have as well asked Steve to clear up his doubts, but that would make him believe Tony was reconsidering the whole situation, and Tony didn’t want him to think that. Again, it might be just his desire to satisfy his curiosity of what the Age Play was like, and Tony might not end up liking it, so it was better not to bring up the topic with Steve. There had to be another way to find the answers to his questions which didn’t involve Steve.
“Jeez, I’d love to Clint, but Tony’s taking a nap, and he wasn’t in a very good mood, so, you know, I’d like to be here when he wakes up,” Steve excused himself, rubbing the back of his neck.
Crying non-stop for almost a complete day just because Steve hadn’t been around sounded foolish from any perspective.
“Don’t want it,” Tony said, tensing a bit when he saw that Phil had gotten closer. “Won’t happen again.”
And it really did. If Tony ate and rested as well and often as he was supposed to, Steve’s nerves would really appreciate it.
"So, what? Is that something that turns you on? Do you want me to get down on my hands and knees and call you Daddy? Do you want to humiliate me by making me wear and use diapers? Do you want me to be naughty so you can you spank me? Is that a thing for you?" Tony demanded, and Steve couldn’t help wincing at how wrong that sounded.
“I don’t know.” Tony whispered, his eyes looking at everything but his father. Even that monstrous antique Howard used as a desk seemed more worthy of captivating capturing his sight attention at that moment.
Steve signed heavily, putting the fork down on the plate as it was clear Tony wouldn’t accept any food until his curiosity was satisfied. “Can’t I pamper you?” he asked. Tony raised an eyebrow, clearly taken aback by how simple Steve’s reason seemed to be. “Don’t you like it when I coddle you?”
“What the actual fuck?!” Tony exclaimed when he saw five signatures on the same sheet, the curse word feeling wrong on his tongue. Seriously, how could he space out that badly? This thing of not being able to control at will when to be little was utterly annoying.
“You’re just going to hurt yourself, you know. Quit that and go to take a shower, you really need it. Don’t be so stubborn.” Steve said, as he took the ingredients he needed for the pasta.
“Of course, and all the toppings you want,” Steve conceded as he lifted Clint’s hips enough to slide the diaper under his butt, quick movements as well as careful, the least he wanted was to elbow Tony or something by accident. Hitting one little had been more than enough.
What if Steve got mad at him? He had been more enthusiastic about the whole teddy-bear-thing than him. What it he finally got sick of him? Steve had been very patient with him, putting up with a lot of his bad moods and rudeness, because even if Tony denied it, he knew he could be a total brat when he was caught between his two headspaces. In spite of that, Steve was always there, acting like a mother hen when Tony craved comfort, not hesitating to have a firm hand when necessary, though. Tony might push him away most of the times, but Steve remained there, patiently waiting for him to ease his panicked thoughts and give in.
The bad thing was that Steve was an extremely determined individual, and if he decided to do something, not even Ton’s power of persuasion could make him change his mind, at least not without a valid reason.
“So? Do you want to try being a toddler?” Steve questioned. Tony’s face acquired a stronger shade of red before he shook his head. “I’d like a verbal answer, baby.”
Even if he could have easily disposed of the crib, the high chair, and plenty of toys and books that Clint didn’t use because they were meant for babies and he wasn’t one, Steve just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Tony had never gotten around to make use of many of those things, but they were his anyway, and Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that getting rid of that stuff was as if he were saying goodbye to his baby. He’d accepted and respected Tony’s decision, though he wasn’t sure if he was ready to accept there was a high possibility he wouldn’t have the opportunity to interact with his baby anymore.
Age Play was just another thing they could have definitely talked about, Tony had meant what he had said: it didn’t seem to be that twisted, there certainly were worse things people used as a coping mechanism.
“I…” Tony trailed off, glad because Steve didn’t look away, but looking down not being able to stand Steve’s eyes on him. “I… I w-want…” Tony hugged himself, stepping back a little, not knowing what to say.
Determined to get a hold of himself, Tony wiped the tears with the back of his hands and looked around in search of a chair, a sofa or any surface where he could sit down and try to control his breathing. That turned out to be not such a good idea after all, because that made him really pay attention to his surroundings for the first time since he had wandered into the tower, and he did not like in the slightest the place he was in. Of all the rooms there were in the tower, why did he have to end up in the nursery? Wasn’t he supposed to head for his workshop whenever his mind was on autopilot?
Tony furrowed his brow in confusion. Chasing after each other, tickling and finding ways to lock the other one out of the workshop couldn’t be counted as playing, could it?
Shamefully, Tony couldn’t succumb to that desire no mattered how badly he wanted to; the reason why he’d decided to put an end to all that role-play thing was a valid one, and he was not willing to go back on it. If he could ignore vital things like hunger and exhaustion, ignoring that part of him who wanted to be Little should be a piece of cake. And it kind of was for some time, at least until Tony saw Steve babysitting Clint. That day everything began going downhill.
“Yes, you do baby boy, come on, let daddy feed you,” Steve persisted. He nuzzled Tony’s head with his nose, and
Steve though about taking down the nursery, perhaps not completely, but there certainly were some stuff and furniture that he could give away, that maybe other people could put to better use. Because that was the problem, the nursery wasn’t being used, and besides the fact that Steve disliked wasting things, he believed there was no point in having a room specifically designed and furnished for age playing if the person to whom it was originally intended for didn’t want to have anything to do with it – and showed no intentions of changing his mind – and the other sporadic visitant avoided it at all costs – something that Steve couldn’t complain about, since Clint’s apparent aversion to it was caused by him.
“I’m fine,” Steve assured, and it was almost true. He wasn’t going to deny he was in pain, but it was nothing he couldn’t handle. It seemed that everybody tended to forget he had the super soldier serum in his system. His injures might be serious, but it would take him only two or three days to heal completely. Most of his wounds had already started forming scabs.
But it was just a matter of time before Tony got him hooked with the perks of technology, showing him how useful it could be when used properly. By the time they started dating, Steve was a lost cause. Tony would never get tired of seeing Steve’s expression of pure amazement whenever he found out that something he thought impossible could be achieved with today’s technological advances. And when Steve let himself try the internet, well, that had been it. He could spend all day surfing on the Internet if there was nothing better to do, especially now that it wasn’t necessary to be sitting down in front of a computer to do so, as you could use a cell phone or a tablet.
Coming up with a fake company problem or last-planned meeting wouldn’t work, Pepper didn’t think twice about telling the truth when Steve asked her if said problem or meeting was real or not. Hiding in his workshop wouldn’t work either, Steve didn’t beat around the bush anymore when his aim had to do with taking Tony out of there – Tony had already had the glass replaced at least three times. Faking illness would just make Steve get deeper into his caregiver mode, and that was what Tony was trying to avoid. Sneaking out or hiding in his room was out of option too, apparently JARVIS had a glitch that couldn’t be solved which made the A.I. close or open any door in a way that made impossible for Tony to avoid Steve.
When Clint had heard the sound that the vent cover of the kitchen did when Phil removed it, he had jumped down from the vent, surely trying to run away from him. But Phil was already waiting for him down there, and even if Clint had run to avoid being caught, he had been so astonished for having been tricked that Phil had had no problems catching him.
"Yes, but for other purposes than bathing," Tony insinuated, "not you literally making me a bubble bath and bathing me. And the gift you gave me on Valentine's Day," he continued listing.
And Tony was completely sure his plan would have worked until the end if some Gods above didn’t enjoy toying with him, because if there was something Tony hadn’t been able to control yet was that, whenever he had nightmares, his mind was pushed further into his Little headspace without being able to avoid it. And of course, the few times he had actually dragged himself out of the workshop to take a nap and rest for a while, his eyes had snapped open no long after he had closed them, all the images that floated in his mind while sleeping riddle with nightmares.
And now he was standing in the middle of said nursery, refusing to feel any hint of remorse for tearing everything to pieces. Right now the only thing he regretted ever was building it. How the hell could he get rid of his Little side if he kept buying and accumulating things that only encouraged the behavior? No, destroying everything had been for the best, no matter how bad the feeling that it had been a terrible idea was.
The next time they had a play date, Tony was supposed to be the one who initiate it. That had been the agreement – or rather the imposition, because Tony was sure as hell he hadn’t really agreed to anything – that they had made that day. Up until now, Steve had been the one who nudged him into playing when he felt like it or when he suspected Tony might need it, as he was always good as spotting the signs; but now he refused to do that. If Tony wanted some Little quality time, he would have to go and ask for it.
“Hey, baby,” Steve greeted when he was sure Tony was listening to him. Tony’s face twisted into a pout before his eyes slipped shut again, making Steve chuckle. For someone who was always so reluctant to go to sleep, Tony sure had a hard time waking up. “No, come on sweetheart, it’s time to wake up,” Steve repeated, shaking Tony a bit more.
Tony felt paralyzed. He wanted to leave, he wanted to go back to his bedroom and get changed, he didn't want Clint to see him dressed with that piece of clothing Steve had put on him that only babies wore, he didn't want Clint to see him wearing a diaper. Yes, Clint was wearing one too, but still. So, Tony ordered his body to turn around and his legs to take him away from there, but the only thing he did was emitting a choked sob he didn’t know where it had come from.
Yes, Tony was struggling. He wore diapers without using them, he held the toys without playing with them, he sucked on a pacifier without letting that action to be soothing, he accepted Steve as his daddy without daring to call him like that. But Steve knew Tony would eventually get comfortable enough to do all those things. Steve just needed to be patient and supportive.
Steve had given him that teddy bear. He had literally dragged him to the toy store and made him choose one stuffed animal, arguing that it was unbearable for a kid not to have an animal companion to hold at night. Tony had complained that he wasn’t really a kid and that he didn’t need one, but Steve would not let him leave the store without getting one. So, he had chosen the first teddy bear he saw, simply wanting to leave the store as soon as possible before somebody saw them. It had been an exceedingly common teddy bear, brown with a “hug me” embroidered on his tummy. Yet, Tony had secretly loved it and had been very grateful to Steve for making him go and get it.
As Steve rubbed slow circles onto his baby’s back with the intention of helping him to drift off more peacefully, he looked around the nursery. Tony had basically chosen to keep everything as it was and Steve would be lying if he claimed that didn’t make his stomach flutter. There had been a tiny part of him which believed Tony only allowed him to baby him as much as he did to please him, so knowing now for a fact that Tony did enjoy playing such a young and vulnerable role took a burden off that Steve was pretending not having been carrying.
“Come on buddy, let’s just put this on you so we can go and do whatever you want. We can watch a movie, or play something. Are you hungry? I bet you are, I can make you whatever you want to eat,” Phil offered, hoping any of those suggestions made Tony change his mind. Tony kept shaking his head. “C’mon kiddo, come with me, let me diaper you,” he insisted, taking Tony’s hand in his.
Not wanting to waste time and give Tony the opportunity to stop him again, Steve unfolded the diaper and placed it under him, spreading some powder before fastening it together. Tony whimpered a little as Steve pulled him into a sitting position and whined a bit louder when the Teddy was taken from his hold, making Steve to feel guilty, although he needed to do that in order to manipulate him into a onesie. The Iron Man onesie, which was one of Tony’s favorites, even if he disagreed. As soon as Steve snapped it at the crotch, he gave Tony his Teddy back and this time he didn’t think twice about holding it.
“Sure,” was Phil’s answer, though he doubted Clint stayed awake long enough for that. If everything turned out well, Clint would go out like a light halfway through the movie.
“Downstairs. Coffee,” Tony muttered, already leaving the kitchen. Steve hurried to catch up with him, placing a hand on his shoulder to stopped him from continuing walking.
“What? Why? Is this because of the nursery? Was it too much? We don’t have to use it if you don’t want to, I can disassemble everything and return it,” Steve offered, not liking the way Tony shook his head.
were driving, crashed into my pile and knocked it over, that wasn’t cheating. But when Dummy throws balls at your pile, it is?” Steve asked with a frown on his face, though there was no real heat in his voice.
The scene Phil witnessed when he entered the kitchen made him want to laugh out of frustration. Clint was standing in front of the kitchen island with both hands on the jar blender, blinking non-stop trying to keep the milk that ran down his face away from his eyes. Phil didn’t even need to ask what had happened, the mess around Clint, as well as the forgotten lid next to the blender, showed perfectly well what had come to pass.
“Keep looking,” Phil ordered as he turned his head towards him, choking a grunt when he saw all the books that had previously been in the bookcase spread on the floor around Clint.
If Clint knew that, by leaning that way, the waistband of the pull-up he was wearing was totally visible, he would definitely get mad.
That made sense, after all, those kind of mindsets were usually used as a way to relax and forget about all the problems, at least for a while.
The way to the table was all blurry, Tony was sure he did walk, but he wasn’t sure if his feet actually supported all his weight. It was until he was sitting down at the table that he completely awoke and all his bad mood went to the surface again. If Steve thought he had already won, he was more than mistaken. He wasn’t just going to sit down there quietly and have dinner like he wanted him to do. He stood up as soon as Steve went to fetch the dishes, walking fast to… well, there was nowhere he could go outside the floor, but at least he could hide. He deliberately ignored that inner voice inside his head that was murmuring him how childish his behavior was starting to be.
