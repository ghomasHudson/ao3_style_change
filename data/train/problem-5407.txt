Almost 900 hits... I cannot thank you all enough. I am so blessed to be a part of such a wonderful fandom family. God bless you all!!
"No, Cass, we are not watching Rent!"
'Hey.' Really? That was the best Castiel could come up with?
If Destiel is not how they justify Castiel going to the Empty I don't know how I'll handle it. Destiel must be endgame canon.
"All these memories lose their meaning."
No. He was not a monster. He would never be a vampirate ever again; he'd promised himself that long ago. Benny would not hurt Dean. He willed his fangs back up into his gums. He focused on not taking in deep breaths so that he would not inhale Dean's scent. He would not harm the creature he'd been trying to save for all this time.
Dean jumped up out of his chair, but he was pushed right back down. He'd been so caught up that he had not even realized that somebody had a hand on his shoulder. His brother-in-law, Gabriel, smirked as he sat in the seat beside Dean.
"How...how did you‚Ä¶" Dean stammered. Gabriel shook his head. "Aw c'mon, you just sent me into the 'Twilight Zone' and you're not even gonna tell me how?"
Benny lifts his blade and slashes the Leviathan's throat. It flounders, then falls down dead in the dirt. Someday a Leviathan Blossom will sprout from its corpse, and maybe it will do some good someday.
Dean lied down on the floor of the cave and tried to sleep. But he could not stop shaking. His head was aching, and sweat was soaking his face and back.
If marriage meant never losing Castiel, then, Dean would be fine saying 'here comes the bride.' üë∞
Dean collapsed on the floor. He crossed his arms over his knees and buried his face. Like hippie/new agey Sam had taught him to calm his anxiety on the airplane, Dean took several deep breaths, paying close attention to the air entering and exiting his body. But it didn't help, so Dean tried something else.
Never in his life did Dean ever think he would get to enjoy true happiness. It seemed it would always elude him like a butterfly that dodges a child's net. And yet, here Dean was, in love with his soulmate, he had a job that, while draining, he loved more than he'd ever let on, and he had a great relationship with what was once his estranged brother. He even had foster children of sorts: Claire Novak and Jack Kline. Dean had everything.
This time, the angel decided to take a chance. Castiel scooped Dean's hand into his. Of course, he expected Dean to snatch his hand back and rebuke his affections. To his utter shock, Dean just looked at him with those doe eyes of his. There was surprise in his expression at first, but then Dean relaxed and Castiel was able to breathe again.
The song ended, and the story progressed. But Dean did not budge from his spot next to Castiel. Never in his life did Castiel think that Dean would allow this. Well, when something was bothering Dean, he would sometimes let people comfort him. But Dean was not upset any more, and he still wanted to be near Castiel. It was amazing!
But it isn't good. It bothers Benny. For the first time, he meets the angel's eyes. There's a distance in them, a wildness. It's a result of adjusting to life in Purgatory. Dean has a similar look, especially when he discusses rescuing Castiel. But there's another tell in Castiel's tone and in his movements: sorrow. Benny wants to know what is really going on, no more p.c. b.s., and no Dean to interject. The angel will have to speak for himself now.
Dean was acting like someone trying to get over the person he loved and just couldn't.
"Castiel," Anna continued, clasping her hands together and looking up to the ceiling. "I was a bad sister to you. I should have told you while you were still here. But I am going to be the sister you deserve, right now." She swallowed hard. "Dean and I slept together." A collective gasp of surprise echoed around the room. People whispered amongst themselves. The judge banged the gavel and demanded silence.
Sam searched for words to let out all of his conflicting emotions. But he could find nothing that did justice to the hurt and disappointment his brother had caused. So he just stared at his brother in exasperation and disbelief. Sam knew that Dean still valued his role as a big brother, and that letting Sam down would be a punch to his brother's chest.
With my voice. Still
The ire in his brother's eyes concerned Sam; he worried they might come to blows over this. How could this conversation have spiraled like a tornado so fast? Still, Sam kept his level head.
But his sisters could not have been more wrong. No, Castiel would never claim that his relationship with Dean was a healthy one. They were the poster family for a daytime TV show. He knew that better than anyone.
The medicine they injected into Dean's IV, coupled with the stress of his fear and his injuries, lulled him into a fitful sleep. Much to the chagrin of the medical staff, Castiel refused to leave Dean's side. Castiel had no intention of breaking his oath to Dean. Even if he wanted to, Dean still was still holding onto him. He would not be the one to let go.
Worse than all
Torn. I cannot
Outside of Benny's rambling mind and back in reality, Dean is informing Castiel of their plan to bust out of Purgatory. Good. Benny needs a distraction. The plot is perfect. For the rest of the time he's trapped in Purgatory, he can focus on the escape. Then, once they get topside, he can meet someone. In time, he'll come to forget all about Dean Winchester.
Jared and Gen are so amazing!! I am counting down the days until Walker starts!!
To mask his true mood, Benny pastes on a brave face. On the inside, though, he's confused, and sadness and disappointment eat away at him. He wishes that he'd never kissed Dean Winchester. He wishes that Dean would have rejected him then, before he fell too hard. The idea of being a rebound for someone as special as Dean burns something awful.
Anna moaned as Dean made love to her. The sound of a woman's delighted scream recharged Dean like a battery. He'd forgotten how much he enjoyed the softness of a woman's skin, the sweet smell of her hair, the plumpness of her breasts. It was invigorating.
Sam pounded on the door and demanded to be let out. One guard freed him, while another led Dean back to his cell. For once, Sam did not even look back. He was too upset to deal with Dean right now.
After a swig of beer, Dean cleared his throat and responded, "You, Cass." Dean paused, searching for the right words. "I've been going out of my mind without you‚Ä¶"
With that damn joyful smile on his handsome face, Dean strokes Castiel's cheeks and chin and compliments him on his dirty beard. Benny feels as if he has just been punched in the stomach. In all their time together, Dean has never looked at him like that, as if he were the most precious treasure to ever exist. Dean has never touched him with such tenderness.
"I feel like I've loved you my whole life," Castiel whispered.
To Castiel's delight, Dean appeared to be enjoying the movie. The songs had a rock and roll edge, unlike most typical Broadway shows. The story was captivating, particularly the love triangle between Maureen and her boyfriend and girlfriend. Cass noticed Dean's coy grin spring up every time the girls showed up on screen.
Overcome with emotion, Sam dropped the paper. He pressed his shaky hands over his eyes. Ruby pulled her husband against her chest. Sam threw his arms around her and wept.
"Why didn't you?"
‚úå üíò üôè
Sam was yelling at him that they had to check on Kelly and the baby. But Dean could not move. He was drunk with grief, and it was robbing him of his faculties.  Sam ran off to see the spawn of Satan. Vaguely, the child had seemed like something of importance to Dean at one point.
Disappointments
Fallen Angel
Ruby and Sam prepare to watch Dean die.
And sure, Dean saved people. A lot of people owed him their lives. But it meant nothing if he could not protect Castiel, the love of his life. It meant even less than nothing when he'd never even gotten the chance to tell Castiel how much he loved him.
Trying to hide how moved he is by the angel's thoughtfulness, Benny mutters, "I'll protect Dean, but I ain't doing it for you."
Exasperation in his sad, dark eyes, Sam murmured, "You slept with Anna?!?!"
One more hour til GISH!!! Ahh!!
"A lesson?" Dean scoffed.
An army of police officers swarmed into the living room and descended on Dean like hornets who'd just had their nest smacked with a baseball bat. They were all speaking at the same time, asking what had happened, reading his Miranda rights, checking for other weapons. Even with so many of them, they had a hard time prying Castiel out of Dean's grasp. Even as they cuffed his hands behind his back, he was still reaching for the love of his life.
Since he could not make heads or tails of how meaningless sex could matter that much to Dean to make him sink so low, Sam tried to figure out how Dean could do such hurtful things to Castiel. Sam was so certain that Dean loved Castiel. In childhood, Dean had constructed a brick wall around himself to keep others out and protect himself from getting hurt. Nobody ever got through it. Except for Castiel. Around Castiel, Dean expressed fear and sadness. Around Castiel, Dean allowed himself to be vulnerable. Castiel brought out a side of Dean that nobody else was ever able to see. Castiel was the best thing to ever happen to Dean. And nobody knew that better or was quicker to acknowledge it than Dean. For all of those reasons, it made no sense that Dean would want to do such malicious things to the most important person in his life.
"Because-none of us have vaginas," he answered, causing Sam to roll his eyes.
Ruby was proof that the system had its flaws and that good people in bad trouble needed help. Because of Ruby, Sam chose to focus on defending the accused. The money wasn't great, but he felt good to be serving vulnerable people.
Merry Merry Christmas everyone!! God bless you all!! üéÑüéÖü¶åüå≤
His heart hammering in his chest, Dean took yet another leap of faith. But it wasn't scary. Dean could feel nothing but joy. He was losing himself in the very best of ways. It felt so natural, like he was born to be one with Castiel.
Except that it was true. Dean liked Benny. Dean placed his frail hands on Benny's cheeks. His smile was so full of joy, which in Purgatory was a joy in and of itself. Dean tried to bring Benny closer to him, but he was still too weak. So Benny obliged him, bending towards the hunter.
God bless!! ‚úù üìø üôè
'My husband stays with me or I'm gone. I mean it.'
In his heart, though, Sam knew he could never be like Dean. Their minds worked in such different ways. Sam was analytical and prepared. Dean was emotional and impulsive. Sam was fine being ordinary. Dean had dreams of being remembered. Sam was very interested in holistic health. Dean balked at nutrition and psychology.
"Hey, it took him twenty-six years to get on an airplane," Sam joked. Castiel just rested his chin on his knuckle, looking so let down.
"'That' is what your life will become if you touch my sister," Gabriel informed him. Dean followed Gabriel's judgmental eyes to the captivating woman on the dance floor.
Relief washes over Benny's handsome face. Dean needs him. Maybe there is something real in what they have. Maybe he's been too touchy about Dean and Castiel. Maybe he can cut the angel a little slack.
Dean's shaking hand at long last gave out. The gun crashed onto the floor with a loud whump. Dean's head fell on Castiel's chest in sadness and shame. Anguished sobs tore through his entire body like a torrential storm. With the final remnants of his strength, Castiel threw his sore arms around Dean and hugged him with all of his might. Jack ran over to them, and they pulled him into their embrace.
After a long time of wondering, Castiel at last learned why the bohemians wanted to go to Santa Fe. They were living in extreme poverty and were at risk of losing their apartments to their landlord's greed. On the subway, they were dreaming of an escape from the social problems that surrounded them. But Castiel suspected that they would not make it to New Mexico.
Then, one of the nurses held a needle over his hand. Dean thrashed his arm to keep her away. The doctors and nurses grabbed him and tried to pin him down, but he refused to be still. Despite the pain he was in, he could still put up one hell of a fight. Castiel's heart broke right in two as he watched Dean struggle for freedom. It hurt worse knowing that he was the one who brought him here, and now he could do nothing for the man with the eyes of the earth.
Dean had those concerns, but he could not stop kissing Castiel. He had spent months mourning the unbearable loss of the angel he loved. Now that he had him back, he knew what he wanted, and, somehow, by the grace of God, he'd earned it. Castiel's love was a drug, üíâ and Dean was already addicted.
"All these memories lose their meaning." ~John Lennon~
"Bitch."
Benny kissed Dean's mouth again, and Dean returned the gesture. It was more difficult now Benny was more aware of the danger he was putting his friend in. But he had to be careful. Besides the bloodlust, Benny had to remind himself that he was much stronger than Dean and could not squeeze him too hard.
Jack returned to his seat amongst the spectators. His aunt Anna placed her arm around him, and he leaned closer to her. His eyes still searched for Dean's, but Dean did not turn around.
Devotion. Yet
Catnip.
Jack had been through so much already in his short life. His mother had died in childbirth, and his father, Castiel's brother, was incarcerated in the south. Castiel and Dean had raised the boy as their own son/nephew since he was born. If not for the sake of saving his life, Castiel prayed that Dean would spare Jack yet another heartache.
Thank you thank you thank you!! üéÉüéÉüéÉ
Benny dislikes Castiel.
Dean had learned the lyrics by accident. After they'd watched Rent, Castiel had asked Sam to download the soundtrack onto his cell phone. From afar, Dean had heard Cass tell Sam that he wanted it as a reminder of one of the happiest nights of his existence. Those words would torment Dean for all of his days. Over the next few weeks, Cass sang "I'll Cover You" over and over. It annoyed the life out of Dean, and, more than once, he had barked at Cass to shut up.
Y Yo a To Cass!!
Mustering up more courage than he'd needed since his second death, Benny leaned his head closer to Dean. Dean's heart raced with nervous excitement. Even better than that, Dean did not pull away in disgust, and that was more than Benny could have asked for.
Seek your love and
Apparently, the same could not be said of Dean. He was capable of deception, and maybe even disgrace. It hadn't seemed possible for Castiel to ever feel such doubt towards the love of his life.
So Benny embraced Dean, and Dean allowed him to do so. Even though Benny was cold blooded (so to speak), Dean's body quickly stopped shaking. Benny could feel his human heart rate speed up; he could smell the adrenaline spilling out of him. And something else too‚Ä¶
"Jack Kline?" The judge called out.
'I... I...' Anna stammered. 'I don't know.'
Happy New Year 2021!! I hope everyone has a blessed and healthy new year! And may 2021 be so much better than 2020!! It has to be!! My Supernatural Convention and Ringo Starr concert have been rescheduled to 2021 and i can't wait another minute! Lol üòπ
Sam leaned in as close as he could to his brother and pleaded with desperation, "Please, Dean."
Maybe he had gone too far. Dean was suffering enough without adding on this extra guilt. Perhaps it was too much for him to deal with.
To protect you
It was a wonder that Jack could sleep through it all. But it was for the best. If he were awake, he would be just as worried.
That means he can relate to both men. Sure. But Benny gets Castiel more. Just like Benny, Castiel is afraid of hurting Dean. Just like Benny, Castiel has to figure out human emotions, how to read them and what to do with them. This is difficult in and of itself. Catching feelings for a man as complex as Dean does not simplify it any, either.
"Leviathans!" Castiel declares. "Run!"
The pain was unlike any Dean had ever felt in all his life. His heart throbbed like he was having an attack. His head ached. Everything around him was spinning, and all of the colors blurred together. He wanted to go to sleep and never wake up.
Benny could not believe it. He'd liked Dean from the moment they met. But he never thought anything would come of it, apart from escaping Purgatory together. He never thought someone as incredible and strong as Dean would ever show interest in him in that way.
"I want to thank you all for your statements. The court sympathizes with the tragedy this family has suffered, and I understand that everyone is on edge. But the court cannot tolerate verbal outbursts of any kind." Judge Death announced. "Will the defendant please rise for sentencing?" Sam and Dean stood up. "Dean Winchester, the jury having found you guilty of the Capital Murder of Castiel Winchester, I sentence you to death by lethal injection."
Gabriel, the next speaker, was a different story. It was hard not to like Gabriel and even harder not to do as he wanted. And, today, he meant business. His playful eyes were dark with sadness. His smile was nowhere to be found.
No, Castiel had no right to believe Dean would ever betray him. All this was just because of the weather. Everything was fine.
'I will.'
Pulling his arm through the sleeve of his jacket, Dean chortled, "I told you from the beginning this was just a casual thing. If you weren't cool with that, you should have said so then."
Sam just had to deal with it.
But Sam's mind conjured up the memory of the night the three of them had watched Rent together. He had never seen Cass look so disappointed, so defeated. And he would never forget Cass's words: 'Maybe we were wrong‚Ä¶ maybe Dean just doesn't love me like I love him.'
The pianist began to play. Per Castiel's request, they would be marching along to instrumental versions of Christmas carols. Sam escorted Ruby, Michael accompanied Anael, Balthazar walked with Anna and Gabriel went with Naomi to the altar to the sweet sounds of "Silver Bells".
'I feel like I've loved you my whole life.'
Castiel stays quiet for a moment, then his face grows very serious. "Benny, can I ask you something very important?"
'So then the hospital should be no big deal for a tough guy like you.'
I would not
Despite his glossy, tired eyes, Sam sat down beside Castiel and queried, "You okay?"
Silently, Dean thanked Chuck and Amara and all of the angels. This was the best gift he could ever have received. Dean had been reunited with his best friend. All of the pain he'd been carrying since that horrible night vaporized and disappeared into the air like water boiling on the stove.
Right through me and
God bless Anael. That was why Castiel loved her so much. Although she could be crafty, seductive and self-serving, her heart was full of love, forgiveness and honesty. Throughout this whole ordeal, she'd been the only person to describe the love that Dean and Castiel shared. She'd been the only one to ask that they honor Castiel's wishes.
At this inquiry, Dean forced himself to take a drink. Since he didn't really want it, the beer made his face contort with distaste. Sam waited for the answer, almost unaware that he was holding his breath.
"If my brother Castiel was here, he would beg you to show Dean mercy. He'd probably try to get you guys to release Dean on probation. Make him do community service or something like that. It wouldn't have mattered to Castiel that he murdered him. My brother loved this self loathing heap of booze and broads with all his heart, and he believed everyone could be saved by God. You've seen a piece of Castiel in my nephew, Jack," Michael asserted. "But, I am not my brother. I will never forgive Dean Winchester for what he's done. Frankly, I think the lethal injection is too good for him. I'd like to see you guys let me and my brothers do to him what he did to Castiel. Let's see how he likes it."
Enjoy!! Thank you all again!! ‚úå üíò ‚õÑüíñ
It seemed fitting that the Priest would choose that particular quote on this day. Prior to this, it hadn't brought him all that much comfort. Sure, he was glad that his loved ones were safe with God. But he still wanted them to be with him.
But he could
Handle me,
'"Join the club,'" Dean retorts.
"Do you have any last words, Mr. Winchester?" Asked the Warden.
And the physical anguish of his broken body could never come close to rivaling the crippling pain in Castiel's heart that came from watching Dean cry.
Of course, Benny did it for himself. He knows that if he hadn't at least tried to assist the angel, Dean would never trust him again. He would have lost his friend and his hopes of leaving Purgatory if that was the case.
The Priest made the sign of the Cross over Dean's forehead. ‚úù Despite not being a Catholic, Dean had confessed his sins to the Priest. Of course he carried terrible remorse for what he'd done, and it did feel good to get it off of his chest.
Because, despite the years of beatings and, now, the infidelity, Castiel loved Dean Winchester with all of his heart and soul.
"'No,'" the angel whispers, ashamed.
Awareness smacked Sam in the face like an open palm. "You want them to sentence you to death." Dean avoided his eyes, a sure tell that Sam was correct. "You don't want to live without Cass. You think you deserve to die." Dean did not respond. Shaking his head, Sam packed up his belongings. "No. You may not want to try, but I'm not going to give up on you, even if you've given up on yourself."
Sam had recommended that they stay on another night at the hotel in Denver. It had been a very difficult day for Dean in particular, and he thought that his brother would do well to get some rest. On top of all of the stress of the hunt, Dean had been nursing a hangover, so a little downtime would have been beneficial.
Thank you all so much again!!
God Himself wanted them to be together. Castiel believed that with all his heart. Could there be any other reason that He had sent Castiel to save Dean's life?
"You're not going anywhere!" Dean spat, his light green eyes dark with rage. Castiel could almost see the fires of Hell flickering inside of them.
As he was hiking, and taking out a few baddies along the way, some special plants caught Benny's eye. Benny recalled the garden his wife used to grow in their house back in the bayou. When his kids caught colds and flus, his wife would brew teas to help them sleep better. She would use mint, lavender, and camomile. But for fevers, she would serve them tea made from a special pointy green plant.
Benny was attracted to Dean, too.
Dean closed his eyes and turned his head away. Nope. He just couldn't do it. He was so much weaker than Castiel. Try as he might, he could not compel himself to watch as the doctor prepared the needle.
Dean racked his mind for what his father had taught him about CPR all those years ago. He pushed his palms as hard as he could against Castiel's chest in desperate thrusts. Castiel's body bobbed up and down, and his chest inflated when Dean breathed into his mouth. Dean was sure he heard some cracking ribs, a sign he was doing it right.
Dean wanted to be found guilty. He wanted to burn for what he'd done to Cass. He never wanted to feel joy again. Without Castiel there to make him smile, it was a safe bet that he never would anyhow.
The DJ played an uptempo hip hop song. Women crowded the dance floor. Some were rubbing against their beaux, while others needed nothing but the music.
2800 Hits... Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. The Supernatural family is my rock, particularly my Destiel family. Thank you all for being so kind and so supportive. I'm grieving the passing of my grandma right now and I'd be lost without you guys.
Dean felt a tremendous ache in his head from alcohol and confusion. He could not understand what was going on. He wondered if perhaps he was in some sort of sci-fi horror show. Part of him expected to find a tardis outside or Piper, Pru and Phoebe to be stealing from the open bar. But it wasn't possible. None of this was possible.
To see past
Now, nothing mattered at all. Cass was gone forever. Dean had watched his best friend's murder with his own eyes.
The chapter title comes from the Salt and Pepa song "Step". There's a line in the song, "I can't believe it's over just for cheap sex." I think Sam would consider Anna and Dean's affair to be just like that. üòà
I'm sending prayers to my #spnfamily during the pandemic. I can't wait to bond during GISH!!
All of a sudden, Dean's legs gave out. Sam swooped and caught his brother before he hit the floor. Wrapping his brother's arm around his shoulder, Sam guided Dean into the upstairs guest room, next door to the nursery where Lucifer's child was hiding. In the recesses of his mind, Dean understood that Sam would need his assistance in dealing with the nephilim. But he could not force himself to focus on the problem and Sam did not bug him about it. Only Sam could possibly grasp the gravity of what Dean was dealing with.
You ask. I still
Dean kissed Castiel.
***************************************************
All he knew was, he needed air.
"In My Life, I love you more."
"Dean‚Ä¶"
Behind him,
Oh, but Castiel and Dean were very much in love. They'd fallen in love the moment they met. From the very beginning, their love had been passionate and fiery. It was chaotic, but it was deep and true. They could not live without each other.
"Where are you?" Castiel gave Dean his location. "Stay there. We're on our way."
Yet, despite Dean's distance towards Jack, Jack still loved him enough to forgive the unforgivable. Sam even dared to hope that Jack's compassion just might have been enough to persuade the court to spare Dean's life. Qu√© sera sera. What really mattered was that Jack finally had Dean's pride, if he even still craved the respect of a treacherous murderer.
Sometimes, Sam would resent Dean's perfection. Even as an adult, he'd still longed to be the good son that Dean was instead of the Prodigal Son he was. It hurt worse after their dad's death. In the Guilt stage of Grief, Sam had wished he would have tried harder to be like his older brother.
"'Live in my house. I'll be your shelter. Just pay me back with one thousand kisses. Be my lover, and I'll cover you'," Dean sang softly, his voice growing steadier as his breathing settled.
Dean had to see Castiel. He had to be sure that his angel had returned to him. Of course, Dean could recognize that soft voice from anywhere; his knees had grown weak, just as they always had, when he heard his name spoken by the one being he thought he'd never hear from again: the only being that he ever wanted to speak his name.
"Leave Jo out of it! She doesn't have a stick up her ass like you do!" Dean shouted.
This goes on for days and days as they hike towards the portal. In the course of one such episode, (in this particular drama, Benny has lost his composure in the face of Dean's refusal to accept the obvious), the angel begins to fidget. His ears perk up and his extra senses go into hyperdrive. His behavior makes Dean and Benny nervous.
He paused half way out of the door and met her eyes. "It's not even a choice," Dean declared. "I love him. I can't live without him."
All of his life, Dean had felt like he was not good enough. He thought he hurt more people than he saved. He thought he was small and would never make a difference in the world. For reasons he could never understand, he'd always felt incomplete, like part of him was missing.
Sam had the flu. Dean had lied to him about what he was doing and who he was with. Why would he do that? Castiel had never been suspicious or accusatory towards him. Dean had never given him any reason to be. It wasn't in Castiel's nature, anyway. There was a pure goodness in Castiel's heart that was almost angelic. Castiel trusted and loved people without any strings attached.
"We're getting out of here, Cass."
Terrified of
I'm not enough,
"Will the defendant please rise?" The bailiff instructed. Sam and Dean obeyed.
It makes Castiel's presence all the more irritating.
Benny shields his happiness again, returning to sharpening his stake. Although he is starting to like Castiel, the angel is still a rival. He is not quite ready to let him know he is getting under his icy skin.
'Will you, Castiel Shirley, take Dean Winchester as your lawfully wedded husband?'
The punch was unbelievably hard, as if Dean possessed supernatural strength. Castiel fell flat on his back, his hand jumping to cover his injured eye. The pain left him dizzy and unfocused. In his haze, he left himself way too exposed. Punches and slaps rained down on him just the same as water pelted the roof of the Impala. Blood gushed from his nose and mouth.
It was fortunate that Dean yawned and grew too tired to continue with their tryst. His fever spiked again, and Benny needed to search for more catnip in the morning. So the hunter snuggled against the Vampire and fell into a fitful sleep.
Happy Birthday to Genevieve Padalecki. You are such a beautiful person inside and out. I'm one of your biggest fans.
'Don't leave me.'
Batting tears off of his cheeks, Castiel turned on his heel towards the couch. A tight grip on his arm jerked him to an abrupt halt. Castiel felt a spasm of terror in his gut as Dean glared at him. In all of his life, Castiel had never seen such venom in a man's eyes. Dean's fingernails dug into the skin of Castiel's forearms.
My daughter and I are participating in our first GISH in 2 hours and I'm nervous/excited!
My tears of
Or does he?
At one point, as Roger sang about his desire to write a memorable song before he succumbed to AIDS, the film flashed back to Roger and his girlfriend injecting Heroin. Body tightening in anxiety, Dean winced as the girl in the movie plunged a needle into her arm. Without hesitating to contemplate Dean's reaction to the gesture, Castiel wrapped his arm around Dean's shoulder.
Castiel adverts his gaze away from Benny. White hot anger flashes in the vampire's caring eyes. His venom pools in his mouth, burning his tongue and throat. His fangs slide down, but he keeps his jaw clenched shut.
The orange fires of Hell blazed, charring the shredded remains of his skin. Ruby cackled as she slit her wrist and dripped her blood into Sam's mouth. Azazel chortled as he stabbed John in the heart with blades and daggers; he flicked his evil yellow eyes, and flames engulfed Mary's body. Meg's partner in crime thrusted a knife into Bobby's stomach. Dean resisted against the restraints, the hooks further tearing his flesh from his bones. Much as he tried, he could not break free. He screamed from the agonizing pain and the frustration. Teasing him in that whiny, effeminate voice of his, Alistair showed off a huge, rusty needle. His pleas for mercy went unanswered. Dean bellowed from the stinging, throbbing pain. Dean's savior,
Thank you all again so very much!! Enjoy!!
Known I'd need
When Jack was seated, Judge Death instructed, "You may proceed, Mr. Kline."
But, with no sign of Kelly or the British Men of Letters,  Sam, Dean and Castiel were enjoying a much deserved night off. When Sam and Dean drove into town for snacks, Castiel accompanied them. From the red colored box inside the grocery store, Castiel rented Rent.
I hope you all enjoy chapter two. God bless you all!! üìø
In the midst of the worst storm of the summer, Dean has not made it home. As a result, Castiel's life is about to fall apart in the worst way.
By the time Castiel finished popping popcorn and Sam brought candy and soda from the kitchen, Dean had already settled into a spot on the couch. Castiel could not contain his giddiness as he sat down beside Dean. They heard Sam chuckle as he pressed play on the DVD player.
There was only one hitch. Dean hated the idea of abandoning Sam. Ever since they were kids, Dean had always taken care of Sam. Hell, Dean had raised Sam into the man he was. Dean had promised that he would never leave him. He couldn't stand to break that decades old oath. After the tragic deaths of their parents and Bobby and Jess, Sam's college sweetheart, that vow was a sacred one to the both of them.
"It's Jo. Isn't it?" Castiel surmised. Dean's eyes fell for a second. "It is Jo! You cheated on me with that cheap little bar skank!"
They sat in silence for a long time, the only sounds being the sloshing of Dean's beer and the occasional slurp of Sam's bitter. Sam wished that Dean would get drunk. He wished that Dean would do anything besides stare.
'And Dean is 6"1'. They wear the same clothing size; is that right?'
Undoing. But
The monsters
The guards helped him lie down on the table of torture, the end of the green mile. They bound his arms and legs so that he could not move. Thanks be to God, this was the last time he would be tied down like a hog headed to the slaughter. It was funny. They all thought that they were punishing him. Dean considered it good fortune they did not realize they were giving him the peace he had always longed for.
The bailiff chided them, and they quieted down.
'NO, I DIDN'T!' Anna bellowed.
Sam shook his head. "Don't say that."
But there was something else, too.
Ever had.
On one of the music channels, Castiel had stumbled upon Rent. It drew him in right away. The cast was dancing on a filthy old subway train and singing about opening up a restaurant in New Mexico. The music was catchy and upbeat. The characters were so interesting. One of the boys was wearing a skirt and flowery leggings.
"How could you do this to me, you weak, spineless son-of-a-bitch!" Castiel screamed.
Anael squeezed Sam's shoulder as she passed and flashed the Winchesters a soft smile that seemed to say, 'I hope I helped.' She had. She had been warm and open and not at all dramatic this time around. Sam just prayed that it was enough to persuade Judge Death, and Dean was just grateful that somebody still believed in his devotion to Castiel.
'I think I'm in love with you.'
As he watched the fever assault Dean, Benny worried that his friend would die. He felt so powerless. What could he do? Was there anything in Monster Heaven that could save a human, he wondered?
Around.
Screech of
Am a Fallen
Still, Castiel wished that he could do more for Dean. But what? Of course, he was sure that a big, tough, handsome man like Dean would not want his hand held or anything mushy like that.
"Years ago, when my brothers and I were leaving a bar one night, we heard a man getting beaten up in an alley," Gabriel told them. "I begged Castiel not to get involved. Every day of my life, I wish he would have listened to me. Then Dean Winchester would be dead instead of my brother. But Castiel loved Dean too much, and look where it got him: the grave. Castiel loved the Bible, more than anyone I've ever known. Like Michael said, Castiel loved the parts about forgiveness.  But I read the Bible too, and it says, 'An eye for an eye.' Castiel saved Dean's life, and Dean took Castiel's life. It seems like 'An eye for an eye' is the only fitting punishment for this crime."
Dean watched in helpless horror as Lucifer's angel blade pierced Castiel's heart. White light glowed from Castiel's mouth, eyes and chest as if he were a jack o lantern on Halloween night. The Devil cackled as Castiel's body collapsed on the ground with a loud thud.
Outside, Sam was building the pyre. Castiel would have a hunter's funeral. They would salt and burn his bones, and he would have the peace that he deserved. No more vengeful angels would be after him. No more demons would try to kill him. No more ungrateful humans would take him for granted.
God bless!! ‚úù üìø üôè
Castiel was beautiful, physically, emotionally and spiritually. He'd been in love with him for years, but he'd been too stubborn to admit it to himself. For so long, he'd felt like it was improper for him to love him. But, as they kissed, Dean saw how wrong he was. There was nothing sinful about this. In the depths of his soul, he knew that this was right.
Dean fell even deeper in love with Castiel than he had ever thought possible.
"Dean‚Ä¶"
Ruby's stomach twisted. She wished she could have brought her crackers in from the car, but the rules forbade eating inside of the building. It was just as well. It wasn't like she had an appetite anyway. She just wanted something to soothe the awful nausea
Thank you so much for reading!!
Not matter that
Cass was gone.
No more burdens
But Dean could feel the smile spreading across Castiel's face. It gave him hope. Really, hope was what he needed most. Still, Dean held his breath, trying to brace himself for imminent heartbreak. After all the terrible things he'd said and done to Cass, how could he expect his feelings to be reciprocated?
The blackness of night descended on the Impala as it raced down the empty highway. The Colorado mountains faded away as they drove east, back towards the bunker. Classic rock hummed from the radio on a low volume so that Sam could sleep.
Inside the building, nurses and attendants rushed to bring them a gurney. Castiel gingerly lowered Dean onto the bed. Before he could finish covering him with blankets, the nurses were shoving him away. But Dean grabbed a hold of Castiel's arm and held on for dear life.
A frantic Castiel paced back and forth between the foggy glass windows and his cell phone charging on the table. Dean hadn't called or text in hours. Before the storm hit, Dean grabbing a beer with Sam hadn't seemed like such a big deal. Now, Castiel found himself praying with all of his heart for his spouse to just be alright.
With all of her heart, she longed to tell Sam. It would bring him so much joy when he found out. But she knew it would be wrong to share with him now. At this time, it was imperative that he give his brother his full attention. Also, she did not want such wonderful news to forever carry the horrible scars of this reprehensible tragedy.
Marriage had always terrified Dean. The thought of being tied down to one person was unnatural. He never understood how Sam could be happy sleeping with Ruby every night for the rest of his life. There were millions of people out there and billions of experiences to undertake. Monogamy meant the end to exploration and the beginning of monotony.
"Okay," said the judge.
"Anna?" Dean asked.
Like most people, Dean found music therapeutic. Hence, Sam had no choice in tunes in the Impala. But, almost no one knew how beautifully Dean sang. Despite the super cool machismo he displayed, Dean could be very shy. He kept his amazing voice a secret.
"'I am an angel in a land of abominations. There have been things hunting me since day one!'" Castiel affirms.
Outside, the police had set up a perimeter around the house. Yellow crime scene tape separated soaking wet spectators from the spectacle. Castiel's older brother, Michael, held their sisters Naomi and Anna as they sobbed and shook in the grief and the cold. The girls were pitiful and terrifying as they screamed at him, their drenched dark hair clinging to their pretty faces. Michael glared at him in such a way that Dean suspected Michael might just attack him right then and there, police be damned. Michael was a tough son-of-a-bitch, but he wasn't stupid. He remained with his sisters, but he would get his revenge, no doubt.
At home, Sam took Ruby to bed. As they made love, Sam released all of the twisted emotions coursing through him in the healthiest way he could think of. In Ruby's arms, he felt safe and loved. Against her soft body, he could be rough and physical, but never so much as to hurt her. When she moaned, he finally felt as though he could accomplish something positive for the people he cared about. As Sam floated on the high from his endorphins, he knew that he would succeed in saving Dean the next day.
Dean bares his soul to Castiel. Does Castiel feel the same?
Maybe everything was still fine. True, Dean was not with Sam. But that did not mean that he was with someone else. It was not fair to think such terrible things about Dean.
With unsteady hands, Dean offered Castiel the beer. As Cass accepted it, he noticed the shake in Dean's hands. He frowned in concern.
"Hello?" A woman's groggy voice asked.
Not ever
"Benny," he hisses, not looking up from his work. "What do you want?"
Relief coursed through his blood and calmed his anxiety as Castiel rushed to the door. He could not wait to hold Dean in his arms. He couldn't wait to share a passionate kiss. He could not wait to make love to the husband he adored.
' Castiel used to be one of the finest soldiers in his garrison. He could've killed Dean with one hand if he wanted to.'
'So, it isn't that Dean was physically overpowering Castiel, is it? If Castiel wanted to, he could have fought back?'
"Goodnight Ruby."
Love, Dean"
Tears of gratitude streamed down Dean's cheeks and soaked his joyful smile. Castiel was the most incredible sight in the whole world. That was Dean's exact thought on the night they met. But it was even more true now. His eyes of the sky were sparkling, and he was glowing with happiness. He was dashing in that suit, but Dean could not wait to get him back into his trusty trench coat.
There they were, those three little words Dean could never make himself say. In one short sentence, he'd knocked down the wall around his heart. If Castiel had not been holding him, Dean would have collapsed from the terror and the emotional exhaustion.
Dean and Castiel are in love.
"I want to thank you for protecting Dean," Castiel says.
For almost ten years, Castiel had been using his powers to cure Dean. But those wounds had always been physical. With those five beautiful words, Castiel had healed every emotional pain Dean had ever felt. With those five beautiful words, never in his life had Dean disappointed John, failed Sam, shamed Mary or angered Bobby. With those five beautiful words, Dean carried no scars from Hell or Purgatory or the Mark of Cain.
I seek your gaze.
'Was it because your allegations of abuse are exaggerated?'
'No!' She protested.
Castiel was all that Dean had in this world. Castiel was Dean's only source of unconditional love. How would Dean cope if Castiel divorced him?
Benny can't stifle a laugh. "Yeah, I don't doubt that."
It was John's aspiration that his sons would be like the sword to the whetstone. That they should make each other sharper and stronger: but that was not the case. They were fire and ice, beautiful and powerful in their own rights, but incompatible.
"I was not crazy about Dean Winchester when my brother first brought him home," Anael whispered. "I thought he was snarky, and he demanded so much of my brother without ever really appreciating him. And I am disgusted to learn that he slept with my sister, though I blame her more than I blame Dean." Anael scowled at Anna, who shifted in her seat. "But, I want to tell you a story that changed my mind about them and their relationship.
But it does
Despite the heat, Ruby felt chills all over her body when she heard the clanking of locks and the ominous rattle of chains. Sam's grip tightened on her hand. Ruby prayed that it would all be over quickly.
Yet, the actual words were still a punch to the gut. The state acknowledged what he had done and was calling him out on it. People he did not know we're casting judgment upon him. Sam had failed (in his own mind at least), and the look of disappointment on his face added on to Dean's feelings of guilt. Jack was losing Dean in some way or another. Even though he'd found a home with his aunts and uncles, they could never fill Castiel and Dean's shoes. Castiel and Dean had stepped up from the moment his mother had died. Forever and all time, Castiel and Dean would be Jack's parents.
As they walked towards the living room, Castiel noticed the envious expression on Dean's handsome face. Castiel would have been lying if he claimed that Dean's jealousy did not please him. Sometimes, he couldn't help but feel like Dean took him for granted; Dean expected Castiel to come when he called, and he always did, without fail. Dean's green eyed monster made Castiel feel appreciated.
2500 hits!! Never in my wildest dreams!! Thank you all from the bottom of my heart!! I am so blessed!!
He should have
Anna had dealt him a devastating blow. True, he didn't care very much what sort of sentence the judge imposed on him. But he did not want Sam and Jack to know about him and Anna. It was painful for Dean to look at Sam after the bomb was dropped, but he willed himself to turn to his brother.
"'Sam has the flu'?" Castiel's voice fell. "Where could Dean be?"
Today was different. Today, he relished hearing those words. Today, he would wake up from his nightmare.
I couldn't do it. I love Destiel and Dean too much to have him be abusive and adulterous and not change his ways. I'm still reeling from Castiel's death in 15x18 and i couldn't let him actually die in my story.
'No it's not!'
When Dean didn't respond, and Sam started turning blue from not breathing, Sam asked again, "Dean?"
Thank you all so much for reading!! I am sorry it took so long to post. I have other chapters written but this one was requested. So it took me a little while especially with Thanksgiving and work.
Peace.
1376 hits on this story!! Thank you all so so much!! I feel more and more blessed each time I log on to AO3!! God bless you all!!
Dean threw his arms around Castiel and buried his head in his shoulder. Castiel's embrace was the greatest feeling in the world. What a joy it was to feel Cass's heart beating against his. A grateful grin spread across Dean's face, a grin of pure joy, a grin that only Castiel alone could coax out of him.
Not matter
Sirens wailed in the distance. Tires groaned in the mud and the puddles. Rain and the wind howled like wolves. Dean's and Jack's sobs masked one last shallow breath. Unbeknownst to them, these sounds were making up the soundtrack of the destruction of everything that the Winchesters held dear.
So many of you have already read and liked the first chapter. I couldn't ask for a better birthday gift. Thank you all so much for making me feel so blessed.
Dean's heart started doing somersaults. His breaths were rapid with excitement and anticipation. He longed to run to the angel like a child reunited with his parents. But he couldn't move. He was too afraid that it wasn't real. If this was not really Castiel, Dean feared that he would die from the disappointment.
The prison doctor scrubbed his arm with alcohol. It was an ironic indignity. He had no reason to fret about the possibility of an infection from an IV. The state was so worried about exact protocol that they lost all of their common sense.
"What are you talking about?" Ruby sounded so confused. And if she were answering the phone, Sam must have been at home. Castiel felt his stomach twist into a pretzel knot.
In Castiel's embrace, Dean made a silent oath to himself and to the Lord. He swore he would never cheat on Castiel. He promised he would never again lay a hand on his beloved. But, most of all, Dean vowed to appreciate all of the good things he had in his life.
Sam went in for the kill, his voice louder and more forceful with confidence. 'Castiel may have been a consenting adult, but your nephew, Jack, was in the house. Jack was witnessing this alleged violence, and you did nothing to protect him! Isn't that true, Anna?'
Watch him fade
Bring the message
The guards pulled Dean into the chamber. It felt like being inside of an aluminum can, all metallic and reeking of unnatural odors. Black curtains blocked his view of the spectators. It would have helped to see Sammy. Dean's nerves were beginning to go haywire, despite his acceptance of the inevitable. The sight of the IV tubes sent shivers down his spine and weakened his knees. His legs almost gave out, and he stumbled forward.
In the past, Sam would come to check on his brother, only to find Castiel perched on the edge of the bed. Without waking him, Cass would cover Dean with his wings and chant in Enochian until he calmed down. Once a good dream replaced the bad one, Cass would watch Dean sleep until morning. Since Dean hated when Cass watched him sleep, Cass would then disappear when Dean started to stir.
The disappointment and anger in Sam's eyes were devastating. It was enough to drive Dean out of his skin. What was he if not for Sam's protector? Since he was four years old, his whole identity was constructed around his role as Sam Winchester's loyal big brother. Without Sam to guard, and with Castiel gone, who was Dean Winchester???
Even though they had never been very close, Sam's stomach twisted every time he saw a guard leading a shackled Dean to and fro. Growing up, Dean had been his role model. Back then, Dean always did the right thing, or what he thought was right at least. Sam could not fathom how it had come to this.
"Cass!" Dean cried out.
"You're actually blaming me because you screwed somebody else! You can go straight to hell!"
Castiel would always remember the terror he felt when he first checked on the man; he thought that there was no way he would recover from his injuries. His skin was coated in blood and bruises. It became apparent that he was unconscious when he couldn't respond to anything Castiel did to rouse him.
Sam cleared his throat. "He'll come around." Castiel glanced up at Sam with hopeful eyes. "I think it's going to take a while for him to admit it to himself, but he'll come around."
"You think Cass was my soulmate?" Dean squeaked.
The temperature in the box boiled. Ruby surmised that this was what Hell was like. It was fire and brimstone. It was the transfer of sorrow and pain from one person to another. It was pain and pride. It was revenge. It was frightening. It was inhumane. It was barbaric.
I am a huge Jared/Gen Sam/Ruby shipper. I love them together. And I'm a huge fan of Gen Padalecki currently obsessed with Wildfire lol üêé üíò ‚úå ü¶É
"It's better than him being killed because of me! And you, too!" Castiel cries out. On its own, the heat of Benny's anger cools as he listens to the angel. "Dean cares so much about you. It would destroy him if anything happened to you."
Dean threw his arms around Castiel with such force that he pushed his partner against the wall inadvertently. Dean nuzzled into Castiel's neck and breathed in his scent. He was clutching Castiel so tightly that Castiel's shirt was bunching up. But he couldn't let go. He remembered those lonesome nights in his cell (which still felt so damn real), when he would tell himself that he'd never loosen his grip on Castiel if he ever got to hold him again.
Sam was right.
Nevertheless, Dean would be braver than he'd ever been in his life.
Supposed
If Castiel dies, things will be a lot better for Benny. They won't have to worry about constant ambushes anymore. He won't have to listen to the strange things the angel says or watch as Dean and Castiel swoon over each other any more. He won't have to worry about dying at the border anymore. He won't have to share Dean any more.
"There is no one that compares with you."
With caution, Dean's eyes shifted to the needle, then back to Castiel. 'Don't leave me.'
"What are you talking about?" Dean queried.
Dead Man Walking has been one of my favorite books/movies since i was a kid. This chapter is heavily inspired by Dead Man Walking.
"I love you and Jack, and you love me, and we are going to stay a family," Dean declared.
And we would
I cannot thank you all enough. So many people have read the first chapter and left kudos. My Supernatural family has been so good to me at this difficult time when I feel my grief so much harder. I am so blessed to have such wonderful people in my life. Please know how much you all mean to me. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.üòª
Dean Winchester could not live without Castiel. Dean had needed Castiel from the moment he woke up in his warm arms and gazed into his sky blue eyes. He needed him when he was happy, and when he was sad, and when he was sick. He needed him for all time.
The DJ announced the final dance of the night. Dean was thrilled to at last be able to go home and be alone with the man he loved. Even better than that, he was about to leave this place with no thoughts of Anna or Anael or any of the trashy skeezers he'd met in the bar. Tonight, and for every night from there on out, he would think of no one but Castiel.
After they got off of the train, Angel bought Tom Collins a warm new coat. It was a great kindness, as Collins had been mugged of his coat and all of his belongings. They then confessed their love for each other in a beautiful song, called "I'll Cover You." The song melted Castiel's heart. It was simple and sweet and moving.
Grinning, Dean Winchester grabbed Castiel and kissed him, right there in the middle of the store.
His mind swam back to the night they watched Rent together. Cass comforted him when flashbacks from Hell tormented him. But Dean was too much of a man to accept his kindness. All he'd done was hold his hand. And, in the deepest depths of his soul, was that not what Dean wanted more than anything else in the world, to hold Cass's hand? Couldn't Dean have just counted his blessings? But, no, Dean had to push Cass away, and now he would never see Cass again.
Thank you so much everyone! God bless you!!
Friend I have
Dean comes up with some nonsense defense of his angel, rationalizing, "'We were surrounded. One of the monsters probably got the jump on Cass, and he got his was kicked, right?'"
"Hello Dean."
"It took eight years for him to hold my hand," Castiel sighed.
Supposed
That thirst for your
Thank you to everyone who has read this story and enjoyed it! It means the world to me!
For you to look
Makes us weak.
What if Dean was dead?
Any time Dean needed help, Castiel always told him to turn to God. Before he met Castiel, Dean had never been the praying type. He thought God was too busy to care about his problems, if He even existed. But Castiel was devout, and it seemed as though God almost always answered his prayers.
'I never said what I was most grateful for. You.' Castiel had beamed. Dean had removed a tiny velvet box from his pocket and opened it, revealing a smooth gold band. Castiel had gasped. 'I love you Castiel. I need you. I want to be with you always. Will you marry me?'
In between blows, Castiel struggled to catch his breath. But no matter what he did, he could not get any air into his lungs. He began to cough up blood. It occurred to him that he might die at the hand of the person he loved more than life itself. If he died, what would happen to Jack? To Dean?
Then, the pianist played the music to John Lennon's "Happy Xmas". It was Castiel's favorite Christmas song. Dean's heart raced a triathlon as Castiel appeared in the doorway, escorted by his parents, Chuck and Amara Shirley.
'Will you, Dean Winchester, take Castiel Shirley as your lawfully wedded husband?'
Heartbreak sets in on Dean, and his face falls. '"No?'" The angel cannot even meet his eyes. "'I prayed to you, Cass, every night!'"
Forgive him
Castiel knew of the evil that Alastair was capable of, and he just had to intervene. Castiel jumped into the scuffle, catching Alastair off guard and shoving him away from the man. His brothers were quick to join in, and once they did, Castiel pulled the man to safety. Gabriel and Balthazar pounded on Alastair while Castiel tended to the victim.
'Anna, you testified earlier that Castiel would come to your house with black eyes and lacerations on his face?'
How would Dean live without Cass? Who would he confide in when he felt he could trust no one else? Who would make him laugh without even trying? Who would heal all of his physical and emotional wounds? How would he ever feel safe again without Castiel?
"Let go of me!" Castiel demanded. He wiggled and tugged, but he was unable to free himself from Dean's grasp.
Dean's lips were soft and warm and tasted of catnip tea. The kiss was intoxicating. Benny felt unsteady and giddy as he paused to look at his partner. Despite the illness, Dean was glowing. Benny could not believe that God would create something as divine as Dean Winchester for a beast like him. It was too good to be true.
Castiel's heart stopped for a moment.
'You stayed with me.'
560 hits on this story. WOW!! Thank you all so very much!! I feel so very blessed!!
It was enough to make the man dizzy. But he was able to state his name: Dean. Dean. Castiel would always remember how he tasted the name on his tongue, how perfect it sounded, how delicious it was. Dean. Dean. He introduced himself and his brothers, still enjoying the delicacy that was Dean. Dean.
Nevertheless, despite Dean's efforts, Castiel showed no signs of life.
Several hours later, Castiel stretched his stiff body, never letting go of Dean's hand. 'I promised I would.'
Dean knew he would never forget the look of hatred and betrayal he saw in Gabriel's eyes as he was forced to restrain his nephew. His usually playful face was twisted with anger and hurt. The skin around his eyes was pink, but he was fighting back his tears.
When they got to the hospital, Castiel carried Dean in his arms as if he were a small child. He didn't know where this strength was coming from; he attributed it to God and the power of Love. It was his destiny to save Dean. Of this he was certain.
Ensure no harm
I hope everyone had the most wonderful Christmastime!! Mine was just perfect and I could not feel any more blessed!!
It hadn't been the most spectacular proposal. Dean hadn't gotten down on one knee in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, though Lord knew Castiel deserved as much. It was Thanksgiving night. ü¶É Castiel had just finished cleaning up the cakes and cookies he'd served their brothers and sisters. He was covered in frosting and dish soap and gravy. He was a mess, but Dean loved him most when he was at his silliest.
Fly, and you are
Then, as they lay together for the first time as a married couple, Dean had kissed the top of Castiel's head and told him 'I need you.'
Sam touched Dean and shook him. "DEAN! DEAN!" Dean leaped out of his skin and prepared to throw punches. "It's okay. It's me. You were having a nightmare."
Sam was a good man. He did not deserve any of this. He had endured enough. But the worst was yet to come. She could not imagine how her sensitive, sweet husband could bear this. Hell, she wasn't even sure that she could stand it. Except, Sam needed her, and she would always be by his side,  no matter what. They would get through this together, just as they fought all of their battles together.
Later that night, at the kitchen table, Sam handed Dean a cold bottle of beer. Dean accepted it, but, instead of drinking it, he spun it around in small circles. Sam frowned, but did not complain. Earlier, he had tried to coax Dean into eating some greasy burgers, to no avail.
Dean was about to find the one thing that had always been missing from his life.
'"These aren't just monsters, Dean. They're Leviathans. I've been trying to stay one step ahead of them to keep them away from you,"' Castiel tells him, his voice and eyes so heavy with sincerity that even Benny believes him.
"I never told him, Sammy."
It was easy for anybody to get why she was the life of every party. Anael was the most beautiful woman Dean had ever laid eyes on. Even now, with tears leaking from her caramel colored eyes and her long strawberry chestnut hair tied into a messy bun, all of the men in the courtroom did a double take as she walked by. Judge Death himself seemed to perk up at the sight of such a rare blossom.
Benny couldn't be sure. But he had a strange feeling when Dean gazed at him. A sad expression would flash across the hunter's face every so often. Benny couldn't help sensing that Dean was seeing somebody else when he looked in Benny's eyes. Maybe. Maybe not. Perhaps Benny was being too sensitive. Perhaps his time in Purgatory had jaded him, and this was all happening too fast. He didn't know.
'Just take me home. I'll be fine.'
The latter proved much more difficult than Benny could have imagined the longer he and Dean kissed. His body yearned for Dean's. But he was too afraid to take it any further than kissing. Dean was still sick, and he tired out a short while later. On top of that, Benny could not get over his fear of breaking or biting Dean.
But Dean shook his head and answered, "No, Your Honor."
'It is a big deal, isn't it?'
"If something happens to me, I don't think Dean could handle it on his own, especially not here. Please promise me that you'll keep him safe."
I really like this chapter and was super eager to post it. I hope you like it!!
Regardless of his reasons for being away from home, there still existed the possibility that Dean was hurt. Nothing Dean could do could ever make Castiel stop loving him. Nothing could keep him from worrying about his soul mate.
No. Ruby was right. Sam was incapable of running from his emotions. He was not like Dean. In this regard, he did not want to be like his brother. If Dean had had better control of his feelings and healthier ways to express them, Sam believed that both Dean and Castiel would still be here.
The sweet sounds of "In My Life" by the Beatles filled the room. Young lovers and old married couples swayed to the beautiful ballad. Although Dean was not much of a dancer, and neither was Castiel in all actuality, Dean pulled his husband onto the wooden floor. There never was such a perfect song for such a moment, for everything Dean had just gone through and everything Dean had taken from the experience.
"Sam and Dean went out for drinks tonight, and Dean hasn't come back, and with this storm I'm really worried‚Ä¶" Castiel rambled on.
'We weren't born yesterday. We knew he wasn't boxing against Muhammad Ali.'
No miracles occurred. Chuck and Amara had left, yet again. The angels weren't responding. Crowley had sacrificed himself to save the Winchesters.
Sam said I should write a statement for the court, telling them how much you meant to me and how sorry I am for what I did to you. But how the hell am I supposed to do that, Cass? How do I make a bunch of strangers understand how much I need you? Nobody will ever get it besides you. You were my best friend. My family. You were the only person who's ever loved me. You were the only person crazy enough to take a chance on me and to believe in me. I put you through hell and you still stayed by my side. No matter what I did, you always forgave me. You always made me believe that I was a good man, even though most of the time I wasn't. You encouraged me to try to be better without making me feel small. When I was sick or hurt, you took all the pain away. You did everything for me. The day we met, when I woke up in your arms and gazed into your big blue eyes, I thought that I'd died and you were an angel taking me to Heaven. You are an angel, Cass. You always have been. Sam said I didn't know what I had until it was gone. But he's wrong. I knew exactly how special you were, and I knew I could never live without you. That's why I did what I did. I hate myself for how weak I was, how stupid I was. I should never have taken you away. I should have been strong enough to let you go, and maybe you would have found it in your heart to forgive me someday. I know you would have. You were pure good through and through. Jack forgives me because he learned from you, and Anael too. I'm trying to figure out how to forgive myself so that I can see you after they shoot me up with their poisons. But I'm having a hard time because all I want is to hear you telling me that everything will be okay, that I can do anything I set my mind too, that you'll always be right beside me. Your belief in me is what used to get me through the day. Now it's the certainty of death and reuniting with you in Paradise that gets me out of bed everyday. I think Sam is right though. Not about the courts. Screw the judge and jury. Once they do their civil duties they won't give either of us a second thought. But I do think I should say it to you. I just wish you could hear it from me. Because, Castiel, I can't tell you how sorry I am. God I'm so sorry. I die every minute of every day because of how much I miss you. I'm sorry for hurting both of our families. I'm sorry for all the times I hit you and cursed at you. I'm sorry for not being half the man that you deserved, half the man you believed I was. I'm sorry for not loving you like I should have. I'm sorry for breaking your heart. I'm sorry for betraying you in the worst of ways. I'm sorry I let my insecurities and low self worth destroy us both. I'm sorry I hurt you. I love you Castiel and I always will.
Benny makes a fist and counts very slowly. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10 He cannot lose control. If he goes after the angel, he could risk harming Dean. He just can't do that.
I just had to talk about this with my Supernatural family because i know you guys would understand. My friendship/relationship is just like Destiel: it's canon but I still want more. üíü
But, in that moment, Dean clutched the love of his life and mourned over the consequences of the wicked mistakes he'd made. It was as if nothing else existed apart from Dean, Castiel and their broken bond. Dean had no way of seeing what was coming because he was stuck in the sands of what he'd done.
"Michael Shirley," Judge Death called.
When he could breathe again, he succumbed, time of night be damned. Castiel picked up his phone and dialed Sam's cell phone number. Each ring brought a new sense of dread. Maybe something had happened to Sam too. What if they were both injured? What if they were trapped in a ditch somewhere, bloody and soaked to the skin?
Empowered by Cass's kindness, Dean continued, "It's more than that. I didn't want to live without you, Cass. I‚Ä¶ I can't live without you."
Dean Winchester was the most attractive thing Benny had ever seen: male or female, human or vampire. Those damn green Bambi eyes could drive any one wild. His lips and cheeks were pink and plump and full of life. It was such a welcome change from the undead monsters Benny hung around day in and day out for all these years.
Wings around you
It had been a long time since Dean had been with a woman. Oh, he loved Castiel, and he had no intention of ever living without him. But Dean still found himself very attracted to women. And there was something so tantalizing about Anna's movements. It was enough to drive Dean wild.
Hurt him as
Castiel would have been lying if he said he wasn't tempted. But he shook his head and asserted, "You will never share my bed again Dean Winchester!!"
Even if those same things that he adored also made him crazy.
Hanging up the phone, Dean pressed the gas pedal to the floor board. He gripped the steering wheel with such force that his knuckles had turned white. Dean could see Sam holding on to the seat for dear life as the Impala bounced over bumps and skidded on slippery roads. But Dean did not even consider slowing down. Dean could think of nothing but Castiel.
"Just don't stop us from getting the hell out of here."
In law school, Sam had no intention of pursuing criminal defense law. He thought he would be a prosecutor, responsible for keeping the public safe. Or maybe he would become a divorce or personal injury attorney and live a comfortable life with no financial concerns.
Most of all, Benny is annoyed at this lame excuse for an angel that they are dragging around Purgatory, pretty much against his own will. Castiel doesn't make a lick of sense when he speaks, which gets on Benny's nerves. And he's a danger magnet. Dean's in love with Castiel, so that's also fun for Benny.
Their days were consumed with searching for Castiel. Every monster they came across, they caught and interrogated. Nobody ever seemed able to help. But Dean was hell bent on finding the angel, and Benny was always eager to lend a hand if it meant them getting the hell out of Purgatory.
"'The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want.  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Ye though I may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me'," the Priest read from the Bible.
But, in private, Dean liked to sing. It allowed him to express his emotions without going all Dr. Phil like Sam did. Mostly, he liked to sing country and classic rock, to himself of course. Broadway, well, that was another story. Still...
Even then, Benny hadn't imagined himself liking Dean that way. It caught him off guard one day as they were hunting for someone, any one, who knew the whereabouts of the angel. Months of malnutrition and lack of medicine had begun to take its toll on Dean's mortal body. He'd developed a high fever and a wicked case of the chills. Despite Dean's stubborn refusal to quit, Benny insisted that they rest a while. Benny found a small cave near a lake that they could use for shelter. After he inspected it for any signs of danger, they took respite inside its cool walls.
Castiel stayed put as the nurses and doctors treated Dean. They taped bandages to him and iced his bruises. They shot medicines into his tubes. Castiel's stomach churned as they sewed Dean's torn skin shut, and he could no longer watch.
"We have, Your Honor," answered the jury foreman. He handed a folded piece of paper to the bailiff, who passed it on to the judge.
RING! RING! RING! üì±
Reach out to you
Cass was gone.
The sedative administered in the first injection was working well, and he could not feel the agony of the life being drained from his body. But his time was drawing to a close. His bright green eyes could not remain open. But Dean resisted sleep just long enough to mouth 'I love you' to his little brother. It was fortunate that his eyelids clamped shut before any more tears could fall from Sam's puffy pink eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you so much to everyone who has read my story. I am so grateful!!
"Cass‚Ä¶"
He felt good to be giving others the second chance at life that Ruby had given him. After Jessica died, he thought he had endured more loss than he could bear. But Ruby's kindness, love and tenacity had glued the pieces of Sam's broken heart back together. It was his goal in life to make her proud and happy, and to return the blessings her love had bestowed upon him.
"He cares about you more," Benny grumbles. "He has no problem killing me if it means saving you."
Castiel could hear Ruby struggling for the right words. In their marriage, Sam was the more emotional one, while Ruby remained level headed. But she did care, and she was trying her best to help.
Dean would also miss Jack something awful. But he would be fine as well. Gabriel, Balthazar, Anael, Naomi and Anna were doing their best to help him heal and providing him with a nice new life. In a lot of ways, Dean thought that Jack would be better off when Dean was gone.
Unhear the
I need him
'Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you as husband and husband.'
Benny had been alive long enough to read more books and articles than any professor in any university. He'd had a particular interest in psychology. Understanding the human mind helped him hunt for food. It made it easier for him to lure in his prey. Somehow he was able to recall that humans release dopamine when they are attracted to somebody.
'Yes, but he wouldn't even consider it... Until he found out about Dean and Jo.'
Dean blinked back tears, and Sam swallowed hard.
"Who is it?" Castiel repeated.
Billie knew that he wanted to die, and yet she commanded that he live. She told him that he had work to do. But he didn't want to try anymore. It was not worthwhile to him. And what the Hell happened to Free Will? Didn't he have a choice? Without Castiel, there was no Free Will, and there was no team, either.
Everything was fine. It was just the storm. He'd had to wait the storm out at the bar. There could be no other reason.
At first, the sight of him is a most welcome blessing. For months, Benny has been helping Dean search these dark, foreboding woods in the hopes of locating his friend, the angel Castiel. They've interrogated and killed numerous beasts, some of them Benny's former allies, all in the name of this one angel. In that respect, it's rewarding to have found him at last.
Dean wondered what would become of him. Deep down, he knew he couldn't hunt anymore. He didn't have the heart for it anymore. But, he couldn't give up this life, either. He'd erased Lisa's memories, and he could not go back to her as he had after Sam leaped into the Cage. Nor would he be able to work a 9-5 knowing that his little brother was out there putting himself in danger.
We are not
But Dean felt nothing. Numbness. Like when Dr. Fitzgerald shot him up with Novocain to fill his cavity, after the medicine kicked in and well after Dean cursed him out for that terrifying injection. Numbness. Dean was afraid of dying, but he also welcomed it.
The question caught both Winchesters off guard. Dean's powerful green eyes flashed at his brother. Sam's own boldness surprised him. But he had to hear it. It was a damn shame that Cass couldn't, but Sam had to know, for all of their sakes.
'I hate needles.'
Castiel rubbed Dean's back and kissed the top of his head. It almost brought Dean to his knees. His heart came close to exploding with love and thankfulness for his soul mate, his best friend, his honest-to-God angel.
It sounded so real, as if Castiel were in the room at that very moment, uttering the words that led Dean to fall in love with him.
Jack, Michael and Anna share their victim statements with the court.
Dean relied on Benny for warmth and protection as he slept. Every night, they would whisper to each other before Dean went to bed. They discussed their families and their plans for when they got out. They talked about sports and music and cars.
'It's not that bad, but if Cas were here, he could heal him.' Sam thought. He shook his head. It didn't do any good to think like that. Then, something else occurred to Sam.
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Dean would never see Cass again.
In his eyes
But, Dean had taught Castiel that the right answer to that question was, "I'm fine."
As if I am
The ugly mess of
Didn't he
Castiel would have hated to see his happy-go-lucky brother Balthazar in such a state.
Now, watching Castiel approach him,  wearing his finest military dress uniform and bearing a smile so brilliant that even his eyes were sparkling, Dean thought that he had never seen anything more beautiful in all his days. He wanted to tear Castiel away from Amara. Dean wanted to hold Castiel as close as he could and never let go.
"I love you too, Dean."
"No you don't, Sam, not like this," Dean stated. "I never got to have Cass. Jess was the perfect dream girl that you could've brought home to Mom and Dad if our lives weren't so screwed up."
And still I feel
"You can't leave me."
If Castiel dies, it will destroy Dean. Benny remembers every detail of the death of his mate, Andrea. It had been agony, so much worse than the decapitation. It is helplessness and rage and grief and sorrow and frustration and despair all rolled into one hideous ball of emptiness that unravels over time and never leaves the spirit. It is a pain no one should have to endure.
Dean gazed at Cass, savoring every bit of the angel's incredible beauty. There never was a being as beautiful as Cass: so giving and so devoted, even to his own detriment. No matter how much time passed, Dean would never be able to repay the good fortune he'd been blessed with when Castiel joined his family.
Castiel has replaced Benny in one way Benny cannot bear. Now, Dean snuggles with Castiel at night instead of him. Now, Dean seeks warmth and comfort in the arms of his angel. Castiel holds Dean as he sleeps while Benny keeps watch nearby.
Of course he'd had it coming. It was not appropriate for him to try to stop Dean from watching the game with his buddies. Jack would have gotten over his fever with only Castiel tending to him. Everything was fine. Dean had promised never to do it again, and Castiel knew how much he and Dean loved each other. Everything was fine.
But the nights were a different story. Dean had recovered from his illness, but he was still human. Once the sun went down, an awful cold swept over their woods. When they could, they tried to set up shelter. But it was not always possible, what with their consent moving around. More often than not, they would have to rest in groves of trees, exposed to both monsters and the elements.
'Why didn't you ever notify the police?'
Cass always knew how to make Dean feel good without getting too gushy. For that and every other wonderful thing about Castiel, he found the angel even more desirable with each passing moment. He smiled, counting down the minutes until he could snuggle up on the couch with his soulmate, a big bowl of popcorn and a bottle of beer.
Thanks again everyone and please enjoy!!
I wrap wounded
It's so easy
For a while, Dean just sat and stared at the floor. Neither of them spoke. What else was there to say? Cass was gone and they had sabotaged any potential for a Destiel relationship while he was alive. So, avoiding Sam's dark eyes, Dean got up and started to clean up the broken bottle.
Yet, he was not sure he could do it. Picking up girls was always so easy for Dean. He'd had more one night stands than he could count. But this was so different. It wasn't just about sex. It was about feelings. It was about fighting with irrational shame and fear and stigma in order to discover something true. It was a poker game where Dean was risking everything.
Thunder banged with ferocity. It made Castiel shiver. Castiel could not shake the feeling that the Lord was trying to tell him something that he just could not understand.
So Benny draped his coat over Dean and tip toed out of the cave. There just had to be something in these forests that could help his friend. For both of their sakes, he had to at least try.
Of our minds. You
Then, Dean Winchester gazed up at him with those eyes. Those damn green eyes were gorgeous and sad and fierce and soft all at once. They were glossy from the fever, and they seemed to be seeking reassurance of some kind. But they were powerful and lovely all the same.
Castiel and Dean both couldn't contain a snicker when Gabriel shouted that at them.
It's beautiful.
'No, I don't.'
When I was
Will haunt me
Can Dean really do the unthinkable to Castiel?
A maniacal, cynical laugh escaped Dean's mouth. He shook his head at his little brother. Although he would never admit it, his behavior was frightening Sam.
On the outside, there isn't anything too impressive about him. He is filthy and small. His face is so covered with muck that it is difficult to identify his skin color. Black grime stains what was once a tan trench coat. Beneath the jacket, he seems to be wearing hospital pajamas and an ID bracelet‚Ä¶ like he was sick on earth. Who has ever even heard of an angel getting sick?
"Jerk."
On knees that felt like jelly, Dean wiggled in place. The Priest placed a hand on his shoulder every so often to steady him, but it did nothing to calm his nerves. They were all just lucky Dean wasn't vomiting all over the chapel. His white dress shirt was soaked in sweat beneath the black jacket.
Hear my voice, but
But, c'mon, did Cass really want to watch another musical? They'd already sat through Rent. Wasn't that enough for a lifetime?
Thank you everyone for reading!!
Once she was seated, Anna opened up her sketch pad. Before she spoke, she shot a vengeful glare right at Sam and Dean. It gave them the chills, as if someone had quite actually walked over their graves.
Dean hated Raphael and Uriel. They had no business being there. All of the journalists and the prosecution were always doting on the poor grieving brothers. Nobody brought up how Uriel threatened Castiel when Cass fell in love with Dean. Nobody talked about the terrible beating Raphael had given Castiel when Castiel refused to obey Raphael as family patriarch. No. The media saw them as the victims, and that was that.
In all of his existence, Castiel had never felt such happiness. Despite all of the problems in the world, and there was so much to trouble them at the moment, Castiel was happy. He was enjoying a family movie night, holding hands with the love of his life. Castiel had never dared to dream that he would ever receive such blessings.
One dark, foggy night, Castiel and his brothers were leaving a pub after enjoying some burgers and brews. They were on their way to the car, laughing and planning their next outing. Then, something caught Castiel's attention. He heard the crash of metal trash cans falling and the thud of a body colliding with the ground. In a creepy alley, someone was being beaten to the brink of death. Even in the dim light, Castiel could recognize the monster of a man. Alastair. Alastair had a reputation for being a true demon, committing assaults, threatening people and reveling in every second of it.
