“What!” Tony cries and Steve knows he’s not just playing it up for their son. “No costume? No, no we will find you a costume. What do you want to be?”
Bruce nods and smiles softly. “Your papa was telling me about your morning sickness. Has it gotten any better?”
Steve chuckles. “Yes we do.”
“You sure? You won’t get bored?”
Steve was going to tell him. It was the right thing to do. Even if Tony decided he wasn’t ready and wouldn’t step up, then Steve could handle that. He was having this baby, with or without Tony.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. “It’s just...different.”
Happy mutters a curse. “Okay. Don’t panic. I can try him again and-”
“James,” Steve calls out to the older pup and steel blue eyes meet his. “You can sit here.” Steve pats the spot on his right. The pup eyes the spot for a moment, then he curls up and shakes his head. Steve sighs sadly.
Then Tony groans again and the sound goes straight to his cock. Steve shifts, wishing he wouldn’t get hard right now. They haven’t had sex lately, mostly due to Tony complaining about being tired or because he just wasn’t in the mood. That had also been weeks ago and now...now Steve was wondering if Tony would be in the mood.
The disapproving look he receives should make him cower and beg for Alpha to forgive him, but he can’t bring himself to stand down.
Peter is laid back in the bassinet and drifting to sleep. Tony decides to do the same, knowing his son will be up in a few hours to do this all over again. Only sleep never comes. He lies awake, eyes transfixed on his son’s sleeping form. He still hasn’t fully comprehended the fact that he was a father.
Tony sighs. “I know. He’s gonna be fine, Steve. If he’s anything like you, then he’ll fight this.”
Peter pauses and quickly wipes at his eyes when tears begin to fall. “He’s not you. I want to give him another chance but...is that stupid? He hasn’t done anything and...what would you do? I wish you could answer me and tell me what to do.”
While he waits for his parents to come downstairs, Peter helps himself to a piece of candy from the bowl on the coffee table, giggling when a fake hand attached to the bowl reaches down to grab him.
A small smile forms over Bucky’s lips and he sniffs, his eyes filling with fresh tears. He turns away to hide them, but Peter catches the tear rolling down his face. He can’t imagine the fear and pain his uncle must be in. He had already lost one best friend and couldn’t afford losing another, especially when that friend was his husband, the love of his life.
The sound of Morgan’s cries reaches his ears, distracting him from the battle he was having with himself. He sets the knife down and wipes his hand clean with a dish towel before making his way upstairs to get her.
“Papa!” Peter squeals in delight. “Higher! Higher!”
I’m so sorry this is on the short side! I’ve been so busy lately and life just keeps getting crazier. I thought a quick update was better than none 😆
“Hold on, Pete,” Bruce says, the grip he has on Peter’s shoulder tightens. “Sit down.”
“You can. I give you my word.”
I finally got around to getting this one updated! I can't say for sure when the next update will come but hopefully soon!
“About Pete? We’ll be home soon.”
Bucky realizes what Peter is doing and he backs off. Sam immediately holds him down and Natasha steps in to help Tony off the couch. She tries to look over the bruises and gash along Tony’s cheek, but he shrugs her off and moves away from Bucky, not wanting to risk another beat down.
“No. All of it. I wouldn’t be a good mother. You’re so calm and fearless. Everything a mother should be.”
“Your son is perfectly healthy, sir. No birth defects have been detected.”
“I told you not to run, didn’t I?” Tony sighs. “Come on. Let’s get a band-aid.”
“But...it was hard, right?”
“I know. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you. I’d probably be dead.”
They do exactly that. Peter abandons his room, deciding to help out in the living room and sort through the items left behind. It’s difficult at first, but no one said it was going to be easy. He’s just grateful he’s not alone to do this hard task.
He’s just nervous, but he can’t help but wonder if there’s something else.
He gives up on trying to prepare himself and slips on his sunglasses. He doesn’t know what level the party is on, and thankfully Peter is waiting for him on the first floor.
Dodger is excited when Steve enters the apartment first. He rushes over to properly greet him with slobbery kisses. Steve laughs when Dodger jumps up to try and lick along his face.
Tony narrows his eyes. “Fine. I am getting bigger. It’s okay you can agree.”
Steve’s stomach churns at the compliment. He’s been called that before, back when he was still living under Hydra’s orders, back when there were other alphas. Tony wasn’t like them. Tony’s words were honest. He really believed that Steve was beautiful.
Tony knows what he’s referring to. The baby weight had yet to be shed completely. It was barely noticeable, but Steve noticed and obviously hated the leftover weight in his middle.
Peter pulls away with a frown.“Papa, what’s wrong?”
“With a brain like that you could help us.”
Tears are running down his face, choked sobs leaving him whenever Peter squirms and wails. Steve can’t figure out what he did wrong.
Tony smiles at her and beckons her closer, pulling her into his lap. “It’s a very big surprise for mommy. We can’t tell him okay?”
Steve couldn’t relate but he remembers putting it on for the pups before. He’d rather hear Elmo than the snotty pig.
“Mr. Pierce would have no control over him anymore.”
Harley grows bored and turns away to explore the new environment. James, the good, obedient one that he is, stays beside Tony.
“How long have you been in labor?”
“Mama,” James says, barely above a whisper, but Steve’s enhanced hearing picks up the word. Steve nods and more tears run down his face. It’s James who comforts him this time. “Don’t cry.”
“I know. It’ll be over soon.”
Tony adjusts the blanket around his son, making sure he's secure and comfortable. Peter slips free and lays a tiny hand flat on his father’s chest, bringing a smile to Tony's face.
“You okay, Cap?” Comes Sam’s voice through the comms.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to frown. Tony can’t help but grin. Of course he loved Steve. Even if he was an idiot.
Peter chokes back a sob and this time Tony pulls him into a hug. Peter clings to him tightly and sobs, not caring if he’s staining the expensive shirt his dad has on.
“But if you do want to meet him, talk to me or Nat or anyone but Buck. He’ll...it’s going to take some time for him to come around.”
“No. No that wasn’t-”
He’s greeted with red. Blood is all over the floor; the crimson stains the once white tiles. There’s smears of it on the seat of the toilet. Tony eyes shift from the terrifying scene to the trembling figure sitting against the wall. Steve peers up at him, his once sparkling blue eyes full of sadness; full of pain.
Tony can vividly picture Steve smiling. It brings more tears to his eyes and a small smile to his own face.
“But what if it is? We may have escaped with our lives when fighting against Hydra, but we didn’t come back the same. I still have nightmares. I think Tony hasn’t healed.”
“Nope. It’s fine. I love the kids and they’ll be excited. Sarah would love a sister. Lord knows the house is full of enough boys.”
The nails retract, leaving the skin bruised and broken. Steve whimpers when his hair is tugged again and he’s forced to stare into those evil eyes.
“Hey, calm down. I didn’t mean to make you upset. I just thought-”
So Tony does what he does best and keeps it all to himself. It was safer this way. Only he would get hurt. And that was better than hurting Steve.
“Tony?”
“That’s my mother’s name,” Steve explains. “She passed when I was eighteen.”
But the party, surrounded by friends and loved ones, was the exciting part. All of his family was in the same room together. His uncle Thor was able to escape his duties from Asgard and even his uncle Clint and aunt Laura came with his cousins. Peter enjoyed being around them, and could already picture his new cousin joining the clan.
“I’ll think of some-”
Bruce nods. “A lot sooner than you think.”
“As you wish.”
“There’s nothing to be scared about. I’ll be back-”
“Come find out.”
It’s late into the evening now, just hours away from a brand new day. Tony’s labor was progressing a little faster now that his water had finally broken, but there was still some time before their son was born and in their arms.
“I can’t drink that,” Steve says bitterly.
He’s reminded of the things that they did do that he probably never could’ve done with his papa. Staying up late in the lab building things was one. That was how they bonded, and Peter enjoyed those times together. And maybe one day they could go to Disney World.
Only their daughter had other ideas.
“Fuck. You feel so good.”
Tony paces around the room, gently rocking his son and lulling him to sleep. The beta that had been caring for his son has stepped out to give Tony space with his baby. She’s probably nearby just in case Peter needed assistance, but at this moment the pup was content in his father’s arms.
They’d talk later, and hopefully, they actually do it this time. Steve takes Peter into the communal living area, carefully lowering himself down on one of the empty sofas and cradling Peter in his arms. Peter doesn’t fuss, instead he keeps his gaze trained on Steve’s face, dark eyes roaming over the features he’s come to recognize.
Clint doesn’t hesitate and he scans his badge, and the door opens, revealing a medium sized room furnished with a single bed and bright lights hanging from the ceiling. Steve instantly notices the three figures huddled on the bed.
“So,” Steve starts and he moves closer until he’s near Tony. He takes a seat beside him. “I guess we should…”
“I guess.”
“You mean spy?” Happy narrows his eyes at her.
“Yeah well…” Tony takes a large drink of his wine. “You need more?” He gestures to Steve’s half empty glass.
“You should be. But I wasn’t talking about him,” Peter narrows his eyes.
Steve chuckles. “You have a point. Are you sure, though? I don’t want you to get tired of us.”
“Me, too.”
Happy Halloween, everyone! Hope everyone is having a safe and fun holiday! This chapter is pretty long I guess, but it is the birth scene so yay! It fits because I don't know what's scarier than hours of labor haha. Maybe it's just me. I did have a hard labor. Anyway, hope you all enjoy it!
He doesn’t get a chance to properly rest, and he’s forced to keep moving when the sound of a battle fills the space. Peter moves as fast as he can, dodging falling debris and avoiding the shots being fired. He cries out when the floor gives in and he quickly shoots a strand of web to pull him up and out of the way.
Anyway…I have a confession. I was thinking of doing an alternate ending 🤔 I have something planned so this story won’t be marked as complete just yet 😉
“Happy, I’m so sorry. We’ll be right there,” Steve assures.
“Better now, thanks. It’s going to be a long night so you guys don't have to wait around. I’ll keep you posted.”
Sam scoffs. “Yeah right. He loves me.”
Steve lies back and runs a hand through his sweat damped hair. His heart is still pounding; his breathing is still too harsh. He takes slow, deep breaths to calm himself. It was only a dream. Alpha wasn’t here.
“This isn’t working.”
“I was going to say the same about you. Even if you did almost hit me with your car.”
“If you say so. But if it gets worse I’m taking you down to medical.”
After a few minutes, Natasha lowers her gun. It slips through her fingers and hits the floor. The ear muffs come off next and land beside the forgotten gun, and that’s when Peter sees her break down for the first time. She screams and drops to her knees, her back hunching over and hands coming up to cradle her head. She pulls at her red hair, releasing another scream and sob.
Steve sighs softly when his head hits the pillow and his eyes fall shut.
“I love you, too.”
Steve chuckles. “He loves you, Petey. You’re his big, strong brother.”
Nothing stays the same. Despite their promise to remain friends and teammates, it’s a struggle to get back to what they are used to. They can be civil when they have to be, but when they’re not teaming up to save the world, the awkwardness makes itself known between them.
“What?” Tony asks. “It’s you!”
The current fight with his mate puts Steve in a sour mood all day. He tries to force a smile and make himself appear happy, but he knows his scent is giving him away. He’s caught members of his group wrinkling their nose when they get a whiff of him, or sending him sympathetic looks.
Steve huffs. “Makes sense. You better get him back or you're grounded.”
“I’m so sorry. I know that’s not what you want to hear but I’m sorry.” Sam reaches into his pocket and hands Peter a folded piece of paper. “He wanted you to have this.”
Steve sighs and leans back into the counter, folding his arms around his chest. He often wondered if he was good enough for someone like Tony. There wasn’t supposed to be a such thing as perfection. Lord knows he was far from it, despite Alpha calling him a perfect omega. Steve wasn’t perfect. He was damaged. Ruined and didn’t deserve anything.
The contractions are getting closer now. Though Tony can’t feel them, he can definitely feel the pressure. He groans from the discomfort. The sounds he makes are difficult to witness. All Steve wants to do is help and take his pain away.
And maybe that’s a sign that they shouldn’t be starting a family. Their jobs were demanding and dangerous. They were risking their lives everyday just to save others. But a baby, a tiny human that was part him and Tony was always on Steve’s mind. He sacrificed so much when he picked up the shield, and maybe now it was time he did something for himself.
Sarah comes rushing down the stairs, dressed in her favorite Cinderella gown and matching tiara. She resembles the princess with her long gold hair and sparkling blue eyes. It’s not until Steve realizes his daughter is ready to burst into tears does his smile falter.
He knew everything was going to be okay.
“P-please?” This time Tony knows the omega is begging to be left alone.
Pepper sighs. She wasn’t in the mood to be interviewed again. “Natalie, send them away. Now isn’t a good time.”
“You begged him, didn’t you?”
Ned’s eyes widen in shock. “Really? Peter, maybe you should just tell your parents and they help you.”
“So listen-” Tony starts. “I know school is starting back up for you soon and you’re practically an adult but I was wondering if you’d want to...I mean I have the extra room-”
“I guess. Can I finish my cocoa first?”
“I want to show you something,” Tony says. He doesn’t slip his arm from around Peter’s shoulder while he asks his AI to pull up a video.
Steve shakes his head and steps into the kitchen to properly greet Tony with a kiss. “I almost forgot about this part,” Steve winces and rubs at his belly. It’s still flat. Tony won’t allow it to get any bigger.
Steve was dead.
And maybe Peter could too. His life would be harder and he wouldn’t share the same struggles as Ned, but he could still graduate high school and get into MIT. He could still have a life. Maybe not the one he originally envisioned but he could have one just the same.
“He’s just upset,” Bruce says when he notices the look that crosses Tony’s face. “He’s not blaming-”
There’s a moment of silence between them before Peter breaks it.
“Hmm?” Tony lifts his head. “Maybe we can what?”
They always took it upon themselves to abuse him, even if he had complied. They found some kind of sick joy in hurting him.
The sound of the heavy metal door opening fills the room and Tony snaps his head up. Two men enter, dressed all in black and masks covering their faces. The guns in their hands aim at him.
“I hope so. You know how he is when I buy him stuff. Are you guys going to help me keep this a surprise?”
“I know. Pretty soon you won’t.”
Steve hums in delight. “Sounds good. I’m looking forward to it.”
Steve groans. “Buck-”
There’s a moment of silence over the line. Peter internally panics. He wasn’t the greatest liar in the world. If he was his parents wouldn’t know he was pregnant. Happy could probably pick up on the lie Peter was telling.
“Can Pete help you?”
“Whoa! You mean I get to ride in this thing?” Peter asks excitedly.
“I’m not gonna stand here and tell you you’re wrong or he’s wrong. He’s not even here to defend himself. But, Tony, that’s the past and this is now. So what are you gonna do? Yell at your computer and throw cups around? Did it even help?”
I think Tony is just stressed. That's no excuse for the things he said of course, but it's taking a toll on him too. I just feel for this little family. It will get better...eventually.
“Is currently stepping in for your conference call. Sir, I’d like to add that she is not pleased with your absence.”
“Steve, don’t. Go away.”
“Tony, I’m sorry.”
“I told you to stay,” he tells her. Natasha nods and works quietly on freeing Morgan from the carseat. Once she’s unstrapped and in her arms, Natasha gently passes her into Tony’s. She’s immediately calmer.
“Forget it.” Sam waves a dismissive hand. “Have dinner with your dad. You might as well get used to it.”
“Did he kill Tony?” Pepper’s eyes fill with tears again.
“Pep,” Tony sighs. “I gotta go. Pete’s having a meltdown.”
The knot is bigger now; he’s close to his release. He just needs a little more.
“No, I know. I just…” Steve sighs and pulls back the blankets on the bed and crawls in, wincing slightly from the tenderness in his lower half.
“It’s fine. If Pepper asks for me just tell her I’m a little busy. I can call her later.”
Steve nods, taking Tony’s suggestion and trying to calm himself down. But it’s difficult when his son refuses to do the same.
“M-more,” Tony pants. The grip he has on the sheets tightens.
“Nothing. I just wanted some air. Stretch my legs.”
He’s torn between looking for his father and getting back to the jet. He decides on the first option and continues moving, until another explosion erupts somewhere in the building. His papa probably already got the team out and they were making their way back to the jet. Captain America never risked the lives of his team.
His teammates don’t try to force him to stay. Sleep doesn’t come easily, and for most of the night Steve is left tossing and turning. His stomach is still bothering him, but it’s not just the morning sickness that’s getting to him. He needs to tell Tony the truth.
“Come now, I won’t hurt the pup. For all we know this could finally be the one.”
“You should go home, Happy,” Pepper tells him. “It’s getting late.”
“Sir,” Jarvis pipes up and an alert pops up on one of Tony’s screens. “You have a calendar reminder.”
“Oh no.” Peter’s eyes widen and fill with tears when he realizes what he’s done. “No. No.” He rushes over to inspect the shield, his heart sinking at the damage he’s created.
“I know. Me too.”
Steve sighs. “This is nice, Tony but...I don’t know if it’s enough.”
Steve’s stomach churns at that thought. Any parent was going to consider their child perfect, but Steve didn’t want to. He didn’t want to believe that there was a chance of an alpha being perfect, especially if that alpha turned out to be his own pup. Hydra would win.
“What’s this?” Tony gestures to the test Peter remembers peeing on a couple of weeks ago.
“Stop, stop. You’re perfect. I love you so much, regardless of your past. I don’t care about any of that. I just want you to be happy.”
“Fuck.” Tony rubs at his eyes when they grow misty.
“Why was he here? Did you-did you call him?”
“You’re getting close. This pup will be here soon.”
For once everything feels right. Steve was happy and planning a special evening for them. Maybe this was the time they had been waiting for. Maybe that storm that has been lingering for too long was finally passing.
Tony gives his mate a smile in return. “I love you more.”
“Natalie Rushman,” the woman introduces herself and offers a perfectly manicured hand for Tony to take.
“How do I know?” Peter questions. “How do I know you won’t listen to me when I need you? How do I know you won’t walk away when you can’t deal with me? You didn’t even hesitate to walk out on him. How do I know you won’t do the same?”
Tony growls and positions himself between Steve’s legs, then he takes his cock and leads it to the omega’s hole. Steve hisses when he’s penetrated and his head falls back against the pillow, his fingers grip the sheets tightly.
Steve curls up closer, resting his head over Tony’s chest. “I love you, too.”
They share a look, probably their last. Tony nods, his eyes shiny with tears.
Sam huffs and shakes his head. “We’re awful parents.”
Tony smiles and kisses him gently. Steve grows impatient and tries to deepen the kiss by teasing Tony’s bottom lip with his tongue. The alpha parts his lips, granting Steve access into his hot mouth.
Steve reaches up to tangle his fingers in Tony’s hair, pulling on the strands and forcing a groan from Tony’s lips. Tony grinds down, feeding Steve the friction he’s desperately craving. His own clothes are still on, robbing him of the feeling of Steve against him. Tony breaks the kiss to shed his own clothing. Then he’s finally able to feel Steve.
“He’s usually not like this.”
Tony doesn’t miss the way Steve’s voice cracks. One glance up shows tears running down Steve’s face.
A soft bark from the foot of the bed reminds them that they’re not alone. Steve breaks away, turning his head toward Dodger, a small chuckle escaping him. “Guess someone just wants attention,” he says.
“Of course not. I’m used to awkward teenagers hanging around my tower.”
Peter nods. “Okay.”
It’s disappointing. It’s sad. It’s the worst thing that could have ever happened. Peter can’t find a costume.
It’s not long before Steve’s falling asleep on Tony’s shoulder. The alpha kisses the omega’s head, and whispers the three words he promises to say for the rest of his life.
“And I wish you could see that even though you didn’t have a dad growing up, you’re still a great one. It’ll get easier. I promise.”
“I f-failed,” Steve sobs, his fingers clinging to Tony’s shirt tightly. “They took her from me. They took all of them.”
As soon as his papa leaves the room, Peter gags again and rushes for the toilet to start another grueling round.
His son is nowhere to be seen.
Tony sighs. “Oh well. Can’t say I’m not disappointed. Thanks anyway, J.”
“I know. I’ll hire someone. There’s no way in hell I’m going outside of the compound. Can you imagine the headlines? Yikes.”
“Yeah. I don’t see why not. You’re a good guy. I mean at first I thought you were an alpha. It’s not a bad thing I swear!”
Tony smiles and rubs his thumb over Steve’s knuckles. “Yeah. I think so. We always could in the past. Are you suggesting we…”
“What?” Steve grumbles.
“Sorry, Petey-Pie. This is mommy’s. Maybe one day you’ll give your mate one.”
Tony wishes now he knew just what kind of powers his son possessed.
To say the team was shocked would be an understatement. They wore more than just surprised faces when they were finally allowed to greet their friends. Their expressions were a mix of surprise and confusion. .
Steve hums as he thinks back to the night he let his son go to his first party. He can’t help but feel regret. Maybe if he had kept Peter home none of this would have happened. But Peter would have found a way to sneak out and get to that party.
Steve spins around, revealing his red-rimmed eyes and tear streaked face. The bitterness in Steve’s scent is stronger now and the first thing Tony wants to do is rush over and comfort him, but the warning growl Steve emits has Tony stopping in his tracks.
Steve sucks in a harsh breath and eases off the bag, letting it swing for a moment until he grows tired of the motion and reaches out to stop it. “There was a little smiley face on it so...you get the idea.”
“Yeah.” Steve smiles and reaches out to scratch behind Dodger’s ear. Dodger thumps his tail harder against the wooden floor and turns to lick Steve.
Steve chuckles beside his son. “It’ll grow, Pete.”
Tony’s watched the video so many times he’s almost lost count. He keeps his eyes on his son, taking in his expression as he experiences the video for the first time.
“I’m sorry.”
Natasha disappears for a moment, and when she returns, she has an old photo album in her hands. She lays it down on the coffee table and everyone gathers around.
“And you killed my parents.”
But that’s exactly what he was. He was only meant for one thing: breeding.
With Steve calmer, Tony works quickly to get a bag packed for both him and Steve, then he’s taking Steve by the hand and leading him out to the jet.
“I’m sorry about this. They’re usually better.”
Tony is left to watch completely dumbstruck with how quick Natasha is able to calm down his fussy son. He thought he was good at calming Peter, but now he was learning he had some serious competition.
“Yeah! Hey, Papa?”
“Are you alright?” Bruce is looking at him with furrowed brows. Steve waves him off again but it’s obvious the doctor isn’t buying it. “Do you want me to look you over? Maybe Jarvis can-”
Steve grabs his shield on the way out of his apartment, securing it over his shoulders. He meets the team outside; they’re already loading into the jet. Tony isn’t with him, not that Steve expected him to be. He was in the city with Pepper again.
“Yeah?” Steve can’t help but smile back. “He isn’t fighting you, is he?”
Steve collapses back, chest rising and falling rapidly, heavy pants leaving his lips. His hair is disheveled and his skin is flushed and covered in a thin layer of sweat. His body aches; it’s drained and all he can think about is sleep.
“We’ll talk in my office,” Tony says and Peter follows him out of the elevator.
“I am happy. I love being with you and the kids. And maybe one day we could add another…”
“You and me both. I’m supposed to pick him up-”
Tony groans.
Tony smiles at the scene and makes himself comfortable in one of the empty arm chairs. Steve continues to speak to their daughter, telling her all about his day and the Blue bird he saw during breakfast and the sketch he did of it later. Morgan smiles a toothless grin. It makes Steve laugh.
“He’ll be fine,” Tony is quick to assure when he catches the look on his mate’s face.
It was now or never.
Steve’s jaw clenches. “You’re not fine, Tony. If it’s about what happened-”
He drops down to his knees, grunting softly when his own rest on the shower floor. He’s careful when he cleans around Steve’s legs. When he rises to his feet to instruct Steve to turn around, Steve is able to read his mind and turn on his own until they’re facing each other. Steve smiles softly, hoping it would be enough to wipe the frown off Tony’s face. It does. It always does.
“I’m just scared. What if I’m...Tony, I don’t think I can…”
But it’s more than that. The urge to start a new project isn’t to benefit the world like past creations, but to protect the tiny world he created with Steve. The safety of his mate and pup would always come first.
“Do you...do you like me?”
“Where is he?” Bruce asks.
“Nuh uh. You gotta strip first.”
“Wait, you being in labor is comfortable? How is that possible?"
Steve nods and cuts into the french toast. He takes a bite and hums in delight, then he offers a piece to Tony. “It is good,” he says. “You can cook.”
Tony is snapped from his thoughts when he feels tugging on the sleeve of his jacket. He glances down, for a moment forgetting where he was and who he was with. Peter smiles softly at him and then gestures toward the gravesite. Tony’s eyes follow, his heart clenching painfully and eyes filling with tears.
Despite the warning Tony can’t help but flinch. The transducer is pressed to his stomach and the screen lights up. Steve keeps his gaze locked on the screen, breath hitching when he sees the black and white images displayed.
“Ah. That explains the mess.”
He smiles fondly at the memories of gathering in the common room while they ate, talked, and laughed. They were more than just a group of superheroes. They were friends. They were family.
“Yeah.” Steve nods and examines his slightly bruised wrists. He’s not concerned, knowing the serum will heal them in a few hours. “You?”
“I don't know,” Tony answers, unable to look up and meet Steve’s eyes. His own are burning with tears and he blinks them back, not wanting to let his emotions get the best of him at a time like this.
“That he’s not really gone. That this isn’t real.”
They break apart and Pepper keeps her hands on his shoulders, studying his features careful. The tears haven’t stopped and for a second he feels like shrugging her off and telling her to get back to the party. But he doesn’t. It’s humiliating to be found crying alone in the kitchen. Lord knows it hasn’t been the first time he’s been found like this, and during another party.
Tony’s heart sinks at those words.
Peter hadn’t been enthusiastic when he first heard that he was going to be a big brother. He was the baby and used to getting all of the attention, but eventually he came around to the idea and couldn’t wait for his little brother or sister to arrive.
Bucky screams in anger and lunges at Tony, his metal fist connecting with Tony’s cheek. Tony tries to fight back, issuing punches and kicks of his own, but he’s no match against the super soldier. If only he had his suit.
Peter nods his head and excuses himself from the table. He takes his plate to the kitchen before going up the stairs to get ready for bed.
“Can’t,” Steve says through gritted teeth. The pressure is back, only this time it’s between his legs. On the next contraction he gives an experimental push, gasping when the baby drops lower into his pelvis. “Shit!” Steve cries, dropping to a squat and resting both hands over Tony’s shoulders as leverage.
“Will you just stop? I wanted to take them in and raise them as my own. I love those kids, so don’t for a second even think that I regret them.”
“I’m just tired. Besides, I’d rather help with this.”
Tony smiles and raises his glass to initiate a toast and Steve mirrors him. “Happy Valentine’s Day, sweetheart. Here’s to many more.”
“It might. I don’t have any competition do I?”
But that scene never played out. Tony had left. He left Steve, their son, and the rest of the team. He threw away his family like they were disposable. Family wasn’t disposable. Family wasn’t perfect, but none of the members deserved the harsh treatment Tony gave them.
“What do you want me to say, Pep? I’m trying here. I didn’t play the fucking voicemail to hurt him! Hurting him is the last thing I want to do.”
One particular hard cramp hits and Steve can’t help the small scream that rips through his throat. He leans against the wall again, eyes squeezing shut and groans leaving him when the pain intensifies. There’s a building pressure deep in his pelvis, adding to the discomfort he’s already feeling. Something pops inside of him and gushes out, relieving the pressure. Steve glances down, eyes widening at the sight of the shower water tinged a bright pink.
Steve nods and continues to rock his son gently, knowing if he were to stop Peter would fuss again.
“So you’re saying…” Tony trails off and his eyes land on Steve’s middle. It finally dawns on him what Steve is trying to say. “No,” Tony shakes his head and rises to his feet. “No. No. That is not mine. That is not-no. No. I didn’t. I wouldn’t-”
Steve is about ready to protest, just like Tony knew he would, but before the words can leave Steve’s mouth, Tony takes his hands and brings him closer. Steve yelps in surprise when Tony pulls him into his lap.
“Are you sure? You can help me make some pancakes. Maybe with sprinkles or chocolate chips.”
“Figure what out? You haven’t told me a thing, Tony. And it’s really starting to piss me off.”
It was a stupid plan, Peter knew this, but he couldn’t risk his papa going out on a mission alone. He’s seen his father do this so many times, and each time there has never even been a hint of fear on his father’s face. But Peter had seen something different this time.
“I need to go.”
Tony nods and hands Peter the tablet. “I’m still working on it. Maybe we can brainstorm or something. We’re really good at that.”
Bucky wipes his mouth with the back of his hand before peering up at Sam and frowns. “I have no idea.”
Tony tenses, his scent growing sour and another growl forming. Steve whines softly and leans in to nuzzle around his throat, using his own sweet scent to calm his distressed mate. For once couldn’t alphas get along?
“15.”
Tony peers up at him and lets out a sigh. “Steve, we can’t jump to conclusions-”
“I’ll get on it.”
“Not everything,” Pepper says
I finally got around to updating! This chapter mostly focuses on Peter and of course I said I’d explain what happened with Sam and Bucky. The next one will have Tony and Peter interacting better than they did.
Sam joins the group and welcomes them, the smile on his face bright and comforting. Steve feels safe around him. There had only been a handful of alphas he’s felt that way around. His best friend had been one of them, and the couple of alphas that were a part of the Howling Commandos. Then of course there was Tony. And now he had Sam.
But their relationship was rocky, probably on the verge of crumbling if it hadn’t already. It had been Peter’s choice to step back and ask for space. He had rushed into a relationship with his dad too soon without taking the time to think if having a relationship with him was what he truly wanted. Maybe Peter had only wanted to find his dad because the only parental figure he had was ripped out of his life. He needed that void filled.
Delivering his daughter in the car was not part of the plan. He was supposed to be at the hospital with Tony by his side. All of this was wrong.
“I don’t know. I read it’s better to wait until after the first trimester.”
The silence that follows is awkward. Tony clears his throat and moves toward the bar, itching for a drink in hopes of easing his discomfort.
The woman says something Tony doesn’t quite catch, then she repeats herself and he realizes she’s speaking Russian.
Steve was on his mind every second of every day. When Pepper handed him new contracts or forwarded him emails he needed to reply to, all Tony could think about was Steve. His company was going to crumble if he didn’t put all his focus into it, but sometimes Tony didn’t care. He’d let SI fall.
Sam frowns and glances between the two. “Someone tell me what the hell is going on?”
He doesn’t bother to tell Steve where he’s going; he can shoot him a text once he gets there. He doesn’t even know if Pepper is available for a drop in visit like this, but he needs someone to talk to. He needs a break from the chaos.
“I guess. Gonna be hard now that I don’t have you two. Hey, maybe next week or whenever you’re up to it, he can stay with me? I know we haven’t discussed a schedule yet, but I’m all for taking him for a week.”
“Shit! Are you sure?” Tony rushes toward him, one hand falling to Steve’s middle and he feels it harden underneath his fingertips.
Jarvis sighs again, this time sounding agitated. If he had a face Tony pictured him rolling his eyes right about now.
“One doctor one time doesn’t count, Tony. I’m honestly surprised he hasn’t had any complications with this pregnancy. The scans all look good but maybe I’m missing something.” Bruce rubs at his forehead and his eyes squeeze shut.
“Please,” Steve finds himself begging. “Don’t hurt him.”
“Sure,” Tony shrugs nonchalantly. “It’s the least I can do.”
“I guess you’re right.”
“A couple of hours? Tony, isn’t that a little much? He’s still young and-”
“You nervous?” Natasha is the first to greet him. If she’s apprehensive about the objective, she does a damn good job at hiding it. Steve wishes he could mask his emotions the same way.
He directs his eyes back on the parts he can see, licking his lips at the sight of the rippling muscles of his torso. Tony finds himself reaching out a hand to touch. The omega jerks from the contact, a soft moan filling the space.
There’s no point dwelling. He needs to be prepared for whatever is waiting for him once the doors open. He feels better now that he has two weapons, but it’s not enough. He was outnumbered regardless. He can only hope Steve is doing better than him.
“But you’re leaving again.”
“You’re leaving?” Steve asks, finally breaking the silence. He’s no longer staring down at his lap, and instead he lifts his head to connect his eyes with Tony’s. The deep frown etched on his face hasn’t left since they’ve started this conversation. “Why?”
Peter is just as shocked by his uncle’s words. He never believed that his uncle would ever hurt him in any way, but he never thought he would hear his uncle agree with him on something like this. For years all Peter heard out of his mouth was his distaste for his dad. Maybe now he was coming around.
It was just the depression, Tony knew that, but he and depression go way back. He knew it wasn’t just a roll coaster of emotions with depression. There were other, and sometimes, worse side effects.
“N-no...please…” Steve whimpers. There’s a heavy weight on his chest, the pressure growing heavier. “Please...don’t….don’t.”
“Oh.” Natasha’s frown deepens.
“I can brush fast, Papa!”
“I know you want to know. We don’t know anything about each other.”
“Angsty? Hon, he’s a 17 year old. They act this way sometimes. Listen, I’ll be outta here in a few hours and I’ll talk to him.”
“Nah. I’m a little tired but we can talk. How’s things?”
Steve stirs and Tony glances up at him. Blue eyes flutter open and connect with brown.
“Will he come back?” Peter asks. He’s curled up beside his uncle, head resting on Bucky’s shoulder and eyes growing heavy.
Steve chuckles and leads Tony out of the garage and back to the house. Tony checks on the pups one last time before following Steve to their bedroom. As soon as he shuts the door behind them, Steve’s lips are on his. Tony is surprised by the aggressiveness, but welcomes it. He’s glad Steve has become more confident in the bedroom.
There’s not an immediate reply. Peter huffs and turns toward the window. Two can play at that game.
“Yeah. He mentioned retiring. I wish he would’ve had the chance. He at least deserved that.” Natasha’s eyes are full of tears and she quickly wipes away the ones that escape. “Sorry,” she apologizes when the tears don’t stop.
Peter shakes his head. “No...not really. I don’t hate you or anything. You’re still my dad.”
Peter shakes his head and his index finger finds its way into his mouth, the nail is chewed away nervously. “No. Just don’t-”
“He can. But he’s eventually going to need his own room. Look at this place.” Tony opens his arms wide. “I have more than enough room. He can have his own bedroom and a playroom. When he gets older maybe he’ll want a treehouse in the backyard.”
Maybe it was for the best. Maybe they weren’t ready to be parents. Tony clearly had his doubts about becoming a father. No matter how many times Steve would assure him that Tony wouldn’t end up like his father or worse, it was obvious Tony struggled to believe that.
“Why?”
His stomach growls again, reminding him of the food he’s been deprived of. Steve pulls the blankets away and swings his legs off the side of the bed, stretching his arms high over his head, the muscles popping and he releases a pleased sigh
The smell of an aroused alpha penetrates the air.
“No. I mean I don’t want this for him. I don’t want to spoil him with material things. My parents did that and I didn’t even want any of it. I wanted them.”
Tony rolls his eyes and drops what he’s doing. “Okay! I panicked and dropped him off.”
“Is it going to hurt?” Peter asks, his tone laced with worry.
Steve is instructed to push again, and after taking a deep breath, he does as he’s told. Tony begins counting again.
“I love it. It definitely explains you wanting to hang out with me all the time.”
“I like to think he does. He believed in a Heaven and...I don’t know...I like to think he’s there. It’s supposed to be a happy place with no more pain and suffering or whatever. He deserves some peace. He didn’t get a whole lot of it here.”
“You’re making good progress. Your little one is just taking his time.”
“It’s okay. I wasn’t sure if it would happen again either. Don’t worry I double checked this time and I have an appointment next week. I won’t screw up again.”
“I know, and I’m sorry. But I’ll be fine. I’ll take Nat, Bruce. Hell maybe I can get Thor.”
Steve blinks a few times, snapping out of his thoughts and back to the conversation. Pepper had removed her hands from his belly and had taken her wine glass again.
A comforting hand rests on his shoulder, snapping Steve from his thoughts. He glances up, meeting the soft brown eyes of his mate. He was glad Tony had arrived as soon as he could, and though his presence was what Steve needed, he knew it wasn’t going to be enough.
Steve barely touches the food given to him. Tony tries to offer him something else, only for the omega to shut down and refuse. Tony sighs and steps away to give him space.
“No one else is here,” one of them informs.
“Sounds like you. You two can cry together.”
“Don’t move,” says the gruff voice. Steve complies, knowing better than to fight back when he held something so precious in his arms. Brock Rumlow steps to the side of Steve, not once removing the gun he has placed to the omega’s head. “Give me the kid.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t. I don’t blame any of this on you. You can’t control what they do.”
It shouldn’t hurt this much anymore, especially after the countless attempts they’ve made. But Steve would be lying if he said the negative result on another pregnancy test didn’t bother him. As of late, that seems to be the only type of result he gets.
The two guards step forward to remind the omega of his place, but their leader holds up a hand to stop them. He orders them from the room and the lock clicks in place.
“Only if you join me?” Steve smirks.
“That’s our baby,” Steve says softly, eyes bright and full of happiness. A happiness Tony had only seen a handful of times during their relationship. It only makes Tony feel worse.
Tony scoffs. “Well, that’s stupid. How come you never reminded me?”
“I know that look,” Bucky rips his hand away and fresh tears gather in his eyes. “You’re afraid of me.”
Steve eases off and slumps back, greedily gulping down air into his lungs. The next contraction is already approaching, robbing Steve of the break he desperately needs. He takes another deep breath and leans forward, bringing his chin down to his chest and pushing hard, groaning through gritted teeth from the intense pain.
“I was just about to ask you the same thing. You’re a wonderful father.”
Or maybe he did.
“Much.I can’t feel a damn thing.”
“I know. But one day won’t kill him.”
“So…” Sam trails off, almost as if he’s afraid to continue. “How is he?”
“I know. I couldn’t live without you.”
“I’m sure.”
“Okay,” Steve nods.
“So why weren’t you at the funeral?”
The event was all he could think about.
“But this isn’t his room,” Tony says and he lays his Starkpad to the side. “Not really. We’re not going to be living here full time. Why even bother?”
“I’m the favorite,” Natasha smirks and adjusts the little boy on her hip. “How’s Little Natasha?”
“Getting there.” Tony shifts and rests his head on Steve’s chest. “How are you feeling?”
“Dammit.” Steve sighs and rests his head back against the wall. “I screwed up.”
Peter was fine and in Natasha’s care. There was no reason for Steve to be so nervous. He could trust Natasha with his life, so there should be no reason not to trust her with his son’s. Peter was going to be fine. It was just for a few hours.
Tony turns toward her, smiling softly. “I don’t think I greeted you today.”
Now that the alarm has been set off, Steve expects every single alpha in the vicinity to come for him. He has nothing but his bare hands to defend himself, but that’s the least of his concerns. He needed to find the person responsible for his suffering before he ran away and hid like the coward he is.
Steve smiles and gives Morgan another kiss. “She’s getting so big.”
The suit never does get finished. They get distracted with other things, talking mostly. During dinner, Peter makes suggestions for his future bedroom, and Tony offers to show him the space he plans to renovate. It would be another project for them to do together. Something for them to bond over.
“Come on. Let’s go to bed.”
Peter waves awkwardly and quickly scurries across the street. Tony watches for as long as he can until Peter disappears out of view, then with a heavy sigh, he retreats back into his tower.
Tony adds another finger, stretching and scissoring the omega open. He increases his pace, thrusting roughly, groaning in response to the wet sounds that fill the room.
Peter is eight now. More and more every day he was surprising Steve. He was smart for his age, something he mostly likely inherited from his father. He resembled Tony more now than the day he was born. It was difficult to see so much of the man he loved in his son.
After her cocoa and gushing about the cute boy in math class, Morgan deems herself ready to face her parents. She had ignored all of their texts and phone calls. She had only been gone an hour but to them it probably seemed like longer.
But Peter is so tiny and his tummy demands food every few hours.
“Yes you do. I’m happy for you. I hope this works out. You need something positive in your life.”
Steve smiles. “I love you more.”
Tony finally finds the courage to get out of the car and make his way into the cemetery. The atmosphere was heavy, the sadness pressing on his chest until it was nearly crushing him. This wasn’t the first time he’s been at a cemetery and it definitely wouldn’t be his last. He’s transported back in time when he lost his parents and had to watch as they were lowered into the ground. It hurt, worse than any type of pain he’s ever felt.
The baby was doing good. His skin no longer had that grayish tone and was now flushed and pink, especially around his cheeks. His hair was light, strands of it peeking out from underneath the hat. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but Steve had a feeling they would be matching his own.
“And if I can’t do this?”
“It wouldn’t be a bother.” Bruce smiles.
“H-he? It’s a boy?” Steve finally finds his voice. His voice is rough and his throat raw from the screaming. His eyes flutter and his head tips back until it’s colliding with the bed again. He’s so tired.
“I know you’re nervous, and you have every reason to be. No one said this was going to be easy, but you can’t give up. This is the start of a new chapter in your life and I know it seems scary now, but I promise you won’t regret it. The first step is always the hardest.”
“I’m going back, “ Sam decides.
“It’s how I look, isn’t it?”
Steve chokes back a sob and squeezes his eyes shut. He tries to block out the sounds, the smell, the feel; all of it. He prays to be put out of his misery and to go back to a time where this wasn’t his life. He misses being with Tony and their son.
“Can someone else deal with it? Pepper-”
“Yes it is!”
Steve frowns when he realizes what Tony is referring to. “I already told you. It’s probably sympathy-”
“I mean it, Steve. If you’d rather snuggle with this fleabag-”
The alpha sighs heavily and sets his utensils down. He wipes at his mouth with the napkin, then he’s rising to his feet and crossing the room to the bar to pour another drink.
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes. “You’re the only one who can help.”
“I know.” Pepper nods.
“Okay but if this other alpha is looking for him then moving out here isn’t enough. You need help, Tony.”
The room is nearly silent, all except for the sounds Steve makes while he labors. Bruce is outside of the room, deciding to give them some privacy but still nearby in case he was needed. Steve has given up on moving and finds comfort in the nest he’s created. The soothing scent of his alpha fills his nose every time he takes a deep breath.
“Now.” Bucky’s voice is firm, and the way his hand grips Sam’s shirt tightly has him giving in.
Tony winces and distracts himself with his own cup of coffee, then begins digging through the bag he’s brought with him and pulls out a blueberry muffin.
“He’s always welcome here. If you’re not ready-”
“Hold on,” Bucky takes the album and begins flipping through it. “I have a better one.”
“Uh…” Tony glances down at the phone that’s still in his hand. “I’ll check in. Hey, maybe Nat can watch her a little longer and we grab some lunch? Sound good?”
Steve scoffs and playfully rolls his eyes. “Too much.”
Sorry that this has taken be a while to update. I’m starting a new job soon and moving into a new place so it’s been crazy! Thank you all for being patient with me and supportive. I appreciate it 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
Steve topples over the edge first, back arching off the bed and screaming Tony’s name until his throat burns. Tony fucks him through it, not slowing down the pace of his hips. He thrusts three more times before he’s spilling inside of Steve.
Happy nods as he considers this. “What about you?”
“I don’t know. I just...I’m not very comfortable with…”
It was difficult to juggle their superhero life and their family, but somehow it all came together. Morgan never missed out on any kisses and hugs or stories before bed. Her parents made time for her despite their crazy jobs.
Anyway! Peter could be on the way...maybe...I don't know. But at least Steve has Happy and they're getting along.
Tony smirks. “They’ll only do it if I say.”
The slap across his face has Steve crying out from both pain and surprise. His cheek stings from where Alpha’s palm has struck him, it brings tears to Steve’s eyes.
Peter finds himself in the bathroom, huddled around the toilet bowl and staring at the bit of breakfast he consumed. He gags again and lurches forward, emptying his stomach for the third time that morning.
After he’s said his goodbyes, he begins tidying up the room and arranging it back to its original state. A soft knock on the doorframe captures his attention and Steve peers up, smiling warmly at his best friend.
“He is.”
“Buck, just listen,” Sam tries to calm his husband before Bucky storms off and punches a wall. “I know what you’re thinking, but this doesn’t concern us. Not anymore. This is about Peter.”
Peter nods his head and opens his arms when he’s instructed to. Harley is carefully placed in his arms. He’s tiny and a little wiggly, but Peter loves him anyway.
“Did you see it?”
And that was fine. Tony was tired and too old to be flying around and fighting aliens or whatever the hell decided to invade Earth. The past 15 years have been the worst. He didn’t just lose himself during that time, he lost Iron Man too.
“Same thing. You did something heroic.”
Tony chuckles and gestures for Peter to continue.
Steve forces himself to his feet, ignoring the orders from medical staff telling him to take it easy. He turns himself around, relying on the bed to steady himself.
“Not really. I think I’ve already done that. Forget it. I’m sorry for wasting your time.” Tony rises to his feet and Alexander does the same. Tony leans in to shake his hand, only to retract it when the other alpha gets too close and sniffs the air. His eyes go black for a moment before they’re turning back to his natural color.
“Easy there, kiddo.” Steve chuckles when Peter continues to eat like it was his last meal. Steve watches his son eat for a moment before tipping his head back against the chair and letting his eyes fall shut. It would be so easy to fall back asleep, but he fights the exhaustion.
The one he’s living now was a step in the right direction. He had a mate who loved him, four beautiful pups, and a second chance to find his place. It was time to take that final step.
Tony can already picture everyone struggling to have a good time. He knows for a fact that he won’t be able to find any joy. The last party he went to was the one he’s come to regret. This was going to be another.
Steve glances up at Tony and leans closer to place a kiss to his cheek. “Thank you,” he says softly.
Just like Sam had said, Peter catches up to his cousin and lifts him into the air, the toddler squealing in surprise. Peter laughs and brings Steve down so that he can kiss his cheek.
the voice in his head asks,
Peter chuckles and shakes his head. “He didn’t hold a grudge, and I won’t either. But…”
“Hey.” Comes Tony’s voice and Steve lifts his head, connecting his eyes with those of his alpha. Steve smiles warmly at him and gets one in return. “Is he asleep?” Tony asks when he comes over, making sure his voice is low enough to not disturb his son.
I got around to updating this one! It's nothing special and I do apologize. Just some more baby bonding. Enjoy!
“Rogers?”
The man stares at him with wide, blue eyes. Why do they look so familiar?
“I’m not hungry,” Steve says and he leans back in his seat, his eyes falling shut.
“Yay!” Steve cheers and Morgan giggles again when Steve kisses her cheek. “Daddy has the keys.”
“I don’t trust myself.”
“Did you say-wait, how are you from-this doesn’t make any sense. You told me you were a breeder and now you’re telling me that back in the forties you were some kind of experiment?” Tony asks in disbelief.
It was like someone knew what he needed. He tries to comprehend the situation, a part of his brain still functioning despite the rest of it consumed by the idea of taking the omega in front of him. None of this makes sense. Why was he here? Who did this to him? He had more questions just like those that needed answers.
Natasha cocks her head in confusion. “Ben?” She repeats, her eyes following his gaze. “Like the ice cream? You want to name your son after Ben and Jerry’s?”
“What?” Tony asks.
Peter sags in his seat when his parents glance in his direction. Tony smirks behind his mug, doing his best to keep the laugh that’s building to himself. Steve catches on and scowls.
Tony huffs and begins reading through the various emails he received during the weekend. He’s wishing he responded to them before.
Tony sighs and sits down on the side of the bed, the night of the party replaying in his mind. This is where it all happened. This is where he fucked everything up.
“How would they remind you?”
He hits that spot everytime, forcing an array of curses and moans past Tony’s lips. His cock twitches in Steve’s hand, the tip leaking and spilling over Steve’s hand.
Steve huffs out a laugh and wipes at his eyes again. “I was terrified. I wasn’t supposed to be pregnant. I don’t understand-the test was negative-I shouldn’t have-”
“Yeah?” Steve smirks, one brow raising. “You’re that sensitive, huh?”
The smiles and laughter return again when Clint gets frosting on his finger to smear across Natasha’s face. She frowns and then threatens him. It only makes Clint laugh harder.
Tony glances over at his son. “Are you up for it? I put you through a lot today.”
Peter is snapped from his thoughts when something lands on the coffee table in front of him. He blinks for a second and stares at the item his dad had just thrown, his heart dropping down into the pit of his stomach.
They should be back at the party with their friends, basking in the glow of their victory. But after a couple of drinks, they’re sneaking away from the guests and up to Tony’s penthouse.
“I know,” Tony sighs. “I’d do anything for that kid.”
“Tony,” Steve shakes his head with a sigh and pushes himself off the couch to go in search of his missing husband.
It’s well into the evening by the time Steve has his son dressed and ready for bed. He settles them both into the rocking chair and lifts his shirt, then he brings Peter to his chest and helps him latch on. Steve chuckles softly when Peter nurses greedily.
“Dad?” Comes Peter’s voice and both Tony and Natasha glance over at the approaching teen. He appears nervous, but better than the last time Tony saw him. His tears were all dried up, but his eyes were still inflamed and his face blotchy.
Harley pulls back slightly. “He’s not nice! He scares me all the time.”
Steve rises to his feet and leans over Tony, ducking his head down until their lips are meeting. Tony’s lips are rough and chapped, but Steve can’t bring himself to care. He hasn’t kissed these lips in a long time.
By some miracle Peter makes it through the day. And by some other miracle, Flash doesn’t go looking for him. It’s both relieving and frightening all at the same time.
Steve forces himself to look away, deciding it was safer to glance down at his lap instead. He doesn’t want to say the wrong thing and screw up this opportunity. He wants to make things work with Tony. He loves him.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “No. For all we know he could be awake. You haven’t felt him yet, right?”
“Keep wishing, Rogers.”
Tony doesn’t tell his son that he’s afraid to go back, especially during Steve’s birthday party. He doesn’t tell Peter that showing up to the party would probably end up causing more harm than good. The last thing he wanted to do was show up and somehow ruin the event.
Yay a proposal is coming up!
Tony backs away from the door. “J, you can...let him in.”
“I’m not. I’ll figure it out,” Steve says.
“That makes one of us.”
It feels like forever since I've been on here and writing. Life gets busy I guess. I'm sorry it's taken me this long. I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
“So? That’s not going to be enough to push me away. I want to stick around and...I don’t know...maybe one day you can come live with me.”
“Tony!” Steve panics and his eyes widen in his fear. One glance toward his mate shows his chest still rising and falling slowly. His breathing was just as slow.
Steve nods. “Yeah. He’s like you, one of the good ones.”
“Don’t worry about it. Happy can give you a ride home.”
“I’m sorry.” Tears are running down Steve’s face now. He gently strokes the bruise on Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
She hates how harsh she is beginning to sound when it comes to her brother. She loved him, but sometimes she couldn’t help but feel jealous that he was taking up all of their parents time. Harley wasn’t innocent either, but she felt he got a pass because he was young.
“Hey,” Tony greets. He’s careful when he approaches, eyes trained on the two younger pups playing with Steve and then to the older one shying away. James growls at his presence and Tony freezes, looking to Steve for permission to get closer.
“What?” Steve peers up again and this time follows Tony’s gaze. “It looks nice. What don’t you-”
“I don’t know how to say this but...but I’m pregnant. That night at the party...Tony, I never intended for this to happen and I’m sorry that it’s taken me this long to say anything. I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do. I can’t have a baby right now. Not with the job I have and my duties as the team’s leader.
I guess it’s kind of a fluffy filler type of chapter. The team gets to meet little Peter 😊
“We’re having an adult conversation,” Tony explains.
Peter glances away from the window to stare at him, brows furrowed for a moment before he remembers. “Oh! Yeah...um...I can kinda...swing.”
Steve is fast asleep by the time Tony returns to him. He sits back down beside the omega and allows his own eyes to fall shut. His hand brushes against Steve’s, but he doesn’t pull away. The touch was nice.
“Guess your spidey senses aren’t working today, huh?” Sam teases.
“Then why involve me at all?”
Steve turns to the Director and asks, “How did you find us?”
“Yeah, of course. I mean, I know I haven’t been the greatest friend. Ignoring you for the past few months was just...it was just me trying to figure out how to move on. It’s stupid, I know. I guess I thought if I pushed you away it would make getting over you easier.”
Steve chuckles. “Yeah. He looks so much like you. And he’s so smart.”
“If you say so.”
“Hey! It’s not my fault you’re so sneaky!”
“Not in that onesie you’re not,” Tony teases.
He blames his hormones for the shift in his attitude but deep down he knows his past issues are coming back to haunt him. He wishes he could let go and not allow them to plague him, but he wasn’t that strong. Maybe he used to be but after Hydra and Alpha, the old Steve Rogers was gone and there was no telling when he’d emerge.
“You’ll see.” Tony shoots Steve one of his confident smiles. It could be a sign, but Steve had decided he’s stopped looking for those signals.
It’s what his papa had always taught him.
“I know. Believe me I know.” Tony gestures to the bruise on his cheek. “I’m sorry tonight didn’t go as planned.”
Peter leans forward and buries his face in his hands, sobbing until his chest hurts. He doesn’t even hear the footsteps up the stairs. It’s not until someone is sitting beside him does Peter gasp and look up, meeting his aunt’s soft eyes.
And then of course there was Flash...but Peter was hesitant to show him. Their last conversation was far from pleasant and didn’t go in the direction Peter was expecting. Well, to be honest, maybe it did. Flash had already proved time and time again that Peter was just someone he could call names and belittle. There’s no way in hell he would be there for the baby.
Pepper frowns as she thinks it over. “Not necessarily.
“You don’t think I’m trying? Coming back here seems like proof, doesn’t it? Do you know how hard it was to come back?”
“Tony, no-”
“Steve, wait!” Tony quickly grips Steve’s wrist to prevent him from leaving. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I’ll go.”
Im updating again! This chapter is a little fluffy too since all the drama is finally over! Well, almost. I’ll get into Steve’s therapy and all that stuff later. I’m not done with this story yet! 😊
“Aw but he’s so cool!” Tony whines and circles the island to get to his hologram. “He’s going to scare-”
Peter shakes his head and hugs Tony tightly. He pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “Daddy,” he says with a frown on his face and sad brown eyes. “I couldn’t find a costume.”
Steve perks up at that. “Yeah?” He asks and Pepper nods. He smiles, “It’s good to be home. I was afraid I’d never come back.”
“It’s okay. I ran away.”
Peter’s curiosity grows and he opens his hand, only to close it again when the rain dampens the paper. He quickly stands and rushes back inside before the rain completely destroys the paper.
“It’s hard,” Bruce says, his voice capturing Tony’s attention. “Not having him here has really hurt us. There’s a hole now, one that only he could fill.”
“Starved.” Natasha smiles and gets up from her seat to grab a few wine glasses and the corkscrew. “Where’s Pete?”
Steve glances down at his son. “Okay,” he murmurs and kisses the top of Peter’s head. “Be gentle. He’s tiny.”
“Nah. I’ve been through worse. How’s Pete? Didn’t give you a hard time did he? We made a deal.”
Rhodey doesn't even flinch. He’s been around Tony like this more times than he can count. It makes Tony feel guilty for putting his friend though this crap again.
The voice is beginning to sound a lot like his mother. It reminds of how strong he really is and what he’s capable of. He can get up and fight, stand up to the bullies that have tormented him. He was stronger than them.
“It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later. By the way I’m not done asking questions. I want to know everything.”
That captures Tony’s attention and he quickly has JARVIS turn on the lights. The first thing he looks for is red, but the sheets are still white. His eyes travel up to Steve’s face, noticing the way it contorts in pain.
“Sorry, Papa,” he sighs again and takes his original spot beside the gravestone:sitting crossed legged in front of it. He wipes away the bit of dirt that has covered his father’s name. “I messed up the flowers. I hope you like them anyway. Auntie Nat said you probably would. She’s doing….”
“Hey, come here.” Tony opens his arms, smiling softly when Peter accepts the embrace and allows Tony to pick him up. Tony takes him back into the room and gently lowers himself down on the bed. Peter keeps his arms wrapped around Tony’s neck and rests his head on his shoulder.
“Harley. His name is Harley. And this is Sarah. The oldest is James.”
“I got it,” he hears Steve say in the darkness, followed by the bed shifting on his side. Tony blindly reaches out to stop him, but he’s not fast enough and he can already hear the soft sounds of Steve’s feet against the floor.
“Hi, sweetie.” Natasha grins. “You’re so handsome.”
Tony frowns and holds up a finger. “Just one more? Wait why am I asking you for permission. We’re doing it.”
The door to Tony’s side is being opened by none other than Happy. Tony breathes out a sigh of relief.
Tony sticks his tongue out and places the bags on the kitchen island. “Oh hey! What did you think of Michael? Cool, right?”
“Did he...date anyone?”
“Hey, look at me. I promise. I’m not going to leave you, ever. I’ll always be here, honey. And if that voice tries to tell you otherwise, don’t listen. Call me and I’ll stay up all night with you if I have to.”
“No.”
“I don’t want to leave again.” Peter pulls away from Bucky. “I like it here. I like living with you.”
“I’m so sorry,” Peter says, wincing at his own words. No amount of apologizing was going to save him. He might as well start preparing for Flash’s bullying to double by tomorrow.
Steve decides to go ahead and make an appointment with one of SHIELD’s doctors. The staff had been good to him during his previous pregnancies or regular check ups. He trusted them.
“What’s with all the fuss, kiddo?” Tony asks, frowning at his son. Peter whirls around in Steve’s arms at the sound of his daddy, his eyes immediately filling with fresh tears just for Tony.
“Do I sense another fight coming on?”
Steve can’t help but smile. “It’s a nice gesture. Thank you.”
“Unless you’re planning to breastfeed?” Pepper asks and she takes the gift to neatly place it on the floor near her feet. She takes another bag and gives it to him. “This one is from me.”
Flash makes sure no one is paying them any mind before he starts. “I want to talk to you about the…thing.”
Ned nods but doesn’t continue with the conversation. They talk about other things: homework, the upcoming math test, and possibly hanging out during the weekend. Peter’s sure his uncles wouldn’t mind.
“I mean it’s crazy.”
“It was bound to happen sooner or later. He’ll be going to college soon and then living on his own. Maybe get married. He can’t stay with us forever.”
JARVIS sighs. “He’s...thinking.”
“Baby steps, Tony,” Steve reminds him and he leans up to kiss him softly.
“Shut up, Spider-Boy.”
“But not like you. Come on, Brucie, please? I swear I’ll explain all of it once I figure some shit out, but I need you, buddy. And if that is my pup...Jesus, I can’t even begin to imagine that. Just find out for sure. Run some tests or something.”
The sun is just beginning to rise when Steve gets outside and on the track. Getting up this early wasn’t unusual for him. His morning runs have become part of his daily routine. It was going to be difficult to maintain once the baby arrived, but they still had months until then, and Steve was going to take advantage.
“You’re just jealous because she loves me more,” Bucky rubs behind Alpine’s ear affectionately, provoking another purr and soft meow.
“Beautiful.” Tony pulls away and rests his hands over Steve’s shoulders, meeting his husband’s sad eyes. “Honey, I don’t know how many times I have to say it but you’re so beautiful. I’ll say it every second of every day if I have to. Why don’t you see it?”
“Just say it. It’s only two words,” Sam says.
“You...don’t...have it in you. You think you’re stronger than me but...you’re weak. Always have been. You’re a worthless omega! You can’t fight!”
He called Pepper every chance he got to get updates, and it was relieving to learn that Alexander had stopped going by the tower. Tony knew better than to let his guard down, but at the same time he found himself relaxing.
“We’re broken. Tony, look at us. He’s here with you one week and then with me the next. That’s not what I envisioned.”
Peter nods his head, then he glances down at his lap. He hears Bruce move to the other side of the room, and when he peers up, he finds the doctor sitting at the desk and booting up his laptop. Peter’s been to enough appointments to know when all of the questions were about to start. He glances nervously at his papa, hoping all of the questions would be answered by him.
Tony places one last kiss to Steve’s lips before lying back and bringing Steve down with him. He threads his fingers through the omega’s damp hair, continuing to praise him. Steve pulls back slightly, glancing down between them and frowning.
Steve frowns. “Tony…”
Which is why it kills him for waiting this long to intervene.
“It’s not your fault, Steve. You did everything you could. Don’t blame yourself.”
“Heard the ruckus and stayed longer in the shower.”
“Oh my god,” Steve groans. “I don’t need to do that!”
There’s silence.
Happy sighs and glances at Peter again once they reach a red light. “Listen, Pete, don’t rush things with this guy okay? Maybe he has changed, but it’s better to be careful.”
Steve leans back in his seat, blowing out a breath now that he's made room for his lungs. Peter responds with a hard kick, aiming directly for Steve’s ribs and the Captain winces. He’d rather have his son beat him from the inside than suffer from another backache.
“He’s okay,” Tony tells them. He knows they don’t believe him. How could they when he doesn’t even believe his own words?
“So it wasn’t a dream. He’s really…” Peter’s eyes land on the empty chair, his heart sinking.
“Yeah I see that.” Tony rises to his feet and gestures for his son to do the same. When Peter frowns in confusion he says, “I better get you back. I don’t want to piss off the scary assassin.”
“It’s a long story.”
He doesn’t see any of his family while he explores the base, and it brings a sense of relief over him. He wouldn’t risk bumping into them and blowing his cover. That voice is back, this time to point out that he was also at risk of being caught by the wrong side. Peter didn’t want to imagine being captured. He’d just have to make sure he didn’t give the bad guys a chance to catch him.
Bucky gets up from the sofa to join Sam in the kitchen, opening the cupboards and taking out three plates to set the table with.
“Do you want more kids?”
Happy honks the horn again and the man jumps away. Tony cranes his neck to get a better look, his curiosity getting the best of him. He was used to having pedestrians jumping in front of the vehicle, but there was something different about this one.
When Peter is fussy and screaming at the top of his lungs, Dodger is there to comfort him with gentle licks. The first time Peter giggles is when Dodger makes him laugh by licking the bottom of his feet. It’s Dodger who’s there to clean up the mess Peter leaves behind after every meal, and he’s there to cuddle up with Peter for bed.
“Why do you need so much food?” Happy questions and he takes out the white takeout boxes. “Were the pancakes not good enough?”
“Honey, it’s okay,” Tony tries to assure, knowing where the conversation was going.
“Morning sickness sucks,” Tony says and reaches for more toilet tissue. “It’ll be over soon.”
“I know you want to...but I can’t. I still feel him.”
Peter smiles. “Thanks, Mr. Stark.”
Bruce frowns and his eyes roam around the space. He sighs. “You don’t have an ultrasound machine. How am I supposed to check the fetus?”
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
Peter continues to eat until his tummy’s full. Tony takes him so that he can burp him.
Steve’s face lights up and he takes the paper she offers to him, his smile growing at the sight of the perfect grade on top.
“I wasn’t expecting anything less.”
Natasha’s face breaks out into a grin.
Steve waves her off. “It’s okay. I can see now how bad that looked.”
Peter chuckles and twists open the lid of his soda. “Yeah. She’s awesome. Uncle Bucky thinks I should just focus on school but I want to be an Avenger.”
“You don’t sound so sure.”
“Good, good. I see the head,” The doctor announces.
“Maybe he’s not so bad,” Peter says, and with a small laugh adds, “he doesn’t really let you talk though. I was able to get a few words in but he loves talking. He told me to meet him tomorrow so maybe that’s good. I don’t know. I’m nervous and don’t know how to be around him. He’ll love me for me, right?”
Awww you guys this is the last chapter. I had a lot of fun with this story. You know I can't say no to pregnant Steve and all their adorable kiddos. I hope you all enjoyed this one and I just want to say that I love all of the support that you guys gave me. I really do have the best readers :)
“I think so. I mean, you risked your life to save others. If that’s not a selfless act then I don’t know what is. She’d be proud.”
Just like Tony predicted, he’s getting up from the sofa and making his way toward the bar he knows should’ve been emptied days ago. He decides to change it up, reaching for his best bottle of tequila and filling his glass.
Pepper rolls her eyes. “Sign those contracts. And stop being such a jerk.”
“Are you done?” Tony frowns. “I thought we were doing presents?”
“Good.” Peter seems pleased with that response and he scoots closer until his head is resting on Tony’s shoulder. “I love you, Dad.”
Peter peers at Tony for a second before dropping his gaze down to his lap. “Sorry,” he sniffs and turns his direction out the window.
“I promise.”
Steve is currently sprawled out on the couch Tony usually uses for a bed when he can’t muster the energy to drag his ass up the stairs. The blanket he’s stolen from upstairs is draped over his lap, having slipped off from the constant movement Steve made trying to get comfortable.
“Do you?” Natasha teases.
A comforting hand lays over his back, rubbing soothing circles as Peter vomits. Finally, Peter is able to pull away and he’s immediately handed some toilet paper to clean his mouth.
Steve shakes his head again and waves his husband away. “Get out of here, Stark.”
Steve smiles. “Yeah, sounds good.”
“The baby? Tony, you don’t have to-”
“Yes, Pete,” Steve finally answers. “I do have to go.”
“She’s so cute. She really looks like you, Mr. Stark.”
“If one on one isn’t working then I can recommend a group session,” Dr. Strange says. Steve’s ears perk up at that. It would help get him back out into the world and meet new people. People that were just like him.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut but he can’t hold back the tears any longer and they roll down his face. He keeps his arms at his side, fingers digging into the sheets when his body is rocked and pressed deeper into the bed.
“I love you too, traitor.”
“I know a doctor and I can set up an appointment okay? Bruce is really nice. You’ll like him,” Steve says.
The commotion ends abruptly when Rumlow returns with a bruised and bloodied Tony Stark. Tony is gripped tightly by the collar of his shirt and dragged down the stairs. Rumlow meets Steve’s eyes and with a smirk, tosses Tony down the last few steps.
Tony cuts him off. “I never said it was you.”
The stranger is still standing near the front of the car, a look of fear written on his face. Tony scans him for any signs of injury. The last thing he needs is to have hurt someone, or a lawsuit. Pepper would kill him for sure.
Tony’s lack of response is everything she needs to know, and she invites him in. Having been in Natasha’s private quarters a few times over the years, he’s comfortable enough to move through the space with ease. His destination is the couch and he places Morgan down on the floor, hunching over to unbuckle her and take her into his arms. He sits back with her in his arms, a sigh of relief escaping him.
“Please,” Steve nods and he scoops his little girl into his arms, pressing a kiss to her cheek. He glances at the two chairs across the room where his other two pups are currently sitting. Harley is all smiles with his grape lollipop. Steve can’t help but smile back.
“Hey, Petey.”
“Okay. How about daddy?”
“Dad, where are we?” Peter asks, his confusion only growing when his dad remains silent and continues to lead him away from the elevator and toward a part of the tower Peter’s never seen before.
He loved their son and some of the perks that came with being pregnant, but he had a lot of issues with it. Mostly his inability to keep up with the new changes to his body. It was a struggle and he couldn’t help but grow excited at the thought of finally being done.
“And no more babysitting,” Tony makes sure to throw in that extra perk.
“That’s right. The reason I went to the hospital yesterday was because there was something wrong with the baby. It stopped growing.”
“I was trying to protect you. Hydra saved your life. If SHIELD-”
Tony tries not to worry when Steve ignores his calls and texts, and again when hours pass and he’s still not home. He convinces himself that Steve was fine, probably out on a run or beating a few bags down in the gym. Those were usually the activities he did when he needed to clear his head. This was just another one of those times.
His breath hitches in this throat at the sight of the small figure. He had already seen the baby on the monitor but now he’s able to look at it even closer. He can clearly make out its tiny head and body. Even its arms and legs were visible.
Tony hums. “Yeah. We’ll figure it out okay? Let’s focus on this first. I don’t want you stressing out.”
“Tired.” Steve huffs and carefully lowers himself into the rocking chair Tony had put together a week prior. “I’m done being pregnant.”
“I don’t remember inviting you for dinner?” Bucky frowns.
“We don’t have ten minutes,” the alpha, Nat, snarls. She crouches down in front of Steve, ignoring the way he bares his teeth in defense. Her eyes scan over him again, brows furrowing in concern. “He’s hurt pretty bad and Stark is in worse shape.”
“Omega? Just a cover up. I heard you liked omega’s, Stark. I needed to get close to you.”
“Because…” Tony pauses and sighs. “You don’t know. I wish you’d believe me but I get it’s going to take time and trust. I screwed up really, really bad. I don’t blame you for being so hesitant. But just give me a chance to prove that I’ve changed.”
They stay a little longer than they should when saying goodbye to their son. Steve can’t hold back the tears that gather in his eyes when he sees Peter. He’s lucky enough to hold him, and he cherishes the last few minutes he has with him.
“And there’s so much for you and the kids to see. Steve, the world is different now and you deserve to see what you and the kids have missed. I want you to stop hiding and find your place.”
Tony smiles and stands. “You better get some sleep. Making a baby is tired stuff.”
He tries one more time with the tie, only to huff in annoyance and rip it off. It lands beside his feet and he kicks the sleek material away with a grumble.
“Apologizing is a start. He thinks you hate him.”
He must still be crying. “Nothing,” he’s quick to assure. “I’m just...I need a moment. I can’t…”
“Yeah, well I have a kid now and he just loves keeping me up. Huh, Kiddo? You like keeping Daddy awake all night?” Tony coos, reaching out to tickle Peter’s sock covered foot. Peter squirms from the touch.
Natasha smiles and pulls Steve into a hug. “You’re going to be fine.”
A little girl with long, dark hair emerges from the tunnel slide, wearing a smile similar to Steve’s. It’s Bucky who scoops her into his arms and she giggles when he kisses her cheek.
Steve sighs and shifts in his seat. “I already tried,” he says, deciding it was better to be honest. “He didn’t really give me a chance to explain but...I don’t think it would have mattered anyway.”
“Only for a little!” Peter adds.
Tony liked to spoil him, at least that’s what Steve had heard before. His birthday had been ridiculous and Steve was still finding confetti in the tower months later. Steve appreciated everything Tony did, but this Valentine’s Day, he didn’t want flowers, stuffed animals or gifts made of gold; all he wanted was Tony.
“Am I worth all that?” Steve asks.
“-or even a kiss-”
“And your parents are okay with it?”
Sam is the one who calls the meeting a few weeks later. His arm was healing nicely and no longer a concern of his. He couldn’t say that for his husband. Bucky was constantly checking on him and making sure he was comfortable. Sam enjoyed the break, but it was time to get back to business.
“I know.” Sam hugs Bucky tightly and presses a kiss to the nape of his neck.
When he returns, he’s relieved to find Tony finished and leaning against the wall. Steve steps further into the room, purposely avoiding the mess he knows he needs to clean up and flush away. He puts the seat down quickly to avoid it a little longer.
“You can’t wear that same shirt you wore last year. It was stupid and lame,” Tony says.
“Hurry,” Steve urges, forcing back a moan. “The pups-”
“He wasn’t perfect okay? He...he did things that I didn’t understand but I loved him anyway. Yeah his job was...probably the hardest job there is...but he only did it because he wanted to keep me safe. Every day he would tell me that he loved me and that he wanted me safe and happy.
The burp Peter releases is bigger than Tony expected and he can’t help the small giggle he makes in reaction to it.
“It’s okay,” Peter says softly and glances down to play with a loose thread on his comforter.
“Yeah.” Tony’s eyes open and he directs his gaze in Steve’s direction. “What’s with the face?”
“We have to go.”
Bucky chuckles softly against Sam’s neck. Sam smiles and pulls back slightly to see his husband’s face, and the small smile on his lips.
Tony turns and walks away. They don’t see each other after that.
“You good without me?” Tony asks, getting a nod from his friend. “Be quick if you can.”
Tony rolls his eyes and makes his way up the stairs. He finds the omega fast asleep in the large bed, still in the sweatshirt and curled around the pillows. He looks so tiny, so delicate.
He’s going to leave if Tony doesn’t do something quick. But he doesn’t know what to do or what to say. Steve knew how he really felt.
“Nah. I needed a break from the city. I can really think here,” Tony replies, leaning forward to resume tinkering away on the right boot of his suit. He probably wouldn’t put it on again, but it distracted him.
“May I suggest you speak with Mr. Rogers again?”
“I had a bad dream. It’s okay.” Steve holds his son close and kisses the top of his head.
“You and Peter are getting closer.”
“Nothing.” Steve chuckles and turns back to his own mess. The dining table was littered with ideas for their special day. He was trying to be organized, but planning a wedding wasn’t something he’s ever had to organize for. He never thought marriage would happen to him.
Harley frowns and sinks back in his seat. His broccoli is still untouched and getting cold.
Tony slips his hand away. “I’m fine. You better go.”
“Bruce is fine,” the beta says with a shy smile and he extends a hand for Steve to shake.
“Tony-”
. He didn’t even know these pups and already he was calling them his. Back when he had first met Steve and learned about the pup the omega was carrying, Tony had been ready to care for them both, even if the pup wasn’t his. These pups weren’t ones he’s sired, but that didn’t matter. He’d still be their father.
“I know. That’s all it’s ever been.”
Steve glances down at the car seat still firmly gripped in his hand. “Right. Thanks.”
Maybe Tony should’ve pushed more and refused Steve’s request to go home instead of being looked over. But again, Steve was stubborn and Tony had no choice but to take Steve up to their private quarters. They compromise, though. Steve promised to get looked over if he felt it was necessary.
“Yes I’m alone! I’m in your office. Why?”
He’s already on his fourth cup of coffee by the time Pepper comes into his office to inform him of the new interns. Tony chugs his drink down, ignoring the way his assistant frowns when he spills some of it on his tie.
“Jarvis is nice,” Steve tries to assure his children, “he won’t hurt you.”
Steve sighs and dresses quickly, then he joins Tony in bed and pulls him close, smiling softly when Tony doesn’t push him away.
Peter sinks in his seat. He wouldn’t be the favorite for long.
Tony places another kiss on the bump before pulling back to work Steve’s sweatpants down his legs. Steve lifts his hips to help, watching with darkened eyes as Tony removes the rest of his clothing. Steve’s cock springs free, resting against the underside of his belly. The head is red and leaking, smearing the precome.
Peter is even more excited about the tower than he was about the car. He doesn’t stop talking and pointing things out that excite him. Tony has to practically drag him away and out of sight from anyone still working. He prays that Happy and Pepper don’t cross their path. He’s not ready to introduce Peter to them yet.
Tony takes another step forward; Peter takes two back.
Tony remains quiet. He rubs a hand up and down along Steve’s arm, reminding him that he was still there. Steve eases into his touch.
Tony nods. They fall into an uncomfortable silence. Leaving would save them both from the awkwardness, but Tony can’t bring himself to leave.
“No!” Tony nearly shouts and gets up from his chair, needing to pace. “He shouldn’t have been so careless!”
“You’re so tiny. And you remind me of Steve. I’m waiting for you to say ‘I can do this all day,’” she says, her voice deepening as she does her best Steve Rogers impression.
The alpha moves closer to get a better look at the newborn pup, and his nose wrinkles in disgust when he gets a whiff of her. Steve growls again and brings his daughter closer. He knows what’s about to happen next.
“You love me?” Steve asks, his tone laced with uncertainty. His brows draw together and that smile he once wore has been transformed into a frown.
I think the next chapter will have a baby shower scene and maybe it's time Tony makes an appearance. I'll update as soon as I can!
Steve had decided long ago that he didn’t want one. He couldn’t imagine them trying again just to have a repeat. Losing their child had crushed him, made him believe he had done something wrong. Tony had to remind him countless times that it was no one's fault, and maybe that was true, but Steve always pinned the blame on himself.
“Good luck, Cap.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes. “I think I killed the mood.”
“He was-he was here.” Steve glances around the room, the panic setting in again. “He was here. He was on me. I couldn’t breathe-”
And there will also be a marriage proposal 😊
The first thing Tony notices when he enters the living room is Steve’s missing presence. Pepper and Happy are chatting on the sofa, laughing about something Tony missed. He frowns and makes his way over to his friends.
“You hungry?” Tony asks and shuts the fridge door. “I’m not much of a cook but I can order something.”
“We need to name him,” Tony says from his spot beside Steve. He reaches out to gently run a hand along his son’s back.
His Uncle Bruce is still on the jet. He hasn’t noticed Peter yet, too occupied with the controls and the screens he has to keep an eye on. It was the perfect distraction for Peter to sneak out.
But all of that changed once Peter came into his life. His family was the most important thing. They would always come first. The tech, the company, none of that mattered anymore. The whole reason why he signed over SI was so that he could be a devoted father and mate.
Steve glances down, a small gasp escaping him when he finds a small bump where his abs used to be. “What the hell?” He whispers.
“He’s still too young. He can’t lead us-” Clint starts to say, only for Bucky to cut him off.
“I used to be the same way after you were born. I thought they were going to love you more and I’d no longer be the favorite.”
“Good.”
“You okay, Cap?” Sam raises a questioning brow.
“Ouch. I thought I had no food?”
“Steve’s gone okay?” Sam says. “But we’re still here. We’re all that kid has left and if we’re going to act like this, then you know damn well he’ll go somewhere else. And I don’t know about all of you but I’m not losing that kid. I lost Steve, I lost my own child-”
Peter sends Ned a reassuring look. Ned gets the hint and sighs before heading in the opposite direction, making sure to give them one last look before rounding the corner.
“I’m kidding. And I did quit,” Tony says.
“Me, too.”
Peter shakes his head. “I’m good, dad.”
“I know things aren’t easy right now. I’m sorry you’re having to make these tough decisions, but we’re all here for you okay? If you want to try school then great. And if you want to wait a little longer than that’s okay too. I just want you to be happy.”
“Just uh finishing up the cake.” Steve gestures to the cake and the few candles he’s put on top.
“I want you like this. I want to see you.” Tony ducks his head down to capture Steve’s lips in another kiss.
“Yes,” Bruce smiles and he moves the transducer around to get a clear image. “I’d say you’re about twelve weeks.”
But eventually they were going to need to talk about it.
“Thank God,” Peter mutters and rushes out of the room.
“You didn’t say goodbye before I left.”
Their fertility problems were because of Steve. He was the reason why they struggled to have a family. It was his issues that prevented them from having their own simple life. Tony had been willing to sacrifice everything to carry their son, but it was evident that he was having regrets.
Steve doesn’t even register the tears until Tony points them out. He reaches up and feels wetness on his cheek. It only makes him cry more.
“Is it Pete? What did he do? Where is he?”
“I love you, Papa. I love you so much,” Peter whispers.
Peter nods. “I uh...I went to see him...it’s nice. People really cared about him. There’s flowers and candles…”
Peter’s face lights up, then a second later, his expression morphes into a frown. “I don’t know. I want to live with you but they…”
“Jesus, Tony. What do you know about him? Because from where I’m standing he looks like he’s some whack job-”
Bucky scoffs and leans back in his seat. His eyes land on Peter, the intense gaze making the teenager squirm in his chair.
“I know it’s not what you want to hear,” Rhodey says and he comes closer. He lays a hand over Tony’s shoulder and squeezes it. “I’m sorry.”
“I don’t care. Just leave me alone.”
“I know you’re not. And the world’s going to know that too. But he’s gone now and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Captain America is still needed. We’re all counting on you.”
“I am! I’m thinking about the pain he’s putting me through. Oh fuck!” Tony whimpers and more curses and cries of pain slip past his lips. He grows tired of standing in the middle of the room and has Steve escort him back to the bed. Lying down doesn’t help rid the pain.
“You came!” Peter cries in excitement and rushes to hug his dad. “I was almost afraid you wouldn’t.”
“She’s good,” Steve assures, giving his daughter a look over. Her hair is dark like Tony’s, and Steve just knows she’ll have his eyes too. “She’s beautiful, Tony. She looks like you.”
Tony smiles and brings Peter over. “I think he’s hungry again. Kid loves to eat.”
“Cool!” Peter smiles and comes over to greet the cat. She purrs when he scratches behind her ear. “Where did you find her?”
“Wake up, sleepyhead.” It’s Natasha’s voice and Steve rolls over, finding his friend sitting on the bed beside him, a bright smile on her face. In her arms is his son.
“Not yet. I’m not done. This is fun, right?”
“I know. Me too. Pep said something about a press conference I have to do. Don’t worry. You and the kids don’t have to be a part of it.”
“Keep it together?” Peter asks.
It had taken a while for Steve to adjust, but once he did, he smiled for the camera. It was shy and reserved, but it was a smile. The one Tony knew he’d never get enough of.
“Yeah,” Steve smiles and lays his hand over Tony’s.
“What kind of name is that? Why aren’t you taking this seriously?”
“He called me because you can never respond to anyone.”
“I didn’t know Tony had...company,” she says and she steps further into the room. “I shouldn’t be surprised. This happens a lot.”
“You don’t sound so sure.”
“I didn’t say that. I want to keep it.”
The Avengers gather in the common room, just like they’ve done countless times before. Only this time it’s not to discuss assignments, celebrate victories, holidays, or just to laze around on their day off. There were no smiles, laughter or conversation of any kind. The room is silent.
“Always.” Natasha smiles softly. Her smile quickly falters. “I didn’t say anything to him. He asked a few times but it’s not my place to tell him. He’s going to take it hard.”
Steve smiles and trails a hand between them to get to the small bump he can’t get enough of. He rubs along the curve of Tony’s belly.
Hi! I hope you all are having a good weekend and staying safe. I'm sad I have to work tomorrow, and I wanted to get a few things updated before the workweek starts back up again. I know I had originally put that this story would end after two chapters, but there was a few requests for more and I just couldn't say no. I don't know how long this story is going to be, so we'll just see I guess. There is a birth scene in this one, so just a heads up. Anyway here is the next chapter!
“Red?” Tony asks and Harley nods. “Can you say red, kiddo? We did colors yesterday, remember?”
“Just a dream?” Steve echos and Tony nods his head. “It felt so real. I’m sorry, Tony. I didn’t mean it.”
I hope you all enjoyed this story as much as I enjoyed writing it. These two really went on a journey, but don’t worry I have more in store for them. I’m thinking sequel and prequel 🤔
“I’m right here,” Bucky soothes and Steve curls up against him, burying his face in Bucky’s chest.
“You don’t even remember meeting him? Tony! I thought you were done with that?”
It’s almost time for Petey to arrive! And of course their other baby 😉
Luckily Peter hadn’t asked where his daddy was or why other kids in his class have two parents and he only has one. Steve was dreading for that day to happen. He didn’t know what he was supposed to say if and when he was asked about Tony. Hopefully that time wasn’t any time soon.
Steve shakes his head and releases his hold on Tony. He backs away. “No you don’t. You don’t do the things that you did if you love someone.”
“Sorry, kiddo. Peter. I think I’m going to name you Peter. And don’t ask about a middle name because I don’t know. I don’t even know if you’re going to be a Rogers. I’m trying, Pete. But the truth is...I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Bucky huffs out a laugh. “I’m going. Someone has to make sure your ass comes home.”
“Yeah. I didn’t stay that long at the cemetery,” Peter says and shrugs off his backpack, settling it down in the foyer before entering the living room to collapse on the sofa.
“No,” Tony says with a small chuckle. “Honestly, you look adorable. Cutest spiderling around.”
“I guess I should've checked there,” Peter winces.
And now these two are fighting 🤦♀️ Don’t worry they’ll make up and everyone will be happy again. I teased a baby shower before but now it’s happening and then we’re getting closer to the birth!
“You’re right,” Tony nods in agreement. “This already happened to me.”
*sigh* These two... why do they have to be so difficult! I think some fellow teammates need to get involved and question Stony’s stupid idea to stay broken up. Clearly these fools still love each other!
Steve huffs. “Yeah, I guess so.”
When Bucky shifts in his seat, Sam quickly squeezes his hand again. He’s met with a gentle squeeze back.
His experiment was supposed to help his son avoid doing what he had done years ago. Tony had hoped if Peter relived that moment that he might come out stronger than he had before. But now as Tony watches Steve’s final moments, he regrets putting Peter through this a second time.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “I needed to go. I couldn’t imagine sending you into that mess and you coming back like this or worse. Not when Pete needs you the most.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smiles softly. “I like him a lot.”
“You’re in a good mood.” Tony points out when Steve joins him at the table.
“It was a mission. I don’t know all the details. I guess there was some base in Russia or something with stolen weapons. I don’t even know what kind, but I guess it was serious. Papa’s job was to go in and retrieve them and shut down the operation. And he almost did. I sort of snuck in because I wanted to help.”
“Emails? Oh! Yeah, of course. I’m gonna do that right now actually.”
“How can I help?” Tony asks and lowers his glass. It’s empty now and he can’t help but frown at it.
And don’t worry about Peter and Tony. They’ll work things out.
He relied on FRIDAY to keep him updated, and it wasn’t until she mentioned alerting medical personnel did Tony lose his composure. He didn’t want to believe that Steve had done anything to harm himself. That wasn’t Steve; he would never do that. At least, that’s what Tony wanted to believe. Steve was different now. He wasn’t the same.
“Um.” Steve swallows hard. He knew he was going to be asked questions like this, and he wishes he would have prepared himself to answer them.
“Yes you can,” the doctor assures from between his legs. He can barely make out the dark hair atop her head. He wants to ask her about Steve since it was her who had been with him last, but the chance never comes and he’s forced to push again. “Good! Keeping pushing, Tony. He’s almost here.”
“I want to train him,” Steve repeats, making sure his tone is cool and collected. Nick leans forward in his seat, letting out a heavy sigh. “Sir, I know he’s still young but he has potential.”
The elevator arrives and the doors open, interrupting their conversation. Peter doesn’t make any effort to keep it going, knowing what kind of direction it was heading in. He didn’t want to discuss living situations when he wasn’t sure who he wanted to live with.
Steve nods. “Okay.”
“Good,” Flash appears more at ease now. Then he’s pointing a threatening finger in Peter’s face. “And nobody ever will. You got that?”
“Door open, okay?” Steve reminds, giving both teenagers a soft smile. He leaves, making sure the door is wide open.
Tony sighs when he goes ignored and the omega storms up the stairs. A door can be heard slamming shut.
“She’s a piglet,” Tony teases. That makes Steve laugh. It’s not the gut busting laugh he’ll let slip from time to time, but one day it will be. One day he’d laugh again until he cries. Tony couldn’t wait for that day.
Tony was a wonderful father. Steve had been hesitant at first, not sure how Tony was going to be taking on a huge, responsible role. There was a difference between running a billion dollar company and raising a couple of pups. But Tony was already proving that he could do both.
Harley is still pouting when Morgan enters the living room. He glances up at her and smiles, showing off the gap in the front row of teeth.
It leaves him breathless and wanting more.
“Daddy, can we watch the movie now?” Peter asks.
Tony groans. “This is torture. You’re lucky I love you and this kid. But now I’m thinking I hate you just a little bit.”
The soft snoring Alpha makes is the only sound in the room. Steve lies awake, tangled in the alpha’s arms. He listens closely to the breathing in his ear, his body shivers from the heated air against his skin. He waits to make sure Alpha is in a deep sleep.
Steve sighs again and reaches for the small wastebasket, his grip on it slipping and sending the soiled contents to the floor. Steve curses and begins gathering the trash.
“Good. I’ll be...well...you know where I’ll be.”
“Wait!” Steve calls out when Tony turns to leave. “Don’t go. Please. I’m sorry but I’m a little-please…”
“I’ll sign them in a minute,” he mutters and pulls out his phone, his finger hovering over a number he should’ve called a long time ago.
The first thing Tony does when he gets inside the tower is make his way toward his private office. He ignores the questions Happy throws at him, unable to fully answer them. To be honest he doesn’t know what the hell just happened. All he knows is he had disappeared off the grid for a while and now he was being forced back into this life.
Pepper shoots him a smile, then she leaves the office and shuts the door behind her.
“Don’t quit. You can make time for him and the company.”
Steve only wishes she had decided to make her grand entrance when Tony was still in town. He had been called for a meeting in Hong Kong to address some of the issues his tower was experiencing. It wasn’t something he could easily get out of-Pepper made sure of that- but he had assured Steve he'd make it back before Morgan arrived.
”Tony’s fine. Can you call him please?”
“Not much but I have another crazy idea,” Tony replies.
“I don’t know how he does it. He finds other alphas and brings them to me.”
Tony frowns, clearly offended. “Excuse me, big guy. We can’t all look like you. I know I’m tiny.”
Tony watches them for a moment. He doesn’t miss the way Steve’s body relaxes and that infectious smile of his appears. Steve seemed at ease around Sam, something Tony wishes the soldier would show around him. Steve had only worked with Sam once, and yet they appeared as if they had been friends for years.
The next room he’s taken to is familiar. It’s a complete contrast to the one he was in before. The walls are painted a deep red and the floor is a shiny hardwood, but it’s not the burst of color that captures Steve’s attention.
“Too much?” Tony smirks and Steve nods his head. “I thought you want to cum?”
“Hey,” Tony quickly interrupts. “I don’t care that we’re not together anymore. I’m still going to help you with Pete. I’m not going to flake out on you.”
“Is he back?”
It hadn’t started out bad. For once Tony was in a good mood and not uncomfortable from the pregnancy. He had been the one to initiate it. Steve was never one to deny sex, but now he was starting to wish he had.
Tony couldn’t help but grow overwhelmed with the items he receives for his son. Diapers he knew were a big thing to have, but some of the other gifts were just too much. How many pairs of shoes did his son even need? The kid wasn’t going to be wearing shoes anyway.
“She’s okay,” he eventually says with a small shrug. “She misses you and it’s hurting her really really bad. But I think Uncle Bucky is in worse shape. You guys were best friends so...I mean, I’d be a mess too if I lost Ned. Uncle Sam is taking care of him. He’s...struggling too, though. He’s trying to keep everyone from falling apart and I think it’s taking a toll on him. He doing his best.
They share a smile and Steve just knows that Sam understands what he’s trying to say.
“Be nice,” he whispers and pecks Tony’s cheek again.
“Tony, you need to try harder. I don’t think he trusts you yet.”
When he enters the room, Steve immediately snaps his head up. He doesn’t appear any different from when Tony last saw him. But of course he had only been gone a few minutes. It wouldn’t be possible for Steve’s attitude to lift in such a short duration.
A part of Tony hates that he’s the harm Steve doesn’t know about.
“Eh.” Tony shrugs and takes another sip from his glass, wincing at the bitter taste. “It’s not all fun and games, kid. It’s dangerous, you’re always having to watch your back.”
“Sore. But I’ll be alright. How’s the team?”
“It’s-I-it’s um…” Peter’s vision blurs with tears and he peers up at his papa, completely ignoring his dad. “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
Steve smiles. “Thanks, Sam. You wanna race back? I think I can slow down and let you win for a change.”
“Yeah. Do you want to say hi to daddy?”
Steve and Tony share a look before Steve is answering the question with a nod. He glances down at his son, a smile forming over his face.
“I know. But if it means Harley misses out on your attention-”
“Maybe I’m getting better at this,” Tony says and Peter nods his head while giving him a thumbs up. Tony chuckles and ruffles his son’s hair. “Slow down there, kiddo.”
“I can’t do this anymore. It hurts. Tony, it hurts.”
“It’s the waiting. It could last hours. Hopefully, it’s not too long for me.”
“You are,” Tony says, almost as if he can read Steve’s thoughts. “I don’t know what the others did...but I won’t do that to you.”
They have a baby.
“Not...working…” Tony groans and squeezes Steve’s arms tighter. “I want the drugs. I need the fucking drugs, Steve. She promised me.”
“JJ?”
“Honey, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, brows drawn together in a concerned frown.
“Steve,” Tony says softly and comes closer until he’s close enough to his husband to properly comfort him. He drops down on one knee in front of Steve and places a hand over his thigh, rubbing the area soothingly. “You’re going to be enough. She knows how much you love her. You wouldn’t have left if you didn’t care about her.”
“Pretty sure that’s Hulk,” Sam teases.
“Careful what you wish for,” Tony teases with a wink, then he turns toward his son and scoops him into his arms. “Time for bed, squirt.”
Steve lets out a shaky breath and he buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. “You feel so good.”
The alpha had apologized. No other alpha has ever done that before. They usually took what they wanted and left; no apologies, no regrets. But this one had shocked Steve the moment he apologized.
“He wants another? Four isn’t enough?”
Bucky smiles. “I remember. We used to play too. You always made me the bad guy.”
“But that doesn’t mean you get pushed aside. We’ll do better. No more Spider-Man-” Tony begins to say and Morgan quickly shakes her head when she catches the hurt expression on her brother’s face.
They give each other a high five.
Tony gets up to apologize with a kiss. “I’ll be there for the next one.”
Steve heaves out a heavy sigh. He opens his mouth to add to the conversation, only to shut it when he hears the distinct sound of the front door opening and shutting. Tony must’ve heard it too because he’s ready to make a beeline for the exit, but Steve is faster and grips his arm tight.
. The fear was still there.
Steve tips his head back against the wall, settling his gaze on the bulb above him. He breathes steadily through each contraction. The pressure in his pelvis increased; it was almost time to push.
“I’m sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I love you.”
He lays Morgan down in her crib and makes sure she’s comfortable before heading to the master bedroom. The door is open, giving Tony a perfect view of Steve. He’s sitting on his side of the bed, back hunched over and hands playing with something Tony can’t quite see. It’s not until he steps further into the room does he realize the object in Steve’s hand is the bottle of pills.
“Here? Hell no. The lab isn’t safe. Pepper gets mad when I live here.”
“Yeah? And how is that going? Because he looked pretty hurt to me.”
“I knew you would. You have your dad’s brains.”
The call ends and Tony expects to feel at ease now that he’s heard his mate’s voice, but he’s still worried. Steve assured him the pain wasn’t something to be concerned over, and Tony had no choice but to believe him. Steve’s done this before, he knows how this works.
“Sir, I don’t understand. Why me?” Steve asks.
Steve doesn’t return any of his calls or messages that night. Tony is forced to lie awake and wonder what he’s supposed to do from here.
“Papa!” Peter tries to rush toward them, but someone is holding him back.
Both alphas have their guns out and raised in Steve’s direction.
“N-Nat.” Steve gasps and he tips his head back, hissing through gritted teeth when she touches him again.
“They don’t look…too bad.” Steve does his best not to wince as he says this. Judging by the look on his son’s face, he knows he’s failed.
“But I wanted that baby. I wanted us to have a family and live that simple life.”
With a sob he drops to his knees, unable to stand anymore. He doesn’t care that the rain is pouring harder now, drenching his suit, a shiver running through him and bones aching from the cold. None of it mattered.
Tony and Bucky don’t break each other’s gaze. Staring into the eyes of The Winter Soldier had Tony’s blood running cold. These had been the last eyes his parents had stared into before their lives were brutally taken from them.
“Harley.” Steve’s voice is stern and he pushes the plate back toward his son. “Eat.”
Movement catches his eye. The man from before is rising to his feet and Steve prepares for another round, but it never comes. A new figure emerges from the shadows, a flash of black and red filling Steve’s line of vision. The man goes down in seconds. He doesn’t get up again.
Bruce nods and slips his glasses back over his eyes. “Keep him comfortable. The stress isn’t good for him or the pup.”
“Steve,” Pepper says, the name coming out slightly breathless. “It’s him.”
“Thanks, I think.”
“Not outloud.”
Dodger seems happy with that answer and he barks again. Tony can’t help but smile and he reaches out to scratch behind Dodger’s ear.
Sam and Bucky share a look, then Bucky turns back to Peter and sighs. “You’re right. I guess I’ve been hanging onto the past. Him leaving didn’t hurt me, I wasn’t even a part of the team before he up and left. But I was angry because he hurt my best friend and my nephew.”
Steve is careful when he takes his daughter into his arms. He’s immediately transported back to the night he gave birth to her, alone in a dark room with no one to aid him. She had been the reason why he decided to fight back against Hydra.
Steve runs.
“Shit.” Tony gasps and reaches for his son, sobbing softly once Peter is in his arms and laid on his chest. “H-hey, kiddo. You’re here. You’re finally here.”
Steve gives in. “Okay.”
“Are you ignoring us now?” Sam asks, his tone teasing.
“No...no...s-stop...please.”
Steve’s jaw clenches. He’s getting angry, but the pink hue that appears over his face isn’t from the anger. Tony’s only seen Steve blush like this before, back when he had too much to drink and Steve had some of Thor’s mead. Tony never expected after that to have the famous Captain America in his bed.
Peter frowns at the pair of simple looking sunglasses sitting inside the case. “I’m...confused. Are these super expensive or something?”
A soft sniff and then Peter is looking up at him, his own dark eyes full of tears. “I’m sorry, mama. I was just playing. He told on me!” Peter points at his brother.
“That’s not possible.”
“It’ll take time. We can just go on more dates. Let’s make it a once a week thing if we can. You need a break from being a full time mommy.”
Steve gives in and pushes again, this time making it through the full countdown. Tony continues to hold his hand and build him up with his encouraging words. It’s not long after until Bruce is announcing that he can see the head. Tony grows curious and peers between Steve’s legs, his eyes widening slightly at the sight of the dark hair beginning to emerge.
It’s late when Steve is jolted awake. He lets out a groan from being disturbed from the decent night of sleep he’s gotten in a while. Peter hadn’t fussed like he usually does and their night together was a lot calmer than what they have been. Steve rolls over onto his back and listens, ears straining for the familiar sound of Peter’s cries. But no sound comes through the baby monitor.
Steve smiles. He continues to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. He’s taken back to the night when they had done this for what was supposed to be the last time.
“Tony, you didn’t-”
Tony accepts the hand and shakes it, making sure his grip is firm. “Tony Stark.”
At least, Steve hoped and prayed they would be. He knew better than to let his guard down around Alpha, no matter the distance between them. Alpha was strong and smart, always one step ahead. Steve was lucky to have escaped when he did. But he wasn’t ready to celebrate his success just yet.
“Sorry,” Peter says and dabs gently. “It stings.”
“I promise I’ll tell you everything but right now I have to go.”
“Tony, he didn’t have a home,” Steve says, as if that was going to be enough to convince his boyfriend to reconsider. “Look how happy he is.”
“J, where is he?” Tony asks after his failed attempt of searching upstairs.
“Duh!” Peter immediately rushes over to the lineup of Iron Man suits. “This is awesome. Why did you stop?”
Tony laughs. “Well yeah. Kids need a bunch of crap.”
Steve takes this time to explore the rest of the penthouse. He didn’t get much of a tour on the day he first arrived. At the time, all he wanted to do was clean up and get some sleep. But now that he’s refreshed and opening up, he can’t help but want to look around his new home.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony quickly apologizes, then he turns to Steve. “I need your shield and helmet.”
“It’s-it’s you. You’re-” The omega stops, cutting himself off when the front door of the car opens and Happy steps out.
“You should be. Go ahead. Yell at me all you want. Bring it on.”
“I can’t.” Steve pants and he pulls back. He leans back on his haunches and runs a hand through his sweaty hair. “I’m sorry. Tony, I just can’t.”
With his body preparing for his upcoming rut, he grows anxious and he finds himself unable to sit still. He paces around the space, trying to think about anything other than the urge to mate with the omega upstairs.
“Yep. So much stuff I didn’t even know what to do with it. Would’ve rather had affection but well...whatever.”
“Guess Hydra beat you to it.”
Steve smiles. “Good. Sounds like you had fun. I wish I could say the same.”
“I think he wants it directly from the source,” Steve jokes and Tony laughs.
“Thank you.”
“I...I…”
Tony turns toward him. “It’s okay, Pete.”
Tony had been interrupted from his newest project when he had received the alert. He can’t decide what was worse: Steve’s screams or the way his body tossed and turned as he fought off the person only he could see. Tony decides that both were things he never wanted to experience again, and he can’t imagine what it must’ve been like for Steve.
They end up spending most of the night down in the lab. Tony had told his son a bit about the project, but the rest was a surprise. He wasn’t sure if it would work, but he’s keeping his fingers crossed. They needed to find a way to cope and heal.
“Well it has been months since we’ve last seen each other. Maybe I’ve just changed.”
Morgan snaps him from his thoughts when she squirms in his arms and once glance down shows her face contorting in distress. Tony waits for the crying to start, but when she relaxes and drifts off to sleep, he can’t help but sigh in relief. His goal right now was to keep her content so that his husband could get a few hours of rest.
“Huh? Oh yeah,” Tony glances down quickly at his shirt before looking back up at Steve. “I think you’d benefit from it more.”
“Say no more.”
I’ll update soon!
“Me too. Fuck, Cap you feel so good,” Tony rasps, his voice thick with arousal. He’s so close.
“Is he at least nice? I’ve read that Tony Stark is kind of a...wait...am I allowed to say? I don’t want to offend you or anything.”
“Pregnant?”
“Did it!” Steve yanks back the collar of his shirt to expose the mark Tony had put there. “Did this mean anything or were you just feeling sorry for me?”
Tony chuckles. “Well get used to them, kid. You’ll be living with me now.”
And it was true. During the next visit Steve shows improvement, and again after that one and the one after that. He’s smiling more, even laughs when Tony tells one of his lame jokes.
Tony was still hesitant when it came to the pup. The results haven't come in yet and every day Tony was growing more and more anxious. He had decided he’d care for the pup despite whatever the results state. Steve was going to need someone.
The feed cuts off. The footage did nothing to awaken any memories from last night. If anything, it made Tony feel worse. He should’ve remembered something.
It’s obvious that Peter's initial wish to leave the space alone has been granted. Everything is how Peter remembers. The kitchen is still tidy along with the living room, except for the layer of dust covering most surfaces. Pretty normal.
“Of course.”
“The worst,” Peter says sadly.
It’s the strange scent that Steve picks up first. The aroma of leather wafts through the air. Steve wrinkles his nose and his stomach coils tightly from the smell. It clicks in his brain instantly. Only one alpha had this scent.
I’ll update soon!
“I like to change it up.”
Steve nods, liking the idea. For years he had kept everything bottled up, and now he was finally starting to open up. There were still details about his life that he hadn’t said, but that was going to take time. Tony assured him he’d be there and listen whenever Steve was ready to talk.
All of the fear and anxiety seems to vanish the second his son is in his arms. There’s a hint of it that still lingers, but the love and devotion he feels for his son outweighs everything else. He’d do anything for his son.
(See the end of the chapter for
Happy makes a face of disgust. “Didn’t need to know that.”
Tony rolls his eyes and rises to his feet, stumbling momentarily before Steve is catching him. “I’m fine,” he assures again. “I think I’m gonna sit this one out.”
“No,” Steve sighs. “Fine. I’ll let Nick know things have changed.”
“You know…” Tony says after a few minutes of silence passes between them. “I think I could go again.”
“Where are they?” Steve demands, his tone and scent bitter. The alpha only stares at him, his lips forming a smirk. Steve growls and slams Pierce back, emitting a small grunt of pain from the man. “Where are they!”
Steve sighs harshly. “Let me check on your brother and-”
“I kn-it’s okay. Yell at me all you want.”
“You,” Steve doesn’t even hesitate to respond. “I want you. You’re my mate, my alpha. But...please go slow.”
Oh man this chapter came out way longer than I thought! Also I did warn that this story was kinda dark and this chapter does have some dark and messed up themes. There is a rape scene in this. I didn't make it horribly graphic but it's still not a pretty scene. If that's too triggering than by all means skip it. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up!
Then the scene begins to dissolve until it’s gone and the lab reappears.
Steve is the calmer of the two. No surprise there. He seems content. Tony wishes Steve would share some of that calmness with him. While Steve rests, Tony is restless, pacing the floor of the private room and trying to find a way to calm his nerves.
“No, Tony-”
“I wish I did more,” Bucky says, a shaky breath escaping him. He’s crying again. “If I just would’ve...he’d still be here.”
Steve sighs and turns his body so that he can face Tony. He’s greeted with the sight of his back, but he knows that if he could see Tony’s face, he’d find pain. Steve gets up and steps into the kitchen, coming up behind Tony and wrapping his arms around him. The alpha jumps from the touch, then he’s relaxing.
Pepper pulls away and gestures for another tissue, then she tries to clean up the black smudges her mascara left behind. “And now I have to talk to the police and...and…” she pauses to take a deep, shaky breath. “This is all wrong. It doesn’t make any sense!”
After the session ends and the last member has left, Steve lingers behind and helps Sam clean up and rearrange the room.
Tony takes a second to think it over. “It won’t be easy. Plus you have school and your family.”
“Okay, kiddo,” Tony quickly steps in to silence his son’s rambling. “I think it’s time to let him sleep, hmm? He had a busy day.”
Peter had been the only one able to pull Tony out of his funk and start creating again. It was Peter who got Tony to quit drinking. And it was Peter who made Tony get back in the suit.
“If they did it would definitely be you. I’m really sorry about how selfish I’ve been lately. I don’t want you to feel left out. We’re a team, remember?”
It makes him sick just thinking about the way they created that baby. It was all wrong. It was disgusting. It was evil.
“Daddy, I cleaned all my toys!”
“Maybe he’s in the bathroom,” Happy says. “Your omega can’t be around you all the time.”
Peter shakes his head. He’d have to go to the nurse’s office and then risk his parents being called. His papa would probably have the flexibility to pick him up and he was the last person Peter wanted to see. His papa would smother him when all Peter wanted was some space.
Steve wasn’t going to allow himself to care. Maybe he was still bitter about Tony abandoning the team, or maybe he was angry about the feelings he had for his old teammate. Tony had made it perfectly clear that what they did was to never repeat itself and shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Steve should be fine with that, but deep down he’s hurt.
Anyway! Thank you so much for reading! I'll update soon! :)
“What?” Steve asks and then he glances down at the test in his hands, for a moment forgetting what he was holding. “No! No it’s not mine. I’m not pregnant.”
Natasha lips curl into a smirk. Tony knows her next response is just going to be like the others before it. She was trying to make him feel guilty. And damn it, it was working.
“It doesn’t? You’re not having...a contraction right about now?”
“What are you gonna be Papa?” Peter asks, and now there are suddenly two pairs of brown eyes on Steve.
“But you guys did it. Papa knew the risks but he still did it.”
He figures Steve is following his nightly routine, and that the light would shut off when he was ready. Tony allows his eyes to shut, only for them to open a few seconds later when he picks up on a sound coming from down the hall.
Steve nods, his smile faltering. “I do miss him though. He’s very cuddly.”
“Look, kid. I’m busy okay? I…” Tony pauses for a moment and then says, “I’ll meet you tomorrow.”
“They’re still calling?” Tony asks and Pepper nods. Steve doesn’t bother to ask what the hell they’re talking about.
Fingers brush through his hair, just like they always did when Peter was upset. Peter holds onto Steve tighter, small whimpers escaping him.
Peter falls asleep soon after, the movie forgotten. Bucky scoops him up and carries him to his bed, not wanting to leave his nephew to sleep alone tonight. Peter curls up with his favorite bear and Bucky kisses him goodnight.
The drinking was no longer a coping mechanism for him anymore. He’s proud to say it’s been a few months since he’s reached for the bottle. Even though Peter chose to step back and think, he was still working on Tony. It was crazy just how much that kid affected him.
“Thanks,” Steve mumbles and wipes around his mouth. “I don’t know what came over me.”
Tony sighs and pulls out his phone. He taps quickly on the screen until he’s pulling up images from his security footage. The first video still is of Alexander Pierce.
“I’m terrified. I thought having Dodger would help, but caring for a dog and a baby are completely different.”
“Steve? Steve, are you the-”
Steve nods. “Okay.”
“You? When have you ever grounded me?” Peter grins.
The rest of the drive is surrounded in silence. All Peter can think about is his uncle. He wonders if his Uncle Sam is okay and if the rest of the team is staying strong. The message had sounded urgent, and that terrifies Peter. He couldn’t lose another family member.
Steve kisses him again, gently this time, then pulls away and turns his body, positioning himself in a way a good omega is supposed to. It’s what alphas like.
“I know I don’t need a bodyguard anymore-” Tony starts to say, only for Happy to scoff and roll his eyes. “I said anymore! I’m fine now. Anyway, Pep and I were thinking that you’d be great as Head of Security. It has great benefits.”
“How is this fun? I had to pee in a cup, get poked with needles, answer thousands of questions, and now I’m in a dark room with a weird bed. I want to go home.”
Peter smirks and one brow arches. “Oh yeah?”
“You are and you’re giving birth. Push.”
“I’m sorry he’s your baby daddy.”
Tony smiles softly at the confession. He places a hand over Peter’s shoulder and squeezes the area gently. “You’re a good kid, Pete. And it’s not stupid. I see you as a son. I know Morgan loves you and you’d make a great big brother.”
Tony is forced to let her go on and on about pulling himself together and stepping up to be a father. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes at this. He knows that’s exactly what he needs to do and damn it he was trying.
“Pizza!” Peter cries and scrambles to his feet. “Please! We haven’t had it in weeks!”
“Okay, okay,” Tony says in defeat. “I’ll stop. For now…”
Peter stands proudly at the end of the line, mimicking his siblings and presenting his own shirt for Steve to read. It says: My daddy?
“I know.” Tony nods. “We can talk about this later okay? Right now I need to get you down to medical.”
Tony nods and carefully places their youngest in Steve’s arms. The older pups grow curious and crane their necks to get a better look at the stranger. Harley leans closer to sniff the baby.
“Tempting but if he’s anything like Tony he’ll just squirm the whole way.”
“Come on.” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand and attempts to pull him up, only to stop when Steve cries out again.
Alpha returns with his drink. He eyes the barely touched food and shakes his head with disapproval. “I offer you a night in my private quarters and you can’t even appreciate my generosity. I’ve considered having you stay here full time-”
Natasha doesn’t seem too convinced, not that Tony was expecting her to be. There were days when he wasn’t convinced with his own words either.
He remains by Steve’s side until he’s sure the omega is content again before slipping away. He leaves the door open in case he needs to listen for him again. JARVIS would likely alert him again, but Tony doesn’t want to take the chance. He can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if he didn’t get to Steve on time.
“The pups?”
“That’s why talking is good. Now go talk to your husband,” Pepper says.
Steve sighs and rolls his eyes. Tony knows a fight is about to break out, and he decides to put an end to it before it begins. “Steve, I’m sorry. I just...he’s everywhere and you’re always ignoring me-”
Tony opens up his arms. “Come here, squirt. It’s daddy’s turn.”
It was obvious by the look on Steve’s face that he wasn’t pleased with Tony. The meeting regarding the issues in Hong Kong wasn’t something Tony could get out of-Pepper wouldn’t allow it even if he begged her. He was thankful he didn’t have to travel to the tower; a virtual meeting would suffice until Tony could find the proper time to pop in for a visit. But Steve still refused to wipe that frown off his face.
“Hey.” Tony holds up a hand to stop the rambling. “Lose me? Kid, I’m not going anywhere.”
I was in bed for 12 hours so I’m feeling a little better. I hope everyone is doing good and staying safe!!
“I’m here for you okay? If the party becomes too much then I’ll shut it down. Steve would understand.”
“Wait, James-” Natasha tries to say but Bucky isn’t listening. He makes his way toward Tony, anger flashing in his eyes and metal fist clenched.
“Can I see?” Pepper asks and Tony flips the screen to show off his sleeping son. Pepper coos in response. “He’s getting so big! Aww he’s so precious. You’re spoiling him, huh?”
“More important than his son!” Clint yells.
Tony sighs. “Look, kid, I’m trying to figure this out. I know it’s awkward and weird but I’m learning okay? I have no idea how to be a father. I just met you yesterday so it’s going to take time.”
“Hydra’s.”
“Bucky!” Steve cries, transferring most of his weight onto his best friend. Bucky holds him up, just like he used to do when they were kids. Some things never change.
“Let Pep and I work on a story and if it works then great. You can get out of the tower more, we can take the kids to...to Disney World! Something. I want you to be happy with this life.”
His heart is racing and his palms grow sweaty. He wipes his free hand on the front of his jeans. The other is gripping the envelope tightly.
“You did so good, sweetheart,” he praises.
“You did good,” Tony praises and leans closer to connect their lips. He pulls back slightly and his attention is drawn to the cuffs still tightly secured around Steve’s wrists. He removes them and Steve’s arms fall to his side. “You okay?”
“I figured. You didn’t have to come all the way out here, kiddo.”
“I won’t break this one. You’re my son and I love you. I wish I had done better, I really do. But if you want to leave then I can’t stop you. I’ll always have a place for you at the tower if you ever want to come back.”
When he gets to the medical wing, he finds Natasha outside of Steve’s private room, her green eyes bright and full of tears. He doesn’t even need to ask what’s happened.
“Don’t worry, Sam. I’m not sneaking out. Even if I wanted to you probably wouldn’t notice.”
Someone is pulling him back and into their arms; it’s his aunt.
Luckily, Jarvis isn’t upset. He actually sounds more concerned than anything.
“Dad, what’s going on?” Peter asks, worry seeping into his tone. “What did I do?”
“This room. You brought me here to talk.”
“I know. Just tired. Stayed up late with...homework.”
Another sob builds in Steve’s throat. He squeezes his eyes tighter to prevent any more tears from falling, but then they shoot open when his head is turned to the side. His eyes immediately land on his alpha.
“Good morning, darling,” Tony murmurs and presses a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck. Steve sighs softly and leans back against the alpha.
“Yeah.” Tony finds himself agreeing. It surprises both himself and Steve. For the longest time it appeared that Tony would never give the dog a chance. But he’d do anything for Steve. “Don’t get your hopes up, Cap. We’re not friends yet.”
Peter frowns and sits down beside Tony. “We’re doing cake now.”
The room only consists of the interviewer; a nice omega woman with a warm smile. The rest is the camera crew and a producer. It may not seem like a lot, but to Steve it was too much.
But in the back of his mind he’s reminded of the last time they were together. It makes him sick just thinking about it and Steve rushes for the toilet, opening the lid and emptying the contents of his stomach into the bowl beneath him.
“Shh.” Tony quickly shushes him. “Give me a minute with the kid. Go wait over there.”
Steve smiles and glances at the screen, his eyes growing misty at the sight of his son. “Yeah.”
“I hope so. Anyway, don’t let Steve down here. I’ll be fine.”
“I know you’re not to me,” Tony retorts, making sure his mate is brought even closer to his side.
“Daddy?” Peter asks and Tony directs his attention to the little boy. “Is papa coming back? He’s gonna miss the movie!”
Maybe he shouldn’t have missed his training lesson.
But though Steve was anxious about his babies growing up, he wasn’t going to let it ruin the bit of excitement that he had. He couldn’t wait for them to experience new things and enjoy the opportunities that would be opening up for them.
Steve is pushed forward and the hand on his shoulder tightens as Brock steers him out of the room. The little pup still in Steve’s arms whimpers into the dark.
Steve nods and pushes gently, grunting with each push. He keeps his hand near the baby’s head, feeling it push against his palm. His fingers explore the head and the wet hair. There’s so much hair. He can’t help but smile.
“Guess you’re like daddy and enjoy parties, huh?” Steve pokes at his belly, laughing again when Peter pushes back.
Steve tenses and he tries to move his hand away, only for Tony to chase after it and interlace their fingers. “Honey, I want to help you. Talk to me. Please?”
“How did this happen? When did you two meet?”
“Let me take over. All I’ve done today is sit through another boring meeting. Waste of my time, really. I should’ve been here with you.”
Natasha chuckles. “Prove it, Spider-Boy.”
Steve’s eyes fall shut and it’s not long before he’s snoring softly.
“And James?” Steve asks, even though he very well knows his oldest was the most behaved.
“Should I-” Steve makes a gesture toward the door.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sor-”
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Tony says, lowering himself on the bed near Steve’s feet. “Once she’s done then you can go back to sleep.”
Tony tried again to bring Dodger with him while he worked in the lab, but soon gave up when Dodger whined and curled up with Steve on the couch. It didn’t strike them as odd; Dodger was clingy and they assumed he was just wanting to protect Steve and Peter.
“It’s nothing. I…I don’t know. The pups are good.”
Steve nods. Tony rises to his feet and disappears to the bathroom, rummaging through the cabinets until he finds the first aid kit that they kept in case of minor accidents. He returns with the kit and takes his spot beside Steve.
“That’s convincing.”
“Just reading over some files; work stuff.”
“You good?” Tony asks his son, one hand trailing up and down the toddler’s back. Peter responds with a small hiccup. Tony glances up at his mate and they share a look. “Guess it’s starting. The terrible twos are upon us.”
“Okay.” Steve nods and pulls Tony in for another quick kiss. “I love you, too.”
Tony scoffs and shifts in his own seat. He wishes he had chosen a better place to do this. The communal living area was the first choice, but this conversation didn’t require anyone else’s ears. The conference room would have to suffice.
“Please!” Steve turns to begging, though he knows it won’t do any good. “Please, Alpha don’t! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”
“He’s busy too, kiddo. Don’t worry about him. He’ll warm up to you.” Tony wraps his arm around Peter’s shoulders, guiding him out of the foyer and toward the massive living room.
“What if they don’t listen?”
Natasha looks around at the sullen faces of her family. The loss of Steve was great amongst all of them. He was an important piece to their family, the glue that kept them together. He was their leader. Their Captain.
Tony huffs out a laugh. “And risk getting my ass kicked? No thanks.”
It just takes time.
Yikes it's not looking good. Tony is trying so hard and Steve is just...poor thing is a mess. But at least he's one step closer to getting some help and soon he'll be well on his way to feeling like himself again!
The atmosphere in the room shifts, and a heavy, uncomfortable feeling looms over them. Peter finds himself no longer hungry and he sets the plate down on the counter. Tony hasn’t bothered to serve himself anything; his appetite was gone too.
Happy huffs. “So what’s your plan then? Let him stay with you in your penthouse?”
“Nothing! At least, I don’t think I did. Okay, sit down. You’re making me uncomfortable just standing there and silently judging me,” Tony says and he gestures for her to sit down in the chair in front of the desk.
“You let him mark you!” The alpha snarls and he slaps Steve again. His fingers twist painfully into Steve’s hair and he yanks the omega’s head back to expose the mark again. His other hand comes up to trace the indentations on Steve’s neck. “How dare you,” the alpha seethes. “You belong to me!”
Pierce isn’t even trying to hide. He’s standing near a tiny bar, a drink in hand. Steve hates how much this scene reflects the last one he had with the alpha. But this time Steve wouldn’t run away. This time he would plunge the knife inside the alpha’s body.
Steve nods. “I think so too. I’m sorry, Sam.”
Bruce takes both a urine and blood sample, then leaves the room to get the samples he’s collected to the lab.
“Why did you do it? You told me you believed me.”
“Tony, he needs to sleep with us.”
It hasn’t fully sunk in that they were parents. The proof was right in front of them, and yet they still struggled to believe it. Steve especially was having the hardest time.
“What was that for?” Steve asks once they break apart.
“Yeah,” Peter forces a smile and steps further into the room to take his seat at the table. His plate is placed in front of him and he has to fight the urge to vomit.
Tony comes over and lays a hand over Steve’s shoulder. “It’s okay.”
“I didn’t have a choice. If I didn’t comply then he’d hurt me. I couldn’t go back in that room, Tony, I couldn’t. Letting you-I had to. Please understand.”
For weeks Tony had been locking himself away in the tower like some kind of princess in a fairytale. Though he was far from princess material and didn’t require saving -Pepper would disagree- he couldn’t help but make the comparison. He needed some time away from the tower. He needed to breathe in the cool winter air.
“I’m happy.” Steve smiles and rubs Dodger’s head, chuckling when Dodger comes closer to rest his head in his lap.
It’s not the guests that are making Steve feel overwhelmed. The pile of presents waiting for him is what’s throwing him off. He had never seen so many neatly wrapped gifts before. It was obvious that a majority of the boxes and bags were for his son and maybe that was worse. Did Peter really need all of this stuff? How much did a pup require?
Steve takes her over to the rocking chair and carefully lowers himself down. He adjusts her, making sure she’s comfortable before he starts rocking back and forth.
“Get out of there, Steve,” Natasha's voice comes through. “There’s flames where I’m located. This place isn’t going to be standing much longer.”
He sleeps on the couch.
He was at least grateful that he had Laura to give him advice and answer any questions he had. Steve wanted to know anything and everything when it came to having kids. The books he read were nice, but speaking with someone who's experienced parenthood firsthand beat reading a page out of the baby books.
“He would be your omega.”
“I know. You’re good, Tony. I’m just...worried.” Steve places a hand over the spot where his pup’s growing. Tony’s eyes dart down toward the bump for a moment before they’re settling on Steve’s face again.
“He won’t! I swear he won’t,” Peter says, then he mutters under his breath. “He already has.”
It’s not long until the vast living area is decorated with streamers, balloons and a banner. Tony decided to go against the typical gender colors frequently used for such occasions, and instead used red, white and blue as the color theme. It was Independence Day after all.
“Peter’s a year old now. He’s doing good.He took his first step today. I wish you could’ve been there for it. He was so happy and proud of himself.”
“Come on, kid, hurry up.” Tony waves an impatient hand. “I got a meeting in like ten minutes.”
Peter smiles. “Awesome.”
He can’t stay any longer and he gets up from the bed, gathering a pile of clothes he might need from the closet before leaving and shutting the door behind him, vowing to never step foot in there again.
“I gave up a lot more than you did, Tony. I had to carry the baby and give birth and deal with all the judgment. I did! But it was worth it. I’m upset too but it happened and all we can do is be there for him. He needs us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve frowns. “What? Tony, I just said-”
“Was that you?”
“Wait, there’s no proof…” Tony doesn’t finish that thought. He remembers the conversation he had with Pepper and the story of him chasing some random omega at the event Alexander Pierce held. Steve couldn’t be that omega...right? Steve had claimed he didn’t recognize Pierce. None of this made any sense.
A peaceful silence falls between them. Steve watches intently as his newborn son sleeps, completely entranced by his presence. Steve is careful when he touches him, treating Peter like he’s made of glass. He never wants to bring harm to his pup. He’d do better, learn from past mistakes and be the best mother he could possibly be.
“Thank you. I’m okay.”
“Don’t call me that,” Peter says angrily and stomps off toward his bed, plopping down with a huff. “I’m not a baby anymore.”
Tony tries to force the conversation with Steve out of his head. He needs to focus on the mission and coming home. Steve was a distraction that Tony didn’t need right now. But not thinking about Steve was easier said than done. Steve was all he could think about.
“I just feel...I don’t know. Maybe it’s almost time. I know you like to be prepared and this needs to get done anyway. I probably won’t be in medical long and I have no idea what I’m going to need,” Tony says, frowning at the items he’s packed so far. He has an outfit for their son to come home in, a change of clothes for himself, toiletries, and one of his tablets.
Steve groans and moves one arm so that he can wrap it around his middle. “I woke up with cramps.”
He’s greeted with silence.
The team doesn’t know about the letter Steve left or the horrible things he did. Tony lies and tells them it was the failed pregnancies that made Steve snap. They knew he was at his breaking point anyway. Tony would let him take the blame again.
“Okay.”
“I guess so.” Steve is still frowning. He picks up the glass and brings it up to his lips, taking a small sip.
“We tried your way and now we’re using mine,” Tony says and heads toward the living room.
But then he hears Peter’s cries.
“Steve, wait! Don’t!” Tony calls out to him. Steve stops and turns around to face him, eyes bright with tears and flooded with pain.
“Just give five more minutes?”
“I doubt that. Listen, tomorrow I’ll pick you up from school and introduce you to more than just Jarvis.”
He’s too caught up in the movie and his ruined shirt that he doesn’t hear someone come in.
“He’s so beautiful,” Steve whispers.
“Where do we start?” Sam asks, his eyes roaming over the place that not too long ago used to inhabit his best friend.
Natasha just shrugs nonchalantly. “It takes practice. You’re pretty sneaky yourself. Just not like me.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but that same, shy smile appears on his face.
“Safer?” Bruce sighs and removes his glasses. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Tony, what are you not telling me?”
“Good. I gave her a tour and then we went outside to explore the grounds. It was nice.”
Steve huffs. “We didn’t break up. We weren’t even a thing.”
Tony’s assured him more times than he can count that he was more than that. And maybe one day Steve would believe that he was a good omega, mate, mother, friend. To some he was even considered a hero.
“No!” Steve cries out, his outburst startling the baby. The room fills with the sounds of distress the pup makes and Steve tries quickly to get him calm again. His efforts fail and Peter’s piercing cries ring out in the room.
