Moving out of the bunker had been a less complicated process than Castiel had expected.
That had just made Dean blush and Claire roll her eyes before practically shoving them out of the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel had nodded consideringly, “Thank you, Sam. I’m sure that with your help I’ll be able to find stable employment.” He had certainly been correct, Castiel had been hired at the library a few months later and it paid much better than the Gas ‘N Sip.
“You’re telling me,” Dean said, shaking his head.
“He’s being a shit,” Dean said, just as clearly disinterested in sharing as Castiel had expected.
Dean scoffed disbelievingly at that, “Right.”
They got a bit distracted in the hallway when Dean allowed Castiel to back him against the wall and kiss him for a few minutes more. Castiel just couldn’t seem to stop now that it was something he had permission to do.
The translucent figure of a woman wearing a long dress materialized in front of him. He could feel Dean move closer, hovering just behind Castiel’s shoulder.
He could feel Dean’s shrug in the way the blankets shifted, “‘S’okay. We both figured it out in the end.”
Over the first few days after Castiel’s return, Dean had shown Castiel all of the intricacies of caring for an infant. Castiel had done plenty of reading about raising a child before his death, but it turned out that no amount of reading could prepare him for the reality of changing a diaper.
“It!” Jack repeated happily.
More than anything, Dean wanted Jack to have a childhood that he didn’t feel the need to drink about as an adult. But that train of thought wasn’t helping Dean’s nerves at all.
“No. We stick to our actual day jobs these days. We want Jack to have a normal life, you know? We both had shitty dads, but we’re breaking the cycle and all that.”
Leaving the bunker, and Sam and Dean with it, wasn’t something that Castiel had wanted. But he’d known that it was no place to raise a child. Children needed fresh air and sunlight. Space to run. A home that wasn’t littered with arcane, possibly cursed, items and enough weapons to outfit a small army. Jack had been six months old and was beginning to drag himself across the floor. It was only a matter of time until he was mobile enough to start getting into things he shouldn’t. The fact that they still didn’t know the scope of his potential powers had made the prospect feel even more urgent.
It was a fantastic party in the end. The food was fantastic, even Dean admitted that getting catering was the right choice, and everyone talked and danced until the sun had long gone down and the fairy lights they’d strung around the yard were the only thing lighting the yard.
“It was a ghost,” Castiel answered, deciding that the truth would be the best approach. “It’s gone now, though. You won’t be bothered again.”
“Well,” Dean had said, sitting back on his heels after laying out a welcome mat that they’d bought specifically to have a devil’s trap drawn on the underside, “home sweet home, Cas.”
“Sweet dreams,” Castiel said, hoping that he’d have enough grace tonight to make sure of it. Soothing Dean’s nightmares was a years-old habit that it was hard to break.
“I’m an angel of the lord,” Castiel replied. “I have the power to sense spirits who have become trapped. I believe I may be able to help you continue to the other side, if that is what you would like.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright,” Dean said, settling back down across from Castiel to continue whatever he’d been reading on his phone.
When Dean stubbornly remained silent, Castiel sighed and asked, “Why would I lie to you about that? Dean, we live together. We’re raising a child together. We’ve fought beside each other and sacrificed for each other. I rebelled against heaven because you asked me to. I asked you to marry me. There is nothing you could ask of me that I’d deny you.”
Leah's voice was quiet when she looked at Cas and asked, “When you said that you also had bad father, does that mean…” and trailed off, seemingly unable to figure out how to word her question.
As soon as Dean helped Jack out of his boots and coat, Jack took off toward the master bedroom as fast as his little legs could carry him. And Dean, still trying to remove his own boots, couldn’t catch him before he was scrambling onto the bed.
Sam had sighed wearily, “Was it anything in particular tonight?”
Eventually, though, they did make it to Dean’s room and his large king-sized bed.
After the short wedding ceremony, the reception quickly reached full swing, becoming raucous despite the small guest list. Castiel wasn’t used to being the center of attention and soon found himself not hiding but taking a break on the raised deck behind the house where he could watch the party without having to participate.
“Jesus Christ,” Abby muttered. “Wait, no, I don’t actually want to hear whatever you have to say about him. I was raised Catholic, I need to keep some mental boundaries here.
Sam had looked at him, a deep disappointment clear on his face, “I really thought you knew him better than that, Cas.”
Pulling out a chair across from Castiel’s, Sam had asked, “Can I help?”
“How did you even get into this kind of stuff?” Abby asked. Castiel decided to let Dean do the talking as he could feel the room starting to spin.
During his first week, he’d brought photos in to decorate his desk, something that appeared to be customary in the staff office. He’d chosen a photo of himself and Claire, a group photo from the last time Sam and Eileen had visited, and right in the middle was a photo of Dean holding Jack.
“I’d appreciate that, Dean,” Castiel had said. And he’d found himself wondering about Dean’s changed behavior.
After putting his breakfast dishes in the dishwasher, Dean stopped next to Jack and leaned down to kiss his strawberry-covered cheek. “You be good, kid,” he said seriously. Jack responded by giggling and trying to grab at Dean’s shirt with his sticky-looking hands. Dean dodged him easily.
“Cas,” Dean had said, voice rough as he’d pulled Castiel into a hug. Castiel had been able to feel tears pricking at the edges of his eyes as the relief of having Dean here, solid and real, had coursed through him.
“Mm,” Castiel confirmed, feeling grateful as Dean handed him a steaming mug of coffee. “Thank you, Dean,” he said before taking his first sip. Dean gave him a soft, warm smile.
“It happens to us a lot,” Dean said, tilting his head like
“God’s also a dick, yeah,” Dean answered.
“Oh,” Castiel hadn’t exactly thought that far ahead, “that’s a good idea then.”
“Of course I support that, Cas. It’s just-” He’d looked at Castiel with a pained expression, “Dean was really messed up when you died. I mean he’s messed up every time you’re dead, but this time… I don’t know what would have happened if he didn’t have Jack. He kind of hyper focused on taking care of him. He loves Jack so much. It’s going to be… hard,” Sam had grimaced, obviously understating his expectation of Dean’s reaction, “for him to lose both of you.”
“Tank-dee,” Jack said with a happy wave.
“I told him I wanted to find a real home to raise Jack in.”
Dean thought about how his own father would have reacted if he’d ever picked his sons up and found them with painted toenails. It was one of his main parenting strategies, to imagine what John would do and do the exact opposite. WWJD (what wouldn’t John do).
“And you guys hunted them?”
“You… what,” Sam had said, a look of pure confusion on his face.
Castiel thought about it for a moment, “No thank you, I don’t think I’m hungry yet.” He still wasn’t the best at reading his human needs when they arose, but Castiel often found that he didn’t want to eat first thing in the morning.
“How do you forget a detail like that?” Abby asked, disbelief coloring her tone.
“So,” Dean asked loudly enough that his voice carried across the kitchen, “should Cas and I start looking around now, or should we wait until after lunch?”
Once everyone had left and an exhausted Jack was tucked away in bed, they made their way to Dean’s room. Which was now also Castiel’s room, though the thrill of being welcomed into Dean’s bed every night hadn’t faded yet and Castiel wondered if it ever would.
They exchanged greetings as Abby and Leah slid into the booth opposite them, Dean felt a small sense of relief when they looked like they were also nervous rather than angry.
To the average person their home looked perfectly normal, but they had put plenty of precautions in place to prevent any kind of supernatural interference. In the end, Castiel had found himself glad that they hadn’t yet had any furniture to worry about as they’d warded the house as much as they possibly could.
“Tell me,” he said softly, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
After an hour or two he reaches a clearing. To his right emerges a crystal blue lake, glimmering in the afternoon sun. It stretches so far and wide that he can’t see the end of it.
His phone buzzes within seconds. It feels more real now; the world is still turning, he has to keep going without Cas. About five minutes later he has steadied his breaths and he manages to stand up.
He pulls out of the dirt driveway and onto the main road. He doesn’t have a destination in mind, so he lets the music carry him away. He drives through a tunnel of tall trees where only small specks of sunlight peek through the cracks in the branches. They dance like sparks on the car’s windshield. Dean taps his fingers on the steering wheel in time to the music and hums softly.
Then Sam came back and everything changed. Once again, the world needed saving and it was up to Dean to save it. The apple pie life just wasn’t in the cards for him. But it was more than that. As much as he wanted to think of Lisa and Ben as family, he knew deep down that he’d already found his family elsewhere.
“Look at me,” Dean begs, “look at me”.
“You knew?” He asks, his chest aching a little.
Bobby continues “he busted my ass out, and then well, he set some things right. He tore down all the walls in here. Heaven ain’t just re-living your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been. Everyone happy, everyone together.”
Dean raises his eyebrows.
Apparently you can’t dream in this new heaven, because not a second after Dean closes his eyes he’s opening them again. He’s still slouched in the chair, but he feels surprisingly refreshed and not at all how he normally feels after a night of heavy drinking.
“Couldn’t or didn’t want to?” Dean asks, his voice strained.
As he sits down the song changes to
“What, what implies?” Sam wracked his brain to figure out what his brother was talking about but he couldn’t recall what conversation Dean was referencing.
he thinks.
"You don't even know what it implies."
He’s close to climaxing but he doesn’t want to yet. He can take more. With some effort he manages to relax enough to pull the plug out. He gasps at the sudden lack of stimulation and reaches desperately for the largest plug. When he sees it up close he swallows hard; this one is quite a bit thicker than the last. With a deep breath he begins pushing it inside.
He takes a final breath and his body goes limp against Sam’s. A familiar stillness takes hold of him; a stillness he’s only felt in the veil. Except this time there is no reaper to greet him. Instead he’s enveloped by warmth, his mind flooded with light.
“Dean I–”
He sits up with a start, getting a better look. In the middle of the table he sees his brother’s initials carved next to his own, and his mom’s initials underneath. But he doesn’t see Castiel or Jack’s names.
“Yes,” Castiel said, “they are.”
“I’ll think about it,” Castiel promised.
Castiel turned and saw Abby and Leah standing at the base of the stairs, staring at the spot where the ghost had vanished and clutching each others hands.
“Of course he did, Cas,” Sam had said with a bit of a scoff. “What, did you think he’d just hand Jack off after you’d died for him? As far as Dean’s concerned Jack is your family which makes him our family. There was never another choice than to raise him as well as we could in your absence.”
Jody had helped them find the house. It was a simple two-story, three bedroom home. The previous owners had taken good care of it and kept it updated with modern appliances and fixtures while still keeping a cozy feel. The biggest selling point, though, was the large fenced-in backyard and the amount of surrounding land they would own. There was plenty of space for Jack to run and play. Space for Castiel to cultivate a garden and hopefully keep some bees. It was everything that Castiel had imagined when he’d dreamed of finding a home.
“They’re very pretty,” Dean agreed, giving his father’s memory the finger. “I think your Papa will really like them, you’ll have to show him when we get home.”
Abby was in the middle of pointing out the fuse box when Leah called from upstairs asking for a hand with setting the table.
The first thing he’d done, of course, was call Dean. What else was there to do? Within a matter of hours Castiel had heard the familiar purr of the Impala and suddenly Dean had been walking toward where he was still lingering outside the phone booth, afraid to stray too far in case he somehow missed Dean’s arrival.
At some point Sam gave a speech that made everyone cry, especially himself. And Jack had charmed everyone in attendance with his enthusiastic dance moves.
“Sounds like a shifter, twenty miles outside of Dallas. Shower and get packed, it’s already killed three people.”
“He didn’t mention that,” Castiel said, but he wasn’t surprised. Dean didn’t often seem to realize when he went above and beyond in helping people. “And he’s not my husband… yet.”
Jody laughed, “Literally any drug store. It’s only a couple dollars a bottle if you’re not getting the nice stuff, and trust me you don’t need the nice stuff to paint a toddler’s toes.”
“Huh?” Dean immediately looked up from his phone, brow furrowed. “No. Why would I?”
“I can’t seem to talk to Dean without somehow upsetting him,” Castiel had admitted. He’d felt lost, adrift at sea when all he’d desperately wanted was to be back on solid land with Dean again.
“I believe he’s recharging my grace,” Castiel said as Jack’s chubby little hands continued to pet his face. “Like a battery.”
“Cas, you’re not trying to ask me to leave, are you?” Dean was sitting up perfectly straight, expression full of concern
“Good call,” Dean said as he wrinkled his nose at the thought of how Jack’s hands were somehow constantly slimy. “We’re probably going to have to buy some if he’s this excited about it.”
“Health insurance?” Sam asked, a frown forming on his face.
“We actually moved into a new place pretty recently,” Leah said. “It’s this lovely old farmhouse, a little rundown but we’ve been doing a lot of weekend projects to get it back in shape.”
“Bye bye!” Jack said, waving from his perch on Cas’ lap.
“I’m glad to be back,” Castiel had replied honestly. “Can I ask, though, why Dean stopped drinking?”
Dean had nodded, “You got any idea where you wanna go?”
As soon as the spring weather rolled in, they chose a weekend and decorated the backyard for the occasion.
Dean slouched back against the couch, “Yeah, I know. I’m sorry."
“Thank you,” she said, “thank you.”
“I would be honored to be your husband,” Castiel said and he and Dean smiled shyly at each other until Jack took advantage of their distraction to grab for the bottle of maple syrup sitting open on the table, dumping it all over himself.
He’d been in the middle of figuring out how to work the coffee maker since Dean had always had it running before him. When Dean had cleared his throat from the doorway, it had caused Castiel to startle, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been touching that.”
As they got ready for bed, he and Dean didn’t speak. They’d already said everything they needed to. Instead they went through their nightly routine in comfortable silence, occasionally stopping to share a kiss when they crossed paths, though they were both in agreement that they were too tired from the day’s festivities to do anything more than kissing.
Castiel had found Dean alone in the kitchen one evening, taking inventory of the food they had left before shopping the next day and he’d decided it was probably as good of a time as any to broach the topic.
He does, and now it’s Dean’s turn to stare. He’s seen Cas’ vessel before but never like this, never close enough to reach out and touch. Cas’ cock is already getting hard and Dean makes it his mission to get him all the way up. He strokes his lover’s cock until the angel is quivering and thrusting his hips into Dean’s fist. He looks like he’s never been touched this way before, and Dean realizes he probably hasn’t.
She looks to John and then back at Dean.
It’s probably the most romantic thing he's ever said to Cas and he means every word.
Dean supposes he should pop inside Harvelle’s and check out his new home or say hello to his parents, but instead he feels a tugging sensation in his chest, like he needs to get away from it all. He looks up to find the Impala is parked in the gravel driveway. Has she been there the whole time they were talking or did she just appear?
Bobby had said a lot of things. He said that Rufus was in heaven with Oretha, and his parents had made it as well–which Dean had mixed feelings about. He knows he’ll want to see them eventually but his relationship with John and Mary is so complicated. A younger version of himself would have longed to be able to see his parents and soak in that feeling of family, but he has a new family now.
But in his heart he knows why. Cas’ first priority had always been to protect Dean. He’d probably worked it all out weeks ago, and was just waiting for the right moment to use the deal to their advantage. That’s just how Cas was, always keeping secrets to protect them despite Dean telling him time after time that family doesn’t keep secrets. Part of him wants to be angry, but figures he should be used to this by now.
“I know.”
“Castiel” he barks.
His heart races. He kicks off his shoes and lifts up the blanket to climb in next to her. She turns her body toward him instinctively, pressing her head against his chest. Dean wraps his arms around her small frame. Her hair smells like rose petals and fresh laundry; he had forgotten how much he missed that smell. He’s so taken up by the feeling of having her close that it takes him a minute to actually wrap his head around it.
“I thought you’d have breakfast ready by the time I got downstairs,” John shoots her an annoyed glance as he makes his way across the room. It makes Dean’s blood boil to hear his dad talk to his mom that way. He’d been so overwhelmed with joy at seeing his childhood home that he’d forgotten how they used to fight.
Cas’ cheeks are bright red and Dean’s eyes feel wet with tears. He leans forward until their noses are brushed up against each other, savoring the wide-eyed look on Cas’ face before closing his eyes and pressing their lips together.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you how I felt sooner. I thought you already knew and you didn’t reciprocate, and then you told me you loved me and you were gone so fast, I didn’t have the time to react.”
“What the hell was that, man?” Sam raised his eyebrows at his brother, prompting him to speak, but Dean shrugged off the question and began walking toward the kitchen again.
Back then he’d thought he had Sam convinced he was straight. Little did he know Sam was privy to what was going on between Dean and Cas even before Dean understood it himself.
“Well?” Sam asked.
“Hello Sam” Cas chirped.
He pours the contents out on the bed and just stares at it for a moment. Part of him still can’t believe he actually bought this stuff. Lying on the bed are three silver butt plugs, increasing in size from left to right.
Taking a deep breath and one last paranoid glance around the room, Dean pulls his jeans and underwear off and hops up on the bed. He grabs a bottle of lube out from the bedside cabinet and squirts some into his hand. With two fingers he rubs it into his hole. He snatches up the smallest of the plugs and sizes it up for a moment before lining it up against his ass. Here goes nothing.
Dean shakes his head. “It’s almost perfect,” he mutters.
“Yep.”
“Hey man, is that Cas?”
He lies on his back, spreading his legs as much as possible and tries to imagine Cas kneeling above him. The thought sends shivers down his body. He needs to feel him inside again. Lifting his hips he pushes the plug all the way inside. For a moment his vision goes white and this time he growls out in pain, but once it’s in it feels glorious.
She turns around, a big smile spreading across her face.
Something stirs inside of him. For the first time he realizes that the poison he’s been carrying with him, the self loathing, the shame–is not his own. It belongs to his father.
“Dean?” His eyes go wide. “What are you doing here?”
Dean kept staring at the floor so Sam softened his tone.
Dean’s face brightened.
That word she used.
“I know, I know. You just–you don’t know how hard it is just to say it.” He let out a relieved little laugh.
Dean can’t believe his ears. Heaven has been completely reworked since the last time he was here, and what’s even more remarkable is that Jack is responsible.
He’s not lying; the flavor itself brings back a happy memory of him and John sitting on a porch, not unlike this one, sharing one of those rare moments where there were no monsters to kill, no people to save. But the thought also triggers something unpleasant within him. His chest aches thinking about just how rare those happy occasions were.
, he thinks. Mary had never been able to put him or Sam as a first priority so he’s not surprised that this is her response. It still causes him pain but he doesn't let it stop him.
, Sam thought to himself, but he didn't want to hold up dinner any longer so he let it go.
One night a few weeks ago, Dean had poured out some scotch and he, Cas, and Sam sat around the dining table drinking and talking. After about an hour Sam went to bed, leaving Dean and Cas to finish off the bottle. The liquor had a much stronger effect on the hunter than it did on the angel, and by the third glass Dean was starting to open up again, leaning into his best friend a little too much.
Dean pivoted and walked back to the kitchen.
“I missed you, Piglet” she takes a sip of her coffee.
Dean’s heart drops. He should have known his dad wouldn’t understand. Who knows what he would do if he knew what Dean was leaving out.
Dean and Sam hobbled down the bunker stairs, muscles sore from a full day of hunting. The recliners in the Dean cave beckoned to them; as soon as they'd set their bags down they both made a beeline for them. Sam ended up beating Dean to the more comfortable seat with the fullest cushion.
He thinks back to the last fight he had with Cas, to the look on his best friend’s face when he said, “I’m dead to you”, and Dean hadn’t told him he was wrong, hadn’t stopped him from walking out the bunker door. It’s one of the biggest regrets of his life and he cringes just thinking about it.
He was going to tell him right then, that he couldn’t possibly stay angry because Cas meant everything to him, but Cas cut him off. Did Cas know what he was going to say? Was he just postponing the conversation as long as possible so that the empty wouldn’t come until the right moment?
“I was,” Bobby says “and now I’m not.”
He doesn’t finish the sentence and he doesn’t need to. Dean and Sam have been here before–too many times, but this time is different. They’ve agreed there will be no more demon deals, no more revivals from Chuck. Dean is going to die for good this time, and whatever that entails, Sam is going to have to go on without him.
"I've told you so many times" he said, "you gotta stop calling yourself that."
floods the car speakers. He shakes his head and laughs. Why would he ever put this song on a mixtape for someone who was ‘just a friend’?
“Cas, I know you’re out there. Bobby–he told me you built this place with Jack.”
“What do you mean you weren’t fighting?” He asked, furrowing his brow.
“You can go now,” Sam finishes.
That year when he thought Sam was locked in the cage he’d spent every night just like this one, cuddled up under the covers with Lisa. They’d gotten into their own little rhythm of Dean coming to bed late and Lisa waking up early for work, and savoring the time in between. Back then it had felt like everything he could ever want: a nice neighborhood with a beautiful wife and a kid who wouldn’t have to grow up to be a hunter.
Dean walks hurriedly around the bunker, sticking his head in every room to double check nobody’s home. He’d heard Sam say he was going out to lunch with Eileen and he’s fairly sure Cas is out too, but considering what he’s about to do he has to make sure. Feeling confident that he’s alone, he goes into the Dean Cave and locks the door behind him.
Dean’s breathing is shallow. He doesn’t know how much time he has left, but he knows it won’t be long. He needs to get his brother’s blessing. The pain is excruciating, but he steadies his gaze on Sam’s face, forcing himself to look him in the eyes as he makes one final request.
Cas nods slowly. He seems to be incapable of producing speech all of a sudden.
“Dean”
“It’s really you!” Dean smiles and pulls the angel into a tight hug. Somehow Cas is back and he needs to hold him close so he can’t leave ever again. Cas’ body tenses up at the embrace and then relaxes. He wraps his arms around Dean’s waist and rests his head on the hunter’s shoulder.
Dean is taken aback by John’s shift in tone. It reminds him of his own rage when he’d heard about what Jack did to Mary and it makes him feel ashamed. In some ways he was just like his father, always quick to anger. It’s the part of himself that he hates the most.
He’s said it now. It’s all out in the open. If Cas is listening then he knows the truth. Dean thought he would feel relieved to finally get it off his chest but instead he finds he can hardly breath. It’s too late. He’s finally said it and it’s too late, he’s certain of it.
Abby and Leah both stared at him, faces blank.
It was that memory that had led Castiel to carefully say, “Dean, if you wanted to, you could live with Jack and I.”
“You know, I always thought this was something I’d never get to have,” Dean admitted as they watched their guests mingle and dance from their place on the deck. “I always thought that having a family would mean giving up hunting completely and I knew I could never totally cut off that part of my life. But I never imagined this.”
Dean had laughed so hard he’d doubled over while Castiel meticulously cleaned Jack off. Dean’s laughter made Jack laugh too, which in turn made it even more difficult for Castiel.
Dean huffed a laugh, “No, we’re not in hell right now. And uh,” he glanced over at Cas who nodded slightly at him, “Cas saved me.”
Not drinking at a place like this was still weird. Dean felt antsy sitting in their booth with the chatter from other tables and the Top-20 music from the pub's sound system washing over him. Normally he’d curb that feeling with a beer or five, but he hadn’t touched a drop since bringing Jack home and he wasn’t about to start now. Too many of his worst childhood memories were tinged with the scent of stale beer or liquor and Dean refused to be the cause of any similar memories for Jack. He wanted Jack’s memories to be full of warmth, of movie nights and baking. Gardening and lovingly knitted hats. Having both of his parents show up for games, or plays, or recitals.
The rest of the day continued at a slow pace, both Jack and Castiel seemingly affected by the chilly gray weather outside. Castiel heated up a can of chicken noodle soup for lunch and after, when he and Jack cuddled on the couch to watch a show together, they both fell asleep.
Every night since he’d been back, he would stop in Jack’s room before he went to bed. Jack seemed to be a good sleeper for a baby, though Dean and Sam had told stories of how he’d kept them up for weeks screaming all night when he’d been a newborn.
“My dad was a hunter, raised my brother and I in the life,” Dean said. “Cas had a… similar experience. We actually met on the job. He pulled me out of a rough spot a decade or so ago and we started working together.”
“I can help you fake a resume,” Sam had offered. “And maybe figure out how to falsify college records. I know Dean will be able to get a job pretty easily without that since he’s handy, but you’re probably looking at more office-type work and you usually need a degree for that.”
“Yeah, Cas has way better insurance than I do,” Dean’s tone was easy but Castiel could see the tension in his shoulders. “So if we get married he can add me to his plan.”
And if Dean fell asleep on his shoulder more often than not while they sat next to each other in the dark, that was just another reason to love movie night.
“I’m not sure what gave you the idea that I would only want to be with a woman, or that I view our life together as abnormal,” Castiel replied, still feeling lost. He could understand where Dean had drawn assumptions as he thought back to Meg, April, Nora, Daphne, but none of those encounters had actually meant anything to him. Not the way Dean did, though Dean didn’t know that and Castiel had expressly avoided saying or doing anything that would lead to him finding out.
Dean cut in quickly, “We just figured it’d make sense. With Jack, you know, and health insurance.”
“Okay,” Dean had said, “I’m in.”
“Do you ever miss hunting?” Castiel wondered aloud.
“It was your life for so long,” Castiel replied. “I would understand if you missed it.”
“Consider the pie a done deal,” Abby said, before turning her attention to the cart of returns that thy needed to organize.
The basement was unremarkable. A packers dirt floor with brick walls and only a single lightbulb that flickered overhead.
“Ugh,” Dean groaned, interrupting. “Why does everyone always ask about the fucking racist ghost truck?”
Castiel had been able to tell that Dean was proud of his younger brother and that he’d at some point realized that it was finally time for the two to lead their own separate lives.
“Maybe we should get married,” Castiel said without thinking. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he froze.
“Fucking finally,” Sam had muttered, taking his plate with him as he’d left the room.
The pale blue light, low murmur of the television, and Dean snoring on the couch greeted Castiel  when he arrived home. A fond smile curled at Castiel’s lips as he took in the sight of Dean looking so relaxed in a way that Castiel rarely used to see. Dean often insisted on waiting for him to get home before going to bed, claiming he really only needed four hours of sleep per night despite all evidence to the contrary, and Castiel had stopped fighting him on it. It was, admittedly, nice to come home to Dean rather than an empty living room.
“Well that could’ve gone worse I guess,” Dean said as he helped Castiel into the car.
“Fuck,” Dean said hoarsely as Castiel broke away to kiss down the column of his neck. His hands clutched desperately at Castiel’s waist. Castiel could feel that Dean was already hard as their hips ground together.
partners in every way that mattered except romantically. They lived together, had fought battles alongside each other, and they were co-parenting a child. It was also just the most straightforward explanation he could hope for.
“How was your day?” Castiel asked as Dean headed toward the coat closet.
“What’s he doing?” Dean asked, sounding worried again.
All of Castiel’s carefully planted tulip bulbs were now sprouting out of the soil, creating a riot of color in the flower beds surrounding the deck. He hadn’t yet had a chance to begin planting a full garden, choosing to hold off until they weren’t trying to fit a rented dance floor in the yard.
Their very late lunch extended well into the evening when they sat around catching up with Claire and Kaia for hours. It led to Castiel having to put a cranky, overstimulated Jack to bed early before collapsing back onto the couch next to Dean.
“I never meant for this to become his responsibility,” Castiel had said with a sigh, “he didn’t have to do any of this.”
“Abby,” Leah scolded, nudging Abby with her elbow.
“You’re such a fucking child,” Castiel could hear Sam say on the other end of the line. He sounded more tired than angry.
“Oh yes, we went outside for a whole ten minutes to do bubbles, built and knocked over several block towers, and fell asleep during a Sesame Street rerun. It was wild,” Castiel said, which made Dean laugh.
After a long moment, Dean had pulled away. Clapping Castiel on the back he’d said, “It’s good to have you back,” and walked across the hall to his own room, leaving Castiel alone in the hallway, still reeling. His mind had raced with a chorus of
It probably had been.
“Honestly, it’s shocking that you two have managed suburbia this long without any major supernatural incidents,” Claire said with a snicker.
“‘M fine,” Castiel argued, feeling woozy as he tried to focus again.
“Okay,” Dean said, still sounding worried.
“Yeah, no problem,” Dean had replied, hovering by the door, watching Castiel gently place a sleeping Jack in the crib.
Castiel had blinked, he hadn’t expected Dean to make a decision so quickly, “You can take time to think about it. The offer will stay open.”
It had snowed overnight and the chill in the air lingered even into the late afternoon, causing slippery spots on the sidewalks as Castiel hurried across campus to the library. He still wasn’t used to being able to feel the cold so acutely and he found the stinging sensation of the air against his face incredibly unpleasant. If he’d known what winters would feel like with his failing grace, he might have insisted on moving further south.
Claire and Kaia were staying with Jody the weekend of the luncheon-slash-ghost hunt at Abby and Leah’s and they were more than happy to babysit Jack. Claire especially had bonded with Jack over the past year and she rarely missed an opportunity to spend time with him.
“Sam’s going to be insufferable about this, though.” Dean took a pensive sip of the coffee he’d brought out with him, “We could just never tell him.”
“Yeah, it just took a lot of energy out of him to take care of the ghost,” Dean said, though Castiel knew him too well to buy the casual tone he was putting on. “I’ll drag him home to sleep it off.”
“Sweet dreams Dean. I love you,” He said as he did every night before pressing a soft kiss to the back of Dean’s neck.
Castiel had spent another few minutes watching Jack sleep peacefully before returning to his own bedroom.
“Of course,” Castiel had replied, as sure of this offer as he’d ever been about anything.
“Oh,” Castiel hadn’t realized that and it pleased him to hear. “I’m sorry for assuming.”
As he tried to get up and walk away, Dean suddenly grabbed his shoulder.
“Good,” Castiel replied. “Now we should probably get to sleep given Jack’s habit of waking up before dawn.”
“Yes, that’s correct,” Castiel answered. “Dean is a mechanic.”
Sam had given him a look like Castiel was missing something obvious, “He did it so he could take care of Jack. He’s been really serious about doing everything right for him.”
“Want some breakfast?” Dean offered, glancing at his phone to check the time, “I’ve got enough time to throw together some eggs and toast before I leave.”
“Sorry, I just- I know I don’t have too much more time to spend with him and I,” Dean’s voice had cracked and he’d coughed once before forcing his face into a casual grin, “I’ll miss the little guy, you know. I’ll-” his grin had fallen as quickly as he’d plastered it on, “I’ll be able to visit him, though, right?”
“‘M so tired,” Cas said, his voice even more gravelly than usual.
Abby’s excitement drew glares from several nearby students. “Sorry, sorry,” she whispered, smiling appeasingly at them before turning her attention back to Castiel. “Congrats, seriously that’s so exciting. When did this happen?”
Dean had pulled Jack closer to him seemingly on reflex, “I guess he’ll have to get used to that.” Dean’s tone had been gravelly, like the words were painful to say and Sam had stopped glaring at his sandwich to glare at Castiel instead.
“What?” Dean said as he answered it, visibly agitated.
“Other things?” Leah asked quietly.
Dean had stared at him as though Castiel had reached over and slapped him, then he’d shaken himself out of it, “Yeah, uh, okay. I get it.”
Dean had acquiesced, allowing Castiel to hand Jack over. Dean had held Jack close for a long moment before kissing the top of his head, placing him back in Castiel’s arms, and walking out of the room.
“We don’t have to get married if you don’t want to,” Castiel said softly. “I don’t want you to feel trapped in something you agreed to in haste.”
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel said, slipping his fingers through Dean’s, “I’m sorry I never realized…”
They said their goodbyes and once Dean and Cas were back in the Impala Cas said, “That was… not what I was expecting.”
“Good,” Dean said with a nod before pushing his chair back from the table. “Now that we’ve cleared that up, I’ve gotta head out.”
When Dean walked into Jody’s house to pick Jack up, he was bouncing off the walls with excitement to show off his newly painted toenails.
“Your house is so nice, I seriously love all of the plants,” Abby said after Castiel had shown her and Leah around and they were sitting down to eat.
Dean rolled his eyes fondly and patted what he thought was Cas’ shoulder before heading to the bathroom to take a quick shower before leaving.
He’d looked so completely miserable that Castiel had tried to cheer him up by saying, “I’m sure you’re looking forward to getting back to your normal lifestyle. I appreciate how much you’ve already given up to take care of Jack more than I can say, but I know that you’re a hunter, not a parent.”
Abby kept going, not seeming to notice how still Dean and Cas suddenly were, “I stopped reading them when one of the main characters was sent to hell and it had a really long hiatus, but now after talking to you guys I kinda want to dig them up again and see how it ends.”
“Yeah, I want that too Cas. I really do,” Dean said as he snuggled somehow closer.
It is my goal to also write out the second "bonus scene" I mentioned with the Supernatural books, but this one was completed first! I make no promises because honestly my brain is so finicky when it comes to writing and I have some heavy work weeks coming up, but I really do hope to write that full scene someday. Soon, with any luck!
“Of course,” Dean said with one of his most charming smiles, “name a day and we’ll be there.”
Castiel had had enough grace left then that he didn’t technically need to sleep most nights, but he’d found he enjoyed the process of allowing himself to take a break from his own thoughts for a few hours each night. It had also surprised him how lonely the bunker could feel when all of its other occupants were asleep. He’d spent centuries alone before, but it was much easier to do when there was no one he cared to spend time with. The echoing halls of the bunker had served only as a reminder that he had managed to mess up his relationship with both Dean and Sam in one night.
Castiel tried to think on his feet to find reasons that wouldn’t give away his true feelings, “It would make a lot of things easier.” He paused thoughtfully, finding a path forward, “I have much better benefits than you do and it wouldn’t cost any extra to add you to the family plan with Jack and I. Filing taxes would be easier now that we’re being upright citizens. It would help when Jack is enrolled in school, eventually. It seems like a very practical option.”
“Is he okay?” Abby asked, sounding concerned.
“It wasn’t… bad, though,” Cas’ tone was thoughtful as he tried to make sense of how the conversation had gone.
Coming back from the dead yet again had been… jarring. Even more so than usual thanks to the circumstances surrounding his death and Jack’s birth. Despite his track record, Castiel hadn’t been expecting to be brought back to life again.
To the spirit he said, “You can show yourself. We’re here to help you.”
“You know,” Dean said, as though he was making any sense, “if things were normal and you weren’t a former angel who ended up with a magical kid and a washed up ex-hunter, is that something you’d’ve wanted?”
A feeling of contentment settled over Castiel as he drank his coffee slowly, listening to the music Dean had playing quietly in the background and Jack’s happy sounds as he ate his breakfast of almond butter toast with sliced strawberries. It had surprised Castiel at first how easily Dean had shifted to preparing healthier food without complaint after so many years of constantly mocking Sam’s diet choices.
The next morning, Dean turned off his alarm with a groan and stretched his sore limbs, joints cracking. Despite the layer of fatigue, he also felt satisfied on a bone deep level. The night before had just been further proof that he and Cas clicked on a level that he hadn’t felt with anyone ever before. They just worked together well on every possible level.
“I’d like that,” Castiel muttered as Dean hauled him off the couch.
Castiel narrowed his eyes as he looked over at Dean, “I feel obligated to point out that I could ask you the same question, especially since you have even more of a history of seeking out relationships with women.”
“Good,” Dean said, clapping Castiel on the shoulder as he stood up. “I’m gonna head to bed. See you in the morning.”
Forging the documents necessary to purchase the house had been complicated considering their circumstances. In the end, Jody had just bought the house herself and the official paper trail had them renting from her in the hopes of buying it one day.
“We’ve gotta go pick up Jack,” Dean said, running his hand up and down Cas’ blanket covered spine.
“Love you too,” Dean replied, and hearing that, loving Dean and being loved in return, was what made Castiel realize that this was truly the happiest he’d ever felt.
“It was good,” Dean said as he hung up his coat. “Fred had me work on restoring this sweet old Mustang that belongs to a collector for most of the shift.”
“I’m sorry I missed all of that,” Castiel had said, feeling a deep sense of grief at everything he had missed.
Castiel’s answering chuckle caused Jack to stir, “Da!” He said happily, elbowing Castiel’s chin as he turned to reach for Dean.
“Maybe we could have this conversation sitting down?” Castiel asked, leaning more heavily against Dean as he began to feel faint.
Because I can't get it out of my head, I've decided to add one of the "bonus scenes" I mentioned in the original end notes!
Kaia laughed too as she brought Jack into the room, “I take it lunch went well.”
It had been a quiet concern of his that Dean might change his mind when confronted with the reality of moving away from Sam. That fear never came to pass, though. There were several times when Castiel had come across the brothers having a hushed, serious discussion, but those discussions had never led to Dean backing out of his promise.
Dean mumbled something under his breath and turned his face further into the throw pillow.
“Shut up,” Dean pushed at Castiel’s shoulder. “Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, I think it’s time for movie night. What do you say Jack? Movie?”
Jack preened under the attention, enough that he didn’t even put up a fight as Dean started getting him into his outerwear.
Cas grunted at him and pulled the duvet the rest of the way over his head.
“Well, I think this is a good place to leave things. I think I’ve had enough perception-altering revelations for one night,” Abby said. Her tone was joking, but she looked tired.
“That was rude,” Castiel said, raising his eyebrows at Dean’s sudden haste to end the call.
“It really is great,” Abby said, “Leah’s convinced it’s haunted though.” She nudged Leah’s arm with a playful smirk.
“Apparently so. I already feel much stronger,” Castiel replied, wrapping an arm around Jack so that he could pull them into a sitting position.
Castiel had frowned, “It truly is a miracle that the human species continues to propagate.” He had frowned even harder as he’d carefully replaced the diaper, following Dean’s exact instructions. At first he’d wondered if Dean was playing a prank when he’d told Castiel the steps to take to avoid being peed on, but now he wasn’t taking any chances.
Dean’s ears turned red, “I get it. I don’t mind, Cas.”
With a sigh, Castiel had turned his attention back to his own food and thought about the things that he’d known were true. First, he was in love with Dean, had loved him for years. Second, Dean didn’t return his feelings. Dean couldn’t return his feelings. Castiel knew that Dean loved him, of course, but Dean loved him like a brother, like family. Third, Dean treated hunting as a calling. He’d told Castiel before that he knew he’d die on a hunt someday as though that was his destiny. Hunting wasn’t something Dean would readily give up.
“Yes, that’s Jack,” Castiel had answered.
“We will be,” Castiel responded with a smile. As soon as she was gone, Castiel slowly walked the perimeter of the basement until he found a spot where the energy he could sense felt strongest.
Once their toddler was “de-stickyfied”, Dean’s term, they brought him out to the backyard to run around while they rested on the porch, enjoying the day off. It was still very much winter, but the weather was actually above freezing for the first time all week and it was nice to get some fresh air.
“You really wouldn’t mind if I lived with you guys?”
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Dean asked quietly.
Dean nodded, feeling mild hesitation.
“I think I may go lie down for a while,” Castiel had said, voice low. “I’m still feeling a bit tired, my grace isn’t back to full power.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, considering picking up a few colors the next time he had to run errands. “And thanks again for watching him. I hope he behaved himself.”
“No way, no fucking way,” Abby said. “Those books… that can’t all be real.”
Castiel could feel the warmth of Jack’s grace recharging his own.
“And his coworker and her girlfriend saw it happen so they’re super freaked out. It was really just a banner lunch.”
“You’re lucky that he can’t pronounce his sibilants yet,” Castiel said evenly, giving Dean the out.
“Marriage,” Dean said, “let’s do it. We’re already a family, you, me, and Jack. It’s not like I’m planning on ditching you guys someday to settle down with someone else. I’m settled here and getting to be with the two of you like this is already more than I deserve. It’s something I never thought I’d get to have and there’s no one I’d rather have it with.” Dean’s eyes looked suspiciously wet as he finished speaking and Castiel could feel himself tearing up as well.
“Dude, thank you so much for giving me your husband’s number.” Abby said on Monday morning. “Did he tell you he didn’t even charge Leah since it was such a simple fix? It was just a loose part, he even showed her how to fix it herself if it happens again.” Abby’s happiness was obvious even in the hushed tone she used when they were covering the circulation desk.
“There’s a plate of food in the fridge for you to heat up if you’re in an eating mood tonight,” Dean said, rubbing at his eyes. The move was far more endearing than it had any reason to be. “Meatloaf and mashed potatoes with green beans. Jack had a lot of fun with the potatoes, but he wasn’t thrilled when I had to wash them out of his hair at bath time.”
“Mom?”
feel angry and broken, have ever since I was a kid. I feel like there’s a poison inside of me and everyone who gets too close gets hurt–or worse.”
Dean’s eyebrows perk up at the mention of Jack. He hasn’t seen the kid since he became the new god and said goodbye to the Winchesters. Their relationship wasn’t perfect but he’d been missing him.
“How long have you been–” Sam searched for the right word, “together”.
He feels a fluttering in his chest and his cheeks burn. It’s the tape he made for Cas a few years ago when he wanted to tell him how he was feeling but couldn’t manage to put it into words. It has all of Dean’s favorite songs because he wanted Cas to listen to them and know how Dean felt when they spent time together.
, by Journey blares loudly from a nearby speaker, echoing through the empty room.
Cas’ face goes red when he says this. He looks away from Dean once more, trying to avoid eye contact. It makes Dean chuckle. He puts a hand on Cas’ cheek to steal back his gaze. Now Dean has to stop laughing and just stare because their faces are only inches apart.
“It ain’t, ya idgit” Bobby replies, letting out a chuckle. Dean furrows his brow.
Of course, Bobby’s talking about Sam. He realizes with a surprise that he hasn’t been thinking about his brother in the last few minutes. The news about Cas and his parents had pretty much overshadowed all of his other thoughts.
“You know when you said I didn’t know what it implied,” Dean said.
To his surprise, Dean picked up the remote and hit the pause button. Sam was about to protest when he saw the look on his brother’s face. Dean was staring at a spot on the floor, avoiding Sam’s gaze, but Sam could tell his eyes were glazed over with tears.
“You said–you know what you said,” he can’t make himself repeat Cas’ words. He pauses again, hoping that if Cas is out there somewhere he will sense the desperation in Dean’s voice and show up.
The next smallest plug is about the girth of an electric toothbrush. He adds more lube before he starts to experiment with it. It goes in a little slower than the last one, and he winces, but once it’s all the way in he’s able to relax again. This time he can feel it a bit more intensely against his prostate. He closes his eyes and tries to imagine Cas inside him. Blood rushes to his cock immediately and he begins to stroke himself. Fuck it feels good.
He grips the steering wheel tighter, slowly bringing the car to a stop. It’s his heaven after all; who’s gonna care if he parks in the middle of the road?
Dean yelps as Cas pushes the rest of himself inside.
by Warrant. Suddenly he’s struck with another wave of dejavu; it’s weird how many times he’s felt that way since he’s been here. Bobby said this new heaven wasn’t built of memories, but somehow it still feels like it is.
Dean gets in the impala and slams the door shut. He pulls out of the dirt lot and drives down the same road he took when he first arrived in heaven, except this time he doesn’t stop after half an hour. He drives through a bare landscape and then a forest where the redwood trees are so tall he can’t see the sky.
“I need...” he can barely get the words out “I need you to tell me it’s okay. I need you to promise me–I need you to tell me that it’s okay.”
When he was on Earth the dream had gone through several renovations as his understanding had grown. He remembers one version in particular where a real angel of the lord had made an appearance. He shakes his head, taking a big gulp of his scotch. It burns on the way down.
“It’s about time,” John scoffs. Dean has really had it with John’s comments, but his mom looks at him with pleading eyes so he doesn’t say anything. How much has she been putting up with?
Dean slouches against the dungeon wall, head in hands. Cas is gone–for good this time. An overwhelming sense of loneliness and guilt washes over him. He is no stranger to this feeling, but it’s always been more intense when he loses Cas.
“One sec Cas” he needs to adjust. Taking a breath he relaxes his hole around Cas' cock. The pain doesn’t lessen but he’s comforted feeling Cas in the deepest part of him.
“Don’t even say that fucker’s name” John’s voice is suddenly filled with fury, “not after what he did to your Mother.”
“What Sam?”
Dean still seemed to be examining his brother’s face, probably making sure Sam approved of this kind of affectionate display. Sam beamed back at him, trying to put him at ease.
He shakes his head. Is his mind playing tricks on him? He rubs his eyes and looks again. No, he hasn’t imagined anything. Cas and Jack’s names aren’t there.
Bobby reaches into the cooler at their feet and pulls out a beer. He hands it to Dean and grabs another for himself.
“Wha–” suddenly Dean was being hurled across the room by Cas’ angel mogo. As his back hit the brick wall he found himself unable to move, unable to do anything but watch as the black void moved across the room and swallowed his best friend.
“I’m not hungry anymore.”
He laughs realizing how absurd it sounds, living in paradise without his best friend.
He thinks he’s supposed to be overjoyed with happiness, but instead he finds a lump in his throat.
He pulls into the gravel driveway, turns off the car, and hops out. As he approaches the tavern he hears the pounding of a beat getting louder and louder; there must be a party going on. When he swings open the door he’s taken aback by what he sees.
He wipes his face and starts the car, deciding to turn back the way he came. His heart is heavier than it was on the drive over.
“Amara? What does she have to do with anything?” Dean asks, his brain going in all different directions.
Dean paused for a moment, looking up from his lap, but then he just shook his head at Cas. Cas narrowed his eyes disapprovingly and then vanished with a fluttering of feathers.
“I think I’ll go for a drive,” he says, looking back to Bobby.
He picks up the pace with faster, longer strokes. His hips buck upwards and his cheeks feel hot like he's in a fever dream—and part of him thinks he is because he can’t believe he’s letting himself fantasize about being fucked by Cas.
As soon as he says it Dean feels relief washing over him. Warm tears stream down his cheeks and despite the pain he tries his best to give his brother a smile. He allows himself to sink into that feeling that’s been impossible for much of his life, that feeling that everything’s going to be okay.
He’s unsurprised when there is no answer. At this point he has come to expect the angel’s silence, except now he doesn’t feel angry about it. He just feels guilt. He has guilt for not doing anything when Cas confessed his feelings, and guilt from even before that. There had been so many opportunities for him to tell his best friend how he felt but he’d always held back.
The food tastes just the way he remembered it. He finishes the second sandwich and then bites into an apple slice. For a moment he is content. For a moment he starts to let it sink in that he is in heaven.
“Don’t do this, Cas” was the only response he could muster.
The sky is getting dark by the time he arrives back at Harvelle’s and the sign outside is lit up. It’s a nice touch, having the sky still change colors like it does on Earth.
Dean spins around to find Bobby. He’s sitting in an old barn chair on a porch, underneath a glowing sign that reads “Eastside on Draught”.
“Dean,” Sam says, his voice surprisingly steady, “it’s okay.”
Mom is here–and Dad? Dad made it to heaven?
“You’ve got everything you could ever want, or need, or dream.”
When Cas had said “I love you” it was the first time he’d really let himself believe the feelings could be reciprocated. He should have been overjoyed, but fear overshadowed any other emotion. The words that had gone unspoken between them for years were suddenly out in the open, and it was like a safety net had been swept out from under Dean’s feet. Not to mention the direness of the situation, with death literally pounding on the dungeon door and Cas talking about sacrificing himself.
The drinking, the anger, the nightmares: it was all because he’d been manipulated at a young age to think it was normal to have a dad that took off leaving him responsible for his little brother when he was just a kid. A dad who blamed him for every problem, who beat him down and diminished him for every little mistake.
“You know I don’t feel anything for her anymore, don’t you?” His brow furrows.
"Jerk" Sam replied, grabbing the remote.
“So I guess the question is,” Bobby continues, “what are you gonna do now, Dean?”
“How so?”
Some nights he prayed for the world not to end. Other nights he prayed just to say goodnight to Cas, asking him to come back to them in one piece. Even after watching Cas get swallowed up by the empty he couldn’t help himself from continuing to pray, just in case there was some way Cas could hear him.
John clasps Dean’s shoulder. “It’s good to see you, son.”
Then he hears the thump of footsteps and the kitchen door swings open with a slam.
“Cas has been pretty moody lately. He said I make him feel like a side chick, only seeing him on the down low.”
These occasions were more than just day trips; they were a much needed escape from the never-ending stress that came with the hunting lifestyle. Sitting on the dock he could look out across the still water and be completely overwhelmed by the vastness of it, until all of his problems felt small in comparison.
The air stirs and there's a flapping of wings, and suddenly the angel is sitting in the passenger seat of the impala.
Dean approaches the older hunter, continuing to scan his surroundings curiously.
“I’m sorry,” she says. “I can’t leave your father.”
“Are you alright, man?” Sam asked, getting even more concerned.
Cas was usually clueless about those things and just went with whatever Dean was doing, but that night he made a point to shift away from Dean ever so slightly, and kept returning the conversation back to more trivial matters. At last he declared he was going to bed and gave Dean a comforting pat on the shoulder before leaving. Of course Cas doesn’t need sleep, so Dean thought it was his way of delivering a polite rejection. He’d downed the rest of the bottle and sulked quietly before passing out at the table.
His stomach lurches and for a moment he thinks he might vomit on himself, but instead he breaks into another fit of sobs. Thank god he didn’t take Sam’s call. He needs time to pull himself together.
“What memory is this?” He asks.
Sam followed his gaze and through the kitchen door he saw Cas sitting on the kitchen counter. Cas also looked a little startled to see Sam; he hopped off the counter and began running his hands through his hair and straightening out his trenchcoat.
“Dean?” A woman’s voice calls out and the bedsheets stir ever so slightly.
“...Yes” Dean looked down at his hands.
“Dean, I heard you call my name. I thought you were hurt. I came immediately.”
“I had a family,” Dean mumbles.
Sam had tried calling a few times but Dean hadn’t picked up the phone. He couldn’t. What could he even say? That Cas had said the very words that Dean had been longing to hear, and because he did, he’s now dead? Maybe not dead, but trapped somewhere in a feelingless void–a fate worse than death, really. The thought is like a knife in Dean’s chest.
There is no response so he raises his voice slightly.
“Cas”
Sam considered sitting back down on the chair, and his aching body begged him to, but then he decided against it. There was something funny going on and secrets had never served them well. He caught up to Dean, which seemed to take his brother by surprise because he jumped a little.
What he sees when he opens the door takes him off guard. It’s not the bedroom he was expecting; in fact, it’s not his bedroom at all. It’s dark but he can still make out a crystal chandelier and a queen sized bed. He’s been here before.
“Dean,” Sam comforted, “that’s okay with me”.
Dean sits up fast, his eyes snapping open, and to his horror he locks eyes with Cas—not fantasy Cas, real Cas.
“I know you had your brother–and that angel,” John looks repulsed when he mentions Cas, and Dean feels a nervous lump form in his throat. His father had been on a crusade against all things Supernatural since Dean was a kid, so maybe he had something against angels too.
“Cas?”
“I know" Dean responds with a smirk.
There is no one behind the bar so he helps himself to a scotch that looks decent. He pours some into a glass, not bothering to measure out how many shots it is. He couldn’t possibly get a hangover in heaven, could he?
Dean finally relaxed into the hug, his chest heaving as he sobbed into his brother’s shoulder. Sam couldn't remember the last time his brother had been this vulnerable with him. He didn't even mind that Dean’s nose was probably running on his best flannel.
“What you said about wanting something you could never have… if I understood you correctly, if what you want is me, you can have it.”
John shakes his head.
“Mmmh” he moans painfully. He wants to feel the fucker inside of him so bad, and he’s not a wuss, but it feels like a hell fire inside his asshole. He has to take a second to pause before trying again.
He has more to say but he’s not sure how to word it so he pauses to collect his thoughts before clearing his throat and continuing.
Charlie’s face pops into his head and he cringes as another wave of guilt washes over him.
His head is spinning now. He considers going back to his room to sleep with Lisa but he gets a headache just thinking about it. Instead he fumbles across the room and settles down to sleep at one of the bunker lounge chairs. In a moment he’s nodding off.
“C’mere.”
Looking into his best friend’s tearful eyes he wanted nothing more than to show him how much he cared about him, but his feet were glued to the floor and there was a lump in his throat. When Cas pulled him close he thought for sure the angel was going to kiss him, but instead Dean was suddenly hurdled across the room. The pain he endured when his back hit the dungeon wall was dulled out by the pain in his chest when he realized that Cas was being swallowed up by the empty and there was nothing he could do to stop it.
"Like hell I don't."
“Hey, it’s okay!” Dean puts a hand on Cas’ shoulder to comfort him. Cas leans into Dean’s touch.
Dean doesn’t know how to respond so he turns to pour himself a cup of coffee before sitting back down at the table, avoiding eye contact.
“I wanted to come to you–to comfort you, but I was afraid that if I messed with the delicate balance–I was afraid I might ruin your chance of ever getting the heaven you deserve” he turns away from Dean now, swiping a tear from his eye.
His new family is on his mind. Jack has rebuilt heaven and Cas helped him do it. When Bobby mentioned that Cas was still alive, Dean was overcome with relief and probably grinning like an idiot, but he didn’t care. He’d spent weeks drinking heavily and losing sleep, overwhelmed by Castiel’s confession and his subsequent banishment to the empty. He’d thought he’d lost his friend for good this time. To know that Cas has somehow been freed is enough to make Dean forget why he’s in heaven in the first place.
When Castiel hadn’t responded, Sam had just sighed again, deep and long-suffering, and left the kitchen.
“How?” Castiel asked as Dean climbed behind the wheel.
“I haven’t been perfect either, Dean,” Castiel said. It was still hard sometimes to think about the myriad mistakes he’d made over the years that they’d known each other. “But we’ve made amends and moved forward. We’ve built a life together and that’s all I ever wanted.” He tilted his head down to press a kiss to Dean’s hair.
“Bees!” He yelled as he tugged at Dean’s hand, wiggling his toes that were painted in alternating yellow and black. “Pitty,” he cooed as he looked down at his own feet.
After an incredibly long moment where the two of them sat, frozen, staring at each other, Dean leaned forward and kissed him.
Which is how Dean found them when he got home from work. Castiel woke to him taking a photo on his phone.
“Cas,” Dean had stared at him seriously as Jack had nestled further into his shoulder, “I’m in.”
Dean cleared his throat and said, “I worked construction for a while when I was younger. I’d be more than happy to take a look at things for you, see if I can spot any trouble.”
On the day of the move, they’d created a bizarre caravan heading north from the bunker to South Dakota. Sam had followed the Impala in a rented U-Haul that was mostly filled with Jack’s nursery furniture while Eileen had been kind enough to agree to drive Castiel’s truck so that Castiel himself could keep Jack company in the backseat of the Impala during the long drive. Dean and Castiel had very few of their own belongings coming with them since they’d decided it would be easier to furnish their own rooms and the rest of the housr from stores closer to their new home.
“It might be too cold outside to do bubbles today,” Castiel explained, as though it was possible to sway a determined toddler with straightforward logic, “but we can give it a try.”
The tension between them had finally broken one morning two months in when Castiel had been the first person in the kitchen. He hadn’t slept the night before and was ready to start his day before Jack and Dean had woken.
The easy domesticity that had followed had Castiel in a near-constant state of longing for something he couldn’t have. But having Dean here at all was more than he’d ever expected to have and he wasn’t going to risk pushing him away.
“Mm,” Castiel hummed in agreement as his eyes slipped shut and he rested his head against the window, allowing the familiar hum of the Impala to lull him to sleep.
“What? No, Cas do you know how much things cost?” Dean had said. “We need to aim for something with actual salaries, not minimum wage. Fuckin’ capitalism.”
Leah blushed slightly, “It’s just… odd things seem to happen sometimes. I’ll leave a room and swear I turned the light off but then it’ll be on when I pass by again. There have been a couple times where I’ll be working with something, a paint brush or pencil, and put it down and then it’s just gone and I’ll find it across the room. It also gets really cold all randomly, it gives me the literal chills,” Leah looked down at her plate. “And of course it only happens at night when I’m by myself and Abby’s working.” She seemed to shake herself out of her thoughts, “I’m sure it’s nothing, though. Probably some wires that need replacing, old insulation, and absentmindedness.”
Before he could respond someone said, “What the fuck was that?”
Abby blinked at him, “The main characters, the brothers, their names…”
The life that he and Dean had built together was more than enough.
“Oh,” Castiel said, looking down at his plate. He’d certainly noticed a decrease in Dean’s sexual encounters but he’d had no idea they’d stopped completely. They both sat in silence for a few minutes that was broken only by Jack’s happy babble as he ate his breakfast, unaware of the tension around him.
“You’re not obligated, of course,” Castiel had said in case his thought was wrong, “You’ve already taken on so much of the burden raising Jack when it wasn’t something you asked for. I know how much you care about hunting, that giving it up wouldn’t be a decision you’d make lightly.”
“What’s up, Cas?” Dean asked from where he’d been noting legitimate electrical and structural concerns as Castiel went still and focused.
In fact, Dean hadn’t complained about much of anything since they’d moved here. He changed diapers, cleaned up Jack’s messes (and sometimes Castiel’s), cooked and kept up with the yardwork, all while acting there was nothing he’d rather be doing. Castiel had worried in the beginning that eventually Dean would realize he wasn’t enjoying this quiet domesticity, that he missed the fast paced life of hunting full-time. However, they’d been here almost a full year now and Dean hadn’t hinted at wanting to leave or regretting his choice once.
“I fucking miss flip phones,” Dean muttered, glaring at the rectangular smartphone in his hand. “Hanging up on Sam was so much more satisfying that way.”
Dean loved him, even if it wasn’t the type of love he longed for that didn’t make that love any less precious. Who was Castiel to squander that?
“I know I’m not exactly smart enough to keep up with you academic types, but I promise I won’t embarrass you,” Dean said. His tone was joking, but Castiel could see the insecurity clearly written on his face.
“I didn’t get a chance to tell you last night, but Leah came into the shop yesterday,” Dean explained, “nice girl by the way. But imagine my surprise when she told me how much Abby likes working with my husband. AKA you, apparently.” Fortunately Dean’s tone was teasing rather than angry. His eyes sparkled with mirth as he watched Castiel squirm under his gaze.
“Just because you can handle something, doesn’t mean you should be burdened with it,” Cas said easily, as if it didn’t affect Dean’s entire worldview. Before Dean could come up with a response, Cas spotted Abby and Leah walking toward them and waved.
Laying in the dark, Castiel listened to Dean’s breathing deepen as he fell asleep. As Castiel allowed his own eyes to slip shut, he felt overwhelmingly lucky that his life had led him here.
Castiel had insisted on giving Dean the master bedroom after seeing Dean’s excitement over the attached bathroom’s massive shower with a rain style showerhead. Of course Dean had argued with him, but Castiel had won when he’d pointed out that he didn’t need to sleep every night so there was no reason for him to have the nicer bedroom.
Cas smirked back at him, “You have been very patient this week.” His voice was a low rumble that sent a shiver down Dean’s spine. It had turned out that Cas was kind of bossy in bed and Dean was kind of incredibly into that.
“Take your time,” Dean said, already mentally planning how he could distract Jack by letting him “help” with the pancake mix. “We’re not gonna go anywhere.”
Once he was gone, Castiel turned the television off and went to the kitchen and reheated his dinner. Even though the house was now still and silent, he didn’t feel alone in the comfortable space that he and Dean had created together.
“Dean has seemed different since I’ve been back,” Castiel had said carefully. “I’ve noticed he’s not drinking anymore, and he’s been… nicer.” Castiel hadn’t been sure if that was even the right way to describe it, but he also couldn’t think of a better description.
When Castiel awoke the next morning to his six-thirty alarm he wished he could stay in bed just a bit longer. His grace was flitting just out of his reach today, making sleep feel more like a necessity than an indulgence. But he knew that he needed to get up so that Dean would be on time to open the garage.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “He’s mostly hands-off these days, though, people's shitty behavior is all their own.”
Caught up in his thoughts, Castiel hadn’t heard Dean leaving the room until the door had opened and they were staring at each other. Dean had frozen like he’d been caught doing something wrong, his eyes had been red and glassy and Castiel had had the horrifying realization that Dean had been crying.
“I found us a hunt,” Dean had barked at Sam, ignoring Castiel and Jack completely.
“It’s okay,” Dean said. “Yeah, I did go to hell. Don’t really wanna talk about the specifics, but that happened.”
“I can show you around a bit while Leah finishes getting lunch together,” Abby said. “Should we start in the basement? It’s not at all finished, but a lot of the electrical crap is down there.”
“Your back is going to bother you if you stay here,” Castiel said, repeating a frequent complaint of Dean’s. The couch was an exceptionally comfortable large leather sectional, but it was less supportive than Dean’s beloved memory foam mattress.
“Nope, just weird. But what in our lives fucking isn’t?” Dean said. “Come on, let’s get home. I’m still looking forward to the rest of the night of you, me, and an empty house.” He flashed a suggestive wink over at Cas.
Sam shakes his head, grimacing, but then his eyes meet Dean’s again.
He still doesn’t know what he’s going to tell Sam and Jack, but what he does know is that he’s not giving up. Not giving up on the world and not giving up on Cas.
"You know me" Dean smirked, "I'm the meat man".
About 5 minutes later Sam heard a conversation taking place in the kitchen. Sometimes Cas came round in the evenings to spend time with the brothers so he assumed that’s who it was. Not wanting to move from his nook he called out to Dean.
“Goodbye Sam,” he manages to whisper.
“Why don’t we call him over now?” Sam suggested, “Let him know that I know, and I’m cool with it. It’ll probably cheer him up a bit.”
When they finally pull away Dean notices that Cas’ eyes are wet with tears.
When Dean realized that Cas was confessing his feelings he was shocked. The guy who had been shutting him down for weeks actually loved him back. He wanted so badly to reciprocate but he feared having any reaction would summon the empty as Cas had said would happen when he experienced a moment of true happiness.
Dean can’t stop thinking about the day he had with Cas. It was so different from anything he’s had in the past. He’s had flings with so many women that sometimes the nights all blend into one. He doesn’t want to rush things but he lets his mind wander. He knows sex with Cas is going to be different, and it scares him, but he wants to experience things differently than he has before.
Sam had noticed the shift in their relationship and much to Dean’s surprise, he didn’t seem phased by any of it. He just smiled and said, “I'm happy for you, man”.
Suddenly John is moving toward him and Dean feels the sting as John’s hand makes contact with his cheek, knocking him out of his seat and onto the floor. Normally he would have gotten angry and clapped back but now all he can do is smile up at his father. John’s abusive tactics are just further proving to Dean what he already knew deep inside.
“We weren’t really fighting,” Dean responded, and then Sam became even more confused than he was a second ago.
Dean hardly ever cried, especially in front of Sam. Whatever this fight was about clearly had him torn up.
"C'mon let me have my nickname" Dean pouted.
“You heard my prayer?” He asks.
“It’s just, ya know, an adjustment I suppose,” Dean says.
Now he’s yelling his lover’s name and he can’t stop.
Dean wills him to be right. This heaven was built by his best friend, the person he’s confided in about everything–well, almost everything. Even if it’s not everything Dean
Cas gives Dean one last look with eyebrows raised and Dean just nods. Then Cas is pushing in, slowly. Dean tries to relax. With just the tip inside it doesn’t hurt, but as Cas pushes further in Dean has to shut his eyes and grip the bed sheets. Still Cas pushes in deeper and now Dean lets out a moan because his angel’s cock is so thick inside of him. A few more inches in and now Dean feels the burning sensation again; he knows this is gonna hurt bad but he lets Cas carry on.
He can feel the tears already forming, and he doesn’t try to hold them back. For once in his life–or afterlife–he’s gonna be vulnerable. It’s what Cas deserves at the very least.
“Yeah sorry,” Dean rubbed his forehead. “Oh shit I forgot the food.”
But then he remembers Cas’ words.
“Well–don’t get me wrong. Lisa… she’s a special girl. I just–I miss” he’s careful about how he words this next sentence.
Cas’ pace intensifies and now Dean can’t catch a break. He writhes under Cas, moaning and cursing and jerking himself off desperately. Cas’ cock is like a hot iron driving into him, filling him non-stop with agony. But god it feels good too, with Cas striking him in the right spot over and over.
As soon as Dean closes the car door behind him he opens the glove compartment on the passenger side to browse through his cassette tape collection. He flicks past Kansas and Warrant, and then something catches his eye. One of the tapes has been flipped so the label is facing downwards. He flips it over and reads it.
Sam sighed in frustration. Sometimes he felt like he was playing marriage counselor between Dean and Cas. For best friends they sure did get into it a lot. Cas was gone and it didn’t seem like Dean was going to budge so reluctantly Sam retreated to the Dean cave.
“Take off your pants”
“Yes, Dean?” The angel’s voice is shaky and unsure but his eyes search the hunter’s face with longing.
Dean shrugged and slowly turned back to face Sam, but his eyes were pinched shut as if it pained him to look at his brother and tell him what was on his mind.
Mary is at the stove making breakfast.
He starts on his burger and it’s not long before he’s devoting more of his attention to his food than to the girls on stage. The patty is moist and the fries are prepared with just the right amount of salt. The portion of food he’s been served is enough to leave him feeling satisfied but not bloated. He downs the rest of his drink and stands up, the alcohol suddenly hitting him.
