A shiver ran up his spine when he heard the low growl vibrate from the Alpha’s throat. And he only heard the name ‘Rumlow’ fall from the man’s lips, before he was leaving the tent with only a fur hastily thrown over his shoulders and his boots carelessly shoved onto his feet.
“The man with the scars.” Steven lifted his gaze to lock with the Omega’s, his eyes sad but filled with fire. “You need not worry about him anymore.”
“I know you will be. You are such a good, sweet, little prince,” Steven cooed, sliding his hands down to squeeze the Omega’s ass, kissing - warm and wet. “Do you want me, Omega?” He murmured, hot and heavy against his throat.
, Anthony’s traitorous mind supplied. He had yet to answer for the conditions he had been brave enough to ask the Alpha King, to consummate a mating that had yet to be made.
Steven’s touch set fire to his skin. An ache deep in the pit of his stomach throbbed with desire as the Alpha’s teeth grazed the senstive skin that covered his scent glands. Anthony had no other choice than to hold onto him. He loathed himself for submitting to his own instinctual pleasure, but fighting would only lead to punishment, and he refused to let the Alpha go back on his promise. He was willing to sacrifice everything, including himself, for the good of his people. “I will be good for you, Alpha,” he breathed, the words feeling heavy on his tongue.
Anthony gasped at the adventurous touch, his eyes almost rolling to the back of his head from the intense wave of arousal it gave him. He had never experienced this kind of pleasure before, and it was tearing him apart at the seams. “Y… Yes,” he gasped, “take me. Please.” His inner thighs were wet with slick. Just the smell and touch of the Alpha alone was enough to trigger wave after wave of arousal, and he was suddenly blind with need.
It was odd to hear someone willingly call him theirs. To be possessed by someone who would do anything - even kill his own men - to keep him safe from any harm. To be touched like he was something to be cared for. The Alpha King held him as if he were something precious, just like the jewels that glittered against his tanned skin.
The young Omega laid there among the pile of soft furs and bared his neck to the Alpha, a true form of presentation and submission in the eyes of their second nature. With a heavy gaze through a fan of lashes, he stared coyly at his captor hovering above him, all muscles and brute strength, beckoning the Alpha to him.
. But Obadiah was long gone by now, and he wasn’t there to stop him from spitting into the man’s face.
In response, Steven latched his mouth to the Omega’s bare neck, where he smelled the sweetest. “I will take you, and you will be mine, little prince. No one else is to have you, except for me.” His cock pulsed with the desperate need to be inside of the Omega, leaking with precum as he plunged two fingers inside his virgin hole.
“You are safe here, Omega. Nothing will come of harm to you anymore. I will be sure of it.” The voice that woke him was rough yet gentle, a low timber that rumbled deeply from his chest.
The Alpha rested a hand on the Omega’s face, soft and gentle. His hands were roughened from years on the battlefield, only wielding his weapons of choice - a shield and a sword - in order to conquer and spread his rule throughout the land. He brushed a thumb across the apple of Anthony’s cheek, and he stared in stunned and awesome silence as he took to his touch so willingly.
“I will gladly subject myself to your will,” Anthony answered with the conviction of a man who had lost everything, “if it ensures that my people are kept safe.” But like any Omega - especially an unbonded one at that - left in the hands of an Alpha, he began to respond instinctively to the Alpha’s touch, and he was slowly starting to unravel. “I desire,” he breathed heavily, “nothing for myself.”
,” he spat out his status like an insult, his voice menacing, “our King might not be so kind.” He was thrown back to the floor, completely defenseless. And that’s how the group of men left him, trembling and wet from the tears flowing steadily down his cheeks, one of which had already darkened into an angry red.
The Omega stared at the paradox of a man before him. The more time he spent with him, the more baffled he got. It took him a moment to fully understand what the man was talking about, and his eyes widened in realization the moment it hit him. “You…” He looked down at the Alpha’s hands and saw the blood caked beneath his fingernails. “...You didn’t have to do that. You didn’t have to do anything. It was my fault.”
The Alpha considered him, his gentle gaze roving over the Omega’s face. “Outside this tent, you may call me ‘Alpha.’ But here—”
And that was the thing. Many tributes were given to him either with ulterior motives from their home kingdoms, to appease the Warlord of the North and keep their kingdoms spared, but only few volunteered willingly. And even then, most tributes weren’t part of the royal family themselves. He should have known things were awry when he had gotten word that the Crown Prince was to be his latest tribute from the Southern Isles.
It was almost amusing to him, that in such a state, he was still a prisoner. The twenty-one summers he spent as the Crown Prince of the Southern Isles vanished in a matter of days. He was no one’s Prince, and one day, he would be no one’s King. He was only to be the tribute - the slave - of someone much more powerful than he. And Obadiah’s cowardice was to blame.
Steven grinned - wide and pleased - and pulled Anthony towards the bed at the rear of the tent. Sat atop this bed of cloth and straw was a large pile of furs the Omega gladly sunk into. “Good boy. My little one,” he murmured with glee, glad to see his Omega so obliging. Rumlow had relayed to him how unwilling the Omega had been when they had taken him to his quarters earlier that day so he had been expecting a scrappy, young prince with no sense of self-preservation. The people of the Southern Isles, and especially their royalty, were of the aggravating and self-centered sort. But Anthony showed none of that thus far.
“Wouldn’t even blame you,” May said on another laugh, cheeks flushed as though she’d had a small tipple already. “Although I’m more partial to vodka, if you wouldn’t mind.”
There was a deep laceration underneath Tony’s left eye, deep and ugly and something that would no doubt scar. Peter couldn’t look away from it.
Fuck, but how did he always get himself into messes? He didn’t want to talk to anyone, didn’t want to have to explain what happened or what he’d done. All he wanted was to be loved by the man he loved, to be wanted back and to be seen as more than a drunken fuck.
Peter’s eyes nearly bulged out of his head. When Tony had gotten the call from May to pick Peter up for Christmas he’d wondered – and worried – privately whether Peter was too old for the magic of Christmas. Luckily, he seemed to still enjoy every aspect of it and believe just as fiercely as any other very young child Tony had met.
Steve smiled at Tony and shrugged into his jacket, shoving his phone into his pocket and waving his keys in Tony’s face.
“I’ve queued up the best list of movies for tonight. There’s a theme and you’re gonna have to guess-”
The message finished and the automated voice announced that there was also a second one. Steve snorted before it started, expecting to hear his mom’s voice changing the time of their meeting or possibly a butt dial of Sarah singing loudly whilst doing the dishes or sorting laundry. So when he heard a voice that he hadn’t heard for months suddenly amplified in his living room, Steve startled almost comically.
The smile on Nurse Rogers’ face didn’t dip at all. “Okay, my lovely. Pregnant for sure, or just a hunch?”
Steve felt tears well up in his eyes and the urge to stand up and grab the phone got even stronger. He wished that he had the strength to stop the recording from playing, but he knew that he wanted to do the stupid thing of calling Tony back to beg him to come home even more.
The first one didn’t want to light, but once it did it settled Steve’s nerves with the first drag. The second one stopped his hands from shaking. The third one was lit and smoked with muscle memory alone, calming the pounding behind his eyes, and Steve stopped giving himself a reason by the fourth. It was only when he reached out and his fingers closed around nothing that he realised the brand new packet was empty.
He’d only wanted to make something a little special for Steve. Their anniversary had been interrupted by a battle and they’d gone from a romantic meal at a five-star restaurant to suited up and locked in a fight with an alien invader. Given that they were meant to eat out, their kitchen wasn’t exactly stocked for cooking.
Though Tony was addressing Steve, his gaze didn’t wander from Peter’s face for a second. His eyes flickered over Peter’s body, taking everything in. It was hard for Peter to care about the attention when he was doing the exact same thing, cataloguing every bruise and every extra wrinkle.
Tony’s voice brought Steve out of his thoughts and back into the room. He shuffled himself from the arm of the couch until he could drop down onto the cushions, envelopes crinkling below him as he sunk into the comfort of Tony’s voice washing over him.
“No, Tony. The team will come and we’ll get out of here. As soon as we do, I’ll go to your workshop and get the ring from the desk drawer you never bother looking in, even when you say you check there whenever you can’t find things. And once I’ve got that, I’ll ask you.” There was a loud sniff and then Steve’s voice started again, thicker than before but just as beautiful to Tony’s clouded brain. “There’ll be flowers and chocolate and champagne and so much romance that you won’t know what hit you.”
“Holy shit,” Tony said, words breathless but dripping with agony. “I can’t do this, Steve. I’m sorry; I’m so sorry.”
There was a slight beard, too. Not like the one Tony had had in the last picture that Steve had seen – the one that Steve assumed was the bad-choice winter beard – but a small, neatly trimmed goatee sort of thing. Steve would never have gone for it himself, but it suited the other man.
Steve stopped talking when Tony cut across him. God, when had they gotten so bad at communication? What had broken between them, or when?
Sam pressed his lips together, eyes shining with amusement. “Sorry, Steve. Looks like Santa needs a helper for just thirty minutes more.”
“Oh.” Steve stopped in the doorway and tilted his head with a grimace. “That was weak. That was really, really weak.”
After all, it was hardly even a Christmas, really. The house was only decorated in the living room with a patchy tree that only had baubles in the places that Peter could reach. Tony had had food delivered, but he’d forgotten to actually add a turkey to his basket and the Christmas jumper he’d found shoved away in the back of his wardrobe was about a size too small.
“Sorry,” Tony said, not feeling it in the slightest. It was clear in his tone as well and he knew Steve didn’t believe him. “But this is just the right shade of black for my pocket-square. I don’t have anything else I could find this late that fits this well.”
“I can’t say his name,” Sarah said, reaching out behind her to guide herself down to the chair. Her legs weren’t strong enough to stand just yet. “But he’s, he must have been with my Steve.”
Steve frowned. He wasn’t hot on geography, but he was pretty sure he knew most big cities and countries. “Where?”
“Ha. Ha.” Though he’d heard the joke a hundred times in that week alone, Steve found that he didn’t mind it so much with it was paired with Tony’s slow smile. “My colleague Sam does the chopping, actually. If you head back over to the tree, I’ll grab him and bring him over.”
He wanted to be remembered. Sure, he could just tell Steve, but he didn’t want that. He wanted Steve to want to wake up with him, to want to kiss him when there wasn’t the stale taste of warm beer and cheap vodka staining his lips.
“Please,” Steve said and, damn, how Tony loved to hear Steve beg. It happened so rarely, but Tony treasured each occasion. It was nice to hold the power for once. Steve didn’t have quite the same wiles that Tony employed when it was him begging, so it was a little easier to hold out. “I’m asking you nicely.”
“I left him.” Tony hated the words that left his mouth, however true they were. “I don’t even know why, but I did. Things were serious and I loved him. I wasn’t sure how he felt about me, I don’t think. That might have been it.”
“No!” Peter tugged on Tony’s hand and pouted up at him. “Need to see the owl go. And our tree! Can’t leave without a tree. Please, Tony.”
“My pleasure,” Steve said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the bag of marshmallows. “Tony found these. He went searching high and low in the kitchen for them because he said it wasn’t a real hot chocolate without them. Isn’t he awesome?”
Peter was watching intently, zooming in as close as he could from every possible angle. He was now almost sure that they’d met them in a previous battle. As it was his job to come up with a way to take down the enemy quickly, Peter quickly made his sole focus on that task instead.
Tony’s eyes shot back to his nurse, only to find her looking at the screen as she moved the wand a little more.
“No,” Steve said quickly, choking on the word, “no, it’s…” Trailing off, he bit his lip until it started to sting, knowing he couldn’t end that sentence how he was going to. Because what sort of an asshole would he have been if he said out
too." He pressed fingers firmly against the plug and Steve groaned quietly, low in his throat, his cock jumping from the increase in sensation.
“Get a picture of this,” Clint suggested and Tony brought his phone around to see Clint had gone from a thumb to
“Three cocks in his ass,” Clint agreed, spreading Steve’s ass cheeks, examining the lay of the land before smacking them together and reaching for the lube. “Steve, that the reward you want?”
When Clint clapped his hands three times, everyone stilled. Tony's head didn't come up, but Steve and Thor's gazes were instantly sharp. Clint shook his head. "It was good," he promised the quiet men. "It was... amazing." Everything he'd fantasized about and more. He rubbed the back of Tony's sweaty shoulders. "But someone is pretty far under." He could see his lovers really taking Tony in: the glazed eyes, the insane number of tally marks covering Tony’s ass and face, the way that they were so smudged by come and sweat that he was a mess of black smears.
. But this was clearly a well-loved car, polished to a shine even if there were a few dings here and there that said it had lived.  Steve adjusted the heavy-framed sunglasses on his face and glanced around, hoping
There was a long pause and Tony could imagine Thor considering the benefits of finishing the last hand versus getting Steve on his knees. “I too fold. Steve, I believe you win.”
"Ow," Tony said very distinctly in a voice gone gravely. After the number of times they'd shoved a cock down his throat, no wonder. But then Tony turned to look at Clint. His expression lacked... something, but there was definitely personality behind his eyes  again. Annoying personality. "Why did you stop?" Tony demanded. Clint's gaze went, involuntarily, to the athletic cup. They should take care of that. Letting everyone
He slid out of Steve slowly, his cock too sensitive to stay wedged in like that. Clint was gesturing at him with two fingers like he was saying 'stand up.' As soon as Tony stood, Thor was pushing Steve onto his back between Thor's legs, his cock still in Steve's ass while he gripping Steve's cock in both hands, pumping him dramatically. "You triumphed," Thor told Steve with pride. "You won the poker, and you have taken all of our cocks. You are a true champion at cockslutting."
back to the bar. While the Falcons slammed through the Panthers' defensive line, Clint settled into Tony's well-worked ass, fucking him casually. Not so tight now. Clint's cock was as deep as it would go, and he just stopped thrusting, letting Tony's body keep him warm and hard. Steve came over to chat about end-runs. Thor stuffed himself back into Tony's mouth while he talked about some Asgardian sport that sounded like football if football was played by immortals who didn't need to worry about broken bones and traumatic brain injuries. Or maybe rugby. Clint continued just sheathing himself in Tony's ass and Tony started to twitch against and around him.
Steve whispered, “Oh my god.” (From Steve, that was serious stuff.) As Tony moved, Cap ducked his face until Thor put a hand under his chin, ‘making’ him look at the camera.
“-drunk. Yes, we are aware, good Captain,” Thor agreed while he casually thrust into Tony’s ass with absent-minded strength, each movement slapping their bodies together. “Nor am I likely to grow inebriated from such weak Midgardian libations-“ There were noises of protest from around the o-ring, but they all ignored it: Tony didn’t actually want to stop, he just didn’t know how to shut up. “-but it is both traditional and pleasant to partake.” Clint saw Thor pause, balls-deep in Stark’s ass, bend down to reach for the whiskey, pour himself a tall glass of it, return the bottle, and then get right back to fucking him. Clint fucking loved Thor.
Catching Steve's hand, Tony nipped at the base of the thumb. "I want someone to suck me off. Then I want to hear, in depth, how you enjoyed my full-service bar." He clearly preened as the three of them vied over who would suck him off. Vain bastard. Clint thought Tony had never looked better.
“It’s a whole thing, Thor,” Clint assured, drinking his beer at the other end of the bar. The dark wooden bar had been some special order shit and only came up to Clint’s hips. He had to keep remembering to lean down a little when he set his drink down. A little silly. On the other hand, the bar was perfect because it meant that both of Tony's fuckholes were at a perfect level for them to thrust into. “Steve, you want a drink?”
“He needs to breathe, Clint,” Steve said with concern, like Tony wasn’t perfectly capable of telling Barton to shove his cock somewhere else if he didn’t like what the archer was doing. Just in case Clint needed a reminder of that, Tony sucked in a breath through his nose and fought Clint’s hands enough to push his face
Then Steve groaned louder, tears leaking out of his eyes. Thor was pulling his hand back out. Tony only realized he was holding his breath when Clint bumped him and whispered, "Breathe."
Tony perked up. “Really?” he asked, touching himself a little at the thought. They didn't do that very often. Steve healed fast, but he was tight. And Thor was
“I don’t know why we’re even pretending,” Clint said, rapidly flicking cards across the table like a professional casino dealer. Tony would never tell the guy, but he loved watching Barton do his carny schtick. It was weird, but impressive. “Strip poker, yay, but we all know Steve is going to blow it, despite the fact that he has… enhanced cognitive whatsit.”
fuck him up. Hell, Clint had practically been fisting the guy and Tony had barely whimpered in protest.
Clint, tired of waiting, unzipped his jeans, shoved them down just far enough, pulled out his half-hard cock, and fed it through the ring of Tony’s gag. It was warm in Tony's mouth and wet from saliva. Clint could practically hear it dripping down Tony's face. This had to be one of the dirtiest things Clint had ever done and it was going straight to his balls. Once Clint sank his cock in a little deeper, it sat pleasantly on Tony’s trembling tongue. The gag prevented Tony from closing his mouth. The scene prevented Tony from participating even the little he could. Instead, he just warmed Clint’s cock while the football game played on the wall. Clint smiled lazily at Steve. “IPA, lager, or porter?”
Then Clint gave Steve a showy, useless shove and said, “Get on your knees and spread those cheeks. I’m going to take a picture of your puffy, well-fucked hole!”
“I do not understand this rule,” Thor complained, frowning in the direction of the screen while pushing his trousers out of the way. Adjusting Tony's drape across the smooth wooden surface of the bar, Thor carefully working the thick anal plug free of Tony’s ass, leaving him slick and gaping. “The team of Falcons has committed a violation most foul and the clock has been stopped. And yet they remove ten seconds from the clock?” He gripped Tony’s hips and thrust inside, eyes barely flickering away from the game.
“Bucky had taken Sam back to yours before we went. The whole passing-out-on-the-bathroom-floor thing was kind of a downer so Bucky said he’d take him home. You and I stayed out for a bit longer and, I don’t know.”
“Hi,” he returned cautiously. He tried to look discreetly over the chairs to see if Tony was awake, but Peter caught him.
“Hello?” he snapped and he didn’t even have to fake the agitation for once. He was genuinely exhausted and he didn’t like to be interrupted on the verge of sleep when it happened so rarely. “Hello?”
“I can’t, Peg. I’ll change it when I go out there if it’s been put through with me already, but I… no. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.”
But, having said that, Steve had been drunk with Tony before and Tony wasn’t an emotional drunk. A happy and overtly-sexual one, yes, but not an emotional drunk. Not like Steve, who frequently professed his love for strangers he met in bars and clubs whenever he had more than two drinks.
“I know.” Sarah wiped her eyes again with the sides of her hands, rubbing the tears away on her scrubs. “That’s enough. And I trust him.”
When Steve frowned, Peter shook Philip. “Daddy says having different ‘lections makes planes fun. He gets me toys from all the times he goes on a plane.”
Steve felt his cheeks flush. He didn’t like kids, his brain shouted again, he didn’t understand them. “Don’t kids like everyone?”
“Sure it is,” Tony gasped, throwing a hand over his heart. “Dobby, back me up. Santa’s elves can’t lie.”
“No other way,” Tony answered for him, a bite to his words. “There wasn’t, Steve. You know that, even if you don’t want to admit it.”
“Oh for the–” One day, Tony would learn how not to bow to each and every one of Peter’s whims. “Okay, okay.” Tony covered Peter’s mitten-covered hands with his own as the boy pressed close to him, rubbing them to warm them up. Looking to Sam and Steve, who had appeared with a horribly confused expression, he shrugged in resignation. “What do we do?”
“It’s the least I can do after you rang the animal rescue and got them out here so fast. I wouldn’t have had a clue what to do if it had been me.”
Steve sunk his teeth into his lower lip, trying to focus on the slight sting of that instead of the lump growing in his throat. He tried to placate himself with the thought that Tony might ring back. That would be better in the long run; if Tony remembered what he had done and what he’d said on the phone and rang back to tell Steve that it
He heard Tony chuckle. “Don’t let Peter hear that. Although I doubt he’d go for that, actually. He’s far too sweet.”
“Hey,” Tony said and Steve looked back at him, only to see that he was speaking to Peter. His eyes were trained on the boy and his tone extremely soft. “Come on, buddy. Time to wake up.”
Steve used his grip on Tony’s hand to pull Tony into his chest, wrapping his free arm around Tony’s waist to hold them close together. Tony gave up without a fight, his shoulders slumping as he rested his hand on Steve’s chest.
Divorce as an adult meant no more Steve. It meant that Tony had been such a shit husband that he had driven away the only man that had ever truly loved him. It would mean cold days, sleepless nights, quiet and empty rooms.
Tony scrunched his nose up in thought as he went about pouring a cup of coffee. “I think so. I wrapped up around 5, I think, so whatever gap was between then and now is how much sleep I got.”
Sarah felt Peggy hurry across the room and then her warm embrace was wrapped around her. Leaning back into the hold, Sarah reached up and held Peggy’s wrist.
Once, Tony had thought named decorations were tacky, but he’d grown quite accustomed to them and his heart tugged every time he saw Peter poke them gently.
Tony winced as he tried to sit up, Steve surging forward to help him. Smacking Steve’s hand away lightly, Tony kept his eyes on his son.
“No,” Tony said, taking one hand off Steve’s neck as he stepped back again. When he had room, Tony reached down to his pocket-square, already feeling a rush of lust spike through him. “I meant they.”
“I can get some hot chocolate.” Steve didn’t think the burner at the customers’ stall was still on, but he figured he could use the staff stash if needed. Hot chocolate was a winter necessity, after all, and it was bitterly cold. Far too cold for Peter to be standing around, really.
“Shush, Peter.” Tony rubbed his thumb along Peter’s hairline, Steve’s fingers tapping his shoulder. “It’s okay. I know. I know, kid, of course I know. Everything’s okay now.”
“No,” Steve eventually managed to stutter out, “it’s my uniform.” A stupid one, at that, and not something that kept Steve particularly warm when the snow began to fall.
With a loud sniff, Peter turned his face ever so slightly. Tony felt himself relax a tiny, tiny bit and Steve must have taken it as permission to continue.
“Keep that terror entertained,” Tony said, pulling a face at Peter to make him giggle, “and I’ll buy you all the coffee you could ever want.”
to Tony and Steve was saying that he didn’t remember it? There was no way that that was possible. Steve had been drunk, sure, but not so bad that he wouldn’t be able to recall… what they’d done.
“Blue,” Tony answered immediately. He didn’t need to think about that, not for a second. It was all he’d imagined since the first time he’d hunched over the toilet and thrown up his breakfast. A tiny bundle with bright blue eyes, that’s what he wanted. “Steve’s were blue. That’s the dominant one, right? God, I hope so.”
It was a chaotic, unplanned mess, but it was a better Christmas than Tony had had for years. Though it probably wouldn’t have done for anyone else, it was Christmas enough for Tony.
Galas could be boring – for recent college-graduate Tony, anyway – and he thought the businessman needed something to focus his attention on. If it made him hard and kept his gaze and mind on Tony all night instead of the trophy wives and bombshells walking around, then, well, that was just an added bonus. Not part of his plan at all.
Ignoring Tony who was silently laughing at his predicament, Steve forced a smile onto his face. It spread quite naturally. “It was great, Peter. Thanks for sharing it with me.”
“No.” There was a loud rattling of chains and a scuffle of material and Tony winced at the noise. “Tony, no.”
“Huh,” Steve said, huffing out a laugh. “Don’t even remember ordering that, but it sounds about right.”
“No, mom,” Tony replied dutifully, the words spilling from his mouth without much thought at that point. He felt like a broken record player. Or a robot. “Enjoy yourself.”
Suddenly, Steve was off like a shot and, with a loud squeal, Peter dashed away too. His laughed screams were heard throughout the house as Steve chased him for a Christmas kiss.
“You’d have done the same thing,” Tony said finally. It was clear from the way that he set his shoulders and kept his voice steady that he remembered. It made Steve want to cry, if anything. “You know you would.”
“Oh, baby.” The name didn’t bother Peter like it usually did, even made his eyes prick with tears and his throat burn. “Has that been bothering you?”
Taking a deep breath and turning slightly, Tony returned Ana’s hug and pressed his own kiss to her head. He let his eyes fall shut as he held her, wishing her nothing but the best for wherever she ended up. Tony had forced his parents to set aside money for Jarvis’s retirement – and wasn’t that a kick in the head – and he knew that he would find some way to push that down to Ana. He had to.
Steve’s fingers danced up Tony’s spine. “Are you really going to wear your own dirty panties in your pocket all night?”
Peter did so wordlessly, shooting Tony a soft smile as he slid into a chair by the table. “What else do you want me to do?”
“That was me,” Steve said, words carefully thought out, if a little hesitant, “swiping right. If you’ll still have me. I’m swiping right on both of you.”
“You should be with the ones you love on Valentine’s Day,” Steve said, his voice heartbreakingly insecure. “I was sitting there with Andrew, who was being so sweet and so kind just like he always is, and all I could think about was what you were doing. Whether or not you were heading out, if you were stuck down in the lab forgetting to eat, if you were being kissed and spoilt the way you deserve.”
At the touch, Steve pulled Tony even closer and Tony sighed in utter contentment, letting his eyes fall closed as he ignore the caffeine flowing through his body and gave into sleep once more.
“Gym,” Natasha said, throwing a thumb over her shoulder to show where she wanted Peter to go. “Spar session. You’re ten minutes late.”
“Don’t,” Steve almost snarled his interruption before he sighed deeply. There was some more rustling and some metallic clanking, but Tony didn’t bother looking up to see what was happening. “Don’t say that. They’re not going to get you again. The team will come, sweetheart, you’ll see.”
Steve’s smile was blinding, soft and sweet and gentle and entirely too beautiful for Tony’s heart to not explode. Before Steve could give an answer, Tony continued.
Tony wanted to scream out his answer, to yell and to cry and to get down on his knees. Of course he still loved his husband. Without Steve, he had nothing. He
“Oh, God. Please don’t call me that.” Steve hadn’t needed further proof that Tony had actually seen his profile, but that would have been the convincer. The last-minute decision to include his college football photo had clearly been a mistake, if Tony’s wink was anything to go by. Halfway out of his chair, Steve hovered a bit awkwardly. “Can I help you with that? I can grab a bag.”
Tony grinned, fingers tightening on the phone when Steve’s voice dropped a little. “I don’t know. Depends what time you go to bed.”
“No, mom,” Tony said, moodily kicking at the bottom stair, the marble cold even through his sock. “I know. I just thought, because of it being Chris–”
Tony looked up from the pot and over to Peter, hovering in the doorway with his arms wrapped round himself. He looked young, so much younger than he was. “You’re meant to be resting.”
Tony cut himself off with a sharp inhale and threw his head back. “Well. You were there when it fell through. I guess I thought me staying in the office longer and longer was making things easier. Stopping us from snapping at each other at home.”
. A whole little person living inside of him, ready to grow and stretch and make his body do all kinds of weird things. Nine months of his baby inside of him and then eighteen years of them living in Tony’s house.
“Not that kind of elf,” Steve shouted over his shoulder as he headed off, ducking his head again at the wink Tony shot him.
He felt like a broken record. He’d been telling himself the same thing since it had happened. Saying it in the mirror, telling the tiles in the shower before he went to bed, even whispering it into the darkness of a silent hospital room.
Jarvis hadn’t even seemed that old. Tony supposed that he must have been, but he was always so youthful in Tony’s eyes. Maybe that was because he was forever running around after a mischievous Tony and that was bound to keep someone young and fit.
There would be kisses, tears, desperate hugs where Steve would let out a shaky breath saying how much he’d missed Tony and Tony would give him an equally trembling promise of never doing it again.
“I have school work,” he said as neutrally as he could. “And I go back right after New Year. I just thought you would be–”
“I don’t think so.” Steve scratched his stomach and rolled his neck, drawing Tony’s eyes to his body, flickering between the two spots as he tried to take in as much as he could. “Not even sure how I got back here.”
“You gave yourself an out,” Tony answered quietly, bracketing his arms on the back of his chair and falling forward. He shook his head harshly, standing up and crossing the room towards the door.
But what if Steve was meant to ring back? He let out a loud groan and threw his hands up, heels digging into his eyes hard enough to see swirling patterns of random colours. Why was everything so damn hard?
When Peter scurried over to Steve and held up his mug with a hopeful smile, Tony met Steve’s gaze over his head. Who on earth was the man in front of him, who spoke so kindly to kids and apparently volunteered to dress up in a bright green elf costume to chop down Christmas trees in the snow? He was someone that Tony wanted to get to know, someone that he wanted to talk to for hours at a time and learn every secret that Steve had to share.
The grin he got in return was wonderfully happy and free in a way Tony hadn’t seen anyone look for a long time. Ducking his head, he took another sip of his hot chocolate. He usually hated sweet drinks, but Steve could make a mean mug of coco, clearly.
Biting down on his smile, Tony swung his and Peter’s hands. “I think so, kid. Must mean they’re Santa’s very own trees. How cool is that?”
By the time the afternoon of Christmas Eve rolled round, all Steve could think about was the mulled wine he had waiting at his new apartment and the box of DVDs he’d found when he’d been packing up to move.
There was a lump in Tony’s throat, but he did his best to swallow around it. He could do it. This was only the beginning, after all. He had an extremely long way to go until the end of the pregnancy, and then of course there was the whole problem of actually having a child.
He had put up a little bit of tinsel by the door and there was a garland over the fireplace, but, Peter was right.
With every word, Tony’s eyebrows lifted higher. “Right,” he said slowly. A small smile started to creep onto his face. “Thanks for the recommendation.”
Steve laughed and Tony pressed his lips together at the sound. He wanted to hear nothing but that every day for the rest of his life.
of all places. It probably hadn’t even been created to be a Christmas decoration, but all it had needed was a piece of string threaded through its top and it was perfect for them.
Steve’s grip tightened on his arm and Tony let himself be pulled back into Steve’s embrace, his arm sliding back round Tony’s waist and holding him tight.
“There is actually something I wanted to talk to you about,” Tony started, wincing as he tried to roll his shoulders into a more comfortable position. It was nigh-on-impossible, what with how long he’d been forced into the stance, and Tony dropped his head back as he resigned himself to his fate.
Steve didn’t know what to say. He knew it must have shown on his face and could feel himself flushing, panicked and embarrassed all at once. What were the odds of swiping left on someone literally sat behind him?
He was rewarded with a high-pitched squeal, which gave way to a wonderful laugh that Tony hadn’t heard since he’d picked his son up.
“He’s a pest,” Tony shot back, but the smile on his face and the way that he reached out to run his hand through Peter’s hair told a different story. “He likes you.”
It was hard to hear much with the wind whipping around his ears and the Christmas music still playing through the speakers and projecting across the lot, but Tony fell quiet and waited. Just as he was about to speak again, he heard something.
“Yeah. I guess I was. I hope I didn’t do anything stupid. I was not in a good place yesterday.” Steve’s smile faltered a little bit and he cleared his throat. “Thanks for bringing me home.”
It wasn’t a romantic declaration by any stretch, but it was something. With Tony’s soft smile and Peter’s laugh echoing in his ear, it was enough for Steve.
“Welcome!” Peter chirped happily. Turning back to Tony, Peter shook his head. “No more, thank you. I wanna colour.”
When Peter had spent days trying to tell himself that he was never going to hear his dad’s voice again, even hearing it angry and hissed was wonderful. It surrounded him like a wave, occasional words breaking through the haze but none of them registering too deeply.
,” Tony continued and Steve slid his hands under his thighs to stop himself from reaching out for the phone. He didn’t know if he would delete the recording or press redial.
Neither could Steve, he thought incredulously. He wouldn’t have admitted the small wave of thrill that he got from Tony’s confession to anyone, but he felt it. It was probably sadistic of him, but the feeling was especially strong when Tony’s voice broke as he spoke. Steve got a tiny rush of something from just knowing that he did actually have some effect on the other man, an effect that he had not known he had had when they had been together.
Cookies were a staple in Tony’s recipe book. There were many different varieties, so many tweaks that could be made to each batch to make a different cookie type for any occasion.
Steve flushed and looked back to the small TV screen where names were still rolling. He felt a little awkward, as though he should have gone back to his assigned seat. Right up until he’d finally succumbed to more sleep, Peter had had a hand on Steve’s leg and, despite the boy not knowing if he was still there or not, Steve felt a strange sort of loyalty to stay right where Peter had asked him to be.
“Steve?” Nurse Rogers said, her voice light as she took the wand away from Tony’s stomach and turned back to her station.
Peter could hardly see an inch of his dad’s skin that wasn’t covered with either a bandage or a dark mark of some description, be it red or blue or a mottled sort of green. He reached out without much thought and took his dad’s hand in his, holding it gently and trying not to cause any more pain. Without pausing his argument with Steve, Tony gripped Peter’s fingers and stroked his thumb over the back of Peter’s hand.
Steve nodded. They’d had a pilot’s announcement that they weren’t far out of the airport and Steve really wasn’t sure he was ready to let the Starks go. After his small bribe to wake Peter up with the promise of breakfast, the boy had fallen back to sleep against Tony’s chest and Steve couldn’t take his eyes off him.
“I want to.” It took a momentous effort for Tony to lift his head and look over at Steve, their eyes locking together almost instantly. “I want to ask you and I want to hear you say yes.”
No one should have ever been made to feel as if they would be rejected or discriminated purely because of who was the most special thing in their life.
Of course Tony knew that. He knew everything about Steve. Of course he knew how big a deal that evening’s gala was. Which is why he had decided to give Steve an edge. A little something to make him look forward to the end of the night.
would get here soon. It was already full-dark and it was getting a bit cold. Maybe he should just go wait inside the car?
act anymore. He tried really hard, then looked around the table at their knowing expressions, and shrugged. “So, change up the rules. Winner discards a piece of clothes.”
as good. Second place to Tony’s first. Steve, almost naked with his four of a kind, looked disappointed. Tony just shrugged. “Guess you get me, Tinkerbell.”
“Tempting,” Tony agreed, giving the plug a little tug. It slid out a few centimeters before stopping at the flared base. The older man didn’t seem to mind that at all, just working the plug slightly forward and back, not pulling hard enough to tug it
Tony flipped Clint the bird under the table, grabbing at Clint’s thighs as the cock brushed past his tongue and began to press even deeper. Tony gagged a little, his eyes watering, but he was proud of how good he was at this. Maybe Thor could pick up his magic hammer and Clint could thread a needle with an arrow, but Tony had spent years perfecting his ability to deepthroat.
, Tony.” But the laughter had done the job and Thor’s second finger was inside him as well. Four fingers would be plenty preparation if it was just Thor fucking him, but if Steve was really going to take them both, more was a good idea. Clint
, taking myself and the man of iron,” he warned Steve, but he also sounded pleased. “It will be a feat. One of courage and resilience.”
Clint stared down at him like he was out of his mind, picked up his cards, and threw them down on the table. “Fold!”
“Tony Stark,” returned the man in the suit without reaching back. Walking up to the car, Tony gave it a look-over. “Not bad. Pretty.” Then he looked back at Steve and smiled, long and hard. Full of intent. Steve shivered and it didn’t have much to do with the cold. It had been over a month since he’d been with his lover. He and Natasha were just back from an undercover mission, and he was feeling deeply skin-hungry. There had been some opportunities for Steve to practice the modern art of sexting, but it wasn’t the same as actually being touched.
, and the lights were unchanged. Aroused, but also concerned now, Clint pulled the fingers back out, stroked himself off, and came on Tony's come-smeared ass with a happy little sigh. He didn't bother going back to the couch this time, not while Thor was fucking Tony's mouth hard enough to rock his body and Steve was absently jerking himself off one-handed while drinking his beer. Few more tally marks.
things to him. He got out of the car without arguing and took off the shorts, leaving them on the ground while Tony unlatched the hood, settling it back in place. “Get over here and put both your hands on the hood. All you get to say now is ‘please, sir’ and ‘more, sir.’ Okay, baby?”
“Do it,” Clint insisted. “Or we jerk ourselves off and leave you to handle this-” He ran his fingers across Steve’s erection. “-by yourself.”
Face pressed into the cushions, Steve was definitely crying. It was disturbing. Steve got hurt a lot. Crying wasn't something Tony had ever seen him do. Thor, erect and big enough to make even Steve look slight, sat by the side of the couch while Tony stared, hands twitching. "Perhaps that is enough for today," he heard Thor murmur. "You have done very well. Another day, we might-"
Steve was still begging Clint, and when Clint grunted, eyes rolling up, losing his rhythm, Steve made a disappointed little noise, hips thrusting back like he could make the fucking last longer by sheer will.
Thor got down on the ground next to the couch, leaning back against it and stretching out his legs, and set Steve down in his lap, his cock sticking up obscenely between Steve's legs, Steve's cock pressed up against Thor's abs. "Are you in pain?"
Tony glanced up at him, mouth still full of cock, curious. Had he missed Steve winning the last round? Clint shook his head and demanded, “Thor deal me in. I’m doing this hand blind. I’m… a little busy.”
against Thor’s thigh, humping the Argadian prince like a dog, desperate. From a finger in the ass and Tony’s dirty mouth. Steve Rogers was a fucking treasure.
Steve drew up alongside Thor to look through the beer choices, pulled out a bottle, and popped it open with his fingers. Show off. Then again, Thor was starting to make the whole bar tremble with how hard he was fucking Stark, so it wasn’t like Steve as the
Clint’s thighs trembled, and his hands gentled from Tony’s head down to his neck, petting at Tony’s skin while Clint chanted, “Oh god, fuck, yeah,” in a nasal midwestern twang that hinted he right on the edge.
He could just make out the sound of bets. He waited until he heard Clint inhale to speak before he sucked the first couple inches of Barton’s cock into his mouth, just to enjoy the way it made his voice squeak up. Barton had a nice cock: big enough to be a mouthful without giving Tony a sore jaw, and curved in a way that Tony swore just made him slip down the throat without Tony needing to really work at it.
There was a moment of blank staring, and then Steve started to laugh, his whole body shaking with it. “
hardly covered it. Clint clinked his bottle to Thor’s stein and Thor drained his drink, then swiped at his mouth. “I will endeavor to continue to please.” Getting to his feet, Thor handed off the stein to Steve. “Will you do me the favor, friend Steven, of filling this while I take my pleasure?”
“You do,” Tony agreed, popping the plug out the rest of the way and then plunging his cock into Steve with a single stroke. It drove the breath from Steve’s lungs, but the big plug really had done its work, making Steve's passage so wide and slick that Tony slid right into him with one slam of his hips. When Tony was all the way in, he paused a moment, stroking Steve’s cock languidly. “I didn’t forget that you want to come on my cock,” he said smugly. “I have to wonder if you can come untouched. Just from this.” He began to pump his hips in and out, slowly building up a faster rhythm, each one ending deep and a little rough. Tony’s hand settled under his thigh, lifting one of Steve’s legs up so his foot settled on the Lincoln's fender, spreading him even wider.
from the sword-swallowing with Barton. He knew that he already looked and sounded ravaged, and he liked the way it made the others look at him like they were considering how to get
There was an annoyed huff from Steve that Tony could hear even under the table. “You guys cheat.” But his chair pushed back and Tony reached up to get a hand from Clint so he could get to his feet. He wanted to watch. There was a very real pleasure to watching Steve strip down. Steve had those slender hips that barely held his underwear up, but he always took forever getting his briefs down from his hips to his thighs, like he wasn’t eager to get fucked. Like there wasn’t an enormous bulge where his erection stretched the fabric.
Then Clint strode up, smacked Steve hard across the ass and asked, “How we going to do this?” His erection had barely faded, even if it was no longer spit-shiny.
Steve shook his head like he wasn’t sure or didn’t want to say, but Thor kept touching his face and chest and finally Steve added, “Could you… pretend you’re taking pictures?” Was the guy psychic? Or did he just know Tony that well? Steve sounded deeply embarrassed, like he thought they would make fun of him for being a little kinky. As though a little healthy kink wasn’t at the center of their ‘male bonding’ nights.
while he yanked at ears and hair, his hips rising up off his chair. He wasn’t just riding Tony’s face: he was savaging his mouth hard enough that Tony was having a hard time breathing, his nose slammed repeatedly into Clint’s pubic bone, his throat spasming around Clint’s cock. But like hell was Tony going to tap out. He could suck
Clint pulled out his thumb, then he and Thor collaborated for a moment in holding Steve open wide and filling him full of lube straight from the bottle. Steve’s thighs went rigid, probably from the cold, but he didn’t try to pull away. “Together?” Clint asked Thor.
noise. They moved around him efficiently, taking off the cuffs and spreader while Steve did his best to clean up Tony's beard with the facial wipes that smelled like cucumbers. Tony was still almost alarmingly passive. Not normal for him at all. Thor scooped Tony up and carried him to the couch. It would probably leave a bit of a mess, but Clint didn't give a shit about Tony's cleaning bill right now.
Clint helped him up, off Thor’s lap, into a standing position. Only then did Clint pull out. He gave Steve’s ass a hard slap, then kissed his shoulder. “You want more pictures?” Steve hesitated and Clint leaned into him. “You want to demand I don’t take any?” Steve couldn’t have gone any more pink than he already was, but he looked shy, maybe even a little ashamed of himself. Tony wanted to smack the hell out of whoever made Steve feel like he wasn’t allowed to
“I didn’t hear the magic word,” Tony pointed out. No stoplight code, no safeword, Clint was going to keep pushing. Tony had some big ideas for what he was going to do with Steve the next time he got the man alone.
Clint sat up higher and Thor got that competitive grin. Tony could have told them he was a genius. Even Steve seemed that bit more activated and Tony was pretty sure Steve had been hard since they sat down. “Alright!” Clint reached for the deck, shuffling it again without anyone asking him to, before dealing the cards. “Gentlemen, place your bets!”
Steve looked like he was resisting the urge to rip the ring gag right off of Tony’s mouth, but Tony had made it damn clear that this was exactly what he wanted, so the blond was hanging around, not interfering. He hadn’t promised to
Tony looked weirdly vulnerable for a moment, but then he breathed in and his expression flattened out, all smirk and smarm. "I can take anything you throw at me, Barton."
Regretfully, Clint looked at the port on the wall he thought of as Jarvis and said, "Mute the game." This had been fun, but Clint was pulling the plug. He wasn't sure Tony if had the self-preservation instincts left to stop them if they really
They chatted about quarters and quarterback spikes and Clint wondered how many more tallies they could fit on Stark before the game ended or Tony called mercy.
“But when the Panthers hit someone in the face…” Thor protested. Clint knew the guy was just playing
But Tony purred, “That’s beautiful.” And then he pulled Steve’s shorts down in one go, pushing him further down over the engine. Steve caught himself on the block, gasping at the cool air on his cock and ass. He hadn’t been wearing any underwear and he knew exactly what Tony was seeing. “
Steve didn’t waste a moment. He kneed forward and reached for Tony’s cock, sucking in the first few inches immediately, bobbing and twisting his head to really work it with his lips and tongue. It was the kind of wet, enthusiastic blowjob you only got from someone who seriously loved what he was doing. Tony let him have at it for a few minutes, then started to push down on the back of Steve’s head, forcing him lower, making him take more. Steve stopped bobbing his head and let Tony take over, letting him shove at Steve’s head with both hands while he thrust his hips up, fucking Steve’s mouth without trying to be nice about it. Each thrust of his hips shoved Steve’s lips all the way down to Tony’s fly and jammed Tony’s cock into his throat.  But Steve had learned to relax, how to just let his jaw and throat relax. His lips grew wet as spit pooled and dripped out, but he could feel Tony’s cock in so deep it felt like he was halfway down Steve’s throat.
Steve didn’t tug at the white shorts, no matter how self-conscious he felt. He’d worn stranger things, but he still felt self conscious as he leaned his hip against the big two-toned car. The 1978 Lincoln Continental was part of a distant future when he’d… gone away, and now it was
Steve made a wounded noise and Tony smiled as he realized that Steve wasn't just squirming, but actively
The rhythm broke and there was warmth as Tony came inside him, filling his ass with seed, but he didn’t pull out just yet. Instead, Tony just ground his hips in deep and stroked Steve hard and fast, working his cock until Steve was almost face down on the hood. He came in Tony’s fist with a soft groan, and stayed there, crouching over the cool metal, catching his breath while Tony pulled out. The sudden emptiness was strange, almost uncomfortable, and he could feel a little come trickling out. Tony wiped his own come-smeared palm off on Steve’s ass. “I’m buying the car,” he announced. "There’s more than enough money in the briefcase to cover it.”
Thor was looking a little bored, and Clint had sniper-face on, so Tony decided to do what he always did: push. “I raise.” They all perked up. Tony preened, in his element. “Whoever wins this round gets to blow second place.”
pulling out the plug. It caught on his inner rim, his body fighting the width of that flared base. Steve held very still, not spoiling it, and Tony positioned the plug exactly where the widest part kept holding Steve open. It hurt a little, but in a good way, and he fought not to move his hips, letting his head sink between his shoulders. Tony was a complete bastard in the best way possible. “Please, sir,” Steve said obediently. “I need more.”
Steve slowly straightened up to see Tony, already tucked back into his well-fitted suit, getting into the car with a scrap of white fabric in his hand. Tony grinned at him from behind the sunglasses and held it up for a moment. “Souvenir,” he explained. “Don’t worry, I’ll let my friends know where you are.” With that, the engine turned over and Tony drove off, leaving Steve half-naked in a parking lot with come slowly dripping down his thighs.
Tony pushed Steve's shirt up his back, bunching it in one fist before pressed his clothed erection against Steve’s ass and miming a few good thrusts. Steve thrust his ass back, desperately hopeful that it really was as dark and remote here as he thought it was. “How am I supposed to turn down something like that?” Tony agreed. A hard smack to Steve’s ass and Tony said, “Yeah, let’s get in that car. You can show me the back seat.”
“Shut up,” Clint said companionably, gripped Tony by the hair, and demanded, “Thor, you deal the cards. You’ve seen me do it.” That said, Clint shifted Tony back down. “I want you to take me all the way. Think you can do that?”
,” Tony purred, running his fingers over the sizable plug that was stretching Steve open. It was bright red and had taken a lot of lube and patience to get in. Tonight, Steve had been trying to keep his back to the car so it wouldn’t be obvious. But Tony clearly liked what he was seeing. He started happily smacking Steve's ass cheeks to make them jiggle and stretching them apart to get a better look at the plug. “You wear that for me?” he teased. “I thought I was just buying the car. Didn’t realize I was getting
“That,” Clint said, gesturing with a bottle of water, “is the fucking sexiest thing I have ever seen.”
“I would be very pleased,” Thor agreed. He had a hand on Steve’s face now, stroking his jaw and touching his lips. Tony wanted to take pictures. He wanted to film this so he could rub off to it the next time he left New York on SI business. “What else?”
Despite the threat, though, he kept his hand on Steve’s cock and Steve rocked his hips into the fucking. Perfectly aware of just how slutty it made him look, Steve worked himself back onto Tony’s cock and forward against his hand, needing both. “Please, sir,” he said again. He was getting what he needed, but sometimes it felt good to beg.
"Not yet," Steve groaned, like he couldn't bear the idea of not being stretched impossibly full of cock. Tony bit his cheek, demanding his body hold on a little longer. He could give Steve a good fucking if that was what Steve needed.
Steve nodded, moving to the hood, breaths a touch fast. He spread his thighs wide like Tony suggested as he bend over, chest resting on the cold metal. “Yes, sir.”
They all stared at him. “You want a turn on the bottom?” Steve asked, sounding both surprised and a little concerned, like maybe he’d been keeping Clint (who was the toppiest top who ever topped in Tony’s experience) from having his day licking their balls and bending over for their cocks.
As soon as Steve wandered off, Thor flipped Tony around like he weighed nothing. With Tony on his back, Thor soon straddling his face on his knees so he could continue to watch the game while fucking Tony’s mouth. All Clint could see was Thor’s ass, Tony’s tally-marked forehead, and the guy’s glazed eyes. Tony was clearly slipping deep into subspace. This scene had been, theoretically, for Clint’s sake, but clearly he wasn’t the only one who got their bells chimed here.
Tony get off just on being fucked, but he bet it could happen. Stark always acted like Rogers’ horse cock was made of distilled magic.
to finish undressing, forcing himself not to be hide the arc reactor; everyone here had seen it before anyway. He looked up as Steve squeaked. From the movement of Clint’s arm, he’d started opening Steve up in earnest. Steve’s lips were a little open, breathing hard as any other mortal in bed, and he was gripping Thor’s leg almost frantically. He looked slutty and beautiful.
“Yes, I can tell that much,” Tony said witheringly. He held the piece of metal up and Steve swallowed when he noticed that it wasn’t even shiny enough to catch the light as it was thrust forward. “What I would like to know is why it is in your sock drawer and not on my finger?”
He hadn’t seen the outside of the medical centre for days. Maybe even a week. He’d stopped counting when they’d made it to three days and Tony hadn’t woken up. Bucky had been in with clean clothes and Steve had managed to have washes in the sinks of the bathroom. It wasn’t ideal, but there was no way on any earth that Steve was taking a single step towards the exit without his husband’s hand in his.
Without tearing his eyes away from Steve’s, Tony dropped his keys somewhere to his left, where he vaguely knew there was a table ready and waiting.
“You had someone, though,” Tony said, turning away again to read – but not absorb – a poster about the important of washing one’s hands after an injection. “You weren’t alone.”
The gel was just as cold on his stomach as Tony had always heard it would be. He winced involuntarily at the chill and Nurse Rogers looked up with a rue smile.
“Did you change your mind?” There was a moment of utter panic before Tony spoke again, words even louder with more force. “Was – was it for someone else?”
At that point, Tony would even take a bedtime story if it just meant that he could feel Jarvis next to him for five more minutes. But that was impossible and, soon, Tony would be forgotten again.
,” Tony spoke again. He went quiet for a moment and the sounds of the bar behind him got louder until there was a deep sigh. “
He’d put it off, knowing what he was going to find. And sure enough, there were countless messages, though luckily none of them had made it into the group chat.
And that was an answer in itself. Tony let his head fall back once more, giving in to his protesting muscles as they screamed out for rest.
so large – hand on Peter’s back. “No, they’re not going to take him away. They just need to take him out of the tree, yeah? It’s not safe for him to be here alone and he can’t stay here in case someone takes the tree home – like you!”
“Well, I don’t need mistletoe to kiss your Da,” Steve started, backing away from Tony slowly. Ducking his head, Tony tried to hide his grin. He knew where Steve was going and couldn’t believe that Peter couldn’t see anything coming after so many years of living with Steve. “Just like I don’t need mistletoe to kiss you!”
No one could blame him really – or at least that’s what he told himself. After all, it wasn’t every day that one lost their virginity to the captain of the college’s football team, was it? Tony was utterly giddy about it; still riding the high of his first other-person-present orgasm and the idea of actually having a boyfriend for the first time.
“What?” Tony’s head was spinning. Maybe he hadn’t actually woken up? He hadn't slept in a while, after all. Perhaps it was all some sort of dream or a very vivid hallucination. “Steve, you’re not making any sense.”
“Oh, darling.” Peggy squeezed Sarah even harder, as though trying to mould their bodies together. “Is he coming back?”
Tony didn’t even try to hide emotion he felt, letting his face show what his heart was telling him for once, as he threw himself across the room and into Steve’s waiting arms.
Tony looked down the duffel open on his bed and sighed. He stayed quiet as Rhodey finished checking his bags and grabbed his phone, unplugging his charger and throwing it in his jacket pocket.
“On the counter,” Tony said, arching his eyebrow at Steve’s narrowed eyes. “Where you leave mine most mornings.”
Sarah watched the young man walk out of her examination room, his hands tightly clutching a stack of pamphlets to his chest as though they were a lifeline. He’d been a lovely man. Clearly scared, but also determined to do things right.
Of course Steve didn’t want to admit it. He could feel his blood boiling as it coursed through his veins, taking with it searing-hot anger. He was surprised that his skin wasn’t a bright red or that it didn’t hurt to touch.
He lost himself in his thoughts for a moment, only realise that he’d been silent for so long when he heard his nurse speak again.
Peter’s fingers were tiny on Steve’s leg. They tapped out a wild rhythm even as his eyes slipped closed, fighting sleep. Steve found that he couldn’t look away from the way Peter’s head drooped onto Tony’s stomach, how his curls fell onto his forehead with the movement.
Tony sighed and flicked Peter on his cold nose. “Alright, alright. But give me a cuddle, hey? Give me some warmth.”
Who was going to chase after him now? There would be no pushback when Tony stole a fresh cookie from the cooling rack, or no playful eye rolls when Tony ‘borrowed’ Jarvis’s apron for his experiments. It wasn’t a nice thought.
“I can see it, kid,” Tony said, grinning up at Peter on Steve’s hip as he reached out to hang the owl just below the star right at the top. “Looks great.”
“I’d call that adding hot water to powder. But,” he added just as Tony started seething, “I will admit that you learnt well. Your hot chocolate is the best I’ve ever had.”
It was always the middle of the tree the drew Tony’s eye. To some people, it might have been very odd to have so many ornaments for parents, but it was their family. There were two gingerbread people holding hands with
Though the message started simply enough, even that single word was enough to bring Steve to his knees. God, that
Tony opened his mouth and promptly closed it, all semblance of thought leaving him. His head was spinning and he really wasn’t sure if any of it was real.
Tony reached out and fisted his hands into Steve’s sweater, yanking the man down until their mouths could press together. The kiss was long and languid, lips moving against the other's like they'd done it a hundred times before. It was slow and soft, with no need to rush. Tony had wanted it for so long that he didn’t feel any need to make things move any faster, wanting instead to bask in what he'd always wanted.
Steve barely even registered the automated voice talking him through his options once again. His mind was elsewhere, a thousand miles away.
“I couldn’t not let him be here,” Steve said, voice low but firm. It was soft in the way that it always was when Steve addressed Tony, a way that never failed to make Peter warm inside. Now, though, he was cold all over. “
Gone. Jarvis was gone. The only person that had ever made Tony feel as though he had a family was gone. Lying in the ground, somewhere deep beneath the earth that Tony stood on.
Even when hoarse and broken, Peter loved Tony’s voice. He hadn’t realised just how much until he’d only been able to hear it through old recordings and videos with Tony behind the camera.
“No,” Tony said dismissively, turning back to the counter and peering at the unbaked pie on the side. “I think it needs more salt
“I – are you… I don’t, don’t.” Peter was stumped. His fingers started tapping out commands and coordinates almost on autopilot as he sat in shock. There was another small explosion and the sounds of hand-to-hand combat filled his ears. It was a weird sort of symphony; one that would never sell out concert halls, but was oddly comforting to Peter all the same. “Okay. Maybe this isn’t the best time to have this conversation.”
“Yes,” Steve muttered, not finding anything about the situation amusing. He was desperate then and he’d been desperate ever since. Completely and hopelessly full of yearning to stay with Tony for the rest of their lives. All he’d ever wanted was Tony by his side, to have Tony married to him and sharing one home forever. He had wanted to be able to provide for Tony and to give him the best of everything.
With a loud growl, Steve threw his cold coffee into the trashcan by the door and headed for the small garden at the back of the medical centre. He barely paid attention to his surroundings as he thrust his shaking hand into his pocket and pulled out a packet of cigarettes.
Tony’s hand spasmed around Steve’s shoulder and his other arm gave way, body collapsing further into Steve’s embrace.
Snorting into her mug, May nodded. “Not half. And you didn’t even have him as a baby. It was worse then, believe me. Just about every toy he had lit up or played music.”
“Just the usual group night out. There were too many shots, too much dancing and far too much food. Sam got wasted and crashed pretty early. Bucky drew all over his face – I’m pretty sure it was in Sharpie, so it’ll probably still be on him this morning.”
His answer was a kissing sound followed by a dial tone. He let the phone fall from his hand, watching it swing from its long chord instead of replacing it in its cradle. It wasn’t as though she would call again anyway, and Tony didn’t feel like speaking to anyone else. It would be quiet through to New Year.
“You don’t sound all that upset,” Tony mused. He knew he wasn’t a patch on Natasha, but he did actually like the photo someone had taken of the two of them at Natasha’s last work gala. Maybe there was hope.
Damn Steve for being thoughtful enough to make them all something, Tony thought. It was bad enough that he was
“See you back here in four weeks. Go out to reception and there’ll make your next appointment. Any questions?”
Peggy’s arms tightened around Sarah’s shoulder and a kiss was dropped to her hair. “You’re not going to tell–”
And that was exactly the moment that Tony finally realised he wasn’t going to be forgotten ever again.
Peter nodded as best he could between the seats, faux leather squeaking. “She’s the best. So, read me?”
Though Tony and Steve had only been dating for a few months at that point, Tony had known it was as serious as he would ever get and he couldn’t have stopped himself from snatching the last owl on the shelf as a yearly reminder if his life had depended on it. As soon as he’d shown Peter, the boy had very nearly bounced right out of his skin and had set about making a small Santa hat to fit on its head.
“Well.” Steve swallowed. Should he not have asked? Was that rude? He couldn’t tell a toddler from a seven-year-old most of the time, but who knew if that was offensive to parents. “I did.”
Tony walked into the room, one slow move at a time as Steve stood up from the couch to meet him halfway. When he was close enough, Tony slid his hands up Steve’s chest and around his neck, stepping even closer until they were pressed head to toe.
The only thing holding him back was the question of would Tony actually come back if Steve told him that he loved him too?
“Good,” Tony said, resting a hand on Peter’s back for a moment and then straightening his hat. God, he was clucky, he realised with a laugh. “Come on, then.”
As soon as the words left Tony’s mouth, he realised what he’d said. Home. It wasn’t home. The grin started to dim before Steve slid his hand under Tony’s blazer and pinched his side lightly.
“Guess you were drunker than you thought you were,” Tony chuckled weakly. “I tried to tidy up but I have no idea what you did after I went to bed. Looks like you had your own private party.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, walking into the room and standing by the table. “The exhibition for your new product. It was last night?”
Tony bit back a curse. “For sure,” he said. “I’ve taken the tests, but I knew. Even without coming here.” He looked down at his lap, picking at the skin around his nails. “You just know, you know?”
“Oh. Right.” Tony shook his head, blinking a few more times to try and focus. “I wanted to talk to you. I’ve been, been trying for ages and I couldn’t find a good, a decent time.”
Too careful, sometimes. For a stupid, brief moment, Tony almost contemplated asking for the guy’s name and maybe making Natasha reconsider. It was time for her to meet someone and Tony could vouch for the guy, in a weird sort of way.
Actually, it was a surprise. He’d thought that Tony and his son had already boarded a different plane… oh. That probably hadn’t been true and more of a gentle lie on Tony’s part to save Steve’s face from permanently resembling a tomato.
Luckily Tony seemed to get what Steve was trying to say. “No,” he said with a weak smile. “He lives with May. Not really sure how viable that is forever, but I was only contacted after the accident. Anyway, I wasn’t really ready to be a dad immediately and things were, I guess you’d say stilted. For the start, anyway. It was difficult then and there’s a lot of years to fit into a few months.”
Nurse Rogers smiled at Tony over her shoulder. “I think that would be lovely, Tony. Three copies coming up.”
The laugh that Tony let out was loud and bright, far too much for the early hour. He buried his face in Steve’s chest as he continued to chuckle, feeling Steve’s body shaking beneath him with his own amusement.
“Who raised you to be so polite, hey?” Tony huffed jokingly, bouncing Peter on his hip. He wasn’t used to the weight of a child in his arms, but it was something he knew he could get accustomed to very quickly. That and hearing Peter say
Steve coughed to clear his throat and tried to move the conversation away in a vain attempt to calm his burning cheeks and rapidly-beating heart. “Why were you even in my sock drawer?”
“Mhm,” Tony murmured, fisting his hands in Steve’s frankly-hideous Christmas sweater to tug him close. “I can call my spouse whatever I want.”
“Look at this one!” Peter stopped and tugged at Tony’s hand. The tree he’d halted by was nearly ten times his size and a bright green.
“Yes, we’re sorry about that. It’s all to do with masking waves, which is why it has to be cold, but why no one has invented a way to make it work at room temperature, I’ll never know.”
“Hey,” Nurse Rogers said and Tony looked up at her. “We trust you, okay? It’s ultimately up to you what you do throughout your pregnancy. Only you know what your baby needs. As long as you follow the broad rules and listen to your doctor, then we’re going to have ourselves a wonderfully easy pregnancy and a perfectly healthy little one.”
“Get off me, you brute,” Tony said, batting at Steve’s chest. The quirk of his lips gave away how he actually felt about Steve’s hand roaming over his arse and, judging by the lift of Steve’s eyebrow, he knew it too. “I need to finish getting dressed.”
Tony stood up, pushing his chair away from the table with a hideous screech across the tiled floor. “Nope. Cover everything off on your own. Steve can have it all.” He turned to his lawyer, trying his hardest to ignore the way his voice had cracked on his husband’s name. Ex-husband’s name. “I’m going to find a decent cup of coffee. Call me when it’s done.”
Pregnant. Having-a-baby sort of pregnant. Not that there was any other way to be pregnant, but still. It was real. Definitely and a thousand percent real.
A small laugh left Tony. “No. Only one. He’s more than enough for me. I didn’t… people don’t normally ask.”
The cell was clearly deep underground, or at least reinforced a ridiculous number of times with a ridiculous number of metals to make it impossible to escape. There was a single vent at the top of the wall with the door on it, only big enough to allow air into the cell and presumably the noise of Steve and Tony’s conversations to travel back out. It wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility for there to be a little something extra in the air flowing through the vent, as Tony never used to fall asleep as easily when at home in a real bed as he did in a dark and dingy cell.
Peter couldn't even remember why he'd said it, anymore. They must have been arguing. Now that he was older, Peter and Tony had gotten quite good at arguing, at disagreeing with nearly everything the other did. Steve tried to act as a middle man between them, but even he struggled to keep the peace sometimes. It wasn't unusual for Peter to yell in anger, though it was uncommon for him to speak without thinking. And he must have done when he let those words pass his lips.
Pulling his hand back up between them, Tony revealed that his pocket-square was actually a pair of black, lacy panties. There was a whitish stain streaked all the way across the front of them and a couple of larger patches right over the crotch.
“Okay, yes, I remember. Christ. Don’t say it again.” Tony grabbed Peter’s wrist and tugged with as much strength as he had – which wasn’t much. “Obviously I’m the most amazing dad in the world.”
Steve’s head shot up, mouth open and eyes wide, before he caught sight of the wicked grin on Tony’s face and rolled his eyes, fighting off his own smile as he sank back down.
, Rhodey would say with a grin. Whatever word he was, he certainly wasn’t the sort of person to stand by his phone and check it every three seconds in case he’d missed a notification.
Steve had rehearsed his first words in his head for days. The rare moments of sleep that he’d managed to catch had given him dreams with ample variants of Tony’s awakening.
Steve laughed and stepped away, blowing on his hands. He needed to either take shelter for a moment or hold something warm else he risked his fingers falling off. “Come on, Ramsay. Hot chocolate waits for no man. Let me show you my secrets.”
Things were already feeling a little different, though. It might have been the bruises on the column of his throat, or the small spring in his step.
Despite Rhodey’s warnings and Tony’s inexperience, one thing had very quickly led to another between Ty and Tony.
“I never stopped loving you, Tony. I will never stop loving you. None of this was ever about that, I swear. It was – I don’t know what it was. I wanted you to have the freedom, wanted you to be able to–”
It was fear, more than anything. Steve couldn’t handle being scared, couldn’t handle that thought of not being in control or not knowing what was happening. It was easier to get mad, to shout and let his voice turn to steel instead of wobbling with panic.
“But I love you.” Steve’s voice was husky as sleep pulled him back under. “Wouldn’t ever want anyone else.”
Steve startled at the sudden comment from the row of chairs behind him and turned around. He’d been passing the time in the airport lounge by swiping through
Just walking, Tony could see signs for all sorts of different varieties. There were no-needle-drop ones, a Fir Christmas tree – which Tony had rather thought was every type of Christmas tree – and around seven different kinds of Spruce. Which was he meant to get? What even was the difference? In his opinion, a tree was a tree was a tree.
The room was empty and white with cheap plastic chairs that squeaked on the bleached floor. There were posters covering every available wall, stuck up with cheap tape. Some had probably been bright once upon a time, but were now faded from the sun streaming through open windows. Others were ripped and curling up at the edges, hiding whatever words were printed on the bottom inch.
Tony licked his lips and flattened his hand over his bellybutton, fingers splayed. “About his child.”
Turning back to his drinks, Tony laughed when he heard a cackling scream from the direction of the living room that could only have come from Peter.
Steve didn’t do kids. He never had. They were confusing and loud and Steve always felt on edge when he spoke to them, like either they or their parents were judging him. They were also so small. Steve towered above his friends on any regular day, so he felt like a giant when he was next to small children.
Some of them had animals that Tony had never, ever seen, not even at the big zoo. When his daddy got home from those trips, he never wanted to tell Tony about what he’d seen, though. He was usually too busy packing for the next place, but it was okay, because that meant that Tony got to watch Jarvis spin the big globe again and learn about somewhere new.
Turning at the voice, Steve recognised the man as someone he’d greeted when they arrived. It took Steve a minute to remember what he was wearing and, when he did, he blushed to his roots. How a bright green elf suit with literal bells was so hard to forget, but Steve found he managed to do it several times a day.
When Steve had let it slip that it would only be him at home for most of Christmas Day alone because his Ma had offered to cover a shift at the hospital and his best friend was on a therapy-ordered retreat, Peter hadn’t given up his pleading until Steve had agreed to pop into theirs for at least a few hours.
There was a voicemail flashing on the landline when Steve returned home. Absentmindedly, he pressed the button to play the recording as he sorted through his mail, throwing some of the envelopes down into piles on the couch as he listened to his mother rambling on about something or other before finally confirming their dinner plans. Why the woman didn’t just text him like everyone else, Steve would never know.
Tony was about to fall asleep when his phone suddenly started to buzz. Groaning, he threw his hand over his face and cursed the day that he’d made his agreement with Natasha. But he had made the deal and there was no going back, for better or for worse.
“It’s a type of owl,” Steve said with a smile. “A once-rare one, apparently. The crew said it’s sitting pretty near the top, but right back against trunk, so they can’t just reach in and get it out. They can’t risk it flying off, or something.”
Tony laughed as he swung his legs around until he was sitting on the edge of the table instead of lying back on it. “I don’t think Steve is capable of ever getting angry,” he said. “He’s far too kind for that. Especially not about this sort of thing.”
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?” Tony said darkly. What sort of a question was that anyway? Of course he loved Steve.
“Thank you.” Steve blinked again, squinting a little as the lights rose and sent a glow through the room. It was both a good thing and a bad to have the lights lifted; Steve could see how close Tony was to the edge of the bed and rationally knew that having the lights on would coax him back into the land of the living, but the raised light also meant that Steve could see the way that Tony’s face was screwed up in fear, could see the pain etched deeply in his expression.
“Pie for breakfast?” Steve asked, hooking his chin over Tony’s shoulder as his hand shot out to snaffle a piece of apple floating in the bowl of warm water at Tony’s elbow. “How lucky am I?”
Tony snorted – and Steve was thankful that he had only done that and not mocked his awful, overdone joke.
. “I know you weren’t ever that serious when you were together, but she always spoke of you fondly and I want you to know. Yes,” she added with a roll of her eyes, sitting back and fluffing up the cushion behind her, “just like I do every year. I don’t care how many times I’ll say it, though. She would have been so proud.”
He broke off and Steve’s heart sunk as he realised why. The tyres crunching over the gravel of the parking lot just behind him explained it all and Steve could have cried.
Anything other than Tony walking away with no hesitation after breaking Steve’s heart into roughly four hundred pieces.
Tony blinked a few times, hands clenched into fists at his sides. Suspicion coloured his voice when he spoke again. “Are you okay?”
Another shriek of laughter sounded from down the hall and Tony huffed. “Nah, can’t say that I am, really. Though hearing Pete’s screams all through Christmas makes you feel hungover.”
“There’s always another way,” Steve said instead, glaring at the wall above Tony’s head. It was what Steve needed. He was nearly there, nearly had it all out.
“He said he had practice until late today. Got a game on Saturday. Quite a big one, I think. He said he’d be busy until then. And might stay over – it’s an away match.”
Steve’s gaze snapped up. “No,” he blurted out automatically. That was a frankly laughable thought; as if Steve had even registered any one since he’d met Tony over seven years ago. What a joke. “No. God, no. It’s, it was – just for… I was waiting.”
Steve wasn’t any less confused. Before he could say anything for clarification, another voice joined the conversation.
Tony laughed loudly at May’s teasing tone. “You’re most welcome, Ma’am. Would say it was my pleasure, but, well…”
Instead, he plastered on a cheeky smirk and winked over at Rhodey, who had twisted onto his side to look at him expectantly. “I’ll try not to. But you know what the French ladies are like. Stunning, beautiful,
Tony stuck his cold hand up Steve’s shirt, darting back when Steve kicked out. “One day I’ll succeed,” he promised. “Just you wait.”
It was always funny to see Steve jump half a mile in the air. For such good reflexes and hearing, he relaxed so much at the tower that it was almost too easy to catch him out. It was one of Tony’s favourite things to do though; to sneak up behind Steve and make him jump. The laugh that Steve always gave after made his stomach swoop and the way that Steve would make a grab for him in retaliation made his heart beat so much faster.
Even as Tony did his best to peel Peter away from his body so that he could bend down and pick him up, Peter shook his head and wrapped his arms around Tony’s thighs even tighter.
“No.” It was a snap and Tony took a breath, trying to calm down. “Fuck, Steve, I don’t want this. I don’t want any of this so I’m not sitting in a meeting listening to you divide our entire life and tear my house apart. Just take whatever you want and sign it away.”
Steve looked a little surprised, but it faded into a slow smile. “You’ve been hanging around with Buck too much, if you’re talking back like that.”
Rhodey didn’t return his wink, choosing instead to roll his eyes and push himself up to sit on the edge of his bed.
His heart was thudding wildly in his chest and he had to look away from Steve’s gentle smile, choosing instead to stare down at his lap. There was a thread hanging from the bottom of his sweatshirt and he had to twist his fingers together to resist the urge to pull and pull and pull. Things unravelled when they were pulled, he told himself. Tony licked his lips and dug his fingernails into his palm.
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin when the door suddenly burst open and he was rudely awakened from his nap. He lifted his head from the couch and squinted over at the figure standing there, panting as if they’d run a mile.
“JARVIS?” Steve kept his voice quiet as he called out for the AI, trying not to disturb Tony and startle him even more.
Suddenly, Tony gripped Steve’s hair and pulled him off before leaning in for a filthy kiss, their lips sliding and clashing. Steve let him do it for about five seconds before he pulled back. “Thought you were about to fuck me,” he reminded.
“Don’t see why,” Tony said, hard in his underwear, down to only a t-shirt and briefs. His hair was a mess, his mouth swollen, and his voice was
Thank god. Tony breathed out and thrust. It hurt a little and it felt amazing. Another thrust. Another. He got up to about a dozen thrusts and he was coming hard, eyes rolling back, lids fluttering shut, body spasming with completion. Distantly, he could hear Thor make noises like a bull in heat and there was a lot of shifting around.
Thor nodded. “With pleasure.” He hugged Clint one-armed before the archer backed up. Then he pulled both his fingers out and began to work all
“Guess I do, Shellhead,” Clint agreed. “Wanna get on your knees under the table so I can fuck your face? Or did you want to put on more of a show?”
“I’m wide open,” Steve agreed, ears burning and cock hardening while Tony continued to tease, just playing with his ass. “You could just spit on my hole and slide right in.”
Thor chuckled, shaking Steve a little, but he touched Steve’s hair like Steve was something precious and Steve looked at Tony. There was uncertainty and longing in his face. Tony covered the camera lens and insisted, “We’re rolling.” One of these days, they were going to record this for real, get Jarvis to help, but he knew Steve would never let them touch him again if they broke his trust here.
Steve's face turned toward him. "Don't welch, Tony." He sounded awful, and his face was red, but his eyes were clear. "Give a guy a second. Next time, I'll prep ahead of time. That's what plugs are for."
Tony grinned at the shock on their faces. Steve might be the youngest, but he wasn’t an idiot. “Are we all agreeing not to pretend that this isn’t about sex then?” Tony asked. “Because this is 100% about sex.”
“You heard me, slut,” Clint persisted. “I want to record every minute of this. Now, spread them. Can anyone help Cap out? He’s going to need a lot of lube and maybe some help.”
Twenty minutes later, Tony was both pleased and annoyed that Steve was genuinely winning a good number of the hands
is my new ringtone,” Tony teased. Hell, he didn’t want to have to wait for his turn. He was hard as hell just listening to that. He stopped
"I thought you were our... fucktoy," Thor pointed out. "You take our seed when we say. And I am ready to fill you until it runs down your legs in rivulets."
“To the victor go the spoils,” Tony said cheerfully, resisting the urge to feed his erection into Steve’s mouth. Steve had a sweet mouth and could keep his teeth out of the way even when he was being fucked raw, but Tony wasn’t sure he’d be able to hold on long enough to do his part of the evening’s gangbang if he started letting Steve suck him.
Tony fished out his phone, happy to play. “Let’s watch you play with his hole. Capsicle won, right? He deserves a little reward.”
Tony didn’t see Thor’s hand press the rest of the way in, but he saw Steve’s face. Steve’s expression contorted in pain for a moment and Tony’s fist balled up, commands for the tower’s security on his tongue. Then Steve moaned and he flopped forward. “Oh my god,” he whimpered. “Oh my god…”
, and they were in past the last knuckle. When had that happened? Steve was fucking himself hard on Clint’s fingers, probably hurting himself a little, but the guy was a bit of a pain slut in bed.
Face flaming, Steve stepped forward. “Cute, Clint.” He opened one of panniers on the motorcycle and pulled out a pair of khakis, getting dressed before getting on the motorcycle himself. He sandwiched the briefcase between their bodies for safety. It was
. But that was about it. Objectifying a friend and teammate and suffocating him on your cock was well outside his comfort zone.
A few minutes later, Steve and Thor wandered back to the couch as well, carrying their drinks and, in Thor’s case, Tony. Tony looked incredibly unwieldy draped over the big man's shoulder with his hands bound in fuzzy handcuffs and his ankles in a spreader, but Thor was the kind of ridiculously strong where no one was worried that he’d drop Tony or even that disgusting boilermaker. Thor handed Steve his drink, set Tony down on the floor, and took a seat on the couch. “How much time remains of this game?”
Together, Steve and Thor adjusted their positions. They were a well-matched pair: buff and blond and hung, and with exact control of their movements. Thor held his cock in place while Steve lowered himself down, taking Thor with ease. Steve swallowed him right up and Tony, realizing it was
“That was the lineman,” he explained, rolling his hips, working his cock in good and deep, grinding against Tony’s face. “And he grabbed the facemask, Thor.
Tony flashed the camera and Steve whispered, “I want you to fuck me, Clint.” Another flash, another squeeze of Thor’s fingers. “Please fuck me. Please, Clint.” Then his body shuddered and his face went tight as Clint’s hips pressed forward. No, Clint wasn’t built like Thor, but he would be enough of a stretch that Steve was going to feel it at the pace Clint was going. Tony kept pretending to take video, to take pictures, goading as Clint filled Steve and then began to pump his hips, driving into him in short, sharp thrusts.
By the time the commercial break was over, Steve had come and plugged the billionaire back up, then wandered off to get the sharpie. Thor smiled at Clint and murmured, “This pleases you, my friend?” Pleased him? Tony had designed a gangbang as closely to Clint's request as humanly possible.
Thor gestured Steve closer and tugged him down to sit on Thor’s thigh like Steve was tiny and not two-hundred-some pounds of muscle. He ran his fingers up Steve’s back and down his chest. “I like hearing you express to us what you like,” he reminded Steve in his resonant baritone. Thor had a way of talking during sex like he was addressing the Royal Court of Asgard and from the way Cap was breathing, that did things to Steve’s libido.  Tony was only a little jealous. “It would please me to hear you express: how is it that you would like to service us?”
, right into the engine, if he didn’t stop. “Hey, stop,” Steve begged, both relieved and disappointed when Tony did. “I want to come with you in me.”
, are you, Steve?” Clint teased. Steve grinned, barely subduing a laugh, and shoved his underwear off his eager cock, then stepped out of them, leaving himself bare. Clint whooped quietly. “Are we taking turns or fucking him all at once?” he asked the group earnestly. “Because if we’re taking turns, I go first!”
But there was something happening behind him. A warm, wet tongue was smoothing around his plugged hole, making the sensitive skin goose pimple, and the tongue wasn’t stopping there. It slipped down, lapping at his balls and perineum, just taking big, flat swipes at any available flesh. A strong, soft hand closed around his cock, stroking it slowly while Tony lapped and licked. Steve thought he might come right
"Green," Steve murmured, his voice choked, but then it began to clear. "I'm green. Yikes. That's a stretch. You two better do the moving. I'm kind of pinned here."
When Tony sauntered away to get into the car, Steve pulled his shorts back up. They jutted obscenely where his erection pressed at the front, and they stuck to the wet skin on his ass. He had to already look like a mess. Swallowing and excited, he followed Tony in and moved the front seats as far forward as they would go to give them a little room to maneuver. Tony sat in the rear, one foot up on the  red leather seat and a flask in his hand, the other rubbing himself through his slacks. Steve knelt in the footwell and closed the door behind him. The position made him feel every inch of the plug. “Can I take your cock out?” he whispered, looking up at Tony.
The light in the ceiling turned a little yellow and Clint immediately pulled his hips back so Tony could suck in a breath. The light went back to white. Clint could see Steve visibly relaxing at the reassurance that Tony remained in control. Cheerfully, Clint reached for the marker and made a tally mark on Tony’s forehead before pulling himself out of Tony’s mouth and stroking himself. “Steve, Steve, Steve, you are thinking far too hard about this,” he chastised before coming onto Tony’s face. He aimed to get Stark right between the eyes, and Clint’s aim never failed. “Football day is about cheering for a bunch of guys we’ve never met for playing a game we don’t understand the point of. And drinking.”
Steve fanned his mouth. “I think it’s hot,” he said through the mouthful of crust. “Did you cook this with lava?”
“Would make a good movie,” Steve said, hefting Peter up a little more as he leaned to see what the woman by the tree was doing. “And I don’t know. I’m quite glad it brought you here.”
Steve huffed a laugh, trailing his hand over Tony’s hip as he passed him. “Pretty sure that’s not a thing.”
And that was so different to anything Tony had ever known. Tony was used to being a commodity, an afterthought. Even his own family treated him as an inconvenience more than a person.
Except for when it was snowing on Christmas Eve and he’d been shouted at on at least four separate occasions for things entirely out of his control in the single week leading up to it.
“But they heal everything else.” Tony beckoned Peter over before he turned back to the stovetop. “How do you feel?”
It was as though the world stopped turning with Steve’s hushed words. The entire room shrank down, white noise rushing in Tony’s ears. He didn’t know what he’d been expecting Steve to say, but it hadn’t been that.
Typical. Tony wanted to scream. The world and his wife knew why the parties were always held in December, and yet Maria hadn’t joined the dots. It seemed that without Jarvis there to buy a tree and force Maria to take notice of the change of season with garlands and lights covering her house, she walked around with her eyes closed.
Tony let out a sigh full of nerves. He wriggled a little, reminding himself over and over again that he was doing it all for the little hitchhiker in his stomach. It would all be worth it in the end – though he hoped and prayed that the external examination would be able to find the baby and that the rest of his clothes could stay on.
“You can’t call your fiancé an idiot, idiot.” Any malice that Tony might have wanted in his voice was lost to the beaming smile on his face and the sheer joy radiating off him as he twisted his hand to look at his ring again.
A snort from his left drew his attention from the small screen and he turned to see Tony’s face full of amusement.
There had also been some blood in his underwear when he’d gone to the toilet around lunchtime. It had been a day and a bit since they’d
Tony tried to get back into the bed as quietly as he could. It was rarer than a blue moon for Tony to be up in a morning before Steve and he never really knew what to do with himself when it happened. That morning, he’d realised that chasing more sleep wasn’t an option and had slipped out to make a quick cup of coffee.
Silence. Steve hated silence. He’d had nothing but fucking silence for days. He wanted yelling, wanted laughter, wanted something that wasn’t more fucking
Tony’s arm shot out as though fighting an invisible demon and Steve reared back quickly to avoid being hit.
“Yes,” Tony said, moving his hand so that the ring was right between them. “But only if you ask me. The full question, that is. I don’t want to say yes and then find out we’ve been talking at cross purposes.”
Hours passed. Somewhere along the way those hours had turned to days. There was no real routine of which to speak, no schedule of food and water being delivered to them. It couldn’t be followed, couldn’t be counted down to the next time that Tony’s throat would be wet with a small glass of desperately-needed water. Their phones had gone, watches and wallets stripped when they had been taken off the street. Time eluded them.
“Pot-luck,” Nurse Rogers said softly, clearly picking up on Tony’s hesitance. “You could probably work out the eye colour, though.”
“I know.” Simple. The words were causal, carefree. It was as if Steve actually meant them. “I wanted to.”
“I’ve got it, thanks. Well practiced in juggling, believe it or not.” Tony’s smile grew into a bright grin.
“You look ready to me,” Steve said as lightly as he could, focussing on stirring away the last lump of powder in one of the mugs.
Tony’s grin grew wider. “They’re not actually that plain,” he said, eyes sparking with mischief. “And I wasn’t feeling the blue. Didn’t go with the evening.”
Oh. That was… something. It was an idea, alright. One glance at Steve told Tony that he was feeling much the same way.
“Yeah?” Tony stroked his thumb over his stomach. “Steve was always good at talking me down. I’d work myself up into these states and wouldn’t sleep until I’d finished whatever I was working on and he was always ready to come and drag me back to bed. My job’s pretty crazy, sometimes. Long hours. He would come and find me, or bring me coffee if he knew I couldn’t leave. Always thought he was too good for me. He disagreed, but he was.”
“It was its home, I think,” Tony said with a panicked look to Steve. He’d have thought Peter would have been all over it, bursting with questions and interest. “Owls like forests and woodlands, sometimes, so I guess he thought it would be nice and cosy away from the snow.”
“Hey, kid,” Tony smoothed a hand over Peter’s head, brushing his hair from his face. “Shush, baby. It’s okay; calm down.”
As soon as he’d finished talking, Peter hurtled into the room, running straight over to the couch and throwing himself onto May. Tony couldn’t even find it in himself to tell him off with the strength of his smile and the happiness practically radiating off him, though he did grab May’s mug from her quickly.
“I – yeah?” Tony swung his and Peter’s hands between their bodies. “That’s cool. Hot chocolate is awesome.”
“Oh, no.” Tony shot a faux-upset look towards Peter before grinning at Tash, “sorry, but these cookies just aren’t going to bake themselves, now, are they? Pete’s good for the job, though. Practical experience and all that.”
Steve looked up from the laptop in front of him when Tony spoke, a soft smile already on his face. He opened his mouth to say something – probably in his defence as Steve was nothing if not a workaholic – but it was as though the words died in his throat. Instead, Steve simply stared at Tony in shock, mouth falling open.
Suddenly, Steve reached out and drew a line across Peter’s forehead. Peter’s nose scrunched and he frowned in a way that made Steve lose his train of thought for a moment before Tony made a soft noise of confusion.
Even though they’d been in their agreement for well over a year and Tony had lost count of the times that Steve had dressed him in a perfectly-fitted suit, Tony still liked the fact that he clearly managed to take Steve’s breath away. Especially when Steve was so stubborn about keeping their relationship professional.
“Hey, hey.” Steve let out another quick breath and reached forward. Though Tony flinched, Steve flattened his hand over Tony’s forearm and held tight. “Tony, come on, sweetheart. Wake up. Wake up for me.”
Yes, Steve was smug, but Tony figured he was allowed to be. After all, it was him that had dressed Tony to look as though he had just stepped off a catwalk and would be the one parading round with him on his arm. Tony couldn’t help the rush of pride that stirred something within him.
“I – he’s a kid.” Steve wasn’t a complete idiot. Hell, that was half the reason he didn’t like kids in the first place. But surely, there were good times? Someone must have thought that the benefits outweighed the bad things. Tony certainly did. And Steve, with a weird sort of warmth in his stomach, – a hint of nausea, too – thought that he could see why. “That comes with the territory, surely?”
Especially not when he was left alone in a scarily large house with not a single decoration to be seen.  Not that anyone knew where they were kept. Without Jarvis there to fetch them out of hiding and take charge of putting them up, the Stark mansion stayed in its own, festive-less bubble.
Pressing his lips together, Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder before running his tongue over his teeth. It was an obvious attempt to hold back a laugh and Tony narrowed his eyes.
What was really fucking Steve up was the way that Tony was with Peter. Obviously he would be paternal and loving, but it smacked Steve in the face. Why did it matter to him if someone was a good dad or not? Why did he get affected by a stranger being sweet with a child that he had no connection to?
“Of course you will,” Tony answered, sliding his free hand over Steve’s chest, plucking at his shirt buttons. Taking advantage of their height difference, Tony leant forward and pressed his lips to Steve’s throat. He moved his lips up and over Steve’s pulse point, gradually kissing his way up to the apple of Steve’s cheek. “Because you have to get through the night to get to the ending.”
There was a long silence from Tony. The only sounds coming over the comms were noises from the attacking robots as Tony fought them off with none of his usual witty comments and joking banter.
As stereotypical as it may have been, Steve loved apple pie. It had been something of a staple in his household when he’d been growing up and his mom had made it whenever they managed to get the fresh ingredients needed. Steve spoke so fondly of her hours in the kitchen, telling how he was often too ill and weak to do much more than sit at her side and watch, that sometimes Tony felt as though he’d been there too.
Tony laughed and pressed a kiss to the very corner of Steve’s mouth, finally stepping out of his hold and making a big show of inspecting the panties still in his hand. “Of course I am,” he said, as though it were the simplest thing in the world. “Isn’t that exactly why you chose me?”
It wasn’t true. Of course it wasn’t true. Steve had bought Tony an entire wardrobe of gala-worthy clothes and, obviously, there were Steve’s suits to raid as well. Between them, they had hundreds of black pocket-squares, but it was so much more fun this way.
“What?” Tony pushed himself up onto his elbow. “You’re meant to be out with Andrew, aren’t you? I thought you had a whole night planned. He’s been talking about it for a while.”
“I love you.” Peter couldn’t remember the last time he’d actually said that out loud. Not to his dad or to Steve, for that matter. He didn’t know if he’d ever said it to Steve; at least not since he was a child. Now, though, it was burning his tongue. He needed to say it, needed to tell his dad that he loved him. “Love you. Both of you. I – Dad, I just, I do, please,
“I know you need a star,” Peter said, smile dropping back to a frown. “Bet you haven’t got one of those.”
There was that damned smile again, turned on Tony. He could feel it against the side of his head. “Well, there must be someone. You can’t have done this to yourself.”
“Oh, I’m sure,” Steve said. He leant forward until his lips were brushing Tony’s, mirroring their position from earlier but with Steve towering over Tony instead and Tony not resisting in the slightest. “You’re my good boy, aren’t you?”
It was easier said than done and suddenly, without warning and out of nowhere, tears were falling from Peter’s eyes. He never wanted to be anywhere else, never wanted to not hear his dad’s heartbeat ever again. The cold ring of his dad’s wedding ring against his upper arm grounded him more than anything else, the promise of a family never leaving him again.
Sam laughed loudly, the sound carrying over Bing Crosby’s crooning. “Go in, you daft prick. I’ll shout you out if someone turns up.”
It was definitely the thought that counted, Tony tried to tell himself as he stared down at the meagre ingredients in front of him. He had to work with what he had and what he had wasn’t much. The only tomatoes he’d had in his cupboards were the tinned kind, so the sauce wouldn’t be as good as his Mama’s when she used the fresh tomatoes from the farmer’s market they had to drive out of town for.
Steve smiled, but he knew it didn’t quite reach his eyes. That was twice he’d been told that. “He’s a good kid.”
“Nah, it’s alright Tones.” The bed dipped next to Tony and an arm snaked around his shoulders, a strong body warm next to his. “I can hang out here for a bit. We don’t want to miss anything, do we.”
The hug that Steve caught Tony in was the final straw. Tears sprung to Tony’s eyes and he twisted his hands in Steve’s jacket until his knuckles went white. It was for the best, he told himself when he stepped back and plastered on a smile. He was a big boy; he could handle it.
On those weeks, Jarvis would pull out a big, colourful globe over breakfast and point out random blobs with funny names that Tony giggled about. Apparently, that’s where his daddy was and Tony would beg Jarvis to tell him all about the places.
Tony narrowed his eyes, but he softened quickly when Steve shot him a wide grin, one hand still massaging his forehead.
Steve looked up to see Tony peering over the back of his seat, a pillow crease on his left cheek and eyes a little hazy with sleep.
Tony rolled his eyes as he dropped mini marshmallows into one of the four mugs on the counter before him. “In the kitchen, kid,” he called back, even though he knew Peter wouldn’t have heard him. It was as if Peter switched his ears off right after calling for attention, choosing to just shout until whoever he wanted made their way to him. Sure enough, there was another shout of his name but no child appeared in the kitchen.
Pulling on a baggy sweatshirt that he didn’t think was his but that had a modestly-high neckline, Tony wandered out of the kitchen and into the living room. Hearing his houseguest moving around, he paused in the doorway and watched as Steve woke up slowly, his face scrunched up against the bright lighting in the living room. When Steve pushed himself up into a sitting position and caught sight of Tony standing in the doorway, he grimaced.
Focaccia took a long time to knead and for the rising process to get done perfectly, but spending that long watching over it in the kitchen meant that Peter could sit at the breakfast bar to finish his homework and not be alone.
Steve turned at the sound of Tony’s voice and paled when he saw what Tony was holding. He’d almost forgotten he’d even bought it, but there it was in the cold light of day.
“Whenever I don’t go out with her, she gives my number out to the people she can’t get rid of and I answer the phone when they call and give them the dead person’s number speech.”
child, who was quite probably the most important thing in their entire world. It was as if Tony was resigned to his fate to be alone or left at the bottom of the dating pile.
Peter hated being alone. They’d discovered that pretty quickly after he’d moved into the tower with the rest of the team and had all started going almost out of their way to ensure that Peter didn’t have to suffer by himself. It wasn’t exactly a hardship for Steve to sketch in the communal living room instead of his bedroom, or for Sam and Bucky to train on the mats in the middle of the gym whilst Peter ran laps around the edge to get out of his own head.
And that was something else that Steve knew. He remembered all too well the day that Tony had come to him and said that he had gotten a promotion with his work and that he would be leaving within the month.
Now, it wasn’t even unusual for one of the Avengers to eat at Tony’s place, or to spend time with Peter. But what
Even through the phone, Howard’s voice was loud and demanding. Tony winced despite himself, utterly hating his reaction but not being strong enough to stop it. It wasn’t a problem that Howard wouldn’t be there for Tony’s school break, but he had missed his mother something fierce. He’d been weirdly looking forward to seeing her, even if it would have been short snippets between parties and galas. It would have at least been something.
Peter’s face lit up and he pulled away from Tony’s legs just enough to beam up at Steve hopefully. “Really?”
“Mistletoe!” Peter said, a cheeky grin on his face as he laughed again, “May says you gotta kiss under mistletoe at Christmas.”
Nurse Rogers turned her gaze back to the computer at her side and Tony breathed a little easier. “And they’re not here?”
“There’s not really anything to get,” Tony said with a shrug, locking his tablet and setting it on his knee. “And you don’t have to whisper. Once he starts watching, there’s not much that can distract him, really.”
No. Of course Tony wasn’t ready. Was anybody ever meant to be ready to see their child for the first time? All he could think about was how much could go wrong, how badly he could mess up, how–
Steve rolled his eyes at that; of course Steve knew who it was. Like he could ever forget Tony, the stupid, insecure man. That very voice coloured nearly all of Steve’s dreams.
They fell quiet, both relaxing in the peaceful moment. It felt easy between them, though there was a slight edge to the air. Steve wanted to press, but he fought himself and held it back.
Finally alone again, Tony wandered back into the kitchen. He made himself a cup of coffee on autopilot as he picked up his phone for the first time that morning.
The only saving grace was that he was alone. Blissfully and peacefully alone. There were no screaming children, no woman in the corner shouting into her phone or man sounding as though he were coughing up a lung like there had been when he’d been in a few days before. Tony had had his blood taken and had peed in a cup then, and spent the next few days sat anxiously awaiting a phone call that had summoned him to go in to be given the results. Not that he had needed them.
It was the only meal she’d actually known how to cook and they had a weekly Thursday night dinner date in the kitchen when Howard worked late at the office. She’d carry him round on her hip when he was too small to see what she was preparing on the countertops and, when he’d grown a little taller, sit him in pride of place to sound out every word of the passed-down recipe written in her mother’s cursive handwriting.
“Wait.” Steve looked up suddenly and squinted. “Why did I end up here? Thought I’d have gone home with Buck.”
Another round of silent nodding and Tony laughed, bending down to his grandchild’s level. Holding out his arms, he let his precious recipe book rest in the palm of his hands, ready for the taking.
He’d known what was going on with him from the start. Though he’d always been careful, that clearly wasn’t a guarantee that nothing would happen because Tony had spent the last two weeks hunched over a toilet. He’d thrown up all of the weirdest combinations of foods he’d been craving, things like peanut butter and pickles, or fried egg and grated chocolate. Add that to the mood swings, the sore areas of his body, and a definite rounding of his stomach, and Tony knew he had grounds to panic.
“Now, if you’ll excuse me,” Tony said as he turned and headed for the bedroom, leaving Steve stood in the middle of the room with his shirt half-unbuttoned and pants a little tight, “I really must do something about these boxers I have on. I’m suddenly afraid there’s going to be an underwear line. And we really can’t have that, can we?”
His stuttering earned him a soft smile from the woman in scrubs and Tony felt something loosen ever so slightly in his chest. There was no judgment, no dark look of disappointment. He didn’t know why that’s what he’d been expecting, but to not be on the receiving end of it was a whole new feeling of relief that could have knocked him off his feet.
He didn’t find a decent cup of coffee. He found a mediocre takeaway cup of tea, lukewarm and far too milky, but it gave him something to focus on as he sat in the reception area of the office building and tried to resist the urge to run.
If anyone would ever ask why Tony shot out of his skin and spilt his coffee all over his hand, then Tony would have blamed the fact that he hadn’t slept in weeks. Not since Steve had presented him with papers and walked out of their house. Everything made him jump when he was alive because of caffeine alone.
Truly, the whole tree was a bit weird. A little messy, definitely overcrowded, completely overpriced, and ridiculously over-the-top. But, it was Peter’s tree and it was Steve’s tree and it was Tony’s tree that he would never, ever change.
“Gee, thanks.” Steve yawned widely, arms above his head. The borrowed blanket that he’d had over himself slipped down and Tony couldn’t stop his gaze from wandering, eyes settling on the expanse of tanned, muscled chest. “Fuck, what the hell did I drink?”
He’d looked almost familiar, as well, as soon as he’d walked in. Everything he had said had seemed to strike a chord somewhere inside of her and she felt as though she knew him.
Tony’s eyebrow lifted again as his mouth twisted into a cocky half-smirk, one that Steve knew all too well. But, regardless of the face that meant Tony knew something he didn’t, Steve wouldn’t back down for once. He would stand in his corner and fight for what he wanted.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said, voice low and words starting to slur into each other. Maybe he was more tired than he’d thought. “I love you, too.”
It showed that Steve had meant something to Tony, that his love hadn’t been as entirely unrequited as Steve had cried about for so long.
Wow. Tony’s mind went blank when his eyes moved involuntarily and focused in on where Nurse Rogers was pointing something out on the computer screen.
“You ready to go yet? We still have to decorate the tree. The rest of the stuff should have been delivered by now and we can put a film on.”
“Thank you,” she whispered, voice thick with tears. She could feel them gathering in her eyes and she blinked rapidly, trying in vain to stop them from spilling down her cheeks. It wasn’t her problem to cry about, she tried to tell herself, wasn’t her place to even know what was happening to that poor man.
Tony wanted to protest and to say that it hadn’t been, but the truth was that he didn’t know if he could. It might well have been. His subconscious might have noticed the wedge between them long before he ever did, his self-preservation kicking in to stop his heart from crumbling right in front of him.
Following her blindly, Tony was pleased to note that the examination room was nicer than the waiting room. He felt less like the was waiting for the gallows with the brighter colours and a colourful curtain around a surprisingly comfortable-looking bed.
“Let’s let your dad sit down, hey?” Steve turned his legs into the aisle so that there was just enough room for Tony to squeeze past to the window seat. As soon as he was seated, Peter practically started vibrating in his seat.
“No, Tony.” With a soft smile, Nurse Rogers turned back to him and Tony felt his shoulders relax. “You have to do what’s right for you and your baby first off. I’d think about the other father, but I’m not going to tell you that you have to tell them.”
Tony scoffed. “Yeah. There was someone.” He sighed, the bitterness falling from his voice. “There was a wonderful someone.”
He looked desperately sad and, for some reason, Steve didn’t want him to be. “Have you ever been on a plane before?”
As he withdrew his hand sharply, Steve blew out a long breath, heart sinking. Tony hadn’t had a bad nightmare for a while, not one that took him so deep that he didn’t respond to Steve’s attempts to wake him.
“Oh.” Steve wasn’t sure what he was meant to do. All he knew was that he couldn’t ignore the boy. “That wasn’t nice.”
Steve was startled out of his thoughts when Peter’s voice called out to him. When Steve looked down from Tony’s retreating figure, he could only see part of Peter’s face, his little nose and mouth squished between his seat and Tony’s.
“Shush, Tony, no.” Carding his hand through Tony’s hair, Steve held Tony’s face against his neck. He never wanted to see Tony in pain ever again, but it wasn’t the time or the place to bring it up. That was the price one paid when they had a moral compass as large and as honourable as Tony. Sometimes, they got hurt. “You don’t need to be sorry. I’m the one that should be sorry. You did the right thing, sweetheart. You know you did – and I’m so proud of you.”
“I don’t know that we have any marshmallows left,” Steve said apologetically but, even as Tony’s face dropped a little, Peter’s expression didn’t change.
“I’ll call the nurse, alright? Let me just–,” Steve quickly reached for the button at the side of the bed, pressing it frantically to alert someone at the Nurses desk that they needed help. “I’ve got you.”
“Uh, yeah, Romeo. Did you not hear the part about Nat not knowing how to pick guys and having to give out a fake number?”
“It’s fine,” Tony said, waving a hand. The way his gaze dropped to Peter and his mouth turned down told another story, but Steve didn’t push. “He’s all I need.”
The snort that Peter let out at that was almost violent and he shook his head at his dad, choosing to ignore his veiled protests for the time being, and focused instead on the rest of the team. “Whatever.”
Steve’s smile softened. “So he does. That means he was meant to be your friend, if he looks like you. Fits perfectly.”
“So, I’m going to need you up on the bed please. Shuffle up so that your shoulders reach the top – yes, just like that, thank you – and shirt up around your chest. There will be a few questions I need to go over with you, but let’s see if we can find ourselves a baby, shall we?”
Whilst he’d been thrilled to spend more time with Steve, Tony had hardly been prepared for one guest for Christmas, never mind two.
Son despotised, Tony straightened up and frowned at Steve. “That’s literally what fate means. Divine powers control everything. They don’t pick and choose.”
Ty was gorgeous. He was a few years older than Tony, having taken a gap year (or two, or three) before completing his degree. He was everything that Tony wasn’t and from the very first moment they’d met, Tony had been smitten.
“You’re already home,” Tony said lightly, concentrating on adding a few spices to his soup instead of looking back at Peter. He could feel eyes on the side of his face and fought the urge to turn with everything he had. “After we’ve eaten, I’ll show you the papers.”
It wasn’t in-keeping with their brand of banter and hiding their emotions, but Tony couldn’t find it in himself to care about the honesty. Though what he had said had been with a joking tone, Steve’s wholehearted reaction to Tony’s words made his chest pound.
Rolling onto his side, Tony tucked his free hand under his head and bit back a yawn. “It’s a thing we do. Nat isn’t exactly good with guys. No exactly about it, actually, she’s the worst at picking men.” And that included all of Tony’s bad decisions - and he’d made a lot of them in his college youth. And his adulthood, for that matter.
lie to James. His parents really did have a house in France and they spent every Thanksgiving there.
Tony’s attention was obviously still on Peter as well, but he held up a finger to Steve. “I should probably warn you that I’ve never made hot chocolate before. Don’t think I’ve ever drank it before, actually.”
