Despite knowing, as an absolute certainty that whatever was happening between him and Sherlock certainly and definitely had a time limit, John couldn’t deny the warm bubble of hope that formed in his heart.
“Because of you, the police knew to take that call seriously and investigate.  Because of you, a serial killer is in custody.  You’ve saved at least one person’s life.  Probably more.  Think about it.  That is one family that will be celebrating Christmas together instead of mourning a lost life and that’s down to you.”  John realized he was rubbing his thumb along the side of Sherlock’s kneecap and up to where bone met taught muscle. He pulled his hand back.
John opened the box and pulled out another ornament.  It was a gingerbread house but as John looked more closely, he realized it was familiar.  Then he noticed the police tape across the door and a figure in the upstairs window.  It was gingerbread depiction of the crime scene that Sherlock had taken John to on the first night they met.
John opened his door and pulled Sherlock through.  He shut the door and turned to face Sherlock.  The room was dark except for the Christmas tree and Sherlock’s face glowed gold in the light.  Sherlock was looking at John again with all his focus, his eyes roving around his face.  John waited for a moment, letting Sherlock take it in.  Then he couldn’t wait any longer and he stepped forward.  He put his hands on Sherlock’s chest, sliding them up to his shoulders. Sherlock seemed frozen, his eyes fluttering shut as John ran a thumb over the bare skin of Sherlock’s clavicle.  Then put at hand on John’s check, cupping his jaw and leaned down to kiss him.  They started slowly but very quickly, Sherlock began leaning in, pressing insistently until John’s back was against the door.
John spent a few minutes looking around the room before he picked a book and settled down to read.  It was only a few minutes later when he heard the door open and the approach of some posh sounding shoes.
“So, I’ll just go, shall I?” said John.  He suddenly needed to not be in this room anymore.  He didn’t know why Sherlock was doing this, but he already knew him well enough to know he wasn’t going to change his mind if it was set on something.
John nodded and he could feel his throat muscles working as he swallowed down the knot in his throat.
Back in his room, he flipped on the tele and waited until he heard the Aldovian National Anthem play, announcing the start of the address.
“I’m sure you’ve said everything you could possibly have to say to him,” said Sherlock, barely turning his head to look at him.
“I’m staying,” said John, forcefully.  The last thing he wanted to do at that moment was let Sherlock out of his sight and into the path of more avenging siblings.  John settled himself in an armchair by the window.  He watched Sherlock pulling on protective gloves and goggles and begin measuring out liquid from the glasses.  Every so often, Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at John as though wondering why he was still sitting here.  Watching Sherlock work was unexpectedly soothing, and he began to feel his anger at Sherlock draining away.  Yes, there was probably another way Sherlock could have handled the situation and yet, John couldn’t think of one.  And he couldn’t deny that Sherlock’s way had worked.
“Oh but it is exciting,” said Sherlock.  He stopped short, just in front of John.  He was standing very close again as though he didn’t fully understand the concept of boundaries and personal space.  “Serial killers are all just waiting to be caught.  They want the appreciation.  And this one in particular is very clever.  He’s made them all look like suicides.”
‘Of course,’ was John’s first thought and he was shocked, knowing that this had to be fake, that Sherlock was up to something, that they’d only known each other for four days for God’s sake, by his reaction.  Everyone was looking at him.  Sherlock was looking at him with the most hopeful, tearful expression on his face.   John’s knees were shaking and there was a lump forming in his throat but his hand was steady.
“Merry Christmas,” said Sherlock.  “You look nice.”  He took John’s hand, twisting it slightly to look at the cuff links.  Then he gave it a slight squeeze before letting it go.
“Well, I appreciate it anyway,” said Angelo.  “As I said, anything you want.  On the house.  What can I get you both?”
“We can warm up here for a bit and then take the snowmobile back,” said Sherlock.  “And we’ll be back to the palace in time for dinner.
Mycroft and Sherlock were standing on a low platform at the far end of a briefing room that had to be somewhere in the palace judging by the overly ornate moulding on the wall.  Mycroft was behind the podium again and Sherlock was behind him at his shoulder.  But unlike the last address John had watched where Sherlock was barely contained restless energy, Sherlock was entirely still.  His eyes were trained down on the ground in front of him and his lips were pressed together into a thin line.
“Not him,” said Sherlock.  “Tourist on a skiing holiday.  No idea why the cabbie was taking him through the village though.”
“Fine,” said John.  “Have a nice life then.” He yanked the door open and slammed it behind him.  It wasn’t until he was back in his room and some of the anger had seeped out of him that he wondered what had caused Sherlock to say those things and act that way.  ‘What ifs’ and ‘Maybes’ swirled around his head but in the end, he kept coming back to Sherlock wouldn’t do anything he didn’t want to do.  Maybe he was torn on kicking John out but on some level, he must have thought their relationship or friendship had gone as far as it could.
They actually had a very pleasant meal despite the looming threat of a murder coming to crash their evening.  Sherlock spent much of the meal picking at his plate while John ate a delicious stew with dumplings.  Sherlock was fascinating to talk to though he clearly had one eye on the square the entire time.  He told John about Aldovia’s history and about customs and protocol at the palace.  He told him a bit about how he helped clear Angelo’s name and about a few other cases he solved.  He avoided talking about anything John would expect to talk to a new acquaintance about like jobs and family and school days.  It was refreshing.
The looked at each other for a few moments and then Sherlock cleared his throat.  “You may as well get some sleep in an actual bed,” he said.  “Mine’s just in the next room.  I won’t be in for a while yet.  I need to call Lestrade and give him my information.”
“No, I’m not calling to cancel,” he said. “Thought you might like some company – fancy some dinner?”
John pulled the desk chair in front of Sherlock and sat down opposite him. He dragged the chair closer until their knees were touching.
“John,” Sherlock breathed. Another kiss, this one laced with desire and apology and forgiveness, all the things they could never say.
The lights were on in 221B and he slowly pushed the door open. John sat in his chair, laptop balanced on his lap, sipping a whisky. Sherlock’s heart took an extra beat as John turned toward him, smiling.
“No. Look, no matter how pissed you are at him, at me, at Mary, you can’t go off like this. Are you trying to get me killed?” Melodramatic, she knew, but not totally farfetched. Sherlock had the scars to prove it.
“John,” said Sherlock, breathlessly.  John could feel himself leaning in, like Sherlock was one tall, beautiful magnet.  He couldn’t be sure, but he thought Sherlock was leaning imperceptibly down as well.
Sherlock was smiling again, and the expression filled John’s chest with warm like he’d taken a sip of good whiskey. “Good, good.  I’ll make sure to let Mrs Hudson and mummy know you’ll be staying.
“Technically, yes.  But Palace PR has confiscated mine again.  They seem to think that tweeting about the kings crash diets and resulting mood swings is unseemly.”
John barely slept that night, and a car was waiting for him early the next morning to take him to the airport.  Just after noon, he was back in London, walking through rain soaked streets back to his flat.  He opened the door and looked around the cold, grey room.  It felt comically simple and drab compared to the palace.  He stood in the centre of the room for a very long time before he finally stepped into the small kitchenette to boil the kettle for a cup of tea.
John’s suit had been pressed and his dress shirt had been laundered while they’d been out.  John was incredibly grateful to whatever domestic fairy that had done that, though it was probably Mrs. Hudson.  John made a point to thank her if he saw her.
“I’m surprised your allowed to go out in public without security or clearence or, I don’t know, something,” said John, breaking the silence.
“Yes,” said Lestrade.  “They’re on the way to the lab now.  We’ll let you know when we have the results.”
Mrs. Hudson smiled indulgently and patted him on the arm.  “Don’t worry,” she said.  “Everyone here is very liberal minded.  In fact, Sherlock’s cousin, the Lord of Farthingham just had the most beautiful gay wedding last summer and-“
“Excuse me,” said glasses.  “I just think I see…” He trailed off, turned and walked away into the crowd.
Violet leaned in, one hand still on John’s shoulder.  With her back to the crowd, the cheer fell from her face, leaving only worry.  “He just left in a in an awful mood.  He’s been in an awful mood since you left, not that it’s your fault of course.  Go after him.  He said he was going to his apartment.  You know the way?”
“For being there.  For not judging me.  For accepting me.”  And this time, it was obvious Sherlock was moving towards him, hovering just above him.  John couldn’t look away from Sherlocks eyes.  He was pretty sure the palace could start crumbling around them and he wouldn’t care.  “John,” said Sherlock in a near whisper.
“I still think he was making it up most of the time,” said the man John had seen that afternoon getting out of the sports car.  “Did you hear he was involved in the serial suicides?  The inspector on the case mentioned in the press conference that Sherlock “assisted”.  Can’t imagine how.”
Sherlock continued throwing questions at him, most unrelated to the question that came before but all to do with his childhood and family and life before the army.  John had the sense that he was being dissected and catalogued.  He thought this was perhaps how the Pink Lady would have felt under Sherlock examination if she’d been alive to witness it.
“I agree with you, ma’am,” said the Prime Minister.  “It’s only a matter of selling the idea to parliament.  But if we have the backing of the royal family, it would certainly help.”
“Can I borrow your phone?” asked Sherlock out of the blue, putting his hand out as though he’d known before he’d asked that John would say yes.
Sherlock looked down at John, giving him his full attention for the first time since they come into the room.  Sherlock was studying him so deeply in fact, that John was afraid to breath, afraid with this level of scrutiny that even a breath would give away how John was starting to feel about him.
He followed Sherlock down the hall and into the room he pointed out.  In comparison to the sitting room and the study, Sherlock’s bedroom was as neat as a pin.  The bed was made, and the surfaces were clear of clutter.  The room was decorated in the same ornate style as the rest of the rooms in the palace had been.  But the bed was a simple four poster in dark wood with a grey duvet and sheets.
Mike Stamford invited John out for a drink at his local with his wife and a few friends for New Year’s Eve.  John accepted because he couldn’t stomach the idea of sitting alone in his flat and listening to London celebrate the new year around him.
John watched as his words sank in and Sherlock unclenched his teeth and his shoulders lowered and he uncrossed his arms.  “Royal pain in the ass, was the expression I believe,” he said but there was the faintest hint of grin, just around the corner of his mouth.
It seemed he had been standing near his brother, but he was already making his way across the room and through the dancers to John.
“Are you ok?  Can we talk?” John typed and sent it before he could rethink it.  He sat and stared at his phone for a few seconds, hoping to see Sherlock’s response pop up right before his eyes.  When it didn’t, John stood and began pacing the room, his phone in his hand.  He kept checking the phone every few seconds.  He forced himself to wait, to try and distract himself.  Sherlock was certainly busy, and it didn’t mean anything that he hadn’t texted back.
“The Prince acted quickly to capture the would be assassin and minimize any injury to the guests of the party.  He orchestrated the faux engagement to keep the guests and servers in the ballroom while the assassin was apprehended.”
John woke feeling well rested.  He’d actually had pleasant dreams, which was a rare enough occurrence, that he spent a few minutes laying in the warm bed, trying to remember what they were.  The only thing he could grasp was following Sherlock as they ran down a tunnel of Christmas lights.  John thought they might have been chasing Santa but he wasn’t sure if it was so they could get presents or if it was because Santa had stolen the presents.
Sherlock was looking at him with his piercing blue eyes and John thought he could almost see the mechanisms of Sherlock’s brilliant mind moving behind them.  “Thank you, John,” he said softly.
“Wait,” said John, turning towards him.  “What am I supposed to do? Just ring the bell and say I’m here to see the Prince?”
Eventually, he got out of bed, found his clothes, and made his way back to his room.  He spent the morning fiddling with his phone, scanning through the books on the shelves and staring out the window.  Around noon, Mrs Hudson came in with another sandwich.  “The king and the prince are going to make a public statement soon,” she said.  “You may want to watch it, dear.”
John felt a crack somewhere behind his sternum at Mycroft’s words but the tiny, incandescent spark was still there, glowing brightly, and would be until he heard those words from Sherlock’s lips. John stared at Sherlock.  His face was blank, his eyes still fixed on the floor and a small crease was forming between his eyes.  John couldn’t read his expression, couldn’t tell if the sentiment Mycroft relayed really came from Sherlock or if it had been forced on him.
John was barely listening as he stared around the room.  They were standing in a sitting room with a massive fireplace and a Christmas tree in front of the picture window. John actually had to look around the corner to the next room to see the edge of a large, four poster bed.  Everything was done up in pale blues, and greens and creams and gold.  John was fairly certain his entire flat would fit in this room.  Twice.
“Ignore him,” said Violet.  “Just know that you would be more than welcome.  I do hope we’ll see you there. But now, I need you boys to go.  Mycroft and I have a few last-minute details to look at and we need the table top to work.”
Pearce had never even been charged.  There had been an unscheduled hearing behind closed doors. Dishonourable discharge –
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said. He took a breath. “No permanent damage.” John suspected he was talking about more than the bruise. Sherlock’s hand pressed on top of John’s.
A pain shot through Sherlock’s heart. Mycroft was ten years cold in the plots in Sussex next to their parents. “Yeah, I’d like to see that. Please, call him.”
John leaned forward and started to give the driver the new address when Sherlock stopped him. He texted Lestrade.
"I probably just moved or took a breath when I shouldn’t have. Blurred the scan,” John says in bed later.
John ignored him and continued. “We had nothing. That broadcast in January and then nothing. We suspected Mary went to join Moriarty – so when she called . . .”
He began scrolling through the phone. If he was surprised by anything he read, he didn’t let on. It was only after she brought him the tea that he looked up.
He’d told Mary he needed to take care of Sherlock, he needed time to think. She said she understood. She said she would wait. That the baby was teaching her to be patient. She told him she loved him. She told him she was sorry. He’d wanted her to be more specific, but the words had caught in his throat like shards of glass. She sent him an envelope every fortnight now – copies of the bank statements, bills she’d paid, bills he needed to pay, the baby’s first scan. Too early to tell the sex. Too late to consider an abortion. Cancelled cheques were his only form of communication.
“You do know what happens to people with babies?” Sherlock shuddered. And then pulled John close. “But, yes, it’s a yes. Because the thought of this child growing up without her father – the person she needs the most in her life – who is also the person I need most in my life, is untenable. What are we calling her?”
Five minutes later, John brushed his teeth and swallowed another fentanyl. If he took much more, he’d risk sleeping through his own death. Where was the fun in that?
John moved his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, kissing the back of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock arched toward the touch, his hand falling from John’s hip, brushing against John’s erection. His hand stilled for a moment, and John pulled away, not sure.
Sherlock begins doing up the buttons, shaking his head. “Pity. You were off to a promising start.” He starts to stand.
“Water’s fine.” Kate wiped her hands across her eyes. She looked at Sherlock. “Are you going to say anything?”
Sherlock set the kettle on the stove top and turned. “Are you feeling ill?” He took a step toward John.
He missed John too. Missing John was a constant nagging ache since the day John told him he was moving with Rosie to take a position at a small surgery in Sussex. They needed a fresh start, John said. Why the hell did a ten-year-old need a fresh start? Rosie had flamboyantly whinged about changing schools and houses and friends until John promised a puppy in return for a smile. She’d been whinging successfully ever since. Sherlock stayed in London and kept working, calling on John for the occasional consult. When Rosie went to uni, John had quit his job at the surgery and started writing full-time – a series of crime novels he set in London. His protagonist was a brilliant doctor, and although several inches taller and at least one stone lighter, he was clearly John. In the novels, the doctor spent much of his time pining for a former nameless colleague. The most popular question John received at book signings was “Will they ever get together?” Sherlock had never read them.
Kate squirmed under Sherlock’s stare. She felt like this was somehow all her fault. She didn’t like it. “And how’s that working out so far, eh?”
John grew very still. He lowered his head. Kate thought for a minute he was crying. But then he raised his head and the look on his face made her step back a bit.
“There was supposed to be two of you. I was to give the package to someone called John Watson. She was very clear about that.”
“And you owe me a shirt. And dinner.” I look over to see the spilled containers of curry and rice mixed with a specimen cup and a fork. One pristine samosa is tilted precariously on the edge of the table. I stretch and nudge the leg of the table with my foot.  I sit up and catch it before it hits the ground and pop into my mouth.
After twenty minutes, Sherlock had nudged John off the couch so he could lie down, sideways facing the wall, his knees pulled up against his chest like a small boy.
He stepped into the shower. He turned his face up into the spray and when the water hit his eyelids he saw a picture, a freeze-frame of Moriarty’s face, his eyes widened in surprise.
“There are halos around what I imagine are buildings and trees. Abandoned cars. Similar to sundogs.”
“Heavens, no. She left almost an hour ago,” Mrs. Hudson said. She was collecting the dirty cups and glasses and plates scattered about the flat. “How is he?” She glanced down the hall toward the bedroom. “He gave me quite a fright. You both did. So much carrying on.”
The first clip that came up was an interview he’d done outside his house, soon after he turned out to be not quite as dead as everyone thought. He was wearing the most ridiculous hat and a self-satisfied smile. She recognized that look – it was the one worn by every clever boy who’d just shown up all his classmates.
John slipped into the bed beside him, shivering in the breeze from the open window. Sherlock tugged the sheet over them, wrapped both arms around John and pulled him close. “Stay with me,” he whispered, then kissed John lightly on the lips before falling back to sleep.
Again, big thanks to peg22, master plotter and my favourite valentine. There is not enough chocolate in the world, just saying...
“There was nothing to investigate. Moriarty made a clean break when he left Canada. I saw no reason to return. And there were other, more pressing matters.”
“Yeah, got that one – the night he was shot. I just thought you’d have more specific questions.” Greg loosened his tie and sat back. Waited.
John knew he needed to sleep. But he couldn’t. Not yet. No matter how tired he was, there was something he needed to do first. He stood on the pavement outside St. Bart’s, looking for an empty cab. It was only five, but the sun had already set, the air tight and cold. She’d be home by now, making tea, listening to the news on the telly. When he first moved in with Mary, it had surprised him to find out how much he enjoyed the routine of their lives. Up at 6, to work at 7, home by 5, in bed by 10. It was everything that life with Sherlock wasn’t, and everything he needed. No matter what Sherlock believed.
The flat was dim, the curtains still drawn over the big windows. John switched on the lamp by the door. “I’m going to put the kettle on and get dressed. Then you can tell me your brilliant plan.” His mother had always claimed that there were few things that couldn’t be made better by a cup of strong tea. She also believed that fairies lived in the woods behind their house and that the BBC listened to their conversations through the wireless.
But now John was gone. He sat up and for half a second hope surged through him, his eyes flying to the bathroom, begging silently for the light to be on, for the sound of running water, for John to emerge, and smile at him, crawl back into bed, and chase the cold away. But all he heard were birds, the creak from the bathroom pipes and the soft whistle of Graham’s snoring. He was back. To the future. Nothing looked changed in his room. The same furniture, the same cardigans, the same picture of the shore in Devon.
“But don’t you see?” Kate asked, her voice rising. “You think this is about John and Mary, but it isn’t. Not really. It’s not even about you. You’re all just pawns in Magnussen’s game. You must see that . . .”
“Simon?” John closed his eyes against the late afternoon sun that was throwing shadows across the floor. “When I dream about Helmand, he’s there. Usually running. Always two steps ahead of me, shouting back at me to move my bloody arse.”
Sherlock pressed his palms into his eyes. He thought of Sutton, so arrogant, so sure of himself, so confused about the nursery rhymes. Someone else. Someone who knew he’d get to the museum in time. Hoped he’d get there. A test. An audition. But for what? For whom?
“Also good. Busy. My solve rate’s been shot to hell of course. No pay rise this year, I’m sure.” A shadow crossed his face. “Sorry.”
But now it’s noon and I tell him he has to eat, trying hard to make it a suggestion and not an order. And for once he says he’s hungry and asks for soup, which we have, and gingersnaps, which we don’t. He watches me flip through the cookbooks while I eat.
“I don’t see it, if you’re so sure, come and look yourself,” John shouted back. Sherlock’s bedroom was a total tip, as usual. “Think!”
“I don’t know, John. I don’t know.” Then he kind of disappears into his head and doesn't say anything else.
John pulled Sherlock onto his chest and kissed him back. And any thought of a measured reentry into Sherlock’s orbit fell away as he laced his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, dipping his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. He couldn’t get close enough. Sherlock snaked his hand between them and slid a finger under his waistband and John moaned against Sherlock’s lips. His hips rose slightly and Sherlock took John’s cock in his hand.
The light was still on when the cab pulled up. John climbed the stairs slowly, one hand against the wall to steady himself. The result of the whiskey or what he’d read, he wasn’t sure.
Kate stared at her phone. Fuck. So Mary was alive. And had been in contact with her parents she hadn’t seen in over ten years. And had given birth to not John’s baby in Canada. And was gone again. If she could believe her mother. Which she knew she couldn’t. Every bit of her intuition was screaming at her, reaffirming everything she already knew. That Anna/Mary was probably still in Canada.  That Sherlock Holmes was a fucking liar. And that the sound she heard right before Mrs. Ashcroft ended the call was most certainly a baby.
– no matter how hard Kate tried to move on. She knew exactly how John felt after Sherlock left. But then he’d met Mary, and she’d done for him what Chloe had done for her – she’d let the light back in. What would she have done if Sarah had miraculously reappeared? As much as she missed her, she was glad she’d never have to make that choice.
“Any sign of Kate yet?” John asked. He stood and lifted one of Sherlock’s robes from the hook behind the door.
In the lounge, they sat facing each other, John in Sherlock’s chair and McGowan in John’s. He sipped his coffee and waited for John to begin.
Sherlock watched him go and fingered his lip, brushed a hand across his chest. He’d only been here a few hours, but as every minute passed, this life felt more and more real. It seemed wise to entertain the possibility that this was not, in fact, a dream.
I’m standing by the sink, cutting strawberries for cereal when he finally appears. He smiles and my heart does a little flip-flop. Still. After all these years. He’s too thin by half and he walks slow and stiff, like his brain isn’t on speaking terms with the rest of his body yet, but at least he’s walking again. He stands beside me, his bare shoulder pressed up against mine, and kisses me on the cheek. Then he lifts his arm to turn my head and we kiss like we used to. And he tastes like toothpaste and he says I taste like strawberries. We forget the tea and the cereal and go back to bed, and even though it isn’t the same as it was before, it’s still us and we still get where we want to go, even it takes us a little longer.
Sherlock tried hard not to feel like he was being crushed from the inside, tried to remember how to breathe. “Fuck off.”
John hadn’t been back to The Blind Beggar since he began dating Mary. She’d said she was more the Starbucks/wine bar type. But Mary said a lot of things . . .
Her excitement gave way quickly to disappointment. “I’m going all the way to London just to see this DI?” She’d thought she made it clear in her proposal that there was only one person who could –
Anna Ashcroft no matter how similar they looked – it was just too much of a coincidence. And she didn’t believe in coincidences. But if it wasn’t a coincidence, what series of unlikely events would end with Moriarty’s ex-girlfriend marrying Sherlock’s friend? Boyfriend?
Sherlock bends down and licks my nipple slowly. Then he lifts his head and looks up at me, smiling. He unbuckles my belt. I try to help but he smacks my hand away. I make a sound that sounds like begging.
I stand and steer her towards the door, one hand on her back. “We’ll ring you the minute we know anything.”
“You have half an hour. Then get your arse back out here,” Lauren said. “You’re the best man, for God’s sake.”
“It’s not what I know exactly – it’s more like what we saw . . . seen.” She picked up her phone, swiped the screen and held it in front of Sherlock.
“Well, you look like crap,” she said. “Which is officially a grade higher than yesterday's death warmed over, so that’s positive.” The oxygen mask was gone – replaced by a nasal cannula, but the IV and monitors were still in place. “I hear the meds are working.”
“You will wrap up this little investigation of yours and go home. Surely there must be a miscreant moose somewhere in Canada that needs your attention.”
John and Sherlock beat Lestrade to the address in Battersea by a good ten minutes. John recognised the building as soon as they pulled up. A month ago, he and Sherlock had spent two days that felt like two weeks sitting in the lobby, tracking the comings and goings of Rhys Davies, counterfeiter and former coal miner from Pontypridd.
John frowned and took a sip of tea. “Besides, I knew you’d be out in a minute to complain about the hoovering. But Mrs. Hudson sent up biscuits and told you to behave – she’s got company coming later.”
But for some reason he didn’t mind. He found himself imagining what it would be like to tug it up over John’s head, his fingers scraping up John’s chest . . .
Sherlock sighed beside her. “Can we sit? I am not prepared to lay bare all the bits of my soul while walking by a Starbucks.”
When it was over, Lauren and Harry, blissfully happy, held hands and practically danced down the aisle together hugging and greeting their guests while
She turned around in the middle of the sidewalk, heading back downtown. This time she was not going to be distracted by scones, or scarves, or anything else Sherlock Holmes wanted to throw her way. She texted Chloe that she’d be late for dinner. Again.
And then his mouth is on John’s, and his hand is in his hair. They move together with a rhythm they learned years before. Sherlock tells him he loves him, but he doesn’t have to, because John already knows.
“Come on, Sherlock. Read the headline. Identical twins . . . double murder? You said you were bored.”
Banks had made more tea. He carried it to the bedroom on a small tray and made just enough noise to wake John.  In those few short seconds between sleep and wakefulness, John forgot about the poison and reached across the bed for Sherlock.
“The plan that lets me write up this mess in a way that doesn’t get me fired or killed by your wife.” She laid the glass on the table without taking a sip.
“No. No. How . . .” John felt as if he were back on the pavement outside Bart’s. “You drugged me and then let me think . . .”
Greg didn’t answer. He swallowed the rest of his beer, picked up the empty glasses and headed back to the bar for refills. “Whiskey this round,” John called after him.
“I had a lot of time to kill and I fell down the rabbit hole . . .” She hesitated, wondering how to tell him. Finally, she decided to just say it. “I read Mary’s texts. All of them.”
“I’ve been in Amsterdam for the last several days. I arrived home less than an hour before you knocked on my door. I’m sure there is CCTV footage somewhere that will confirm my whereabouts. There is so little assurance of privacy nowadays.”
She stepped around John and into the room. “Yes, yes, John. Whatever your little heart wants to believe.”
She hadn’t been sure what to do. She’d crept to the door of Sherlock’s bedroom, listened for a bit to the murmured tones, punctuated by Sherlock’s protests
That night, Sherlock stood at the bedroom window and stared into the darkness. How many hours had he stood like this when John was in hospital, too scared to leave him, too restless to sleep. He knew John’s poisoning had been a test. He’d passed it, barely, in the nick of time and with entirely too much help. And now he waited, impatient and afraid for what came next.
“I could take the couch.” John dropped his hands to his side. Took a breath and stepped back. He needed the space to think. Sherlock’s proximity and the whiskey were making him fuzzy.
“Yes, yes, Mycroft – cautionary tale. I know.” Sherlock stood and Mycroft retreated back to the fireplace.
“I think you’re wrong.” She reached out and rested one hand on his knee. “I think he loved you more than you knew.”
John nodded toward Sherlock’s chest. “That. You. All elbows and knees and cheekbones. Like we’re about to discuss why Mrs. Hudson never hoovers on Thursday or why Lestrade can’t figure out his arse from his elbow. Like everything is . . .”
Mycroft sighed, and John knew everything he needed to know. “I wish I had more for you, Doctor Watson. Moriarty knows how the police and the government, even my humble office, operate. He knows how to avoid us, taunt us, track us, and bait us. I am confident that we will find Sherlock, but it won’t be easy. He may have to…endure.”
Sherlock, his voice dripping with condescension, replied, “John, even if you were willing to understand, which you clearly are not, it would hardly be within my power to wrap your limited mind around my position on this issue.”
John pursed his lips trying to suppress a smile, unwilling to take such open delight in another’s suffering, but ultimately failed and joined Sherlock in snickering at the son’s expense. “God,” John remarked, “he was literally struck dumb. His mouth was working so hard but nothing came out. He looked like a great bloody fish on the deck of a boat!” John opened and closed his mouth several times in rapid succession by way of demonstration and that only made them laugh harder. The two were tittering like children, near tears with amusement.
“If we can ascertain that the killer is playing a game with me, that this is more about entertainment than anything else, it can give us a lens through which to view his work.”
John sat in Lestrade’s office watching Sherlock like a hawk. Shortly after he had arrived at New Scotland Yard, he and Lestrade’s team watched as Moriarty and the man they now knew was Sebastian Moran entered the room where Sherlock was being held. For better or worse, the video quality was excellent and provided crystal-clear sound. For a few moments, there was a flurry of activity and chatter at the Yard, Lestrade and his people talking over each other and trying to glean any information from the video that they could. When Moran released Sherlock’s bonds, however, and the consulting detective collapsed with a groan on the floor, the Yard fell silent. They watched, struck dumb, as Moran picked Sherlock up, then punched him hard enough that he fell over. John hoped no one else noticed that Sherlock’s y-fronts were soaked through.
“Doubtful, John. Moriarty certainly likes to make me dance and play his games, but this is a little theatrical, even for him.”
The scene John discovered as he entered the flat was horrific. Clutter was the norm, but this was destruction on a massive scale. John’s chair was overturned and the kitchen table was broken clean in two. Papers and bits of equipment were strewn about the area, hardly leaving any part of the floor free of debris. The most disturbing detail was the blood spatter. John’s experience as a soldier, a doctor, and a crime blogger told him that it wasn’t nearly enough blood to put someone’s life in jeopardy, but it wasn’t
John looked at his friend, still lying down, eyes closed, affect entirely unchanged. John wondered if he was hearing things. “Sherlock…” he started, unsure where the sentence was going.
John chuckled and held up his hands defensively. He doubted Sherlock would ever make good on that particular threat, but the message was loud and clear regardless. John was momentarily distracted by kissing his way across Sherlock’s kneecap, but an impatient grunt brought him back to the issue at hand, as it were. He smeared lube on his fingers and warmed it for a moment before gently bringing his hand to Sherlock’s hole. The detective stiffened but then nodded, knowing he would have to encourage John to continue. John took his time, much more time than Sherlock would’ve liked, but eventually one finger breeched Sherlock just slightly. Sherlock keened, a desperate sound that made John’s cock harder than ever. Before long, John’s finger was moving in and out with ease, and he added a second finger to begin to stretch Sherlock in earnest. Crooking his fingers a bit, John was rewarded with a shout that reverberated around the room.
“Yes John, do keep up.” Sherlock waved his hand impatiently. “More importantly, if we wish to catch him before he kills every Sherlock-esque person in London, now we know what we need to do.”
” Neither man knew exactly what Sherlock was asking for, but it didn’t matter. John thrust fractionally harder and gripped Sherlock’s hip hard enough to bruise.
“Yeah, they had those funny old hats like Sherlock had on in the newspaper that time. What’s it called…a deerstalker. They had those on. Couldn’t see much of their faces under those.”
The approaching sirens offered a small measure of comfort that Mrs. Hudson would be seen to shortly. “The smaller man,” John pressed, “do you remember anything else about him? Even something that seems insignificant could help.”
When it came time to confront the younger brother, found behind a condemned building, Sherlock was so sure that he would confess and be led away without a fight that he reacted just a hair too slowly to the gun that the suspect pulled from his waistband. Fortunately, John knew better and leapt into action, quite literally, knocking Sherlock to the ground and just out of the path of a bullet. Lestrade and his team rounded the corner into the alley just then, took the brother down, and led him away without further incident.
John chose not to take the bait. “I’m not talking about my living situation. I’m talking about going back to my life before you. I know your enormous brain has already deduced everything there is to know about what my life was like in the weeks before Mike introduced us. Don’t act like you have no idea that I was about two steps from putting my gun in my mouth.” John’s eyes, faintly rimmed in red and burning with intensity, met Sherlock’s without blinking. John willed Sherlock to understand, to see.
He began to notice something that he thought he was making up at first. Moriarty seemed to be looking directly in the camera now and again. It could have been mere chance the first few times. Then, rotating his body fully and staring into the camera, Moriarty grinned broadly and flicked his eyebrows up, as if to entice or interest a viewer. By then, John was certain of something he suspected from the moment he clicked on the video link: the torture might be for Sherlock, but the video was for John. Moriarty meant what he wrote on the blog. This was meant to hurt. Both of them.
“STOP!” he cried out. “PLEASE—” He couldn’t see either of his captors, but he heard small indications of movement. The water had stopped for now. He could’ve cried with relief.
John blinked a few times and sat up a bit in an effort to wake up. “’The one with the nose’? Oh, you mean Abby. Right.” John absently ran a hand over his face and up through his hair. “I don’t know. I liked her. But I think she’d had quite enough of me after a few months.”
“You’ll have to endure, too, John. When we do get Sherlock out of there, he’ll need you more than ever.”
“I told you to shut up because I didn’t want you to tell me ‘no’. I didn’t want to hear your doubts or your apologies. ‘I’m not gay.’ Again and again. And afterwards, when I realised how far it went, I couldn’t bear to look at you.” Sherlock tried to turn his head but found himself unable, though his muscles groaned in protest anyway. He took a steadying breath. “I didn’t want to see how disgusted you would be. Or how much you would pity me. ‘Poor Sherlock, the sociopath who thinks anyone would want him.’” His voice lowered to a whisper. “I was so…afraid.”
“What am I supposed to say, John?” Affecting a treacly tone, Sherlock exclaimed, “‘Oh darling, I’m ever so glad we’ve found true love. Let’s retire to the country’?” His normal tone returned. “I hardly think a few kids and a dog are in our future, certainly not in mine. You needed distracting and a physiological release. I simply determined the most expedient way to provide both. It won’t do for you to get all maudlin about it.”
As the silence continued to stretch out, John thought about the first time he came here with Sherlock just after they met. He remembered their awkward exchange where Sherlock had told John that he was “married to his work,” trying to rebuff John gently. In spite of himself, John let out a chuckle. Sherlock’s eyes darted over to him.
Sherlock was only awake and aware for some of what followed. There was an explosion of pain in his left hand, maybe struck with a hammer or repeatedly crushed under a boot. He was given water to drink. A few bites of something sweet, chewed and swallowed on autopilot. More pain, his feet this time. Water on his face, not like before. Probably tears.
John’s dreams were not kind to him. He went from bleeding in the sand, certain that help would never come, to the alley where they had confronted the brother. His mind supplied him with a perfect record of the previous afternoon, except in his dream, he’s too late. He doesn’t push Sherlock out of the way. He doesn’t notice the gun quickly enough. He’s too slow, too slow, and the bullet rips through Sherlock like he’s made out of tissue paper.
“I know…” John tried to be careful with his words. “I know you never meant for me to hear what you said. It should’ve been your choice. I’m sorry Moriarty took that away from you.”
“I don’t really know, dear. I heard quite a scuffle coming from upstairs, and after the row you and Sherlock had earlier, I thought maybe he was having some sort of tantrum, you know how he gets.” John nodded sympathetically and gestured for her to continue. “Well I opened my door and saw two men dragging Sherlock down the stairs. I must have called out or screamed or something, because one of the men shoved me back into my flat, where I fell. I must’ve hit my head because everything’s a bit fuzzy until you found me.”
John felt as though his entire body were coming alive at the words falling from Sherlock’s lips. He snogged Sherlock some more, then broke the kiss and forced himself to take a deep breath. “Get your kit off and be in your bed in 30 seconds.” Without a word, Sherlock began frantically untying his shoes and stripping his trousers and pants off, clearly intending to get there much sooner than the provided deadline. John strode back to Sherlock’s room trying to seem in control, but as soon as he was out of sight, he practically ripped the rest of his own clothes off.
John, afraid that he would scare Sherlock by either reciprocating or not reciprocating, was frozen in place. He had no interest in lying to himself about whether he wanted this, and his long-dormant
John was glad that he hadn’t eaten since the night before. He felt overcome by nausea but willed himself not to vomit. He kept his eyes on the screen, watching Moran and Moriarty leave, although not before Moriarty looked at the camera and winked, of course. After Moriarty and Moran left, the only sound was Sherlock, breathing raggedly. John hoped that he would pass out from the pain or from exhaustion, but he was clearly still conscious, at least conscious enough to be aware of how awful everything was.
John met her eyes and nodded, simultaneously thanking her for the information, acknowledging that he understood her meaning, and ending the conversation. He welcomed the EMTs into the flat and gave them the rundown of what had happened, leaving out the part about the psychopaths who broke in and kidnapped Sherlock. A simple fall at home, not that unusual for an older woman. John nodded once to Mrs. Hudson to signal his departure, then stepped out onto the sidewalk and brought his mobile to his ear.
Of course, trying not to think of something – or someone – is the quickest way to have that be the only thing on your mind. When he realised that it would be impossible to ignore the direction his thoughts were taking him, Sherlock allowed it to happen. He took short trips to his mind palace, to the room where he kept John. A large filing cabinet for all of the times that John had surprised him. A thick file on John’s moral character. Shelves and boxes and drawers and pictures, ordered and re-ordered over time, the room kept tidy but clearly well-used.
When they arrived at the crime scene, Sherlock gave John’s hand a squeeze before they parted and exited the cab. John smiled to himself, wondering how Sherlock could claim to be uninterested in or incapable of romance. That simple gesture said so much.
“And what about you? It seems to me that your fear of being as emotional as the rest of us ludicrous people is holding you hostage well enough.”
John composed himself and called out, “If you wouldn’t mind coming back later, Mrs. Hudson, we have a lot of snogging to do!”
“No, no, Mrs. Hudson, please don’t move. Lie still.” John put a gentle hand on her shoulder to encourage her to stay where she was while he dialed 999 with his other. Once services were on their way, John asked her what happened.
Ex-Military made several trips to and from the room, bringing in a large table and other equipment. Sherlock couldn’t see what he was doing as he set up, but it sounded elaborate, or at least time-consuming. By the time Ex-Military released Sherlock from his position on the chair, Sherlock had imagined dozens of scenarios, but perhaps he should have known where this was going.
“Sherlock!” he called, as if gently chiding him. “Don’t go leaving us again so soon. It’s time to play and it’s no fun if you’re not here for it.” When Sherlock didn’t respond, Moriarty continued. “It looks like you couldn’t keep your feet. Sebastian here is going to set you to rights so we can have a bit more fun. I would warn you about the pain, but I don’t know what the point would be.”
John rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I’m sure I’ll crease up any moment. The bloke who’s been murdering ‘you’ is just so…
John grinned. “Okay.” Without wasting another second, John dove back in for another kiss, this time pulling Sherlock flush against his own body. He stripped off his own coat and dropped it on the floor, then moved his hands to the bottom of his jumper.
The rage in Moriarty’s eyes was snuffed out in an instant, his face returning to the cool amusement he so often effected. “Poor Sherlock, we really must’ve scrambled you. It’s a shame, you’re normally almost as smart as I am.” He nodded to Sebastian, who returned to Sherlock’s side, cattle prod in hand.
He heard Moriarty move closer, his voice coming only inches from Sherlock’s ear. “I’m told this one is particularly dangerous. Do tell me if it gets to be too much, won’t you?” The scraping of the chair and rustle of movement told Sherlock that Moriarty was getting comfortable for this next show.
, but have you ever thought about being with anyone? Like that?” John asked, knowing that he wasn’t exactly being clear but also knowing that Sherlock would catch his meaning.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed that he had to explain. “My range of motion is significantly reduced. I’ve been advised not to move my left arm significantly until the threat of dislocating it again is diminished, and the tear in my right shoulder needs similar treatment in order to heal.”
been a prick and you’ve been happy to wedge your way into my life thus far.” Sherlock’s low voice became nearly a whisper. “I didn’t ask you to save me, John.”
John brought his hand to his face and wiped his palm from forehead to chin as if to clear his vaguely-annoyed expression. Nodding, he replied, “I know, Sherlock. You’ve been clear on that since the first case. But haven’t you ever…” John shook his head, knowing the answer to his question already and knowing how stupid it would sound to ask. He asked anyway. “Haven’t you ever wanted more than The Work?”
John gently tapped Sherlock’s arm to get him to rinse. He went back in for another round of shampooing to get the rest of the grime and oil out of Sherlock’s normally-pristine hair. Sherlock let a pleased sigh fall from his lips. John’s heart leapt, though he immediately schooled his features and chided himself. Even so, the intimacy of the moment was hard to ignore.
speak. In that case, let’s see if we can draw some more sounds from you.” Moriarty nodded his head toward the door, a motion so subtle it would have been easy to miss. The door opened again and Ex-Military came into the room carrying a chair and a large duffel bag. He placed the chair two metres in front of Sherlock, then approached the kneeling detective, dropping the bag and squatting down to open it. Moriarty grinned and took a seat in the chair, crossing one leg over the other and resting his hands on his legs.
“After what I did and said, John, after the way you looked at me that day, I knew I could never let myself be so cruel to you again. I needed to find a way to talk to you, to be open with you. I don’t really know how to do it, but I want to try.”
Sherlock was at a loss. John seemed to need comfort or reassurance or some sort of emotional support, but that wasn’t really what Sherlock excelled at. He hoped that levity would at least help. “There are well over eight million people in London. If half of them are women, and half of those women are of an age appropriate for a relationship with you, that’s still two million people. Even if you went on three dates a day, it would still take you almost two thousand years to get through every woman.”
John merely blew out a laugh and laid back on the couch once again. “Yep,” he agreed, but made no move to get water. Sherlock allowed himself to smile for a moment as he picked up his violin and began playing a joyful but sedate tune that John didn’t recognise. John allowed his eyes to close. While listening to Sherlock compose was grating and listening to him work through his frustrations was bloody awful, getting to hear Sherlock play just for pleasure was perhaps John’s favorite sound in the world. He told himself he’d just listen for a few minutes before getting ready for bed properly.
John had Sherlock face the spray, as his back was still not ready for the pressure of the water. Sherlock was positioned so that the water fell on his chest, and he needed to lean forward only slightly to get his head wet. Once the water was warm enough, John had Sherlock wet his hair, then stood behind him and went about working in Sherlock’s poncy shampoo. It was a delicate balance, trying to be gentle and soothing with his motions while also keeping things professional and pragmatic. Sherlock really did need his hair washed, and John wasn’t going to use this as an opportunity to come onto him. He didn’t even know if that sort of thing was in the cards for them at all. For now, the least he could do was help his friend.
“Another one! Another me! A dead one!” Sherlock exclaimed, sharing the news as if he had hit the lotto or discovered a new element.
“I’m sure your lot have had their eyes on Moriarty for months now, at least as much as it’s possible to. Do you really not have anything to go on? Last known address? Bolt holes? Known associates? There’s got to be something.”
John offered a wan smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thank you for that helpful analysis, Sherlock,” he replied, exhaustion creeping into his voice. “It’s just…” John hesitated for a moment, as if unsure about whether to delve further into the conversation. After a small sigh, he continued. “It’s disheartening to realise that I’ll go on being ‘bachelor John Watson’ forever. That this is all there is, and I’ll never find someone to be with that way.” John briefly turned his head to glance sidelong at Sherlock and huffed a humourless laugh. “I wish I could be like you, y’know, ‘caring is not an advantage’ and all that. Thriving by being unattached and emotionless. I just can’t be like you.” He let his head fall back to rest on the couch again, closing his eyes once more.
thoughts stampeded back into his mind as if he’d never tried to crush that fantasy in the first place. Even so, kissing Sherlock back felt unbearably risky. What if this was just a ploy to get John to forget about their argument? What if Sherlock was trying to manipulate him? What if this was something that meant nothing to Sherlock, and John would tip his hand by kissing him back?
With a sigh, John returned to the couch and sat next to Sherlock, mirroring his friend’s position. Forcing a smile on his face, John decided to go for humor to break up the black mood they’d created for themselves. “Well, it’s not all bad, I suppose,” he offered. “With both of us being so shit at relationships, at least we have each other to annoy endlessly.”
Fortunately, he supposed, Ex-Military seemed well-versed in how to perform this particular type of torture without actually killing him, but his brain and his body were telling him that he was dying, he was dying right this minute, and he needed to get away. Every nerve in his body, every cell was alight with terror.
By the time they got back to Baker Street, John was clearly ready to blow his top, and Sherlock was growing increasingly resentful that John had escorted him home like a wayward child. John said nothing until they entered the flat and the door shut firmly behind them.
It took John over an hour to retrace his route back to 221B with a few bags of groceries in tow. Taking a deep breath outside the door to the flat, he finally bit the bullet and went in. After all, maybe Sherlock wouldn’t even be home. It might be fine.
Although John was initially fine letting Sherlock dictate the pace and nature of their relationship, he soon realized that he’d have to nudge Sherlock along in some ways. Sherlock rarely sought out affection or sex, but was enthusiastically amenable when John initiated it, so John began to initiate it more and more. Gentle touches in the kitchen, a kiss with a cup of tea, an enticing text whilst on the way home from the clinic. After a while, Sherlock began making his own tentative overtures. John found his hesitation endearing but resolved to make Sherlock understand that he was very much welcome to snog John whenever he liked.
Guiding Sherlock back to the couch, John gently removed the detective’s suit jacket, being mindful of his shoulders. He was tempted to simply rip Sherlock’s shirt open, but it probably cost more than a month’s rent and happened to be the too-tight aubergine one that John could never ignore. He quickly traveled down the placket, undoing the buttons as swiftly as his trembling fingers would allow. Releasing the cuffs, John finally got Sherlock out of the shirt entirely and resumed their kiss. He pressed into Sherlock eagerly, pushing him just enough to make Sherlock sit on the couch, allowing John to climb atop him.
“Exactly like me, John? Surely you haven’t missed how his ears are a completely different shape to mine. And it’s obvious that his hair was styled to look similar to mine, but wouldn’t appear this way under normal circumstances.”
John had almost drifted back off when Sherlock spoke again. “What happened with…” He faded out for a moment, clearly thinking. “The…the one with the nose?”
It turned out that Sherlock was a responsive lover, and John’s ego was well and truly stroked as Sherlock groaned, whimpered, shuddered, and flailed. After a few minutes, just as John was getting comfortable with this particular activity, Sherlock gasped out, “Wait, John—wait.” John immediately let Sherlock’s glorious cock fall from his lips and hand. John could see Sherlock’s chest was heaving as though he’d climbed two dozen flights of stairs.
Sherlock raised his glass again. “To John Watson, who values manners as much as he does solving crimes.” John’s mouth pressed into a line, somehow betraying both annoyance and good humor, and he joined the toast. It was unusual to see Sherlock both pleased with the outcome of a case and in relatively good shape, physically and mentally. Normally, the more satisfying the case, the more sleepless nights and meal refusals that were involved. But this case, for whatever reason, offered the benefits without the manic damages.
John stared at Sherlock for a second. “I had no idea you actually intended to follow medical advice.”
“Well mine might be a bit much, so we’ll balance each other out, as usual,” John replied, then held out his hand expectantly.
Moriarty pushed Sebastian out of the way and stooped down to stare Sherlock in the face. “Why now? Why are you playing the game
Mycroft arrived to 221B only minutes after Mrs. Hudson was loaded into an ambulance and taken to hospital. She had tried to refuse, but John insisted that she be checked over quite thoroughly, just to be safe. Lestrade’s team pulled up shortly thereafter, getting straight to work collecting any forensic evidence from the flat and hallway. John suspected that Moriarty and whoever the other man where would not have left anything behind, but he welcomed the effort regardless.
The next morning, John awoke slowly, his memories of the prior evening slotting back into place in jarring succession. The second body, the argument at the precinct and the bigger row at home, then…out of nowhere, lips and tongue and teeth and good lord. It was deeply unsettling to have the hottest experience of John’s life take place between a painful fight and an even more painful conclusion to the evening. Why had Sherlock left without a word? Did he regret what happened? Did he not enjoy it? Was he embarrassed? John’s questions spiraled inside his mind. He began to wonder if Sherlock had been entirely willing. Had John somehow taken advantage of Sherlock? Was it even possible given that Sherlock had initiated every single step?
The pair sat in silence for a few minutes. When John felt a chill go through him and realised the fire was nearly out, he made the herculean effort required to go put more wood on and bring the fire back to life. In a few short minutes, the room was beginning to warm nicely, and John returned to the sofa. Sherlock lifted his legs languidly, replacing them on John’s lap as they both settled into their previous position.
“I know you…care for me, John. But I don’t think even you could see any logic to me saying things that we both know would harm our partnership, possibly even destroy it.”
Sherlock, grateful for the out, graced John with a small chuckle. He stood suddenly, his sullen affect abruptly replaced with his usual cool demeanor. “Better hydrate, John,” he announced, the note of imperiousness offering a comforting familiarity to both men. “I fear we’ve gone very deep into the bottle indeed.”
When he finally came to a third time, Sherlock felt as though a great deal of time had passed, although he had no way to know if that was accurate. The room he was in had no source of natural light and no clock, so there was no indication of the time. The space itself had an industrial feel to it, though it was cleaner than most operating theatres. The ceiling was somewhat low with several fluorescent lights throughout the room. Sherlock’s best estimate for the size of the room was perhaps six meters by six meters. There was one door, obviously quite robust.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. When he continued, his voice was low and wretched. “When I….approached you after the second body, when I—when we—“ He inhaled again and let the breath out as slowly as his trembling body would allow. “I haven’t had much cause to explain myself to anyone, and certainly not my
After staring at his ceiling for far too long, John decided that he couldn’t justify lying in bed self-indulgently moping for any longer. Rising and preparing to go through his typical morning routine, he found himself both dreading his next encounter with Sherlock and consumed with curiosity as to how Sherlock would act towards him.
John allowed himself a moment to take in the information Mycroft rattled off, then heaved a sigh. He had known Mycroft would be thorough. Mycroft was the only person he knew who was smarter than Sherlock, and even that was debatable. John felt torn between the hope of knowing Mycroft was chasing every lead and the devastation he felt that Mycroft seemed to be hitting one dead end after another. He looked at the floor for a long moment before meeting Mycroft’s eyes. His voice came out low, soft, and dangerous. “He’s beyond insane, Mycroft. This is a man who doesn’t care who lives or dies, who gets hurt. He will go to any length to achieve his ends, and we don’t even know what those ends are. We don’t know if he intends to keep Sherlock alive—.” John’s voice broke for a moment before he collected himself. “No secrets, Mycroft Holmes. I’m serious. If I find out that you’ve withheld even the slightest piece of relevant information from me, I will come for you. And I don’t mean an ear-bashing. Am I being clear enough for you, Mycroft?”
He let his head fall back to rest on the couch, his face pointed towards the ceiling. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, deciding not to give one single shit. “I’m lonely, I guess.”
Mycroft spent a great deal of time on his phone in the foyer, seeming to coordinate with many different individuals or agencies. Half the time, he simply received a message and glanced at it before pocketing his device, not even bothering to reply.
“You don’t know that, Sherlock, and neither do I.” John exhaled heavily and wiped his hand down his face as if trying to remove his expression. After a moment, he continued, “Just please don’t make me find out. I know I can’t tie you to a chair and keep you from being an idiot about your own safety, at least not forever, but I’m asking you as a friend…please…” John shook his head as if deciding against something mid-sentence, then turned to walk into the kitchen.
“I’ve got you, Sherlock. I’ve got you.” John continued to caress anywhere he could reach, from Sherlock’s chest down to his feet. He encouraged Sherlock to hook his legs around John’s waist, then began tentatively thrusting. Sherlock grunted in what seemed to be discomfort for a moment, then let out a long and low moan. Soon enough, Sherlock’s erection, which had flagged a bit, came roaring back. John’s strokes became longer and surer, his pace steady. He wanted to make this good for Sherlock, better than good, and that meant figuring out how to make his boyfriend (boyfriend!) come so hard he forgot his own name. John grabbed a pillow from next to Sherlock and shoved it under Sherlock’s bum, experimenting with angles until he made Sherlock shout again. A grin spread across John’s features and he made sure to maintain that exact angle, his pace increasingly little by little.
“Stop pretending that the emotional distance you keep between yourself and everyone else is some stroke of genius, and that everyone else suffers from either some sort of repulsive moral failing or a pitiful disability,” he fumed.
A series of gasps and shuddering breaths heralded Sherlock’s release, which made Sherlock nearly levitate off the bed. His hole clamped down on John’s cock, wringing a cry from the man and pulling him along over the edge with Sherlock. It went on long enough that John briefly wondered whether he would ever stop coming, before his mind whited out completely. Trying to catch his breath, he gingerly pulled out of Sherlock and half-collapsed next to him on the bed. After a moment, he glanced over at Sherlock to say something moderately witty but his voice caught in his throat. Sherlock still lay on his back, chest heaving. Although his brow was dotted with sweat, John could discern tear tracks running from the corners of Sherlock’s eyes. He opened his mouth again but thought better of it and gently pulled Sherlock to him, ever mindful of his shoulders. The detective curled into John’s chest, seeming so small in that moment. John snuggled closer, wrapping himself around Sherlock as though to shield him from the world, and stroked his hair until Sherlock fell asleep.
Two hours and thirty-two minutes after John learnt of Sherlock’s abduction, Lestrade’s team was leaving the flat. Mycroft had long since disappeared, but true to his word, had assigned one of his people to update John on the hour or sooner. So far, none of the updates had been of any use, but John was grateful for them regardless. Lestrade lingered at the door to the flat, apparently examining his shoes. John glanced over at him and nodded. “I’ll ring you if I hear anything, yeah?” he offered the DI, knowing full well that he’d have no reason to call. Lestrade simply looked at John, dipped his head once in acknowledgement, then left.
Finally sitting up on the sofa, Sherlock looked at John. “Are you the model by which I should attempt to mold my reactions and behavior? Should I be endeavoring to weep at the movies, smile blithely at every person I pass on the street, find a moronic-but-pleasant girl and tell her that I love her
Sherlock made sure to put on his most neutral expression, forcing his voice to remain even. “If you already know it’s not my area, why do you ask?”
Sighing with the realisation that this wouldn’t be a single-day case, John stood and crossed his arms over his chest.
“I know I must be a horrific disappointment to you, John. First, a selfish and odd friend, then…then I managed to ruin our friendship twice over in less than 12 hours. Not exactly what I had in mind for this week.” He tried to chuckle but the pain was unbearable. It took him a moment to collect himself. “I’d like to think that my brother’s people will burst through the door any minute and I’ll be home for tea, but I’m not so sure that’s how this ends.” The effort of speaking was wearing on him. He paused. “I suppose…I just wanted to tell you, John, that you’re a good man. A good friend. The truest one I’ve ever had, not that there’s much competition. I know I’m not enough for you, but you’ve always been enough for me.” Sherlock’s ankles wobbled as his legs began to go. He stopped talking, using all his concentration to try to stay up.
Sherlock swallowed but kept his eyes closed, and John gently guided Sherlock’s head back to facing forward. John knew that the hair-washing bit was well and truly finished, but he couldn’t bring himself to end it. The intimacy was intoxicating. After another few moments of silence, he felt Sherlock trembling almost imperceptibly. The water was quite warm so John guessed it wasn’t from a chill. When Sherlock spoke, his voice came out in a hoarse murmur.
“Indian,” Sherlock affirmed without looking at John, striding across the flat to place his glass on the side table before picking up his violin. John knew that he was being sent for food, and after all this time with Sherlock, he didn’t even mind what anyone else would likely consider a moderately rude interaction.
do. He ruminated on the events of the day, grimly amused at the realisation that only hours before he had been consumed with rage and heartache, feelings that had felt so overwhelming at the time. Now that he was faced with Sherlock’s kidnapping and the spectre of serious harm or even death for his best friend, their row that morning felt far less important.
[Well, most of it. All of it, really, if you exclude the snogging. But even then, this is the first time I did that with someone who mattered to me. –SH]
Sherlock sat there and scowled for a moment. John looked at him, attempting to remain neutral. When it became clear that Sherlock wasn’t going to continue the conversation, John got up to make some tea. Returning a few minutes later, he placed Sherlock’s cup in the consulting detective’s hands, then sat down with his own. He allowed the silence to stretch between them, sensing that Sherlock had things he needed to say. He could wait.
“I wanted to tell you that I understand why you pushed me away. I didn’t get it at the time, but I do now.” He could feel Sherlock tensing under his hands. They hadn’t
Sherlock finally relented and John tore the item free from its wrappings with zero grace. Sherlock feigned offense. In the paper, John discovered a box containing a memory stick. John cocked his head in confusion and glanced over at Sherlock.
. Wouldn’t you say it’s working?” He raised an eyebrow at John, challenging him to disagree with Sherlock’s assessment.
At Christmas, the pair begged off from the Holmes family dinner and hosted a small do at the flat on Christmas Eve, reserving the day itself for the two of them with no obligations or interruptions. Mrs. Hudson wisely decided to go celebrate with her sister. John wore his most horrible festive jumper and strung lights around the flat, gently ribbing Sherlock for wanting Indian takeaway on Christmas. Sherlock decided to indulge John by wearing the absurd little hat from the cracker John insisted he open, and he knew John was cheekily taking pictures of him every chance he got. After dinner, Sherlock nervously toyed with a small parcel wrapped in tacky paper.
For his part, John felt his heart sink at Sherlock’s words. He told himself that his reaction was purely sympathetic, feeling sorry for his friend. After all, what else would it be? John had long ago locked up the little voice of curiosity in his head that wondered if he and Sherlock would ever be anything more. John wasn’t gay and Sherlock wasn’t…maybe anything? No reason to spend any time going down that road.
Ignoring Sherlock and looking past him to Lestrade, John asked, “Is there anything else we need to do here? Any information we haven’t assessed?”
After ages and ages of physio, Sherlock’s shoulders healed well, with only a minor limitation to his range of motion on one side. His hand improved as well, though much more slowly. It was still unclear whether it would ever be the same again. One afternoon, when John arrived home earlier than usual from his shift, he heard Sherlock practicing the violin. It sounded far better than anything John would ever be able to produce, but he knew it wasn’t up to Sherlock’s standards. He paused on the steps. Sherlock gave an angry grunt, and no more music followed. When John entered the flat, Sherlock was seated in his chair as though he’d been engrossed in some data analysis for ages, but John could clearly see his bow snapped in half peeking out from under the table. The next day, John received a parcel from Mycroft with a new bow, which he snuck into Sherlock’s violin case without a word.
John woke up with a scream that wouldn’t come out. He was covered in sweat, his shoulder throbbing in pain, confused and terrified and ready to fight. Then he heard it. Violin. Quiet, almost out of the range of his hearing. John gulped a few breaths and forced himself to calm down. As his heartrate slowed and the panic leeched from him, he strained to hear what Sherlock was playing.
“Unfortunately, no. We at least have something to go off of, but it will take some work to see if this gets us anywhere. The most important thing right now is to see if the video itself gives us any clues as to Sherlock’s whereabouts.”
,” the last word coming out with some disdain. “I don’t know if I have the words for this. But I want to try to explain.”
Sherlock hummed in response, then grabbed his mobile from where it had fallen on the floor earlier. He sat in his chair and typed for a moment, then John’s device beeped. John looked down.
For his part, Sherlock seemed delighted. The more he examined the body and the crime scene, the more his eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning. John had long since abandoned trying to get Sherlock to show any decorum when dealing with a murder, but this unabashed glee was almost enough for him to try regardless. Realising that Sherlock was too much in his own world, John swiveled to look at Lestrade. “Well?” he asked, notes of agitation and accusation in his voice.
When John was about two hours outside of London, Mycroft confirmed that they had found the correct location and were moving in now. Somehow being on the way there but not having arrived was worse than simply watching it all happen from 221B. John kept his eyes trained on his mobile, the video feed revealing none of the chaos that was sure to start any moment. After several more minutes of nothing, John could hear background noise through the feed, muffled yelling, gunshots. Sherlock began to stir. John’s heartrate picked up and he gripped the phone tighter. There was a loud boom and the feed went dead.
Apparently it didn’t matter anyway. Sherlock let himself believe that he and John were together in every way that mattered, and that they would continue in this fashion until violence or old age did away with them. But John had managed to end that fantasy with three simple words – “It’s not enough.” – and now Sherlock was forced to come to terms with reality. He was preparing to enter a thoroughly self-indulgent sulk when John stirred a bit and spoke again.
Straddling Sherlock meant that John could control the kiss more effectively, plus he no longer had to crane his neck up at the tall git. He was simultaneously desperate to touch all of Sherlock that he could reach and unable to take his hands away from Sherlock’s face, neck, and hair. Sherlock sighed and trembled as John continued snogging him within an inch of his life. John tried to pour all his affection, his respect, his desire, his longing, his relief into the kiss. He needed Sherlock to understand that this wasn’t a one-off or some trial run. John wasn’t going to flee back to his bedroom and have a sexuality crisis. The past month was plenty of time for John to sort his feelings out and he had no intention of giving Sherlock up now that he finally had him.
“Thank you,” he replied cordially, then took Sherlock’s elbow and manoeuvered him out of the room and down the hall toward the exit. Sherlock allowed himself to be led, wondering exactly what John intended. He understood John’s concerns about Sherlock using himself as bait for a killer, as unfounded as those concerns were, but he didn’t plan to allow John to dissuade him from this course of action.
Sherlock tried to stay calm. He really did. But when the first stream of water poured over the cloth covering his nose and mouth, Sherlock’s amygdala took over. He thrashed about violently despite his restraints. When he wasn’t choking or coughing, he was screaming. He knew what was happening, objectively, but it didn’t seem to matter. His body wasn’t listening to him.
“Your body has grown noticeably tenser over the last few minutes. Your jaw is clenched. You’re squeezing my foot enough for it to be uncomfortable. I’d deduce something but I seem to be less capable of gathering data than usual. Hence the question.”
They spent over an hour poring over the crime scene photos, witness statements, and every scrap of evidence from both cases so far. The killer was clearly well-versed in forensics and basic criminology, and was unlikely to make a foolish mistake that would lead to his immediate identification and capture. Sherlock’s only real lead was that the bodies were discovered in a church and a brothel – the last two places on Earth that Sherlock would normally be found.
After Ex-Military left him tied to the chair, Sherlock realised he was in far worse trouble than he had initially understood. The stoicism and detachment that he so often relied upon when things became…complicated…well, it wasn’t working. His mind, his techniques, his
It wasn’t until John was already in the cab to head back to New Scotland Yard that he realised he hadn’t even examined the body.
In the months that followed, John was surprised both by how much and by how little changed between him and Sherlock. John still did the shopping, made the tea, and tidied the flat. Sherlock sulked if they went too long between cases and gave up both food and sleep if a puzzle were interesting enough. Last they heard, Moriarty was in Belarus keeping a safe distance from a variety of crimes and schemes that were clearly his work. They knew it would be foolish to assume they’d be free of him forever, but John breathed a little easier with each passing day. Seeing every CCTV camera in London follow them anytime they left the flat was oddly comforting as well.
Sherlock knew he was using this information to distract himself from the important things. He was bound with thick shackles fastening his wrists and ankles behind his back and attached to the floor. The length and arrangement of the chain was such that he was forced to kneel on the floor. His arms were drawn back taut, his shoulders under strain no matter how he tried to settle himself. He was naked except for his pants. He had no mobile. And there was a large drain in the centre of the floor.
The problem of the lividity and rigor mortis was interesting but without more information about where the man had been killed and the conditions in which the body was kept before being brought to the church, it would be hard to puzzle out the exact timeline of events. Sherlock, annoyed at the lack of answers but still intrigued – perhaps more so – decided to spend some time in his mind palace organising the information about the case so far. He and John returned to Baker Street where Sherlock took up residence on the couch, lying down with his eyes closed, his hands pressed together under his chin as if in prayer. That particular position had never bothered John before, but after the events of the evening, the image was a bit too funerary for John’s liking. He decided to get some rest while he still could, and trudged up to bed.
Opening his eyes, he could almost see John there with him. The words fell from Sherlock’s mouth without his mind’s permission, hardly more than a whisper.
Sherlock couldn’t see all of the implements it held, but it was clearly a torture kit. Blades, blunt instruments, surgical tools, you name it. Sherlock idly wondered which one of those tools would be the one that finally broke him. Despite his elephantine ego, he was ultimately a rational man; he knew that everyone, including the great Sherlock Holmes, had a limit. It was just a matter of time before Ex-Military found it.
John felt his heart ache, but he smiled at his friend. “You’re doing a perfectly fine job so far. Better than me, that’s for sure. I’m shit at this open communication thing.”
More tears came to his eyes, spilling down across his temples and into his grimy hair. “In the morning, I didn’t want to hear you say that you were moving out, or even the best case, that we could move on as though it never happened. I knew I couldn’t do that. Pretend things…were the same. So I pushed you away. I wanted to hurt you bad enough that you’d be furious with me rather than ashamed. And I succeeded. I hated myself for doing it, but I did it anyway.”
Sherlock seemed to go offline for a long moment. John waited patiently but soon became concerned when Sherlock remained unmoving and unblinking. He reached out and touched the detective’s hand. “Sherlock?”
John knew he should eat something if only to keep his strength up for whatever shit storm was coming. He made tea on autopilot, and had to stop himself from setting out a second cup for Sherlock. He closed his eyes and swallowed, willing the fist around his heart to unclench. After that, he managed a piece of toast and two biscuits before he gave up and went back to his chair, opening his laptop to try to find something useful to do. For a while, he simply stared at the screen without seeing it, lost in his own thoughts. Suddenly, he blinked and sat more upright, clicking and typing and clicking again. After only a few moments, a new post appeared on The Personal Blog of Dr. John H. Watson. It read simply:
As the night wore on, the bottle of whiskey seemed to be emptying itself as Sherlock and John giggled and poked fun at one another and were altogether foolish. They ended up on the sofa with Sherlock lying prone across the length of the couch, his feet resting against John’s leg. John was clearly half asleep, a crocheted blanket draped haphazardly in his lap. The fire in the fireplace had died down to almost nothing and neither man would or could get up to stoke it back to life.
“’m here, John. S’okay,” Sherlock slurred, clearly mostly asleep, but still somehow intuiting John’s embrace.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked, his tone suggesting the sharpness of his mind still working underneath the whiskey.
John’s mouth worked against itself as he decided against a dozen different responses to that particular question. Eventually, he determined that the best course was simply walking away, which he did. Finding Lestrade just outside the church door, John pressed him for details of the discovery of the body, any persons of interest, and any theories that Lestrade might have. Unsurprisingly, Lestrade was extremely thorough in his list of all the things he and his team didn’t know. How long the body had been there. Who put him there. The exact cause of death. The time of death. The identity of the victim. The identity of the perpetrator, or perpetrators. The reason the dead man looked so much like Sherlock.
your emotions would affect your work. That’s the bloody human condition.” John approached Sherlock and tried to make him see reason. “But the Work bit is just an excuse. The real reason you don’t want to get caught up in emotions is because you’d have to truly deal with relationships and the messy world of socialising, and you’d be utterly out of your depth.” Now facing Sherlock, John stabbed a single finger into the detective’s chest. “When it comes to relationships, Sherlock Holmes, you haven’t a single clue.”
John knew he should be thinking about what was happening, maybe trying to slow things down or talk to Sherlock about what this meant, but trying to string two coherent thoughts together felt like walking through waist-deep mud. After a while, he gave it up as a bad job, too overwhelmed by the reality that he was literally inside his best friend. He heard a rustling of fabric and felt Sherlock’s rhythm stutter. When John looked down, he saw the single sexiest thing he had ever witnessed in his life: Sherlock was eagerly jerking himself off whilst sucking John’s cock. “Fuck—Sherlock—“ John gasped, completely overwhelmed. The sight on its own was more than he could take, but the knowledge that Sherlock was just as turned on as John was…well, it wasn’t going to take much to finish John off.
Following his shift, he arrived home to find Sherlock deeply engrossed in something in his microscope, too involved even to return John’s greeting. A lopsided smile appeared on John’s face, his
John’s heart broke for the man. How could he believe that? John steeled himself for what he knew he needed to say, finally.
to touch, John found himself unable to stop. His hands touched everywhere he could, practically ripping Sherlock’s stupid sexy coat off of him so he could have better access. Between kisses, John tried desperately to catch his breath. “Sherlock—“
Sherlock blinked and looked up at John, and just like that the two men dissolved into giggles. After a moment, Sherlock’s face twisted in pain and John got down on his knee to look him over. Sherlock looked away from John and forced coolness back into his voice. “I’m fine, John.”
John couldn’t remember making his way back to Baker Street, but he somehow found himself standing in the kitchen staring at the live feed of Sherlock on his phone. He forced himself to drink a full glass of water and eat a reasonable amount of food from the small haul he brought back from the shops on Monday. Yesterday? Was it truly only yesterday? It felt like years.
John spent three hours in his bed pretending that he might go to sleep before he dressed himself again and went back to the sitting room. His mobile and laptop were now fully charged and he went back to the blog, refreshing it for the hundredth time since his useless post some hours before.
“Oh come now John, I thought we were past this. I’m not going to put on airs at a crime scene just to preserve others’ delicate sensibilities.”
“Anything?” John asked him, agitated that Mycroft was being so reticent, but also knowing that Mycroft would tell him if something truly urgent or important were discovered.
question apparently answered. Remembering the leftover curry in the fridge, John fixed himself a plate and went about the rest of his evening as usual. And so it went for the next several days, all business as usual, no drunken revelations or hangovers needing tending.
“Back in twenty,” he offered as he slid his coat back on. He knew better than to await a response, and was slipping out the front door as he heard Sherlock begin to play. He was loathe to go when Sherlock was playing one of the more lovely pieces John had heard, but the pull of curry was too strong.
John tried not to feel overwhelmed as he was permitted to see and touch every part of Sherlock. He ran his hands from Sherlock’s calves up to his thighs, John’s thumbs caressing Sherlock’s inguinal creases and making the detective shudder. Sherlock’s hands fisted in the bedsheets. John continued his journey, tracing Sherlock’s sides and dancing the pads of his thumbs across Sherlock’s nipples. A sharp intake of breath told John he would be revisiting there soon enough. As he leaned forward over Sherlock, their cocks aligned and pressed together, pulling a groan from both men. Reaching for the lube and uncapping it, he hazarded a glance at Sherlock.
When Sherlock regained consciousness the first time, the only thing he could sense was total disorientation. He didn’t know where he was, or even where his body was in space. He couldn’t be sure if he were still moving or not. His brain was malfunctioning somehow, the furious cascade of information suddenly turned to treacle. He hardly had enough time to panic about this realisation before he slipped into darkness again.
[23:00 and messaging me out of the blue about a man we’ve had no news of for weeks? It seems congratulations are in order. -MH]
“Even if your tone weren’t obvious – and it is – your offer to play Cluedo with me gives away your question as wholly facetious.”
“It’s a stress position,” John explained. “It’s meant to cause discomfort that gets worse over the time. The longer he’s in the position, the more it will hurt. Some stress positions can even be fatal. This is what the Americans call ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’.”
John shook his head. “That’s not what I mean, Sherlock. We spend a lot of time together, but it’s not…it’s not enough. I want to share every single part of my life with someone. I want to be head over heels. I want to take care of her while she takes care of me right back. I don’t just want to go on a string of dates until I’ve struck every woman in London off the list.” John heaved another heavy sigh and brought his hands up to his face, rubbing his palms roughly into his still-closed eyes.
John’s eyes burned and he cleared his throat vigorously. “I, um—“ He paused, cleared his throat again. “Thank you, Sherlock.” He leaned over for a quick peck, but before long his hands were in Sherlock’s hair and his horrid jumper was far too warm. Sherlock gently disengaged.
“Shut up, John,” Sherlock replied, diving in for an even deeper kiss. Pressing his body fully against John’s, it became evident that both men were intensely aroused. John groaned, and Sherlock dropped to his knees like a puppet with his strings cut. With trembling fingers, he got John’s trousers open and pulled out John’s cock. Ignoring John’s strangled cry, Sherlock dove in and swallowed as much of John’s length as he could, nearly gagging from the overzealous effort.
The last items Ex-Military pulled out of the duffel bag were a protein bar and a bottle of water. He opened the water bottle and held it over Sherlock’s face. “Open,” he commanded, his voice brooking no response other than compliance. For a short moment, Sherlock debated refusing, trying to demonstrate his strength and control even in this circumstance, but he also knew that his mental prowess would not be at its peak if he were severely dehydrated. Food he could do without, and he often avoided it in order to focus on a particularly difficult problem. Water, however, was far more necessary. He made eye contact with Moriarty, then raised his head and opened his mouth. Ex-Military poured sips of water into Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock gulped it down, taking as much as he was given. Sherlock knew he would have to evacuate his bladder soon. With half the bottle now consumed, Ex-Military placed it back near the bag and turned back to Sherlock.
Blinking rapidly and looking at where John’s hand rested lightly on his, Sherlock swallowed and tried to put words together in his brain. “That would—I’m—if you—“ He closed his eyes and shook his head, his brow furrowing in frustration and concentration.
“Sometimes you have to accept that God knows best. That you don’t always get what you want, just because you ask.”
She invited herself to tea a week after he moved in. He picked up curry from the Ajit Palace on the way home and she brought two bottles of a middling Chardonnay. She walked through the sterile rooms, her heels echoing loudly on the bare wood floors, and told him, straight-faced, that it reminded her of a safe house. “This is so unlike you – it’s as if you’re in witness protection. No one would think of looking for you here.”
“He could have set it up to be sent later. Although he denied knowing about the nursery rhymes. Why would he lie about that and admit everything else?”
The cathedral in Varna is empty. You choose it because you need a quiet place to silence the screaming that fills your head. You’ve made a total cock-up of what was meant to be easy.
Kate shrugged and Sherlock opened his mouth, but John held up his hand. “Well, we did plan to come to Canada with the news about Sarah. But then we heard from Mary and since she was our best link to Moriarty . . .”
“Well you figured wrong. Not interested.” Sherlock clicked off the phone and turned to see John staring at him.
He says it’s too late for breakfast when we finally make it back to the kitchen. He’s always looking for excuses not to eat. The doctors say his stomach may never forgive him for getting shot. So I’m creative, sprinkling protein powder in his soup, hiding tofu in the lasagna, mixing wheat germ in the muffins. I suspect he knows, but he doesn’t protest. He plays along and I try not to hover or remind him of the world’s starving children as he pushes his food around his plate like a finicky child.
As the bus turned onto King Edward Street, a man hurried out the door of Barts and sprinted to the bus stop. Molly smiled and smoothed her hair as she watched him approach. He had time for a quick kiss before they boarded the bus together.
while waiting for a cab, shivering as the rain soaked through his anorak and yes, his stomach had started to ache half an hour later. It was almost as bad as the summer he was twelve and ate a dozen dodgy sausage rolls nicked from the shop on High Street. But it was a giant leap from a sore belly to actually dying. No matter what the tests concluded. No matter how concerned Lestrade and Molly looked or how puzzled the expression on Mycroft’s face. (Sherlock had remained uncharacteristically silent, slouched against the treatment room’s only window, staring at his phone). Things like being shot with poison-filled darts in the middle of London just didn’t happen. Especially not to him.
She shook her head. “Inmates talk. Maybe he heard about it from someone else. It was all over the news.”
Mycroft didn’t answer, took a long look at John’s face, and tapped on the window. The car pulled away from the kerb.
“Completely normal, as far as I can tell.” He smiled when he saw the expression on her face. “That was my reaction too.” He cleared his throat. “They moved him upstairs to ICU. I’ll take you to him. The lift is at the end of the corridor.”
Sherlock smiled. John recognised that smile. It was the one Sherlock used to nick the last piece of toast, the one that let John forgive him a hundred trespasses, the one that sooner or later would get John into his bed.
I dream about my father. We walk together again in the woods, his breath a frozen cloud against the endless blue.
Sherlock leaned back as if John had hit him. “I am well aware of my actions and their tragic consequences. Tragic because the result was . . . is a motherless child and . . .” Sherlock hesitated and swallowed.
And in the middle of it all, she felt relief. There were no more questions. The answers were far from the ones she wanted. But they were answers. Definitive. Solid. Final.  And so fucking sad.
She took out her iPad, logged onto the hospital’s free Wi-Fi and did a Google search for Charles Magnussen. A long Wikipedia entry – no doubt written by his own PR people, was the first of over a million hits. She started there.
Molly had recently tried to convince John of the healing powers of yoga. He’d gone once, if only to make her stop looking at him as if he were about to take a header off the nearest ledge. She always looked so guilty, as if she’d pushed Sherlock herself.
John sighed. He knew this part by heart now. “It was raining hard. The street was crowded. I felt a prick – like a bee sting – in my calf. I bent down to look and pulled a small dart from my trousers. I got into the cab and went back to Baker Street. And now you have all concluded that I have been fatally poisoned. You do know how mad that sounds?”
Fifteen minutes later, he’d received one shot for the pain and another for the nausea and provided Dr. Franklin with more blood samples. The diagnosis? Still dying.
“Just a bit of hoovering, dear. I didn’t think you’d mind.” She patted Sherlock on the chest. “Some things need to be gone over again you know.” She winked at Sherlock and leaned down to pick up teacups from the bedside table. “We don’t quite get them right the first time.” She handed John the vacuum and turned towards the door.
“And say what? We have no evidence linking Moriarty to anything. All we have is a name. If it really is his name.”
That enticing thing turned up after another few brutal days. Sherlock’s phone beeped, and as soon as his eyes fell on it, he leapt to his feet with sheer delight on his face. John looked up from his laptop and knew at once that Sherlock would be heading out the door in about ten seconds – with or without him. John slipped into his shoes and jacket, a mixture of relief, dread, and pure adrenaline awakening all his senses. In the cab on the way to the crime scene, Sherlock was unusually tight-lipped about the nature of the call.
When he was sure that Sherlock was well and truly out, John delicately extricated himself and popped off to the loo. He wiped himself off with a warm, wet flannel, then returned to clean at least the bulk of the mess from Sherlock while he slumbered. Grabbing a blanket from the closet, he tucked Sherlock in and turned out the light, then laid down himself. He intended to sleep, but couldn’t stop staring at his flatmate. Best friend. Partner. Boyfriend. All that time spent dancing around each other and here they were, finally. He tried not to think of Sherlock’s abduction and the events that finally pushed them together, but he knew it would be ages before he could get the images of Sherlock from the live feed out of his mind—if ever. Sherlock’s screams of agony would likely haunt him until his dying day, even if he spent the rest of his life coming home to this absolutely mad, brilliant, infuriating man. An intense protective rage flared in John’s chest for a moment and he took Sherlock into his arms once again, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck.
For a while, the only sound in the flat was the crackling of the rejuvenated fire. John stared into the flames for a long while, his mind harkening back to their earlier conversation about John’s love life. He hadn’t allowed himself to think about it in broad strokes because it was, frankly, too disheartening. The reality was that he simply floated from relationship to relationship, hoping each time that this girl would be The One, yet quickly finding that she was just someone who could stave off the loneliness for a while. He wasn’t as young as he used to be, and while he enjoyed his blogging and crime-fighting(ish) and flat-sharing, he knew that he was supposed to be settling down. Wife, kids, suburbs, all that. Some part of him yearned for the simplicity and normalcy of that life. At this rate, though, his “simple life” would be in a care home where the staff changed his nappies.
Mycroft hung up without another word and John immediately called Lestrade to update him, then loaded the video on his mobile and raced downstairs to get a cab.
John realised that Sherlock was leaving him standing in the street by himself and he caught the sight of a long coat swirling as Sherlock ducked under the tape and entered the house. He rolled his eyes, the smile never leaving his face, and followed behind.
Minutes later, Lestrade came over to check on John. When John shrugged off his inquiries, he changed tack. “What’s with this position they’ve got him in? Surely there are easier ways to tie a bloke to a chair.”
“Your assumption that my strategy would result in my death isn’t exactly a vote of confidence, John. You know I can solve this case more quickly by accepting a modicum of risk. Considering my track record of not yet having died, I think the odds are looking fairly good for me, are they not?
John forgot how to breathe after hearing Sherlock’s words. It felt as though his heart were breaking all over again. The desperation he felt to find Sherlock somehow intensified. John continued watching Sherlock, his eyes burning with unshed tears. When he saw Sherlock’s legs give out and heard the cry that tore from his friend’s throat, John’s grief instantly solidified to a white-hot rage. He grabbed a paperweight from Lestrade’s desk and threw it as hard as he could. The glass between the office and the bullpen shattered and the officers nearby all stopped in their tracks to look at John.
“Then why do I have the feeling there’s something else going on – something personal between you and Magnussen.”
He lay on the sofa and bit into one of the crackers. He choked and spat out the crumbs onto the floor.
John bowed his head. Closed his eyes. Sighed. He didn’t want to play this game. The events of the past few days – months – had crushed him. Again and again. He didn’t think he had the strength. “Please, don’t,” he whispered.
“Bugger off.” He turned and walked down the block toward the house. His mistake was looking back. Mycroft stood, umbrella hooked on his arm, staring at him, infuriating smile still plastered on his face. Mycroft shrugged and turned and walked back toward the car and John wanted to laugh because it felt so good to finally –
. He pictured Sherlock reading to his daughter, all the books he’d been too serious to read as a child. It was stupid and sentimental and it broke his heart every time.
I retrieve the half-empty bottle of Jameson from the kitchen, rinse two glasses and set them on the table beside Sherlock’s chair.  I fill my glass, sink into my chair and wait for Sherlock.
She stood and pulled the scarf tight around her neck. Sherlock was not getting it back. She would consider it a wedding gift. She wondered if she should invite him over to the house or maybe they should all meet in a neutral location – like a Starbucks.
He's finally forgiven me, I think. For leaving him when I said I never would. It’s a thirty-year old promise, I remind him.
He opened the door and leaned against it, gathering his courage, preparing what he was going to say. “Sherlock?”
No one wanted Bellamy to be the one who poisoned John—if he was, any chance of finding out what John had been injected with likely died with him. A search of the hotel room had turned up nothing useful. No mobile, no laptop, no items helpfully labeled “CLUE.”
John watched them, wondering again about Sherlock’s connection to Peter Lockwood. He didn’t imagine Sherlock was given to random displays of sentimentality.  He stood and reached for his coat, folded on the seat beside him. When he turned back, the blond man (he of the £1000 suit) stopped at their pew and was looking at Sherlock like he’d seen a ghost. No, not a ghost. More like a man who’s just seen a large fish walking down Kensington Street, peering into shop windows. Impossible, but happening nonetheless.
When it was over, the family wiped their tears and exchanged hugs. All except one, a tall blond man, mid-thirties, dressed in a suit even more bespoke than Sherlock’s. He stood back from the rest, hands in his pockets.
“She was smuggling stolen art across the US-Canada border. Her contact would pass a canvas to her in New York and she would simply carry it across the border mixed in with her own work. She was young and attractive and no one paid attention.  She was paid $5,000 for each delivery – a pittance compared to how much the paintings later sold for. Someone else would pick them up from her in Ottawa. She died before she was able to drop off the last one.”
Kate nodded and stepped back. “Yeah, it sucks.” She watched as Sherlock walked over to stand beside John. “You two seem good, though.”
“Sherlock, you stupid, selfish bastard, look what you’ve done to me,” John whispered as he drifted off.
“No, I don’t mind.” Kate warmed her hands around the pot. The waitress was right, it was too soon to be dining
“Why are you still talking?” John’s back was tight, his shoulders high. “This has nothing to do with you.”
He lifted the suitcase into the trunk and laid it on top of a child’s bike. He saw her watching – “Flat tire. Keep promising her I'll get it fixed.”
“I am thinking. For God’s sake, how I am supposed to keep track of everything. I’m dealing with a bacterial anomaly here.”
John stayed against Sherlock’s chest for a moment, letting his heart slow down a bit. It was just too much. He pulled his head away and looked at Sherlock. “Promise me something.”
Sherlock had miscalculated. He knew that now. He’d factored every variable into the equation – Moriarty’s threats, his criminal network (known and unknown), his own genius and ruined reputation, the safety of John, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, Mycroft’s access to information – and always came up with the same conclusion. Being dead was the only way out. It was also the only way in. It served everyone’s purposes.
“You’re staying?” John asked. “Tonight, I mean?” Sherlock had confessed that this reunion was more furlough than homecoming.
It was almost midnight when they finished eating. Steak, roasted potatoes, asparagus, apple crumble to finish. A bottle of Bordeaux – 2008 Château Lusseau. The meal cost almost an entire week’s pay.
“Okay. I’ll talk to him.”  He wasn’t convinced, but Sherlock loved an anomaly. “What about that professor of yours? Did he get back to you?”
“Or funerals, as I recall.” Simon said. “Yet here you are.” He laid a hand against Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock stiffened but didn’t pull away.
“Did I fucking say you could sit?” John said and Sherlock straightened. His voice was quiet now, cold. “Why are you here? Why now?”
John’s phone vibrated and he tugged it awkwardly out of his left pocket with his right hand. He’d been keeping his left hand tucked under his leg. Sherlock raised an eyebrow but said nothing. John slid the phone open, read the text and handed it to Sherlock. “Another one.”
At least the food was good. Tikka masala from Taj Mahal. It had taken Kate all of five minutes to realize she could cook three things and two of them started with the word Kraft. If the line outside the Taj Mahal was any indication, she wouldn’t poison Sherlock on his first night home, so take-out it was.
Mycroft never said if there was a funeral for you. You watched John at your grave, equal parts relieved and disappointed he hadn’t worked it out. Playing dead was the only way out. And the only way in. But you miscalculated. Never expected Moriarty to be a knot even you can’t untie. Never guessed that leaving would be so hard. Because you’re a bloody machine, isn’t that what John said?
Lestrade recited and Sherlock listened. The more he listened, the more confused he became. Not because the murder was so complicated, but because he didn’t recognise any of it. Until now, everything was exactly as he remembered it. Mrs. Hudson, the flat, John, even the pork dumplings at Wing Fa. If Lestrade hadn’t solved the murder so quickly that afternoon, he wouldn’t have been available for this new case. It seemed to Sherlock that he was changing his past – his memories – by living them again. Not only with John . . .
John didn’t know what to answer first. He pulled himself up on his elbows and started to speak, but Sherlock had already crossed the room and was leaning down toward him, eyebrow raised. He reached up and pulled Sherlock close. Their mouths met, tentative at first, but then John tasted salt and coffee and he felt Sherlock press against him and he kissed him hard and long and John fell back against the mattress and Sherlock’s hands were everywhere. For a brief moment, John wondered what happened to the juice that might not be juice, but then Sherlock’s fingers slid down toward his cock, and he forget everything else that was in his head.
It was more than all right. For as long as it lasted, it was the most glorious game John had ever played.
Sherlock swallowed hard and tried to say something. This could not be a stroke. He could actually smell the tea. Earl Grey.
His phone vibrated in his pocket and he pulled it out – Molly’s number. Probably trying to find Sherlock.
“I’m glad you’re here, John,” she told him at the door. If she noticed the limp, she didn’t mention it. “Sit down and we’ll get started.”
“Sorry. He’s not used to feeling helpless,” John said. He stood unsteadily. “Dr. Franklin’s waiting for me. If Sherlock decides to make an appearance, can you tell him where I am?”
John stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder. “You okay?” He reached by the bed and handed Sherlock his cane. “Pride goeth before a fall. Literally.”
He found the vicar on the church’s website and emailed him. He thanked him for the funeral and the coffee and his concern. Once he started typing, he couldn’t stop until he’d told him all of it.  After that, they met for a meal each time David was in town, and later for drinks in John’s flat.
She stood and grabbed her coat. “Any requests? Don’t suppose you have Kraft Dinner over here? We can fancy it up – add some hot dogs or tuna.”
Your grandmother was sicker than he was. Besides, some people are just too mean to die.” He lowered his voice. “Don’t tell your mum I said that.”
“For £360 a night, it bloody well better be,” he muttered under his breath. “Can you send a bucket of ice to the room, please?” He had a large bottle of Jameson’s in his bag, wrapped in one of Sherlock’s old scarves.
“So now you’ve got some strange halo vision?” In the first months after it happened, we both harboured some small hope that his sight would improve. But it never did.
Sherlock hated how Mycroft’s questions always sounded as if he already knew the answers. It had taken him a good part of his life to understand that Mycroft was often as clueless as he was. He just managed to hide it better.
Sherlock spun around and faced Sutton. “It’s so obvious. How did I not see it? Tell me, did you shoot him yourself?”
John wanted to know all these stories. How Sherlock got hurt, got better and got hurt again, long before he came around.
Sherlock was back in his chair when she got home. She set the bags on the kitchen table and grabbed a Diet Pepsi from the fridge. She heard the shower through the closed door of the bathroom and sat down in John’s chair.
“It’s the answer.” Or it’s the end, he thought as he jumped into a cab. “The Huxley Gallery in Whitechapel. Hurry.”
– Gordon Washburn, Senior Vice-President, Shipton Building Society, is fifty going on retirement. I recognise the type, there were plenty like him in the army, doing the job just enough to get by. Always looking for a shortcut.
Chapter makes reference (however obliquely) to missing hospital scene between Sherlock and Magnussen.
“Enough!” John shouted. “Both of you. Not another word.” He pointed to the chair by the window. “Sherlock, sit down.” He turned to Kate and pointed to the couch. “You, sit over there.”
“Oh, no dear, that won’t be necessary. Really. It’s all fine. You can just close up that file on Anna. She’s fine and we’re fine and it’s been nice to talk to you but I have to go. Goodbye.”
Sherlock is antsy. He doesn’t say much, but I can tell something is bothering him from the way he keeps rubbing his hands against his thighs.
one. You’d think if he went to all this trouble to set it up, he’d want you to know why – especially since we’ve got what?”  He looked at the phone. “Seventeen hours. Seventeen hours until it won’t matter why.” John rubbed his thigh, which was starting to cramp.
He closed his eyes and concentrated. March 28, 2010. They’d just finished the case John called The Blind Banker. Something tweaked at his memory . . .
Her phone rang. For a moment she thought it might be Chloe, saying she wasn’t coming after all, and Kate didn’t know whether she’d be disappointed or relieved. Probably both. But it was Greg calling from the bar in the lobby.
Thanks, as always, to peg22 for handholding, cheerleading and for pushing me in the right direction..
Sherlock claimed it was the tea, not the morphine that revived him. He wanted to stay up, so John made him comfortable on the couch and promised him the laptop in exchange for eating more than biscuits. They compromised on toast (2 pieces with butter and currant jelly), which he ate very slowly. He reminded John of a stubborn child being forced to finish his mushy peas.
Sherlock shook his head and stood by the bookshelf on the opposite side of the room.  Was he grasping at straws here?  “I have a  . . . colleague  . . . who has been poisoned. A synthetic form of aflatoxin, most likely. Your area more than mine.” He paused and looked at the bookshelf, mostly chemistry textbooks and travel guides and a row of family photos in silver frames meticulously arranged on the second shelf. He peered at a particular picture and the pieces fell into place like tumblers in a lock.
“What do you say? The universe is rarely so lazy?” Sherlock shoved the paper under his arm and turned back to Mycroft. “Tell John . . .”
Greg scrubbed his eyebrows. This was ridiculous. “Molly, can you give me something I can actually work with?”
She tried not to let her surprise show. She took another drink, then leaned forward across the table, “Seriously? Mycroft Holmes?”
“Do you ever get to the point? You and Sherlock think that if I tell Mary I know that she was working for Moriarty and killed that MP in Canada, it’ll get me a bullet to the head –“
John moved down the bed and moved Sherlock’s hand off his cock and fingered his balls. Sherlock reached out and threaded his fingers through John’s hair, pulling him down onto his cock. John took it in, sucking and licking and raking his teeth up his shaft. Sherlock thrusted upward with the same rhythm that John was sucking him. Sherlock’s moans became more frantic and he arched his back, coming in waves in John’s mouth.
He bit back a smile. “My wife – I call her Mary, but only because I don’t know her actual name – is an assassin. Of course, I didn’t know that when I married her. I only found out after she shot Sherlock in the chest and he almost died. I moved back to Baker Street to sort things out and take care of Sherlock. When the woman you think you love shoots the man you actually love, what choice do you have really? A week ago, Sherlock and I . . . well, we finally got things out in the open for the first time . . . well, it was really for the second time, but I don’t remember the first time because I was drugged afterwards. He hasn’t said yet that he loves me, but that’s only because he’s a tight-arsed prat.” He stopped and took a breath.
He turned and sat in his chair, aware that Sherlock was watching from over the top of the computer. He tried to remember what a nonchalant posture looked like. He crossed his legs, felt a twinge in his chest, and sat up straighter – rubbing his palms on the sides of the chair.
Kate shifted uncomfortably in the chair. “Magnussen can’t be the only one who knows about Mary. Do you plan to do battle with them all?”
Sherlock felt his heart shred. He wanted to take John to bed and show him a thousand ways why he would never leave him. “I know,” he said.
John cleared his throat. “No disrespect, but it’s not you I want to talk to. It’s Sherlock. There are things I want to tell him, things I need to ask –” He looked down and rubbed at a rust-coloured spot on his trousers.
It took Greg twenty minutes and three phone calls to confirm Mycroft’s suspicion that Bellamy was Tommy Pearce’s dealer. Another ten to learn that Siobhan Pearce had to be persuaded to claim her ex-husband’s body.  According to the investigating officer’s report, “When informed of her ex-husband’s death, Mrs. Pearce appeared more relieved than upset.”
It started slow.  Sherlock pressed his lips against John. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him closer. Sherlock rested a hand on John’s hip. John forced Sherlock’s mouth open and deepened the kiss and Sherlock sighed against John’s lips.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and the kiss deepened. He let himself be carried away, to the place where this was real and nothing mattered but John.
They’d shared a flat, a bathroom, even the same plate of pasta on occasion. John had put him to bed, rousted him from bed, Christ, he’d even made his bed a few times, but until tonight, they had never
Sherlock let him go, headed towards the bed, and trailed his open hand behind him. Sherlock lay down, one knee bent, hands laced behind his head, his skin flushed pink with arousal. John lay down bed beside him and Sherlock kissed him again and there was only bare skin against skin, the sound of rough legs sliding against each other. John loved that sound, the strength in Sherlock’s grip, the hot press of his cock against his stomach.
using the antidote may leave you open to censure in the event that you did not do everything possible to achieve a positive outcome . . .”
“Surely.” I set the plates behind me and wonder if I can shag him silent before the tikka masala arrives. I lean against the table and cross my arms. Ready for battle.
“Christ,” Sherlock panted, hot and damp, against John’s cheek. “I – God – ”  He rocked his hips forward again and again.  John couldn’t stop looking at the beat of his pulse at the base of his neck and further down, the bruise on his jaw.
Sherlock’s fingers flew over the keys. He nodded toward the table and John set the teacup to the side and peered over Sherlock’s shoulder. He recognized the names of the files – cases he had written up for his blog. Some published, some waiting to be, some never to be.
“Wish my grandmother could have been so open-minded.” Kate sighed, glancing at her watch, at the door. She could hear muffled voices and heavy footsteps coming from upstairs.
She resisted to the urge to feel his forehead for a fever. What was it about Sherlock that alternately made her want to hug him and smack him? “Can we keep going or do you need a break?”
She stood and took a look around the flat. A sagging couch, God-awful wallpaper, she stepped closer – were those bullet holes? She counted at least three, no four. A yellow happy face. A kitchen table that looked like a makeshift lab bench. The place was a total mess, books and newspapers spread out everywhere, but she had a feeling that was exactly how Sherlock liked it.
As she read, the picture she had of Mary Morstan, international assassin, began to change. This was a woman who was alone, scared, and having a baby on her own . . . or was she? The most interesting text had been sent to Mary yesterday morning. From the same number she’d seen over and over.
Sherlock smiled. “Biscuits, John. I’ll do anything for free biscuits. Including wearing this ridiculous disguise.” He lifted a baseball cap from his overnight bag and pulled it down over his forehead. “Voilà. The world’s biggest Yankees fan,” he said in his best/worst American accent.
“Fiona Miller was right to be worried. Someone at Shipton found out what she was doing, followed her home and killed her. On the bed from the looks of it. The pattern of the blood would support stabbing, most likely while she was lying down. The murderer wrapped her in the rug and carried out the body.”
Now he was certain this was a dream. John had never wanted him. Not like that. John wanted many things from Sherlock over the years. He’d wanted him to be more polite. He’d wanted him to eat regularly. He’d wanted him not to be dead . . . but he’d never wanted . . . him. Preposterous. Sherlock would have known. John would have said. He wouldn’t have married Mary. Who marries someone despite . . . in spite . . . who could keep a secret like that?
John walked into the kitchen, washed his hands. Reached under the sink and pulled out a bottle. Splashed some quickly into two glasses, walked over and sat opposite her in his chair.
Sherlock took the paper, read it. Greg watched his face drain of colour. He stepped forward and took him by the arm. “We found it in Bellamy’s pocket.”
Sherlock starts humming and I throw him a dirty look. He ignores me and continues to hum. I think it’s
After his third beer, John finally asked. He wasn’t planning to, only he’d been thinking it since he watched Simon lay his hand on Sherlock’s arm and he felt a twinge of something that might have been jealousy, but really couldn’t have been, because that would be stupid and adolescent and John was a grown man. “Did you fuck Simon Lockwood?”
“Deliberate.” He shifted in his chair and winced and held his arm against his chest. John made a move to get up, but Sherlock shook his head and John sat back down.
“Do I need to make a fucking list? You solved two cases in one day. One without even looking at the file. No one’s that brilliant. You paid for dim sum. You tidied up in here. And now you’re offering to get takeaway.”
Back in Sherlock’s room, she pulled the case off one of the pillows and gathered up everything she could find – t-shirt, sweater, socks and slippers and stuffed them into the pillow case. When she picked up his sweat pants, a tiny piece of paper floated out of the pocket and onto the floor. She picked it up, carefully unfolded it and read the words –
– when a silver BMW pulled up beside her. The driver lowered the window and leaned across the empty passenger seat. “Inspector Bryant?”
John took her arm and steered her towards the door. “Good night, Mrs. Hudson. I’ll keep an eye on him. No worries.” He closed the door behind her and leaned back against it.
“More explanation than apology. I forced his hand at Gidleigh Park. I clearly underestimated how much losing you again would affect him.”
“Bloody hell,” John panted in Sherlock’s ear and ground against him again. “Wait.” John reached down between them and unzipped his jeans and lowered them past his hips. Sherlock pushed himself up on one arm and did the same. They fell back against each other, moving together, hands tangled, finding that rhythm where it all fell away and it was just the two of them. Sherlock hissed John’s name as he came and John clung to his shoulders, thrusting against him, burying his head in Sherlock’s shoulder as the wave threatened to toss him to the floor. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled his hips tight, sliding his hand down John’s cock, sending him over the edge. He came with a shout and dug his fingers hard into Sherlock’s back.
“John never did have any stamina. He always insisted we stop and eat at the most inopportune times.”
. Tell me how he liked his tea, or what shows he watched on telly. Anything.” She stood and dropped the notebook on the table. She walked to the window and stared outside, her arms folded in front of her.
“I passed it around upstairs, and it generated some interest. The feeling is that even if it’s a bit of a fishing expedition, it’s worth looking into. No statute of limitations on these sorts of things.”
Thanks to peg22 for all her help with this chapter. I have a habit of writing myself into corners and she always helps me find the way out.
She sat on the bottom step and retrieved her phone from her pocket. She typed quickly and pressed send before she could change her mind.
The rest. Loaded sentence in this town. “So, Sherlock got shot at CAM – I recognize that name.” She sifted through a maze of vague memories until she found the right one. “I saw a story about the CEO on CBC last year. How he was giving Rupert Murdoch a run for his money. Michealson?”
