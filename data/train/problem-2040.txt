“Oh! You made a bet out of this! Can I bet against you?”
“I came up with the idea. My companion fleshed out the details. We fell at the same time but.” I looked down and grew silent.
“My point being, what if we could fall too?”
Opening the door I caught eyes with my flatmate and nodded, wondering if he’d noticed yet. I hung my coat on the hook and made my way to the electric kettle. I eyed the water level and decided to add more water before flicking the switch and preparing two mugs. I temporarily allowed my mind to wander over to the thought of the parallel weak American tea and weak British coffee. Well then I noticed the blue light flick off in my peripheral vision, and I hurried to pick up the kettle before the water cooled.
I scoffed. ‘Did you not just observe my vow of silence’ tried to pull itself from my lips, but I held my tongue. I shook my head and began to read it to myself, although not missing his slight pout.
“You’re one to talk!”
Alone. Am I crazy?
I relaxed on my back and glanced over at him.
While thoroughly immersed into the story of the great American frontier, I hadn’t noticed Holmes get up. I hadn’t noticed him push his chair close to mine. I hadn’t noticed how close we were until I adjusted my reading position and realised my book was resting on his lap instead of mine.
“By the way, since you are good enough to chronicle a few of my ‘adventures’, you may be interested in this,” He threw a newspaper into my lap which was open to the advice column. “Read it aloud.”
You’re so far and
We were talking one day, and I wish I could say chatting but we were not allowed to be as frivolous as that. We decided that love must not be an emotion, for we cannot feel emotions, and yet I know I knew love.
He started pulling at my jumper, and I was quite excited for that. I pulled the jumper over my head and started unfastening any button I could find on his person. Abruptly, He stood up.
Homesick
“I took a vow of silence once, too.”
He shuffled papers on his clipboard.
Floating
And nothing seems real
I decided to put my frogs in the napkin drawer, because it seemed obvious at the time. Apparently it wasn’t, because when my mother had guests, she wasn’t too happy. She opened the bottom drawer of the dining room bureau to be met with 30 frogs flying in all matter of directions.
“I don't have friends”, he protested.
William sits down on the bench beside me. If it was an effort to get him to start talking when he came to my bed, it's even harder now. He's on edge, constantly sweeping his eyes across the room. His shoulders are a stiff, self-conscious line.
Watson's grip has subconsciously tightened around Sherlock, moving faster. He swipes his thumb across the head of Sherlock's cock, smearing a fresh bead of pre-ejaculate over him. Sherlock's eyes slam shut and his mouth drops open. “

John    14:02
It's always unexpectedly hard not to kiss him hello when we meet in the dance barn. But I can see in his eyes that he's thinking the same thing, and that will just have to do; both of us imagining a kiss at the same time. I sit down next to him and all that we allow ourselves is pressing our knees together. Sometimes even that small contact is overwhelming.
But then I come back, and we work, and we work well. That amazes me over and over.
. His thigh comes to rest above Sherlock's crotch, and Sherlock's hips twitch upwards helplessly, a tiny sound in the back of his throat.
, I say, adding an eye-roll to make him feel at home.
One year ago, on the morning of the first rehearsal at the Moulin Rouge, I didn't have time to sleep. As now, I had stayed up all night writing, and when dawn crept up on me, I left my flat to visit Stamford upstairs.
And the smell. He keeps it inside the bedside table drawer; Earl Grey and outside air and tanned skin. He pushes his nose into it, into the patch of skin just to the right of John's nose.
“What-” I started, but couldn't bring myself to voice a question. “When-”

Even when John doesn't miss the way Sherlock now sleeps every night, slotting his bedtime routine into John's.
Sherlock    23:05
I opened my eyes to force the moment away. Even now, I'm still afraid to close them. He's so near, sometimes, just barely out of reach, his lips quivering, waiting for my kiss. It kills me not to give it to him.
Sherlock    15:05
John moves to the edge of his bed, leaving room for Sherlock on the pale pink sheets. Sherlock lies down and is immediately aware of a tension that was not there yesterday. Lying in a bed together is no longer uncomplicated.
It's the shortest night of the year, and I sleep poorly.
“If he tears the Moulin Rouge down, do you realise what will happen? To
“There was no need”, Sherlock says softly, eyeing him curiously.
He read her name on my face somehow. “You should go home”, he murmured.
“Best appreciated with a champagne flute in hand, I'm sure.”
His hand strangely warm despite the cold of the night. Sitting side by side on a picnic blanket, trembling and holding on.

“John…” he murmured. “Please trust me.” I screwed my eyes shut. “Trust me”, he repeated.
“Don't know if Moriarty's going to get his money's worth tonight”, she said.
John puts his hands behind his neck and looks thoughtfully out the window. The sky is overcast, giving the summer day a bright grey shade.
My hands wandered over him, couldn't decide where to touch him. Everything I could touch is so unbearably sweet, and it's all
“Sherlock Holmes. Consulting Detective.”
“Hold me closer”, he kept saying in his intoxicating French. His nails dug into my shoulder blades and I shifted my pelvis, making our naked cocks touch. I groaned with a combination of relief and agony at the pleasure. “Closer”, he gasped.
“Perhaps this
Sherlock grunts.
By the end of the chorus, I heard the click of a safety behind me. But before I could turn around, there was a loud bang, and suddenly a group of dancers flooded the stage. It wasn't scripted, but they started moving in synchronisation as if it was. One of them waved frantically at the conductor to give them music.
John actually doesn't mind doing the housework himself. When he does the dishes, and Sherlock sits at the table by his microscope – or hovers and insults him – it may seem an unfair division of labour. But somehow it feels as though they're still doing it all together.
John    16:52
His expression changes minutely when he looks Sherlock in the eye; almost as if he's smiling, but his mouth doesn't really move. While keeping eye contact, he burrows his fingers deeper into Sherlock's curls. Sherlock feels his eyes growing wide. This is
See, I would be flattered, but if you didn't

Sherlock's pause is barely there. “Of course”, he says indifferently before turning back to his microscope, as if John asks this every evening. As if this is all

Sherlock plays the air clearer, he plays the sun warmer, he plays the bees safer. He plays until he and his violin are a part of the earth, and every being – every bee, every flower, every human – is home.

“They're dead.”

Afterwards, he was lying in my arms, back pressed against me. He was cooling fast under a layer of sweat, so I put us under the covers, stroking his chest and his arms to keep him warm.

An unexpected shudder shoots through Sherlock's body, too sudden to hide. Watson sees it and the corner of his mouth lifts, at once making him look predatory.
different.”
John    14:32
“But it doesn't make any sense, does it?” Mary went on, folding her arms across her chest. “The Maharajah offers the Dancer everything, but the stupid Dancer throws it away to be with the Penniless Writer.”
And I will do anything for him. I had defied suited men with guns to have him, if only for this fleeting moment with him in my arms. Everything was unimportant beside him; the rush of blood silenced in my ears, the applauding audience faded away.
The great silence was starting to be disturbed by the confused shiftings of the audience. A murmur started somewhere in the middle, steadily spreading to all sides.
“… I was nervous about being with a man, but it… it feels so great. You are so sexy, and your body is amazing, and I want nothing more than to just… just touch you… I want to see you come, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, you know that is not how it works.” It was the first time I heard anything resembling human emotion in Holmes' voice. In fact, Sherlock is the only one I've seen push his buttons enough for the ice exterior to slip. “You have to cooperate with the rest of the ensemble for this production to succeed.”
John stares at him. “Well why didn't you tell me you didn't want to? It's our

I kissed him. Slowly, tenderly, I kissed in the way that belongs to him. When I let go, his eyelids were still pressed together. “I said don't say it.”
Beside it, there was a new photo. Never underestimate the sneakiness of Mrs Hudson – I had no idea she had taken this picture, I don't even know when she did it. She must have sneaked into 221B at some point and found us like that. And then she thought it appropriate to frame it on her mantelpiece for everyone to see. Sherlock will be mortified.
The moment John sees him, a raw sound tears itself from his heart and lungs.
John laughs.
Sherlock heaved a great sigh. “Whenever you're ready, then.” He stretched out on the bed, bending one knee on the covers to open up his thighs. He extended one arm towards me, letting the hand hang limply over the side of the bed, and placed his other hand on the corset just beside his crotch. He looked like a dead heap of black lace and white skin in the sea of red velvet pillows. His head rolled to the side, lips parted indecently, his face passive and expressionless. But his eyes were sharp and bright, a fresh blue-green well right in the middle of the suffocating crimson of the elephant chamber.
“It's romantic.”
. His eyes blatantly wander down Sherlock’s open collar. He licks his lips, then forcibly closes his eyes and smiles in embarrassment.
No matter how he tries, he can't stop thinking about it for the rest of the trip. His thoughts constantly slip back to the sofa in Sherlock's new flat. He sees Sherlock's face before him, lost in pleasure.
“Happy New Year, silly”, John smiles and gets out of bed.
Sherlock's mouth is soft and open for John, letting him take the lead. He's quivering on top of John, breathing in sharp bursts, his hands clutching at John's shirt with less purpose and more helpless desperation. The great Sherlock Holmes' brain seems to be in short-circuit, and that may be the hottest thing John has ever seen.
The last of the snow has disappeared from the fields and the mud on the road has dried. The stifling quiet of the snow-blanket is gone; now the birds sing and the brooks murmur, and the earth explodes with life. On one day Drömme goes in those familiar colours of brown and grey, and the next, everything is bright green. The burst buds on the birches hold small, fragile leaves, bold and curious and growing fast. When the spring-winds blow, the new leaves whisper. The aspen by our house rustles oblivion as aspens do.
are going to learn your lines and listen to Stamford's directions. And in the break, you are going to eat something.”
I pressed my lips together. “The only thing.”
Hey, how are you feeling?
He wanted me to know that there's nothing more I could have done. This – what we had those last days – was all he asked of me and all I could give.
“But I do now,” John shifted and stared into his eyes. “And you bloody know what? I’m ready to do nothing but love you for the rest of our lives.”
“Hello.”
chair.
. This was his? John never remembered this around the flat...did he go back to his parents’ house to get this?
And now, suddenly, Sherlock looked like he could have started crying. His eyes turned ridiculously blue, face open and vulnerable. “John?” he rasped.
The lobby is empty, only a receptionist to witness their uncomfortable gait as they cross to the lifts. Sherlock slams the call button, and John stares at the ceiling, praying to God to cut the time until he has Sherlock in private, if only by a handful of seconds.
John 10:51
Rosie's hospital room is heavy with illness and the ceiling is lowering. John and Sherlock spend more time with the child than either of his mothers do, whispering worriedly through the nights and making it a point to laugh during the days.
What he does know is that when he turns around, he will see John leaning against the doorframe.
. The tune going on a loop in your head.”
William lies on top of the blankets with his arms folded beneath his head. The buttons of his white shirt strain on top of his chest. I lie on my side and pretend not to study them.
“You’re a genius.”
He's always reminded of it when he has Sherlock in his arms, hair ruffled from sleep, breaths loud with pleasure in his throat. That's the real Sherlock. But John has to manage without that reassurance now. He has a girlfriend. He can't do the same things with his mate as he does with her. She's the one who should fill his need for hugs and cuddles – that's what girlfriends are for. He can't very well alternate between sleeping in her bed and in Sherlock's.
The door banged against the wall when the stage manager arrived, a skinny man with a perpetually disgusted face. “All right, you girls”, he said in a nasal voice, “get back out front and make those gents thirsty.” He stopped before Martha, not bothering with so much as a glance at Sherlock. “Problems?”

I felt foolish for thinking that things could be different. But Stamford wouldn't let me sink back into my depression in peace, instead persisting in dragging me up to the surface over and over. He showed me the city – well, the neighbourhood, as I couldn't get far on my bad leg – and he dragged me into his own flat for tea he'd brought from England. When I refused to come, he settled on playing for me from the other side of the wall. Those evenings were the best.
“No, because I prefer to spend my time on that which is important, but I don't expect a simpler mind to understand.”
“I don't remember much of what followed”, Sherlock went on. “I had no money, I needed the drugs. All I could offer was my body, so I did.”
Sherlock rises from the floor on stiff legs and removes his hand from his pants with a disgusted grimace.
John    15:02
anything. I wanted to hurt him, I wanted to kiss him until he broke, but I couldn't, I could barely hold on to his pressed collar, and I could absolutely not let go.
“Of course I don't”, I murmur. “It's not my place to judge you.”
“Oh, yeah? How many can I have?”
“So, what brings you here?” I ask him.

Being open like that, in every sense of the word, it was. It was so intimate it felt like my mind was shattering. Like giving him an entry to my body gave him an entry to my soul, baring it all for him. The only thing keeping me from falling apart was that I was still in control. At one point he moved to take me in his hand, but I barked at him not to touch me.
John accidentally takes a sip from the tea that's gone cold long ago. This isn't how he wanted to spend their anniversary.
Are you on your way? SH
So this was all category 1?
I can see what John means. The muddy brown from the day she was born is brightening into a deep blue.
I suppose the endgame is you rushing home
There is no way to gather the data needed to make an informed decision. They can discuss every angle of their relationship and hypothesise the outcome of a romantic endeavour, but they will never be able to prove their theories.
He isn't good for you and he never has been.
When my eyes were dry and my chest empty, I lifted my head. He tipped his head back, looking at me. His undersea-rainbow eyes were floating, the whites were streaked with red. He looked so tired. And still, he shone when he looked at me.
Holm William and I have the dance floor to ourselves. The fiddler stands in his usual place in the middle and we're on opposite sides of him, walking in wide circles. The benches along the walls are crowded with people who watch us with anticipation. You can see in their eyes, in the way they lean forward with elbows on their knees, that it's been some time since there last was a halling contest in Sidensjö.
When he moves even closer, John has to tip his head back to hold his gaze. His face is stubbornly set, as if daring Sherlock to judge any of the things he just deduced about him. His pupils are wide and alluring, and a pink kitten-tongue darts out to wet his thin lips.
“Sherlock.”
“Sherlock's friend.”
Now I can only see the upper half of her face. Her tiny nose peeks out of the blue fabric of the scarf. She has a shocking amount of hair; dark-blonde streaks of it are plastered against her forehead. Her eyes are open. She blinks, silent and alert. I try to shield her face without quite succeeding, quietly asking her if she is sure she shouldn't close her eyes for a bit. But she stubbornly keeps them wide open, looking at the strange world she has been abruptly brought into.
When she has finished eating she throws up on my silk shirt. Alarmingly, I find this more adorable than annoying. And my shirt will smell of her when I’m no longer holding her.
Yeah, I just go with what feels good in the
It was a vaguely familiar tune but he was only humming at that point. I stayed in bed a little longer, revelling in his scent left in the room.

one any more.
There was a long silence. Maybe there was some part of Sherlock still hoping for restitution; if not Holmes' blessing, then at least his apology. Holmes must know exactly what had happened in the tower. The evidence was everywhere.
Sherlock scoffs.
There's a movement behind the glass. Nerves tingle in my belly when the window opens and William's curly head pokes out.
I was the one to break the silence. “And- and did you… I mean, are you-”
This time, when they kiss, John is not holding back. The sweet torture of keeping the boundaries will soon be gone, so it doesn’t matter how close they come or how tempted they are to break the rules. Sherlock tries to keep up but instead just melts between John’s firm hands and determined mouth.
After four dances we sail off the floor and out of the barn. To have a fifth dance in a row with the same person is inappropriate if you aren't trying to actually woo them; it's the unspoken rule, just as it would be rude to dance less than two dances with any partner. It's just as well, really, because right now I need some air.
by text, John. SH
John    14:07
At this point, I couldn't stop dancing if I wanted to. Thirst, fatigue and lack of fresh air all become secondary to the heat in my muscles and the triple time beat in my feet. Täpp Lisa and I move into our fifth dance together, and Holm William dives into a hauntingly despairing melody. My world narrows down to the dramatic pulse of the polska, the acute feel of William's gaze on my skin and the red skirt in the edge of my vision.
I put my hands upon his, wrapped around my waist, and thought,
You know you don't have to keep flirting with
“I assume you want some supper?” He stopped by the small table where a shining silver service stood. “A little champagne?” His tone was bordering on mocking around the last word, clearly expecting I would jump at the offer.

strangled? Being forced to kill yourself?
“It would be surprising if you had.” There was a slight smile in Moriarty's silky voice.
I am sitting in the cafeteria at St Bart's hospital. She is in a baby carrier on my front. Although I was the one to buy the carrier this is the first time I’m wearing it. She fits snugly against my chest, pressing against my ribs so that I can feel her tiniest movement. She fell asleep within ten seconds of settling against me in spite of the unfamiliar smells and unforgiving lights of the hospital building.
You're ridiculous.
“The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street”, he breathes hotly across John's parted lips.
John    11:10
The rails start humming long before the train is in sight. It's a subtle sound, but if you listen for it, quite obvious. Sherlock picks it up from where he's standing on the platform, as close to the tracks as allowed, gazing impatiently into the distance. When the train appears, the early June sun glimmers on the metal.
She looks at him curiously, seeing thoughts behind his eyes. He clears his throat and turns away, even though he knows there's only one person who would be able to deduce what really happened.
“Do we not?” Sherlock murmurs, hovering just above him. John opens his eyes, finding Sherlock's still closed. He looks soft, his eyelids smooth. “But you have to admit, John, the lines are somewhat arbitrary.”
I was still shaking my head. Not a sound got through the thick lump lodged in my throat.
On stage, Mary was in the middle of her grand act. Her voice was high and sharp, singing foreign words, and she was bouncing like a puppet on a string. Acrobats floated in the air above her, backup dancers behind her moved in perfect synchronisation. The stage was such an onslaught of colour, movement and music that the cheering audience didn't stand a chance of catching every detail of the magnificent performance.
I looked at him, then back at Sherlock. “Oh.”
“Canberra.”
(The Sky is Full of Fiddles) – The song by Ulrika Bodén that started it all!
“Moriarty himself has been forced to undertake an unexpected journey”, Holmes continued. “As he left the city late last night, we have not had the opportunity to finalise the paperwork. However, I assure you that he is quite enthusiastic regarding the potential of the show, and there is every reason to assume that an agreement will be reached without any trouble. I see no reason not to start the rehearsals as planned, so that we may keep to the schedule. The show must go on.”
“John, please stop berating yourself,” he implored. “Please don’t cry, John,
John sat up, too. “I just wish I’d been there to help you,” he said with regret.
John stood perfectly still, heart beating so hard that he could feel it in his throat, palms sweating profusely. He felt like he was going to take a panic attack. He brought his fist too his lips and bit his knuckle.
But, John hadn’t said he was going to come over today. “John,” Sherlock greeted, his surprise evident in his voice. “Hello.”
No, it wasn’t. This was his fault, and his alone. He could see it: John’s look of disgust and disappointment when he found out it was Sherlock. He could imagine Mary’s smug face when John would tell her about it, and how he never wanted to talk to Sherlock again. But, no, she wouldn’t get to be smug. Her lie would be revealed. What an unpleasant situation. His heart clenched. He just wanted John to love him.
“You’re a moron for thinking I loved the Woman.”
“Good,” he said proudly.
John was silent for a moment. “You really think so?” he asked sadly.
Sherlock’s eyebrow raised in amusement. “Yes?”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hands so tightly it had to hurt, his mouth opening and throat tightening. He was sweating profusely. Was he going to pass out?
Trembling slightly, Sherlock placed his hand over John’s, causing him to look back up and for their eyes to lock. His heart pounded, and he held John’s fingers. He blinked at him, studying his face, and saw no secrets, just raw emotion. This was real. It was happening. “You…” His mouth felt dry. He swallowed. “You love me.”
Sherlock kept his breathing steady and quiet, but his pulse was galloping. If he turned his head, he was close enough to press a kiss to John’s hair, or mouth at his neck. He gulped. He could smell the musk of John’s cologne and feel his body move with each breath. Feeling John breathe against him was surreal, and his mind jumped to a fantasy before he could stop it. In an instant, he imagined lying in bed, John sprawled out on top of him, naked, and his chest rising and falling as he slept on Sherlock after sex.
Culverton unfastened his cuff links, getting ready. “Again.”
Sherlock and John exchanged glances, then their eyes darted away, Sherlock plopping back down on John’s lap to hide his pink cheeks. “Yes, well. Why are you even here?”
John licked his lips, blood suddenly rushing to his face. He cleared his throat loudly “Uh…”  Sherlock may have been inexperienced and a tad nervous, but he obviously wasn’t stupid. If he was asking this question, then he had to be interested in sex, right? John hadn’t even thought about that yet. What if Sherlock loved him but didn’t want to have sex? He would honestly be okay with that, but a not insignificant part of John wanted to make love to him. “Yeah,” John answered at last. “I was, yeah.”
“I don’t think anyone will find me in the midwestern United States,” she winked.
“No one’s ever called you a sweetheart before, huh?”
“That’s how you knew I had a bad dream?”
“Ok. Say goodbye, Rosie,” he grabbed her hand and made her wave.
Ayyyyy they're starting to bond and warm back up to each other. I think there's going to be some fluff next chapter. Some accidental snuggles? Maybe idk
They were infinitely happier than they were four days ago, but both of them knew emotional scars did not heal overnight. In this case, though, John didn’t want Sherlock to worry. It was just him being stupid about sex. “No, I just don’t feel tired right now.”
John pulled him into a hug, wrapping an arm around the back of his neck and pulling him close with another arm around his waist. He felt Sherlock tremor and wrap both arms around his back, fingers clawing into his T-shirt. He lowered his forehead onto John’s shoulder and let out a quivering breath. John’s throat was tight and he sniffled. He felt tears leaking out of his eyelids.
“Texting shouldn’t be this hard,” he said to Rosie.
“Yeah. Okay.” He wished the chair would swallow him up.
John was smiling. “And I’ll kiss you more when I’m not about to pass out.”
He paused writing for a minute to imagine if he and John created some kind of plan to arrest Mary. They probably would have come up with something. They could have gotten Mycroft and the Yard to assist them. The misery in their lives could have ended in 2015. He wiped his eyes and kept typing.
John couldn’t help but lunging forward and pulling Sherlock into his arms, trying not to sob into his shoulder. This was so, so wrong. The other Sherlock--that had to be it. He thought it was fair punishment. Sherlock said in the hospital that he deserved to be hurt. With the sudden statements of self-loathing, John thought that this was a building up for a long time. “Never,” John breathed into his hair. “Stop this. I’m not going to hurt you.”
“I know,” Sherlock cut him off gently, “I have confidence in you, I’m only saying. The prospect of being with you is worth everything else.”
It's the last chapter! I can hardly believe it. Thank you so much for reading this far <3
“You're
Sherlock looked down at his hands, then up at John, a question in his eyes.
"No, never," Sherlock said honestly, "which is why I reacted the way I did years ago."
John seriously hoped he wasn’t taking drugs again, but that thought was secondary. He should have been panicking, he supposed, but he felt like all of the tears in his body had already been shed, and the fear fizzled into nothingness after sending the letter. He was numb. He didn’t think Sherlock could say anything that would surprise him. He didn’t even bother getting up. “How’d you get in here?” he asked tiredly, his chest empty.
A part of him was disgusted with Irene, but he supposed he should have been grateful towards her. He knew the truth now. Even in death, Mary couldn’t lie to him forever.
Simultaneously, their arms slowly lifted and wrapped around each other’s bodies. John kept his arms high around Sherlock’s shoulders, but Sherlock’s arms were firmly around John’s back. John’s face was pressed into the soft, warm skin of his neck, and he had no idea how he was able to suppress a shiver. His heart was beating heavily in his chest, and he realized he was able to feel Sherlock's pulse beating steadily in his neck. The proximity was dizzying.
John sat back, sighing, looking at the stupid box in his hands. “I don’t want to propose to her,” he said. “Can you not mention to her that I ever had this ring?”
When Sherlock arrived at John’s surgery, he quickly slammed down the bouquet on desk, startling the receptionist, Mary’s temporary replacement, and said in the most cockney accent he could muster, “Tell Doctor Watson he has a delivery. These are for him.”
John put his hands into the pockets of his pajama pants, looking out the window. “Well, I wish I remembered that,” he said, voice gravelly.
“We all dream,” Sherlock said, his eyes closed, a lopsided smile on his face.
There were footsteps outside, and John’s head spun to the door.
“You didn’t bring a razor?” he blurted out.
“Mary?” Sherlock asked. “I should expect so, with my brother looking for her.”
“Sorry,
...sex.”
“I did, back then,” John agreed, “but never as much as I love you. And for the record, I regretted the marriage even before she shot you.”
Sherlock had turned on his side to face him, and his entire face was crimson. John was so tempted to look down and try to see if he were hard, too, but Sherlock looked genuinely flustered. He frowned. “Are you okay?”
“Quarter to midnight.”
This felt good. The embrace felt intimate and protective, and Sherlock wanted to bury his face into John’s neck and be held. But, John had a point. “You did,” he conceded. “I’m sorry, I suppose it’s still not quite sinking in.”
“What?” he asked, growing concerned. “What’s wrong?”
“But, there was a mark on your lip, it looked like a sign of struggle.” His heart stopped. “John, did she--?”
“Yep,” she said absentmindedly. She held up her phone. “John, let me get a photo of you and Rosie.”
John thought about it. “Well, it wasn’t bad. She looked nice--in my dream. Traditional white gown, veil, matching bouquet and all that. I don’t really remember much of the ceremony,” he admitted. “The dream was mainly about the reception, because you gave a speech.”
“I suppose you’re right,” she said in resignation, but just beneath the surface, there was something cold. “I want to stay here with him, though, if that’s all right.”
“Yes, but he’s fallen unconscious, and might be a little out of it when he wakes up. We’re putting him on heavy stuff; unfortunately, he had flatlined, and CPR failed three times. It’s a miracle his heart started beating again. He seemed to come back to earth on his own.”
“But, Mary--”
John wished he would cut the crap. “I think so,” he said. “It was a serious wound. It--it really should have been fatal,” he said with difficulty, “so I imagine the recovery process will be long, but he should heal.”
“You in these suits,” John answered, undoing the button on the suit jacket. “Always bloody distracting.”
John placed his hand over his heart. He didn’t like this feeling. Was he just projecting, or did Sherlock seem sad, somehow, to receive the box from him? There wasn’t a reason for him to be sad, at least not one that John could see. John had felt strange because, if he were honest to himself, that was never the way he pictured giving Sherlock an engagement ring. He bit his lip. That was one of his deepest fantasies, not to have sex with Sherlock (although he certainly thought of that), but to be the one to sweep Sherlock off his feet, show him love and sentiment weren’t all ridiculous wastes of time, and marry him in front of all their friends and colleagues.
Sherlock had no idea, no fucking idea what the problem was. John’s stomach rolled. He stared down at him, at the scab on his eyebrow and his too-thin face and eyes filled with far too much innocence for John to handle. At heart, he was a kind man, and John was
“I just had the same thought,” Sherlock said quietly, looking at the floor with his hands folded behind his back. “Out of all the men in the world, what was the likelihood that she would start dating you by chance? It doesn’t make sense.”
“John.” Sherlock tangled their legs together and hugged him around his middle. His head was on the same pillow as John’s, and up this close, John could see the small brown dot right above the pupil of his left eye. “You don’t know how much your love means to me.” His voice lowered to a whisper, “I never thought anyone would want to be close to me like this.”
There was a pause, perhaps an indication of Mycroft’s surprise from his compliance. “Come with me, then,” Mycroft said.
“I understand.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulders, squeezing them hard, head dropping onto one of them, as if clinging to a buoy in the rough waters of a sea. He was so bloody sensitive, and hearing the little, strained breaths coming from his mouth and feeling them puff hot onto his skin made John want to squeeze himself for some relief, but he had to take care of Sherlock right now. Sherlock’s fingernails were clawing into his skin, which was rather impressive, considering he kept them short, John thought. His back was heaving with each heavy breath, and if he weren’t busy doing other things, John would have held him.
John looked, and the cut on Sherlock’s eyebrow from his knuckles was still there. He swallowed again, bile threatening to rise up his esophagus.
He knew John was trying to be comforting, but something about his words only made him feel worse. “I’m freezing up. I don’t know if I can listen to my body,” he mumbled. John let go of his hand, so Sherlock looked up.
He had forgotten about her.
Damn it. He was distressed.
“She’s going to hurt us, John. She could break into the flat at any moment and kill us as an act of revenge. She already hates me. If she thinks I took you away from her--and she wouldn’t be forgiving to you, either, especially because she already suspected you of cheating. We need to do something about her,”
John remembered this, too, when Sherlock made his triumphant return and was adored in the papers again. He knew, too, that Sherlock enjoyed it more than he was letting on.
This felt so real--how could he be dreaming? Better question: how could he
He shrugged a shoulder. “It couldn’t be helped. Out of all the things in my life, that’s one of my least regrets.”
Damn his drugged mind. He closed his eyes. “Hm?”
Sherlock’s eyes flickered down to the sidewalk.
“Yes.”
Sherlock stared at him blankly.
John looked at Rosie. “Sorry for ruining your big day,” he said with a slight rasp to his voice.
“Who’s all this stuff for?” she asked. “I heard from the others that you sent flowers to someone?”
“But--” he said weakly, the morphine beginning to take over again. He was far too weak to be awake right now.
lock. There’s an ‘r’ in there.”
There was movement in the bathtub, and then the curtain opened. Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the tub, towel tied around his waist, his back facing John, but looking at him from over his shoulder. His curls were flattened out, his soggy fringe hanging down in front of his eyes, and the hair at the back of his head reaching down his neck. He had his arm loosely curled around his side, hand over the wound.
“You couldn’t have known that!” she shouted defensively.
Sherlock looked away, casting a glance over at Rosie. His voice was distant. “Yes, we managed just fine without her before.”
“I don’t think you're in the position to act like a prick after what you did today,” he said hotly.
Sherlock’s eyes shifted to glance at John. “‘You shouldn’t have come back.’ And…”
Sherlock was still breathing out of his mouth, but a little slower, now. “I didn’t mean to make you sad.”
“John.”
“Good.” He looked down at Sherlock’s abdomen with a grimace. “These are from her kicks?”
“You saved me,” Sherlock said emphatically. “That’s what you could have done, and you did.”
the embarrassment made me react harshly. But, god,” his ears turned red, “it wasn’t going well. I told you, it almost felt like a last-ditch effort for our relationship. I didn’t really enjoy touching her, and I’m not entirely sure she enjoyed touching me. Later, I was a bit glad you gave us an excuse to stop.”
“When are you planning on moving in?” Sherlock asked.
If you ever want to chat, stop by my
Sherlock looked down at their hands.
Sherlock’s heartbeat was in his ears. “Me.”
John didn’t like that she was literally looking down upon him, so he put his hand on the table and lifted himself up (not that he was much taller than she was, but…). “I’m sorry,” he told her. “I--wanted to go to dinner to see if I’d feel that spark again, but it didn’t really work out.”
“Who the hell?” John grumbled, wiping his wet eyes with the back of his hand and glancing at the clock. “It’s 8:30. Not that late, but we usually don’t have clients now.”
Rosie smiled and started babbling at Sherlock.
“I’ve always wanted this,” John told him sincerely. “Always.” Heart aching with fondness, he started to stroke through Sherlock’s thick, damp curls.
He sniffed. He looked at Sherlock, who was hunched over on the side of the bed, eyes glued to the floor. John knew he hurt him, but his cowardice prevented him from saying anything more. An unpleasant tingle rippled down his spine as he walked (stumbled) past Sherlock and out of the room, his throat feeling tight. He got out of the flat and downstairs, but had to lean his arm against the front door and try to control his breathing. He couldn’t walk through London while crying.
“You won’t have to work,” Sherlock suddenly blurted out. “You and Rosie will live with me once Irene is gone. We can share a room and Rosie will have your old one.”
Sherlock smirked.
Sherlock was exhaling hot, shaking breaths onto John’s temple. He shifted, and suddenly, something was poking John right above the belt. Without thinking John lifted his head and dropped his gaze, and his eyes widened, breath hitching.
“I’m fine now,” he assured. He thought that John was in a surprisingly good mood, considering the state he was in when he came to the flat. He looked at John. “Are
“Yeah, fine,” John tried to play along, tried to sound annoyed, but he started to feel a little nervous about this. “Just--sit up a little bit more, if you can, and tilt your head forward.”
John inhaled deeply, smelling Sherlock’s shampoo, and he nuzzled the soft curl at his nape with his nose. He kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck softly. Sherlock kept playing, so he figured it was okay. He kissed his neck again, allowing his lips to linger, parting them against his skin.
“What?”
The dark look in Sherlock’s eyes dimmed. “Well. Um. While you were gone, I read that the act of frottage creates excellent friction which leads--stop laughing!”
“I wasn’t going to; I was going to your sofa.”
The image of Sherlock, eyes hazy, fringe sticking to his forehead, lips red and plump, and his cock completely erect, barreling towards John and climbing on top of him, would not leave John’s memory for a very long time.
John went over to the dresser and retrieved it. “I’ll put it in my jacket pocket. Are you okay?”
“Oh god, Rosie!” he couldn’t resist picking her up, although we woke her in the process. He hugged her tightly, planting quick kisses to her soft, golden hair as she whimpered in confusion. “Daddy missed you,” he told her, a his eyes growing misty. “I’m sorry I left. I didn’t even know what was happening before it was too late.”
John exhaled slowly. “I mean, it makes sense now that I think about it,” he said quietly, more to himself than to Sherlock.
Sherlock actually felt a little bit of anger. “What, did I ever intend on having you tell me how you’re not gay and you’ll always love Mary?” he asked darkly, looking up at John from under his lashes.
“It’s all right.” Sherlock’s lips were tingling from the effort not to beam widely.
“All right over there?” Sherlock asked, a forced lightness to his voice.
She blinked. “Us? What about us?”
“John said it when he woke up, but he said he didn’t know who that was. It’s odd. The mind doesn’t conjure up names it had not heard before.”
The tightness around Sherlock’s mouth returned. “I know.”
Mycroft narrowed his eyes. “She was exceptional at her job.”
“For mocking me,” he stated with a lift of his chin, a failed attempt at being haughty, considering that his speech was distorted by a poorly muffled yawn.
Sherlock relaxed a little. “That’s true,” he said. “I don’t mind, though.”
John did remember how Sherlock’s eyes widened like a little lamb’s, firm confirmation that he cared. He remember Sherlock frantically asking if he were all right as he got the semtex vest off John as quickly as possible.
Sherlock began pacing around the room, but he was limping, hissing in pain and holding himself tighter, muttering
John realized his hands were shaking. He had to control himself. He couldn’t let himself feel rage, not in front of Rosie, and not in front of Sherlock ever again. He wondered if Sherlock had bruises on his ribs underneath his suit. He cleared his throat sharply.
“Sherlock, what’s she talking about?” Mrs. Hudson asked.
He didn’t know how to react.
But, god damn it, it
John did pull back, though, his warm eyes hazy. He grinned. “There. The frown’s gone now,” he breathed.
“Shut up. I’m ranting.”
More ice filled John’s blood, and he hugged Rosie tighter. His heart started to pound.
Sherlock snuffled. “Mmm, love you, too,” he mumbled into John’s T-shirt.
John walked briskly as he could, and he knew that he wasn’t far from Lestrade’s. He must have looked bonkers, walking down the street with red eyes, no jacket or shoes (in November, of all months), but he only cared about Sherlock’s opinion at this point, and he knew what that was. He didn’t know how much time it took him, but then he was knocking on Lestrade’s door, and thank Christ, he opened up.
“If you need any help, let me know. While you’re in there, I can get everything for you in the kitchen.”
Sherlock flushed and he grumbled “Yes, well. I had never experienced that particular type of stimulus before.”
The last thing he felt before exhaustion overcame him was Sherlock’s large, warm hand turn around and lace their fingers together.
Sherlock only frowned. “Because of me.”
It took three hours for Sherlock to compose a response, partly because he had to choose his words carefully, and partly because he had to pause to drink water to stop his fingers from trembling over the keys.
Rosie didn’t say anything.
“Is that a ‘yes’?”
Sometimes, he thought Sherlock had more tact than people gave him credit for.  “Good point.” He got up and retrieved his phone from his jeans pocket, forgotten in all the excitement.
“You plan on lying down?” Sherlock asked.
. She listened to him
John almost jumped, completely surprised (and seriously pleased), but Sherlock took it the wrong way.
“We’re definitely going to have to have sex again,” Sherlock’s eyes traveled down his body.
“Thanks,” John said, and sat down at the table with a yogurt. “Have you eaten?”
“John?” Sherlock sat beside him. “What is it?”
Sherlock stared at him. He blinked and then shuffled some of the papers around on his bed. “All right. If you don’t want to stand there the whole time, you can sit here,” he said as he created a space on the edge of the bed out of the sea of files.
“She banged my head against the wall and the floor several times. There’s a gash on my forehead?”
John sighed. “Come out, Sherlock.”
Sherlock followed him dumbly, realizing he was a little hard. Did John see?
“You’ve changed.”
Sherlock sighed, bringing his playing to a halt. “You’re incorrigible.”
“Ouch!” John swatted his hand away. He rose to his knees. “Scoot over.”
Lestrade looked at John from over his shoulder, eyes sympathetic, and he looked tired, too. What time was it?
(See the end of the chapter for
I want to stress, again, that Sherlock is gay (and Irene!) and John is just being dumb lol. No adlock here. Anyway I hope I got across John's frustration and confusion and all around unpleasant mood in this chapter and it wasn't just a jumbled mess.
“He was worried. At least talk to him for a few minutes,” he insisted.
John sat up and stretched. “I’m going to get a drink. Want anything?”
“I…” John started one day. “I keep having dreams.”
John’s hand grasped his shoulder. “Sherlock,” he said comfortingly but steadily, “it was just a dream. Open your eyes.”
Sherlock kissed him back, hoping his heartbeat was audible only to his ears. He told his mind to be quiet and focus on the sensation of their lips molding and smoothing together. He wanted to hold John and envelop him, cover him with his body in this bedroom where they were in their own little world. He didn’t know how to go about doing any of that. Maybe he should have taken up Janine’s offers for sex in the past. Despite her being a woman, it still would have been some sort of experience. He wouldn’t have liked it, but would have been prepared for this to a degree. He was lost, and while he was content, in theory, to let John kiss him and take the lead, he was supposed to know what he was doing. If questioned, he supposed, he could say John always took the lead during sex. Yes, he would do that.
John gasped and stumbled backwards, causing the man to stumble forward and trip. John made a dash to the door of 221B, managing to turn the handle and swing the door open. “Sherlock!” he shouted at the top of his lungs before he felt a sharp jab to his neck and fell backwards into darkness.
“I love you,” Sherlock said instead, his tone small and sweet.
The sharp pain in John’s stomach dug deeper. He told himself to stay calm, and to think about it. If she had been in Sherlock’s bed because of--
“Of course,” he humored him. His gaze grew somber. “Thank you, John,” he said quietly. “For everything,” he clarified before John could ask. “For being patient, especially.”
“But it’s not just sex,” Sherlock said, not looking at him. “I’m not--accustomed to any of it. Any intimate interactions.”
John gazed up at him. “Why did it take us this long?”
John gave the phone back. “Pictures aren’t the same as memories, but it’s better than nothing.”
“A ring on me would wind up lost inside a corpse.”
Sherlock turned his face away, shrugging one shoulder with a sniff. “It’s not important to me.”
He did it again, and put the mallet in her hand.
Sherlock blinked slowly. He held John’s (now clean) hand and brought it to his lips, kissing it softly. “We can be us again.”
He sighed. “You’re making my guard come down completely tonight, aren’t you?”
Sherlock’s eyes were brimming with tears, and his mouth was open, frozen in an aborted grunt of pain.
“Why must you piss off every health professional we encounter?” John asked.
Sherlock let out a relieved exhale from his mouth. He had no idea who was at the door, but he definitely owed them. “I thought I’d heard someone on the stairs,” he lied.
“Give it up!” she hissed into his ear. “You can’t cheat death this time.”
Someone on the pavement shoved into him, and John scowled. “Oi, watch it.” Wait. Something felt very familiar about this. His gut told him to whip around, and he saw a man coming at him with a syringe.
“Do you want me to touch you?” John whispered in his ear.
Sherlock turned around in John’s arms. “You were?” he asked skeptically.
Lestrade left, and Sherlock turned to Mrs. Hudson. “Make the tea anyway.”
“Fine. How ‘bout a kiss and a cuddle?”
He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, leaning his elbows on his knees and cradling his head in his hands. He thought that a night’s sleep would give him an answer to his problem, but he felt just as lost as he did a few hours ago. Waking up this morning, wet and miserable in his bed, only emphasized how lonely and pathetic he was without John. He wondered for the thousandth time what waking up with John was like, and he forced his brain to stop the thought. That was pointless if John didn’t even think he could be in a fucking relationship.
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered back, and he sounded like he meant it. “Are you?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and his breath hitched so sharply that he coughed.
At least he got to hug John before their relationship ended.
“Do that?”
“No,” Sherlock said easily, “and I intend to keep it that way.” He crossed his legs. “Let me be plain, John. I’d lay down my life for your child, but I won’t change her.”
For some reason, Sherlock got that immediately. “Ah, yes.”
Sherlock looked down at the ground. “I know. I...for what it’s worth, I missed you, too, John.”
“Oh, hello,” John said, feeling foolish for running down the stairs like a lunatic.
He shrugged the shoulder that wasn’t squished into the chair. “Nothing. I’m just happy.”
“Don’t do this,” John said, and he sounded tired this time. “Please. I don’t want us to fall apart when we’ve only just started.”
needed to be held more. Their years of tension didn’t end with a bang, but a weary murmur.
“I never meant for you to find out,” she huffed. “I meant to leave all that behind me.”
“I really don’t,” Irene said honestly. “Like I said, I only knew her by name. I didn’t really talk to any of his workers. John, she’s your child’s mother? Wait, she’s dead, isn’t she?”
Mrs. Hudson had said. “
John didn’t know what that had to do with anything at first, but he started to understand. “You mean--is it a lot because no one ever touched you for this long?”
John felt him swallow and he trembled. Lifting his head, he nodded and tried to take off Sherlock’s shirt as he tried to take off John’s, and their arms and elbows bumped together.
“Why aren’t you in any of these?” John asked.
“Not at all,” John shook his head. “I want to know I’m making you feel good.”
“It’s a lot,” his voice rumbled in his throat, and John felt the vibrations.
“All right. Just--I’ll be home later, okay?”
Sherlock just kissed him again. They went on, holding each other and kissing deeper and deeper. John could cry from how right this felt. As he lightly nibbled at Sherlock’s lips, he found himself stroking his hip and realized they had changed positions. Sherlock was lying on his back, both arms wrapped around his neck again, and John was kneeling over him. Damn, when had he done that? This felt like a dream. He broke the kiss, breathing out of his mouth.
“Hmm, better for Rosie, and worse for me,” John winked.
Sherlock said “yuck” and curled his upper lip.
John realized. He must have liked what John said last night. Was it because Sherlock never had a true friend before John, or something else? It wasn’t like this was the first time John was kind to him.
He felt so confused that he was starting to get annoyed. “What are you talking about? Tell me, John.”
“You’ll be fine,” Sherlock reassured him, lowering his voice a little. “She loves you. She’ll be happy to see you.”
Sherlock blinked and frowned, taking a small step forward. “John, you aren’t all right,” he said carefully. “Would you tell me what’s wrong?”
John’s arm tightened around his waist and his lips moved to the junction where his neck met his shoulder, kissing him through his olive green dress shirt. It felt good to be so close to Sherlock, to share peaceful moment in their home. John moved to the side of his neck and sucked lightly, enjoying the warm skin under his lips.
John got up and walked to the doctor, and then they engaged in further conversation as Sherlock retreated into his own head. The past several minutes with John were
John was openly sobbing into his hands on a city bench. He had no idea if people were passing or if the sidewalks were empty. “What have I done?” he asked himself miserably. He didn’t think he would actually get his wish, so of course he didn’t think it through. He didn’t think he would lose his child. He felt like he barely got to spend any time with her. Rosie was barely over a year old in the other universe, and because of his stupid, selfish self, he hadn’t even been with her the entire time. He felt like he barely knew her. Even so, he grew attached to her. He loved her. But now, John was essentially crying over a person who never existed, and could never come to exist.
. Guilt tasted sour on his tongue. “I’m sorry. It was wrong of me. I didn’t know how else to approach the topic.”
“Don’t care,” Sherlock fished his phone out of his suit jacket’s pocket. “Just order.”
Sherlock started laughing. “John, that’s unethical.”
John had all of his boxes in 221B by 2:30 in the afternoon.
“Yes. Me too,” his eyes grew wet again.
John looked up at him. “Sherlock, what did you really think of Mary? Tell me the truth.”
Sherlock teethed at his bottom lip. “I think I should be saying these things. I was the one sending mixed signals.” He was silent for a moment. “You know I fear my emotions being my downfall; however, my efforts to close myself off from you have been futile. ...” He trailed off, thinking. “I don’t know when it happened, but by the time I heard you and Irene at Battersea, I was frightened of how much I desired being with you. You’ve drawn me in like no one else, so if you were to take my heart and ruin me, so be it.”
The light switched on, revealing Sherlock. He held his hand where his wound laid under his T-shirt. His skin looked shiny and clammy--paler than it usual, all things considered. His eyes were huge, manic, bloodshot, and his hair was a mess. His mouth dropped open. “John! John,” he stumbled towards him, “look at that! You’re back.”
“Fine,” Sherlock said petulantly. He curled up on his side, resting his cheek against the back of the sofa. “Turn on the telly.”
There went the whole plan to act casual. Stupid body reacting to John’s jean-clad arse, and stupid heart for bursting with emotion.
Sherlock sucked in a breath. “What?”
Sherlock had said to Mycroft at Buckingham Palace.
John wanted her to stop touching him. Now was not the damn time to dwell over how he felt for Mary, but he still didn’t want her hands on him. It felt like a block of ice was in the pit of his stomach. He suddenly felt the urge to flee. He had to get out of here. He lifted his head from his hands.
Her blue eyes showed sympathy. “Oh, of course, John. You must be uncomfortable. I’ll be back as soon as I can!” She set him down so he was lying against the back of the sofa. She gave him a quick kiss on the lips, and John wanted to wipe off his mouth. “I’ll see you two soon.” She walked out of the flat, shutting the door behind her.
Sherlock lifted his head and pressed his warm lips against John’s cheek. His lips trailed to John’s mouth, and they started kissing in earnest again. His lips were insistent, but the breaths from his nose were shallow.
“Really.”
Rosie babbled a bit, and John wondered if she recognized the stairs leading up to the flat, trying to recall long-term memory abilities for babies her age. He pressed a quick kiss to the top of her head, her golden hair soft as silk against his mouth. He thought about popping in to Mrs. Hudson’s for a minute, but he knew once she saw Rosie, she wouldn’t give her up for a good twenty minutes, and he just wanted to see Sherlock for now.
The television was playing Jeremy Kyle. Sherlock hated that he knew who that was. He blamed Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock’s heart thudded with an all-encompassing wave of tenderness. “Yeah,” he rasped out.
“We need to stop doing that,” he said into his neck.
“I told you I’m done with that!” she shouted. Her eyes shot to John and she pointed at him. “I wanted to be married to you, John. I was content to be Mary Watson. I wanted us to have a life together. I was more than willing to live an ordinary life with you. I love you.”
A sharp intake of breath broke them apart, and it was from Sherlock. His red mouth moved wordlessly, his pupils large. He lowered his hand from John’s face, bringing it to his chest. “The morphine is kicking in.”
His fingers drummed a jittery rhythm on the base of his violin. “Nothing. It’s only that I don’t see when we--when you’ll be able to come here with Rosie,” he said, his tone tense. “You’d drop Rosie off at daycare in the morning and go to work. You’d work all afternoon, then pick her up and spend the rest of the night with her. You’ll be too tired to come over here after work. With Rosie, that is.”
Sherlock knew that terrible feeling all too well, only worse, because John actually did go off with Mary and marry her. No, don’t think of her.
John leaned up and brought their lips together. It was different from all of their other kisses thus far--it felt somber. They parted and stared at each other for a long moment, eyes roaming over the other’s face.
Sherlock walked past him, sat on the sofa, and patted the cushion next to him.
“I did, too,” John grinned. He was a little dazed by how good it felt. It was certainly a stress-reliever. He yawned, scratching his chest.
“Well, you’ll figure it out,” Sherlock said briskly. “Thank you for this, John,” he lifted his injured hand.
“Sorry, I know you want to be alone. I was just about to leave.”
Sherlock took it and unscrewed the cap, drinking it quickly. Drinking was something to do other than crying. The water did feel nice, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How did you know?” he grilled into John, his eyes alarmingly sharp for someone minutes away from succumbing to morphine.
It was a smack to the face, a punch to the gut, and confirmed what he already thought. John’s mouth dropped open, his heartbeat in his ears. “I--” he stood up. “I need some air.” He fled from the room, but didn’t go far. He went outside of the room and collapsed against the wall, hand over his mouth. He wasn’t crying, but he felt so terrible that tears would have felt like a relief. How could he have been so stupid? How could he have broken up with her and not taken some kind of precaution? There it was, laid out in front of him; Mary shot Sherlock in both worlds because she despised him. She didn’t do any bullshit surgery. She didn’t even primarily do it to hide her past. She hated Sherlock. She wanted him gone, and now it was directly John’s fault.
She was irritated, but finally opened her mouth and accepted it.
“No,” he said honestly. “There was no other option. Do you regret the people you’ve killed?” he asked bluntly.
John thought to himself. While it had been buried beneath his own melodrama, the instinct to care for Sherlock was in his blood.
The adrenaline was fading, and reality was returning.
He swallowed. “I do.”
Lestrade’s shoulders slumped in defeat. “Just one more,” he said.
“You’re on morphine,” John said, “and a lot of it.”
I feel like Sherlock's parents aren't used enough in fic, so I went with him seeking help from his mother instead of other suggestions I received, like Janine or Irene Adler. I actually wrote a bit with Janine instead, but it was shit, so I deleted it and started from scratch lol.
Sherlock nodded weakly, in too much pain to put on a show of being contrary.
“Listen,” he said quietly, “it’s something I’ve been thinking about for quite a bit.” Well, that was technically true. He thought things would have been better if he’d broken up with Mary the first time for almost two years. “I just--you’re great,” he forced himself to say, “but I don’t think we’re cut out for each other.”
Rosie whined and tugged on his jumper.
“Yes,” he said immediately, his tone suggesting the question was ludicrous. His eyes were no longer confused, now serious and completely focused.
“Sounds terribly dramatic, doesn’t it?” he tried to smile.
Sherlock squirmed under his gaze. “It was part of the plan.”
John really didn’t want to make this all about him, but the next logical step was to ask, “So, what exactly does that mean for this situation?” He really didn’t want to come across like,
Sherlock looked into his eyes intently, gaze piercing. John remembered a time when he was intimidated by that stare. “Why not?” he asked simply. Mouth tightening imperceptibly, he brought one of his hands to John’s face and brushed a tear away with his thumb, tender in a way John didn’t know he could be.
“Oh, I was just going to ask if you needed tea, but I’ll leave you two alone! I’ll ask for details later.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Being a solider, and generally a hotheaded person, John’s instincts always told him to fight instead of take flight. But now, he found himself backing out of the bathroom on unsteady legs, and without a word, he was out of the flat quicker than his brain could process, his socked feet hitting the cold pavement. He was still in his jeans and jumper from earlier in the day, but it was still too cold to be outside without a jacket. He didn’t care. His legs were moving, but he had no idea where the fuck he was going. The faces of strangers blurred around him, the wind biting his skin. He stopped in front of a door, and noticed his legs took him to a pub, and fuck, that was good enough for him. But he didn’t go to the counter and order a drink--not yet.
Sherlock was openly staring at him, lips parted, eyes scanning his body rapidly.
“As soon as you’re done talking out of your head, you’re causing trouble,” John pinched the bridge of his nose. “You need to recover, Sherlock.”
John was groggy and he felt hot, rhythmic breaths puffing onto the crook of his neck and a bit of his shoulder. He was too tired to really think much of it for a minute, and there was a comforting pressure on his chest, so he fell back into a doze. But, the breaths persisted and started to give him gooseflesh. John crinkled his brow and whined. He yawned, mouth dry from sleep. His other senses sluggishly kicked in, and he heard a soft, low noise, almost like a vibration. John turned his head, and his mouth met soft, messy hair. He frowned because the hair tickled his lips, and feeling that he was sitting (well, kind of slumped, but whatever) upright, he concluded he must have been on the sofa, and it must have been Sherlock’s curls on his face. John opened his eyes and looked down, but saw nothing but hair, and it clicked that the low sound he heard was Sherlock snoring into his skin and T-shirt.
Sherlock was looking down at his violin. “Interesting.”
John meant to sigh, but it came out as a groan. “Thank Christ,” he muttered. “When do you think I’ll be able to move?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m great. It’s just, what do you want to do? What are you the most comfortable with?”
John stood up, stretching, groaning at the tightness of his muscles. “Thank you. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
John snickered. “Really? Are you disappointed?”
John shrugged. “As okay as I can be,” he said, which he supposed was the truth.
John smiled, pecking him on the cheek. “It is. Good job.”
John could have cried just looking at him, but damn it, he cried a bloody river in the other world. No more tears (for now).
The commercial ended, and Gordon Ramsey’s
He took a deep breath. “John has amnesia. He doesn’t remember the past five years of his life, including Rosie’s existence.”
Sherlock felt some of his dark mood evaporate when he saw the hurt expression of John’s face, but then John put up his shield of anger.
Sherlock reached out and touched his knee. “John, listen to me. I’m happy that you love me, obviously, and that you want to be with me instead of Mary, but I’m not glad that this happened to you. I want to help you through this.”
“I didn’t see any article about this Magnussen bloke being killed by you, so your brother did a good job of saving your arse,” he said wryly.
John just stared at him, and shook his head, incredulous. “I don’t get it, Sherlock. Did you really think you’d be able to do this without consequences?”
He must have been saying John’s name aloud, because he felt a sharp blow to his mouth.
John’s hand stopped. Well, that made him feel foolish. He didn’t want to go to his knee-jerk angry response, though. Being impulsive caused problems between him and Sherlock, and Sherlock was hurt in front of him. He wasn’t well. “I would, you know,” he said, going back to carefully wiping the open wounds. “If I could hurt who did this to you, I would.”
That hurt to know. John was so overwhelmed, but the doctor side of him took over. “You’re going to lie there so you don’t put more pressure on your body until the high is over. You’re lucky I’m not shoving you into a fucking ambulance right now, but if you get worse, I swear to god, I will. When’d you take it?”
Mary snickered. “Look at you! You’re pathetic.” She grabbed the chain linking the handcuffs binding his wrists and pulled him backwards. Sherlock struggled to break free from her hold, but she threw him on the ground on his front and started kicked his side repeatedly. Each sharp jab made Sherlock grunt in pain. He felt weak and helpless on the floor. He tried getting to his knees so he could stand, but Mary grabbed his hair and smashed his forehead against the wooden floor.
John lowered his hand, disappointment in his eyes. “Christ. I can’t believe it.”
his mind supplied.
John must have misinterpreted the reason for his trembling, though, because he held Sherlock tighter. “It’s all right,” he murmured softly into his ear.
“I won’t. Where is she now?”
When John was alone in the flat, he mused to himself that he never thought his first mini fight with Sherlock as a couple would be over something like this.
“It…” He rubbed the spot. His brows furrowed further, looking perturbed. “You…” His voice sounded far away. “You almost died.”
“How do you feel?” John asked.
“If you insist,” he said playfully, and cupped John’s jaw with a kiss. His lips were soft and warm from sleep. The glide of his lips against John’s was slow and unhurried, with no trace of arousal. Kissing just to kiss. His foot lazily ran against John’s ankle, his toes warmed from the duvet. John wanted this forever, and damn it, he would have it. He was going to have this with his Sherlock no matter what, and if the universe were kind, this Sherlock would still have this with him.
Sherlock came back a couple minutes later and sat in the middle of the mattress, facing John. He had a determined look on his face. “All right,” he said and closed his eyes and puckered his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you can bring him home this afternoon.”
That broke Sherlock, causing him to grab John’s arms, this time, and drop to his knees. He was staring up at John like he was prepared to get yelled at. “John, let me explain,” he pleaded, voice shaking. “I had to, you see? I
John’s heart twisted. “Sherlock--”
Sherlock tried to push his arousal aside to think straight. “What’s wrong?”
Sherlock shows up at John's place the next morning.
There was a heavy, unbearable silence in the room.
“Roundabout,” Sherlock shrugged a shoulder. “After realizing how much you must have truly detested that ringtone, I deleted it. She wasn’t pleased.”
John grinned. “Yeah.” They kissed softly, and the sounds of their lips sliding together made the cabbie clear his throat. They kept kissing.
He gripped the edge of the mattress. “Nothing. It’s. It’s just that I forgot you almost died on me
EDIT 6/5/17: YOOOOOO there is now fanart for this fic! Khorazir drew
Sherlock’s breath was heavy and audible. “And I’m sorry for shutting you out, with Moriarty, and with how I always felt.”
He got Rosie into her coat and was about to carry her outside, but he peeked into his room. Sherlock was still sleeping, so he left with her.
The fact that there was a last time--that this was happening again--acidic bile sloshed around his stomach. John knew who did this. No one tried to attack Sherlock at this time in the other timeline. He knew it was her, the moment he saw the location of the wound. How did John not anticipate this?! He was supposed to make things better, and he nearly got Sherlock killed! But, he wasn’t even out of the woods yet. What if Sherlock didn’t pull through this time? What if he wound up fucking Sherlock up even
“Oh, get over yourself,” John said playfully, and picked up the towel from the floor. “If you’re that concerned, dry it,” he tossed the towel.
“I have no reason to object.” His fingers twisted a loose string on his scarf. “Before, I was civil towards her mainly out of courtesy to you. After she shot me, that is. Now, knowing she worked for him, I don’t think I’d be able to respect her memory even if you wanted me to. It would be difficult.”
Sherlock nodded again, looking no less winded.
John heard footsteps, and it sounded like they were going farther away from him. The music started again, and there were no more words.
John didn’t seem put off by it at all, though. Sherlock was in no state to analyze that. He was groggy. Once his body got a taste of sleep, it was going to try to pull him back under for a solid eight hours. He should have gotten up and gone to his room, but John was so warm…
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson said, sounding a little awkward. “I’m sorry, John.”
John raised an eyebrow. “You won’t show me your lovely arse?”
I figured I would disguise Sherlock to look like the dude who John actually thought was him in "The Empty Hearse". No reason other than a nod to canon :P
“Sherlock, what was he doing to you?” John asked him.
While things appeared to be healing on the surface, with Sherlock tentatively wrapping his arms around him, and then going out for cake to celebrate his birthday, John knew things weren’t right between them. He figured that was to be expected, considering everything they had gone through, individually and together, but even when Sherlock would give him one of his small, genuine smiles, John would not and felt as if he
I promise both of them will explain themselves lol. Sherlock wasn't being entirely honest with John, either.
Right. “I suppose this will have to do.” He licked his palm, and slid his hand under the waistband of Sherlock’s pajama and pants, wrapping his hand around his cock. God, it was hot. He gave it a squeeze, pressing two chaste kisses to his forehead.
“No, you’re not,” the bitter smile turned fond. “You’re John Watson,” he said, as if that were a wonderful thing, and the smile on his face brought small crinkles to the corners of his eyes.
It's Stambro Mikael's idea to begin with. Neither he nor Lestare Greger did much better than I did during the night-wooing, and they have spent two days whining about it. Mikael's intended girl had also shouted that dreaded phrase through the door –
Sherlock's heart rate increases when the train finally approaches his destination. He presses himself against the window to scan the platform – and yet, when he does catch sight of John's green jacket and silver hair, he doesn't feel better. If anything he feels worse, heart beat accelerating enough to make him slightly nauseous.
Sherlock hurried over to the opening, carefully leaning out and scanning the ground below. “I think we got rid of them”, he panted, leaning back into the room and collapsing with a shoulder against the wall.
means nothing to you right now
The room is dark, the only sources of light being the streetlights, cars and neon signs from the city below. They lie in bed together, watching the busy Cairo night. John feels fresh and sober after their much-needed shower, and Sherlock's back is smooth and dry against the front of his body, his hair a fluffy mess from the blow-dryer. There's something about lying with Sherlock completely naked and clean, soft cock resting against Sherlock's back, that's more intimate than sex.
Sherlock    14:06
Sherlock calmly strides into the cafeteria at five minutes to five. “You need to try harder”, he says when he sits down in the empty chair at their table.
I blinked. My tears poured down onto my cheeks, hurrying to my chin. Sherlock looked up at me, and he was smiling again. His breathing calmed. There was a relieved sound in it even as he choked for breath, because he had said all he needed to say. His eyes were warm, seeing nothing but me.
“Yeah.”
They can't let go and spin away in one direction each, holding on to each other through weaker bonds like words and looks.
I know love is blind, and that's why you let it
“Do you have music for this?”
John’s fingers reach the hem of Sherlock’s trousers again. He squeezes Sherlock’s backside and Sherlock presses himself closer to John. The bulge in John’s pants pushes against Sherlock’s thigh.
“Yeah? He tried to make you stay?”
Sherlock    13:55
“I know. But we simply cannot know beforehand whether the experiment will be a failure. And it’s too late to back down now. Isn’t it?”
“Of course. Follow me.” Sherlock strode away towards the door without even glancing at the costume assistant who had been working with him.
, and my heart stirred with what it recognised as true.
“Sherlock, stop it!” John gasps from the ground when he flies up into the air, the long swing ropes stretched out almost horizontally behind him. Sherlock ignores him, but John shouts again, and finally Sherlock lets the swing slow. He rolls his eyes when he knows John can see it properly.
“Hey Sherlock?”
Off to Tesco – see you in a bit
“Thank you”, he finally said.
“You know that doesn't work on me, Sherlock Holmes.”
The dancers and actors broke their poses. They smiled back at me when I looked around, some victoriously tilting their heads up to let the soft petals kiss their powdered cheeks.
These questions shake me. I am unfocused for the rest of the afternoon, barely noticing the departure of John's friends, all my senses blurry until we are in a cab on our way back home. I am grateful for the dark. The hum of the engine grounds me. In the companionable silence I rest my hand on the feathery back of her head and close my eyes.
You allowed me to be uncertain. You allowed me to be cautious. You smiled at me, then waited. You came out to me, you touched me lightly, you flirted not-so-subtly, then waited. You let me see your affection, driven by something else than biology. You respected me, to the point where it drove me to wishing you would stop doing so and make me yours. And that's when you did.
Sherlock groans and tips his head back against the headrest on his seat. “Bored.”
He often watches Sherlock from across the room. It feels like gravity pulling John towards him, and he has to stay focused to refuse. He can stand like that for a long time, debating with himself whether it would be weird to hug Sherlock right now.
John holds his gaze sternly, until he has to look away before he accidentally starts laughing. That would be inappropriate. The normal reaction to severed ears on the plate he used for toast this morning would be anger.
“I was unwell.”
Sherlock tries to kick up the speed again, but John holds the swing steadily. “Let go!”
“Things certainly

is a sign that we should swim? After sunset?”
“Clever you. You did your job so
“Leave us alone”, Sherlock snaps, missing her offended gasp when he shoulders his way past her and stomps up the stairs.
John    14:16
Breakfast is a disaster. They keep getting in the way of each other; John’s bare forearms and the way the muscles play beneath his skin; his grin when he catches Sherlock looking; their hands tangling together, drawing each other in.
And here we are, at the end of this tale. Thank you for following me through the series, I've had a great time with it! I'm sure gonna miss these soft boys.
John    14:00
For a week, John eyes every woman he sees. When one of them looks back, a thrill goes through him. She's out of his league, tall and gingery with dark lashes and a small, perfectly shaped mouth. Her sister comes into the clinic with a sprained ankle, and John successfully navigates the line of how much a doctor can flirt with the relatives before it's inappropriate.
. He sucks in air, his mouth falls open, he lets out a rough sound that's almost a moan, and when he whispers John's name, his voice rasps. “Oh, John… Stuck, he was
“Sherlock?” I asked, preparing to go and soothe whatever fit he was throwing. I had known it would only be a matter of time, and I pretended I hadn't been looking forward to it.
“Alright, Sherlock! I won't steal your kiss again.”
, but it isn't really translatable into English since it's a uniquely Scandinavian tradition. On bright summer nights when the mist lies low, it moves and changes so that it almost looks as if there are delicate creatures in there, dancing together.
He tells it through his mouth instead, placing a series of closed-mouthed kisses onto Sherlock's lips. Sherlock keeps instinctively following him when he pulls back in between, and it's at the same time innocent, wanting and vulnerable. When Sherlock's lips part, John's blood pulses between his legs in a way that makes him not care about the embarrassing sound he makes. Sherlock tentatively touches the tip of his tongue to John's lips again, and the uncertainty of it tells John that this is the first time Sherlock has done this.

He took a step back, and I regained control over my voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
something, but I can't come up with anything that will ever be enough.
I walked over for a brief kiss. I had barely pulled back before he started talking, his French so fast I could barely keep up, gesturing to the particulars of the room. When he showed me the brands of his new make-up, my eyebrows rose.
“Not really. It’s interesting to conduct experiments in space, though.”
I sighed. “You tease.” But I bit my tongue too late. He raced over to the rug and pocketed the 100 quid, then raced down the stairs before I could properly get dressed and follow him.
“Sherlock was
“Ah yes, Molly’s Equipment. What kind of… experiments do you conduct?”
“It’s Afghanistan, right?”
I rinsed off his knee with soap and water, and let that dry for a bit. He kept looking away from me while I waited for it to dry, and I realized it was because I was kneeling right in front of him. I coughed and rubbed the Neosporin onto his knee.
Sherlock grumbled, but didn’t say to change the channel, so John left it on, acutely aware of Sherlock’s proximity.
“No,” John said slowly, the strange feeling tugging at his chest. “It was different this time.”
John started to choke, and he gasped, forcing his breathing to slow down. He really didn’t want to vomit, even though a toilet was right there. His long, shaking inhales were loud in his ears. He put his hands down, and stared at the door of the stall with blurry vision, throat burning, and it felt like there was a gaping hole in his chest. He wanted to go back to the other world--at least there, his feelings were still secret.
She inspected me quietly while I inspected Sherlock. “You have a bruise on your arm, sorry, and I think you’ve lost a toe, but other than that you just need a good wash” I joked.
With that, Sherlock and I left for separate showers. I was glad that we would soon be returning to the ship, so I could finally have my private quarters back. As I lay there, reading an e-book, Sherlock groaned out. “I’m. So. Bored.”
So now I’m
“Would you read to me?”
“My name is John.”
It was at this point that I started to become annoyed with my incapability to communicate in the desired way.
“Really Molly,  I was more thinking of myself, you get dreadfully crabby when your hair is frizzy and I’d like to have access to your lab equipment.”
We knew not to pick favourites, for they all died so quickly and it was better to love all of the humans as one being. Soon, we were bored again.
“Take a shower, clean any minor scrapes, and come back and see me if that cough persists.”
“You don’t look too  bad despite it.” He muttered.
Sorry!! Real chapter coming soon! Ugh
My only response was a steady nod of the head. He seemed lost in thought before replying, “Was it something I’ve done?”
“…It’s a good idea in theory but… there are a lot of problems. How would we be sure to fall in the right place?”
He nodded and wrote on the top paper.
“Do you really not have anything more advanced?”
He smiled and started speaking in english briefly before I had to ask him to repeat himself as I was not yet prepared to start processing the language.
I turned over and stretched my hand out towards him, weary of the landing, but too late we realized we were too far apart, and as we fell tears streamed up towards the sky and I felt the fear between us, wondering if I would ever find him again.
“not really.” I answered before putting a bandage over his scrape. I stood up and said “Go take a shower, and replace the bandage. Clean it every day and replace the bandage, and be sure not to let it scab over, keep it moisturized. Don’t want you getting sick on us.” I turned to molly “and what would you have me do, Doc?”
Security officer Nevan Conner spotted us and I saw him go grey as a goose, eyes growing wide. He frantically waved us over, as if we weren’t already booking it towards him. Lestrade started to run towards us as if to retrieve us, but then remembered the explosives and ran right back behind his cover. If I hadn’t been laughing before, I surely was laughing right then. Conner shouted into the building and soon the whole security team and half the medical staff came running outside to see us fleeing the mining grounds.
“Wouldn’t it get done faster if we worked together?” he said, looking a bit disappointed.
“She’d set the table and called me down to dinner. I pushed the food around my plate in silence while she talked to her guests about my accomplishments. She’d urged me to talk and instead of replying ‘no’, I stayed silent for 15 days.”
I shrugged, smiled at our crew, and downed the drink right then and there. What can I say, the run had me parched.
an angel. He was a Cherub.I stared at him exasperated. “My name is Mike Stamford. What is your name?”
“So that’s why you’re off-planet?”
“It started while I was still living with mummy.” He gestured, as if his words were smoke billowing up and collecting around the ceiling. I absently covered my mouth with the hand on my chin, and I could feel how my breath was hot from the tea.
I covered my face in my hands and nodded. Damn me and my bets.
“Sherlock. His name’s Sherlock. Which face do you think he still has?”
Sometimes I wonder if it was all
“But the side of my rib hurts” he said.
I studied his faces, the bull licked his nose in a gesture belying his intelligence, the eagle looked reverently at the surroundings he would no longer be able to experience, the lion licked his teeth in preparation and his human face was smiling yet slightly green. The eyes on his wings were dancing about and I was suddenly worried about all we would lose. These wings and heads were a part of us which we weren’t eager to lose, but of course I realized it was a necessity.
“50 quid says you don’t make it a full day”
“She screamed like Mrs. Hudson might, crushed a few under her heal, and let the others escape. She called me down from my room where I was taking notes and I came down into the dining room, horrified. She made me clean up their corpses, and I started to consider my options of rebellion.
“For relaxing your muscles, and celebration, I suppose.” She said cheerily around the cheering of our fellow crew members. I could see the ship on the horizon, shining in the light, reflecting the orange of the explosions as they finished off behind us.
Sherlock handed out the items he had retrieved from the site, and when he gave molly her hairbrush, she blushed and said “Thanks for thinking of me” and brushed it through her hair like a fawning school girl yearning for his affections.
“Oh don’t be silly, John, you have your own wing” he said, before launching in to kiss me with such force that I was pressed against the back of my chair.
Just as realization dawned on me, I sprinted over to the mining sight and found Sherlock lazily packing the picnic basket a few of us had shared the night before, as well as a few scientific instruments he had brought with him. Panic-stricken, I grabbed him and ran him out of the blast zone. I really do think he’s at
“You haven’t said a word” he stated, as if trying to goad me into a response.
Is a lot like falling
“did the dirt effect your lungs, dr. Watson?” Molly asked.
I closed my book and let it slide to the floor to greet our pot. His elbows were on my knees now. If I were to lie I’d say I wasn’t lost in his eyes at that moment. I leaned closer to him, and of course, of course he did too.
“Read, then.”
“Hmm? Oh. Personally I think my brother just wanted to make it harder for me to get access to drugs.”
He chuckled. “Not a very social fellow are we?”
I’m losing my mind. All this search is making me
“Neym?”
He blanched. “You’re a… cherub?”
“Uh. Yea, I worked in Afghanistan, protecting civilians from terrorists. Got shot in the shoulder, though. Could’ve been a lot worse.”
“You don’t seem like any other fallen angel”
Our ship was once the envy of the world, Including the UK. The Americans had built it to explore,  to find living space, living organisms, and Mineral Riches. After some years of use, they sold it to the uk, for chump change. It was a fresh start for many of us, including myself, who had always wanted to work as a doctor. The Europa mining company bought a contract with the government to use the ship for mining expeditions and hired all thirty of us and blasted us out into space.
“They certainly have the power to touch and be touched.”
I pulled my key out and pushed it into the lock. I never could get the hang of locks, and I just ended up getting my keys stuck. After I managed to unlock the door and free my keys I realised it had already been unlocked when I started. Damn.
Sherlock frowned. “Aren’t you happy? Mary’s in prison.”
a good life now, and it was going to stay that way. He’d make sure of it.
So, I've been a little down the past couple days, and I hope it hasn't affected the quality of my writing. I hope you like this chapter.
Sherlock groaned in agony and squeezed John tightly to get him to shut up.
“So it’s better to make jokes over dead strangers than dead friends? Or, ex-friends?”
and told him to
“I’m not leaving you in here,” John sighed. He was exhausted, but too mentally wound up to close his eyes. A part of him still wanted time to himself to think, but that felt out of the question.
"How’d it feel when he beat you?”
John grinned. “Like what you see?” he joked.
It might have been a mistake, though, because Sherlock’s head snapped up, and his eyes were wide under the dark, wet hair.
“No,” he said. But, was that true? “Yes. No.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly. “You...I hurt you back then. I don’t--”
“Elderly people tend to get up early.”
Sherlock stood up straight, like a peacock, and looked at John from down the line of his nose. “Well, I clearly haven’t had the time to dry it, John. My hair cannot simply air-dry or it will become a frizzy, knotted mess--”
John gave the box to him, and their eyes locked, and he felt an odd pang in his heart. The jewelry box was small, and their fingers were touching. Sherlock held his gaze, his mouth tightened imperceptibly, and he took the box, and before he turned around, John saw him, look down at the box.
“It’s funny, I never thought I’d have friends to share good news with before I met you,” Sherlock mused.
“Great,” he said, looking down at the table. Thinking about it, Mary didn’t compliment his physical appearance often, although he didn’t exactly call her beautiful every day, either. She was pretty, he thought. But, that...was it. Pretty. Perfectly feminine. It made an old, deep-rooted part of him uncomfortable to think he thought Sherlock was more attractive than a woman. He needed to get over this. He couldn’t let himself be afraid of being attracted to a man anymore.
“W-why?” John asked, a tremor in his voice. “Why are you sorry?”
“She’ll receive an excellent array of knowledge in this flat,” Sherlock corrected, sitting down in his chair. He stretched his legs and nudged John’s foot.
Sherlock looked down and sighed. “John.”
“God, Sherlock, is that what you’re really bloody worried about?” John asked in exasperation.
Sherlock didn’t seem to care, though, and smiled ever so slightly. “I’m sure her foot wouldn’t have done much damage.”
Sherlock took a sip of water, fingers tight around the glass. “I’m still shocked you want to be with me after getting to know me,” he said.
