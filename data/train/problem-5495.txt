“Who the hell do you think—” he spits out, rage-dark eyes fixed on Cas, obviously about to spew some venomous insult. Cas widens his stance, squeezing Dean’s hand and lifting his chin, every inch of him screaming defiance.
Ava removes her arm from in front of her face for a second to wave at Jess. “Wish I could say it’s nice to meet you, but honestly, I kind of wish I’d never set eyes on either of you. This is not on my list of favorite days ever.”
, Cas had said, and Dean agreed, and like he’d told Sam--there was a lot of steam to blow off. Dean is now well-acquainted with the sounds that Cas makes as he’s being fucked, as well as the sounds Cas makes while he’s getting blown--he’s even come to know the sound of Cas’ low chuckles as he uses those damnable, long, elegant fingers to drive Dean to distraction.
“You’re in for a world of hurt anyway,” Sam says coldly, his expression carefully wiped of emotion. “Go on, Jess.”
Jess just shakes her head, thumbs flying over her phone’s keyboard.
Before Jess walks into the building, she pulls her jacket closer around her. Her fingers are tingling with the cold as she digs out her phone, but she doesn’t want any listeners for the conversation she’s about to have. Not even Sam.
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs, wanting to ask what it means that Cas apparently needs sleep now, but too heavy with exhaustion to make the words come out.
Castiel writhes on Dean’s lap. Every motion brings a teasing hint of friction to Dean’s aching dick, but he can’t focus on that now, not when Castiel is so very close to breaking. “You’re so close, aren’t you? I can feel you. You’re going to look so pretty when you come, but you’ve got to give me what I want first.” Dean nips at Castiel’s throat and drags his teeth along the sensitive skin. “Tell me what you want.”
“Don’t quote me on this; I’m not a professional,” Sam cautions. “But yeah. If I were in his shoes, that’s what’d I do.”
Cas tilts his head in confusion. “Weren’t you going to wait for your dad? You spent all this time looking for him, I thought…” He trails off as he looks at Dean’s face. Dean doesn’t know exactly what his facial expressions are doing, but he can guess that it’s nothing good.
Castiel sneers. “Going off the plan is reckless. It’s dangerous. It gets people
Dean thinks that’s the end of it, but Castiel continues. “The hunt that Jess and I went on. It was… different than I expected.” Castiel props himself up against his pool cue as he stares down at the table. His throat bobs with his swallow. Something haunted passes over his face, made mysterious by the dim lighting. He looks up at Dean, and he seems so much older than he did when Dean left for his hunt. “I think that the special children are going to give us a lot more trouble than we thought they would.”
Dean squints through a swelling eye to see Cas’ body looming over him. Blood flows freely from at least a dozen different wounds, trickling down over his scrub pants and staining them crimson. It puddles at his feet. Dean’s stomach turns, as he begins to see that they’re not going to make it out of here.
His nails dig furrows in Cas’ shoulders as he holds on for dear life. Cas’ mouth presses against his before trailing over his cheek to his throat. Dean cranes his head back, allowing him more access, and he keens in delight when Cas bites a series of stinging kisses down the sensitive skin.
Dean leans onto the railing as he waits, one foot propped on the bottom rung of metal. He looks out at the view, and it’s breathtaking, the shallow water of the river bubbling over rocks, the sun painting the trees above in shades of gold.
Dean doesn’t waste time. With Meg’s attention taken by Sam, he scrambles to his feet and sprints towards Castiel. With his mind dazed with pain and surprise, Castiel can only watch helplessly as Dean reaches above his head. A knife flicks in Dean's hand, and Castiel can’t help himself. With the memory of Meg’s scalpel fresh in his mind, he whimpers in fear.
Dozens of words crowd at the tip of Dean’s tongue. He swallows them all down, and instead calls, “Keep your pants on, I’m coming. God, you nag worse than Sam on a bad day.” He keeps up his grumbling all the way to the Impala, where Cas tosses him the keys across the hood. Dean catches them and tries to ignore the fact that, out of all the words he never said to Cas,
He breaks off mid-sentence and freezes. All of them do, listening to the sound that reaches them from just outside the annex.
Static fills the office and then a deep, distorted voice starts to speak.
Jess turns to Sam, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering circle of surprise. For all she knows him, Sam’s face is impossible to read. She can’t tell whether he’s ashamed, angry, or any one of a dozen other emotions. His hand, which had been clenched in a fist, slowly uncurls.
With a groan, Elkins settles himself on a small two-seater couch at the other side of the fireplace. He’s holding a tumbler with a much more generous allotment of whiskey than either Dean or Cas received. “How’s John Winchester these days?” he asks, eyes boring into Dean. He looks less suspicious than he did when they arrived, but there’s still a certain wariness just below the surface.
Cas looks up to meet Dean’s eyes. “Not Ellen and Bill,” he answers. A shadow passes over his face. “James and Amelia Novak.”
She should say no. Continuing to stay this close to Sam is really only hurting both of them. The shapeshifter hunt proves that together they’re erratic and unsafe, but Jess is also weak. She can’t deny that she misses Sam, and that she craves some reminder of what her life used to be like before everything went so fantastically wrong.
Sam stumbles a little as they make their way to the house, so Dean slips an arm around him to prop him up.
“Cas!” he snaps. When there’s no reaction from Cas, he shakes him. “Cas!” he calls again.
He holds Cas’ eyes so he won’t miss the moment his breath hitches, but pretty soon it doesn’t matter anymore because Cas’ weight is on him, and he’s being pulled into the kind of searing kiss that demands his full focus.
He lets himself fall back against the sheets, pulling Dean down with him until their lips are touching.
Though every atom of Castiel’s body screams in rebellion at allowing even a second of inattention when it comes to Andy, he thinks that Jess has earned a modicum of trust from him. He listens to the scratchy voice coming through the speakers. Immediately, it’s clear why Jess wanted him to listen.
“Yeah.” Sam takes a sip of his wine, swallowing down the words he really wants to say.
Castiel seriously considers walking right back out of the library when the woman notices him and looks up. “Oh, hello. Friend of yours, Dean?”
Sam’s hand closes around Jess’ with enough strength to grind the small bones together. His shoulders tremble with the strain it takes to keep his voice even when he says, “Thank you. That’s… that’s a load off my mind.”
Right on cue, there’s that old memory again: two guys holding hands, just walking down the street, and a slur, hissed between his dad’s teeth:
“I’m really not sure, Max.” Every word out of Sam’s mouth prompts a corresponding throb in his skull, and he can’t suppress a hiss of pain. “Not long, I hope. Excuse me.”
~*~*~*~*~*
“I thought Sam was supposed to be a puppy.”
“And Azazel,” Ava says darkly. “I can see him.”
The sound of Sam’s familiar footsteps approaching down the annex corridor jolts Jess out of an uneasy sleep. By the alarm clock on her bedside table, it’s almost two in the morning.
. You can yell at me about this fic, any of my other stuff, or basically anything at all. I'm mostly nice and always weird.
“Fuck you,” Ava spits out, still pale and shaking, but back on her feet.
“Did you hear that?” Dean asks, wondering if maybe he could have been wrong. Hoping.
Silence falls at the table. Sam is the first to break it. “Do you have any idea where this guy might be? Does he still come to the Roadhouse?”
His mocking turns to silence as Castiel starts transferring weapons to the Impala’s trunk. “What the hell are you doing?” Dean manages to get out, but only after Castiel’s performed a quick reorganization of the Impala's weapons stash to accommodate his own.
“Sam!” The sharp bark of his name snaps Sam’s attention back to Eileen. “Sam, I’m heading to the bunker now, alright? I’ll be there in a few hours, and you can tell me then.”
Azazel laughs as he strides forward. He plucks the gun from Dean’s fingers, and Dean, just as he was when he was four years old, is useless and powerless to stop him.
Castiel blinks slowly. “Thank you, Dean.” He swallows, suddenly desperate to try and bridge the abruptly insurmountable gap between them. “Dean, do you think that we could--”
“What about your father?” Castiel asks, a strange edge to his tone.
“You trying to convince me or yourself?”
“Good for them, I guess,” Dean says vaguely, unsure whether or not Cas’ sister’s PDA is a safe subject to pursue. He’s saved from hearing Cas’ reply when the others notice them approaching.
“He’s not.”
“I didn’t… I thought that you wanted—” Cassie’s eyes cut to Jess. “I’m sorry,” she says, not sounding regretful in the slightest, “but would you mind if I spoke to Dean alone?”
He takes the empty bed and tries to ignore how cold it is.
As Castiel makes his way down the red carpet, dozens of reporters shout questions at him in a dizzying cacophony of noise.
The last time they saw each other was about a week ago, when Dean headed down to New Orleans to work a voodoo thing his own research had turned up. It wasn’t his first time working a case alone, not by a long shot, and Dad had found his own lead that he wanted to follow up, about a stretch of road in Jericho, California, where people kept dying. Dean had a hunch that John looked for a case around here on purpose, so he could go check up on Sam. Not that he’d ever let Sam see him, of course. The old man’s much too proud for that.
“Cas,” he whines, his hips jerking forward into Cas’ grip. “Cas, come on.”
They drive to the Roadhouse, and Dean
By now, Jess has noticed his struggle. Her curious eyes watch him as Dean violently stabs his thumb on the answer button. “I swear to God, you’d better be dying, because otherwise—”
She leans against the side of the car as Cas walks up to the back gate, rapping against the weathered wood in an obviously pre-agreed signal of short-short-long-short. Sam walks up behind her, and their shoulders brush. He jerks back, and Jess is glad the darkness helps her hide her brief flash of hurt.
“Apparently, he couldn’t wait for me anymore,” Ava says tightly. “He told me that if I didn't come back to Peoria by next weekend, we were through. So, I said, we’re through, and that’s the end. Not really a complicated story.”
“Ms. Carroll?” Dean asks, extending his hand. The first moment of contact can tell him a lot about a client. The tremble of their fingers against his, if they’re willing to make eye contact with him or not, how earnestly they caress his Dominant’s marks.
Dean grunts. He’s not really in the mood to hear Sam wax effusive over the minutiae of how he’s managed to change the entire landscape of hunting from the haphazard way that John Winchester taught them to something that almost resembles a job.
A moment of silence hangs heavy over the car. The passing streetlights cast strange shadows over Dean’s face, turning it forbidding. Finally, Dean asks, in a hoarse voice. “The woman you saw… was it Mom?”
Pamela, the witch, doesn’t even pay him the compliment of rising to the bait. “Castiel, I thought you knew better. Designation services have been legal for decades, for people in your exact situation. Intercourse and other sexual acts can be included in the contract, but if that offends you, then you can get the basic package.”
“I just like yours the best,” Cas says, blinking slowly at him. Like he doesn’t understand that hearing those words strikes right at the part of Dean which longs to take care of his loved ones. He slides the pancakes in front of Cas, watches him slater butter and syrup over them, and gives up all pretense that he’s not helplessly in love with him.
The demon tilts its host’s head, studying Pamela with an unimpressed leer. “Oh look, a psychic. Scary.”
Cas’ hips settle against his ass, and a small shock of finality works its way down Dean’s spine. Cas tips his forehead to rest against Dean’s, and for a second, they remain still, both breathing in the enormity of the moment.
Pain, the likes of which he’s never felt before, grips Dean’s chest, sending him to his knees. His gun clatters out of his grip to fall harmlessly to the floor. Cas reaches out towards him. His fingers pass through Dean’s sleeve with a jolt, like someone just tossed a glass of water over him.
Cas leans forward as Dean’s fingers reach his ribs. “Dean,” he whispers, his chin lifting in an unconscious request for a kiss. Dean can’t help but oblige, dipping his head down to kiss his way across Cas’ chin before arriving at his plush lower lip.
Sam looks up from zipping his laptop bag to find the petite blonde grad student who helped him navigate the library’s section on occult lore. (Not that he particularly needed the help, but he’s found it’s usually better to feign ignorance than to seem suspiciously knowledgeable about all things pagan and monstrous.)
With difficulty, he pulls himself back from the edge. “Not that I don’t want that, because I
Hannah’s face loses its polite smile. “So you think that there’s enough evidence for a case.”
to me. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
It takes him a few minutes to find the cabin. Cas took the map when he left, leaving Dean woefully adrift in a sea of nature. Give him a tangle of backroads and two-lane highways, and he’ll find his way out every time. Give him a copse of relatively identical trees along a nondescript walkway, and within five minutes, he’s hopelessly lost.
, I…”
Bobby takes another drink, but something about his movements is off. The lift of his arm is almost mechanical, like an animatronic at the mall performing a series of pre-recorded motions.
That thought bolsters Dean through his shower and into his suit. The suit is a little too heavy for the warm night, but it’s the nicest suit he owns. He chooses a bright red tie to go along with the navy suit and white button down. The color suggests exactly what clients are looking for: it’s assertive without becoming boorish. The tie is also a cheat to let him know what clients have a bondage kink: they always look at the tie with just a little too much interest.
Dean doesn’t bother to argue the statement, as erroneous as it is. It counts as consent, which means that he’s free to start undoing the small buttons on Castiel’s shirt. He ignores the angry throb of his cock as more of Castiel’s tan skin is revealed.
Cas nods, his throat bobbing with a heavy swallow. “Can we just listen to music for a while?”
,” he says, something raw and pained in his voice. “Please, stay. We should talk. I want…”
“Of course there are some submissives who fit that stereotype, just as there are Dominants who fit their ‘controlling’ stereotype, and Nulls who fit the ‘bland doormat’ stereotype. But I think we can all agree that we’re more than the common misconceptions of our designations.”
“Asshole,” Castiel mutters as he follows more slowly, trying not to notice the small twinge of regret in his chest.
By now, Dean has his own routine. He pulls out a chair at the conference table, strategically placed so that he can see the whole office from his vantage point. He keeps his eyes to the door, ready to spring into action at any moment, though he doubts the need for him to do so. Any would-be assassin would have to be bold indeed to try and slip past the guards and metal detectors downstairs. He’s already examined Castiel’s office and instructed him that as long as he keeps his desk where it is, out of the line of fire from the window, he’s safe in there. Within the four walls of the suite, Dean feels like he can let his guard down a little.
“I’m sorry,” Dean murmurs. Regret clogs thick in his throat, gets thicker when he twists Cas’ arm behind his back and Cas yelps in pain.
“It’s unlikely. However, it’s equally unlikely that you would experience any sort of strong emotion, be it happiness, anger, or even sadness. Upping your dosage would be the equivalent of tossing a blanket over the world. I’d also expect there to be possible long term side effects.”
, and the people who are responsible get to do it all over again, and the world keeps turning, all because I wasn’t good enough to put together a convincing case!”
Dean takes a closer look at the cook. His stomach is a little paunchier than he would expect a monster’s to be, and a general air of neglect clings to him. He meets the cook’s eyes and sighs. The whites of his eyes are bloodshot and his pupils are huge. When Dean takes a step closer, he finally smells it through the grease: the earthy, skunky scent of some really good hash.
By the time Dean deposits Castiel onto the bed, his muscles are screaming. He really needs to hit the gym more if he’s going to be hauling around subs that are built like brick shithouses.
drunk. More than once, I saw bruises on Dean that he refused to talk about, but I knew exactly where they came from.”
Ava’s mouth twists in an unhappy frown. “I don’t know. Psychics? Demons? What am I supposed to tell my fiance?”
Cas kisses over his torso, leaving no inch of Dean’s skin untouched. Each kiss throws a little more fuel on the fire burning inside him, until all it takes to set him aflame is the slightest brush of Cas’ fingers against his skin.
When he casts his mind back, he can’t quite put his finger on the moment when Meg walked into his life. It was sometime during grad school, but their first interaction is lost to the sands of time. By the time he realized that Meg was probably his closest thing to a best friend, she’d already insinuated herself so deeply in his life that she was impossible to remove. Not that Castiel would ever want to; Meg is his best friend, his ally, his bulwark against madness.
“Me either,” Cas pants. His hips roll forward into Dean, and their cocks rub together, the way eased by sweat and precome. Cas works a hand between their bodies, wrapping his long fingers around both their cocks. Sweat drips from the tips of Cas’ hair onto Dean’s chest as he flicks his thumb over the head of Dean’s cock. “Come for me, Dean.”
Light arcs through the darkness, and Castiel blinks. This is a new form of torture. Meg must be stepping up her game if she’s trying to make him believe he’s about to be rescued.
Cas frowns. “Well, it was hardly my choice, was it? You all but pushed me out the door. I left, but you never asked me to stay.”
“Eh,” Jo says, shrugging. “That’s just Ash. Yo, Ash!”
The sounds around them are dying down. Dean sees hunters and psychics alike converging on the burning Roadhouse: Ellen, Jo, Bobby and Rufus. Some look a little worse for wear, like Pamela, who’s clutching a torn t-shirt to the bleeding wound on her head, or Ava, who has to lean on Jo for support, but they’re there. Alive.
“Dean,” Cas groans. His breath is coming in short pants and he’s fisting the comforter in his hands.
: Wow! it's hard to believe that we're almost at the end of this fic! When we first got the idea for this, FriendofCarlotta and I knew it was going to be a delight to write, so seeing your enjoyment of this fic is doubly wonderful. Thank you for your kudos and your screaming and flailing in the comments. They mean the world to us. <3
Suddenly, Cas grips his arm. “Do you hear that?” he whispers.
“Want any company?” Cas whisper-croaks. He can’t quite pull off his usual dry tone, and his attempt at a smirk falls painfully short, but Dean’s stomach does a funny little flip anyway.
With small, deliberate movements, Castiel gets up from the table. His mother’s expression slips for the first time, revealing bewilderment and perhaps the smallest slice of fear. “Where are you going?” she demands, trying for imperious but falling somehow short. She sounds more like a querulous old woman finding that she is alone and unable to grasp how that might have happened.
Jess raises an eyebrow at him. “Bobby, as in Bobby Singer?”
, and Castiel is more surprised than ever when he realizes there’s a smile pulling at his own lips. Dean doesn’t return it, having schooled his face back into a devil-may-care scowl. “Just sit and drink your coffee,” he growls, pointedly turning his back on Castiel.
“Thanks,” Dean finally says. His voice is low and a little shaky. He sounds more unsure of himself than he ever has before. “For… For this. Sam and I aren’t used to having anyone else around, and you didn’t have to stay, but you did anyway, and… thanks,” Dean finishes. He seems embarrassed by his words, ducking his head before he gets into the car. He shuts the door quietly behind him, clearly not wanting to disturb Sam, who seems to have slipped into actual sleep now.
“Makes sense,” Dean says. “If Dad’s trying to stay off the radar, he wouldn’t want to meet anyplace where we’d run into other people. Or... remember his voicemail? He said something big was starting to happen. Maybe it's connected to Azazel, and maybe it's happening in Blackwater Ridge. We won't know until we check it out.”
, the voice says.
“Really?” Dean tries to keep his voice as blank as Castiel’s, but he can’t hide the upwards inflection of surprise. It’s barely seven. He doesn’t think that he’s ever seen Castiel leave the office earlier than nine.
As they run up the porch stairs, the front door bursts open wide to admit them. It almost makes Castiel think twice about entering the house. Almost.
Despite the fact that it doesn’t surprise him, Dean’s dismissal still stings. Sam pushes away from the table, trying to swallow the bitter taste in his mouth. “Yeah. Whatever. See you tomorrow.”
Castiel takes the bottle from her. He’s sprawled artlessly across his couch, his bare feet propped up on the cushions. His fingers tingle as they wrap around the bottle, but he still brings it to his lips for a deep drink.
The hostess’ chirpy voice drags Dean’s attention back to the present and away from the questions racing through his head. “I’m sorry, can you repeat the names? I didn’t quite catch that.” Her pen hangs over her clipboard like the Sword of Damocles. There’s doom in the leaking tip of the ballpoint pen.
“Seeing you two together, I’d never think anything was wrong. And even if there was, I thought that you’d be able to figure it out. You two looked so happy last night, like you were really supposed to be together.”
Jess watches the familiar mountains whiz by in a blur. Excitement and anxiety alike roil in her stomach as Sam turns down a road marked
“I’m not going anywhere with you and Sam. You keep that gross, couple-y shit away from me,” Dean jokes weakly. Jess raises an annoyed eyebrow at him, and he adds, “Southern Missouri. Cape Girardeau.”
“Quitting time already?” Benny asks, stifling a yawn. He gestures around at the office. Sunbeams lance in through the window and dust motes dance within them. “You can see the excitement that we’ve been under here.”
“I’d like that,” is what Castiel says in response. It’s not a lie, but it does acknowledge the impossible.
Dean checks the chamber before he looks at Castiel. This man...This infuriating, inexplicable man, who leaves him wrong-footed more often than not, that Dean is sworn to protect, that sends a little squirm of
The drive from the library back to the center of town takes only a few minutes, but Sam calls Jess’ phone three times as he drives. It goes straight to voicemail every time.
Sam says they’ve been playing defense too much, hiding behind the wards and protections of the Roadhouse and hoping for the best. Ellen disagrees, pointing out that Bobby and Rufus are planning to work with the psychics on knife and gun skills. Between that and Pamela’s training, she thinks the day is getting closer when they might be able to take the fight to Azazel. Dean might have been excited about that if his brother and every other person he cares about wasn’t planning to march into that fight.
Charlie shrugs. “Nothing says you can’t mix business and pleasure,” she comments lightly, ignoring Dean’s
“Hey Cas.” The flimsy wood of the door jamb creaks as Dean leans against it. He coughs to fill the silence. Castiel doesn’t really spend much time cataloguing each of Dean’s coughs (that would make him creepy, and he is certainly not creepy), but he would classify this particular cough as falling somewhere between ‘nervous’ and ‘reluctant’. “Um listen, I’m not feeling so hot, so I’m going to head on to bed.”
Dean nods, clutching the steering wheel tight to keep the car on course through a particularly narrow curve.
“Too bad Cas has dibs.”
… and his erection is back. Wonderful.
“Good boy, you did so well. I’m so proud.” He keeps muttering praise, a glow settling in his chest at Castiel’s small whimpers. Dean’s thighs are going numb from having Castiel’s boneless weight atop him, but that’s a small price to pay in order to have Castiel’s thoughtless trust.
Castiel knows Dean is angry. He can practically feel the rage coming off of the man in rippling waves.
Jo cranes her head backwards at an angle that makes Jess’ neck twinge in sympathetic pain. Jess doesn’t need to look to know that she’s having a virtually silent conversation with Cas. She knows the type, if not the particular language that the Harvelles use. Whatever the content of the conversation is, it has a final result: Jo jumping off of the stool and pressing a cloth into Jess’ hands.
is falling back underneath his assault, her arms held up to ward off blows. Dean watches without blinking. He knows that his allegiance belongs to
Dean points to the far side of the house, where the flatbed of a white truck is just barely visible. “He’s probably got some kind of alarm system to let him know when people are coming. Had time to turn off the lights, but not to hide the car.”
Too dangerous. Novak is pure fucking danger and Dean needs to remember that. With difficulty, he pulls away. “Sure,” he agrees. He nods amicably. “Go for it.”
Stung, Castiel recoils. Hurt bubbles in his chest, hot and vicious, and he silently folds himself into the back of the Impala. He doesn’t talk as Sam joins them, or even when Dean starts the car and drives away. Castiel looks out the window, determined not to meet Dean’s eyes, even by accident.
much coffee.
“Don’t, Sam,” Jess says. “Remember, that knife won’t damage the demon. And Brady’s still in there.”
She’s sitting at one of several tables on a small concrete terrace that is strung all around with fairy lights and perched on a rocky ledge, less than twenty feet above the beach. A flowery sundress hugs her figure, and a broad-brimmed hat shields her face from the bright rays. Of course, she has no need to protect herself from the glare of the sun, but what is the use of omnipotence if you can’t dress to please yourself?
We hope to see you all there!! <3
“That’s why I decided to watch the building for a while, rather than approaching you or Jess right away,” Castiel explains. “I wanted to get a better idea first of what kind of people lived here, and what the nature of the threat might be.”
As quickly as he dares, Castiel steps to the side, out of Dean’s space, so he can drape Dean’s arm across his back. Then, he half-carries, half-drags Dean outside, depositing him in the back seat of the Impala.
“What’s the big fucking deal?” Dean finally snaps, massaging at his lower back. There’s a twinge, which can be attributed to bending over all day looking for
“Which is?” Sam asks, caught between irritated and amused.
Adler smooths an imaginary crease out of his suit. The late afternoon sun lances off his shiny bald head, and if he weren’t so disconcerted by Adler’s presence in Cas’ office, then Dean might actually laugh at the whole affair. As it is, however, he’s just very uncomfortable. He wants to put himself between Cas and this asshole (his job is to protect Cas and he can already tell that whatever Adler’s doing in here, it isn’t going to be anything good), but that’s not his place.
The forced retirement doesn’t make him happy. The bunker is the cleanest that it’s ever been and he doesn’t feel happy about it. There’s a gaping hole in his chest that’s shaped like the rest of his family, and he can’t sleep at night. He makes dinner and all he can think about are the empty places at the table.
news?”
For his part, Cas just looks at him, his eyes wide, haunted, and so very tired. “Dean, please,” he rasps. “I was just trying to help, please, you have to believe me.”
Not a moment too soon, Cas’ hands are back on him, kneading Dean’s cheeks, spreading them apart. Dean’s cock throbs in response to the touch, almost painfully hard between his legs.
Everyone else murmurs their greetings, except for Sam, who looks at him evenly. “Is it done?” His question immediately plunges the room into a serious mood. Castiel nods, and Sam’s expression softens. “How did he take it?”
“Dean?” To his dying day, Castiel will deny how his voice rises and cracks on Dean’s name, but when Dean pokes his head over the table, he forgets to be ashamed.
There’s something in his voice that Dean should pay attention to, some warning, some hint that something isn’t right, but he’s already so goddamn tired. He punches in an alarm for 11:30 into his phone and tosses it on the bed beside him.
“Yeah,” Jess says, meeting Castiel’s eyes, her thoughts clearly running along similar lines. “Very different. Has Ash found any trace of him yet?”
I hope you enjoyed this fic as much as I enjoyed writing it! I always enjoy the DCRB, and this year was no different.
Eventually, Meg makes a right off Grand Avenue, then a left, and another right. With each turn, the amount of foot traffic they encounter seems to diminish, until it’s just Meg, about a block ahead of them and on the other side of the street, walking past empty storefronts and abandoned warehouses.
Jess wipes the counter. “I was thinking I’d give my sister a call later tonight just to check in. I know she worries.”
He picks up the remote and puts something mindless on. The sound fills up the room, but Castiel only cares about Dean’s heart, beating steadily under his palm. Peace fills him, and Castiel’s head tips back against the couch.
How long did Cas refuse to hurt him, even a facsimile of Dean, before he was no longer given the option to refuse?
“I want all of you,” Cas whispers as he kisses down Dean’s neck to his chest. There’s a quick flash of blue as he looks up at Dean through dark eyelashes. “Please, Dean.”
Castiel’s eyelashes flutter on his pale cheek, and Dean grins. “That’s it, buddy. Come on.”
“Okay, I know you’re a master of understatement, but this is ridiculous. That is the hottest man I’ve ever had the pleasure to look at,
“It’s so good to see you, Bobby,” Sam gushes. “Do you have another one of those beers?” Seemingly out of nowhere, Bobby pulls out a beer and hands it to Sam, who then settles into a chair on the porch, like he has no other care in the world.
“What am I supposed to do?” Dean asks the rain, the same wild pain rising up in his throat. “What am I supposed to do now?”
The sweetness of the brownie turns to tar in his mouth. Dean forces it down and then reaches up into the cabinet. His fingers find an almost full bottle of whiskey, a prize from his and Cas’ last shopping trip (the one where he got caught up with the idea of simple routines with Cas, to the point that he completely slipped and called Cas his
Though Castiel’s dick stirs in vague interest, he’s honestly too tired to do anything more than think fondly on the offer. “Ah, well. More’s the pity.” He kisses Dean once more before setting the pizza down on the counter and going back to the bedroom to change.
When he reaches Baby’s side, he gives her a friendly pat on the roof, the shape comforting and familiar under his fingers. He slides into the driver’s seat, runs both hands down the steering wheel. For the first time since he got to Heaven, it feels like home.
“Well, daylight’s burning,” Dean says, maybe a little too loudly. “Come on, Cas. We’ve got to catch the shuttle back to the welcome cabin.”
Two years later, Dean looks across the room on a random hunt and sees Castiel Novak standing there, larger than life.
, claimed no responsibility in the press statement they released reiterating their commitment to the well-being of all guests.
Something warm and soft settles over his shoulders and it’s then that Castiel becomes aware of his body, down to his toes and fingers and the tip of his nose.
Dean’s hand drops down to Cas’ groin, cupping the hardness still pressing against the zipper of his pants. “I’ll take care of you, sweetheart.”
Dean’s face heats when the implication of his own words catches up to him.
“Strip for me.” Dean means to make the words sound commanding and seductive, but they come out as more of a desperate plea. Cas doesn’t seem to mind. He pulls his shirt off and slides out of his jeans in efficient movements. It still makes Dean’s blood rush to his groin to see this man, this beautiful man, bare before him.
Now, in less than forty-eight hours, it’s all come tumbling down.
Chuck thinks for a moment, theatrically tapping his chin with his index finger before he comes out with, “Yeah… No.” He chuckles. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, the white flag is always fun, and begging is a good look for you. But I go where the story takes me, and I’m really enjoying where this one is taking me right now.”
Dean nods solemnly. “Makes sense. Just make sure he treats you right.”
He’d hoped that Jo would have taken a little second to calm down, but her eyes are still squinty and judgmental. “The hell are you thinking?” she asks the second he steps foot into the kitchen. “You realize that you could lose your job over this, right?”
If she were a little drunker, Jess might accept. However, she’s just sober enough to know that it’s never a good idea to start poking into your own fate.
“You know what?” Dean says, looking thoughtful. “This might turn out to be a good thing.” Several incredulous pairs of eyes turn to him, but Dean barely seems to notice. “Any of you ever wonder why Azazel took so long to come here? I mean, Sam must’ve had that hex bag when he came back here from Chicago. Why didn’t Azazel show up the minute the wards got broken?”
Jess’ hand fell back to her side. She felt like she’d been slapped. She watched as Sam got up and purposefully insinuated himself into the conversation between Ellen and Pamela. Dean spared her a single, inscrutable look before he followed. And Jess… She was left to slink out of the house and end up here, standing on the porch and watching her breath puff out of her lips in short, white bursts.
“Always,” Cas says, almost managing to look smug. As they walk out through the door and squint into the afternoon sun, Dean pulls Cas even closer, just because he can.
“I didn’t ask for this,” Sam snaps. He curls his fingers protectively into his jacket, like he could clutch it close around himself and protect himself from every unkindness in the world.
When they get to the Roadhouse, Dean holds the door open for Sam and they trade a glance, checking in with each other. Sam looks unafraid and determined, and Dean gains another measure of respect for the person his little brother grew up to be.
He comes through the cabin noisily, causing Cas to drop the book and grab for his gun. It’s leveled at Dean for only a second before Cas lowers it, but Cas’ eyes don’t lose their wild gleam for a few more seconds.
“Focus, guys!” Pamela calls to them. “Pick one demon at a time and stick with it. You have to concentrate!”
He cuts himself off before he can say anything else, but Jess is like a bloodhound on the scent. “Saying that she’s your past implies that someone else is your future.”
strikes harder than it should. Vague flashbacks flicker through Dean's mind: the particular snarl on John’s face when he saw two guys walking down the street, their hands clasped palm to palm. He’d seemed to relish the word, like if he tried hard enough, he could stamp it into Dean’s skin. Hearing it now, from Castiel…  Dean flinches, absorbs the impact, and commits the rest of his life to hating Castiel Harvelle.
Castiel takes a deep breath. He’s talked about this decision with Dean, Sam, Eileen, and Charlie. Though the risks involved are undeniable, it’s also the only option.
Castiel ignores him. “Amara, think about Dean. Think about his brightness, his kindness. He doesn’t deserve to be trapped there. He deserves to be free, in a world that’s open and inviting towards him. He deserves to feel the sun on his face, to be able to live and laugh and love, to enjoy his life. You know that’s true. Please. Please help me save him.”
Taunting the demon might be a mistake, but Castiel wants to drag her attention away from Sam. He’s already tried everything he can think of to escape and come up empty. It’s possible that Sam might have better luck, and in that case, Meg’s attention needs to be focused off him.
To his surprise, he finds that a little bit of wetness has gathered at the corners of his eyes. He’s cried more in the past few days than in his entire existence up to that point; another side effect of his fading grace, most likely. His voice a little thick, he adds, “Sam is lucky to have you as well.”
Once Pamela has made herself scarce, Castiel redresses. His suit is his armor, and he adjusts it accordingly, tugging at the knot of his tie until he’s happy, and ignoring the small shiver as his knuckles brush against his mark. By the time he shrugs into his jacket, the uncertain submissive is gone. In his place is a warrior.
“I don’t get it, you know?” Dean says, trying to breathe around a sudden tightness in his chest. “Why bother at all? If I’m such a burden, why not let me rot? Seemed like you were pretty damn comfortable letting
Can you believe that schmuck? His son’s hands wrist deep in his innards, and all he can say is some pussy shit like that?” Meg licks her upper lip, slow and deliberate. “I’m hoping you’re going to be a bit more of a man about this.”
From there, Dean’s memories go a little fuzzy. He remembers the twist of pain in his chest, and the taste of copper, thick and salty on his tongue as he coughed up blood. He remembers seeing Dad’s face twisted in a cruel smirk, and, with a thrill of horror, he also remembers the sickly flash of yellow in his father’s eyes.
Amara inclines her head in acknowledgement. “Whoever’s grace opens up the rift, they’ll be the only one who can enter, so choose wisely. Also, the rift will close behind you, so before you enter, you need to be sure of what you’re doing.”
“I will.”
Cas chuckles quietly and wiggles even closer. There’s still another hour to go until Dean has to get up for work, which means he has time to grab just a little more sleep.
Castiel is proud. His voice never wavers as it rings clear through the apartment. Goosebumps rise on his arms and the back of his neck, but in the dim light, there’s no way Balthazar can see them. Everything about him, from the straightness of his spine to the set of his jaw, states his resolve.

Lily nods, satisfied. “And if you kill him, this all goes away, right? No more powers?”
Several things happen at once. The knife clatters to the floor, Jim launches himself at Max, Alice shrieks. Jess’ feet move, and then she’s next to Jim, pulling him back by his shirtsleeve. Utterly unprepared to be challenged, Jim doesn’t fight against her grip. A sharp pain lances through Jess’ hand and up her arm, and Jim crumples to the floor.
This is the man that he’s chosen to love.
At first, Dean sees Cas wherever he goes. The hint of dark hair, the flap of coattails in the breeze, a whisper of a gravelly voice. Cas is
“Sure.” Sam’s speaking in his courtroom voice, all polished angles and smooth lines. “I’ll just tell you what you’re apparently too far in denial to see. You want me to come up with some good pick-up lines while I’m at it, or do you want to do those yourself?”
He’s behind the wheel of his Baby, he’s in Heaven, and he’s going to find Cas. He’ll tell him all the things he never got to say down on Earth, before the Empty’s tendrils reached out and wrapped around Cas in an obscene embrace; their corrupted, oozing touch claiming the angel Dean had loved quietly, secretly, for well over a decade.
The entire article reads like nothing so much as an attempt for the resort to pass the blame onto any available target. There’s a token attempt at grief for the latest victim, but the reporter seems more caught up on the salacious details and describing the amenities of the resort. The whole thing is vaguely sickening. Dean rolls his eyes and goes diving into the coroner’s reports.
He twists his hands around the steering wheel, like he’s imagining strangling someone. “I fucked up. Someone… They asked me to do something, and I was too much of a chickenshit to do it. It was such a fucking simple thing, and it was all they wanted, and I couldn’t…”
Castiel’s expression shutters, leaving nothing but naked irritation behind. “Well then, what do you suggest we do?”
“Well,” Bobby says grimly, addressing the empty horizon. “He might not want a fight, but we’re sure as hell gonna give him one.”
Castiel snorts. “She’ll have to get in line behind all the demons.”
Zoe shifts back. She puts her whole body into rolling her eyes. “Jesus,” she mutters, addressing the ceiling, “good thing you’re pretty.” She seizes Dean’s jaw with a bruising grip, forcing him to meet her eyes. “I told you, it’s about the
Castiel hates everything about mornings. He hates the inevitability which clings to them. He loathes the slow creep away from bed into the cold embrace of the waking world. Mornings are too bright and too harsh to ever be considered remotely enjoyable. At least, that’s what he thought before he experienced the joy of mornings with Dean.
His fury hits Dean like a slap, causing him to stumble backwards a few steps. The walls of the motel actually shake, and a thin crack appears in the ceiling. Cas disappears for a second before he slams back into view, just like…
“What do you get the person who has everything?” Castiel comments, gently bumping Meg’s hand to navigate her away from Abbadon’s picture. The malicious glee in her eyes unsettles him. While he enjoys a bit of pain as much as the next submissive, he doesn’t think he’d enjoy the games that she plays.
Dean shakes his head, trying to dislodge his doubts as he slides behind the wheel. Once the rumble of the engine starts underneath him, he feels better about his decision. He’ll show up as himself, or not at all. His clients aren’t paying for him to be someone else. They pay him so that they can be taken out of their lives, and so they can hand over control to someone else.
Jess correctly reads the expression on his face. This time, it’s her who tosses down a few bills on the table. “I think we need to find Andy Gallagher again,” she says grimly.
Castiel pushes down on the gas and the Continental grumbles as it surges forward in an attempt to leave his thoughts behind.
Castiel sighs as he looks at the ever-increasing size of the papers on his desk. He hasn’t managed to get through a fraction of the work which he needed to, and yet more keeps coming. They’re petty things: charity proposals, reports which need his approval, budget statements which he needs to verify, but he can’t wrap his head around them. Castiel suspects that Hannah has been keeping the more complex projects and decisions off of his desk for the past week. While he understands the decision (he doesn’t particularly feel up to dealing with matters of import at the moment), he still resents that it has to be made at all.
Before he left for Lawrence with Dean, he’d felt like maybe he and Jess were working their way up to something, but the kiss still caught him off guard. Of course, he knows better than to think one kiss is going to magically solve every issue between them.
this.
Afterward, he and Cas lay together, their pinkies linked together. Their chests rise and fall as they catch their breath. For his part, Dean can’t stop looking at Cas: his dark eyelashes against his flushed cheek, the small mole next to his right nipple, the curl of his hair just above his ear. He’s a marvel, every bit of him: not because of his powers but because he’s so blessedly human.
Castiel swallows, hard. “Dean must have been devastated.”
!” The voice rings through every fiber of Jess’ being, in the same way Ansem’s did, but… not. The power behind this voice is still a violation of her will, but not with the intent to harm. Jess lets out the breath she didn’t realize she was holding, fingers relaxing their hold on her weapon. “
“Hey, you’re okay,” Jess soothes. Sam keeps watch while she goes to free Becky. She cuts at the ropes around Becky’s wrist and makes sure to knick her with the edge of the silver knife. Other than a small flinch, Becky doesn’t react.
The first touch of their lips is electrifying, like Cas has used a jolt of his power, but he hasn’t. It’s just them, just their own, intensely human connection. Cas’ lips are chapped, and the rough patches catch against Dean’s skin until he sweeps his tongue over them to smooth them out. Cas’ mouth opens and Dean accepts the invitation.
If there’s anything he’s learned, it’s that Cas will
But they have time. They have all the time they need.
Cas doesn’t answer, and Dean pushes harder. “You think that I’m jealous? You think I’m that petty?” Cas’ eyebrows rise slightly, which is enough of an answer. “You know, what, fuck you, Cas,” Dean breathes. “You’re the one who left, you’re the one who
He was always better with Cas. And that’s what hurts the most, is that Cas somehow realized that Dean was useless and left him, knowing that he would be fine and Dean would be a wrecked, hopeless mess.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Jess says. She clenches her fists and her fingernails dig into her skin.
He steps onto the porch, loose board creaking under his feet.
again!” a voice snarls, ancient as mountains and high-pitched with madness.
So instead of getting up, Castiel lies back and tries to recapture the memory of his dream. Sexual dreams are a rare occurrence for him, and he wonders what prompted this one. He’s noticed a few times that smoking pot helps keep his nightmares at bay, but he’s never known it to have a positive effect on his libido before.
Off Dean’s silence, the sheriff nods, like Dean just confirmed something for him. Then he starts flipping through the journal, past drawings of vampires, werewolves and rugarus, past newspaper clippings and messy pen scrawl. “I thought that might be your name,” the sheriff says, perching on the table next to Dean. “See, I leafed through this. What little I could make out— I mean, it’s nine kinds of crazy. But I found this too.”
He finds it in the form of a slender woman who hangs to the edge of the streetlights. She does a decent job playing demure, but Dean can still sense something predatory in her stance and the way she eyes potential johns up and down. He catches her before she can make another kill, slides the knife into her heart, and sees the light leave her eyes. He places her body on the ground as gently as he can, then he hightails it out of there, just in case someone happened to see him.
Brightness explodes across his field of vision. Dean instinctively ducks before he realizes that he’s not under attack. Dazed, he looks through the cage of his arms at the harsh fluorescent lights bursting into life above him. Rows upon rows of lights flicker on, revealing a warehouse with walls so pristinely white that they’re blinding.
“Yes.” Amara picks up her knife and uses it to push aside the fish’s crisp skin, slicing into the tender white meat beneath. “I’ve started work on it, but it isn’t perfect yet. I can’t seem to get the taste of the fish just right. So I came back for…” She pierces a small bite of fish with her fork and brings it to her mouth, humming contentedly as the fresh, savory taste bursts across her tongue. “Research,” she concludes.
“Oh.” Cas shakes his head. “Not in a long time. My little brother used to love—” He breaks off, clamping his jaw shut with an audible
Jess’ expression cracks open, mirroring a desperate mix of hope, love and sadness back at him. “I love you too, Sam. So much.”
That startles a brittle laugh out of Dean. It splinters when it hits the cold air. Both Dean and Cas wince. “Talk about it?” The novelty of the situation is astounding to him. “Since when do we do that?”
It’s a solid lead, so Dean’s next stop is the library. That’s where he hits his first dead end. The database doesn’t have anything to say about a woman’s murder on Centennial, no matter how far back he goes. He feels like there’s something he’s missing, or should be thinking of, but he hasn’t been sleeping well since Dad missed their check-in a few days ago, and his phone is heavy in his pocket. Sam stopped calling hours ago.
Dean mumbles his own goodbyes, taken aback by the swift change in her behavior. He doesn’t think that much of it, however: a lot of servers get a little flirty when they’re angling for bigger tips. By the time he makes it back to the cabin, he’s only thinking of how he’s going to manage to make it through a whole day. Between the heat already starting to bake the ground, and the pressure of working with Cas, he’s in for a trying day.
Hunters are used to being woken in the early hours of the morning, but they all handle it differently. After hearing the news about Cas, Ellen is quiet and defeated, and Dean finds it hard to look at her. Jo is the opposite: full of nervous energy, she paces around the farmhouse kitchen, weaving a butterfly knife through her fingers.
Cas swallows. “You know as well as I do that confessions made under duress are notoriously unreliable.”
“He deserves more,” Castiel finds himself saying. “He deserves…” He manages to stop before he embarrasses himself further, but the damage has already been done.
Cas takes it, groaning when Dean tangles his fingers in his hair. “Fuck, Cas, your
The door opens, and Jess looks to see who it is. Her heart swoops happily when Sam walks into the Roadhouse. Sawdust covers his shirt and jeans, and his skin has a healthy tan from being outside most of the spring and summer. His long hair flops into his eyes as he sets down the chair he was carrying. A smile spreads across his face when he sees Jess.
Keys clack in the background with what sounds like extreme prejudice. “I’m trying to figure it out. Give me the day.”
“No, go for it.” Dean spreads his hands in surrender. “I won’t stop you. You can get in your car and drive into the sunset.”
Castiel looks back at Sam and Jess, only to see them disappearing in the direction of the annex. Their steps are in tandem, and while they don’t touch, their hands are close enough that it almost doesn’t matter. Castiel watches them for a few more seconds and then, feeling like he’s intruding, drops his eyes and turns to Dean instead.
. “Yeah, but you look like a little bit of trouble yourself…” He lets the sentence hang in the air.
“They’re right, you know?” Pamela says, nudging Sam’s shoulder. “You’ve got some catching up to do, but there’s no shame in that.”
But before he can finish his sentence, Dean is gone, yet another door closing behind him.
Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel sees Max nod. He can’t catch anything of what Max says, only that Missouri seems pleased by it. “Good, honey. I can’t say for sure, but I think you’re making the right decision.” Missouri lays a soft hand on Max’s cheek, and he leans into it like he’s starved. “If you ever need anything, you just call me, alright?”
Dean bites back a groan, this one of irritation. The memory of Castiel’s smug face when he mocked Dean's lack of provisions swims through his mind. If he dies from this, it'll prove Castiel right, so Dean is
Dean doesn’t take it as a joke.
Cas shifts again as Dean’s finger brushes across his back, but the reach is getting to be a little awkward, so Dean shuffles closer, slinging an arm around Cas’ middle. The sheets are rucked up almost all the way under Cas’ arms, and Dean pushes at them gently, sliding them down Cas’ back inch by inch, following the trail of newly revealed skin with his fingertip. A small shudder runs through Cas, and that’s when Dean knows he’s got his attention.
you?” Meg punctuates the repetition of her question with a quick kick to Castiel’s midsection. His instinct is to curl up and protect his vulnerable organs, but his position tied to the pole prevents that. All he can do is sag pathetically in his bonds and groan.
It’s a moment of perfection, snatched from the jaws of the world and already doomed to expire. Sam feels dirty even touching the picture. Part of him wants to give this to Ellen, and part of him wants to pretend like he never saw it. He settles for tucking the photo into the glovebox, but he can feel it sitting there, judging him. Before he can reconsider what he wants to do with it, Jess opens the passenger door and tosses her bag into the backseat. With that, they’re ready to go, and Sam eases the truck onto the road.
Until his fingers grip the hand, he’s not sure that it’s real, but that’s solid flesh and bone underneath his palm. Dean pulls, feeling resistance on the other end. “No,” he grunts, reaching into the rift. His hand touches skin, and his resolve grows. He didn’t come this far only to lose. They haven’t come this far only to fall apart.
Dean can’t wait to see it.
Numbers are where Dean finds his comfort. Words are Cas’ forte. Last night, Cas attempted to give him words, and Dean ignored him. There’s really no one to blame here but himself.
The question feels like the sharp glint of light on an unsheathed blade. Dean’s hand is reaching for his gun before he can stop himself. “Enough. Why do you care so much about Steven, huh? What kind of…” He gathers himself and glares at Gael. “I know what you are.”
Sam’s voice rings out, strong and emphatic.
“How is he?” Dean’s voice sounds weaker than Castiel would like.
Jess laughs as she unearths a bong that’s at least half as tall as her. “Is it just me, or does this guy seem like he would know how to party?”
The twinkle grows, throwing sparks that seem to light up Castiel’s entire face, even though he isn’t smiling at all. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
“This is just your way of getting me into a yoga class,” Dean gripes as they walk down the trail. “Three friggin’ years you’ve been trying…”
, but he stops himself just in time.
For now, he wants
“Dean?”
“It’s vitally important to keep this as secret as possible.” Novak runs his fingers through his hair. “It took everything we had to get this far with witnesses, evidence, jurors, appeals and delays. If word gets out that this,” Novak waves his hand towards the photos with an expression of disdain, “is happening, Roman’s lawyers will move for a mistrial. If that happens...I don’t think I can get everything lined up again.” His face sets with determination. “This case needs to go to trial. It has to.”
When everyone is in place, Ellen calls, “Alright, Ash. Get it going.”
The significance of those words doesn’t hit him until they’re both stumbling towards the door, each of them propping the other upright.
Cas’ eyes are wild, his lips slick and swollen. His hair sticks out at strange angles, reminiscent of that night so long ago when they first met. Cas still has some of the same angelic wrath lurking in his body, as he glares down at Dean.
Castiel had asked, a bone-deep weariness in his voice.
Thinking that he’s been ditched like an unwanted prom date is bad enough, but then Dean thinks about what Dad would say if he found out that Sam has demon blood in him. Worse, that they’re working with other hunters in an attempt to use said demon’s blood to battle demons with psychic powers, given to Sam (once again, ta-da!) by demon’s blood. Dean honestly doesn’t know whether Dad would commit them to a mental institution or just shoot them outright. Either way, this latest idea would go over like a lead balloon.
Confused, Sam was silent for just a beat too long before he took Brady’s hand and shook it. “Sam. Sam Winchester.” Trying to find the trap behind the friendliness, he added, “Did you need something?”
Pamela half-turns, but doesn’t straighten up right away, her assets still very much on display. “Hey yourself.”
“You know those aren’t going to do anything to hold me. Once Wonderboy runs out of juice, I’ll be able to walk out of here, except I’ll be in a really shitty mood at that point.”
“We’re fine,” he says, wishing it were true even though he knows it’s better for Cas if they’re not.
“I’ve made it my business to know about Azazel,” Castiel says coolly, turning back to his food.
He flips through the books. They don’t seem to have a table of contents, and they certainly don’t have an index. It looks like he’s going to have to look over every single page of these. Of course, they’re both bricks, and weigh as much as one.
Castiel freezes and fights back his instinctive panic. Traditionally, nothing good has ever begun with a version of the words
She stands up and walks out of Dean’s room, where they had been congregating. When they first arrived last night, Dean wanted his own space and so did Castiel, which left Sam and Jess. With the reasoning that it would be a waste of funds for them to get separate rooms, Jess pulled some cash from her bag and got them a room with two twin beds. Sam tried his best not to feel emasculated.
“Yeah?” Dean looks pleased, but there’s still some doubt in his eyes. “You sure? With Ellen and Jo…”
About seven miles out from Jericho, he runs straight into a police blockade. The road he’s on leads across a river valley on an overpass, sun-dappled mountains providing a dramatic backdrop. But off to the left, a smaller highway crosses the riverbed by means of a truss bridge. The bridge’s steel superstructure looks rusty and worn, like it’s seen a few decades of wind, rain and sun exposure. Access to the bridge is cut off by several sheriff’s department vehicles, and there’s a couple of deputies milling around, checking out the scene.
Cas shakes his head wearily. “No, Sam. You couldn’t have known. I’m not angry.” His eyes find Dean’s, and there’s something a little hesitant in them. “What about you though? I was worried that…” He swallows hard and takes another small sip of water, wincing as he lowers his arm. “I should have told you about the vision as soon as I found out. I know that.”
Cas pushes past Dean, his face set and implacable. Cold rage shines from his eyes, and his hair waves in the impossible breeze. “Mr. Winchester,” he says, voice cold and commanding, “Dean’s made his wishes perfectly clear. I think it’s time you left.”
Love you. You’re so beautiful.” Sweat beads at the tips of Cas’ hair, and when Dean kisses him, he tastes salt.
“I’m aware,” Cas says, voice dryer than the Sahara.
Like the rest of them, Jack took his time figuring out what to do with his life. But after a few months, armed with a fake high school diploma made at Kinko’s, he decided to enroll in classes at the local community college. It was a good thing Charlie’s fake credit cards were still working just fine, because Jack wanted to learn a little bit of everything — photography, video game design, creative writing and a half-dozen other things that Dean quickly lost track of.
“Let’s get out of here,” Jess says, and they start retracing their steps through the sewer. It takes ten minutes to get back to the manhole, and Sam draws in big, grateful gulps of clean air as soon as he gets to the top.
“Let me go on huntcation, then I’ll stop by good old Lebanon. I’ve gotta get myself all pretty for you. I’ve gotta find some way to compete with your hair, right?”
Tenderness so bright that it hurts washes through Dean. Even though Jo snarls and pushes at him, it doesn’t stop him from wrapping his around her and lifting her off the ground in a bearhug. “Put me down you asshole,” she hisses, pinching mercilessly at his neck and arms until he puts her back on the ground. “It’s only because I think you’ll be a bit more fun if you get laid a little more,” she says, crossing her arms across her chest, defying him to say anything else.
The demon snarls, but she loosens her grip, which is what Castiel wanted. He reels back, and makes for freedom yet again.
That’s not what their father thought, but the man has been dead and in the ground for five years. It’s probably about time that Dean stopped treating his word as gospel.
Not going to lie, this felt a little rushed, but after careful consideration, I decided to keep it. Y'all deserve some happiness and I'm tired of torturing these two babies.
Thing is, Dean doesn’t doubt it, from the way that Cas is looking at him, but he hasn’t made it this far in life by being timid, and he’s not going to start now.
Dean flushes as he thinks about it--picking up dinner after his shift and heading over to Cas’ place for dinner. Putting Cas’ feet in his lap and feeding each other little tidbits from dinner. Being able to undress Cas and take him apart at his leisure and afterward, be able to relax in bed with him. Be able to wrap his arms around his form and sleep and not have to worry about scampering out of bed to avoid Jo’s suspicion…
How can Cas be this stupid? How can Cas, after everything that Dean’s done for him, do this?
A frisson of fear shudders through Sam. He remembers the last time they had any contact with Dad: how Dean was lured someplace and found only a monster waiting for him. And now, inadvertently, Sam’s given Dad their exact location.
Jess shrugs. “It’s not like I’ve got anything better to do.”
Later, Dean can’t quite remember how they made it back to the cabin. Neither he nor Cas were in the best of shape: Dean’s feet kept forgetting they were attached to the end of his legs and stumbled over the smallest twigs or nothing at all, while Cas’ breathing had the particular hitch of a cracked or bruised rib. Somehow, the two of them made it back to the cabin without any help, powered by sheer stubbornness.
“Tell me about it, man. D’you ever marry Eileen? Have kids?”
. It’s almost like his body is trying to make up for everything it missed when he was younger. Even when it takes him a while to slip under, or when he wakes in the middle of the night, panting and sweating from a half-remembered nightmare, he’s got Cas to curl up against. Sure, Cas snores a little, and he tends to toss and turn, because he gets nightmares too. But even with all that, sharing a bed with Cas is the best sleep Dean’s ever gotten.
Dean’s heart performs an odd series of loops as Cas steps into view. His hands are steady as he points his gun at the demon. “Back off.” His voice wobbles in the middle of the command, but the intent is clear.
His voice is heavy with implication, which frankly, Dean could do without. He almost snaps at Sam to keep his giant forehead out of his business, but instead, he forces down his worry and picks at the bacon crowding his plate. He forces himself to eat a piece and it slides down his throat, leaving a lingering trail of heavy grease in the back of his mouth.
“Come on,” Dean whispers, his voice a little too rough for the moment, but it’s not like he can help himself. “Take a load off.”
A hand lands on Castiel’s shoulder, and he barely stops himself from crying out.
Sure enough, a growl emerges from deep in Cas’ throat, muffled as he buries his face in his pillow. It sounds vaguely like he’s trying to say words.
Sam winces at the choice of words, but passes Ava his only remaining flashlight. He regrets now that he didn’t double back to retrieve the one Jess lost down there earlier. Maybe if he’d looked around, read the clues of the confrontation, he could’ve gotten the shifter to reveal themselves sooner, or even kept Jess from getting captured in the first place.
None of their shenanigans go unnoticed by Sam. He groans and rolls his eyes, but there’s still affection in his voice when he says, “Can’t you two wait until I’m at least out of the car before you start being gross?”
She gets up from the table, not quite as quickly as Jo, but quicker than politeness would demand, and walks towards the door. The back of her neck burns with the weight of everyone’s eyes on it, but she doesn’t care. All she can focus on is the pang of loss when she thinks about Sam’s laugh, and the fact that she wasn’t responsible for it.
“Yeah, well, maybe Gael didn’t want to chow down on his star student.”
This time when Dean kisses Cas, it’s soft and almost sweet. Cas hums into his mouth and if they were anyone else in any other circumstance, Dean would swear that Cas’ lips curve in a smile against his.
Before Castiel can reply — maybe he would confess that he spent a year and a half at the local community college, but he never felt like he had a right to be there while there were demons left to hunt — Jess interrupts their conversation. “I think we all know who won this one,” she crows. “Pay up, gentlemen.”
“Good thinking,” Bobby says, nodding his approval.
“Ah. Hi.” Dean remembers Castiel and Jess talking about Andy this morning, but he’d been a little more interested in the sliver of skin revealed by Pamela’s low-rider jeans and hadn’t paid that much attention.
? Like a monster A-bomb?”
“I heard that,” Ava snarls, and Andy turns to her, looking embarrassed but covering it with annoyance.
“Cas, what the hell?” He can’t help but give way to the hurt blossoming in him the only way he knows how, with irritation and anger and the idea of
Pamela puts up both hands, palms out. “Alright, kiddos, before this escalates to playground levels of childishness, why don’t we give Sam’s brain a break and let Max have a go?”
For a moment, Jess considers it. Aggie would be as good as her word: she would sweep into Jess’ small apartment and somehow make it glamorous just by the fact of her presence. With Aggie’s help, Jess has no doubt the hunt would be managed and completed in a few hours’ time, and then they could both go back to Denver. She could rest at home and not have to deal with a stranger who seems to hate them even as he’s trying to save their lives, and a boyfriend who's turned into a virtual stranger overnight.
“You’re not going to hurt any of these people,” Jack says.
“‘s that coffee?” Cas mumbles, rubbing at his eyes.
? What the hell, Cas?”
If Azazel’s threats are to be believed, then in about twenty-four hours, none of them will be safe anywhere, but Jess wants to cling to whatever illusions keep her world turning.
“You know Sammy.” Dean finishes off his drink and pours another as he forces a lightness he doesn't feel into his voice. “He’s off at Stanford, living the college dream. Getting all that California sunshine, far away from the ghoulies and beasties.”
other signs of life by now.
Cas is hot on his heels as he walks into their room, but he stays a careful distance away. He’s just close enough that Dean can catch the teasing hint of sweat and smoke on his skin, but just far enough away that Dean can’t follow through on the tease.
Dean’s so startled by the whole encounter that it takes him a few seconds to move. By the time he gets up from the table and goes to the stacks, the man is long gone. Dean searches through the shelves, but finds no one.
“You’re a menace,” Cas tells him, just before he settles across from Dean on the carpet. Dean hums, ducking his head to hide his smile. “No, I mean it,” Cas insists, though there’s no heat in his voice. “You’re a bad influence.”
Castiel forces himself to take deep breaths, in and out, again and again until his heart rate finally slows. If this is how he reacts to seeing the name of his old hometown on a sign by the roadside, what would it be like to have to go back inside his family’s house? To see the kitchen floor where his parents bled out?
After a moment’s heavy silence, Sam nods jerkily. “Sure. I have some things I’d like to get out in the open.”
“Hey,” he says, leaning forward for a quick kiss. “I was actually looking for you. Ash and Andy are getting ready to leave, and they wanted to say goodbye to everyone.”
At Sam’s statement, flat and certain, Dean swivels around. “What?”
Dean seems to consider the question for a moment. “Maybe next time. Maybe never. I honestly can’t say, and you know what? I’m okay with that.”
this slender connection to become stronger. He holds his tongue, even though he’s almost desperate to hear what comes next.
“Well, I don’t have hiking poles or whatever else you packed.”
Cas’ expression changes from doubtful to comically horrified. “Dance.” His eyebrows raise to truly dizzying heights as he looks at Dean. “You’re suggesting that I dance.”
, he thinks, putting force behind his voice, sending his words rocketing into the dimensions.
“Dean.”
the two most important people in his life to get along, and it would seem that hunting is the one thing they have in common.
It means a trip to the local library, where he prays the librarians aren’t nosy. He also prays that the library caters to those with eclectic tastes;  what he’s looking for strays pretty far outside the norm of most library canons.
“Except there’s another way,” Pamela says, “and my friend found it.” She takes a deep breath, as if to steel herself. Her usual swagger seems to drain out of her, and it’s oddly unsettling. “Her idea was that if she had some demonic power in her, she could turn that against other demons and use it to burn them out of their vessels. So she got her hands on a demon’s blood, and she…” Pamela breaks off, swallowing heavily before she continues. “She drank it.”
The blessedly cool hilt of his silver knife slides into his hand. Rejuvenated, Sam grips it and brings his arm up in a wild slice. Jess — the shifter — screams, and reels back, clutching their bleeding arm. Smoke curls from the edges of the wound, and their eyes are wild when they bare their teeth at Sam.
“You know, when I found out about… about you being a hunter—”
The rest of Dean’s visit passes without remark. He catches up with Bobby, spends a few days making repairs on the Impala, sleeps in a musty bed that’s still better than standard motel fare, and gets to witness the oddly endearing yet still horrifying sight of Bobby flirting with the local sheriff. He leaves Bobby’s place feeling more well-rested than he did when he arrived, which is really all he can ask of life.
Dean has no idea what drove her to that conclusion, but now that she’s said it, he’s trapped. What is he supposed to say? That he would rather swallow live scorpions than face a situation where he’s going to be intimately close to Cas for a long period of time? A weird hug in the privacy of their own cabin is one thing, but long, prolonged periods of contact in public are an entirely different can of worms.
The word
“Probably an improvement on his temperament.” Bobby taps his fingers on the counter. “Anyway, the point I’m trying to make is that being raised like that, with a Dad who cared more about how many times you could hit the target with a shotgun than what you brought home on your report cards… It damages you.”
He staggers off toward the far end of the alley, and Castiel calls after him. “Where are you going?”
Dean returns to the couch, carrying two bottles. The one he sets down on his coaster while the other he offers wordlessly to Castiel, touching his shoulder with the cool, damp glass of the bottle. Castiel nods and Dean pops the cap off, before returning the bottle to him.
With a triumphant leer, Azazel disappears and rejoins the crowd of psychics across the field. Jess is frozen with horror as Sam’s eyes go blank.
Footsteps echo through the entry hall. There’s a disturbance in the air, like a storm moving in. Dean keeps his face carefully composed, but all of his senses are on high alert, his nerves tingling. The fine hairs on his arms rise.
“Hey,” Sam says softly. “Don’t beat yourself up. Even two of us wouldn’t have stood much chance against a whole town of pagan worshippers.”
“We’ll find the demon,” Sam says, with a little more conviction than he feels. “We’ll find Azazel, and then we’ll stop it. The visions, the psychic powers… We’ll stop everything.”
“Deal,” he says.
Jess blinks at Jo’s version of sweet-talking, but it seems to work on Ava. She takes Jo’s outstretched hand, and, with a slightly rueful glance towards Jess, leaves the kitchen. Her coffee sits on the counter, untouched.
Ellen frowns, tapping her forehead in thought. “Yeah, I think I know who you mean. Elkins, his last name was.”
“Aww.” Dean plants a kiss on Cas’ cheek and grins obnoxiously. “You love me.”
Castiel ignores them all and raises his hand in a short wave. His smile is forced, but no one seems to notice. A bead of sweat works its way down his spine to pool at the small of his back. His suit coat hangs on him like a coffin, while his tie feels like a noose. What he wouldn’t give to just show up at one of these events in his regular clothes, but he was told, in no uncertain terms, by Balthazar that would be unacceptable.
Dean opens his mouth a couple of times, trying to think of an objection. Eventually, he just asks what, to him, is the obvious question. “Why would you want to do that?”
“It’s not something you make better,” Cas finally says. He looks at Dean and his eyes are empty. “It just
So he does.
Dean rolls over in bed and stares at the blank wall.
into our house?”
Dean wakes up at some point. His situation is not improved by this.
“Hi,” scruffy dude says, offering Dean a lazy, two-fingered salute. “Andy Gallagher. Cas and Jess found me.”
“The Castiel doth protest too much, methinks,” and Castiel is going to
to make sure he doesn’t suspect anything. We just want to talk to him for now, and we have to keep him from using his powers on us at all costs, alright? You remember the cover story?”
“Aw, sweetie. Castiel isn’t coming. You made sure of that.”
a good day. He doesn’t want to see Cas’ serene expression slip into irritability.
Castiel barely notices his eyelids getting heavy as he stares at the building. It’s nice enough — historic, and vaguely Spanish colonial in appearance, with a white-washed exterior, cast-iron balconies and dark wooden shutters. The concrete path that leads to the arched entryway is sheltered by a large palm tree on one side. Its fronds sway gently in the mild fall breeze. Slowly, Castiel’s chin dips, vision blurring, a dark heaviness overtaking him.

Cas — because it’s Cas possessing him, it’s Cas moving his body, it’s Cas inside of him, taking away any chance of free will or action, it’s Cas who’s a ghost and
“Unclench, Sammy.” Dean grins easily as he takes a swig of his beer.
He slaps down a small cardboard box in front of Dean. Dean looks at the box, then at Cas, and back at the box. “Cas, you nerd.” He shakes the box gingerly and listens to the separate pieces rattle. “You did puzzles?”
“And Dad, he was…” Dean swallows and it’s only then that he realizes that he’s been pouring out his life story to Cas. And that Cas hasn’t interrupted, or given him the cold shoulder or worse, the pitying looks that so many give him when they figure out just the kind of hell that his childhood was.
A loud, discordant buzzing travels through the air, pushing against Dean’s ear drums. A line of static runs down the side of the nearest mountain. Heart beating hard against his ribs, Dean turns to find the Roadhouse. Bobby is still on the porch, but he’s fuzzy, distorted. A spark kindles in Dean’s chest — a last, desperate hope finding its home inside him.
people when they needed help.”
There’s something else lurking underneath Dean’s words. Castiel can’t quite put his finger on what it is, but he knows that it’s something too deep and yet too close to the surface for either of them to name.
Cas gives him a familiar scathing look. “You don’t have to sound so surprised. I’m not hopeless.” Despite his assurances, there’s a defensive tone in his voice. Dean hides his hurt behind a smile; some things never change.
come from?”
A faint golden glimmer, a thread of hope so slender that if he thinks about it too long then he’ll shatter. It twists and turns in front of him, so far in the distance as to almost be a mirage.
When Jess looks up again, Cas’ eyes are still fixed on the disco ball, tracking the hypnotic back-and-forth swing of it.
But if they thought that salting and burning the body would solve the issue, they were wrong. The ghostly echo of the truck made an appearance right as Cyrus was going up in flames. Dean jumped into the Impala and led the truck on a crazy chase across the backroads outside of town while Jess was on the phone, frantically trying to figure out what else to do to stop the haunting.
Bobby (Lieutenant Singer when any of the brass are around) walks into the bullpen, holding a wilting manilla folder in his hands. His eyes dart around the bullpen, no doubt looking for victims. He lands on the only occupants of the room: Dean, whose pen moves much faster when he has an audience, Jo, who doesn’t bother to look up from organizing witness statements in her latest robbery case, and Benny, whose hunt-and-peck style of typing is painfully audible in the quiet room.
It’s a stroke of strange luck that Jess has no time to worry about being filthy. Sam whips the truck through the narrow city streets, taking such quick hairpin turns that Jess is slammed into the passenger door. From the backseat, the newcomer, Ava, makes a low noise of complaint, but doesn’t voice any additional discomfort.
Cas shakes his head and steps away, leaving Dean with nothing but a handful of torn hopes.
“I’ll text you coordinates to the safe house in a few minutes. If you come, you come. If you don’t, don’t expect any help from me in the future.”
He’s so caught in his own head that he almost misses it: a turnoff, the first one he’s seen since he got here.
Jess’ eyes flash to his. “Could be nothing,” she says, though it doesn’t sound like she means it.
He watches as Jess’ eyes widen, taking in something just to Sam’s left and behind his tree, out of his field of vision.
“It’s not poisoned, is it?” She’s only partially joking.
“Cas, it’s okay, it’s going to be okay, you’re okay…” Dean pushes aside the dozens of worries now crowding for control in his brain and moves forward. His arms are already opening, ready to envelop Cas in a crushing hug, ready to hold him until he stops shaking, ready to bury his nose in Cas’ hair—
A battle plays out on Cas’ face, short but fierce. Eventually, the fire in his eyes flickers and goes out, and he nods in tired defeat. “Alright.”
“Well, one thing I've learned is that it’s never too late," she says. "Maybe now that she’s called you, she’ll be a little more open to the idea of the supernatural and you guys can work things out.”
Dean grins, and Castiel barely suppresses a small lurch in his chest at how that simple expression transforms Dean’s face, turning it sunny and charming. “Nope. Follow me.”
“Years.” Dean directs his words towards Castiel’s knuckles. If he has to face Cas, then he’ll lose every bit of his newfound courage. “I’ve spent years wanting you and years hating myself for not telling you. Seeing you with April… Knowing that both of us could have died, and you never would have known… That was the final straw.”
, it’s so good and he never wants this to stop.
Even flipping through the pages one-handed, Dean can tell that a lot of the sketches are of him: at Baby’s wheel, relaxed and smiling. On the porch of the farmhouse, shoulders hunched and eyes staring off into the distance. A close-up of his face, so detailed and vulnerable that it hurts to look at. Heart seizing in his chest, Dean steps away.
With another disgruntled huff, Bobby leaves, and Dean spends a long time staring at the rest of the six-pack sitting on his bedside table. In the end, he grabs it and puts it in the annex fridge.
This time, Sam sees it. Just when Zach turns around and looks at the camera, there’s a strange flash of light. He rewinds the video and looks again. This time, he can tell that it’s coming from his eyes. “What the hell?” he asks, pausing just at the flash. “Laser eyes?”
Ava, honey, I’m not saying you've got anything, but if anyone's mouth is going on anyone’s genitals—”
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Dean ignores the twist in his belly at the words
He ducks around the back of the diner, where the dumpsters and grease traps are hidden from the guests. The smells rise up, pungent in the late afternoon heat, and Dean wrinkles his nose in distaste. Still, it’s not the grossest thing he’s ever done for a hunt, so he tries to breathe through his mouth as he creeps closer.
There’s a pillow crease on Cas’ cheek, and his hair is a disaster, but his eyes are suddenly bright with interest. They both have so much on their plate that they almost never have time for anal. When they do, they switch it up based on what they’re in the mood for, but Dean is well aware that Cas will absolutely never say no to being on top if the opportunity is presented to him.
Sam twists under the pretense of wrapping his arm around her shoulders. “Like a hawk,” he murmurs back.
Dean looks positively murderous. Sam cringes to think about what comes next. “I kept it to myself, but the demon who was possessing my friend told me they weren’t dreams at all; they were visions. He said I get them because I’m one of what he called the 'special children', which are apparently connected to the demon that killed Mom.”
It takes Sam and Jess long enough to arrive that Dean seriously considers the protein bar a couple of times.
is what he doesn’t say to Sam, because it’s not conducive to a good team spirit.
It might be rude, but Dean shoves past the rest of the exiting guests in his excitement. By the time Cas steps off the bus, Dean’s already running his hand over the frame of the Impala, crooning in delight.
Cas studies him, amused, from where he’s leaning back against a wall of pillows. “You’re allowed to come closer. I won’t bite. Not unless you ask me to, anyway,” he says, and it’s such a relief to see the twinkle in his gorgeous blue eyes that Dean goes a little weak in the knees. That’s as good an excuse as any to sit down on the nearest available surface, which just so happens to be Cas’ bed.
Castiel’s breath is loud and harsh. The sound fills the Impala's interior until Dean feels like he’s suffocating. He instinctively rejects what Castiel said, yet it feels like an inescapable truth. His stomach roils, and for one horrifying moment, Dean thinks he’s going to be sick.
He storms forward, ignoring the hushed whispers and wide eyes following him. The knob to Uriel’s office twists under his hand, and the door bursts open with such violence that it bounces off the wall. Castiel catches it with an open hand, glaring vitriol at the two occupants of the office.
He should have seen it coming, of course. The first time he went to the Empty, the Shadow had ample time to peruse his mind; to study all his weaknesses and devise the best way to use them against him.
Fucking figures that Cas speaks Latin.
Jess catches Cas’ eye. Cas gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Jess zeroes in on Max, smiling apologetically. “We’re not. We’re sorry, Max. We didn’t mean to lie to you. We just needed a way to get in here so we could talk to you about your powers. If you’re willing to listen, we can explain where they came from. We’ll even take you with us to a place where you’ll get to meet those other people Cas mentioned.” Jess steps forward until she’s next to Cas, heart jackhammering in her chest. “But you have to trust us, Max. And you have to put the knife down.”
Dean worries at his bottom lip with his teeth. This is stupid, right? He shouldn’t go on another hunt. He should stay here. He should tell Cassie to leave him alone.
Dean blinks. His not-so-carefully rehearsed script vanishes as though it never existed, and he wants nothing more than to escape. The hostess’ smile never falters. She acts as though Dean hasn’t done anything strange by staring blank-faced at her for the last thirty seconds.
“Don’t fucking Dumbledore me,” Dean mutters. He rubs at his temples. Somehow, even lucid dreaming has lost its appeal. Talking to Cas isn’t appealing when he knows that he’s just talking to his own subconscious.
Neither Cas nor Dean mentions what they’re no doubt both thinking: it’s been less than a week since the last death, but all creatures have to eat eventually. The longer they take finding the monster, the greater likelihood there is that someone else will die.
She unties his wrists, and Castiel curls automatically into a ball. Far away, he hears Meg cursing, at him, at herself, at Dean, and at the world in general. Sharp-tipped fingers tug through his hair, using the pain to ground him.
Dean stares at Cas’ face, looking for any hint of hesitation or a lie. Zoe’s words drift through his head:
