“How do you know this?” Sherlock chuckled darkly, wincing as he rose above the deck of the boat, spinning around and humming a soft note. John’s body tingled as the energy around the Siren shifted. John’s eyes widened as the scales that covered his black tail quivered, filling the air with the sound of a quiet snicking as they slid against one another, revealing a horrific burn along the length of his tail.
“Hey Love. What’s wrong?” He pushed himself up on his elbows and rubbed at his eyes, a yawn pulling itself from his chest.
“Well, Sherlock. Welcome to our castle. My name is Mycroft, I am the head of the household. That is Greg, my husband and leader of the staff. What brings you here?”
“My name is Moriarty. Sherlock sent me. Said you were the one that scratched him up.” John couldn’t contain the growl that escaped his chest. Sherlock wouldn’t say that. He wouldn’t lie about that.
"Have you told John how scared you are?" Sherlock nodded, digging his nails into his palms. "You don't have to do anything you don't want to, Sherlock."
“If I’ve guessed our location correctly, I’d say about eight days.” Sherlock nodded and listened as John stood, walking to the end of the boat and preparing to set sail again.
“John.” A rich voice cut through the thick air, causing the strings to shake around him. He turned, his vision taking a moment to catch up with the action. He saw the vague outlines of Greg and Molly, frozen where they had been standing. “John, look at me.” There was that voice again. He turned in the direction of the voice and felt his knees go weak. Sherlock was standing before him, looking crisp and clear amongst the distorted colors.
"Of course, you must be John! Oh, Sherlock has been so excited about tonight. Must have changed his shirt a thousand times." John blushed, smirking shyly. "And he certainly wasn't exaggerating about your good looks, was he?"
“If you like what I’m about to show you, I can arrange to have you moved down to this level so you don’t have to worry about me carrying you every time you want to come down here.” Sherlock nodded uncertainly, still slightly wary of his captor.
As his awareness increased, John took stock of his body, counting the wounds and trying to figure out what had happened.
“John Watson is no longer influenced by time or fate. You have no timeline Dr. Watson, feel free to exist with Sherlock until you get bored of him or vice versa.” With that, Mycroft was gone, leaving John and Sherlock alone once more.
“Sherlock?” George had come to visit. Sherlock allowed himself to flicker into view, startling the other man. “Hey Mate. How’s he doing?”
“Bruised.” John chuckled, pressing his fingers against the healed skin where there used to be a gaping, bleeding hole.
“Yeah, Sherlock. I swear, he is the most difficult man I have ever had the misfortune to work with.” John swallowed another flare of nerves. “Do you happen to know your shade? I don’t remember where I left your coding sheet.”
He helped Sherlock ready the ship, his grin never fading as they pushed off, sailing from E3 together.
“I feel sorry for the future of Scotland Yard if people like you are what they have coming in.” Sherlock muttered, glaring at the watch in his hand. John was about to ask what he meant when the taller man waved his hand over the watch.
Mycroft had been the focus of Greg's attention for most of last year, and John had been the only one that knew.
I know you're going on soon, just wanted to say I miss you, and I know you're going to do amazing! – JW
“We did, but I enjoy surprising you.” John laughed again, forgetting for a moment that Greg was standing behind him. He jumped when he felt a solid, warm hand land on his shoulder.
He offered his Nan a tense smile and glanced up at Sherlock. The boy was chewing anxiously at his bottom lip and staring at the floor. Nan stepped around them, and John turned Sherlock to face him, cupping his cheek and pressing a soft kiss to his lips.
Mrs. Hudson tried to keep him entertained, talking to him and introducing him to some of the other staff members. It worked for about an hour the first day, then he got bored and started itching for something to do.
“What is your plan?” Moran spoke for the first time. Moriarty grinned and stepped away from Sherlock, letting him fall to the floor.
“So you aren’t-” John’s heart hurt when he saw the hope leaving his friend’s eyes as he shook his head. Nothing had changed, John wasn’t staying on E2, and after he finished helping Sherlock there would be nothing stopping him from sailing into the next storm. He sighed and gently patted Mike’s cheek before turning to Sherlock, waving his companion over.
“God yes John. I want to touch you, for real.” John gasped as Sherlock shoved him back against the counter, pressing close and biting on his bottom lip gently. John’s entire frame was wracked with shocks of static electricity. He could feel his lungs tightening and his pulse racing. “I want to feel you John. To feel you inside me.” John shut his eyes tight, clinging to Sherlock’s frame.
A few hours later, Rosie was down with Mrs. Hudson, the kitchen was cleared and tea was made. Sherlock sat in his armchair across from John, squirming uncomfortably under the gaze of his lover.
“You are whining about a ghost shooting your walls and you are skeptical about preforming a séance?”
“John, there is only one reason my little brother would have fled the town like that. Something happened. And I have a feeling that that something’s name is James Moriarty.”
“I-it’s- it’s beautiful.” John wasn’t completely certain he was just talking about the array of colored strings that now made up his world. Sherlock seemed to glow with a faint, silver light.
It wasn't often Sherlock took the lead when they were together, preferring to let John have control, but every so often, especially when he was bored, he would initiate things.
His breath hitched as he felt a cold finger massaging his entrance, sending a shock of arousal through him. John's other hand was suddenly on his cheek, guiding his face down to meet John's in a soft kiss.
Once he was stretched to John's satisfaction, Sherlock felt the fingers inside him slip out and whined at the emptiness, tugging at his hair as John started unbuttoning his own trousers and adjusting Sherlock's hips. He let himself be moved, whimpering when he head the click of the lubricant bottle and the sound of John slicking himself.
He was vaguely aware of John finishing, pushing into him roughly a few more times before filling him with his mess.
"They have been out of town for nearly three months on business. I assumed they were going to be gone for a while longer." John rolled off the bed, grabbing his clothes off the floor and trying no to panic. "Why are you freaking out? They know about us-"
“What are you going to do to me?” The question fell from his lips before he could stop it. The Beast stopped mid-turn, hesitating at Sherlock’s question.
“Let’s just say, he knows when he is out of his league.” Mike winked and took a swig of his drink, leaving Sherlock more confused than before.
“I’m not, but I am the only person in this house that seems to know anything about hospitality.” She snapped before leaving, Sherlock latched the door behind her, before spinning to face John.
“You want me to command you?” He asked, gripping Sherlock’s curls in his hand and pulling him down to growl the words in the younger man’s ear. “You want me to tell you what you can and cannot do?” Sherlock whimpered and nodded, scrabbling for purchase against John’s chest. The shorter man chuckled darkly as he bit Sherlock’s earlobe gently, pulling a whine from the young man.
"Stop it-" Pain flowered across his jaw as Anderson's fist connected with his face. Tears slipped from his eyes as he struggled to escape, making his attacker laugh harder. "S-Stop, please-"
"A bunch of us are going to see a movie tonight, wondered if you two wanted to join us. But since you're clearly busy defiling the mirror, I'll just tell everyone y'all are busy."
"He is attending college now, finished his classes over summer break." John could see the disappointment in his friend's face, and made a mental note to ask Sherlock about Mycroft later. Greg shrugged, grinning half-heartedly before starting to step away.
"You're welcome Dearie. Would you like a ride?" Sherlock nodded and stood, shoving the bag of supplies into the duffel he had packed, and reaching for his jacket.
"I refuse to murder a friend." John lowered the sword, blinking up at Sherlock. He laughed, but it came out hollow and empty.
"Y-You want sex." John blushed, shrugging and grabbing Sherlock's hand, pulling it up to his lips and pressing a soft kiss to the knuckles.
Against the cheek of his lover his own erection strained and John, in kind, lapped and licked at the swollen tip that yearned for more.  Just as the detective was reaching that point of no return, his lover pulled back, and in one liquid movement Sherlock found himself flipped, tummy on the cold floor of the morgue, as John pressed up behind him.  It was like two pieces that fit and worked only together were suddenly reunited, the cogs of their mechanism slipping back into gear, tandem movement once more a possibility.  He felt John’s hard erection pressing and raised his hips to meet his lover.  With a gasp and a shutter, Sherlock felt the head of his lover’s cock enter, pausing only the barest of moments for him to catch his stuttered breath, before it was forced forward and John pushed into him fully.
When the feet of the immortals touched down in a dark corner just off Baker Street.  The Taxi with the flats primary occupants, was just skidding to a stop on the icy street in front of the black door. A small white car blared its horn at the Taxi's sudden attempt at breaking given the current road conditions, before skirting around and disappearing into the night. The back door of the Taxi nearest to the flat, swung open and the tall dark figure of the infamous consulting-detective emerged in a smooth motion. He straightened his coat in a very proper fashion and scanned the block around him, before turning back towards the car. The other occupant slid towards the open door only to grab the handle rather than step out.
“It’s the only place we can be close to equals, John,” Sherlock murmured, eyes still focused on the immortal's mouth. “Obviously we shall never be equals mentally. That much is a given.” Strangely, Sherlock’s tone was not laced with his trademark arrogance as he spoke the words. More, the casual tones of pointing out that he was physically taller than John – which he also liked to do – and there was no debating the statement.
The postcard was written by a woman, trying in vain to mimic Mary Morstan’s handwriting.  Perhaps a lazy distracted graphologist would assume they were one in the same but Sherlock was not fooled for a second.  The ‘L’s were forced and heavy, characteristic of shaky hand, when eyes are darting back and forth between the writer’s sample and the new work, as well as the fact that the overall slant to Mary’s hand was missing.  Plus, there was the simple fact that a dead woman could not write or put a card in the post.  So, whomever had was most certainly linked to the woman’s assailant.
Licking his suddenly dry lips, John opened his mouth to tell the man to leave only to draw in a sharp breath as nail grazed along the inside of his forearms. Sherlock’s eyes darted down as he did, staying locked on his lips for a long moment. Scrunching the jumper in his hands he tossed the material into a basket. “Get in bed John.” The genius took a slow step back, not looking away.
“Close the damn door, you idiot,” she snapped.  It was more playful than it was scolding, but what surprised him more was the woman’s accent.  It was not British and it certainly was not Scottish, which he had expected.  It sounded, perhaps American.  He did as he was told and closed the door behind him, watching her roll those large eyes in an exaggerated exasperation, as she chided under her breath, “Londoners.”
"My apologies." The man offered.  His tone was confusing, somehow seductive and not the least bit sincere.
The detective flexed his feet a few more times.  The muscles in his legs ached and the more he worked them he soon came to realize that his entire body ached—the withdrawal.  Despite the pain though he needed to get up and moving, the withdrawal required his motion.  He felt restless and his skin was itching, especially aggravated in the elbows and behind the knees.  More so though he needed to get outside, get a view of the area before the sunset and he could no longer see.
It was tough being bored. Having experienced more then most could even dare to fathom in the supernatural world had left Lestat feeling, more then once, as if there may be nothing really left to experience. When these moods would descend he would consider again the long sleep. Overwhelmed by the sheer gravity of what had already come to pass or sometimes some other, greater mystery of the world would inevitably pull the vampire prince into it's gravity and hurl him through yet another cataclysmic exploration of his existence. His encounters with all the other great supernatural entities he had met thus far had proven one thing to him: the world was not done with him yet. Fate, God or whatever greater thing that pulled the threads of events would not allow him to perish and if he was to continue to exist until the world burned out, then he would have to find some way to pass the time.
The immortal stayed, starkly still and high above the scene unfolding on the street. Knowing full well that he was far too high for any mortal eyes to capture from the ground below and he patiently waited for the ant-like figure of the detective to emerge from the Baker street flat. When the detectives figure had cast his gaze skyward, squinting desperately into the hazy night sky, searching for what, he didn't know, the vampire let out a low and dangerous chuckle. Saluting to the man on the street from his lofty position, despite clearly knowing that the other couldn't pinpoint his silhouette against the blackness and low hanging clouds of the London skyline, he said, “We are going to have such fun together, Sherlock Holmes. You…and I.”
, came her rush of thoughts to Lestat's ears and he couldn't help but chuckle as he released the hand and smiled warmly at her.
David was no fool.  He realized of course that the mortal was also seeing memories of his own life, both when mortal and when damned, yet this was only a testament to the level of trust that the two men shared and was part of the drive they had to be in one another’s arms once more.
“I chose this when Lestat gave me the ultimatum… to try to save you… and you wanting this so badly means that, in a way, I sacrificed my soul for nothing. I realize that we both will live a new fantastic, practically immortal life if you are changed. As much as I love you – you insufferable cock – I can’t tell you that I want to spend eternity with you, because I don’t know if that’s what I want.” The confession finally passing the vampire’s lips lifted a weight off John’s mind and heart that he hadn’t realized was so painfully heavy.
The world faded away, and just as his last thought echoed through the air, Sherlock felt the insistent throbbing of something beating the walls of his mind palace.
“Fine, but if you insist on not sleeping here, there is a spare bedroom just up the stairs. There is lab equipment on the bed, just set it on the floor for now.” John nodded and grabbed Sherlock’s cell, quickly entering his phone number.
John bit back a scream of agony when Moriarty spun him, dragging his broken knee on the ground and making the bones crunch. He hung his head and refused to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
"Babe, it's six in the evening." Sherlock blinked at him for a moment before sending a withering glare at John's alarm clock.
“Who are you? We aren’t trespassing, this is college property.” John straightened his shoulders and clenched his fists. The new man ran his eyes along John’s frame, taking in every inch of him with intrigued eyes. John licked his bottom lip and shifted on his feet.
When Harry finally got bored of bothering Sherlock, John waved him over, gripping his hips and pulling him back to stand under the kitchen doorway.
His chest heaved painfully and he tugged at his curls, but the action sent an image of John tugging her hair spiraling across his mind and he felt a fresh wave of nausea crash over him.
"You uh- you look amazing tonight." John mumbled, blushing as he noticed Sherlock's own cheeks darkening at the compliment.
“Not at all. She was a bitch.” John laughed again and pulled Sherlock down for a kiss. The crowd cheered, causing a blush to rise along Sherlock’s neck.
The words had been a bit of a shock for John as well, though now that they were out there, he couldn't deny the truth in them. Sherlock was gorgeous, high cheekbones, sharp eyes and pale skin giving him an androgynous appearance that was doing funny things to John's brain.
"Thanks Mate, was starting to feel like a bit of an idiot there." John motioned for the other kid to sit, tucking his books into his bag and waving the waitress over. He ordered a plate of chips for him and Sherlock to split, resisting the urge to flirt with the pretty waitress that kept sending him shy smiles.
“Fuck!” He shouted, gripping the injured hand tight to his chest and letting the tears fall. He was in pain, not just physical pain. He had lost the only person that gave him a reason to live, and now he couldn’t even ready his own ship to sail away.
"I know how much you like taking me when you're fully clothed. Your- your pulse beats faster than usual and you fuck me harder." Sherlock's ears burned at the growl that slipped from John's throat and he realized he had never said anything like that before. He threaded his fingers in John's hair and tugged gently. "I like it when you fuck me hard Daddy." He whispered, arousal burning through him as he watched John's pupils dilate.
He finally escaped the small crowd and made his way to the dressing room. He needed some water and to check his phone.
“What am I supposed to do Sherlock? I can’t get the memories out of my head. Every time I close my eyes, all I can see is the faces of my crew as they died. They died to save me, Sherlock, every single one of them.” John had turned to face Sherlock, barely fighting back the tears. “I should have died that day. It should have been me.” Sherlock frowned, glaring at the ground. John sniffled and wiped his eyes. “Let’s go. Mikey’s waiting.” He turned and stalked away, not waiting for Sherlock’s response.
“You know, I believe it isn’t a good thing when a human’s breathing pattern reaches that speed, I would suggest you try to slow your heartrate down before you pass out.” John shook his head, noticing that the new man was, in fact, correct about his breathing.
"Bullshit." Sherlock flushed, glaring at the floor between his feet. "Listen, yours and John's sex life is none of my business, and frankly I really don't want to know, but I'm telling you it's a bad idea." Sherlock felt his chest tighten unpleasantly and he blinked rapidly, trying to stop the tears from falling. He heard Lestrade stand and walk around to stand next to Sherlock, gripping his shoulder tightly, trying to comfort him.
“Fine. I still have some friends down at New Scotland Yard. Want to help me solve crimes? I used to be pretty good at it.”
All logic told him that the flame would go out as soon as it touched the blood, but that didn’t happen. Instead there was a huge puff of smoke and a flash of light.
He knelt in front of Sherlock and wrapped the Collar around his neck. He fought with the buckle for a moment to get it to latch, noticing when Sherlock winced by the sound of his hiss in his ear.
It didn't hurt, not as much as Sherlock had been anticipating, but it wasn't pleasant. His body tightened around John's finger, trying to push him out.
"Hey!" The team poured into the room, each boy handing Sherlock a yellow rose and offering him words of praise. Sherlock stood stock still, his body flooded with shock and disbelief as one by one, the entire team entered the room.
“I know. I was just about to wake you. I have to get going too, I’ve got a meeting.” He pushed his chair back and stood, stepping out of the kitchen to grab his book-bag.
"I-I love you." Sherlock's voice was soft and broken when he spoke, and he quickly covered his face, embarrassment filling him as he felt John tense above him.
“How did he do that?” John eventually asked, his voice soft and wavering. He still wouldn’t make eye contact, and Sherlock suddenly understood what was wrong.
"It's alright Love, I've got you. Daddy's going to take such good care of you." Fire spread through Sherlock's body so suddenly it left him gasping and trembling.
“Snow in June. This does not bode well for us my friend.” He murmured to the horse, uncertainty starting to hang heavy on his shoulders.
The redhead was pretty, even more so now that she had applied a understated swath of cosmetics. Her soft milky skin was clean of the dirt and feathers of her research labors and her naturally pink lips were even more alluring and distracting, complimented by the darker streaks on roan in the strands of hair that framed her face, combed and arranged.
John rolled over onto his side, cradling his head on the pillow, hoping that if he pressed its softness against his temples that it might in some way dull the splitting pain.  As his body moved over the sheets, his mind slowly registered the slippery soft feeling of the silken sheets that wrapped him, the plushness of the duvet that he had cocooned himself within.  This wasn’t his bed.
Sherlock's cheeks were darker than he had ever seen them and he looked as though he was on the verge of passing out.
“Moriarty, what can I help you with?” He didn’t bother keeping the irritation out of his voice. Moriarty chuckled and stepped slightly closer to Sherlock.
"We have proof your name is John Hamish Watson." Lestrade snapped, closing his notebook and crossing his arms, giving the boy a look Sherlock knew all too well. "Just tell us who your pimp is, we can protect you."
“I woke up and you weren’t there. I-I had to find you.” John’s heart began racing at those words, his head spinning and hope causing his chest to swell.
“You’re being rude! Do you have any idea how much shit you’ve caused today? If you scare him off you will lose your contract.”
“Sorry to interrupt this little eye fucking session, but I have to get John ready for the actual fucking session.” John blushed this time as he remembered why exactly he was here, talking to Sherlock Holmes. “John, I need you in the chair.” He nodded and forced himself to return to his seat. “Shirt off please.”
“N-No.” He finally managed to whisper, the sound coming out broken and raw. “N-No, Sherlock. Stop.” He pushed at the taller man, trying to get him off, to get him away. Sherlock refused to budge, taking John’s face in his hands and pressing soft kisses to his cheeks, nose and lips. “Don’t- please don’t.” He begged. He had promised that he wouldn’t do this, wouldn’t guilt Sherlock into loving him. John pushed at Sherlock’s chest, still begging him to stop.
“Then I will pick you up and carry your skinny ass there.” There was no room for negotiation in his tone, so Sherlock obeyed, pushing himself to his feet and glaring at the creature before him. A spark of realization hit him and couldn’t stop himself from saying what crossed his mind.
While he waited, he tried to finish his chemistry homework, staring blankly at the words on the sheet.
"Something wrong Gorgeous?" Sherlock smirked, buttoning his suit jacket and fussing with his sleeves, a nervous habit he had developed.
"His best friend left!" The room filled with tension as Sherlock slammed the glass on the desk. "Everything was fine, then one day I get called into my father's office and he tells me that your dad was fucking the priest and him and his family had been forced out."
He let John lead him up the stairs, keeping his eyes trained on their joined hands as they weaved their way through the crowd of drunken students.
"Please Mr. Holmes, just look at the case-" Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes and standing. He made his way over to the window, fighting back a wave of irritation toward the client in his sitting room. "My brother-"
“What if we summon Death?” He asked one day, the question falling from his lips before he could stop it.
He was so confident in his skills, he even made a bet with Greg Lestrade, who was dating Sherlock's older brother Mycroft, that he could make the detective lose his composure in public quicker than Greg could make Mycroft lose his.
"No." Sherlock blanched at the harshness of Gavin's tone, blinking uncertainly at the older man. "You need to talk to him, sit down and discuss this like adults."
“That sounds great! Send me a message when you reach the gates, we can go to the diner off the compound.”
He gasped as he felt the tip of John's member press against him, his hands reaching for John's sweater.
"Fine." John growled, pushing off Sherlock and taking his hand. "Come on then." Sherlock let himself be dragged up the stairs, blushing as the rest of the Rugby team noticed and whistled after them.
“Do you remember Victor?” Sherlock’s ghost nodded, chewing on his lip. Victor was not a pleasant memory. “His father threatened us, made us promise to leave Vic if we wanted him to stay safe. Needless to say, we didn’t take it very well.”
“It is.” Sherlock stepped closer to john, causing the strings around him to shift and change, moving with his thin frame. John was entranced, watching the only clear thing within the chaos move. Sherlock stopped when he reached John, close enough that John could almost feel his warmth through his jumper. John felt his pulse quicken, his breath hitching in his throat as he watched the taller man reach for his wrist.
Sherlock felt a flash of fear as his attacker knocked his books from his hands, scattering them across the empty halls. Anderson, the boy that was attacking him, laughed, sending panic lancing through Sherlock's body.
“No, I swear it. Last year you OD’d on heroin and tried to throw yourself off the roof of Bart’s. I just went to see your body last week.” John felt his heart drop, and had to back up to prevent hurting himself. He fell onto the sofa, his chest tight and heart beat far too high.
"They know I'm gonna fuck you senseless." John growled in Sherlock's ear, making his head spin. They had been having sex for a few months now, and Sherlock had never seen John quite like this. The Rugby player was confident on a good day, but this was a whole other level of confidence, and Sherlock found himself lightheaded in it's wake.
"He called you boring, John! You are the farthest thing from boring." John huffed a frustrated laugh, pulling away slightly and leaning up to press a soft kiss to Sherlock's lips. "You're not boring, or ordinary, John. You are perfect and brilliant, and anyone who says otherwise is an idiot." John blushed, reaching up and brushing a stray curl out of Sherlock's eyes.
"Y-Yes, how did you know that?" Greg's cheeks darkened and he rubbed the back of his neck, laughing nervously.
“I am not your betrothed. I don’t belong to you!” Moriarty stepped close to Sherlock, reaching up to brush the curls out of Sherlock’s face. The younger man stopped his hand before he could touch him. “Don’t touch me, you spider.” He growled, feeling an unnerving sense of fear at the anger that filled Moriarty’s face.
"Mr. Watson suffered from severe bruising, as well as several fractures and a significant level of internal injuries. We have managed to stabilize him for now, but there is no guarantee that he is going to survive the night. You should be prepared to say your goodbyes." The doctor left, leaving Sherlock standing in the empty hall.
“Yep. It’s in the fridge.” Sherlock cocked an eyebrow at the Beast. “Shut up, it’s a force of habit to collect samples.” Sherlock shrugged and wheeled himself over to one of the stations, wiping down the dust and admiring the closest microscope. “Well, I’ll leave you to it. I’ll have Mrs. Hudson bring you some tea and biscuits.”
"Next time make sure no one is home before you fuck your boyfriend, eh?" Sherlock's jaw dropped as he realized what John was so upset about. "I'm happy for you guys!"
"Hmm, Sherlock, I like that." John scanned the detective's body, stepping even closer. Something changed in the boy's eyes, an uncertainty filling them as he smiled up at Sherlock. "I uh- I'm not good at this, the whole- you know- properly asking someone out. I'm used to just offering what I have and taking what I got." John's cheeks darkened and he avoided Sherlock's eyes, his stature going from confident to shameful.
"Don't worry Love, I would never treat you like that unless you wanted it." John whispered, brushing the curls out of Sherlock's face and smiling fondly at him. "So, no nappies or age-play, just us." Sherlock nodded, biting his lip as he slid out of his chair, straddling John's hips and threading his fingers through the older man's hair. "Is that what you want?" He could hear John fighting to keep his voice from shaking and smirked, leaning in and pressing a kiss to the sensitive skin behind his ear.
"Oh well, say hi to him for me, will you? Come on, the team wants to meet you." Greg jogged away, calling for the team.
John gently slipped his fingers out of his boyfriend's body, quickly pushing his pyjama trousers down and spreading some slick over his own throbbing erection. He leaned down, kissing Sherlock tenderly and threading his fingers through the boy's curls.
“Do you ever wonder if you will turn out like him? Beating your kids when you’ve had too much to drink?” John shook his head, pushing his way around Sherlock and heading for the kitchen. “Oh! That’s what your nightmares are about. You imagine yourself beating the person you love. Your little sister. Am I right?”
“No, stop that. You have nothing to be sorry for Love. We’ve already talked about this. It was my fault, I knew something was wrong and I didn’t say anything.” He pulled Sherlock’s face closer so their lips were just barely touching. “Besides, we never have to worry about that again.” He closed the gap between their lips and kissed Sherlock, a slow, deep kiss that left his knees more than a little weak. Sherlock whimpered softly as he broke the kiss, fighting to keep his breathing steady.
"I love you Tiny Dancer." John whispered, leaning down to kiss his boyfriend sweetly. Sherlock blushed and timidly traced the neckline of John's shirt, a pleased smile tugging at his lips. "You beautiful thing you." Sherlock's blush deepened and he tried to hide his face, but John stopped his hands before they could cover him, and kissed him again.
"So, will I see you tomorrow?" Sherlock frowned at him, his cheeks turning pink under the soft light.
Sherlock fled, wiping the tears from his cheeks as he stumbled home, trying desperately to ignore Anderson's voice as it echoed through his mind. It wouldn't have been the first time someone had spread a rumour about him, but this one could easily destroy something he loved more than anything.
A warm hand gripped his own tightly and he gasped, glancing up to meet the earnest eyes of John Watson.
“Who the fuck is this guy?” John did not sound impressed. Moriarty glanced vaguely at the soldier before smirking back at Sherlock.
“My brother is a rather significant investor in this company.” The now-familiar voice of his co-star caused John to jump slightly, spinning to face the pale man. “Kind of gives me a fair bit of pull.” Sherlock winked, a mischievous grin pulling at his lips.
"It's uh- it's fine." John mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck nervously and smirking when Sherlock pulled away.
One day, Mycroft even visited. It led to a fight of epic proportions, Sherlock threatening to kill his brother before Mycroft hit him with his infernal umbrella.
The steel breached the skin and slid through the muscle and tissue. He struck resistance and pressed more firmly, forcing through the barrier until the needle continued with ease. He stopped pushing in and pulled back the plunger, watching as the barrel filled with a thick, cloudy fluid.
"Damn, cute and funny, how'd I get so lucky?" Sherlock blushed, glaring at the floor between his feet and chewing anxiously on his bottom lip. "You like hot coco? Can't watch White Christmas without coco."
“I’m on a suicide mission, remember? I’m looking for danger.” John winked, turning to face the far end of the ship and backing up a few steps.
"Hey, do you want to get out of here? I'm bored, and this place is stuffier than I thought." Sherlock's brow furrowed in confusion, but he nodded timidly. "Great, meet me outside, I'll settle the bill." Sherlock blinked for a moment before standing and grabbing for his coat and scarf.
He was distantly aware of Sherlock tugging at his shirt, and tried to help, tried to convince his limbs to co-operate. He couldn’t seem to summon the strength to make them move and whined in frustration, feeling Sherlock laugh softly against his chest, where the Siren was pressing kisses and sucking gently.
A hint of sadness flashed in John's eyes, but quickly faded as he shifted, moving Sherlock's legs apart so he could sit between them.
"Sherlock, that's enough!" John snapped, rubbing his hands over his face and glaring at the detective, trying to catch his attention. Sherlock rolled his eyes, ignoring John and continuing to spout abuse at Lestrade and the detectives filling their flat.
“Holy shit.” John felt his heart break for the poor spirit. He couldn’t imagine being trapped in a boring flat for twenty years.
“You were going to before you touched him outside of time.” Sherlock froze, he hadn’t thought of that. John had been touched outside of time, the bond was physical now. That’s why he was so upset about John not waking up. What was left of his heart shattered, he dropped to his knees, the weight of the bond heavy on his shoulders. “Break the bond with John, and I will give him his life back.”
“I don’t care. If he is free, nothing else matters, he deserves that.” The Enchantress nodded, stepping away from Sherlock and fading away, taking with her everything else he could see.
Greg listened as the doctors call his time of death, wheeling their crash carts from the room and trying to get Mycroft’s attention.
He got John tucked into bed and lay down beside him, watching his lover as his sleepy body took over. John yawned and stretched, making another soft dinosaur noise as he did.
“Please don’t make me do this Sherlock. Can’t we just pretend? One week, then I’ll go, you won’t even miss me.” Sherlock shook his head, kissing John tenderly once more, not wanting to let him go, but knowing he was going to lose him.
"John-" Sherlock bit back a cry as John wormed his hand under his shirt and pinched one of his nipples just shy of too hard.
“Really? You want to know everything about my sex life, but I’m not allowed to know if you like some random politician? That’s hardly fair.”
"Like anyone would want to date you. Seriously though, if you miss me that much-" Sherlock gasped as the phone was wrenched from his hand, John spinning away from him and pressing the speakerphone button.
When they finally got home, John stood in the middle of 221B Baker Street, looking around and feeling his heart flutter. Sherlock stepped up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist, pressing soft kisses against the skin of his neck.
“It’s irregular but strong. Grab me my kit.” He pushed into Sherlock’s room, dropping the young man onto the bed and tearing open his shirt. Greg heaved his kit onto the bed, climbing on and opening it, ready to help.
“Why must you always chase after him? There are plenty of other men in town that would die to be with you.”
“That tail of yours for one. Siren’s are considered dangerous to most people. They might put up a fight if they see your tail.”
“No! You’re not real! John! John!” His vision blurred as his breathing turned erratic. Warm arms pulled him into their firm embrace and his mind was filled with memories of Victor. He could remember long nights spent in the other man’s arms, days spent apart so no one found out. He remembered stolen kisses in the university supply closet.
"Fuck- so gorgeous Love-" John whispered, kissing Sherlock deeply, catching a loud moan that nearly fell as he pressed against his prostate roughly.
Mike pulled him into his arms and John let himself be held, his tears staining the shirt of his friend. He didn’t hear Mikey’s phone ring, and he didn’t feel the other man push the button to lull him back into darkness.
John's fists were clenched at his sides and he was fighting to keep his breath steady. His pupils were dilated, and his tongue kept darting out to lick at his bottom lip.
“Basically.” Sherlock grinned up at him, an expression that John only ever saw if he was laughing himself. Sherlock cleared his throat and John became very aware he was still touching the young man. He quickly withdrew, rubbing his face and backing away slightly. “I-I’m going to go, I need to talk to Mycroft about, something.” He awkwardly fled, thanking every deity he could think of that he had fur to hide the blush that had taken over his face.
Lestat began to hum a song—with contempt Sherlock did recognize the tune.  With asinine intent it was the theme from the American quiz based game show,
That full mouth pulled into a soft smile, dimpling at the sides, as those remarkable eyes starred ravenously back at him.  The more he pulled away the stronger the detective’s grip about his hips became.  There was a moment of hesitation, a soft chuckle, and then the answer, “I promise, John Watson, never again,” before they melted together, mouths claimed, limbs intertwined.
The lyrics were working, they were distracting.  Sherlock could feel the hairs at the nape of his neck rise, as he tried to ward off the prickling sensation that struck the lower quadrant of his frontal lobe, behind his eyes.  It was that feeling again and it drove an icy stake of panic through his thought process and deductive reasoning, the distinct sensation that someone was prying, a burglar with a crow bar at the hinges of his mind palace, with a very real chance of getting inside.
The curtains at the foot of the bed were raked back by what seemed like an invisible force.  The immortal moved so quickly that John even had trouble tracking him and suddenly the detective’s throat was in the vampire’s clutches.
The detective wanted to say ‘yes’.  He wanted to affirm this, without a doubt, but there was something—nagging—at the back of his mind that made him swallow the words.  Instead he heard himself answer emphatically, “No.”  Was it him, had he done it, or was it just instinct, some kind of mental autopilot that had taken control of his mind and body?
“Yet, Louis seems strangely absent.” An unnecessary gesture was made to emphasize the empty space beside them before David turned a more serious look at his maker. “Oh, that’s right. He’s enjoying himself with, Armand.”
"It's just a dream, Sherlock." John repeated stubbornly, emphasizing, "This can't be a true sense of anything.  It's in our minds, we could imagine anything."
Growing more impatient he finally just spat at the small woman, as he rose to tower over her, “John Watson is not dead and you keeping me here is hindering me from finding him, from helping him!  If you feel so strongly that he was a good man, then help me get off this island.”
Movement in his periphery caught the immortal’s attention and drew his heightened gaze to the figures that were parting ways in the early evening of the ever romantic setting of the park.  A tall dark skinned man kissed the cheek of his pale lover, playfully grasping her backside one last time before they left one another for their respective homes.  They thought nothing of it, walking the trails away from one another alone in the darkness of the green space.  Lestat bent at the knees and leapt from the building top, over the high fence and into the park.  He landed with grace and ease on the ground mere steps behind the dark haired female, making no sound as to alarm her.
Sherlock’s fingers ripped free of his hair on a guttural groan, instead fisting the sheets tightly. His back arched as John's thumb began a slow massage against his perineum. More sounds fell unbidden from his lips, almost a plea, nearly a demand. Desire and possession thrummed through John’s veins as he added another finger.
He felt the hot press of the mouth again, the lick of the reddened tongue against the painful tender trauma of the bite, and then the words, “Last chance or he dies.”
"You're dreaming." Sherlock stated, as though this were an answer of some kind that would enlighten him in some manner.
Marisa stood near a large door, with an appropriately large iron key in her hand. She too was tucked low to accommodate the clearance of the ceiling.
John's mouth gave the detective a wry smile and the vampire took a step forward, coming into the man's space, as he lowered his voice and answered, "I could smell you."
Sherlock would try to picture a scene in his mind and John would be able to pick it up but it lacked any detail.  It was fuzzy, like a heavy lens blur was being used. While Sherlock could not read any of what John was thinking, the vampire could project a thought or images into Sherlock’s mind with some work. This was even more broken and hard on both parties. John felt mentally tired by the end of it and his thirst was beginning to build to an unboreable level, when Sherlock’s mobile lit up with a call from Mycroft.
“I’m not sure yet that I will.” The doctor admitted.  His face made that pinched smile that John hated and couldn’t help.  It always gave the observer the impression that he was holding back or giving half-truths.  Though this he knew was the truth.  He really was not sure that he was ready to handle the detective yet—no matter what capacity he lived in now.
you?” the young vampire blustered, somehow finding the strength and the reserve somehow to restrain his anger.  Instead of swinging a fist or opting for a tussle, he smiled.  It was not a pleasant smile.  It was one that was stretched, tight lipped, clearly holding back.  “Help me to understand just why I should
Everything was made of blue veined marble, accented by silver fixtures, and rich hard woods.  There was a large triple headed shower encased in glass in one corner, flanked by a jacuzzi large enough for a pool party, and a toilet with what he thought must be a bidet.  John swallowed his awe and moved past a double sink vanity to the toilet.
He kissed and he swallowed and he drank. With each swallow a hot pleasurable warmth filled him, consumed him, until suddenly and violently he was thrust away, reaching and grasping like a child for a mother.
“Oh, well, I suppose I may need to schedule that check for my hearing.” The elderly woman admitted with a hearty chuckle, placing a hand to her brow and shaking her head.  “It is a dreadful thing, this gettin’ older.  I had it in my head that his name was Daniel.  But—Lestat, was it?” she paused only briefly, glancing at him as though looking for his confirmation and then continuing on without giving the immortal the time to voice it, “I say, that is a different name, now isn’t it?  You’d think one could keep that straight.  But I suppose I will have the chance now.  He was a very smartly dressed gentleman, not unlike yourself.  What is it that you do again, Louis?”
“It’s more a melding of personalities. One believing they are in control of the other, when in realty the two have become one being.” Sherlock clarified.
"Surprised?" John repeated the word, unsure what the man was getting at.  All of this was surprising.
The detective had not been surprised that she had spoke, he could tell for the last thirty minutes that she had wanted to.  The question however was most intriguing.  Sherlock was not sure he knew the answer.  Who was John Watson now?
"Thank you." He turned and walked into his flat, there was a finality to the click of the latch catching behind him.
“Mm-yes, thank you.” John responded, putting the cup back down on the desk.  At least she had seen him try it, maybe he could get away without finishing the awful brew that the nurses insisted on concocting in the staff kitchen.
The warning was warranted, might prevent disaster for the man, if only he would heed it.  Unlike his maker Louis knew that the detective would at least consider the warning.  It would have to be enough.
John wondered, where the man was. He wondered if Ludvik had gotten to him, if he was under attack and whether that attack was mental or physical. He damned his own inability to navigate this telepathic battlefield, for having failed so miserably in his attempt to over power this man, and for leaving Sherlock unprotected.
“So, what does that make us?” John hadn’t meant to ask, but he couldn’t help the words as they spilled from his lips. Sherlock propped himself up on his elbow, looking down at John with a near blank expression on his face. It wasn’t the same blank expression that he kept on while filming though, this one made him look younger and almost painfully uncertain.
"Not mine. I can't help how fucking hot you look when you're dancing." John laughed again as Sherlock's cheeks darkened further.
Sherlock smiled at the messages, feeling his confidence rise slightly. John was by far his biggest supporter, and even though he couldn't be there, it still warmed Sherlock's heart that he cared enough to text.
The man that stood before him was different than he remembered, yet somehow the same. He stood with a quiet, reserved nature that screamed military. He was just barely propping himself up on a cane, indicating a psychosomatic limp. His hair was trimmed to a longer version of military standard and there was the courage of a soldier hidden behind the pain in his dark blue irises.
He stood like a man, but he was the farthest thing from one. His face looked like a lion, and he had massive paws in place of hands and feet. Sherlock could see fangs and claws buried amongst the blondish fur.
"Fuck, you're a copper?" The boy backed away, panic in his eyes. Sherlock reached for him, trying to get the boy to calm down. "F-Fuck- I-I'm dead. H-He's going to kill me-"
John was almost halfway through the book before Sherlock showed any signs of improving. Mycroft checked in frequently, never staying for more than a few minutes at a time.
"John-" Sherlock stopped walking, glaring at his boyfriend. "How do you think it's going to look when word gets out that the whole football team ganged up on him after he attacked me? People already think I'm fucking half of them-"
"You're right, he is attractive." John felt his cheeks burn as he found himself pinned against the counter, Brittany pressing against his front and leaning in to latch onto his ear.
"Do me a favor then, and look it up right now." Sherlock opened his mouth to object, but the serious expression on John's face told him to just do as he said. He pulled out his phone and googled 'Daddy Kink.'
"Most likely. I don't have access to the studio after school, so I may come and watch your practice." John grinned, spinning Sherlock to face him and leaning up, pressing a kiss to his lips, making the taller boy blush.
"Practice is done at seven, meet you at Speedy's?" He turned around, grabbing his kit and leaving before Sherlock had a chance to respond.
"You had to go and have a child." John laughed, that wonderful, full-bodied laugh that Sherlock had fallen in love with, and kissed him lightly.
"If you're asking me if they molested me, they didn't." John fought against a blush that threatened to rise on his cheeks, glaring at a spot on the floor. John heard the girl wince and spun, his hands shooting out just in time to catch the taller girl as she stumbled. "S-Sorry-"
Sherlock watched the doctor rub his hands over his face in a cleansing motion, the emotion and exhaustion blatantly apparent on his features, as he pushed a heavy breath from his lungs.  The detective did not blame his comrade for his bafflement.  The body that had been inexplicably deposited on the door step to his Baker Street flat was quite the exquisite conundrum and the man was more than excited to have the lovely distraction along with the company of his former lover.
It was the perfect timing. Sherlock took the call, while he went about finding his evenings meal. Thankfully the area of town where their first stop was located was also not a good neighborhood and there was no shortage of villains who were more than deserving of a permanent punishment for their wrong doings.
The sloshing of the rain accumulated on the street drew his attention to the sudden stop of a black limousine beside him.  The window rolled down and inside he could see the nose of his brother poke out, as Mycroft demanded sharply, “Get in, little brother.”
Then there was the entire vampire thing, including the inexplicable strength, speed, and agility that the beautiful man had demonstrated—there was no other way for the soldier to look at it, the guy was incredibly beautiful, unexplainably pretty, like he was as perfect a creation as was wholly possible.  John did not like to make a habit out of categorically sizing up men but this one definitely scored a 10.  And last but not least, there was the part about Mary.
"Ohhh, if you insist." The tone started as if she was about to refuse before vanishing into a certain air of accomplishment that Louis could not help but find endearing.
Lestat’s eyes grew wide with dramatized surprise, before he rolled them back.  In a mocking voice that tinkled over the syllables like one might speak to a child, he answered, “Just how am I getting all that delightful blood out of those worthless mortals?”  The man paused, raking his top teeth over his bottom lip, before adding, “And what do you think I am doing with all of it?”
"Curious." Sherlock mused, as he considered that Lestat had obviously not been able to receive information from him and that possibly that was the reason for the piercing sting that had accompanied to blonde’s presence now and than before.
The woman froze for a second in her work, a plate half way out of the hot soapy water, and then she dropped it back in and turned round just enough to face him at the table behind her.  She looked utterly flabbergasted, edged with a deep sense of anger and deceit, and those wide eyes narrowed on him.  She looked quite beautiful then and he wondered if her ex had thought so when he had provoked such a look out of her.  It was obvious that most people would find any such expression similar to this to be somewhat threatening but the detective always enjoyed a good challenge.
He pulled a pair of jeans from the hamper of clean clothes he had not yet had time to put away properly and then a sleeveless tee. With both on, he marched down the stairs of the flat. John found the detective’s experiment in the kitchen and soon all his suspicions were realized. Sherlock had not only his Sig but also three other handguns, all of which were perfectly illegal to possess. He had them lined up on the kitchen table, laid out in order from largest to smallest on a black hand towel. Beside them was an open laptop with a large professional microphone and a scattering of other tools. Rulers, pens, pencils, an expensive looking digital camera, and a calculator were all crowded around a yellow notepad, which was filled with a hastily scribbled table and notes in the detective’s unruly cursive. This all, however, was dwarfed by a large rectangular metal box that took up the majority of the table’s surface. At one end of the box was a shaft of some sort that looked as though it fed inside.
Armand had given Louis a reply but the vampire was distracted and missed half of what the other had said.  Something damp and unpleasant had fallen with the sleet from the sky, plastering itself to top of his head.  He grabbed at it, pulling it down to see that it was no less disgusting than he had assumed—a sopping wet and torn piece of toilet paper.
The young rogue slipped from his grip, as John flinched and groaned. The bloodlust was intense, the feeling of it coursing through his system, the taste of it in his mouth was rapturous torture. He took a moment there, to settle it, gain control of it, whilst still using his mind to watch the area for other mortals. He knew that Louis would be as well, but he wanted to do it for himself. Soon, he may have no choice.
The black cab came to a screeching halt outside the home of Mary Morstan.  The windows were black, not a single light turned on, when others along the block were semi-lit with the activities of the people inside.  He threw cash at the driver, who lit up in the front seat.  Sherlock was out of the vehicle and up the steps to the front door without even bothering to close the vehicle door.  It didn’t take him long to find the spare key under the frog shaped flower pot—
Sherlock watched the other rise and walk away without another word and soon it was only he and the blond vampire left in the penthouse. The calm feeling had faded with the departure of the young vampire and his brain sluggishly began to try to analyze the situation he was in. John had been transformed into a blood drinker by the creature he was trapped in this room with. He had been bitten, much of his blood drank by his former lover and was too weak to even rise from his slumped position.
He had been staying at Armand’s while the other immortal was out of town, seeing that he had to abandon the Baker Street flat due to his own dangerous influence. He was going to make his way to check-in on the consulting detective shortly but needed to make a few other stops first.
The vampire turned his gaze away and tried very hard to look as if he actually knew what he was about to do.  Sherlock watched with scrutiny, defensively returning with a jab. "Well, I hardly see why, John. Not as if it would be the first time I had been in your 'bedroom'.” He emphasized this point by making a very sarcastic air quotation movement with a couple flicks of his fingers, adding brusquely, “And besides these circumstances are far more curious this go around."
Sherlock was certain that the two men knew of John Watson’s whereabouts and were involved in his disappearance.
There was silence. Lestat stood over the form of his lover whom had caught himself yet still sat somewhat on the floor, the emerald eyes turned away and a hand to the cheek that was so rudely assaulted.
The sound of blood pumping through the circulatory system was something that as a doctor the man had always been familiar with. It was a check mark on a check list to every patient. When he had become what he was now it had become a haunting beat of a drum, always there no matter how he steeled his mind to shut it out. It was the constant temptation, beating at his ear drums until they felt numb, making the back of his throat itch with a thirst that was never fully satisfied.
Passionate and bold, the Vampire Lestat had always been. Sometimes cruel but now his barbarity had reached new heights. His manipulations had uncharacteristically dark purposes and sinister intentions. They were not beyond his scope, but they were not of his true nature. Yet to all that knew him now, he was simply becoming the vile manipulator they had always known he could be. This thought, the knowledge of how those he loved now saw him, carved a black pit of despair into his chest.
“Mary.” He answered succinctly, the name happily blurted, as though it could form a barrier between them that could stop his blood from rushing south at the sight of his friend submerged in the hot bathwater.
As John walked through the drenched streets of London he found himself chuckling. For all intents and purposes, they had dated since the day he had moved in. The only difference now was that things had turned physical and that had been bloody amazing. So yes, he was willing to take that step. Now, all he had to do was convince Sherlock that he didn’t regret what had happened and wanted to see where things went.
The blond woman slipped over to his desk and settled herself into one of the chairs on the opposite side from the man she was engaged to, as though she were one of his patients seeking a consultation.  Her apple cheeks were pinked slightly, her parted lips glossed with something sparkly, and her large eyes framed in black were wide, intent, and searching John.  Realizing he was about to get questioned the doctor felt his entire body tense, the throb between his temples instantly intensifying, much to his chagrin.
Sherlock stepped back and drew his hand to his mouth, his index finger tapping against the pronounced bow of his upper lip, as he considered this fact.  The finger stopped tapping. Then he corrected his own conclusion, “But you’re not really dead, are you, John?”
The bright and unnaturally reflective eyes seemed to penetrate Sherlock, as John stopped in front of him. Without skipping a beat the shackled hand rose with a clang of the handcuffs sliding along the pipe, the maximum reach achieved.
He wanted Sherlock, of that there was no doubt. His mouth… John licked his lips, still tasting the man. His body… The scent of him lingered tantalizingly in his immortal nostrils. His entire being… The need to possess this man in every sense of the word was undeniably addicting. John could see the lust in the man’s eyes above him, tracking the movement of his own tongue across his pale lips.
“Ludvik is a dangerous man for more reasons than I can explain right now. You and John need to be ready for the unexpected, this guy will get into your head.” Snatching her cup she downed the last of her beverage and moved the dishes to the sink.
Suddenly the door to the apartment was flung open, banging loudly against the wall with the force. Startled, John jumped, spilling the half-full cup of near boiling tea onto his brown jumper and trousers. Cursing he leapt to his feet, pealing the jumper away from his skin while trying, one-handed, to remover the trousers. He sank to the ground, pain thrumming through him as his body and head protested the sudden movement.
Armand’s eyes darkened as he turned in his seat, the squeak of leather rubbing as he gripped the arm and leaned towards Louis, "And what if it is more than your 'ear' that I want, Louis?"
Sherlock gave a disgruntled snort of protest, twisting away in the chair, as he argued a muffled, “I’m still listening, John.”
Then why in the bloody hell had the man seduced him? And how did he even know how to seduce someone anyway? From what Mycroft had hinted the detective hadn’t had any sexual experiences, that he had been in fact a virgin. He certainly hadn’t acted like one, maybe Mycroft didn’t know as much as he thought.
"Now you must wait and I must leave. I will be back early tomorrow evening." Louis had turned towards the door and John’s heart-rate escalated.
His mobile face down on the desk vibrated.  The man’s eyes flicked to it, before his fingers slowly picked up and turned it over to face him.  He gave a long grating sigh, as his other hand returned to massaging his temple.  “And now they are in Belgium.”
There was a sinking in his gut, as he paused on the thought of the self-proclaimed ‘high-functioning sociopath’ spiraling into madness after the transformation. John had been prone to fits of hysterical laughter in those first nights, having great difficulty with rationalizing and accepting his new fate. The doctor in him vehemently refused to agree with the possibility of his own existence and means by which to continue living.
The blond hair was loose and no attempt to tame it had been given.  The gold-framed shades had been selected to try and reduce the almost frighteningly white shine of Lestat's eyes. It was his one attempt to blend in, easily causing hackles to rise on any who sensed that there was something off about their kind. It was usually easy enough to dismiss, a quick tinker in the poor little mortals mind and they would suddenly be thinking about how they should go to get a drink or go for a walk, but still it warranted an attempt to prevent.
John leaned his elbows down against the metal railing, taking in the sheer drop to the ground below.  Cars moved like black ants, people mere specks.  Directly below the balcony was a four storey wall of concrete before glass took over.  If he had to guess he would say he was at least some sixty storeys high, in the penthouse suite of some crazy new luxury high rise attempting to break the through the cityscape.  The view was intense.  Like nothing the doctor had ever seen, an incredible eagle-eyed view of London.
“Well thank you, now would you be so kind as to help me take the rest in? I’m afraid I’ll drop the eggs next and they won’t do near as well as the damned oranges.” Though her tone was trying to stay cheerful, it was easy to hear her frustration.
Something had happened. Something had changed. The prick at the back of his skull was absent. Free to move, his head snapped to assess the demon.
“I like your style, Mr. Holmes.” The complement was entirely sincere as the alabaster skinned man stood displayed before him in all his naked glory before he continued, “You are completely on edge and yet still sharp as any razor with that perfect wit of yours. I am quite enjoying myself.  Now let’s move this along. What have you discovered about me, Sherlock?  I know that you haven’t been wasting your time.”
Lestat finally turned his focus away from the threads in the Persian rug and turned a dangerous smile at the older Holmes brother, “Perhaps I should just show you?”
The man reached out, his fingers clawing around the thin neck, as those blue eyes shot wide with surprise. As his thumbs pressed knowingly down against the lump of wind pipe, running the length of her throat, her pink tongue shot out of her gaping mouth, sputtering spittle against his cheeks as tried to fight for a breath. The umbrella fell away as her hands swung upward, raking down against his face, pulling at his hair. Her nails cleaved deep trails into his flesh wherever she could reach him but he kept pushing, applying the force necessary to close the windpipe for good.
John stood and straightened his shirt, quickly checking to make sure he had not marred his own clothing in process. He mussed with his hair again, deciding to leave the body were it was, slumped in the snow against the paint peeling boards of the waning fence. Someone would find the man eventually. Just another unexplained death.
The man was growing increasingly upset with John’s irritation. “You said so yourself, John, that you could barely keep my thoughts out. Then when you need to, stop trying. Use them. Use me to bombard Ludvik.”
The flat was just as terrible.  Everything was in a disarray.  There were papers pinned to the wall above the couch, chaotic and rumpled, papers spread across the floor, tossed haphazardly in every direction, and papers spread across the table beside the laptop below the giant bison skull.  Tea cups and beakers were nestled in amongst the clutter.  Clothing here and there as well.  It was a general disaster.
The motion from behind became more rapt, more focused, and Sherlock had trouble stringing his words together, although he desperately needed to say them.  “I had…I had planned it.  Every detail.  I needed to…Ah, yes, yes!”
With each fractured memory that came to his mind’s eye it felt as if they too were being consumed by the creature that held him captive. Never had the detective experienced what this man was doing to him.  No drug nor intoxicant had ever given him such euphoria as that which rolled through his senses now. The nagging alarm was a quiet annoyance in the back corner of his perception.  He was with John now.  The memory was as real as living flesh in that moment.
"Where the hell is the bloody phone?!" The doctor stopped, narrowly avoiding a tumble, as he came skidding to a stop on white marble floors in front of the coffee-table. The fragrance of the huge bouquet displayed in the center took him a little off guard as he snatched the vibrating mobile and answered the unknown number.
Lestat had tasted enough pain in the unknown time he had spent in the company of this bastard demon-possessed madman to know enough not to answer. Instead, he cast his eyes skyward and remained as relaxed as he could will himself to be.
As Louis unfolded the newspaper he noted the photo of an officer with back turned to the camera, hunched over, appearing to be ill as medical staff were loading black body bags into waiting vehicles. The headline read: “MONSTER STALKS LONDON! 5 Dead in brutal slaying, bodies torn apart; more on page 3.” Louis head swam as he considered the implications of what he was discovering.
“I need you there.” Sherlock didn’t pause in his rummaging through the wardrobe as he spoke. His statement was muttered distractedly, as though he were running through a variety of different situations, not a single thought on the position he was currently trying to put John in.
The blond stepped toward his fledgling, reaching out a hand and clasping David’s forearm, as he sweetly remarked, “Go fuck yourself, David.”
“Damn, ‘Sorry Chap’… don’t even help the man up.” John Watson grumbled to himself, his lips tightening into a thin line of anger as he rubbed his sore elbow and discovered the rip in his coat. “Ah! Bloody new jacket, this was!” He shouted the last few words after the couple, who had already vanished from site into the other milling people on the street. Annoyed John, slapped the offending rip and then hissed at the little sting of pain that raced up from the elbow.
Sherlock grimaced at the crude thought. All his life, he had been blinded by the mortal worlds clouded sense of reality. He ran a finger along the red twine, from one of the notes that read the name
"You git. That's not even an ashtray." John snipped, pointing at the disgraced bowl. For emphasis he snatched one of the empty cups and beaned the indignant and ruffled brunet in the head with it.
The man stepped up beside him, and once more the heavy aroma enveloped him. John’s hands were slow to rise and brush away the lingering smoke that drifted on the air like spiderwebs in the forest. He began to walk, pace slow as he moved through the maze. He had no idea where he was going, but that was ok. He drifted from one pathway to the next, his feet almost wanting to float away.
The Pietro Annigonni portrait of a young and beautiful Queen Elizabeth II seemed to mirror his brother, as though conveying his authority and influence in the stance and intense glance of the monarch’s imposing eyes.  She was draped in a dark cloak, less grand than the scarlet hues of the portrait that adorned Mycroft’s spacious uptown office.  There the Queen appeared reposed and pleasantly pleased, the shade of her lips matching the drapes that had been chosen to adorn the large windows, and also the red phone that occupied a corner of the larger desk.  A red phone was close at hand here as well but it was over shadowed by the globe and fan also present, even though it obviously had seen more use.
John wasn't about to let that challenge go unanswered.  Darting across the parlor he jumped on top of his flat mate, wrestling free the pillow he so ardently tried to use in defense. "You can't quit what you didn't start, you sod!" he jeered as he pushed the pillow down on the others face.
There was a chiming like sound then that rang throughout the penthouse, playing a soft pretty melody, similar to a door bell.
Louis lifted the two hundred year old book, still remarkably intact, as if giving a toast, as he spun to face the cherub faced vampire, eternally young, and came to sink into the chair opposite him.  Armand watched his guest lean back, cross his blue jean clad legs, and crack the book open, enamored by the small puff of dust that accompanied the turn of the first couple of pages.  Without lifting his head, the other vampire said simply but earnestly, “Thank you,” as his eyes began to fly across the page with paranormal vigor.
"It won't come to that, Armand. What I need from you is you're trust and your patience." Louis felt a pit in his stomach at the reality of Armand’s statement.
His next thought was selfishly about himself, and his own damned eternity. He would be alone then, having lost everything that mattered to him. This was the insanity that Louis had warned him against so vehemently. John knew that this was the true disadvantage of the new life that had been chosen for him. The vampire’s eyes flashed up at the tri-colored orbs of the detective in response. Yet, he could not bring himself to answer.
Finally, one evening as they sat quietly alongside the hearth, sharing a pot of tea, she asked him, “Who’s John?”
John's mouth and teeth scrapped against his skin, kissing and nipping, the press of those sharp fangs ever present as the man moved slowly lower.  All the while his lips and tongue worked, so did his hands.  One hand held his arms tangled in the knot of his own dress shirt, as the other worked open the front of his trousers with but a flicker of movement—so fast. He was suddenly exposed, his pants pulled down so that his straining cock was freed.  Sherlock could feel his erection pressing hot and ready against the cooler fingers of the immortal that gripped him, those fast hands slowly deliberate, as they began to work up and down his length.
The detective resignedly left the door and made his way back up to the bedrooms above.  He undressed mechanically, still running permutations for the code through his mind, as he crawled under the covers.  Exhausted, maybe, but he was nowhere near finished.  With his eyes closed and his body still he opened the doors of his mind palace, retreating inside to consider everything more.
“Molly!” Sherlock growled at the girl, causing her to laugh. John flushed, trying to hide his face, but getting his hands swatted by Molly.
He was quickly surrounded by wolves, the largest standing directly in front of him, teeth bared and fur standing on end.
The cab ride to the Holmes estate was awkward, Sherlock twitching nervously the whole way. John tried to comfort him, holding his hand and rubbing his thigh softly, but nothing seemed to work.
John pushed open the door to the flat, his stomach in knots. He glanced around, not seeing Sherlock anywhere. He was about to call out when the air filled with static electricity. He turned to see Sherlock flicker into view beside him. His ghostly lover grabbed his waist and pulled him close, leaning down and capturing his lips in a kiss.
“He left his book.” John didn’t bother to hide the misery in his voice. Mycroft climbed onto the counter, setting himself beside The Beast and glancing at the book.
“Well, you are the only idiot that has tried to bind me in the last thousand years. I guess that means it’s just you.” He found himself fighting back hope for the second time.
“Why would you do that?” The voice of Greg Lestrade pulled Mycroft’s attention from the phone before him. “Why tell Mikey that Sherlock is dead?”
Sherlock felt a sense of trepidation as he continued exploring. He fought back the urge to turn and run, pressing towards an intricate set of doors at the end of the long hall. When he reached them, he pushed, trying to swing them open. They barely moved, and the action caused his chest to flare in pain. He whimpered, clutching his hand to his chest and leaning heavily against the door.
“But John, this is a travesty! They completely misspelled my name, and three of the numbers on my contact list aren’t even active anymore!”
Sherlock swallowed thickly and looked up at his lover, who was still writing in his notebook. John glanced up and caught his eyes, licking his lips in that way he knew drove Sherlock crazy and winking.
"Well, hello to you too, Gorgeous." John laughed, making a happy smile pull at Sherlock's lips. He loved hearing John laugh. "We just pulled up."
“I-I don’t know. I’m not used to people not getting freaked out by me. It’s weird.” He sighed and hid his face in his hands. “There’s something there Greg, and I don’t know what the hell to do about it.”
“It’s not a-” The wardrobe cut him off with a loud laugh and a flurry of fabric. He tried to escape, but found the door closed. His clothes were removed, piece by piece, and replaced with a new outfit.
"Did you enjoy her?" John shook his head, and in the fading light, Sherlock thought he saw tears in his boyfriend's eyes. "Why not? She assured me that she was very good at a variety of things-"
"J-John- please- f-fuck me, please-" John silenced the pleas with a firm kiss, adjusting Sherlock's hips slightly and pressing his fingers into his loosened entrance, smiling into the kiss at the whimper that fell from the man beneath him.
John spun him away, pulling him back against his chest and catching his lips in a sweet kiss. Sherlock blushed lightly as he heard the team whistling again. He hid his face in John's neck, laughing along with his boyfriend.
“Shit!” John suddenly leapt to his feet, pushing Sherlock aside and grabbing the rope. He swung around pulled the sail tight, jumping to the end of the boat and propelling the ship forward. “Sherlock, pull that tarp off the side and hit the green button.” Sherlock scrambled to obey, tugging at the tarp, revealing a panel covered with buttons.
The song playing through his headphones reminded him of that. Victor never understood the song, claiming it to be boring and beneath him. Sherlock loved the song, the lyrics never failing to send chills down his spine when he listened to it.
John remembered that look; the look of twisted glee at the thought of pulling another living being apart. He knew he should be panicking, trying to fight and bargain his way free, but he felt nothing but cold emptiness.
Everything shattered, colors fragmenting and splintering like thread being torn. John gasped, feeling his breath being pulled from his lungs as the room trembled, each strand of color vibrating like the strings on a guitar.
Once he was ready, Sherlock spun him back around, grabbing him behind the knees and lifting him off his feet. John squirmed as he felt Sherlock adjusting his position until his knees were hooked over Sherlock’s elbows and the taller man was pressing him back against the wall. There was some shuffling as Sherlock slicked his erection and lined himself up with John’s stretched entrance.
“Bullshit!” John pushed her away, standing up and tugging on his hair. “You’re an Enchantress, don’t tell me you can’t save him. You’re still mad that I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life in a loveless marriage with you!”
“He’s going to wake up.” Molly would tell him, rubbing his back as he mourned over John’s body. Even Geoff would try to talk to him, chattering endlessly about school and such things. Sherlock was starting to like the young man, though he would never tell him. It was too fun to bug him.
They spoke together, it was choppy and probably horrendously butchered, but it was the best they could do. Then Greg dropped the match into the bowl.
The team members that had bullied Sherlock apologized profusely, sending looks John's way that bordered on terrified, and for good reason. John was fully intending on making them pay for hurting Sherlock.
"So, you like watching me play?" Sherlock's cheeks darkened and he glanced at the door to his room, praying the student he was bunking with wouldn't be returning anytime soon.
“Call me Mary. Why are you here Time? Surely you are aware that this young man belongs to me?” Sherlock tensed at her words, John belonged to him. He knew him first, kissed him first.
There was no denying the fact that John was well on his way to developing a crush on Sherlock, and apparently Harry knew about it.
"Can we go home, John? I rather want to finish what we started earlier." John's hands tightened on his hips, pulling him slightly closer.
Since getting his Life Force back, he and Sherlock had spent many days testing his limits against Sherlock’s song, and they discovered that even though Sherlock could manipulate him now, it took a lot of effort on the Siren’s part to get him to do anything he didn’t truly want to do.
"It's fine Love, you need the sleep, and I had homework I had to finish." Sherlock huffed, wriggling as John nipped the skin on his collarbone gently. "You can always stay over if you want. Mum is working tonight-"
“No. Then you would have been trapped in the castle as well, and something tells me you would have made a pretty grumpy microscope.” Sherlock chuckled, unable to deny that statement.
"-for a Parlay. You are required by law to take me to your Captain, with no harm done to my person." The crew laughed, causing the man to blush and fight harder.
Sherlock watched John for a moment, his mind jumping between thoughts faster than he had ever known it to.
“That explains how he is able to see me.” John nodded before reaching for his Cell, dialing a different number than Mike’s. A new face popped up on the screen, one Sherlock wished he hadn’t seen.
So... when I first posted the first chapter of this little book to Wattpad, it was crazy popular and I had an insane amount of requests for a part two... that was like a year ago.... I finally finished the second part for a friend's birthday this month (Feb 2018)
“Gods John, no.” Sherlock shifted, coming closer and kneeling in front of John. The Siren took John’s face in his hands and pressed soft kisses to his face and lips. “You have nothing to apologize for. I went to Moriarty, I gave myself over to him. Neither of us knew he had that blade, he would have killed me anyways. My brother is an idiot, he told you that I had died and then told me the same about you. It was your friend Geoffrey that finally told me the truth.” Sherlock sobbed and John felt his heart break. “Then Michael called and told me that you were- you were going to kill yourself again and I-” John pulled him close and kissed him, crawling onto the Siren’s lap and holding him close. “I-I couldn’t live with myself if- if you-” John shook his head and kissed Sherlock deeply, his chest burning as painfully as it did when Sherlock was stabbed.
"God, you're gorgeous like this Love." John mumbled, pressing wet, sucking kisses against the younger boy's neck. He felt Sherlock start to tremble as he finally freed the boy from his sheet, throwing the fabric onto the floor and moving his lips to mark his chest.
"You think this is fucking funny?" John shoved at the closest boy, sending the entire group back several steps back. "She could file harassment charges against the lot of you, I should fucking file them for her!"
"Run!" He laughed, tugging Sherlock's hand and racing away from the restaurant, the tall dancer in tow.
It didn’t take long before he was spilling between them, Sherlock catching his cry in his own lips with a searing kiss. Sherlock followed behind him not long after, filling John with his mess and pressing in as deep as he could. Sherlock reached up and unhooked John’s wrists, letting their bodies slide to the floor in a sticky, sweaty pile of limbs.
“No!” As the pale man shouted, a blast of electrical energy shot out from him, sending John flying back into the wall. His head connected violently with a small glass window, his vision blurring white.
John keened as he pressed his fingers inside him, one by one, slowly opening him up to accept Sherlock's length. Sherlock teased John, enjoying the sounds that were coming from the shorter man as he sucked and fingered him.
"You shouldn't apologize, in fact, this is quite the feat." John's smile went from boyish to slightly confused and Sherlock blushed, he hadn't intended on voicing that thought out loud, but now that he had started, there was no way he could bail. "I-I mean- normally I wait for the third date before I agree to get into bed with someone." John blinked at him for a moment, and Sherlock instantly regretted speaking. He was about to retract what he said when a bright laugh filled the tiny flat.
They had a natural dynamic, John easily slipping into a slightly less dominant role. It should have felt off, seeing as how he always was the dom when filming, but with Sherlock, it felt right.
“Don’t thank me Mr. Watson. Thank my brother.” The line went dead, and John had to physically stop himself from jumping up and down. He had barely stopped thinking about Sherlock since they had filmed, and now he was going to get to film with him again.
He was kissing Sherlock Holmes. In real life, the real Sherlock Holmes, and he was too stunned to respond.
“It was an accident!” Sherlock snapped, gripping his hair tightly and tugging, fighting against the images that pulled themselves from the dark corners of his mind. “It was an accident, they weren’t supposed to be there. I was practicing my song, trying to move a meteor by manipulating the energies. A Transfer Ship went off course and got too close. The driver was- he heard-” Sherlock’s voice cracked in a sob and he tucked his knees against his chest, still tugging at his hair. “Thirty people were killed when he drove that Ship into the meteor. I was banished from my home, sent to survive among the stars.” Tears fell from Sherlock’s eyes as the faces of the people he had killed flashed through his mind.
John pushed back against him until his knees hit the bed. Sherlock caught the hint and sat, still gripping John's hips so that the shorter boy now stood between his legs.
“You are going to be the death of me John Watson.” He grumbled as he turned to leave. John laughed and grabbed Sherlock’s arm, clinging to it like a sloth clinging to a tree. He loved being able to touch Sherlock without fear of his heart stopping, and he was taking full advantage of it.
He wrapped a hand around Sherlock's erection, feeling the hard flash in his grasp twitch at the contact as the younger man neared his climax.
Out of the top of his head grew intimidating black horns, twisting up and back. They shone in the light, looking deadlier than any weapon he had ever laid eyes on.
"No need to apologize, I get it. You're straight." John felt his heart break at the miserable tone Sherlock's voice had taken on and let himself look at the boy, really look at him, for the first time up close.
They sat in silence for a long while, Sherlock watching in awe as the beast expertly stitched together his wounds.
He lashed out again, breaking another pane of glass with his fists, screaming as he felt the glass tear through his skin.
“So, do you always greet people like that or is it just me?” A vaguely familiar voice cut through the pain that was clouding his mind. He knew that voice. It was older, rougher, but unmistakable. He spun around, taking in the image before him.
“I enjoyed it too.” John couldn’t seem to speak any louder than a whisper, getting lost in the eyes of the taller man. Sherlock smiled and leaned down, capturing John’s lips in a gentle kiss.
“A-are y-you serious?” The Beast grinned, rubbing his hand over the back of his neck, looking sheepish.
John was wavering slightly, his jaw tight with pain as he winked at Sherlock. The cuffs were off his wrist, sending a shock of alarm through Sherlock's body.
“Looks like Mikey’s done. Let’s head back to the compound.” John started to walk away, and Sherlock was gripped with the need to touch him.
"What are you staring at?" There was a blush on Sherlock's cheeks, and he was doing his best to look uncomfortable, but John just grinned wider and closed the gap between them, setting his bags on the ground and gripping Sherlock's hips, tugging the taller boy closer.
"No, Sherlock. You can't. We only have a few weeks before-" John hesitated, fussing with the collar of Sherlock's dress shirt, blinking rapidly at the unspoken words. "I can't have you spending the last three weeks of school in detention, Love." John leaned up, pressing a soft kiss to Sherlock's lips. "Understand, Tiny Dancer? I want to spend every minute humanly possible with you, and I can't do that if you're suspended." Sherlock wanted to argue, to make John understand that he couldn't just stand aside while someone was saying such horribly wrong things about him, but instead he just sighed, resting his forehead against his boyfriend's and nodding.
“How does that work? I mean, you can’t touch or anything, right?” John tried to fight the blush that rose on his cheeks, realizing how miserably he failed when Greg’s eyes widened. “You can touch? How?”
“No one John. This is just me.” Sherlock’s voice was broken, the force of the tremors wracking his body causing his voice to shake.
A small, mousy young woman, not much older than himself, answered, her face splitting into a grin when she saw him.
“I know your name Brenda, you are just fun to tease.” John laughed and spun Sherlock away before Lestrade could hit him.
"You can't do things like that Babe." John pulled him in for a hug, tucking his face against Sherlock's neck and pressing soft kisses against the skin there. "What if he reports you for attacking him? It's not worth it, I'm not-"
"I can think of a few things." Sherlock mumbled, his blush darkening as John grinned dangerously up at him. He could see the mischievous glint in the Rugby capatin's eyes that usually meant he was about to get rogered senseless, and couldn't fight the thrill that traced his spine.
"You were, and have always been my best friend John. I loved you then and I love you now." He leaned down and gently kissed John again, simply a chaste press of the lips that sent John's head reeling. "Please don't make me kill you, John. Please, I couldn't do it." Sherlock kept kissing John softly, the shorter man frozen in shock.
Sherlock was seated on a stretcher, a nurse carefully patching up a nasty gash on his cheek. He had bruises covering his face and arms, the baggy t-shirt he wore while practicing torn along the collar, revealing a new bruise mixed in with the older ones John had left there a few nights ago. He hurried to his boyfriend's side, trying to figure out what had happened.
“Sherlock! There should be a command on the tablet, hit confirm. Now!” Sherlock scrambled to obey, blinking through the tears as his skull felt as though it was being shredded.
John laughed, waving his friends off and blushing, he dropped his head against Sherlock's chest, still chuckling as the boys jumbled the words. Sherlock watched his boyfriend, his mind spinning as he took in the embarrassed joy on the other boy's face.
“There, good to go.” He grabbed his main bag and pulled out his Video Cell and dialed Mike Stamford. The call connected and Mike’s face appeared before them.
Sherlock fled from the flat, John’s voice shaking his mind palace as he ran, hunting for the front door.
“Break it in.” There was silence for a moment before the door came crashing in. Mike stepped in, catching sight of Sherlock and racing over to untie him.
“My little brother died just outside the gates of the Palace.” Rage flooded through Mike and he felt his hands start to shake.
Sherlock came first, staining his t-shirt and nearly ripping John's jumper as he tried to silence his cries. John followed close behind, spilling deep within Sherlock's body as he muffled his own sounds against the taller boy's neck.
"I don't need sex. I need sleep." Sherlock chuckled and curled up to his boyfriend's side, nuzzling against his neck and trying to ignore the nagging feeling still hovering in the back of his mind. "Goodnight Love. We can talk more in the morning, alright?"
The wolf lunged at him, its claws digging into his chest and thighs he was knocked to the ground. He was vaguely aware of someone screaming. The wolf sank its teeth into his shoulder and he felt his vision start to fade to black.
“Pleasure to meet you Sherlock. Dinner is at six, I’ll have Mrs. Hudson bring you a tray.” John finished wrapping Sherlock’s wounds and stood gathering his case and making his way to the door.
John shifted back slightly, running one of his hands along Sherlock's side and tracing the lines of his body, making him twitch and whimper.
“Let him go.” The image of a woman appeared before him, petite, blonde, and pretty. She smiled sadly at him, clasping her hands in front of her and backing away. He followed her, coming to a stop in front of a large glass dome. Under the glass, stood the stem of a rose, blackened petals surrounding it.
“How can I understand you?” John could tell by the shock on the Siren’s face that he hadn’t expected that question. “I know how you saved me. Saw me falling and caught me, hauling me back to my boat. What I don’t get is how I can understand you. This collar is basic, not equipped with a translation matrix, so I shouldn’t be able to understand you.” The Siren grinned dangerously, shifting closer to John.
“Alright, I’m going to have to take your shirt and trousers off to redo the bandages. But first I want to re-set your wrist.” Sherlock had gotten his other arm set once, and it was the most painful thing he had ever gone through. That one had been a minor break, this one had been broken several times over. He shook his head, pulling his arm tight against his chest. The Beast rolled his eyes, grabbing Sherlock’s broken wrist and pulling it closer to him. Sherlock whimpered, fear filling him as he started to tremble. “This is going to hurt, but I need you to fight through the pain and don’t pass out.”
Suddenly, the pain stopped. Everything disappeared, leaving Sherlock alone in the emptiness that had taken over his mind when his heart stopped.
“Please stop him.” Mikey’s voice sounded broken and John felt a flare of anger. No deity his friend could pray to could change his mind.
"At the moment, not particularly." Sherlock glared up at the ceiling, silently cursing himself for ever talking to Lestrade. He had tried to erase the thought, cleanse his mind palace of it, but he couldn't. That nasty voice in the back of his mind, the one that reminded him of every failure, kept repeating the words, trying to make them real.
"Next on the stage, Sherlock Holmes, dancing to 'Mad World' by Gary Jules." Sherlock took a steadying breath and made his way on stage, the knowledge that John was so far away adding to the emotion of his performance.
Sherlock ran through the familiar halls of his mind palace, throwing open doors and calling for John. He had to find a way out. He ground to a stop just in time to watch the floor before him crumble away.
“No! I’m fine-” Sherlock’s eyes rolled back into his head and he fell into John’s arms, nearly knocking the shorter man over.
.” Sherlock whispered, smiling softly at the confusion that crossed John’s face. “It means My Love in Old Latin.”
When the fabric stopped moving, he was spun around to face a floor-length mirror. He was stunned into silence.
“Mycroft Holmes.” John inadvertently straightened in his seat, fighting back a blush. Something about the older Holmes sibling made him incredible uncomfortable.
“Because you don’t mean it.” Sherlock sobbed at those words, pressing his face against the crook of John’s neck and clutching at the shorter man’s shirt. “Don’t say it if you don’t mean it Sherlock. I won’t do that to you.”
