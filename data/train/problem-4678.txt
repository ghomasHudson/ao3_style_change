Dean pulled Cas towards him by pulling the waistband of his blue jeans.  He kissed him hard on the mouth and whispered, “You are my number one everything; just don’t tell Baby.”  His lover winked at Cas before opening the passenger door for him.
“Hey boss man, did the missus finally fall asleep?”  Dean’s assistant was painting the portrait he had started of Sam wearing the kilt.  It was actually the Scotsman’s actual height of 6’4.  Gabe needed to climb on a small ladder to paint the upper portion.
After two months of being on location, Dean ordered Gabriel to go to Wyoming, where Sam was assisting Cas in running the ranch.  Since the former bodyguard only had weekends off, he needed all the help he could get running the place. Gabe had been moping twenty four/seven and had gotten on Dean’s last nerves.  He could not blame the poor sap.  He himself missed Castiel terribly and every night fought himself from going to the movie’s producer and telling him he was resigning.  All he wanted was to be with Castiel.  He missed his body’s warmth and sandalwood scent at night, when he laid in bed by himself.
Impala eventually got up on her sternum and a couple of minutes later rose on four wobbly hooves.  Morning Star experienced one more contraction as she expelled her placenta.  Jo placed plenty of fresh hay next to her.  Morning Star lied down for a while before she started munching on the hay.
Castiel woke up groggily from a drugged state due to the ominous sound of waves crashing against wood.  He wearily opened one of his cerulean eyes to discover foggy vision.  He licked his chapped lips and swallowed nervously.  His mouth tasted like led.  When he tried to sit, he instantly became dizzy.  As he took in his surroundings, Castiel soon realized he was being held prisoner in the abandoned dilapidated shack people used for fishing at the lake.  The bodyguard’s hands were completely numb due to the thick rope which bound them behind his back. They were seriously cutting off his circulation.
Gabriel shoved her gently on the shoulder.  “I bet you an entire case of Blow Pops you have no fucking idea where the humerus is, Madame Curie.”
The actor was unaware that Cas had also taken an appreciative visual inventory of him, as well.  Castiel knew he could not break the main rule and not feel anything towards Dean Winchester.  Gabe put on a black Armani jacket over his red shirt.  “There is no way in hell I am allowing you to go anywhere with wet crazy hair.”  He grabbed Castiel’s hand and led him into the bathroom.
Castiel rubbed the back of his neck.  “I don’t know if that is a good idea…I need to be protecting Dean and should not have any distractions.”
Dean smirked confusing his deranged brother.  “You will not have a chance, you sadistic bastard.”  Adam was about to ask Dean what the hell he was babbling about, but one of the rifle’s bullets lanced through his spine.  The giant Scot fell dead over Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes and remained silent as a tomb.  He would never admit to anyone but when he witnessed Castiel grabbing Max’s ass, he wanted to run to them, bang a bottle against the smug actor’s head, throw Cas over his shoulder and get the hell out of the Rumba Café.  Seriously, he had been hanging around Gabe too long.  Maybe he needed to socialize more with Chuck and Ash.  They could hit strip clubs and catch NFL games.
Dean frowned as soon as he heard Gabe’s reply.  When Gabriel had basically pronounced them married, Dean was elated.  Of course he was not going to illustrate his emotions externally.  Especially, when Cas was acting like a crazed chicken that could not lay an egg.  Would it be so terrible to be married to him?
“It’s time for gifts.  I know it is early in the day and all but tonight we will be too busy pigging out on turkey and all the yummy side dishes.”
The following afternoon, Castiel had spoken to his mother, who informed him, his best friend from high school, Inias was getting married.  Rachel went on to tell her son he had been invited to the wedding which was being held during Thanksgiving weekend in their hometown.  Cas felt bad because he had lost touch with Inias after college.
They escorted Sam to the back of a patrol car.  He had to duck his head because the cop shoved him in hard.   Upon hearing the words come out of the detective, Sam knew exactly, who was behind all of the attempts against Dean’s life.  As soon as he got to the police station, he would tell the interrogating officers the truth.
Once Dean’s emerald eyes stared into his, Castiel continued.  “I love you, Dean Winchester, only you.  I know I have never told you but in how many ways can I show you?  You mean everything to me.  I need you more than the air I breathe.  I can’t live without you, you idiot.”
Dean held his hands.  He bit his lower lip.  “That is what I wanted to talk to you about.  I’ve been doing a lot of thinking the last couple of months and came up with something.  I will shoot one movie per year.”
Gabriel reluctantly removed the tangy and sweet confection from his mouth.  “You can’t be this dumb, Deano.”
“Please jot down Crowley’s number and call him right away.  He will be able to provide the evidence of Adam being my twin.  Besides the birth certificate, there are our baptismal records, as well as family pictures.”
The officers dragged him into the interrogation room.  “Yeah right, dumb ass!  You were caught with your hands in the cookie jar!”  Dean bellowed before the group disappeared inside the room.
She smiled shyly at the actor.  “Oh my God, I can’t believe Cassie Bear went and married a bona-fide movie star.  It is a pleasure to meet you.”
Castiel chuckled and blushed. Dean felt like throwing up his lunch. He was saved by Gabe and Sam, who chose that precise moment to woke up.  They ate the remaining snacks and drank bottled water.  “You will never embarrass me like that in public, Gabe!  How dare you get high and act like the Lone Ranger while you rode your beloved, Silver, over there.”
Twenty minutes later, the couple joined the others in the dining room.  This was one of the best birthdays Castiel ever had.  The only person missing which would have made it absolutely perfect was his old man.  Gabriel caught the birthday boy’s attention.  “Earth to Castiel; can you hear me?”
The three of them managed to disentangle Gabe from Sam, who had assumed a Mr. Ed persona.  “You guys suck!”  Gabriel screamed as Dean and Max dragged him kicking to the picnic blanket.
“Dean, I am not even going to ask how you know the name of that movie.”  Cas stated in a teasing manner.
Castiel was already on his way out of the bedroom.  “There is no fucking way I am letting you leave this room until we settle a few things!”  Dean spun his bodyguard around to face him.  His hands held on tightly to Cas’ upper arms.
Gabe winked at Castiel.  The bodyguard could not believe he had initiated the grope fest.  Plus, he was still shocked Dean had kissed him back.  Things were getting out of control.  He knew what had to be done now.
The shorter man wiggled his eyebrows.  “Open it up, Sammy.”  The giant Scotsman did as told.  Castiel cracked up and winced in pain.
“It has been a shitty day so I needed an outlet to vent out my frustration.”  Cas continued pummeling the bag.
Dean’s defeated gaze landed on Castiel’s eyes, which were telling him everything would be alright.  The actor started to sign his name, but the pen’s blue ink ran dry.  Adam aimed the barrel of the rifle straight to Castiel’s heart.  Adam scooted closer to his brother to check on the pen.  Castiel arched his right leg and brought the heel up to Adam’s inner knee.  Dean abruptly turned around as a lethal panther and pushed his hand forward smashing the bridge of his deranged brother’s nose.
“It’s a good thing I did because if not I would have remained in the dark.”  He zipped his duffel bag.
Cas loathed being away from Dean on January 24, which happened to be the blond man’s birthday.  He sang his hubby Happy Birthday via web cam.  Dean had pleasantly surprised him by informing him he started attending therapy once a week on his day off.  He was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder courtesy of his deceased psycho brother.  Castiel experienced a huge wave of relief once his husband told him that he was getting professional help.
Dean accepted the glass and aspirins from his assistant.  “Thanks for everything dude.  I mean it.”  He caught Gabe off guard and enveloped the smaller man in a bear hug.
“I was about to kick the door in, Dean.  What the hell were you doing in there for so long?”  As Dean was about to enter, three short Japanese businessmen pushed him aside and entered the bathroom.
Gabe patted him on the back three times.  Once Dean was alright, Gabriel found the source of his boss’ bad temper.  “Oh shit, Cas has been Fassbindered!”
Dean had just about had it.  He was tired of hearing about Castiel’s and Anna’s glory days at Sycamore High School.  They seemed to have been the golden couple of their graduating class.  An hour which had felt like three finally passed.  Dean had drunk the entire content of one bottle.  Gabriel had discreetly told Sam to take the remaining bottle to the kitchen.
“Yeah, maybe” Yuriko composed herself, unlocked the door and exited the bathroom.  Her eyes landed on the handsome dark haired man, who always stood or sat next to the actor.  She wondered if he was the reason Dean did not have sex with her.  She glared daggers at Cas, as she walked by him.   Castiel was flabbergasted upon seeing how fast the bimbo left the bathroom.
Later that afternoon, Castiel was venting his frustrations out on a punching bag Dean had in the rec- room.  His research on the cartridge only came up with it being manufactured in Finland and it was used in the Afghan and Iraqi Wars.  He was convinced the killer was a war vet.  He gave a round kick to the defenseless punching bag as Dean entered.  “What did the poor bag ever do to you?”
“Be thankful, I did not press any charges,” the pub manager told the two of them.  Gabriel was able to fish out the Impala’s keys from within Dean’s black jeans.  “If he thinks I am going to crawl back in there and ask for forgiveness, he is fucking wrong.  Now he can spend the night with Fasswanker!  They can live happily ever after.”
“I am seething at the moment and don’t want to hurt you.  Your body is still healing from the accident.”
Once Dean was done, Cas handed him the mug of tea with two aspirins.  “Drink this baby; it will help you.”
“Oh and there is no way I am allowing you to be shadowing me dressed like Colombo.  You can wear one of your favorite dark suits for the press conference but something hip for the premiere.  If you don’t mind I gave Gabe your measurements for clothes and shoes.”
Dean wanted to find out once and for all why Adam had such a hard on in killing him.  “So why you don’t tell us the fucking truth, man? You want to kill me out of jealousy cos our parents gave the two of you away and kept me?”
Gabriel made a gagging sound.  “Seriously, Dean; get over it.  Hey kiddo.  I’m Gabriel, your bro in law’s assistant and this tall and delicious Scottish drink is my boyfriend and Deano’s brother, Sam.”
Adam gave Dean a hard blow to the knee and he remained on the floor.   The Scotsman knelt down next to him.  “Perhaps I will force your lover to blow me in front of you before I kill him.”
Castiel was in the back of a taxi being driven home.  He was thinking of instructing the Jamaican driver to drive him to the closest hotel but changed his mind, when he read Dean’s text.  At least he was the first one to extend the olive branch.  He smiled as he texted:  “I apologize, too.  You know you are everything to me.”
Castiel and Gabriel engaged in small talk as the mischievous assistant waited five minutes to cover the burn with a new bandage.  “I have been taking sushi prep courses online and registered for a full day course when we get to Tokyo.  So you guys will have to suffer without my sparkling presence for a day and a half.”
Her pale cheeks turned crimson.  Dean could have sworn the red head was staring at Castiel adoringly.  “Why don’t the three of you go to the living room?  These three gentlemen are going to help me wash the dishes,” Rachel suggested.
An ecstatic Gabriel had dragged Dean and Cas to the local Barnes and Noble, which was having a sale on romance novels.  The actor groaned as Gabe stood in the bodice ripper section and fetched some books with cheesy covers on them.  He handed a pile to Dean, who rapidly passed them to Castiel.
“Could it be that he discovered the birth certificates and envies the life you have?  Maybe he hates you because your birth parents did not give you away?  Who knows what the hell goes on in a psychopath’s mind?”  Castiel said as be pinched the bridge of his nose.
The handsome actor actually frowned upon hearing those words.  “No need to apologize, man.  Thanks for you know…protecting me and all that shit.”
Once Dean is done, he passed it to Castiel.  Cas as usual is a quick study and Gabriel does not need to instruct him.  He performed his part of the ceremony rapidly and returned the bowl to Gabe.  Gabriel cleaned the utensils and turned to his friends.
Six hours later the alarm clock started buzzing.  Sam and Gabe shared an emotional good-bye.  They would meet up the next time Dean had business in Europe.  It took the Americans an hour to shower, dress and eat a quick breakfast.  Miraculously, most of their possessions including passports had been spared in the fire.
The waiter returned with the ordered food.  He placed all the trays and dishes quickly around the table.  Tensions were high in the private room.  Even the nude model was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to leave.  By the look of things she was not going to screw Dean Winchester this evening; too bad because the man was so damn hot.
“You are under arrest for the attempted murders of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak.  If it were up to me, you will rot in prison for injuring all those innocent lives with that explosion.”
Castiel rolled his cerulean eyes every time he saw her sauntering over to Dean.   The bimbo was so obvious in her attempts at propositioning him.  The bodyguard gritted his teeth as she placed one of her manicured hands on Winchester’s shoulder.  Her boobs almost smacked against Dean’s face.  The actor grinned at her.  “Sweetheart, can you please go check if the karaoke box is ready?”  Dean asked as he winked at her.
Dean was loyal to the soap opera but knew if he re-signed with it; he would always regret not accepting the movie role.  He signed on for the action hero part and received a hefty paycheck of two million dollars.  Michael Bay directed the movie and the man was a tyrant on set, when it came to getting down to business.  However, off the set he was a great friend to have and offered Dean great advice.
Jimmy cackled diabolically.  “Chill out, man.  I’ve had my license for a week.  I know what I am doing.”
Cas held Dean’s right hand.  “Can’t you see the killer is much closer to us?  I can’t shake this feeling that if I return to the scene of the crime, I will find crucial evidence.”
“Your Uncle Raphael, and he has been doing a pretty decent job.  With the ranch’s lucrative profits he has enough money to pay for taxes, the animals’ veterinary expenses and the staff.”
Ten years ago, a twenty three year old Dean Winchester hopped on a Greyhound bus from Lawrence, Kansas to Los Angeles.   As a child he bounced from one foster home to another but he remained in the same schools.  He had fallen in love with acting in his freshman year of high school, where he played the part of Nathan Detroit in Guys & Dolls.
“Thanks mate.  The two of us have wanted some time on our own.”  Dean noticed Sam’s Scottish brogue was thicker than usual this evening.
Samuel had followed his brother to a nearby park.  He caught his breath as he stood next to an oak tree.  All of a sudden, a military knife landed about two inches from him on the tree.  Sam was alert once again.  Adam must be closer than he thought.
“OMG!   This is a good sign!  I prayed for the Angel of Thursday to save Dean after he was hit by the psycho SUV driver.  You are named after him, am I right?”
Eight hours later, the trio was at Pam’s house.  She was away on a business trip and told them to stay there until the movie’s Japanese premiere the following week.  Dean had to be in attendance.  Dean had finished unpacking and was famished.  He headed to the kitchen.  The actor froze on his tracks when he saw Castiel standing by the kitchen’s island.  He did not know how to approach his bodyguard.  After the hot make out session, the two of them had not said a peep.
Half an hour later, an unkempt looking Sam was escorted by the head detective to the precinct’s information booth.  Gabriel ran towards him and wrapped his legs around his lover’s waist.  He kissed him hard on the mouth as his arms encircled his neck.  “Sammy, I knew you were innocent!”
The kid smiled revealing a couple of missing front teeth.  The two of them started flying the kite once the breeze picked up a bit.  Castiel grinned as he witnessed how caring Dean was always around little ones.  He went back to the blanket where Max was dozing off.  Cas sat adjacent to him and placed the slumbering actor’s head on his lap.  He played with his short brown locks.
Gabriel rode in the ambulance with a bloodied, unconscious Dean as it raced from the site of the terrifying accident to Wilshire Boulevard, where Good Samaritan Hospital was located at.   Gabe had been raised Catholic and even though he had not set foot in a church since his confirmation; he prayed to the Angel of Thursday since the crazy SUV driver almost killed his boss on said day.  No one, not even the cab driver, who was to drive them home, had been able to catch a glimpse of the mysterious vehicle’s tag.  Gabriel panicked since he witnessed Dean fly several feet in the air before crash landing on the hard sidewalk.
The three men checked into the Hotel Plaza Athenee, which was located on the prestigious Avenue Montaigne and close to the Eiffel Tower.  Dean got turned on listening to Castiel speak fluent French with the concierge.  The man was full of surprises.  Pam had omitted informing them she had only been able to book a two bedroom suite.  Gabriel snored but Dean preferred to share his suite with his assistant than with Castiel.  At least with his short friend, he would not be tempted to do anything.
“Dean did not have any candles on and it seems no electric appliances short circuited.  The firefighters stated the fire was caused on purpose.”
Dean brushed his teeth ferociously.   Afterwards, he pissed and washed his hands before heading to bed.  He became furious as he lied in bed with his hands folded behind his head.  Whenever he closed his damn eyes Dean would picture Cas’ buff glistening nude form.  OK I am so not gay!  Oh hell no!  The actor was horrified to be sporting wood.
As soon as they settled into a two bedroom suite, which smelled like cherry blossoms, Gabriel said good bye to his two friends.  “Deano, your clothes for the press conference, premiere and karaoke party are all sorted out in your bedroom.  I also asked the staff to stock your mini fridge with a couple of beers and your favorite snacks.”
Gabriel smirked.  “Oh just sushi prep; see you guys tomorrow evening.  Do not make any plans!  I have something special arranged for the three of us.”   He blew a kiss at them and exited the suite.
The bodyguard gulped nervously.  Castiel composed himself.  He needed to appear as cool as a cucumber.  He stood by a stool waiting to see what his employer came up with.  “Let’s see what your supposed theory is then, Einstein.”
Gabriel remained in the guest suite the remainder of the afternoon and evening.  He had prepared a garden salad and tuna casserole for the guys.  For dessert he had made one of Dean’s favorites, cherry pie.   Dinner was uncomfortable to say the least between Dean and Castiel.
Once they had secured a room with two full size beds in it; Gabriel asked Dean if they were safe strolling around Milan on their own.  “Let’s take a shower, eat something and then return to the hospital.  At least there, Cookoo for Cocoa Puffs will not try anything since it’s a public place.”
Meanwhile, Gabe and Sam had finished showering together.   After making love for the second time that evening, the two lovers laid on the pull out bed in Sam’s small room.  Gabriel played with Samuel’s long chocolate colored hair.  “Sammy, what are your plans after you complete filming tomorrow?”
Dean tried placing a hand on his lover’s tense shoulder but the other man shrugged it off and headed to their bedroom.  Another door was slammed.  “I take it Kevin Costner over there did not like what the judge had to say at Adam’s arraignment hearing?”
“Shut the fuck up, Gabe!  Castiel, why didn’t you tell Fassbinder to not stand so close to you while you played, huh?  He was practically fucking you in front of everyone!”
The Sasquatch chuckled.  “Thanks again and I love you.”  He wiped a tear from the corner of one eye.
“Why are you laughing maniacally, Dean?  I am serious,” Cas stated as he handed Dean the sealed envelope.  Dean did not reach out for it, so Castiel placed it on the countertop.
“What the fuck, Cas?  How long did you know that Rosemary’s Baby here had escaped?  You should have clued me in on things since I happened to be number one on his hit list!”
“Singer informed me since I accepted the job offer that Sheriff Watkins will retire next January.  So that’s, when I will officially become sheriff.  This means I will remain in Wyoming for quite some time.  I hope you are not mad.”
A couple of the annoying paparazzi had been following them since they left the hotel.  They were not allowed access to the warehouse, where the photo shoot would take place.  Dean noticed the Lancôme executive treated him in the same manner as he had yesterday.   The same went for the staff.  Castiel felt a huge surge of relief upon seeing that, as well.  He had been nervous as hell, when they set foot in the warehouse.
Once the three men were settled in comfortably in the warm cocoon provided by a comforter, Gabriel kissed Dean and then Castiel on the forehead.  “Goodnight, mom and dad”
After that the acting bug bit him really hard on the ass and he joined the school’s drama club.  He knew if he remained in the small town he would never make it as an actor.  It took him five years to save enough money to leave his hometown and have enough money to sustain him until he found decent employment.  Dean worked at Starbucks and later as a waiter at Spago’s.  During his days off he would go on dozens of auditions.  His first real job was as an extra in an Old Navy spot in which he only wore cargo shorts in a summer themed commercial.
Castiel felt a lot of pent up emotion being emitted from Dean.  He loathed putting the guy through this.  It must have been extremely difficult for the actor to finally admit he was attracted to men and worse that he might feel something towards the first man he was sexually attracted to.  But in the current predicament Cas found himself in, he could not afford to have his charge fall in love with him.
Castiel tried turning on the living room’s lights to no avail.  He scanned the area and noticed the stereo system’s alarm clock was off.  When he walked next to the sofa, he immediately noticed a large lump.  He approached it cautiously and saw Gabriel lying there.  He felt for his pulse and thankfully he was alright.  Cas shook the man and did not get a response.  The bodyguard gulped nervously and ran to Dean’s bedroom.
Gabe thought his boss was one of the hottest men in the world with his dirty blond locks, which he always sported really short, golden skin, hazel eyes, which tended to be emerald most of the time, and tall muscular build.  The man was hot but had a huge heart and that made him more beautiful than he already was.  Gabriel took his job seriously so he would play around with Dean but never crossed the line.
Gabe removed the Blow Pop from his mouth and cracked up; falling on the floor in the process.  “OK, let’s get this straight.  This is not Muppet Babies and I certainly am not Baby Kermit.  So please have the courtesy of not bull shitting me!”
Meanwhile, Castiel finished an important phone conversation, when Dean entered the rec room.  A beaming smile adorned his face when he hung up.  “It seems like you have received wonderful news just like me, babe.”
“Yes,” Sam’s skin crawled.  The pixy looking make-up artist ceased applying the fake blood and stepped away from the men.
“Hi, is Dean in?  He invited me over for some fun.”  She retrieved a bottle of Petron Silver from her large imitation Coach purse.  Castiel’s brows rose as he witnessed this.  Where the hell did Winchester meet this floozy?
The law enforcement official handed Castiel a manila folder.  “Please sit down” He gestured for the Americans to take their seats. The bodyguard opened it and the first thing he noticed was a picture of Adam in uniform.  He passed it to Dean and Gabriel.  “Motherfucker is an exact replica of his brother.”
Castiel introduced Rachel to his two friends and left Dean for last.  She shook hands with Gabe and Sam but when she approached her son in law; Mrs. Novak hugged him tight.  Rachel whispered in his ear, “Thank you for loving my baby.”
Once his hearing started returning to normal, Dean tried shrugging Cas from him.  “Baby, you can let go now.”  In a matter of seconds, the street was filled with pandemonium as people ran away from the explosion like headless chickens.  Sirens of approaching emergency vehicles and police approached the scene of the crime.
Dean cleared his throat.  Castiel handed him an envelope.  His charge smirked.  “Is this a love note?”
Sam rowed the boat as Gabe sang “Don’t Rain on my Parade”.   Dean chuckled and when he turned around his smile turned into a frown.  Castiel was in the process of removing Fassbinder’s shirt.  The bodyguard’s cerulean eyes raked the actor’s newly exposed torso.
“My adoptive parents could not have children and the Winchesters dilemma came as a God send to them.  They paid for all of Mary’s medical expenses and after Samuel and I were born, they signed the adoption papers and we became their legal sons.”
Fassbinder remained quiet and stared at Castiel.  “What, you need to ask your boyfriend for permission?”  Max glared at the cocky American.
The spread was kind of girly for Dean’s taste but he decided to stay quiet about it.  Fassbinder opened a bottle of red wine and poured it into five glasses.  Gabriel and Sam cut pears and apples in slices.  Castiel opened the containers of the duck pate, green olive tapenade and cheese cubes.  Dean cut French and olive breads to prepare savory ham and brie cheese sandwiches.
Crowley rolled his light brown eyes.  The detective could not help himself in comparing the Scotsman to a well-dressed toad.  Uncle Crowley retrieved a picture album and a faded manila envelope, which smelled like mothballs from his satchel.  “Here you go lad; Adam’s and Samuel’s birth and baptism certificates.  I also brought my late sister’s family album.”  Crowley’s eyes became watery.  Ellen had always been his favorite sister.  When she lost her courageous battle to breast cancer, he lost a part of himself.  He promised to keep an eye on her boys, when she was on her deathbed and look at the shitty job he had done.  Sam had turned out to be a great man but Adam was a completely different story.  Ever since Ellen became ill, the boy became bitter and lashed out at the world.
Dean gently wiped a tear from Castiel’s face.  “God that was a lot of shit for a kid to go through in such a short period of time”
Dean nodded.  Gabriel flew out of his chair almost causing it to fall in the process.  He hugged Dean and kissed his cheek.  “Now, we truly are family!”
“Not many people know the meaning of my name but yes, my mother teaches religious theology at the local college from where I am from.  She even named my teenage brother James after the dude from the Bible.”
This is the first and last time I ever do any type of drug.”  Gabriel resembled a little boy, who was being reprimanded by his father.
An hour later after the two of them made love in bed and took a shower.  Gabriel led a blindfolded Sam into their room.  “I hope you like the surprise.”  He removed the silk handkerchief from his boyfriend’s eyes.  Sam gasped.
Dean changed their positions and while still holding on to Cas, he threw all the dinnerware to the floor.  He lied on the table and Castiel straddled him.  “This is my all-time favorite dessert,” Cas murmured right before going down on his lover.
Dean’s soft snoring was the only sound heard in the bedroom.  Adam stared at his youngest sibling.  He fisted his hands at his side.  Oh how he loathed the little bastard.  His parents did not toss him aside like a dirty nappy, when he was born.  He went on to live a great life and found someone, even though it was a man; while he and Samuel’s adoptive father was abusive to them and their mother died of cancer, when they were adolescents.  Crowley always doted on Samuel.  He had always felt like he did not belong anywhere and no one gave a shit about him.  Dean Winchester on the other hand was living the life of a prince.
“My agent actually got me a commercial for an energy drink, which starts shooting next week.  After that I was thinking about joining you in LA.  That is if you will have me?”
Dean gazed at him one last time before crawling out of the bedroom.  Castiel felt a lancing pain go across the middle of his back.  He already felt the flames licking at his exposed skin.  He got on the floor and crawled his way through the smoke filled room.  His throat felt extremely dry and his eyes burned like crazy.
It was mid-October and the wannabe psycho killer had not made any attempts against Dean’s life.  Things had calmed down on the home front, as well.  Bang You’re Dead had already grossed $600,000,000 worldwide.  Dean was debating whether to take the lead role in an upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie or a pivotal secondary part in Spielberg’s upcoming project.
“I will personally make sure the fucker is out of our lives forever this time.”  Castiel said as he left the kitchen.
Sam smiled for the first time since he had been arrested.  “Thanks for not giving up on me, my heart.”  Gabe still remained wrapped around him resembling a chimp hanging from a tree.  Sam’s hazel eyes landed on his Uncle Crowley, who stood beside the information booth with his arms crossed at his chest.
Samuel wasted no time in asking Dean about his birth parents.  The younger sibling by four years answered as much as he could.  His parents had perished in a car wreck, when he was four years old; so he really did not have a trunkful of memories to begin with.
It took Dean about three minutes to vacate his chamber and join them in the living room area.  “We are in fucking Paris, France, you guys!  Let’s take in the attractions and scenery.  We don’t leave for LA until tomorrow afternoon.”
The two men headed to the dance floor.  A fast moving mambo song was being played by the band. Dean was shocked to see Castiel was a pro on the dance floor.  His feet and hips were moving to the infectious beat of the music.  His grin turned into a frown as Fassbinder danced closer to Cas and their bodies were only about an inch away from each other.  Dean hated the smug look on the other actor’s face as he placed one of his hands on Castiel’s shoulder.  Of course, Castiel, the smitten teeny bopper smiled at his idol.
Max and Castiel chuckled as the two men remained lip locked for quite some time.  Dean coughed.  “One of you is going to need fresh air soon.  I refuse to administer CPR to either of you!”
Pam smacked the back of his head.  “Can you please speak in simple terms, doctor?  My friend here dropped out of school in the tenth grade.”
He guessed his ten minutes were up because Castiel started knocking outside the bathroom’s door again.  “Dean, you are worrying me and there is a line forming out here!”
The two minutes it took him to exit the suite felt like an eternity in Hell.  When he finally made his way out, two firefighters were already heading towards the suite.  An EMT was assisting Dean into the elevator.  The door was about to close, when Dean’s red rimmed emerald eyes clashed with his.  “Hold the door!”  He bellowed to the EMT.
One of the Italian officers informed them he would pay a quick visit to Judge Palermo in order to obtain an arrest warrant for Samuel Maclachlan.  The brawny officer of the law took with him the cd, which showcased all the evidence they needed for the warrant to be signed by the judge.
“Are you serious?  She kissed me!  I did not initiate the kiss.  Wait a minute…where you spying on us?”
“That’s great, my angel.  I haven’t seen you in so long.  You know I always worry about your safety.”
Gabriel had decided to tell the hospital’s head of security about Dean’s case.  The rotund man ordered one of the night guard’s to keep sentry outside of Castiel’s room.  That way
“You should be as enraged as I am!  What is wrong with you?”  Castiel screamed at him.  The bodyguard was perplexed at the actor’s bizarre behavior.  Why wasn’t he assisting him in choking Gabe to death?
Dean’s hand covered Castiel’s.  “I know babe but now I will have to continue sleeping with one eye open.  I don’t worry about myself but you, as well.”
“Yo, Deano; quit it will ya!  If I would have known you were going to be imitating a food processor tonight, I would have stayed over at Sam’s hotel.”
Neither Pam nor Gabe wanted to leave Dean alone in the hospital but the doctor had just told them he would be in La La Land for several hours.  Pam had to make a short statement to a small group of reporters, who had already camped outside of the hospital.  Less than half an hour after the accident, TMZ had already reported the news in their website.
An hour later, Dean knocked on the rec room’s door.  “When the two of you are done doing whatever it is you are doing in there; Sam owes me a Halo 2 rematch.”
As Mister Bush continued boring half of the crowd with his unrehearsed speech in his annoying nasal Texan twang, Secret Service Agent Castiel Novak rolled his ocean blue eyes.  He was sweating like a pig being led to a slaughterhouse for execution underneath his work uniform which consisted of a typical Men in Black suit.  Dark Ray Ban aviator glasses covered his beautiful baby blues and they were a gift from Heaven, because they blocked anyone from witnessing every time he rolled his eyes at good old George W’s plethora of faux pas.
Four hours later, Gabe texted both of them to meet him in the hotel’s seventh floor ASAP.  When they exited the elevator, the two men noticed a geisha standing by a small bamboo table.  She was giving them her back; arranging some clothes in the process.  Dean inhaled deeply the scent of lotus and cherry blossoms, which were everywhere in the makeshift garden.  “Excuse me, miss, our friend is meeting us here.”
Castiel unzipped the damn jacket and removed himself from it.  Forty five seconds were left for the explosive to go off.  Dean pulled him from underneath the SUV.  The two of them ran across the street and yelled for everyone to get down.  Castiel instinctively covered Dean’s body with his.  The SUV exploded causing the entire block to tremble.
Dean gulped nervously as soon as his bodyguard entered the bedroom.  Castiel wore a dark blue Christian Dior three piece suit with a grey dress shirt and a sky blue tie, which complimented his gorgeous eyes.  His hair was wet.  The man was fucking sexy.  Damn it!  Here I go again drooling after my bodyguard.
“That is not fair, sir!  I have personally seen an agent or two fuck up and they were never reprimanded for their mistakes.  I am being demoted because I am the rookie in the group, who does not play to the old boys club’s politics!”
Castiel sat next to Dean.  The actor placed his head on Cas’ lap.  “I am going to bring you a couple of aspirins for the pain.”
“Did you keep your uniform?  Maybe we can recreate the ending of An Officer and a Gentleman.”  Gabe suggested as he wiggled his eyebrows.  Dean made a gagging sound as he exited the rec room.
Castiel chuckled.  “Don’t tell me you are going to use Sam as a model to create your own romance novel cover art.”
Dean’s forest green eyes almost popped out of their sockets when they landed on Gabe, who happened to be listening to 50 Cent’s “Peep Show” and dancing his butt off.   His assistant donned cut off jean shorts and a black t-shirt which had an “I” followed by a read heart and the silhouette of a rooster/cock in the front.  “Your hangover remedy is in the fridge, boss man.”
Samuel told her to remain sitting down since he and Gabriel would clear the table and wash the dishes.  Rachel thanked them.  “I guess now is the perfect time to give you your gift.”
Gabe opened one amber eye.  “I don’t want to get up…too comfortable.”  The short man had the audacity to hold on tighter to Castiel’s waist.  The dark haired man finally woke up.  Foreign arms were wrapped around his torso.  He swiftly removed them.  Dean was already in the process of yanking his lazy assistant from the bed.
Later that night, after they fooled around for a while, Dean and Cas lied in bed.  The actor’s head rested on his bodyguard’s chest.  Castiel stroked Dean’s short hair.   The latter’s eyes were closed and he was falling asleep.  Before the Sandman claimed him, Dean whispered, “I love you, Castiel.”   Cas kissed the top of his head gently.
Cas had brought with him a sketch pad and drew the nature scenes which surrounded them.  Max read from a Yeats book of poetry. Dean growled and rolled his emerald eyes as he heard Fassbinder recite poetry to Cas.  The smug bastard was a smooth operator he admitted to himself.  Castiel had stopped drawing and gazed at the other man.  He dropped the sketch pad and drawing stencil on the blanket.
“Ignore it, baby.  I need you right now.  Whoever it is, they can fucking wait.”  Dean continued gently biting his lover’s neck.
Dean had never seen Castiel this happy.  All off a sudden, a car horn was heard.  Dean was the one, who turned red now.  “That must be your gift from me now, babe.”
Gabriel, who had finally ceased dancing said, “Sweet, so you are bi!  I knew there was a reason why I automatically liked you, Cas.”  Dean remained standing where he was with his mouth hung open.  When he realized he probably resembled a trout gasping for air, he shut it closed.
All of a sudden, Dean’s body covered his.  They kissed.  Dean was in the process of getting up, when he fell down next to him.  His eyes were closed.  Castiel frantically shook him.  “Dean, what’s wrong?!”
Fassbinder waited until Castiel closed the suite’s door and started taking off his sodden clothes, shoes and socks.  Cas did the same.  The two drenched men strolled to the bathroom and slid off their wet boxer briefs.  Max was the first to enter the marble tiled shower stall.  He set the water to come out warm.  He offered his hand to Castiel.  The bodyguard entered and closed the sliding glass door.
That evening the three Americans had an early dinner and went back to the hotel.  Fortunately, the paparazzi were no longer buzzing outside the hotel.  Pam must have worked her magic and conjured something up with the press and the agency, which represented Dean.
Dean noticed Castiel’s inquisitive face as he stared at the city’s scenic wonders through one of the balcony windows.   “Tomorrow afternoon we will attend the movie’s first European press conference, which will be followed by the premiere in the evening.  Afterwards, there will be a private after party at the Rumba Café.  It will be so exclusive that the press will not be allowed inside.”
“Yeah, babe; I am so sorry.  Mainly because of him you chose law enforcement as a career.”  Dean held Castiel’s hand.
Everyone gazed at him as if he had lost a couple of marbles.  Dean discretely gazed at Castiel, who was staring at his shirtless torso.  He smirked.   Ha!  Take that Fassbinder!  For the next ten minutes, the three boats were rowed in silence.  Everyone took in the scenic wonders of the area, which included a mother duck leading her young into an adjacent pond.
Castiel beat him to the door.  He looked through the peephole before opening it.  The bodyguard chuckled.  He knew what Dean was doing.  Poor guy, he was obviously coming to terms with not being straight and was going to have sex with some woman to convince himself he was a modern day Casanova.
“I’ll take a taxi and follow you guys.  He is going to pull through, Dean.  We know he is a tough son of a bitch.”
Gabriel beamed.  “Ooh, we are going to visit Children’s Hospital!  Dean is going to visit the cancer ward and present the patients with gifts.  He is even going to read Green Eggs and Ham to the little tykes.”
The main house also consisted of three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a remodeled kitchen, and rec room, where Dean would unwind playing pool, poker and/or pin ball.  Behind the house stood an attached separate, all inclusive and charming guest suite with one bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and laundry room.  Finally, after being shown the home’s four car garage, Pamela brought Castiel to a medium sized terrace, which held twenty people at a time.
As the paramedics wheeled Dean into the emergency room, Gabriel was instructed to remain in the waiting area.  He must have worn down a section of the floor tiles due to his constant frantic pacing.  A frazzled Pam entered the waiting room and held Gabriel.  “What the fuck happened, kiddo?”  Gabe reluctantly relived the traumatic minutes and told her everything he saw.
As he sat next to Dean inside the theatre, Castiel was impressed with the man’s acting chops.  He had expected the movie to be a generic popcorn summer action movie, but it had a decent storyline and good acting.  It had a Casino Royale vibe and that was one of Castiel’s all time favorite films.
Dean retrieved two beer bottles from the mini fridge and headed to his room.  He lied on the bed and turned on the LCD television.  He settled on MTV.  The actor was shocked to see they actually played music videos in the French version.  His emerald eyes closed as he heard Lady Gaga’s “Judas”.
The group entered the crowded cathedral, which was not holding mass at the moment.  Both Dean and Max wore dark shades and caps so they would not be recognized.  They all separated, going their own way as they observed and took pictures of the sculptures and stained glass windows which were littered throughout the structure.  Castiel remained by Dean’s side throughout the Notre Dame excursion.
Cas ran a shaky hand over his unruly hair.  “The only person, who was able to console me after dad’s passing away, was my best friend, Anna.  I felt guilt over not telling my dad I loved him.  One night during our senior year, we made love and she became pregnant.  My mother told me the best thing for us would be to get married.  A date had been set right after graduation…but during homecoming, Anna suffered a miscarriage.  She was three months pregnant.”
Adam approached Cas and planted a stinging slap on his right cheek.  Dean tried barreling into his psychotic brother but Adam instantly grabbed a rifle and pointed it at him.
The actor and his bodyguard rolled around the mat devouring each other’s mouths, as Dean cupped Cas’ hard ass.  Castiel bit Dean’s lower lip causing the actor to moan.  The two men froze upon hearing Gabe ask, “What the fuck is going on here?”
A visibly tired Dean drove his beloved Impala adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, which was located near Park County, Wyoming.  The sixty acres ranch Castiel had inherited was in the county, whose population was estimated around 28,205.  He rolled down the window and inhaled the fresh air provided by a gentle breeze. The actor covered his emerald eyes against the bright sunrays with black Ray Bans.  The sky was light blue reminding him of his husband’s vibrant cerulean eyes.
Dean glared at Cas suspiciously.  “You still have not told me who the serious looking dude in the trench coat is.”
Two hours later, the nurse, who had spoken to Dean, approached them.  Dean instantly rose and met her halfway in the waiting room.  “How is he?”
The dark haired man opened the door and scanned the woman from head to toe to make sure she did not hide any weapons.  He invited her inside.  The woman smirked.  “I thought you would be taller.   You know with you being in the Secret Service and all.”
Dean widely opened the door and in a flash grabbed Cas and carried him inside the suite.  The guard laughed as he closed the door.  “Never say I did not keep up with traditions on our honeymoon night.”
For quite some time they viewed video footage from the hotel’s main entrance and nothing caught anyone’s attention.  “Wait a minute, there had to have been cameras in the hotel’s garage, am I right?  The SUV was stationed there until the morning, when we were scheduled to depart.  Can we see the video of the garage starting at six hours before the explosion?”
Well that's all folks!  Thanks for reading, commenting, kudos and bookmarking the fic.  Until next time!  :)
“Dude, I can give you money and it’s not my freaking fault my parents gave you up.”  Adam pulled Dean’s hair harder causing his youngest brother to hiss.
In less than five minutes two patrol cars came.  Castiel and Sam gave their accounts of what transpired that night to two police officers.  They handcuffed Adam and read him his Miranda Rights.  The oldest of the officers told Sam and Cas they needed to go to the police station so a report could be filled out.  The two men agreed under the condition they were allowed to return home to see if Dean and Gabriel were alright.
Castiel’s clear blue eyes widened.  He bit a fingernail as he thought of a way to fix this mess.  Dean eyed him suspiciously.  “I bet I know the reason why you want to leave ASAP.”
After surviving the fire intact, Dean decided he would no longer deny what he felt towards Castiel.  Life was too damn short.  He would find a way of making the man see how good the two of them would be together.  Dean could not help himself and continued staring at Cas, who remained with his eyes closed.
“It takes some people longer than others to realize what their sexual preferences are.  I had sex with a man for the first time in college.  I knew it was something I would definitely repeat again afterwards.”
“We are going to a karaoke party now, Cas.  So I expect you to have some fun.  I am not saying for you to be off duty but chill out, man.”
Cas rolled his eyes again.  At the rate he was going, he was shocked his eyes had not stayed stuck during one of the many rolls he had given tonight.   The waitress reappeared once again at their table and told the assembled group to follow her.  Within five minutes, the Americans had settled in the karaoke box, which was a vast room that had two large sofas, a 70” LCD screen on the wall, karaoke system and four microphones.
Two burly African American secret service agents tackled the man and retrieved the weapon from his jacket.   Agent Hendrickson screamed, “False alarm!”
“I am sorry, signore but only staff is allowed in this area.”  She noticed the handsome American had been crying and took pity on him.  “I promise to come and get you, when I hear something.  Please sit down in the waiting area.”
Adam leapt on his sibling and placed his knife on Dean’s neck.  “Make a peep and I will slit your throat on the spot.”  Dean nodded.  “Good lad” Adam roughly dragged him to a chair and bound his wrists and ankles with rope.
The following morning, Castiel called Robert Singer to ask him for a huge favor.   Two hours later the call came in from local Italian police notifying the bodyguard he could come to the local precinct and see the hotel video from the night before the explosion.  Dean was adamant in coming with him.  So Castiel did not have any choice.  As they were leaving the hotel, Gabriel spotted them and also ended up going on the field trip to the police station.
Castiel pulled off the t-shirt he donned to cover his nose in order to avoid smoke inhalation.  The flames were already licking at his exposed back.  He frantically shook a slumbering Dean once again.  The bodyguard was petrified thinking the actor might have inhaled too much of the smoke fumes.  This could cause brain damage if the victim inhales plenty of the noxious fumes. “Dean, wake the fuck up!!”
Pamela retrieves something from her Coach purse.  “I happen to have your plane ticket for LA.  The flight leaves DC tomorrow morning at ten.”
Castiel kissed Dean’s forehead before going to Gabriel.  “Adam paid us an impromptu visit.  Samuel went after him.”
“Should Cas open it in front of his mother?”  Sam just laughed making Dean more nervous than he already was.
Adam’s hands tightened on the steering wheel of the pick-up truck he drove with one of the orderly’s keys from Las Encias Psychiatric Hospital.  Lady luck had been on his side because the orderly, whose corpse lied now on Adam’s bed, shared his height and coloring.  The stupid guy had told Adam earlier in the day that tomorrow was his day off.  So when the orderly came into Adam’s room to administer his meds, the psychotic Scotsman embraced the opportunity presented to him.
“If our favorite wanna be killer decides to sneak in through the balcony; he or she will trip and fall on this table causing the vase to crash.  A loud noise will wake us all and I will be able to apprehend the creep.”
Dean held the man’s arm.  “Do me a favor and don’t mention any of this to Gabe or Pam.  I don’t want to freak them out more than they already are.”
“If we hurry up; you will not miss too much of the conversation,” Sam stated as he carried a tray full of glasses, plates and cutlery to the kitchen.
They kissed passionately for a while.  Dean stopped and stared at Cas’ swollen, red lips.  Damn! The man looked hot as hell.  He trailed hot and wet kisses down Castiel’s toned torso.  His tongue licked the bottom outer part of his lover’s belly button.  Cas was shocked, when he felt Dean’s mouth continue its destination down south.  He placed a hand on Dean’s head.  “You don’t have to.”
“Dean, shut the hell up.  You are acting like an ungrateful spoiled brat!”  Gabriel exclaimed.  His boss was acting like a major dick towards Castiel.  He would not blame the guy if he walked away from this nuthouse.
“You will have time during your time in Australia to think things over.  I need to take this job.  You know I can no longer work as your bodyguard and law enforcement has always been in my blood.  Please understand, baby.”
Castiel was at a loss for words and Dean misinterpreted his silence as a yes.  His firm full lips covered Cas’.  He had never kissed a man before and thought Castiel’s lips would feel rough.  Boy had he been wrong.  The bit of stubble covering the other man’s face did not bother him the least.  Dean felt as if he was going to spontaneously combust as his tongue traced Cas’ plump lower lip.  The shorter man rapidly granted it access inside his velvety mouth.
Dean was in the middle of crossing the street, when out of nowhere a silver SUV headed towards him at full speed.  Gabriel yelled but it was too late.  The vehicle slammed into the handsome actor; sending him flying several feet in the air.  Dean lost consciousness as he landed roughly on the hard concrete pavement.
Gabriel’s stomach was rumbling so much it sounded like a herd of elephants running from a group of starving lions, who salivated at the thought of feasting on their flesh.  The short man slowly removed himself from within a slumbering Sam’s arms.  Gabe giggled as he noticed his Sammy still donned the kilt in which he role played with, earlier in the evening.  Gabriel also wore a matching kilt.  He had even forgotten to remove the war paint from his face.  The assistant recalled having seen a container of chicken lasagna in Dean’s fridge causing his stomach to grumble louder.  He silently vacated the bedroom he now shared with his boyfriend and headed to the main part of the house.
Cas threw a pillow at him.  Dean joined him on the bed.  They snuggled for a while.  “You know babe, this is going to be the first family Thanksgiving I am going to have.”
“We wait for Crowley to deliver the documents and proof needed to exonerate Sam.  The military information will be obtained much quicker.”  Castiel informed the two men as he finally sipped the delicious cappuccino.
Gabriel joined his boss in the kitchen’s island.  “That sounds great to me.  So what has Cas’ boxers in a bunch?”
Gabriel shook his head.  Dean entered the kitchen.  His eyes were red.  He approached Castiel.  The bodyguard faced him.  When he saw the actor’s eyes, he had to stop himself from taking him in his arms and never letting him go.
“I am the one, who needs to apologize for overstepping my boundaries.  Take care, Cassie.”  She got in the car and drove away.
“Alright, mate.  Sam, row your boat to the side.”   Once Sam had done as requested, Fassbinder got their boat next to Dean’s.  “On a count to three”
The following morning Dean and Castiel waited for Gabe outside of the hotel.  The assistant was in charge of bringing their entire luggage down to the SUV, which the hotel had arranged to drive them to the airport.  The driver stood talking to the two Americans by the sidewalk.  He and Castiel were discussing yesterday’s Inter vs. Milan match.  The bodyguard remembered to check underneath the vehicle for explosives.
Castiel peeked through the peephole.  The woman looked safe enough.  Just in case, Cas always had his friendly Taser gun by the door.   If this Pam Kowolski tried anything, Cas would tase her ass right on the spot.
The bodyguard’s smile turned into a frown.  “What is it babe?”  Dean asked not wanting to hear his husband’s reply.
The shoot took four hours.  Dean was beyond tired at the end of it.  The photographer and Lancôme exec shook hands with him.  They congratulated the actor and told him the campaign would be a huge success.
Castiel surprised everyone by punching Dean in the jaw.  The blond man saw blue jays flying in front of his eyes.  Sam was going to hold his arm, when Dean punched Castiel on the nose.  Blood ran down his nostrils.  The bodyguard was going to leap on Dean but Max held him by the arms.  The beefy security guard caught Dean, who was already in a fighting stance and escorted him outside.  An embarrassed Gabe and Sam followed them at a discreet distance.
She held his hand.  “I don’t want to see you get hurt.  You know I am here for you.”  Anna leaned in closer to him.
“Whoa, Deano!  Take it easy with the beer, big guy.”  In typical Dean Winchester fashion, the actor scowled at him and continued emptying out the pitcher.  All of a sudden, it was Cas’ turn to throw a dart and it almost landed on the wall.  The people around them heckled him.  Castiel smirked trying to hide his embarrassment.
“Great!  Now he has you mocking me.  You know what!  Go and have a jolly old time with good old Max.  Don’t expect me to be waiting with arms wide open when you return.”
Gabe suggested they play Dominos before going to bed.  Dean cleared his throat.  “Before we start playing, there is something I need to tell the two of you.”
Gabriel sat on Sam’s lap as he told a cop what he went through and then it was Sam’s turn.  Two hours later, the paramedics, CSIs and cops left the house.  Sam and Gabe went to their studio.  Cas had tucked Dean in bed and left to make them some chamomile tea.  He returned to their bedroom and saw his lover’s face all bruised up.
Castiel and Gabriel simultaneously rolled their eyes and sighed as they saw their significant others play Rock-Paper-Scissors for what felt like the hundredth time that afternoon.  The quartet had finally been able to leave Milan, after Cas’ former boss, Mr. Singer convinced the Italian authorities that the small group would be under tight knit security until Adam was apprehended. During the trip home, which felt as if Castiel and Gabriel had been stuck in Purgatory, the newly found siblings talked non-stop about their childhood.
Gabriel could not hold himself any longer.  “Don’t keep us in suspense, detective.  What did they have to say?”
“I have apologized over a dozen times already.  Who the hell drinks alcohol at an inauguration anyways?  Anyone could have mistaken his actions.  I did my job and protected George W in a situation which could have turned deadly.”
The sergeant motioned for the video geek to play the footage.  Two hours had passed and nothing out of the ordinary transpired in the segments they watched.  Gabe excused himself to get everyone some espresso.  Lord knows they would need the caffeine.
As the trio rode down the elevator, Gabe said, “I met this real hot guy at the boutique.  We really hit it off.  His name is Sam.  I hope you don’t mind Dean, but I told him to meet me at the Rumba Café.”
Dean loathed admitting to himself, but the two men looked good together.  It seemed they had a lot of stuff in common.  They were both into art, spoke various languages, enjoyed soccer and loved comic books as kids.  Gabe and Sam returned to the table.
“Gabriel seems really smitten with Maclachlan.  Maybe this will be the start of something,” Castiel stated as he laughed at Gabriel, who was gyrating his hips suggestively towards Sam, who towered over him.
Upon their arrival, the trio was escorted into a room, which had video equipment.  A video specialist was present to help with the footage.  Castiel had to convince the police sergeant in charge of the explosion investigation to allow Dean and Gabe to enter the video room with him.  The Italian relented after hearing about the attempts against Dean’s life.
“Oh shut up, you know the model guys are hot.”  Gabe said as he wiggled his eyebrows.  “I need to use the covers as inspiration for an art project I plan on doing when my Samuel arrives tomorrow.”
His boss headed to his bathroom and quickly removed his sweaty clothes and rocketed inside the shower stall.  The water was freezing as it pounded his body.  “I am not gay!”  He continued screaming in his mind.  If it weren’t because his life was in fucking peril; he would fire Cas’ rock hard ass right now!  Fuck!   He was so getting some sweet poon tang
Dean closed his eyes and bit his lower lip.  He silently prayed to a God he did not believe in.  “Please God; don’t take him away from me.  You removed my parents from my life, when I was just a kid.  If you want me to start believing in you, then now it’s the perfect time to perform a miracle.  Please save Castiel’s life.  He doesn’t deserve to go this way.  I can’t live without him.”  He started sobbing.
Two hours later, Gabriel was bored out of his mind.  Dean had kept himself locked in his room with the excuse he was reading a script.  Castiel had practiced some yoga earlier and then cleaned his pistol and read a book on self defense, as he sat sentry outside of Dean’s room.
“You are joking!  I guess people who claim romance is dead, do have a point.”  Max covered his heart theatrically.
Dean rained kisses all over Castiel’s neck and back.  “How do you feel today, babe?”  The blond asked referring to Cas’ wound.
Several days later, Castiel drove Dean’s beloved Impala through his hometown, Sycamore, Illinois.  Gabriel stated that Cas was definitely the love of Dean’s life, because the actor never allowed anyone to touch his baby’s steering wheel.  The only time Gabriel had been allowed to use the vehicle was when he had to drive a plastered Dean home.
The actor left to catch up to his bodyguard.  The dark haired man had already caught the elevator to the twelfth floor.  In three minutes, Dean was vacating the elevator.  He saw Cas talking to the guard.  Dean walked towards them and greeted the hefty guard.  As Castiel was opening the door, Dean gently pushed him aside.  “Allow me, Baby Doll.”
“Much better now thanks to your TLC” Castiel turned to look at Dean.  They stared at each other for a while.  That was something the two of them would never tire of; gazing into each other’s eyes for long periods of time.  Castiel ran his thumb across Dean’s lower lip.  He brought the digit inside the warm cavern of his mouth, where he took his time sucking it.  Cas peppered kisses all over Dean’s face.  “Have I ever told you how much I love your freckles?”  The bodyguard went on to kiss all of them.
Twenty five minutes later the black Hummer limo they were in halted in front of Mann’s Chinese Theatre, which was holding the premiere of Bang You Are Dead, Dean’s first starring vehicle.   A valet attendant opened the door for the two men to descend the vehicle.  Gabe was the first to exit the Hummer and the surrounding paparazzi and press groaned in disappointment, when they observed him.  The 5’7 man flipped them the bird and made space for his boss.
Two hours later, the satiated couple finally moved to the bedroom.  If someone would have told Dean Winchester three months ago that he would be spooning in bed with a man he was in love with; he would have punched them in the face.  He smirked as he trailed soft kisses down Cas’ back.  The actor even kissed the bandaged area and the barely visible scar from the Paris fire.  Tears started forming in his forest green eyes.  Castiel, who he believed to be asleep felt them fall on his skin.  He rapidly turned to face Dean.
Castiel sat in the center of the mattress with Dean sitting behind him.  Dean’s large hands covered his tense shoulders.  Cas closed his eyes as Dean kneaded his upper back.  “You are so tense,” Dean whispered in his ear.   He leisurely traced the outer shell with his tongue.  Castiel gasped as Dean’s teeth bit his sensitive earlobe.  In no time, Dean laid Cas on the bed and his body covered the shorter man’s.
“I am more convinced now; he had a career in the military.  First the sniper incident and now this!  He must have specialized in various fields.  It is not easy to rig such complex camera and fire detecting systems.  Now we know he followed you here.”
Dean kissed Castiel’s hand.  “You want to leave this place then I suggest you rest and stop freaking out.   If you follow the doctor’s instructions; he will discharge you within four days.”
He had no time to memorize the fucking tag!  The short man’s main priority was to check his boss/friend’s wellbeing.  The taxi driver wasted no time in calling 911.  When Gabriel knelt down to Dean, he felt for his pulse, which was weak.   He swallowed hard upon seeing the left side of Dean’s handsome face swollen and bloody.  “Come on Deano, open those gorgeous emeralds.”    The police and ambulance arrived less than five minutes later and the actor remained unresponsive to his surroundings.
Dean and Adam were unaware Castiel was almost done untying the chafing rope from his wrists.  Adam was in a chatty and sharing mood.
“Dean, you have to do exactly what I tell you.”  He could barely see his charge nod his head.  “Good.  You are going to crawl your way out of the suite.  Just head to the path which leads outside that is not in flames yet.”
Dean hit the back of his assistant’s head.  “Can you keep your fucking voice down?  You know I am new at this.  I have never been with a man before Castiel and I’m still getting used to things.”
Gabe winked at him before closing the door.  “Shit; the two of us alone for almost two entire days!”  Castiel started packing for a two day trip, which would feel like an eternity to him.
Two hours later, Dean Winchester stood in the middle of Children’s Hospital cancer ward, surrounded by ecstatic kids, who ranged from the ages of four to eleven.  Their little faces were illuminated with so much happiness as the actor handed each of them a toy.  Afterwards, they all sat in a circle and listened to Dean read the Doctor Zeus classic to them.  All of them laughed loudly as he changed his voice throughout the story.
Finally, Gabriel parked the car inside the garage.  He was going to assist Dean in exiting the vehicle but the blond man swatted his hand away.  “I am pretty sober now, dude.  Go on to bed.  Good night and I am sorry for being a big gonad this evening.”
“Baby, can you listen to me?  I need to know you are alright.”  If Dean died it would be his entire fault.  He should not have come up with the idea for the morning jog after finding out Adam had escaped.  All of a sudden, Dean opened his emerald eyes and started coughing.  Castiel assisted him in sitting.  Dean’s wrists were also tied with rope.  The actor licked his lips and was about to say something before being interrupted by the creaking of the shack’s door.  The snow had ceased falling and a strong wind blew into the shack.
He joined Cas in the center of the bed.  The bodyguard hungrily kissed him; laving his own jizz from Dean’s lips.  “Was I good?”
Castiel shoved Dean gently and gestured over at Sam.  Dean rubbed his neck nervously.  “Dudes, let’s get back to the hotel.  Sam, I bet you want to take a hot shower and eat a hearty meal.”
The bodyguard managed to sit.  He opened his mouth and Dean placed the two aspirins inside.  He even placed the glass of water in Cas’ lips so he could drink.  Once Castiel had swallowed the aspirins, Dean removed the glass from his mouth and placed it on a mahogany bedside table.   “I’m going to get you some coffee, Sam brought for you.”
His assistant clapped his hands.  “This is going to be great!  I am going to call Sam and you call Max.  They can join us!”
Castiel opened the driver’s door for Anna.  He was waiting for her to get in the Prius.  She turned towards him.  “Are you happy, Castiel?”
Gabriel retrieved two wrapped Blow Pops from his cargo pants pockets.  “Practice with these; although something tells me they are nowhere near Cas’ size.”  He wiggled his brows.
Their bodies were drenched in perspiration.   Dean unrolled the condom from his cock, which was already getting hard again.  “How about we go for round two in the shower?”  Dean suggested.
Dean cackled upon hearing Castiel announce his decision to resign from his bodyguard duties.   His fingers sank into the smooth/solid surface of the kitchen-island’s granite countertop.  Castiel tilted his head as he finally stared at his soon to be ex-employer.  He needed to get the hell out of the predicament he found himself in.  He was falling for Dean Winchester and if he went by the steamy make out session the two of them shared on the plane; the actor also felt something towards him, as well.
Cas felt as if he had run a marathon by the time he entered the elevator.  All of a sudden, the hotel’s fire system started ringing.  “Now is when it goes off,” a visibly pissed Dean said.
Gabriel instructed Dean to rotate the bowl and drink three sips.  The actor sips three times from the hot tea bowl.  He realizes it does not taste bad.  “Good, now wipe the rim and rotate it to its original position.”
Dean gently rubbed Gabe’s arm.  “Let’s return to the hotel, Champ.  You need to calm down and take a nap or something.”
Castiel cupped his chiseled cheek.  “Hey, I am here, remember?  I will not allow that psychopath to harm a hair on your head.”
Samuel slightly smiled at Castiel.  “I swear I am telling the truth.  I would never hurt my Gabriel.”
Incessant chirping from a group of house sparrows, which had built a nest on the tall oak tree that stood right outside of Dean’s room woke him up the following morning around nine.  The handsome actor had the worst hangover in the history of his drinking career.  His head throbbed as if an elf was jack hammering the top of it and he needed to throw up ASAP!  He ran to the bathroom and bowed down to the porcelain goddess for almost five minutes.  Once Dean knew he had emptied out his stomach, he brushed his teeth and gargled with Scope.  He splashed cold water on his face before exiting the bathroom.
“I am an agent with the William Morris Agency in LA and Dean Winchester happens to be my most promising client.  You never watched Young, Desperate and Beautiful?”
This was definitely the sexiest the man had ever looked.  He was dressed completely in black Armani.  His emerald eyes locked with Cas’ sky blue ones as soon as he had re-entered the room.  Castiel began to feel hot all over and discarded the espresso he had been drinking.
A frantic Pamela had been calling Dean like crazy.  Her assistant, Andy had woken her up the following morning at seven am telling her to go to TMZ and see Dean and Cas’ Italian Adventure video.  The agent almost hyperventilated when her eyes witnessed the video of Castiel blurting out that he and Dean were married.  Everything had been caught by a cellphone camera, from the bodyguard’s stunning announcement to the slaps the model gave the two idiots.
The bodyguard smiled at Max as the Irish raised man placed his arm around his shoulder.  Castiel felt Dean stiffen in the back of the taxi.  Why the hell was he being such an asshole?   He was adamant that he was not gay.  Yet he had passionately kissed him after the self defense session the other day.  Dean Winchester was a walking contradiction and confused the hell out of Castiel.
Sam introduced his uncle to his lover.  Gabriel finally jumped away from him and fervently hugged Crowley.  “Thanks for returning my Sammy to me.”
Castiel had never felt so much panic in quite some time.  He opened the door and he could feel the heat being emitted from within the suite, before entering.  The smell of smoke was overwhelming.
Dean shook hands with his brother in law.  “Thanks, Jimmy.  At least one of the Novak brothers saw my movie.  Unlike your older brother, who had time to only watch the new X-Men movie.”
An hour later the movie came to a satisfying conclusion and received a two minute standing ovation.  Bruckheimer and Bay both shook hands with Dean.  “Congrats kid.  You have arrived,” Bay said as he hugged the new action hero.   Dean, who was still not used to receiving accolades from people in high places, actually blushed.
“Yes, I guess.  I still cannot believe the two of you are married!  How did that come about?”  Anna asked as she massaged Cas’ knee.
Gabriel noticed the throbbing vein on the side of Dean’s forehead.  That always happened when the actor was seriously pissed.  Sam ordered more tequila shots to cut the tension.  The waiter swiftly returned with the drinks.  Dean had noticed Cas and Max were no longer dancing.  Where the hell could they have gone?
Gabe entered through a connecting door.  It was so pitch dark inside Casa Winchester, Gabriel stubbed a toe with a recliner.  He cursed as the pain diminished.  Well this is not going to put a dark cloud on my parade.  Sammy and I are officially a couple and he is staying in LA with me.  So I remain in a celebratory mood.  Gabe started to hum Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain on My Parade”, when he entered the kitchen.
Dean was fuming mad.  He cleared his throat.  The actor plastered a fake smile for his annoying assistant’s benefit.  “Gabriel, please bring over to the terrace the Patron Silver bottle and a shot glass.”
Dean smirked.  “Come on, I would not mind going one on one with you, Cas.  Besides, I need to protect myself.”
“Dude, we are going to be in public settings.  Mr. Killer is not going to risk being caught by trying to gank me, when there are tons of people around us.  Go ahead and tell Sinister, we’ll stop by for him.”
That night the trio returned to the hotel.  Dean and Castiel shared a warm shower before hitting the sack.  They dried off, donned underwear and brushed their teeth.  The lovers kissed passionately for a while.  Then Dean opened the bathroom door as Castiel turned the light off.  The duo was surprised to find Gabriel lying in the middle of their king size bed.
Later that evening, Gabriel treated Samuel to a celebratory dinner at a local Italian restaurant.  Pam was able to get Sam to sign an exclusive contract with a modeling agency.  They had an interview scheduled with a Dolce & Gabbana exec after the Holidays.  While the lovebirds ate their scintillating dinner, Dean was preparing for his night with Cas.
Castiel was startled as he saw the actor’s eyes get watery.  Shit!  Dean was more invested in them than he ever imagined.  The bodyguard inhaled a deep breath.  “No, we did fool around but we never got to having sex.”
“No, you buffoon, I am just doing something nice for you ungrateful idiots.”  He plastered a fake smile, as he served the two morons futamono soup and takiawase (vegetable served with fish).  The two men enjoyed their meal immensely.
Gabriel was the first to spot the German born actor flirting with a busty blond waitress.  “There he is at the corner booth.”  The four men headed towards him.  He stood up and shook hands with all of them.  He left the newlyweds for last and gave the two of them a bear hug.  “Congratulations, you two!  I am so happy you finally got your shit together.”  He slapped Dean’s back.  “What are we waiting for, mates?  Let’s celebrate!”  The sexy blond remained at their side.  She couldn’t believe she was in the presence of two hot actors.  The poor thing was about to spontaneously combust.
“I have always known your rampant womanizing and macho attitude was your way of over compensating your hidden homosexuality!  Hah!  I knew it!”   Gabriel smirked before sucking one of his favorite grape flavored Blow Pops.
His assistant giggled and led them to a small bench, where he gestured for them to sit on straw woven mats on the floor.  Castiel couldn’t help himself and discreetly chuckled.  Dean rapidly joined him.  Gabriel was visibly pissed.  “Please do not ruin the mood.”
“Oy vey,” Gabriel whispered to Sam.  “This is not going to end well.”  Sam shrugged his gigantic shoulders.
“By the way, Deano, Pammy is beyond furious.  She claims to have left you about a dozen messages.  So you better call her before you get ready for the photo shoot.”
Castiel’s plump and firm lips covered his.  At first the kiss was soft and chaste.  It seemed Cas was testing Dean.  The actor did not hesitate and grabbed the back of Castiel’s disheveled dark hair.  He kissed him hungrily.  Cas’ stubble did not bother him in the least.  The two of them remained making out for quite some time.  One of them kicked Gabriel’s seat waking the man up.  “What the hell?”  He asked before turning around to see what they were up to.
“For being such an apt pupil I deserve a reward; don’t you agree?”  Dean had no idea where that came from.
Dean said good bye to Bruckheimer, Bay and his co-stars before leaving.  He walked to the sidewalk placing his hands inside the leather jacket’s pockets.  Thank goodness the night was over.   Gabe was across the street after having heralded a cab.  He whistled to grab his boss’ attention.
Dean obnoxiously harangued Castiel to bribe the concierge for an extra room, but the entire hotel was completely booked.  There was a wine and food tasting festival being held that weekend; so many tourists from around the world had bombarded the City of Lights.  The bodyguard and his charge discovered upon being led to the suite that both chambers had one king size bed each.
Cerulean eyes clashed with jade ones.  “No, he and I decided to remain friends; that’s all.”  He swallowed nervously.
The taxis swiftly arrived at Ile de la Cite, where Notre Dame Cathedral is located at.   A group of Japanese tourists took pictures of the gothic structure.   Pigeons flocked towards an elderly French man, who always came in the afternoons to feed them bread crumbs.  Castiel felt a rush of tranquility overtake him.  He looked at the others and they all also had a relaxed look on them, as well.
As Dean passed by him, Castiel stopped him.  “That’s a marvelous thing you are doing for those children.”
“At least I have some great news.  Pam, who still blames herself for Adam ending up here, accompanied him to Elite Model Management.  She believes my Sammy has a bright future as an underwear model.”  Gabe smirked imagining his boyfriend’s hot bod plastered in billboards all over the country.”
Castiel ran a hand through his tussled dark hair.  “Dean, you have to be the dumbest jack ass I know.  If you would have remained spying on us, you would have seen me push Anna from me.”
“I am really happy for you, man.  You truly deserve happiness in your life.  Sam seems like a cool dude.  I actually like him.”
The actor excused himself and went to his room to call Pam.  He got quite an earful, when she answered.   He explained to her everything, starting with the tea ceremony in Japan.  After hearing what he had to say, she calmed down and started brainstorming how to get Dean out of this mess.    “I’ll see you when you get back, kid.”
He took in much needed breath and coughed water out.  Cas remained kneeling at his side.  Once Dean released all the water, he helped him sit down.  Dean’s breathing was returning to its normal state.  “Deano, you gave us quite a fright!  What happened?”  Gabriel asked as he held on to his boss’ cold and clammy hand.
He turned to Dean and kissed the tip of his nose.  “It was Pam asking if you had given me the Mustang already.  You know how nosy she can be.”
Upon seeing Gabe’s purple demeanor, Cas unwound his hands from the shorter man’s neck.  The ebony geisha wig Gabriel donned earlier sat limply on the floor.  Cas’ hands were white with the make-up that covered Nosy Rosie’s neck and face.   He unwittingly aided the troublemaker to rise on shaky feet.  Dean approached them and handed Gabe a cup of water.
Castiel tipped his chin up.  “Relax, will you.  I already told you that my dad died on duty.  He was the local sheriff and was shot by a junkie, who was holding up a convenience store.”
Dean excused himself and stopped his brother in law.  He still could not get over how much Jimmy resembled Castiel.  The actor had seen the pictures Rachel had throughout the first floor of Cas’s childhood and adolescence and Jimmy was a carbon copy of his older brother.  “Listen kid, if you put a scratch on Castiel’s gift, I will personally skin you alive.  Capisce?”
Pamela danced sinuously to Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus”.  All of a sudden, a warm solid behemoth body slipped behind her gyrating form.  A pair of muscular arms wrapped around her trim waist.  Pam ground her firm derriere into the man’s groin.  Her hands held on to said arms.  When the man whispered into her ear, she almost came on the spot.  The stranger’s accent was to die for.  “It’s a crime for such a beautiful and sensuous woman as you to be alone on a Saturday night.”
For the first time that evening Dean remained rooted on the floor and did not utter a syllable.  Twin red spots adorned each of his chiseled cheeks.  Damn had he been wrong about the geeky, scrawny bodyguard!  The ugly as hell trench coat covered a flat well toned stomach and healthy medium built form.  Castiel had muscles in all the right places.   To top it all off, the dude was hung as a prized stallion!  Shit!  When the fuck did Dean Winchester start noticing if dudes were well hung?  He must still be drunk; that’s all.
“I’m heading back to the stables.  I don’t want to miss Impala’s birth!”  Jimmy exclaimed excitedly as he got on the ATV again.  Dean grinned.  He loved Castiel so damn much.  The actor ascended his baby once again and drove towards the ranch.
George Jr. wore cowboy pajamas and a large Stetson hat as he began the heartfelt eulogy.  He managed to compose himself in order to recite a beautiful poem in memory of his mama.  All of a sudden, his eyes turned crimson red and he began speaking in a Darth Vader like voice.  He pointed an accusatory finger at Castiel, whose entire body was soaked in sweat.  “Murderer!”
Sorry nothing major happened in this chapter but I promise you guys will love next chapter's cliffhanger.  ;)
Cas put his index and third fingers together and curled the others to his palm.  He struck that hand straight forward to Dean’s right eye and stopped the movement about two inches from it.  He repeated the move but this time his hand landed on the hollow of Dean’s throat.  He demonstrated the technique two more times and then had Dean perform the move on him.  He was pleasantly surprised to see Dean was an avid pupil.
“I have an idea of something fun we can do in the shower to make up for Gabe’s successful cock block attempt last night.”  Dean winked at Castiel.  He started running into the bathroom.  “Last one in has to give the loser a blow job!”
Castiel smiled.  Who was he kidding?  He was head over heels in love with Dean Winchester.  Dean quickly gazed at Cas before making his final decision.  “Alright, I’ll be Hypnose’s model or whatever.”
The injured actor was still under the influence of the morphine which was being administered to him intravenously and the pain killers from earlier.  “Can you shut your pie hole for a moment please?! My head is spinning and I am seeing four of you and your bud, Sylvester.  Where did you two rascals leave Tweety?”Gabriel smiled and ignored Dean’s ranting.  He knew the meds had turned him into Oscar the Grouch.
Castiel chuckled huskily and damn if the sound did not make his groin twitch.  “I don’t believe in labels. I just don’t discriminate between the sexes.”
Gabe was proud of his friend.  Dean was acting very mature even though he knew the poor kid was dying inside.  Castiel headed to his own bedroom.  The wounded look in Dean’s usually vibrant eyes when he told Cas that he would be free to return to the man he loved almost killed him.  The bodyguard hated lying to the people he cared for.  Castiel sat on the floor.  He placed his head on his knees.  His eyes became misty as a tear slid down his right cheek.  Cas had not cried since he was a teenager.  He better apprehend the crazy stalker as soon as possible.  He did not want to cause Dean anymore heartache.
The Scot reticently untied his youngest sibling’s chafed hands.  They were extremely numb so they had to wait for Dean to be able to pick up the ballpoint pen.  The blond man finally rubbed his hands together before picking up the pen.  “Hurry up, baby brother!  I need to catch a flight after I dispose of all of you.”
“I have never met such a meddlesome person in my entire life!  What the fuck do you think you are doing?  Do we look like Ken and Barbie dolls, which you can play house with?”  A livid Castiel bellowed as he continued choking Dean’s assistant.  He loosened his hold a little on the quidnunc’s neck.
Castiel finished putting the shirt on.  “I hardly feel it.  I need you to stay here with the EMTs while I go to the security room and see if they can assist me with something.”
Dean placed Yuriko on the marble counter.  The waitress wrapped her firm legs around his waist.  Her lips attacked his.  He held on to her long silky ebony tresses as her tongue entered his mouth.  “Oh no!”  The time he made out with Castiel popped right in front of his eyes again!  “Fuck!”  Dean yelled.   Yuriko misunderstood the curse word for enthusiasm on Dean’s part.  Her hand started travelling down south.
Dean hummed as he took more of Castiel inside his mouth.  As he sucked him off, he caressed the other man’s balls with his right hand.  He knew Cas was about to climax at any moment now.  “Fuck!  I’m going to come, Dean!”
“Babe, is everything alright?  You were a long time on the phone.”  Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s torso.  The bodyguard was adamant in not ruining his lover’s Thanksgiving.
Castiel and Dean made frantic love the night before the actor caught the flight, which would take him halfway across the world.  The current Sheriff’s Deputy and Hollywood actor were terrified of growing apart and eventually losing each other for good.  For the next six months the two lovers corresponded via texts, phone conversations and web cams.
Castiel kissed him softly on the lips.  “Eew gross, too much PDA!”  Jimmy exclaimed.  He was rewarded with Dean tossing a pillow at his head and Castiel giving him the bird.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Two weeks…and then you will be history.  I’m telling you guys no one is trying to kill me.”
Gabriel rose on his feet and bit one of his finger nail’s cuticles.  Could the two incidents be linked?  What if the Belgian chocolate had been poisoned?  They had been intended for Dean but Crowley inadvertently saved his master’s life by hogging them all.  Now the hit and run.  Could it be there was some deranged lunatic out there trying to kill his boss?  Well not as long as Gabriel Jenner had any breath left in his lungs!  He tucked the blanket under Dean’s chin and exited the room to make an important phone call.
Dean ran a hand over the side of his face, which was not either stitched up or swollen.  Fortunately, he only required three stitches on the gash he received on the side of his face courtesy of his whack a doodle sibling.  “We overheard Adam’s defense attorney inform his paralegal to do research on insanity plea.”
Some of you might have caught on I based Max Fassbinder on the yummy, talented and well hung actor, Michael Fassbender. Thanks for reading!
“Shut up, Gabriel.”  Dean gazed over to the trio playing darts.  Sam hit the board’s bullseye.  Gabe applauded for his man.  Samuel blushed.  Dean glared at Gabriel.
He entered his room and was not prepared to see Dean packing his clothes.  “Babe, what are you doing?  We don’t leave until Sunday.”
“Two nights ago; listen, son.  I don’t have to tell you how dangerous and deranged this guy is.  I have alerted the FBI about him.  I need you to tell me where you are at.  This way I can notify the local authorities. They can have a patrol car guarding wherever you are staying at starting tomorrow morning.”
“Are you kidding? You’ve said if yourself, showbiz is a cutthroat industry and you never know when your fifteen minutes are up.  This will be a nice nest egg you will have and will be able to make a nice donation to the Boys & Girls Club.”
Samuel laughed heartily.  “Thanks, laddie” He placed one of his gargantuan hands over his shorter brother’s right shoulder.  “I will do all I can in helping Castiel and the authorities apprehend my twin.”  His Adam’s apple bobbed nervously and his eyes became watery.
Castiel nodded and returned to the hotel lobby, which resembled an asylum with all the traffic of people congesting it.  A frantic Max, who had been pacing incessantly for the last fifteen minutes jogged towards him.  “Are the two of you ok?  I was worried to death.”
“It is better if one of us shared his bedroom.  That way he will not be alone and placed in a vulnerable position.”
The physician who resembled George Clooney introduced himself as Dr. Gellar.  He chuckled before explaining things to the injured actor’s friends.  “Basically, Mr. Winchester will be out of commission between two to three months due to a sprained ankle, two fractured ribs and a broken upper arm.”
The following morning he sat in his boss’ office hearing the man scream lividly at him.  The stupid assignment should not have been Cas’ in the first place.  President Obama was vacationing in Hawaii with his family and only two secret service agents had been assigned to keep the First Family safe.  Castiel’s boss, Robert Singer had assigned him to Bush detail for the weekend.   The reason being one of the original agents had an emergency appendectomy the evening prior to the ceremony.
“Why don’t you join us for dinner this evening, Crowley?  We can all get to know each other better,” Gabe suggested.
Dean felt like the lowest kind of worm at the moment.  He stared at the marble tiles which covered the floor.  “Sorry for being a dick”  The actor joined them at the table and ate a couple of bites.  His appetite had evaporated after he realized he had crossed the line with his bodyguard.
“Of course; well have fun.”  Dean said as he entered his suite.  Gabe and Sam had already run inside.
“This cake is a house specialty from where I had it made.  It is a Kahlua chocolate cake with white chocolate mousse filling.”
A week later the quartet and Pam returned to LA.  They were finally able to truly relax after Adam’s death.  The man had been like their own Freddy Krueger since it had been so difficult to kill the fucker.  Gabriel had accompanied Sam to his first Calvin Klein photo shoot.  He had not liked how flirtatious the photographer had been with Sam during the previous night’s dinner.  Gabe had to keep his eyes glued on Balthazar the entire run of the shoot.  He trusted his darling Sammy but the grabby Brit not a smidge.
Castiel chuckled.  His hands were going to cup Dean’s face but the taller man swatted them away.  “Dean, did you just pout?”
The director ordered champagne for everyone.  “OK kiddies, who is going to be the first victim?”  His wife surprised him by volunteering.  She headed to the stage area and began scanning the playlist.
Dean was scarfing down his second slice of pumpkin pie, when the doorbell rang.  Jimmy volunteered to go open it.  A minute later he returned with a petite red haired woman in tow.  She had expressive dark eyes and porcelain skin.  Her gaze searched around and as soon as it landed on Castiel, she smiled radiantly.
The hairs on the nape of his neck rose.  The house was eerily quiet and when he went to turn on the kitchen lights, the room remained dark.  What the fuck?  He strolled over to open the refrigerator so it could somewhat illuminate the kitchen.  Gabriel was completely unaware of the giant dark form standing adjacent to the refrigerator.  Adam’s black outfit blended in perfectly with the darkness.  He had made sure to close all the curtains.
“I am sorry to interrupt, but the crime scene investigators need to take pictures of all of your injuries,” a young officer stated.  Castiel nodded.  At least Dean was safe now.  That is all that he needed to know.
Dean entered the living room area wearing black jogging pants, which hung low at the hips.  He stood behind Cas and wrapped his arms around the slightly shorter man’s waist.  “Dude, this better be good.  We fell asleep like two hours ago.”  He kissed Castiel’s shoulder.
“Dean…Gabe!  Are you guys in here?”  If something horrible happened to Dean, Castiel would never forgive himself.
“After I confronted my adoptive mother why she kept the adoption from Samuel and I; she told me the entire truth.  The Winchesters were not doing well financially, barely out of high school, when Mary discovered she was pregnant.  The young couple had contemplated having an abortion.  As fate would have it, the McLachlan’s happened to be in a road trip across the US and ended up passing through Lawrence, Kansas.  They stumbled upon the desperate couple.”
He had his eyes closed for a while.  Cas could feel Dean staring at him.  He was unaware the actor had done a lot of thinking after the fire.  The couple of minutes Dean waited for Cas to emerge from the suite were the longest of his life.  Dean could no longer deny he had the hots for Castiel.  Not just a crush, nope he was falling head over heels for his bodyguard.  When Dean saw Castiel walk towards the elevator, he felt like running to him and kissing the hell out of him.  Ugh!  He was becoming a chick!
The funeral service for Barbara Bush was being held at Arlington Cemetery.  A group of Scottish pipers played “Sleep Dearie Sleep” as her remains were laid to rest.  The entire Bush clan was being emotionally supported by various Heads of State.  George Sr. wept for his devoted late wife.
“You have bulked up a bit, big bro.”  Jimmy turned to Dean.  “Oh my God; you are the Dean Winchester!  Amelia and I saw your movie three times.  You rock!”
The press conference was confusing for Dean at first; because the questions were asked by the Japanese press in their native language. An interpreter would translate in English to Dean, the director and some of the cast, whom had also flown for the premiere.  Then once they were answered, the replies were given to the press in Japanese.  Castiel stood during the entire hour in a corner behind the panel.  As usual he wore his Ray Bans.  His eyes scanned the entire room at all time.
