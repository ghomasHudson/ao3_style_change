Phil could smell incense in the house, but it was wafting down from the second floor. It didn’t smell like any hallucinogens, but there was always the possibility it was being used to cover up an incriminating aroma. He wondered if Strange could already tell anything, or if they were all equally in the dark until this Meryll showed up. Initially, the girl at the door collecting money made him think this was probably a con, but when he thought about it further, teenagers making money off of newfound powers seemed just as likely as teenagers making money off of duping strangers. He was kind of hoping the night passed quickly because he and Clint had not had a night off, alone, in too long.
Natasha came in over the comm system and Clint was already flipping switches at the pilot’s seat.
he shook his head.
Peter whispered without thinking.
She turned her head sharply, noting the way Steve was staring ahead. Seizures? Tony had never had those before. She reached down to thread their fingers together. They held hands for the rest of the ride and the first two hours sitting in the waiting room. That was when Bruce and a doctor emerged, serious looks on their faces. Steve erupted from his chair.
JARVIS said.
Tony started the second pot of coffee while he began downing the first. Sleep was overrated anyway.
It was so quiet in the hallway, since it was just past 3:30 in the morning. Steve took a steadying breath and opened the doors. His eyes landed on Tony immediately, looking haggard and exhausted in bed. There were IVs sticking out of his left hand and one in the same arm. The oxygen tube was hooked in his nose and his breathing was steady. Steve found himself matching Tony’s breathing as he sat in the chair on Tony’s right. He looked so small and fragile.
Steve looked back to his keyboard.
Tony nodded. He bit his lip, unsure.
Tony demanded. No response.
The third gas station she checked actually had footage of the kidnapping. They hadn’t done their weekly glance through the footage yet, so they were just as surprised as Jessica when the blurry footage showed a slumped figure approach the man from behind and inject something into his neck. Whoever the kidnapper was had to be strong, because he lifted the unconscious man into the passenger seat of his own car easily, and Mr. Marcus wasn’t light. The Marcuses were both tall, and Mr. Marcus was a fitness nut, 6 foot of dense muscle. The kidnapper was easily a foot shorter, and didn’t look particularly buff.
The waiter’s face showed a split-second of surprise before returning to the polite smile. Steve probably wouldn’t have caught it if it weren’t for Natasha’s training in microexpressions.
he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast.
he asked quietly, voice monotone.
Steve tried. He felt sick now, but that was probably the terror gripping him.
Tony watched his mouth open and shut a couple times. The tension seemed to leave Steve in a rush, and Steve looked like a puppet with its strings cut as he crumpled into the chair again. The sob that left him startled Tony into action.
he assured her. Natasha wasn’t sure when she had become so entangled in this family; she never imagined she’d love a child like she loved Peter Stark-Rogers. Having children had never been in her own plans, but she would give anything for this kid’s happiness.
Staring after him for a few moments, Steve grew cold. Right, clothes. He pulled his clothes on slowly, thinking about everything. This felt too weird, like it wasn’t real. Tony was cheerful and had free time. Was this a dream? The sound of Tony elbowing the machine beside him startled Steve out of his reverie.
It wasn’t a question. He needed more information than what he’d been given. ‘Experiments’ could mean anything really, and Tony did not have the spare time to get involved with Strange missions if he wasn’t actually going to be useful.
When Steve ripped the mask off of his attacker, the shock of seeing a vampire’s familiar fangs almost sent him back to WWII. He certainly had never thought he’d see them again after HYDRA had been properly banished from Transylvania.
The android was the only other captor that had escaped the facility alive. She and Tony had been fighting off mercenaries for about an hour, but there only seemed to be a few left. If they could make it somewhere safe to just think, they could figure out a way to get off this planet. They fought well together, despite never even meeting each other until today. Maybe she’d be interested in Earth and the Avengers. Tony wondered if she was from here, or maybe Earth, or if she was from somewhere galaxies away. When Tony had got a hold of the suit again and led the coup of imprisoned scientists to escape, they had been mowed down faster than any of them could have expected. He shuddered as he thought about the number of dead behind them.
Natasha walked in first, the other Avengers filing in behind them, bringing some more chairs. Everyone looked like they hadn’t slept much either, though probably more than Steve. Natasha handed him a Stark tablet pulling a chair up beside him. At Steve’s questioning look, she explained,
His voice a little stronger.
He looked troubled, and deep in thought.
Tony stepped towards him but stumbled, and Steve had to lunge to catch him.
Bruce nodded, looking distinctly uncomfortable.
he asked shyly. Yet again, he was weak and in the hospital.
It was a good thing Bruce wasn’t a supervillain, because the look of sheer deviousness that crossed his face was creepy. Hulk and Bruce would be bad enemies to have.
Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he’d ever been for his eidetic memory.
I'd like to say, my favourite headcanon for superfamily is with Tony and Steve adopting teenage Peter, but here I've had him adopted much younger because I like imagining how they would have raised him when he was little. Also, if anyone is trying to figure out a timeline here that connects all these chapters? It's best you don't, because there isn't one that works. At least not on purpose. I hope this one is fun!
Steve said miserably.
Clint looked around the room. The front door led into a small kitchen, to the left was a doorway into what looked like a cramped family room with some mismatch furniture, and in front of them in the direction the girl had waved was an entryway into a dining room. There was a backdoor that led into the dining room that was straight across the house from the front door. Given the placement of the room, the stairway must be between the family room and whatever was catercorner to their current position, against the inside wall of the kitchen. He had a vague memory of one of his foster homes having a similar layout.
Clint started following him and they made their way to the conference room in companionable silence. When they walked in, Bruce and Natasha were sitting at one end of the long table talking quietly and Fury was at the other end writing things and tapping away at his phone.
he said as he walked up to tony. He placed his hands to Tony’s temples,
Steve walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around Tony, who leaned back for a kiss.
Steve’s hands were shaking as he finished turning the lock on his personal safe. He had known it was a good idea to have an extra reactor hidden separate from all of Tony’s backups, just in case something like this happened. Tony was too cocky about his own security. Keeping all of the backups in one place was asking for trouble. The glowing reactor looked like the Holy Grail to him just then. He was back at Tony’s side on the helipad in no time. The medics were loading him onto the chopper. Bruce had already removed the useless dead reactor, and the gaping hole in Tony’s chest was even more terrifying than the dark reactor. His lips were blue and his skin chalky white. Steve slammed the new one in, probably harder than necessary, twisting it just right for it to lock in place.
Steve merely returned the smirk.
He glanced over at the minibar against his will.
he grabbed a towel and wiped away the sweat and downed some water.
Tony was beginning to regret letting JARVIS have free reign to give advice. He used to only be allowed to give advice when asked, but Tony had removed the restrictions recently. It turns out that the AI has a lot of ideas about how Tony ran his life that he’d been silent on until now.
Natasha interrupted, voice even but threatening. She would not take insult to their actions as a whole that day. Coulson had led that mission and he had done everything he could, it was her old enemies in the Hand that had caught them off guard.
It naturally ended up in the Stark Industries spam folder.
Tony growled after he slammed their door shut. Steve had no complaints with the fervor, only helped Tony to strip them both down as quickly as possible.
Natasha nodded. She stole looks at Tony while she talked, taking stock of his state of mind. He seemed to be zoning out a little, but luckily not going into shock. He was tough for not having any military or SHIELD training whatsoever.
The archer watched helplessly while Tony fell to the ground below, the thump of his body landing in dead leaves and rolling a little making him wince. How had he thought sneaking up on a trained SHIELD agent was a good plan? Clint had efficiently flipped the assailant over, knocking each hand roughly to disarm him in case, and let go to watch them fall. There was no way he could’ve known it was Tony until it was too late. Everything had happened so fast, plus with the night vision goggles on, Tony looked kind of like a blurry bright blob, details like his goatee disappearing in the resolution of the lenses. Clint took the goggles off and strapped them to his belt, quickly climbing down after Tony. His natural night vision was better anyway.
- the tendency to sin innate in all human beings, held to be inherited from Adam in consequence of the Fall. The concept of original sin was developed in the writings of St. Augustine.
Natasha arched in pain, before passing out into Steve’s arms.
And that was how Jessica Jones, PI, became friends with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. The other Avengers proceeded to weasel their way into her life by the end of the weekend. Her life was strange.
Ty’s voice was familiar in a way Tony wasn’t prepared for. It thrust him back to the days when they had been close. It left a bittersweet taste of nostalgia for the friendly rivalry that had helped motivate and keep him sane through his whole childhood. Tony stared at the man in stony silence. A slow smile formed on the kidnapper’s face.
Steve smiled.
He placed a hand on Bruce's head and closed his eyes. From what Clint could tell it looked like they both entered some sort of trance, but their hair started to defy gravity. It only lasted about a minute and Bruce's eyes snapped open.
Steve said brightly. Tony just stared at him confused.
Everyone fell into easy conversation. No one delved into anything that could be remotely heavy or upsetting, and Tony felt particularly coddled as the day went on. The fog of being drugged slowly lifted, and Clint’s morphine was clearly wearing off. The archer grew less talkative and resorted to listening, wincing every time he laughed. Tony could think of nothing more forced than the interactions that took place when one was stuck inside a hospital. Being in jail was probably similarly fake, but Tony, luckily, wouldn’t know.
The two officers were trained well. They handled most situations calmly, only firing their weapons as a last resort. Officers Johnny and Hal shared a look, both agreeing that they had no choice when the short brunette tumbled out of the metal suit. That light on his chest looked like an explosive device, and the man would not stand down no matter how many times they asked. The two guns fired simultaneously, and the world seemed to slow down when the assailant froze, eyes wide before crumpling to the ground.
Strange opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by the door to the surgical wing swinging open. Dr. Stein stepped out. She looked thoroughly exhausted.
Tony looked down at the pages, scanning quickly. None of this made sense. He watched the compound blow up with his own eyes. He figured the ten rings would’ve fallen apart after that. Not to mention that he had hacked into the SHIELD mainframe and saw that they had made sure Raza was dead. He was in a building when it was blown up. Tony watched the footage over and over one night, just to be sure. This couldn’t be happening. He flipped the page and stopped breathing. There was a photograph of a man with the word
She left the room, cackling evilly, Tony swore that was an evil laugh. Agent stepped forward with a file pulled out of nowhere as far as Tony can tell. He leafed through pages as he sat at a table at the foot of the bed.
he ground out, lurching forward from the chair he had been sat in.
he said and he couldn’t move very well because the suit was heavy without any power to help him lift all that metal. Shit, how had he not prepared for EMPs before?
he said.
Loki didn’t find the answer satisfactory.
Tony only hummed in response, too focused on whatever the reporter was saying in front of him to actually listen to what Steve had asked. Steve couldn’t hear anything, so the captions must be on. He gave up and decided to make Tony some food anyway, since he likely hadn’t had anything besides coffee. If he didn’t eat it, Clint certainly always would, so it’d hardly go to waste. Tony let out a frustrated growl behind him.
Steve asked incredulously. It would’ve been adorable how naive the man was if Tony had had enough coffee for this. In lieu of answering, he just raised an eyebrow at the blond with a smirk.
Once they were all seated, Meryll held out her hands.
Natasha was beside him, speaking into her comm.
he said shortly. Bruce did what he was told, not wanting to make matters worse.
This time, he blamed Pepper. He really, really did. And of all months to get kidnapped, October was really the most inconvenient, he had so much work to do. Couldn’t villains at least try to schedule things around his life? November. November would be a great month to get kidnapped, Tony decided. No big SI commitments, no holidays he cared about, the weather wasn’t great…
he asked like some sphinx in a story. He dodged the wrench Tony threw at him as he continued his loud cackling and left the lab. Tony’s thirst for revenge was completely rekindled. He was going to start planning for next year right now.
Clint called out from where his head was now lying in Phil’s lap.
Tony whined.
Steve looked around bewilderedly at the rest of the room, and the pity in their eyes was strong.
Steve walked over to the work table, looking over the engineer’s shoulder. A couple comm units with some weird extension was sitting on the table, black outer shell still removed so the inner workings were visible. It could have been anything as far as Steve could tell, but he was sure it was probably brilliant. Tony screwed the casings back onto the pieces, and handed one to Steve. His facial expression was adorably eager.
Fury's face softened.
Steve threw a pebble back, laughing.
Fury said as he stood, hands clasped behind his back.
was all the warning she gave.
Peter hugged him fiercely before backing away to stand next to his friend, Wade, again.
Tony was still laughing hysterically.
Phil inserted himself smoothly.
Tony’s face scrunched up in confusion.
he added with a small smile,
Steve said confidently. Tony put his faceplate back down. Steve knew him too well at this point for Tony to hide his anxiety from his expressions. If it took about half his power to get here, the battle better be quick.
Clint cried.
she added.
Jessica Jones should’ve known things were too easy when the trail of evidence was so obvious. It started as a simple missing person’s case, the usual ‘oh please I haven’t seen my husband in days’ sort of thing that nearly always turned out to be a cheater run off with the mistress.
Steve left the chair and got down on one knee.
Clint nodded curtly, not saying anything. Phil came around the chair and looked into the archer’s eyes, and saw the storm of emotions Clint kept reigned in.
he blurted out. Tony could not have found a more adorable man to marry. He pulled Steve in for a kiss, that quickly turned a bit too sexually charged for the dinner table.
he ran a hand through his tangled curls.
As they shook hands, Steve noticed that his hands were a little sweaty, unconsciously taking note of everything about the man with a quick once over. It was a skill that all of them did automatically anymore, a necessary defense when you make a lot of enemies. He noticed that he looked fidgety and a little nervous, but decided it might just be his disposition.
Strange was probing into both Meryll and Zelma’s minds. This was certainly not a hoax, but from what he was seeing, Meryll was no mutant either. Nor was her name Meryll. The young woman in question’s true name was Heather Douglas, not Maryll. While she was from California, a terran, her powers were developed far away on the planet Titan. She had psychic energy with a level of control beyond anything Strange had seen thus far in his life of sorcery, but she had no cause to put that energy towards. That was how she had come to making a living with simple séances and fortune telling. Perhaps with the right guidance, she could become a great protector for the realm.
The crash of the chair against the wall startled everyone. Steve stood over the pieces, his chest heaving.
Tony blinked. He felt the fog lift from his mind, but truthfully, he had expected more of a physical feeling, maybe a shock. Instead, he just slowly realized that his decisions were his own again. He gave an experimental tugs on the chains, just for shits and giggles. He had no such luck. This really sucked, and now that he was no longer under the vampires hypnosis, it began to sink in.
Clint waggled his eyebrows at Peter, happy to know the boy was enjoying the story.
Steve sat down heavily beside him.
Before Tony could begin a therapeutic rant about magic, excruciating pain in his left leg had him screaming. When it was a little less overwhelming, he looked down to see his femur was bending unnaturally. He closed his eyes and willed himself not to pass out.
Natasha commented calmly. She appeared thoughtful, like she was recalculating something in her head. Tony was never quite sure how the woman’s brain worked.
He put the book down, and Tony tilted his head to see the title. Huh. Tony would not have expected Steve to be reading
Also, if you guys like my writing, should I write some Phlint? let me know.
He stood up to walk away and Tony didn’t know what to do. He felt like he should stop him, but what should he say? He stared after Steve’s retreating back and felt for some reason that it was crucial that he didn’t let him leave. Maybe it was the stuff Bruce said.
Steve tried to sound nonchalant. He wasn’t sure if he succeeded.
JARVIS answered, dejected. It had been mostly rhetorical anyway.
Everyone just looked at him so he sat back a little but whatever he was thinking still had him antsy.
Thor punched Loki in the arm.
Steve agreed. The room was beginning to feel stifling, and he closed the door quickly before anything could draw him back in. He wandered the halls of the helicarrier, nodding at agents who greeted him, trying to put out an unapproachable vibe. Eventually stepping outside, the harsh wind was welcoming. Steve leaned against a wall with his eyes closed, just focusing on the way the wind battered his clothing and face. He didn’t know how long he stood there, but was brought back to the present by a hand placed on his shoulder gently.
He shut the door behind him, all business.
Pain, Tony could hear whimpering from far away. Was that his voice?
Steve gave up.
She clutched at her stomach where the rope fell away, trying to put pressure on the wound.
Tony interrupted.
Having checked on that, Tony laid back in relief. Now that he had the chance to look at what else was going on in the room, he saw what Steve and Phil were doing.
Steve chuckled as he popped the rest of the piece into his mouth. The pieces were only about the size of Tony’s palm, but they were quite dense. They really were very good. They finished them off pretty quickly, washing down the stickiness with gulps of hot chocolate. Steve was actually surprised when he reached into the box but there were none left.
Clint flopped backwards onto the bed.
Tony was so proud.
Maybe he could sneak into bed when Steve was asleep.
and he needed Tony. Tony was home and everything he loved about the 21st century.
Agent Coulson betrayed Tony.
Dr. Strange rarely admitted being wrong, but he wasn’t such a narcissist he couldn’t see when he was fairly disputed.
Clint watched in horror as Tony started convulsing. Steve jumped up like he was going to pull Strange away, but Strange, who Clint thought had been unaware of them anymore, held up a hand.
Halloween is a very busy time of year for the Sorcerer Supreme. The veils between dimensions thin, and not so nice beings try to take advantage; Basically, Halloween is the worst overtime day of the year for Stephen Strange. This year, in particular, someone has decided to team up with Nightmare, and he is far more powerful than he should be, and he's after the children. If Strange wasn't so tired from all the other multiverse protecting, it'd be no biggie, but he is, so he asks the Avengers for help.
Steve chuckled.
Tony closed his eyes, taking a moment to accept what would happen next before he opened them.
Tony replied slowly, his eyes working the HUD display in the suit as he told JARVIS to turn on the UV lights in the gym.
Steve noticed that no one mentioned him and that Coulson spoke of them in twos. He was grateful that it was assumed he’d be there the whole time, at his lover’s side. He followed Dr. Stein, Phil and Clint trailing behind through the double doors. Tony was three rooms down on the right.
The brunette shook his head furiously.
Steve didn’t have to gasp so loudly. Tony hated the drama of it all if anything was ever actually serious. He took a steadying breath, annoyed at the way his heart rate picked up with anxiety at hearing that his heart might have even more problems.
Steve settled onto the ground, smiling at nothing in particular.
He assumed she must be convinced, because she deftly replaced the ship’s broken parts and pulled out a wire with an adaptor the reactor could plug into. She stared at it in her hand.
Matt honestly hadn’t even thought of it. He dialed Natasha automatically, since they were already friends.
He followed her through the halls, her heels clicking loudly. They didn’t say anything until they had coffee in their hands and were sitting in a corner of the cafeteria, Steve worried about what she had to say. He really wasn’t in the right state to deal with a lecture right now, even though this was his fault.
Bruce directed as he walked out the door.
he said flatly.
Tony stopped him. Strange turned and eyed him.
ah, that sounded less like he was about to cry.
Tony growled.
Morgana breathed excitedly. Tony obviously couldn’t see what excited the madwoman, but the sudden pins and needles in his chest and the increasing difficulty in breathing gave him a pretty good clue.
Steve felt his eyes well up with tears.
All sense of time was lost, Tony sobbing into the empty room. He wasn’t sure how much more of this he could take. He could handle most forms of torture, had far too much practice with it, but whatever this drug coursing through his veins was another level. Tony often felt separate from his body when things became overwhelming; he could dissociate and let the pain happen to someone else. This, though, came from inside him. His own blood had become the torture weapon used against him, so every beat of his heart the pain seem to start anew. There was an intricate web of heated barbed wire sawing outwards from his center.
Tony assured him.
That explained the cold. Illusion spells, though? He’d have to ask more about that later though. He didn’t understand how that had made his three capable teammates unable to neutralize the Mandarin themselves instead of everyone needing to depend on Strange. Magic is so confusing.
Phil said.
Natasha stepped towards him, a hand placed gently on his shoulder.
Clint replied.
Strange sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face.
he told Coulson, happy to change the subject from Tony in drag. Not even he had known he wanted that until the picture had popped into his head.
Tony watched the diagram as the red dot moved around, indicating where JARVIS was ‘seeing’ the signature in the basement.
The story of how Tony and Clint went camping, just to try and find Bigfoot, and came back a little closer.
Tony asked,
Clint closed his eyes and counted to ten. How Steve dealt with this all the time was a mystery for the ages. He walked back and silently helped the smaller man up, to lean on him. Tony kept his mouth shut, limping back to camp, where Clint unceremoniously dropped him outside the tent. The fire was still slightly burning embers, so he scooted over, shivering. Clint watched him curl up, one arm cradled awkwardly to his chest, the other wrapped around his knees, and his injured ankle gingerly placed on the ground while he just stared into the glowing embers with a thousand-yard-stare.
Tony felt like an idiot for not realizing what was bothering the man earlier. Of course it was because he thought they were equals. Tony and the rest of the world knew that Steve was a better person, but Steve had come to believe that Tony was as good as himself. Tony wasn’t complaining, but he knew it wasn’t true.
If any of you can actually find the lyrics written out, please let me know because it is shockingly hard to find, but the song is beautiful and what I can make out of the lyrics is wonderful. I may be in love with the idea of Steve loving Marian Anderson.
he croaked. He didn’t have time for this. He had work to do and for some reason, the Avengers were blocking his path.
Tony asked, ignoring the rude things Bruce had just said and opting to deal with the part that made no sense.
she snapped. She hadn’t needed to of course, as Steve was already in the process of kneeling beside her and pinning Clint’s shoulders down.
Some of science’s most spectacular discoveries were made through risky experiments. Tony Stark was an avid believer in the idea that sometimes you just have to ‘run before you can walk’ technique if you wanted to get anything done in a timely manner. It's how he made the armour, it's how he made most of SI's products, and the strategy served him just fine.
Christine was pulling out a tape recorder.  "Is this the first time you two have seen each other since--"
Steve took the glass and then downed it.
Holy Turing, Tesla, and Lorentz, Tony hoped they were right.
!"  Tony looked up at the sudden change in pitch.  The color had drained from Donner's face and he was gripping the car door.  "...I... I think my water just broke."
"Can you drive us to the hospital? I think Steve needs to be close to Tony right now," Donner explained, with an immense amount of politeness considering he was about to give birth.
.  He wanted to stop his Alpha feeling so insecure. But it was evident that that simply wasn't possible. Trust was a slow process, something to be built up one brick at a time. If Steve rushed that process their trust would, yet again, have shaky foundations. This was stripping back and starting anew which, in itself, demanded a degree of caution.
Banksy reached over to shake their hands, then feigned shock that he couldn't because they were holding hands, and instead rose to give each of them a kiss on the cheek, prompting audience laughter.
"Yes-- sorry.  Sorry. Coming, Giddy," mumbled Donner, stepping around them and walking over with his head hung down.
"I don't need help!" repeated Tony, hackles raised and upper lip curled.
"Okay, so there's one about pregnancy. Nope." Steve scrolled through the list. "Also, to try and win an omega you have to put one on the table. You're not betting me for shit. I don't care how good you think you are," he told him pointedly and found the second workshop. "Huh. Okay, there's one for
He reached behind Steve's neck to feel the mark-
"...caring for other people isn't logical.  But it's human," said Phil, fastening the ankle bracelet.  "...now don't break this one. We'll come up with an alibi for you, but this was part of an international treaty, so we can't afford to have you fall off the grid again like that, okay?"  He looked up, his hands still on Steve's ankle. "...they say you were shopping for collars earlier today. Is everything okay, Steve?"
Surprisingly, Donner paused and looked up at him.
Steve stared at his tea and his shoulders sagged. It had over-brewed, the tea bag left in for too long. He hated that.
"Let's go."
"The spades aren't really allowed out much," the bored girl explained to Steve.  "They don't know about how you were like, unfrozen or whatever, or about Iron Man, or anything really.  My parents just sent me here last month so I heard all about it. ...I can't believe you came out. If everyone already thought I was an Alpha I would have like, stayed that way forever."
"...it's... equalizing," said Tony.
There was a sigh on the other line and in the background, some scuffling.  "Did you hear the news?"
"Yes!  That's it, Ashtray.  Wasn't that the year he had the public bonding ceremony?"
Steve was wailing in harmony with Swift.)  "I think it's gonna be okay, I think..."
"Yes to both," said Tony, who seemed perfectly at ease with all this.  Of course he did. "How many pieces did Cyrille put aside for us?"
Banksy took another deep breath.  "Boz and I were pair-bonded for thirty years.  The-- the first two years I hated-- I hated every second of it.  I hated being bonded to him and I know he knew that. But... but the reason I say all this is because... because Boswell and I had a relationship that evolved.  Boswell did not discipline me. He did not get angry when I spoke back to him. I got braver, and one day, when he told me to kneel, I told him I would not. And Boswell said to me... he said..."  Banksy's eyes teared up and he began crying but he kept speaking. "...he said he would never make me kneel if I didn't want to. But I had to say it. That-- that was the Boswell-- that's the Boswell who I have to-- say goodbye to today.  Boswell gave me my voice. He fought to get me on his show and he fought to turn the show over to me. Boswell was old-fashioned but he and I grew together... we grew toward each other, and with each other. And after thirty years, I can say that the worst day of my life wasn't meeting him.  It was losing him. Without him, I wouldn't have ever learned to be the omega I am. Our relationship started in a bad way but-- but I love my mate. I do. I will always love him and the way I remember him is not as the man I knelt for, but the man who told me that I didn't have to. Boswell lived a long life and he watched the world change around him and he changed with it, something that-- that not many people can do very easily.  He was an inspiration, I think. I-- I love him and I miss him and-- and I wish--" Banksy's tears flowed harder. "--wish I could just-- kneel for him one more time," he finished in a croak. He couldn't go on; he was crying too hard.
"What the hell are you still doing with these people? You can literally run away." Steve said. He reached up to push his goggles up to his forehead so he could look into the omega's eyes. "You're better than HYDRA. You're not one of them," he breathed, voice steady with conviction.  "Show me where the HYDRA men are and I'll get rid of them."
The line was silence for a moment while Tony thought fondly of spending a lazy day with Steve, holed up in the apartment.
.  Interesting choice.  Thought you were only into betas for some reason.  He was a cute little blondie, wasn't he?"
Steve's broad back was to him, staring into the dark room.  The walls were covered in little stainless-steel drawers, like a library's card catalog, almost.  There were lots of blank screens, medical devices, wires strewn everywhere... in the middle of the room, a chair, like a dentist's chair, except no dentist had straps like that on the arm rests...
"He's a good bro like that," said Tony mildly, looking back down.
Steve thought it was nice to see them let loose, having fun... to actually see more of their more of their personalities shine through. There was hardly any timidness at the table. People asked Steve questions about the war, what it was like to be with Tony, how he was doing after his miscarriage. He'd enjoyed it more than he'd expected to and almost felt bad for expecting so much worse.
"I will get over this. I promise," Steve said, sounding more resolute than before.
Clint managed to sit up wearily, notch an arrow, and shoot it at Pietro's hand.  The gun went off, deafening everyone and hitting a light fixture. Pietro cried out, his hand bleeding, dropping the gun.
Donner, of course, began to show, and started getting weird food cravings too. One day Steve headed downstairs to find him boiling about twenty eggs all at once. Donner looked sheepish. "I just... I just really wanted some egg mayo."
He paused suddenly, pulling out a small red box.
. It was like no one could get to him down there, no one with their stupid shitty statusist views, their weird outdated opinions that should have died a century ago, like Steve should have--
Hawley blinked and actually looked surprised for a moment, like she'd been expecting a fight or at least some protests. She straightened up in her chair. "We're prepared to review the situation in six months time at the very earliest, and even then we can not guarantee an increased amount of freedom. And if something happens which means we want to reinstate the ankle monitors, then we will do so immediately. Do you have therapy set up already?"
"For the record, I would rather die than have HYDRA babies. So if it comes to it, shoot me." The funny thing was, Steve was being serious. He couldn't think of anything worse, anything more degrading.
"Go ahead and shoot me," said Tony.  "I don't care anymore."
Steve turned back to the Tesseract, peering at it.
Banksy squealed, ignoring Boswell.  "
"No.  Steve, the lights are on, I promise," Aria said as she threw a blanket over both of them. Steve barely reacted to it and it was Tony who had to pull it around him.
He trailed off.
Steve sighed fondly. "I was gonna go with 'chaotic'."
Except, that wasn't exactly true.  Steve had been here before, in a cell in Yemen.  And he knew what came next.
Steve let Tony lead, even though he was shorter.  He knew the way; Steve was already lost in the crowd.  His Alpha's hand was a hot claim on his waist through the thin fabric of his shirt. It made Steve shiver. Tony guided him through the crowds and it was a relief to be with someone who knew what they were doing.
He struggled to get his emotions under control.  "You're safe..." he murmured, his voice deep and rough.  "You're okay.  It's okay."  He was equal parts reassuring Steve and himself.  The hair on the back of his neck wouldn't go down.  Not being able to do anything, knowing Steve had had to protect himself... that he hadn't been there... he should have been there...it was driving Tony crazy...
"Fuckin' A.  This is so-- STOP THE CAR!"
On the sidebar of the phone, there were a couple of recommended articles.
he mentally corrected himself, remembering that Bucky-from-the-forties and Winter-Soldier-from-Yemen were the same person.  But the public didn't know that. In their minds there was Steve's-old-mate-from-the-forties-who-was-like-ninety-years-old-now, and the-guy-in-Yemen-who-force-bonded-him.
"Before we begin, let me just address the elephant in the room.  I'm not an omega.  If you'd feel more comfortable talking to an omega, please don't hesitate to ask.  No hard feelings," she said.  She leaned back in her chair, playing with a pencil in one hand, but didn't seem like she intended to write anything down; she had nothing to write on, anyway.  "So.  Steve.  Here's the one million dollar question.  ...how are you doing?"
"Pep, can you make me a night cap?  I just need something to take the edge off..."
"Sorry, guess it all caught up with me."
than he would have liked.  It was Steve in a nutshell.  Strong and optimistic, with lots of flowery language and powerful ideas and a sincere belief in the goodness of people.  Tony was disappointed by the lack of details about their sex life.  He would have to change that, when he had the chance.  Maybe let slip a few details, like Steve's ability to hold his breath or something about how Steve was lucky he had the serum to help him keep up.  Tony didn't want people thinking he'd grown soft; he had cultivated a careful image of himself as a sexual force to be reckoned with.  After Afghanistan, he had had a three-month hiatus from sex and then it back to business as usual, bedding a new girl every four days, on average, just to keep up appearances.  He hadn't even enjoyed it, really.  But it was important for him to act that way.  It was a habit, a chore, and Tony had maintained an extravagant social life even through his Iron Man-ing, because doing otherwise would, in his mind, be a sign of weakness.
Pepper cocked her head.  An aide handed Tony a cup of ice and he happily began crunching it, pulling out his phone to check his messages.  "What'd you think Tasha wants? Think she's got presents for us?"
He stepped over the body and began striding quickly down the hall at a not-quite jog.  Sam went over the bodies, just in case one might have anything useful, but neither had anything Sam didn't already have himself, so he shoved them to the side and raced after Tony.
"I'm not really great either," Steve breathed. He didn't know what to say. He felt awkward. Tony looked older with the beard; that's why he didn't like it.  Tony looked old enough to be his father.
, you've got fourteen pre-prepared sound bites on the next tab for any--"
"Spare me your scientific mumbo-jumbo and give me a deadline."
Tiberius laughed lightly.  "Have fun, you two. Let me know if you need anything else."
"Oh, no," she said quietly, automatically looking over her shoulder.  "...no... are you sure?  Can't you stop it?"  Tony was impulsive and reckless and posturing on the best of days; around an omega in heat, he was sure to be unbearable.  Suddenly, Tony's actions made a lot more sense, especially his overly aggressive confrontation with Hammer.  "...just now?  ...today?  ...does Tony know?"  Her mind was spinning, trying to figure out the best way to handle this new problem.  She felt a small sense of guilt for thinking of Steve's biology as a "problem," but she couldn't afford to be politically correct right now.  An omega in heat in Steve's position, surrounded by Alphas, was like a piece of meat in a dog kennel.
Bucky felt the weight of Steve's head on his shoulder and his fingers lacing through his own, and he curled into him.
Peggy had never let being a woman get in the way of rising through the ranks of the SSR.  Steve wouldn't let being an omega prevent him from doing what needed done, either.  He never had.
The orchid was truly beautiful and if they hadn't received so many already Steve probably would have been more enamoured by it. But he still appreciated the gesture. They probably shouldn't auction this one though... it was too significant a gift, and too beautiful. And it was too soon to the auction now; to sell it would be in bad taste.
"Yes," Nick dead panned, staring him down.
Oh, boy, Steve was never going to get it, and Tony was too drunk to explain, anyway.
They had one last final charge with Cooper on Steve's shoulders, their pile of snowballs rested precariously in Cooper's lap and Steve's pockets. Although he couldn't start throwing until he'd set the boy down (safety first, and all that). When the final blow ended up being a headshot to Natasha, ruining her once-perfect hair, it was decided it was a draw.
somehow, like he'd been here before. Steve kicked his shield up into his grip and then moved to push the door open, "One sec..."
"Least you guys have pineapple," Steve pointed out quietly with a sigh. America wasn't hit especially hard by war rationing, but they weren't exactly throwing exotic fruits around for everyone to enjoy in the forties. The elevator thankfully stopped and they stepped out. Natasha was already on the phone, ordering  pizzas in fluent Italian from some, no doubt, local joint.
Steve was trying to pretend he wasn't nervous. Before he knew what he was doing he was reaching over and taking Tony's hand. "Tony." He was trying to focus on his breathing and keeping it calm. Steve swallowed. Jesus, why was he so nervous?
"Yeah, it's shitty.  But they normally only make you do it once," said Natasha.  "And it's not real."
Tony limped slowly out of the room and down the hall.  Steve was probably in the gym, which would give Tony time to toss out the tulips before he noticed.  Tulips were a cheap flower, anyway.  They wouldn't be missed.
, to get closer.  He didn't care who it was; he just knew they needed him and he needed them and that they were probably perfect for each other.  They were probably in love.
"Well, he shouldn't have looked like you." The words were so flippant and dismissive they made Steve want to punch a wall. Like it was Donner's own goddamn fault for
Steve's brow knitted.  So they
Before Steve could give any attention to the girl yelling at him Tracy pulled him into another dance. This was one was too familiar. He didn't like it. "Hey, hey...Steve! You okay?" Tracy asked, half yelling in his face.
was his dad.  Just call him Steve," said Tony with a roll of his eyes.
scared.  So many things could go wrong.  Tony's math was solid, sure, and his engineering skills unparalleled.  But all that was theoretical.  In practice, unexpected things happened.  The collider could fail to work or blow up in the his face.  The element might not be synthesized, or if it was, it might be too unstable to be held in the newest arc reactor, in which case Tony was a goner.
now, not
.  He needed his mind to be in a state of perfect emotional calm.
"--ha ha, yeah, like, when he was testifying against me in the Senate, you know, that was great," agreed Tony.  "Hilarious, really... I mean, I wouldn't really call us competitors, you know, my inventions
"July fourth, nineteen-eighteen."
Tony seemed more interested in apple. Steve gave him more apple.
"It's nice to meet you Charlotte," Steve told her when the two Alphas clearly weren't listening. Charlotte's whole face lit up at that. She pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes and smiled at him.
"You, Steve Rogers-- I thought better of you!" Aria said and Steve saw Tony in the bathroom doorway. His shoulders slumped.
Karpov rose and patted him.  "Always such an attentive student.  You cooperation is appreciated, soldier, and you'll be rewarded for it."  He seemed upset.
"Fuck 'em!" repeated Trey.
"You told me not to allow you to call Steve.  You've requested a drunken call to him thrice already, sir."
"Actually, I took the liberty of obtaining a copy of the convention's rules," said Pepper, holding up a sheet of paper.  She recited from memory: "Omegas are allowed on premises only in their capacity as staff or if bonded and in a locked collar; omegas must be escorted at all times by their Alpha and are expected to behave with a decorum befitting their status and the expectations of their Alpha."
The information washed over Steve like a tidal wave. There was so much of it was almost suffocating and Steve was almost taken back to before a battle, when one of his men would go over every possible situation and all the possible numbers. It took him a moment but he thought he had it down. Pepper wouldn't have hired him if he couldn't cope with it, after all. Tony seemed be distracted by something off the bat though: searching for someone, maybe? Steve politely waved past many of the 'reds' Pepper had highlighted who were apparently bad news.
Maybe he was reading too much into things.  Maybe whoever sent them simply thought tulips were pretty.
Dr. Brennan followed Steve's gaze over to Tony, then she looked back at Steve.
, but that wasn't the point; it was something Tony was self-conscious about.  Also, their height difference was glaring; Tony was looking up and Steve was tilting his head down, and there was something about that that felt very weird to Tony. Maybe it was because he was
"Have you talked to Sitwell?  He's a mole," said Barton.
"Thank you doctor," Steve stood and shook his hand. He didn't even wobble. He looked far better out of his uniform and no longer covered in blood.
Tony swoop down (he felt the sharp, vibrating ping of a few bullets hitting his armor) and landed in the front of the hacienda just in time to hear an explosion from somewhere behind the house.
"--Steve? Are you okay?" Aria had a hand on his arm. She was watching him with concern. So were the other agents. Steve looked across the room and realized he'd thrown his coffee against the wall.
To any other person, the marks were indistinguishable; they were simply bites.  But to Tony, the difference between which was his and which wasn't was obvious, as obvious as telling apart two different people's handwriting.
"Do we... know how many of those camps are still left?" Steve asked tentatively.
"Tony," warned Pepper.
"December thirteenth, nineteen eighty-nine," said JARVIS.
Judy patted his arm. "I'll make some calls."
Steve sat down on the couch a little heavily, running a hand over his face.  "How comforting." Steve frowned. "Not still messing around with that damned rock are you? I told you, it's a bad idea."
different," cut in Tony.  "We're both brilliant, good-looking, patriotic, good in bed..."
Upstairs, Coulson's phone rang.  "Clint.  They need us in New Mexico," he said with sudden seriousness.
"Maybe we should go. See what kind of Alphas are there, what discipline counts as...but we can sit near the back, so if we wanna leave we can," Steve hummed. He certainly didn't want Frond to recognize them or try to call them out. She sounded like the kind of woman who liked a project. And Steve undeniably presented a very big challenge for someone in her line of work.
"He's either too besotted or he literally can't hear me," she said and moved over. May stared down at Steve, her face twitching for a moment. "Will he be alright?" she asked quietly.
"Never mind.  ...what if we used a plant?"  Tony was still looking at the map, critically.  "Y'know, put an omega in there."
Steve glanced up at a bit of movement in the periphery of his vision.  The waiter.  Oh right.  ...restaurant.
Tony grinned.  "I love Banksy."
"Natasha and Clint--"
The boy, a beta recoiled a little, looking sheepish. "...that's why I asked."
"  Tony's voice caught in his throat.  He took another gulp of the whiskey.  "--his posture was all wrong, limp. Steve-- Steve kneels
He ducked his head down, the gesture totally submissive. "I want you to
She handed it over. He put his number into it. "I know people who could find her in a matter of minutes. Call me when you get the chance.  Her name, her birthplace, all that.  I can locate her for you."
"Unauthorised guests are now by the poolside."
"But the asset is himself an Alpha."
"I wouldn't mind a piece of that." The man's smile was easy.
Tony was loud in bed, just like he was loud in everything; he let Steve know what he liked, which all of it, every little bounce and wiggle and thrust. Their naked bodies pressed into each other and wriggled together and within a minute every one of Tony's muscles was tense with a suppressed orgasm. He found Steve's lips and pressed into them and the moment his tongue had found the familiar taste of Steve's mouth he was pulling his omega down over his cock and pumping his seed into him with a wail of Steve's name, one loud enough to make the maid watering the orchids downstairs blush bright red.
"Its too late," Steve whispered, shaking his head. "It's too late. He'll have gone somewhere bad. This wasn't about getting rid of Donner. This was about punishing me. Gideon wants me to know that there's consequences for my actions. He couldn't take it out on me, so he took it out on his own mate.  He's such a fucking coward. God. I wanna kick something."
"An Alpha does not follow what anyone says but his omega. That is what bonding is. Trusting each other when you don't have anyone else." Steve replied calmly, watching Bucky with an almost curious look in his eye.
Gleason frowned a little.  "Well, no, not necessarily.  We won't know until it heals.  It might heal with his mark, might heal with yours.  Might mix the two. Might just end up as one big mess of scar tissue.  The back of the neck isn't designed to be bitten by more than one Alpha, so it's hard to say what Steve's body will do."
They lapsed back into silence.  It was already late afternoon.  Steve's dinner started in less than four hours, and even with a SHIELD jet or one of Tony's, he was shaping up to be one or two hours late.
Tony's eyes slid over to Steve, glazed, wide with panic.
"Oh! Yes, baby pictures," Peggy said, the thought suddenly returning to her. She reached for a very large box and opened the lid to reveal it was full of photo albums. "For you." She handed Tony a photo album from WWII, which was in fact full of pictures of Steve. And then she handed a different album to Steve himself. "Baby photos," Peggy affirmed, grinning.
It was an unsatisfying answer, Tony knew.
"I would love for you to join," Steve whispered and squeezed Tony's hand, his expression sincere and eyes soft. He stepped forward to press a kiss to Tony's forehead, letting his eyes slip shut for a brief moment. "Sorry I just stole some of Happy's clothes... they probably won't be wearable again.  I stretched the shirt out.  But I wasn't gonna work out naked."
Tony got up again and, unsteadily, made his way after Steve.  Exiting the lounge and going down the curved half-stairs to the elevator (he leaned heavily on the banister, wishing he'd maybe only had two doubles), Tony found their entourage waiting by the elevator.
"You're not going to tell on Tony, are you? Not that I would blame you but I didn't think that was your style."
Steve let out a long breath and swallowed as he let his eyes slip shut entirely. He curled into Tony's touch, his head in his Alpha's lap and hands slowly unfurling from their fists. His shoulders shuddered as the tension bled out of him. "I-" He swallowed. Speaking wasn't so easy. His bottom lip shook. "I-I enjoyed killing him." Steve whispered in Tony's shirt. "People talk about me like I'm such a good person. But I'm not. I enjoyed it. I'd do it again if I got the chance. I'm not-" He sucked in a breath. "I'm not- I'm not good Tony.  That thing, the Tesseract, it brings out the worst in everyone. It's toxic.  What it did to Schmidt's face... it's going to get us killed. Please, you have to believe me."
Boswell reached under his desk and pulled out a large purple orchid.  The audience "awwed."
"You mentioned collars?  What's your opinion on stuff like collars? I imagine it was very different back in the forties."
"Dad never told me Steve was an omega."
Steve hadn't bothered to correct the scientists that they would "bang on their own."  Steve had no intention of having sex with anyone, currently, and it was laughable to think he'd want that in his current condition. He needed to delay the inducer for as long as possible. His gaze slowly crawled back to the blood on the wall:
Steve's own cock was hard and leaking where it was curved against his abdomen. His thighs worked easily as he rode Tony with abandon, fucking himself down a little harder to bring Tony to release.
"Barton," DeSoto said patiently.
Bucky was already in the stairwell.  Steve was fucking heavy; he ducked into level A-2 and slipped into one of the unused conferences rooms, knowing there were no cameras in there.  He knew the layout of every base; it was his job, after all.
Tony's sense of "winning" was quickly fading into guilt.  Was he really this petty? The short answer was yes, of course he was.  Steve's neck was sharing his mark with Bucky's and it infuriated him. But Bucky was out of the picture now.
His plan had accomplished what it meant to; it had showed Donner just how terrible Gideon was.  But at the price of Steve's dignity.
They spent the next two hours on the sofa before Steve finally managed to convince Tony they needed water and food and sleep. He took his round of pills before they both finished off the sandwiches and stumbled into their bedroom. If Steve were less out of it he might have noticed that Pepper had cleaned up but he was dazed and only really had eyes for Tony.
guest we ever had, between you and me, was Bill Murray, who was just darling, remember, Bozzy?"
He hung up.
"Charmed!" said Pepper with a winning smile, managing to sneak in a murderous glare at Tony.  Tony edged over, trying to block his drink from view. Pepper snagged Tony by the elbow. Still smiling, she hissed under her breath, "How many of them have you slept with?"
Tony watched Steve jog down the drive and out of sight.  His "jog" was like a regular person's sprint.  His loping pace was easy, graceful.  He made running look like it was easy and fun.
Steve wandered back and Tony waved him over.  "Look, Steve, the wonder twins have our vacation all ready for us."
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and pulled him over to him; Steve curled into his chest, his body too large to really easily hold.
Why the
!" snapped Tony.  "What the hell am I supposed to do for a fucking week if I'm not allowed in my shop?" demanded Tony.
Steve burst into the infirmary with the fury of a modern-day Hercules.
"...That is really cool," Steve said, surprised at the fact. He knew that omegas were sometimes given guard jobs and the like because they were supposedly less hot-headed than Alphas, but those were usually for private security firms and shopping malls, not
He was in New York.  He'd been on the move continuously since Wanda and Pietro had disposed of him; he went where ever felt right.  His time was dedicated to trying to figure out where Steve was and where Karpov was and who the hell he was. The whole world had a strange, dream-like quality to it, and he floated around searching, feeling like he was trapped in some sort of bizarre waking dream.  Without the medicine, he spent several long nights shaking uncontrollably and vomiting. But sickness, hunger, and cold were not things that could easily stop him. He soldiered on because that was all he could do, all he knew how to do. Giving up or quitting had been programmed out of him.
She let their arms brush together as they walked through the field. Steve was about two steps through the door before Clint was tackling him into a hug. "Hey, hey-- it's okay," he said and then realized that Clint couldn't 'hear' him unless he could see him.
"Oh, so now I'm a sexist
The asset leaned forward.
"We had to have gotten
Pepper reached over and began crossing out items on the list.  "Thank God, that was worse than your no-gluten phase.  Okay, so if you're okay with corn, just make sure to avoid

confidence and charisma.  He knew perfectly well that Howard was an extremely dominant Alpha.
The room he was in was small, practically a cell, his feet almost touching the opposite wall. With a pained grunt he managed to get himself up on his right leg alone. He moved to try and open the door.  Locked. Of course. Steve stared out of the window, at a peek of sunlight streaming up through the clouds.
"Or twenty-six filet mignons."
"...you're not crazy about that idea," said Tony slowly.  He rocked back on his heels. "...Steve... I wouldn't be a good dad.  My old man, he fucked me up, and imagine what I'd do to a kid. Besides, I'm already in my forties..."  Tony was making excuses now. His own father had been even older when he'd had Tony. Tony backtracked. "...I don't think my lifestyle would be... conducive... I mean... I wouldn't want... I wouldn't want a kid who would turn out like me," he finished, looking away.
"Can't you control him, when I'm in heat?"
Only Tony got to see him like that. Steve just hoped his Alpha understood the gravity of that fact. Tony's reputation was enduring. Scandal after scandal, and he still remained. Steve's reputation, on the other hand, felt like it was fragile, like one push too far and he'd go tumbling down. Steve needed to build up his defenses before they started their onslaught- of course the attacks on him had already begun. But once his relationship with his Alpha was dragged out into the public eye things were only going to get worse.  It was a lot harder to maintain a reputation of purity than a reputation of moral superiority.

to know that Steve was his.  He wanted to keep his neck covered in marks, keep him smelling like sex, and keep him within an arm's reach for a while, demonstrate to everyone that Steve was
Having heard nothing from Dr. Gleason, Tony had decided he should probably go get that vasectomy.  It could be his Christmas present to himself.
"Oh, no, thank you, I take it black... sit with us, Mr. Coulson, please--"
Tony looked over at George with curiosity; George's grin widened.  "Force-bonded," he almost sang, pointing to his neck with a sort of morbid pride.
Clint woke up to a strange blue light in their bedroom. It was 4 am. He groaned and sat up, rubbing at his eyes with the heels of his palms. He blinked slowly to see Natasha sat the desk against the wall, staring at the blue computer screen before her. She didn't look like she'd slept, her eyes almost watering.
"...can we at least drop Beth?"
The tracker on their ankles was so light it was easy to forget it was there. But the stark black plastic against Steve's pale skin was quite startling. It stood out. It reminded Steve of what he'd done every waking moment. He moved to pick at the plastic but then looked up when Tony placed a plate of slightly charred bacon and egg in front of him. "Thank you Tony," he said, sounding sleepy as he reached for his fork.  "Gleason's coming on Sunday and then that's it. He says I don't need anymore check ups," Steve said between mouthfuls. "That's good, right?"
"Acers."
"No, you just said--"
Steve nodded and let Aria take his hand when she reached for it, leading him back the stairs like a mother might a child. "You rebel. Stepping outside three hours early..." She was tipsy. He could tell. Aria didn't usually make jokes.
"Super healing, remember?" Steve pointed out and watched Tony worriedly from afar.
The recruits fell quiet then, clearly not knowing what to say. This probably wasn't how they imagined meeting him would be like, Steve figured but he was not in the mood for niceties. He could see all the questions in their eyes that they were too polite to ask and he had no intention of answering them.
Someone had offered to buy Steve. Once. His ma was struggling and he'd just turned sixteen. A gentleman came round. He looked smart, wore a pressed suit with pin stripes and had his hair slicked back. He was a beta- Steve thought so anyway. The memory was hazy and unimportant. His mother had been outraged and pushed him out of the house, hitting at his coat with a flour coated rolling pin. It had been a beautiful sight but a chilling thought. Steve knew his mother would have never done it - but how many omegas had been sold and what happened to them? Did they want a mate or just something to screw with and then toss away? Or would he have been kept like a pet?
"Yeah, taking out a few stragglers. What are we gonna do? How is Cap?"
on the run, it would be wrong.  It would feel like I was taking advantage of you," he pointed out and watched Bucky finish up with the car. They should have been going but then Bucky was pulling him into a hug and he couldn't stop himself from leaning into it.
Steve sighed and looked around, his brow pinching together. "I dunno if I can do this..."
Tony reached out and ran a rough, calloused hand over Steve's thigh.  He tried to catch Steve's eye.  Get some sort of affirmation that, yes, Steve was on board, Steve wanted to be taken.  Because Tony had a weird idea, somehow, that this was more than just sex and that it meant something.  He wasn't sure what.  But whatever it was, it was big.  He knew it subconsciously.  On the surface, his thoughts were static; the smell of Steve's arousal and the blue of his eyes and the curves of his body had thrown a wrench into the inner workings of Tony's brain and he was surprised he was able to speak at all.
Natasha had tied a bandanna over her face; Tony snorted.  "What, are you going to rob a stagecoach later?" he asked, hackles rising immediately.
.  I wanna be
"Uh... single-malt whiskey," said Tony.  "Maybe it was Dramboie? I don't remember.  Dad gave it to me when I was eight."
Steve laughed, genuinely. He wasn't quite sure if Banksy was being serious, but his smile was warm.
"What, you gonna throw me through another wall?  Talk to me, man.  What's been eating at your lately?  This whole lone gunslinger, every-man-for-himself situation- it's not working for you.  I'm here as your friend.  Not as a liaison or a government puppet.  I'm here 'cause I still care about you, even though, lately, you've been a real pain in my ass. I want to help, Tony."
probably be some form of torture," he warned him quietly.  "We could always sneak in today and give a test run, let you have a small taste of it to see how you feel about the real thing. Then that still gives you a week to prepare," Steve suggested tentatively.  "Speaking of that," he looked over at the clock hung up on his wall. "We have about half an hour before we have to leave."
He tried not to look alarmed.
"Doctor Branzinski is free to see you now, if you can stomach it."
He hoped they remembered to tell Karpov he was here because overwise he was going to be in big, big trouble when he failed to return to his handler.
Piper was looking at Steve with undisguised interest. He was the total opposite of her, aside from their hair color. But when he tried to meet her gaze she just stared at the floor. Steve's gut twisted comfortably. Would all the omegas be like this? So-- it felt mean to think it, but--
Pepper grabbed Tony's head and pointed it toward one of the screens.  Tony stared, confused.  Justin had managed to get cleaned up fairly nicely, and he was just finishing what sounded like a fairly confident speech.  "--very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes!"
"Tony, I would
The soldier stared up; the omega's sharp blue eyes stared down.  His target, the blond, was mere feet from him!  If he was fast enough, he could grab him.  But he wasn't fast enough.  The blond was faster, he knew that already.  He continued to stare at him.  He'd never met anyone like this before.  He was incredible.  And an omega.  There was a strange feeling inside him.  It wasn't frustration (like when he missed a shot) or elation (like when he hit a target).  It was in his stomach and throat and, yes, maybe a little bit between his legs.  ...fear, maybe?  Was this what fear felt like?  Karpov had once told him that fear was probably the most powerful and primal emotion in the whole world.  But he couldn't feel fear.  And if this was fear, he was confused, because he sort of liked it.
Steve leaned into Tony's touch automatically, his eyes slowly slipping shut. He sighed softly and hummed, turning to look at Tony. He looked stressed, concerned. Maybe Steve should tell him, but he didn't know how without freaking him the hell out.
Steve looked miserable; Natasha looked... sympathetic?  Sad?  Actually, both of them had weird expressions and Tony couldn't really interpret them.  He wasn't sure why they were behaving like this, because it all made sense to Tony.  Steve felt guilt that a guy had died under his command, a guy he was close to, a guy named Bucky who fell to his death, who looked Steve in the eye right as he fell.  A guy whose photo Steve kept on his fridge, a constant reminder.  God, it was so tragic.  Tony untangled their hands and placed a hand on the back of Steve's neck to draw the omega to him, wanting to soothe him.
Tony stared at him, lost.  Flowers? ...Steve got him flowers?
? Steve felt silently horrified with himself. If Frond had told him to kneel in that moment as she pulled away he probably would have considered it. She manipulated his own body against him. Is that what she did with her own omegas?
why I called them.  This wasn't about you."
sense if Bucky is dead right?  Now you have Tony. It makes no sense."
He and Tony were lying in the bed, their hands tangled together.  They were alone, except for Tiberius, who was sitting beside the bed gently wiping sweat from Steve's forehead with a wet washcloth.
, he thought vaguely, not sure what that meant or why he was thinking it.
Oh, God. Steve was dying from embarrassment. He was bright red and hiding his face into a pillow. "Oh,
"I believe Mr. Rogers is too far along. It wouldn't be safe," Phil offered quietly to cover up the fact that Steve's metabolism wouldn't allow it. The needle was already tucked back away into his jacket.
. The difference is, you could be a product of your situation, and you might be happy... and even if you screw up along the way then it's okay, because
"It really is," Steve agreed softly.
As usual, Tony's monologue was truly that, a monologue.  Tony thought much faster than he spoke, so at times, his sentences came out disjointed, with each pause representing probably a paragraph's worth of thought that Tony had dismissed as unimportant.  Pepper in particular was good at picking up each individual thesis statement and dissecting it. Reading between the lines was a fundamental part of communication with Tony, because when it came to anything abstract, he tended to make mince-meat of normal conversation, and the sentences didn't always connect well.  Happy said it was because he was a genius, and Pepper said it was because he couldn't stand discussing his emotions any deeper than that.

"That's not... oh no..."
. his old Alpha.  But Barnes is dead.  And, at the same time, suddenly, Steve's feeling the Winter Soldier.  What if-- follow me here, this is so macabre-- what if HYDRA recovered Barnes's body and they took the gland out of the back of his neck and they put it into the Winter Soldier and that's why he smells like Barnes to Steve and also why Steve is confused and thinks they're connected?"
Steve didn't just spent a lot of time going in and out of court, of course.  He also spent time working for Fury.  He was still, at heart, a soldier.  But he and Tony didn't talk about that much. Tony knew full fell where Steve was going when he dressed in all black and took a scary amount of gear with him. But Steve knew his Alpha didn't want to think about him killing or hurting people, so they just didn't talk about it.
Clint was not sure if he had mentioned he had a brother to Steve or not.  He suspected he had; it was not a secret. Phil, a fellow omega in the agency, also knew.  Steve had brought it up before, saying they'd spoken with one of his brother's ex-Alphas, but that meant nothing to Clint.  By the time he began trying to track down his brother, the trail was cold. They had been separated as teenagers. It had been about two decades.  He had pushed that part of his his past deep, deep down.
"He was our
"So, Stark Jr."
Natasha didn't bother asking Tony to get a grip; he was clearly incapacitated.  He was on his hands and knees, head hung, spitting quietly on the concrete floor.  He was in the midst of a relatively quiet but nonetheless devastating flashback.
He knew his personality, actually. He knew how stubborn and uptight Steve could be. How proud. How 'uppity'. But he didn't know who he was. And suddenly Steve felt guilty for that. He never expected Tony to develop feelings for him...he never expected them to be mutual. Shit. When SHIElD arrived behind them Steve was almost grateful he was saved from having to know what to say.
"Okay, c'mon," said Sam.
"Tony?" Steve said softly after an hour has passed. There was snow in Tony's hair, stark white against the chocolate brown. "It's getting cold out."
Tony glanced over at Steve, searching for his approval.  Strictly speaking, Steve
"AM NEARLY GOT KILLED AT YOUR BIRTHDAY."
But this now meant that Steve had nothing to lose. Gideon had already done the worst thing possible to Donner. So he stood up, right in front of Gideon, delighted at how much taller he was.
"SHIELD isn't happy about this and neither is the DoD, considering what went down on his birthday."
"Huh." Steve processed the information curiously. His mind drifted a little. He knew Tony's securities were rooted in a lot of issues, some of them relating to Howard. But it didn't help that Steve was a super soldier, who was kind of huge and made of muscle and intimidating to most Alphas out there.
He gave his hand a tiny tug.
Welp, couldn't get worse than that, at least.
Tony gave Steve a thumbs-up from the floor.  "Good thing I was wearing my helmet," he said weakly.
"Fred!  That's a terrible thing to say!" said Lola.
"Love you, 'mega," said Tony, giving Steve's hand a squeeze.
"But I did," he echoed. "For you. I don't know. Maybe a part of me was mad at myself for doing it, but it felt as simple as breathing. And for the first time ever, since I woke up in this place, I felt like maybe...
He waited, listening intently as the soldier got closer. As Bucky got closer. Was there a difference between them? Time to find out.
Right.  Still drunk.
It was like being drunk, Steve realized. Not a sensation he'd felt much since getting the serum.  Being bitten on the back of the neck had been the final straw for him; he was so chock-full of hormones that he felt like the whole world was coming in through a dreamlike haze, and it was difficult to parse out what was happening.  He tried to push himself to sit up but he couldn't quite make it. He frowned. "Buck. I can't-- I don't know-- how did we end up here?"
If you stick with us long enough, I can guarantee 100% that Tony will someday get into a fist fight with Pitbull.  For those wondering, their long-standing argument is over who came up with the nickname "Mr. Worldwide." - T
Steve watched Bucky collapse in on himself and writhe in apparent agony with an odd kind of gleam in his eyes. He knew exactly what Bucky was feeling; the sensation ached in his own chest. Steve had felt it once too; every night when Bucky had brought girls home, pushing his hands away from him.  Yes, he'd felt it.  He knew it well.
And, while he was thinking about it:
Steve's phone pinged across the table. A text from Natasha. He grabbed it and frowned:
Banjo was one of the younger ones and she almost had a spring in her step as they walked out of the kitchens, presumably excited by the morning's events. Steve figured it was worth a shot.
"I can't.  I'm tired now."
There had been a picture of Steve and his father in the study, too.  Weird that Tony had stared into the face of his mate since childhood without knowing.  It was like an episode of
Stern was studying him closely, his hang-dog face a perfect portrait of his name.  "...I guess it's true.  Bonding really does change a man."
Steve's smell was Steve's again.  The Steve Tony had bonded, his omega,
"--we call them the walking dead."
Steve tried to approach Donner after dinner; he didn't look happy about it. "Hey," he said. "People over there were saying Gideon 'lost' you in poker for nine nights. Is that true?"
"Where?" pressed Karpov, taking the picture.
"Probably only a myth," said Pietro dismissively.  "Once Stark is dead, we should return to Sokovia."
"...thanks," he said finally, softly.  He felt a little choked up and he was stone-cold sober.  A dangerous place to be.
wouldn't try to kill Tony.  But his old mate would. Tony stole his omega," pointed out Pepper. She looked up at the expressionless mask of the Mark VI.  "Stand down, Six."
Steve swallowed.
Tony looked up when he heard Steve in the closet.
"Did I say loser?  I meant remarkable specimen of a human being."
"I'm not talking about trios, Natasha. But I'm also not willing to abandon someone whose been my friend my entire life even if he did..." Steve trailed off. People forgot Steve had known Bucky since he could remember. They hadn't always been bonded and fighting each other, and even once they were bonded, they had good days. Very good days. Bucky had been a part of his life longer than anyone else had. "He needs me now. More than--"
Rhodes rolled his eyes.  "I feel like I'm in bizarro land.  Next thing you'll wanna be cuddling me."
"Tony?"
Hal walked over with her Alpha in line. Her Alpha was older, had dark wavy hair, and wore yellow glasses that framed her face nicely. "Pleasure to meet you Captain, Mr. Stark," she said, voice terribly soft. "I'm Steph."
Steve ran his things through his hair again. "But if this is about being
"You can say that again," Lola winked over her wine glass. Steve didn't like to think about what
The door open and Gleason waltzed in.  "I'm back-- where is he? Ah. Hello, Steve.  Steve?"
That clearly wasn't the answer the woman was after but Steve seriously didn't want people turning to him. It's not like he was assaulted, per se, which most people in his situation would have been. Honestly that made his whole status as 'force bonded' feel almost invalid, in some ways.
"Was FDR a... a real dominant Alpha?"
"Can you play some music?  How about
"JARVIS, what's new?" he called.
do it?  Back in his own century, every omega wanted to bear whelps for their Alpha.  Steve had, too.  Throwing away a baby seemed wrong to him.  But how the hell could he have a baby in this day and age, when he didn't know a damn thing?  When he barely understood how the world around him worked?
"Certainly, sir," said JARVIS
The basement of the school wasn't a proper basement, not really.  The floor was still lovely tile and there were still paintings hung on the walls and on one wall of the corridor were small, narrow windows on the upper part of the wall, flush with the ground.  The early morning sun was providing them with some natural light. The basement was not an unpleasant place.
His dad's stupid little tape had been nice and all, but one pre-recorded "I love you" didn't exactly make up for hundreds of drunken, furious nights of raised hackles and raised voices and, yes, occasionally raised fists.
He examined the page critically.
"You too," Steve said softly. Sam offered a small nod.
that would be fantastic," said Pepper politely, somehow managing to inject just the right amount of venom into her voice.
It was a nonsense word.
Tony listened to the vibrations of Steve's chest, the deepness of his voice, and was so absorbed in the sound he almost missed the meaning of the words.  He blinked, processing the words.
"Captain America?! Captain America? Who bonded you in Yemen? Did you know him?!"
," he told him quietly, voice almost terrifyingly sincere before he took the hint and moved further down. That was a conversation for a time...not like this.
Tony waited for Steve to obey before pulling off his sweatpants.  "Over," he commanded, climbing onto the sofa, a knee on either side of Steve.  He grabbed Steve's wrists and leaned down to lick the back of his neck.  Steve's body healed ridiculously quickly, but Tony's bite mark had left a raised scar.  The texture of Steve's skin on his tongue was incredible; Tony growled possessively, happily, lapping at his mark, his omega, the two pink crescents on Steve's neck a physical sign of their bond.
. Steve groaned, loudly, as some old woman poked and prodded at his back. The sensation was heavenly; he should have done this sooner. Hell, Steve thought, he should do this every week. Tony was next to him, having the same thing done but he was only distantly aware of it...it was just him and Josephine's hands, as far as Steve was concerned.
"As long as Steve doesn't mind," Pepper said.
"...why would I?" he asked softly.  "...it would only bum everyone out.  First I thought... maybe I could... fix it myself.  Then I realized I couldn't.  But I didn't want anyone to be sad, acting weird around me."  He shrugged slightly.  "It's okay now," he added.  "It's nearly over.  Sorry, Stan.  Don't worry, I left you a generous severance package.  Everything is taken care of."  He shifted his weight, the suit moving with him, the motors whirring softly.  He wondered if Rhodes had gotten the suit somewhere safe yet.  He had about ten suits.  All but one had been calibrated for Rhodey.  That ought to keep the world safe for a long, long time.
Eventually, Steve somehow fell back to sleep there on the floor with Ty running a hand up and down his arm. With a large huff Tiberius managed to lift him back onto the bed and rolled him over to Tony's side. Steve was still shivering a little, but sleeping off the blindness seemed to be the best way to deal with it.
The elevator took them to the basement and Tony led them through a series of unmarked hallways, deep into the heart of the building.  The floor was poured concrete and the bulbs were fluorescent.  There were no decorations here.  It was clear this space was not intended for much use.
The duvet was thick and bunched up around him. Steve picked at the white fabric lazily, focusing on the fibers close to his face. "Peggy's birthday is in a month. We should visit her. She'd love it," he whispered, aware that making plans so far ahead implied stability. Steve was here to stay.
He threw back the coffee, wincing, and tore into the bathroom to shave, cursing SHIELD quietly under his breath for making him do things in the mornings.
Then JARVIS's voice broke the quiet. "There's an incoming call, sir."
Except that, he noticed, the omegas were only listed by number.  Number Twelve was previously a Miss Teen Illinois. Tony looked up to the stage to try to pick her out.  It was easy. She was gorgeous. The omegas were lined up along the back of the stage, preening each other.  Most looked hopefully nervous. Some looked miserable. Some just looked blank. Tony had the bizarre thought that it was like watching a bunch of kids about to perform in a school play.  Except no, they were getting sold, literally sold. Force-bonded.
"I'm Brooke," she said,  leaning onto the counter, hair tumbling down and cleavage popping.
He smiled sleepily and walked in to offer Steve his good hand.  Steve looked shaken up, but determined; he had that steely Cap look in his eye.  The one that meant he wanted to punch something. Tony was honestly a bit surprised he wasn't already in the gym, beating the crap out of a punching bag.  Steve went through several week, an expense that Pepper had not overlooked and had found thoroughly amusing.
Donner sniffed. "O-Okay."
Tony sat down, still feeling numb.  "Today's our anniversary," he said weakly.
should've told you... c'mere."
"I see you and me, sharing a romantic dinner."
"Is this the sex thing again?" Steve looked like he wanted the floor to eat him alive.  Aria bit back a smile.
"I see two design flaws."
Then Steve's heat hit and all those misgivings were out the window.
Shit, this was all so complicated, what was he thinking?
"It's okay. Come on Tony, fill me up." He threw his head back. "You always do it so
Thor responded, far too seriously for a stupid email threat.
Tony’s head had dropped back down to his arms already, but he shook with laughter. Natasha threw a butter knife at his head.
Steve was far too smug on the ride to Transylvania. Tony was not saying that vampires were magic, although Steve seemed to thing that in agreeing to go he was admitting defeat, but the scientist knew when he was outclassed in tech. Right now he needed to gather more data if he wanted to help Natasha, and that data was in Transylvania. His mind was racing with possibilities, maybe nanotech, as he listened to Steve explain his history with the vampires. He couldn’t believe in all of Howard’s tales of the war and the great Captain America, he had never mentioned this. Maybe he had been just as skeptical as Tony, and didn’t want to address it.
he asked, hoping the guy new what he meant.
Clint nearly lurched forward as if struck with a blow,
he smiled wryly. Steve knew there was nothing he could say, so he just squeezed Tony’s hand.
Steve drained his tiny cup of water, which was really maybe two gulps.
Tony had been healthy when the alarm sounded, but when did the symptoms start? Tony’s performance in battle had been stellar as usual, definitely not noticeably impaired. His voice had sounded slightly strained on the comm when he asked for a plan of attack, but Steve had figured it was because he was flying in circles and shooting while he spoke. There certainly hadn’t been worry in the tone. Maybe it wasn’t severe yet at that point? Once they had started the plan though, Tony had been busy taunting MODOK. There was a moment when Tony had turned off his comm, as he did when talking to JARVIS. That conversation had to have some clues. JARVIS never let Tony risk his health without fair warning and often had to be ordered to allow Tony’s actions.
Tony suddenly felt kind of cold. Was he so transparent that an eight year old could read him like this? He had never wanted Peter to be the one teaching everyone else how to be. It was his job to teach Peter, but he often found himself learning more than teaching.
he finished quickly on a mumble, hoping the woman would just let it be.
He shrugged. Explaining out loud did make him feel better. It was surprising. Right, talking was better than drinking and avoidance. JARVIS told him that all the time, not that Tony ever listened.
He pulled it out to see an email forwarded from JARVIS. Steve began reading it aloud,
They practiced for hours. Tony was surprisingly promising for a novice, but he struggled to hold the arrow back without shaking, which made aim difficult.
the spirit spoke. Clint felt like he might pass out, forgetting entirely about the rest of the room or the mission at hand. He hadn’t heard his mother’s voice in so long, and it felt all consuming. If you had asked him if he even remembered what Edith Barton sounded like a week ago, he would’ve told you he had no idea. He had accepted the loss of even the memory of the woman long ago, hating his father for her death. The man was such a worthless drunk, it had definitely been his fault when they died in the car crash. She had been a meek woman, unwilling to stand up to Harold despite the fact that she clearly cared about her sons.
Clint cleared his throat.
the Mandarin said. Tony watched him pace.
It got the genius thinking. A lot of the games children played, at least from what he had learned second hand, were useful for team building and built physical skills for the real world. Even mentally, the games, like hide and seek, six flags, lazer tag, they seemed to build a good basis for tactical thinking. Tony had been thinking about adding another extension to the Maria Stark Foundation, but maybe under his own name finally, where he helped addicts and ex-convict learn the skills and build new networks to fit back into society. It seemed like the least he could do given the very broken rehabilitation system of the United States since he wasn’t willing to run for office. No matter what anyone said, it absolutely wasn’t a way of admitting his own addiction problems. Yeah. If he told himself that enough, he might even start believing it. Anyways, maybe his program could include games like this. He made sure JARVIS took note of the passing idea to remind him later.
Frank was extra alert the rest of the night. He did not want a repeat of that embarrassment. He didn’t understand the story of the opera, which might have been because he couldn’t see it, but the moment Maria’s voice hit him again, he knew. She had certainly been right, the song before was nothing compared to this one. This beautiful woman with an angelic voice seemed to naturally be able to calm his constant agitation, and Frank found himself not wanting to leave that behind for the night. Their admittedly limited interaction hinted at a sharp and kind personality under all the makeup as well. The sense of humor was certainly there.
The static in the air was palpable. Thor could be terrifying sometimes.
he remembered sourly.
The Diggers voice was clear in Jessica’s ears. It made no sense given how thick this trap had to be to hold her in. It took a few more moments of the story for her to realize that she had small speakers in her ears. She pulled one out, but could hear her murderer regardless.
Jane reached up and held his hand in her much smaller hand.
Natasha tucked her hair behind her ears while she collected her thoughts.
The piercing scream through the air was his own, but he felt like an outsider, looking down on the scene. One of the other officers was the one holding him back, and the same officer was the one lowering him slowly to the ground when he crumpled. His family was dead. The firefighters were only working to keep the flames contained, letting it burn itself out. Even Frank could see that they were right to do so. There’s no way anyone was alive in there; the fire was clearly started with an accelerant.
he spoke casually. Clint reached down and intertwined hands with Phil.
The Hulk bounded for the Mandarin, roaring with anger that his best friend was hurt. He felt the crunch beneath his left fist as he was nearing his foe and he turned around in confusion. There on the floor was Tony, crushed beneath the weight of the Hulk. That didn’t make any sense; Tony had been up on the wall. Suddenly he was Bruce again as his shaking hands touched Tony’s face. It was real; there was no illusion. Bruce felt for a pulse but there was none, Tony’s body was lifeless. He had been breathing when they arrived, Bruce was sure of it. Bruce’s mind stuttered to a halt; what had he done? It had finally happened. He had killed his best friend.
There is injection of drugs in this, it's not an addiction situation, but be wary of your own triggers.
She chewed on her pen thoughtfully. It was probably a bad habit to have in the medical field, especially at a hospital or SHIELD medical, her newest job.
He moved to stand but fell back as the room spun.
she said over her shoulder.
cutting right to Tony’s core. That was the problem when someone knew you as well as Ty knew him, they could use your fears and weaknesses against you.
Steve agreed.
Phil draped his tie over an open drawer beside their bed, quietly changing out of his suit so he could relax around the tower.
Tony let his boyfriend help him up but dodged the pity hug. He didn’t feel like getting Steve’s comfort right now.
JARVIS sounded pitying. Tony picked up the lamp that was wrapped in his stupid invention, a rubbery self adhesive that sought heat so it’d curve around bodies to get to their body-heat, the ‘flex cage’ he had been so proud of only moments ago. He hurled the lamp across the room, where it shattered against the wall. He had been so certain of his revenge this year! Then he had been taken down by an air horn. What kind of a genius couldn’t out plan Clint Barton?
The corner of her lips twitched into a near smile, the false memories bittersweet. She sometimes wish they were real, because they were much nicer than her reality.
Steve was still inspecting the cave, looking for any signs that a predator was using it as a den at night. He didn’t see anything, and they needed to get some firewood while there was still some light out if they didn’t want to spend the night in total darkness.
Steve felt warmth spread through his chest and he kissed the top of Tony’s head. Tony was hardly ever the one to initiate an ‘I love you.’ Steve had just accepted the emotional constipation and wariness of affection as part of being with Tony long ago. If he had to explain it, Steve would guess it’s what came from having cold, distant parents and a string of trusted loved ones betraying you.
he stopped short. Tony was on his knees, shaky breaths in between heaving sobs wracking his small frame. The smears and streams down his face were of blood, and the man was clearly not present. Steve waved a hand in front of Tony’s face, but he didn’t even blink. Steve knelt down beside him, terrified and unsure what to do. The car was gone, someone must’ve taken it after they left him like this, but what did they do!? Tony’s pained gasp urged Steve through the fear, and he put a hand on the man’s shoulder. He shook it violently, screaming at Tony to please wake up. It took several minutes before the man blinked hard, and seemed to suddenly become aware of his surroundings.
She stood, looking at all of them.
This solidified Clint’s theory from the day before. Tony was an actual mad man.
Steve asked out of the blue. Tony looked up at him, confused.
Steve warned. It almost always got like this if Dr. Strange or Reed Richards was involved.
he sighed.
Clint asked, browsing the shelves of the display case.
A single tear fell down his cheek. This couldn’t be real, she wouldn’t fall for this. He never came back good. He was always back to kill her, or to use her. If he was really back, then she wouldn’t know what to do.
Tony replied warmly.
Steve said drily.
He stood up and began to walk away.
Faking arachnophobia? Clint hadn’t been trying to hide his reactions to spiders, he had been pretending to hide a fake reaction. He screamed and reacted even when alone just to be sure. It was the most intense double-bluff Tony had ever seen.
Clint raised an eyebrow, the only change in his blank expression.
She shook her head, smiling down at him.
Tony wasn’t sure how to take the way Steve’s face crumpled, and the fact that his head was suddenly laying against Tony’s head while he cried. So Tony just played with Steve’s hair and waited. He knew what being the one waiting beside a hospital bed felt like. Eventually, Steve came back to himself.
Tony stared at her, letting the weirdness of that diagnosis settle in.
Peter and Wade let out a collective sigh of relief. They were going to get chewed out enough as it is, they didn’t need a lecture from J too.
Tony surprised him with a sharp laugh.
Peter stood and faced his pops. Steve was prepared for a hug, but Peter didn’t hug him. Instead he grew very serious.
Tony grimaced.
No one saw Bruce move, but the sound of the door slamming open and the glass of the window breaking announced his departure. Steve thought he might have seen a glimpse of the retreating man looking dangerously green and big.
Steve guessed it took them about three hours to reach the riverbed. He kneeled to drink some water. The daylight was waning, and they needed to find somewhere to camp out for the night.
Thor shouted.
Steve was hit with the stench first. Tony had clearly been forced to sit in his own excretions, and the man’s gaze was unfocused. He lurched forward, wasting no time slamming the shield over the lock and cutting the ropes binding Tony. Tony groaned and it might have been an attempt at saying Steve, and Steve caught him as he fell sideways off the chair.
Bruce placed another water bottle on the worktop.
He punched the offending sheet of metal with his injured hand. The bruising pain released some of the tension thrumming through him. Staring at the dent he left, Tony decided it was time to take a break from this project.
Clint brought his fist down hard on the table.
Steve decided.
Steve said sharply.
he gestured to the opening elevator doors. Tony walked out in a huff, and he wasn’t, most definitely wasn’t pouting. Steve laughed and set the baklava down on the table as he plopped down on the couch. Tony immediately pounced on him, planting kisses along Steve’s clavicle. Steve made a low, needy groan and started at Tony’s shirt buttons, stopping to touch his hand over the beautiful, blue glow of the reactor. Tony tensed but immediately forced himself to relax. He’d come such a long way since the first time they had tried to have sex and Steve was proud. Steve had touched the reactor triggering a flashback for Tony, and he had had a full blown panic attack. Steve had to sit with him for two hours before Tony was able to talk about Obadiah and his heart being ripped from his chest by someone he had trusted. Who wouldn’t have trust issues after that?
Steve clenched his fists until his nails were digging into his palms. Tony already had a bad heart, what if it was too damaged now? Tony would never be okay with taking it easy for the rest of his life. Being Iron Man was too important to him. Despite Steve’s best efforts, Tony refused to believe he had any value in the world beyond being a hero. He conveniently ignores his stunning intellect and overflowing generosity that makes the world a better place.
Tony finally asked. The question sounded like an accusation to Steve; like it shouldn’t matter.
Tony shuddered at the thought of having Strange in his head, but it was better than possibly having the Mandarin in there.
Steve was baffled that such a young dame was calling him honey.
Exactly 48 hours after the first email, the second one arrived. The string of nonsense making up the sending email was different, but JARVIS picked it out because of the similar tone and the signature ‘A Citizen in Need.’ If JARVIS had eyes, he’d roll them. Clearly this person was in so much need, that’s why they were asking for $2M with the technology to hide their IP address instead of panhandling on the streets. Everyone knew Tony Stark was a philanthropist, that his money helped plenty of actual citizens in need through the Maria Stark Foundation, but this guy chose to threaten his master for money instead.
The king of vampires felt the grin form on his face, his first smile in centuries. Red Skull did take a step back this time, the sight of the fanged grin on the ancient being’s face was unexpectedly terrifying. Schmidt thought he had stopped fearing most things the world had to offer.
he cried out miserably.
He ignored Steve’s muttered ‘language.’
he decided.
Bruce’s cheeks turned pink.
Natasha waited for their attention to return before she went on.
Tony felt something swell inside, and he suddenly felt less sad and anxious. If he could be enough for someone like Steve Rogers, maybe that was good enough. Maybe he could just do his best. He’d have to think on it some more, but for tonight, this was enough.
Madame whatever-her-name-was (Amora didn’t care) may be the expert in human Voodoo here, but Amora knew her gods.
she moved forward, reaching for his wrist.
Sometimes Tony’s unwillingness to acknowledge the supernatural was too much for Steve. He didn’t blame them all for not buying the story immediately, although they had just seen plenty of proof, right? But Tony was pulling his usual magic is just science we don’t understand yet speech out, and it didn’t matter right now. As if to make Steve’s point for him Natasha suddenly awoke with a scream, flipping into the air and easily kicking their asses. Her already usually fast and fluid movements were faster now, and the supernatural aura about her was clear as day. How could the genius not see what was right in front of him?
Peter looked between them, confused. He plopped down onto the blanket.
she explained simply.
he whined.
Steve plucked Tony’s empty glass from his free hand so the man could take the new one Clint was trying to hand him. He got a kiss on the cheek for his efforts.
Tony looked around at the others. Bruce just gave him a pitying look as though the answer should be obvious. No one else even attempted to answer him, going back to their own activities.
Natasha got an opening and flipped Steve onto the mat. WHO PAST-KNOW W-A-N-D-A CHAOS MAGIC ACCIDENTS USEFUL SOMETIMES? She signed.
JARVIS asked.
Bruce knelt at Strange’s side, checking for a pulse, and Steve rolled the armor over, finding the latch for the face plate with muscle memory.
They settled into their seats after Clint packed everything in.
Coulson sighed. When everyone looked at him, clearly expecting more, he elaborated,
Steve had nearly passed out when Stone finally confessed where Tony was. It wasn’t a disappointed surrender to the situation. Tiberius Stone was bragging, as though he was confident Tony was already dead. The thought had robbed Steve of his breath. Natasha had had to catch him before he hit the ground as his knees gave out. Tony couldn’t be dead. He couldn’t.
The bitterness laced through his words. It did give them something in common, Tony knew it. He probably drank too much. But he never piloted the armour drunk, didn’t put others at risk, and that was good enough for him.
Straightening his tie in the mirror, day 21 of the experiment, Tony inspected his face one last time. His goatee was perfect today.
Steve wasted no time ripping the chains off the cuffs around Tony’s extremities. He scooped up the dying man and sprinted back the way they came. Dracula’s minions screeched in surprise and tried to attack them, swooping down in every hallway, but Steve just jumped out of the way each time and kept running. By the time he reached the jet, he had a whole horde behind him to be caught in the UV rays shooting out of the doorway to the jet. He’s glad he had thought to turn those on at the last moment, just in case.
Tony may have his flaws and vices, but most of them were the fault of the people around him who should have taught him better. Of course he bore some responsibility, but he is a genuinely good man. Tony had had to learn how to deal with the hardships of life all by himself at too young an age, save for his butler Jarvis. No wonder he named his AI after Jarvis. That was the closest he got to a parental figure, and that was so little because Jarvis had too many other duties to attend to. Tony’s unhappiness with life, his alcoholism, his awful childhood; the causes always eventually could be traced back to Steve. Steve couldn’t blame him for being so harsh when they first met; not after he realized all of that.
Steve kissed Tony deeply, while unzipping Tony’s pants. He kissed a line down Tony’s abs as he pulled the rest of Tony’s clothing off. A growl tore through Tony’s throat as Steve kissed the tip of Tony’s penis, pinning Tony’s hips down when he tried to squirm. Steve then started kissing along Tony’s inner thigh, loving to see Tony need him the way Steve needed Tony.
he scrubbed a hand over his face.
he was torn.
Steve sat up with a sigh, taking in the new surroundings. Tony’s suit had stopped working as soon as it passed through the portal, so he was peeling off the useless metal in pieces. They were sitting in a thick forest. Steve could see nothing but trees in every direction, and didn’t even hear running water. He pulled out his cell phone and found that it, too, had become a useless brick. Apparently Loki’s portal ruined electronics. At least Tony’s arc reactor seemed unaffected.
Steve sighed heavily.
The sound of shattering glass against the castle’s stone walls scared away some of his minions lurking in the shadowy corner. Dracula roared in frustration. No matter how many times he played through the events with the Avengers in his head, he could only come to one conclusion. Anthony Edward Stark had ruined him. Even if the gamma radiation had been what decided the battle, the scientist had destroyed his his remaining chance when he figured out a way to cure Natasha without Dracula releasing her. It was supposed to be impossible. Nothing was more powerful than Dracula’s hold on one of his own, personally created, vampires.
she whispered.
Steve listened to the explanation, awed.
He pulled Steve towards him, and Steve leaned his head towards Tony. Tony kissed his forehead and they leaned their foreheads together.
He put the comm back in as he ran towards the north end, hearing be damned.
Thor beamed.
Giving up on that idea she pulled out her cell phone. It didn’t even get through the second ring.
Natasha was nodding in agreement. Tony thought it was just because the two of them were buddies, so she always sided with him.
He made his way down to the lab where they thawed Steve the last time, hoping that's where Phil was. As he rounded the last corner he saw Phil leaning against the wall, his head tilted back and eyes closed, just outside the door to the lab. He looked exhausted.
They sat in silence for a long moment, each looking up at the lunar eclipse and thinking about different things, but all about family. Peter let out a soft sigh.
Steve loved the lopsided smile Tony had, his real smile. How could anyone really expect him to keep quiet when people harassed the man? Tony was a hero and Steve’s best friend. They might even be bordering on something more, with the flirtatious dance they’d been doing around each other lately. Steve thought he’d probably like that. He would be a great boyfriend for Tony. He’d shower him with all the love and adoration the man deserved.
At the sound of Clint's footsteps (the sound he made sure to make) Phil opened his eyes, a tired smile creeping across his face.
There it was, a flash of guilt and pain across Steve’s face, gone in a split second. Clint was trained to see micro-expressions like that, or he probably wouldn’t have caught it.
Clint pulled out his SHIELD badge.
Natasha and Clint both gave one nod and walked out, presumably to prepare or something, Tony doesn’t know how these spy things work.
Steve thought.
He flicked aside the arrow Hawkeye shot without a second thought, then one of his rings glowed and Hawkeye stilled. He made Steve’s shield halt mid air, then it came back at Steve full force. Steve caught it no problem, but suddenly a chill came over him, like he was being plunged into the icy ocean again. He gasped in shock, unable to move and suddenly he was back in the ice, darkness closing in around him. He couldn’t breathe, and he couldn’t speak to Peggy. His vision darkened as he heard his heartbeat slow.
the AI responded sarcastically.
For his part, the boy looked thoughtful for a moment.
They got dinner and decided Clint would take the first shift of the night, since Tony’s body was more worn out from their archery lessons. Clint decided to talk Tony into something more relaxing tomorrow.
JARVIS interjected.
He sneered in disgust at the mortal insect.
Obadiah had the reactor in his hands and Tony sat, unable to move while the man disconnected the wires. The pain was excruciating, but he couldn’t cry, couldn’t scream. His father’s friend, the man who had helped raise him, walked away with Tony’s heart in hand. Tony should never have trusted him.
Thor backed off a little, slowing his movements while they spoke.
Tony felt no change, but was slowly aware that he was back home. He groaned, looking down at the reactor. It was no longer flickering, and he was slowly catching his breath.
Steve winced and Tony didn’t understand.
he tugged.
he pulled them into his arms so he could walk quicker. At least he was strong enough to still lift the both of them. He descended the staircase swiftly, scanning the lobby. There was an usher at the closed door, and a guard at the external door.
he pushed through and gave them no choice but to part down the middle so he could reach the elevator.
Tony shrugged.
Thor was actually pouting. Clint would have never believed that his life would be like this. He saw a god pouting almost daily. A god. If you had told him this as a kid, he would’ve laughed and told you that a con has to be believable.
No one spoke, and the silence felt suffocating to Steve. He had never noticed how much noise there usually was even when people weren’t talking. He should be hearing the stream of coffee brewing, the breathing sounds of his teammates, the light banter between Natasha and Clint that usually formed, the clinking of mugs being set back down on the counter… Steve was going to have a newfound gratefulness for the tiny sounds when this little exercise was over.
Steve stared at her, face full of fear. Natasha was afraid, too. Injuries that just appeared were not something she could do a damn thing about, and it was terrifying. Someone to beat up would help.
Steve grinned into his phone.
Steve shook his head amusedly.
he murmured.
He would say, gesturing at all of Tony with a look of disgust on his face. God, Tony was pathetic. He still let his dead father ruin things and effect his reactions to silly pranks after all these years.
he looked questioningly at Tony through the rear view mirror, studiously avoiding Steve’s gaze.
Tony waited for the punchline, but Steve just continued to smile at him. The man was serious.
Abram blushed and looked flustered, but was unable to stop himself from looking at Natasha’s chest.
Thor’s spiel was met with silence. Bruce’s shaking hand set down his tea, and the soft clink on the counter sounded far too loud.
Fury was unfazed by the remark as usual.
Tony let out a long breath, thinking.
he used the title feeling giddy.
His voice had taken on a nostalgic tone, as if his mind was really back then. Only Phil thinks about all the tiny details like this.
the condescending voice was familiar, and the visceral fear response Tony felt was overwhelming. That was Ultron. He thought they had finally gotten rid of Ultron. When will this stop haunting him and his tech? He didn’t hesitate as he activated the emergency latch to tumble out of the suit before Ultron could trap him there.
a voice came from just behind Clint.
Abram backed against the wall.
was what he managed through his sore throat.
he said. How cryptic.
The attempt to comfort the supersoldier was slightly undermined by the fresh wave of pain that washed over him, making him arch his back with a surprised gasp before collapsing onto the bed again.
he greeted, wiggling in across from him in the nook. His legs had to go between Steve’s and the window, which required a little twisting and flexibility, but Steve just watched him, laughing.
Tony finally reacted, shifting to face Clint more fully. He looked stricken.
Tony turned to lead the way, but the room spun as he turned. Suddenly weak, he dropped to his knees. He turned back to look at the man, who was crouching now to keep a hand on Tony.
Tony was back, on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, but now it was daytime. Where had the girl gone? Who was shaking him?
She didn’t look worried.
To Steve’s credit, the ninjas did all seem afraid, and dissipated without reforming this time. Except the one. She let out a pained scream before hiding behind a pillar.
Tony tossed his over.
So he always had the armour now, didn’t even have to think about it. Granted, it meant that if Ultron ever did manage to make his way back from Strange’s tech-suppressing dimension, it’d be even easier to take over his body. Plus he’d be far more thoroughly fucked. But it was fine, you win some, you lose some right? Tony was trusting Dr. Strange with his life more and more than he’d ever have liked to anyway, and vice versa.
Welcome to the beginning of things going wrong. I used one of my fave marvel villains here, but he's not in the movies, so if you really want to know more about him and you don't read comics, you can look up his Wiki. It's not really important, I just love him.
Tony’s lips quirked sideways, a cross between a smile and a nervous squint.
While Steve agreed that they should always do what they could to make sure Peter didn’t succumb to toxic masculinity, it didn’t have to be right now.
Ty laughed again and Tony wanted to punch him. His eyes roamed over Tony,
The Mandarin smiled down at him as if they were just having a nice chat, the fucker.
Tony held up his hands,
He scrubbed his face and sighed heavily.
she asked quietly. Steve couldn’t hear her or anything, the wind carrying away voices that weren’t shouts long before they traveled across the small gaps between people, but he could read her lips well enough. They stared at each other for a moment before Steve nodded, and allowed her to pull him inside. The others must have already gone to medical, for they were nowhere to be seen, but Natasha settled onto a wall beside Steve in a back hallway. She waited patiently for Steve to break the silence.
It turned out Wade was still allowed to spend the night, probably because Tony and Steve never really liked to send him home to his abusive parents, though they hadn’t found proof to give to children’s services yet. Peter was going to be grounded for two weeks.
MODOK roared, and Tony shot one of his larger missiles before flying full speed down the street.
Thor said darkly.
he replied out of habit, but JARVIS never obliged.
A hysterical giggle tumbled from the waiter’s lips.
Peter scooched over until he was wedged between the two men, forcing them to adjust. The blanked was all messed up now, but nobody cared. Peter pointed up at the blood moon.
The others took off at an alarming rate, out of the room in seconds, while Tony was still staring after them. He turned, looking at Bruce, who shrugged.
Kimmel leaned back in his chair in clear surprise.
She had never seen him like this, nor had he ever lost his temper around her.
They popped back into existence in a backroom at SHIELD HQ. A dolly was there already so they got the capsicle onto it and rolled him away. Phil turned to the three Avengers.
With that she walked out, not bothering to wait for a reply.
They all startled at the laughter suddenly echoing all around them. It was a woman’s laughter, and Tony did not like the way Strange suddenly looked stricken.
He asked softly. Tony was up against him, head resting against Steve’s chest as they slowly danced to the movement of Marian’s voice. The orchestral part didn’t move much, so it made more sense to set one’s movements to the woman’s emotional performance. Tony waited until the song finished to answer Steve’s question. Steve vaguely realized that the rest of the large ballroom was full of people confused by the sudden change in language and style, but it didn’t matter. They’d get over it when the regular modern music returned.
With that she left them.
Peter turned to grin up at his dad. He snatched the man’s hand, and began dragging him towards his room.
Tony mulled over that. He didn’t feel anything, but Bruce could be more sensitive to whatever it was. Dr. Strange had assured them that nothing magical remained here, so it wasn’t that.
Steve nodded. His pulse was a little fast, but that was to be expected. She walked over to the sink and filled a small plastic cup with water. The cabinet against the wall had extra blankets, so she pulled one out.
Dr. Stein came in next, looking at the changes the nurse had made to the chart.
Tony pretended to think about it.
You're almost finished!
The nurses wouldn’t let him have coffee. It was the worst sort of hell for Tony. Clint had a much less restrictive diet, and he couldn’t help the envy that flared up inside him. Only he would be unlucky enough to have somehow damaged himself more extensively than the man with a gaping, semi-burned wound in his side, but show no outward signs. Clint fell asleep after a couple hours. The other Avengers, beside Steve and Phil, took that as their cue to leave. Phil took a shower in the room’s shower.
Natasha got her psych eval over with as quickly as possible. She always knew exactly what to say to get away scott free whether she was traumatized or not and she was trained from a young age to control body language and facial expression. There really was no use. As soon as she finished listening to the SHIELD psychologist ramble about how amazingly resilient she is, she went to go find anyone willing to spar. She needed to fight. If she could just get in a good fight and burn off the anger, then she could meditate and be fine so she could go wait for Tony to come to. Unfortunately none of the agents were willing to fight, probably because they were all terrified of her. It was probably for the best anyway, the only sparring partner that could handle her right now in the SHIELD building would be Steve, and he’s a block of ice.
he looked to see why Steve had stopped making cooking noises. The blond looked much angrier than Tony was expecting. He had seem so unperturbed by it all only a moment ago.
Clint asked.
Steve commented happily. Tony was nestled into his lap sideways, one arm around Steve’s neck and shoulder to hold him upright. Movie night was easily Steve’s favourite night of the week.
she concluded.
Tony broke off into a cough, a small amount of blood spattering on the ground in front of him,
Tony and Steve stared at each other for a moment in silence before Tony burst out laughing. Steve watched him in horror, confused. Maybe he had lost it.
he murmured.
The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil’s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely.
he answered cheerily, heading for the elevator.
Steve replied in all of his overly earnest sincerity.
Clint sounded worried, and he caught Phil’s eyes and held them there.
Natasha finished, waiting patiently for Peter’s reaction.
Abram barked a laugh, or maybe a sob.
weapons. The weapons he had created with no second thought; had made his riches off of. The weapons he had started creating and designing when he was only 15. He had never lost a wink of sleep over his death machines until Afghanistan. How many people had died because of his designs? No matter how many people he saved, he could never make up for that.
Maria exclaimed when Frank threw the door open, too hard. She was fine. She looked a little pale and tired, but she was fine.
She nodded in acknowledgement.
Tony watched Steve. He hadn't known he had said anything aloud. At least the others didn't know what he was talking about if Steve didn't until now. Tony didn't know what to say to comfort Steve though.
Tony just nodded, face blank.
Tony actually whined. Clint kind of wanted to slap him.
The all too familiar pain of the shrapnel in his chest was eating at him, but Tony held in the scream.
Steve squeezed back. There was so much he wanted to say, but Tony still looked exhausted, and his eyes were already drifting shut again. Tony was alive, and Steve couldn’t do anything about the damage to Tony’s heart right now. They would figure it out together. Tony always came back stronger. Stark men are made of iron.
Bruce handed him a piece of paper with crayon scribbles that made absolutely no sense. Tony felt himself grin, the card filling him with warmth. Who needed children when you had bots?
JARVIS sounded hesitant.
That stopped Clint short. Wait, what? I was blind, Strange. Are you telling me that was real? he refused to acknowledge the fear in his voice.
Steve started tickling Tony and scooped him up, bridal style. Tony fidgeted, not liking to be carried, but looking satisfied when Steve laid him in his bed and pinned down his shoulders.
Steve scrubbed his tears out of the way so he could get a proper look. He was already taking apart the suit, muscle memory taking over.
he told the room. Steve and Peter had been watching the show all day. Each of the others had come into the room at different points, and having been sucked in by one episode or another, settled in to join the marathon. Even Tony had eventually made his way sleepily from the lab. He was currently drooling on Steve’s left shoulder, fast asleep with his plate of pizza still sitting in his lab. Between his husband and his eight year old nestled into his lap, Steve was beginning to sweat.
he said gently, giving his shoulder a squeeze and taking a seat beside him.
Tony started but Steve wasn't finished.
He must be drunk then. Clint walked towards Tony, this time making sure his feet scuffed a little so Tony would hear him. Tony lifted his head and cracked his eyes open.
Steve watched as Strange pulled an unmoving Iron Man through the flickering portal with him, just as it disappeared from the room. The sorcerer let out a roar with the effort, and as soon as they were through, collapsed into a heap on the ground. Iron Man was face down, still not moving.
His mouth curved into a small smile. He started walking in a semi circle around Tony, Tony watched him warily.
Bruce thought aloud.
Steve prodded gently.
There were soft agreements around her.
Tony thought tiredly. And hey, he’d finally get to sleep now.
he asked. He considered it a small victory that he didn’t sound frightened. This man emanated power in a way similar to Dr. Strange, only he wasn’t on Tony’s side; it was terrifying.
he approached. He knew by now that sometimes Tony was so in the zone he didn’t notice Steve enter, so he was prepared for no answer.
Tony stopped in surprise as Steve turned his head gently, a hand gripping his chin. Steve kissed him deeply, probably to keep him quiet.
he answered at the same time that Steve said ‘sure, why not?’
Steve watched his expressions carefully. If there was anything suspicious about the man, he was good at hiding it.
Steve closed his eyes and held his breath for a second. He said a quick prayer that all of this would go well, opened his eyes, making the sign of the cross.
Somehow, Tony looked even more confused.
Thor happened to be there too, talking animatedly about some Netflix show to Phil. For the agent’s part, he was just nodding everytime Thor raised his voice in excitement, an amused expression on his face. Clint and Nat were sprawled out on a mat, too tired to continue sparring. None of them bought Bruce’s story until he had Jarvis show them the list himself. It was hard to wrap their heads around. Thor was the most unwilling to accept the idea.
Bruce scolded.
Tony’s bright and cheery voice entered the kitchen. He had just come from the lab. Steve watched his boyfriend cross the room with a skip to his step. The man didn’t even reach for the coffee, pulling out orange juice out of the refrigerator instead. Steve narrowed his eyes. Something was definitely up.
I offend a lot of people, Tony shrugged.
Tony merely nodded his consent, looking at the magic experts in his life. Strange and Wanda both stepped over beside the bed, scanning Tony, sharing a look, then looking back at Tony. Dr. whatever-his-name had two strong hands gripped painfully around Tony’s arm, and he was biting his lip to keep quiet. Tony was pretty sure people are normally put under for this. The man made a quick movement to set the bone and Tony couldn’t hold in the yell when his arm didn’t move, so the doctor’s hands just wrenched away and scratched his bruising arm enough to draw blood.
she said quietly. She couldn’t keep a hint of sadness out of her tone. Something was obviously eating at the man, fueling the erratic behaviour. The problem was he never talked to any of them about his thoughts.
she yelled into the chaos. The previous mix of yells, screams, crashes, laughter, and pounding music of Tony’s Halloween party was replaced by a deafening silence.  Wanda dropped the hands that she had been digging into her eyes and looked around the room. Everyone gaped at her, words caught in their throat.
Bruce asked, cleaning his glasses.
To his credit, Peter nodded with the seriousness of a soldier on a mission.
At that he grinned.
he asked quietly. Tony looked over, surprised, then quickly averted his eyes.
Tony sighed, letting loose another shaky arrow.
he blurted out. It was utterly insane. Of course Tony hadn’t thought of that! The fake phobia had been going on before they had even started the prank competitions. He suddenly felt much better about the whole thing. His observation skills and planning wasn’t at fault, Clint was just insane.
Steve had to admit that the man had a point. What more could they do? Worrying wasn’t gonna stop anything from happening. He let out a sigh.
Tony waved his arms around at her as though hailing a cab.
his voice broke.
Tony murmured.
She let him go and stepped back, looking at him again, this time a little more closely.
Tony gaped at the man, lost.
Steve was trembling as he gripped Tony’s hand. Natasha and Clint had to pry him away as the medics laid Tony onto the stretcher, Bruce undoing the safety latches of Tony’s suit in nothing but boxers. The pieces of the suit were strewn on the pavement as Tony was wheeled away, the medics already doing CPR before they made it to the ambulance. Steve couldn’t look away as they drove off, and he was glad for Natasha and Clint’s steady hands, holding him up because his knees were weak.
Strange looked around the room, making sure everyone was ready.
The mysterious sorceress appeared and kidnapped Tony on an average day, during an average team breakfast. There was no warning, and almost no time to react. Thor had really hoped he wouldn't have to be the one to reveal Tony's secret past with Morgan le Fay, but everyone's shocked and confused looks gave him little option.
He reached out and pulled Tony into him.
Steve looked confused.
Natasha walked over and handed him the folder. Phil and Steve both looked like they were about to jump up and snatch it away but she made a stop motion with her hand behind her back that stilled them. She looked at Tony, demanding his eyes and when he was looking at her, she spoke again.
As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn’t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony’s reactions. The brunette’s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man’s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.
He walked over to the kitchen and poured a glass of whiskey. He downed it, poured another, and grabbed a six pack out of the fridge. Unwanted, the events of the MODOK battle replayed in his head. He slid down the wall, taking a gulp of the second glass.
he murmured.
Steve looked around, seeing the SHIELD swarm gathering Ten Rings Men in cuffs and doing whatever SHIELD swarms do to clean up their messes, until he saw Bruce walking towards him pulling on a t-shirt, and Daredevil beside him. Everyone else was okay at least. Fuck. Tony was gone with the Mandarin, the one thing they had been trying to avoid. How the hell are they going to find him? What kind of horrors does the Mandarin want to do to him? He’s been harboring this grudge for years. Steve suddenly felt sick. He stepped outside and vomited at the thought of Tony being tortured. He leaned against the wall and breathed in the cold air, trying to calm down.
Tony blustered,
Strange looked apologetic, and Steve felt kind of bad for him. The man very rarely needed help; had earned his title as Sorcerer Supreme without question, so this could be very uncomfortably humbling.
- Bruce typed. His name usefully appeared with a colon before the sentence on the screen. Why had Tony even created this in-person chatroom type thing in the first place?
Tony ran through the conversation again, not sure what was being asked.
but whatever his attempt to diffuse the situation was going to be was drowned out by the alarm.
Everyone watched the Scarlet Witch leave in a flurry of tears. Tony felt a wave of guilt for pressuring her to come earlier. He had just wanted them all to have fun, and she had seemed so stressed lately, he thought it would cheer her up. It apparently had the opposite effect.
Tony gestured to the man behind the counter.
he smiled, sitting up and propping himself against the headboard. The heaviness in his limbs and slight slowing to his thoughts was familiar enough, not dissimilar to being buzzed.
he explained calmly.
Clint was so done with this shit and he felt like an idiot.
He laughed. He was obviously feeling much more rested.
Bruce took off his glasses to clean them.
It was a good enough plan. She had the security of a bunker. Her own apartment would be a terrible idea. She and Luke had agreed that they didn’t need any intense locks considering how hard they were to hurt. Plus they were too poor for good security, but their life was fine for them.
Clint, Natasha, Bruce, Pepper, Rhodey, Coulson, and Strange filed in behind Thor. Steve stood in surprise.
This one was actually kind of handsome, Maria decided. Also, not creepy like most men.
Tony was so taken aback at the change of subject his mind stuttered for a moment.
So the sudden increase in drama in her life left her feeling raw. She felt like the wrong gentle breeze would set her off, and it kept her awake at night with worry, which had probably been the cause of her current migraine. She should’ve followed her gut tonight and begged out of the party invitation. Wanda knew she wasn’t feeling well this morning, and when Vision had had to go off on a mission and cancelled on the date, she should’ve cancelled on Tony. She had tried, she really had. But she had a soft spot for his big brown eyes.
Clint said gently, slipping his hand into Phil’s and leaning on the wall beside him. Phil looked at him carefully, searching his face.
Fuck it. Tony took another couple swallows from the flask.
The unibeam wasn’t as bright or powerful as usual, but it did the trick. Tony kept at it until all of the children were through.
One of Tony’s jets was parked outside the western edge of the forest. Grabbing their packs, Tony and Clint began their hike to find a good campsite near coordinates JARVIS gave them where they were most likely to encounter Bigfoot.
Tony was still lying on the ground, but Clint could see he was moving as he neared the bottom. He groaned.
Tony turned to face him and he looked kind of pale.
Natasha asked.
he scowled.
he just wanted this conversation to not be happening. He was going to say something he shouldn’t and Steve was going to know too much.
Steve’s smile turned more bittersweet than nostalgic.
The snarls of the gargoyles could be heard around the corner. As Strange and the Avengers rounded on them, Steve threw his shield down the narrow hallway to clear a fast path for Strange. While the sorcerer ran ahead, the Avengers started their fight with the creatures as they got back on their feet. Tony made sure to stick to physical attacks as much as he could, but there were a lot of them. By the time the team had fought their way into the throne room, the suit was at 36%. Tony scanned the room, seeing Strange and who he assumed must be Nightmare in the throws of battle above the throne, and a large cage of terrified children in the far corner to the right of the throne. He took down another creature to his right, and they were thinning out. Tony was more focused on watching Strange.
she whispered to the room before turning and fleeing. She normally prided herself on her self-control; she never lost her temper. Knowing it was too dangerous for someone with reality warping chaos magic like her own to lose control of their emotions, she spent years mastering meditation and emotional control.
Tony laughed and got up,
Steve asked.
God, Tony hated cocky bastards like this one. He was the only one allowed to be this full of himself, and that was just a façade. The man turned on Tony suddenly, causing his cape to billow behind him.
Tony seethed, pointing an accusatory finger at the archer.
Tony shook his head hurriedly when he saw that the others actually seemed to be contemplating the stupid idea.
Tony admitted. Pain made him more humble, okay?
The door on the other side of the room opened. Tony watched the man approaching him warily. He could recognize that face anywhere, had grown up with the guy even. They had lost contact a long time ago. Tony hadn’t had a clue where Tiberius Stone had disappeared to after his old man had gone bankrupt. There had been rumours about the man buying out small companies abroad, amassing resources, but Tony hadn’t paid them much attention. He had assumed Ty wanted nothing to do with him anymore.
Tony was so done with this shit, it was time to let his mind wander.
Bruce nodded in defeat,
The alarms on the monitor started blaring before Tony started screaming. Dr. Nicholson looked taken aback by the violent reaction, but quickly recovered to hit a button that called the code blue.
Dr. Strange turned to Phil.
Tony shook his head.
several months back. According to them, Kimmel wanted to talk to the two of them about being the Avengers’ leaders, and how their different leadership styles meshed during missions. When Steve had called Kimmel’s assistant with his idea last week, Jimmy himself had called him back to tell him it was a go.
his voice was sharp.
Schmidt flinched, but to his credit, he didn’t back away. An angry Dracula was a scary sight. The Red Skull needed to change tactics, make this worth it for the vampire count.
Clint watched his teammates all interacting differently with a warm fondness. It was actually kind of a fun idea, and Clint was happy Steve had thought of it. Not that Clint wished deafness on anyone, although he knew plenty of the community preferred it over hearing, but it was kind of nice to see his friends take a walk in the life of perpetual silence. Sure, Clint was only 80% deaf according to his ENT, but those first few weeks after the fight with Crossfire that had damaged his eardrums, he had heard nothing.
He looked down for an embarrassing stain, but found nothing.
Peter stood in front of Tony, mimicking the man’s body language. He cleared his throat. Tony was thrilled to see where this was going.
Tony could do nothing but watch his friends suffer from his birds eye view. The Mandarin had them all falling apart at the seams in no time. He tried to shout at one point, to snap one of them out of it, but all that had gained him was a painful coughing fit and more blood loss. If Dr. Strange would just wake up, they may just have a chance, probably not Tony, but at least the rest of them. Steve was in a block of ice the Mandarin had formed, Clint wasn't doing a damn thing except looking bank and confused, Natasha was muttering about something but she looked torn between furious and terrified, Thor was broken over an imaginary Jane, and Bruce... Well Bruce was kneeling, naked on the ground holding an imaginary person in his arms and and sobbing.
Tony stopped walking and just listened. It sounded faintly like their might be breathing in the darkness, but he couldn’t be sure. It was definitely where the heat signature was coming from. Tony flipped his vision from infrared to night. With that he could make out a humanoid shape slumped against the wall in the corner, but no more detail than that. It looked like it may be unconscious, and along with the smell Tony was beginning to suspect it was injured.
Clint nodded, his jaw clenched.
Clint said at dinner that night. Thor had brought a tabloid magazine to the table with an article speculating about their attire.
he looked between the children in Frank’s arms,
All the while Tony was dodging MODOK’s blasts. He knew he’d have trouble hitting him or outsmarting him. His only hope was to insult MODOK’s ego, because he was quite the angry megalomaniac. Unfortunately, the blasts were getting harder and harder to dodge as Tony slowly moved their fight towards 19th. He was short of breath and his shoulder was aching so badly it was radiating down his arm and into his chest. Was that his heart pounding in his ears? It was uneven, and he felt it.
Tony said nothing but he lay comfortably in the embrace until the alarm sounded.
he finished the code he was working on before turning to face the blond warily. This could be the argument he was hoping to avoid. While makeup sex was good, Tony preferred not adding emotional stress to his days if he could avoid it.
Steve leaned over him, and Tony wasn’t going to argue with a kiss. When Steve pulled back sharply, it was because one of the monitors attached to Tony’s chest was beeping at the change angrily. A nurse came in then, alerted by the change, to check on them.
This must be what being hypnotized felt like. Tony could hear the vampires words in tandem with his own voice in his head. It was as though Dracula’s instructions were his own thoughts, and he
he sounded so broken and terrified.
He was walking back to his hotel from the  Palazzo Chigi, where he had been schmoozing the President del Consiglio. Tony was always the one to deal with Italy for SI since so many of the powerful figures were old family friends on Maria’s side. Most of them hated that she had left with Howard, but luckily they were charmed by her son and how he shared her eyes. The vintage Italian wine had left him with a warm buzz, and the night was mild and humid, so a walk had sounded much nicer than calling Happy up. His only warning was the wisp of black smoke in his periphery and the sound of a whispered
He could at least save Steve, maybe.
His eyes were so serious, and how was someone supposed to respond to praise like that? He was gone before Tony would’ve had a chance anyway.
Zelma, on the other hand, had something very… off about her. Her psychic vibrations were something Strange had never come across. She seemed to be a normal human, with no powers or sorcery, but there was something causing a scattering of her thoughts, and draining her life force. He stored that information away for later, honing his focus back onto the spirit in the room talking to Barton.
When Steve made it to the gps coordinates JARVIS, he couldn’t make sense of what he was seeing. Tony had never made it to the meeting this morning, and Pepper had called Steve demanding to speak to the genius. When Steve assured her that no, Tony had never come home, and no he wasn’t just covering for the man, the fear had started to settle in. Together they traced Tony’s phone through the night, and for some reason it had stopped traveling in the middle of nowhere, and was still there.
They shared a tentative smile.
Tony began to respond, but Steve continued.
JARVIS answered.
. Steve wished with all his heart that Tony being so happy wasn’t a cause for alarm, but he knew the man. Tony should be stressed and irritable, should have dark circles under his eyes, should be twitchy and a little out of it. Whatever was different this year, Steve wanted to figure out if only to make sure he could repeat it from now on.
voice; Tony doesn’t argue with that voice. But he wouldn’t tase Tony right after a heart attack, would he? Calculated risk: not worth it.
he floundered for the right words.
He reached over and ruffled Peter’s hair. This kid was smart and sensitive, who could ask for more? Steve had made a lot of mistakes in life, but the family he ended up with was worth every single one.
Tony hadn’t been back here since the last time when he had to fight off a demonic faux Howard in order to escape. Morgana had her own hideouts, he knew, so why were they here? He really did not have the tools or energy to deal with Mephisto himself, if he could even pray to lay a scratch on Morgana.
The Mandarin jumped up and whipped around, punching his fist through the air towards Tony. The blast of light sprang forth from his ring, hitting Tony square in the lower abdomen. It felt solid like a wrecking ball, his insides crushing between the wall behind him and the impact. The blood gushed from his mouth as he fell to his knees heaving. He caught his breath on his hands and knees before he pushed himself back to sit against the wall. He knew if he tried to stand right now he’d fall; he was too weak. When he wiped the blood from his mouth, his hand was shaking.
This is a "let's deal with everyone else before we can get back to Tony" chapter. I love writing everyone as important characters in this big family, but it is hard to balance so many characters in one fic. I didn't want the whole thing to be Tony, Tony, Tony just because I love him so much. They're all SO important to me.
JARVIS paused for a moment, scanning all electronic interaction in the area from the morning.
Tony’s voice broke.
he was in less pain now, and he wondered if it had an anesthetic in it as well. Any movement in his torso and weight on his leg still cause sharp pain from the embedded bullets, but small victories.
Zelma looked over at Strange, shocked.
Thor was next, followed by Natasha and Phil, and lastly Bruce. They all woke to the smell of bacon and eggs wafting through the tower. Steve had cooked up a large feast, knowing he wouldn’t be the only one who would awaken hungry.
Tony said and ran off to suit up.
she asked, monotone.
Thor looked pained to say it,
If that didn’t sound like a hurt child, Clint isn’t the greatest marksman in the world (and he most certainly is).
Frank’s eye snapped open in surprise, and he felt the blush warming his cheeks. He was so used to being hyper-aware of his surroundings, so it was shocking that he hadn’t noticed the woman stop singing, let alone exit the room.
Heather was blushing fiercely, avoiding Zelma’s shocked gaze.
He was hoping to bury himself in his work until he passed out. The last thing he wanted to do right now was think about the last few days. He whipped through the newest bow design, trudged through some new weapons for Natasha, and started to work on the atomic structure for rip-proof shorts for Bruce when it all came crashing down. He pushed back from the table, running his hands through his hair as the chair clattered to the ground. His throat ached for the burn of vodka, but he feared JARVIS would betray him.
Good old lost in the woods trope here. And since it's me writing, someone will get hurt but everyone's okay in the end.
she said darkly, stepping towards him again. Instead of fighting back like she expected, he started backing away on his hands and knees as though she were a monster and he were defenseless. She stopped again.
Dracula would be lying if he said he felt no gratitude to Steven Rogers. He would never admit such a thing out loud, of course, but he knew HYDRA would still be a thorn in his side without the man. Steve knew he had to be thankful to Dracula as well. Without him and his cabaal, the allied forces may not have defeated the fairly powerful Transylvanian faction of his sworn enemy. So when Red Skull approached the vampire king around seventy years later with his proposal to team up against the Avengers, he was understandably conflicted.
he tried to sound convincing as he laid the man on the ground for the medics to take over and examine. He stayed as close as he could so Tony could still see him. It was clear that panic was starting to take over for Tony though, and he reached out for Steve. His chest was heaving visibly.
Natasha asked Strange. They were in the lead, and only turned around at the sound of Clint’s warning.
he rasped, looking at the ceiling. He turned his head, eyes catching on Phil’s immediately. He made grabby hands until Phil complied, leaning in for a quick kiss and sitting on the bed’s edge.
he purred with a wink.
Natasha and Clint traded a look, communicating several plans and consequences in only a few seconds. Clint nodded.
Phil said while he typed on his phone.
All it took was a blink, and Tony’s kitchen was gone, replaced by the firescape of Mephisto’s Hell.
Tony was frantic now, his view of himself faltering.
JARVIS spoke only to Tony.
medicine.
JARVIS’ voice startled him.
Thor said over the comms just before walking into the north entrance with Phil and a med team flanking him. Phil’s face was ghostly as he saw Clint, and Natasha thanked any gods there may be that he hadn’t been here for the horrifying screams. They backed away as the med team took over, knocking Clint out in order to keep him still so they could do what they needed to stabilize him on the way to SHIELD medical.
When Clint looked like he was about to protest he held up a hand.
Arc reactor back in place, the vampire king met Tony’s eyes,
It was apparently the wrong thing to ask.
he started. Tony opened his mouth to retort, but Steve held up a hand to stop him.
Everyone gave him a disbelieving look.
They watched the words appear on the screen. Tony made another motion and pointed to each of them in the room, making keyboards for each of them.
Tony couldn’t help the way he pictured her suddenly, standing over her with his chest open. She quickly morphed into Yinsen and he wasn’t there anymore.
Detective needs-to-shave, as Jessica had dubbed him in her head, crossed his arms.
she changed the subject.
Tony rolled his eyes.
he said tiredly.
Pepper said. She kissed Tony on the forehead.
She knew Steve had no rebuttal to that and stood.
Tony sounded mostly sure, even to himself. Why would he have done something like that?
Enjoy!
Tony scrunched up his nose, never able to deny that voice. Steve knew it, too, and really, Tony should be glad that the man didn’t abuse the power.
The silence was deafening and sudden after the blasting metal from a moment ago. Tony looked around in confusion.
Zelma asked furiously. The sharp look she got from her housemate made her sit back down.
Tony shrugged.
When the ground suddenly opened up beneath them, Tony quickly tried to scan as much as possible from the glowing white light full of creepy shadows. Dracula’s escape was too quick for Tony to get anything useful. He sighed. Oh well, it was time to go save Widow with science. He couldn’t wait to rub it in Cap’s face.
