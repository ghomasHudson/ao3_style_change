Maybe it’s some kind of ritual, and Dean just doesn’t know. Maybe that’s why Cas will steal looks at him that Dean can see out of the corner of his eye, looks that are gone by the time he can check, yet are marked by a hint of mischief on the angel’s face.
“You—” Dean starts, but then he stalls, taking in Cas’ playfulness, and he doesn’t know how to end the sentence.
Sam and Jack let out yelps of surprise at the suddenness of it, but Dean didn’t so much as flinch. Instead, he lowered his head to look at hers, his focus heightened. For a few seconds, there was silence, worry, perhaps, that it hadn’t worked.
“Dean, I need you to listen. We might lose lucidity. And if that happens, you’ll start thinking what you’re seeing is real. We might lose each other.”
“Good. No surprise roommates or anything…” Sam pauses, like he’s waiting for Dean to get mad at him. If Dean’s honest, he’s not that mad. This is a pretty cushy situation he’s found himself in—as far as...situations go.
Dean walks into Other Dean’s apartment, opening it with the key he found in his pocket, Sam trailing behind him. It’s huge for an apartment, and Dean thinks he’s gotta be loaded. The kitchen is off to the right—some kind of rustic-modern throw-up complete with a gaudy cast iron oven. Something is cooking in a pot on the burner, and it smells fantastic.
Sam ignores him, walking over to the dining room table where he’s got his laptop open. Dean shuts the door behind him. “I’ve been working.”
Charlie eyes him, taking another final gulp from her glass. She hums in agreement. “You know what?” she says, “Me too. Nature calls.”
That’s when he heard it. A sharp inhale, like a gasp. Or a sob. He quickened his pace, looking, looking, until…
The Empty screamed. A loud, inhuman shriek that pierced Dean’s ears. He pressed his hands to either side of his head. “You’re not going anywhere!”
“I…” Dean starts. He peers into the apartment at Cas, who’s begun straightening out the throw blankets on the sofa. “I don’t…” He
Dean grunted, and shifted his weight on his feet. He became aware of the cool metal pressed against his back. He didn’t have time for this. Maybe he could speed up the process, get her to agree by more persuasive means. He heard Sam’s voice in his head, chiding him.
“Anything. Pick one from the database. You just need a documented reason for why you checked out the demon blade. Sam says you guys haven’t used it yet. You’ll have an in to go back to the headquarters when you return it.”
He looks to Sam again, who only shrugs. The people around the table, all dressed in some form of business wear, begin to clap, their eyes on Sam and Dean. “Though, that is an overall estimate,” the woman continues, “The elderly, ill, and impoverished still remain the most vulnerable to these threats.” The slide changes. “So, our plan for this next quarter is…”
Sorry for the wait and thank you for reading and engaging with me in the comments! I'm so grateful for all of you!
“Castiel...is my father,” Jack said, looking to Sam with wide eyes. He turned to Dean, his eyebrows knitted with his usual optimistic resoluteness. “I’ll do it.”
Dean jumps a little at the sound and straightens himself against the back of the couch. He props the laptop up properly on his lap. “H-h…” He clears his throat. “Hi.” Suddenly, Dean can feel his heartbeat in his throat. Does he really, actually want to do this?
“Sammy, I think you’re underestimating the douchery of the federal government.” Dean says, rubbing a hand over his face. “Alright, keep me posted.”
Instead, he made a beeline for his room, and that’s where he’s been ever since. Dean thinks back to what Cas said in the car.
When they’re back in the car, Sam gets out his bag and starts rummaging through it. He pulls out a brass bowl and several vials of god-knows-what. He hands the vials to Dean.
It’s mid-afternoon when they pull into town, and by then the road has become a secondary character to the thoughts racing through his mind. He’s never gone so long without music. He needs sound. Sam’s on his phone, looking over the case details for the millionth time.
But, as expected, Betty reanimated, sitting upright once again. Her chest inflated with a dramatic intake of air. She shook the hair out of her face, a wild, triumphant look in her eye, made a little noise in her throat that Dean thought could have been a giggle. “Where’s the book?” was the first thing she said.
“She was—well, of course you know this—her eyes...went black.” The woman takes a moment to compose herself. “And she...she vanished. I don’t…” She looks up, her eyes locking with Dean’s. “She’s gone, isn’t she?”
“It may only be summoned by Death, or the promise of it.” Dean repeated. “What does that mean, Sammy?”
Finally, some good news. Good to know Charlie is willing to engage in illegal activities across realities. “Well, can you do it?”
Dean squints against the beams of light streaming in through the cracks in the curtains, and he remembers what he has to do. He looks down at Cas, who’s looking up at him, dazed yet sure. He’s got to make things right again.
After she hugs Sam and Cas, she sets the wine down on the kitchen counter as Castiel strides into the kitchen and opens a cabinet full of wine glasses. “Alright,” she continues, “Who’s ready for cowboy movie night?”
Cas reaches down and grabs Dean’s hand. All Dean can do is stare at the place where they connect, awe-stricken. “Are you alright?” Cas asks, his voice deepening. If Dean weren’t looking down, he bets he could see that piercing gaze he gets when he’s trying to guess how Dean’s feeling.
It takes all of the strength he can muster to stand, to push himself off the bed. He leaves, and he doesn’t let himself look at Cas again.
“Do you ever feel as if you have lived many lives?” Cas is looking at the flowers again, but Dean’s eyes are on him, like he might miss something if he looks away.
When they make it to the ground floor, it’s pretty clear that they’re in New York City, and Dean does his best to contain the visceral shudder that runs through him. All he can think about is how loud it is. Too loud, too many things trying to grab your attention—he doesn’t like it. He’d take Baby on an open, empty road over a city any day. He looks over at Sam, hoping to share a moment of mutual disgust, but he seems unfazed.
Curing a vamp that's fed? Now, that is definitely something Dean has to see. He considers asking Sam to elaborate, but he figures he should be most worried about getting home. He tries to make a mental note to ask him about it later, though. “Anything on archangel grace?”
They sat there in silence for a minute, two—it was hard to say. “Can Jack...Do you think…?” Dean said, slowly.
“The what?” Cas tilts his head at Dean, frowning, and Dean wonders if his counterpart would’ve left Sam on speaker.
Cas lets out a bitter chuckle. “Looking back, there were so many little things. You don’t take your shoes off at the door. You never wore his tan overcoat.” Cas runs the pads of his fingers over Dean’s stubble. “You let your beard grow.”
That would have been kind. Kinder than, “Don’t do this.” It would have been a thank you. But Dean was selfish, and his first thought was to beg for him to stay.
Dean slinks into the kitchen, wobbling a bit, nose guiding him to the breakfast bar. He sits with a heavy
“I don’t give a rat’s ass what it does or doesn’t like. I’m getting there. And you’re helping me.” He paused to examine her. Her fear was still present, veiled thinly by a newfound anger. “Look, once I tell you what I know, the Empty’s not going to be able to touch you. Trust me.”
“Well, I found a, uh, an...inventory I think. A list of all the supernatural artifacts and, uh, ingredients in their possession.”
“You didn’t tell me Sam was coming,” Cas says, frowning. And before Dean can utter even a syllable of explanation, Cas gathers Dean's face into his hands and presses a soft kiss to his lips. Dean’s
Dean tunes her out after a few more sentences about “doubling down on efforts.” He looks around. Are they...they’re actually doing good here, aren’t they? Does everyone here know about the supernatural? He thinks about it for a minute. Does the average joe know about ghosts and iron, that demons hate salt?
“Awake,” Dean agrees, drumming his fingers on the table. Did Cas make every meal for him? Who taught him how to cook? And how’d he get so
Dean’s footsteps reverberated throughout the library, filling his ear against the place’s eerie silence. He looked up, realizing that by some cruel joke, he’d ended up in the
Jack and Sam sat on either side of him, and for a moment, neither spoke, waiting for Betty’s answer with bated breath. Finally, Sam said, “If you’re the only reaper left…” Sam began.
He looks around, not seeing much except lined brownstone houses, people power walking to wherever it is they need to be, the sounds of dogs barking from no discernible location.
Dean paints a thin smile on his face, the one he does when he’s pretending to be a fed. He walks up to reception, past the security guards, like he owns the place—because he
Sam gapes, eyes wide. This Cas is...authoritative. It reminds Dean of how his Cas was when they first met. Sam shakes his head no.
Cas takes a seat next to Dean on the bed. The shifting of weight on the mattress is enough to send a jolt of fear through Dean’s core. Cas feels white-hot next to him. “You’re right,” Cas says, “I just…” He turns his head and Dean’s eyes lock with Cas’. Has he ever looked into them like this before? They’re almost too bright; it must be his grace peeking through. “I don’t want to lose you.”
Dean couldn’t say that he didn’t know how Cas felt. He did. In that place in his soul where he buried things deep, Dean knew. It was easier to believe that Cas, an angel, couldn’t love someone like him. Then he wouldn’t have to entertain the idea that, maybe….
“Well, flying away was a little dramatic…” Dean starts, hoping Cas will accept it as levity. Though, he’s still not sure why this alternate Cas’ opinion means that much to him.
Cas lets out a light chuckle as he transfers the omelette onto a plate beside the stove. He piles some bacon on before turning to face Dean completely, fork in hand. He squints his eyes and tilts his head, conveying what Dean thinks must be some sort of gentle pity and places the food in front of him. “No plan.” Castiel says, sternly. “No work. Just...relax, alright?”
When the world changed again, it replaced his wicked confidence with fear, as deep and primal as the girl’s had been. But there was something else, too: grief. Dean’s eyes opened at the sound of a voice, the one that had been both his salvation and his ruin.
“Huh,” she says, like this is confusing her, “Well, last time we spoke, it was the opposite. Is it something about being away from the action that’s making you pull away?”
being this version of me, Dean. I like the way people look at me...and talk about me. I like it.” Sam looks down.
He continues walking along the trail, marked out with embedded stones, and for a moment, he forgets why he’s there. Really, what is he
Sam walked over to Dean and towered over him where he sat. “He lost all his grace before and he didn’t die. We couldn’t bring him to the brink even if we wanted to. He’s at full strength again.”
Sam gets up and starts wringing his hands. He walks over to the window, facing away from Dean. “So, there’s something I didn’t tell you. I didn’t want to say in front of Cas.”
. “Awake?” he asks, with a soft lilt. Dean searches for disappointment, displeasure, but he can’t find any.
Dean nods. “Proceed, Doctor.” Sam ignores him, and begins furtively typing on the phone. His eyebrows knit together as he reads. “What does it say?”
Before the deep, orange-red, and before the sour smell of shredded flesh—he heard her scream. She looked at him, fear in her eyes, only eighteen he somehow knew. He laughed. It disgusted him, but he laughed. Dean tore a slow, deliberate line from her shoulder to her hip.
Once they’re on the fifth floor, the security guard leaves them alone, pressing the button to close the elevator doors as they leave. Sam and Dean are met with a hallway not unlike the one they’d just been in, except this one is lined with metal doors. Each has a black card scanner on the door handle—it’s really the only thing differentiating the doors from the steel-gray walls.
—while he’s been covered in blood and bruises and soaked in brokenness, regret—this guy’s been going on walks. Looking at goddamn fucking flowers. Asking his
Jack and Sam shared a look of what Dean knew was pity. Dean bit down hard on the inside of his cheek. He could do this. This was something he could
Of course, there was no one at the desk. He turned, whipping his head around. “Hello? Anybody?” Maybe it was a dumb move, giving himself away, but he didn’t have any more patience. “Hello?” he repeated, stalking parallel to the bookcases, inspecting each aisle.
He landed with a thud that reverberated through his skull. But it didn’t hurt. It seemed that here, the hurting would be much worse than that of a deadly fall.
Sam grunts, his finger hovering centimeters above the numbers. After a beat, his hand closes into a fist. He brings the pad of his hand down hard against the top of the lockboxes, the entire row of metal rattling and echoing in the expanse of the room. “No,” he says, leaning his weight against the compartments. He looks down.
Dean unfurls himself onto the bed, his head sinking deep into the pillows. He’s stalling. He knows it. He’s been stalling for days now. Dean’s been telling Sam how much he wants to go home but the truth? If he really, really wanted to get home, he’d be there right now, some way or other.
Sam makes a groan of annoyance, but he doesn’t look up from what he’s doing. “Sleep here tonight,” he says, his words clipped and resigned. “We’ll leave tomorrow.”
Dean shot a look at Sam, whose mouth was pressed into a disapproving line. “It’s settled, then. Cas, here we come.”
Dean’s usually great in a crisis, but this one’s...different. Completely different. He almost wishes there was a monster trying to kill him; at least then he’d know what to do.  But no, now he has to complete an alternate reality heist. Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “How do we get there?”
He gets dressed, fully disappointed with the choices in the closet. Eventually, he settles on a black button-down, some jeans that are a
“Um…‘HunterCorp is a non-profit, federally contracted corporation that works in tandem with the CIA, FBI, NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, and other international security organizations to catalogue and neutralize supernatural threats.’ And it says we’re the Co-CEOs.”
Dean opened his eyes to nothing, blackness, and for a second he worried he’d somehow gone blind. “Are you kidding me?” drawled a voice from behind him. He whipped around. Still nothing. Then, somehow, he could see again. Via some overhead spotlight from nowhere, he saw it. The Empty sat in its chair, cross-legged, fuming. It still wore Meg’s form. “Your little nephilim pet almost killed me!”
Cas raises an eyebrow. “I’ve been waiting now, for hours. And you haven’t said a word. And now you’re asking me about archangels—” Though his voice rises in volume, it seems to shrink in confidence.
For the next five days, Cas avoids Dean. It’s like it’s a test, and he’s failing; he isn’t sure he wants to pass. Cas doesn’t sleep next to him in the bed. He doesn’t initiate any touches. His speech still softens, the way Dean supposes it would when talking to a partner, which makes Dean think maybe Cas isn’t mad. Maybe he’s...waiting.
“Dean?” Sam tried again, from the doorway. It was hesitant, as if there was a threat he couldn’t yet discern. “Dean, what happened? Dean. Why didn’t you answer?” Sam’s voice sounded dull and garbled. Unreal. Nothing was real. He made no move when his brother approached him, crouching to examine him in his defeated state.
Dean stares at the text for what feels like forever. He puts the phone facedown on the table and finishes the rest of his drink in one go.
Dean felt it again. That pang, like a knife in his chest, carving at his insides. “You don’t get it. We take out God? Fine. Everything back to normal. You get Eileen back. And Cas? Cas stays dead. Team Free Will...that dream...It ain’t nothing without him.”
“It’s no problem,” Sam says with that smile of his. He’s good at knowing what to say. “We’re happy to help. Can you tell me about the last time you saw Jade? Any details that didn’t make it into the report?”
Before Dean could think to respond, the blackness was descending on them both. He didn’t feel anything, a sort of calm, maybe. Soon, the Empty ran over his hands, up his neck, at the corners of his eyes.
Dean squints at the screen, trying to read it. The music rattles around in his head, and he blinks, trying again. “Hey, can you turn that off?”
“That so?” Dean’s not in the mood for this. If this dude had anything substantial, he wouldn’t be fishing for more details.
Dean meanders over to reception, noticing the array of pamphlets perched in displays on top of it. He grabs the first one he sees and reads it:
Jack walked back in, holding an especially thick tome. “I think I found it! It’s heavy,” he beamed. “Where’s Sam?”
Dean and Sam shared a look, although Dean knew they didn’t agree on what to say next. “Jack—” Sam began.
“Well Other Sam has that weird gender thing and you don’t. Other Dean likes...likes dudes...and I...I’m not like him, Sam.” Sam’s face falls and he averts his eyes, picking up a pen to scribble in a notebook, looking back and forth between a lore book and the page. “Sammy?”
“Yeah, actually,” Dean says, looking at Sam pointedly, “Can I get another one of these for my, uh...sibling, please?”
Though there’s no hint of innuendo in Cas’ voice, Dean still panics. He couldn’t...He couldn’t share a
Dean isn’t sure what she means at first, but then it hits him. Geez, is it really that odd to walk around in your pajamas? “Hm, y-yeah I guess I am.” he says with a polite chuckle.
Dean felt something inside of him break, and he started to cry, deep, guttural noises rattling throughout his body and out of his mouth. He tried to close his eyes, he
Another guy—with a very obvious gun in his holster—nods for them to follow him. Dean looks at Sam, who takes a breath. “Here we go,” Dean mumbles. They cross the lobby to a reinforced steel door and wait for Rodriguez, who’s wide, broad-shouldered and has at least an inch on Sam—to unlock it.
Dean shook his head. “No, Sam. I can handle it. I can handle a reaper. You stay here with Jack.” What if something were to happen to the both of them? At least, Dean thought, if he died, he’d die knowing he did everything he could for Cas.
When Dean finally reaches not-his apartment door again, he realizes it’s become almost familiar in the past few days.
Hi everyone! I hope you're enjoying reading so far! I've loved reading all your comments! I will continue to post chapters once a week--maybe sooner if I'm feeling wild ;)--so stay tuned.
Cas sighs, resting a hand on Dean’s knee. “Just don’t be late like the last time. If you’d like to have the session here, I’ll leave you to it.” Cas gives Dean a pat before getting to leave.
? What on Earth would Sam even be a doctor of? God, now he’s going to go and get a big head about a PhD he didn’t even earn.
“You...You raised me from perdition.” The angel’s face erupted into a grin, and Dean laughed, relief overwhelming him.
But then, he looks up. And there’s Cas, in his trenchcoat on the bench, looking at the fucking tulips. He swallows. “Cas.”
“What’re you talking about?” Dean asked, but by the end of his sentence, Sam had already booked it down the hall and out of the library.
Henriksen nods, drawing the motion out for far longer than is necessary. “Demon blade’s down in the five hundreds.” He points with his thumb for emphasis, friendly tone frosting at the edges. “But you two know that, of course.”
Henriksen flashes a smile. “I know you will.” After that, their silent standoff lasts for several moments. Dean stares at Henriksen, refusing to be the first one to look away. “Well, let’s get you your demon blade then,” Henriksen says, breaking the tension, nodding left to the lower numbers. “If you’re in a hurry. Just—Don’t forget to do the write-up this time. ”
Happy New Year's Eve! What a year this has been. I'm glad I could finish it off by completing this fic. Thank you for your kind words on the previous chapters!
Dean’s awoken the next morning by the buzzing of his phone. In a daze, he answers it without looking, untangling himself from Cas’ embrace. “Mm, hello?” he groans.
“Don’t fucking touch me, Dean,” Sam snaps, and Dean recoils like he’s been burned. Sam takes a long breath. “I’m trying to do the thing. Solve the case.”
Before Dean can respond, a train attendant walks up with a drink in her hands. She stalls in front of their table. “Bourbon on the rocks,” she says, setting it down in front of Dean. “Can I get you anything else?”
For a moment, Dean does nothing. He just looks at it, in awe. Dean has almost no childhood pictures of him and Sam. Just memories. Not a lot of good ones, either. He wonders if there’s more of them in the phone and if he could print them out, take them with him back to his world. It doesn’t matter if they’re not
The bitterness falls away when he looks into Castiel’s eyes. He softens. “I’m just...overwhelmed, I think. A lot...going on.”
Sucking in a breath, Dean moves his cursor over the notification and clicks. A link pops up for the session, and follows it, doing a little side-eye around the room to make sure Cas really isn’t lurking somewhere as the telehealth site loads.
Cas rests his forehead against Dean’s. “I think, maybe...maybe he—the other me—he must miss you too.”
Cas runs a finger over Dean’s bare collarbone. “I miss you,” he says. He props himself on his elbow and looks at Dean, his face illuminated by the city’s bright nighttime lights. “I miss…” Cas cups Dean’s cheek.
Dean’s still brooding from the fifty five minutes of talking about his feelings when he gets a call. He’s expecting, well,
The Empty twitched, its head jerking to the side at un unsettling tempo. “Neither do you!” It screeched. “Three, two…”
, the portal to the alternate universe where….well, he’s not sure he’s ready to fill in that blank yet. Cas walks in, leaving the door open for him and Sam.
Castiel shook his head. “Dean, you could’ve just left it alone. I’d made my choice.” He wasn’t looking at Dean anymore, his eyes falling just past him.
The lights are all off, so Dean doesn’t notice at first when Cas’ silhouette apparates into the living room. Then, he sees him, and jumps back against the door. “Jesus, Cas! Don’t do that.”
Woah. How are those two things related? “Bad.” Dean says without thinking. He has nightmares every night, always has, but...maybe he shouldn’t have told her that.
Sam crossed in front of Jack. “And what, Dean? We still don’t have a plan for how to take out Chuck—”
“They don’t need you,” Castiel says, stealing the words right from Dean’s mouth. He turns to Sam. “Do you need him to go with you?”
Cas softens, letting out a breath. He shuffles over to Dean and leans over to press a kiss to the top of his head. “Just want you to be okay,” he mumbles into Dean’s hair.
“Afternoon, Mr. Winchester. I was wondering if you had some time to discuss your case report with me.”  Henriksen’s voice is cordial, but Dean definitely detects some agenda behind it.
It wasn’t all set in stone, and not even Chuck could read the ending. He pressed forward, out of the
Without answering, Sam walks over to an open book on the table. It was the same one that Dean had read earlier, before his meltdown. “That passage you read,” he said, tapping his finger at the page, “‘It may only be summoned by Death, or the promise of it.’”
Dean sits across the table from Sam, drumming his fingers on it, his eyes locked on the blurry landscape running past the window. The train rattles underneath him, and he pulls at the collar of his dress shirt. He feels hot. “Dude.” Sam says, “Relax.”
When Dean was twelve, his dad took him and Sam on a hunt in Vermont. It was a simple haunting—just a salt and burn. John had taken both of them to the graveyard that night, and they’d sat there while he worked—digging and digging and…
“What I mean is that I don’t know. We’re asleep. I hoped that if I held onto you, our dreams would merge. It seems I was right.”
Rodriguez reaches over and presses the five button, pausing for a moment to type on a keypad just below the floor numbers, cupping his hand around it for privacy. The code is ten numbers long. Once he’s finished, the elevator whirs and they start moving. “Arms out,” Rodriguez says, nodding at them from the corner.
Dean’s mouth hangs open. He tries to think of what on earth he can say to that. But before he can utter a sound, the back door opens, and Sam pokes their head in.
Castiel tilts his head, and his look is so stony that Dean can’t read it. After what seems like an eternity of this, he speaks.“Something happened. You’re...What’s wrong?”
. Dean averts his eyes instantly, disbelief overcoming him. His blood runs like ice through his veins.
He’s been trying to go through the files on his laptop for an hour, but there’s no actual organization system. Things are just there. A search for keywords in documents does nothing, and he abandons the effort way too soon.
Dean realizes pretty quickly after the phone call that he’s going to have to go back to work, which means going against Cas’ wishes twice. Well, at least he didn’t say he wouldn’t do it again? Yeah, probably not the best logic.
“No, Dean.” Sam stood up, lowering his voice. He looked behind him. Jack had gone to look for more books in another room. “We don’t even know that Jack would go to the Empty if he…” Sam looked down.
“Look,” Sam reasoned, “If we can find one reaper still alive, then we have Death. And if we have Death, then we have our way into the Empty
Dean sighed. Even at the end of existence, Sammy still couldn’t find it in him to get to the goddamned point. “Yeah?”
Betty held the blade up, eyeing it with wonder. Then, without another beat or a word of warning, she plunged it into her stomach. Her head fell onto the table with a
Eventually—Dean couldn’t estimate when—a frantic voice broke through the haze of Dean’s sorrow. “Dean? Dean!” It was Sam, looking for him. His footsteps stomped closer, closer until they stopped cold. Dean didn’t move his head to look at his brother. He just let it dangle, too heavy for his neck now.
. Because, why not? But also because he is starting to get restless, even in this huge apartment. It’s at times like these that he envies Cas. Dean wishes he could just teleport away, too.
The lights flicker on automatically, giving the room a dim glow. He isn’t sure what he was expecting, but it wasn’t...this, exactly. It’s a large room, almost a warehouse—at least fifty yards in width—filled with rows and rows of...filing cabinets? No, not quite. Dean steps forward, tilting his head to get a better look. They’re...lockers, stacks of locked, unlabeled cubby-holes, each with its own keypad.
Dean almost laughs. “What, sibling? That’s what I’m supposed to say, right?” Why’s he so weird all of the sudden?
He could feel the blackness returning again, only now it felt comforting, familiar. Maybe he could just let himself fall...
After hearing nothing from Sam, Dean gets antsy. It’s well into the afternoon, and he and Cas haven’t spoken since that morning. He isn’t sure what Cas usually does to entertain himself—maybe he helps with hunts—but he seems content to sit across the living room next to the bookcase and read. It’s a fascinating sight to watch, Cas in his undoubtedly expensive loungewear, legs crossed over leather upholstery, his face drawing up in a smile every so often.
Dean doesn’t have a response. What can he say? It’s true. It’s true, and he didn’t even do what he set out to do. He thought he would be home by now.
“What do you mean?” Jack chimed. Dean almost startled at the sound. He’d crept up to the table so quietly that Dean scarcely noticed. “I thought I couldn’t get there the same way Castiel did.”
Just as suddenly as it had set in, the pain stopped. For a moment, curled on the floor of—wherever he was—he didn’t even notice, still spasming in the aftershocks.
Then, just as he’s bracing himself against the metal, preparing to look again, he hears a voice: “Winchesters,” it says in an inscrutable tone, but that voice—
Without missing a beat, Dean leaned down and kissed Cas. It was deep and warm—Cas was so soft. With each rake of his teeth and flit of his tongue he said, again, and again,
“It’s this, like, room where they keep records that are too sensitive to be digitized. You have to wear gloves and everything. It’s not climate-controlled like the archival room, but I’m definitely going to have to get a look in there lat—”
“What’s the number again?” Dean asks, gripping the suitcase. The box rattles around inside as he lurches forward, choosing a direction even though he’s not sure it’s right.”
Everything Dean needs to say floods his mind. He knows what he should say, how he should apologize. He can feel the words threatening to spill out of him while Cas sits there with his expectant look.
“It was Chuck. The whole time, it was Chuck.” Sam said, massaging the space between his eyebrows. He looked like he hadn’t slept, and there was a coldness to his words, like he was on the edge of rage. Dean knew that measured tone all too well.
Dean loses himself in it, biting and suckling, skin burning. Will he ever get to do this again? Cas nuzzles himself into the crook of Dean’s neck, and Dean cries out.
Dean gets out of the car, gun cradled, and he laments at how much cooler this whole thing would look if he had been driving Baby. Right—he needs to focus.  The demon blade sits cool against his waist. He grabs at it.
“Right. You know, it’s okay...Like I’m not—I won’t... ” Sam runs a hand through his hair, shifting closer to the door.
So, the “they” thing is definitely one hundred percent intentional. Another thing to deal with after his (not his) engagement explodes. “But what if—”
A moment passed, and Dean thought to shake him again, harder. Before he could try, Castiel awakened with a gasp, panting as he inhaled the life back into himself. Dean pressed his face into the crook of Cas’ neck, shedding tears onto his skin. “Dean? Is that…?”
Dean looks up at him, finally, and finds that Cas has been staring this whole time. Weirdly enough, it doesn’t seem creepy. Just more...attentive? Cas raises his eyebrows like he’s waiting for something. “What?” Dean asks, now fully distracted from
Dean thinks for a moment that it’s weird Sam hasn’t called, but then he guesses they only just spoke this morning. The thing is, he knows he needs to be doing what he does—
Jack frowned and tilted his head, and for a moment he looked just like Cas. Dean blinked, grounding himself back in the moment. He braced against the back of a chair in the map room. “It seemed very angry the last time I showed up,” he said, looking down in thought. “I’m not sure what would happen if I went back there.”
Sam finally does, and his face...it’s enough to stab Dean through the heart. “What do you want me to do, Dean? Huh? You keep saying....
Dean squinted through the rush of pale light, proceeding with caution into the bookcases. He recalled the first time he’d come here, his death wish, lamenting about being unable to save everyone. He still felt that guilt. What was he for if he couldn’t save the people who needed him? Now, here he was again, and not much had changed. It was worse, worse than he could’ve ever imagined. Those people? Cas, his mom—hell, the whole goddamn world—he’d
They break the hug, and Dean steps back to take her in. She’s wearing a pastel pink pantsuit, and it’s incredibly elegant. A HunterCorp lanyard—which predictably names her as Head of IT—dangles from her neck, She waves a bottle of wine. “I got the overpriced stuff.” She winks. “Don’t worry, you can reimburse me later.”
“You’re supposed to log onto your therapy session in seven minutes.” Cas says matter-of-factly, but there’s a lilt to his voice that reminds Dean of when he was little and had to convince Sammy to get in the bathtub. Shit, he’s actually going to have to go to therapy, isn’t he? It’s either that or tell the truth.
? Then, he remembers, and it’s like ice in his veins. He bites down on the inside of his cheek, hard.
. He glanced over at Sam, who’d cracked open another book, but Dean could tell when he was invested, and he wasn’t. He was distracted. Paying half-attention.
The reaper grasped the bookshelf again, the confidence she’d seemingly gained slinking backwards into terror, uncertainty. Before he’d even finished, she said, “No. No. Why would you even…?”
“Okay, then. Have a nice break, Mr. Winchester. See you tomorrow, Dr. Winchester,” she says with a wave as she leaves. Dean doesn’t even have to look at Sam to know that he’s smirking.
“If I die, I’ll become Death.” Dean tried to read her expression, but it was somewhere between disbelief, terror, and hope. She took a breath, and her lips fell into a slight grin. “Death,” she said again, like she was testing out a new name, seeing how it felt. “Okay.”
How’s Dean supposed to remember the name of Sam’s fake secretary? He’s in the middle of something. “Well,
A woman in a pantsuit stands in front of a projection screen that pictures a line graph, the words HunterCorp printed boldly at the top. What? “So, Mr. Winchester,” the woman says with a nod to Dean. Then, to Sam, “Dr. Winchester.” Dean and Sam share a look of confusion for a second, but Sam settles back into his chair, eyebrows raised.
Dean stood up, slamming the chair against the table. He couldn’t hold it back anymore. Not even in front of Sam. He grabbed the angel book and chucked it against the wall. “Like hell you do! He
When Dean’s eyes opened once again, he was surprised, needless to say. Even more surprising—a certain blue-eyed angel stood over him, offering his hand. “Cas?” Dean tested. He took Cas’ hand and let himself be pulled upright.
There’s a thunderstorm the next morning. Dean hasn’t slept. Not for lack of trying, either. He checks his phone. 6:32 am, nothing from Cas, and he isn’t sure whether to feel bad or grateful. He rolls out of bed, rubbing at his neck. The pillows were too stiff.
After he’d said his piece, he got no more resistance. Gripping his angel blade, Dean took the key and pressed it into the brick wall of the bunker’s library. Even though it was his second time doing it, he still startled a bit when the door actually appeared. Now, all he had to do was just...open it. He glanced behind him, Jack and Sam standing helplessly across the room. Sam pressed his mouth into a line, biting something back.
If Cas were asleep, Dean would have peeled himself away as slowly as he could muster, careful not to make the change of weight too apparent. But Cas doesn’t sleep. So, when he finally decides to wriggle his way out of the covers and plant his feet on hard ground, he can feel Cas staring at him.
Dean looks from Sam to the computer, then back again. “He didn’t think it was weird you were asking all that stuff?”
When the door finally swings open, though, it’s not Sam who does it. The demons must have been expecting hunters. Dean and Sam are scarcely able to take one step before they’re thrown against the brick wall.
Sam’s face falls, and his hands fly to his head, checking to see if it’s true. Dean laughs. After a moment of brooding, Sam pulls a phone out of his pocket. “Let’s look ourselves up.”
, so Sam’s pronouns are he/they and he identifies as non-binary. He wrote a whole essay about it. It was really thought provoking…”
“Well…not much. It looks like the public knows about supernatural creatures, but a lot of stuff must still be secret. I couldn’t find anything on angel grace, not even on the dark web. There’s some speculation about a vague...essence I guess, but nothing concrete.”
Dean blinks at him, and he notices his hand begin to tremble. Castiel notices, putting his hand over Dean’s the way he had last night. “Yeah?”
“Dean!” Castiel shouted. He dove at Dean and slid towards him, enveloping him in an embrace. Like instinct, Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, tight, chin digging into his shoulder. “You have to hold on,” Cas said.
Then, through the haze of his pain, he regained control. Just for a moment. He let out a strangled breath, an agonized howl before, “Cas! Castiel!”
Dean really wants to kill him. “Tomorrow we need to work on finding some archangel grace so we can open the rift.”
The car pulls up to an unassuming street block, and it looks quaint, save for the garbage bins toppled over on the curb. “Have a nice stroll, Mr. Winchester.”
Maybe this is the right way to do it. He’s got no idea how Other Sam and Dean swung it, but they’re saving lots of people. Or, at least, thirty-two percent of them. That’s a lot. He jiggles his knee under the table and wonders how much longer the meeting will go on.
it, but every time he reaches for the knob, he catches a glimpse of Sam’s face, and his hand falls away. Dean can’t even lean over and complain about how absurd it is that he’s driving a Range Rover instead of the Impala.
Dean shakes his head. “I don’t deserve your help. I don’t deserve...you.” The thought occurs to him that maybe, just a little, he’s talking to his Cas too.
“Morning,” Sam says. Dean pours the last of the coffee into the mug and sets it down again. Sam makes a frustrated grunt and leans over to pick it up, walking it over to the sink. “You know if you leave it it’ll get crusty.”
“What we know is…” Dean begins, “Demons, they...they need vessels. So, if the demon is still…” Dean swallows. “Still in Jade, then she’s alive. Or...it could have switched vessels.” Or she could be dead.
Dean didn’t remember exactly how he’d gotten there, but there was a lake next to the graveyard, frozen over in the dead of winter. He must have wandered over, bored at the dull clang of the shovel against the ground. He put a foot forward, onto the ice. Then another, then another. He didn’t know why, but each step away from land exhilarated him, made him feel strong. He’d made four steps before he heard it.
For a rich guy, Dean figured Other Dean would have some gaudy apartment that took up an entire street block. And it’s certainly big—like, scream-and-there’d-be-an-echo big, there’s no denying that, but it’s also cozy. It’s not a bright, clean white like the inside of the HunterCorp building. It’s muted, calming—deep browns and greens—a buffer to the busy world outside the windows.
Thank you so much for spoiling me with the comments! I get unreasonably excited for every single one.
She stumbles over toward the nightstand and turns on the lamp, providing the room with a dim, warm haze of light and hops onto the bed. She looks over at him with a kind smile, and he feels guilty.
Sam runs the pot under the faucet and doesn’t look at Dean. “Did you sleep in your clothes?” Dean looks down. Right. He’s wearing the same shirt from yesterday, minus the pants.
That’s...It would just be leading him on, wouldn’t it? The poor guy doesn’t know the difference between his Dean and this Dean. And, unfortunately, this Dean doesn’t...He loves Cas, just not like that.
“Some of them. Like, there was one conducted a couple years ago to see if they could turn a vampire human again after it's already fed. And get this—it was
Dean raises an eyebrow. He guesses he’s never thought about it like that before. He thinks of something his Cas said to him once.
The chair beneath the Empty’s form disappeared, and it leaned back, letting its arms dangle behind it. Blackness poured out of each orifice of its face, oozing, shooting outwards like appendages.
“Tell me the number again.” Dean feels almost naked without his gun tucked into his waistband. They couldn’t bring any weapons because of the dumb metal detectors—not that it matters. They’d have to surrender their weapons once they got to the headquarters anyway. Dean tenses. Sam better know what the hell he’s talking about.
Sam gives in and sets the bowl on the mantle, taking a sip from the bowl as he does. He wipes his mouth. “We gotta go to DC.”
Cas blinks. He turns to Dean. “What stuff?” he asks, the amusement his voice had carried before traded for confusion. Sam opens his mouth, then closes it, backing up to lean against the stone of the fireplace. “Dean?”
. “No, I just…” He takes a breath. “I’m just...I’m disappointing him. I can’t give him what he wants.” He feels heavier once he says it, and he knows it’s probably the most honest thing he’s said since he got here.
Dean digs his fingernails into his palm. “We were...in a hurry,” Sam supplies, “We’ll be sure to check in next time.”
Dean sits in a virtual waiting room for a minute. He’s almost started to zone out before the dumb loading circle is replaced by a woman with long, dark hair. “Hi, Dean,” she chirps.
When Cas goes into the other room, Sam sits down next to him. He’s not wearing anything weird like yesterday, just a plain t-shirt and jeans. It’s almost something Sam would actually wear. “So…” Sam says, “Trouble in paradise?”
Cas frowns, reaching for Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, I...I just want to know how to help you. I need you to let me.”
Of course, imaginary Sam was right. Once she became Death, however timid she seemed now, she’d be hard to control. He sighed, clasping his hands together. “I need to wake up someone.”
It’s a long while before Sam answers. He just crosses his arms and turns his head to the side. Dean has almost forgotten what he said in the first place when Sam pushes a quiet, defiant, “No,” through his teeth.
Dean crosses his arms over his chest. “I’m not pretending to be anything. I’m just trying to get home.”
Whatever differences there might be between this Cas and the one back home, they’re both profound. “What’s the plan for today?”
“Doesn’t matter. All we need to do is get the grace and get gone.” He pauses, nudging Sam on the shoulder. “C’mon, we just...do what we do best.”
, which plays loudly on the projector screen that descended like magic from the living room ceiling, its score filling up the room with suspenseful tension. Dean’s shoulder to shoulder with Cas, who’s shoveling an alarming amount of popcorn into his face. Once in a while, he tilts the bowl over to Dean, asking, “
“Yeah...yeah. Never mind.” Sam pulls out his laptop and averts his eyes, trying to hide his head behind the screen.
“The victims were, thankfully, unharmed...yet they remember being wounded prior to regaining consciousness.”
“Right…” Dean wrings his hands together, eyes trained on the keypad. “Why don’t we try something we’d set it as?”
“Tell me what? That everything’s fucked?” Dean bit, huffing an exhale. His ribs felt sore from crying.
I’m working on it. You need special clearance to access each item, and you only have that for a handful of them. The codes are auto-generated every day at midnight, so I’ll need to access their system.”
“What case?” Even though he has no idea what she’s talking about, the words still come out quick and urgent. At this point he’d take any distraction from his whole...domestic situation.
“Great.” He sits up, the familiar feeling of adrenaline rising in his chest. “When’re we doing this thing?”
“A lover.” Lover. The word is so tender on Cas’ lips. Again, another intimacy not meant for him. “And here? I’m just a humble observer of creation.”
Dean straightens his jacket, and he realizes it’s some kind of tan overcoat with big, showy buttons. “I’m probably a busy guy, Sammy. I don’t have time to remember stuff.” He pauses. “Hey, did she say ‘break’? Where am I going?”
s when he saw her. He stopped cold, locking eyes with her. She sat with her knees drawn to her chest, and her eyes widened at the sight of him, her gaze darting from his blade to his face and back again. She made a frantic shuffle to get off the floor, using the bookshelves to steady her.
Sam and Dean sit at the dark oak breakfast bar, and neither mentions that they’re from a different universe. Cas takes a couple ladle-fulls from the large pot on the stove and puts them into two bowls, setting them down on the bar. Cas leans against the counter, waiting for each of them to try what he’s made.
Dean opens his mouth, but it snaps shut just as quick. This situation really isn’t fair...to anyone. Sam resumes walking. “Come on. I have an idea.”
on his own? It doesn’t seem right to be taking up so much...space. Did he have someone to wipe his ass for him too?
Dean reaches beside him for his gun—he dropped it when he fell. If he can get to it, he can stop these guys with a couple devil’s trap bullets. He makes the move, but his hand cramps, contorting in pain. The demon in Jade laughs. “I hope we don’t disappoint.”
Sam scoots his chair closer to Dean’s to show him the screen. On it is a picture of the HunterCorp headquarters. It looks less obnoxious than the one in New York, not so...loud. Though, even from just the websearch image, he can tell it’s armed to the max on the inside—it’s made out of that old stone that all those state buildings are. “So, this is where we’re going.” Sam pauses to pull up another window, which is opened to a scanned document. “And...this is what we’re getting.”
Sam stops and glowers, staring ahead. “If something goes south, we could go to prison. I mean, that would fuck up everything for the...other me and you.”
probably mad. Anytime Dean calls, Sam just says, “Working on it. Be ready.” Ready for what? If Cas wasn’t hovering around him all the time, maybe he could go and find out. But he can’t.
“Nine twenty nine!” Sam calls from across the room. Dean bounds over to meet him, a little annoyed that he couldn’t just say that before. He meets Sam at the beginning of an aisle marked
“Dean…” came Sam’s voice again. It sounded hoarse and ragged, like he might be crying too. “Dean, where’s Cas?”
It raised a hand at him, and he felt his throat close. He gasped, taking in what little air he could.
Sam’s pendulum takes the both of them to an abandoned warehouse—why is it always an abandoned warehouse?—one town over. It stops swinging when they arrive, and Sam puts it in their pocket. They give Dean the “it’s go-time” look, and Dean nods.
Dean shakes his head. “It better be.” Dean waves his ID card in front of the scanner and it flashes green, lock clicking open.
Castiel didn’t respond immediately, and Dean wondered if Cas might be taking him in too, seeing if he was real. “It’s...complicated.”
Dean slides the phone back into his coat pocket. They’re back on the train again and Dean can hear the demon blade sliding around, safe in the warded box on his briefcase—the one that was supposed to hold his ticket home. All the ingredients were ready, too. Just one vial of grace short. It irks him how close he was. And, what? Henrikson of all people was the one to stop him?
“Dean?” A voice calls, and Dean perks up. He knows that voice. Sure enough, Cas rounds the corner and into the living room. His hair is tousled, and he’s barefoot, wearing a dark blue sweater and jeans. It startles Dean. His Cas—the one from his universe—only ever wears one outfit. Cas stops by the fireplace for a minute, sticking out his hands to warm himself, before coming to meet Dean in the entryway.
“Standard protocol is exorcism…Doesn’t matter. Point is, they won’t ask questions. Brian says we go down to DC pretty often for it.”
cracks a smile. She looks down to scribble something. “So I take it that means a...healthy amount of sex?”
Cas looks down a moment. Then, he blinks away, the gentle whoosh of his wings echoing in Dean’s ears.
“No, not tonight,” Cas says. He waits a beat, and once he’s convinced that both Dean and Sam are enjoying their dinners, he rounds the corner, taking a seat on the stool next to Dean.
Sam’s already awake when Dean stumbles into the kitchen.  Maybe he couldn’t sleep either? He’s dressed, but Sam’s never gone hunting in an outfit like this. He’s wearing all black down to the boots with a tight, long sleeve shirt and weird zipper pockets down his pant legs. Dean squints against the light, taking him in before a beeline for the coffee pot. He leans over the counter, opening all the cabinets until he finds the one with the mugs in it. Sam leans against the stove, watching.
—all you want is to go back home. Get things back to how they were. What if I don’t want things back the way they were?”
Dean cracks his neck and stares out the window. “You’re not gonna answer him? He’s been texting you all day.”
In a swift motion, barely a few seconds, Sam whips out their gun and shoots two demons, stopping them where they stand. Sam gasps as the hold is freed on their throat, but Jade’s demon slams them back against the wall. He turns almost purple, nose bleeding.
Cas apparates an inch from Dean—wow, he’s never going to get used to that—and reaches his hand out to grasp the screen of the laptop. “You’re still in your pajamas.”
“Dean…” Dr. Chen says, drawing his name out. She puts her pen down and rubs at her chin. “Would you say...do you
Dean allows himself to settle in. He likes this. It feels...normal. It’s something they’ve all done before, and if Dean closes his eyes, it’s like he’s back home. Then Cas reaches down to hold his hand, and he’s in the present again. Suddenly, the movie feels off. His pulse quickens.
“Dean?” A voice comes from outside the door. It’s Cas. Dean tenses, and when he doesn’t answer, Cas opens the door slowly, like he’s trying not to frighten a deer. “Dean?” He says again, stepping in. Dean feels naked under his gaze. “Was...was that Henriksen?”
Dean stills at the entrance to the building, waiting for Sam to catch up next to him. He grips the briefcase in his hand, tight. Sam pulls the door open, giving Dean a final look of acknowledgement.
. Dead wasn’t gone. Not in this world. Not for Castiel. “What if we lose Jack, Dean?” Sam said, his voice quiet and tentative. He was always the negotiator, the guy saying,
They’re at the part where Doc Holliday pulls out his gun. He twirls it and shoots Johnny Ringo before he even has a chance to react, putting the gun back into his holster in one swift, smooth motion.
Dean reels, scrambling to his feet. There are three of them, all adults. But then, another figure emerges from the shadows. She looks about fourteen, but the carefree youthfulness he glimpsed in her yearbook picture is gone.
Dean nods. “Right. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Uh—” He makes a quick glance behind him—Cas halfway under covers, looking as intensely as he sounds. “Thanks.”  He braces himself against the mattress. “I’m gonna—”
“Absolutely,” Dean says, mouth full. Cas’ eyes brighten. “So, uh, you going to have any? I know you don’t eat, but…”
Wow. I hope this was worth the wait. I'm excited that the story is picking up momentum! Sorry for the wonky schedule :0, I just moved, so things have been hectic. Chapters should come out every 7-12 days. I thank you immensely for your patience and for your lovely, lovely comments and support.
He didn’t know how long it was that he sat there. Minutes? Hours? He couldn’t bring himself to move. To move would be to acknowledge that Cas was gone, and he couldn’t. How? There was so much he wanted to say. And now he couldn’t, not even in his prayers. The words had been poised on his tongue.
. His breathing switches from automatic to manual. Oh right. He’s supposed to say something. “I handled it.”
“But then, you’re so similar. Dean and I...We got into a fight about him working too much. We...we weren’t talking. He lost someone, then blamed himself. And buried it.” Cas tilts his head. “You’ve buried a lot, haven’t you?”
Dean now stood in the hallway of a hospital, outside a room. He peered through the window and almost fell backwards, the world feeling dizzy. Inside, laying in bed, was Lisa. Ben stood beside her, leaned over with his head on her chest.
Sam says nothing, but Dean can tell by the way he’s biting back a grin that he will have a lot to say about it later. Shit. This wasn’t...this is already so complicated and it hasn’t even been three hours yet. He and Cas are in a relationship? Dean feels himself go red.
—and sets his badge on the counter. Sam does the same. The man behind the desk takes the badges and scans them, his face expressionless. Dean taps his thumb on the counter impatiently.
Dean grunts, looking between Sam and the demon. Sam looks as if he’s about to pass out. He’s got to make a decision. “You wouldn’t hurt this poor little girl, would you?” the demon says in a sing-songy voice.
How could Dean have been so stupid? He sighs. “This is about what I said last night, isn’t it? Shit, Sammy. I didn’t
How much of what happened in his universe happened here? Did Cas raise his Dean from hell? Did he lose his grace and become human?
Dean stares up at the ceiling. The fan blows cool air onto his sweat-stippled chest, which rises and falls deeply and urgently.
“The, the piano, whatever.” Sam pulls out his phone and taps it; the music stops. Dean exhales, refocusing his eyes.
Does Henriksen know Cas is an angel? Dean thinks back to those engagement articles he read. How screwed would Other Dean be if people found out? “He doesn’t know anything.”
Suddenly, the world turned vertical, and Dean was on his feet, knife in hand. A sick excitement welled up in him, one he knew all too well. He felt a smile spread across his face, and his hand twirled the knife with precision, all of its own accord. He didn’t want this. He
“Okay, Dean,” Cas says, and the fact that Dean can’t read the tone of it is infuriating. But he’s gotta go.
He reaches up to rub his eyes, and Cas hums, a smirk forming on his face. “Awake?” he whispers. It’s the same thing he said yesterday at breakfast, in that same lilty tone, and it must be another one of their
A soft, gentle laugh escapes Cas. Dean’s almost startled by how fond it sounds, how warm. “You already protect the whole world. You don’t need to protect me too.”
section. He veered over to the side, running his fingers over the tops of the books. They weren’t stacked as high as before, and he felt a desperate desire to know which one would be his. There weren’t as many, but there were still a lot. He tried to take a breath.
Thank you for everyone who has kept up with this story! I haven't forgotten about it, and it's very dear to me. I hope this chapter was everything you wanted. I think in the next one we'll see about Sam's PhD lol.
, Sam! And you know what he fucking said?” His vision blurred, and he tried to focus, blinking the wetness out of his eyes. His voice faltered, falling to something more pathetic, more pained than a whisper. “He said he loved me.”
The Empty stopped twitching, seemingly intrigued. “Castiel? No, that angel and I have a deal. And no one seems to keep up their end of the bargain these days. You can’t have him.”
He decides to follow his senses to the kitchen, when his phone begins to buzz on the nightstand. It lights up, and a picture of him and Sam as kids, hugging, pops up on the screen.
Thank you so much for your comments! I read every single one and if I haven't replied to you yet I'll get to it soon. Sorry for missing a week.
As Dean and Sam step into yet another grand foyer, Dean panics. “I don’t even know where my apartment—”
Dean turns and looks at him, and it’s strange. He looks so...content. It reminds Dean of when Cas first woke up from his coma, but still, it’s different. There’s more assurance, firmness to it. “I’m sorry,” Dean whispers.
“There was nothing here,” Cas continues, gesturing with his free hand to the garden around them. “Just...asphalt, weeds.” He pauses, looking Dean in the eyes. “But then, someone decided something should grow. And so it did.”
“N-no,” Dean sputters, still flustered. “No, I...It’s…” He sighs. “I’m used to working all the time.”
The words sound far too human to be coming from Cas’ mouth. Then Dean realizes...this is it. This is when he’s supposed to say it, before it goes on any longer. “Cas…”
, well he probably knows everything Other Dean knows, right? Trust, effective communication, and all that. And on top of that, he’s an angel; he just
Dean rolled over, forcing his eyes open. There he was, in that trench coat, his head upturned and jaw clenched—ready for a fight. Dean reached his arm out, opening his mouth to speak—he couldn’t.
That was the first time Dean thought he might die, and that was what it felt like to sit on the floor of that room without him. There was no time to say anything. No time to think. He’d opened his mouth only for the air to catch in his throat. His lungs were flooded once again. They burned. The skin on his arm burned where Castiel had touched it—for the first and last time, he realized.
