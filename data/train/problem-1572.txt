Suddenly a hand was on his shoulder. "John, stop. You don't panic when you get blown up, and you're going to panic over waking up in a hospital bed? Not rational." The hand disappeared.
The sense of detachment scared John at times, that troubling emptiness that filled all his interactions, especially those with Mary. He wondered if she noticed, if she could tell that he was just playing at normality and not really achieving it.
After a few hours, there was hardly any evidence of the destruction that he could see. No more smoke, no more active fires. But anyone down on the ground would likely be able to see the evidence, the broken pieces of trees, the burned leaves, the pockmarked earth. John would always see the evidence etched into his own skin.
Sherlock could hear John's labored breathing, and as the stars and moon were brought back to the sky, he saw John's wide eyes, and his now trembling hands. The face of someone who took a risk, who shot blind and could only pray he hit his target.
him. It was so obvious to him now. How had he never noticed before? Or had Sherlock just made sure he didn't notice? Had alcohol just stripped away the veneer? Looking at him, at the honesty in those eyes, John was inclined to believe that that was indeed the case.
As he tapped out a reply, he glanced at John, who had stopped walking as well, waiting on him. He was looking at the sky. The storm from the day before had blown over completely, leaving the sky untainted by clouds and lightning.
– into his lungs as he considered how to get past the man. Part of him wanted to help, wanted to staunch the blood steadily seeping from what used to be the man's thigh, but the other part of him knew better. He had seen bleeders like that before, and if the man's face was any indicator, he didn't stand a chance. John bent down, falling a little too hard on his knees, and reached out to the man, teasing the destroyed fabric of his jeans away from the amputation. There was no way he would ever be able to stop the bleeding, no way to fix what had been done.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock.” It wasn't the response he'd been expecting. John had more to say, but he failed to say it, and Sherlock let the silence carry on, not knowing how to fill it either.
I came back to the flat late in the night. I had been savagely beaten. My shirt was torn and bloody. I thought briefly that if the killer had ruined my coat like he ruined the rest of me that he would not have been alive for Lestrade to take in to custody.
“No. It's a visual illusion, a trick of turbulence in the sky. Usually a star isn't an individual star either. Often what you're seeing are binary stars.”
Sherlock sat beside him, arms crossed over his chest and a sulky expression on his face, one that John had become more than accustomed too since they left District 12.
“I don't care. I told you I wasn't one of the angels.” Mycroft stood there, debating. “If you don't send me, I'll find a way myself. I'm the smartest one here. You know I'll figure it out.”  There was a tense and heavy silence. Sherlock began to feel jittery. “Give me five minutes in this form, and then you can do whatever you want. You can cast me out for all I care.”
“Well, now and then it hits me how little I know about you. I mean, I know you, but I don't know hardly anything
Perhaps that was behind the contradictions between her words and actions, a slip in the compartmentalization of her life. But it still didn't account for her careful study of the flat.
During the night, he had stared at one of the chairs in the flat. He never sat in it. All he could think of was how perfectly suited it was to The Man, equally worn, equally inviting. The kitchen looked like a place he would enjoy as well. And the empty upstairs bedroom. Or, if Sherlock were being more honest with himself, his own room.
“On the contrary, it's one of the only redeemable mediums left.” He tugged off his gloves, setting them to the side. It was impossible to look at John, and out of habit he let his eyes fall to the floor. It was always more difficult to maintain composure and eye contact at the same time; he settled for composure. He slid out of his coat and crossed the room to hang it up before slinking over to his usual chair to sit. By the time he was safe against the gray leather, John had moved to the bookcase and was reviewing the other titles.
.” John did his best to ignore the tone in her voice, and on a certain level, he felt like he couldn't take the snide remarks away from her. After all, she had a right to be mad with him, didn't she? But why did she feel the need to do this, to pick at all the tiny details of his now very comfortable life? What did she want from him? He almost said he was sorry, because he was, a little, at the way things had gone between them. It wasn't every day a woman loses her boyfriend to a man returned from the dead. But even aware of that as he was, he still couldn't wrap his head around why she would even want to be here.
Sherlock completed Mycroft's piece in one long stretch. He proceeded to stick it in his bedroom and forget all about it.
“Sorry?” He briefly wondered if Mrs. Hudson had brought him up, discussed him with this man that she was obviously relatively close to. But the look on Sherlock's face said that he had known nothing, his information about John was coming from elsewhere, somewhere internal judging by the look in his eyes. But how was that possible?
John felt fingers interlacing with his, and he couldn't help but think that he had seen more in his few days of blindness than in all his years of sight.
“I didn't think lilacs were poisonous,” John said. He withdrew his hand. “I mean, don't people plant them in their gardens all the time?”
Sherlock's eyes lit up when he saw the labs. He strode among the different benches, hands clasped behind his back.
“On the contrary, in a world full of opportunistic, fickle, and unpleasant organisms, dogs are perhaps the only creatures left on this earth that I have total faith in.”
,” she said, shaking her head in quiet awe. “I heard someone say that it dates to the 1640s, which in historical terms makes it feel like it was from the day before the disaster.”
The perk to being a poet, rather than a novelist, is that the people on the street rarely, if ever, recognized you. It was the closest one could get to being invisible even in a crowd. But that didn't make the crowds tolerable. The noise was the worst part. Why were human beings so goddamn loud all the time? Didn't they ever shut up? Why did everyone feel the need to drown out everyone else? It was like an unspoken competition between the billions of people on the planet, everyone trying to make the world notice them, when they had done absolutely nothing worth noticing.
“John? John Watson?” John turned as a large man came up to him, a smile on his face. “Stamford. Mike Stamford.”
John couldn't stop the laugh from escaping him, and after a moment, even Sherlock was forced to concede and laugh with him. “Sure, he looks like a Henry. Just don't let your brother find out why you named him that. He'll never let you live it down.” The dog nudged John's hand, already missing the human contact, touch-starved.
Holding out one hand, he beckoned to John, urging him to come forward. He would have just said so, but the words kept dying in his throat. John nodded stiffly, taking a few shaky steps toward him. Sherlock closed the distance and met him halfway, grabbing him by the arm.
But still, he couldn't shake the feeling, the coldness of never knowing, of never having any sort of emotional or mental closure about this or any of the conundrums that had puzzled him over the years.
“Must you make everything difficult?” Sherlock had only smirked. “We have a meeting for the two of you scheduled for the end of the week. Try to make a good impression.”
John pushed his way through the crowd to get his coat from his table across the room. He broke through the wall of people and stopped at his chair for a moment, picking up his coat and feeling overwhelmed.
The woods exploded again, this time several feet closer, shattered pieces of wood and bark flying at John like shrapnel. No, not
She talked more than he did. He never knew what to say. But she didn't seem to mind and told him all sorts of things about her district, about their industry and what sort of place it was. When she told him how urban, how industrial it was, it seemed dissonant. Molly didn't look like someone who lived surrounded by gray buildings. She looked at home out here in the woods, like she was meant for it. But everything she told him about District 8 gave him a bleak mental image incongruous with the kind of world he associated people like Molly with.
Sherlock didn't even notice Irene was in his house until she turned on all the lights. He squinted, glaring at her as she stood by a lamp, rolling her eyes at him.
“Tell you the truth, I don't have many loved ones, and I was there alone, so I suppose in that regard I'm luckier than most people there were.”
does not matter right now, Sherlock. What matters is that we have to be able to put up a united front. We have no choice where that's concerned. Anything else, it's a moot point. This isn't something either of us can do alone.”
“Are you John Watson? The mystery writer?” He looked thrilled by the very thought, so John made an effort, forcing his Public Smile onto his face despite the fact that he felt like blacking out for several days, maybe taking some tips from his sister.
“Yeah. Mine's in an old building. Creaky floors, heater that doesn't work too well, mismatched wallpaper and furniture. Yours actually looks like it belongs to a responsible adult.” He smiled, hoping it was convincing and self-deprecating enough to suit her.
No speech, not for a long time. Just the baked white stone barrier between them and the world, the sound of the ashtray's metallic little clinking on the table as Sherlock tapped his cigarette too roughly against it. The heat should have felt oppressive, should have smothered them both and crushed words and thoughts alike, but it didn't. It was insulation. It was peace.
Later that night, when John was on his way to bed, he asked again, “Are you sure you don't need Mrs. Hudson to open up the other bedroom?”
He texted me once or twice during the evening. He was not alarmed yet, merely annoyed. I did not reply.
"I have to know the time frame in which I'll be required to act like a decent human being, don't I?"
When he came up to Sherlock, reaching out for his hand, Sherlock didn't flinch and seemed mildly impressed by John's very simple idea. He watched in silence as John bandaged his hand, the latex gloves harsh against his skin, but so much better than no touch at all.
Sherlock shifted in the trees, trying to get a better vantage point. From his angle, he could just make out the dark form of a shadow sitting against the cliff on a ledge above the other tributes. After a moment, the shadow shifted, moving closer to the edge, scoping out the tributes just as Sherlock had. And in a second of illumination where the figure was not thrown entirely into blackness, Sherlock got a quick look at his face. Had it been anyone else, he wouldn't have gleaned anything from that brief moment of sight. The man sat back against the cliff wall, thrown back into hiding.
“There's more than one bomb,” he said. He was a wiry character, dark hair and eyes, in a white T-shirt that seemed pristine after the dirt and grime of the gallery. The man didn't seem to notice John, not really. He, like all of the other bystanders, was far too preoccupied to tear his eyes away from the spectacle. “They had been doing rescue work, but they found the other bomb, so they called everyone out till they could make it safe again.” John thought that the man seemed a little too happy about all this, but chocked it up to human beings being macabre and terrible, always gawking at the disaster, never able to look away.
“Obviously.” They came to a stop in front of Baker Street, where their night had begun. “What? You thought that we'd have this one night and never speak to each other again? I don't find that very likely, do you?”
After nearly two weeks of this, Mrs. Hudson cut off her own train of thought to say, “Oh! Before I forget! I was wondering where you're living, since you said you only recently came home?”
“We survived because we were lucky. We will have to play this act for the rest of our lives. It's not just a smile at the camera, Sherlock. This act, this trick we pulled, it's the only reason we're alive now.”
Sherlock clamped his eyes shut for a moment, and then glared at the face in front of him, telling himself over and over
He sighed, rubbing his hand over his eyes. No matter what he kept telling himself, he knew the answer.
Sherlock stood, crossing the room to his violin. It had been a while since he'd tried that. Maybe it would work this time, would drown John out.
Without another thought, I wrapped it around my neck, grabbing my coat from the hook on my door as I left.
“That depends. Do you want me to?” He leaned his arms on the table, expecting banter even though he hadn't said it as a joke. Initially, he meant to. But it didn't come out that way in the end.
"I wouldn't blame you for hating me. I sometimes hate myself, too. But I do care about you. A great deal. We just closed the case on Moriarty's network today, and I refused to wait another day before coming back. Because I wanted to see you again. I was just praying you would want to see me again as well."
John lay back beside him on his side with his back to the wall. After a while, Sherlock turned to his side as well.
“No?” John ran his fingers over the words, like he could pull the truth from them through touch alone.
"John had for so long believed that meeting Sherlock had saved his own life that he had never considered that the reverse might have been true as well."
“Jesus? Seriously? You fall off the face of the earth for days, don't answer any of your calls or texts, and all you can say is
Lestrade sighed as he sat down. "Look, John, all I'm telling you is what we know for sure based on the evidence we have. And the evidence says that the man we found on the roof of Bart's is an actor named Richard Brook, just like the papers are talking about."
"I survived war, he would tell himself, I can survive this. But so many nights he wasn't so sure, and he grew to wonder how he survived the war at all."
She was the only thing standing between him and living honestly and happily for the first time in his life.
"Since when do you do anything for Christmas except play some carols on the violin and sulk over 'everyone being too blinded by the holidays to commit a few murders'?"
Sherlock stood at the window of his living room, watching John walk home, his hand unconsciously flexing at his side. It was for the best really. At least, that was what Sherlock told himself when he went to sit back down.
Sherlock regarded him carefully, and they sat in silence for a while. Sherlock was the one to break it.
“I know I'm not an arena type. I'm not aggressive. I'm not strong. I'm not even all that brave. I'm not a killer. When they called my name, I thought, this is how I finally die. There's no sense in causing anyone else any pain before I do.”
“That's not why we're going. We're meeting a friend of mine. So do me a favor, yeah? Wear that coat of yours, and keep it shut.”
“Only the Capitol could make woods in the middle of winter so noisy at night. I wish they'd turn down the damn volume,” John said, more to himself than to Sherlock. Sherlock quirked a smile. John said Sherlock had the observational skills, that he knew everything with a glance, but John knew the insides of people's heads just as well, even if he didn't intend to know them.
you doing this?” He hated that his voice broke. Sherlock looked something like contrite, but John wasn't sure he bought the act.
Their father stood from his chair, becoming different just as she had. Instead of the verbal boxer, he grew stony and silent for what felt like the longest time. John and his mother had watched the two of them stand there staring at each other, Harry's body clearly primed for ducking and running, his father's trying to conceal how instinctively his fists balled up.
John was used to silences with Sholto, but they were always comfortable silences. But not this one. “You think I was in love with him, don't you?”
“Congratulations, Mr. Holmes. I guess you are a proper genius.” The man didn't look despairing, but strangely at peace. He reached into his pockets and pulled out more of the berries, handing them to Sherlock. “Or maybe you're just lucky.” Sherlock took them, examining them closer now that the threat of death was removed. At least, he hoped it was. He hoped it wasn't a bluff on the man's part. But then he saw it, the slightest difference in color. It may have been more easily detectable in daylight, but at night? It was barely noticeable even to Sherlock, let alone the other tributes. The man had been right. They had plenty of strength and training, but they weren't smarter. Even Sherlock had gambled a bit, reading the man rather than his weapon of choice.
you.” He lowered the knife, keeping a firm grip on John as he held the point of the blade over John's chest. “I'll burn
John was not doing well. It was coming up on the anniversary. It had been nearly a year. But John barely noticed. Every day ran together now, all in shades of grey. Nothing stood out, and nothing much made him happy. He had done only some temp work in clinics. He hadn't had anything resembling a relationship. His dreams were haunted with technicolor replays of the fall. In one version, Sherlock had a great pair of white wings emanating from him as he stood on the roof, and as he said goodbye, they turned to black. When he jumped, they would catch on fire and turn to ash before his eyes, like Icarus in a blue scarf.
She nodded. “We stumbled across each other in the woods. He could have easily killed me. But he didn't.”
Of course, he did have a tendency to alienate everyone who even attempted to be his audience. Like Molly, the pretty little graphic designer, or Lestrade, the curator. Even on the best of days, they could only tolerate him for so long.
John looked at Sherlock. It was hard not to see him as the injured boy brought to him all those years ago. Now, finally removed from the pomp and circumstance of the Capitol and the brutality of the arena, the reality of this man was so obvious that he wondered how no one else seemed to see it.
He tried to take some comfort in knowing that he walked the same floorboards, stood at the same windows, but somehow it all felt hollow.
John pushed open the door to his flat, breathing a sigh of relief at the promise of peace and some time alone.
“I don't know about that. Probably he knew if he sent you to me that it wouldn't get lost in the shuffle or stolen. But maybe he did want me to have it. He was a boisterous man, you know, which was charming, but it also meant it was rather difficult to tell when he was being serious or when he was joking around. A very vivacious man.”
A few hours later, they were sitting a few feet closer. Sherlock still hadn't said much, always redirecting the conversation to John. John knew what he was doing, avoiding sharing any details, but he didn't mind. He answered Sherlock's questions, and was always happy when he could get a few words out of him in response.
, when a horrible thought hit him as he watched Sherlock slip into that mode of deep thought he often assumed.
John couldn't leave, of course. In fact, it took all his self-control not to go back to the OR himself and scrub in. But Lestrade kept him safely in a corner of the waiting room while he paced, rubbing his hands over his face, specks of dried blood brushing off his skin as he did. There wasn't really a reason for Lestrade to stay, he knew. He probably had work to do on Mary's arrest. But he was staying for John's sake, since the person who usually hung around when John needed someone there was currently laid out on an operating table.
When they broke apart, Sherlock spoke again, despite having to catch his breath first. “And while I'm perfectly willing to negotiate the matter of dismantling your computer, I really must find my way to a better violin, or at the very least have that one refurbished.”
For a while he felt frozen in a distant forgotten era, watching numbly as Sherlock picked up some of the pages in his uncovered hands, shuffling them with delicacy as Mycroft spoke, the familiar words exploding in John's brain like gunshots.
The whole interview felt hazy. Half of his brain was still thinking about the dead children. He could hardly focus on the simple questions Lestrade asked him. There was, of course, mention of how he volunteered for Harry, and John gave some reply about how he loved her, how they were family, how he could never let his family go when he could go in their place. He didn't think it would go over well if he said, “She's an alcoholic and would have lasted two seconds at best, assuming she didn't kill herself before training was even over.”
Thankfully it didn't matter that Sherlock didn't know what to say; John did. But then, novelists know more about dialogue than poets.
“I'm just trying to decide how much to try and bring in today. You know the streets will be more crowded than usual.”
"Well, if it's any consolation, when I woke up, I wanted to know if you were alive more than anything."
And he did, sitting up in a chair in Sherlock's room all night, in and out of a light sleep spotted with hazy memories of nurses coming in to check vital signs and push drugs through the IV lines in Sherlock's arms. There was a peaceful stillness to all of it, a comfort in the old hospital routines, the comings and goings of the staff and the way the nurses always quietly asked him if he needed anything. He never did, but he appreciated the gesture.
“The woman from District 1, Kitty.” He said her name like it left a bad taste in his mouth. “Repellant creature.” He winced when John's fingers neared the wound.
John took in his surroundings without opening his eyes. Cool sheets, needles in his arms and hands, a beeping machine nearby, gauze and bandages covering much of his skin. Hospital. John thought for a moment how odd the sensation was, being the patient instead of the doctor. He could hear the nurses and staff in the hall, rolling the vital signs machines and chatting about their days as they made rounds.
of them. The poet himself actually said to me once that all poetry was either about death or love, in some capacity or another. I can't help but think he's right.”
Sherlock smiled. “Truly industrious little creatures. Certainly meriting a program devoted to their habits.”
“I won't hurt you.” She watched him skeptically, the winter wind tearing at her long hair. After a while, she came closer, and John saw some of her things sitting beside him, where she'd likely been moments before. She still held the knife in her hand, but she no longer pointed it at him.
“You do all that because you're bored?” John let himself be led through the labyrinthine rooms of the house, trying to take in as much as possible. There were paintings all over the walls, many of them of gardens and landscapes, and despite everything being immaculately clean, the furniture gave the impression that its natural state was covered in a thin layer of dust and decay. They passed rooms with doors tightly shut, and others left open, revealing all manners of things, including multiple chemistry sets. Even the kitchen at the back of the house had chemistry equipment on its table, burn marks in the wood, and pieces of unidentifiable greenery littering the surface.
. You are going to have to let people into your now very public life. You don't get to lock yourself up and pretend you're not human like everyone else.”
Sherlock was on the ground across the street. There was no way he could possibly be alive, yet John still refused to believe that the rapidly growing pool of blood belonged to the person who had saved him so many times.
He ran his fingers over the white staring eyes and watched the deep blue creep into them. He smiled. They were now how he had envisioned them. They were never meant for white. Sherlock held the face of the statue between his hands, and after a long deliberation, most of which centered around what a downward spiral he was in, he brought his lips to the statue's in a reverent kiss. The color spread across the statue's entire face, a flush. There was no denying the lips were warmer and softer than stone. He almost thought he felt them form a smile.
“Certainly can't blame you for that. I imagine it's hard going into work, with people asking questions, though.”
Sherlock waited until he could no longer hear his footsteps before picking up the folder with his messy hands, leaving streaks of black across the manila. He scanned his eyes over the project, and while it was true that the clients could not be any higher up the British ladder, he still did not see why it was necessary to get him to do their conversation piece. There were plenty of other artists who would have jumped at the opportunity. He scoffed and tossed the folder to the floor. In the back of his mind, he knew he would eventually have to give in. Mycroft would make his life a living hell if he didn't. But it could certainly wait, and it would never demand his full attention.
John didn't ask for permission. He opened the bag and slid the phone out into his hand. Sherlock had never been without this stupid phone. John was amazed he hadn't placed it back in his coat pocket before jumping. The phone felt like it weighed a thousand pounds, and he set it gently on the edge of Lestrade's desk for a moment, afraid his shaking hand would drop it. He couldn't live with himself if he broke the only piece of Sherlock he had left. He still held the evidence bag in his other hand. It had no markings on it, no case numbers.
The agent said something to John, asked him a question, but Sherlock didn't hear it. He doubted that even John did, given that as he walked down the aisle toward her, he kept looking back, an easily distracted child making things harder on the teacher. Sherlock held tight to the book, wondering what certain things felt like without the protective cover of gloves.
As he walked through the trees, a woman broke out from the woods. She had been running, and fast, and tripped, falling to the ground in front of Sherlock. He pulled his knife out on instinct, holding it out in front of him. The woman looked up, panting and horrified, her eyes flitting to the knife and then to his face. She was the girl from District 8, the one John had always looked at so sympathetically. Molly.
John glanced at the new text message, darting his eyes around the bookstore as if the patrons could somehow read it too. He had a reading due in mere minutes, and though he already had a tendency to stall, he found the desire to do so even stronger with the appearance of this. It was from a number not already programmed into his phone, but was there really any doubt as to who it was on the other end of the line?
“What good would it do? They've never interested me. Dull, run of the mill. What would I say to them?”
He stopped, taking a second to wipe the look he was sure he had off his face before he turned around, offering a composed smile to John. “Yes?”
“Well, if they're broken, then they understand what it's like to live under the shadow of something. And if they're especially strange, then they won't care. Conventions don't matter to odd people, do they?”
There was a corpse in front of him. Sherlock's corpse, laid out on the ground in that big gray coat. No, that couldn't be real. They wouldn't have let him wear that into the arena. The body was rotted, the face pale. Weren't they supposed to remove the dead from the arena? They weren't supposed to be left to rot. So why was Sherlock's body at his feet, and how could he make it go away?
“You were very lucky, then. Got a set of pins in my leg for a souvenir.” She smiled, lovely and sweet as could be. “Sarah Sawyer,” she said, shaking his hand.
John made many remarks throughout the ordeal about wanting nothing more than to fall into a deep sleep wherever he could find a place to do so, but the reality was that he was wide awake, despite the overwhelming ache coursing through his body.
“I told you, years of observation. I've watched many people throw away what they want in favor of what they are supposed to want. It never works. Human error.” He spun the knob on the microscope, squinting at whatever he was looking at, vaguely displeased by what he saw. “If you want a relationship that badly, you'll find one.”
The living room had a few chairs, a sofa, a wall of bookcases, and a fire slowly dying in the hearth, left alone with no one to tend it. John paused there, kneeling down on the bricks, adding wood himself, stoking it until it grew to a blaze again. This place was doing all it could to tame his mind on this anxious night.
Sherlock considered this for a moment. "Your premise is sound. Do you believe, then, that people talk without speaking?"
As I dressed in a new set of clothes, I saw red marks on my skin in the mirror. My neck was mottled with them. I cursed to myself. I was in no mood to explain it to Lestrade, who could never resist inquiring about every tiny aspect of my personal life.
The arena came into crystal perfect view in an instant. Sharp mountains, and cold air, wrapped in winter. The trees were all bare save for the patches of evergreens in the forest. The tributes stood around the cornucopia in a clearing, surrounded on all sides by dense woods.
Mrs. Hudson walked into the kitchen with a tray. “I thought I'd bring you up something before I went to bed. I doubt you got anything like a proper dinner while you were out. Don't let me interrupt.”
“Yeah, I know you were there. He told me about you. He kept me up to date on a lot of his projects. You told me you were at the Hickman when we were together, and you told me all about it, but you know what? I never saw your name in any of the papers.” She never once moved from her perch near the kitchen doorway. “I looked at back issues, when I was investigating you, and you don't show up anywhere. You were a ghost at the Hickman. But I know Moriarty saw you there, and I know he saw you leave with something that didn't belong to you.”
I found what I needed in a seedy part of London. I sat in an alley nearby, feeding my monsters. My mobile had rung multiple times. Victor left a voicemail, worried about me. Mycroft had called as well. I did not answer either of them.
Sherlock remained at the back of the crowd during the rest of the session, and when the fans began to line up for autographs, Sherlock stepped in toward the end, the copy of
“A taste of things to come, my dear. I can do a lot more damage than blowing up some socialites and statues.”
"No. I like London. And I must admit, catching serial killers is much more interesting than clinic work."
John awoke groggy and disoriented, having finally fallen asleep, fully clothed, with the book of Whitman still open on his chest. His phone politely informed him he was running dreadfully late, resulting in him racing through the shower and trying to put himself together enough to appear to be a functional person. It was nearing noon when he went to the front desk and asked his cheerful greeter from the night before, “Is there any way you could call me a cab? I have to get into Glastonbury.”
. John would know that face anywhere. As he handed The Man his phone, he saw his hands, and the long fingers were unmistakable.
John wanted to move, to slide off the couch and kneel down beside Sherlock, to wrap his arms around him instead of this fleeting and distant touch, this single hand against him. He actually considered it, considered eliminating those final boundaries, but in the end he only sighed, deciding that this was neither the time nor the place for such things. Later, back in Baker Street, back where things were safer.
John stepped away. He sat down on the edge of the bed, leaning his arms on his knees. Sherlock went and sat beside him.
John took a few steps closer, picking at a loose bit of fabric on his gloves as he came to a stop beside Sherlock.
For one split second, I was too shocked to react, but that second passed so quickly it might as well have not existed at all. I shut my eyes, taking in this shared breath, and for once in my life, I lost myself in the realisation that finally, someone had managed to surprise me.
John kept to himself until the reveal of their scores. He knew he'd be in trouble with Mycroft, and possibly Irene as well, and he was nearly sure that even Sherlock would at least give him strange looks. He didn't want to talk to anyone, and so he hid as best as he could. He put off returning to their floor for as long as possible.
Block after block, he walked, hoping that distancing himself from Baker Street might distance himself from all these memories. But it didn't. The entire world was still only John Watson.
How was he supposed to answer questions, to play the part of the author, when all he could think about was this? It was as if he didn't have to commit it to memory; some animal part of him had already absorbed it into his body in its entirety, and all that mattered was the third stanza of this unknown poem. To hell with questions about
His father looked at him stoically, his eyes then falling to the book on the table, which John had not been quick enough to remove.
“Oh yes, though I knew him as a child, so perhaps my view of him is skewed. Nice young man, really.” The owner reached down for his own book and said, “I'll leave you to it. I'm afraid the husband hates it when I'm late for dinner.” John could hear the softness in his voice, but he was already walking toward his own room, flipping through the pages hunting down “Children of Adam” like a man hunting a tiger.
"My gift, yes? I can choose who I spend it with. Come on. We can catch the late showing. You've never seen a Bond movie all the way through, and we really must fix that."
John had never really given a damn about art, before Afghanistan. It had always seemed like something that only certain people were allowed to appreciate, people who had studied for years and been trained to pick it apart and understand it. But he had begun to find comfort in it himself, even if he knew next to nothing about brushstrokes and art styles, oil paint versus acrylic, traditional or mixed media. It wasn't that he had suddenly developed a great appreciation for the classics, the art school standbys like Michelangelo or Picasso. Instead, what it boiled down to, the real reason behind his fixation was much simpler: quiet.
“Do you see this?” Sherlock held the screen inches from John's face. “I am not the one in danger here, John, you are, and I will
John didn't truly grasp the gravity of the situation until he became the next bomb that needed to be defused. He had never dreamed that this was anything but another case, impersonal, not about them, just about the crime. But it
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at this rambling, and then said simply, “Well you look traumatized, freshly traumatized, and the only large scale traumatic event I've heard of lately has been the Hickman explosion. Logical leap. Half the city seems to be walking around in an identical haze because of it.” John felt foolish as soon as the words were out of his mouth. Of course. It was stupid to forget just how many people had been affected. The city had treated it like a great tragedy that touched everyone, not just those who were in the gallery themselves.
Behind him the phone's light began to dim to save its battery. After a few seconds, the screen went completely black, but the message was still there, as it always would be.
When John would inevitably return to his angel imagery, he could only laugh to himself, wondering just how high up Mycroft's friends were.
When sleep would finally come, it brought the dreams with it, the nightmares that would shoot him up in bed, leaving him with his heart pounding as the passing cars outside swept shafts of light over Baker Street. He hadn't been able to even look in Sherlock's room. But when the dreams would wake him, he'd be tempted, so tempted to go downstairs, to drown himself in the familiar. Instead he would sit up alone, hands to his head and near tears, mentally cursing the entire goddamn world for what it had done. The painting didn't even haunt him from its place in his closet. The Vermeer seemed meaningless now.
was, insinuating that they were partners in crime despite John's pristine military record. Sherlock tore into the man, likely would have grabbed him by his clothes and shaken him had John not pulled him back.
Back in their room, they left the balcony doors open, and even though the heat crept in steadily during the night, it felt wonderful. Not stifling, not uncomfortable, but heavy and sleepy and wonderful. There was nothing better than standing close to someone on one of these balconies, close enough to touch, always reminded of the fact that tonight you are safe and happy. Fuck the Vermeer, fuck Afghanistan, fuck the Hickman, and fuck all the awful things that had dared to taint Rome. Now it was all as it should be.
Then there were the children at primary school with me. Children are all about grand gestures. Every day there was a new declaration of love, and every day a new heartbreak. Every Valentine's Day, I would watch children feel miserable at having been denied another child's affections. I myself had been one of those children before. I refused to participate in what I believed to be a holiday that said the only expressions of love were glaring and obvious and trite.
“You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.” Sherlock hardly believed the words coming out of his mouth. It was a phrase the other angels would cringe to hear. But it was true.
Sherlock walked along the pavement by the Thames, hands deep in his coat pockets. The flat had become claustrophobic, and he had hoped being out in the open in the city would counteract the effect. It hadn't. If anything he felt more closed in by the hoards of people that apparently flooded the streets at night when he was ordinarily shut up at home behind closed curtains. When had he become such a recluse?
. He had always believed genius required an audience, and watching the parades of people walking by, he realized quite suddenly that he lacked one. Of course, he had the people who commissioned him, the people who raved about his work. But they only saw the finished product. They never saw what went into it, and that was where the true genius was. Sherlock saw so much more than everyone else, and every detail went into a piece. Even details that could not be made physical. If he painted a woman, he wasn't just recreating her appearance, he was recreating her entire being. Which meant that his knowledge of her broken family, her failing mental health, and the affair she was nursing went into that portrait just as much as her eye color did. But no one would know that. He had never had anyone with which to share the private secrets behind every decision he made.
“Jesus, Sherlock! I'm fine.” Another careful bit of footwork to avoid some of the Casablanca lilies.
“Fair.” John sounded tired on the other end of the line, his voice low, well-suited to the late hour. “I hate this, Sherlock.”
“Never mind. Just trust me. You can't walk around London like that. People will think you're crazy.”
He heard the faint sound of footsteps from somewhere farther down the train. Sherlock, no doubt, up pacing. The man seemed uncomfortable whenever he was forced to be still. John wondered if he was too nerve-wracked to sleep as well. Of course, that would have been a normal response, and there was nothing normal about Sherlock. John thought that might just help him in the arena, along with his detachment.
A few blocks farther and Sherlock came to a screeching halt, blindly reaching out and grabbing John by the wrist, pulling him into an alley. John could still hear the sirens, and the wide eyes and breathlessness that had taken over Sherlock produced an immediate sinking feeling of
SH: Both are meaningless. If people really wanted context, the about the author page would include more than four sentences. And it doesn't matter at all what the author's intent for anything is.
Sherlock had looked over Mrs. Hudson's old violin critically. He spent the rest of the evening giving it a tune-up and coaxing sound from it. When he was mildly satisfied, he started playing in it earnest, and John breathed a sigh of relief.
All John could do was smile back at him. It was safe to do that here. It was okay for once to be honest. And as silly as it may have been, it was soothing being able to pretend that the rest of the world didn't exist and that they were in some special type of limbo between real life and the conversations they had played in their heads for so many nights before falling asleep, never said out loud.
The next night, when John woke up, Sherlock was still in his place in the corner. John heard the occasional pizzicato note twang through the room.
He gave a small nod, glancing away for a moment. “I suppose everyone has their family secrets and traumas.”
“John, I was appalled when I heard. Mary had seemed like such a nice young lady. To think that she –” She shook her head, eyes clamped shut for a second in disbelief. “You think you know a person. Makes you wonder how anybody trusts anyone these days. The news was in a frenzy. You should have seen it. But I suppose you were preoccupied.” It occurred to John that at some point soon he would need to make a statement to the public to finally put them completely at ease, tell them Sherlock would be fine and make a full recovery. The news stations would likely say the same, but he was sure the public would want to hear it from him directly, and as tired as he was, he felt he owed them that much. “Everyone's been by,” she said. “The flat is filled with food and flowers, get-well-soon cards and the like. Everybody has been so kind.” There was a certain weight to being loved by so many people, and John felt overwhelmed by it, having spent so much of his life flying under everyone's radar. He'd expected to have a lot to say when he finally came home, but sitting eating breakfast in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen, he found he had no idea what to say to anyone. “John?”
you were.” He didn't say it with any sort of malice or reprimand, but still John felt like a child who's been caught by a parent. Sholto watched him, his face stoic as always, never giving away a single bit of what he was thinking. “You're not arguing with me about that, though I'm sure you've argued with Mary about it often enough, whether you realize it or not.”
He considered starting the book, but it was late, and he had already decided that any potential source of information deserved his full attention, not the distracted half-awake focus he currently had.
John rolled his eyes and put a smile on his face for the children on his doorstep, dressed in all their favorite Halloween attire. He and Mrs. Hudson had been spoiling every one of them that came to 221B all night. He couldn't help but genuinely smile when he saw them. They were all so happy and carefree, and he liked thinking that he sent them away even happier.
“Yes, as a matter of fact.” He opened the folder, pulled out a photograph, and handed it to John. It wasn't the best quality photo, taken with a zoom lens from a fair distance, but the face was unmistakable. “His name is James Moriarty, and he is a decidedly unpleasant character.”
John laughed. He guessed words like "pretty" weren't really part of Sherlock's vocabulary. "You know, Sherlock, you don't have to hang around here."
He smiled sadly. “Not really, Watson. But I appreciate the sentiment. Honestly, you help a great deal just by speaking to me.”
He and Molly were gone too quickly to tell, but John almost believed the man recognized him. He could feel his heart pounding, his body paralyzed with fear. It took three tries for Sherlock to get his attention.
“At some point I'll have to let you talk to our poet-in-residence. He's out now, often is, but I'm sure you two would enjoy chatting a bit.”
“Because forensics doubts that the Vermeer was destroyed. They believe it was stolen in the fray.” John's throat tightened, and he couldn't bring himself to look at Sherlock, a dark blur in his peripheral vision. If he did he would collapse. He would never be able to look at him now and keep quiet. “When factoring in that the other galleries who have been targeted have also recently acquired priceless pieces in their exhibitions, it stands to reason that the bomber is strategically targeting them for the pieces themselves.”
is going to be beyond unbearable. Cut as much of it as we can afford to cut. I'm sick of answering people's questions. I wish they'd just read the damn thing and leave me alone.” He reached out a hand to the Newton's cradle on his desk, pulling one of the silver balls back and letting it go, staring at them as they swung back and forth, the constant clacking oddly soothing.
The peace was oddly broken by something that would have brought a certain amount of joy to any other couple. They were at Mary's place one night, when she suggested they take a holiday.
John looked at him expectantly, and when Sherlock held out the canister to show him, John immediately took it from his hands and sat Sherlock down, kneeling in front of him to apply the medication, welcoming the distraction.
More to himself than to Sherlock, John said, "I guess that probably has something to do with why I had some dreams about serial killings."
Sherlock knew that if anyone was listening in that they would call him a heretic. But he wasn't an angel anymore, not really. Maybe in the world of technicalities he was, but John Watson had made him human. And he was beginning to think that was the better option, even with all the irrationality and pesky emotions. This was no longer a matter of protecting his charge, of doing his job.
Head should always rule the heart, but that is easier said than done when your heart is strapped to a bomb with the taunting sights of sniper rifles dancing across his chest.
of what John would have believed was a foreign concept. “Did you pick a public place to do this so that I wouldn't beat the ever loving hell out of you?”
“Yeah, sure, Baker Street.” Even as he said it, the man could stand the blood loss no longer, and John watched the light fade from his eyes as the man's hand slipped away from his.
He turned and cut through the crowd, passing Mike without a word on his way out of the shop. The brisk night air, when it hit him, seemed to wipe the smile from his face, replacing it with a creeping sense of dread.
"Oh. That does make my efforts at taking part in this holiday a tad in bad taste." John brushed past him back into the kitchen, putting the dishes on the counter and the remaining food in the fridge, which was blessedly lacking in body parts, for a change.
It was easy enough to get a little bit of work at a nearby clinic, and some small part of John was looking forward to the familiar mundane work. Tagging along with one of London's superheroes was tiring sometimes.
Sherlock Holmes was many things, but so many were things that other people made him out to be, when the reality was far simpler.
The two exchanged one more quick smirk with each other before the man walked away. Sherlock snatched up the suggested carton and quickly followed, carefully staying a safe distance behind the man. When he saw him choose a check-out line, Sherlock slipped in casually behind him. Without looking at him, Sherlock shrugged and said, "You would know better than I would," and set the carton down.
It was an awkward parting in London, much more so than John had anticipated. Sherlock had continued to verbally spar with him the rest of the way to the city, about a variety of topics. John couldn't deny that he was intelligent, if not a bit pessimistic. In its own way, it was the most fun John had had in weeks.
“Your faith in him. It's nice.” Her little smile returned as she filled the cup again, taking a drink from it herself this time. “It may sound silly, but it's nice to see something like that out here. Faith.”
John woke up and reminded himself of his situation so he wouldn't panic again. But in the back of his mind, he was worried that the bandages would never come off, or if they did, he'd be blind. He'd had strange drugged dreams to that effect. But Sherlock had said he'd be fine, and Sherlock wasn't one to protect people. If John was going to be dead tomorrow, Sherlock would tell him, not out of respect, but because it was fact. John was grateful he was okay, all the same. He could be so cold and callous and impossible, but he was Sherlock. John let out a heavy sigh. The hospital room was quiet. He wondered what time it was, how long it had been since he'd dropped off.
“Good afternoon and happy Hunger Games, everyone! And may the odds be ever in your favor.” With a snap of his wrist, Mycroft started the yearly propaganda film. Sherlock thought this was the worst part of the Reaping, sitting around, pretending to listen to the history that everyone could recite already. It was terribly dull. And then came the few words from the President. Sherlock found himself unnerved by the eyes of Moran staring down at all of them, smiling as amiably as possible for a man who allowed government approved mass murder every year. Then the video shut off and Mycroft began to speak, making Sherlock wish for Moran back.
"This is bad, Sherlock, really bad. This maniac is not going to just let us go. He didn't even want us to get out of that pool alive."
“What are we going to do with the rest of the night? We don't have to meet the client till ten in the morning.”
Sherlock followed safely behind John, and became confused when he took a few turns away from Baker Street. Why wasn't he going home?
I sat down on my bed, carefully avoiding the exposed springs, and looked at the devastation. I should have gone after him. I could have destroyed him, ruined his life. But I would be lying if I said I hadn't been shaken, that I wasn't bothered by the words spray painted across my room. I was still young, and while I was not the most sensitive of people, it still put a dampener on my day.
"You can't know that, John. Inadequate data." They started walking back to Baker Street. John was quiet. Sherlock looked down at him and saw a sort of tenseness on his face. "What?"
"Tonight, all of the kids are going to be coming by, trick or treating. It's an American custom that caught on. They go house to house for sweets."
We were sitting in a dark and crowded pub, and I felt jittery. I had spent most of the day strung out, and was beginning to crave my next fix. Victor, bless him, had been mostly oblivious. He was never the most perceptive man. He continued telling his stories, bright-eyed and grinning like a fool.
It was hard to believe that it was finally safe to sleep again. So many nights of having to be on guard and running on nothing but adrenaline and panic. John thought it would actually take him hours to fall asleep, but exhaustion beat adrenaline, and it took only minutes.
“And you know that here, they are. This one however, perhaps due to it being created rather than simply existing, is harmless. It's rather impractical, really, having this single
. John didn't care that he was an underdog favorite. Being well liked was worthless if he couldn't get anyone's attention.
John woke once during the night, dreams shaking him from sleep once again, visions of things he wished he'd never seen. He sat up in his bed, breathing deeply as he tried to calm himself. And then he felt the hand on his back, fingers splayed. Sherlock sat next to him, concerned but unsurprised.
“I'm a Career tribute, Sherlock. I could kill you both before either of you reached me. And you know it. My aim is better than yours.” He looked down the line of his arrow. “Come here, Johnny boy.” John frowned, confused. Jim spoke in singsong. “Don't test my
It was a bring the mountain to Muhammad situation, seeing Sholto. Ever since he'd come home from Afghanistan and turned into a recluse, it became increasingly difficult to even get him to walk outside in his own yard. He had hired people for anything that he needed and otherwise saw no one aside from John. But then again, John was essentially the only person left on earth who would willingly speak to him.
John rolled his shoulder, trying to break the morning stiffness, and reached for his gun. He would have one shot. It was a risk. But then, everything in the arena was.
He sighed. He had slept fitfully the night before, and while he hadn't noticed any pain in his leg while escaping the museum, he certainly noticed after the fact, the same old pain creeping up on him with a vengeance. A cruel joke, he thought, since his cane was part of the gallery rubble. He chided himself for not buying a new one from the pharmacy that night, but these practical thoughts kept being pushed from his head by the ring. He would have to deal with it at some point. It wasn't like the painting. He had been given clear instructions on what to do with the ring to an extent.
He sat again on the edge of his bed, reaching for the remote on the side table to turn the television on. All the major networks were reporting live from the Hickman, detailing what little authorities knew.
She stood on the other side, her profile just barely visible in the glass on the door, talking to someone. The man emerged into John's line of slight like a character appearing in the frame of a film. Molly smiled at him warmly, and he came up and kissed her cheek, his dark hair a sharp contrast across her pale face.
JW: Never. It's never been something I wanted to revisit. Besides, war is a different kind of crime than the ones I'm used to.
John had never been to Italy, unlike Sherlock, so he couldn't help but stare out of the car window at everything they passed. Sherlock spent the ride staring at his phone.
“No. But as I'm sure you're aware, there are many options available. Do you really want to consider what they might do in lieu of killing either of you?”
“No!” John stood up, listening to the dying reverberation of his own voice. He looked down at Sherlock and said, “I'm not leaving while you're sitting here wounded and covered in blood! I don't want to go! I'm sick of running and sick of fighting and sick of this whole goddamn nightmare! Don't you
When the song ended, Sherlock set the bow and violin down and turned around trying to act as if John wasn't watching him.
John shook his head. He wouldn't be following in Sherlock's footsteps. If the war hadn't driven him to suicide, then neither would this. He refused to give Moriarty the satisfaction of having killed them both.
John watched Sherlock expectantly, waiting for him to name the poet. Sherlock cursed the boy for speaking – even though a certain amount of him sympathized – but there was no way he could tell John the author. No way he could literarily out himself like that.
Sherlock didn't ask the barrage of questions running through his head. All of them came back somehow to: How does anyone genuinely like me this much? There had to be a catch. At the heart of it, Sherlock believed that this would be intense but brief. John would find someone else, or he would turn out to be a serial monogamist, Sherlock being only one small dot on his radar in the long term. He was torn between the options of letting himself enjoy this brief period, these small hours, or facing things realistically and getting out now before more damage could be done. But he didn't want out. And he didn't want to be a blip on the radar.
