it are two different things, I’m guessing. Well, the same holds true for me about this. Going out, doing normal shit, is kinda like a trial run.”
“We’re getting everyone out,” Dean declares, his broad shoulders squared—the sharp line of his jaw equally stubborn. “
His breath turned shallow, each one stabbing at his ribs like a knife. “I’m—I’m trying,” he whispered, hating his voice—and himself—for the way the words cracked down the middle.
“I hope this means,” he says, repeating the motion with Cas’s top lip. “That my soulmate has a little bit of a crush on me.”
“What? Too subtle? You think I should make it play the kazoo version of ‘My Heart Will Go On’? Ooh, or I could—”
? That you’ll be cool with him knocking her up with a few more kids? While you—what? Linger on the sidelines. Not looking for anyone else—because you know you won’t. That’s not
Not only had he practically raised his younger brother, but he’d thrown himself into the role of Ben’s parent almost from the moment he met him because he couldn’t help himself. Dean didn’t get openly “sentimental and shit” often specifically
Dean didn’t seem to mind, groaning low in a way that made Cas feel like his insides were burning hotter than the water around him.
Sam seemed to acknowledge the complexities of what Cas didn’t say with a half-smile, half-grimace. “I
The doorbell rang. Castiel fumbled to his feet to answer it, switching from his headphones back to his cellphone in the process. “You realize I never said that I
There’s a flash of grace in his eyes, a swirl of mist inside the crystal, and suddenly, we are not in Kansas anymore.
“Guess that’s something,” Dean conceded. The hand that he wiped over his face lacked a wedding ring.
A tiny smile crossed her face, and he felt himself unclench slightly at the sight of it. “I didn’t mean that to sound like a bad thing. But we’ve been in a rough place lately. Maybe even longer than we’ve realized,” she murmured under her breath.

is the revised one.” Again, the manilla envelope was waved, a little less like a white flag this time and more like a bullfighter’s red cape.
“You finally done reading all the labels on the organic honey, man? Seems like a lot of fuss for something that just—dissolves into your vessel or whatever anyway.”
“Apologies,” he muttered, sounding annoyed if anything. He turned to leave, only to give Dean a second glance, “Are you—that actor—?”
Then, Cas lifted his head to see Dean’s slack mouth, his darker-than-usual eyelashes fluttering wildly against his cheek.
“Uh, nothing,” Sam promised, glancing back down at his own options. “I’m going to get the black bean burger.”
“Sorry for dodging your last couple of calls. I thought you were Sam,” he tries to explain, then winces. Letting Charlie know he’s avoiding his brother isn’t likely to stop the screeching.
“Get outta my head,” I growl, firing again. But he seemed to anticipate my move and jumped to the side, causing my shot to bury itself in tree bark.
God, he was such an idiot. Cas had tried to tell him not to come to the launch, but he figured the author just wasn’t used to having a support system, so he didn’t expect one. Now, he realized Cas
impolite,” Balthazar quipped, turning a sharp corner. At this point, Cas wished that he had brought along a ball of twine to this labyrinth of halls, figuring that, without a guide, he’d never find his way out again.
“Gabriel!” Cas repeated, shaking his head, even though the other man couldn’t see him. “This… it’s gone on long enough. I know that I asked you for help after he threatened to out me and Dean as soulmates. And I know that you were…” The author didn’t actually know if there was a word for what Gabriel was, “
“Because… you’re human?” Dean offered, waving his spatula around in a way that came dangerously close to getting beef juice on someone’s clothes—but never did. “At least, I’m

anything to him yet. Not even when he opened the door earlier. And now he’s just been staring like an idiot.
"And here I thought it was my perky nipples.” - Similar to what Dean told a demon in "Lazarus Rising" (4x01)
One of Dean’s hands leave Cas’s waist to scratch the back of his neck. “Uh…cherry, usually. But last month, I made this Whiskey Butterscotch Praline Cream pie and--”
Dean’s pink tongue comes out to wet his lips and Castiel watches, fascinated. This is a nervous gesture, is it not
“Cas is here!” he declared, going to sit on the couch by Sam and then realizing that he needed to open the door and springing back to his feet.
“This article also says that he doesn’t want one,” Castiel pointed out, ignoring his cousin’s last sentence as he continued to skim the text below the image.
don’t—I’m not sure anyone else’s opinion matters. I did always wonder though—why you didn’t remove yours. You were famous enough—you knew keeping it risked exposure… and since you were so against the idea of meeting me….”
Something about the conversation unsettled him for days afterward, but he couldn’t put his finger on what. It didn’t help that he’d barely talked to Dean since the night Marv first appeared. The actor had been gone when Cas woke up in the morning—before he could even tell him about the decision he made—and was at the studio for over 14 hours a day the rest of the week, meaning they’d really only shared a few texts.
that my son has been lying to me for months? Proud that, with all the opportunities he’s had put at his feet, that what he’s going to contribute to society is nothing more than an—an airplane read that someone’s going to forget about as soon as they land? Proud of that display out there—where instead of being a respected medical professional, he’s being walked over by a bunch of paparazzi who couldn’t seem to care less about his supposed accomplishments?”
“Should have just followed the path of swooning ladies. It’s like a breadcrumb trail leading right to me.”
“Well, come on, then,” Aaron said, leading them up to yet another door. “Your time starts once everyone is inside and I lock up behind you. Good luck! Especially you,” Aaron added to Dean—who at least managed to roll his eyes this time.
“Oh, uh, we were just trying to figure this out,” Dean said, gesturing at the stuff on the table. Cas had picked up one of the stones and was carefully examining its markings. He picked up another to compare.
we’ve covered some topics it took me a couple extra months to discuss with previous girlfriends. But, honestly, that still feels more about
Just then, Dean’s head whipped around. “Fuck,” he declared, and Castiel scanned the street, alarmed.
“Wanna help me cook?” he asks as they arrive at the kitchen and he starts poking at the ground beef. Cas isn’t allowed to get anywhere near the stove, but he’d kick Bobby Flay’s ass at anything to do with a knife, that’s for sure. Castiel nods, already dressed down in just his shirt and dress pants, but now he pushes his sleeves up too.
Dean was being suspiciously quiet, and Castiel could feel his eyes narrow dangerously. “You know that, right?”
feel half the things you feel due to this stupid soulmark—and I have no idea whether you’re fuckin’ with me right now or not,” the actor almost whined.
“He’s my family too,” he announced, unaware until this moment that that was how he felt but acknowledging the truth of it regardless. “And I protect my family. I don’t hurt them.”
person I was just making out with to crawl into my bed…. Just…get in here,” he says, holding up the covers.

“You know what would be distracting? The paparazzi pressing their faces against the window, trying to turn this into some threesome shit,” Dean retorted, crossing his arms over his chest.
She’d thought—well, what any normal person would think—and didn’t pry. And Dean didn’t offer any insight. Even when he brought himself to talk about Sam, he had never mentioned this best friend again. All that time she’d spent trying to help fill the hole inside him and she didn’t even know about all the pieces that were missing.
weird that you expect to know all of Cas’s big secrets already? You’ve only been friends for—what? Three months now?”
There’s something going on with those two—but, like usual, they don’t really keep me in the loop. They’re not secretly fighting (It’s not as if Cas is an expansive talker, but it’s amazing how much louder his not-talking becomes when he and Dean are on the outs. Plus, Dean hasn’t been hitting the bottle any harder than usual lately).
He reaches for it, cautiously, halfway wondering if Dean put a spell on it or something. Maybe, it’s going to make all his hair fall off or make him speak backward for the rest of the week. But when he touches it, it still just seems like a book.
Just a few months ago, an influencer had snuck a baby tiger into her room—where it had quickly claimed the four-poster bed as its new scratching post. Last year, Vince Vincente
Castiel feels…amused? Possibly. But the emotion is buried so far down—under layers and layers of strategy and languages and his intimate awareness of the time and his vessel’s body temperature—as to be almost unnoticeable.
“Can I inquire what you’re making?” Cas asked, having come over to Dean’s side. Bent in half the way Dean was, this meant his gaze was pretty much lined up with Cas’s crotch—and the actor barely avoided hitting his head again while attempting to stand.
I open my mouth to say—something—when a coffee is set in front of me, another in front of Bobby, and a third at Dean’s empty seat. I pick it up and sip from it automatically—only realizing after the first taste that we never told the angel our order, but he seems to have known it anyway.
“This is entirely unnecessary,” Castiel protests, shoes leaving skid marks on the floor, but the redhead is determined.
“S’possible,” Dean acknowledged, almost humming—and Castiel thought that they’d fall asleep like that—half-hugging, legs tangled. It would probably be the nicest way of falling to sleep he’d ever experienced.
“Yes,” Cas responded instantly. “Because you are far more intelligent than you give yourself credit for.”

Once Dean finally calms down, they try to get through the next set of questions quickly. “How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?”
Castiel sat on top of the closed toilet lid, scrolling through his phone. The photo he was looking for was several years old, but—at last, he found it—the selfie he’d taken of his soulmark back when he’d first learned the truth. Staying away had seemed so
He smiles a little. “You know, right before he showed up in Bobby’s kitchen, he and this other angel named Uriel fought a volcano spirit that almost destroyed an ancient church. It was pretty badass.”
Cas made sure to keep his face as neutral as possible, even as he felt his heart speed up pleasantly. “Well, I
“Dude,” Dean says, raising his arm to put a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “I’ve been raised to fight the things that go bump in the night since I was
Meanwhile, Gabriel set the laptop back on the coffee table so he could pull the bowl of popcorn into his lap instead. “
“Congratulations to you as well,” he smiled despite feeling the heavy weight of his mother’s gaze. “When’s your first day at Google?”
The car suddenly swerves—sending the can of beer Castiel had relegated to the seat beside him hurtling into the door.
“You’re not still thinking about Brad, are you?” Alyssa chides, touching her on the shoulder with red-stained nails. “You can’t keep living in the past, you know.”
“You’re dead on your feet and reading everything over three times because you’re not processing any of the information. Trust me, I can do this part,” Charlie insists, and this time, she’s definitely not playing a game with him.
Afterward, Hannah asked if he felt like going out for coffee and maybe to do some book browsing—which he found to be an easy “yes.” Hannah, he thought, was a lot like him—a little stiff, a little too likely to use the correct word for something instead of the slang—so he could only assume they had other things in common, too, once they got to know each other better. Of course, a bookstore wasn’t really a good place to talk to Castiel; he lost track of her pretty much as soon as he spotted the art history section.
He was still going by the time the waitress returned with his order, apparently oblivious to the way the lettuce next to the wings was steaming slightly.
But suddenly, oxygen comes flooding back, burning its way down my throat like something a hella a lot stronger.
overlook something important, I could actually call them out for it and maybe they’d help me see things a new way too and—” Dean feels his face burn underneath his freckles. “God, I sound like such a chick right now.”
Castiel, red pen in hand, soon lost himself in reworking Evelyn’s monologue into something that would match a thick Scottish brogue.
“Dean?” Cas asked, honestly concerned for the second time that night. And then, to his surprise, Dean turned his head to the side—away from him—blinking rapidly. “Dean?” he prodded again.
baby. And…when it comes down to it, Cas is Dean’s too. Their relationship is not for Sam to meddle with.
He smiles and places his order with the pretty bartender, smirking at the way that she obviously checks him out, but not returning it.
Cas does seem to take comfort from Jack’s presence even if he hasn’t exactly forgiven Dean for bringing him. He relaxes even more when the boy goes to sleep against his side and he can ask the questions he’s apparently been dying to. Dean tells him about his mom, about finding out about his connection to Cas, and about Brady (leaving aside anything about his dad, for now). His soulmate listens intensely, the way he imagines a general would listen to a report from the battlefield.
Mini Me frowns, drawing lines on his face that will become permanently etched on my forehead and I wish I could tell him to stop it. “It’s not like we haven’t been in threesomes before,” he points out. “Or that fivesome with Lee.”
“What do you value most in a friendship?” Cas’s voice startles Dean out of the moment they’d been having.
“I feel like I should hate seeing that on you,” Dean stated—almost groaned. “I mean I’ve always said these frickin’ marks don’t mean anything, except maybe representing a rule to be broken… But, uh, is it weird that I kind of like it?” Dean licked his lips. “
“No…?” Dean was clearly guessing. “I mean, it would be cool seeing you around more, but you could work remote, too. I know Dorothy’s got her park ranger stuff.”
“Yeah, this whole case is kinda fuzzy,” I admit. “ I remember being covered in Dead Man’s blood because, gross, and Sam using his powers again, but…” My tongue scrapes across the bottom edge of my teeth. “I think what I remember most is talking to you in that park—thinking you might…might actually be on my side.”
Surprisingly, Cas starts shaking his head no. “You don’t have to. I have been able to glean a reasonable amount of information about your childhood—and while there are many things

“Eh, I’ll make it up to you,” Dean says, breaking eye contact, but smirking down at his phone all the same.
“So, hey,” Dean said, breaking through the chorus, his tone of voice so different from a few moments ago that Castiel’s curiosity instantly piqued. “Maybe you got other plans, but I know a place around here that—”
He shook his head at himself. “There’s not really any point in lingering on it, though. Dean’s making as much time for me as he can with how much else he has going on. So, it’s definitely not anything to threaten him over—or even bring up to him… Do you understand me, Gabriel?”
“There was a time not too long ago when most hunters believed demons didn’t exist either, but now they’re popping up faster than McDonalds. And there’s just as much lore about angels as there is about demons. The point is I don’t think we’re in a position to say anything isn’t
“It feels weird flirting now that—you know….” his brother mutters, fingers tight against the steering wheel.
“Uh…” Well, it’s not like he can really deny it. “Can we maybe not do this here…?” Students for the next class are starting to filter in and between their presence—and the guy’s stare—he’s starting to feel a little claustrophobic. Hot Guy nods, gathering his own belongings, so they can walk out together.
“I would hope not,” Cas agreed. “But I do want a better relationship with her—and I think that might start by… trying to see past some of her idiosyncrasies.”
a little more than usual, even though there’s no reason to be avoiding Cas. I just…want to figure out what the heck actually went down before I talk to him.
“Yes,” Dean says, barely sparing me a glance. “And take it from experience, don’t mess with the nerdy angels. Right, Cas?”
"Maybe you could tell her that third wheels offer extra grip and greater stability." - Reference to Cas statement from "Hunteri Heroici" (8x8)
“Maybe for a half a second, sometimes,” Dean responded—his fingers never halting in their soothing route. “But then I think about what you said—and Sam said—and pretty much everyone who’s ever met me said—which is that I’m a dumbass who woulda locked you out the second we met if I knew. And… they’re right. I
“Hold on,” Dean requested, holding up a finger—before standing up and grabbing something from a nearby bookshelf.
. Most of it is scenes from the show that Sam literally could not be there for, but I assume that there was an equivalent number of moments that he was there for--playing the awkward third wheel.
“Yeah, right,” Dean muttered. But at least it was proof that he was having this conversation with Castiel, not just himself. The author had wondered….
Sam’s worry subtly shifts directions at that. But before he can say anything else, Dean smells something that reminds him of walking behind Lisa through the JC Penney’s at the mall.
“Then he wouldn’t have been happy with a dog,” Dean argued back. “He wouldn’t’ve been fine hanging out with you like he just was.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, so he jokes, reflexively. “Well, Gabriel killed me over a hundred times once. Maybe you two should have started a club.”
quite good at insulting people. I suppose you could borrow a few of his one-liners if necessary. ‘Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage’ or ‘I do desire that we be better strangers.’” The author paused. “There’s also the very famous line, ‘What an ass!’”
“Suit yourself,” Gabriel answered brightly, over the background noise of a toilet flushing. “I have my ways.”
When the actor finally sank back onto the couch, boxes in hand, Castiel couldn’t help but point out, “She’s just going to keep the receipt because it has your autograph on it.”
I'm also planning on getting 2016's Dean more directly involved with these little memory sessions in the near future, even though I already hate the idea of having to juggle up to three characters named 'Dean' at a time. Would you like Sam and Bobby to be involved or would you prefer just the two-person love triangle?
Charlie crossed her arms over her chest. “I do have a life, you know. And you don’t pay me enough for this to be my full-time job,” she pointed out.
He chuckled. “There’s a chance I still have hearing loss from that night, but it was worth it. And it got me thinking—maybe we should do something like that again? With Ben?”
Dean let out a low sound, almost a whimper from the back of his throat, his grip on the doorframe very tight. “Are you—” he cleared his throat, “—seriously trying to have a conversation right now?” he croaked, eyes wide and unfairly green considering the shadowy light.
No doubt, I love those boys like my own—but distance makes the heart grow fonder and all that crap. Plus, it’s nice to be able to set down my book of angel lore without having someone move the damn thing in the five minutes it takes me to get a beer.
his entire web presence disappeared overnight. No one could place online orders, or call him, or even find his store address—and I guess, he just… went out of business,” she said, shrugging her shoulders, innocently.
Somehow, the glare Lisa sent Benny was nearly as strong as the one Cas could feel burning out of his own expression.
“No,” Dean said with the petulance of a ten-year-old. “Ten more minutes.” He reached out for Cas—tugging him more firmly against his side. Their slightly sweaty bare thighs pressed together—the contact comforting rather than provocative at the moment.
And yet, when he glances over during the first car chase scene, it is to see Dean’s arm back around Cas’s shoulder.
“I’m getting the balsamic chicken. What about you?” Lisa asked from his other side after a few minutes.
“Yeah, I know you don’t. Just, uh, come here, maybe, and give me a minute?” Dean requested, laying backward. Cas arranged himself beside him but stayed propped up on one elbow looking down.
“Uh, guys?” Charlie called from Cas’s computer screen. “Bigger fish to fry. And serve with a side of chips in true British fashion,” she reminded them.
For someone who had been told, repeatedly, that he had a tendency to wear too many layers or bulky clothes that didn’t fit him particularly well, it was a strange concept.
The left corner of the angel’s mouth twitches in amusement despite his obvious attempts to fight it, making Dean feel a little smug.
Crowley leaves, Bobby grabbing Sam immediately while my other self says something about calling a few other hunters—see if they’ve been approached by the British Men of Letters too.
“I’ve realized,” Castiel said, drily. Not to mention, it smelled like a gym locker room. “I’ll probably start looking for cars this week.”
“This might take a while,” the driver announced. “More traffic than usual today.” Castiel nodded absently.
Castiel’s chest burned again, except he had a better idea what it was about this time and tried not to copy the movement of Dean’s own hand as he rubbed at his shirt over the area of his heart.
It could also be brought closer. He and his mom were trying to work towards a closer relationship—and this would upset her if she found out. And he was happy with his life now. Any answer that Charlie could potentially disrupt that—and for what?”
“I’m fairly confident that it’s a man. Caucasian.” His eyes meet Dean’s briefly before he reaches for his water bottle. “Someone with freckles.”
“Don’t worry about it, Cas,” I say, quickly. “I mean, Henry’s time travel spell should be around the bunker somewhere. We’ll work it out.”
I’m feeling anxious to see it—and not all in a good way. My doppelganger pulls out his phone—a device that’s bigger than his palm with no visible buttons on it and if this is all an elaborate hallucination, I’ve got to give the demon or monster in charge of it props for the details. When he puts it away again, his shoulders are slightly tenser. I’m guessing he’s concerned that Sam still hasn’t returned his call. At least, we’ve got that in common.
“We should pick up some lozenges for your throat,” I tell him. We wouldn’t need to if he just let me heal him when he gets sick, but when I offer, he only grumbles that I’ll ruin his immune system and I should save my grace for something important. Which is ridiculous for multiple reasons, not the least of which is he has asked me to use my grace to reheat coffee on a stakeout before.
acknowledging Dean’s and Cas’s whole—thing—which the three of them had lived with in silence for so long now that it practically had its own room at the bunker.
It was hot, too, and he stumbled for the sink—only to realize he didn’t know where his glasses were—before just tilting his head and letting the water run into his open mouth.
Suddenly, there are hands on both of his shoulder blades. Caught off guard, Cas finds himself hurtling forward toward the actor as he hears Anna give an innocent-sounding, “Whoops!”
“I mean… maybe. Every once in a while,” Dean answered, uncomfortably. “But that’d be such a waste of my pretty face,” he joked.
Even through the fog of his other emotions, Castiel felt warm at the thought that the bond between him and Dean was something special—profound—despite all of his failed attempts to distance himself. And that was wrong on so many levels. Dean—he had a family—one he
“We won’t,” Sam insists. “And, if you really don’t mind, I might come back a little later than everyone else. I have this—uh—well, a friend asked me to stop by if I was in her area…”
“Just your Cosmo quiz shit,” Dean admits, breathing hot steam out of his mouth like a dragon as he does so. “Haven’t had time to do your assigned reading yet, in case that’s what you were fetching for.”
is my favorite book, so did I really forget to give it back? Or did I subconsciously want to keep it?
He turns to the box with more hesitancy than before, wondering if he should do the smart thing and get someone to X-ray or dog-sniff it first or if he’s going to be reckless.
in the picture,” she said, waving her fork around. “I meant… being friends first. You got comfortable with each other. You got to enjoy the early-relationship butterflies without having to worry that you couldn’t talk about the big things. You push each other—in a good way. You get Dean to open up—I saw that at the interview. And even if I was kind of pissed at the time, I was also impressed because I recognize what an impossible task that is.”
Cas squinted at him, but considering Dean’s and Sam’s usual nicknames for each other, he chose not to take that last part at face value. “Tell me what you’re thinking then,” he requested again. “I know the press is… persistent and opinionated. But is that all that’s bothering you or…?” He didn’t finish the sentence. Part of being a writer involved imagining way too many possibilities for every scenario. Was Dean having regrets already?
It really must have been a while since he’d talked to Cas—because that made absolutely no sense to Dean. But whatever—the important thing was that they were here and now, and they’d figure shit out.
belong to this world—even if he pretended that he did. If Cas was trapped behind one-way glass, Dean was the kind of person who made faces at the mirror from the interrogation room, knowing that Cas was on the other side.
The group back at the restaurant was probably confused by his sudden mood swing. He told stories, cracked jokes, and laughed at everyone else’s. When the topic of poker came up, he proposed they play a few rounds when they got back to his place—ignoring Lisa’s quiet seething beside him.
Since he was already at his computer, Castiel looked up the statistics Gabriel was saying as he mentioned them and was horrified to discover they were true. “Why on earth do you know all that?”
Castiel glances from him to me and then with a slightly apologetic grimace, mutters. “I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.” Next to me, Bobby tries to swallow a laugh and chokes.
Everyone else that had been scrambling around for clues turned to look at him just as a secret drawer slid out from each column. “Way to go, Dude!” Charlie shrieked, running over to examine the contents of the one closest to her. Eventually, they came up with a haul that included several different kinds of keys and a CD.
Having made the decision to look into his father, Cas halfway expected to wake up the next morning to find that Charlie already had all the answers. Instead, she sent him a “You have my bow” gif of Legolas and a promise she’d keep him updated. It made sense, he supposed, that her near-omniscience in today’s technology-run society was less powerful when digging through the much less computerized 1990s, but that didn’t quite fix the low-level anxiety running through him.
Unfortunately, Cas couldn’t fault his logic there. Still, he found it hard to focus on his own task—which involved combing through his emails and other correspondence with Crowley for anything potentially useful. The hand-shaped icon indicating where his mouse was on the screen almost looked like it was giving him the middle finger.
“He doesn’t,” Gabriel says. “She’s part of the reason why. 26 years old, the kid still hadn’t popped his cherry yet, so I, as any good brother should, suggested he find a partner and at least try out the horizontal tango. Of course, it would just be Cassie’s luck to pick the craziest chick at the bar. Well…I suppose she picked him.”
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. “I presume you’re referring to Benny,” he said—and then, before the matter could even get more out of his control, he added, “That’s—not the problem.” He hoped. “It’s…” He struggled for how to phrase it. “I’m not even sure if there
The commotion, of course, got the owner’s attention—and even though the balding man wrung his apron with probably more nervousness than the girls, Dean got the gist of what he was saying and agreed to have his photo taken to go up on the wall. Somehow, Cas had wound up included too—shyly looking at the camera, sitting in front of his plate of wings.
Dean doesn’t think about it much, but he knows it’s not exactly a coincidence that his only kinda serious relationships have happened when Sam hasn’t been around. There’s an expectation there that the person you’re dating is supposed to be the most important person in your life—or at least that, if things go well, they will someday be. But Dean isn’t built like that; he wasn’t raised like that—to be both brother and boyfriend, because when push comes to shove, he’s always gonna choose the first one.
” Dean protests, stumbling in the direction his brother is pushing him. Another left turn brings them to the same hallway as their bedrooms, but the youngest Winchester seems to have an even more specific destination in mind, as he manhandles him towards Cas’s door.
Panting, Lisa rolled back over to the other side of the bed, dragging some of the blankets with her to wrap around her body like a toga.
Cas opens his mouth to reply, but then our waitress stops by to top off our waters. Young Dean gives her an appraising once-over, followed by a flirty wink.
—but… if I’m going to do this part justice, I do have a couple of questions I want to ask you. So… do you think we can pick a time to get a beer or something? We won’t invite him,” he tilted his head in Balthazar’s direction, “if that helps.” His body language was open, expression genuine.
Castiel afforded himself the luxury of watching the actor again since it seemed Dean was lost somewhere in his own head. Late afternoon sunlight outlined the profile of one cheek and left the rest in shadow. “If that was
Not because she wasn’t wonderful. (She was.) And not because she didn’t love Dean (How could she not?) But because—
“The falling star. It was his soulmark—like I always said. One of my contacts ran into a girl with the same one by the name of Eve. She worked the maternity floor of a hospital out in Missouri. So, I paid her a visit.”
“How else am I supposed to put it?” Castiel questions, eyes sliding from one person to the other. Anna bites her lip, looking like she may have shared the same thought as Aaron. However, the rest seem to be on Cas’s side.
"Loading his plate with a few more of the mini Philly cheesesteak sandwiches that the crew had put out." - Reference to the sandwiches Dean kept on eating on the film set in "Hollywood Babylon" (2x18)
But with so much coverage, Castiel figured it was only a matter of time before his mother saw the news, and then who knew what kind of chaos she’d raise? Luckily, his general lack of pop culture knowledge was genetically inherited, and Naomi Novak remained unaware.
Castiel could write from LA as well as anywhere else—so here he was, in a 1000 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment that cost over $3,000 a month.
He expected her to bring up Dean—not only because he was undoubtedly the source of the ‘Cas is the worst cook ever’ stories, but also because every time they talked, Dean was in the room—or the conversation just naturally turned to him. Even the times they forcibly tried to avoid the subject, Dean was still there: a thought at the back of their minds—a word hidden in the hollow of their cheeks.
. I know you care about me—and that you like hanging out…. It’s that other stuff I can’t wrap my head around. Part of me still wonders if I just ate something weird and I’m hallucinating all this.
“Hey, everybody!” Dean greeted, welcomed by the smiles and waves of a few people. Castiel was considering nodding—or something—in his direction when the actor stepped further into the room, leading someone by the hand. With gleaming dark hair and bright, dark eyes, Castiel had always thought that she looked like a shinier version of the girl next door. “I think most of you know Lisa.”
He did so. Just as he followed all her other instructions. All the while doubting that, even with narrowed down parameters, he’d be able to single out the person who—
Dean’s pretty sure “someone” is pretty and dark-haired and is as quick with her comebacks as she is with a gun, so he shouts, “Say ‘hi’ to Eileen for me,” over his shoulder, as Cas catches up to him. It feels good to be off his ass, to stretch his legs out. When he’s in his Dead Guy robe, he wanders around the bunker slowly, savoring the idea of home the way he does the first sip of morning coffee. But right now, he moves like a man with a mission—and the angel matches him stride for stride.
The entryway led to a living room and dining area. The dining room had a table large enough to fit everyone Dean would have wanted to invite to dinner, and — as he found with continued exploration — a kitchen large enough to accommodate cooking for the lot of them.
“Dean,” Cas tried again, stepping so close to Dean that he could feel the heat of his body. Or maybe it wasn’t body heat. There were no bodies here. Maybe it was something else, something distinctly Cas, that sank into Dean’s very soul. Something warm, something that felt like home.
He stepped further into the room, hearing Cas follow him until he was hovering in the doorway. Dean reached for the tape, turning it over in his hand before he offered it to Cas once more.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice was softer, and this time, he didn’t sound like he was trying to begin a sentence by saying Dean’s name. It was said more like a prayer, whispered and calm but devoted. “Look at me.”
“I heard you,” Cas said slowly. “What you thought. You don’t always have to pray exactly for angels to know when you want us to hear you. And I heard you.” Cas reached up slowly, as though Dean was a scared animal, to press a hand against the side of Dean’s face. Dean let out the breath he didn’t know he was holding. It took all his willpower not to lean into the touch. “I love you.” Dean’s heart stopped in his chest. “And a few days or years or an eternity won’t make me change my mind.
Dean was nodding before Cas ever finished speaking. He felt lips against his own again before Cas tugged his shirt away. What exactly did the tugging, ahead, a paw, maybe a wing, Dean didn’t know, but that only served to increase his arousal. He bucked up against Cas, feeling the angel fold himself more against Dean.
“Dean,” A voice said behind him. Dean’s whole body launched upward, propelled so quickly that if he were still alive, he would see spots at the edge of his vision.
“You didn’t even give me a chance, Cas.” Dean felt his voice drop at Cas’s name, said no louder than a whisper. “And then you left me. You chose to leave me.”
“Nah,” Dean answered, trying to shrug it off. “Not the first time it’s happened when I couldn’t handle it. No big deal. Don’t make yourself uncomfortable.” The words rushed out of Dean’s mouth as he shifted, trying to hide the erection he could feel building. He had already been attracted to Cas before, something he had known for a while, and this wasn’t the first time he’d had to fight off his arousal at the sight of Cas, but he wasn’t expecting it to come on so quickly at the sight of Cas’s true form.
“Dean,” Cas said again, stepping forward once, then twice when Dean didn’t retreat again. “I’m sorry.”
That seemed to be all it took for Cas to come undone, too, as soon he felt the angel above him shudder and shake before another hot release joined his on his stomach.
Dean snorted in response. He knew time didn’t matter, but it was certainly longer than a day. And yet, it was one day at the same time.
He didn’t know when he had come so close to his orgasm until he was suddenly on a familiar edge, his orgasm looming. Cas’s fingers tightened around his throat, and Dean could feel his own heart hammering under the angel’s touch.
The living room was simple enough, with a few chairs, a couch, a coffee table, and a TV. Under the TVs were enough movies to last Dean for an eternity, some of which weren’t technically cinema approved. He smiled to himself as he caught a glimpse of a cover he was all too familiar with before he moved through the house more.
It was still night when Dean was jolted from his sleep. He didn’t know what woke him, but for several moments as he tried to calm his pounding heart, he thought that everything that happened the day before was a dream.
“I loved you,” Dean whispered, forcing himself to say the words he could never make himself say when he was alive. “I
Then, he heard footsteps echo down the hall before his door swung open, revealing Cas. The angel had removed a few layers, changing out of the outfit Dean was so accustomed to seeing him in and instead was in a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, and a jacket. It was surprisingly reminiscent of Cas's time as a human that it took a few moments for Dean to remind himself that they were long past that.
“Do you like it?” Cas asked after a while, forcing Dean’s attention off the tape and back to the house.
Cas’s hand didn’t leave his throat as their lips crashed together again, both of them far hungrier in their kisses than they should be post-orgasm, but Dean couldn’t muster any emotion beyond satisfaction and love as he held the angel against him.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t there when you woke,” Cas said, entering the room more and shutting the door behind him. “My time on earth taught me a lot, including that suits are considered formal. I thought this,” He gestured down to his clothes. “Would be more fitting.”
Dean supposed he deserved it. Before he died, Cas told him so many things, things Dean had wanted to believe because it was Cas who said them. He wanted to be the person Cas saw him as, but he couldn’t help but think that the moment Cas was away from him, he realized who Dean really was.
What interested him most, however, was what he found next to the computer. It was a tape with “Dean’s top 13 Zepp Traxx” written on it.
Dean didn’t know how long it took him to find the home he had in Heaven. Cas admitted that he was the one who designed Dean’s — and Bobby’s and Sam’s and his parent’s — houses when he and Jack were putting Heaven back together. Upon driving up to the house, he could tell that someone who knew him made it.
Dean dropped his head, staring at the forest floor. He had been here before, in some afterlife, praying on the floor of a forest. Praying to Cas. His best friend.
Dean shook his head at first, but he relented when it became evident that Cas wasn’t going to give up until he told him what was wrong.
He couldn’t help the tears that were once again forming in his eyes, threatening to spill down his cheeks.
“Yeah,” Dean said, with more conviction this time. “You can put other clothes in there for yourself if you want.”
Suddenly, it was like Cas’s hands were everywhere. He could feel touches over his legs, his arms, his torso, his hips, his cock.
He felt Cas begin to kiss down his cheek, his neck, his chest. He couldn’t exactly tell what was kissing him, which part of Cas he was feeling, so instead of trying to figure it out, Dean tilted his head back and enjoyed.
He shouldn’t be surprised, he told himself. Given the chance, everyone would leave him. He clung tightly, hoping that maybe he could cling to happiness, but eventually, everyone left him.
Cas followed his lead, not doing anything other than mimic what Dean was doing, never touching more than Dean touched him.
Cas didn’t change his form as he kissed Dean again. Dean felt feathers brush over his chest and back while the massive angel above him shifted him. He wondered how high off the floor he was and just how much this would look wrong if someone else saw it. But it didn’t feel wrong. Not when Cas pressed against him, warm and gentle and so beautifully familiar.
Dean couldn’t force himself to move, to think. He could barely even breathe. He knew Cas was here; Bobby had told him as much. But not once had Dean seen him, even after trying to search the angel out for himself.
He thought he tried to grasp Cas more, to have something to wrap his arms and legs around, but he couldn’t even feel his own body. Just pleasure and Cas’s lips.
Dean shoved the heels of his hands into his eyes as though he could physically stop the tears that he felt beginning to prickle at his eyes.
“Cas,” He breathed, not even really knowing what he was going to say or why he said it in the first place. Maybe he said Cas’s name just to say it.
His gaze landed on the window, and he noticed that it was dark outside for the first time since he’d entered Heaven.
“Cas,” He breathed as the angel stretched above him, filling the whole room. He could swear the angel looked at him in return, though not all of Cas’s eyes were trained on Dean. He didn’t know if that was a good or bad thing. He couldn’t stop himself from reaching up, his fingers brushing over the muzzle of one of the heads, a lion’s head. “You’re beautiful.”
“I’m confused what you’re suddenly finding humor in,” Cas said, his voice rougher than usual as he shifted to look up at Dean slowly.
The touches continued, brushes of what felt like hands accompanied by feathers, maybe even fur, Dean couldn’t tell. He only knew that every nerve ending was a live wire and driven impossibly further as Cas continued to work him over so expertly. Or maybe he was just sensitive.
As the aftershocks of Dean’s orgasm cleared, he could see the room around him again, no longer lit or filled by Cas’s true form. He turned slightly, seeing ahead of dark hair on his chest and feeling Cas’s body against his own.
“Guess the one advantage of the other form is that you actually have lips.” Dean was going for humor, or maybe even teasing, as he spoke, but he couldn’t help but hear the slight pout in his voice. It was unusual for him, something he wouldn’t have ever embraced when alive as he stared at the angel above him.
Time didn’t matter in Heaven, so Dean didn’t know how long he waited or how long he searched as he explored his new environment for the one person he wanted to see to appear. Sometimes, he could swear he heard the flutter of wings, but every time he looked, there was no one there.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice echoed around him, sounding all at once like an entire chorus and yet something far more ethereal. “Are you afraid?”
The words came from nowhere, but he didn’t want to take them back once he said them. All he could think about was the angel above him and that same warmth he had felt before, except this time it was all-encompassing.
“I can’t,” Dean managed, his throat tight. He took a step back as Cas stepped forward. “I can’t hear it if you’re just going to leave again. I would have preferred you never come at all than leave again. But if that’s what you’re going to do, then just do it. Don’t tell me anything else that will-“ He cut himself off, looking away from the angel.
No monsters were lurking behind the door, thankfully, just an entryway with a couple of leather jackets and a flannel jacket already hanging on a coat rack. A few pairs of boots were stacked under them, and quickly, Dean kicked off his own shoes to rest beside them.
He didn’t talk much to Jimmy, though, once he found him. They exchanged a few niceties, and once it became evident that Jimmy was not the person Dean was looking for, their conversation fell off. Soon, Dean left the Novak’s house, still searching to no avail.
He had only met Jimmy once, and that was many lifetimes ago. Now, Jimmy seemed content in Heaven with his wife, the two of them waiting for their daughter to return. Dean also wondered when Claire would appear, but given how similar she was to Dean himself, he had a feeling she would give Death a run around or two. It would be a while before Claire Novak found herself in Heaven.
He saw, with no shortage of satisfaction, as the movement caught the angel off guard enough that his eyes flashed the same white-blue they did when Dean or anyone else would catch a glimpse of his true form.
“Please?” Dean asked. Please was a word he rarely used; he didn’t like feeling as though he was begging for something. But he was willing to use now if it would persuade Cas that his true form was something Dean wanted to see.
Dean nodded, surrendering again to the feeling of Cas’s lips as they roamed over his body. He reached again, finding more feathers to grip as he could swear a muzzle brushed against his hip. Some part of Dean couldn’t help but think that foreplay was easier with a partner who had better-defined features, but a much louder part of him was more aroused than he had ever been in his entire life.
For years, he had repressed part of himself, mostly at his father’s orders. He didn’t know if John ever knew that Dean liked men just as much as women, but his father was a “man’s man.” Like other men from his time, he had an internalized homophobia which he passed on to his children. For years, Dean had spent part of his life thinking he was disgusting, that there was something wrong with him. John had drilled into him the need to be the perfect soldier, to obey every order. While John never said outright that Dean shouldn’t take a man for a lover, it was implied enough that Dean knew it was an order.
— Very nice to meet you, Mattie, — Dean grinned, looking around the cozy room. — We've just passed the hairdresser shop “Mattie's…
— Dean, — Cas stopped him softly, — thank you. I've known you for years and I know what kind of person you are, — the angel continued, putting an arm around Dean's shoulders. — You often say things in a hurry that you regret later. I see it, and it often hurts. But if you do this for me as a care, I appreciate it. — The angel put his lips close to Dean's ear, and now the hunter could clearly hear himsmiling. — You're very good at being a bear and a grump.
— Oh, I see, to Indiana, then? — the younger hunter asked matter-of-factly. — We should be there by nightfall.
— Are you alright, Cas? Should we slow down? — the Winchester worried. The blush appeared on his freckled cheeks gave up his arousal.
— Dean! — Cas groaned in a strangled voice, arching his back, and several more loud moans escaped from his throat as the cum poured out of him in hot bursts into the Winchester's hot mouth. Dean prepared as best as he could for that ending, meeting every impulse and carefully swallowing the bittersweet liquid, smelling of the same elusive ozone freshness that was difficult to describe in human words. A few whitish drops were smeared on the surface of Cas' cock and on Dean's lips, and Dean carefully collected them with his tongue while Cas, gradually regaining his deep, breathing noisy, as if half asleep, gently stroked his freckled shoulder...
— But don't bother about it," the warlock added calmly. — We used Lucifer's feather for the spell — which is probably why this funny thing happened. Not because Lucifer is a fallen archangel and the progenitor of evil, which is a controversial point in itself. The feather was just very old, from the time even before it fell.
— Dean! — a mixture of regret and fear was the angel's eyes. — Dean, I can't. Thank you... for the present, — Castiel lowered his eyes to avoid seeing Dean's embarrassed face. — But... I should go. Sorry.
— Maybe... — Dean staggered to his feet, and his brother hastily took his arm. — Or, more likely, I screwed it up…
— No, not your phone, — Dean said, waving his hands in protest. — I haven't drunk enough to figure out how to use it!
— I'll explain, Cas. When you get back. You... You can save Sam now, can't you? Please help him. And forgive me…
And now this kiss had happened... What did it mean? That Cas had been right all these years, and that Dean, like himself, had not dared to open up, hiding behind the mask of a stern and impenetrable daredevil hunter who had no time for... "chick-flick moments"? Or was it just that Dean was under the influence of the side effect of the spell that had given Cas real wings again, as an angel should have? What if he was just intoxicated and not responsible for his actions? And when he comes to his usual state of mind, will he want to forget what he did? Or will he really forget it, and this moment will disappear from his memory, like after a huge binge?
— Good for you, sit down then, — Dean sat on the edge of the bed himself, half-turned, and the angel had no choice but to follow his example and sit down next to him. — So you said you met the Shadow in the Empty when...
His hand rested gently on Dean's bare shoulder, where Castiel's hand had once left the mark during Dean's rescue from the pit of Hell. The Winchester thought back for a moment to their crucial meeting. Suddenly his gaze fell on his own body, then on Cas', and Dean let out a surprised sigh.
With a disappointed grimace, Dean stared at his fist, which had failed him again in this ridiculous child's game. Sam didn't seem to think so, though, which was evident from the cunning smile on his face as he waved his open hand in front of his brother's face. Paper wins over rock. Who the hell thought up such nonsense?
— Exactly, — Dean felt less sleepy and rubbed his fingers over his eyes. — Well, okay! After all, it works! You're here... with me...
— Dean, you've had a heart to do it at last, — Sam whispered in his ear with a smile, understanding what had happened. — You're dumb truck! It was worth me getting into trouble for, wasn't it?
— Of course, I like it very much! But you don't need to give anything in return. That's what presents are — they are made selflessly, just so that the person who is given them feels good.
— Yeah, that's exactly what I thought, — Sam stepped closer and brushed the dust off his brother's shoulder. — You often get up early and go to the library looking fresh as a daisy. And crawl under tables. Though the latter happens not so rarely, — taking a step back, Sam gave him a critical look and added: — Now tell me what's really going on.
A familiar hand fell heavily on the angel's shoulder. Dean, coming up behind him, looked anxiously at his brother, who was about to open his eyes. His face, stained with soot, frowned painfully. Sam sighed noisily and instinctively covered his face with his hands, for the first thing he remembered when he came to himself was the roaring, devouring fire and the burning building falling on him. Staggering back, he looked around hastily, trying to shake off the already nonexistent flames.
Quickly scanning the further direction they were traveling with Dean with his angelic powers, Castiel found a single burning house a few miles to the west. Before the jump, he waved his wings once more, as if checking their reality, and with a confident nod to Dean, who was still sitting on the ground, he moved with lightning speed into the burning wooden building.
Before Dean could even reach out to stop the fleeing Cas, he was gone. Using for this purpose the very wings that he had just got back. Leaving behind a swarm of maple leaves flying into the air and a bewildered Winchester, who was dumbfounded, absolutely not understanding what had just happened. It was all so beautiful — Cas' wings, coming so close to him, that he could see, even vaguely, and that at first shy, but then such tender, pure and perfect a kiss. What happened?
— Sit down, Dean, — Ogden invited, — and be really careful with this plant. This is burning bush, one of the two ingredients of our spell that Mattie found.
Dean dropped his head to his chest and exhaled sharply, trying to accept the failure. Frustration and anger clenched tight in his chest, crushing the last remnants of hope, and he did not immediately notice that the willful sorceress was in no hurry to leave. He looked up as she finished her drink, holding her glass in one graceful hand and holding up the finger of her other hand, telling Dean not to interfere. Setting the glass on the counter, she picked up her purse, took out an expensive gilt pen and a small, elegant notebook, and wrote a few numbers.
Carefully rolling over, Dean turned the angel onto his back and landed on top of him between his thighs. Not denying himself the pleasure of enjoying the sight, he gazed rapturously at the beautiful, strong body shimmering like bronze, stretched out before him, waiting for even more pleasure. Leaning down to the well-defined collarbone of the angel, Dean touched it with several intoxicating kisses, moving lower, his lips snatching Cas' nipple, which immediately tightened under his wet tongue. It took the Winchester a moment to realize the way his lips curved in a smile at how easily and willingly the angel gave in to his caress. How could he evenhave doubted that Cas had been waiting for this hot touch for so long, yearning for the maximum possible intimacy that Dean himself had dreamed of during sleepless nights, thinking that these dreams would never come true?..
— It's mostly my dear wife's achievement, — Ogden said, smiling as Mrs. Green came up, and she laid a gentle hand on her husband's shoulder.
Castiel raised his azure eyes to the blue may sky of the same color, watching the snow-white clouds drift across it. They were as fluffy and light as the cotton candy he'd tasted on the Fourth of July last year, when he and the Winchesters had stopped by the amusement park on their way back from another hunt which was not too tiring. He had almost forgotten the question that Dean had asked, just enjoying the warm spring breeze and the company of his best friends, with whom he sat leaning against the water tank on the roof of the Men of Letters bunker and sipping beer from a steaming brown bottle — more for the company of the brothers, because to feel even a hint of intoxication, he would probably have to drink a small tank of that bitterish drink. Dean, who had by this time become quite cheerful, heartily put his hand on Cas' shoulder, bringing the angel back to reality.
— Dean, wait! — said his brother, who had just caught up with him. — Can you slow down for a minute?
Dean pondered for a moment, putting his arm around the angel's shoulders. He frowned, then squinted and bit his lip, silently calculating something in his mind. Castiel was about to say something when the hunter asked in a low his voice:
— We almost burned down the house last time, — said the warlock's voice from the side. Ogden shook a tiny, charred piece of paper off Dean's shoulder and continued as the hunter sat up, blinking, — practice makes perfect. And the side effect of this spell was funny.
— I got you, didn't I? — he heard the sleepy voice of the older Winchester again, a little muffled due to the fact that Dean nuzzled Cas' hair.
Unable to find the right words, as he often did when he needed to express his feelings, Dean paused and lowered his eyes, and then Castiel spoke:
— I'm very pop culture savvy, you know, though it's not my fault, — the angel commented, and decided to change the subject. — Are you and Sam all right? How was the hunt?
This crafty plan was not to become true, however, and it became clear to the older Winchester when his half-awakened hunter ear caught the sound of low voices in the kitchen below. Two soft male voices, Sam's and Ogden's, were quietly discussing something, but Dean couldn't make out the words, so curiosity made him shake off the remnants of his sleep, leave the guest bedroom, and walk down the wooden stairs, rubbing his face with his hands.
— Hmm... For once in a while, you're supporting what you consider an obvious gamble. I'm not dreaming, am I?—  he paused and changed his tone from derisive to serious. — Cas misses his wings so much... He's only mentioned it a couple of times, but I can see how much he misses them. If I had known earlier that kind of angels' magic was available to humans, I wouldn't have hesitated to return them to him much sooner. And ever since we met Lily, I couldn't get this idea out of my mind…
— Cas, — the Winchester said softly, and his warm breath touched the angel's moist lips lightly, as if still caressing them, — I thought... It seemed to me you were... that you were...
— Dean, are you all right? — the angel asked worriedly, but Dean didn't seem to hear, and Cas had to shake him out of his trance. — Dean!
—It's Gabriel's feather. A gift. He gave it to me before he disappeared after... after he killed Asmodeus. The only thing that reminds me of him after he died. — Dean was now looking at his younger brother, whose voice had faltered, but he quickly regained his composure. — Though memory is not a physical object, but something that remains in one's heart. — Sam closed the box and handed it to Dean. — This is a worthy use of such a gift, Gabriel would be happy.
The smell of the flowers was rather strange, not quite clear whether it was pleasant or repulsive, and Dean reached out to touch the weird petals inquisitively.
When he came to, he found himself sitting in the chair from which he had risen when they began to prepare the spell. Sam's worried face loomed in front of him, his brother looked into his eyes and shook him by the shoulder. The fog was gradually clearing before his eyes, and he could see Matariel standing next to him, holding an extinguished lamp.
— Dean, what about the Impala? — Sam suddenly asked with a slightly nervous grin, looking back at the gleaming body of the family car. — You didn't break it, did you? — with that, he got to his feet, dusted off his soot-covered clothes, and turned to the car.
— No, Sammy, you got it wrong. A feather is needed as an ingredient of the spell, and he agreed to help for free. Rather, they are two of them, and one of them is... mmm... not human.
— Wait, okay? — and Dean continued to kiss him again, not wanting to stop this overwhelming joy, as if they had suddenly found each other again, but in a different way, so close, so intimate and natural, as if it could not be otherwise…
— Now the spell itself, — he said, and took a folded piece of paper from his vest pocket. — Dean, you should write it in your blood.
— I'm betting on my own irresistibility and tenacity, it almost always works,— Dean said with a charming smile. — Bartender, please! — he held up two Victoria fingers to the long-haired bartender, and two more whiskies appeared in front of the strange couple.
Dean shrugged, as if he felt cold, though the room wasn't cold at all. Castiel looked at his face with concern and saw the pain that Dean was trying to mask, but the semblance of a smile that he was trying to hide his sadness with was only a nervous twitch of his lips. He couldn't help but remember with horror how, just like that, a couple of years ago, Cas wasn't breathing, his heart wasn't beating, and the charred traces of his burned wings were spread out on the dusty ground, and Dean was standing over his cooling dead body, helplessly looking up at the indifferent dark sky, as if it could give him back his angel…
— No, it's not, — Mattie said, softly looking at her husband again. — When the angels fell from heaven, Ogden found me in a field nearby. I was injured very badly in the fall, not to mention my wings — there was almost nothing left of them. I didn't even believe I was going to survive. My life almost faded when he appeared and saved me with his magic, giving me a part of his soul.
— We're going straight to Poland*, — Dean said with a sly smile, glancing sideways at Sam for his reaction.
— What are you talking about? — Sam frowned, not sure what was meant Dean,  who looked as if he was seriously boozed up. — Are you drunk? When did you manage?
Dean kissed him slowly, as if afraid to frighten or offend him, as a treasure, cherishing every millimeter that the angel came close to him, gently touching his thick, disheveled hair, inhaling the fresh, spicy smell of his skin, mixed with the smell of smoke, and enjoying the response of desire with which the angel's lips slid over his, making Dean forget himself in that sensual sweetness and leaving no doubt about the reciprocity. Dean pulled back slightly and closed his eyes, leaning his hot forehead against Cas', breaking the kiss to take a breath.
The last thing Castiel wanted right now was a reminder of the cosmic entity that wanted to have him, but Dean guessed right.
When it began to get dark, the Impala of the Winchesters was several miles from Poland, and Dean took out his phone to inform the mysterious warlock of his close arrival. After several beeps, which seemed longer to Dean than they really were in his excitement, a calm male voice pronounced:
— You're so worried about him, — Sam muttered, and got embarrassed by his own tone, — though I understand you. I'd worry too if I were you…
— As you can see, everything is fine. The witch was eliminated without much trouble — witch-killing bullets came in handy. Actually I had a real sweat to do it, but not more than usual. Though we had to split up, and Sam was unlucky, he got a false trail, boring. But he decided to check it out just in case, he is now examining the house where the witch lived. Maybe he will find something useful for our books and artifacts collection in the bunker. So I had to deal with the villain, who slowly took the vital energy from the inhabitants of the town, alone.
— This is just heavenly tasty! — Dean said, taking a second helping of the delicious lasagna. — Mattie, I didn't know angels could cook so well!
Turning sideways to Cas, Dean hunched his shoulders and buried his bare toes in the warm sand. Meeting the dawn on the tiny deserted island in the Pacific where Cas had taken them was not part of his plan, but he had to admit that it was beautiful. The sound of waves splashing against the gently sloping shore just a few meters from where they were, the clean white sand beach, the small palm grove behind them — such wild exotic beauty he had only seen on TV and on a computer monitor in rare moments of rest, only sometimes dreaming of visiting somewhere like this place.
— Dean! — the younger man's voice came from the phone, and it sounded strangely muffled. Sam coughed, and Dean's brows immediately furrowed in alarm. — I 'm trapped! The whole house is on fire, it spread just a couple of seconds after I entered. I'm cut off from the exit… A lot of smoke... I can't see much…
Consciousness left Dean insensibly, and when, seemingly after a moment, he opened his eyes, gradually catching the sensations in his waking body, partially stiff from sleeping in the chair, it was already dawn. The cold morning light fell in through the window through a pale, translucent curtain, and the bed where Sam had fallen asleep the night before was empty. The first thing that came to Dean's mind was the desire to occupy the vacant soft bed "before my brother comes back from... well, where they go in the early morning... maybe for a run, yeah…“
A light, almost weightless kiss which touched his lips made him open his eyes. Castiel's face was so close, his hands fondling Dean's strong shoulders. There was something in the expression of the angel's eyes that didn't match his words. This look was filled with infinite love, but there was something else in it. Doubt? Sadness?..
The fire was still burning, and Cas had to hurry if he wanted to save Sam. He was alive, the angel knew it, though the eyes of his vessel did not yet see it. Castiel raised his hands, quieting the raging fire that continued to consume the charred walls and spread like an eerie, humming carpet across the ceiling. Under the influence of angelic grace, the fire quickly weakened and soon lost its position. Only in some places there were the fading flames of what had once seemed invincible fire still dancing.
Confused Castiel, caught between two drunken Winchesters, like between Scylla and Charybdis, had no choice but to capitulate.
The angel moved fluently to within a few inches, and Dean's personal space quivered under his gentle pressure, not for the first time making the Winchester shudder slightly with pleasure.
— Dean... what are you doing? — the hunter heard a quiet question.Which might not have been a question in itself, but he didn't really want to go into the rhetorical details right at that moment.
— Yes, it's possible to say so, — Cas agreed gloomily. — There are very few Angels left, and Heaven are held, not even "on a wing and a prayer". It's terrible to imagine what might happen if their power runs out and Heaven just collapses. Billions of lost souls will be scattered across the Earth…
— You can tap mine, — Sam said, taking his phone and holding it out to Dean in front of the confused Cas.
— Oh, don't worry, Dean, — Matariel said, looking around for a place to sit next to her, and then, without thinking, settled into her husband's lap, while he put his arm around her slim waist. — I sensed who he was when I touched you to see if the spell would work in your case. I saw him deep in your heart. I'd known Castiel for a long time, though I'd only met him a couple of times. He was famous among all the angels — a brave commander of the garrison, a dashing and fearless warrior, at the very name of whom the demons of Hell, and, let's say, some angels, too, trembled with horror. I admired him from afar, like so many others, because I was not a warrior and could not even dream of being in his garrison. Only the best soldiers were taken there, and I... I was an angel of rain, and my life was going far from angelic battles. Only once did I manage to talk to him, when we accidentally met into each other on Earth. I was watching a tropical downpour somewhere in what is now India, and he came down while returning from one of his military campaigns. He was very tired and just silently admired my creation, and then came up to me and said that it was beautiful... He was looking at it for a long time, and I did not know what to say, because the words stuck in my throat... — with a sigh, Mattie stood up, clapped her hands, causing the hunters who listened to her attentively to flinch slightly, and continued in a businesslike tone: — So, anyway, it's a great honor for me to help Castiel, and I'm glad that I can do something for him. If everyone has finished their coffee, we can start, otherwise the smell of these flowers can give people a headache.
— Hey! Cas! — Dean couldn't help but smile, too. — I'm talking about serious things here, by the way! I would have smothered you with that pillow right now... if I hadn't been too lazy…
— Yes, how to say it… It's a little out of date, or the storage conditions weren't met, — Mattie recited proudly, which just exactly reminded Cas to the brothers.
— Sorry I was late, Dean. I'm not making excuses, but hitchhiking... as they say... totally sucks. I'm very glad you and Sam are okay.
A plump old lady with elaborately curled and arranged snow-white curls was walking slowly along the pavement of the quiet street. When she saw the Winchesters say good-bye to the Greens, she came up to the brothers and greeted them all, saying in a singing, friendly voice:
— Do you like it here? I was here recently and I wanted to give you something in return, Dean. Something that would make you happy. And I thought it might be a good idea to bring us here, because you said you'd never seen the ocean.
— Err... Nope! — came the reply, too quick and too hoarse for a man who was really awake. — Wait a minute...
— Thank you, Dean,  the angel said lightly. Turning to Dean, he snuggled close to him, wrapping both arms around him and throwing his thigh around Dean's waist. Dean moved even closer, and they would have spent a lot more time entwining their arms and legs like a pair of lovesick octopuses, but they quickly realized that wasn't enough. Castiel's hand slid smoothly over Dean's stomach, and his fingers rested on his still-erect cock, squeezing it in a soft ring.
This time Sam was rewarded with a heavy scowl from his brother and an oil-soaked rag unceremoniously handed to him, which hit him directly in the chest.
Cas, looking shocked, kept both arms around Dean after he managed to keep him from hitting his head on the steering wheel. Winchester's green eyes, wide with horror, seemed to be fixed on nothing, and his shoulders rose and fell frequently in time with his breathing.
— Dean, why don't you sit down and wait a few minutes, okay? I really want to help Cas to get his wings back, too, so just stop and breathe. I'll be right back.
— Oh, young men, I hope you've signed up for a haircut with our enchantress Mattie? Don't miss this chance! When she touches your hair, all the sores and bad thoughts immediately disappear, I tell you! It feels like heaven...
— I lied then, Cas, I lied! — Dean interrupted, grinning awkwardly and catching his hand. — My digestion is fine. I just...
— Dean, even if you kissed me under the influence of the magic side effect, — Cas began, his voice quivering with excitement, — I wouldn't have a right to be offended. After all, you gave me new wings — something I couldn't even dream of. So if you're sure you made a mistake and you feel nothing but shame, we'll forget it as a minor incident and never think about it again. Over time, the awkwardness will ease, and everything will be the same between us.
The older hunter's tired mind swirled lazily with the question of whether it was possible for a man to be romantically involved with an angel... Then the question flowed smoothly into the moment when he first saw Mattie and did not even allow the thought that “she may be an angel, because she is a wife of a man... well, a warlock, but still a man... so... why not... why…“
In the evening they were going to reach the small settlement in Western Indiana that could only be called a town by someone with a good imagination. The everlasting road, where the hunters used to spend most of their time, was sometimes exhausting, but it was something so familiar and even cozy that the brothers had long felt at home during their constant travels along the United States highways.
The lady turned to the men with a smile, and the pupils of her eyes shone with blue light, gradually becoming brighter.
Flipping the switch, Sam returned to the well-won bed and soon felt the encircling embrace of sleep. Not for long, though — Dean's whisper came from the armchair:
— Dean, where did Cas go? I couldn't get the Impala started, so I thought maybe he could take us straight to the bunker now that he had wings. Did he fly to practice?
— I hate washing dishes, — she said shortly. — Well, Dean, Sam, get some rest, and I need to find a couple of ingredients for the spell. We'll apply it tomorrow, as they say, with a fresh mind. But, Dean... I have to tell you something. If you really want to help your angel regain his wings, then you must have a really deep connection with him, or the spell won't work. Let me take a look…
Matariel took the branch of flowers from the vase, without fear of being burned, because it was not at all dangerous for her, broke it into pieces with a few movements, and threw it into another bowl, larger than the first, taken from a nearby cupboard. Shaking her fingers to free them from the poisonous oils of the bush, she stood next to her husband.
— Exactly! Sammy, you stole my line — that's me who wanted to ask that. Or do you want a surprise, Cas? That's more interesting, isn't it, Sam?
— Come on, Cas, that's not fair! Look, it's Sammy's birthday, and we're celebrating so well, everyone's in a festive mood... Right, Sammy?
Turning her back, the sorceress had already taken a couple of steps when the Winchester said softly:
To Dean's relief, Sam continued to stare out the window of the Impala at the endless fields of soybeans and corn.
And Cas felt Dean make another small movement toward Him. The soul of a man and the grace of an angel merged for a brief moment, as if a storm wave had thundered on a rocky shore in splatter and foam... and then separated again, rapidly receding from each other, falling into the darkness of the depths of their vessels.
— Well... — the Winchester, as usual, gave Cas a little nudge as a sign of encouragement, but remained leaning against his warm shoulder. Several minutes passed quietly, filled with an unspeakable sadness and disappointment that they both felt, not feeling brave enough to admit it to themselves or to each other.
— I wouldn't say that for sure! Remember, we've dealt with guys not much weaker than this one of yours? The Shadow, or whatever it is, — the Winchester objected, not without a certain amount of self-satisfaction. — You're still here, aren't you? Look, you're walking and talking, and also arguing — everything is as it should be. And it just can't help but please! Come here.
— Hey, whoa, Sammy, it's okay! Sam, look at me! — Dean grabbed his brother by the shoulders and turned him to look in his face. — Hey, we got you, Cas saved you!
— I'm looking for something that can't be seen without... — And he nodded at his goggles. His green eyes didn't blink as he stared at the puzzled Sam. — Sammy, I need an archangel's feather.
— Beautiful, — the angel's lips curved in a pensive smile. — That's just perfect, Dean. Everything will be fine.
Realizing that resistance was futile, Dean automatically, though perhaps as a hidden counterattack, picked up the coffee mug from the table, ignoring Sam's indignant look, quickly gulped half of it, and decided to show his cards.
— Not really, Dean. I wasn't joking, it just didn't work out. It was too late... He was dead before any of us could make the first move. In short — something like that, and it's probably enough.
— That's it, Sammy, — and the younger Winchester got a good slap on the shoulder. — watch and learn. I'm the repair shop, huh, — slumping heavily into the passenger seat, Dean added, — well, let's go, Schumacher. My hands are still shaking.
— You're very persuasive, — Ogden took his wife's hand affectionately and moved the lamp closer to Dean. — And this fire is taken from a rowan tree set on fire by a lightning.
— Mmm... Actually, no, but should I've? Okay, never mind. Is that why he left? What, he didn't like it?
— Yes, Dean, Sam is okay, — Castiel said, almost not lying. He had learned long ago that no matter how bad a lie is, sometimes it is appropriate and useful if you want to protect someone from unnecessary and unwanted experiences. Dean was so attached to his brother, and had cared for him so much all his life, that it would be cruel and inhumane to make him watch Sam suffer when it can be avoided. Just one light touch of the hand on the burned forehead, one breath of grace spreading over the mutilated body, and it healed the melted skin, the blinded eyes, the shattered bones were joined, the burned hair grew back…
— Look out, Dean! — Castiel exclaimed, having been listening anxiously to the brothers' conversation all that time.
— Yeah, yeah, — Sam smiled, his face unreadable, and said in a deep voice, imitating the angel: — Considering the huge difference in the life span of angels and humans, and given the many different systems of chronology, I would say that…
— Well, the idea should have matured! And it wasn't easy to find Lily, also without my nerdy brother suspecting anything, — Dean chuckled as Sam shook his head and rolled his eyes again. — And then, when Jack needed help, all we had to do was to complete the search officially, and you helped. Of course, I didn't really want to disturb her, especially after she brought the kid back to life. This cost her a lot of effort, and I tried not to be too bold, but waited for her to recover more or less. Cas is doing well without his wings... like a wheelchair user — one can live, and assure everyone that this is a full life. Just it's not full at all, especially when a person could walk, and then — bam! and he's already a cripple.
Sam frowned and let out a sharp breath that should have meant disapproval. Dean was silent, smiling slightly, so Sam was about to break the long silence that seemed to precede another argument between the brothers, which they were both used to.
Dean sat down on the old-fashioned embroidered sofa and took off his goggles again, wiping the sweat from his hot forehead. It was his turn to be puzzled. A few minutes later, Sam did return, carrying an oblong wooden box. It seemed to Dean he saw one in the bunker's storage room. Sam sat down next to him and warnedr:
Her entire slender body filled with light from within, illuminating the small living room, and the huge shadows of her stunning angel wings unfolded on the wall where Mattie stood with her back to it. The air around her vibrated with power. A newspaper flew off the coffee table with a rustle of its pages, dishes rattled in the kitchen cupboard, and Sam's hair fluttered up and down for a second like a lion's mane. The Winchesters squinted in the glare, fascinated by the magnificent sight. Matariel folded her wings behind her back and spread them out again, displaying their splendor, then the light that filled her faded together with the outline of her wings.
He was ranting, he knew, but the bevy of emotions he had tried so desperately to stave off since Cas was ripped away from him couldn’t be withheld anymore.
Cas, however, didn’t seem to believe him. He moved closer to the bed, sitting on the edge. He was so close to Dean that he could once again feel whatever it was that was radiating off of Cas himself.
“Thank you,” Cas answered, tucking the tape into one of the pockets of his trench coat. Not that it mattered here in Heaven. He supposed Cas could probably conjure a tape player or stereo or even turn it into something else he could use to listen to it. Dean smiled to himself, nonetheless, knowing that the angel had once again accepted the piece of Dean that he had offered him as he poured a bit of himself into the tape, knowing Cas would never understand exactly what came with the offering.
At first, Dean didn’t do anything, still staring somewhere far away from Cas and this moment. If he looked, it made it real. This would be real. He would have just told his best friend that he loved him. He would have admitted-
“Cas,” Dean breathed, frozen in place by the very sight of the angel. He was exactly as Dean remembered him, down to his chapped lips and the way his tie sat, permanently crooked on his chest. “You came.”
So, how would he ever explain to his family that he had fallen in love with an angel, an angel who, for all intents and purposes, had been in a man’s body through the course of the million lifetimes the two had known each other. While Dean knew that angels didn’t truly have genders, he had only ever known his angel as a man, and it was that version he had fallen in love with.
All of his earlier worries, his fears, the parts of him that told him he shouldn’t do this were gone, silent. He just wanted Cas, finally.
“Can you even sleep in Heaven?” Dean asked before he turned toward Cas again, remembering that he was talking to an angel. “Well, not
Cas reached forward, taking the tape in hand, their fingers brushing in the process. Dean swallowed thickly, blushing even though he chastised himself for it, as he pulled his hand away.
Cas searched his eyes in the darkness before nodding slightly. “Thank you, Dean.” He didn’t move away, though, or return to his previous spot. Instead, he cocked his head slightly, his gaze still intently focused on Dean.
Cas returned his gaze, looking at Dean with the same intensity he always did, but this time it made Dean’s heart backflip.
He bent, kissing Cas again and humming with satisfaction when he felt Cas’s hand once again wrap around his throat.
He kept looking, though, exploring Heaven to such an extent that he managed to find Ash and Pamela, both of whom were exactly as Dean remembered them. Both seemed happier with the new Heaven under Jack, though he couldn’t help but remember Pamela’s content the last time he saw her in Heaven.
Dean didn’t go far from the road before sinking onto his knees in the forest. He looked around him, hoping that the person he was looking for would just appear. That they
When they finally pulled apart, both of them were breathing heavily. Cas’s forehead rested against his, though he pulled his hand away from Dean’s throat to rest over his hammering heart. Dean was shaking as he pulled Cas flush against him, smearing their joint releases between them. But it was Heaven; the clean-up was probably easy enough. Not that he cared much.
He couldn’t help but think the reason the other hadn’t appeared was because he didn’t want to see Dean. And that hurt far too much to think about. So, Dean spent hours exploring his new surroundings, leaving no stone unturned. He followed the road, one similar to what he had followed before in Heaven, trying with no avail to find the one person he truly wanted to see it.
He chuckled to himself, looking elsewhere as though he could force his awkwardness away with a few sounds.
He was so warm, almost to the point of uncomfortable, but more than anything, he wanted to throw himself on whatever fire was setting him ablaze so.
Cas’s true form was pure light, the same blue-white color that lit up his eyes, yet somehow he was solid enough for Dean to touch and to feel pressing back up against him in return.
He suspected his mother and brother knew he wasn’t exactly the best at hiding it, even though he lied to himself every day for years, thinking that his angel never felt the same way.
Before he knew what was happening, he crashed onto the bed, his orgasm rocketing through him as the sudden feeling of a very corporeal, very human Cas pressed against him. His hand was still around Dean’s throat, and Dean pressed into the touch, wrapping his whole body around Cas in the aftershocks of his orgasm.
Dean stepped into the forest around the road. Heaven changed to fit the person; he knew that. So, it wasn’t surprising that the Heaven he encountered was a two-lane highway surrounded by forest. He wasn’t worried when it came to leaving Baby on the side of the road; no one would touch her. But he needed something. He needed something away.
He looped his limbs around Cas, holding the angel in place while Cas rested his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“Wouldn’t want-“ Dean repeated before cutting himself off. “Come on, man,” He huffed. “Wouldn’t want to see you? You tell me that you love me, you tell me all these things about myself that I’ve never heard before, tell me that you know how to love because of me, before getting swallowed by the Empty and saving me again and you think I don’t want to see you?” He threw his hands up in exasperation. “You didn’t even give me a chance to answer. And on top of it, you tell me when we’re about to die, knowing that it would mean I’d lose you.”
“It’s not like I’ve had much of an opportunity to show you anything,” Cas huffed, making Dean burst into another fit of laughter.
It started slowly, as though Cas was showing Dean a bit to test if he would change his mind. His eyes began to glow first, a familiar sight for Dean. Then the room started to light as Cas’s wings silhouetted against the ceiling above them. Then bit by bit, those wings seemed to become real. Except it wasn’t just one pair, it was several pairs of wings.
He heaved a sigh, trying to calm himself. This was Heaven. He wasn’t supposed to feel like this. He was supposed to be happy. His family was here; his friends were here. Everyone that had died for him and Sam over the years was here, safe. But not the one person he wanted. Not the person who had sacrificed himself over and over for Dean. Not the person who was dragged away from him in an attempt to save him from another evil. Not the person he wanted.
“You could just stick it in the closet,” Dean answered before he knew what he was saying. He paused for a moment to consider what he just said as Cas spoke.
It was odd, though, when he came across Jimmy Novak for the first time. At first glance, he thought he had found the person he was looking for, but it only took a few small gestures for Dean to realize who he had actually seen.
Cas’s form shifted again as the angel leaned toward him — was it really leaning when the angel was everywhere, Dean wondered — until the familiar feeling of lips pressed against Dean’s own lips.
The first person Dean met in Heaven was not the person he wanted to see. It was good to see Bobby again, especially after everything he had been through since his surrogate father died, but he wasn’t the person Dean hoped to encounter. The second person Dean encountered in Heaven wasn’t the person he had wanted to see either, though Sam was a welcome sight. For the first time in his life, the person he desperately wanted to see the most wasn’t someone blood-related. The person he wanted wasn’t even really a person at all, though he had become more human over the years.
Dean’s fingers twisted more in the feathers he had grasped, hearing what sounded like a moan echo around him. The moan was quickly followed by what sounded like a purr before a hand rested on Dean’s shoulder, right where the handprint used to be.
“This,” Dean began, poking at Cas’s shoulder. “This isn’t a body, is it? This is just how you appear to me.”
He leaned his head back against the pillow again, and after a moment, laughter bubbled through his chest. He couldn’t contain it, holding onto Cas tighter as he laughed into the darkness around them.
Cas truly was beautiful in ways that Dean couldn’t fully comprehend yet, but even still, seeing the angel above him, he fell a little bit more in love.
“Dean,” Cas moaned in return, and that was enough to send Dean over the edge. The echoing, ethereal, chorus-like voice of Cas’s true form managed to wiggle into places within him that had been dark and lonely for years.
Before he knew it, he was in his bed, seeing Cas sit at the window, staring outside and keeping watch over Dean all at once.
“Cas,” Dean began, sucking in a breath. It was the first time he’d said the angel’s name while in Heaven; the first time he’d even thought it. “I know you can hear me.” He looked around, hoping that maybe the few words were enough to drag Cas from wherever his feathered hide was hiding.
Something about the way Cas said his name, the tone, the emotion under it, had Dean lunging forward, capturing the angel’s lips. Cas was still for a moment under Dean’s sudden attack, but when it became evident that Dean wasn’t going to run away, he slowly began to move. Dean forced himself to stay as Cas returned the kiss, forcing down the parts of him that told him he was wrong in favor of pressing forward more.
He didn’t expect the moan when it came, nor did he expect to try to find some purchase to pull the angel closer. He ended up with a handful of feathers as he tugged Cas closer, feeling what almost felt like a paw move under him to hold him closer.
Only then, Cas finally moved, slowly reaching out to him to pull them closer together. The kiss built as Dean reached for Cas in return, finding that same familiar form under his hands. The moment he started touching was the moment his need turned into desperation. His touches changed from careful and exploring to demanding as he dragged Cas closer to him, the two of them toppling back onto Dean’s bed.
Days later, when he would finally be able to confront his parents, he did so with Cas at his side, knowing that he had his angel if anything happened.
— There are things that are difficult to control, even if you are a brave warrior. You're not a coward, Dean, — Castiel encouraged him, and wrapped a wing around the Winchester. His wings were already translucent to Dean, and his fingers passed through them as he tried to touch the feathers losing their density.
— Dammit, Sammy, you've ruined the joke, — Dean pouted, and slapped the steering wheel with annoyance. — I thought you were going to start wondering how we were going to get to Europe on Baby, and you... Oh, you're a spoilsport! A prize-winning downer!
— May I ask how you met? — Sam asked with a polite smile and nodded gratefully as the hostess added another spoonful of juicy salad to his plate. — If it's not a secret, of course.
— I like it here, too, Dean, — Castiel said, and saluted the younger Winchester with his bottle. — Happy birthday, Sam!
— I asked him not to tell, Dean. We've had so many tough events already. I just didn't want you and Sam to worry also about me.
— Damn no, — he ran his hand down his face and looked it. It was barely shaking anymore. — I mean, I really did... Come on, as if you weren't peeping!
When Castiel was fully aware of himself again, he realized that he and Dean were sitting on the ground opposite each other. Dean squeezed Cas' hand to his chest, eyes shut tight. The angel felt a strong heat and tingling in his back, which spread further back and up, over his shoulders and wings… The wings that had long since been burned to ashes, the pitiful remnants of which only served to remind him of how, a few years ago, through his own recklessness and trustfulness, he, like all other angels, had lost his wings, as well as the ability to move instantly through time and space. How many times had he cursed his own stupidity and worthlessness, imagining how he could solve so many important problems if he had wings…
— Well, - Dean continued his thought, - if we all like it, then we must celebrate your birthday, Cas! Or else such a great holiday is lost! Yeah, and you will get presents — isn't it a good thing? — the hunter asked.
— Dean, something seems to be wrong with you, — Castiel said worriedly. — How are you feeling? — he gently touched Dean's face with his hands and looked at it closely.
Sam didn't miss the way his brother lowered his eyes, delicately trying not to choke, and he slightly kicked Dean under the table.
Unable to find words to answer, Dean dropped his hands to his sides helplessly and stared at the floor. Indeed, Cas got him there — he really loved Jack as if he were his own son, although he had not immediately come to this when the nephilim appeared in their lives. Now this naive kid with Superman's powers was their family, and everyone of them was ready to sacrifice for his sake. Suddenly, a question that Dean had been thinking about for most of the time since he'd managed the spell that restored Castiel's wings interrupted his thoughts about Jack. A vague assumption started to become clearer.
— They didn't make you go back to Heaven? — Dean asked. — Angels aren't to gentle with the willful — they try their best to bring them to justice in all sorts of creepy ways.
— Wait, Sammy, don't interrupt. You can see not only hellish creatures that are invisible to the human eye, but... well, a knowledgeable person told me that you can see the wings of an angel through them. Not the true form — it burns out one's eyes, you know, but, as Cas said... another layer of reality where their wings exist... something like that.
— And you used another spell to hide yourself from possible searches, just in case, didn't you, darling? — the warlock chuckled.
— That's right, Dean, it's been a long time since the three of us had such a good rest. — Sam took a sip of beer from his bottle and pulled his jacket tighter around him. — It's just windy here, but I like it. And thank you for the great gift!
— Dean, look at me, — Castiel lifted Dean's pale face and gently touched his lips to his forehead. — I understand you, I will not leave you again, do you hear? I love you... always loved you, no matter what! Dean…
Castiel was restless, and it is absolutely literally. His new wings now allowed him to travel freely to any place on the planet, and he darted around the world in desperation, searching for a place that would help him calm down and compose his thoughts. The sands of Egypt, the ice of Antarctica, the Amazon jungle, then an uninhabited island in the Pacific ocean, and even the bottom of one of the cold Northern seas did not produce the desired effect. And in the end, the tired angel landed somewhere in the Sacramento mountains. Not far from Kansas, where the Winchesters' bunker was located, by the standards of the now-again winged sky warrior. Perhaps that was why Cas decided to stop here, on a high, rocky plateau, being in a state of confusion that was completely out of character for his fellow angels. The angels were not subject to the feelings and emotions that Castiel, who had once fallen for one of God's wonderful creatures, had taken over from people.
More out of fright than necessity, Castiel took a deep breath, his heart pounding again under Dean's hot palm.
— We've had two archangels in our hideout, — Dean commented enthusiastically, scanning the space available to the eye, pushing furniture aside and peering into less accessible corners along the way. — Why don't we start by looking here, because there's a good chance, — he grunted as he pushed back the sofa in the living room, — that there's something here, — and then he was on all fours checking the floor under the chair, — lying around…
— What are you trying to say? That I'm in love with Cas or something? — Dean exploded, his green eyes wide with indignation. — Well, you're out of your damn mind, you asshat!
Without waiting for his brother to finish his story, Dean threw his arms around both him and Cas, burying his face in their shoulders.
— I hope you won't have any problems with us. We promise to keep your secret, — Sam promised, and Mattie took a step toward the younger hunter and kissed him on the cheek, standing on tiptoe. Dean got her same kiss, too.
— I won't. But I can really do it for you if you want, — the angel promised quietly. His hand slowly slid off Dean's arm, and again silence fell upon the room again.
