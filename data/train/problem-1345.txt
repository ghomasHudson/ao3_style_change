"Oh shit." He facepalmed and went to the living room avoiding Sherlock as much as he can, but Sherlock never knew words decency and personal space and tried to touch him when he went through the kitchen, circling him like a predator. Not much of an omega then.  "Just don't! Alright, I will pack some stuff and go somewhere else until it's over. Hide in the room and don't let yourself be tempted by your biology. It's dangerous."
"A stabbed man drowned in a barrel full of acid was found under one bridge. He already sent us an address." John answered, planning how to make Sherlock speak about that weird situation.
Then he laid in it and fell asleep by mistake. The only thing missing in his nest was John but Sherlock had a plan!
"Into subspace, I noticed, pet, I'm not blind." John interrupted him. He entered 221 and smiled when Sherlock always followed him only half a step behind him like a lost puppy. He climbed the stairs and hung up his jacket. And Sherlock did the same, literally copying John. "Now, sweetheart, you're going to take a shower. Wash yourself EVERYWHERE thoroughly but remember you have only 15 minutes. You'll take my dressing gown, it's warmer than yours and your boxers, nothing else. Then we're going to eat and then we will talk about what will happen next, understood?"
"Alright, I'm gonna believe you!" He scented and mouthed his back. "Lay down and I'll good care of you, my lovely omega." But Sherlock was having none of it and pushed his ass high.
"I'm sure I never saw you beg this much but I like it," John smiled and opened the fly of his jeans and pulled out his cock from his boxers and stroked himself, watching Sherlock looking dumbstruck again. "I bet that my cock is all you can think of right now, am I right? That big brain of yours reduced to this, my cock filling you one way or another, making you whole." Sherlock nodded hard, John was worried he would harm himself. "Can you speak?" John giggled.
"Normal pain-pleasure, then praise kink, little humiliation with praise, overstimulation and... and..." Sherlock's breaths were shorter and his palm went to his crotch and pressed down.
Yes, a bit not good. We're still at the crime scene, twat," John smiled. "Wanna stick around or go home to Mind Palace, Sherlock?" He asked then hoping for the second option.
Even though Sherlock knew it was physically impossible to go any deeper inside John, his brain was at a point where logic was out the window. John wanted him to go deeper, so he was going to try. He pulled back and plunged forward a little more forcefully. But this time, John’s body also pushed boldly to meet his. Like continual waves hitting a coastline, surges of want and need crashed between them as beads of sweat, like raindrops, ran down their bodies.
Then, John felt Sherlock’s lips and tongue begin to lap up the salty streams of tears that were trickling down John’s face. He grasped Sherlock and clung to him as the detective continued to place soft kisses all over his cheeks and neck.
A final, primal shout of each other’s names accompanied the orgasmic crescendo. A stream of white, milky liquid flowed onto John’s stomach as Sherlock released a warm, twin stream inside him. More streams pumped forth as their bodies spasmed together and they simultaneously released their hands to hold each other through the aftershocks. For John there was a loss of consciousness, like being in a twilight state. For Sherlock, it was similar to a feeling he’d experienced previously, when the cocaine had kicked in. But this time there was an unexplainable joy and peace that surrounded it, which he found to be more addictive than any drug ever was.
“John,” Mycroft acknowledged blandly, brushing his suit jacket with his hands and attempting to remain dignified. “They’re both safe. Mary’s been taken somewhere where she can be questioned properly about her connection with Moriarty. And Sherlock, well, let’s just say he’s been taken somewhere where I can keep an eye on him for the moment.”
John pushed himself up to lean on his elbows. His demeanor had changed to one of uncertainty. “I was thinking …”
They were both exhausted from the waves they’d been riding the past 72 hours, each valley a hellish descent, each peak a hope-filled respite. Moriarty was finally dead, John’s divorce was final and Sherlock and John had reunited and declared their love for one another. It was truly time for at least a kip after all they’d experienced. But nothing, not even their bodies’ craving for sleep, could stop them from wanting to explore what came next in this emotionally and mentally euphoric state in which they found themselves.
Soon, Sherlock’s mind had returned to thinking about “important” things like experiments, and murders and the micro-organisms awaiting their turn under his microscope. However, a few minutes later as he slid the final glass plate under the lens, he couldn’t help his wandering mind as it noted how the cluster of cells he was viewing looked exactly like John’s hair when he wakes up in the morning.
He picked up the glasses and made his way to the sitting room where Sherlock was already perched in his chair, reading a book on apiaries. John handed him one of the glasses and took his own comfy seat as a fire popped in the grate nearby.
“I’ll wait for you outside,” Mycroft spoke to John over his shoulder as he strode out of the room. It was more of a command than a statement. John rose from his chair as did Mary and the two of them hugged each other one last time.
However, he knew if he didn’t attend the party, in his own flat, with his very merry flatmate, that John would be furious. But more than that, John would be disappointed. So, the detective did what he’d done numerous times in the past. He finished dressing, smoothed the lines of his shirt as he looked at himself in the mirror, and whispered, “Into battle.”
Sherlock remained still and silent. His head was now tilted toward the floor; his eyes darted back and forth. Even in the throes of despair, his mind feverishly tried to devise a plan.
Sherlock turned off his phone, tossed it onto his chair and grasped John’s waist to pull him closer. He then planted a soft kiss to his blogger’s forehead.
Two days passed and there wasn’t a peep from John about the banquet. Finally, Sherlock’s curiosity got the best of him.
John opened his mouth to try to speak but words failed him. Helplessly, he looked at his friend, who was staring back at him with wide, searching eyes. So, John did the only thing he could think to do. He stood up and hovered over the detective, slowly bringing his hand to brush Sherlock’s cheek. Then, he lowered his face within inches of his friend’s and whispered brokenly, “I’m so in love with you, Sherlock. I always have been and I always will be.”
So there he sat, tucked in his usual corner, books spread before him, typing away on his laptop and carefully turning pages, marking notes and savoring the ability to put his mind back on track. Only a handful of times did his mind wander, only slightly, to a certain muscular rugby player, and even then, something would catch his eye—a new fact online or a sentence in one of the books—and he would be back at it, following a lead.
“Ohhhh, I see then. So you don’t want John to know. Hmm. Perhap it involves him?” Mycroft continued haughtily, as if he had just discovered a treasure. “Keeping secrets, Sherlock? Tsk Tsk. I thought you two were past that.”
Sherlock then realized what happened and was determined to make John cry out that same way again. He thrust forward deeply, hitting the response-provoking organ, and held for a moment. A slew of words came tumbling from John’s mouth. “Ohhh, Christ, Sherlock … yes, more!”
… Sherlock’s inner dialogue continued as the cab crept along in rush hour traffic. It was the evening of the awards banquet at which John was being honored and Sherlock had been due to meet his flatmate at the hotel. The pair had agreed to meet up at the event at a designated time—John being required to attend the pre-banquet “meet-and-greet,” (of which Sherlock wanted no part of) and Sherlock being called in by Lestrade to consult on a burglary case-gone-awry, which registered as a five in Sherlock’s mind and wouldn’t take long. However, the case quickly escalated into an eight, and the detective found himself having to do a little extra leg-work at the crime scene, especially since his blogger hadn’t accompanied him. The fact that John wasn’t by his side had put Sherlock into a state of irritation right out of the gate, which culminated in an impressive display of extreme multi-tasking as he simultaneously rattled off deductions, insulted Lestrade and most of his team, texted John that he’d be “a bit” late and hailed a cab.
“Stop flailing and just reach up with your other hand!” a desperate plea from a familiar baritone came washing down upon his ears.
His chest heaved in pain and his breathing became more labored. He clutched John’s upper arms and choked on the words, as tears began streaming down his face. His body shook as his discourse continued and he looked with agony into John’s face.
Sherlock’s heart stuttered a beat as he realized the fourth person in the group was John, who had been obviously ambushed by the trio. His facial expression was caught somewhere between an embarrassing blush and an aching cringe, his usual self-confidence floundering, which in Sherlock’s mind was completely unacceptable. As the detective approached the group he could only decipher the tail end of what probably had been a trying conversation.
Sherlock’s brain felt like it just crashed into a brick wall. As if on autopilot, he interrupted, “After Magnusson. I was tested after the business with Magnusson.”
John turned to face him and replied, “I’m looking forward to it, mate.” Then, he turned and plopped down into his comfy chair.
Just a note: I don’t know the intricacies of the UK’s health system and the options for telehealth. For the sake of this drabble, John is working from home and providing online services to patients. Thanks and I hope you enjoy this little fic. :)
John’s wide-eyed stare searched his partner’s face waiting for some sort of reaction that he could live with. Suddenly, Sherlock, becoming aware that he was being watched, turned his face to look at John. What he saw in his partner’s eyes caused him to swallow hard. This man. This normally confident, courageous man was looking at Sherlock with eyes that conveyed self-consciousness and anxiety married with … worrying hope.
The warehouse was cold and damp and any natural light coming from the small windows near the ceiling lost its intensity by the time it reached the floor below. John was brusquely handled into an open space, his senses reduced because of the blindfold securely tied around his head. Luckily his arms were free, although his left one was in a massive grip no doubt by a large male. He knew he’d been taken somewhere near the river, for even though he had been stuffed inside a car boot, he’d learned from “experience” how to gauge and memorize directions when senses were hindered. Suddenly, an eerily familiar voice pierced the thick, pungent air around him.
It was John’s turn to blink a few times as he felt himself slipping into some sort of consulting detective TED talk. Leave it to Sherlock to provide a scientific explanation for an everyday observation.
John giggled as he lovingly looked at Sherlock, who hovered over him in puzzled wonder. John spoke, “Answer me this, my love. Have you or have you not researched what to do, how to do it, how to make your partner comfortable, how to make your partner scream in ecstasy, the perfect condoms to buy and how much lube to use?”
“As well as can be expected,” she replied. John frowned with concern and began to open his mouth to speak when she interjected, “No, John. It’s ok. I’ve had good accommodations. I’ve been treated well.” John’s brow unfurled and he settled back a little. Mary continued, “I told them what they needed to know. And that’s the end of it. Moriarty is dead. His minions are taken care of. He can’t hurt you, or me or anyone else, anymore.”
“Look, Sherlock, we can wait—” John started to pull away, but then stopped as he watched Sherlock do something he’d never seen the man do before when faced with a case.
Irene hummed appreciatively and Sherlock shot her a glare. Irene smirked, “Well, he certainly is dishy. I mean those eyes.”
“I was thinking we could either order from the Chinese place down the street,” said John in a slightly muffled voice behind the door. “Or, the pizza shop two blocks over. You pick. I—”
Sherlock was so wrapped up in his mind palace that he didn’t even hear John say “good-bye” and leave the flat.
Sherlock was caught in a rush of emotion. John knew and understood. John knew the pain and scars of Sherlock’s past—the teasing, the bullying, the abuse. He knew Sherlock’s nightmarish descent into and resurrection from the infernal pit of drug addiction. He knew the isolation of his childhood and the loneliness of his adulthood. He knew the mental and emotional scars Sherlock had suffered in the last few years. John knew and understood it all because John knew and understood Sherlock.
However, as sometimes happens, one epiphany opens the door for others. The enlightenment of Sherlock Holmes continued. …
John brought his own palm up to his mouth and placed a small kiss on his fingers. “This,” he said, as he reached around and touched his palm gently to the center of Sherlock’s back, “is for those scars.”
“Shhh! Keep your voice down,” she hissed. “I just wanted to give them an opportunity to chat a bit.”
John felt as if he’d been hit by a bus. Those were not the words that he thought would come out of Sherlock’s mouth. John knew that he loved Sherlock but he hadn’t known if Sherlock felt the same. In fact, he had thought at one point there was a chance that Sherlock, although capable of sentiment, might be incapable of feeling actual love. John mentally admonished himself as he replayed the words in his head. Sherlock,
Sherlock was so irate that in addition to unleashing a wrath of less-than-complimentary deductions on the doctor, he also deduced one nurse to tears and another to almost punch him, not to mention a very red-faced receptionist to flee down the hallway in extreme embarrassment. Sherlock then stewed in the back of a cab, huffed 17 steps up to his flat, made some sort of growling noise as John greeted him, slammed the door to the loo and proceeded to take a very long, very hot shower.
Eventually, their hands stilled and their hearts calmed in time with one another and a rhythmic, pulsing duet was established. As if on cue, they both opened their eyes. The depth of love and understanding that silently passed between them was captured in the deeply focused pools of blue that they both possessed. These shared moments were theirs and theirs alone now, and they both took time to savor every loving thought that passed unspoken between them.
Sherlock wasn’t prepared for that deduction and the type and amount of emotion that accompanied it. Suddenly, there needed to be space cleared in John’s room to store this information, but he couldn’t find any. Sherlock was holding onto something he knew was special, and at the same time frightening. He needed to put it down so he could look at it and study it … place it under a microscope … run it through several experiments and compare all the data.
Until now, Sherlock hadn’t really been aware of the after-effects of what he had to deal with, or rather, who he had to deal with, in order to get up the stairwell and onto the roof to save John. Taking a blow to the face and a few punches to the ribs were nothing to speak of in his estimation. The adrenaline had kept the tightness and pain from manifesting themselves. However, as John now reached out to gently touch his cheek, Sherlock flinched and became acutely aware of how much his face ached.
“By the way John, Detective Inspector Lestrade sends his thanks for your help on the Corrigan case. Another case closed, another life saved, thanks to Doctor Watson.” Sherlock waved his hand absentmindedly. “Now, if you gentlemen will excuse us, we need to check in at the registration table.” He began to turn away but then got that familiar look in his eye and turned back around to face the three doctors. “Oh, and by the way,” he started with the GP, “Your staff knows about your drug addiction,” then looked at the vascular surgeon, “Maybe if you stopped betting on the ponies you wouldn’t have to file for bankruptcy,” and finally Sherlock faced the neurosurgeon, “If I were you, I’d put her on a leash … since she has a tendency to wander.”
Sherlock took a large gulp of his whiskey and set it down on the floor near his chair. “Well, Rosie for one,” he answered. “She finds joy in little things that I didn’t even realize existed.”
It was strange, John mused as he finished washing the dinner dishes and placed them to dry on a small rack on the worktop.
John had grown sick of subtext and this time was determined to find out what Sherlock meant. He set his glass down on the side table and leaned forward in his chair, legs now brushing very near to his friend’s. He reached out his left arm and placed his hand, palm-side up, on his knee, very slowly, not at all in time with the rapidity of his present heart rate. He had a moment of panic when he thought he may have read the situation incorrectly. But that moment evaporated when all of a sudden, Sherlock’s right hand slipped tentatively on top of John’s, and at the touch, the two instinctively connected in a gentle grasp. They each stared at each other trying to take in this new situation, reveling in the warmth of the touch. John instinctively began rubbing his thumb over Sherlock’s hand and the younger man visibly relaxed as the corners of his mouth raised slightly. John wasn’t so subtle as a genuine grin appeared on his face. He reached out with his other hand and Sherlock quickly grabbed that one too.
Sherlock, while keeping his eyes on John’s face, raised his hand, and long, nimble fingers gently caressed John’s scar. “Thank you,” Sherlock said in a low, soft tone.
When he had returned after being gone for two years, Sherlock hadn’t been completely open with John about what happened to him during his time away and John didn’t press for information at the time. But in that moment, as John’s fingers popped open button after button down the front of Sherlock’s shirt, the detective knew that in mere seconds the consequences of those two years would be revealed in a very tragic way on the skin of his back. The front of the shirt opened like curtains on a stage and John pulled them back to take in the pale, expanse of flesh and muscles before him. He ran his hands softly over Sherlock’s chest and stomach, and stopped when he came to the healed bullet wound that Mary had left in her wake. John smoothed over it with his thumb and Sherlock momentarily lost his breath. John then finished off the final buttons, pushed the sleeves of Sherlock’s shirt down and away from his arms and pulled the younger man closer. He began running his hands all over Sherlock’s back as he kissed the detective’s soft, full lips.
this. He loved Sherlock so much, but suddenly telling Sherlock “I love you”againdidn’t seem like enough. He wanted to help Sherlock delete every cruelty that had ever caused him pain. He knew why Sherlock’s behavior was arrogant, distant and sometimes destructive. It wasn’t because he didn’t feel things. It’s because he felt things more intensely than others did … love, happiness, pain and rejection. Sherlock felt them all at the core of his being. Sherlock needed to know that John’s feelings went beyond love to respect and acceptance. He deserved to know that he was worthy of everything because he
Both men grappled and groped and finally freed each other of their remaining clothing. Mouths kissed and hands grabbed among intermittent grunts and gasps as their erections swelled between them. John, who realized at that rate they’d both be spent within a few minutes, reached down with his left hand and grasped both of their cocks.
Finally, Sherlock looked up and stared directly into John’s eyes. The determination the doctor saw there almost made him catch his breath.
In fact, John had never seen the detective so utterly disinterested in the criminal classes. He didn’t text Greg for cases. He didn’t even study any cold case files. And yet, conversely, he seemed absolutely engaged and fascinated with Rosie and her interests. Granted, John had to put an immediate halt to the Barbie-Ken-and-friends crime scene that Sherlock and Rosie had constructed one afternoon on the sitting room floor (“Looks like a jealous lover scenario, John.”), but other than that, Sherlock seemed … content?
Suddenly, the normal din of mid-day class change was interrupted by a sputtering sound coming from the narrow drive that snaked its way through the middle of campus. Traffic was usually non-existent because no one dared try to drive their way through, especially at this time of day. However, at that moment, one rusted, compact vehicle with a broken wing mirror and the rear bumper being held in place with some rope, coughed and choked its way slowly down the path.
The two men stared into one another’s red-rimmed eyes and what passed between them was deeper than any words that could have ever been spoken—forgiveness. Both of them asked for it and both of them gave it to the other. But more than that, each of them knew that from that moment forward, the past was in the past and there was total and mutual absolution--a cleansing that freed them both to live completely … and love fully.
As he watched the liquid glide into the two glasses, he couldn’t help but think that he, himself, was feeling content, too. And grateful. The people he loved were healthy. He had employment. They had food and shelter. Not everyone was so fortunate during these times. His brow crinkled a bit as he pondered that. What else could his Baker Street family do, he thought, to help those who needed it most right now? John would find a time to talk to Sherlock about it. Between the two of them, he felt confident they could come up with a plan.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted as a smirk began to form. He leaned in a little toward the other man’s face and whispered, “It’s all fine.”
“So it is and he’s walking this way,” Irene gasped, her eyes still fixed on the subject distantly behind Sherlock.
everything to John. And as he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, John knew the three little words that conveyed the depth of his feelings. … the three little words that Sherlock needed to hear.
John grabbed the lube from where it had been hastily placed on the duvet and placed a generous amount into Sherlock’s hand. He then squeezed some onto his own hand, discarded the tube and looked at Sherlock hungrily. John reached down with his lubed-up hand and began rubbing it slowly along and all over Sherlock’s cock. The younger man’s arousal became quickly apparent and he tilted his head back slightly to let John kiss and suck on his neck.
"If you feel good, nod, pet." And Sherlock nodded. Then he cuffed his hands to the headboard and he tied his shins to his thighs so he couldn't move his legs. Sherlock sucked on the gag happily. John took him into his loving arms and started to make another collar of lovebites under the black one, rubbing himself against Sherlock. "Oh pet," John moaned and Sherlock moaned too but it sounded more like a wet purring. "Oh god, fuck!" John swore and found the lube by touch. "Gonna make you feel good, 'Lockie. My good lad."
"Don't be stupid, John, I told you a million times! My brain needs a hard restart now and then and because you banned drugs, the only thing that helps and I can do it is simple BDSM pain-pleasure thing. Now go, I have a case to do." He sighed and went silent again.
He wanted to make a tea for John as a for reconciliation but he had shaky hands so that was off the table. He hugged himself as he went up the stairs and knocked on John's door. "I think something is wrong with me!" He cried out loud, playing it.
John started slamming into Sherlock hard. Sherlock was overwhelmed with delight. He found what he never knew he missed and he made that heard with his moans, grunts and once in a while with word too.
Cold water helped at least for half an hour. He put on his dressing-gown, filled it with ice and entangled in a towel so he wouldn't wet the couch, he lied on it and went in Mind Palace to go thought this situation and solve it. He was taken aback by the smell of coffee and something he never smelled before. It reminded him of gunpowder, sand and wool jumpers and...and home with a hint of tea? He opened his eyes and watched as John sat down to drink coffee and have breakfast because even though he didn't have a shift this week, his soldier clock woke him up at 6 o'clock precisely. He tried to not clink his fork for against plate; maybe not to wake Sherlock up as John always fussed
"Sherlock," John said calmly. "Come back, pet. Kneel here. And bring me your food." He sipped his tea and when Sherlock handed him protein bars and the second glass, he thanked him. "You may come closer and you can even lay your head on my leg, sweetheart." John smiled fondly at him. Poor Sherlock. Sherlock did as he was told, feeling floaty. John broke the protein bars into biteable pieces and hand-fed his little pet. Sherlock hummed happily and always sucked on John's fingers. When Sherlock had two whole protein bars inside himself, John let him have his fingers for sucking as he ate his sandwich and drank his tea. Then he made Sherlock drink the first glass of water.
"An alpha, you specifically," Sherlock answered bored with his rejections. "I want to have your pups." That made John gasp so Sherlock knew he was doing it right. "I want to have my belly round with your pups. Because you put them there. Because you take good care of me. Like a good alpha should." Sherlock mewled like horny omega but couldn't say it wasn't turning him on, John taking care of him.
"It's the first signs of omega's heat. But you got to be an omega first. Are you?" He took another step back.
"Not interested. I told you 15. Now go." John pointed at the bathroom, leaving no room for arguing. And to John's surprise, Sherlock really didn't argue (maybe for the first time in his life) and left. John, proud of himself, went to the kitchen and fetched two flavoured protein bars and filled two glasses of water. Then he made himself a sandwich and tea. He put it on the small tables near their armchairs and waited.
Next day was the same. John did everything he always did and Sherlock still cuffed to bed listened and imagined things that never could be true. It was almost like delirium but he didn't have drugs so he didn't break the deal he had with John. And this was something that his body requested and as long as John didn't know he couldn't leave him.
"Perfect, but first we'll lose that." He started undoing Sherlock's gag and blindfold. "I wanna see and hear you when you come, pet." Sherlock's eyes were glassy from tears, blindfold and subspace and he truly looked fucked out. But he looked so happy.
He checked his list for the last time and left it on John's armchair. He made his way to John's old room and nostalgia hit him. They were just colleagues, but John has found a way to Sherlock's heart and they became friends and then John kissed him sweetly after one dangerous case and Sherlock knew he has found a way to John's. That was almost 3 months ago - exactly 2 months, 19 days and 16 hours. John moved to Sherlock bedroom and this room didn't have a purpose, until now.
"Well, I'm sure Lestrade will keep me updated so we can go home. But I won't be proper companion tonight, I'm afraid," he apologized in his own way.
Family! Pups and a great wife. And Sherlock, as an omega, could have pups! He just needed anticonception suppositories. He frankly didn't have any because he never had sex but that seemed like a big error to him. What if this plan won't work because he doesn't have experience with this kind of things?
"It's the 'connection of feelings with a mate', love," John chucked because he felt Sherlock curiosity. He probably deleted this too.
Oh, and how he needed to eat, he never wanted to eat that much in his whole life. He ate leftover both his and John's, then John's biscuits and on top of that everything he found in the fringe. Food wraps were everywhere and his stomach more than full when Sherlock stood up for shower. Maybe this will make the hot feeling go aways. He tried to catalogue the symptoms but as an omega with beta life, he couldn't figure out it was heat.
He again went up the stair and knocked. Once, twice and he held up his hand to knock trice when John yelled: "What do you want?"
"Go away!" Sherlock tried to open the door but it was locked. "Don't tempt me and go anywhere else in this flat but my room. I don't want you here." He heard chest of drawers being pushed so he barricaded the door.
John pulled him under covers and spooned him, his caring alpha showing. He caressed a little bulge on his underbelly, his semen in his omega. Well breeded omega.
"Oh, John, that's fantastic! It has to be at least 7! C'mon, hurry." It seemed that Sherlock switched to The Work mindset. So John just had to wait. He just put his Belstaff on, yelled something on Mrs Hudson and he was gone.
In second later he fell onto the ground because hot feeling and now backache was holding him in a fetus position. "What happened?" John ran up to the kitchen.
John finally put his hand on him and scented his neck. At that moment another wave of heat went thought Sherlock and he clinged to John. John kissed him thoughtfully and messily and scented his face and upper body. "Jooohn!" Sherlock moaned. "My alpha."
"John can do now, Sherlock," John giggled and kissed his love. "With you, it's always something new...that's why I love you, brat." He waited for a response but none came, Sherlock was asleep with a little smile on his lips. Now he was in his Fourteen-Hour-Post-Case-Sleep-Of-Dead and nothing could wake him up. "I love you, too," John whispered to the quiet room.
He warmed up the lube in his hand and went over his hole with a thumb. He played like this with his boy for a while and when John saw trails from tears, his crotch pulsed (he was little ashamed of himself, this shouldn't turn him on) and dove firstly one finger and then two in Sherlock. He brushed his prostate and watched Sherlock rock as he chased desire. Two fingers were replaced by three and those were replaced by four. "I could easily fist you right now and you couldn't even prevent it from happening. You're in my power now, sweetheart." John pushed on Sherlock's prostate hard and Sherlock started tossing his head from one side to another. John checked but his cock was almost purple and he was obviously trying not to come. "My good boy." John kissed away Sherlock's tears. "You're amazing, gorgeous, I love you so so much." He pulled out his fingers and he pumped on his cock for few times. "You can come when you wish, but I will come into you, even if you'll feel uncomfortable. Okay?" And Sherlock nodded.
, Sherlock thought. Sherlock listened to almost unhearable noises John did until John went to sleep and then Sherlock allowed himself to fall asleep, imagining how lovingly John could hold his restrained body.
"Oh, fuck you." Said Sherlock and shyly pecked John's lips. "Please spent heat with me." He said after that. "I want to have your pups."
Something was wrong. He freed Sherlock's feet and waited until he picked the lock on his cuffs. Sherlock quickly fled to his clothes and he dressed. "Tell me what Lestrade said in that text." He said with a face without emotions but his voice betrayed him. Sherlock was scared... but
When the 10th day of the case started, Sherlock started to lose his mind and John started to worry about him. There were 2 theories now, one - his boss had a motive but had alibi too or two - his neighbour didn't have an alibi but frankly, he didn't have a motive worthy of murder this brutality. "Dammit!" Sherlock shouted and threw a mug on the floor.
Sherlock shivered in anticipation, he will be able to do it again, after those damned years. He already planned his tactic when he was climbing those bloody stairs. He opened an old shoebox and just looked in it for a while. Black gag, pleasure duck tape for BDSM purposes, black silk rope, black padded wrists cuffs with chain, vibrator, three buttplugs with different colour and size, black collar, a big tube of lube and nipple clamps. It should do. He already felt calmer.
It wasn't a bad day, it was a bad week at least. There was a pretty difficult case. In the beginning, it looked like 8 but after while Sherlock understood it was solid ten, or maybe eleven! But he had to solve it because the lives of children were in danger. So every time he should have taken omega suppressant pill he postponed in his mind...for an hour, another one, then day and this way it went on and on.
"Enough!" John shouted back with his Captain's voice. "Deep down you know the answer to that case so stop acting like a spoiled brat and go deeper. That genius brain of yours is better than the murderer's one. You can do it." John picked the pieces of the broken mug. Sherlock was looking at John dumbstruck since he started talking. John had to giggle. Famous genius Sherlock Holmes looked like he was at John's mercy only. "Go and solve that case, sweetheart." John kissed his lips and let his boyfriend work.
"Hold on!" He got on his knees and made Sherlock look in his eyes. "I'm alright with a conversation about kids but right now I need to know if you took some anticonception! If not, we're not doing this. I love this idea of you being pregnant but it doesn't mean it has to be now."
"No sulking, this will come off, we're gonna shower and then you can have it again, 'Lock." John undid it and helped Sherlock to the bathroom and then to the tub. He showered himself and Sherlock and cleaned them both with sandalwood shower gel. Then he dried both of them with a towel and laid them in bed again. "Because you were a good boy, pet." He fastened the collar around Sherlock's neck again. "Now cuddle with me, Sherlock."
"This is far more important than some dead bloke, John. I'm sure that Lestrade can handle it. Now go, so I can finish it!" He was angry with himself. He sounded like a meek kitten and there was a murder! Damn it!
Sherlock got undressed, only leaving boxers on him and he tied his ankles together with the rope. Feeling better he gagged himself and tossed John's old pillow to the end of John's old bed. He layed down on that pillow and cuffed himself to the right front leg of the bed. That way even if John would enter the room, he wouldn't see him. He breathed out and closed his eyes.
Exactly 14 minutes 43 seconds after John's command Sherlock hurried from the bathroom with curls still wet and without a second thought knelt before John. When he realized what he had done he stood up with shock in his eyes. "I'm sorry!" he yelped and embarrassed sat in his armchair.
John said goodbye to Lestrade and followed Sherlock. When he saw him waiting next to a taxi like a well-behaved dog his heart melted. Oh, how he loved his idiot. "Get in, sweetheart," John smiled and tapped Sherlock's arse lightly. Sherlock hopped in the cab and after a few minutes of silence, he spoke.
Then John turned Sherlock on his stomach and nudged Sherlock's bottom with his face, then he dove into his cheeks to find sweetly smelling slick. He lapped it and tasted honey with clove. It was better than anything he ever tasted in his life. Sherlock was now reduced to animal sounds as John took him apart. That was when Sherlock's second orgasm hit and his walls contracted around John's lips.
Just then Sherlock opened the door, water droplets hanging precariously from his dark, curly mop. “I need to borrow your hair dryer,” he stated, as his sentence mingled with the end of John’s.
“And what would stop me from shooting you instead?” he blurted, then wished he hadn’t. For all of a sudden one of the hands holding his arm pulled away and he heard a click behind him as a cold, metal gun barrel hit his lower back. Two other thugs pointed their guns at Mary and Sherlock.
John looked at Sherlock’s face, where a genuine, soft smile had taken form, and could feel his own amazement turn to fondness as his eyes took in the love of his life.
John turned to make his way to his former bedroom, but then stopped and looked down the hallway at the closed door that separated Sherlock’s bedroom from the rest of the world. He suddenly found himself crossing the threshold and standing in the middle of it. The detective’s bedroom was the one place in the flat that was impeccably neat and John found himself wanting to consume everything in it. Somehow, even though he didn’t know where Sherlock was, standing in his bedroom made him feel closer to the man. However, exhaustion was taking over quickly, so he kicked off his shoes, lay down on the bed, pulled up the duvet and burrowed into one of the pillows, which smelled so wonderfully of Sherlock.
“I’ve arranged for you to meet with her tonight,” Mycroft instructed. “You’ll accompany me to a secure location. It’s best if you don’t know the exact area, which is why I must insist that you wear a blindfold. Although as you are no doubt a student of Sherlock Holmes, I assume you’ll figure out where we’re headed by using senses other than your sight.”
His parents were the first to accost him, for about 15 minutes, wanting to know every detail of his life since they’d seen him last. Then he was cornered by Lestrade who quizzed him with questions about a recent case, which was a “two” at most. Finally, he was forced to listen to Mrs. Hudson prattle on about his recent experiment that left orange marks on the ceiling and an indecipherable odor that wouldn’t dissipate in the stairwell. Sherlock excused himself and skulked to the kitchen where he proceeded to pour himself a glass of water and drink it very slowly as he stood by the sink and closed his eyes. After taking a few moments to regroup his thoughts, Sherlock turned to re-join their guests.
John slowly pulled his hand away and looked at Sherlock with an indecipherable gaze. “I think you raked your head.”
John took another sip from his glass, and watched Sherlock turn to look at the fire. The doctor couldn’t tell if the slight blush that had colored the detective’s cheeks was from John’s compliment, Sherlock’s drink, or the heat of the fire.
“What? … Oh, you mean the one from Barts?” inquired John, not turning around, as he was elbow-deep in soap suds washing about four-days worth of dishes.
The younger man was taken aback. John was using his own deductive skills to get to the subtext that makes up most conversations. It caught Sherlock off-guard, which made John’s grin even wider.
John’s mind was a vortex of thoughts and emotions. All of the initial happiness, then hurt, betrayal, grief and forgiveness he had shared with Mary were warring inside of him. He grabbed her hand and looked down at where their two hands held each other. He could feel her warmth and knew that whatever he said now would haunt him for the rest of his life as it either would feel like it hadn’t been enough or it had been too much. So John said nothing and instead looked at her with compassion and understanding and found the same expression mirrored in her face. They held each other’s hands for several minutes, exchanging smiles, Mary wiping moisture from the corners of her eyes now and then, but neither one saying a word. Finally, there was a light tap at the door and the pair turned to see Mycroft enter the room.
Knowing it was useless to feign ignorance, John stared back, biting his lower lip. “Yes,” he replied.
“But that doesn’t mean that he won’t be later,” she finished. “He and your brother had some business to attend to first.”
“So here’s how the plan works,” Moriarty explained as he revealed a handgun. “I’m going to hand you this and you’re going to shoot the person you feel should die. It’s quite simple and painless, if you do it right, and you’ll have done me a huge favor.”
Sherlock had wondered what the experience of kissing John Watson would feel like; afterall, the detective was never satisfied with just theory. He found that the texture and smooth motion of John’s lips on his own was quite a mind-startling sensation. Every surge of John’s mouth fed the addict in Sherlock and he found himself wanting more, in fact, craving more with each second that passed. But it wasn’t just the kiss itself that had Sherlock’s normally focused mind in a spin. What he hadn’t counted on was the effect that the emotion behind the kiss had on him. Kissing someone was physiological. Kissing someone you love and knowing they return that love, well … that’s something much more. As the kiss deepened, Sherlock noted everything from the purring sounds John’s throat was making and the feel of John’s jaws working Sherlock’s mouth open, to the unique and calming scent of, well … John. It was a maelstrom, pulling Sherlock deeper and deeper; yet, he felt no fear of drowning.
Sherlock rolled his eyes yet again. He could hear mundane pleasantries being exchanged and a question about why Mary’s friends were on their hands and knees under the table. Then, something about the conversation caught his attention.
“They’re safe Dr. Watson,” the man replied. He then yelled “Everyone down!” as he and John broke free from the building’s confines and John found himself hurled behind a police car. A few moments later, an explosion rocked the warehouse.
Sherlock’s defiance was quickly thwarted when Irene proceeded to kick him in the shin then duck under the table, causing the young man to yelp. As he bent over to grab his leg, the front of his shirt was suddenly pulled tight and he found himself face-to-face with the fiery co-ed crouched underneath the table. “Get down here, NOW!” Irene hissed.
Sherlock nearly grabbed the wall for support. His mouth formed a perfect “O” as he stared awestruck at John. Just then, Mrs. Hudson walked by and gave Sherlock a brief kiss on the cheek. “Above you,” she stated, as her gaze drifted to the mistletoe under which Sherlock was cluelessly standing. He looked up with heartbreaking disappointment as it dawned on him …
Sherlock interrupted John’s speech as he grabbed his best friend’s face with both hands and looked directly and intently into his eyes. “So did you.”
As if on cue, the car stopped, the door opened and John found himself walking up the steps of his former flat. He passed two hawkish-looking males posted in the main entry as he made his way upstairs. Once inside he stopped momentarily to look at the sitting room (papers and books strewn about) before peeking into the kitchen (experiments haphazardly placed on every conceivable surface). For some reason, a wave of comfort rushed through him and he felt safe and … at home. It was a sensation he hadn’t experienced in a very long time.
John silently nodded as he leaned his head back and stared silently out the window. There would be more to discuss in the days ahead, but Mycroft, sensing the beginnings of John’s adrenaline withdrawal, also remained silent as the car hummed along the highway.
Sherlock waited for John’s inevitable realization, but none came. He waited for the rubbing to stop. But it didn’t. He waited for the kissing to be replaced by an audible gasp. But, there was none to be heard. John continued to bestow kisses and touches lovingly upon Sherlock until suddenly, the detective pulled away and looked seriously at his partner. Startled, John looked at his friend tentatively.
John was just outside the door asking him to make up his mind from which restaurant they were going to order dinner.
Sherlock looked at John as if he’d made his point clear, and John desperately wanted the detective to feel understood, but the doctor’s facial expression must have betrayed his confusion, because Sherlock’s face wilted a little and he looked back down at the glass in his lap. “That is to say,” he mumbled. “I’ve learned that certain people I know provide an endless source of fascination for me.”
“I don’t much care,” John replied. “You pick the restaurant.” He then turned and walked back down the hallway to the sitting room leaving Sherlock staring at his backside—John’s perfectly fascinating backside with John’s perfectly-fitted trousers cupping John’s perfectly-muscled arse and his hips moving, no, swaying with every step.
John shook internally. He and Mary had been working through the divorce but something about this meeting seemed so final. He sighed, ran a hand through his hair, as was his unconscious tell when emotion was involved, and slowly opened the door.
At some unknown signal, the large hand that was immobilizing John’s forearm moved and yanked the blindfold from his head. As John blinked furiously, his eyes adjusting to the dim light, he could make out the figure of Mary about three meters away, mouth taped shut, on her knees, facing him, hands secured behind her back. Her make-up was smeared and her eyes looked weary. John looked at her and, although they had been in the middle of divorce proceedings, he still felt compassion toward her … still felt a sense of gratefulness for the meaning she had brought back into his life after Sherlock had jumped from Barts. She and John had been through so much as they suffered together through the miscarriage of their child and then the freefall of their marriage.
"If you insist," Sherlock answered moving nothing but his lips. When later he came out from Mind Palace he didn't remember that he said something out loud, he thought that John in Mind Palace said it. And now, John wanted to make a small experiment on his own and try it again.
"Sherlock, why didn't you tell me about what you did in my old room? You know you can tell me anything," he said softly, his fingers still tangled in brown curls.
When he looked at John again his eyes were cloudy and he was truly under. "I can't believe you're so good for me. Will you crawl to the bedroom, pet? I changed my mind, I want you in bed." Sherlock nodded and started to crawl to their bedroom. John picked the second glass of water and followed him. In the bedroom, Sherlock knelt by the door and put his hands behind his back. "Undress and c' mere," John patted the bed and went to the wardrobe for a little box covered in brown paper. "Wanna see what's inside, pet?" Sherlock looked at his obscenely looking underwear dirty with come.
"I can't let you leave me over something that my body requires," Sherlock said like it was something so obvious.
The case lasted eight days for now. Sherlock came from 14 theories to 4 and one of them he prefered. DI Lestrade found out who that dead man was after two days. His name was Matthew Weaver and he was some worker in a famous London money company.
"We will discuss being on suppressants that long later. Now tell me when was the last time you took the pill."
He texted one beta from his homeless network to buy pills and throw them in mail hole at 221B. In two hours he had a dose of pre-sex suppositories and popped one in the mouth. He felt less dizzy with lust after so he knew it worked.
"That's understandable. My hard limits are blood, piss and in fact, any human fluids besides come and saliva. Yes and exhibitionism and rape themed sessions, crossdressing and sharing you. They're no go for me." John nodded for himself. "I think further questions can come later."
"Because it's just heat and hormones talking." John signed not touching Sherlock, just having hands in fists. "You don't actually feel about me that way." Sadness in his voice broke Sherlock's heart. No, he felt like that a long time but thought that John was like any other alpha. Just trying to tie omega to themselves, not actually caring about their brain or ambitions. But John was different and he proved that to Sherlock every day.
"Shush," John said and stripped both of them and laid them on the bed. They laid there in a hug scenting, kissing and licking every piece they could reach of the other one.
"Maybe? But that doesn't matter. I'm not a slave nor a whore and I take suppressants from a young age." Sherlock answered and pouted.
Even though his rational part of his brain - that last cells that still worked- told him that John would understand....he always did.
It was about half a month ago when it happened. John played with his hair, sometimes scratching or massaging his scalp, while Sherlock was in his Mind Palace and John was bored. "Wanna cup of tea, Sherlock?" He asked.
When Sherlock went another orgasm he felt as John's knot started forming. Oh, how he needed and wanted that. "Gimme pups!" He cried out and that woke finally that feral part of John as he mounted and nicely breeded his omega. His knot locked into Sherlock hole and he emptied himself to groaning mess underneath.
"You're not-" John opened the door, concerned, but saw no-one. Sherlock started to fight a panic attack. John will see and he will leave him. "Sherlock?" John asked again and he noticed that one pillow on the bed was missing. He walked around the bed and saw Sherlock - restrained and almost naked Sherlock with droll covered ball-gag beside him. And he saw fear in his boyfriend's eyes before he hid them under a cold stone mask.
"You smell..." John growled from behind the door and Sherlock's knees buckled. "Nothing is wrong. Just old books and honey with clove. Now go away, omega!"
That was the second thing that John learned when he started sleeping with Sherlock. He could come just from anal stimulation alone. And John thought that was so fucking hot and extraordinary like Sherlock was. But John did and he promised and buried inside that perfect arse and he started moving again, causing little 'ah's and 'oh's from Sherlock. Sherlock closed his eyes and looked maybe 10 years younger. In two minutes John came too. He never finished this early but he couldn't resist.
In another hour when Sherlock was on and off on his laptop and in Mind Palace, John learned a few basics and was ready for an upcoming opportunity. Sherlock was always high on adrenaline when he solved a case and made noise 'till late AM and that seemed like an outlet to surplus energy. Even though some things scared John and he hoped Sherlock didn't like them.
John eased himself in Sherlock and he just whimpered, he was beyond all words now. He looked at John like he was the only thing holding him from the outer world. And he was... John snapped his hips twice and Sherlock came untouched between them with tears streaming from his eyes.
John needed some tea to organize his own thoughts. After 22 minutes he decided. He will do everything to make Sherlock happy. He can't lose him over the fact that he can't satisfy him fully. He was called Three continent Watson for nothing. But as Sherlock always said, he needed to do research first.
As Moriarty spoke, John could feel the man’s presence getting closer until it felt like he was being wrapped in a cloak of dread.
“Oh, Irene lost a contact and Sherlock is helping her look for it,” he could hear Mary commenting. To which John questioned, “Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes?”
Relief and happiness spread instantly across John’s face as he simply replied, “Good. That’s good.” Ducking his head, John turned his back to Sherlock and began to walk into the sitting room when he murmured, “I’m looking forward to our date.”
John couldn’t help but giggle at that, as he caressed Sherlock’s cheek and shared a smile with the man he loved.
, clamped John’s hand and lifted it near the side of his head. John’s eyes shot wide open to see the predatory expression on Sherlock’s face. The detective had turned the tables momentarily and was on the hunt. The thought of being Sherlock’s prey was intensely stimulating, motivating John to retaliate. Before Sherlock could grasp John’s cock with his other hand, John boldly grabbed Sherlock’s free hand and lifted it along with his own hand up toward the top of the bed, so now both of John’s hands and both of Sherlock’s were grasped together tightly, fingers entwined on the pillow. Totally encaged by limbs, John silently looked at his lover with dark, determined eyes.
John placed a soft kiss onto his best friend’s lips, awakening every dream that had long been buried. As the kiss deepened, Sherlock guided John into his lap, the two of them stroking each other’s shoulders, chests and every bit of skin they could find. Eventually, they reluctantly broke away, panting into each other’s mouths, trying to catch their breaths.
John had put his life on the line for Sherlock in the past. That was a fact. But Sherlock didn’t want just the facts anymore. Not after John had opened his eyes to another dimension. Sherlock darted through the room looking for something more than just the cold, hard facts. He wanted the truth. He
“Ah finally, words! I was getting worried,” Moriarty teased. “Dear, John, do you really think death can stop me? “
John noticed Sherlock shift slightly in his seat and look away again toward the fire, and John joined him, their faces taking in the warmth and light. There were several moments of quiet, with just the soft hiss of flames accompanying the dancing shadows across the walls. Then suddenly, a soft whisper broke through.
Sherlock could feel his own cock mercilessly throbbing inside its new home, and he wanted to go deeper. He had to go deeper. But he physically couldn’t. He was already pressed hard against John.
It had been four weeks since he and Sherlock and Rosie had started self-isolating due to the pandemic. John had been working as part of a telehealth network and was able to work from home, conducting online consultation, providing diagnosis, referring patients and prescribing medication. Mrs. Hudson, relieved that John could work from the safety of his own home, had allowed him to set up a rudimentary office in 221C. So depending on his shift, he “went to work” leaving Rosie and Sherlock to conduct experiments, prepare culinary “delights,” and experience adventure. John never knew what he’d find when he finished work and walked back upstairs into the flat. One time it was a castle made of blankets. Another time it was a pirate ship in their sitting room (which looked very much like their sofa). Evenings, when John wasn’t on-call, were full of conversation, films and board games (even a lively, follow-the-rules version of Cluedo). Then, after Rosie went to bed, those same evenings took a quiet turn as two men sat comfortably in front of the fire, sometimes reading, sometimes talking and sometimes enjoying the soft strains of a violin.
Turning off the taps, Sherlock stepped out of the shower and wrapped himself in his dressing gown, realizing that he wasn’t any closer to solving the “case.”
When Sherlock entered the room where the reception was being held, his eyes scanned the crowd and alighted on a group of four men, three of whom were talking animatedly. He quickly and confidently deduced that the first man was a highly-distinguished neurosurgeon with a cheating wife and a high-strung, misbehaving cocker spaniel. The second was a GP, with a prescription drug habit and an affinity for hair product. And the third, was a vascular surgeon, dating an affluent American heiress and currently in the midst of declaring personal bankruptcy.
Suddenly, John called through the detective’s closed bedroom door. “Sherlock, come out here. Your parents just arrived.”
“Yes,” John conceded. “It just naturally happened as they were working on you. I swear. I didn’t mean to, it’s just—”
Sherlock looked down at their hands. He was embarrassed that he had even had those crazy, insecure thoughts. “I thought maybe you had changed your mind.”
Sherlock slowly whispered repeatedly with astonishment. Then, with sudden clarity, he looked at John and confessed, “
Sherlock always knew John was noble; the soldier in him. He was protective; the doctor in him. He was loyal; the friend in him. But until that moment, he never realized how much John loved and cared about him.
Rich, burgundy-painted walls and cushioned furniture throughout the room actually gave it a nice, warm feeling. A small, wooden table and two padded chairs were set up in the center of the room; Mary was currently occupying one of them. She lifted her head when he came in, a slight, anxious smile on her face. She was dressed casually and her hair had been dyed brunette. Her make-up was much different than the way she had worn it previously and John had to blink to make sure it was really her sitting there. He closed the door gently and approached the softly-lit setting.
Sherlock was becoming drunk on power at causing such a reaction in John. And John was enjoying the moment. So, Sherlock pumped precisely into him again. “Aaaahhh … you mad man … you brilliant, mad man,” came John’s response.
He had agonized for weeks over the discovery as Sherlock lay in hospital recovering from the bullet wound that John’s wife had created. Guilt. Anger. Sadness. The emotions had surfaced and resurfaced inside of John on several occasions since then, but each time there was some “reason” he justified to continue burying them. However, this time emotion overpowered reason.
John couldn’t take his eyes off Sherlock, and Sherlock’s reciprocating stare felt to John like it was penetrating his soul. John noticed that a small bruise was starting to form on the side of Sherlock’s face. No doubt a result of a shared deduction that hadn’t been appreciated. Both men tried to simultaneously read each other’s thoughts and attempted to send each other non-verbal signals. The problem was that under such stressful conditions and the blinding cover of sentiment, neither one could formulate a coherent thought.
Sherlock’s heart felt as if it would beat out of his chest but he continued calmly and lightly gliding the bow over the instrument wanting to greet John in a warm, but non-threatening way. He slowly turned to see John standing in the doorway, his lips formed in a beautiful (there was that word again), soft smile. Although Sherlock had played the song dozens of times in the past, he currently found himself struggling to remember the notes. The two men stared at each other, the battle of the blues going on for several moments. Then Sherlock turned toward the window, continuing to work through the piece, as John walked toward his chair and took a seat for a front-row viewing of his own private concert. A glass of scotch was (thankfully) placed on the side table near John’s chair and he noticed another glass had been poured and set precariously on the arm of Sherlock’s chair.
As he remained captured in this unknown spell, Sherlock could feel his anxiousness rise. He wanted to tell John about his trip to his Mind Palace. He wanted John to know what he’d found. He wanted John to know what he had gone through and what he’d discovered about himself and about John. And, deep down he needed to hear the usual praise John bestowed upon him when he made a particularly brilliant deduction. But more importantly, and this was the true pinnacle of Sherlock’s enlightenment, he wanted to let John know how he felt. Not because it was best for Sherlock, but after all John had been through, Sherlock selflessly believed John deserved to know that he was loved. As he geared himself up to tell John, he realized the strangeness of it all. Sherlock had faced death and potential tragedy so many times in the past, and yet, he was finding that it took more courage and bravery in this moment to tell John his feelings than he’d ever had to garner in the past. Still, as he looked into his best friend’s eyes, Sherlock knew the three little words that conveyed the depth of his feelings … the three little words that John needed to hear.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, as he fell into a trance gazing at John’s deep, blue eyes; his long, blonde eyelashes; his strong, sturdy face; and his thin, wet lips.
“My apologies, John, but I have been otherwise occupied in the course of the last two days making sure that Moriarty is, in fact, dead this time, and that neither he, nor his drones, will cause my brother and the people he cares about any further harm.”
And, as most of those in London were beginning their day, John and Sherlock were peacefully drifting off to sleep amidst dreams of love, cases, deductions, weddings and bees.
His gaze then made the inevitable journey to John’s shoulder where an army battle scar stood at attention. It looked like a collection of gnarled tree roots, the healing process obviously impeded by infection. To anyone else, it would have caused a flinch or furled brow at least … or averted eyes at most. But Sherlock’s eyes were unblinkable and his expression was unwavering. He was studying it like a student at university who was preparing for a test. Every connection where wrinkled skin bonded with the smooth layer, every bump and valley and every slight discoloration found its way to John’s room in Sherlock’s Mind Palace. But Sherlock wasn’t the only one who was studying.
John jerked his neck to look at Sherlock’s profile. The doctor’s heart was definitely beating faster and harder and John could feel his breath hitch slightly as Sherlock slowly turned to face him.
A few moments before, in a different part of London, in a large home, on a non-descript street, a very desperate man suddenly stopped his prowling to retrieve a text.
Finally, Sherlock bent his head forward and turned to face John’s neck, returning the favor. However, he added his own twist, adding small bites that caused John to gasp “Oh, God, yes” and hold onto Sherlock even tighter. When the detective-turned-snogger was satisfied with the work he’d completed on his partner’s neck, his lips released their prey and the two men held still for a moment; faces touched cheek to cheek; quick, uneven, hot breaths blew past each other’s ears.
“So impatient,” Moriarty chided. “You see, I need you to do me a favor. I have a decision to make and I’m having a bit of trouble. So I thought a military man such as yourself would be able to do it for me, you know, since you have to make split-second decisions during wartime.”
Finally, Sherlock let go of John’s waist, clasped his hand, and led him down the hallway to the bedroom, looking back, as if to double check that John was still okay with this progression. John was more than okay with how things were going, allowing himself to be pulled along, not really sure if his feet were touching the floor … and not really caring. With the fond look Sherlock gave him, John returned a besotted, school-boy grin … (again) not really caring. Throughout the short journey to the bedroom, it was a dazed yet exhilarating feeling John experienced. The Work had always come first and he had always accepted his silver medalist place with Sherlock. But today, well … today, John and their relationship were the priority … and it was all gold.
Sherlock, whose breathing had ceased at the mention of the young man’s name, made to turn his head when Mary reproached him.
… Contrary to his own beliefs, Sherlock was having a very imaginative mental conversation with himself as he stood in the shower, leaning one hand against the wet tiles as the other one tugged at his water-laden curls. He was thankful for the hot water cascading over his lanky form, as it seemed to calm his nerves, which had been fine until about an hour ago. That’s when Sherlock had had a very lengthy and heated debate with a hearing specialist.
Then the former army doctor, and consummate healer, leaned forward. “And this,” he said, as he gently put his lips on Sherlock’s chest, and placed a small, intimate kiss right over his heart, “is for all the other scars.”
So I decided to just go ahead and post the final three chapters and wrap up the story. I hope you enjoy them. Thank you so much for reading!
John shook his head sorrowfully, “No. No, Sherlock. I saw the scars. The horrors you must have faced. You sacrificed so much in those two years!”
John’s face began to soften and Sherlock suddenly felt very protective of his friend. In fact, he wanted to show the other “gentlemen” in the group, just how important John was.
Sherlock’s thoughts were as unruly as his curls were behaving at that moment. John had insisted that they host a Christmas Eve party for friends and family because
“Sherlock?” John quietly asked, watching as the detective blinked a few times and brought himself out of whatever room of his Mind Palace in which he had lost himself.
John couldn’t help the warm smile that formed on his face. “Yes, she’s quite brilliant at that, isn’t she?”
Within the last few months or so, Sherlock had been experiencing thoughts and feelings that he hadn’t experienced before. Thoughts and feelings that seemed to swirl around his flatmate. And every time he began to experience a particular thought or feeling, he’d place it on a shelf and store it away in his mind palace, promising himself that he’d examine it when he had some time.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was making a valiant effort of employing his own technique to restore normal breathing as he continued freeing the button from its fabric cage. He then moved his fingers downward toward the next two buttons, making a gentle swipe with his thumb down John’s sternum in the process and causing a slight shudder in the doctor. Sherlock would stop if he felt John was truly in distress, but his partner’s breathing had evened out as he now leaned his forehead on Sherlock’s lips. His grip on Sherlock’s waist had eased a little prompting the younger man to continue his descent down the front of his partner’s shirt, unfastening each button with care as if they were made of crystal and could break with a single touch.
“You said ‘people’, plural,” John prodded, hoping that the conversation was turning in a direction that might open a door that he thought had been bolted shut. “Who else do you find stimulating?”
Just then Sherlock felt a little part of John’s tongue pressing along his lips, as if knocking on a locked door humbly asking for entrance. Sherlock was hopeless to do anything but give John the keys.
With a groan, Sherlock peeled off John and the doctor padded to the bathroom to clean himself. He then quickly returned with a wet, warm flannel and proceeded to lovingly clean his partner, who lay with one arm thrown over his eyes. With each wipe of the cloth, Sherlock let out an appreciative hum. Once John was satisfied, he threw the flannel somewhere in the vicinity of the discarded clothing and crawled under the sheets. Sherlock joined him and the two of them lay face to face on the pillows staring at each other.
John thought he was going to be sick. Not only was Moriarty going to force him to decide, he was going to have John do the dirty work as well. John’s mind raced for anything, anything at all that looked like a way out of this.
As their bodies began to settle and the haze began to clear, John’s mind replayed the moment when he could feel Sherlock washing through him. He felt marked, but not controlled. John knew that this amazing man wanted him … needed him … chose him … and loved him. He was Sherlock’s. And he always would be.
“You have always been the most fascinating human being I’ve ever known, John,” Sherlock stated, almost resolutely. “You’re a mixture of protection and danger; peace and chaos. You’re a dichotomy. The greatest puzzle I’ve ever encountered. And the thing is, you don’t even realize it. Because it’s just who you are. And I lo—I love the whole person … you … I love you.”
Sherlock turned and noticed a small, blonde-haired woman with bright blue eyes making her way toward them.
Sherlock mentally braced himself as if a hurricane was on the horizon and he was strapped to a tree.
So as the trees began to turn beautiful shades of yellow and red and a cooler nip filled the air, Sherlock was settling down into a comfortable routine. His classes still bored him to tears, but as long as he could perform his experiments, he was somewhat satisfied, or at least, less agitated. He should have know the feeling wouldn’t last.
John lunged forward and kissed Sherlock firmly on the mouth. The younger man responded in kind and the two of them began passionately “speaking” with lips, teeth and tongues. Suddenly, John pulled away, and what happened next, well, it would stay burned in Sherlock’s mind forever.
“Oh, no fair. You peeked,” quipped Moriarty. “No matter. I really can’t wait for you to see the rest of your surprise.”
Sherlock gave the men a quick insincere smile, then grabbed John’s wrist and the pair retreated quickly, winding their way to the registration area. The threesome they left behind stood stock still with facial expressions so blank they’d make the Mona Lisa look emotional.
John chuckled and broke away, wiping his hand hastily on the duvet. He laid down on the bed and placed a pillow under himself, bent his knees and spread himself fully, looking lustfully at Sherlock.
“Well, … I’m not married anymore,” he blurted out, not really sure why he felt the need to proclaim it, but somehow finding relief that he did.
said Sherlock, feeling relief that he didn’t have to actually say it, and yet aware of a sudden phantom dryness in his mouth, as if he had.
This only affirmed John’s plan and he pulled his hand upward, slowing the activity and eliciting another incoherent sound from Sherlock’s lips.
“Did you find it?” Mary smiled at Sherlock as he regained his seat across from the women. The young man looked at her with a blank stare until Irene interrupted, “Oh, yes. All better. Sherlock’s laser focus found it.” Irene gave Sherlock a wide-eyed stare and the man instinctively scooted his chair back a little and pulled his shins closer to his body so Irene wouldn’t feel the need to repeat the kick that was probably leaving a bruise at the moment.
Yes, it was strange, John thought as he pulled down two glasses and a bottle of whiskey from the shelf.
John refrained from rolling his eyes. God, the Holmes brothers certainly had a flair for the dramatic.
Sherlock had so much information to process that he was at a complete loss as to how to respond. He continued looking at John, waiting for some sort of cue. And then it came.
“My decision, John. Try to keep up would you?” Moriarty admonished him. “I can’t decide. One of them has to die and I can’t choose. You see, they’ve both greatly disappointed me and yet, they’re both such fascinating specimens. I thought I’d keep one of them around for a while. After all, even I get bored sometimes and both of them can provide a good challenge when provoked. Anyway, that’s where you come in.”
But instead of all that, he was forced to simply hold it and experience it. It felt like fire engulfing him, then a tidal wave of joy crashing into him, followed by a moment of peace washing through him, then back into the fire again.
, John thought. He gave her a quick, assuring smile, although he was feeling anything but confident at that moment.
Besides, there were times when the relationship between Sherlock and himself still seemed so fragile. Even though the “Eurus situation” had taken place several years ago, John still felt that he and Sherlock were still getting their feet back under them. And since earning Sherlock’s forgiveness, John was determined never to do something to upset the delicate balance the two of them had built over these past few years.
As Sherlock tried to will his heart to calm down, his brain to reboot and his mouth to make a sound, he was confused as to why he was having this physical reaction. He also realized that he still hadn’t said anything and John was looking at him with a hopeful look that was turning swiftly into something that resembled dejection.
Test after test was completed with no conclusive evidence that Sherlock had any type of hearing loss or difficulty. Sherlock had gone into the appointment convinced that it was a hearing issue. So, when he was told that the results were to the contrary, and those results were based on “irrefutable” facts, he was extremely frustrated, to say the least. Every time the medical professional spoke, Sherlock countered. Back and forth it continued until Sherlock stood up and began to pace, mumbling to himself. And, that’s when the poor doctor made the monumental mistake of suggesting that maybe the detective had an overactive imagination and perhaps a psychological evaluation was in order.
Sherlock sprang from the sofa so fast even Mycroft’s unflappable assistant was startled. He quickly grabbed his coat and the pair made their way to the waiting car outside. After a 45-minute trek, during which time Sherlock’s mind raced with approximately 57 scenarios of how John and he were going to react when they saw each other again, the car stopped. But before Sherlock could exit, Anthea stopped him.
“So, you can see why I’m having such a tough time making a decision, can’t you?” Moriarty interrupted the stare down.
As the final veil of emotional ignorance was lifted from Sherlock, John disappeared in an instant, along with his room. And the detective was left shaking outside the doors of his Mind Palace, alone and exhausted.
“You’ll see him soon enough, John,” Mycroft interrupted. John had given up long ago being surprised when either Holmes brother appeared to read his thoughts before he actually verbalized them. “For now, you’re going to stay at Baker Street under heavy guard so we can make sure the details of this Moriarty business are finalized this time. I’ll be in touch. In the meantime, try to get some rest.”
John was still looking intensely at his partner, which caused the detective’s brain to momentarily fog up, but then Sherlock leaned over and opened the drawer to his bedside table, pulling a condom and lube from it.
At that moment, John turned and caught his eye; the look on his face was one of slight confusion as he stared at the detective. Then John’s facial expression turned to one of understanding as he mouthed silently, “I love you.”
And because the car had come to a complete stop, as throngs of oblivious, mobile-swiping students ambled in front of it, and because he still had 10 minutes until the start of his next class, and because he was just plain bored out of his mind, Sherlock furrowed his brow and began a litany of deductions.
For a moment Mycroft looked a little taken aback, but quickly engaged the Holmesian-tactic of feigning nonchalance in the presence of possible sentiment.
Sherlock wrapped his lips around John’s thick shaft and began to gently suck the tip of it. Slowly, he swirled his tongue and John’s hips began to twitch slightly.
Then Sherlock’s expression turned a bit predatory as he fisted the front of John’s jumper and murmured in his best low register, “Got your breath back?”
John was staring at his partner with concern. “Sherlock, what’s going on in that mind of yours? Tell me. Please?”
The heat of the kiss increased and the couple found themselves clumsily making their way to sitting positions on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, their bodies continuing to touch, their lips still moving in unison. Finally, Sherlock’s hands, which had been groping every inch of John’s jumper, began peeling the woolen barrier slowly up the man’s body. The two of them broke their kiss momentarily so Sherlock could free it from John’s upper body, and threw the article of clothing with a flourish to the far end of the room. Then, like a gasping fish out of water, John’s mouth closed over Sherlock’s and they were sharing breath like it was a matter of survival.
Sherlock’s brain screeched to a halt and he nearly pulled a muscle in his neck as he turned to look at his retreating flatmate. “Wha- what did you say?” he inquired, his eyelids blinking uncontrollably.
“Why don’t you ask Dr. Watson?” scoffed Mycroft. “He probably has connections in the medical field that far surpass mine.”
Like a child with his hands caught in a jar of sweets, Sherlock’s face revealed his guilt. But just for a split second. Then he regained his composure and decided an “I’m- affronted-that-you’d-accuse-me” approach would be best. However, this only solidified John’s resolve as he crossed his arms and settled in for an epic stare-down.
“Well, we’re not married, but we do live together,” Sherlock answered innocently, totally unaware of the double meaning.
“I know,” John spoke decidedly, as his hand instinctively reached for Sherlock’s cheek. “I love you, too.”
At the same time, John’s brain worked overtime to find a way out of this—a way that neither Mary nor Sherlock had to die. He screamed internally,
While Sherlock was busy stripping John of his clothing, the former army captain’s brain had gone from panic at the first realization of what Sherlock was doing, to fear as he knew what he would be forced to reveal as soon as the fabric slipped off his shoulder, to calm as he remembered whose hands were lovingly upon him. As Sherlock’s hands came to the end of their journey, John opened his eyes and looked up into his partner’s laser blues. Only one word filled his mind at that moment—trust. John took Sherlock’s roaming hands and placed them in Sherlock’s lap, then looked down to pull his own shirt out from where it was being held hostage at his waistline. There were two more buttons that John unfastened, along with the buttons at his wrists.
From statistics, Sherlock knew omega spending heat alone meant real pain and temporary depression. If he didn't want that he needed John to spend the heat with him. He took down his boxers and tied his gown. That way John could knot him easily but he wasn't going around flat naked. He went to the door of their flat when he finally heard John going down the stairs.
"Other time, baby. Now lay on the bed and let me have fun." John laid him down and kissed him. "Be good." Firstly he fastened the collar around Sherlock's neck and he took off his dog tags and put them on Sherlock's neck. His alabaster skin looked so divine like this. Then he put on the blindfold and his penis gag. Sherlock's wasn't to play tonight.
But three fingers weren't enough. He needed more. Four, five and then all hand just to touch his glands and cum for the first time in his life. On his lips was John's name and he tried to breathe as much of his scent as possible. He was still in a good state of mind, but now he thought like an ordinary person, or ordinary omega, not genius.
When Lestrade arrived they invaded his office and when they arrested him, Sherlock started. "You couldn't let Matthew Weaver ruin your illegal money-making so you killed him. Or I should say it this way: You told your son to buy a big barrel of acid from the black market and kill him when you're live on TV. Then he had to hide the body in one storage space you can rent but he made a mistake here. That storage space wasn't in London and he had to be at his friend's birthday party so he dropped that acid barrel with the body under a random bridge hoping nobody would notice until that dead body will decompose. So next time, please don't let your son kill, he's an idiot." Sherlock finished with a smirk and with his collar up he left the room.
Because of pure instinct, Sherlock grabbed the most comfortable clothes and then he went through dirty clothes and picked John's. They smelled wonderfully now with "new" omega nose. He ran to his room and with his sheets and John's clothes made a sort of nest.
"Any hard limit, pet?" John asked again, trying to ignore his erection. Gosh, Sherlock was breathtaking like this, reduced to his primal self.
So they went to get a takeaway and they ended up in 221B an hour later, there was a horrible traffic jam and Sherlock sulked and didn't want to go by metro. He immediately jumped on the sofa and sunk into the Mind Palace in his usual pose. John huffed and ate his food in silence. That was unusual so it was uncomfortable. He turned on the TV and he lifted Sherlock's head and laid it on his lap.
So here he was now. The case was finally closed and he enjoyed the post case adrenaline, pacing at home and trying to find entertainment whilst John slept. At 02:18:53 he started to feel tingly. And he knew exactly when he started to feel hot. So hot. He had to strip himself from jeans and then also a shirt.
Sherlock muttered an irritated "hmpf" and stamped angrily. He needed a proper plan. Something that always John wanted.
Sherlock groaned and stood up. "I'm feverish, my back hurts and I don't like it! You're the doctor, you tell me!" He shouted and John froze.
Sherlock, who never missed anything immediately pointed out that the boss of that company was tunnelling that and few other companies and theorized of Matthew finding out about it and trying to blackmail his boss. That made sense. But there was a little piece that ruined the whole artwork. At the supposed time of death, his boss had a live interview with
So Sherlock was in his room, in his thoughts, counting every passing second, thinking about what just John said. He was Alpha, as Sherlock knew from day one, he took care of him and wanted nothing back, nor obedience nor the coitus. He also seemed like a puppy who always run after him, clinging to him like to mother. But that could be just Sherlock running off without telling something to someone.
"You may, pet." John tugged Sherlock by his curls and he swallowed him and moaned at the feeling of having John in his mouth, unwashed musky masculine smell hitting his nose. "Good lad. My good, good lad," John praised him and almost yelped when Sherlock swallowed him whole. He still didn't understand how Sherlock couldn't have a gag reflex. "Stop," he tugged his curls again, this time away from his cock. "I don't want to come just yet. But you said overstimulation so maybe I could make you come and then fuck you into a rug and then make you come again. How does that sound?" John soon learned that Sherlock has a really really shot refractory period. Sherlock had something about 17 minutes when John had something about an hour or so. "Yes, yes, oh John. So clever, brilliant, captain. Oh god!" Sherlock moaned. "How do you wanna come, pet? By my mouth, hand or even foot. Or I could let you rub yourself against my leg until you come into your pants like the dirty boy you are." John offered him his leg. Sherlock leaned on John's knee and when John nodded, he started rubbing himself. Oh, how good it felt! Sherlock was now reduced to mewling sounds and soon he shut his eyes tightly and whimpered as he came in his boxers.
"I know we should've done it first but I didn't think you would sink into 'space so quickly, pet. We need to talk about rules, baby. Would you rather use the yes/no system for questions?"
"Ahright, love you and is not heat talking, gonna sleep now."  Sherlock just said and then John heard steady breathing. That was weird because Sherlock didn't sleep most day, but maybe it was just a lot of new things. And a bond too.
Sherlock was on the phone with Lestrade when John decided to go to sleep. Sherlock would be here all night, thinking, solving and probably napping for a necessary hour so he was more useful rested tomorrow. "'night, Sherlock," he gave him a quick peck on his lips and went to bed. Sometimes he was glad that he was used to falling asleep fast. Because if not, he would have to think about what he planned to do for Sherlock and he was afraid that he would be too scared to do so after thinking.
