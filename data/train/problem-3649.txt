“I think I’d like that.”
“Are you planning on staying there all day, or do you actually want me to strap your wing up?” The sentence is thrown over Castiel’s shoulder as he leaves, briefly turning to see Dean’s attention snap back to him and push away from the wall - the way he flinches in pain doesn’t go unnoticed - as he all but scrambles to catch up to the angel.
"Dean..." He held a hand up to stop whatever was about to be said.
“D’you make these too, Jack?”
” The words come out as a whisper as he tears his eyes away to look at Castiel.
“Hey,
… I haven’t run like that in a long time.” Dean lets out another deep breath as he looks down at the familiar in his arms. “If you’re gonna do that again, give a guy some warning, yeah? Or try running somewhere I can see you, so I don’t have to chase you again.” Castiel’s tail thumps once against the ground, small leaves and other debris lifting up as he moves away to look at Dean properly.
“And the feathers?” Castiel hesitated, getting a closer look at the one Sam had brought before snatching it out of his hand.
“You're my family Dean, it isn't a problem.” Dean's wings rose with the compliment, and began absent-mindedly stroking the inside of Castiel's wrist with his thumb.
What they now meant to him.
“... I’m still not getting out of this, am I?”
“Okay… Come on Dean, you got this. If Cas believes you can do it, you can do it.” He takes a deep breath in, relishing in the coolness of the air before letting it out again slowly. “Right. Just… Open your wings out, and glide down… Simple.” The way his feathers twitch as his wings open gives him a brief moment of pause before deciding to ignore it, opening them enough that he doesn’t just plummet the distance to the ground. He vaguely hears Castiel shouting words of encouragement, feeling his excitement before opening one eye the tiniest amount to see how close he really is to landing. His own excitement spikes as he sees he’s closer than he realised; wings flaring out as his emotions take over.
"Where d'you hide your wings? Cause I know they're there somewhere." The angel didn't reply, rolling his shoulders and then Dean couldn't see. A mix of midnight blue and emerald green swam before his eyes when the light reflected off the dark that had taken Dean's vision, and then it moved, snapping him out of his staring. Dean's mouth was left hanging open as they moved and Castiel faced him instead. Worry was written all over his face, the fear that the now adult Dean wouldn't share the same enthusiasm about them as fledgling Dean.
“I need you to try and relax your wings as much as you can for me... I don’t want to injure you by accident.” A slow breath out was Castiel’s only response as he watched tension ease out of Dean’s body, wings going lax behind the hunter. “Good. Are you ready?”
“Just grace. It's just... Grace. My grace...” Dean ran a hand through his hair. “Oh, that feels weird to say.” A knock on the door startled him to his senses, spinning round on the spot to face it.
“So I’m grounded for the foreseeable?” Dean drags his hand down his face, hissing as his wings drop.
“Don’t you
“That kind of run, yes. Now the weather is getting nicer again, it seems the curse of being the breed I am is rearing its head.” He turned to Dean, another coy smile on his face. “It might even have to be a daily occurrence.” A small amount of colour drained from Dean’s face at the prospect of exercise, picking up his mug again and silently draining the remainder of it as Castiel tilted his head at the Empath.
“They don't believe me. Seems like leaking grace and wings is a good enough sign for them.” A rumble of disapproval was the only reply he got, followed by a brief feeling of defeat. Dean closed his eyes, trying to savour the connection, the closest he had been to Castiel since he had been taken.
! That’s not
"Yes, Dean?"
“Just do it. Quicker we can figure it out, quicker we can get to fixing it.” Dean closes his eyes, trying to will himself to relax so Castiel can work unimpeded. He feels the warmth of the angel’s grace seeping through the feathers that coat the top of his wing; curious, purpose driven,
You can always come shout at me on tumblr if you want (username is the same as here), if there's anything you want to shout at me about, story related or not :)
“No, I can't feel anything.” He poked at it, trying to get some sort of reaction from it, confusion setting itself firmly on his face. “Strange.” Castiel squinted, something about it seeming achingly familiar. He tilted his head to see if a different angle would yield any answers, feeling like they were tantalisingly close to being discovered yet remaining irritatingly just out of reach. Sam looked on, not understanding how grace could be coming from a wound that didn't exist, how it didn't seem to be bothering the angel as much as he thought it should be doing.
“It’ll be nice having something official to use on documents too, if you want?” There’s only a nod as a response, a soft smile joining the blush on the former angel’s face. “Good. Then it’s settled. September 18th is your birthday.” Dean lets go of Castiel’s hand as he stands, scanning for a marker before finding one on the island in the middle of the kitchen. He turns it over a few times in his hands, turning back to Castiel and holding it out to him.
“I’d better go see what I can do to calm him down a bit - I don’t want him ruining today for you.” She paused in the doorway, turning back to give Dean another soft smile. “And Dean?”
"I am not avoiding your question, Dean. I apologise that it was not answered to your satisfaction, but I am trying to fix you!"
Dean only places a finger on his lips as an answer, Castiel cocking his head in confusion.
“Hey… Hey, hey, hey.. I got you, she’s gone…” Castiel only whined again, moving further in to Dean’s chest as the tremors began to subside. “I’m not gonna make you go back either, okay? I promise, Cas, you’re not going anywhere.” Dean moves away, looking Castiel in the eye as the first cold drop of rain begins to fall. It isn’t long before they’re falling thick and fast, Dean all but dragging Castiel under the trees to save them from getting any more saturated when he stubbornly refuses to move. The tremors at least now are from being cold rather than fear, the odd shake from terror creeping through as Dean shakes off how strange it should be that he can feel the difference. He doesn’t stop his hands through Castiel’s fur as they wait for the rain to at least ease off enough to make a mad dash back to the parking lot, to Dean’s baby and back to the safety of home. Dean presses his face into Castiel’s wet fur, still murmuring reassuring things as he looks up, almost willing the rain to stop.
"Why do you need my help?"
“Cas, what-”
“... Son of a bitch, ow…” Both Sam and Castiel breathed a sigh of relief as Dean moved to a sitting position, rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hands. “Shit, that hurts.”
“Jus- Five.” Dean holds his hand up as an indication to give him five minutes to try and get his breath back, his head connecting with the trunk of the tree with a dull thud, eyes closed. Castiel nudges his other arm away from his side as he squirms in to the space, resting his head against Dean’s chest to keep track of the man’s heart rate.
“Are you okay, Dean? You have been in there a while.” Even though Castiel's voice was muffled, the concern still carried through clearly. Dean shuffled, flushing the toilet that he hadn't used and opened the door, smile on his face.
“Ohhh… That kind of run. I almost thought you’d lost your mind for a second there.” The teasing tone to Dean’s voice had Castiel blushing again, luckily hidden as Castiel washed out the mug and set it on the rack to dry.
“If something's changed, do you not think it's a good idea to try and figure out why and what first, rather than just charging in, guns blazing?” Castiel turned to Sam, putting the warehouse behind him, and sighed. His shoulders slumped as he realised that Sam was right, going in without knowing what was setting the hair of the back of his neck on edge would only endanger Dean further, and that was the last thing Castiel wanted to do. Sam noticed the defeat on the angel's face and released his arm, moving back to lean on the hood of the Impala as he tried to gather himself again.
“Uh, Cas…? What are you doing?”
"Dude… How did you do that?" Dean looked back and forth between the mortar and Castiel again. "You've… All… They… What?" Castiel shrugged as best he could, turning back towards the other room as Dean gaped wordlessly at the island. He moved to the rug that was in front of the fireplace, settling down as Dean worked his way out of his stupor, the soft grind of the pestle against the mortar lulling Castiel slowly in to a gentle sleep. The brief thought of
“You're important to me too, Dean.” With that, any space that was left between the two vanished, wing tips touching and intensifying the electricity, causing both men to drop their hands to their sides and moan at the contact. Dean brought his hand up to cup Castiel's cheek, and Castiel did the same before removing that space between them. The kiss was soft, both exploring each other for the first time with no sense of urgency until their wings pressed more against each other, breaking the kiss with another breathy moan. Dean smiled as he pressed his forehead against Castiel's, a small chuckle escaping him.
” Castiel grips tighter, the request dying in Dean’s throat as he picks up the pace.
“My apologies, Dean. I think I may have found the way to go, if that’s of any help to you?” Castiel points down the corridor, Dean realising the sound of fire crackling coming from the direction he had pointed. Sam rolls his eyes, moving past the pair of them with his gun drawn, hammer pulled back and ready to shoot should any witches try to pull anything on them now. They’ve been in the warehouse barely half the night, patience for their trickery well and truly spent now, itching to get the job finished. Dean’s eyes glow with grace again as he realises they’re close to being free, muttering about
“No, no… That’d be worse.”
“Why don’t you do it? First official birthday is quite a big occasion after all.”
"Being Michael's true vessel must have some effect on how your wings work, and how they interact with others." Castiel's face lit up after this, the aftershock of their wing contact distracting him from any other rational thought. Dean looked puzzled, waving his hand in front of Castiel's face to try and get a response but there was nothing. He tried for a couple more minutes before giving up and poking his wing, the electricity feeling passing between them again. This jolted Castiel out of the dream-like trance he seemed to have gone in to, resulting in him looking at the space between his feet again, wishing the floor would swallow him whole.
"I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. That-" Dean pointed towards the broken mug. "That was an accident. It's my fault for leaving it so close to the edge of the counter. I'm not gonna hurt you cause it broke." Castiel hesitantly opened his eyes, following Dean's arm to the mug. He whimpered again, looking away from it and briefly up in to forgiving green eyes.
"Cas?" Dean stared up at Castiel with wide eyes, drawing him out of the memories of the first day and night of Dean being a fledgling, and Castiel automatically picked him up.
It wasn’t unusual to find Dean watching television in his room - reruns of Scooby-Doo were a frequent occurrence when they had down time between hunts - but the sight of him doing so in the nude briefly short circuited Castiel’s brain before an idea wiggled it’s way into his head.
“Why would we do that? If he dies, we get to keep you for revenge and all your pretty feathers - that sounds much more appealing to us. If he lives… There’s no incentive for us there really, angel.” Dean glowers over the flames, grip on his blade tightening as he moves to step forward, Castiel’s hand on his shoulder stopping him before he can do anything too reckless.
back, are we clear?” Dean shifts, brow set as he looks her straight in the eye.
Even in his head, Castiel’s voice is small. His heart picks up pace again as he realises he has no way of knowing if Dean is alive, much less whether he’s okay or not. There’s no movement from his chest, no movement in his fur as Castiel presses his face in to Dean’s to try and feel for breath. He whines, pawing at the Empath’s chest in an attempt to get any sort of reaction from him, whining again when nothing happens.
“... Stuff?”
“But-”
messed up. Shit…”
"I dunno… One hell of a busted ankle, something's up with their ribs but I won't know if they're broken or just bruised until they wake up. Wait…" Hands brushed over a small area of his head before freezing. "Dude, some of the fur on their head is fucking
“Jesus, Cas!
“Hopefully not too long. Your wings are already acting on instinct alone most of the time, it’s getting them to listen to what you want them to do now instead.”
“Stuff. But it’s important stuff, and…” Dean sighs, dragging his hand down his face. “And I don’t think here’s the best place to talk about it. I
"Cas... What's wrong, Cas?"
” He groaned again as he looked down at the offending book, glaring at it before looking to the spot Castiel had been seconds ago.
“What the hell do you want with me?” The words were spat out, vision clearing fully now as he looked around for the source of the voice. He tried to lean forward to get a better look, shooting back as the nails dug deeper in to his wings, gasping at the pain.
“Yes.”
Castiel slowly came too, muscles he didn't even realise he had aching. He tried to move but pain racked his body, stiffening again as a voice he didn't recognise wriggled it's way through his addled brain. It spoke in hushed tones, unaware that Castiel was conscious.
“No. Absolutely not. 100% no. We are not splitting up.”
“I can try, right?”
“That was an accident, I promise! I’m sorry!”
"They should not be... This colour... They were damaged rescuing you from Hell, now other angels scorn them for what they went through." Dean absentmindedly ran his hand over the feathers he could reach, trying to manipulate the grace he had to let Castiel know what he thought of them.
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t I?” Dean shrugs as he says it, walking past Sam and towards the driver’s side of the Impala, stopping just before he can open the door. “Ah, shit.” Sam sniggers as he realises why Dean stopped, ignoring the glare being thrown his way.
“Wh-”
“Yeah, it’s jus- Wow.” Castiel beamed, wings briefly flaring out before settling back into the rhythm that was keeping them steady.
“Once or twice.” Dean turns to Castiel, a genuine smile on his face and shrugs. “They’re easy to do and always go down a treat whenever I actually make them.” He turns away again, pulling buns from a cupboard that had been left open and dropping them on the side. Castiel just watches as Dean potters about his kitchen, keeping a close eye on the burgers to make sure they don’t burn as he prepares the rest of the meal.
“No, you’re
Castiel rushes forward as Dean collides with the ground, legs collapsing under him as the rest of his weight falls on them, one wing catching the ground with a noise that makes Castiel feel sick. He’s surprised Dean doesn’t cry out, instead watching the hunter go pale as a deep grimace settles on his face.
himself for the angel. He licked his lips, unable to help himself at the way Dean looked so appetising,
“I said I was sorry, right?”
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The anger still simmered through, although not as strong.
as far as everyone's concerned." Dean huffed, looking back at Castiel. "Well, I guess if I can talk to you now, you can finally tell me what you are?" He put his head in his hands, jokingly fluttering his eyelashes as innocently as he could. Castiel snorted, looking away from the ridiculousness of it.
"Uh, funny story..." He nervously rubbed the back of neck, wondering when it'd got so warm and when Castiel's look had gotten so intense. "Okay, not so funny actually. It doesn't matter Cas." Castiel squinted before replying.
“If I hadn't been here, then my grace wouldn't have interfered and given you wings.” Dean shrugged, sliding his hand down to link with Castiel's.
“I mean, yeah… I just still can’t quite wrap my head around it. Could you not have used Jimmy’s birthday? Whenever that is.” Castiel gives him a level look, Dean holding his hands up in defence against it.
” Dean tumbled out of the Impala, hand clutched firmly on the top of his head as he leant back against the cool metal, eyes closed to the world around him. The distant sound of waves lapping against wood brought him back to the moment, opening his eyes just enough to notice a small pier on the lake’s surface. He squinted as a figure moved, slowly standing as he tried to make out who or what the figure was. The haze from the sun and reflection from the water made it difficult; Dean unconsciously taking steps forward to get a clearer look. A flash of beige had his heart leaping to his throat, the flash of blue that followed making him freeze in place.
“Hmmm?”
“... So you don’t want me to leave?” Castiel’s voice is small, hands finding their way in to pockets as Dean still holds him, moving one hand to offer reassurance as best he can.
? I…”
“What was that about?”
“No, everything just feels the same. And it feels like nothing. I have no idea which direction will lead us to Dean.” He sighed again, wings settling in to a defeated position on his back. Sam placed a reassuring hand on the angel's shoulder, expression quickly turning to one of alarm as he looked at Castiel's wings.
come across - then it’s gonna work against Loophole lady.”
“You okay, Cas?” Castiel shifted again, unsure of what had suddenly made him uncomfortable.
Sam’s eyes go wide as he notices the angel blade fall in to Dean’s hand, trying to catch his brother as he stalks towards the crackling fire. He’s stopped dead as Castiel steps in front of him, shaking his head.
... I really should stop injuring Dean.
Castiel continued to stare in to the fireplace, the flames doing nothing to quell his sudden nervousness as to what would happen if Naomi found him.
“Thank you, Sam.”
"Dean..."
“I- What?” Castiel blinked, the statement taking him by surprise as Dean laughed again, bringing the mug closer to his chest.
“I did it.” Castiel didn’t expect the hug, Dean’s arms wrapping around him as he stood there wondering what to do.
“You said your grace did something to the spell? Is there any way that grace is still there?” A hopeful look had settled on the hunter's features, the small glimmer had worked its way back into his eyes and his wings perked up.
“Yes, your blades. Angel blades, silly.” Dean laughed, and the witch moved her hand from his face to his throat, cutting the laugh short. “What's so funny, hmmm?”
“I’m sorry.” Castiel was surprised at how small Dean had managed to make his voice, barely catching what had been said, being mildly thankful for his shifted form as the words otherwise would have been lost.
“...Dean?” Castiel cautiously opened the door, looking out to see if he could see Dean anywhere in the parking lot or immediate surrounding area, panic threatening to spill over when he couldn't see the hunter anywhere. “Dean!” Something by his feet caught his eye as the wind picked up slightly, and Castiel looked down. A feather, maybe the length of his forearm had stopped by his feet, and his heart sank. The mottled chocolate, toffee and white feather could only have come from one place that Castiel could think of, and the feeling of electricity that shot up his arm when he picked it up confirmed it. It was one of Dean's. Castiel rushed it back inside, the door slamming behind him as he held on to the feather as though his life depended on it. He paced back and forth, hands running through his hair as he tried to think who could have taken Dean, and so quietly that it hadn't disturbed him. That's when he saw the window, curtains more ajar than when he had been woken earlier. He crept towards it, panic threatening to rise again but swallowed it down as he tried to stay level headed. He had to. For Dean. Something about the sickly green coating on the ledge was screaming at him but the answer was stubbornly just out of reach, moving away the further he got to figuring out why it looked so damn familiar. Then it hit him.
“Sweetheart, I'm no angel.” She gestured with her free hand to the wings spread either side of Dean, before looking back at him.
“Sam...” There was a warning in the angel's voice, warning that Sam ignored.
“I- I… I thought I’d lost you. For good this time.” Dean doesn’t know when his forehead came to rest against Castiel’s, or when his other hand snaked beneath the trenchcoat to pull them closer together, but Castiel isn’t pulling away and Dean can’t find it in himself to either. It feels right after all this time, the way they fit together perfectly; now Dean truly understands what Castiel meant by happiness is just in the being.
"DOG!" Castiel jumped out of the trance he didn't realise he was in, quickly waving his hand over the mess to tidy it up in his panic. He'd deal with the consequences of using his magic without thinking later, rushing out to find where Naomi had shouted from, the book staying firmly in his mind.
He shook his head, clearing out any unnecessary thoughts before lowering himself onto the bed, draping himself over the hunter as he let out an undignified
“Oh! I was doing something about that.” Dean didn’t have chance to blink before two fingers were placed on his forehead, Castiel’s face scrunched up in concentration. He could just about feel skin stitching itself back together, resisting the urge to scratch at the feeling before Castiel pulled his hand away, smiling again.
Castiel flinched, Dean’s expression changing to one of confusion to worry.
"Hey, look who's up!" He shut the door with his shoulder, juggling bags with his own smile on his face. Castiel moved away to give him room to move, following as he went to dump the bags in the kitchen. There were herbs strung up all over the ceiling drying out, easy reach for someone of Dean's height, Castiel could easily describe the atmosphere as cozy. It followed on from the other room smoothly, well-worn fittings yet well loved and well looked after, the same musky smell that was unmistakably Dean. He took in a deep breath, trying to inhale as many smells as he could, Dean turning just as he let the breath out again. He laughed, the sound causing butterflies in Castiel's stomach, smiling as he emptied the bags.
“Think... Think I'm... Gonna...”
“Wait, Cas!” The loss of even just Castiel's voice in his head, the now deafening silence was crushing, solidifying how alone he currently was.
“Thank you.”
“No. It's just out of reach of me figuring it out, like an itch I can't reach to scratch.” He moved in front of Sam, opening the door and cautiously stepping inside. Nothing here immediately screamed out at him at being different either, brows furrowing in confusion as he struggled to work out what was putting him on edge.
“Parents shouldn’t treat their kids like that. Period.”
about the flames being there.” Dean’s brow briefly furrows in confusion before he shrugs, staring at his hands and willing flames in to existence. His eyebrows shoot in to his hairline as a small flame appears, laughing as it builds in intensity until it completely covers his hands.
?" He scrambled up in to a sitting position, ignoring the pain in his ankle as he stared directly at Dean.
“Hey, Cas… Can you smell that?” Confusion crossed both Sam and Castiel’s features as they turned to Dean, wings now in a more relaxed position behind him.
Dean’s hand pauses in Castiel’s fur, gears in his head turning slowly in his confusion.
He wipes away tears again, shoulders still shaking slightly as giggles escape him.
“I think I might. The first time I rode in a car, it was… Confining. Slow. I felt trapped, and nauseous. I have a feeling the same thing happened here, only over a longer period of time because Dean isn’t fully angel.” Dean’s face dropped as he turned to the Impala, running a hand over the paintwork.
A slow, measured breath escapes Dean as he releases the white knuckled grip on Castiel’s fur again, standing as he moves towards the door. He absentmindedly adjusts warding before turning back to the sofa, curiosity and frustration mixed on his face in equal parts.
Naomi screams as the fireball is hurled towards Castiel, closing his eyes as he waits for the impact and the searing heat. The screams continue as she hurls more, screams sounding more confused until she stops, panting as Castiel opens his eyes again.
. The rumble sounded closer now, almost like thunder, yet it sounded too close to the ground. Castiel put it to the back of his mind, trying to get to the next area of forest, back under cover, safe. There was the rumble again, closer still, but he was so close to the forest. So close,
Castiel moved away, trying to hide his face at the same time, stopping as a familiar itch began in his ear. He tilted his head in confusion, trying to shake it loose before stopping again as Dean’s voice filtered through.
Back.” Her features are schooled to neutrality, Dean almost missing the small sneer that crossed her face at having to tell a stranger that Castiel was hers. He shakes his head, making sure not to break eye contact as he looks back at her.
“Thanks, kid.” He nudges Castiel, handing over one of the cups of coffee before the thought of murder crosses his mind any more. “There you go. Told you there’d be a peace offering.”
. It’s not in your nature to let something beat you.” Dean’s wings fluff up at the praise, blush crossing his cheeks as he leans forward to press a chaste kiss to Castiel’s lips before pulling away again.
? Like, actual physical... Wings?” Castiel nodded, pacing back and forth in front of the bed the younger Winchester wasn't sat on.
Castiel stood up, trying his hardest to keep any weight off his injured ankle so Dean could get a proper look at what he meant. It was a strange feeling, having eyes on him the way Dean had, intrigue on his features rather than the disgust that he was used to seeing on Naomi’s face whenever he shifted. If it was possible for humans to have literal heart eyes, that is what Castiel would describe the look as. He shifted, moving his weight on to one of the other paws before settling back down, stretching out the leg with the bad ankle.
Dean lowered himself back in to the grass, hands clasped across his stomach as he watched a cloud drift over, the silence doing nothing to help the way Castiel’s stomach dropped at the lull in conversation.
"Cas... Turn the light off, I'm tryin' to sleep, man..." Dean rolled over in the bottom of the shower, limbs tangling in wings and more than one expletive escaping his lips. "Ow! Son of a bitch!" Castiel laughed, opening the door to allow him more room, and the laughing abruptly stopped.
“So you'd have no problem with me keeping them?” Castiel shook his head, unlinking their hands so he could straighten out a couple of feathers that had moved out of place. Dean moaned at the contact, his chin dropping to his chest, eyes fluttering shut as Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
! I said I was sorry!” Dean laughed, bending over double as he felt the bitch face Sam was wearing boring holes into his back, wiping errant tears from his eyes as he stood back up again. “You’re a jerk, y'know that?”
"I…" The words caught in Dean's throat. The hand that wasn't on Castiel's head was balled in to a fist, held tightly enough that the knuckles were going white from the pressure. He slowly let out a breath, releasing his hand and opening his eyes.
“We can worry about Sam later. Come on.” Castiel ignores the grumbles from the hunter as they approach the Bunker, stepping to one side as Dean fumbles with the key. The hum of the lights is a welcome sound as the door swings open, warm air rushing out to greet them as they step over the threshold. Dean tries not to flinch as the door bangs shut, growling as the movement aggravates his injured wing, turning to glare at the offending item before sighing again.
"Dammit - right." Indecipherable mumbling followed the short statement, than a loud thud. "Son of a bitch!" Castiel sighed and looked to where the thud had originated from, finding Dean tangled in his wings on the floor.
“Yeah, then.”
“Can you stand?” Castiel’s hand is on Dean’s arm, a reassuring weight as he tries to keep his own panic at bay. The hunter nods in response, grasping the angel’s bicep as he lifts himself up; Castiel takes note of the way he favours the side without the injured wing as he gets himself into a standing position.
Dean’s grip on his own hands loosened, yet they remained together as he slowly lifted his gaze to meet Castiel’s.
“Good boy.” With that, the black spots on the edge of his vision overwhelmed him, dragging him back to the realm of unconscious.
It only takes seconds for him to realise his mistake as the ground suddenly rushes up to meet him much quicker than he’d planned.
"Jus' try Cas. Pwease." Castiel looked down at the de-aged Dean, who held nothing but hope in his eyes, and the angel could feel it. He desperately wanted Dean back to normal, but didn't know how far the witch's spell reached. Castiel sighed, again, and gently placed his fingers on Dean's forehead, almost willing his DNA to revert, his molecules to switch back to adult form. He felt something inside Dean pull away when Castiel's grace reached in to help, but Castiel ignored it and tried to find what it was. A tendril of grace brushed past whatever it was, causing a feeling like electricity to pass back up through it and Castiel yelped, almost dropping Dean.
“Hmmm?”
“Cas?” The word sounds far away as Castiel slowly sinks to the floor, head spinning as well as he covers his muzzle with his paws, closing his eyes to try and stop the spinning. “Cas… Whoa… Okay.” Dean’s voice gets closer, followed by the tantalising smell of burger that forces Castiel to open one eye to see where it’s coming from.
“Cas!” This time he stops, letting himself flop to the ground as Dean reappears in his vision; lying down with a thud as he covers his eyes with his arm. “Dammit, I didn’t realise you had
“It’s gonna be like this all day, isn’t it?”
“I... I love you, Cas. I guess nearly dying and sprouting wings helps a guy realise some stuff, y'know?” The blush had left Dean's face and crossed to Castiel's, who was now also staring at their hands.
“And you want to do this everyday?” Castiel pauses, quickly looking around before resting his head back on Dean’s chest.
“There’s an empty field just on the other side of these - I imagine you’ll feel better there than at the side of the road where people might see us?” Castiel turns his head just enough for Dean to hear as he continues to walk forwards, holding a branch to one side as he motions again for the hunter to hurry up. Dean nods as he jogs to where Castiel is, looking around quickly as he ducks under the angel’s arm, trying his hardest not to catch his wings on any low hanging branches or anything else he can snag himself on. He shudders as he stands upright again, wings extending as far as they’ll go before shaking out any loose leaves that decided they were going to hitch a ride with him. He can feel Castiel’s smile before he turns back to the angel, his own greeting it before taking a deep breath.
"I love you too, Dean." He smiled, then squirmed again, and Castiel knew he wanted to be put down. He tottered away, the small wings allowing him to do so without falling over until he sat down, finding something interesting in the weave of the motel carpet. Castiel watched the whole thing until he knew Dean would not want to be disturbed, and turned to the books that littered the table. He had to find a way to fix what the witch had done, and the memory of that particular hunt was one he wished he could forget...
“Cas…?”
of it... I just don’t know where it all went.”
“... What?” Castiel nods towards Sam, towards his gun, trying to make Dean understand without letting the witches know what’s going on. His eyes widen as he remembers what Sam told him about the bullets, nodding as he squares his shoulders in preparation for whatever Castiel is about to do to cause a distraction. He grabs the angel’s hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze before dropping it back to his side, grip on his blade tightening again.
“I don’t think there’s much further to go now, if that makes you feel better? We’ll probably still be back before Sam.”
“Are you coming, or not?”
“His name is not
Dean put the pestle down before putting his hands on the countertop, sighing as his head dropped to his chest. He let out a small laugh as Castiel looked up at him, confusion rolling off him.
Castiel huffed, moving off the sofa and stretching before standing to look at Dean.
“I’m not gonna be able to stop you from doing that, am I?” The playfulness in Dean’s voice caught Castiel off guard, the softness making his heart flip in his chest. He smiled before looking down at his hands, breath hitching in his throat as Dean took one in his own, the burning feeling of blush rushing across his face.
to stretch and be free - knowing he could disappear and stretch before returning at the exact moment he’d left was something he looked back on fondly. When Dean had got to a point where he could hide his wings, that would be something he’d have to share with the hunter; something else they could do together.
“The day I pulled you from Hell was the day I stopped being Castiel, became Cas… Or at least that was the start of it. The birth of it, if you will. It only seems right that that be my birthday.” Dean’s still gaping at Castiel as he lets his brain catch up to what’s being said, the implications of it whirring around his head as the former angel just shrugs.
“And how long will that take?”
“Might have wings now, but a dude's gotta breathe.” Castiel laughed, resting his forehead against Dean's, both of them slightly out of breath.
“Uh… Cas…? Has this, uh, got anything to do with you?”
Dean groaned again, trying to push at Castiel to move him from lying on him, groaning again as he stubbornly refused to let himself be moved.
“Hey, what’s up? What’s with the guilt just rolling off you?”
Dean hesitated, briefly glancing at the gaps in his wings before sighing.
“Oh dear… That’ll teach the stupid boy to stand behind doors, won’t it?” Castiel whips around, teeth bared and growling as he sees Naomi stepping over the threshold. The warding that Dean had spent so long getting in place and perfect briefly glows before bursting in to flames, rendering it now useless; Naomi looks unfazed as she picks a splinter from her shoulder and flicks it in to the room.
"No, Dean. We are trying to fix you, not make you more of an angel." He pouted and started to squirm, but Castiel held tighter and moved his own wings to try and distract him. Dean watched more intently as they moved, and craned his neck to get a better look as they wrapped around him. He slowly extended a hand to them, looking back at Castiel before touching them for approval to do so, and the older angel nodded. A small jolt similar to the feeling of electricity passed up Dean's arm as it connected with Castiel's feathers, and up Castiel's wing causing him to retract it just out of Dean's reach. He looked up at the older angel with wide eyes, confusion and wonder etched onto his face at the same time.
is out of the way… Shall we?” Castiel only bares his teeth again as he continues to growl, moving to stand over Dean as she steps further in to the room. “I said move,
"CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS!" The ear piercing wail broke through the silence as cleanly as a knife through butter, and Castiel flinched as it reached his ears. "CAAAAAAAASS!" He sighed, the noise bringing himself out of his thoughts and he stood up, stretching before he met the source of the wail. Turning, Castiel saw the small fledgling trying its hardest to get out of the playpen that he had made appear to accommodate it, annoyance plastered all over its face.
." The hands on Castiel's head tensed before reluctantly letting go. They stood, knees popping as they started to walk away, Castiel quietly letting go of the breath he had been holding.
“You’ve got enough time to figure it out, I suppose.” Bobby put his bottle on the deck before turning to Dean, a hint of mischief twinkling in his eyes. “Wouldn’t stay too long though. Got it on good authority there’s someone waitin’ for you out there.”
He can’t remember the last time he felt this unburdened, the last time he felt so…
It was dark when Dean came to, the warm caress of Castiel's hand in his wing long since stopped. The display on the crappy bedside radio read a little after 3AM, the neon of the vacancy sign creeping through the small gap in the curtains and illuminating the sleeping form of Castiel next to him. Dean smiled, wings puffing up slightly as he gently ran a hand down the side of the sleeping angel's face. He stirred slightly, leaning more in to the touch as Dean smiled more.
Castiel flinched again as Dean knelt down, not looking him in the eye, trying to make himself as small as possible. He wanted to move further away, every instinct screaming at him to run again, yet there was something keeping him rooted to the spot against the cabinets. Dean let out a sigh, slowly reaching a hand out, lowering it just as slowly on to Castiel's head. He didn't say anything as he flinched again, trembling under the touch, eyes firmly closed.
“If she thinks she’s gonna take you without any resistance, she’s wrong.” Castiel titled his head the other way, confusion radiating off him. “I know what every single one of these herbs does, every good thing… And every bad. I might not be able to shoot lightning from my hands or make shit float, but I know how to use these to protect us. If there’s even a
as it flies past his head, colliding with a different wall. He growls as he peers over, quickly glancing between where Dean is lay and where Naomi stands, trying to work out if there’s any way he can lead her away from the only person who has ever given him the chance to just
“Anyway. Now that
“Shh...” Dean felt his throat tighten, words getting trapped behind the barrier that had been put in place, even noise to express his discomfort was having difficulty passing. “There, there... It's okay.” The witch patted Dean's cheek condescendingly before moving back to his wing, ignoring the small noises of protest he was able to make. She drew the tip of the blade along the spine of her favoured feather, stopping where it joined the rest of his wing before turning back to Dean with a malicious smile on her face. He shook his head, mouthing 'no', eyes screwed shut so he couldn't see what she was about to do. There was no warning before she sliced the feather from his wing, grace escaping from the wound, Dean crying out soundlessly as the pain rippled up to his shoulder. A low groan managed to work its way out from the barrier that had been placed on him as the pain subsided in to a throbbing sensation, but the groan was drowned out by the sound of laughter.
“Ho- Holy... Crap, Cas!” He felt the smile around his nipple as he gently bit it, causing Dean to buck up. “Where did you learn that?” Castiel sat up, kissing the hunter before pulling away.
“Sure.” Castiel took a deep breath, cracking his knuckles before gently placing his hand over the brand.
“... Does Sam know you’re bonded yet?”
“Oh no you don't.” He relaxed again, wings returning to the settled position behind him, shaking his head again at his new reality. This was definitely going to be a bitch to explain to Sam, trying to explain why they were still there, why Dean didn't want to get rid of them.
“They are beautiful, Dean. They match you perfectly.” Dean blushed, turning away from the angel. “I mean it. Every angel had their wings created to match their unique personalities – yours apparently seem to be no exception. Beautiful, but there's no mistaking the strength there.” He lifted the hunter's chin up, placing a chaste kiss on his lips. The blush on Dean's cheeks had only intensified, making its way to his ears.
- Dean knows logically that he’s had millennia to perfect it, but it still gets under his skin that it really isn’t as easy as it looks. He’s also thankful that Sam isn’t around either, knowing full well he’d never hear the end of it if he was to see just how difficult Dean was making it out to be.
“Mostly?”
“Easier said than done… This
“But nothing, Dean Winchester. I’m alive, that’s the thing to focus on. Understood?” Dean nodded, and Castiel smiled as he slowly lowered his hand from the Empath’s face. “Good. Now, I’m gonna go tidy up a bit - you good in here?” Castiel watched Dean’s Adam’s apple as he gulped, slowly bringing his eyes upwards as Dean nodded again.
“You any idea where abouts you want to go to run?” The words catch Castiel off guard, dropping the spatula in surprise.
“Y’know what Cas? I think I will.”
“I don’t think so, pretty boy. You’re going to stay right where you are.” She leaned closer to him again, her breath hot on his cheek. “And we’re going to take every last part of you we can use, sweetheart.” She span away, cackling as anger burnt bright throughout Dean. He could feel the grace burning hot inside him, working its way through every nerve in his body, almost feeling like he could explode. The witch had stopped cackling, looking at where Dean was pinned with concern on her face, taking a cautious step backwards to the door she must have crept in from. She took another step backwards, hitting the door, trying to subtly open it before he noticed what she was doing, freezing when he snapped his focus to her.
“You’re not upset?”
“... Are you ever gonna let that go?” Castiel shrugged, the grin already on his face getting wider as he nudged Dean again.
“You’re really gonna make me do this, aren’t you?”
“What? What's going on?”
“Make me, jerk.” Castiel catches the way Dean’s jaw clenches, the feel and smell of ozone hitting his nostrils just as his eyes get the slightest glimmer of grace in them.
“Yeah?”
“Would you like more?”
“Maybe it's better if you lay down? You're less likely to fall off the bed that way.” The smile had reached Castiel's eyes, making the blue sparkle and Dean made a mental note to try and recreate that as often as he possibly could. Dean could feel the blush creeping back on to his face and he nodded, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment. He scooted up the bed so his head was comfortably on the pillows and stretched his wings out so they draped over the edges of the bed. He closed his eyes and waited for the dip in the mattress that signalled Castiel had settled in a position where he could reach comfortably. He didn't expect the warm weight to settle at the top of his legs, straddling him, and he opened one eye in curiosity. The trenchcoat and suit jacket had been discarded over the back of a chair, and Castiel was focused on rolling his second shirt sleeve up. Dean swallowed at the sight, the movement of his Adam's apple catching Castiel's eye.
Dean had lost count of how many miles he’d travelled, how often the scenery had changed around him as he pushed onwards. The only saving grace he had found was that at least he hadn’t needed to stop for fuel; being pulled towards a still unknown destination that had his heart fluttering whenever he stopped to think about it for too long. He didn’t know why he was nervous, fingers dancing across the steering wheel as he took deep breaths to try and calm himself down. He hadn’t realised he’d stopped driving either as he came to rest his head between his hands, catching the horn and jumping as the noise took him by surprise, cursing as his head connected with the roof of the Impala.
Castiel smiles again before taking a deep breath, closing his eyes as he closes the small gap between the two of them; Dean’s lips are warm and pliant under his own, the warm feeling of home crashing over him as Dean smiles against him. The warmth of Dean’s hand against his face pulling him closer kicks his brain in to another gear, swallowing down nerves as he lets himself explore more of Dean’s mouth - the happy noise that comes from the Empath only spurs him on further. Castiel returns the smile against Dean before pulling away, resting their noses together as a soft laugh works his way from him, making Dean’s smile even bigger. He shudders as he lets out a breath, opening his eyes to find a soft look on the Empath’s face that makes his heart melt.
"No - the grace that lets you have wings will stop you getting an 'ouch'." Big eyes were turned to him again, and he saved Dean the bother of asking. The air around Castiel's shoulder seemed to melt as his wings were brought into vision, and a lamp suffered as a wing crashed into it. Dean looked at Castiel, then to the broken lamp and back again, eyes wide in amazement before breaking down into giggles at the carelessness of the older angel.
. He shook his head, clearing out the ifs and the buts to focus on getting to the centre of the warehouse, to killing the remainder of the coven. Sam could at least tell that Dean had the same idea there - regardless of the wings, his shoulders still squared the same once he’d set his mind to it, still had the same almost march towards his goal. The wings just added something else to the image, made him look more intimidating with the way he seemed to stand taller, as if he was more confident that people were going to listen to every little word he said. It was those same wings Sam smacked in to as Dean stopped, Castiel ahead with eyes closed and head tilted.
“No idea. Just starting feelin’ sick, and really didn’t fancy throwing up in the car.” He takes another deep lungful of air, opening his eyes to Sam’s concerned face. “What?”
The maze of corridors seemed to have got thicker in the brief period of time since rescuing Dean, more twists, turns and dead-ends than either Sam or Castiel could remember there being. It frustrated Dean, not knowing if the next corridor was going to be the one to lead them to the exit or not, to freedom and away from this damn coven. The next dead-end had his wings flaring out, growling and turning to punch the nearest wall.
“Can you not just heal it?” Castiel sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose with his other hand.
“No, nothing, all good, all fine.” He gave a thumbs up, quickly looking to the rafters rather than witnessing any more flirting between the two.
“Take all the time you need, Dean. I’m not going anywhere, promise.” Castiel doesn’t realise what he’s doing until he’s done it, pressing a chaste kiss to Dean’s cheek before turning his attention back to the stovetop, feeling Dean’s response through the bond as he feels his own cheeks heat up from his own blush. He can’t help the smile at the spluttering noises that manage to escape the Empath, suppressing a giggle as the thoughts he receives flounder in his head.
“What d’you say to getting home and carrying this on, hmm?” Castiel blushed as he pulled away, a twinkle of mischief in Dean’s eyes as he asked the question.
“You’re a cocky bastard, y’know that?” Castiel huffs, sitting up from Dean’s leg as he looks over towards the fireplace. “If, um… How did you get away from her? The loophole woman?” Brief panic washes over Dean at the mention of her, an involuntary shudder working its way up his spine. Something about the way Castiel feels about the woman makes his skin crawl, scratching at his arm as he shudders again.
“Is that… Did she… Y’know?”
“I know, I jus- I just don’t understand
“Yeah, yeah.”
"'t's oday, Cas. You're magic, you cab mend it."
“Hmmm...” Castiel shifted, adjusting the grip he had on the pillow before settling again, a light snore escaping that signalled to Dean the angel was asleep again. Dean smiled, shaking his head before standing. He stretched, shoulders popping and wings extending, almost brushing the curtains before Dean realised how far out they'd gone.
"Well, what would you have done? You've got more experience hitting dogs with your car than I do." It came closer again, and Castiel felt them kneel by him. He tried his hardest not to tremble as a hand gently came to rest on his fur, keeping his eyes firmly shut so they would think he was asleep.
“Don’t antagonise your brother while he’s still getting to grips with his grace. He could very well smite you, even if that’s the furthest thing from him wanting to do.” Sam’s eyebrows somehow end up closer to his hairline, casting a quick glance back at Dean, a smirk on his face at the information. “It’s not uncommon in fledglings when they first find their grace to have no control over it and do catastrophic things by accident.” Colour drains from Sam’s face as he stares at the steering wheel, nodding once before starting the Impala and slowly pulling away from the motel. Castiel offers Dean a small smile before turning his attention back out the windshield, closing his eyes as the rumble of the engine lulls him into a meditative state.
“I get it. But you have got to stop feeling guilty about acting on instinct - that shit isn’t healthy.” Castiel blinks again, licking his lips as he tries his hardest not to look anywhere but Dean. “It’s there for a reason, and feeling guilty about it is only gonna confuse you when you need to listen to it the most.”
“Exactly. Like learning how to land properly. And there’s a whole load of stuff I probably can’t even
“... Thanks.” He shook his head again as the door creaked open, settling in as the rumble of the Impala calmed any sudden nervousness he was feeling. “Okay Baby… Let’s go, shall we?” Dean gave Bobby a small wave as he pulled away, letting instinct take over with no set destination in mind. The open road called him, pulling him away from the Roadhouse and towards whatever lay in store for him.
, but still…” Dean shrugged, draining his mug again before putting it on the counter with a content sigh. “C’mon. Breakfast. Then you can go run like a weirdo.” Dean smiled again, moving towards the stove as Castiel stayed frozen in place. He wasn’t often without words, but the way Dean was teasing him about the
“Dean, I need you to try and keep still.”
. There’s no malicious intent behind the way the grace explores his wing, probing in various places as it tries to find the source of the pain without aggravating it further. It moves smoothly over bone, inspecting every inch it can before pulling back to inspect muscles and tendons; the same level of care never wavering. It hesitates briefly as Dean’s breath hitches, pausing as Castiel notices the way the hunter’s jaw is set against the pain.
"Just be glad I didn't make the poultice as well. That stuff
Castiel sat up, looking anywhere but back to Dean’s face, intently watching the way a leaf slowly drifted to the ground in a vain attempt to keep the nerves he was suddenly feeling at bay.
“... Hold up – we?”
“No, I- I got it.” It slips easily over Dean’s head, settling squarely above his heart. He’s sure he hears Castiel’s breath hitch in his throat as it settles, eyes watering slightly at the way it looks perfect around the hunter’s neck.
“They look weirdly familiar… Why can’t I put my finger on it?” Dean stands, hoping the higher angle gives him more answers as he scratches the back of his head. “I mean, yeah, I can feel that they’re definitely new, but there’s something about them that is just screaming familiar at me.” He shrugs, pulling Castiel closer again as they gently sway with the breeze. Castiel laughs as Dean spins him, ignoring looks from other people who have since entered the park as he lets himself be pulled closer again to the Empath.
“You can do it again if you like.”
“Dean... I think we’re bonded.” Castiel isn’t sure how it’s possible, but he’s sure Dean’s eyebrows are higher now than before. The flames have gone out too now there’s no attention on them, leaving Dean standing slack-jawed in the middle of the room, hands still cupped.
“We'll figure this out Dean. If my grace changed the spell so this happened, maybe the answer lies there.” The small glimmer that had appeared in Dean's eyes earlier had all but faded now, replaced with determination, and Castiel knew that he was now committed to finding a solution to the feathery problem.
“How long d’you think it’ll take to heal?”
“Great! Well, not great ‘cause you’ve not eaten, but… I’ll whip you up some burgers, yeah? Everyone loves burgers.” He pulls his head back before Castiel can say anything else, the smell of garlic and onion slowly beginning to fill the living space. His stomach rumbles again, involuntarily licking his lips as the smell of the patties joins the orchestra of other smells, and Castiel is fairly certain that this is what heaven smells like. He drifts to the doorway of the kitchen, watching as Dean gracefully flips the burgers in the pan, not watching where the patties go before catching them expertly again.
Sam rushes forwards, pulling both his brother and the angel away from the fire, the flames rising higher as the witches scream in fury. “That fire is made with holy oil. And you’re both so intent on clearing out this coven that you didn’t even notice.” Dean blinks, the grace disappearing from his eyes as he realises what it is Sam’s getting at, Castiel’s wings moving behind him so they’re further away from the fire.
“Okay… You said it was gonna be easier to show me than try and explain how to fly… How do we go about that?” Castiel shuddered, letting his wings melt into view as Dean’s eyes grew wide. “You have
“Hmm… That would be acceptable.” Castiel sighs, resigning himself to the fact that he was now awake before moving, lying on his front as he looks up at Dean from his position on his chest. He brushes his hand along Dean’s cheekbone, feeling the warmth from the hunter’s blush before it’s pulled away; Dean pressing a soft kiss to his palm before linking their fingers together.
“It can’t be. There’s all the corridors an-” Dean steps away from Castiel, closer to Sam, trying to get a better look at the door. “Son of a bitch! There never were any corridors, or any other rooms really, was there?”
“... You know.... You never did tell me what you were.” The inquisitive look had settled on Dean’s face again, looking as though Castiel held the answers to the universe. He tilted his head, waiting for some sort of response, sighing when nothing came forwards.
“Hungry?” The gurgle from Castiel’s stomach answers for him, making Dean laugh again. “Guess so. How long is it since you ate last anyway? Must be what - 2 or 3 days by now?”
The blush settles at the top of Dean’s ears again at the compliment, Castiel huffing in amusement at how easy it is to fluster him.
“I can manage that. Now come on - I’ve got work to do.”
“Don- Don’t stop.” Dean’s words come out shakily, barely audible as he shifts his own hips to try and recreate the friction that Castiel is now withholding from him. “Please Cas.
"What was dat Cas?" Confusion worked its way onto Castiel's face to almost mirror Dean's.
-------------------------------------------------------------
"Dean, how did this happen?" Dean shrugged his shoulders, causing the new appendages to give him a small amount of lift that greatly reduced the pressure on Castiel's chest.
“Cas, what's going on?”
would do that shit to you… I can’t imagine…” Dean’s hand balls up in Castiel’s fur as his anger flares again, the hug tightening as he tries to put as much reassurance in to it as he can. His voice is quiet when he speaks again, Castiel only just catching the words.
Something on Castiel's side of the connection made Dean's wings quiver again, a small amount of dread working creeping over.
have chosen, why then? What’s so special about that date for you?”
“What the hell even am I now, Cas?” Castiel knelt in front of Dean, copying his earlier action of holding his chin to look at him, his own wings materialised and radiating calm to try and alleviate the panic. It seemed to work as Dean's breathing became more even, wings settling and a resigned sigh escaping him.
"Where are your wings?" With this higher vantage point, Dean began to poke the air blindly just behind Castiel's shoulders, trying to connect with something solid and failing. "I wanna see them Cas, why are they hiding?"
… No, no no no no no…
? Or shout at me here, I don't mind! :)
“Yes, I waited for you. It looks very strange when it seems like there’s a dog running around without an owner there to keep an eye on them.”
“Do you know something about it?”
“My... Your... What?” The hunter began to pace, hands in his hair and wings ruffled in a slightly panicked position. “How? How can I have grace?” He stopped pacing and turned to Castiel, the same panic that his wings showed mirrored in his eyes. He sank in to the nearest chair, head in hands before looking back up at the angel.
“And I was having such a nice day…”
“Um.” Castiel mirrored Dean’s earlier action as he rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment, trying to avoid eye contact. “It was an accident.”
At some point during the evening, Castiel had stopped kissing Dean long enough to sit on the bed, a small, happy smile just noticeable on his face as Dean sat beside him, his head leant on the angel's shoulder. Dean had looped his arm through Castiel's and linked their fingers together, absent-mindedly tracing patterns into his skin with his thumb, letting himself become immersed in the happiness he was feeling. Their thighs were pressed together, and Castiel had draped one of his wings around the hunter, almost cocooning them from the outside world.
crossed his mind, surprising him as sleep claimed him once more.
... This was definitely not how Sam had imagined the evening to go.
“Pass me the-”
- and leans against the sofa, but it quickly switches back to curiosity again.
“That all depends on where the injury is, and how severe. If it’s just a sprain, it could be as little as two weeks. Anything more than that… Longer.” Dean sighs, dropping his head to the table he’s sat at with a thud. Castiel ignores it, stepping to the hunter’s side to gain easier access to the top of his wing, eyebrow raised as he silently asks permission to touch.
“I can help with that, if you’ll let me?” Dean stilled at Castiel’s voice, turning his head slowly to look at the source. His eyes widened as he took in the image in front of him, wonder etched on to his features.
“What- Cas, what are you doing?”
“You’re cute when you’re grumpy, y’know that?”
----------------------------------------------
Castiel squinted as he noticed the tension that had settled in Dean's shoulders at the information, how…
------------------------------------------------------------------------
“There is one way you could get back.” Sam shrugs as he says it, Castiel nodding as he works out what the younger Winchester is alluding to.
“I don't care. We've already figured that the spell has worn off, it's just these-” He gestured, trying to point at them. “-don't want to seem to go.” Castiel stood up, walking behind the hunter and looking for approval  before moving his hand over one of his wing joints.
“Would you feel better if you closed your eyes? At least for now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, he can’t have gone far. He came in right behind you, he was
“The poultice! It’s kind of sensitive, if I leave it too long it’ll-” There was a small pop from the island, followed by a plume of black smoke that slowly began to drift towards the floor. “Um… It’ll do that. Shit.” Castiel huffed in amusement, the worry of punishment now long gone from his mind. He looked back up as Dean ran his hands through his hair, the smoke continuing to pour on to the floor, staring at the mortar as he tried to figure out how to get it to stop. He barked, surprising both himself and Dean as the smoke stopped, creeping back up the side of the island as he growled at it. He continued to growl until they both heard a familiar pop, Dean peering in to the mortar and back at Castiel in wonder.
“Dean...!” Dean's release shot out of him, painting both of their chests white, and the feeling of Dean clamping down drew out Castiel's, both sets of wings flaring. He opened his eyes to look at Dean, grace cracking in his eyes and was surprised to find a small amount amongst the green of the hunters eyes too. It quickly faded as both sets of wings relaxed, both men trying to get their breath back. Castiel used his grace to clean up and reposition them so they lay face to face on the bed, hand absent-mindedly coming up to stroke the side of Dean's face. Dean held it there for a moment before kissing his knuckles, almost holding it like his life depended on it. He looked down at their intertwined hands and smiled, a small blush creeping across his face. Castiel tilted his head, confusion flashing across his features.
“That explains why the Bunker’s still standing then.”
“Hmm?”
“Maybe. It is fun to see the way you squirm when it’s brought up… It’s endearing.” Dean huffed, stirring the pot with a little bit more force than usual. “You do also know that I don’t intend it to be malicious? It’s all meant in jest, Dean.”
“Great…” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets with more force than necessary, sighing as he kicks dirt off the path. “Oh, Sam’s gonna absolutely
Sam couldn’t keep the smile off his face as Dean took deep breaths next to the Impala, trying his hardest to keep the panic from bubbling up to the surface. He wasn’t sure if Castiel knew how much his brother absolutely hated flying - in planes at least - but he was curious to see how he’d handle actually being in control of it. He was slightly disappointed that the cooler in the trunk was empty, in half a mind to pull it out and get himself comfortable to watch Dean try and follow Castiel’s instructions.
” Castiel nods, releasing the grip on Dean’s wrists for a moment before moving them, adjusting their position so he can keep the hunter where he is with just one hand. His spare hand drifts down Dean’s side, his touch feather light as he listens for the way his breath hitches and moans the further to his waist he gets. He lifts up slightly, enough for his hand to work its way underneath the hunter and gently grip him before settling his weight back on top, rolling his hips one more time as Dean gasps at multiple sensations.
“Dude, I'm not an angel. And I don't care if being Michael's vessel or whatever helps them. I'm still me, and these aren't supposed to be here.” The wings on Dean's back untangled themselves from Castiel's, setting in a defensive position that Castiel knew meant he was uncomfortable with not knowing what to do in this situation.
gonna take?” There was almost a look of pleading on Dean’s face as he met Castiel’s gaze properly, colour still not coming back as Castiel returned the look with sympathy. “I… I don’t know if I can do this, Cas. I…”
“How long d’you think this is gonna take?” Dean’s voice was weak as he glanced at Castiel, face paler than Sam had seen it for quite some time. Some of the glee drained from him as he watched Dean swallow thickly - no doubt trying to stop himself from vomiting all over the side of the road again - as it was replaced with concern. Castiel gently clasped his hand, giving it a soft squeeze as his other hand came to rest on his shoulder, an equally soft smile on his face.
"You know, helping me would be a lot better than just standing there..."
“Hey, you o-” Castiel held his hand up to get Sam to be quiet, the words abruptly cutting off. He tilted his head as he tried to focus on the whispering that had started up, trying to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from, to try and hear it more clearly.
“Usually, yeah.”
“What?”
“I can feel
"Dean! Dean!" Castiel banged on the bathroom door, but his cries were muffled by Dean's screams which abruptly stopped. The silence was unnerving and seemed to last forever until a sad whimper broke it. Castiel leaned closer to the door, trying to determine what could make a noise like that when it happened again, accompanied by the sound of sniffling.
” The words are all but sobbed out, the neediness and pleading in Dean’s voice something Castiel won’t forget in a hurry.
His eyes stay closed as he feels Castiel’s head lift off his legs, a small grunt escaping as he rests it on his chest instead.
“You seem distracted.” Dean doesn’t notice that they’ve stopped straight away, only as Castiel straightens himself up does he notice that neither of them are moving. “Are you alright?”
“You okay?” Dean’s voice was shaky, the smile he’d managed to return equally so.
A small blue flame sparked to life in her open hand, lazily rolling it through her fingers, Castiel's gaze glued firmly to it. The smell of singed fur invaded his nostrils as the memory of last time came back, quickly getting to his feet before he could upset her further.
“... No.”
"I expect everything cleaned up in the next hour. You
“You could always just, oh, I dunno,
“You're more than family Cas. You're like a brother to me, to Sam.” Castiel's wings puffed up at the praise, sparking something within the hunter. “Hell, you're more than a brother, Cas. You're important to me.” Some time during the conversation Dean had stood up from the chair, removing any personal space that was between the two of them. Dean's hand still circled Castiel's wrist as his wings opened as far as they could within the confines of the motel room, closely followed by Castiel's. Both sets of wings were tantalisingly close to touching, less than a hair's breadth apart, small sparks of electricity passing between them creating an even more electric atmosphere than Dean had already created. Castiel's free hand came up to cup Dean's face, who leaned in to the touch, eyes never leaving the angel's.
“You… You did it?”
“Hmm?”
“... Fine, whatever. Have fun with your flying lesson.”
“Sam…?”
“Home sounds good. Home sounds really good, Dean.” His head doesn’t stay there long as he pulls away, pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s cheek before a shit eating grin works its way on to his face. Confusion flashes across Dean’s face as Castiel scans the immediate area, his grin getting wider before the confused look turns to one of realisation.
It was going to be a long evening.
“Ow.” Castiel let out another breath, sitting back as Dean stiffly moved in to a sitting position to match him, both hands coming to rub at his eyes before gingerly feeling the wound on his head. He hissed as he made contact, pulling his hand away to see if it was still bleeding or not.
"Dean, can you hear me? Dean!" The Hunter was lay on his back, unmoving, and Castiel could only just feel the life force keeping him alive. It was times like this that he was thankful for the profound bond they shared, but it now scared him as he knew Dean was perilously close to death. He lifted Dean into his arms and flew them back to the motel room, the Impala parked where she had been before they set off, and Castiel set about trying to fix whatever damage the witch had done. He gingerly placed two fingers to Dean's forehead, trying to assess whatever damage had been done, but Castiel couldn't feel anything. He sighed, sitting back on the bed that Dean was lay on and watched, waiting for any sign of consciousness that was welcome to make an appearance any time now. He waited for a couple of minutes, looking for any changes in any part of Dean that would let him know he was near waking up, but nothing happened and he moved to one of the chairs in the motel room, letting his mind wander whilst keeping an eye on Dean.
“So… Which way is out again?”
“You’ll get used to it eventually. And I’m not gonna take it away ‘cause I’m not going anywhere.”
“What? How?”
“Air. I need…” He swallows, putting a hand over his mouth as he waves frantically at the door with his other. Sam’s eyes go wide as he flings his door open, wrenching the rear door open just in time for Dean to drag himself out and promptly vomit on the side of the road. Sam steps back just in time to avoid his shoes getting splattered, unable to keep the disgusted look off his face at his brother emptying his stomach just inches away. Castiel joins him, lending a hand to Dean as he pulls the rest of himself out of the Impala, careful to avoid standing in his own mess as he lets a full body shiver work its way over him. He sighs as he stands, stretching his arms above his head and letting his wings out as far as they’ll go before bringing them back to a relaxed position behind him, taking in great lungfuls of air.
“Yes.” Sam reeled at the abruptness of the answer, and Castiel took the moment of shock to grab Dean's feather back off the younger Winchester, slipping in to one of the internal pockets of his trenchcoat as he made his way to the door. Sam still stood, shocked as Castiel turned back to him.
“Sam? Sam!” Castiel opened the door again, impatient to know what had the younger Winchester concerned. “Sam, what’s going on?” He threw the most appropriate bitch-face at the angel as his head poked around the door, Sam blocking any view further in to the room. Castiel looked down to see the corpse blocking the door, a look of understanding on his face as he stepped back to let Sam move it before trying to open the door again. It swung open freely a few seconds later, the younger Winchester crouched by another figure in the room, wings splayed on either side of them.
“You are still Dean Winchester, still the Righteous Man, still the brightest and purest soul I have ever been fortunate enough to lay eyes on. You are still you, and a good man at that.” Castiel removed his hand from Dean's chin and placed it on his knee to help himself stand. He moved to turn away but was stopped by Dean's hand on his wrist, pulling him back to where Dean sat.
“Your birthday, I’ll let you take the reins there.” Dean motions to the doorframe, to the rest of the bunker. He doesn’t know exactly where everyone else is, or if they’re even awake yet, but he can’t find it in himself to knock Castiel’s happiness.
“I'm always careful, it'll be fine. Scout's honour.” The confidence didn't quite work its way in to his voice as much as he wanted it to, and he mentally cursed himself for it. “Be careful yourself too. I... I don't want to lose you, Cas.”
"My grace changed the spell that the witch cast on you, changed you into a fledgling rather than just a child. I do not know why, now the spell has reversed, the reason for you still having wings." Dean huffed, his wings moving with his back and Castiel followed their movement intently.
---------------------------------------
Dean nodded again, as though he was mentally taking notes of everything Castiel was saying, as though he was committing them to memory. The concentration on his face as he thought of more questions made Castiel laugh to himself again as Dean slowly moved away from the sofa.
He began pacing; mind racing back and forth between wanting to stay where he was safe and feeling like he had to go back, if just to keep the punishment as minimal as possible.
“Cas!” He let out a sigh of relief he hadn't realised he was holding. “Oh, thank God that worked.”
"I..." The answer clicked before Dean could get the rest of the sentence out, and Castiel moved so he could reach the join on the hunter's back. He slowly raised his arm towards the left wing, looking at Dean for confirmation that he could touch, and gently placed his hand where the problem seemed to be. He gently scratched the area, making Dean produce a low moan as he dipped his head as a sign to let Castiel continue. Castiel didn't acknowledge the moan, too wrapped up in how soft the hunter's wings were - they reminded him of a fledgling's wings in colder months when they left heaven. He hadn't realised that he'd started to stroke along the bone until he could no longer reach from the position he was in and abruptly stepped back, clearing his throat.
“I… I just don’t want to run the risk of ever losing you, in any sense.”
“Happy Birthday.” Jack stands as Eileen leaves, brushing specks from his jeans as he does so, beaming at Dean again.
“... Did I do that?”
“Cas?” Moments of silence passed before a whine answered Dean, breathing out a sigh of relief as paws appeared on the back of the sofa, closely followed by Castiel’s head and shoulders.
"Stop staring at my junk."
He blinks as Dean’s hand rests in his fur, deep breaths becoming shallower as his heart rate begins to come down. A breathless laugh escapes as Dean ruffles the fur on Castiel’s head again, opening his eyes but keeping his head rested against the tree trunk.
"The witch! Her spell... My grace changed it, instead of just de-aging you, it gave you wings, turned you into a fledgling..." Castiel's voice trailed off towards the end of the explanation, stopping pacing after realising he'd started. Dean just followed the movements with his eyes, falling back onto the bed that the older angel had vacated whilst staring intently.
“How?”
“Shit, I am so sorry. I didn’t think… Shit, shit, shit.” He straightened up as Castiel growled again, electing to give him space. “I’m, um… I’m gonna go over here, and try make something that’s gonna help with that pain, I think. Yeah. Help with the pain.” Castiel watched him as he retreated in to a different room, leaving him alone for the first time since escaping Naomi. He sighed, slowly moving into a sitting position to get a better look of his surroundings. It was a modest space, comfortably decorated but well lived in. The furniture bordered between well-worn and threadbare, throws and blankets hiding what Castiel assumed were the worst patches, where the most wear was. It certainly wasn’t unloved by any estimation, that he could appreciate - it felt like a home. He tentatively sniffed the air, the smell of multiple herbs swirling around, mingling with the musky smell that seemed to blanket the stranger’s home. He vaguely recognised some of the herbs that were being used - something to reduce the pain in his ankle and ribs, something to make him feel more relaxed; he was also fairly certain that there was a little bit of whiskey in there. Castiel huffed in amusement, wondering how the alcohol would affect him in his shifted state, if it would do anything to him at all. The train of thought was interrupted as the stranger reappeared, holding a bowl with steam merrily rising out of it. Castiel was confused at the slightly guilty look on his face as he approached, tilting his head to indicate it.
“Are you okay, Dean?” He kissed his knuckles again.
“... Anything else?”
“Have I got crap on my face or something? Why you looking at me like that?” Confusion briefly flashed over Dean’s features, wiping a hand down his face as Castiel looked around quickly to make sure no one was looking, shifting before moving closer to Dean to hold his head between his hands. He placed a gentle kiss to his lips before pulling ever so slightly away; smiling at the way Dean moved to chase after another as Castiel brushed his thumb over the Empath’s cheek.
“Wait, Cas. Cas!” Sam grabbed the angel's arm, stopping him from going any further. He looked at where the hunter had his arm, one eyebrow arched in question, still turned towards the warehouse.
“I get it, a lot of this is new to you, you’re gonna get distracted. You don’t have to feel embarrassed about it. Just try and keep up with me, yeah?” Dean stands again, knees popping as he comes to his full height and stretches. Castiel’s tail wags as he stands and stretches himself, ankle staying silent as he stands fully for the first time in days. His tail wags harder at the revelation that maybe soon he’ll be able to shift back, to not be stuck because of injury. Dean laughs at the speed Castiel tail gets to, shaking his head as he begins to walk ahead again, turning back to ensure the Familiar is following him.
“Perhaps it would be easier if we were to split up that way then?” Dean’s head whipped up at Castiel’s suggestion, wings flaring again.
Castiel swallowed, trying to regain some composure before he jumped the hunter there and then, taking a deep breath before slowly letting it back out.
“Dean… We can’t put this off forever.”
“Who would have thought it'd take me growing wings to realise how much you actually mean to me, Cas?”
“He didn’t do it alone, Sam.” A blush settles across Dean’s features as one of Castiel’s wings wraps around his, their hands still linked together.
“One mystery at a time.” He dragged two fingers across the table's surface, grimacing at the tackiness of the blood, frowning when his fingers came away black. He rubbed the substance between his middle finger and thumb, noticing the burnt smell that accompanied the powdery texture, these answers only adding to his confusion. Now he was closer, he noticed they almost looked like... Burns? He shook his head, the marks not deep enough on the table to be called burns. Maybe scorch marks? He took a few steps away to get a wider view of the whole table, heart dropping when he realised what it was. There had been an angel here at some point, the darker stain the imprint of wings as they'd been killed, covering the whole top of the table.
“... Where did you get this?”
“The most I’ll be able to do is check how much damage has been done. Beyond that, nature has to take its course.” Dean groaned again; Castiel rolling his eyes at the hunter’s behaviour as he began his descent down the steps.
