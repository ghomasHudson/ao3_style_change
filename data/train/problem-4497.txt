Cas looked up into Sam's face, contemplating for a moment. He knew he could trust Sam. "I'm just worried. About Dean."
Cas couldnt get enough. He shoved his tongue into Dean's mouth again, pulling his body against his own as close as he could get. It still wasn't enough, he wanted more.
It's been silent. Once Dean finished filling out the paperwork, they let the soft noises of the vet flow around them. Dean breaks it with a huff. "It's like we're sitting in the hospital waiting for news on our kid."
Dean shook his head. "No, its not. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much that's not been a problem. I find you extremely sexy, and it's hard for me to keep my hands off of you. It's just, when it comes to feelings. Man, I suck at them."
They sit there for a while, Dean soaking up the comfort Charlie is offering. She's always been good at that. Even without any more words, he's already feeling better just by her being there.
"Nah, that asshole did. But I know the drill by now." Dean shakes his head and runs a hand down his face. "Doesn't matter. I can't do it again, especially now. I justâ€¦ I need a place to stay for a bit till I can get an apartment or something." Dean finally looks up at his brother with pleading eyes.
Pressing his face to the side into his pillow, Dean tries to muffle his cries of pleasure, but Cas growls into his ear. "Don't. I wanna hear you. You sound so beautiful." And fuck if that doesn't turn him on even more. Dean tends to be loud in bed, and it hasn't always gone over well, so the fact that Cas likes it is amazing. After that, he doesn't hold back, moaning every time Cas flicks his wrist just right.
Sam turned and looked at him, a mix of anger and amusement on his face. "Got it bad, dont you?" Sam asked.
Sadness and guilt war inside him. He knows he's not the most attentive... person to date? Partner? Boyfriend? Whatever the hell they are at this point. But Dean had said he'd understood, that he was okay with it and not to change. Maybe he should've tried harder.
The only bad thing is, it hurts. It hurts to be so damn close to Cas, but not close enough. To have him, every evening on the couch, all but cuddled together, but not in the way Dean wants.
Dean looks around for a minute, then turns back to Cas. "So, you named the chicken lunch?" He asks, extremely curious.
Sam stared at Courtney for a moment, before turning toward the coffee pot. "Thought youd be asleep later." Sam said to Dean, pouring the last of the coffee into a mug.
With a sigh, Dean rolls over and sits up so he's facing his brother, but looks at the wall past his shoulder. "I got off work early yesterday, and went home to tell Cas how I feel about him," Dean says.
Dean's left alone with his thoughts, and the hope that sleep will come soon, because he can't take much more of this pain.
"Damn, Cas. I'm sorry." There's so much anguish in Dean's voice that it actually hurts. Dean knows this was all because he left, and Cas can't find it in himself to reassure him, because it's true, though it's really his own fault for letting it get that bad and not just moving on like every other person after a breakup.
He hasn't even worked. The beautiful bench is still sitting in his workshop, in the exact place he left it when he'd run out to save his chickens. He has no desire to work, to bring anything back to life when his own life is falling apart at his own hands.
He hasn't felt this good in such a long time, the peaceful afterglow of an orgasm with a wonderful man, said man's arms around him, warm and comfortable. Dean easily drifts off to sleep, smile never leaving his face.
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath, steadying himself. Mentally shaking away the image of Dean lying unconcious on the floor covered in blood.
Dean shook his head. "Its not like that." He sat back down, drinking what was left in his own glass. "And his name's Cas."
"We don't have to." Cas says, looking into Dean's eyes. "I want to, but it's okay if you want to wait."
"You never have to let me go again." Cas says, then he's backing up and taking Dean's hand to lead him upstairs.
It wasnt enough. Cas wanted to feel every part of Dean, to know he was alive, to know there were no marks left from that horrible moment. This wasn't about sexual gratification, this was about feeling Dean alive against him.
Shrugging, Dean takes a drink of his water. "I do what I can. We moved back here when Em was two. Sam had just gotten out on his own and came back, so I figured why not. For being an eighteen year old kid in college, he was actually a huge help."
Cas sighs, resigned. "I knew Dean when I was seventeen, back in highschool. He lived here for a little while."
"Cas, man, whatever it is can just be between us if you want. I wont say a word to him. Just tell me, because I'm starting to get worried." Sam folded his hands on the table, showing Cas he wasnt going to drop this.
"We are. You're just too damn quiet." Dean replied, turning back to the sink. "Its fine." He paused. "What did you need to talk to her about?" Dean could feel his stomach bubble a bit. Was that... jealousy he felt? 'I'm not jealous. Theres nothing to be jealous of' he thought to himself.
Cas breaks down the last empty box, looking around their new house. It had been a struggle, convincing Dean to let Cas buy this for them, but he eventually caved and Cas couldn't be happier with it.
It was an interesting feeling for Dean. It stung a bit, but wasnt unpleasant. He felt Cas stretching him out, before he added a second finger. That one hurt a bit, and Dean sucked in a sharp breath, clenching his teeth. Cas sucked Dean's bottom lip into his mouth, chewing it, trying to distract him from the pain.
Cas nods. "Sure. Follow me." He leads Dean back through the door he'd previously emerged from, down a hallway, and into a small office, closing the door behind him. When he turns back, Dean is at a loss for words. "So?" Cas asks.
"She likes you." Dean replies, unable to tear his away from Cas' profile. "Can't say I blame her." Cas just beams at him. "I should go." Dean says quietly, because he really doesn't want to but he really really needs to.
Cas smiles back, small and confident, but he nods. "Probably for the best." He says, and backs up a little more until they aren't touching anymore.
"No," Cas says, and relief flows over Dean's face. "It's still there, in the back of my mind sometimes. But usually when it starts getting bad, I just" he bites his lip again, and feels himself blush. "I think of you and it makes it go away."
Dean grabs ahold of him and pulls him up stairs, down the hall into his room, and Cas goes more than willingly. Dean wastes no time, once inside. He pulls Cas' shirt off, then his own, and pushes Cas back on the bed, following him, pressing their mouths, their bodies, together.
He somehow makes it to his car, but has to sit there for a while before he's calm enough to drive. The whole way home, his anger is abating, and by the time he gets home he's just filled with dread. What the fuck is he supposed to do now? What's he supposed to tell Cas?
"Yeah. See, the thing is... Well, Cas asked me on a date. An actual date. It's been a very long time since I've done that, and I'm not really sure what I'm doing." Dean said, tapping his fingers on the car under him.
He tells her that they're still waiting, and Claire insists on seeing them 'right now dad' tacking on a 'please' at the end because sometimes the manners he taught her actually come through.
It's another few minutes before Dean gathers the nerve to even say anything, but he figures fuck it, why not, Cas already laid his cards out earlier in the night. "I, uh... I didn't really wanna leave you alone here, but I wasn't sure if you'd want me here."
"You, a gorgeous forgiving restaurant owner with high patience, beautiful eyes, and sexy smile, want to go out with me?" Dean replies, still a little shocked at this turn of events.
Dean grabbed ahold of Cas, and shoved him behind him, facing the smoke. "No, you cant have him." He yelled.
Dean begins to grind his hips, pulling back then thrusting back in, and Cas throws his head back, feels Dean's lips and teeth on his neck, hoping he leaves a mark. Holding the back of Dean's head, encouraging him to. He feels the sting of pain, the warmth of Dean's tongue over it, and it feels so fucking good.
"If I had, you never would've moved here, or even come to visit. You would've avoided this town like it had the plague and I'd never see you or my niece." And, well, he's not entirely wrong. He's actually entirely right. If Cas had know, he wouldn't be here.
Dean nodded and took the seat previously occupied by Sam. He sat there watching Sam cook, wanting to asked him so badly if he'd gotten ahold of Cas.
He kisses down Dean's chest, licking his nipple and sucking it into his mouth, pulling it between his teeth gently and Dean's back arches off the bed with a moan. He does the same to the other side, then continues kissing his way down. Once he gets to the hem of Dean's pants, he pulls them and his boxers off and finally has a sight full of Dean, all of Dean, and shit it's a wonderful sight.
All the way back to his car, he's admonishing himself. What the hell was he thinking, offering to give a complete stranger and his
Courtney turned, lowering the book in her hand, and stared at Sam for a moment. Then she closed the book, set it back on the shelf, and strode over to him. "Hello, I'm Courtney" she extended her hand.
His entire life was intertwined with Dean's, and always had been, which, in its itself was great. Spending time with his best friend was always the highlight of his days. But, lately, he couldn't bring himself to do it anymore. They saw each other at school, ate lunch together, talked during free period, but anything outside of that Cas had basically stopped doing. He knew he was being a shitty friend, and that he was probably hurting Dean by doing it, but he just couldn't.
"So, I was still under pressure from my parents, and just hanging on through school. Honestly, I was a mess." This is the awkward part. Hell, the whole rest of the story is the awkward part really. "So I thought, fuck it, maybe it is just a phase and I can make myself like women. I didn't want anybody after you, so why not try?" He sees a flash of guilt pass through Dean's face, and looks away from it.
Dean couldnt figure out if she was just humoring them, or if she actually believed them. He took the last bite of his burger, and quietly said, almost to himself "I need a damn drink."
Cas pulls his hand out, slides them both down around Dean's thighs, and lifts him until Dean's legs are wrapped around him, arms holding on around Cas' neck. Slowly, unable to pull his mouth from Dean's, Cas carries Dean to his bedroom and gently lays him out on his bed, covering him with his body.
Sam pulled the truck into the mini mart's parking lot, and Cas was out of the cab before Sam even stopped. He ran inside, desperately looking around.
"Uh, yeah." Dean rubs the back of his neck with his hand, looking down. After a moment, he looks back up into Cas' too blue eyes, telling himself he can do this. "That guy was a jerk."
Dean stops. "Hang on a sec." He says, and they lower the tv to the ground. Dean shrugs off his jacket, lays it over the top of the tv, then looks at Cas to pick it back up again. Cas is looking at him with an indescribable shimmer in his eyes, but he bends down and they lift it and continue on their way, rain beating down on them.
"The girls" Cas says, nodding toward them but looking at Dean now "have been pushing us together since they found out we dated in highschool."
Cas felt Deans hand on him, and his heartbeat suddenly quickened. This was unusual, having no control over his bodily functions. He chanced a quick glance at the side of Deans face, but Dean just looked like he was really into the movie. Then Cas felt Dean's thumb move, slowly caressing his leg, though Dean still didnt look away from the TV.
Mainly, he can't stop thinking about what happened with Dean, and why he freaked out and withdrew. He has some guesses. For one, it's too soon, it's
Dean leaned his head back to give Cas more skin to suck, and Cas thrust down few more times, causing "fuck Cas" and other, nonsensical, words to spill out of Dean's mouth.
Courtney tilted her head to the side, reminding him of Cas' confused head tilt. "Come on Dean, you're not fooling me. We were kissing, pretty well I might add, and some guy shows up and you take off after him? I wasnt born yesterday." She said, finishing the liquor in her glass.
It hurts. It really fucking hurts, which is utterly ridiculous because it's not like they were anything. It's not like Dean had any real reason to believe they could start over and try again. But it hurts nonetheless.
Cas rutted against Dean over and over, listening to the wonderful noises he was making. He pressed his mouth back to Dean's, swallowing them.
Cas just stares at him with lust blown eyes, and attacks his mouth again. They kiss up against the counter until they're interrupted.
Emma, looking sheepish, replies. "Yeah, we did. We have a while until it's due, we just wanted to pick a topic."
He just wishes he knew why. Why Dean did what he did back then. If he just knew, maybe he could move forward and get past it.
Gordon sets his silverware down, and looks at the manager smiling. "My steak was overcooked twice, the service has been very slow, our waiter has an attitude that I don't appreciate, and he pretended to be the manager so he wouldn't have to go get you. Not to mention that the meat is tasteless, and my potato undercooked."
On the couch, still a bit shocked, Dean attempted to adjust himself so the bulge in his pants wasnt as noticable. "Yeah, it's fine kid. What's up?"
Dean kissed Cas again softly, then tucked his head down and laid it on Cas' chest, resting his body down on Cas'.
Dean stared down at Cas, willing him to ask to come. All sorts of images in his head about an abandoned back road, and Cas in the backseat of Baby.
"Yes, that's probably a good idea." Cas stated, as he poured the coffee into the two mugs. He turned around, handing one to Dean.
"You can't always be there, things are gonna happen that are out of your control. That does not, nor will it ever, make you a bad father. She's gonna be fine, and you're here now and that's what's important."
"If you keep looking at me like that, we may never get out of here" Dean said, flashing another brilliant smile.
Leaning his head up, Cas placed kisses onto Dean's neck, anywhere that he could reach, wrapping his arms around Dean's torso. He bit down into Dean's neck, suckling on the tender spot where his neck met his shoulder.
"Dean, if you think I can move after that, you have more faith in me than I have in myself." Cas replies, smirking slightly. He opens his eyes and looks at Dean. "Is that okay?"
It feels like seven hours have passed when Cas finally speaks. "I was hoping to meet Emma's parents today, if she and Claire are going to be hanging out. Where is her mother?" The question seems awkward, almost forced out, and a pang of uncomfortable sadness he hasn't felt for this in a long time washes through him.
"Seriously, Dean. It was a long time ago." Cas is emotionally drained, and doesn't think he can take any more of this today. "It's over and done."
Once the girls are gone, Dean looks over at Cas and watches as his serious face fades away into a heart melting grin.
Cas stopped beside the car, and looked at Dean. "I dont think you should drive" Cas said, watching Dean struggle with unlocking the door.
When Dean wakes they share slow soft kisses before taking a shower together, washing each other. It's extremely intimate again, and Cas can't get enough.
He opened the door, looking out. "Cas" Dean said, raking his eyes over his form. Cas was wearing an untucked light blue button up shirt, with the top two buttons undone, and a pair of tight dark blue jeans. "You look great." He said.
Cas took a breath, and opened his mouth to sing the next line, when another voice started over the speakers. He watched silently as Dean took the stage next to him and sang.
He found Courtney in the library, curled up in a chair, with a book in her lap. Sam was sitting at the table closest to her, his laptop open in front of him.
They were sitting at the table, and Cas was laughing. Actual, full blown laughing. He glanced over at Courtney and saw a genuine smile on her face. Dean had no idea what they were talking about, but seeing Cas like that, it put such a big smile on his own face.
Cas shifts on the couch and pulls Dean up until they're sitting next to each other, then looks into Dean's eyes. "Why don't you quit?" Cas asks, for probably the tenth time since they've lived together.
"Yeah, baby. I did." He replies, because he never could deny anything relating to Cas. Emma snuggles into his side, and his puts his arm around her. "So, you wanna watch a movie?" He's sure she'll want to know more, but for now he just needs to sit with these feelings, with the knowledge that Cas is back, and that their kids are friends.
After a while, he carefully untangles himself and slides out of bed, hitting the bathroom before heading downstairs. He's sure the girls will be up soon, so he'd better get started on breakfast, and coffee because that's a necessity for mornings.
"It's alright, we had a busy day" Dean says, running his hand through Cas' hair one more time before slowly pulling back. Once the contact is gone, Cas misses it immediately.
He watches for a minute, but when Dean doesn't offer any other explanation, Cas turns and goes back inside, straight to the coffee pot.
Once he's satisfied, Cas pulls back and looks at his work. "You're mine." He growls, before sealing their lips together again. He can feel a shudder go through Dean's body against his, and another wave of arousal shoots downwards.
"Look, dad. I've actually made a friend here. Please. I promise we'll be doing school work, and I'll unpack when I get home tomorrow."
Fern Guy sighs. "I was going to see if my brother could come get me so I wouldn't put you out any more than I already have, but he's not answering. I'm sorry." He looks so damn concerned, the rest of Dean's annoyance melts away.
It's too soon when Cas looks up, a wide smile spreading across his face. "Hello Dean. I didn't realize how late it was." Cas glances at the clock on the wall then back at Dean with a furrowed brow as he pulls himself up off the floor. "You're not supposed to be home yet. What happened?" He asks, stepping towards Dean. When he gets a good look at Dean in the light, his face scrunches with concern. "Oh my god, Dean what happened?"
"I'll wash em" Dean said, turning the water on. "You go shower. Your health stench is starting to seep through."
Once everything was ready, Dean piled plates with eggs, bacon, and pancakes, and brought them to the table.
Cas watches as Dean stares at Gabriel, probably trying to find any similarities between the two of them, which he won't because they're complete opposites.
Pushing down with his hips, Cas begs Dean to move. He needs to feel him, needs to be even closer, never let him go.
"Dean" Cas whimpers out, as Dean sucks a mark into his neck. He doesn't know if he's trying to get his attention to get him to stop, or to keep going. Everything in his brain is firing in different directions, and his body is not cooperating.
Dean nodded, and walked to the bar. He put their order in, and while he was waiting he turned around and watched.
It's evening time when Dean gets a text from Cas. He'd texted him that morning, asking how they were doing, and Cas is just now gracing him with a reply.
Cas reached for the door handle, and started to climb out of the car, nodding for Dean to follow him. Dean opened his door and stepped out onto the fresh air. "Howd you find this place?" He asked.
The next day at work is normal, average, the same as every day. It's boring, but Dean is glad nothing crazy happens because he's finally calmed down from the day before.
They climb into the truck silently, Cas starting it up and pulling out onto the road. He thinks he's avoided Claire asking questions, until they're halfway home and it starts.
As Dean stared at Cas, soaking up his smile, he felt the room start to shake, followed by an earth shattering rumble. He looked around, trying to figure out where it came from. He looked at Sam, who was already on his feet searching, gun ready.
Sam sat down in the chair, kicking out the recliner, and pulling the blanket from the back of the chair over himself. "Ready" he said.
Cas slows his thrusts, then stops, holding Dean against his chest. His husband is limp, relaxed. Cas tightens his hold then slowly lowers Dean to the bed, pulling out as he goes. He adjusts Dean onto his back, looking down at him. Dean is staring at him with so much love and affection in his eyes it makes Cas' chest fill.
Courtney pulled the clothes out of his reach. "Nuh uh. No. Do not touch these until you shower. You're covered in grease."
As Dean leaned in, Cas pulled back. Dean looked at him with hurt in his eyes. "There is no need to do that. I'm not a child, you dont have to appease me." Cas said.
"I'm sure." Dean says, grinning as he makes his way back to the front. "Thanks man." He says to Benny, clapping him on the shoulder, then he's out the door and on his way back to the car before the bus pulls away.
Sam shook his head, and poured himself a cup of coffee. "Whatever. I have a lot of research to do, if anybody feels like helping."
Dean removed his lips from Cas', eliciting a slight whimper noise from Cas' throat at the loss of contact, before Dean moved along Cas' jawline to his neck. He began to kiss and nibble along Cas' neck, sucking small marks into the most sensitive areas.
Cas took a second, then slowly turned around, taking his foot off the stairs. He looked into Dean's face. "Why? What else is there to say?" Cas was both angry and hurt. He couldn't take anymore verbal assaults, especially from Dean.
"Yes, well..." Cas isn't sure where he's going with that, so he changes the topic from this uncomfortable one to another uncomfortable one, because what other kind of conversation is there to have with Dean than that kind. "I went to Singer's and the Roadhouse today, and they both offered me work. Thank you for doing that."
"Mmm" Emma swallows before talking, something she definitely didn't get from her father. "Its a science project. We're not sure yet, that's what we're gonna figure out tomorrow."
"Because" he starts, as he gathers his thoughts. "Because, sometimes things happen that are really hard to move on from."
Cas twisted his body until he was fully facing Dean, laying his hand on Dean's thigh, and lightly rubbing it.
"I have to go. My daughter." He says. He's scared and worried and he needs to leave now, so he's walking away before he thinks to throw an "I'm sorry" over his shoulder. He tries to call Dean back, but it goes to voicemail so he hurries out to his car as quickly as he can.
"Uh, yeah, so I was almost home when I heard clucking in my backseat. Heather stowed away." Dean says.
Emma sighs and looks up at him with a guilty expression. "I know, I'm sorry. Since she's coming over tomorrow, she was worried her dad would think it was too much."
It doesn't change the fact that he is so fucking done with everything about this job that he could vomit.
Cas leaned his body against Dean's, and brought their lips together for a moment. "I'm glad we did this" Cas said.
Dean tightened his grip around Cas' member, running his fist from base to tip and back again as Cas moaned his name.
Dean tossed his phone onto the bed, then, thinking about, it he picked it back up and shoved it in his pocket.
Dean was in heaven, metaphorically of course. There were so many old cars, plaques of information, and artist renderings, Dean didnt even know where to start.
So Dean had packed his stuff, stored most of his furniture and things he wouldn't need any time soon, and moved into Cas' apartment. They've been best friends for years, so living together has come easily to them. They move around each other seamlessly, share space, and even have a stupid chore routine down that Dean scoffed at but is secretly pleased about.
They stood like that for a while, just holding onto each other, until the water started to run lukewarm.
Dean reaches out and pulls Cas to him, burying his face in the crook of Cas' neck and inhaling, the scent of his boyfriend calming him a little. After a minute, when Dean's regained enough brainpower to function, he loosens his grip on Cas and tells him.
Cas' stomach flipped. Even freaking out, Dean still thought about his comfort and brought him clean clothes.
The need to get closer, to feel Dean's body against his again, is strong. It seems Dean feels the same as he's pulling Cas against him, pressing their bodies together as best he can in the awkward angle they're sitting.
Dean looked again into Cas' face, and, unable to control himself, he leaned up and pressed his lips to Cas'.
That hits like a punch to Dean's gut. "Oh" is all that comes out, because he thought this was going really well, but if Cas wants away from him bad enough to take the bus, then it must not have been. "Alright."
Once Dean steps through the door, Cas closes it and walks past him to the kitchen. He grabs two bottles of water from the fridge, and sets them on the kitchen table, taking his seat back. He slides a water across the table, and motions for Dean to sit.
Cas squirted a bit of the liquid onto his fingers, rubbing it around with his thumb, and looked at Dean again, searching for confirmation that he was ready.
In a split second Dean made a decision. He didnt even know what he was really doing, he just knew he couldn't let it end this way, and before he knew it he was chasing after Cas.
"Yeah, whatever." He can't say more than that for fear of it coming out in the form of a sob that he's trying valiantly to hold in.
As he changed out of his jeans and t-shirt, he couldnt stop thinking about the look on Cas' face. It was a look of pure betrayal. They'd lied to each other many times, but nothing compared to the hurt on his face tonight.
. This touch is not like that. It almost feels like he's holding hands with his brother, and okay, that's a weird thought.
Claire feels better, and by Thursday she's back at school. On Friday, she comes home excited because of course she didn't forget about their tentative plans on Saturday. Cas tells her he thinks it's too soon, but she argues that she's fine and she'll be careful. And she promises to call if anything,
Cas looks at her this time, and it's a long minute before he clears his throat, wipes a tear from his eye and says "that's okay."
Cas whips back around so quickly, it almost knocks Dean over. "I trusted you!" He says in a quiet hiss. "You told me about all those different schools, all those different people you fooled around with and then left. You said it was different. That I was different! You said you'd never do that to me."
A smile pulls at Cas' lips, and he kisses Dean softly. When he pulls back he looks right in Dean's eyes.
Cas makes his way back out to the waiting room, and Emma is now laid out where he'd been sitting, with her head in Dean's lap sleeping. Dean's head is bent forward, and he looks like he might be asleep too, so Cas touches him on the shoulder gently and says his name.
They take up three separate seats, loudly having a conversation over the head of the woman sitting in the seat between them. It's rude, and annoying, but not against the rules so Dean pulls out into traffic and continues on his route, tuning out the assholes.
Dean looks down at the table, nodding. "I did." When he looks back up, he catches Cas' eyes, and the look there is so intense Cas can't breathe for a moment. "I would do anything to fix this, Cas. You're my everything."
Dean didnt move. His mind went completely blank as he felt Cas' warm chapped lips against his own. Very slowly, Dean slid his hand up and around the back of Cas' neck, pulling him in further.
He was wiping down the tables in the library when he noticed Cas hadn't moved from one of the tables in the back in a long time. He'd just sat there, with Dean's laptop in front of him, for a good part of the day.
The banging continues as he pulls himself up off the floor and looks around. It's barely light outside, the sun just coming up. Making his way over to slider, he opens it slowly and quietly, peaking out.
Still laughing, Courtney led them inside the bar and to a table toward the back of the room. It wasnt too busy a night, and there were plenty of open tables.
Cas nodded, and began unbuttoning his shirt. It took everything he had, but Dean turned around, took off his own jeans, and slipped on the pajama pants.
Dean takes a breath and let's it out slowly, shaking his head and looking off into the distance as he remembers. "He beat me until I could barely move. Then he made me pack our stuff, shoved us in the car, and we took off. He told me-" Dean's breath stutters at the memory. "He told me if I ever tried to contact you, he'd make sure I couldn't do it again. I didn't know if that was a threat against you or me, but either way it was effective."
"Bye Cas" Dean says to the inside of the car. He watches to make sure Cas gets inside, then drives home.
Dean took a deep breath, and closed his eyes. It had been so very long since anybody had been this loving with him. In fact, he couldnt remember a time when anybody had done this for him. He could hear Cas' heartbeat in his ear, hard and quick at first, but as time slowly ticked by it settled down to a normal pace.
Staring at Dean, Cas is hit with the overwhelming urge to be closer, be in his arms, kiss him again. He can feel the tension between them, can see in Dean's eyes that he wants it too.
Cas hastily pulled his own shirt over his head, throwing it back on the floor where it was not long ago. Dean clung to him, panting, desperate for more contact.
When his gaze flits over to Dean, he's sure his emotions are plain on his face. Dean takes one look at him, and turns to Claire with a forced smile. "I've got some work to do, actually. But Emma can go if she wants. If that's okay with Cas."
Claire is in a private room, and Cas waits until the doctor leaves before he lets his tears fall again. Seeing her in the hospital bed, so small and frail looking with wires and an IV attached, it breaks something in him, and before long he's collapsed in the chair by her side and sobbing.
Putting it into park, he takes a look around. It's pretty secluded back here, big open field in the back with a large building, house surrounded by trees on either side. He really could get murdered out here and no one would know, but somehow he doesn't feel worried at all.
Grumbling under his breath about how Sam had already seen them all 20 times, Dean turned back to the TV to watch.
"I'd like to see a manager." Gordon says, and Dean has to hold in a sigh. He's never going to get to eat, Gordon is seriously an asshole, and he feels bad that Cas has to deal with them. This man should not be going to restaurants, or even out in public if this is how he acts.
Sitting there for a moment, he resolved to make today better, so he got out of bed, threw on a pair of jeans, a black t-shirt, and a flannel, and left his room.
"No, I suppose it doesnt" Cas replied. After a moment, he walked toward Dean and followed him to his room.
"I left right after you did. She was understanding. Told me to go explain myself to you." Dean laughed. "She thought you were my boyfriend, when I chased after you."
He saw Cas shake his head. "You dont need to explain. I'm perfectly capable of understanding what happened. Just let me leave."
"Jesus Cas" Dean stands up and pulls Cas up with him before crashing their mouths together. Cas feels so fucking good in his arms, and he pulls him tighter until there's no space left between any part of them.
Dean wakes up late morning with Cas pressing kisses to the back of his neck, his body a solid weight against Dean's back.
"Hell no" she said, taking a drink of her beer. "After what he did? He can spend the rest of his life wondering where I disappeared to."
When Dean emerges from his own shower, body damp and pink beneath his clothes, Cas is leaning against the kitchen counter, wondering where they go from here. Dean gets his own glass of water, drinking it while watching Cas, and once he's done he sidles up to Cas until he's directly in front of him.
Sitting up and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, Dean looked at the clock. It had only been about 2 hours since he fell asleep, but after that dream he didnt think he could sleep anymore.
It is, by far, one of the best kisses he's ever had. Cas knows what he's doing, pushing all of Dean's buttons with his tongue, his hands holding Dean's hips against the wall, bodies flush together. It's amazing, and perfect, and Dean needs to end it soon before he does something stupid.
As Dean collected his clothes from his room, and proceeded on to the shower room to get cleaned up, Cas stood in the kitchen for short while thinking about what just happened. He was very happy, but that worried feeling kept nagging a hole in his stomach.
Dean hasn't felt this good in a while. He didn't realize how much he needed a day to just be him, to just be with Cas.
"Uh, yeah." Dean says, dropping his hands to his sides. "I'm just confused. I thought this was going well." He still doesn't turn around though, doesn't want to face Cas.
Cas felt his dick twitch at the thought of there being nothing between he and Dean their first time. "Me too." Cas replied. He grabbed the condom from Dean's hand, and tossed it to the floor, before kissing him again, and moving his body down, rubbing their erections together. The noises Dean made were incredible, and Cas didn't think he'd ever get enough of them.
"Can't sleep. I'm worried about her. Can we go back to the hospital?" She looks tired, concern furrowing her brow, but a pleading look on her face.
Once the coffee is finished, Cas fills 2 mugs, fixing one with cream and sugar, and heads back to the deck. He sets the plain one on the railing near where Dean is working and stares at him.
"You are not a bad father, jesus Cas." Dean says, and Cas must've been talking outloud because he's pretty sure Dean can't read his mind. "It's gonna be okay." Dean says, and Cas doesn't know how it happens but his arms around around Dean and he's clutching onto his shirt like Claire had been. Dean's hand is rubbing along his back, and Cas is starting to get his breathing under control.
One of the guys stands up, looks down at the woman and winks, then takes a step toward Dean. "And what if we don't want to? What're you gonna do?" He says mockingly.
He wonders if this is some sort of guilt fueled need to make things right on Dean's part, but he won't look a gift job in the mouth when it means he can pay the bills and the rent and keep food on the table. His savings have been dwindling fast, and now he doesn't have to stress about it as much.
Once Dean was safely in the Impala, he took a deep steadying breath, started the car, and pulled out of the garage.
They're making small talk, looking through their menus, when they're interrupted by a deep voice next to the table.
"So so bad. And I can't fix it. I thought I could but he won't talk to me and I went there but Sam wouldn't let me in to see him and now I just don't know what to do and it hurts so much." He's rambling and he's sure he's not making any sense, but he can't help it.
He's sad and alone and he knows its pathetic, but that doesn't stop him from taking a tub of ice cream, pouring chocolate sauce all up in it, and taking it into the livingroom with a spoon to eat his feelings away.
"Hey, Sam said you would probably be out here." She said, stepping up next to him. "Whatre you working on?"
As his hand inched up to Cas' chest, he felt Cas move beneath him, trying to gain some sort of friction. Dean adjusted himself so his right thigh was pressed directly between Cas' legs.
"It's cool. Just, grab a seat." Dean says, settling down into his chair and starting the bus back up. He flips the off duty sign, and heads toward the station, pulling in within five minutes like he'd said.
Dean caught her eyes, and leaned in. She leaned back towards him, and their lips met. Dean reached his hand up into her hair, squashing down the memories of his hand on Cas' neck.
"Too many clothes" Dean gasped out, gripping Cas' head, that was still attacking his chest, with one hand.
Cas backs him up until he's pressed against the fridge, and Cas is pushed up against his front and Dean can feel every goddamn inch of him and he wants him so fucking bad. Cas wedges his leg between Dean's thighs and rolls his hips and Dean drops his head back on a moan, while Cas kisses down his neck.
Cas knows what's coming next, because it would only be fair for him to share his story as well. That doesn't make him any less nervous when Dean asks.
Cas pushes against him even harder, and Dean can feel Cas' excitement against his own, and he fucking
By the time he's climbing the stairs, Dean and Charlie are on their feet, Charlie has already hugged Emma and is pulling Claire into a hug of her own.
"Go and talk to him. He's probably in there worrying about how you're reacting to what he did." Sam stated.
Cas is shaking with the effort to hold himself back, and Dean lifts his head and kisses him, pushing his hips down.
That makes Cas extremely nervous. He doesn't even want to see Dean again, as much as he actually does want to. No, he'll drive it over, make Claire take it to the door, and never even look.
Cas is standing on the deck when he looks up. "I'll be back tomorrow, but probably wont be able to get it done until next weekend." Dean says.
"Sure, that's fine. I can make lunch if she's staying that long. Burgers?" Dean asks, before shoving another too big bite into his mouth.
As he walked in and sat down in his previously occupied chair, Sam looked up with a questioning look.
Dean gets the bus rolling again, pulled into the station, has the stray feathers cleaned up and is out in less than five minutes. The bosses are gone for the day, but he gets a stern look from the dispatcher at the desk. Dean doesn't say a word, quickly clocks out, gathers his stuff, and heads back toward the parking lot on foot.
He heard Cas take a deep breath. "No Dean, I'm not mad. I wish you would have told me you spoke to her in the first place, we could have avoided fighting about it."
It's a nice day full of doing nothing. Normally, sitting around and trying to relax unnerves Cas. He can never quite unwind, always waiting for something to happen, but today he's not. He grabs a book and curls up on the couch to pass the day.
"Anyway, that's about it. It's just been me and Emma. And Sam, of course. He's married, has a couple of kids of his own. Became a lawyer, no big surprise there."
Cas slowly walked towards Dean, with a look on his face that could frighten the most powerful of creatures. Dean stood there immobile, not sure what was coming. Did he piss Cas off that much?
Sam sighs. "Hang on a sec." Cas' heart is pounding with anticipation. If he can just get Dean on the phone, he can fix it.
Cas waves a hand up in dismissal. "It's fine. Everything worked out. I have Claire, and she has me, and as you said before, that's what matters."
Dean sighed, and remained silent. He took a few more drinks before finally saying "Fine! Fine. I fucked up. Really bad. And I dont think hes coming back."
For the second time that day, Dean thought his heart might stop. As he kissed Cas back, he felt Cas move closer and press his body against Dean's. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, pulling him flush against his body.
Cas couldn't think straight. He felt himself growing harder, his cock straining against his pants now.
Dean shook his head, but didn't say anything. He hadnt felt this happy in... Well, he didn't think hed ever felt this happy. This satisfied.
As they pulled onto the road that led up to the bunker, Courtney leaned forward again. "Okay, so if you guys are taking me here to kill me, just tell me now." She said, looking around. She chuckled a little, but was also a little serious.
The second thing is the envelope Dean gave him. He feels a little guilty for taking the money, as the work had really already been done and all he had to do was find the mistakes. But honestly, he could use it. He'd been to a few small independently owned shops around town the day before trying to get the word out there about what he does, but no one seemed to need an accountant currently.
They headed out to the garage and climbed inside Baby. As she purred to life, Dean smiled. "I havent been out of the bunker in almost a week. This is nice."
"Nah, not really. I could've opened it sooner, but, you know, single dad and all. Made it difficult."
"Don't need to. Never need to with you. So close, baby. Right there, just a little more." Dean says, grinding down on him.
"Oh, yes, sorry. Yes, I live about a block away from there. You can drop me off at the stop if you don't want to take me all the way home." He says.
It's been seventeen years since he's seen Cas, and barely a day goes by where he doesn't at least cross Dean's mind for a second. Guilt and sadness wash over him as he walks around the island, pulling the cutting board with the onions on it in front of him.
"I was miserable. I spent 4 days in bed, but I feel like I havent slept. I kept dreaming about that look on your face. And I was worried you'd never come back." Dean said.
Cas held a hand up, stopping Dean from moving any further. "I understand wanting to be there for Jack, but he is very powerful, and Sam said he could handle it. You jumped at the first opportunity to leave. Again."
Cas' head whips up and looks at them. His eyes are red, his cheeks flushed, and it looks like he's been running his hands through his hair nonstop since he came up here.
seen?" Charlie says, and it shows how long they've been friends that he knows what she's trying to say.
Once Dean inhaled all of his food, he stood up. Cas looked up at him. "I need to stretch my legs. I think I'm gonna make a store run, get something to make for dinner." Dean said.
Cas shrugs and stuffs it in his pocket. "I'll just use it towards our date. Are you free tomorrow night?"
"I love you." Cas says, because what else is there to say? He has everything he's ever wanted right here.
They wandered through exhibit after exhibit of paintings, statues, and the like, but Cas didn't stop to look at anything.
He's close enough that Dean can smell him, coconut with an underlying hint of acetone, and Dean breathes in, very much enjoying it. Cas presses a light kiss to his cheek, and when he pulls back, he's blushing and it makes him even more adorable. "Thank you Dean."
Cas nodded. "You're right." He looked at Sam. "Shes not a random woman. Shes the woman Dean made out with the other night at the bar."
He knew this would probably come eventually, but he thought since Cas hadn't brought it up yet that maybe he wasn't going to.
"Yes. I was comfortable but realized I've been sitting like this for too long and my foot feels funny." Cas said, wiggling his foot.
Cas is extremely annoyed at the amount of relief that flows through him at knowing she's gay. That this is not someone Dean's dating. Though he shouldn't feel relief, none at all, because it doesn't matter. At least that's what he tells himself.
Dean starts rambling nervously. "I don't even really know him. Met him online, which was my mistake. My friend suggested it, and I thought what the hell, ya know? Because it's really hard to meet people when you work so much. He seemed nice, really, otherwise I never would've agreed to meet. I'm not like that, not like him, I swear. I just wanted to get through the rest of the night and go home, but he kept doing things until I couldn't take anymore. I'm really sorry I caused a scene, and I'm really sorry he got you in trouble. I'll talk to your manager, tell him it wasn't true, whatever it takes." Dean digs into his pocket, pulling out the hundred dollar bill he'd put in there while he was in the car. "Also, I want you to have this, because nobody deserves the way he treated you, especially you with how patient you were." He hands the bill over, and Cas just looks at it. "Seriously, you earned that. You earned more than that, but that's all the cash I've got on me right now."
Cas felt Dean move the leg that was between his thighs, and let out a loud involuntary moan as it pressed against his hard length.
Cas rolled to the side, off of Dean, and pulled Dean against him. Dean rested his head on Cas' bare chest and yawned.
"Whatever Dean. We arent together, you can do what you want." Cas said, making a move to get out of the bed.
Dean leaned against Cas, sliding his arm over the back of his chair. He felt Cas lean into him, and lay his hand on Dean's thigh.
When they wake from their nap, they take a nice hot slow shower together. Dean brings him to orgasm with his mouth, that fucking mouth that Cas missed so much and none has ever been able to compare to, and Cas returns the favor. They're dressed and cuddling on the couch by the time the girls come home.
Once in his room, Dean went to his dresser and, rifling through, pulled out a couple pairs of pajama pants, and a tshirt. He tossed one pair and the tshirt to Cas, who caught them and looked at them questioningly.
Cas is staring into the bed of the truck where there's a chicken coop. It looks like a tiny house painted a light blue, actual windows on the sides, shutters and all, with little flower beds underneath. There's a ramp leading up to the door, and chicken wire all along the bottom.
"No," Cas says, trying to get his mind back online. "No, you didn't do anything wrong." He reaches out and grabs Dean's arm, pulling him closer.
Cas stood there at the bottom of the stairs stunned. What just happened? He could feel his heart racing. Hed known for a while that his feeling towards Dean were more than brotherly. That their bond was more than just an angel looking after his charge. But he didnt think Dean had those same feelings. Maybe he didnt. Maybe he just did what he did to keep Cas from walking out again.
He kisses Dean, everywhere he can reach, pressing words into his skin. "Beautiful" "sweet" "thoughtful" "perfect" "amazing" and can feel Dean already trembling beneath him as he moves his hands down and pops the button on his jeans, sliding them and his boxers off. He easily divests himself of his own until they're both naked, then brings their lips back together, connecting their bodies completely from head to foot.
"I'd say trust me, but I know I fucked that up." Dean says with a self deprecating laugh. He shakes his head and huffs, pulling his bag onto the table. "I can prove it."
"It wasnt nothing. It was amazing. It was perfect." Dean said, pulling Cas to him and giving him a small kiss. When he pulled back, he gestured toward the door to the bunker. "You know, they're probably in there waiting to ask us all about it."
Nodding, Cas pushes at Dean's pants again. "Yes. Want you to fuck me." He can feel a shiver go through Dean with his words, then Dean is nodding and moving down to pull Cas' pants off.
"Emma, we aren't staying. I told you we could bring it and you could see how she is, but they need to rest. No arguments."
Not even caring that yet another shirt was ruined in the same day, Dean quickly discarded the pieces to the floor, and pressed his chest against Cas', returning their lips together.
"So they just happen to be here at the exact time we are? Em, if you wanted to hang out tonight you could've just asked. I don't like you being deceitful."
He waited until Cas said "okay" before turning back around. He took in the sight in front of him. Seeing Cas so casual was something new to him, and he liked it.
"It's not your fault, you couldn't have known." Dean says, and Cas realizes he must've been talking out loud. "These things happen. It's all going to be okay."
"No-" Cas says, but a voice coming from behind him says "yes" and suddenly the smirk is gone from Dean's face and he feels like there's ice in his veins as he watches a shirtless man come up to Cas and wrap his arms around him.
Cas looks from Gordon to Dean, and Dean just shrugs. "That's a good choice" Cas says. "I'll be back with that and to take your orders shortly." And then he walks away.
The front door opens after a few moments and a young girl with long brown hair greets Claire with a hug. Cas smiles at the show of friendliness, and both the girls turn and wave at him before heading inside.
"I told you Dean, you and your brother have work to do. This is your destiny. You are the messengers of God's destruction."
"Sure. If you need anything, just holler. I'll be here, stuck in an endless loop of numbers that don't add up." Dean says, shooting them a finger gun. Why a finger gun? He has no damn idea.
"Ah, yes." Cas says, clearing his throat. Dean looks at him from the corner of his eye and can see he's a little red. "Well, I'm an artist. I fix things up, make them better and sell them, and if I can't then I repurpose them into some form of art."
Taking his hand out from underneath Dean's shirt, he slid it downwards, pressing his palm against the hard line in Dean's pants. Dean thrust his hips forward, desperate for the friction.
Cas turns around to look at them, and Dean can see his shoulders sag a little as he let's out a breath. "You promised to unpack today."
"I made a deal." Cas said, grabbing ahold of Dean's arm. "I made a deal with The Empty. When Jack was in Heaven, it came for him. It wouldnt let him go unless I made a deal. I traded myself."
Dean pulls back a little and looks into his eyes, and Cas can see that Dean wants this as much as he does. When Dean nods, Cas presses one more kiss to his lips and grabs his hand, pulling him into the house.
Once Cas was spent, Dean removed his mouth from around him, wiping his mouth off with the bottom of his own shirt.
Dean reached into his pocket to pull out his wallet, but Courtney stopped him with a raised hand. "No no. I've got this. It's the least I can do." She said. She waved the waitress over for the check, and paid.
Its smooth, easy, and honestly quite amazing. Once the check comes, Dean pays and Cas insists he'll get it next time, which makes Dean extremely happy that he's talking about a next time, and Dean suggests going for a walk around town.
"It was, though. I could've denied it. Or figured out some way to get you a message. Sent you a letter. Anything. Anything would've been better than the nothing I left you with. I could've tried, I was just too scared to risk it." Dean says, and he still won't look at Cas.
Dean's heart started to beat harder, faster. In his head, he was yelling at himself. 'Just say it. Say you want him. That you dont want anybody else, you want to be with him. Say it. Say it, you fucking idiot!' "The kissing thing" is what actually came out of Dean's mouth. He mentally kicked himself. 'Coward'.
Cas looked down at himself, then back up at Dean. "This is what I always wear. It's all I have. Plus, this is your shirt."
Cas looks away again, but Dean can see that he's smiling and the shadows are gone from his face. "Thank you Dean."
Cas flipped through netflix, putting something random on that he didnt really care about. He honestly just wanted to get lost in his thoughts. His thoughts about Dean.
Dean barks out a surprised laugh, Claire says "oh gross dad!" and Emma just giggles. And yeah, he definitely needs some sleep, but he can't even regret it because Dean's laugh is always something to be enjoyed.
It's too late to fix it. He knows it's too late, and he feels empty, like there's been a hole punched through him. Why couldn't he have just handled it that first day? Why did he wait, and keep waiting? He loves Dean so damn much, and he fucked everything up.
Being around Dean every day has been amazing. They'd spent a lot of time together before this, but nothing really compares to having Dean here all the time.
can make it better. But I'd rather embarrass myself in front of the best date I've had in years, hell maybe ever, than have you walk away thinking I didn't like you." He says it all very quickly, and it takes Dean a moment to process everything.
God they were amazing. He hasn't felt this light since he was a child, and it's a really nice feeling, one he never wants to let go of.
"Yeah, okay." Dean says, because what else is he supposed to say. Unsure of how he'd read the situation so wrong, he starts to ask. "Can I-" he closes his eyes and sighs, then opens them again and looks away shaking his head.
Cas shook his head, and turned back to the book in front of him. It was hard to concentrate now, all he could think about was Dean's hands on him.
Dean took one more look at Cas then climbed out of the car. "No, we're good." He said, watching Cas get out of his side.
He sits back on his haunches and throws the jeans to the floor, unable to tear his eyes away from the hottest thing he's ever seen. Dean is panting below him, a thin sheen of sweat coating his body. He's straining in the light blue panties, a dark spot on the front where he's leaking, and Cas
Once they're beside the car, Dean turns to Cas and takes his hand. "So, we'll do this again?" He asks, pretty sure of the answer but needing the confirmation.
Dean turned on his side toward Cas, his eyelids growing heavier by the second. He reached out and laid his hand on Cas', before drifting off to sleep.
"I don't need the details, Dean. I saw it." Cas said, trying to sound unattached, but Dean could hear the hurt crack through, just a little.
Courtney grabbed a beer, popped the cap off, took a swig, and said "So, Sam, you hunt monsters too?"
He sits with the mirror facing him, and Dean can see his reflection in the bus mirror. Fern Guy looks up, straight into Dean's eyes, and Dean can't help but shoot him a charming smile. The man's lip quirks slightly, not quite a returning smile, but pretty close.
"I am perfectly capable of handling this Dean. You have... more important things to be dealing with. Here." Sam reached out and grabbed Dean's arm, stopping him as he tried to throw more stuff in the bag.
Then Cas decided, why not, and leaned forward towards Dean, studying him to see if he'd pull away. When Dean didnt back down, Cas pressed his lips to Deans.
Then Dean slowly moved back, only 2 steps. He tore his eyes away from Cas' and let them roam over his body. His beautifully sculpted body. Dean could feel himself hardening a little just looking at Cas. His chest was hard, like he worked out every day, down to a perfect stomach, which led down to his beautifully hard member.
Dean, pushing aside his nervousness, stepped even closer to Cas, until their chests were just barely touching. Cas could feel his breath on his face. Staring into Cas' eyes, Dean reached down and slowly slid Cas' underwear to the floor, then did the same to his own.
Dean is surprised for a second, but can feel himself grinning as he takes ahold of Cas' hand and leads him back to the front of the building.
The whole time, Cas was making the most satisfying noises Dean had ever heard. They werent desperate noises, they were happy, content, beautiful.
He found Dean down a far aisle, on the floor and covered in blood, a knife protruding from his stomach.
"Alright, if that's what you want." Dean said. Cas smiled, and went to pull away again. "Just one thing before you go." Dean held onto Cas' arm.
"Okay." Cas replies, turning to pick his stuff up again. He looks at Dean and smiles. "Goodbye Dean." And then he's down the hall and out the door.
Their lips meet in the middle, and just like every time, Cas gets swept away in Dean's kiss, the feeling of Dean under his hands, his taste in his mouth. He slides his hand around until his fingers are carding through the hair at the back of Dean's neck, and Dean moans low in his throat, pulling Cas closer.
"No, no, I am. This is very nice. I just..." What is he supposed to say? Sorry, my ex from seventeen years ago is randomly back in my life and my daughter is at his house with his daughter and I told him I was going on a date and he looked like he wanted to cry, and oh by the way I think I'm still in love with him. Yeah, he doesn't think that'll go over well. "I'm just distracted today is all. My daughter is at a sleepover for the first time and I guess I'm just a little worried." There, not the truth but not completely a lie.
"I'm not leaving." Emma says as soon as Cas has left the room, and it takes Dean a minute because he's still reeling from everything that happened.
Heading upstairs, he peeks in Claire's room. She's already asleep, and it actually looks like she made decent progress on her boxes finally. He really hopes she gets settled easily, and knows that having a new friend will really help that.
"So, you want breakfast?" Dean asks, turning away from the counter where he'd been gathering stuff to make coffee.
Actually, he wasn't thinking. He was sad and hurt and drunk, and Michael was just there so Cas grasped onto him, onto meaningless sex. That's Cas' fault, but Michael didn't help things, asking Dean to leave.
Dean grabs his nail gun and the rest of his tools he forgot in his angry haste to do something that morning, and heads back out, sliding into the impala. He'd unloaded all the lumber from the truck already, so there's no point in not taking comfort from his Baby now.
"Oh I more than like the books. I would marry the books if that was legal." She said, putting a book back and pulling out another.
Cas grabbed ahold of the back of Dean's head and pulled it towards him, pressing their lips together. Cas pushed his tongue past Dean's lips and into his mouth, tasting the burn of the whiskey, and something salty. He was tasting himself in Dean's mouth. He started to grow hard again at this.
The afternoon and evening go well. They order chinese food for dinner because Claire says that's all she's been dreaming about since her surgery, and Emma agrees that it sounds good. Afterward, the three of them hang out in the livingroom watching movies together until the girls are yawning and barely hanging on, so Dean sends them upstairs to bed.
Dean climbed onto his knees, trying to get a better angle to deepen the kiss. He slid himself so his left leg was in between Cas'.
Dean's legs came up, wrapping around Cas' waist, and Cas shifted his angle, pounding into Dean searching for his prostate. He knew he hit it when Dean threw his head back against the pillow, slamming his eyes closed as a choked groan escaped his throat. He angled himself to rub it on every pass.
"This was not planned, I swear!" She's looking at him pleadingly, and he knows she knows better than to lie again after all that.
When that front door had swung open, it was like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over his head. Dean, standing there looking grown up and more gorgeous than he had any right to.
After they've left and Emma's gifts are put away, the two of them collapse on the couch. Charlie should be there soon, and Dean really needs a nap, or at least to rest before the gaggle of teenage girls descends upon his house like dementors and suck the rest of his energy out to satiate their ever hungry souls.
She let's them know that surgery went well and Claire is still asleep, but he's welcome to go in her room and wait for her to wake up. Dean encourages him, says he and Emma will be there waiting if he needs them, so he reluctantly let's go of Dean's hand and follows the doctor back, listening intently as she fills him in on everything.
Dean is kissing him, and Cas wants to cry and shout in happiness and never let go. Kissing him back with everything he has, Cas presses Dean into the wall and plasters his body against his, unable to get close enough, wanting, needing more.
Once inside, they headed into the library, where Dean figured they'd be. Both Sam and Courtney were sitting at the table closest to the entrance, staring at them as they entered. Courtney had a huge smile plastered on her face.
When Dean pulled back, he saw a smile on Cas' face. They both turned and picked up the glasses, depositing them onto the library table where Courtney and Jack had made themselves comfortable next to each other. Dean and Cas sat down across from them.
Cas could hear Dean's breath increasing, could feel his eyes on him as Dean didnt even pretend to be reading anymore.
Relief washes over him, followed closely by the longing for Dean that is always present these days. "Okay. Thank you."
Getting up, Cas looks at the time and heads into his room, then the bathroom to take a shower, emotions flooding through him. He wants to believe Dean would have talked to him about it soon, but the evidence on the computer certainly tells another story. How long has he even been planning this?
"Yes, and you got involved. You do not get involved. You call it in, call the police, and stay out of it. It is not your place to interfere." Naomi says, and if she didn't have such a stern look on her face Dean would think there was no way she was serious about this.
"I'm not going. You're going to take the bag to the door, drop it off, then we're getting some breakfast." He says casually, pulling the bag from the back seat and handing it over. Or at least, tries to hand it over, but Claire won't take it.
"What" Dean swallows hard. "What..." jesus christ pull it together man. "What're you doing here?" His voice barely wavers, and he calls that a damn win with the emotional turmoil going through his brain.
Cas won't be mad that he quit, he's been wanting Dean to quit, but will he be disappointed in the way it happened?
As Dean shuddered at Cas' mouth exploring him, he could barely get a coherent thought in his head. 'Cas... more... fuck... good... more... ngh...' was all he could think.
They rode in silence for a while, Dean watching Cas drive. He was concentrating hard, and the serious look on his face made Dean smile.
"So, that's an angel thing?" She asked. He nodded. "Interesting" she said, turning back to her plate.
Gordon looks up from his menu and smiles at Dean. "It's a very good wine, I think you'll like it." Dean just nods, and looks back at his menu, noting the exorbitant amount that each glass costs. He's not usually one to keep his mouth shut when he doesn't like something, but this is a first date so he figures he can suffer through one glass of wine.
"Perfect. Gorgeous. Beautiful. Amazing. I love you." Cas whispers into his skin, and Dean shivers under him, hands tangled in Cas' hair.
Dean cuddled down into the pillows, making himself comfortable. He looked over at Cas, who was sitting straight up in the bed with his legs straight out.
Cas drags himself out of bed, downs some coffee, and grabs his keys. He climbs into his truck, the truck that Dean fixed not long after they got together, and another wave of guilt and sadness slams into him. Resting his head on the steering wheel, he gives himself a minute to pull himself together. He's got shit to do before he picks Lunch up, and he needs to go.
Cas nods once, and then they're just looking at each other again. After a minute Cas says "well I better go" and turns around and is out the door before Dean can even say anything.
They heard a knock on the window and jumped apart. "Hey guys, if you wanna, you know, head back home, that's really cool" Courtney said, standing outside the window laughing.
Cas moved his lips down to Dean's neck, sucking new marks into it. 'More... more... more' he thought to himself. "More, Cas" he gasped out. "I want you."
Cas is hard and lean beneath him, bodies slotted together like the were meant to be, and a moan forces its way out as their cocks line up and slide together.
"Dean," Charlie just says his name, and the tears keep flowing freely down his face, and Cas gives up on trying to dry them. When all he does is nod, Charlie scoots closer. "You're gonna have to give me a bit more to work with here."
Closing the last of the distance between them, Cas brings his hand up, sliding it behind Dean's neck before pressing their lips together.
He opened his eyes. It was fairly dark, just one small lamp on the desk on. His bed was empty and his heart started to pound a bit.
Cas doesn't answer, so Dean leaves a voicemail. "Hey Cas, I need you to call me back as soon as you can. I'm taking Claire to the hospital." Claire tries to move again and groans out in pain. "Hey hey, don't move sweetheart, I'll get you." He says to her, before finishing his message. "I think it's her appendix. Just call me back as soon as possible." He hangs up, shoves his phone in his pocket, then turns back to Claire.
Cas set them down on the end of Dean's bed, and started to take off his shirt. As he pulled it off, he looked over at Dean and saw him staring.
Dean peeled himself off of Cas, backing up just a step or two, allowing Cas to move away from the door.
Sam returned a few minutes later with 2 plates of food. He sat one down in front of Dean, and returned to his own table with his plate. Dean looked at it. Ham and cheese sandwich and chips. That was very unlike Sam, to not try to push some healthy crap on him.
Cas steeled himself. "For what Dean?" He asked. He would hold strong, no matter what came out of Dean's mouth next.
Once Dean left, Cas glanced over at Anna to see her looking at him with an icy stare. He gave her a tentative smile, and she just looked away annoyed, which was ridiculous. It's not like he'd been interrupting their date. He'd purposely been turned away from them for a good portion of the evening.
"I'm sorry man, I didn't mean to fall asleep on you. You didn't move that whole time? Dean asked, starting to pull himself up off of Cas.
He and Claire spend a lot of time over at Dean's house with he and Emma, and none of them ever seem to tire of each other. It's always, always hard to date when you have a kid, but somehow this is not. They flow together seemlessly. That's not to say they don't have their disagreements, but they're always easily resolved with no hard feelings, and Cas revels in the effortlessness of it all.
"Shit" Dean mumbles to himself, thinking quickly. He could pull over and call an ambulance, but they sometimes take forever, and he can get there much faster.
Cas obeyed, rolling off of Dean, and turning onto his back to watch him walk out of the room. Dean was back in a minute with a warm washcloth, and wiped Cas down.
Cas' hair is being gripped, so he pulls off and looks up at Dean, and can see he's close, so he focuses on bringing him pleasure with his fingers, making sure to rub against his prostate on every couple of passes.
"Never got around to it, when Michael came out of his room half dressed and all over him." A fresh wave of pain stabs into Dean's chest, and he has to take a steadying breath. "He asked me to leave, so I left."
Cas nods. "Kind of hard not to." He says, gesturing at the table. "I don't know why you'd keep this from me though. I would never judge you for something you enjoy. I love you."
"Yes, I'm sure. Just want you." Cas says, fingers sliding behind Dean's head and pulling him into a kiss. Dean shudders in his arms, and moves back enough to slick himself up. Cas pulls him closer as Dean slides inside, slowly, until he's seated all the way, Cas letting out a pleased groan at the fullness that he's missed so much, Dean's own moan echoing him. Feeling nothing between Dean and himself, it's blissful.
Dean self consciously folds the bag up and shoves it into his pocket, and Cas finally pulls his eyes away and looks down at the things in his hands. "I don't know what to say." He says, and he sounds a little choked up but Dean doesn't acknowledge that.
The restaurant is almost empty, Dean's three beers in, and he's warm and feeling really damn good. They've moved closer together, and Cas is pressed all along his right side, the warmth of his body making Dean heat up in more than just temperature. The man is beautiful, smart, charming, sucessful, and funny, and Dean is damn lucky to be sitting here with him right now. He says so, because why the hell not.
Before he knew what was happening, Cas had grabbed ahold of him and rolled them over, so now Cas was the one on top with his leg in between Dean's. Dean could feel himself get even harder, straining against his pants.
Cas wants to ask why he married her if he didnt love her, but he's already crossed so many lines in this one conversation. "She's really lucky to have you."
"I fucked up," Cas says. "I fucked up so bad, but I can fix it. I promise I can, just let me talk to him. Please."
: I hate doing the books, and if Claire was serious when she said you were looking to go into independent consulting, then I'd like to hire you to do them from now on.
Cas sat back, pulling Dean's pants down his thighs, and throwing them onto the floor, before following with his own.
They're both breathing hard, clinging to each other. Shivers are going through Cas' body, and he can feel Dean trembling above him. Cas pulls him down, slides him to the side until he has Dean in his arms, pressed against his chest, nose and lips buried in Dean's hair.
Claire is staring him down, and Dean is looking at him with an almost hopeful look, and Emma is just glancing between the three of them confused, and how the hell is he supposed to say no? Fuck. Just say no. No. That's it, one word. "Okay." He says instead. Damnit.
The rhythmic noise, and the warmth of Cas' arms around him were too much, and, without having a say in it, he drifted off to sleep.
Dean stood up, and took a look in the mirror over his dresser. 'Hmm this could work' he thought. He just hoped Cas liked it.
He picks up his burger and starts eating, and it is damn good. Flavorful and juicy, and the fries have some sort of garlic parmesan sprinkle on them that's like magic in his mouth.
Dean looked into Cas' eyes and saw a glint there. Cas crashed his mouth back to Dean's, not letting up on his rubbing.
Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas, before turning and walking out of the kitchen toward his bedroom.
Dean leaned over and lightly pressed his lips to Cas', for just a moment, before pulling back and smiling at him.
"I'm fine. And yourself?" Short clipped answers. Dean can't even blame him. He probably hates this, hates Dean, hates that he came here today.
He's back up on the deck, looking out at his yard when Dean comes out, wrapping his arms around Cas' middle. Cas leans back against him and closes his eyes, enjoying the solid warmth against his back.
When Cas registers what he's looking at, his eyes go wide and his heart starts to pound even harder. It's smashed, but still very clearly a red tulip, and Cas knows that Dean knows what this flower means.
The man grins even more, and continues his activity, letting out a groan that makes bile crawl up Dean's throat.
Dean let off a nervous laugh, and shifted again. He didnt want to lie, it would be calling Cas out. But he also didnt want to tell the truth. 'Damnit Cas, why do you do this shit' he thought.
"Thank you Dean." Cas said, his eyes roaming over Dean's body. "You look..." Cas paused for a moment. "You look really nice."
"Exactly. Its afternoon. Time for a drink." With that, Dean walked over to the drink cart and poured himself a hefty glass out of one of the decanters. Sam just shook his head and went back to work.
"No, Charlie. I don't want to talk about it. You're right, it was a long time ago. But I still can't-" Dean swallows around the lump forming in his throat. "I just can't."
"Uh" Dean looks to Cas, who's staring at him with a furrowed brow. "Actually, I'll have your kobe beef burger with gouda please." He says.
Panic surged through Deans body as he leaned back against his closed door. 'What the fuck just happened' he thought to himself.
When the doctor finally comes out, Dean stands up with him, still holding onto his hand, and Cas doesn't let go either.
It's silent as they catch their breaths, and Cas feels a contentment he hasn't felt in so very long. It was perfect, Dean's perfect, this moment is perfect, his chest is filled to bursting, and it hits him...
Cas tilted his head to the side, the way he always did when he was confused. "I dont understand. You kissed me to get me to stay. I'm staying. Theres no need to pretend Dean. It's really okay."
Cas' finger slowly entered his hole, and Dean gasped into Cas' mouth at the sting. Cas took the opportunity to plunge his tongue into Dean's mouth.
"Yeah Cas I know. I meant why is Dean up so early. We dont have a case, so normally hed be sleeping in." Sam said.
"Fine, you're going to be late for work, and don't whine to me about it because I tried to get you up," Cas says, before turning and heading into the kitchen.
Cas had grown so hard at the anticipation, it was becoming painful, until Dean finally grazed it. A loud moan escaped Cas' throat, right into Dean's mouth. This noise is what drove away any worries Dean might've had, as he grab ahold of the base of Cas' cock.
Cas contemplated that question for a minute. He took a deep breath and said "I didnt want to make it happen sooner than it would naturally. If I brought it up, it might send you down that road, and I just wasnt ready for that yet."
It's taking everything he has not to just pound into Dean's amazing heat, but he holds on, his grip tight against Dean's hips. He loosens his grip, and drops down onto his hands until he can kiss Dean, which is a good distraction for a moment.
"Okay, hey Cas, it's alright, calm down. Shit." He can hear Dean talking but his vision is blurry and he's just standing there freaking out. "Hey, Em, can you hold onto her for me?" Dean says, and a minute later he's being pulled into Dean's arms.
Finally, Cas smiled. It wasnt a big smile, but it was enough encouragement for Dean to pull Cas' head back to him and place another kiss on his lips.
Two days later, Fern Guy gets on with a giant mirror. A huge old mirror, the kind that would be in the foyer of one of those fancy ass mansions where nothing has been updated in 150 years.
Once Dean is seated, his bag in his lap, he looks around, figiting. He bites his lip, and Cas just wants to snap at him to get on with it, because this is just too much. Dean, here in his space, looking so vulnerable; its killing him.
Cas felt like his whole body was on fire, every single place that was touching Dean, as Dean's lips crashed into his. Cas made a startled noise into Dean's mouth, before he moved his hand up to the back of Dean's head, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss.
He slows down as he works them through it, arms trembling, barely able to hold himself up. When the waves of pleasure have stopped, Dean grabs him around the middle and he slides out as Dean pulls him down until they're laying next to each other, pressed close.
"You like this place?" Dean asks, like he didn't just render Cas completely speechless by his mere presence.
Dean sighs, and turns around to face Cas. He's standing pretty close and has a confused look on his face, and Dean just wants this awkward morning after shit to be over.
Dean couldn't keep his eyes open. He didnt think he was tired, but being this comfortable made him sink into sleep.
After only a minute, the other three wander up and inside to check it out, and Cas can't stop smiling. "They love it. I love it." He says, warmth and an unfamiliar feeling spreading through his body.
Kissing down Dean's neck to his chest, only stopping to nip at his skin, Cas ran his hands along every part of Dean's skin he could reach.
Cas laughed, pulling back again. "Yes, you do. Come on." Cas pulled completely out of Dean's grasp and walked around him.
Everything in Cas' head was jumbled. He told himself this was part of their job, this was the risk they took every time they left the bunker, and that he couldnt freak out like this everytime Dean got hurt.
He walks over to the sliding glass door and opens it, stepping out onto the back deck. As soon as he steps out, that damn chicken is back. The same little fucker who kept following him out front.
They break apart, both breathing heavily, lips still brushing against each other as they catch their breaths, sucking in the other's air.
Dean smiled, and turned his hand over, grabbing ahold of Cas'. He pulled lightly, until Cas scooted closer to him.
"Go find him. Talk to him and explain what happened. If you're as close as you say, then he'll understand." She said, touching his arm again, but this time it was purely for comfort.
Cas knew Sam letting him in to see Dean was a long shot, but he had to try. He had to try something other than sitting around hoping Dean would answer his calls.
Cas releases Dean's cock, and sits back on his haunches, pulling his fingers out. Dean shudders at the loss, and Cas rolls on the condom and slicks himself up, his touch providing some much needed relief to his own leaking member.
Dean pulled back, sitting up. "What's wrong?" He asked, his heart starting to beat a little faster. 'Hes pissed. About last night? Fuck. Did I fuck this up again already?' Dean thought.
"Mhmm, so we kiss, and go from there. If you don't like something or it's moving too fast for you, you tell me and we stop. Okay?"
When the food is ready, he loads it onto two plates, sets them on the table, and goes back out to the deck. "Dean, can you come inside?" Cas asks, and doesn't wait for an answer, just walks back in and sits down at the table.
"I don't say things I dont mean." Cas says, and then finally looks at Dean. "I'm glad you were with her when I couldn't be."
"Cas?" Dean calls out, closing the door behind him and dropping his keys on the little table by the door. It's Cas' day off and his car's outside, so he should be home.
He gently drops Dean down onto the bed, and climbs up over him, bringing their lips back together for a moment before taking ahold of Dean's shirt and pulling it off. God, he missed this body. Hard planes, tapered hips, just a little soft around the middle.
"You needed a damn fence, so I'm building you a damn fence" Dean says angrily, then turns back to what he's doing.
"Hey, I got Emma, and that's the only thing that mattered. I didn't love Lydia, and she wasn't any sort of mother, so it was no big loss. It just made things a little harder. All worth it in the end."
Cas made him lunch, and it was the same as breakfast, sitting silently across from each other until he was done, then back to work.
A whimper escaped Dean's throat as Cas removed his fingers, but Cas quickly settled himself back between Dean's legs, and opened the lube again. Pouring some more into his hand, he stroked his hard cock with it.
Cas presses his mouth to Dean's neck, kissing and sucking on it until he's left a claiming mark that shoots possessive desire straight down to his cock.
Cas blushed a bit, and looked down. "You're very attractive yourself, Dean." He responded, scanning his eyes back up, raking over Dean's body.
The guy struggles to reach in his pocket for his pass without setting the item down, so Dean says the first words he's ever spoken to the man. "It's cool, I recognize you." And nods to him. Fern Guy smiles, an actual heart melting smile, and heads back to sit down, setting the item on the bench seat next to him.
Dean looks down into Cas' face, eyes closed and slumped against his side, breathing evenly as the movie they've been watching plays on. Smiling to himself, Dean settles further down into the couch. He knows he should move away, should wake Cas up to go to bed, but he can't bring himself to do it yet.
As he entered the kitchen, he look around for Sam, but instead found Cas, head down on the table, a steaming cup in front of him.
Then Gordon had messaged. Gordon Walker, 32, single, head director of sales at some large company downtown. His profile picture was nice, a handsome man with a stunning grin. In his message, he'd asked Dean about his car, which had spurred a whole conversation, as Dean restores them for a living, and Dean was hooked. They've been talking for most of the week, and it seems like they have a lot in common, so Dean said yes when Gordon had asked to meet him tonight.
"Fuck" Cas said, closing his eyes and dropping his head back against the door behind him. He felt the wet warmth of Dean's mouth envelope his shaft.
Cas suppresses a smile, and asks if they want to stay. Dean says they already ate and that he and Claire both need rest, but to call them if they need anything, then he's ushering Emma out the door.
Dean stood staring at the clothes on his bed for a while. "Eh fuck it" he said out loud to himself, and dropped his robe. He grabbed socks and underwear out of his top drawer, and began to get dressed.
"Morning Claire, Emma." Cas says all properly, even nodding toward them, before taking a drink of his coffee.
They made love right there, on that blanket, the stars shining down on them. It was the most sensual, loving, tender sex Dean had ever experienced.
"Mhmm. Well you're gonna have to make time now. Cas deserves that. Ahah!" She said, pulling something from the very back of his closet.
Cas sighs again, drops his head, then straightens and looks Dean in the eyes. "There's a thing, a vintage television, by the road over there. I want it, for my work, and I didn't want to say anything because I know it's hard to understand. But when I see something like that, I know I can make it better, and if I don't take it it's just going to end up in a landfill somewhere when it could be something
"Wait, it's okay." Cas says, sitting up. He's disoriented and a bit confused, but Dean's here and that's a nice thing. He gets himself sat up and rubs the sleep from his eyes before taking them in again. "So what's going on?"
The drive was nice, but it was over too soon. Before Dean knew it, he was pulling into the garage and getting out of the car.
As Cas sucked on his neck, he realized what that pulling feel in his chest was. The feeling hed never had before. The feeling that had been causing panic to course through his body.
"That's not what happened." Cas says desperately. He needs to do something now, or Dean will be gone forever.
Hed never done anything so intimate with somebody. Something that wasn't sexual at all, just closeness and taking care of each other.
"Sure, sounds like fun." Cas replies. As he walks to the stairs, he says "goodbye Dean" and is already halfway to the truck when Dean responds with his own goodbye, and he hears Charlie says "and there's the Chris Evan's reference."
"After that, I knew there was no changing anything. I'm gay, and that's just how it is." Cas shakes his head, and looks down again. "The next time I really saw her, she was pounding my door down and telling me she's pregnant. I had been so high that night, I didn't even think about protection. The only person I'd ever been with was you, and so it didn't even cross my mind."
Claire's facade slips just a little, before she pulls it back in place. "It's fine. I know it was necessary. Can I please just go?"
"Hey Cas, I need you to call me back as soon as you can. I'm taking Claire to the hospital. Hey hey, don't move sweetheart, I'll get you. I think it's her appendix. Just call me back as soon as possible."
When Dean pulls up at Cas' apartment building, he doesn't linger and hurries up the stairs to the apartment. He just needs to get in, grab his shit, and get out. There are too many memories here, and it already hurts. Maybe this was a bad idea, but he's here now and he needs to just do it.
"Cas" Dean's voice breaks. "Just give me five minutes. After five years of marriage, can't you just give me that?"
This kiss is completely different than their first one. Where that one was slow and gentle and exploring, this one is hot, searing, full of want and need, and Cas loves it. He lets himself be taken, opening his mouth to Dean's tongue.
"Thanks Claire. If he ever needs work, send him my way. I hate this shi- stuff. Sorry, bad habits." Though he has no qualms about cursing in front of his own kid, he doesn't know how Claire's parents are about it.
Once inside the foyer, Dean turns to Cas to ask if he wants something to drink or anything, but Cas is on him in a second, mouth devouring the words Dean hadn't gotten a chance to say.
Cas reached down and pulled Dean's boxers back over his softened length, rolling off him. Cas reached over, and pulled Dean against him. "Time for you to sleep" he said.
Cas watches the door swing closed behind Dean and can't move. What just happened? He knew Dean would be upset if he saw Michael here, which is why he'd intended on having him long gone before Dean was due home, but for him to act this way? Cas doesn't understand.
"It's fine. Take your time." He says, and Emma grins as she turns around and heads back to her room. "I can just... wait outside." Cas turns toward the door.
Dean's watching him with an indiscernible look on his face. It's several moments before he speaks, and when he does, his voice is quiet. "Do you still want to die?" Cas is sure he can hear hurt in Dean's voice, and it breaks his heart.
Cas' heart fell into his stomach. This was it. Dean was going to tell him that he couldnt do this. That it was too much. That he didnt think they could make it work.
"Mhmm" Dean leaned his face down, nosing against Cas' neck, and heard Cas let out a small giggle. An actual giggle. He made an angel giggle. Chuckling, he pressed a kiss against his soft skin.
The possessiveness he feels overwhelms him. "Look at me Dean." When Dean opens his eyes, he growls "you are mine. You understand?"
Dean could see Cas' eyes light up at the words hed said. He just stood there and stared at Dean for a few moments, butterflies going crazy in his stomach, before crashing their lips back together. Cas kissed Dean with such intensity it took his breath away.
"Ah, that's Alex, she goes to school with them. She's a good kid. Had a rough family life a few years ago, and the Sheriff, Jody, got her out of there and ended up adopting her. Turned her who life around."
"It was more than that." Emma says, and when he looks at her she looks almost smug, which is a foreign look on his daughter. Claire must be rubbing off on her already.
Cas didnt answer for a moment. "We will have to discuss this, Dean" he said, and Dean could feel him tensing up again under his hands.
In answer, Cas kisses him again, pressing down, letting himself get lost in the feeling. He thrusts against Dean over and over again, pulling sounds out of Dean's mouth that spur him on as Dean's hips move up to meet him each time, their tongues tangled together.
Cas pulled his head back, looking into Dean's lust blown eyes. He smiled a little, then roughly crashed his lips to Deans, rolling his hips so that his hard cock rubbed against Dean's. Dean moaned loudly, attempting to move to gain more friction. Cas stopped moving, holding Dean's body in place.
"Yeah, yeah. I know." Dean laughed. He pressed a light kiss to Cas' lips, then turned around and headed for the fridge while Cas took their coffee to the table and sat down.
Once Dean's in his car, he takes a minute to catch his breath. His heart is pumping with adrenaline, he's shaking a bit, and he's pissed. As he starts to calm down, he feels worse and worse over what happened. Not over Gordon, but because of all the trouble his date caused tonight. Dean takes a few deep breaths, then climbs out of the car and heads back into the restaurant, hoping that Gordon is gone by now.
"Alright people, listen up. I'm going to take her to the hospital, then I'll get you all where you need to go." Dean says loudly, taking the next turn toward the hospital.
Cas rolled his hips down, rubbing himself against Dean, and Dean moaned, throwing his head back onto the pillow. Cas kissed over to Dean's nipple, taking it into his mouth and sucking on it lightly. He felt Dean's hands in his hair, tugging on it, and a groan escaped his own throat.
Dean gripped onto Cas' back, clinging to him, trying to control his breathing. Cas paused, but Dean shook his head and whispered "dont stop."
At this point Dean was pretty sure he was about to have a full blown panic attack. Love? Fuck. Love. Do i even really know the meaning of that word when it comes to relationships? Dean thought to himself. Does Cas even know what hes saying?
"That seems to be the problem. In the future, you are to apologize for your thoughtlessness and inconveniencing them, and do what you need to do to make it right. That is all, you may go." Naomi says with a wave of her hand.
"You look uncomfortable Dean. You should relax a little" he said, smiling, throwing Dean's words back at him.
Emma smiles then. "I figured you would. Anyway, what I was getting at was that we already have a group project coming up, and I was wondering if she can come over tomorrow to work on it?"
"Yes. She keeps asking how it's going. She wanted to make sure you liked it. I havent responded since we were on our way to the museum. I was informed that texting while on a date is impolite." Cas said.
Dean slid out from Cas' arms, and stood up. "You coming?" He asked, looking back at Cas still laying in the bed.
Cas worked his finger around, loosening Dean up, all the while kissing Dean, trying to take his mind off the new intrusion.
"Mhmm" Sam mumbled, as he finished cleaning the machine. "I'll do this, you just go get the movie started. It's already on the TV."
"I'm not miserable, at least not here. As long as I can come home to you, I'm happy." Dean says, forcing a smile that he almost feels. He leans forward and presses his lips to Cas', before turning and gulping the rest of his beer down. "I'm not really hungry tonight, so I'm just gonna shower and head to bed." Dean says, dropping the bottle into the recycling.
Cas adjusted himself so he was sitting more sideways, opening his legs a bit more and dropping his left leg off the couch onto the floor.
Claire laughs. "Sure thing." She shoots him two finger guns back, then both girls turn and head back to the foyer and up the stairs, laughing as they go.
Dean looks down at the floor and let's the whole story spill out, from the harassment to getting punched to the warning paper and his unplanned abandonment of his job. Cas listens silently, and when Dean's finished he doesn't say a word for a minute.
He hasn't been out to get anything new in a couple weeks, so he figures there's probably a good batch of things out there for him to find.
Cas flicked his eyes over to Dean, and saw him pull away from Anna, turning to look at him with a brilliant smile on his face. "Heya Cas."
Cas nodded. "That was my intention. I didnt realize you'd drink yourself into a stupor over it. I thought you'd be with that... woman." Cas all but growled the last word.
Everyone behind him mumbles agreeable noises, except one person. He hears a man loudly exclaim the inconvenience and unprofessionalism of this. Dean takes a glance at him in the mirror when he stops at a red light. The guy is older, wearing a suit, balding, and has a disgusted scowl on his face. Dean rolls his eyes to himself, and continues on his way to the hospital. Fuck that guy. If somebody can't understand a woman in fucking labor, that's their problem, not his.
Suddenly Courtney came sprinting into the war room from the library doorway. She stopped and looked at them both, then nodded. "Perfect." She said, before turning back around and walking out.
"Morning ladies, grab a seat, breakfast will be ready soon." Dean says, pointing at the table with his spatula. Emma gives him a 'why are you so happy' look before sitting at the table, and Dean just turns back to the stove and sings along with the music, unable to wipe the smile off his face.
The hurt and sadness is overpowering him again, and he let's it wash through him for half the drive. After that, he pushes it down and let's himself be angry. Anger is good, it doesn't hurt so much.
When he looks up, Cas is still smiling a little but his face has a hint of shadow on it. "Hey, the whole 'in the zone thing', it's okay you know?" Cas tilts his head quizzically, so Dean shrugs and continues. "I didn't know, but I know now. It's what you do, it's part of who you are, and whoever you're with should accept that. If they can't, well" Dean shrugs again. "It's their loss."
When he kisses back to Dean's neck again, Dean says "I think I might have a condom in my wallet, but it's been a really long time so I don't know if it's any good."
When he looks to Claire again, she says "yeah, thanks." And she and Emma take off down the hall and out the front door, leaving Dean to walk Cas out.
"Yes. If she is going to be a friend of yours, then I would like to get to know her." Cas said, taking a sip from his cup.
There are tears on Dean's face, and he swipes at them. "I couldn't let him hurt you. And I couldn't leave Sam there on his own with him. I was the only thing stopping Dad from hurting him too." Tears are falling freely now, and Dean just let's them. "I'm so sorry, Cas. Giving you up, giving up the only person I've ever really loved, was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I had to."
"Well, she somehow keeps getting into my workshop, and managed to get red paint on her head, so I thought the name was fitting."
Dean watched Courtney slowly set her burger down, put her elbows on the table, and lean forward. She contemplated for a moment, watching Cas. "You're either not joking, or you're a very good liar. I pride myself on being able to tell when someone is being truthful." She studied him some more. "But I cant tell with you."
Flashes of last night kept running through his head. How Dean had fallen asleep in his arms. How he woke up and started kissing him. The way his hand had traveled down his body, into his pants. Cas shivered, remembering Dean's hand around him.
By now, Fern Guy is wiggling back out from under the seat, a triumphant look on his face and a chicken in his hands. Dean reaches down wordlessly and takes it, putting it into the cage too, before helping him off the floor.
Without saying a word, Dean strode over to Cas and pushed him up against the door. Feeling a need he couldnt explain, he pressed his lips against Cas'.
Cas pulls out almost all the way, then pushes back in, starting a rhythm of thrusts, and Dean sobs with relief, pushing back against him each time. He leans over Dean, pressing kisses into his back, shoulders, anywhere he can reach. He bites down, and Dean groans, fists clenching, head thrown back.
Jack looked between Cas and Dean. "Sam said you were back, so I thought I'd come find you. He said I shouldn't, but... I see now he was right. You're busy. I can come back later."
Might as well watch something, he thought to himself. He sat down on the couch. Flipping through movies until he saw one one that looked mildly interesting, he adjusted himself into a more comfortable position, settling in for a long night of worry.
It's not like he's never seen the guy before. He's not exactly a regular, but on occasion Dean picks him up from different spots downtown, and the guy gets off at the same stop on the outskirts.
Before he can gather his thoughts and say anything, Gordon starts in, not looking up from the menu. "Yes, we'll take two glasses of yourÂ Heitz CellarÂ Cabernet Sauvignon." Which, okay Dean doesn't really like red wine, but he can appreciate a man taking a forward approach, kind of. And it's not like they've talked about drink preferences yet.
With those words, Cas let it all go. Every inhibition he had. Everything hed been holding back. He felt a pull low in his stomach, and then the most amazing thing hed ever felt was coursing through his entire body. Waves of pleasure washed over him. He let off the most intense moan Dean had ever heard, into Dean mouth, as Dean continued to kiss him and stroke him until Cas' entire body was spent.
"I hid something because it's embarrassing and I'm ashamed of it." Dean says, rubbing his hand over his face. "I wish I would've just told you, but I didn't know this would happen." Dean drops his hands down into his lap, clutching his bag as he looks at the wall. "I like wearing underwear. Women's underwear. It turns me on, and sometimes, when you're not around, I-" Dean sighs. "I touch myself while wearing them." Dean's face is red, blush covering him down to his neck.
"Yes, it is. It's amazing. You're amazing." Cas kisses him again, then pulls away to look at it. "Seriously, it's perfect."
"I dont know. I just know hes hurt. Let's go. NOW." Cas all but yelled, rushing to the bunker door. The next 15 minutes were probably the longest of his life. The whole way, Cas cursed the fact that hed lost his wings and couldnt immediately come to Dean's aid anymore, in between Sam throwing questions at him.
They shower, have lunch, and curl up on the couch together, spending the rest of the day watching tv and just enjoying each other's company.
Once Cas has three fingers in, stretching Dean and working over his prostate on every other pass, Dean is a hot writhing begging mess and it's the most wonderful thing Cas has ever seen. His own cock is hard and leaking and he's never wanted anything more than he wants to be inside Dean right now.
She takes the couple of steps toward him, and pulls him into a hug that feels like she's trying to squeeze his breakfast out of him. It's awkward and he's uncomfortable, but he put his arms loosely around her anyway and pats her back. "Hello." He says, and it even sounds awkward. How can one word sound awkward? Cas sure as hell knows how to do that without even trying.
Cas takes a minute, then looks at him. "It happens sometimes. I get caught up in my work and, well it's not like I forget exactly, I just don't notice how much time has passed." Cas shifts again nervously. "It's, uh, been a problem in the past."
"Yeah, I knew him. We went to highschool together for a little while." There, that should be enough.
They stood just staring at each other for a moment, before Sam said "we should get out of here, before the cops come. The cashier is dead behind the counter. You two head on back, I'm gonna erase the surveillance footage then I'll be right behind you." Sam leaned down and picked up the demon knife.
Now that he's sitting here, he lets the tears he's been suppressing fall. Everything hurts, his chest, his heart, his head. He knew there was a chance Cas didn't feel the same, but to come home to
Cas wedged himself in between Dean's legs, pulling him right to the edge of the desk and up against him.
When he looks up at Dean's face, Dean is watching him with a small smile, and Cas has to force himself not to return it by biting his lip. He looks away quickly, and layers lettuce, tomato, and onion, and a small amount of ketchup onto his burger.
He stands there, leaning against his desk, just breathing. What the hell was that? God, it's been so long since he's been subjected to one of Cas' intense stares, and it's left him breathless, heart pounding. How can one fucking look do that?
Cas grabs ahold and slowly, so slowly, pulls Dean's pants down, revealing his prize for being so patient.
Dean is only slightly surprised that this is Emma's new friend. She's always been a very inclusive person, and though they seem like opposites, he knows that would never matter to her.
Dean opened his eyes, looking around. "Cas" he breathed, eyes landing on Cas' face, just inches from his. Dean started to sit up.
"Son of a bitch" Dean said, walking over to the liquor cart and pouring himself a large glass of whiskey.
Tears are streaming down Dean's face again, and his eyes are still closed, so Cas leans forward and very gently places a kiss to his lips. He pulls back a little and wipes Dean's tears from his eyes and cheeks as Dean's hands come up to rest on his hips.
Cas doesn't look at him, continues to stare at the tv though Dean's pretty sure he's not actually watching it. "I told you I was happy you're here." He says.
The only reason Dean and Cas are even still friends is because Cas finally came to his senses, left Michael, and begged Dean to forgive him for abandoning him. Of course Dean had, but Cas promised he was done with him and would never go back.
Grabbing ahold of Dean's hips, Cas spins them around and pushes Dean backward until they hit the bed, then gently pushes against his chest until Dean is laying down. Cas climbs over him, and kisses him again like his life, or his sanity, depends on it, and it probably does at this point.
Cas is smiling again, and it really is a beautiful sight to behold. Dean follows Cas back out into the restaurant and to the bar off to the side. They sit next to each other on the stools, and when the bartender comes over Cas looks to Dean.
"Okay." Dean says. He wants to pull Cas to him, wrap him in his arms, feel him warm against him and know that everything's gonna be okay.
"And then Claire said 'I'll tell you where you can stick it. And... Dad, are you even listening to me?"
Emma turns her pleading eyes on Cas now, and he knows how hard it is to resist so it's no surprise when Cas agrees and the girls are gone in two seconds flat.
Dean's eyes flew open, his heart pounding fast. He could feel something hard under his head, not his pillow. He laid still for a moment listening, and heard a breath being drawn in. He looked up, right into Cas' face, just inches from his own. His head was on Cas' chest, and he could feel Cas' arm wrapped around him, running his fingers through his hair softly.
Dean nodded. "Okay. Well if you need anything, just shout." Jack gave one head nod, and walked out of the room.
"Yes. He just got back, I wanted him to know I'd be back to see him. He deserved that much" Cas replied.
"She looked like she was in pain after dinner, but she said it was probably just cramps and that she was fine. It just kept getting worse, and I don't think its cramps. She can barely move now, and she keeps holding her side." Charlie says, and Dean can see she's trying hard not to panic.
After what was probably hours of flipping through books, Dean casually slid his right hand under the table, and onto Cas' left knee.
As they're getting close, driveway coming into view, it starts to rain. A few trickles to start, but before long it's coming down in thick rivulets.
Dean wakes up the next morning and forces himself out of the warmth of Cas' embrace, heaving himself out of the bed. He has coffee, skips breakfast, and kisses Cas goodbye. Cas actually opens his eyes and pulls Dean into a deeper kiss which, okay, that makes the start of his day much better.
Dean gets up in the morning, makes coffee, gets ready for work, and kisses a sleeping Cas goodbye, just like every other day. It feels, not good, but not bad. It just is.
"Listen to me, because you need to hear this and you need to believe it, because like I told you, I don't say things I don't mean. Are you listening?" When Dean nods, Cas says what's he needs to say.
"Just let me finish. Please." Dean said. When Cas nodded, he continued. "I kissed her. I did it. I kept trying to push down the thoughts of what happened, and I figured if I could have the company of a woman, then it would help me."
"I knew you wouldn't try it if I told you what it was." Cas says, and he's absolutely right because why the hell would he try something that sounds gross. "You really should expand your tastes. Be adventurous. Live a little." Cas says, and now he's full out smiling his crinkly eyed toothy smile and Dean hasn't seen that smile in seventeen damn years and it melts his fucking heart.
Dean sits down at the table across from him, after Cas points to the plate, silently digging into the food. Cas wants to say something so badly, but the words are stuck inside him. He doesn't know if he can fix it, but he wants to. Dean is
Every few days to weeks, the guy gets on the bus, sometimes empty handed, but usually with another large item: a cello, a rocking chair, a deconstructed antique couch frame, an awful clown painting, a huge velvet Elvis (
There are exclamations from Emma and Claire, but Cas is looking at Dean like he knows something, and he probably does because, hello, Cas has always been fucking smart.
"Oh, he's my-" Dean started, but was interrupted by the bunker door opening. "Well, speak of the devil" he finished.
Cas flinches at the harsh tone of Dean's voice, but he deserves it. He deserves that and so much worse. Dean looks heartbroken, hurt, betrayed, and it's so painful it takes Cas' breath away.
"It wouldnt have been your fault" is of course Dean's reply, because the self sacrificing beautiful man can't see that there was nothing he could've done that wouldn't have caused Cas pain. He had to make a decision, and made the best possible one he could at the time.
He's unsure at first, because it couldn't be what he thinks it is, but the longer he looks the longer he knows he's right.
"If you're gonna hang out while I try to sleep, might as well be comfortable" Dean answered the unasked question.
He knew what it was though. The love in Cas' eyes, in the words he had said. They scared Dean. He knew how Cas felt, but seeing it was almost too much for him.
They make love, slow and lazy, neither rushing to climax, taking joy in each other. When they finally reach the end, Dean clings to Cas, and Cas clings back, silently letting the other know how much they're loved, needed, adored.
Suddenly the bedroom door opened "Dean, foods he.... Oh, wow, sorry. Should've knocked" Sam said, as he looked at each of them in turn. Both on opposite sides of the room. Dean, with a shirt halfway onto his body, and Cas with a ripped shirt in his hands. Sam couldn't help but laugh at the sight.
"We should shower" Dean says, and the fear is back. Dean seeing him naked, nobody's ever seen him naked. He doesn't think he's ready for that yet. But before it can consume him, Dean's hand is on his face, soothing, calming. "Separately, sweetheart."
"Coffee" he said, before digging in his drawers and pulling out a couple pairs of sweat pants. He tossed one on the bed for Cas, and pulled the other pair over his boxers.
Cas closes the minimal space between them, fingers grazing along Dean's jaw, and presses a soft chaste kiss to his lips. "There's no rush."
"Hey, I take offence to that. I'm not a random woman." Courtney stated, taking a sip from her liquor glass.
"I understand, but I disagree. There are plenty of things you can do that won't have you dealing with deranged people every day." Cas says, hands tangling in Dean's shirt. "Please just think about it. I can handle things for a while, while you figure it out. You're miserable."
By the time Dean pulls up outside Cas' house, he mostly has himself calmed down. Mostly. There's still a nervous buzz thrumming beneath his skin, but he pushes it down and gets himself out of the car and up the steps to the door before he can lose the nerve and just drive away.
The bar was only a fifteen minute walk, so Cas bypassed his car and enjoyed the stroll in the late spring air. The sun was setting, leaving the world in a bright blue hue. This was Cas' favorite part of the day, when everything was settling down, and the only noises were the crickets and the occasional car passing by.
Dean grabbed the bundle of dirty stuff again, and made his way to the laundry room, throwing them in and starting it up. Once that was set, he headed to the kitchen.
Cas is impressed. Dean was always very good with cars, but his own restoration shop is really something. "That's really great." He says.
"They did an ultrasound and confirmed its appendicitis. They've given her antibiotics along with the pain meds, and they want to do surgery as soon as they can. I guess it's pretty bad, and they wanna get it out before it ruptures."
Cas could hear Deans breathing even out. "Dean?" He whispered. He knew he was asleep. Cas leaned his head down and pressed a kiss to the top of Dean's head.
That's it, Dean's had enough. He stands up roughly, chair falling backwards in the process. "You know what?" He says, pushing out all his anger and hatred into his words. "Fuck that. And fuck you. I quit." Then he turns around and stomps out of the room, slamming her office door behind him.
Giving up on sleep, Dean takes his laptop out to the livingroom and settles onto the couch, starting it up and pulling up apartment search sites. He's found a couple places that seem promising, and he looks over them once again.
Without saying a word, Dean crowds against him until Cas' back is pressed against the door. The look in Dean's eyes sends a thrill through him, and it's only a moment before Dean's lips attach to his own.
Cas' heart hurts for him. And for Emma. What kind of mother wouldn't want her own child? "I'm so sorry." It's the only thing he can think to say.
"Yes. I've waited fifteen years for this. I'm positive." Cas replied. He was breathless, and all the could think about was having his hands on every inch of Dean that he'd admired from afar all these years.
"Will you stay, to sleep? I just, I'm not ready... I don't want to let you go yet." Dean says quietly, like if he speaks too loudly it will shatter the moment.
"No Dean. We made a commitment." Cas said, turning away from him and continuing down the hall with a smile on his face.
Dean slides his hands down his stomach to the button on his jeans, popping it open, then slowly sliding the zipper down. Cas bites down on his bottom lip in anticipation, fingers itching to hurry him along.
It was about an hour later when someone took the small stage in front of them announcing karaoke was about to begin. When Cas whipped his head over to look at Dean, Dean had a grin on his face.
"Yeah. Yes, that's fine. I don't need it till work on Monday anyway." Dean's staring up at Cas, and Cas is staring down at him, and they're just staring at each other for god knows how long before Claire clears her throat, and they both jump a little and look away. Cas takes a half step back, and Dean immediately wishes he hadn't, but he looks so nervous now it's probably for the best.
: I need you to come pick up Em and Claire for a "surprise girls day". Nails, hair, whatever the fuck you want, I'm paying.
Logically, Dean knows it wasn't all his fault, but that doesn't stop the pain and guilt from burrowing into his soul.
As Dean walked into the room, he locked the door behind them, and set the clothes on one of the benches. He went over to one of the stalls and turned the water on hot.
Emma gets up too, and Dean can see she's already dressed and ready to go, and he smiles a little at how much his daughter cares.
"You wanna come in your panties?" Cas rumbles into Dean's ear. Dean whimpers in response, and Cas slides his hand around until his fingers skim along Dean's cock through the fabric.
"I havent felt this rested in while, Cas" Dean replied. He walked over to the bed, stripping it of all the bedding. "I'm just gonna throw these in the wash. I'll meet you in the kitchen?"
Gabriel knows about Dean. He's always know about him, even while they were dating. He knows what Dean did, and was, surprisingly, one of the only people who helped him pull his shit together when Amelia got pregnant.
"Please don't leave me" Cas says, almost too quietly, but Dean stops and turns back around, and he repeats himself a little louder.
Dean looked at Cas, pressing a soft kiss to his lips, before Cas climbed off of Dean, sitting back on the couch.
"Well, anyway, thanks for having her. I'll pick her up tomorrow, she said she'd just text me when she's ready" Cas says, getting ready to turn toward the door.
Dean spent a while exploring every inch of Cas' exposed skin with his hands and his mouth. Kissing, licking, and nibbling all over. Once he was thoroughly satisfied with that, he unbuttoned Cas' pants and slid them off, leaving him in just his boxers.
"No, thanks" Dean replied, starting to get worried. Maybe he'd crossed a line. Maybe Cas doesn't feel the same way he does. Maybe he'd just kissed him back to be nice.
"Come on Dean! The way you look at each other? The way you both always find a way to stand right next to each other? I'm not blind... But that's not the point. The point is, if you want this, then you need to fix it. And soon."
Claire unbuckles her seatbelt, then turns to look at him when he doesn't turn the truck off. "What're you doing?"
Dean follows Cas outside to his car. "Do you want me to come back with you?" He asks, but based on the distant look on Cas' face he's pretty sure he already knows the answer, and his heart is racing waiting on it.
He misses... No, he can't go there anymore. It's done. It had to be done. Everything is broken, and there is no coming back from what happened.
"I can drop you off in the morning, but I have more work to do so I cannot stay, and you can't push me to stay like you've done every time." Cas says, giving her a stern look.
"I was just wondering, what happened, to Emma's mother." Cas says. He knows he's crossing a line here, but he can't go back now.
Before they can get too far, Cas follows them out onto the porch, and when Dean turns around Cas pulls him into a hug and says "thank you, Dean." Then he let's go and goes back inside, closing the door without another look.
"He wanted to know what happened to Emma's mom, so I told him, the shortened version of course. Then he told me about Claire's mom, and essentially told me I fucked up his entire life."
"Dean! Stop. Talk to me!" Cas is begging, and Dean can hear the hurt in his voice, but he can't stop.
Cas basically jumps off the stool. "I can go with the girls." Then he turns and follows them into the livingroom.
An hour later he and Emma are sitting at the kitchen table, plates of chicken fettuccine in front of them.
"Thank you." He says to Gabriel, taking it. "Goodbye." He says to both of them before walking out, determinedly not look at Dean again.
Cas' eyes flew open, and he jumped up off the couch. Something was wrong. Cas came tearing out of the room and down the hall to the library.
Cas shakes his head and rolls his eyes. "I-" he has no idea what to even say, so he huffs a humorless laugh. "Right. Okay, are you done?"
Dean starts to turn toward his car when Cas' voice stops him again. "But I don't want to reschedule." And wow, okay, that feels even worse.
Pulling away, Cas turns around and heads further into the workshop with Dean following. He stops at a bench, pulls out a small box and turns back. "You can say no, okay? But, I've been thinking a lot about this. You are amazing with your hands. The work you do, the things you can make out of wood, I've never seen anything like it."
"Shit" he whispered to himself, noticing Cas's clothes neatly folded on the end of his bed. He realized Cas was gonna need to change, but had nothing to wear.
Dean slid is hands down to rest on Cas' waist, gripping there lightly, as Cas gently pushed his tongue into Dean's mouth.
Dean pulled back a little and looked into Cas' eyes. "I, uh... I'm clean. I haven't been with anybody since I got tested last." Dean said quietly, blushing again. "If you, you know, didn't want to use this." He held up the condom.
Normally, Cas is the distant one. He doesn't mean to be, but he gets so caught up in his work that sometimes a half day goes by before he replies to Dean's texts, but Dean is always fast to respond.
Dean continued the kiss for a few more moments, before pulling away again. "Cas, calm down, its okay" Dean said, grabbing Cas' arms.
Cas shakes his head and smiles fondly at the closed door as he waits for the coffee to brew. Dean can be a mess sometimes, but Cas admits to himself that it's been nice having him here.
As he came to stop at the end of the tables, Charlie squealed "Cas!" And jumped up, hurrying over to throw her arms around him. "I can't believe you actually came. It's been forever." She said, slugging his arm.
They can be friends. They should be friends. They get along well, and their daughters are growing extremely close, so it's logical that it would happen. But he will not date Dean Winchester.
Dean nodded, and taking that as he was ready, Cas moved his hips back, slowly pulling his aching shaft almost all the way out, then back in. He did this a couple more times, very slowly, making sure he wasnt causing Dean too much pain.
Cas grunted, and continued walking. As he entered the hallway, he decided he wasnt quite ready to face Dean, so he turned into the kitchen, deciding to make some coffee or something. Anything to procrastinate the inevitable.
The backyard is large, trees surrounding it on all sides, with the large building toward the back right that he'd seen the night before, as well as a small shed next to it. It's quiet, peaceful. Dean can see the other chickens running around, pecking at the ground, but Lunch (
"Oh. Sure Sam" Cas said, moving to sit at the table opposite him. He removed his trench coat and blazer before sitting down, rolling up the sleeves of his white dress shirt. He pulled a book towards him and opened it, looking at the pages.
"Jack got more orders. I figured I'd go with him, and let you two... umm... work things out." He responded.
"Emma knows all of this, I've never hidden it from her. She knows I always wanted her, and that's what matters." Dean says, and Cas admires that greatly.
Letting out a breath, Cas pulls away from the house and steels himself for what is bound to be a very long and gruelling few hours.
Dean was left in just his boxers, and could feel a bit of nervousness creep in, the want coursing through him overpowering it as soon as he felt it.
They met at the restaurant because Cas felt weird having someone he doesn't really know knowing where he lives, and he didn't really want to be without his car anyway in case things did not go well.
Dean could feel Cas' hands digging into his back as he slowly stroked Cas beneath his pants, squeezing and loosening his hand at at the right times. He could do this, it wasnt much different than doing it to himself. Except it was so much better. Feeling Cas come undone beneath him was probably the biggest turn on hed ever had.
Dean turned and followed Courtney to his room. As soon as they walked in, she went right to his closet and started shuffling hangers around.
Cas reached down and slid his own bottoms off, exposing the rest of himself, and throwing them to the floor as well.
Once he hangs up, he stares at the phone for a minute before scrolling through his contacts and hitting send. Sam picks up after only two rings. "Cas?"
Dean is desperate, desperate to stop him, to get him to stay. If Cas is dating... shit. "Can we please just start over?" Dean asks quickly, but he's already sure what the answer will be at this point, because if the answer was yes then Cas wouldn't be leaving to go on a date with someone else.
Dean leaned in again, but this time Cas didnt pull back. Very slowly, Dean pressed his lips to Cas'. He slid the hand holding onto Cas arm up, and into his hair. Cas was tense, standing there not reacting. Dean pulled on his head, attempting to deepen the kiss. He could feel Cas' resolve failing, as he relaxed a tiny bit.
Dean gave Cas a look, then rolled his eyes again, shaking his head. "I guess I have to help, if Cas is. But be warned, I do this under protest."
Cas took a step towards him, and it took everything Dean had not to step back away from him. His breathing was now almost labored. Dean was pretty sure he was in the beginning stages of a panic attack.
Cas knew Anna liked Dean, it was obvious. The way she was always seeking him out, finding a reason to touch him, laughing and flipping her hair whenever he said something funny. Cas' stomach clenched in jealousy, seeing Anna's hand on Dean's arm.
Cas looked back to his book, unable to concentrate at all. He felt Dean's hand, putting more pressure against his hardness, rubbing up and down slowly now, at a regular pace.
She shifts around on the bed so she's facing him full on. "You're different people now, and you can't judge someone as an adult for something they did as a kid. He's a good guy, dad, and I think you could be happy." Claire settles back into the bed and turns the tv on.
Cas bobbed his head up and down, swirling his tongue along as he went. Then he pulled almost all the way off, giving a small suck to just the head. Dean thrust his hips up unintentionally, shoving himself back into Cas' mouth fully. He could feel Cas chuckle a little around him, which just added more stimulus.
"I need another drink" Sam said, standing up. He walked over to the drink cart, pulled a full bottle of jack from the bottom, and brought it back to the table. He sat down and poured himself a hefty glass.
"Whatever. Just sit down" Dean grumbled, grabbing a bowl from Sam and setting it in between he and Cas.
Shrugging, Cas looks away blushing. "You seem to like simple things with lots of flavor. Burgers, fries, I'd guess that you enjoy pie. And I saw you eyeing the beer section of the menu, before your date ordered for you."
Very slowly, Cas leaned in, giving Dean plenty of time to stop him, but Dean just stared down into Cas' blue eyes.
), a duck statue, a heavy concrete bird bath, several times he brings on large closed containers that Dean doesn't know the contents of, a toilet (
He rides it out, slowing down until he stops and slumps against Dean. Dean's arms come around him, and Cas lets himself be held for a few minutes before rolling off, disposing of the condom, and grabbing a washcloth to clean them up with.
"Yes, it would have been. It would've been a direct result of something to do with me. Dean, please just listen to me. I don't blame you. I forgive you."
His hands are grabbing onto any part of Cas he can reach, as Cas kisses back up and seals their lips together again. When they part, they're both panting and Dean thinks he's never been so turned on in his life.
Dean starts pushing down against him, so Cas slowly rolls his hips and Dean bucks up. His thrusts start slow, but build up quickly, punching breathy moans out of both of them.
Dean's breath quickened, and he felt like his heart was going to pound out of his chest. Cas said he loved him. Hed never said that. Well, there was that one time when he was dying, but he'd directed it at everybody including Sam and mom.
Cas walked a little further into the room, and turned to look at the TV. "Harry Potter? We watched some of these, didn't we?" He asked.
Things are awkward for a couple of minutes, but then Gordon starts talking about cars, and Dean remembers why he felt a connection with this guy. The conversation is flowing easily now, and Dean's getting more comfortable. He even tries a sip of the wine, and forces himself not to make a face or spit it out, because it's just
"I want nothing more than I want for you to be happy" Cas whispered, then brought his face to Dean's once again, softly pressing their lips together.
"Uh, sir? Her water broke." The same man says, and Dean mutters expletives to himself again. He is not delivering a damn baby, he's not.
Dean stands his ground, not budging from his spot blocking the exit, and dispatch informs him that another bus will be by to pick up his passengers and finish his route while he deals with the police.
After they've showered, Dean offers Cas some clean clothes but Cas declines. Dean heads downstairs, and Cas puts on his slacks and button up from the night before, carrying his jacket, tie, and waistcoat as he enters the kitchen a few minutes after Dean.
"Dont give me that crap Cas. I've know you a long time, you think I dont know when something's up with you? Spill it." Sam said. "If you're worried I'll run and tell Dean whatever it is, I wont. Whatever is said between us is between us."
"Cas, talk to me." When did Dean get so close? Cas could feel him, right behind him, his body a solid mass of warmth along his back. Cas wanted to yell and cry at the same time.
Dean attempted to pull his hands out of Cas' grasp, wanting to touch him badly, but Cas just gripped tighter.
Sam brought his coffee to the table and sat down next to Courtney. "So, why are you up so early?" He asked.
The day after that, Dean works the afternoon shift, so he has a nice morning at home with Cas, makes them breakfast, and heads out to Cas' workshop with him. He misses him when he's working so much, but he has to keep up with these hours for now. Cas has told him he doesn't need to work so much, that he makes more than enough to pay the bills and has been doing it by himself for many years, but Dean just can't do that. He's never one to shirk responsibilities, or live off someone else.
"Well now I have to change. I cant go out next to you looking like this" Dean said, looking down at his own clothes. He was wearing a clean pair of dark jeans, a black tshirt, with a green flannel over the top.
"Yeah. Well, sometimes people say things during an intense emotional situation they don't mean, so you can't really trust that." It sounds harsh, but it's not meant to. It's just meant to convey why Dean didn't think he'd want him here.
"I messed up and I don't know what to do," he's fighting back tears again, and has to swallow past the lump in his throat.
." Dean's voice is strained, and Cas feels deep satisfaction at tearing his husband apart so thoroughly.
Staying in Illinois, no matter how much he wanted to for Claire, just wasn't an option anymore, and when Gabriel had suggested they move closer to him, what else was he to do? He just really hopes Claire doesn't hate him for it forever.
Cas smirked, angled himself, and shoved in harder. Another shock coursed through Dean, who threw his head back moaning. Over and over again Cas hit that spot, causing Dean to writhe below him on the bed, as he let out moan after moan of pure ecstasy.
Dean just laughed and hit play on the remote, then reached over to the nightstand on his side of the bed and flipped the lamp off. The room was flooded in darkness for a few moments, then the movie started up.
After a bit, Dean nodded, indicating he was ready. Cas pulled back a little, still very slowly, and pushed back in. A few more times, and Dean barely felt the sting anymore.
told her it was fine too, but you know how they are. Extremely dramatic." Cas says, and boy does Dean know.
"Huh?" Dean pulls his eyes away from the laptop screen and looks at his daughter. "I'm sorry sweetheart, these numbers just aren't adding up. What were you saying?"
Dean's in the middle of another movie when he hears a knock at the door. It's late, so he's a little worried about it, and he pauses the tv and heads to the foyer to look through the peephole.
Feeling like he's going to be sick if he doesn't move soon, Dean steels himself, grabs up the flower, and heads upstairs. With shaky hands, he unlocks the door, hides the flower behind his back, and opens it, stepping inside.
"Well, Cas told her about our lives before the drinking. But yeah, basically." Dean said, taking a pull from his beer.
"Yeah, Cas, that's fine." Dean pulled out of the garage to the road, and Cas pointed him to turn right.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Cas asks, pulling back to look at him. And, of course Dean tells him.
In Dean's room, they silently strip down to boxers and tshirts and climb into the bed. Cas pulls Dean into his arms, Dean's head pillowed on his chest, and drifts off to sleep with his face pressed into Dean's hair.
Dean sighed, resigned that he really did need the help. "Alright. Just give me like 15 minutes to finish up, and I'll be in."
Cas picked up the pace again, slamming into Dean over and over. He reach down and grasped Dean's hard cock in his hand, stroking in time with his thrusts. Dean moaned again, hands digging into Cas' shoulders. Dean's legs tightened around him, and Cas knew he was close. "Come for me, Dean." Cas commanded, and seconds later Dean was spilling white hot liquid over his hand and all over his stomach.
Dean moved his hands down to Cas' waist, pressing him harder into the door, as he moved his mouth down Cas' jawline to his neck. Cas' hands went up, running through Dean's hair. As Dean sucked on Cas' neck, Cas let off a moan he couldn't hold in anymore. He could feel Dean growing hard against him, his own need pulsing downwards.
Cas takes in his daughter. He knows he's being worked over, but he can also see the tension and sadness hiding behind her usual look of contempt.
The man actually looks like his profile picture, and he's dressed nice. He's friendly and open, and is smiling a lot. Dean had read horror stories about people being catfished, so this is a pleasant start.
"Shes really great. We stayed up half the night talking and drinking. She has some great stories. And shes smart. Like, really smart, Dean. I didnt plan on, you know, but it just sort of happened."
"Because I told him the truth. And showed him I was telling the truth." Dean answers, shifting again. Cas notices a small bag slung over Dean's shoulder, but doesn't ask about it.
Naomi looks down at her desk, picks up a piece if paper and slides it across to him. Dean looks down, and sees it's a warning slip. A fucking warning slip for unprofessionalism.
When he gets back on the bus, it's to applause, which is very unnecessary but it feels good. He feels good. Smiling, Dean gets the bus back on the road and back on route. He's about fifteen minutes behind, but gets lucky with few passengers and little traffic and quickly catches up to schedule.
Everyone else on the bus is staring at the guy, but he's paying no attention, just going about his business like this is nothing unusual. It's really something.
Dean lifted his left arm, and slid it over Cas' shoulders, pulling him against his side. "I think... no, I know, this is the best date I've ever been on." He said, as he felt Cas lean into him.
Dean pulled his head back a millimeter, looking straight into Cas' eyes. "Come for me Cas" then he crushed his lips back into Cas'.
Cas did the same, grazing his eyes over every inch of Dean. Nothing would ever come close in beauty to what he was looking at. He looked down at Dean's own hard cock. He was bigger than Cas imagined, having only felt it through his pants.
"Hey, I went home. See." She gestured down to her different clothes. "But I wanted to see how it went, and Sam invited me back."
Dean climbed behind the wheel of his car, while Cas got into the passenger seat. He didnt say a word as he started the car and drove onto the road.
Dean moves on to tell Sam about his job offer to Cas, and that he'll need a contract for it, and after Sam's surprise and his "are you sure that's a good idea"s, he agrees to do it.
"Why did you come here?" Cas asks, making his voice as emotionless as possible, even while his chest hurts so bad he thinks he'll never recover.
Sam laughed. "Fine Dean. We're already packed so we're gonna head out now. We should be back in a few days. I'll keep you updated." Then Sam turned around and left the room.
Once Cas sits back, Charlie looks at him seriously. "Okay, what the heck is going on? You're here, like this," she waves a hand in Cas' direction, "and I haven't been able to get a hold of Dean in days."
Dean shrugged, chewing. He hated when people asked what he did, he could never come up with a good enough answer, without outright lying. He moved around uncomfortably in his seat, trying to avoid her piercing gaze.
"Oh honey, I know. Though how you could've missed it, I'll never know. Just like I don't understand how he could never see how in love with him you are." When Cas looks up at her with wide eyes, she smiles a little. "Neither of you are very good at hiding your feelings, except apparently from each other."
After fixing a cup of coffee, Cas heads into the living room and sits down, setting the steaming cup onto the coffee table and sliding Dean's laptop to the side, accidently pulling it out of sleep mode. It takes a moment for Cas' eyes to train on the screen, and when it registers what he's looking at, his stomach sinks, a frown pulling his mouth down.
"I understand, Dean. You need other friends. Though I dont like that you kissed her. It makes me feel this... bubbling inside. I cant explain it." Cas said, furrowing his brow.
This woman is a whirlwind of energy, and Cas really actually kind of likes it. It's refreshing, having someone be so exuberant.
"Look" Cas says, sighing and shifting on his bare feet. "I was nervous, so I started painting and I didn't realize how late it got. Please, come inside and just give me a few minutes to shower and change. I swear, I still want to go out." Cas looks down at the ground. "If you still want to?"
"Damnit. Dean, please just wait a second." Cas says, and Dean pauses putting the key in the door. He rubs his hand over his face then turns back around to see Cas halfway down the path, barefoot and all. "That's not... I didn't mean... Damnit, I'm sorry, I'm really bad at this."
Dean watched as she held out what shed found. It was a form fitting dark grey sweater, with a few buttons on the front at the top, and a black blazer.
"You had good reason to be, and though I can't say I'm glad you didn't do those things, I understand it now at least." Cas steps to the side a little, wanting so bad to make his way around this barrier.
"I'm ready." Cas says, a smile curling up his lips before he leans in and presses a soft kiss against Dean's. "Yes, let's go."
Dean pulled up the next movie and hit play. He felt Cas moving around a little. "You okay?" He asked.
Alright, well that was the most drawn out rejection he's ever had, Dean thinks as he backs away from the door, the chicken easily sliding off his foot as he goes.
He looked at the clock, and figured he had plenty of time to freak out then pull himself back together before he had to be there.
After several minutes of the most intense kiss hed ever had, Dean pulled back just a little, resting his forehead on Cas'. He closed his eyes, and said "I need you Cas. Fuck me. Please."
Cas feels anxiety filling him, can tell it's getting harder for him to breathe, but he can't calm himself down.
Cas sighs, and pushes past Dean, embarrassment flooding him again as he paces into the apartment, before turning back to face him. "I mean exactly what I said. I wasn't 'saving myself'" he uses airquotes then quickly drops his hands, knowing how stupid it looks. "I just, I've never-" he groans and drops his face into his hands.
Cas sighs and rubs a hand over his face. "Can we please not do this today? I'm really tired, and really not in the mood to fight with you."
It starts gently, like the first one, but quickly heats up, Cas' hands tangled in Dean's hair, and Dean's wrapped around Cas' waist. It feels so good, Dean feels so good, and Cas thinks he could spend forever just kissing him.
"Alright, that's settled. Let's go." Dean said, standing up, grabbing his jacket off the back of the chair, and struggling to put it on.
"You're everything to me, Dean. Before you, I was nothing but a shell, going through the motions every day but not really living. You taught me how to live, how to love, how to be myself, and I can't imagine spending a moment of my life without you. I love you." Cas takes in a shaky breath and opens the box. "Will you marry me?"
Cas leaned down over Dean, pressing soft kisses to his lips. "Are you sure?" He asked. He wanted this so bad, more than anything, but he wasnt going to push Dean into something he wasnt ready for.
--'Yes I remember! I was hoping you'd text. What happened with Cas? Did you explain? Did he understand?'
"Hello Dean, Emma." Cas says, looking all gorgeous and staring down at his own daughter with suspicion.
They work together easily to pick the TV up and carry it the block and a half to the closes bus stop. It's heavy and bulky, but Cas seems to have no trouble at all, muscles straining against his shirt as he lifts it. It's a great sight, but Dean has to pull his eyes away to concentrate on where he's walking.
Cas ground down against Dean, and heard Dean let out a beautiful moan. He really enjoyed making Dean make that noise. He pushed down again causing more friction. He felt Dean grip his bare back, blunt nails digging in.
"Cas, that's enough." Dean said, turning towards him. Dean was pretty sure he was trying to scare her off. Or, at the very least, make her think he was crazy.
Surprised, Dean stood there for a moment before wrapping his arms around Cas and pulling him against himself.
The next day Dean doesn't have to work, so he sleeps in, snuggled up against Cas, basking in his warmth. He misses this, a lot.
Sometime in the afternoon, Cas' phone rings. He sets his book down, grabs it off the couch next to him and answers it without even looking.
He leaves the house and starts driving to work. The closer he gets, the more unhappy he becomes. This isn't an unusual feeling, but it's not really been this strong before.
"I'm sorry, I just have a lot of work to get done today." Cas says, and he does actually sound disappointed, which just confuses Dean more.
The love Cas feels is beyond words at this point. This is everything he's ever wanted, and he won't let it go again. Won't even give it a chance to fail.
Dean thought for a moment, then leaned forward. He had to be honest with Cas. Not telling him things had caused him to almost lose him several times. "Cas?"
"I fucked up so bad, Cas. I know that. But I-" Dean stopped, and took a breath, feeling the butterflies start up again. "I dont want someone else. I shouldn't have needed to kiss someone else to realize that. I'm so sorry."
"Yes, Dean. I'll see you then." Cas hung up the phone and sat back on the couch, feeling the swirl of nerves and excitement that Dean always made him feel.
