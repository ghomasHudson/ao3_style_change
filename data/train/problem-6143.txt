Steve feels the heat on his face and wishes he had his dish towel to wring in his hands. Instead, he settles for rubbing the back of his neck. “Oh really?”
She kisses each of his cheeks and then slips her arm through his elbow and leans into him as they stroll around the room. “We miss you, too. There was a disturbance at the brothel.” She keeps her words low, almost whispered.
“No, it isn’t,” Bruce said. “It might break, if-.” He stopped himself before he laid those words out in the universe. But Tony wanted to know, he needed to know. The idea of death within the pack scared the hell out of him and shit he’d only been in the pack for a few hours. Not even a handful of hours yet. Bruce continued, “But right now, we need to worry about Steve’s wellbeing.”
In the aftermath of battle, Tony suffers the consequences.
“Been hit,” she replied. “Fuck that hurts. What did Stark do?”
Steve drops the cup and it splashes down Tony’s chest. “Sorry, damn, sorry.” He searches around for something and finds it – a rag – to dry Tony. “I didn’t hurt you, did I?”
“Tony,” Pepper stopped and sniffled. “You don’t enjoy sex with me.” Pepper went to the next drawer and emptied it out. “Please don’t. Don’t say anything because it will just -.” She choked on her words and shook her head.
Both Bucky and Sam will try and convince him to stay with them for a few months, but that’s not happening. He needs to stretch his legs; he’s been hiding too long. When Peggy died, part of him withered and dissipated with her. He thought he would never love again. He holed up in an attic apartment like some Bohemian from a romance novel. It did nothing for his psyche and dug a hole in his chest deeper than getting to China. Meeting Tony changed all of that – moved him, filled him up. Instead of trudging through the days, he found himself jumping up and looking forward to what was next. The excitement of discovery and invention thrilled him. His art took on new forms and became more inspired because of it. When he’d been fired, Steve lost all of it.
“Like he’s the center of our universe?” Tony not only tasted the bitterness but felt it infect him. He thought he would be happy. But the idea of so many people jostling in his head and that he – Tony Stark – would center his life around this one person. That Steve Rogers and he were Beloved for one another seemed just this side of crazy.
“Structure to keep his integrity intact!” Tony’s expression brightens with elation. “Yes! He has to keep some structure otherwise his continuity and integrity will crumble. We can latch onto that – for as long as we can to find our way to the Passage and the Hub.”
He turns to the clone of himself, of Natasha. “You can’t do this. This isn’t what happened. You both -.” He stops himself. “You know it, Ultron. Tony don’t believe them. Don’t think I saw it. I never saw it.”
Steve smiled and then offered his hand. “I can give you protection. We can give you protection. One of the reasons I’m going to New York is to bring the team and the soul pack together.” For the first time since he set out, he accepted it as truth. “I can’t promise you the soul pack will bond with you. I can’t. But I sure as hell want you on my team. If we do bond, I can tell you that I am dedicated to the pack. I want it to work. It’s a safe place to land, outside of SHIELD. And I can assure you it isn’t Hydra.”
The guards usher the prince and his entourage into the luncheon room and it opens up structurally more than the passageways to it. The ceilings are higher and embedded in them are viewports to see the stars and a partial view of the nebula. It’s lovely, but not as beautiful as Tony’s ship. It’s missing the sleekness of the Avengers ship and the grandeur of design. Prime Station pales in comparison to Tony’s design. He glances gratefully at Tony – even though the prince doesn’t know it, he’s impressed Steve in so many ways.
“That’s bullshit.”
“I told you the other day that I’m not – I’m not going to be like that. That I made a promise and I intend to keep it.” The whole time he speaks, he concentrates on stirring the milk on the low flame.
Blind spots flickered in his field of vision as he turned to look at Tony who stood right next to him. In quiet voice, Tony whispered, “Hey.” Somehow he read that the mood shifted and Steve battled those inner demons again.
“It has to be more of a promise,” Bruce said. “I can’t have anyone controlling the Hulk.”
“It’s easy. The world would see me as less. My company would get a boon out of it at first and then it would slowly collapse. Or that’s what all the analyses said when I ran them years ago,” Tony says and sinks further into the calming massage.
“Sheriff,” Tony says and stands as well. He fits so comfortably up against Steve. It feels so natural and right. He closes in on Steve, their breath mingles. Looking up into Steve’s eyes, Tony searches for something.
It’s only later, much later when they know one another and when they are at peace with who they are than Steve asks Tony a question that changes everything.
“Do you think we’ll get the glasses fixed, the implant I mean?”
He’s at the door to the room before he knows what to say. As he enters, the doctor moves away from the single cot to reveal Bucky, sitting up, fevered and drained.
“Cho’s not coming. You don’t have enough data on her and the serum to have her walk into the room. She’s never coming. It’s just you and me. Ultron.” Steve clenches his hands.
“Howard fucked with so many different factions of the Conclave and beyond. He caused this war in a way, now we have to end it.” Tony throws his arm over his eyes. “For so long, I didn’t want this responsibility. I wanted to run away from it. But it landed in my lap anyhow and Howard made it worse. Worse than I could imagine.”
Tony kisses his temple and promises. He promises things he has no control over but to Steve it means the world to him. After they unwrap themselves, they move forward through the day at a dizzying speed. When they arrive at the clinic, a crowd gathers outside its doors. Some have signs protesting Tony’s procedure others have signs supporting him. Multiple vans with dishes on their roofs line the avenue. It’s a festival of the media. Steve sighs and Tony only pats his knee.
Steve finishes up his shower, shaves, and then dresses before he leaves the bathroom. He finds Tony dressed and ready to go. Clint has left the room with Steve’s bag. Tony sits on the bed; he’s facing the window – the blinds are open to a city he cannot see.
“Yes, sir.”
Steve picks up the paper and like anyone in his position ‘pretends to read it’. Tony gives him credit for actually staring at the eight-page document for more than a minute. In fact, it’s eight minutes almost to a second according to the data from his glasses before Steve tears his focus away from the document.
“Peter came over today,” Tony says and gestures for Steve to take the chair next to his at the fire. “I taught him about batteries. He’s a smart one.” They both settle into their separate chairs.
An arc of electricity like lightning crackled over the armor as Steve called again for Hill to alert Thor – asking for help. If anyone knew what the hell to do about lightning it would be the god of thunder. The Iron Man armor went rigid and all sound – the revving of the charge, the whirl of the gears – silenced. After a few seconds, Steve eased his arms from around Bucky and said, “Tony?”
Steve smiles, his eyes bright and his arousal on overdrive. It coils deep in his groin and the nanite pulse. “We could make that happen.”
“No, it doesn’t. We stay on mission. You programmed in more Doors, right? We use those to exit.”
Tony turns around, not wanting to see Steve’s earnest expression. “I think it is. You have cook duty. I’ll do the clean-up.” With that he crosses the room and climbs the staircase. He forces himself to keep his pace steady and not rushed but once he gets to his room, he closes and locks the door. He leans against it and releases a breath. He has to get out of here. He can’t stay here with Steve. Not the way he feels, not with the secrets he’s hiding.
Secured. Imprisoned.
“I thought there was no working,” Steve says.
Tony inwardly shivered, , and then turned back to Natasha. “Tell me what the hell is going on? I get a cryptic phone call from Ste-.” He paused because he never called Rogers “Steve”.  Not in front of anyone. Not now. Not like this. Their relationship didn’t work that way. “Cap,.I get this weird phone call from Cap telling me to get safe. And then he hangs up. Thank fuck, I’d been working on new armor. It barely got me here, but I fucking found him and flew him in. JARVIS about had an AI seizure trying to get me here.”
“I didn’t think that was the point. You asked me to wear shoe that would make noise,” Steve replied as Tony leads him into the dining room.
“Yes,” Tony agrees and there’s something easy and brilliant in his answer.
“No.” Steve bows his head. He can feel the press of the collar against flesh. “I went to a discrete place. T’Challa worked it out. It was a professional.”
“Come for the show?” Ross said and there was a greed in his voice, a tone that spoke of possession and gluttony.
Steve clamped his mouth shut. Clint was inferring, not telling. He only nodded in response.
Before Steve can turn around, Tony waves him back. “Do you want to see your drafting table and lab bench?”
“Nothing but sex,” Tony muttered, but scanned the paper all the same. Page upon page of psychological evaluation of Steve Rogers after being rescued and thawed from the ice. After a brief escape from SHIELD within the first week of his awakening, Steve Rogers was transferred to something called the Raft where he stayed for over 5 years under going assessment. “What’s this Raft?”
What happened today was a damned miracle. That man picked himself up off the ground, bloodied and beaten, composed himself and ended up at the meeting – literally directing and showing himself to be the omega warrior Tony needs and wants. Why? Like any puzzle, Tony can’t let it alone. He drops the tools and rushes out of the library and goes up the stairs, ignoring the servants and wait staff as he hurries to the presentation suite.
“This is fantastic,” he murmurs. He turns on the water and uses some soap to rinse the lube and nanites away. He wonders how they’ll stay in place during but figures Tony must have planned for that as well.
Surrendering, he crawls into the sleeping bag and cuddles close to the pathetic burner, trying to warm up enough that he can fall asleep. Even as a child, being cold hampered his ability to get comfortable enough to fall asleep. As he snuggles down in the bag, he smells the mixture of coffee, cologne, and sweat – distinctly Tony’s fragrance. It lulls him and he smiles. His eyes drift closed, and he dreams.
With more lube he pushes in the third finger. Tony writhes beneath them, hungry and greedy for him, his cock actively dipping against his belly. Steve bends forward and licks the pre-come. Tony sobs.
“The steps? They’re flat stones from the water’s edge. How can they be weird?” Tony says while internally counting. Five, six, seven.
“She’s not down, down.” Penny giggled and Tony only rolled his eyes. What he has to put up with as far as artificial lifeforms.
He sat frozen for a long time. Because the truth of the matter was – he didn’t know who ‘he’ was, the alpha she referred to. Was it Tony or was it Bucky? He didn’t bother reading any of the reference books. He left them there and walked out of the back room, from the library, and continued until he found himself standing and staring at Bucky’s icy tomb, wishing he was still in his own.
“It’s going to be a pivotal meeting though. Even though it’s not a formal meeting of the Conclave, the deals are made in the back rooms.”
“Well, a certain director who is very clearly dead and does not communicate from the grave asked me to escort you to where ever, since Hydra cells are still out to get you,” Clint said and glanced around Steve’s apartment. “You did get th-.”
“Are you sure, my lord?” Steven says in quiet tones as if not to startle him, and he hasn’t moved to Tony’s side.
The elevator doors opened knocking him out of his reverie and he walked out of the lift. The long, bright hallway, white and chrome with glass doors at the entrance to the med-bay, felt sterile but inviting. The walls had frameless oil paintings in the style of post-modern. Steve wasn’t sure he liked it much but it matched the highly stylized, futuristic look of the Tower. Back in the day a lot of hospitals had white and army green colors with metal framed beds. Welcoming was not a word he would use. The med-bay looked to be minimally staffed and he wondered how that would work if the team had a real emergency. He’d have to ask Tony, but that was something that could wait. He opened the door of the med-bay and several staffers – nurses – at the station peered up at him. What he assumed was a station actually looked more like a curved laboratory bench. And the nurses? Not nurses at all, he didn’t think.
I posted this but took it down because I thought 1. I couldn't really motivate myself to complete it, and 2. I really  wished I had placed it as a Stony story instead. It would have worked better with Bucky being lured to the dark side and Steve as his brother trying to bring him back. Alas, I did not do that. So this I consider one of my 'lost stories'. Here it is...
The Quin Jet’s engines awake, rumbling as the vehicle begins to hover. “Oh yeah. Just the once.” Tony snickers. “Mostly because if you mess up once it probably means you’re gonna die and so you can’t mess up twice.” Steve gapes at him and Tony barks out with laugher. “Don’t worry, sir, you’re in fine hands.” He pats Steve’s white knuckled grasp of the chair and then the Quin Jet swoops upward and out of the bay at the bow of the massive Avengers ship.
“Son of a bitch,” Tony said. He almost refused the call. What the hell did Fury want from him? A letter signed in blood that he was out of the heroics business and the Avengers would have to look to Rhodey for their air support since Thor happened to be AWOL (Tony did keep up on things – though only as anyone in the public could. Any person who could hack databases, that was). “Go ahead. Put them through.”
“We might need your voodoo hands for defense,” Clint replied and ducked out of the cell again.
“It’s the only way. We can’t sign the dotted line without a say in how it’s going to work, Tony. You saw what happened with SHIELD. Completely overtaken with Hydra. How would you like to be doing their work again? Or someone even worse?”
“Seriously, why are you here?”
“Neither and both,” Steve replies. “I need you to find out his plans. Can you do that or not?”
Natasha volunteered for the couch. Somehow or another even with Tony gazing intently at him, Steve ended up with Thor – which was utterly ridiculous. They couldn’t even fit on the bed together. He barely slept that night, but it hadn’t been because of the lack of space, but the sleeping arrangements. He never admitted it to anyone, but every once in a while, Natasha would glance at him with that knowing look in her eyes. Sometimes he wanted to know what she knew because he hadn’t a clue.
Tony checks out the area. He can’t see any shelter. He shouldn’t be planning on staying here any longer than he needs to – and he isn’t, but from his work today, he knows it will take a while to get the HUD functioning again. He needs a safe place to work. Once again, he considers the poppy fields. Going for help is probably the saner way to go. These are farmers who grow poppies for illicit drug production. A stranger will not be looked on favorably. He’s safer off on his own. He looks at Blu. Well, not on his own. He has Blu.
Steve slowly jostles Tony over to the armor and urges him to get in. "Doesn't matter, we don't have time for that now."
“No, it doesn’t,” Tony said and kept his gaze fixed on Steve. He didn’t dare break this moment with glib responses.
He refused to be thwarted. "I'm going to do this. You can either support it or not. This has been going on for far too long."
Tony had the audacity to laugh at him and Bruce only scowled at Tony in return, but it was Strange, again, who answered, “As I said, I am afraid this is all of my fault. Or is the result of me saving the universe and Earth. I cannot disclose when it happened. As for you not knowing that soulmates or soul bonds were a reality, as I said many facts in this world are labeled fake or a conspiracy theory. Soul packs happened as a result of what I did.3”
“Sheriff Rogers, I’m just, I’m here to get my horse taken care of.”
The look on Tony’s face, the betrayal, the hatred, and hurt speared through Steve and took root at the same time. It wouldn’t let him go. It defined him in those moments and still does today. He hadn’t meant any of it. Bucky had never bonded to him. There was no truth to it. Why had he lied? Why did he obfuscate? He hadn’t meant to betray anyone. He never wanted to see the hurt on Tony’s face. But the escalation and the fear ended up motivating Steve.
After a quick knock on the door, Natasha walked straight into Fury’s office without awaiting an invitation. Fury sat at his desk in that infernal black leather coat, eye patch gleaming in the afternoon sun. “Did you speak to him?”
“It wasn’t supposed to work this way,” Sam says but he’s not looking at Tony. His arms are crossed over his chest, protective, worried. “It wasn’t supposed to be dangerous.”
Tony set about digging through the old safe with all of his father’s papers and notebooks. He knew his father obsessed over things from the A-bomb to finding Captain America. Yet, he never expected to find much on vampires and their biochemistry. The little he’d found right after he’d became a vampire turned out to not be very enlightening and somewhat prejudicial. It hurt to look at – maybe he had been hoping for some kind of acceptance through the yellowed pages. What he’d found discouraged him and he locked all the papers away.
“Tony?” Steve asked. The tension he held in his shoulders shifted through the bonds. The energy wave frequency grew more rapid, stronger.
“I tell him every day. You gonna be okay?”
He cringes. Coming clean with the truth eludes him. “Yeah.”
“What?” Steve says and wonders if Tony is diagnosing himself. “I know you’re probably in shock because of the cold water. You’re going to freeze to death, both of us are going to freeze to death if I don-.”
“Can I help?” Hill asked.
“He read our thoughts, we’re pretty sure. If he hacked his way in, then-.”
The clock ticks.
Before he catches up with the action around him, Doctor Cho is speaking to Tony, “The gland is not in the greatest condition. Parts of it have gone necrotic even though it was properly stored. We’ve done the best we can with the process. I’m most concerned about the nerve bundle or stem. It has the worst damage to it.”
“How’d you-.?” And that’s when Tony sees the faded mark across Steve’s shoulder; there’s a split in his t-shirt and a welt the size of the butt end of a gun. He also notices the telltale signs of bruises on his jaw and fingerprints on his neck. “Turn around and lift your shirt.”
A fleeting look of doubt crosses Steven’s face, but he’s not backing down. “I won’t kowtow to you. If you are what you believe, then you won’t do this.”
Maybe…
Steve thought about it, turned it over in his head. “But you always rest and get your energy from twilight?”
He should have gone directly to the kitchen to search out Steve and find out what the hell was going on, but instead he slipped into his study. It was a room in the expansive house he rarely used because he preferred his laboratory and workshop. This place reminded him of his father with its tall bookcases and lines of books. Sure, he loved books, but this room usually meant that he needed solitude, and something was wrong. Within its walls contained all of his father’s notes and secret government projects. Of course, his father and mother died long before he was transformed. Yet, he knew his father might have had his hands in something as vital and intriguing as the idea of immortality.
Steve sighs. “Listen, Nat-.”
Tony jumps away. A man – a naked man – is standing in front of him – where Blu laid only moments before dead. He puts his hand up as if he has the gauntlet on it, but he cast it aside when Blu saved him from the snake.
“Then I need whatever you can get on Tiberius. Something is up, and it isn’t good.”
“Hope Clint got that old bucket away or we’re not getting out of here,” Sam says and yanks out his blaster rifle. “You ready?”
The lion yawns and settles down, his face perched between its massive paws.
Tony nods and Steve slowly takes his hand away, though keeps it up cautioning him to keep his mouth shut. Tony only mouths, “Who?”
Too many words. Tony scratched at his scalp, messing his hair. “Bruce, just settle down.” He rubbed at his eyes. His head pounded and swam with competing priorities.
“That bad?”
Natasha’s having none of that. “He’s not over you.” He hears the whisper of her brown-tan boots on the tiles. She stands right beside him. “He’s not.”
“You see, dear Sheriff, sometime ago during the war, I ended up a changed man. I won’t get in to that at this point, but it did leave me with a very different view of the world than my father or his associates.”
“Well, then let’s start. I’ll see Vision in two hours,” Steve says. They all file out and Steve stands helplessly at the foot of the bed, gazing at Tony as he finishes keying in the download sequence.
“There’s nothing wrong with being attracted to another guy, Steve. You know that, right?” Natasha’s hand squeezed his bicep. Their two marked hands still clasped together.
He quickly picks his way through the clutter, hurries down the hallway, and slips into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Leaning against the door, Steve lets out a breath. Obviously, the prince is upset with him. He must be disappointed to see such a skinny, ugly thing walk in the door calling himself a sex worker. Steve bets the prince is calling Natasha now to complain. Still if he isn’t, then he’s going to be extra angry that Steve’s not even prepped. Nothing worse than a client having to stretch him and prepare him.
She arches a brow and says, “How the mighty fall.”
“Good idea,” Steve said. “I like it. No one will get hurt and we’ll practice.”
Tony and Steve go shopping, spend time at a lacrosse game, and end up in the shower together. Along the way their secret starts to unravel....
CHAPTER 2
“Let me do something,” Tony says because if he can’t help, if Steve doesn’t allow him to even try, he may implode. “Please. I care. I know you don’t want to hear that, but I care.” He doesn’t add
Mates were difficult to attract because the human V-Corps harassed the vampire population all the time. During the last human vampire war, each side recognized the futility of a protracted battle for dominance. Humans died or were turned, and vampires went hungry or burned due to what had been misnamed the Blight. Tony read all about the histories of the wars as a human child. According to his vampire clan, Tony counted as a child barely out of the toddler stage as a vampire. He’d never wanted to join the undead but then Yinsen had no choice. The old vampire saved Tony’s life by taking it. He never held a grudge against Yinsen; how could he? The old vampire gave his life for Tony. Gave over the last of his blood to turn Tony and allow him the means to escape the terrorists who wanted to go far beyond the extremes of a war to eradicate the undead. He’d only been a part of the family of the undead for a little over ten years. Yet it only took four of those years to find his human mate.
“What?” Tony chews on his lip. He’s worried about Steve’s theory.
“I know something’s going on, Tony, and I hope you know what you’re doing. If he’s confused or sick, he needs medical help. If he’s Steve Rogers – that Steve Rogers – he’s going to need a lot of help as well.  While I think the former is more likely, I really hope it’s the latter, because seriously, I don’t want you hurt by someone who’s not predictable.”
“What’s that?”
She lifted a shoulder. “It’s how I grew up.” She seemed oddly comfortable about the turn of events. Considering her position, a link to someone so out of touch with today should be, at the very least, an inconvenience. She dusted herself off as he stood there feeling as if his arms were too big and his chest too large. Emanating from her, he only received a soft hum. Usually, he received a hard feedback loop that always gave him a headache, but not from her at all. The sound of her in his head warmed him. It felt both soothing and frightening – how very in control of her emotions she was.
“Where to?”
Natasha nodded and stood at ease. Somedays Steve felt like an observer of his own life and everyone else had more interesting parts, at least when it came to Natasha and Fury who seemed to hatch a plan without speaking to one another.
“An’Rossi is a damned jerk,” Tony says. “We have to figure this out. Strategy is our friend, sweetcakes. Have An’Pe’terus take the helm. He needs the practice.”
“Shit,” Sam says.
When they enter the shop guards in tow, the milling crowd stops and all eyes turn to them. They focus not on the entire entourage, but on Tony and by association Steve. One of the salespersons walks over to the prince and greets him with a heady salutation that drips with insincerity and Steve cannot even be bothered to listen to the man.
when he had no power to heal. He gathered Steve in his arms, but before he climbed to his feet, the shadows around him thickened as if he felt a membrane between worlds. He startled and held Steve closer.
“Stupid name for a horse, if you ask me.” Bucky replies but he places a hand on Steve shoulder, careful of the wound dressing. “Rest, I have some telegraphs to send.”
CHAPTER 5
Howard placed his chin in his hand as he studied Tony. “I have no idea. We just don’t have the proper technology to do it.”
“Depression does that to you,” Tony replied. He flopped his arms at his sides. Life as the undead sometimes felt excruciatingly boring. Endless days and nights.
“Tell you what, I will give you a job if we do this now. I will make you feel useful and you can do important things in the world,” Tony said and waved his hand as if he indicated the entirety of the existence. “Do this and you don’t have to worry about looking over your shoulder.”
That puts a brilliant smile on Sam’s face. He leans down after he yanks on his shirt. He kisses Steve and says, “See you soon.” Reaching into his pocket he hands Steve a pouch of credits.
“He’s a mess. He’s a maniac, he fucking tried to murder me.”
Steven smiles, and it is rueful and touched with melancholy. “I’m just an omega from the old world, sir.”
“Did Natasha have her powers then?” Steve asked, trying to finally pin down Natasha’s story.
“They are on their way, sir.”
Steve chuckled. “Yeah, we were.”
In the bed, struggling to get free, Clint ignored Steve. He thrashed and arched up, drool dripping from his mouth. This was one of the reasons Steve needed to get the pack under control, needed to know more than just what the books and wise men told him. He needed practical experience. He recalled as a new Captain America how awkward and unrefined his fighting style and strategic plans were, but now he had years of experience on his side. As a souler, as a leader of a soul pack, he was that young naïve Captain again, but he reached down deep into his fears and swept them away.
Standing by Steve earlier in the day and feeling part of something grander, something beautiful, had taken Tony’s breath away. Who wanted to be around a soul mate that hated him? He shrugged as he dropped onto his bed. Steve probably didn’t even hate Tony. Steve probably just didn’t approve in his old grandpa kind of way, because Steve Rogers only hated Nazis.
“I don’t know. I’m not his doctor,” Cho said and hurried to stand beside Steve. A nurse came into the room, her demeanor fierce but not unnervingly so.
“Well, you guys are Beloved and all that,” Sam said. He didn’t look at Steve as he spoke. “He was probably waiting for you to get your head out of your ass.”
Steve guffaws and then outright laughs. “Seriously?”
“But I think you are talking about some of the laws, the rules of proper society. There are laws-.”
For the first time in a long time, he both fears and cannot wait for the coming days.
Stunned to silence, Steve studies Tony and tries to ferret out if he's being fed a line or if the man is earnest in his tale. It's hard to tease out, but the tenacity of Tony vibrates in the room like pulses of electricity. He finds his voice. "You disappeared for some time during the war."
Tony gestured to Steve. “Then who the hell is that?”
Back in the main hall of the concourse, Tony rushes over to the treat vendor and points excitedly at the absurdly large popsicles. “I want a cherry one.” Tony winks at him and Steve rolls his eyes. “Cherry for both of us?”
Steve blinks his eyes as he tries to focus on Tony. His cock weeps with need to be touched but that’s not his call. The client always gets to call that unless there were previous arrangements. Steve pounds on the floor with fisted hands and throws his head from side to side. He needs it. Tony hits his prostate again and again. Steve’s gulping air, trying to breathe through the want.
“It’s Sheriff, now,” Steve says and finishes buttoning his shirt. He pulls out a kerchief from his breast pocket, and ties it around his throat.
Tony clasped Steve’s hand and that caused Steve to bring his line of sight to him. Tony brought Steve’s hand to his lips. He kissed the knuckles. “Mine, too.” He quirked a brow. “If I don’t count all those adolescent daydream fantasies.”
, the object of devotion. Without it the Imprint goes mad. It is widely considered a death sentence for the Imprint and the object of their devotion.
It called in a perfect sequence. And then he saw it strewn out around him in a haze of figures and equations, and the unification of it robbed him of everything – of his breath, his sight, his ability to think or process. It unified him.
Steve licked his lips. His mouth was dry and the thirst from the anemia nearly drove him crazy. He nodded.
Steve confronted him. He hates thinking about the argument that ensued. He avoids memories of it. It only makes him feel dirty, perverse, and disgusted with himself. He’d thought everything was going to be all right, that Tony remembered. All he felt like afterward was an abuser.
Tentatively, Tony stroked Steve’s hair out of his eyes. “They fed off you.”
“If Bruce would only let me out of this bed, and Pepper was such a brute about keeping me here, I could have come and visited you.” Tony smiles rich and devious. “Did you miss me?”
Tony shakes his head. “No.” He turns to face Steve. “It’s not. My father found it. Along with your shield. It’s at SHIELD.”
“It’s only a star, Tony,” Steve says.
“Yes, Tony, yes I am.”
As the water hit him, Steve closed his eyes and tried to pretend he didn’t want to sin again. But he wanted to – he needed to. “Beloved,” he had said and cursed himself. He washed up that morning and put it behind him. He needed to. There was no other way. Refocus, he told himself. He was the team leader. He had no other choice. Want and hunger were human frailties. He was a leader of a pack. He needed to narrow his energies to his team and his pack for the betterment of the world.
“Yeah, great deal. Let me tell you something, your negotiation skills suck,” Tony says and helps Steve toward the door. Tony glances at Rumlow, who lies unconscious with his dick out and burnt. He has no remorse for what he did to the prick.
“Jarvis I’m not a child anymore.”
Now, Tony had to face the world as T’Challa asked for a reprieve and security for all vampires and mates. If they couldn’t get that – then their delegation would enact the next phrase of their plan: activate mates as their way to change the world and become known as Divini the globe over.
Steve nods. “Yeah. Everything was. The moment I came out of that pod, I took a breath and it didn’t hurt. I could walk up a flight of stairs without getting lightheaded. I could swim. It was phenomenal.” He finishes his four eggs over easily with six slices of toast on the side. “It was a miracle what your dad and Doctor Erskine did.”
“Maybe,” Steve laughs as he speaks. “But maybe I just wanted to find something that I never ended up finding.”
Strange says, “We’ve tried. Even with spinal cord delivery, we’re unable to ensure an efficacious dose of the growth factors. The viral therapy we can do several doses with different packages for delivery. The nanites cause too much immune response. Even mitigating the dosage for immune tolerance hasn’t worked efficiently.”
“I am not at liberty to say, sir.” JARVIS replies.
“How that branch continued,” Steven says. “I wondered if they stayed together and if that Stark had children.”
“I heard that he’s also signed some documents that she’ll bare him an heir in the future if he does get married.” Luke throws another sash into the discard pile.
Tony glanced around and blinked a few times. “If you don’t mind some room service again? I’m a little - off?”
The voice sounds off, more mechanical than real and Tony realizes it is the omega again. He turns back to the omega and eyes him. “Yes, they will.”
“Finals are tomorrow. I still don’t understand how statistics tell you anything. I mean I can make the incidence ratios work whatever way I want.” Steve throws down his pen. It skids off the desk much to his chagrin. He sighs - dramatically.
Steve frowns but agrees. “Sure. We can check it out. Let’s go.” He puts down the pencil and waits – Tony takes this as his cue to lead the way.
The little mechanical device judders in Tony’s chest. It isn’t right – it’s not the way it is supposed to work. Steve has seen it enough times to know better. “How do I shock it? How do I get it to work better?”
Tony settles back on the lounger with his coffee and tablet. He focuses on his emails – which are numerous and painful. He knows he’s missing important R&D sessions at Stark Industries, but they can and should be able to function fully without him all the time. He sends a few curt emails to his second in command at the R&D department. Then he’s back to answering emails for Pepper. Those are at least easier. When he looks up Steve’s gone, he must have snuck out to finish dinner a while ago. The sun sets and the room darkens. He places his tablet on the lounger and picks up the two empty mugs.
“Maybe some day you can come down to my workshop and I can show how it really works,” Tony says and then begins to steer the ship toward the tiered port again.
He swallows down his concern and says, "How - can you tell me about Steve? I mean Captain America?"
“Sir, I’m sorry to have wakened you but Captain Rogers had a nightmare that has upset him.”
“Sorry. I’m off now,” Pepper says and leaves before he can stop her.
“Steve, Steve,” Clint said. Steve jerked to attention and shifted his eyes to Clint. “Please. Take some. It will help.”
Steve clasped his hand and stilled it. “That would just get us into more trouble and I have a meeting at 9 am. I don’t have time for the trouble you bring.”
“Sure,” she said. “Meet you in the garage.”
“Reason?”
The mug warms Steve’s frigid hands. He hasn’t tasted the milky chocolate yet. He gazes at the whipped cream and says, “If you want.”
He nods. “You’ve done it, Tony. You really have. The next steps are inconsequential. You’ve done it.”
CHAPTER 5
“Not your family home,” Steve said. He wouldn’t put Hawkeye’s family in danger. The twins and Bucky were pack members but volatile and unpredictable.
“How long? How long have you been faking it?” Tony growled at him. What would they do to Steve? How would they make him suffer for his betrayal of the V-Corps? “Have you ever been anything but a liar?”
The rest of the evening consisted of working out strategies, operations, tactics, and finally getting a list together of all the supplies needed. While Clint, Natasha, and Hill worked on that, Tony sent notice to JARVIS to get the cleaning crew out to the farm to collect all the Legion robot pieces. He still wasn’t happy about Hulk’s tendency to smash things, but he had to admit their war games helped coalesce not only the team but also the pack. Though he didn’t really know the difference. Once he was assured that the Iron Legion would be in safe hands, Tony joined the team for dinner. Steve sat quietly next to him. Both mentally and emotionally Steve emitted a reserved demeanor.
“Well, we’ll figure it out when the time comes. Right?” Tony looked to Natasha for some support. She agreed.
“He’s obsessed, Mom,” Tony had said when his mother asked him to tone it down. She stood by her piano as Tony tossed his math books on the couch. He was in high school at the ripe old age of ten years old. It bored him to pieces.
“No, where is the infection?” Steve asks.
Tony stood there, staring at the empty space where Steve had just occupied. Even the bond throbbed an ache like a hunger that wouldn’t go away. To think that just last night he’d dreamed of Steve. This morning, the seeds of hope had sprouted and now the dry and brittle truth killed every little bloom.
“Buck,” Steve says and goes to his side. He squeezes his shoulder and sees a fogged, nearly dazed look haunts his expression, his eyes. “Hey, you gotta rest.”
“And he had that chin,” Steve agrees. "Looked like grapes had a baby with a scrotum
“I take my leave.” Heimdall doesn’t wait for them to bid him farewell, he simply disappears in a burst of vibrant rainbow light.
“So, if they aren’t here why did you decide to bother me?” He throws down the bundle of wires, pulls out the circuit board, frowns and then dives into the chest again.
Steve. Tony frowned. How awkward would that be? But then again, Steve didn’t know that Tony was having hyper-realistic dreams about him so it would still be innocent enough. He texted a yes to Steve and answered the tap on his door. In his expensive black pants and a black shirt, he ushered the waiter into the room, paid the fee, and sent him on this way. Mainly he drank the coffee and ate the melon slices. He wasn’t very hungry. Death and funerals did that to him.
“People find work arounds all the time.”
Tony swallowed down the growing empathy. He was not going to feel sorry for Capsicle. The man had everything going for him. A soul pack – the leader of a soul pack. The rarity! It was so rare and so hidden in society that most of the time soul packs weren’t open to the rest of the world. No one really knew a lot about them. The stuff on Wikipedia was probably a bunch of hogwash. Now, Rogers had to deal with adjusting to modern life as well as figuring out how to be the leader of a soul pack. How the hell did that work? Obviously, not so well, since he transferred his feelings and memories to Bruce.
“Just,” Steve says. “I need to get up, I need to get moving.” He tries to rise.
“We can use some of the nanobots to format a grappling hook.”
“I’m asking you to be Captain America,” Peggy said. The profundity in her words stretched out, encompassing them in the dim bedroom. “So many have lost their way. Your country is lost to us. Right now, it’s gone. There’s martial law being declared. Vampires are being rounded up. If we don’t do something the American dream, your dream, dies, Steve. I’m not asking for just us. I’m asking you to fight for the soul of your country.”
The clinicians both nodded and something gleeful glanced over their expression. Tony blanched. They would remove his glands now and do whatever Frankensteinian research they wanted to do. Would that release Tony to the winds? Would it be enough?  He wanted nothing to do with it. He wanted to be gone now. He wanted to hold Steve in his arms again and beg forgiveness. If Steve had never gone to that Blood Den in the first place, then Tony would never have taken him – mated him. Now Steve was condemned because of Tony.
“We can stop at a diner somewhere,” Steve adds, and Tony agrees.
Stark taps his lower lip once with his silver fork. “Maybe.”
“Tony, stop,” Steve says from the bed as he tries to force himself to get up. It doesn’t work the pain overcomes him and he falls into the cushions, miserable and stifling the moans.
Blu rolls to the side and then gets up. He does it again, each time pushing Tony against his back.
Wanda shrugs. “Nat is a killer when it comes to contracts. She wants to make sure that the prince is engaged.”
Steve scans the room and clears his throat. “Do you mind if I use the bathroom, first?”
The shock, the horror as Tony begs, “Don’t do this. Don’t do this.”
Pietro smiles, the light from the windows glinting off his unnaturally white hair. “Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of him.”
“Yeah, sounds weird even to me,” Tony said, and he pet Steve’s chest and then his bicep. “You can’t even know how much I want to have a gander at this hunk of man flesh, but no, I think we need to stop and think. I don’t want you walking away in the morning with regret.”
“That alone makes you important. How would we get along without a leader? What would happen to the pack if we lost you?” Sam asked, his expression deadly serious. “Do you even know? The loss of any pack member can send us all to hell and back, but the leader – it scatters us. You get that, right? You understand that?”
Tony slowly shook his head. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Steve Rogers makes the man,” Natasha replied.
“Come on or I’ll get Pietro to help me and that kid will skip steps to get down. Always wants to do everything too fast,” Tony says. He tugs again. “Come on.”
“Did he call Reed?” The smuck – Tony hated that guy.
“I don’t even know why we still have it.”
“He wants to know what that is,” Steve says. He doesn’t wait for Tony to answer, instead he converses with the terrorist for a significant amount of time, trading one barb after another until Raza is confounded and seething.
“Oh yeah.” He grabs the small bag he packed and opens it. “Lots or a little?”
In a whisper, Steve says, “Show me, my prince. Show me how you like it.”
Steve turns to see Natasha with her arms crossed and a penetrating expression on her face waiting for an answer. “I -I. Can we talk in private?”
Steve inhaled and exhaled, measured and repeatedly for a few breaths before he nodded. He got to his feet and Tony opened his arms. “Just for a moment.” He slipped his arms around Steve as if he might shatter. Part of Steve cracked and threatened to fracture, but he watched as Tony held him. His arms didn’t tighten, his fangs now more vestigial than real never punctured. Part of Steve missed the comfort of Tony next to him, the sweet smell, the brush of his silky soft skin. Yet another part repulsed the touch and Steve sidestepped away from Tony too soon. To anyone else Tony’s features never changed, but to Steve – he caught the slight frown, the sadness tarnishing his shadowed eyes.
Startled out of his intense study of lacrosse, Steve looks up to an older man with a thick white beard and a gold eye patch. He shakes his head. “I’m not sure I understand it. I don’t really follow lacrosse.”
“You’re stealing our future. We have a future. That means you’ve stopped that future, that possibility. We have more life to live, but you’ve stolen it.”
He recognizes the dismissal but before he leaves the office, Steve turns to the director and says, “Tell Agent Carter, I said thanks.”
Tony puts on his regular non-enhancement pair of sunglasses. “I’m going to my lab. Be ready by ten. See you around Steve.”
“So, let him go. Family ends up ruining one another in my experience. Leave him to his own devices. It’s really none of your business.”
Cold.
He pads around on the ground like a blind man, and then picks up the battery again. Tony tugs at his sleeve and beats at his chest.
“Well, you aren’t telling me much. So, I’m going to tell you what happened. At some point or another you probably discussed Barnes. I know this because Steve told me he was going to broach the subject with you. You, on the other hand, probably already knew the awful truth because you’re too damned curious and hacked SHIELD ages ago. Plus, the big data dump would have been too rich for you to ignore. How am I doing so far?”
He’d heard that language before – when his father started to introduce him to the philosophies behind the Movement. Tony assessed the guard. The man seemed capable, more so than Sawyer but there was a ruthlessness about him as well. That might be a good thing considering what Howard had saddled these men with over the years.
“Yeah I have to admit, a lot of this is my fault. I spent the last two years-.”
“When do you want to go? Now? Tomorrow? Because I’m ready.”
Within him, in his own mind there’s a voice yelling out, denying these truths, telling him he’s not that at all. Steve refuses to hear, knowing that Ultron would do anything to twist his thoughts, to poison him against Tony. He latches on harder to his internal monologue of truth, shunning the pleading in his brain. Just as he does his hold shatters and shreds, everything disintegrates around him and he loses his hold of Tony. He grapples, falling, searching in a world of digital streams of data. He finds nothing to hold onto, nothing to break his fall, no sign of Tony anywhere.
“Not so good,” Clint said. “We gotta go.”
“What? You tear up the place and then take a relaxing bath afterward?” Tony said as he watched Bruce take a second towel that he held and dry his hair.
“Both,” Rumlow said. “We were brothers in arms for how many years, Captain? Get out of the car and this doesn’t have to escalate any more than it already has.”
“No, I won’t Tony.”
Tony grapples around the bed as if he’s looking for something. He sits up and scrubs his hands through his hair. “Is the upgrade finished? Could you check?”
And Tony knows. Something went wrong. Went horribly wrong. Somehow Steve rescued Natasha but sacrificed himself in her place. Why? How? He wants to scream. He wants to die. The hope that had blossomed in his chest unravels and he can’t hold onto it. It’s slipping through his fingers, lost, an unwoven mess.
“I’d want to see the data.” He can’t believe he would consider something as risky and hairbrained as this idea. “All of the data.”
Bruce exhales heavily and then says, “Let him in, JARVIS.”
Steve nods and then heads back to the laboratory, his mind a jumble of self-inflicted accusations.  He forces himself to plan, to strategize what he needs to make things right instead of allowing his brain to loop around to everything that must have gone wrong. Once in the lab, he collects the other laptops, the external hard drives that Tony backed everything up on. The notes that Steve insisted on writing in real notebooks. He shoves everything into his large art portfolio. He looks up at his own computer, his drawings, his comic book that he’s been working on so diligently. There’s no room in the bag. He’ll come back. It’s too important to have the data – his art can wait.
Good information. He nods but then switches the subject again. “Don’t tell me you’re here with Vision.”
Bruce sighed and put the mug of tea down. “Come on, Clint never says a word about his life. Don’t you start now.”
As they step down onto the homestead, the smell of honeysuckle floats in the air. It tightens his chest a little but he figures it’s the tension. The idea that he can smell and see and hear and feel in this place is a little disconcerting.
“We’re a little,” Banner says, pauses, and then finishes, “Unconventional.”
“Come on.” Tony wiggles his armored fingers.
“Let us pass and you may find entrance as well.” It’s Frigga now close but not as close as Tony.
The grip of the flight controls in his hands, the wind on his face from the broken cockpit window washed over him even as the perfect room about him stayed safe, stayed sane – which he couldn’t say he was anymore.
“I bet. Well, keep me posted,” Tony said and didn’t wait for Rhodey to respond. He shot up into the air and said, “Let’s look for the shield.”
“What? Steve, what are you doing?” Tony asks and jerks his hand away from him. “Stop messing around.”
He slogs through the water, all the time peering behind him waiting to find the coming troopers to take them out. But no one comes because the fortress behind him convulses as if it has been hit by a torpedo. It begins to lean; the right side of it going down in a slow slide toward the river.
Tony pushes Clint out of the way and sets up the coffee machine to fill up a mug. “No, not the medical tape, the painting. Where’d it come from?”
He wants the man to put him on the rack, to fill him up, to plug him and force him to hold it in. Steve moans around the thick cock in his mouth and as he does he feels the weight of it shift, the size of it grow and he’s barely breathing as it expands and swells. It feels like a ball gag in his mouth, but so much more as come pumps down his throat and he teeters near falling unconscious from the lack of air. He tries to swallow but the flush of come floods down his throat. There’s nothing he can do. The knot stretches his mouth, his lips split over it. He feels the bubble of come seeping over the ball of the knot, knows it must be glistening on his lips. The alpha’s grip on his hair intensifies as the rhythm of the man picks up.
“Oh I doubt that very sincerely, Captain,” Tony whispers and runs his hands through Steve’s hair. “You have that kind of blonde hair that gets like barley in the summer and dishwater in the winter.”
Steve falls to his knees in front of Tony and lays his head on his lap. “I’m going to miss you too, sweetheart.”
Frank glowers at Tony but blows a kiss at Steve. “See you then, babe. I’ll bring the straps next time, be easier.”
“I just, damn,” Tony said and bent over. “I have the hardest boner.”
“If this were how I – how it is supposed to go, then you and I would be in this bed together. We’d kiss and hold each other. But this- this feels wrong. Off.”
“Yes, yes,” Thor says. “You can come over and we’ll make the plans. We need you on board, Steven.”
“Well, then,” Jarvis says from his position behind Tony like a sentinel. “How about a little vacation? You can go to your private island. The staff there are all under the same non-disclosure. You should be able to stay for a while.”
Steve chuckles. “Yeah, so do I.”
“Now let’s see if I can get a fire going,” Tony mutters. The task proves more difficult because he’s working one handed. Trying to balance the arm of the suit with his injured wrist at the same time working on it with his left hand slows his progress. He stops more than once to curse or wipe sweat away from his eyes. When he sighs and leans back, ready to give up, a large paw settles against the piece he’s working on and steadies it.
She laughs. “So, you’re jetting off for a romantic weekend with your hubby?”
Nodding, Tony points toward the large bureau in the corner. Steve leans down, kisses him, and then jumps up to rummage through the drawers (mainly filled with clothes and the occasional tool) to find the tube. He brings it over to the bed. Crawling up to Tony, Steve massages his scalp.  Steve lies down on top of Tony, between his legs, their ever thickening cocks trapped between them. Tony circles his arms around him and groans as Steve pummels his mouth again.
“You jerk, you punk.” The catcalls come from the entrance to the lounge and Steve looks up to see Bucky marching toward him, war on his face.
“Well, no, not yet,” Natasha said. She thumbed behind her to indicate Bruce when Tony turned his attention to her. “Bruce discovered a glitch.”
Steve spots him and grins; yesterday apparently a nightmare that is to be forgotten. Those 1940s men like to be stoic and bury their feelings. Tony doesn’t know whether to be pissed or pleased. He opts for the latter. Might as well go with the flow. He smiles at his roomie and claps his hands.
He puts up a hand. “I know. I know.”
Peeling the label from the beer bottle, Tony says, “Well, retirement never sticks with me.” He hasn’t confessed to anyone that he and Pepper have finally called it quits. She can’t stand him always going back to Iron Man. Ultron ended it for her. She couldn’t get over it and told him. He’s on a march toward death and she wasn’t going to sit around and watch him. She was moving on. “Pepper left me.” He doesn’t mean to say it out loud, but it comes as naturally as the wind in a hurricane, a force of nature to destroy.
“What kid hates Disneyland?” Steve plows ahead, making it infinitely easier for Tony as long as he stays in the same path.
Jarvis notices that he’s not moving, not following him through the tour of the rooms. He comes back to Steve and considers him. His talk lanky form like a stick in the light of the expansive windows of the lounge. Mindlessly, Steve wonders if there are huge windows in the bedroom. He’ll never be able to get to sleep with all that light. He needs darkness. Absolute darkness. When he turns from the fireplace and focuses on Jarvis, the butler bows his head a little and clears his throat. Steve expects him to continue the tour.
“Not much, but maybe we’ll share our story if you share yours?” Bruce said and pointed to Tony’s arm.
“We all make mistakes, Tony,” Steve said as he pillowed his head on his folded hands.
Forcing himself to stand up straight, Steven addresses him, “What can I do for you, my lord.”
“It’s hard not to realize that,” Steve had said. His frown deepened as they spoke. “I lost a lot when I went under. When I woke up, I lost everything, but the worst part of it was that I couldn’t even see her again.”
“What clues do you have?”
“Let’s not think about that now,” Bruce said. He touched Tony’s arm. So rarely did Bruce reach out and make physical contact that Tony understood the profundity of the gesture. Dropping his hands, he looked at Bruce. “Why don’t you go and see Steve now?”
“No cutting, don’t cut it off.” He’s delirious with the pain, but it doesn’t make it any easier to deal with.  With no other choice,  Steve crawls up onto the cot, and pulls Bucky down onto his chest, with his legs wrapped around him.
“What does it do?” Steve asked. His hand dropped from Tony’s chest to his own lap. Even that motion drained him of strength. He searched Tony’s expression as it shifted from sorrow to horror.
“Huh? Oh,” Steve says and peeks his head around the corner. “Tony. I thought you would be getting ready. Packed and all. I just wanted to finish up some work.”
“No, probably not. But you shouldn’t be that close. Who knows if it will explode or something,” Tony says and shrugs off his dire warnings. “I want to talk to you.”
The laughter that takes Tony is full and rich and the beginning of a lifetime of joy.
“True, but you are able to do this. You’ve explained how you did it before. All you need do is open the entrance to his soul like you did before.”
“I’ll get you hot chocolate and a big breakfast, but Cho wants you awake, so you have to get up,” Tony responds and this time his voice sounds a little frantic.
“The last known location of the lion was reported to be outside of Kunduz on the border near Tajikistan. The Lion Hunter has a stronghold in the area. Local warlords have been attacking the stronghold over the last fortnight to no avail.”
“No, I think this is important for Steve to see,” Tony says. “You do remember what you did last night, right? Steve, you remember?”
Tony bursts out laughing, the shock and thrill bubbling over. He falls off the shield and lies in the snow drifts looking up at the perfectly blue sky. “How the hell can you do that? Why didn’t the shield sink? It’s physically impossible. I have a fucking million questions.”
“Fortune and omelet. I can’t see why you ever let her get away,” Steve said.
“Twenty minutes? Shit! Why didn’t anyone tell me?” Tony said.
Just a little note: Chapter 9 is a long one - 15k and just sent to my beta reader so it might be a little late coming.
Natasha’s projection appears before Steve. She grimaces as she glares at him. “You were attacked, and you didn’t alert us?”
“Red Skull gang is policing farther out, I guess. They came at us, wasn’t pretty.” He holds back for a moment as the pain cycles through him. Steve grips his hand, wanting to tell him not to try, but knowing Bucky would be insulted; he stays quiet. “I got away, but just barely, Clint knew I was hurt. He went and gave himself up, saying he wanted to turncoat.”
“The nanoparticles I was telling you about. Technically nanobots. I still have a lot of work to do on them, but I can basically program them to do these types of commands, and build the suit, do functions of the suit.”
“And the rest of you? You just live here on his-.” Tony can’t continue. It’s too hard to think of these people using Steve.
“No. It shouldn’t. The stress might ratchet up the effects on our hearts but nothing too dreadful, I don’t think.” He grabs the thermos again and fills up his cup. “You have any snacks in there?”
“There’s a mess at the Pentagon right now. Some factions are with SHIELD others are standing their ground and saying that SHIELD has it wrong,” Rhodey had reported to Tony.
“Four fines since we left the match. Can I have another word, please?” Tony asks as he watches Steve packing his clothes.
“I don’t think this is a proper topic for when we’re eating anyhow.” Steve sips his tea, then continues to devour his sandwiches.
“Ultron is your creation. You’re the brilliant mind that brought him to life. You’re Doctor Frankenstein and he’s the monster. The book ends with Frankenstein in the arctic looking for the monster. This Passage is through beating the Hulk. The monster.”
So if you want to following me on
Steve must understand hear the hesitation in his tone. He wraps his arm and leg around Tony. “What is it? You can tell me anything.” He kisses Tony’s hair.
He needs to never drink again. Steve shifts in his seat as everyone around the table stares at him like a thousand needles piercing his skin. “I’m sorry, Tony. I drank too much.”
“Give it here. Send me the data,” Tony said and then peered over his shoulder at the staircase where he glimpsed the shadows of the Barton kids, waiting. “What say you go and find me one of the Iron Legion heads?” Both Cooper and Lila leapt to their feet and raced down the stairs thundering out of the house before either Clint or Laura could object. Tony shrugged. “Kids.”
“I spent time with the rebels as ordered by my alpha. I infiltrated their ranks and spent time as one of their compatriots. I pledged the oath to them during the Uprising.”
He needs to get to the bottom of it, so Tony lies back in the cushions of the bed and agrees, “Sure a burger sounds good.”
“It’s good to have you back. Both of you,” Natasha says as she leans back in her lounge chair. They are all lingering on the back balcony of the compound in Upstate New York after a celebratory dinner. She sips her wine and offers another toast. “To Tony for possibly being the most thick headed pining lovebird I know.”
Steve looked at Tony, his arms clamped around his body in a self-hug. Tony thought he’d never seen Steve so unsure. The soul bonds mourned and shuddered, quaking like a troubled flower in the wake of a storm. “Okay.”
The Tower is empty.
“You’re right though. We have some tests to run. Make sure that I can tolerate the upgrade and that the implant stays stable.” He nods as if he’s trying to convince himself that he can’t have this quietude, this bliss, this joy at this moment. It’s too fragmentary and hopeful.
Standing, Steve decided to go to Tony – tell him what he needed. Stop this merry-go-round in his head. As he went to the balcony door, a tapping sounded and then the apartment door opened. Tony entered. He had sunglasses on and a long-sleeved linen jacket and pants to match.
Strong. Opinionated. Fierce. Courageous. Compassionate. Wise.
“A lion?” Tony rubs at his overgrown beard. “I guess it could be true. It could happen. If the tesseract is a doorway to other dimensions through space you might have folded in with another reality, merged with what you are in another reality.” The vision of a Corvid flutters through his mind. “So, you’re really not Blu at all.”
While Steve disappeared onto the elevator, Natasha said, “You did good.”
At first, he isn’t sure what Steve’s asking or why he’s asking it, but then it dawns on him. “The moral of the story is that we all have a place, where we belong even if it doesn’t seem like it. The moral of the story, my dear husband, is that are we all legends waiting to be told.”
Before Tony can answer a high wind staggers them and they turn to the darkening skies. The ocean’s once emerald color turns storm grey and then roll of thunder sounds in the sky. On the edge of the horizon, Steve sights the angel – coming toward them. His own wings arch up and around Tony, protective and shielding. They’re coming, the Boundaries are open, and all of Hell may be upon them.
“I did not tell everyone you were a hooker.”
Tony smiles, but it feels like a lie.
“The records don’t show whether or not they stayed together. Though there’s indications that Stark had a child. But nothing clear,” Steven says. But his voice falters as he talks about it. As if something bothers him about the history. Tony can only guess. Back then, the ideas that each of the castes were equal ran rampant through most of the society. Civilization experimented with the equal protections and prospects for all. It ruined things in the end.
“If you don’t do this, then you know that you will pay as well as the rest of the pack.” Thor stood up. “The pack is your family, Steven. Believe me when I say to you if you do not tend your family, your brother, you will pay and so will all of them. Including Tony.” He gave a tight smile. “I consider you my greatest friend on Midgard. I am honored to be your Guide. Please take heed of my words.” He offered his hand to Steve and his grip was firm but tender. “I bid you peace, my friend and leader.”
“So you got an angel husband floating around up in the sky somewhere, so you can’t be unfaithful to him or maybe an angel wife – that Natasha person, angel, whatever?” Tony says and the tension in his shoulders melts away. He’s firmly placed, not in the room, not willing to leave – yet.
Should he be elated? Should he care? They undid his work. They remade him. He feels like Frankenstein’s monster. A thing put back together again with pieces and parts of non-living tissue. Vision had been made out of vibranium. Does vibranium, the thing that made up his shield, now live in him? No, that’s not right. Cho said something about a graft from his leg. Does he feel that? Can he feel anything at all?
He added, “We screwed up.”
He pushed Steve to stop. “Don’t go there if you don’t want to.”
Steve.
She gets him to eat that night and then brings him to his bed. She has him undress and then lay down. She kisses his forehead and for a moment, he remembers his mother. He closes his eyes and listens to the memories of his mother singing to him.
There’s a space between them; it’s colored in twilight – a silvery gray of ambiguity. “Yes.” He starts to stand and Tony’s at his side. “I’m okay, Tony. I don’t need your help.”
“Oh.” Sam stopped. Looking between the two of them, Sam said, “You’re not joking.”
“Jo-Jo, lights.”
“It could and we don’t want to have the Ornari here.” A moebius strip is not the way to go, it would turn the events inside out and lead to someone missing their grandmother or some shit. Logan was right this whole thing gives him a headache.  “That’s one thing to consider. The Ornari are not in both realities, right?”
Tony grasped his hand. “It’s me. I’m here, for you not for Captain America. I get it. I get that the dreams you had are back there in that house. The dreams you had are in the past. But are the dreams you could have now, are they that bad?”
“You must,” Frigga says. “But there is one thing he will not know.” They all turn to her. “You are entangled. The two of you, always revolving around one another. Even in this limbo. Anthony since the day he arrived, you have had only one thought. It has been him, always. He is your center, your North. You will always be linked to him because your souls are linked.”
Tony looks around and gets it. “I’m safe. You don’t have to worry. There’s nothing but fish in this water.”
A tight smile crosses her features, she nods, and then joins Gamora to plan and deliver the message. He prays he’ll see her again.
“Like he couldn’t make no gravity all the sudden?” It’s a strange dichotomy, how sweat drips down his back, yet the sensation in his face disappears from the cold.
Tony knew through the link it was the last thing that Bruce wanted to do; something primitive drove Bruce to be close to Steve, to help Steve. Even Tony felt the lure, the pull to gather around him. As Steve’s life hung in the balance, what would happen to the pack members? What would happen to him?
“I’m frightened.”
“That’s mature,” Steve says and gives up trying to serve Tony. After a brief spell of merciful quietude, Steve must decide it’s a good idea to harangue him over lunch. “I’ve watched you, you know, over the last week. You’re intense. I think you’ll do it. Eventually. But- and here’s the thing – if you have stroke before then it’s all for naught.”
“Whatever you say,” Steve agrees and they start down the narrow staircase. It’s a dicey walk down because the stairs were made by a crazy man, Steve’s certain. Some are slanted, others are as unstable as his legs; the whole place needs to be renovated. He’ll have to consider that once they get Schmidt to leave the town alone.
“This one,” The leader says and indicates Steve, “Kill slow. Not so lucky as first, right?” The leader smiles at Tony and it looks like a viper toying with his prey.
“I’m not, you just rest, sleep, Buck.” Steve pushes his hair from his forehead. “Besides, you ain’t going nowhere._
“Heads up, Falcon,” Tony yelled since he was the most vulnerable of their air support.
Clint sobbed and shook his head. Steve spoke, low and fierce. “Do it. Clint, do it.” Both Ross and Pierce turned to him as Steve said, “He’s a good man. You haven’t broken him, you haven’t broken anyone. Clint is a good man, a good father. You wouldn’t understand the love he has for his family. You wouldn’t understand the love that I share with Tony. You’re cold and dead – more than any vampire that walks the Earth. I will stand with the vampires and I will stand with Clint. I am their shield. Do what you want, but I will not crack.” He met Clint’s weeping eyes. “Do it.”
“It’s only been a month, the suppressants have a biological half-life of 15 standard days, that means I still have at least another month before I get so low that-.”
Steve screwed up his mouth and Tony couldn’t tell whether or not he was laughing or quelling his anger. The feedback through the bond mixed and oscillated in all directions. “Okay,” Steve said after a pause. “I get it. But I am not leaving him out there. He’s pack and I understand the issue you have. I can’t let him wander without anyone caring for him. He needs someone to care.”
Steve bites back his answer; Tony doesn’t need to know – doesn’t need the guilt.
Steve has the good sense not to comment. Instead he says as he stands in front of Tony and puts his hand behind his back, slightly brushing Tony’s hand to actually tell him he’s there. Tony grips his upper arm. “How about we break and go and get some tea. I’m sure I can get something for a midnight snack.”
“What’s that?”
“-nearly killed you, Steve.” He thinks the second voice is Natasha, but it echoes in his head and it hurts.
Steve frowns. He turns to see the arch.
“It hasn’t made a difference in Stark’s ability to withstand the sun,” Pierce replied.
When Tony’s able to break away and staggers a little, he notices a little chuckle from Natalie. He rolls his eyes and says, “Thor, you know everyone here but my new omega. Steven.”
He thought about Pepper, about her beauty and brilliance. Mostly, he grappled with how unfairly he treated her over the intervening months since the holiday, since the last of his armor exploded. He wrapped himself in a façade, brittle but glimmering, as shiny as any of his suit of armor. He pretended with the best of them; he knew how to walk through life putting up the showman while slowly creeping into a dark, dank place like a worm into a rotting stump. He shivered, because something in his core shriveled and dried.
Natasha glares at him. “Sometimes it’s better not to say anything at all Clint.” Turning back to Steve, she says, “He’s not wrong. You brought Wanda out of her shell and I’ve heard you’ve helped a lot of the warriors with their stress in more ways than just physical. You worth it, Steve.” She squeezes his hand.
Sam’s not as relaxed. He stands next to the railing with his arms crossed over his chest, not at ease. “You sure Ross isn’t coming knocking on our door come Monday?”
With a shrug of his shoulders, Sam winked. “Who said I let
Tony offered his hand. “Come on.” Steve took his hand and Tony dragged him away from the kitchen. Truth be told, Tony didn’t have a clue what he should do. Instead, he let the feeling of his soul’s energy lead him as if he had jumped into a car and just let the road take him where it would. Eventually they ended up at his workshop. Steve hesitated at the entrance, but Tony hauled him inside the main lab.
He hoists the heavy duffle onto his thin shoulder. The jostle of the crowd as people disembark from the ship knocks him around, but Steve’s used to dealing with people ignoring him, and he forces his way down the ramp of the Class B cruiser. It’s the only star ship he’s ever been on and hopefully will be his last. It took him all his savings to get to one of the Prime Stations. Starting a new life on the station in the midst of the war means Steve has a chance to make some real cash for once and maybe, just maybe pay for the augmentation that will finally solve his health problems.
