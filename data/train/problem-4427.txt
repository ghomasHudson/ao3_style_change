The girl took in his contemplation and added in a bribe, "I can get you out of your last class to help set up?"
Dean squeezed the hand he held in his own. “Nah, there’s a ghost there, not complete false advertising. Just not a scary one. Like a sexy ghost, y’know?”
The waves were choppy that afternoon, a side effect of the occasional summer wind. The rough water conditions combined with the week's overcast weather report to make the perfect day for a deserted beach. An empty beach was the best type; Dean loved to stretch out and feel the sunshine warming his face. He always picked up an irrational number of extra freckles after a good summer outside, but his love for the beach outweighed any dumb teasing. It was his happy place.
when they spoke, happened to be a medical professional, and seemingly had taken on the task of singlehandedly flustering Dean to no end. He blushed like a damned
Normally, Dean would have spun around in an instant, would have the person who surprised him in a headlock within seconds, but something familiar stopped him. The breeze was playing into the moment, gently pushing that stupidly sweet-clear-clean-Cas scent over Dean. Castiel always grabbed the attention of every single one of his senses. The calming hand that came to rest on Dean’s forearm was more soothing than he’d ever admitted. Dean took a deep breath, as if he could taste Cas on the soft wind if he inhaled hard enough, still facing away.
Once the girl was safely deposited at her apartment and Dean returned to his home, Castiel made the short drive up the street to his condo. Soon enough, Cas proved his estimation correct and fell into bed at 3:15, head flooded with the thoughts he had tried to hide during his workday, unable to use the guise of professionalism to prevent any personal emotions from slipping through.
? Dean liked the adrenaline rush. The danger is the fun part, sometimes, at least. Definitely, now that it seemed Castiel had no intentions of killing him any time soon.
gotten the Castiel part correctly. Due to the performance of correcting the man each morning, the entire class was sure to know Castiel's name.
Dean laughed then, carefully running his hand back and forth on Castiel's hip soothingly. He wanted that, but the part of him that knew Castiel would be off to a different state soon wished to protect them both from the heartache. Another part of Dean, the one that his father worked so hard to build, didn't want to admit he was afraid they'd be seen, and that's why he had pulled away.
(Fine, to be pedantic, Dean’s business manager Garth signed Castiel’s checks. Castiel definitely didn’t want to sleep with him, but the function of the rule still stands. Work and pleasure = separate. It’s the way Castiel had lived his whole life, a clear disconnection between the two halves.)
He used packing his bags at Bobby's as an excuse to leave early on their last Friday, killing the hope they shared about their previous weekend. Together. He stuttered through the additional reasons of summer reading and Sam returning from camp, and he needed to get things ready for when his dad came back and needing to settle in back at his house, and he's
At least if he wasn’t, it’d be a better story to tell around his funeral pyre. Damn, Dean’s life was kinda fucked up.
Cas waited until Dean’s hand was curled around his, around the key, before he let go. Dean hadn’t moved since Cas first reached into his jeans.
things too much, since it was always his fault, always his missteps that he was chasing a cure for. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, trying to forget how good Cas felt pressed against him, how right it felt to kiss him, how wrong it felt when the panic bubbled up and he shoved Cas away. All he sees behind his eyelids are his mistakes, so he opened his eyes.
Dean just continued to deny Castiel the attention he wanted, kissing and sucking at the man’s thigh, up to his hip and moving sinfully closer to Cas’s rigid length.
alright y'all i have a bit more written out and i know where it's going so i do not expect long until i update!  i would also like to raise a concept: cas in the teen angel frankie avalon deep v.  there's nothing to be done with beauty school dropout within this au but i do think cas should wear the outfit.
“Roughhousing,” Dean repeated, an amused chuckle directed at Castiel finally got the boy to look up. He blushed like he always did when Dean poked fun at his vocabulary.
Dean looked down at the screen, and Cas raised his eyes to see his reaction. Dean carefully grabbed onto the camera, his fingers just barely brushing against Cas where he held on as well. Neither of them moved; Dean just smiled at the picture taken before looking back at Castiel. Cas couldn't help but notice Dean's eyes fall to his lips before they met his again.
Dean met Castiel’s eye and recognized the hint of laughter hiding there, regardless of how limited Castiel’s expressions were.
His face entirely neutral, he carefully reached around and slipped one hand into Dean’s back pocket.
Castiel shot Dean a look that managed to look threatening even through his partially hooded eyes. “It absolutely really is. I do it out here alone every year, at least you have me here.” Dean laughed, a big warm sound that Cas swore he felt wrap around him like a blanket, regardless of the fact that Dean was laughing
Dean hummed to himself, sounding the name out in his head before repeating it back, careful to pronounce each syllable. He clapped his hands down onto his knees and stood up off of his beach towel, reaching out to shake hands. "Alright, Castiel," he drawled, "I'm Dean Winchester. Nice t'meet you."
The smile that cracked on Cas’s face made Dean blush and jerk back, running his fingers through his hair as an excuse for the sudden movement.
Friendly smiles to the waitresses, a booth by the window, Castiel’s foot bumping up against Dean’s shoe just light enough to serve as a reminder of his presence and not cause an annoyance.
“Svyatki.” Castiel pronounced, always one for tradition. “It’s the perfect time for contacting the spirits and our ancestors, the best time for reaching forward into the future.” Cas tipped his head towards Dean, lowering his voice as if the next part was a secret. “It’s magic, Dean. Everything has meaning, it’s all signs.”
"I didn't mean to make you do my homework and then jump you immediately." Dean's voice trailed off, slightly starved for air. Castiel smiled when he realized he wasn't the only one whose breath had been stolen by that kiss. Even Dean was affected,
"Wanna beer?" Dean had been distracted from his quest for a second drink when he had seen Castiel walking up, and he thought it'd be rude not to offer. "They're cold?" He supplied the qualifier once Castiel took a few seconds too long to answer.
Within the first few weeks of knowing Castiel, Dean found himself opening up more to this dark-haired visitor than he ever had with anyone.
The music shifted into some techno bullshit, and he heard the bartender call out his order as it fell with a click against the bar behind him. Dean nods and grunts as way of a thank you, the bartender already halfway to the other end, clearly not waiting for his response. Dean drank down one of the double shots, swallowing hard. He quickly typed a response to Cas, knowing if he didn’t, the angel would sound the alarm and he’d have half his contact list calling him for a status update. He really had left quickly, panicked, barely remembering to grab his car keys. He owed Castiel at least some peace of mind.
much more ancient and all-knowing than any human ever could be. When he spoke, it was with the cadence of someone addressing a child, and it would have infuriated Dean if he weren’t so damn confused to begin with.
Cas tilted his head just a bit at Dean’s reaction, which was almost surely some mess of defensive anger and forced stoicism.
Dean pulled against the tight grip on his hair, the stinging pleasure-pain not nearly enough to hold him back from taking Castiel back into his mouth.
Falling asleep was hard that night; he couldn't get Castiel out of his mind. They had kissed. Dean had made the final move, and he had kissed a boy, and he wasn't even freaking out like he thought he would. Sure, maybe he was taking advantage of the fact that school didn't have to know yet, but he couldn't change the fact that he really did want Castiel around. He wished he had done things properly, had a date and held hands, or something nice. Something Castiel deserved.
after a night out. He had a couple of excuses at his disposal, but his safety and security were enough. His personal information had been leaked too many times to risk it over a girl he met a few hours ago under flashing club lights. That, plus the obscene amount of zeroes in Castiel’s new salary meant he couldn’t care less if he had to park up somewhere and read while Dean got off. Castiel had asked after the second back seat tryst why Dean never went to the woman’s home.
“I can’t believe my very first ordeal gets to be for you, my dear boy,” Rowena’s bright, clear brogue made Dean meet her gaze, and she tilted her head and clasped her hands, smiling with her perfectly colored lips in a pleased and amused pucker.  “Good luck, Dean,” she warmly wished, and then dropped her folded hands and closed her eyes, the large fans of her eyelashes curling against her skin like glittering spiders perching upon her face.  In true Rowena fashion, her opening up was the most dramatic—she flung her arms wide, fingers splayed out as much as possible, and let her head fly so far backward she arched her back into an elegant bend, like a bow ready for an arrow to be knocked.  What flowed from her eyes, mouth, nose, and ears was very obviously blood, spraying forth in arterial spirals.  The flecks and spots splattered her skin and soaked into her flowing ball gown and huge, coiffed hair; she was the figure of a bygone era, a druidic goddess bathing in the sacrifices of her worshipful followers.
“I need to ask an angel in North Dakota some questions, was wondering if you’d want to come up with me? I would use some badass female support in this. Her name’s Anael, but she goes by sister jo. She’s a faith healer with expensive taste. She might like you.”
Dean plants his lips against his as fast as possible, pushing cas back and against his own truck. They kiss for a while, they hear the music playing in the yard, people cheering, a bottle smash and eruptions of laughter.
Dean let out a shaky breath, he was so stressed he didn’t know what to do. He looked over at Jack, the poor kid that has done nothing but try his best and get fucked over by the universe. He was written into the Book of Winchester as a weapon, as a tool, as a prop. He only did what he was told, Dean understood that now.
“Just a small wedding present from Jack,” Dean smiled, patting his brother on the shoulder and passing him off to be bombarded with hugs.
They stumbled their way back to their feet. Hugging once more, they pressed their cheeks together, just holding one another. Dean let out a deep breath, all the tension in his body slipping away into a moment in time that he didn’t have to live in anymore. The love of his life was back.
“When I was in heaven the other day Jack also said he wiped us clean of our past. No criminal records, perfect credit, alive and well. We truly can do whatever we want now so Cas and I are going to buy a house and start living.”
writing vows is really fun i enjoyed doing this, I hope you like this chapter! I've also made a spotify playlist for this fic if you want to check it out
“Well, let’s get my angel,” Dean said as he smacked the table and stood up. He cleaned up the table from breakfast, packed his duffle and his lunchbox full of beer and made his way to North Dakota.
The next morning Dean woke up to Cas pressed against his chest, Sam opened his bedroom door just a crack to let Miracle into his room before closing it again. She jumped up onto the bed and startled Cas who wasn’t sleeping, just lying there with his eyes closed.
“It's the angels. They were on my ass before, but I hear they’re actively looking for me specifically now. What should I do?”
Further down the road, the transition between forest and concrete raised slightly, creating a soft wall of dirt and shrubbery. At the moment, it seemed like something comfortable, but upon sitting against the wall, it felt itchy and uncomfortable. Castiel shrugged it off. He sat flush against the wall and tried to relax his screaming muscles enough to settle down to sleep. The sooner he slept, the sooner he could continue his journey.
“Not if I can help it,” Sam snapped. “Maybe if you told me what you need my brother to do for you, I would be more willing.”
After a few miles, Castiel felt like collapsing with fatigue. Castiel knew the journey would take days, since Lebanon, Kansas was over three-hundred miles away from Longmont. This trek was exhausting. He had never been without his wings before, only ever flying long distances and- on rare occasion- riding in the Impala with the Winchesters. As he continued walking on the shoulder of the highway towards Kansas, he smiled fondly at the idea of seeing Sam and Dean again. He missed them with every atom of his being. The Winchesters seemed to be the only true friends he had, and despite their ups and downs he was always forgiven and accepted by them. It was more than his angel brethren had ever even considered giving him. He wished all angels could experience the camaraderie he had with the Winchesters, the feeling that he had people he could always rely on no matter the hardship.
Dean knew he should contact someone about the recent situation he had found himself in. Not out of fear, but out of necessity. He turned a corner and stomped down a dingy alleyway, the type of area he would have flashed an FBI badge to sneak into, to further poke and prod at a crime scene. He felt bitterly nostalgic.
Castiel shook underneath him, the pain from the angel blade lodged in his shoulder cavity erupting under the skin. Dean had been trained in this, knowing how to pick and choose where the most painful spots on the body were, and where to hit them most effectively. It was the same for an angel, they were still trapped in a human vessel. The shoulder was a good spot, but about an inch to the left and he could stab it through the slight crevice between the arm and its socket. It was painful and effective. If Castiel refused to talk, he knew where to strike. However, it seemed unnecessary.
Dean couldn’t even remember himself anymore. The part of himself that felt human, that felt emotion towards the things in his life- towards what had happened, and what he had done- it had all burned away. Just as everyone had told him it would. He hadn’t quite believed it, but as he sliced and carved into the other tormented souls thrown in the pit alongside him, he lost all of the feelings; the regret, the pain, the trauma. It had allbeen washed out by the anguished cries of the tortured begging him to stop.
With one word, Sam’s entire perspective changes, his victorious look now one of defeat and shock. Only they shared that word, as a warning. A codeword meaning to drop everything and run. One word and Sam knew he wasn't lying. Dean grinned from ear to ear as Sam attempted to process what was happening, and he took this chance to lunge at him, catching his brother completely off guard. Unfortunately, that didn’t quite go for Ruby, who pushed Sam out of the way, causing Dean to stumble over himself. Preparing himself to attack once again, he only caught a glimpse of pain crossing his brother’s face before the two vanished.
Everyday, normal life. Dean had never really grasped what it would be like to live that way. Even as a human, he had never known, only ever dipping his toes in the pool before something dragged him out kicking and screaming. As a demon, it was twice as hard to even remotely exist among humans. There was a constant desire to slaughter, to maim, to destroy. If the urge arose, he would rip the arm off of the businessman walking next to him, and he wouldn’t hesitate nor regret doing so. There was no afterthought, none that mattered anyway. It was rare that his own humanity showed. It was so twisted and mangled that his demonic side easily overpowered any emotion he could have felt. However, when he saw Sam a week ago, the emotion was so incredibly strong that it allowed his humanity to slip through. Though now that he knew it could, he wouldn’t allow it to happen again.
Castiel felt at peace here in the quiet of a desolate highway, despite the exhaustion weighing down on him. Castiel’s shoes crunched against the rocks and grain of the transition between concrete and forestry, and he gazed up at the stars in wonder. How beautiful it was to see the sky from the human perspective. As an angel, he could see the planets, the stars, and the intricacies of the universe surrounding them. He could see galaxies from afar and perceive the details of the farthest moons. As a human, he was unable to perceive the details, only able to perceive the general- a vast amount of lights that shone against the dark of the night sky. In perceiving the minimal, he found it to be more beautiful than ever before.
“So you have nothing to feel guilty for,” Cas assured him, the only hint of this being a difficult conversation for him a slight puckering between his eyebrows, a tightening of his lips together.  Dean surprised them both, then, as he let out a breathy, short chuckle, shaking his head and closing his eyes.
“Leave it to you to find a reason to apologize, even for this,” Cas said, smirking, and Dean laughed in response.  Cas tightened his grip on Dean’s torso, pulling him back to touch Dean’s forehead once again to his own.  “Winchesters.”
“I didn’t save you out of guilt,” Dean directed these words at the ground, unable to bring himself to look up, unable to keep the words at bay any longer, “you dumb son of a bitch.”  Rubbing his face roughly with his hands, he heard Cas move, probably indignantly, but he had no idea for sure, as in the next moment, Dean closed the distance between them.
, Dean didn’t say out loud but muttered nervously in his head, “which means eventually all of us here on Earth will be judged one final time, without any favors or weigh-ins from you and your Big Dickbag Energy colleagues who control the universes.”  As Dean talked, Empty-Anna tilted her head infinitesimally, her face maintaining the same expression so stilly as to be unnatural, unnerving to look at.  Pausing a minute to swallow so he wouldn’t have to clear his throat and give away his fear, Dean finished, “I’m choosing to take my ordeal now.”
“Sam,” Dean helplessly called as the two clasped hands and began leaving Cas and Dean alone by the staircase.
Empty-Anna grinned, her teeth brilliantly bright somehow in the darkness of the surroundings.  “Very clever,” the Empty commended him, and Dean would have sarcastically thanked her if he wasn’t actively keeping himself from gasping.  “A pity—it would have been fun to see you utterly devastated before watching you writhe in the ordeal’s molten purification.  All that pain and anger and despair…deliciously drained into nothing when I take you inside of me.”
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Dean replied, smirking right back, pulling out every vestige of his poker-playing chops to keep himself looking and sounding cool, calm, collected.  “I’m not here to make an offering.”
, the warmth had suddenly spiked behind Dean’s nose, surprising him, and he pinched his lips together to push the tears away.  He hadn’t wanted this to set off any waterworks for either of them, but he had to make sure Sammy understood, and he couldn’t start over now, he was going to have to just barrel along.
“A human soul?  You’ve never had one all your own, right?”  Dean let a teasing, nettling edge creep into his words, the corners of his lips puckering upward.  “Draining angels and demons is one thing, all their emotions and experiences are old hat for you.  I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re a little bored of it, now that you’ve been awakened so many times lately, having to deal with all the melodrama of these other planes.  Getting the taste of a human soul, draining that into yourself for the first time, before going back to sleep, all those juicy, new, human dreams?”  Dean shook his head, as if he was savoring a delicious, deep feeling.
When he opened them, and let his jaw drop open as well, Dean didn’t know what he’d been expecting, but whatever it had been, this wasn’t it.  Where his eyes, his teeth, his tongue once were, there was simply flowing, crystal clear water, so transparent that were it not running in a swift current out of each opening, it may have appeared like glass rods had impaled Jack and suspended him in place.  The water joined the circling tides of the other substances in a matter of a few seconds, and the roaring sound of the funnel crescendo-ed so loudly that Dean clapped his hands reflexively over his hears, gritting his teeth.
Castiel, angel of Thursday, warrior of heaven, was just pushing himself up from his knees, his tan trench coat sweeping against the dirt and rubble of the barn floor as he straightened himself, flexing his hands and looking at them, his brow low.
It ended when he realized he had a body.  Yes, that was right—he was supposed to have a body, that’s what humans had, didn’t they?  Human, yes, Dean Winchester was a human, with a body, and he was alive, and he was awakening.
Blinking, Sam’s forehead wrinkled further at the direction the conversation was seemingly spontaneously taking.  Before he could respond, Dean went on, “You’ve got a…truly awesome life ahead of you.  You can hunt when you want, rest when you want, knowing that there are others out there fighting the good fight, so you don’t have to for a while.  You can marry Eileen,” Dean couldn’t stop the suggestive crooked smile as he said this, the older brother teasing instinctive, and Sam’s face darkened a little in response as he blinked, flustered.  “Have a kid if you want, hell have a couple, this place is big enough to house the frigging Duggars,” Dean snorted, and Sam reflexively followed suit despite himself.
“Dean!”  Dean opened his eyes, and stared up into Sam’s jutting, tense face.  When he met Sam’s gaze, Sam let out a forceful breath, tension easing from his brow and his jaw, lowering his shoulders.  “Hey, you good?  You’re good, here,” Sam leaned sideways and let go of Dean’s arms so he could rap his own under Dean’s armpits and around his back, hoisting Dean up, first into a sitting position, then with a grimace and a grunt fully up onto his feet.
“You don’t think it makes sense?”  Dean returned, indignant, and Sam grimaced.  Scoffing, Dean leaned forward and gestured with an open palm to the book.  “Come on, man!  The oldest religion, ever.  A final ‘renovation’ of the universe.  No interventions from gods, just free will—I mean if this doesn’t sound exactly like what we’ve got here, now, with Jack-”
Before either of them could begin trying to make heads or tails of the experience, rustling drew their attention behind them, near the barn doors.  The sight that greeted Dean’s eyes almost made his knees buckle, a potent current of energy washing through him.  “Holy shit, it worked,” Sam breathed by his side, and Dean began lurching forward.
“Winchesters,” Eve bit back, grimacing menacingly in their direction, “it hasn’t been long enough, at all.  Sorry I missed you in purgatory the last time you visited,” she directed this last statement at Dean, pursing her lips out in a sardonic pout and narrowing her eyes.
“I’m not an idiot, Winchester, I already knew your desired outcome would involve returning Castiel to you, stop wasting my time and tell me what is at stake for
“I know, you’re right, no, you’re right,” Sam swiftly conceded, waving his hand and nodding his head.  “I just…” he flipped some of the pages gingerly, rubbing his hand over his jaw and mouth as he pondered.  “I mean, all of it fits, for sure, but what if it isn’t this?  And we get down to the wire, shoot our shot, and we were wrong?”
“Absolutely,” Dean responded, and Eileen grinned back.  Sam, who had been pressing his face into Eileen’s hair wistfully, inhaling the scent her, reveling in the tangible, solid, real body of the woman he loved finally being back in his arms, brought his gaze up to his brother’s.
“Do you feel that?”  Sam’s voice broke the stillness behind Dean, and he turned to stare at his brother, who was standing in the middle of the barn, glancing up slightly with a furrowed brow.
chose this, remember,” Dean murmured, feigning disgruntled offense, but unable to wipe the blissfully amused smile off his face.
“You mean we,” Sam corrected him, and Dean paused.  Sam hesitated too at the lack of response, and both of them put their sandwiches back down.  “So that
The fact that the Empty had chosen Anna’s likeness made this comment particularly amusing and embarrassing for Dean, and he rolled his eyes while trying to cover up a quick, desperate breath in, steeling himself for whatever was going to happen next.  “No offense, but been there, done that,” he responded, fleetingly proud of the amount of strain he was able to keep from his voice.
“Yeah, well, I’m full of surprises,” Dean instinctively retorted at the figure that was mimicking the angel Anna, certain that despite the steady, unwavering quality of his voice that his face was clearly giving away the intense, unnerved terror that was coursing through his body.  Behind him slightly to his left, Sam shifted and gripped his already tightly clenched fist harder over whatever it was he had in his hand.
The sound was now much louder, like a maelstrom out in the deepest center of the Atlantic Ocean, fierce and powerful and natural and transcendent.  Dean’s heart was beating so hard in his chest he was sure his ribs were cracking, one by one.  He was panting openly, watching the swirling substances circling over and over and over around him, knowing now that they would all, eventually, come crashing over him, and unable to imagine not being entirely torn apart by the sheer force of it.
Dean could have stayed like this forever.  Eons in time could have passed by without him aware of it, or it could have been the thinnest sliver of a second between one of his cells shifting to a new place inside his body.  His body…
When their kiss finally broke, Cas’s breath washed over Dean’s flushed face, their noses brushing together as Dean leaned his forehead against Cas’s and swallowed.  “I saved you,” Dean said, “because I love you too, Cas.  I love you.”  The words that had been on the tip of his tongue for so many years now tripped off of it effortlessly now, almost in a rush, as if they’d been just waiting for him to set them free.
“Jack,” Sam stepped forward a little and Dean spared a glance his way before looking back at their pseudo-son, “can you…see like that?”
“My brother did not last long as Death,” Michael responded monotonously, and Eve sighed exasperatedly by his side.  “Father was not happy with him for screwing up his plan to get the Book of God’s Death.  Let’s just say, Lucifer’s usefulness was spent, and Father was in quite a mood—you remember, I’m sure.”  The smile that spread across Michael’s face could not have been further from natural, and Dean felt chills ratchet down the notches of his spine.
As Dean uttered the words from the page, his deep and raspy voice jaggedly stabbing the silent atmosphere around the brothers, a small spot emerged in the center of the floor in the straw-strewn barn.  At first, it seemed like a bubbling little pit of oil had decided to break the surface of the Earth, rolling and rippling.  But the hole grew, and grew, wider and larger.  Sam backed up, quickly moving over to Dean’s side of the barn, clenching something inside his palm very hard.
“Yes, I did.”  Cas’s voice was firm, deep, and resolute, and Dean felt his chest constrict with the almost painful conviction of the words.  “And always have, and always will.  Forever.”
“Do you?”  Dean asked urgently, raising his eyebrows, and Sam nodded in response, this time very emphatically.
Looking back, Sam pressed his lips together in an apologetic but firm expression that Dean knew meant that he wasn’t going to suddenly turn back around and stay.  Dean felt his eyes drying out as his wide, panicking gaze followed Sam’s and Eileen’s figures until they were out of sight down the hallway leading toward the kitchen.  His heart beat fast and loud in his ears as he was forced to look back at Cas, who locked eyes with him immediately.
“Listen I…I know how you let the guilt of losing someone weigh you down even when it isn’t your fault, I know that, but…” Cas made a movement with his shoulders that resembled a shrug and a fidget of discomfort simultaneously, and Cas lowered his eyes to fixate somewhere around the area of Dean’s knees instead of his face.  “I thought I…well I thought I made it clear that I was…at peace with my decision, that you didn’t have to worry about those kinds of regrets for me.  I made my choice knowing exactly how you…how you felt, and saving you was a…joy for me, I wouldn’t have had it any other way.”  After these words, Cas took a sharp breath in and nodded once, swallowing as he met Dean’s gaze again.  “You didn’t need to do this, you don’t owe me anything.  I gave my life freely.  I’d do it again, without hesitation.”
Dean nodded. The man looked around nervously, but Dean could tell he was a desperate man. If he had been a crossroads demon, this would have been an easy score. Unfortunately, that was not the position those downstairs had given to him. He wasn’t quite sure what he was really doing here to begin with, other than the ‘causing a ruckus’ part of the job. However, it wasn’t his place to question them.
Kevin crossed his arms. “I’ll try and find something about Death in the tablets. I don’t think he’s an angel or a demon, so there may be nothing.”
“Close,” Dean replied, tossing the holy oil in his duffel. “You know that guy Metatron? Total douchebag. Stole Cas’ grace, concocted a spell. Now all of the angels have been ejected from Heaven. Not surprised the bunker locked down, it’s like hundreds of nukes fell at once.”
“We may have bigger fish to fry,” Dean stated, and headed back towards the library room to put the holy oil in the duffel. Kevin followed close behind.
“We were hoping to find a demon with knowledge of where you were, but coincidentally, we found you.”
It was the early morning, they weren’t expecting to see Eileen and Sam still sitting in the library having coffee. Sam glanced at them walking through the doorway, doing a double-take before setting his cup down and rushing to them, knocking a chair over.
Jack stood in the doorway, slackjawed and shocked at the scene unfolding in front of him. He felt the pain radiating off them. He felt Sam’s heart yearn for Eileen the same way Dean’s did for Cas. He watched them bond and grieve in a way he has never seen them act. It was too vulnerable to be real, he blinked like he was hallucinating, like this was some weird hell he was sucked into, to feel the pain of his family being broken apart for the rest of time.
The bar filled up very fast. Sam and Eileen were off getting their photos taken by Kaia, she’s really gotten into photography lately. She takes creepy abandoned house photos on hunts with Claire and sells them now.
“Dean,” Sam laughed slightly, “he knows, he has to. But if he doesn’t you can tell him when we get him back. And we will get him back.”
“Should we keep hunting? Should we buy a house? Should I get a job? Do you want kids one day? What are we going to do with our time now?”
The sun was setting, it was a beautiful orange and pink sky that stretched over the cornfield across from the bar. He walked towards it, following the path in the middle that led him all the way to a beautiful little farmhouse, one that Dean knew he had seen before but couldn’t place where.
It doesn’t take long for it to get dark, with a wave of his hands Jack strings lights over the dance floor and handing through the trees. The music plays throughout the evening, they have a large dinner followed by cake and of course, Sam and Eileen’s first dance.
He brought breakfast back from Sam and Eileen, laying it on the table before knocking on their door. “Rise and shine kids, breakfast is waiting for you.”
Sam turned around with tears in his own eyes and pulled Dean into a quick hug. Dean patted him on the back before sending him on his way back down the aisle with his new bride.
Dean had a terrible thought, that one day if he was lucky enough he would be old and brittle and useless, but Castiel would never age with him. He’d never really get to experience growing old with him. “So one day I’ll just be old and die and you’ll always be this young handsome angel?”
Everyone they loved, everyone that played a part in their story was there, in his yard, and they were happy. For the first time in his life, there was a party of hunters taking place in front of him and it wasn’t a funeral.
They spent a few nights in hotels, Jo drove her little mini cooper behind them on their way to the portal. He was exhausted and anxious and donna knew that, so she sat close, talked when he wanted to and made sure he was okay.
Dean wrapped his arm around him and led him back down the hall to the Map table, “you know, you don’t have to do all this.”
“No,” Jack smiled. “I can put the bunker back in the full power it had when Mrs. Butters was here, with working alarms, better warding, the telescope will work again.”
“He told me I changed him before he was taken,” Dean looked down at the table, taking a breath to calm himself. “That because of my faith in the world he started to love humanity. He fell in love with me, and every damn time someone said that he ‘gripped me tight’ and was lost in the process, they all knew and I never clued in. He gave his life so I could save the world and I couldn’t even say it back.”
“Hello,” Jack greets everyone with a single hand. “I’ve never done a wedding before,” he says and the crowd laughs lightly. “For those of you who don’t know me I’m Jack, Castiel the angel is my father, which would make Dean my step-dad and Sam here my uncle.” he got yet another laugh from the crowd, he smiled softly to himself.
He called Donna 2 hours into the drive to see where she was and if she would want to join him in confronting Anael. “Good mornin’ Dean-o, how are ya?”
“Now you hang from my lips, like the Gardens of Babylon. With your boots beneath my bed, forever is the sweetest con,” he whispers in Dean’s ear. “You're a cowboy like me. And I'm never gonna love again.”
“It’s been what, 15 years since I died, so a little over 1000 years in hell. It’s been interesting, to say the least.”
“Yeah?” Dean tilted his head, “I think I washed your jeans from when you were human and put them in a drawer hold on.”
“You learned more sign language for me, you were willing to go at my pace and follow my lead and we lived separate lives while still loving each other. Loving you is light and free and wonderful. I feel like a princess, but a badass one that helps you kick the shit out of the dragon. I feel beyond blessed to spend the rest of my life with you, Sam. I vow to love you with my entire heart, in this life, my last, and for however long eternity ends up being.”
“And I think back to when there was a time when I thought love made you crazy, and I had to become like my Dad and I’d go nuts and hunt things down and kill and hate my kids because I no longer have their other parent to help me love them and it sucked, but you came back to me and the presence of your love in my life changed me as a man. I never wanted to be like my father and you reminded me I didn’t have to be. Loving you makes me a better person, and being loved by you makes me feel like the only man in the world.”
He had never really noticed how cold, damp and truly alone the bunker felt until now. He took any excuse he could to leave. He took Miracle on walks, he went to the library in town to read, he sat in random bars along route 36 and drank till he couldn’t think straight anymore before sitting in his car with a cup of coffee and the view of the sunrise.
He made sure to practice the next part of his speech carefully every night for weeks, wanting to address Eileen in sign language to tell her how much she means to him.
“Not lately, but he’s around here somewhere,” Jo said, standing up to bring dean in for a hug. “I’m sure a simple prayer will bring him here.”
She laughed lightly to herself, “you really think that the 3-year-old half-angel would be able to construct this new heaven by himself? Of course he rebuilt Castiel for the millionth time and the two of them have been working their asses off. I’m tired of hearing the updates.”
He felt his heart slip into his stomach. He swallowed sharply, he felt sick. Getting possessed by another angel was not something he wanted. It was surely trauma, he knew this was PTSD deep down. But he pushed it aside, closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Cas was worth it.
Dean woke up at 9 am, he went out for coffee and breakfast, getting extra sausages for Miracle. She was a spoiled dog but she deserved it. Dean loved her, she filled a void in his heart and kept him going. She was soft and understanding, she stared back at him with the same empty confused look that Cas had when Dean talked. He needed that.
He still remembers hell, he remembers the pain of being ripped apart at the seams. He remembers the bright light that stormed in and raised him from perdition. He placed his hand on his arm, it laid perfectly on top of the dried blood of Castiel’s most recent handprint.
“Good evening everyone, how is everyone enjoying the night?” he asks awkwardly in front of the mic. Everyone cheers to fill in the silence he leaves.
“Well, everyone in the Empty was wide awake. Angels I haven’t seen in ages, demons I’ve had a hand in killing, friends and foes all just together, talking and wondering what was going on,” Cas explained. “It was strange, the shadow that rules the empty couldn’t get us to go back to sleep, it was curled up in the corner shaking while we all socialized. Crowley says hello by the way.”
Eileen got up from her seat and walked over to Dean to give him a big hug while everyone cheered, “thanks for raising him to be so loveable,” she said to him softly.
2 cheeseburgers, the works, extra-large fries to share, and 2 milkshakes. Dean was in heaven, he always loved this place as a kid. Bobby took them almost every time they stayed with him, mainly because he didn’t cook, but also because it was beyond delicious.
“I have never been happier than when I’m with you, we could be 10 seconds away from dying but with you, beside me, I’d still have a smile on my face. I only want to live if you’re right beside me. I love you so much.
“Meeting you changed my life, you flipped everything I thought I knew on its head,” a tear slipped down his cheek. “I vow to make your coffee every morning and eat real bacon with you in the mornings after you make margaritas. Most importantly I vow to love you for the rest of time, to cherish every single moment I get with you because you make the world a better place.”
“The empty,” Jack replied before Dean could. “When I was dying and you were planning to bring me back Cas had to make a deal with the empty to release me. They wanted to hurt him. They wanted him to suffer as much as they were suffering from being awake. They said they would reap his soul when he was finally happy.”
He opened the door, a sigil had been etched into the stone walls. It lit up angelic blue and Jack emerged through it. He smiled and lifted his hand, “hello.”
Eileen’s parents and Mary are all sat at a table together smiling and laughing, her Bobby has his arm around her and a smile on his face. Dean’s Bobby is behind the bar making drinks with Karen and Rufus sitting in front of him, he’s got his hands full with those two. It was nice to see that he didn’t have to choose between them in heaven, he looks so happy.
Castiel was smart, he knew Dean like the back of his hand. He knew his trauma and fears and doubts. He knew his intentions were good and his heart was pure and he knew that he wasn’t able to allow himself to feel yet. There was still a part of him that didn’t know if this was written into the chapter or improvised on the spot. He knew Dean was still struggling, he knew he was going through the most trauma he ever has. He knew this information overload would fry his brain and he accepted that Dean wouldn’t be able to say “I Love You” right back.
In a weird way, he had never felt more alive than at that moment. He had never felt more real and in control than he has felt in his whole life. He was feeling, he was computing the feelings and allowing himself to feel them.
He pushed the doors open to see some of his friends and family sitting at the bar. They all turned to greet him as he walked in.
“I do,” she says softly before doing the same, “with this ring I ask you to be my person, to love and to cherish, forevermore.”
Castiel had followed him into Enough restaurants to know that Dean liked to be able to see the exit when he ate, he felt safer seeing every face that walked in. Dean opened the door to the diner for them this time, Castiel walked in first and sat in the booth facing a wall so Dean could sit across from him.
That night he was just laying in his bed, thinking of the last 15 years of his life, what every sacrifice and wrong turn meant for them. He knew he could ask Jack for help, but he also knew that the last few times he’s been in contact with a godly powerful being, it hasn’t ended well for him. Castiel being full of leviathans, thinking he was god, that was scary. Amara wounding Chuck draining the sun, that was terrifying. Chuck killing everyone he ever loved, totally and completely unbearable.
She smiled softly, looking down at the table as she blushed a little. “It’s amazing. She knows me better than anyone, she cares about me and treats me the way I deserve to be treated and she’s my person, there is nothing better than waking up beside her every morning and knowing we get to take on the world together, forever. I never feel ugly or stupid around her, she’s always going to be my best friend first and foremost, but the romance is a very nice bonus.”
Castiel flew Donna home the next morning. She didn’t want to impose on them being reunited, and she always wanted to know what it was like to fly. When he returned Dean was already driving down a long highway.
He scoffed before pulling Eileen into a hug as well, he smiled lightly as he let her go looking down at her with a wink. It made him happy to know Sam had her.
Cas slipped into a pair of Dean’s boots, Dean put his phone and wallet in his pockets he grabbed his keys, took Castiel’s hand in his and led them down the hallway. They passed Sam and Eileen cooking in the kitchen, Dean backed up to peek his head in.
Dean wiped the tears off his cheeks and sniffled a bit, “Hell yeah I do!” he tried to compensate, to which everyone in the crowd awed over. He handed the rings to Jack, watching him take them out of the little felt bag and hold them in his hand.
Dean nodded, afraid that if he spoke he’d make a noise he wouldn’t be proud of. The covers were pulled up over them, Dean’s nails dug crescent moons into Castiel’s back as he held onto him. The hot air leaving his mouth in steady pants filled the space around them.
Dean pressed their foreheads together and looks down between them to slide one of the rings over Castiel’s ring finger. “So with this ring, I vow to love you as long as the universe exists, and then some.”
“He’s gone,” Dean finally managed to get out. “He told me he loved me and now he’s fucking gone.” he pulled back to look Sam in the eyes.
Castiel leaned in for another kiss, pressing his lips against deans softly as he took a deep breath in through his nose, it just felt right. Like they were always meant to be together, he wished they could have done this sooner.
“Dean,” Sam said softly, tilting his head in sympathy. “We’ll find something. We can call all the other hunters and see if anyone knows of any lore, we can visit Rowina see if her or the demons know anything. There’s gotta be a way to get to him.”
“I-” he goes to speak but abandons the sentence to pull Dean into a kiss. “I love you,” he whispers against Dean’s lips.
“It is an absolute honour that they asked me to officiate this wedding today, so without further ado, Eileen would you like to say your vows first?”
“Well then, I’m going to step out and find Cas, but I’ll see you guys again one day. Save me some beer.” he hugged them all on his way out, he took one more look at them and smiled before stepping outside again.
“I’ve known Sam my whole life, but he is more like an older brother to me, he has always believed in me, cared for me, and he played a part in showing me what love and found family really meant.
Dean hugged him next, then Cas. Eileen just smiled at him. “You’re not going to give me my hearing back are you?” she said, the sarcasm in her voice was palpable.
Dean took a deep breath, being possessed wasn’t fun, but he had to do it. “Alright, doors open come on in.”
She nodded, “oh yeah, my parent’s house is just a few minutes down the road they come here for drinks and karaoke nights. Your mom and my mom have tea together sometimes actually, they’re neighbours.”
Life felt wrong without him. Like it wasn’t a win if he didn’t get to be happy. He worked for everyone else’s happiness and didn’t even get any for himself. He was sadly used to it, but this time he was going to get his happy ending.
“I have a lot of work to do, angels to make, prayers to answer,” he said, he has grown up so much so soon. “But if I need any help or advice, can I pop down and see you?”
He didn’t know what to do next, none of them did. So they sat there, and they hugged and they cried and they felt. It was so emotionally overwhelming Dean felt like he was suffocating.
The room disappears, just the two of them swaying together to the beat. He kisses his shoulder and cheek occasionally, rubbing his hand on Cas’s back softly. He’s so content he could stay there forever.
“I’ll start,” Sam announced. “Eileen and I are going to re-brand the bunker to the fellowship of letters. Invite Claire and Kaia and other hunters to move in and take assignments and work together as a unit.”
“Understanding the world as quickly as I had to under the supervision of the Winchesters was a challenge. I met Sam when he was still mourning Eileen, I met a Sam Winchester who had felt the immense loss of love time and time again and he taught me that we fight for who we love, we remember them when they’re gone but most of all we should be thankful for every moment we have with them.
“Well go on in and see him, its right through the door there and on the left,” Dean pointed at the glass sliding door in the backyard.
Eileen jumped as she lunged for his mouth. Sam held her around her waist as he kissed her swaying her before he placed her back on the ground as their lips separated once more. The whole room clapped and cheered, Castiel whistled loud enough to deafen Dean but he didn’t care. This was the best moment of his brother’s life, and he felt so proud he sobbed.
He sat on the edge of his bed and watched him get dressed, he faced the wall and Dean got to stare at his cute butt. He smiled to himself, he was so happy that this was going to be his life now. The man he loved had sex with him and stayed after for showers, sharing clothes and going to breakfast with him. That’s all he’s wanted.
He opened the little bag and slid the two rings out into his hand. “Sam had the gold knife Eileen used on their first hunt together melted down to make their rings. And I stole the idea completely and had our rings made out of your original angel blade.”
Donna opens the door to the impala and just stands there, a huge smile on her face, a hand on her heart. “Thank god,” she whispers to herself.
She smirked, “our new God busted Castiel out already, seems like the Winchesters only know how to raise codependency and daddy issues.”
He sat there and cried and he let himself hurt. He put himself first, because he deserved it for once fucking second he deserved to feel the love, feel the loss.
Castiel picked him up and laid him on the bed. If Dean hadn’t been in heaven just yesterday he’d think he was right now.
“Yeah.” Dean croaked, sobbing uncontrollably. His cheeks were soaking wet, his eyes stung from the tears and his heart was bursting.
“Yeah,” Bobby laughed, “he’s a character that's for sure. But I’m glad to see you got your head out of your ass and got with him.”
Speech after speech, there are a million cheers and too many shots taken. Everyone starts sharing stories and yelling over each other, they head to the dance floor for more dancing and drunken fun.
He dug through his box of cassette tapes, still parked in the garage. He found one of his mixtapes, ‘huckleberry’, it was inconspicuous enough that Sam wouldn’t pick it and wouldn’t think it was about Castiel.
His phone kept ringing, the sound of the vibration on the concrete echoed against the walls, bouncing off the mental shelves in the corners and ringing in his ears at a deafening volume. He knew he had to tell sam he was okay. He knew he had to help sam in whatever new issue has arisen.
Dean held him close, letting him ramble on in his ear about everything they’ve been up to. “How much more do you have to do up here before I can bring Cas back home with me?”
They turn to look at each other, they’re holding hands lightly while staring into each other's glossy eyes with wide smiles. A part of Dean wishes he was on the other side so he could witness the happiest moment of his brother’s life head-on. All he’s ever wanted for Sam was this, normalcy, health, love, happiness. And Eileen was the last puzzle piece in him achieving that.
Cas took the other ring from him and slid it over Dean’s finger, “And I offer you this ring to wear as a symbol of our unbreakable bond. It is a reminder of my eternal faith and unwavering dedication to you.”
“I told Anael that if she got me up here Jack would give her her wings back,” Dean said with a smile. “I don’t even know if he can, I just needed to see you again Cas. I can’t live without you I worked too fucking hard to get my happy ending just to not get to spend it with you.”
“You know that the archangels are the strongest not only because God made them first but because he loved them the most. He was the most connected to them, he raised them and they have that power from the relationship,” he said as Dean nodded along. “Well, now that Jack is God, and I am his family and the closest to him, I have gained a lot of power.”
Dean was quick to lunge forward and kiss him. He held Cas’s face in his hands as he kissed him, he felt Castiel wrap his arms around his waist and pull him in closer. They twisted their bodies and found a comfortable way to lay there and makeout.
“But Dean is tired from driving so much, I’m sure you two haven’t slept either, you should all get some rest,” Castiel suggested, “we will see you later.”
“Cas,” he whispered in a moment where the sobs stilled, “if you still have your ears on,” he bit his lip, holding back a sob with his eyes squeezed shut. “I love you.” he sobbed to himself.
Before he could even blink he felt himself get lifted and gently dropped. He opened his eyes to see the bright fluorescents of the bunker’s garage. He sat up in amazement, Cas had just picked up and dropped the car back in the bunker, like it was nothing.
“I’ll meet you in the bathroom,” he leaned in and kissed him on the lips before getting out of the bed and throwing his robe on.
“Oh we’re not doing that,” he awkwardly laughed. “Sam and Eileen really just wanted the party, marriage doesn’t really feel the same since beefing with God and being wanted by the government, y’know?”
“Oh yes,” he nodded, “it’s been a non-stop party for the last two weeks up there, but how are you? What are you going to do now?”
“I think I needed it,” he said softly. “I needed to know life without you again to appreciate what I could have with you. I was so mean, I put you through shit that has hurt you and I’m so sorry. I could have spent all these years loving you but I didn’t. And the thought that I could never have you again was so unbearable it’s made me love you even more. You’re everything to me cas.”
He remembers the first time he met Cas, how absolutely terrifying he was. He remembered the little moments here and there that made him feel like Cas loved him, he thought he’d never get to know for sure. The same thoughts of ‘he’s an angel he could never’ beat the doubt into him, then over time he saw more angels fall in love. He knew Cas had the potential to disobey in every other way, why did he never admit his feelings sooner.
For the first time in his whole life, he left himself mourn.  Every other time he’s been hurt, every time he felt like his heart was ripped from his chest, he pushed the pain down and defeated the next enemy. There was always an issue that he needed to fix and a person he needed to save because maybe saving more people would prepare the hole in his heart from everyone he’s lost before.
When everything was said and done with chuck, Sam got back in Eileen’s car and he raced back to her doorstep. She was sitting on the front steps when he got there. Their reunion was sweet and passionate and everything Dean didn’t want to hear, even after he asked how it went.
He spent so much of his energy helping the ones he loved that he failed to see that Castiel did the exact same thing for him.
“I know you have a lot of trauma around what happened with heaven, and so I took something that was once so destructive and held so much power and I changed it. Because if I’ve learned anything from you over these years is that a little love can go a long way, it can save the world. And I wanted you to see that everything from your past led you here, you paved the way and changed my world and no amount of destruction could stop me from loving you.”
He looked into Castiels eyes, he saw the happiness, the sparkle that he hadn’t seen before. The feeling of Dean just knowing he’s always loved him was so much that he didn’t even need to hear it back. And his smile, his tiny smile and tiny nod was the acknowledgement that he knew Dean felt the same.
Dean smiled and shook his head lightly, the insanity of it all still running rampant in his mind. “She’s Irish, she holds her liquor better than any of us and she will be the life of the party tonight. She is tough and opinionated and amazing. I’ve known Sam for a long time, but he feels more complete with her in his life.”
She pulls her hands away from Sam’s grip, “Sam Winchester,” she signs and speaks at the same time for everyone. “I always thought that the day I got revenge for my parents’ death would be the best day of my life. Don’t get me wrong, revenge is sweet, but meeting you at the same time was a blessing. You are so caring, your heart is huge. Which makes sense, ‘cause you’re gigantic,” she couldn’t help but laugh along with the guests.
For 2 weeks now he has been ‘on vacation’ in the bunker, it’s just him and Miracle while Sam and Eileen take some time off together.
That’s all Dean wants. The mundane every day love that would come from settling down with someone who knows him this well. Castiel knows his secrets and traumas from the deepest and darkest parts of his mind, he treats him like he’s worth being loved and cared for, he makes loving easy. “I want that.”
Cas was by the sound system, plugging in his phone and telling Garth what song to put on. “You’re not going to have me dance to a sappy pop song are you?”
He awkwardly shakes Eileen's Dad’s hand and hugs both her mothers. He almost cries in Rowena’s arms once he sees her. He didn’t think she’d actually come. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world dear,” she assured him.
“Shut up,” Dean said calming himself down, running his hands down the sleeves of Castiel’s suit jacket, “okay,” he said with a deep breath.
Castiel’s hand slid up his side, he traced his arm as he made his way to cup Dean’s cheek. Dean whimpered, he felt himself getting so close, he was so unbelievably turned on, more than he ever has been in his whole entire life. It felt right. So right.
“Perfect, I’ll call Donna or Jody and see if any of them want to come up and join me. I haven’t seen the girls in a while,” Dean smiled, he loved those ladies quite a lot.
Sam calls while they’re driving, Donna is sound asleep in the back seat, Castiel is holding his hand while they drive. Dean hands the phone to Cas, “you tell him.”
She huffed and shook her head in disbelief, “Fine, but after all this, I never want to see another Winchester ever again.”
Sam surprises her by getting a small speaker and putting it in his suit pocket, he plays their song through it so she can place her hand on his chest to feel the music. The room watched in silence as the two of them sway together in the centre of the room. Totally encapsulated by the moment.
“I’ve been alive for 3 years,” he said as he sat down, “and all I’ve seen is you, Cas and Sam working so hard to make the world better. I don’t think it’s in me to give up on the world as Chuck did, there are too many wonderful things here to just walk away from.”
He felt incredibly lonely for the first few days, he was still grieving, he knew that. So he tried his best to cope, he kept himself busy, he worked as hard as he could to keep his thoughts from spiralling like they did last time.
The tape slid into the radio with a click, he hit play and turned it up. ‘Who Do You Love’ came roaring through the speakers. He smiled to himself and backed up out of his spot before speeding out of the room.
“I can remember all the conversations we’ve had in that car. From teaching you your ABC’s to coaching you through asking Eileen out,” he says softly, smiling at the two of them. “I remember Sam’s first heartbreak pretty clearly, and I remember telling him ‘if this is how much it hurts to let go of your first love, imagine just how much you’ll love your soulmate.’”
He made sure everyone had crossed back over one last time before organizing them all into groups to drive back to his house behind him, it took longer than he thought, everyone just wanted to chat with him.
He didn’t want to tell Sam what he was doing, he didn’t want him to object to it or stop it or talk him out of it because he needed to do something for his own good for once. So he just told him they were going to a storage unit a few states over and he would check in when he could. He needed to stop caring if everyone around him was comfortable and okay with his decisions and he needed to just follow his heart.
Dean watches as his mom looks around, “mom,” he calls her over. “Bobby is inside on the couch with our dog, I didn’t tell him you were coming.”
“Okay,” he took a deep breath and opened the door. Blinding sunlight hit his face as he stepped through the door.
He let out one final moan as he came over Castiel’s fist and all up his chest. He couldn’t steady his breath, his heart was beating so fast. Every emotion possible rushed over him and his only reaction was to start quietly crying.
“Dean Winchester, to what do I owe the pleasure,” she said as she turned around. “And you’ve brought a new friend. Where's your brother and the broken angel?”
Cas reached his hand across the table to hold his. “I have something to tell you too,” he said softly.
They spent their time off together visiting museums, they went to farmers markets and the beach and they did what any normal couple would do when falling in love, only they were already very deeply in love. It was a nice turn of pace knowing no one was writing her out of Sam’s story tragically just because they could.
He was standing on route 36, the sign that once said ‘welcome to Lawrence’ now welcomed him to a town called Winchester, Kansas. He started walking down the road, towards the centre of town where he found Harvelle's roadhouse in perfect condition, just waiting for him.
“A lot better than the last place, that book they left me with was boring as hell,” Bobby said, “at least when I was in hell they kept me on my toes.”
“Dean,” he hears someone call to him. He turns to see Bella smiling at him. She passes him a beer and sat down beside him. “A lot has happened since we died.”
Cas closed his eyes in silent prayer, “follow me.” Cas led them all down the hall to Jack’s bedroom.
“No.” he knew she would want to work out a deal, she would need some pretty big gift to do this. “if you get me into heaven I’ll get Jack to give you your wings back.” he blurted out.
Castiel broke from the kiss to press his lips to Dean’s cheek and jaw and down his neck. “I would give anything to be back at home with you right now, in my bed,” Dean whispered into his ear.
“And you deserve it, you deserve something good in your life. Your reward for saving the world should be getting to live happily ever after.”
He’s welcomed with a cheer and a round of hugs from everyone before a puff of Purple smoke erupted in the corner of the room. “Do you really think you can have a party without me?” Rowena appeared with a smile.
“Follow me,” Dean took Castiel by the hand and led him into the garage, closing the door behind them.
“Yeah,” Dean blushed, embarrassed to share his feelings. “He did his typical Chuck speech, said it would be ‘an honour to be killed by Dean Winchester, the world's best killer,’” he laughed at the absurdity. “But that’s not who I am, is it?”
Garth and his little ones were running around the field with Miracle. Patience introduced Missouri to her newfound family. Ellen, Ash and Pamala were taking shots together. All their apocalypse friends were clearing chairs to make room for Dancing. Dinner was being prepped in the kitchen. Jack and Kelly walked hand in hand down the road together looking at the field.
Castiel appeared in the passenger seat next to him, no matter how many times he did it, it would always startle Dean.
He couldn’t stop the sobs this time, he whaled and thrashed and threw himself onto the floor even more, like the emotions he hasn’t been allowed to feel for the last 43 years of his life all left his body in one scream. His fists were bloody from smacking the concrete floor, his face was hot and puffy and he couldn’t feel his legs anymore. He was wrecked.
Dean couldn’t stop smiling, he squeezed Castiel's hand in excitement “are you going to come and visit soon?”
He ran his fingers over Castiel's skin as they laid together, “Found her when Chuck snapped everyone off the earth. She’s mine now,” he yawned. “I have to get up and feed her, then we should go get some coffee, and a shower.”
She looked at her with a brow raised, “I like you,” she said as she stood up and walked over to them. “So, let me guess, you need help finding a rare item that I’ve probably traded. You can come up with an original idea every once and a while you know?”
Dean shook his head, fake annoyed. He reached inside the pocket of his suit, moving the pocket square out of the way to find another small felt bag like the one he handed Jack. “I made us something.”
If he couldn’t ask Jack, he had to find his own way into the empty. Surely it had a secret entrance. Purgatory had a portal, which also worked as a backdoor into hell. They had a key to death’s library, which the empty was able to access. And, there was a playground entrance to heaven.
Sam is by the bar, a glass of whisky in his hands, his suit in a bag on the chair beside himself. He looks up and his eyes widen. “What the fuck?”
Castiel laughed as he wrapped his arms around Dean and lightly rocked him back and forth. “Hello, Dean.”
Eileen looked puzzled, “Chuck had said Cas never followed his story, and he really hasn’t. Every time something went wrong it was typically something to do with Cas, even when he had me go to death’s library, he chooses paths that even god himself had no hand in laying. And I think it’s because he fell in love with my brother.”
Dean wrapped him in his arms so tight he couldn’t let go. He cried again, holding him with his head in the crook of Jack’s neck. “And Cas loved you so much” he reached out for Sam and pulled him into the hug, “he said he loved all of us.”
He flicked on the radio, making sure the volume was low enough that it didn’t wake Donna, they were basically cuddling while he drove.
He nodded, “this crazy journey of a life I’ve been on started with my dad handing me my brother while our house burnt down. And I think it’s time I hand Sam off to live his own life where I’m not constantly making sure that he’s okay. And I want to apply to be a volunteer firefighter.”
“And I think we should get a house and be normal people, we can get that big yard you talked about with some animals and a garden and a big lawn so I can get a rideable mower I’ve always wanted one of those, an-”
“Bastard!” she joking smacked his arm, “I looked for the first blade for years. I had a buyer offering 30 million for it at one point.”
They mingle around with everyone for a while. Dean is way too excited to introduce Charlie and Jo to Donna and Jody.
“Not the best but not the worst,” he was being honest for a change, “it’s beyond crazy to say this but the last few times he’s died the world needed saving, I had to split my grief with fixing new problems. But now I don’t have to save the world, I just need to get mine back.”
Dean’s heart broke at the sound of Kevin’s distraught voice, and he forced down his tears as much as he could, breathing through his teeth and looking at the ground to avoid Kevin’s look of despair. He placed a hand on Kevin’s shoulder, but he wasn’t sure if it was more comforting for Kevin or for himself.
He pulled the angel blade out of Castiel’s shoulder, the blinding light shining through as blood spilled from the wound. “So, Cas- can I call you Cas?”
Of course, not a single person had caught him, which is why he avoided running into the one person he knew might: Sam Winchester.  And the demon, Ruby, he paraded around with. He didn't avoid his brother out of fear, but in knowing what Sam was capable of on his own, more so since he’d heard that his little brother’s powers had jump-started again- except now he could exorcize demons without a word. So, the older Winchester decided not to go near him if he could help it, and stuck to his own mischief-making course of action, which he assumed no one could track if he kept switching from vessel to vessel. However, he’d learned from too much experience not to underestimate his brother. Dean kept his distance.
All jokes aside i actually dont know when ill update this next, its kind of back and forth. I am super happy Destiel is semi-canon (until the one millionth canonization) cause it means a lot to me. Sorry, im gushing!! Im just happy and angry at the same time! Ahh...supernatural...
Dean froze, confused and struck that the angel knew his name. Why would they want him? He wasn’t special. His brother was one of Azazel’s finest creations, constantly raving about the power Sam would one day wield. Dean was his lousy, dead older brother. Why did they need Dean of all people?
Dean stomped down the steps and Kevin rushed to his side. They stood in silence for a few moments, neither knowing what to say about the obvious elephant in the room.
Something screamed inside of him, begging him not to hurt Sam. The entire reason Dean was as he is now is because he had made a deal to save Sam from a demon. Now, as a demon, he had to kill him. Dean remembered his father’s last warning; If he couldn’t save Sam, he would have to kill him.
Dean stood still as the angel breathed heavily, laying on the ground, looking over to his fallen comrade. Dean gripped the blade tight in his hands, ready to kill the damn thing. It was helpless on the floor, unable to heal its own wounds and Dean walked over to him, a grin tugging at his lips as he did so. The angel frowned towards him with a look of hatred in his eyes that was somewhat intimidating.
“I hadn’t known the crossroads demon we’d been tracking was your brother. I’ve had my suspicions since Pontiac, but… I didn’t truly know he’d turned until we saw him today,” Ruby explained, leaning away from the wall and sitting down across the table to speak to Sam.
Once again, Dean had hand-picked another vessel. Attempting to stray from his usual MO this time, he picked a homeless man. Of course, he could still ruin this poor guy's life in any way he wanted, but he decided the best course of action was to lay low- from both the angels and Sam Winchester.
“Trust me, they aren’t listening,” Dean said bitterly. Dean pulled a brass goblet from his coat and pried the man’s hands from his throat. The man pushed him away, weakly trying to claw at Dean’s face. Dean simply swatted the man’s hands away like a child, and he pushed the goblet against the gushing open wound with ease, slowly filling it with the man’s blood. Tears ran down the man’s face, a mix of horror and pain etched across his face. Dean wanted him to suffer like this, his eyes open to witness Dean collecting his blood for a simple phone call downstairs. The feeling wasn’t joy, more a rush of exhilaration. There were so many ways to make it worse.
Dean seemed to have read whatever expression Sam showed, and his playful smirk melted away. He sat down at the other end of the table, setting his beer down with a soft clang.
Dean stumbled back a few steps, the knife hurting even more than he’d pictured when he was once a hunter, and her eyes widened at the sight of him in recognition. He grinned, pulling the knife from his shoulder and throwing it at her. The demon knife stopped mid-air, another force stopping it from reaching its desired destination. It clattered to the ground and Dean was launched against the wall of the abandoned building not too far from where he stood in the parking lot. His black gaze would dart from the ground to the two figures rushing towards him, the ones he’s nearly dreaded to meet. Ruby and her beloved pet, Sam.
The angels approached from the shadows, like they had been waiting there. An ambush, perhaps. There were only two angels and three of his own kind, including himself. Seemed to be an unfair advantage, although, he knew better than to underestimate the unknown. He held the sleek and unfamiliar blade in his hand- said to be the only weapon that could kill an angel. The pompous angels at the other end held the same blades, which meant it could probably kill demons as well. They twirled them in their hands with ease, ready to take them out.
The angel remained silent, glaring at him, his nose twitching and his lips curling ever so slightly into a grimace. Stubborn bastard would rather die than call for help. Dean felt a shrivel of sympathy towards the wounded angel that stubbornly stood his ground, despite being struck down so easily during a mission that was supposedly a simple chore.
His brother, a demon. Black eyes and everything. Sam guessed that maybe him and his brother had more in common now than ever. Not that it would last. Ruby was right. That wasn’t his brother. His brother would never have tried to kill him. Dean spent his whole life trying to protect Sam. Hell, Dean died trying to save him.
