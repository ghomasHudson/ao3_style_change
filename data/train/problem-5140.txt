“Okay, up on the scale.” Tony didn’t look at the number when he got on. Not when Stephen made a noncommittal hum and added more notes to the paper. “You can take your seat.” He sniffed looking over the paper a moment. “Do you mind taking off your shirt?”
“No. You’re fine.” He answers finally, and the hand resumes it’s paused movements and travels up Tony’s cheek past his eyes and forehead and fingers slot through his hair. Bucky gasps slightly and his eyes widened the tiniest bit. Strange how they seemed so focused yet oddly spaced out at the same time.
Tony comes back into the room with a tablet and some kind of beeping bracelet. He’s got a phone pressed to his ear and he’s talking.
“Oh god,” Steve says, ripping his shirt open to get a better look. The wound goes through Tony’s side all the way.
“Does y/n normally wander off in times of crisis like this?” Tony asks, they’ve kind of been looking for you almost twenty minutes now. Steve says he’s got no idea where you would’ve went but he’s sure you wouldn’t have gone far.
Close enough for what you weren’t sure. But here you were following tunnels waiting for your next order. It’s dark everywhere except where the light lands from the flashlight and the ground is uneven. You take a miscalculated step and slip falling forward, holding your arm out reflexively to catch yourself, on your injured hand, calling out in pain as the stitches in your palm rip against the brunt of a rock.
There was more than one smell on Steve’s skin, light layers of different scents piled one on top of the other. First was vinegar, and salt, like pickles. Then something softer, fruit. It was faint, and smooth, probably fabric softener. Then something else, the hardest to detect, and one without name, but memorable.
There’s a man sitting in a chair just down the hall, he stands at their arrival. “Steve, long time no see.” The two shake hands. “How’s Natasha doing?”
“I’m scared of a lot of things Steve. Truly. I even scare myself sometimes. Oddly, the idea of your inexplicable strength, does not scare me.” He leans back on the couch. “Maybe I’m still drunk and it’ll hit me later. I don’t know. Out of all the bad things about today, that’s not even top five.” He runs his uninjured hand over his face. “What am I going to do?”
Steve stands there a few minutes wondering what exactly he’s supposed to say to Tony. Just send him a text out of nowhere about a date when he just was very not okay on the phone with Bucky for three hours. He lets out a deep breath and grabs his phone, carefully typing out a message to Tony and sending it.
The strength came about a year later. He was watching some poor kid gets bullied, and he had enough. At the time, he didn’t look how he did now, piled with muscles. He looked lanky, only growing in height at that point. Muscle mass was soon on its way. One kid had shoved him, laughing off his attempted to tell them to back off peacefully. So, he shoved them back. But instead of just falling, the kid cleared a few feet off the ground with the force of it, landing on a row of lockers denting them.
Tony fought and pushed, clawing at the emptiness that managed to weigh down on him. Until he opened his eyes and realized it had all been a dream. He let out gasping breaths, clutching his chest and turning over in bed, pushing his face into a pillow and curling his body up, making himself smaller, a last-ditch attempt to protect himself until the fear subsided.
Steve sits back down, understanding Bucky’s reluctance. Yeah, there are a lot of benefits to being over six feet tall and two hundred-fifty pounds of pure muscle- and machine in Bucky’s case. For instance, people won’t break into your house, or play music once the sun goes down. Then there are the pranks when no matter what crazy diets Steve and Bucky lie and say they are on to mess with people, they believe them. There are people who find them insanely hot, they get random love letters and teenage girls follow them around the gym sometimes ‘oohing and ahhing’.
You chuckle to yourself when you realized Stephen lied to you when he said the supplies weren’t for you. Although that doesn’t bother you much. Knowing you would need stitches wouldn’t have made you feel better or helped you suddenly expect to see a creature walking around the streets.
Once Steve was gone, they entered the room, Tony taking seat on the patient bed, feeling his heart race. The doctor washed his hands and placed gloves on before walking over and gesturing to the arm Tony was cradling.
Things had changed so much, he used to be comfortable with people. With touch, and now he’s scared of it. All because of Killian.
“Yes it is. Look at your face.” He points, the jagged scratches barely stopped bleeding. “I did that.”
He’s sure Steve would understand, after all it’s not a date. This is him finally getting the arm fixed, which Steve has been hounding him about for years. Besides, if he backs out now, Tony might think he’s uncomfortable being touched, which is very much not the case.
It’s whenever he’s not thinking, whenever he doesn’t measure the exact amount of force he’s throwing into a single movement. He’s broken countless cups, keyboards, and phones. But he’s not worried about things; he’s worried about people. There was a girl he was sweet on, she used to frequent the gym, and he’d finally asked her on a date. They went to the fair, rode a few rides, got some funnel cake, and he was walking her home that night. The plan was plain and simple, kiss her on the cheek and ask if she’d like to go out again sometime.
“I have.” Bucky stops him before he finishes the question. “A few times, but that was nothing, that was just relief. It was just to pass the time until I met you.”
Tony slides down to the floor and struggles to catch his breath. His legs are screaming at him in pain and his arms are sore. He really shouldn’t have gone to the gym, it was such a bad idea, who was he kidding. He’s seriously underweight, starving himself accidentally every other day. He can barely keep his head on straight or his breath walking, he should have never been in that gym. All that and now he’s got this soulmate to worry about.
“He’s not taking his medication Pepper; the withdrawals alone form not taking them are concerning enough. Not to mention why he needed them in the first place. I would just feel better if he was taking them again. Can you just… can you just ask him to start them again, his prescription is good, he can get a refill anywhere, just show his ID at the counter.”
Bucky bursts out in a fit of laughter so strong her doubles over clutching his stomach. Steve laughs along at the sight of him.
“Tony, you shouldn’t use language like that around the kid,” Steve called from the bathroom where he’d been washing the blood off his shirt.
Tony pauses. “Something my mother taught me. Don’t burn bridges you may one day need to walk across.”
“What’d you do?” Steve asks a little warily, wondering how much trouble one can get in for temporarily kidnapping a soulmate. There might be leeway, like soulbond drunkenness, or some form of impatience and desperation. Maybe if they let him go right now it wouldn’t count.
“What?” There’s a knock on the door and cuts off any reply Jarvis could have had. “Is it four already?” Tony asked.
“Yeah.” Steve shrugs. “Or maybe it’s not a coincidence. Maybe Buck and I are such great friends because we’re meant to share a soulmate.”
“There's no way to truly know.” Stephen shrugs, “I don’t have a way to check. We’ll have to wait and see.”
Bucky paused, eyes widening barely a fraction. He clearly hadn’t been expecting Steve to know about that, nor that it’d be brought up during the argument.
He smiles at you and then salutes. Then he turns to the tunnels and inhales deeply before yelling as loudly as he can directly into them. You can hear the echo of it along the tunnel walls traveling all over, and you crouch holding your own breath willing your body not to move an inch as you feel the ground begin to shake and screeches come closer. Steve stays still, reading himself looking into the tunnel. The creatures all running towards him, he waits until they are close enough to see him before running, not too fast though, making sure they all stay on his tail and leading them out of the tunnels making a clear path for you.
“You don’t know that.” Bucky steps out of the closet. Holding the glove. “It’s weird, and… it gets cold, it’s heavy, the skin around it bleeds and gets infected sometimes, and my temper when it hurts… it would make anyone go running. He’s already run from me once. I don’t want him to again.”
Valkyrie hovers above them, guns pointed down at the ready, and Hulk finally recovers charging over and holding Thanos’ legs.
Who would throw parades for the Hulk now? Half of those who cheered his name is gone, and the rest, the rest know how he failed, how he went toe to toe with Thanos and lost.
“Wow.” Bucky whispers, eyes studying every inch of the sketch over and over. Steve raises a hand to scratch the back of his neck and looks a little embarrassed.
He’s a go-getter. Not that he isn’t self-conscious, or never has doubts. But usually, his want overpowers that. He lives in the moment. Hardly ever truly thinks ahead. It’s one of the reasons he gets into trouble so often. His issue is he doesn’t think, and it’s hard to be nervous when you’re not actually thinking about something and all the ways it can go wrong.
You shake your head and look up at them, not finding an ounce of recognition in the woman’s face. “I don’t know this woman.” You whispered, pulling your finger back from the boy’s grip. “I don’t know either of them.”
“No!” Bucky laughs, and Tony can feel it like an echo with both hands on him. “That’s not what I was going to say.” He cards his fingers through Tony’s hair again and smiles, something about it has Tony mirroring it back.
But not clothes. Everyone who faded took their clothing with them. Some things stayed, like phones and keys, metals really. But clothing faded. So, for there to be one lonely shoe on the road, it really stood out. You’d walked over to it, bent to pick it up, and that’s when you saw the blood. There was a light trail of it as if someone was dragged. Your eyes follow the trail and where it ends isn’t far, just down an alleyway a few feet from you.
“Not great.” Tony exhales heavily. “I don’t usually have an appetite, and when I do- I’m too tired to cook.”
It’s better than a ‘we have to go’ Tony supposes, so he’ll take what he can get. He and Bucky stood and they said their goodbyes, repeating with quick shy hugs.
You look back up at Steve, who looks at you with something of confusion and skepticism. Which you realize everyone new you meet will probably have that look. Even with all the craziness happening, it might be a little hard for them to get past the whole voices in your head thing. Somehow, you’ve already stopped caring and accepted it.
“One has challenged the sacrifice of the Soul Stone.” A voice echoes from the gazebo. The both of you turn to face it.
That’s where he’s fallen to. Someone so afraid of the world, of people, that he can’t kiss his soulmate without nearing panic attack territory. If there was anything to make a toast to, it’s this. It feels a bit like playing music as the ship goes down.
He meant to say something else, keep the conversation going but a powerful yawn cut him off and now he’s really feeling it.
“Stop!” It’s a reflex, not like you actually expect the Titan to listen to you. But he does. He freezes, the yellow power circling Thanos mind tightens into a sharp ring and binds in his head. You watch closely as a vine of red, blue, and purple wrap around the yellow and break it apart, allowing him to move again.
When he does finally pull back, he only allows Loki away at an arm’s length, keeping hands on his shoulders. “How? How did you escape death this time?”
The bowl of cereal on the table had been neglected and grew far too soggy for consumption in his inner musings, Tony sighed down at it once he realized. He’s been looking at everything Jarvis could find about this project Arnim and Howard had been working on.
?” You ask aloud. Wondering if Stephen is even listening, and if he is does he know what you're asking about.
“Your hand, your life,” Tony says, backing away, and takes a sip of his soda. Bucky doesn’t move for a moment, and neither does Steve. They’re both waiting for the real reaction, the normal reaction. The screaming, the yelling, the name calling. Anything other than just… this.
“That or he’s just scared of you. I bet that’s what it is. Someone probably told him about the bags.”
It was painful, and gross, as the tongue snapped and pulled from the creature’s mouth. The howl it let out was deafening and it ran past Steve and out of the store, no doubt to curl up and die from blood loss. Much like you, he realized when he’d taken in the scene before him.
Well, some of it was fake. At this point, most of it was just reliving history. Torturous memories back to haunt him. His mind finding new and creative ways to make him experience it all over again.
Steve feels the inexplicable need to cry, shame and desire and sadness mixing up inside him. He looks away.
This isn’t new, either. Lying awake on each other’s beds, sometimes talking, but most of the time, not. What is new is Tony turning towards Steve and sliding an arm under his neck, pulling him close.
Stane is dead; the contract is worthless. In the time between hearing the news and the drive to the last known location of Stark, Steve had made peace with the fact that Stark could still take his revenge after all the months of chasing and mis-aimed shots, shooting as if only to strike fear. For the first time in his life, he’s glad to be proven wrong.
“Yeah,” Steve says, mostly just to say something. He glances at Tony, who’s wrapped in a gray cable-knit sweater.
“Have it,” Steve says, standing up quickly and wincing at the sound of the chair scraping across the wood. He feels Tony’s eyes on him as he leaves the kitchen, but doesn’t turn to check.
“It’s the least I can do,” Steve says, already pouring some beans into the grinder. “Seriously, Tony. You’re already doing so much, it’s honestly kinda amazing how much you juggle every day.” He turns to Tony, looking a bit embarrassed before he finishes by saying, “Well, I guess my point is, you weren’t exaggerating when you said you were a genius, huh?”
aliens, and the moments that Steve wilfully let himself simmer were few and far between. He never wanted to stop because fights, wars, those were old hat by now. He knew how to roll with the punches, how to give as much as he got.
At that moment, I thought about how easy it would be to spoil it all, to kiss him and ruin the years of friendship between us. I didn’t know what I wanted. What I did know is that it felt good, and that was enough.
“Steve,” he says, as he gently pushes away Steve’s hand, “I—I was afraid to find out how you’d react. And this is what I—” Tony sighs again. “I can’t. I can’t just stand by and watch you lie to yourself about Bucky.”
The sky is still dark as they make their way over the city, zooming past the skyscrapers and soon over water. “It’s going to take a few hours,” Tony says to everyone, after JARVIS has finished briefing the team on the estimated number of combatants and other defense mechanisms in the cell.
“Just one,” Tony grins, tapping some weed onto rolling paper. “Come on, we should unwind. There’s still so much week left in this week,” he says, rolling for a bit more before licking the joint closed.
“You’re sure you want this,” Tony says, finally settling in and pushing his nose against Steve’s chest.
“Which part of it?” Tony groans, dumping his bags on the floor then falling, face-first, onto the couch.
“Okay.” Rhodey leans back and pats his lap, and Tony lies back down. “But promise me that if he did hurt you, you’ll let me punch him.”
Steve lies flat on his back, counting the lines on his ceiling, giving his brain the most miniscule activity to keep himself occupied, and get somewhere close enough to calm.
Bruce gets up from his couch and offers his hand to Thor. “Come on Thor, let me show you how to twist.”
She looks at him, unimpressed. Steve opens his mouth to say more, but she shoos him away from her. He finally gives in to himself and rests his hand on top of Tony’s. He wants to do a proper pat down, see if anything’s broken or sprained, but it seems a bit too much to do while Tony’s asleep. For now, Steve finds some comfort in Tony’s pulse, beating slow under his palm.
Tony crowds up against Steve, pressing their bodies together. “I made you feel like I didn’t want you,” he continues to whisper, and Steve’s having trouble focusing on the words, his mind short circuiting at the feel of Tony flush against him.
Steve remembers the pride swelling in his chest as the team took down the base quickly and efficiently, like a well-oiled machine; he’d write the op up for a case study, but there’s no SHIELD anymore that could make use of it.
Natasha doesn’t take the bait. Instead, she sits beside Steve, puts a hand on his shoulder. She means for it to be comforting, Steve knows this, but it irritates him all the same.
Steve smiles up at Tony as he answers Peter’s questions, and Tony turns to Steve, briefly, tilting his head in question.
It’s a perfectly normal Tuesday afternoon. That in itself should have been warning enough, but Bruce is sitting comfortably beside Tony on the couch, and he figures that he ought to make the most of the silence. Tony hums absently to himself as he adjusts calculations on his tablet. He’d come up from the workshop earlier to ask for Bruce’s help, and elected to stay upstairs in case he needed Bruce’s input again to save him the trip.
Despite that, Steve still felt like Tony was a puzzle he hadn’t solved. Tony, who easily draped himself over Steve, pressed soft kisses to his cheek. The same Tony who, after all this, barely met Steve’s eyes when they were alone. Sure, on dates he was the same, bright smiles and easy conversation, but as soon as they were back in the tower he’d step away in a way that Steve felt Tony hoped wasn’t obvious.
The plaza’s not as busy anymore, most bars and restaurants closing as well. Across the square there’s a group of rowdy men, drunkenly singing as they walk.
Tony’s tapping the tip of a screwdriver against his bottom lip as he thinks, and then two strong arms wrap around his waist and just like that, the problem has identified itself.
“You—I. What? How? When? What is that?” The questions tumble out of him and Steve has to consciously loosen his grip on the table.
Steve’s skin prickles at the crisp chill of autumn. He watches the traffic, hears a door opening, closing.
“I love you too,” Steve whispers, his heart breaking as he says it. It shouldn’t hurt. It shouldn’t.
Captain America, Steve Rogers, bastions of truth, loyalty, and justice. It wasn’t an expectation that Captain America trusted inherently in the goodness of people and are nothing but open and kind—it was a fact. One Steve felt the burden of maintaining more heavily on some days.
“Actually. No. Now. What the fuck,” Tony says, suddenly whirling around. He moves as if to take a step forward then stops, taken aback when he sees the look on Steve’s face.
” Tony scoffs and pulls out his phone, tapping on the screen quickly. Steve takes this opportunity to take a quick survey of what’s in the kitchen—outside, the sun is beginning to set and he wants dinner now, not just snacks.
Steve is silent as the words settle. He wants to vomit, lash out, or cry, or all of the above at the same time, wants to ask Tony why, and also wants to go back to the moment before he ever said anything.
“Least I could do if I almost gave him a heart attack,” and the admission spills so easily out of his mouth that they stand in stunned silence for a moment.
On the screen, there’s a burst of blood and something pale jumping out of Kane’s chest; Thor yells, spilling popcorn over himself and Steve, and Tony lets out a big whoop of glee. Beside Steve, Natasha lets out a huff of breath: “Still gross,” she says to herself, as she slowly eases her vice-like grip on Steve’s arm. Clint, meanwhile, is completely unfazed and maintains his singular attention on the mayhem onscreen. Steve slumps back into the couch and smiles, and while his heart did race with surprise, now a sense of peace settles over him as he looks over the team.
“Where’d you come from?” Steve asks after having a drink. All other questions are moot, at this point; it’s Tony. Steve thinks that Tony probably has JARVIS monitor the team, alert him on big enough crises. He’s probably here because he saw the helicarriers explode, and came to check on Natasha, then dropped by to check in on Steve, since he was already in the area. It’s probably just a coincidence he was here when Steve woke up.
Tony’s standing over him, offering Steve his hand and wiping his brow with another; his chest is rising and falling heavily. Steve keeps looking at the ceiling, feels tears begin to pool around his eyes, and he can’t figure out
Under his hands, Steve is pliant, his eyes shine with desire when he looks up at Tony and it makes Tony feel a little wild, makes him grab onto Steve’s hips harder, makes him
Steve gets up, walks to his room, and puts on some sunblock. The house feels so big, and he’s never been on a beach trip with just another person, and it’s—it’s a lot, maybe. In the car, earlier, it was easy, talking to Tony and teasing him by playing his music instead of Tony’s “beach trip playlist.” But now, here, Steve realizes that it’s so real all of the sudden, like something could happen at any moment. Wasn’t it just last week that they hated each other, wasn’t it just yesterday that they’d finally spoken properly?
“Well. I was still all of those things to all of those people, back then. And then I thought I was going to die and there were only so many seconds I had left to make peace with that. But you know what was on my mind?”
Steve shakes his head. “You always go too hard.” Then the realization hits him: he knows for a fact that Tony only ever does this when they're together. It’s never been explicit, never discussed or planned ahead, but in the times they’ve spent with other people, Tony’s as in-control as usual.
The room that gets the least foot traffic is the library. Steve knows this from the fine layer of dust that coats one of the desks, but also because he’d asked JARVIS, point blank, which room in the tower he could go to where he could expect no visitors. JARVIS had said that other than his own apartment, Bruce would frequent the library most evenings, but it remained empty most of the day.
Frustration explodes inside Steve, and all at once he’s so mad at himself for being so awful with words. He wants to backtrack to how they were right before this happened. He’s so focused on thinking of how to fix this that he isn’t really thinking when he pulls Tony close, wanting nothing more than to take that look off Tony’s face.
“Why are you acting surprised, honestly,” Tony says, not looking at Steve as he tears open a foil flavor packet with his teeth and dunks its powdery contents into a steaming bowl.
“Doesn’t he have the secret service for this? Deep cover shit or whatever?” Tony continues, beginning to pace. “Come on Bazooka Joe, I’ve got better things to do.”
So he keeps his mouth shut. He doesn’t say thank you, doesn’t apologize. There’s no reason for either sentiment. They’re back where they started, and Steve is alive. Steve bites down on his tongue and doesn’t talk about how everything they’ve done has been worth nothing so far, about how he expected to have something other than smoke and mirrors. Stops himself from sneering:
The president’s wife was found a few miles away. Through her tears she told him that they’d taken Iron Man—the confession like a bomb dropping into his lap, and then he was on the ground with her.
“Well maybe they’d be right!” Steve snaps, at the end of his rope. He’s never been comfortable with things like this, romance and dating and—and
Steve stares, blinks, and continues to stare. Tony’s signature follows, a large scrawl on the page. What did Tony try to erase? Steve hates himself for not staying and just hearing Tony out, back in the library. Thinks that maybe he would have heard a much less edited version of the words on the page.
“Been looking forward to this,” Steve says. He bites his lip for good measure, looking like he’s been waiting to touch Tony, and the look in his eyes is so sincere that Tony, against all rational thought, hopes he actually means it.
“I—” He’s wanted this for so long, but he’s never learned the words for desire. “I’m afraid I’ll say something wrong,” Steve whispers.
Tony has colored considerably, and looks a little disgruntled. Pepper tries to be as subtle as possible when she elbows him, waiting for an introduction.
“Tony,” Steve starts, and Tony lifts his eyes up so they meet Steve’s. “I want you to know that for the longest time, I thought that finding Bucky would fix everything—myself included.” Steve pauses, and Tony nods at him, chewing his lip.
Steve slumps back onto the couch beside Thor, and Natasha reaches over to give Steve’s hand a squeeze. “That was fun, right?” she says, smiling at Steve. Steve gives her a small smile and nods, then goes back to reading reports, 60s music continuing to play.
“We have to look like we’re having a meaningful conversation,” Steve says, glancing around. By the door, Janet is watching them, evaluating.
“Fine,” Steve says, shrugging off Tony’s hand and standing up. “I’m fine. Just a bit winded,” he adds. “Anyway. I think I’m done for the day.” He keeps his face away from Tony’s line of sight, and takes big strides towards the door.
want?” he asks. He’s afraid for the answer, and honestly doesn’t know what he wants to hear, anyway.
Pepper chokes on her iced coffee when a tall, blond, beautiful man strides up to Tony and envelopes him in a hug.
“I—what?” Steve says, shaking away Tony’s hand and fighting down a blush. This is stupid. He should talk to Fury.
Steve can’t help but think of Peggy, of the dance they’d agreed on, and the way she’d smiled at him when he’d visit her. Even then, she’d told him that he deserved to find the right dance partner.
He breathes out slowly, trying not to wake Tony. It feels nice, the warmth of him, the solid weight like a blanket. He considers lifting Tony’s arm away, tucking him back into a position that’s less embarrassing, but at that moment, Tony huffs out a breath, buries his face deeper against Steve’s shoulder, and Steve blushes.
“That’s what they called Barnes,” Bruce supplies. Everyone knows this already, but he seems to say it more to himself.
Tony, meanwhile, snakes a hand around Steve’s waist, warm against his lower back. His hand, still on Steve’s jaw, tilts Steve’s head to part his mouth open.
Steve wakes up to an empty bed, but it’s still warm, so it wasn’t empty for too long. Steve opens his eyes to confirm, and they land immediately upon a familiar shock of dark hair far enough from him that Steve is treated to the sight of Tony’s muscular back, Steve’s blanket draped over his hips artfully.
Tony bites down on his lip, which feels dangerously close to wobbling. “Rhodey, you are honestly my favorite person in the whole world.”
Steve hasn’t felt this ill since the 40s, and hasn’t been drunk since then, either. He digs around the refrigerator for the drink Natasha had brought home for them from her trip to Tokyo. She’d told them enthusiastically that it was great for rehydration… Steve finally finds the plastic bottle filled with misty-white liquid. It sounds gross:
“Okay,” Tony says noncommittally. He continues to push tools around on the desk, and doesn’t look at Steve.
They’re quiet, and Steve cautiously regards the way Tony hasn’t moved his hand away from under Steve’s.
“Now, hold on a second,” Steve says, a small frown beginning to form on his face. Barely perceptible, if you didn’t know the signs. “I already explained why—”
“I shouldn’t have to tell you this,” Tony says, and his shoulders, initially squared for a fight, sag. “But you don’t have to ask.”
“No, I’m fine,” Steve answers, words backed up by the stubborn belief that if he says it enough, it’ll eventually be true.
“I worked with Steve almost a year ago,” Tony says, smiling to the camera. Steve hasn't arrived yet, but Tony feels a thrum of excitement building in him, zinging around and making his body feel alight. He remembers it all still, clear as the video, he’s all but memorized and branded to memory. Steve’s skin, the strong muscles of his arms under Tony’s hands, coupled with how soft his lips felt, pressed against his.
“Easier if you just carry me,” Tony murmurs, somehow still finding it in himself to joke at a time like this. It makes Steve want to grab him by the shoulders and give him a good shake. “Give everyone something to talk about.”
Steve nods, doesn’t refute her words. Doesn’t say that trusting anyone hasn’t gotten him very far, these days.
“To what?” Thor asks, still laughing, but getting up anyway. Tony seems to have noticed this movement, and is now suddenly standing right beside Steve.
Steve squawks in protest and tackles Tony onto the bed, pinning Tony down with his hips as he kisses Tony all over while tickling him.
Tony huffs, then walks onto the set. Nick is already in his seat, going through the boards. “Play nice with this one,” he says, and he doesn’t lift his head as he says it.
In the elevator, Tony reaches out and holds Steve’s hand. There’s a part of Steve that’s still afraid that he’ll say something and all of this will go away, so he smiles at Tony tentatively, and notices a slight dusting of pink on Tony’s cheeks.
“I mean,” Steve continues, as if Tony hasn’t said anything, because it’s easier to pretend he’s talking to a cardboard cut-out of Tony (the first of which he’d seen on a window display of a toy store, alongside the rest of the team. Steve had taken a photo and sent it to the group with the message “If the rest of the 21st century is like this then maybe we shouldn’t have stopped Loki.”). Steve shakes his head to clear it of these meanderings, focuses instead on imagining that none of this is real, because it makes it easier. “What I’m saying is, I think I’m in love with you,” Steve finishes lamely.
Truth be told, I didn’t know why I held back, either; it’s not as if Steve hasn’t already telegraphed his desire. But there was never anything overt, just the lingering look Steve would give me when our eyes met across a table, across a battlefield, across worlds, coupled with everything else.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Yeah,” he says, pulling Tony close to press their foreheads together. “Yeah,” he says again, and kisses him.
“Excuse me?” Tony says, and Steve is standing inside the elevator and Tony is standing right outside it, and the doors begin to inch out to close—Steve slams a hand out to jam the door open, and Tony takes a step back. “Steve—”
Steve tilts his head at Tony, waiting for him to speak. Instead, Tony shakes his head and laugh softly.
“After two corners,” the man resumes, “you turn left, and then you will see—” another pause. “Many people,” he finishes with a grin.
What settles in his mind, now that he’s fully awake, is the memory of Bucky looming over him, wailing down punches. This is the first time since he’d seen Bucky on the highway that Steve has had time to breathe and really think about the newest reality in his life: Bucky is alive.
A small, slow, shy smile blooms on Tony’s lips. “Good thing I’d like you to keep kissing me,” he says softly.
The gravity on Titan is different than Earth’s but Thor is used to changes like this. He’s been to many different planets. He acclimates just fine. He keeps his back straight and head high as he walks up to Thanos. The Titan doesn’t even bother standing, seeming perfectly relaxed. It pisses Thor off to no end. To be treated like he’s not even a threat. But relaxation and confidence like that comes with victory.
“Sir, you haven’t eaten in thirteen hours, you’ve also stressed your body physically in ways you haven’t in months, I suggest you eat and rest.”
“Okay, I’m just going to move some things around.” Tony says, using the pen light to move a few pieces and that’s when he spots it. “Ahh, someone’s not where they are supposed to be.” He whispers.
“Shh, Tony, it’s all going to be okay, I’ve got you.” Killian's voice floods his ears. Everything changes. No longer outside with the car crash, but not where he expected to be either. Instead, it’s his apartment, back pressed into the wall, and Killian's hand is
“I did. Just not how.” You look out the window. Its night out, and raining. But you focus on the lights of the city, the sounds of cars honking and people yelling.
He falls back onto the floor, knocking a few things on his desk over. Oil spills over the circuit board and the desk creating a huge mess. He sighs looking at it spread. Then a second knock comes and he flinches again.
A wave of anxiety washed over him at the prospect. The meeting seemed to go well. Demolished counter top aside, Tony reacted so well to it. But what if he was just never planning to see them again?
Going at your own speed, Steve’s already bent down, searching the crashed area and aircraft for signs of life. The street and houses around are in complete destruction. Luckily the aircraft looks alright. For such a crash landing.
He’d pinched the side of his leg as best he could without drawing attention and the pain did nothing to waver his hardness. His mind kept circling back to Tony, how warm his skin was, the smell of his hair. Just the thought of his body in Bucky’s arms.
He sighs, shaking his head, letting the wrist rest gently on his leg, as he takes stock of himself. A headache, he’s thirsty, feels weak and tired, yet too awake to fall asleep. All normal feelings after he’s had a bad dream. It feels a little worse than usual. But that's his own fault as well as everything else that seems to be happening today.
“He’s kind of fidgety. I can see why he might have ran when you met him. He got this really big panic look when I got close to him.” Steve continues. Bucky stands silently a moment, before looking down to the ground. He’s thinking ahead, trying to see where Steve is leading him in this conversation and from the sound of it, it’s not good.
“Wake up!” There’s a sob and some heavy sniffling. “Wake up!” It’s a boy, probably young from the sound of his voice.
“You can come in.” They both smile and step in awkwardly, closing the door behind them. Feeling out of place, and to Tony they are. This is his space. No other person has been here since the remodeling. It’s just him, Dum-E and Jarvis. But it’s fine. Jarvis has security protocols and if anything goes wrong he’ll be fine.
When he stills the man in front of him, he pulls his flesh palm up and gasps. The black soul mark that once covered his hand is now a deep blood red. Surprise taking over, freezing him in place.
“Yeah.” She sighs, sitting down at her desk. “He calls at least once a week asking for updates on you. Except I can never give him information because I don’t know anything.”
“I guess that’s true.” Tony sighs, stopping a moment and leaning against the building next to them, clutching the bandages over his stitches. They ache like hell, but he’s happy they haven’t reopened yet. “Maybe you should go ahead. Come back when you’ve got Y/n.”
Their shirts were either too tight, or too lose. Having his arms out felt wrong, but having sleeves felt wrong as well. Wearing blue felt too on the nose with his soulmark, but not wearing blue just felt weird, because suddenly it occurred to Steve seventy-percent of his wardrobe was blue!
“I’m not actually sure.” Steve presses his hands to the wound. “But I don’t think we have time to find out.” Steve carefully, picks up Tony, doing his best not to jostle his weight.
“Not the black ones.” He makes a face as the sauce gets under his nail. “I usually remember to make sure they don’t put them on, but I was kind of panicking, as I’m sure you can tell.”
“My heart it’s beating fast, and I feel like every inch of me is vibrating. But I’m not actually scared, or worried. It’s like being scared because someone near you is clearly scared.”
“I’m not sure.” Wong shrugs. Bruce pulls on his glasses and bends down next to you, checking for a pulse.
Tony hasn’t had alcohol since he came to this apartment. Drinking alone is just sad, and he was sad enough as is. But when one ponders the sheer shittiness they must deal with on a daily basis because they themselves are just- shitty, he can make exceptions. He can’t even stomach a kiss.
While he cooks Jarvis alert him to a text he’d received from Steve while he was asleep, and he tells Jarvis to read it aloud. He can’t help but smile at how it starts.
The doctors had to amputate it. But because of his age and circumstances, he qualified for a new prototype prosthetic a Stark Industries company had just developed.
Tony silently wishes Pepper were here she has a great at always knowing what you need for any occasion. This is something he really wants her help with. But he can't call her.  Once she knows there will be no stopping her from trying to find him. She'll tell Rhody and then from there it'll spread. If Killian finds out…. He’ll be pissed.
“Not since college.” Tony shook his head. Stephen reached over and made a few notes before moving to take his pulse. Then his blood pressure, then his eye coordination and pupils. Then ears, inside his mouth, and along his neck.
“I hope you have standards higher than fine when it comes to my body and large open wounds,” Tony says from the stairwell. You both stand, Steve moves quickly, helping him down the rest of the steps and to a seat.
He turns to the man, about to think him, for his quick thinking, but he stops short when he finds the man looking down at his palms incredulously.
“That’s when I picked him up.” Valkyrie steps in. “I was looking for survivors when I saw him drifting. Somehow, he hadn’t frozen. I wonder if that’s an Asgardian thing or a Frost Giant thing. Either way, it took a while to heal him up, and by the time we did and managed to get to Earth, people were crumbling to dust.”
“Atta girl.” The man nods. He looks to Tony, and his eyes widen slightly, it’s the only look of surprise he gives. “This is my secret patient?”
It’s not that the movie is truly terrifying. Still, he finds himself questioning if the succulent in the corner of the room is really a plant or a monster watching him. He finds himself too scared to look directly at it, and too scared to look away. It doesn’t help when the screen flashes bright and dark, making the figure look as if it’s breathing. He clutches Steve’s arm, as he looks at it over the mans shoulder, breathing heavily into the tight space between Steve and the couch, causing his face to sweat as he feels he’s in a furnace.
The cost being this is the first time he’s been on American soil in two years. The cost being he hasn’t truly had a home or a real place to settle down because he was a fugitive. The cost being Tony Stark sitting right in front of his face saying they can’t be friends, when not two years ago Steve was thinking of it maybe being more.
“Oh, it’s my workstation. It’s where my ideas come to fruition or die.” More fruition than dying. Dying isn’t even really dying either. They just go to a pile on the floor until he remembers it later after he’s binged on another project and finally has space in his mind for it. He’s currently trying to put ideas together for a Stark smart car. He’s not sure he liked the design yet, or if it’s going to run as quietly as he invasions it. He’ll need a working model first to test out- but he’s getting off track in his mind, this isn’t the time to start working again.
Tony knows the guy is just doing his job. But he wishes the guy would do it somewhere else and not in the direct vicinity. About ten more lifts, and Tony was sure the shaking in his arms meant they were done for the day whether he wanted them to or not. Almost relieved his body chose him, Tony stood ready to go right back to the apartment and avoid leaving for another two weeks. His balance faltered, which happened a lot lately, especially when he hadn’t eaten in a while. Only this time, there wasn’t a couch or desk chair to catch him. Only weights and hardwood floors. He was damn lucky the guy was cleaning the bench nearby and had reflexes faster than one would think humanly possible. He catches Tony just barely by the waist with a strong grip, stopping him from falling completely.
Tony finds himself speechless. He doesn’t talk about his accident, not with Pepper, not Rhody. Only Killian ever since he was done with surgeries and recovery. His eyes focus on a poster to the right, a number for domestic abuse helpline. It’s not true that he hasn’t talked about it, not completely. He told Bucky. Not everything, but he didn’t hesitate to mention his scars. Maybe it was nothing and he’s making it more than what it is, but it gives him pause, to think about how he’s managed to all at once be scared and wholly trusting with them.
“Dr. Strange? Where is he?” Steve looks around. He’s heard about Strange during his time away. He doesn’t associate with Shield or call himself an Avenger, but he’s still a help to the world. Shield has kept tabs on him ever since an event in Hong Kong.
She was spread thin by billions of atoms creating this for them, for herself. So, when it came to the body she clung to, they couldn’t see it. They couldn’t hear the words she spoke. All she could do was silently help Stephen reach your mind, and speak to you, and when the moment was right, she asked you a very important question.
“I do believe you own a gym membership, there is one, two blocks from here. Open twenty-four hours. I believe you’ll be safe there. No one is looking for Tony Stark at his hour.”
In most ways, Tony looks like he hasn’t changed. But in other ways, he looks completely different. This was Tony Stark, the same man he knew two years ago, the same man he was on a team with. Two years later and Tony sounds and looks exactly as Steve remembers.
Stephen peeked his head in, Tony hadn't woken at the sound. His steps light as he entered the room, whispering his words as he spoke to Steve.
He looks down at his phone, it lays open on the floor in front of him, keyboard up and indicator blinking as if telling him to just say something. Already knowing what he’s going to say is the problem itself. He’ll say no, and Steve will take it as outright rejection, when Tony just doesn’t want to go in public, and he doesn’t want to tell them why, so he can’t just
“Because it’ll look better when we go down for breakfast and I’m wearing something of yours,” Tony says, and Steve wants to argue because he’s only packed enough clothes for the trip, but he knows too that Tony’s right.
Steve looks at Tony, eyes shut and boneless, and feels a surge of courage as he bends down to press a kiss on Tony’s forehead.
“Yeah?” Bruce looks up just in time to see Steve scratch the back of his neck, looking vaguely embarrassed and a bit flushed. “I’d like that. If you’re not too busy.”
Steve feels a little pathetic, daydreaming about the Anonymous Man as he settles down in a cafe across the historical landmark he set out to see. He can’t help but dream up scenarios in which the man comes to have a cup of coffee, and then they share a look of recognition, and Steve asks him to sit, and they chat and—well.
Tony looks up at Steve. He hadn’t even realized he’d looked away. Steve takes a deep breath, closes the space between them, and takes Tony’s hands in his.
“Really? Not even a ‘sorry’ for making me save your dumb ass?” Tony’s eyebrows are knitted together. “Thanks for staunching the blood, sorry I bled all over the quinjet and almost caused you a heart attack, sorry I almost died, Tony,” Tony adds mockingly. “Any of those will do.”
“No, I,” Steve shuts his notebook with an air of finality. Maybe later, he’ll try harder at writing out how he feels, and why. But for now: “I was heading out anyway. What’s up?”
“Tony,” Steve whispers, tilts Tony’s head up, forcing Tony to meet his eyes. “I want you. Just you.”
He was hoping that saying words would somehow jumpstart his thought process to find a way to talk himself down, but it doesn’t help. Now he feels even more frazzled.
“The new suit you made,” Steve says, patting his side as if to make his point, “it fits like a glove. I have a much better range of motion.”
I wondered if this would just be another moment to add to the list of things we’d done, things that weren’t strictly platonic anymore, but not overt enough to mean anything. We’d gotten so good at pretending none of this mattered.
The feeling takes him by surprise, because for a brief moment just then, he’d forgotten that all of this was for show. Now, in front of a reporter, he’s reminded to keep up the act, when over the past few weeks, he hadn’t pretended. Not really. Anxiety settles in his stomach, uncomfortable and worrisome.
Bruce stands from the couch, as well. “Steve,” he says, “we can talk, if you want.” It’s a last-ditch effort, Steve can tell.
They stare at each other for a moment. Then Tony laughs, and Steve laughs, a mix of confusion and hysteria. Tony leans forward and buries his face against Steve’s chest, and they’re both shaking with it, Steve laughing because Tony is.
“Whose side are you on, anyway!” Tony whirls around and points at Pepper as he speaks. “And you!” He turns to look at Rhodey.
Tony’s eyes track Steve’s movement, then are drawn to the pile of papers. “If you’re busy I can just—” he says, hand still on Steve’s doorknob.
, Steve tells himself. Steve bared his soul to Tony and Tony hadn’t run away at that, so there is still some form of their friendship that Steve could return to.
Tony inhales deeply, as if readying himself. In his chest is a mess of exposed wires—copper bands and metal—and in the middle, a familiar blue glow. Tony fumbles for a moment, fingers pressing against the circumference of the reactor, then turns. He hisses when the reactor
So, now, a hand around his back, valiantly trying to make its way across his shoulders. He has broad shoulders. Tony said so. Steve knows so. Not just because Tony said, but Tony said so too, so, it’s doubly true, possibly. Anyway. Just a few minutes. He’s so tired. He’s been so, so tired. He’ll rest for a few minutes, and then he’ll get up.
“Not bad!” Clint says, back on the sofa, his legs sprawled on top of Natasha’s. “I knew you had it in you.”
Janet lays some ground rules, and they spend three minutes holding each other’s hands and gazing in each other’s eyes.
Tony’s in the make-up chair, being fussed over by Jan, when Steve arrives. Tony doesn’t bother hiding how he stares at Steve, who is beautiful and somehow, still looking a bit shy.
, he reminds himself) ago. Who Steve had believed to be dead. But he was never dead, and Steve had abandoned him, and maybe Steve did deserve to be punched to unconsciousness. But he also deserved to talk to Bucky, at the very least. He
Just across the street, he sees a vague outline of a man holding up a rifle. With his free hand, he waves and throws up a peace sign.
“I’ve loved you since—since Ella Fitzgerald on the balcony. You remember? After you vomited on my shoes,” Tony says, offering Steve the smallest of smiles.
“Are you okay?” It’s a stupid question. They both know this. Steve remains silent, continuing to stare at his hands. Earlier they were pink from how hard Steve had scrubbed, to get all of the blood off. Now they’re just that: his hands.
Maybe they could just try and be friends. Like Rhodey said, it’s been five years. Besides, he’s probably married already anyway, or at least dating someone; it’s unfathomable that no one would snap him up.
Steve picks up the tablet again and heads to the communal floor, hoping to catch Tony as soon as he arrives. He sits on one of the plush white leather couches and looks through the news about the information Natasha had dumped. Seems like a good a starting point as any.
They were good together. Great, even, now that Tony has had a fair share of relationships to be able to compare. Still, the years he spent with Steve were some of the happiest in his life, but the way they ended only served as proof that maybe the best things weren’t meant to last.
Steve sighs, sets his gun down by the small table just by the door where normal people would leave their keys. He walks towards Stark and sits down on the seat adjacent to him. If he wanted to, he could move his knee a little so it would brush against Stark’s, but he won’t.
“And then what? You haul me off to Stane?” Stark barks out a laugh. “It’d be a pity, but I’d kill you first.”
I swallowed down a hysterical laugh and flexed my hands in his grip. “Well, Steve,” I said, smiling a little and trying to sound more confident than I felt, “I think we’ve already crossed it.”
A pint of beer is placed in front of him and Steve looks up at the waiter, intent on saying thank you, and startles when he sees the man from earlier.
Steve cooks in silence, and eventually, Tony deposits his two empty mugs into the sink and moves to stand beside Steve, bumping their hips together. Steve transfers the cooked eggs into a plate, and the toaster dings. Tony takes an empty plate and busies himself with stacking the toast.
“You can tell me anything, you know,” Steve says gently. So gentle, it almost breaks him; Tony doesn’t deserve this. Steve doesn’t deserve this.
I didn’t want to break first, except over the past 48 hours I felt like a dog trying to catch its tail:
Cold. Wet. Steve opens his eyes long enough for his vision to clear and in front of him: Tony, holding an empty glass.
Thor is sure that both he and Steve notice that Tony stands a little straighter, despite his sputtering.
Bruce digs through the box, then dumps its contents onto Tony’s workbench and Steve curls his finger around it, grips it so tightly he can feel the casing begin to give.
Steve levels Tony with a look, but doesn’t say anything else. He breathes out slowly through his nose and flips through it. It starts with how often they should be seen together in public, then the slow escalation of closeness they should display.
Steve wakes up and keeps his eyes closed as he takes in his surroundings. Steve’s used to hospital rooms and clinics at this point, and can tell from the way the air conditioning hum is low, the beeps from the monitoring machines a different pitch (because Tony insists on tinkering with everything) that he’s most likely in the clinic in the tower.
“I should—something of yours?” Steve tries, feeling out of his depth. He digs into his bag and tosses a shirt at Tony, who slips it on. It’s a bit big on his shoulders, and it takes Steve’s breath away. Stupid, how something so simple could elicit such a reaction, but that’s been the case since they first started this whole charade. It awakens something in Steve, something primal and possessive that makes him want to pull Tony close, kiss him, cover Tony’s body with his—
Maybe it’s that, the light, that makes Steve see the question in Tony’s eyes: he wants to ask if Steve is okay, after the sparring earlier, but he won’t. Steve probably wouldn’t answer if he asked, anyway.
But he didn’t, and now he’s in the tower living room, being asked to dance. The voice over the speakers continues its invocations:
have anything else to wear, and he felt a little unhinged by virtue of his outfit: Steve’s hoodie and a pair of very old jorts, fraying at the hem.
Steve moves toward Tony, then leans his hips against the bench opposite him. “Yeah. Changing history, right? Why?” Steve feels off-balance, surprised by the change in the conversation, and unsure if he’s happier for it.
“I meant about after all this,” Steve says, unable to keep how annoyed he feels from his tone. He can’t handle Tony being glib at a time like this, when he’s about to pour his heart out.
“I feel like we should have a stake in this pool,” Tony says, then turns to Steve. “What do you think?”
Tony smiles, soft and shy and so unlike how Steve knew him, before all this. “Happy anniversary,” he says, bending down a little to kiss the tip of Steve’s nose.
Steve waves Tony away, walking briskly back to the elevator. He realizes, once inside, that he’s still holding his empty glass.
The scene has them both in their underwear, pressing against each other, hands roaming up and down each other’s sides, breathy moans and whispered pleas. It’s a standard scene, one Tony’s done too many times to count.
Still, Tony’s hand in his is warm, solid, and a reminder that despite everything, at least he has his small, physical comfort.
Steve reaches out and pulls Tony back down to sit. He isn’t thinking at all when he whispers, “Me too.”
“I love this part,” Natasha says, as the juror onscreen finishes his tirade and all the other men turn away from him.
Steve sighs, and tamps down hard on the nerves that had spooled together in his stomach the night before:
Steve’s desperately trying to get his thoughts in order, trying to figure out how to confess everything in a way that makes sense. Or at least in a way that will make Tony consider, in the same way Steve did when he first saw pictures of them together, that they’d be good together.
He doesn’t need to conjure up anything to make himself flush; the script does the trick well enough, mostly because it’s true. He
“Before everything, all that mattered to me was what I thought of myself. At least that way, it was all up to me, whether or not I’d be happy or disappointed. But now, now there’s just the fact of everything. People have this idealized version of me in their heads and I can’t—
Tony furrows his brows at Steve. “Thankfully we’ve been given half an hour just to do that,” he says, a crooked smile on his lips.
Steve reaches out instinctively to see the damage—no matter how many years of training he has, no matter how much bad he knows Stark has done, it’s still second nature for him to help, rather than hurt.
Tony frowns, furrowing his eyebrow at Steve, and Steve winks at him just as the rest of the team arrives.
It takes a few minutes until Steve feels some semblance of normal, and he sinks down to the floor, cradles his head in his hands.
Tony pulls out a beach towel from his bag and lays it out before plopping down on it and cracking open the cooler.
Tony nods gravely. “That’s a fuck ton to process, Cap,” he says. “So, I guess you want my help finding Barnes?”
“No. Don’t lie,” Tony says, and the implication, while totally true in this moment, causes rage bubble up from Steve’s stomach and turns into acid.
Steve cracks open another egg, and casts a glance to the kitchen door, checking to see if there’s anyone in the living room outside. He takes a breath to steady himself. Tony is standing beside him again, watching Steve cook with some interest. Everything about this is familiar; he’s cooked for Tony before. But this feels different, like they’re teetering on the edge of something new.
“Tony, that’s, that’s terrible.” Steve can’t even begin to wrap his head around how Tony feels, what Tony’s thinking. Shame burns hot in his body; he didn’t even realize that Tony was grappling with these thoughts, and he hadn’t told Steve—“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
“God answered my prayers!” Tony says, jumping to life and taking the cup. He takes a sip, then turns to Steve, surprised.
He is on vacation, after all. And it’s not like anyone here knows him. It’s a liberating thought, but Steve knows, too, that that’s all it will be.
The phone pings again, this time with a link to a playlist Sam has thrown together. It starts with “Trouble Man,” and Steve smiles to himself, remembering the first time they’d met. He places his phone on the desk, and plays the rest of the music.
Steve didn’t want to quantify to what degree that was true, but there it was), things Steve wants to cradle with his whole body rather than use his fists to beat into submission, that Steve turns situations over and over in his mind, looking for the path to the best outcome.
Tony flicks the roach into the air, watching as it floats down into the empty alley in the back of Steve’s building.
Steve sighs and massages his temples before walking to the fridge and pulling out a bottle of water. “Do you rest? Ever?” He asks, after taking a drink.
He looks up when the door swings open. Tony laughs at him again, and then, inexplicably, he tackles Steve onto the bed. All the air in Steve’s lungs
Tony huffs out a laugh, his breath warm against Steve’s skin. “I know, I know.” Tony shifts a bit, presses a soft kiss against Steve’s neck. They hug in silence for what feels like forever, and Steve relishes every second of it.
“Really good, right?” Tony turns to Steve and grins. Steve nods, still reeling with how well done the movie was. “You know, that was Howard’s favorite,” Tony says.
Natasha raises her eyebrow at him and smirks as she pointedly looks at his hand on Tony’s lower back. Steve frowns, and drops his hand to his side. Natasha rolls her eyes, then turns back to the cockpit.
, really. But finding Bucky shouldn’t be about fixing, in the first place.” Steve exhales. “I just wanted you to know that.”
Steve turns off the lights and lies down beside Tony, whose face is half-illuminated by his bedside table lamp. Steve looks at him, and all the feelings from earlier come rushing back as he notices the way the shirt collar is too loose on him, how his waves are looser now that they’re not slicked up with product.
Steve doubles over as he tries to catch his breath. He feels tears sliding down his face and focuses on what Bucky had taught him, all those years ago: breathe in through his nose, exhale through his mouth. Nonsense words are tumbling from his lips, all part and parcel of the entire exercise.
Rhodey sighs, settles in, and wonders what on earth Steve could have done all those years ago that Tony’s still affected.
“Yeah I have a few more lines of code left to do for the website, and then I can send it off to beta testing. Then I can start revisions on the system for elections, and, well. You know. How are you, though? How was your day?”
Steve remembers his apartment, that brick he’d hide his spare key under, the way Bucky knew everything, absolutely everything. When Steve finds him, he thinks, it will play out like that: lifting a brick, finding a hidden key, unlocking everything. Bucky will have a whole life to sift through, behind those doors they’d hidden in him, and Steve will be there for all of it. They’ll start with all the files Natasha had leaked, and it’ll work out, eventually—it always did, as long as it was the two of them.
Tony sags against him, letting out a deep breath. They fall into silence, again, and the next thing Steve knows he jolts awake because his head was falling forward.
The next few days are filled with small acts of penitence: a cup of coffee on the bedside table when Tony wakes, a sandwich in the workshop, a completed report for a day-old mishap. It’s on Thursday that Tony’s heart finally softens. Over nothing, really, just a small doodle on his desk. He realizes, in that moment, that of all his achievements, perhaps learning to understand Steve Rogers should rank highest. Right up there with being understood by him, too.
“No!” Steve says, whipping his head up to stare accusingly at the ceiling. (he stopped feeling silly about talking to the walls a long time ago). “Just be, you know. Casual about it.”
“You’re unbelievable,” Tony finally says. He raises his hands and plants them squarely on either side of Steve’s face, tilting his head gently so now they’re nose-to-nose. “Are you sure about this?”
“What—“ Steve starts, then looks down at the paper. “Is this a list,” he says hesitantly. It’s not really a question, but an opening for Tony to explain himself.
“I guess you’d know what that’s like, too. Anyway, all these people, everyone, they always say things, and they say it so often it’s hard not to believe them, to take on the burden of existence and to internalize the hope you’ve given them and then hold yourself to it.” Steve doesn’t look at Tony as he talks, can’t bear to.
“Don’t,” he says, threatening. He pushes the knife closer, just hard enough that Steve feels the first pinprick of pain.
“Yes, this has been established.” Tony’s face is scrunched into a confused smile. Steve mirrors this, knows that neither of them are really sure why the conversation has taken this turn.
“Yeah,” Steve says. He looks up to see if Tony’s looking at him, and he’s surprised by the emotion in Tony’s gaze. “Of course I worried,” he murmurs.
“More than all the other times you’ve said that?” Steve teased, lying down beside him but propping himself up on his elbow so he could look at Tony.
Tony has his back to Steve, the soldering iron buzzing in his hand. “Huh?” Tony asks, and turns off the tool.
To stop meant to give credence to the emptiness that he’s felt for a while, now. Steve thinks back on what he’d told Tony, and he keeps going back to these thoughts, these memories of Bucky. They cloud out most everything else. Steve thinks of that afternoon in the helicarrier, of how Bucky’s voice had changed, how his fist felt against Steve’s face, and the calm that had settled over him when he accepted that maybe, he was finally going to die.
It’s the third safe house he’s breaking into in a week, so when Steve kicks down the door, he nearly falters with surprise to find the place actually occupied.
“UGH,” Clint says again, then throws a pillow at them. “You’re going to bleed me dry with shit like that.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says, sitting down beside him. He meets Tony’s gaze in the mirror and offers up a small, nervous smile. “How have you been?”
Steve pauses, swallows hard, alarm bells ringing around his disjointed thoughts. “I mean, I’d die for anyone,” he says, words rushing out of him.
“How long are you in town for?” Pepper asks, smiling at Steve despite Tony very obviously stepping on her shoe.
“Tony!” He says, grinning brightly. He sets the donuts down. “Glad I caught you before your next meeting.”
The interview is held in the balcony adjacent to the helipad, and Steve and the reporter sit down just as Tony arrives with his usual panache, the automated arms of the landing port disassembling the suit as Tony walks towards them. Steve doesn’t hold back on the fond eye roll, and bites back a smile when he sees the reporter take note of his reaction.
This, at least, brings a small smile to Steve’s lips. “However,” Tony starts again, “I am told, that just talking helps. Is this helping?”
Steve stops in his tracks when he sees him, doesn’t even think when he shouts across the set: “Tony!”
Peter let out another sob as Tony walked closer. Tony chuckled darkly and wiped his tears away with the pads of his thumbs. "Almost twenty Pete. You should be used to punishments." He growled by his ear and slipped the cock cage on he brought. Peter let out another sob. "M-Mr. Stark! No! Please!" He whined.
Peter gagged around it and choked. It was hard to get air in. He slid his leg under him and began to rub his ass on his heel. As much as he loved sucking thick, hard, alpha cock, he couldn't cum from just it.
The omega shook his head. Once he caught his breath he looked up at his handsome alpha. "But….but…."
“Oh,” Tony says. He blushes a little, and Clint briefly considers stabbing himself with his spoon. “Thanks.”
It took a while for Steve to really accept that was Bucky (not is). But for Steve to remain willfully ignorant of the things Bucky had done while being brainwashed was idiotic, so he stopped wringing his hands about it and decided to focus his energy on finding Bucky, instead. He tells himself that he’ll read all of the SHIELD/HYDRA files JARVIS has tagged as Winter Soldier related once they finally find him—if it wasn’t all in the file Natasha had given him, already.
Steve feels the first tendrils of panic begin to snake their way up his legs, his arms. He takes a deep breath in an attempt to steady himself. It doesn’t help.
“Come on, wake up,” he says, running a hand through Tony’s hair just for the sheer pleasure of doing it.
Steve closes his eyes and hums along as he takes another swig from the flask. “Never had the time to catch it when it was on Broadway,” he says, smiling.
,” Tony says, anger once again coloring his words. “God, it’s like you don’t know who you’re talking to. Hasn’t anyone told you? Don’t bullshit the bullshitter.”
Tony moves his hands away from Steve’s hips, and positions Steve’s arms away from his body, bending them at the elbow. Tony smiles, nods, and begins to dance.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice is tentative, and it’s been a long time since Steve has felt this scared, butterflies fluttering all over the caverns of his body.
Tony lets out a mirthless laugh; Steve starts at the sound, at the accusation. He’s not Captain America, not now. Captain America didn’t do things like this. Steve Rogers—maybe he could. Last night, as he drank, and drank, and drank, he had thought, pathetically to himself, that maybe Steve Rogers was allowed to be this. To do things like this. Was allowed to make mistakes and be sad and not deal with his problems. But those were the thoughts of a drunk man. And so, Steve discards them.
The man huffs out a laugh, a look of surprise and relief on his face. “It’s you,” he says, and Steve feels his heart soar.
Tony looks up at Steve and smiles, and Steve can’t help but smile back, something warm unfurling inside him.
I breathed in through my nose, my own eyes shut against Steve’s chest. We’re so close that I can feel the heat of his breath against the collar of my shirt.
, which throws a wrench in this whole debacle, and deep in the recesses of Tony’s brain, rationality begins to take root. “He’s my best friend. You’re the love of my life.”
Steve is entranced, and is vaguely aware of the arrival of the rest of the team. Clint stops beside Tony and watches for a few moments before saying, “Ugh, boring.” Natasha perches on the armrest beside Steve, and then eventually slides down onto the couch, forcing Steve and Tony to adjust. Steve is momentarily distracted by how close he and Tony are seated, pressed against each other hip to knee.
Steve smirks at Tony. “Thanks for the tip,” he says as he pockets Tony’s phone and runs to Tony’s room. Tony realizes what he’s done a second too late, and he fumbles around the furniture as he tries to beat Steve to his room.
He stands up with a jolt, pencils and notebooks clattering on the floor. Steve’s movements are jerky, imprecise—all he’s thinking is,
“No, it’s fine, I really need to finish this thing,” Tony says, waving his hand around and gesturing vaguely to his laptop.
Steve wakes up from a dreamless sleep and feels completely exhausted. For the past two days, Steve did his best to coerce himself out of bed, move, get some endorphins in his system—create happiness out of sheer force of will.
Everyone’s trying, all the time, and it hasn’t been enough, so what will make the difference? Nothing. Steve doesn’t say these words out loud, but an awful, bitter part of him wants to.
It’s been months of their cat and mouse game, so when Steve walks into another anonymous, rundown safe house, he’s not surprised to find Stark sitting on a chair by the dining table, a glass of wine half-full in front of him.
“All good, buddy. I’m just glad you didn’t pass out on me, or else we’d have really been in trouble,” he says, and gives Steve’s bicep two quick pats.
“Steve,” Tony has let go of his wrist and stands to rest his hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve feels his breath getting shorter and shorter.
It’s probably something ingrained in him from the army, the way he sleeps in only one position, so it’s nothing new to blink away sleep from his eyes and have the ceiling as his first sight of the morning.
Steve stands and moves to a central panel in the quinjet. He pulls up a schematic of the base and says, “Okay. Here’s the plan.”
“Chin up, buttercup,” Tony says, sliding his hand under Steve’s chin and tipping his head up so Tony can smile at him. “We can practice, if you want.”
Steve doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t know what to say, what to do, how he can come out of this as the right one.
“Everyone ready?” Janet asks, standing beside him and Tony. “I’m going to ring this bell when three minutes are up. I’d like to ask you to keep conversation to a minimum during this time.”
The realization dawns on Tony just as quickly; his laugh stops midway and he peers closer at Steve. “You’re kidding, right? I thought earlier—” Tony drags a hand across his face, clearly frustrated. “Steve,” he says, looking at Steve again.
“You said last night that you wanted to stop running away. And now, it’s the first thing you do when people—our people, not like, whoever people, by the way—see me touching you? What’s that about?”
Tony wrenches his hand out from under Steve’s as he gestures wildly. “I’m not Bucky!” He says, as if exasperated by the very idea of having to spell things out. “I can’t just be your comfort person while you’re looking for the real thing. I—I don’t know everything about you, about your asthma or your temper, about when to fight and when not to, I can’t just be a comfort when you need me, I can’t—”
“It’s okay,” Tony says, and Steve sees him begin to reach out, but stop. Steve feels an ache awaken in him, the want to be touched. But he can’t bear to ask, so he nods and continues.
Tony keeps kissing him, making him walk backwards until he bumps into a wall, then they’re laughing and shushing each other. Tony quiets as he turns and digs his keys out of his pocket. He makes an impatient sound when Steve presses up behind him, resting his hands on Tony’s hips.
Tony leans back into his chair and stretches his legs out under him, and continues to slide down the seat until his chest is flush against the table and he can comfortably scoop food into his mouth. Steve watches him, confused. “Are you trying to be gross on purpose?”
He ambles out of his bedroom to look for a snack, but finds his refrigerator empty. Cupboards, too. Why is there an empty Doritos bag on the floor? Steve pockets the flask and exits his apartment, telling JARVIS to bring him to the communal floor. For sure they have some chocolate in there.
Post-ops are usually the best times for the team, everyone relieved that no one had been injured too badly, everyone taking the chance to talk about the winning strategy, or parse through the data they’d collected. Instead, the air is thick with tension.
Eventually his curiosity gets the best of him and picks up his sketchbook, flipping idly through the pages until he’s met by a wall of text, a messy scrawl of writing that wasn’t his—he never wrote on this notebook.
Thankfully—and Steve realizes that he should probably unpack that sentiment—the world stays in one piece, and there’s no call to assemble.
None of it is fair. It was never fair. I should have seen from the start that I was always going to be on the losing team—but then again, I did know. I always knew, but I thought that I was strong enough not to care.
Steve looks out the window as the quinjet exits from the launch bay. Even after all this time, Steve still finds himself staring as the quinjet’s wings unfold, marvelling at Tony’s design.
“Just want to make sure that you know what you’re really getting into,” Tony teases, but continues to keep his posture.
“Yeah, no, it’s fine, of course, anything,” Tony says quickly, averting his gaze and fidgeting with his phone again.
It’s not in the script, but Tony flips them over so he hovers over Steve, desperate to feel in control after losing himself so much under Steve’s touch.
Tony’s covering his mouth, but Steve can see how the skin around Tony’s eyes are crinkling up; he’s smiling. Steve feels inexplicably flooded with relief, and smiles as well.
I wasn’t trying to be dramatic, but looking at it now it certainly sounded that way. “You,” I said, breathless and half-crazed with desire. “You.”
“Maybe you’d like to take some time off so you can read.” he gestures to the book in Tony’s hand, only to notice Tony's white-knuckled tony’s grip on it.
They begin walking unsteadily towards Steve’s apartment, Tony’s hands occasionally holding on to Steve’s arm to keep steady.
Steve unpacks his bag efficiently and settles into what JARVIS had told him was his floor by rearranging some of the furniture (one couch, two settees, a desk and chair), then eventually putting them back.
Tony pulls Steve close, parts his lips open, and Steve loses himself in the warmth of it, the surprising intimacy of a mouth against his; he breathes in as Tony breathes out, moving his lips, sliding his tongue along Tony’s, it’s electric, it drives Steve wild.
“I don’t mean to,” Steve answers honestly. He tries to keep his breath in check; half of him wants to run away, and the other half wants to press up against all of Tony.
“I thought I just said, you know. No self-destructive behavior,” Tony lets out another strangled laugh, and takes another step away from Steve. Steve immediately misses the warmth of Tony’s hand over his chest.
Bruce is seated a few feet away from him, looking wry. “That should teach me about keeping my door unlocked,” he says dryly. Steve laughs, watery and soft.
“Oh,” Tony says, looking away. If Steve wasn’t so focused on his own shyness, he’d say Tony looked a bit timid, too. “Well, this is perfect, really, because I got you something too.”
The conversation ended too quickly, didn’t last long enough, and everything was tangled inside me like wires that needed managing. I left without saying anything else.
Steve clenches his jaw. He can’t pinpoint why he’s so anxious, which makes him feel more anxious, a constant feedback loop of worry that stutters to a stop when Tony touches his hand gently.
Steve bites back the bile rising up his throat, threatening to color his words. He doesn’t say anything, afraid to give it all away.
Tony scrubs at his face, as if mopping away frustration. It doesn’t help, and Tony continues to scowl at Steve. “Let’s just head up,” he says, and begins stalking away, barely casting a backward glance at Steve to make sure he was following.
“Yeah, let’s get it over with,” Steve bites out, and just as the words are out of his lips, he wants to stuff them back in, because for the briefest moment, hurt flashes across Tony’s face.
“Well I blame you,” Tony says, sitting up slowly. “Aren’t you supposed to be the responsible one here?”
Steve frowns. He’s never kissed anyone, not since Peggy, and that was literally a lifetime ago. And now, well. He hasn’t exactly had the time to go galavanting around. He frowns some more.
It’s been two weeks and Steve has barely slept, kept a silent vigil with JARVIS, driven half-insane with worry.
“Oh fuck you, Rogers,” Tony says sharply as he turns to stare up at Steve. “Christ. I never thought I’d be talking Captain America out of drinking.”
As soon as they’re out the door, Tony reaches over and twines their fingers together. It should be absurd, the simple gesture sends a bolt of electricity up Steve’s spine, except he’s been thinking of what it would feel like to touch Tony, and now he is.
that. I don’t think I’m allowed to, not anymore. You know?” Tony makes a small sound of understanding.
He feels antsy, but doesn’t want to go exploring alone. He looks over the tablet on his bedside, but doesn’t know what to do with it. There are no reports to be written, and it seems preemptive to use Tony’s tech to look for Bucky without Tony even knowing about it (or at least, knowing about it from Steve—he’s under no allusions that Tony doesn’t know about what happened in DC, but. There are probably parts only Steve can tell).
On the ride home, I could still taste him on my tongue. As I stepped into the shower, I could smell his cologne on my skin.
Steve wakes up to the blaring of the alarm. He dresses quickly, grabs his tablet off his desk and hefts his shield before walking briskly to the elevator. The elevator stops on Bruce’s floor, and they nod at each other in greeting. They’re silent for a few seconds before the elevator doors open to the hangar floor.
Tony opens his mouth and Steve’s entire body goes rigid with the visceral need not to be here, not to hear what Tony has to say, not anymore.
“Well. I’m here, if you want to,” Tony’s scrunches up his face. “I don’t know, talk about whatever.”
“Right,” Steve says, suddenly embarrassed. He tries to think of something else to say but his brain fails to supply anything else. He tries not to feel like this is already a disaster.
“Am I the only one getting whiplash at the pace of our conversations?” Tony says, placing his hands on Steve’s shoulders and motioning to get off Steve’s lap. Steve’s hands snap to Tony’s hips, keeping him there.
Tony looks up at him, surprise flashing on his face for a brief moment before he schools it back into something more pensive. He nods at Steve, waiting for more.
It feels like cheating to use Tony’s tech like this, but it’s not his fault JARVIS listens to him, does what he asks.
Steve’s hand is on his lower back, steering him inside a restaurant. He thinks only of what Steve said, all those weeks ago:
For a few moments, we did nothing else but breathe. I wanted him so badly it felt like an ache inside me, but what I wanted more was the victory that he’d break first.
It’s been a while since Tony has done one of these confessional-type videos. They have him pose, clad only in jeans—not bothering to have him wear anything under—as he speaks to the camera.
Tony cups Steve’s jaw gently, turning his head back to face him. “Steve,” he says, and Steve feels on fire with the sheer force of his need—to have Tony closer to him, to touch him, any part of him. He’s sure he’s never felt this way about anyone, ever, his whole body suddenly angling for closeness.
The counselor, Janet, discusses the importance of establishing clear lines of communication, of fostering a relationship that is open to discussions and disagreements. Tony bumps his shoulder against Steve’s, as if to say,
“I need to lie down,” Tony says, walking back inside Steve’s apartment. He was very good at acting like he owned any place he stepped into.
Tony remembers lying down and staring up at the trees, blinking as the sun peeked through the leaves.
Steve laughs with him, the bundle of nerves in his gut relaxing at the knowledge that he isn’t alone in his awkwardness.
Steve looks up at the ceiling of the gym, and something inside him shatters, the disappointment all of the sudden too heavy on his sternum.
“I know I sound insane because I took all of this on and I’m just—I’m trying, and it’s hard, and it shouldn’t be, and it wouldn’t be so hard if I just stopped
Tony’s hand has moved from his wrist, and he tightens his grip on Steve’s palm. “What’s wrong?” He asks.
Steve takes a deep breath, takes Tony’s face in his hands. “Here’s a constant,” he whispers, breath warm on Tony’s cheek. “I love you. I love you. You, Tony Stark. I love you.” He kisses Tony, hard and close lipped, more aggressive reminder than affection.
Something has always simmered between us. It’s felt like we’ve just been pushing, inch by inch, to see how tenuous the wall in between us really is. At least, it’s been that way with me—constantly testing, trying to figure out his limit. Of course we were friends first, until one day something shifted between us. In the years that have passed I can’t say when it was, or how. It’s not like I kept us under surveillance. Well. I think I’m above using what surveillance I have for that, at least.
It’s barely acting anymore when Tony moans as Steve kisses his way down Tony’s chest. Tony feels alight, feels
They stay in that position for a while, Steve’s hand resting against the back of Tony’s neck, breathing the same air.
“Hi,” Tony answers slowly, chucking the towel he was using into a bin and making his way over to Steve. “What’s happening?”
So, Sam can always tell, and this is probably why he ambushes Steve after dinner. Steve is in the kitchen boiling a pot of tea for the rest of the team as they settle in to watch a movie.
“Tony,” Steve sets the tablet aside to stand up. “Thank you,” he says. Tony waves him off and heads towards the kitchen.
So the team comes together, more and more, and eventually, it’s not just Tony and Steve in the tower. Steve spars with Natasha, learns to play videogames with Clint, finally figures out what Pilates is with Bruce, and then, one fateful night, drinks with Thor. It’s one of the few times Steve sleeps straight through until morning.
They pull away and the look Tony gives him is a mix of crazed and overwhelmed, and Tony breathes out, “Holy fuck.” Then, resting his hands on Steve’s shoulders, adds: “Who the fuck taught you how to do
the kind of person to galavant around and kiss people and make them fall in love with them and—Steve stands up, trying to stop himself from spiraling further.
Steve lets out a small noise of assent, his brain still catching up, how could it not stutter like that, after that sinuous movement?
Steve can’t pinpoint the exact moment when they’d gotten so comfortable with each other, maybe from all the first aid they’d performed on the quinjet, or all the meals they’d prepared and shared, jostling around the kitchen, trying to make themselves useful.
“The point is. I realized a few months ago that we were actually friends. Real friends. And I” a word is so heavily scratched out that when Steve checks, it’s bled onto the next page. “treasure our friendship a great deal. I want you to know that whatever happens, I’m here. I have your back. We’ll find Bucky, whatever it takes.”
“I knew I’d find you out here.” Steve doesn’t turn to Tony, doesn’t ask why he knew he was up. He wants to be alone, but also doesn’t. (So maybe he came out here with specific company in mind. But to admit that, even to himself, feels like defeat.)
It’s discomfiting, to be looking at Tony like this. Mostly because at this point it’s harder to pretend that he isn’t in love.
“Okay,” Tony says, because there’s a wild part of him that still thinks—there was a problem, there was a problem and if this is love, then what comes next? If this is constant, then what variable will arrive to change all of that?
“I did some digging through Howard’s stuff. I think he was trying to make it too. Got pretty close, I think,” Tony says, completely nonchalant.
The man crumples to the floor, and Steve doesn’t waste a second locating Stark, who pops his head over some crates to inspect what happened.
“Well as it stands, there’s not much company to go around,” Steve counters, smiling at Tony, trying to keep the mood light.
Tony huffs out a laugh. “I’m gonna need the—you know,” he says, waving his hand in the air. “Got this piece of garbage in my chest.”
It only takes a day or so for Steve to fully heal up, and in those hours that Steve is awake, he continues to read through Natasha’s files, trying to piece things together, to make sense of it all. By now it’s midnight, and Steve feels lonely, exhausted from all the reports about death.
But it’s not like the touches really mean anything, Steve rationalizes. He was dimly aware of the mania that descends on his consciousness over how touch-starved (Natasha’s words) Tony is, and only realizes the mania for what it is when he catches himself watching Tony’s hands bury into Thor’s wild hair. Steve resolves to spend some time alone, if only to recalibrate.
“You have me,” Tony gives Steve’s hand a quick squeeze, aiming for reassuring. “You have me, and Natasha, and Bruce, and yeah, I guess Thor and Clint if you’re so inclined,” Tony tries for a laugh, but fails miserably. “You have us,” Tony finishes, and looks at Steve again.
“I know you can.” Steve breathes in, steadies himself, and then runs a hand through Tony’s hair. “But not all at once.”
“Before you,” Steve pauses. “I mean, I was out this afternoon and.” He pulls the book out from behind him—a first edition copy of Tolkien’s
Rhodey lets out a small laugh. “Well, Tones, you don’t look so bad yourself. At least, most of the time.”
Steve starts up from his desk. “Hi,” he says with a bit of a quiver, and he hates himself for it, and he hates himself for hating himself for it. Everything’s so fucking messed up.
Thankfully, Tony does. It feels strange, to be in this space again, to have this kind of conversation with Tony where they’re talking
Steve feels Tony’s body begin to relax, and just as he’s about to open his mouth, Tony says, “Can we talk about the rest of this in the morning?”
“Do you realize that you’ve never apologized?” Tony asks, hands fully wrapped around Steve’s mug, unashamed at the theft.
Steve’s so shocked by her words that he scoffs, and realizes that he’s done what he was afraid of earlier— he’s given it away.
Tony puffs up his chest, making Steve laugh again. Then he turns to Steve, a crooked smile on his lips. “I checked Tinder.”
Tony lets out a small noise of pleasure and Steve looks up as he takes a drink from the flask; Steve watches the way Tony’s throat moves intently for a second, then catches himself.
“It is morning, but okay,” Steve says, and he tries not to sound too happy. Tony flops down onto the couch.
Over lunch, they introduce themselves. The President is there with his wife, and Steve and Tony shake his hand. Of course Tony’s met him before, probably even donated to his campaign. They sit beside each other and make small talk; Steve leaves them to it.
“Maybe we’ll see each other again,” Tony says. He snakes his hand under Steve’s chin and tilts his face up. “RIght?”
Tony opens his mouth, closes it. A look of pain flashes over his face so quickly Steve barely catches it, but it’s enough to quell the anger flaring in his chest. Steve was trying to sound convincing, but now, he realizes, he didn’t know who he was trying to convince.
“Only a little for you,” Steve says honestly, as he continues to dig around the fridge for something that entices him.
Steve smiles up at him. “Yeah. That was nice.” Tony grins and presses a quick kiss on Steve’s nose. They’re quiet for a moment, content to breathe the same air.
Then he asked me if I wanted to move to the bed, and of course I said yes. After all, I’m only human aren’t I?
“Look, Steve,” and now it’s Tony who averts his eyes, and Steve raises his hand to touch Tony’s face, to mirror Tony’s actions, but stops, hand falling back to his side uselessly. Tony’s eyes flick up, noticing the aborted movement.
Tony shrugs, as if regretting bringing this all up in the first place. “Being real, I don’t know why I’m bringing it up now. There are too many things we still don’t know. I didn’t want to say anything preemptively.”
Everything is fuzzy after that; I can’t recount in time what happened next. Kissing Steve was a revelation, and it made me think that this like it’s what kissing should
“But how about we cut through all the mistakes I made before—” Tony stops, considers his next words, then says: “Before where I am now. See? I QA’ed it for you. No more self-destructive behavior, how about that?”
“Really? Quiet?” Steve laughs now, and nudges Tony back. Tony shrugs his shoulders, but doesn’t say anything, as if demonstrating his point.
Then again, it’s not like Steve is blind, he knows what a looker is when he sees one, and Tony’s top tier in that department. He’s suave, charismatic, enticing in a way that makes Steve pay attention. Steve huffs. “I’ve never dated anyone,” he admits, still looking away, eyes fixed on a new batch of flowers set on a side table in the living room.
The investor took in the omega. Such a plump ass, pretty pink hole that was clenching around nothing, and slick steadily dripping down. God, he wanted to fuck him right there. He secretly palmed himself through his jeans and watched how this went down.
Tony shot him a warning shot for trying to touch his property and pulled Peter closer. "No. Everything is fine." Tony growled as Peter nuzzled again Tony's neck and reached for Tony's shirt.
Tony sighed. "No, don't be. It's fine. I'm also...apologetic. I…" He bit his lip. "...I'm gonna go get Scotch."
Peter went limp when Tony grabbed him and bared his neck in submission. "...Y'know what? Since you can't seem to think about anything but sex, you're gonna get it." Peter's dick twitched against his stomach at Tony's words. "You'll be begging by the time we're done. Go entertain our guest. I'll be back." Tony walked off and dropped Peter.
