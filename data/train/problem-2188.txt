“I really don’t see what the issue is. I mean, obviously I’m aware it’s technically not legal, but I
“Yeah. I use’ to hate her for how much she’d hurt him. ’Sides, he called out her name and she turned like she’d seen a ghost, which I guess is how Dad must’ve felt. She started to run and he pushed me to get ’er.”
“Why? You’re coming back, aren’t you?”
“Yes,” John chimes in, drawing Ethan’s attention towards him, allowing Sherlock to peer into the entrance to the house. “Someone your father used to know was involved, so we were hoping he could help provide some clarity.”
was warm. That’s all there was to it. Certainly nothing more. Sherlock winds the window down a touch more, pointedly ignoring the flurrying of rain and the chill down his spine that intensifies.
“Yes, John?”
“Too quiet?”
He has no idea how to return to the person they knew, and, he thinks with a tinge of guilt, it’s been so long that he’s not sure he wants to.
as he grabs his coat and strides out onto the street.
Granted, it had actually been just under nine days since John received the call from his mother, her worry and urgency seeping through to the surface of her words sending John flying up the stairs to his bedroom, hastily tossing clothes in a duffle bag and offering a rushed explanation to Sherlock before he fled. An entire two hundred and eleven hours—not that Sherlock was counting, of course. No, no, he had more pressing matters at hand.
There is one thought, however, lingering to the side, threatening to pop out of hiding if Sherlock pays it so much as an iota of attention; one that Sherlock smothers whenever it rears it’s head. It’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Sherlock’s poised, tense,
“Sorry, Dad. I was just talking with these officers.”
“She did.” Thomas goes quiet for a moment, shaking his head gently before lifting it to meet Sherlock’s gaze. “I don’t know why she had a blue one on when she died.”
But it also remains the only reason John can think of for the bizarre shift in Sherlock’s behaviour.
John doesn’t like it. It sets him on edge, and he can’t relax, no matter how hard he tries.
He also notes, though only mentally, the quiet humming coming from his left, a gentle companion to the low volume of the radio he’d flicked on. Another wave of emotion overtakes him and he finds himself wanting, wanting
It had just gone 12 am when Sherlock’s phone rang. A quick glance told him it was Lestrade. The temptation to let it ring out was strong; he was in the midst of an experiment, of course. But a call in the middle of the night meant exciting, interesting by even Sherlock’s standards.
“Please,” she breathes out shakily.
The chill in the air hits his flushed cheeks, draping it’s tendrils around his neck, forcing him to tighten his scarf as he strolls towards Mycroft’s car. It starts with a powerful
. Blood pools on the ground, a gurgling sound filling the air as Thomas fights for breath.
“Good. Now, if we ignore for the moment that the sewing needles are placed as such, why would they use a dress that is clearly too large for a woman this size? Wouldn’t it be easier to find a dress that’s closer to her size and go from there? That’d be more practical, wouldn’t you agree?”
“And what did you tell her, or do?”
“Even though it took you, what was it? Five days to notice?” There’s an easy tone to his voice, the wine easing any unresolved tension. “I almost want to be offended that it took you that long, but it’s not all that surprising, to be honest.”
“What was she doing there?”
“Right…” John licks his lips, glancing at the house and back. “And what are you doing?”
“What?” John’s head whips around so swiftly Sherlock is momentarily concerned he may have whiplash. But when he looks over, he’s met with an expression similar to the many he recalls from their Hounds of Baskerville case: open mouth, the whites of his eyes visible, disapproval accentuating it all.
“Well, Mycroft
She tightens her lips as she nods, her arms withdrawing close to her body, her thumb absentmindedly twisting her wedding ring around. Her eyes flicker again to the photograph of William. “Edythe’s an only child.”
“Investigation?” Ethan withdraws his hand, pulling his jacket tighter around him to shield against the wind bringing in a chill around them.
Lestrade hurries to grab his takeaway cup, chasing to catch up to Sherlock. “We’ve already questioned them all, Sherlock. Got everything we need to know.” He even adds a smile for good measure, though he instantly regrets it when Sherlock stops on the spot and stares blankly at him.
“Agree with it?” Anger flashes through Ethan, the knife inadvertently piercing John’s skin and drawing a drop of blood, causing him to wince. “It was insane. It was like he was trying to replace Mum. He puts her in Mum’s wedding dress and shoes, starts going on and on ’bout how he’d dreamt of this day for years and tells me to fix her dress while he gets ready. ’S when she started spewing lies upon lies about how he abused her and how the only way she could get away was faking her death and taking the place of her twin sister and all this other crazy shit. And she wouldn’t stop. ‘He hit me constantly’ and ‘threatened to kill me if I tried to leave’ and she just wouldn’t stop so I hit ’er, again and again for all the lies and hurt she caused.”
“Well, no. I don’t have a licence.”
But late at night, when the silence is at it’s loudest and sleep eludes him, he’s almost anticipating the ringing of gunshots filling the flat or a small explosion from whatever experiment Sherlock’s working on at the time. It provides him with a lingering sense of nostalgia he doesn’t dare to admit to anyone, not even Sherlock. Shame bites at his ankles whenever the thought arises. Although Sherlock would probably be able to deduce it by some minuscule detail in his features or the way he holds the newspaper or something equally pretentious and unbelievable.
John grabs the file he’d placed back in the glove box, and runs a thumb down until he finds the mother’s name. “Have you spoken to Helen yet?”
The sight of John standing there, waiting for him already, accelerates his heart rate. Then his eyes slide over his body and he takes note of his rigid form, the way he’s holding himself: straight back, eyes straight ahead, hands partially clenched by his side. His duffel bag rests at his feet and is the final piece for Sherlock to know that something’s different, that something happened in the 14 hours since they parted. And it can’t be anything good.
about her body?”
Sherlock scoffs. “What would give you that idea? Surely not the size of the victim. And you know how much I despise that word,
A scoff escapes Lestrade, mostly out of shock at Sherlock’s ego (which he can’t believe he’s still surprised by), but Sherlock’s mind has already latched back onto the deliberate rip in the victim’s skirt, mind racing as he scrutinises all the possibilities, the conversation already deleted from his memory. “Focusing solely on the sewing needles, tell me what you see.”
“Visiting her father, Dad said. ’Membered when he read ’bout his passing in the paper.”
“Sounds about right,” John chimes in. “Anyways, it’s not like I expected you to message me.”
“Lestrade wouldn’t hand over the file,” Sherlock replies simply. “Open it up and read over the information.”
John stares at her dazedly for a second before it clicks. He chooses not to deny her assumption but instead offers her a kind smile. He opens his mouth to ask a question, but Sherlock speaks first.
“Well, I almost hope you’re wrong more often, then,” John says, closing the distance between them.
“79,” Sherlock confirms.
Sherlock briefly considers driving to the hospital to demand brain scans, but quickly brushes the idea aside. He’s just being absurd. It was simply a momentary mind blank. He’s fine… If John happens to question him, he can simply feign having gone to his mind palace.
Sherlock shakes his head, a concentrated pinch to his face. “I don’t think so.”
“No, she was an only child, jus’ like her parents. Nothing like the six siblings I had or the five my wife had.”
Edythe was still alive when she supposedly died 52 years ago, the question is what led to her ending up in that suitcase?”
The front door closes soundlessly despite her angry retreat, and a layer of unease settles in his stomach. John stares at the house, calculating; hesitant, and Sherlock can’t determine his next move. A moment passes before he spins towards the car, as though the sudden gust of wind is pushing him, and silently gets in. Sherlock falters for a brief moment before doing the same.
Ethan’s shoulders tense, the veins in his neck becoming more prominent as anger overflows. “My father was heartbroken after he thought she died. She caused him so much pain, and now she’s telling all these lies about him? I… She couldn’t be allowed to marry him!”
The front door flies open then, multiple footsteps pounding the ground, Lestrade’s voice loud as he announces the police’s presence.
, as one such as this when the silence surrounding his every waking moment in the flat is deafening?
He cannot for the life of him comprehend why his mind continues to remain fixated on John when he’s finally been presented with a case as extraordinary as this. How often would he encounter a woman who was supposed to have been dead for 52 years, only to turn up in a suitcase days after her death. He supposes there’s an exact percentage, but he finds his thoughts drifting back to John before he can calculate it.
his home.
Sherlock stills for a moment, a slight tilt to his head and a quizzical look on his features as he thinks back over the past couple days. “He’s been gone, what? Two days?”
“Yeah,” John breathes out. He should probably head inside, check on his father, check on
Sherlock resumes his determined stride, flipping the collar of his coat up for good measure, and Lestrade sighs. A quick glance at his watch tells him it’s just gone 2 am. It’s going to be a long night.
“Yeah, that’s one way to put it…” Lestrade trails off in a way that irritates Sherlock immensely, the reception crackling slightly through the phone due to the heavy rain currently covering London.
Sherlock gestures to the glovebox in front of John. “There’s a file in there.”
John nods and instructs Sherlock to find Beverly. He sits with Helen, holding her hand while they wait for their return. They leave her after promising to return when they’re certain of what occurred on that fateful day and on Edythe’s life afterwards.
The device vibrates in his hand and Sherlock feels a strange, warm sensation begin to swell in his chest. The warmth turns to a chill, however, when the words
The car holds a chill from where it sat in the shade. Sherlock turns on the car to start the heaters, but leaves it parked as he turns to face John.
“I thought everything in that box was going to be tossed? Besides, you did say I could take the photo. Oh, wait, I must’ve
“Easy. I noticed that he favoured his left leg but not in a way that seemed natural for him, indicating a recent injury, the cause being the wedding shoes they forced Edythe into, which you discovered in the living room. Upon examining Edythe’s body, there were indents on her wrists that matched the design of the ring he’d been twisting anxiously. His rambling was another sign, as well as forcing his father to have his medication when the conversation veered towards his mother. The photograph of Dorothy in the wedding dress was merely the icing on the cake. Lestrade’s always on me to find evidence that even Anderson could understand.”
“Last time I saw her was back in 1960, the morning she died. Or when I thought she died, I guess… She left that morning, dressed in her favourite red coat. God, she looked beautiful,” he says, a wistful look on his face as he stares at the wall. “She said she was meeting someone but wouldn’t tell me who. Figured it was to do with the wedding. We were getting married in a couple weeks. I got the call a couple hours later to come identify her. It hurt to look at her, see her lying there. There was so much blood, all over her hair, on her blue coat… At least the impact killed her instantly.”
“What?”
. Always.)
The countryside rolls by, Sherlock practically on autopilot as his mind flashes moment upon moment of John. John laughing, smiling, grinning in response to someone—all the times John gazed or glanced or outright stared at Sherlock when he thought he couldn’t see him. Memories of John flash by, increasing in speed as his mind races.
They’re seated on the front step, police milling around as the temperature starts to dwindle. An emergency shock blanket is draped around their shoulders, much to Sherlock’s insistence it’s not required. John holds a tissue against his neck, his mind reeling as he thinks over the last few days, analysing everything he thought he knew. “How long had you known Ethan had killed Edythe?”
When no response comes forth, Sherlock rises from his crouched position and spins, searching for the familiar jacket amongst the few officers milling around the airport. “John?”
John looks down at the notebook, using the pen to help him scan through his notes. “Do you remember thinking anything was different or, I don’t know,
Sherlock cheeks flush slightly and he turns his gaze to the distance, attempting to appear nonchalant. “Oh, right. I knew that.”
She opens her mouth, then closes it quickly upon looking at the photo of William. “I, uh, I didn’t get a chance to do anything, because William, my late husband, had just returned home and she rushed home…” She clears her throat. “We never saw Thomas after Edythe’s passing, aside from the odd occasion in town or at the cemetery. Can’t say I wasn’t glad. There was always something about him that… unsettled me. Something about his eyes. When the police first told us about Edythe, I was so scared he’d done something to her.”
Sherlock had never had a best friend, or even a friend really for that matter. Not one he can remember, that is. He supposes his early years might tell a different story. He’d had colleagues, acquaintances, sure, but even referring to people in his life as such was a stretch. He had never had someone who was willing to be close to him, to put up with him and everything that his level of intellect and lack of outward emotions consisted of. And God knows Sherlock never needed that, especially something as trivial as a
Perhaps it’s because he’s only really known John in London, but as the house comes into view, looming over them, Sherlock can’t help thinking that John doesn’t seem to fit in here. That he instead belongs in their flat with the smile on the wall, the skull on the mantelpiece… with him. Though maybe that’s just the part of him that’s constantly anticipating the day John leaves him, never wanting to be taken by surprise when it inevitably happens.
A heavy sigh flows through the phone as Lestrade pointedly chooses to ignore the remark, “We reran the tests three times and they all state the same thing. She’s Edythe Carter, 79 years old, and has been officially dead 52 years.”
“Are you alright?”
“Jesus…” Lestrade breathes out, his eyes taking in Thomas’s lifeless body on the linoleum, a distraught Ethan held in place by John. “What happened?”
“Well, if you’re sure… I’ve noticed you’ve been favouring your left leg quite heavily,” Sherlock mentions, drawing John’s attention towards where Ethan had absentmindedly lifted the pant sleeve to scratch at his right shin, revealing a small, slowly healing wound above the ankle. “Nasty injury you’ve got there, Ethan. Looks like you’ve been kicked by, say, the pointed heel of a wedding shoe.”
The rain comes, quick and sudden, and it’s only once he feels the steady stream of water down his back that he makes a move to head inside.
, I would see her in Edythe. How are you meant to forget someone who never really leaves you?”
.” Sherlock sneers at the title, as though he doesn’t believe Greg is worthy of the title after an observation like that. “We’re looking for the facts, not trying to invent the plot for a bad movie. Now if you could please tell me what you
“Are you okay?” Sherlock interrupts. He doesn’t fully understand his desire to know how John is currently feeling; how John's been feeling the last eleven days—those eleven days
“I wanna talk with Helen. It’s getting late now, though, so I’ll do it tomorrow. Hopefully she can fill in some information about Edythe.”
“You’re very sweet, dear.” Helen reaches a hand out, resting it gently atop John’s, her gaze gesturing to Sherlock standing behind him, his arm resting on the chair, just out of reach of John’s shoulder. “He’s lucky to have you.”
“Your father had killed her and staged it to look like a suicide. Surely you’ve heard the rumors from her friends and–”
The hour drive passes with the majority heavily featuring rolling hills and winding roads. Helen’s house is hidden by expansive trees and blooming flowers of practically every kind spread across the front lawn that’s more garden than anything. A blue door is nestled behind an array of pot plants, and a frail woman answers the door when Sherlock knocks.
, that Sherlock’s eyes drift to his lips for just the briefest of seconds before darting up and away, the softest red dusting his cheeks.
A quick shake of the head (John’s pathetic attempt to prohibit Sherlock from taking an even deeper root in his mind) and he settles further into the chair situated by the window.
, but what exactly, he isn’t even sure. (Wanting to bottle the sound of John’s voice so he never has to endure another eleven days without hearing it? Wanting to be back in their flat, mindless noise coming from the TV as they sit, where they’re okay because they’re together again? Wanting to draw him into a kiss that conveys all he regrets never telling him? (That last one might be the winner.))
Sherlock takes the moment to glance about the room, the sight of John catching him, and he pauses. The last few glimmers of sunlight streaming in through the open curtains illuminates the concerned yet concentrated look on his face, highlighting the few greys littered about his hair. It strikes him suddenly, the longing he’d experienced in John’s absence increasing tenfold, threatening to weigh him down. He tries to deflect it, force it to the back of his mind, in order to listen as Thomas recounts that fateful morning.
They kindly decline her offer, and she takes a seat opposite John, her hands clasped in front of her to still the tremor running down her arm.
“I might need back-up,” Sherlock says airily, fighting the temptation to look over at John.
“My father’s a murderer, that’s what,” Ethan dejectedly says.
“Since he first opened the door.”
John shifts in his seat. He sets his gaze out the window. “That’s different…”
“So you approached her and what? Kidnapped her?” Sherlock spies Ethan’s jaw tensing, the simmering rage hiding behind his piercing stare. “Ah, but it wasn’t your idea.”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s grip on the steering wheel tightens just long enough for John to notice. (He pretends not to.) “Right.”
The sound of the front door opening echoes throughout the house, cutting through the tension as the slightly unsteady steps of Thomas can be heard as he draws closer. He freezes in place upon entering the kitchen, the sight of his son holding John hostage sobering him. “Ethan? What… What are you doing?”
“Okay, keep me updated and be sure to send me through that information and their contact details.”
reasoning—behind coming to see John, but then the front door swings open and out steps a bewildered John. Sherlock exits the vehicle, taking one, two, three steps towards John, the other instinctively closing the rest of the distance. A mere metre lies between them and it’s almost too much.
She squeezes his shoulder, her voice gentle as she knowingly says, “I do hope John returns soon.”
Ethan lets out a weak chuckle, the pant sleeve falling back into place as he stands, and he moves towards the kitchen. “Ran into something hiding amongst the mess of my father’s belongings.”
“You didn’t agree with it, though.”
John steps closer and digs his hand in the left pocket of Sherlock’s coat, rummaging around until he retrieves a pocket-sized notebook. He catches the befuddled expression on Sherlock’s face when he glances up. “What? I know you keep one in your coat, and I didn’t bring mine.”
She shakes her head, her eyes involuntarily filling with tears.
Sherlock’s keen eyes analyse the situation, momentarily glancing at Ethan settling his father into a chair before turning to take in the surroundings. Crowded around them are boxes upon boxes stacked in precarious piles, creating narrow pathways throughout the loungeroom. The closest box is filled with books and newspapers, and the one just to the right holds photographs. Family photos, many of Ethan in his youth, a few of Thomas working on his car, one of a wedding. A golden frame in particular catches Sherlock’s eye, displaying Thomas in his late 20’s on the front steps of the house they’re currently standing in, enclosing someone Sherlock deduces to be a young Edythe in a hug. Scrawled on the side of the box in chunky letters are the words ‘throw away’.
was high on the list), he hadn’t expected those two words
the British Government. And besides, he hardly notices his car is missing half the time.”
“I couldn’t lose you, too,” Thomas admits, sorrow dripping from his voice.
and took the first opportunity you could. I mean, who picks
John coughs to draw his attention to a solitary white heeled shoe peeking out from under a pile—a perfect match to the one found on Edythe’s body. Sherlock slips his phone from his pocket and snaps a photo.
It’s a moment before Sherlock speaks. He scans over John’s face, noting the soft crinkle around the corners of his eyes, the warmth behind the gloat, the adoration that’s unmistakable. He leans close, drawing John near with the look in his eye, his voice just a murmur, a mere breath against John’s lips. “I don’t mind being wrong if it means I have you by my side. If... it means I can kiss you.”
“So what now?”
they find?”
“Nothing ’sides the coat.”
“C’mon. You’ve clearly got the upper hand here and this is the one thing I can’t figure out,” Sherlock coaxes. He can practically see the wheels turning in Ethan’s head as he weighs up his options. “It must’ve been by chance that you found her, surely.”
“Precisely.”
The ride back to John’s father’s house consists of a few observations of the surrounding area, almost all coming from Sherlock. He notes the cleanliness of the air, how quiet it is amongst the small towns—a complete contrast to the busy, bustling city he’s always known.
“For those texts,” John says. “When you messaged, asking how I was… I don’t know. That had been a really difficult day. Dad’s health had been looking good the past couple days, but then it took a turn for the worst… We’d just gotten to the hospital when your text came through, and uh, I just… I just couldn’t get a handle on my emotions. I didn’t mean to take it out on you. Well, not all of it. You deserved it a bit.”
that’s resting on the edge of his tongue. Her retreating steps sound down the stairs and he raises the cup to his lips, taking a sip as his mind wanders from the case.
John rises from his chair, filling one of the clean glasses resting on the dish rack and placing it on the table. Still standing, he takes the moment to look at Sherlock. He’s unsure whether his brief glimpse was able to convey his theory, even when Sherlock nods at him, but he takes his seat across from Helen and waits for her to look up.
“Dad’d mentioned over the years how he use’ to be engaged, ’fore he met Mum and all.”
Ethan follows along, throwing questioning looks to John a few steps behind him. “Me? Why me?”
Before Sherlock can begin to formulate a response, another text comes through.
“Do you know what happened to Agatha afterwards? Where she ended up?”
Ethan’s mouth opens to respond, but instead he just stares, his eyes darting about the kitchen to the points of exit.
“I asked Lestrade the same thing, because surely Anderson messed something up with the DNA, but no. It’s definitely the Edythe Carter who died in 1960. Lestrade did some digging and discovered that both Edythe’s parents and her fiancé had correctly identified her.”
“No time to explain, John. I need your assistance.” His response comes out clipped, autopilot taking over in the face of something that threatens to engulf him. He gestures to the car, turning around with what John perceives to be an unspoken expectation for him to follow.
, compromise that for anything or anyone. It just wouldn’t be logical in the slightest.
A sharp intake of air fills Ethan’s lungs. “No…”
“Uh,” she sniffs, “there’s Beverly next door. She should, uh, she should be home. I…”
Taking a seat opposite Thomas, situated between two precarious piles of newspapers, John flips through the pages until he comes across a page that isn’t filled with scribblings that vaguely resemble words and numerous calculations. “Okay, Thomas,” he begins, his voice steady. “I know this is all very confusing, but it’s really important. When was the last time you saw Edythe?”
“Yes, but why hide it?” Confusion etches itself over John’s face as he stares at the pages, as though he’ll find the answer written there. This case is making less and less sense with the more information revealed. “If he knew she was alive, why tell the police it was her body found? And whose body
“Try five,” Lestrade corrects.
, the mallet gripped tightly, grooves of the handle familiar. He can sense it coming, can sense the change in atmosphere, the destruction it teases to inflict.
“I do, but I figured you wouldn’t appreciate it at the current time.” John can only stare at him incredulously. “It’s also because you’ve summed up what I would have stated.”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Am I just going to be a replacement for John while he's gone?” Lestrade’s tone is of one who thinks he should be offended but doesn’t have the energy to be. It’s easier to do as the consulting detective commands.
“No, you didn’t.”
“But why did you believe him? That the lady at the cemetery was his late fiancé? Surely he would’ve mentioned that she’d died.”
“Because it never works.” John sighs, running a hand over his face. He fixes his sight on Sherlock, staring almost long enough for Sherlock to feel the need to shift in his seat or draw John’s attention elsewhere. “Okay, enough of that before I lose my mind… Wanna tell me what our game plan is?”
“Oh, that’s alright, Ethan,” Sherlock says, stepping to the side of Ethan to enter the house. “We also were hoping to talk to you, too.”
“I imagine that she wanted to take the dress size in.”
“Did she have many friends growing up, or in her adult life?”
“I… I really missed you while you were gone.”
(But then again, Sherlock had never been all that logical when it came to John.)
Lestrade looks between the three of them before settling on Sherlock, his face twisted as he struggles to absorb the scene before him. “Mind filling me in?”
There’s a slight sway to her as she strains to look up at his tall figure. She nods shakily, stepping back to guide them to the kitchen and gesturing to the seats. “Please, call me Helen. Can I get you anything? Drinks? Biscuits?”
“And you’re certain it was her?”
“Just follow my lead.”
“It’s too time-consuming, taking the test and learning all the silly little rules.”
She grips John’s hand tightly, her eyes surveying Sherlock’s face in search of something—of hope, of refuge maybe. Tears drip down her cheeks, a slow but steady stream. “Edythe had a twin sister, Agatha…” she admits through a sob, her voice strained as she continues. “They were so beautiful. I loved them more than anything, the way their little hands grasped mine, and their sweet, innocent eyes…”
hidden this photo behind the framed one of your father with Edythe. My mistake.”
before this week. And you’ve been back, what? Close to two years now? Meanwhile any time Dad showed signs of being unwell,
from us?”
“Ethan,” Sherlock says, taking miniscule steps closer, his hands steady in front of him. “Your father was an abusive man. We spoke with Edythe’s mother, and she told us about how much Edythe had insisted on the abuse she endured at your father’s hands.”
“I…”  Sherlock pauses, tensing his fingers briefly against the steering wheel, and for a moment, he’s worried about what might leave his mouth. He settles on something safer than the thoughts that have run rampant through his mind the past few days. “I thought you might be bored.”
“Sherlock, it’s fine,” John says, holding up his hands. “I’m guessing the reason no one ever heard of or from Edythe after the building collapsed is that she used the opportunity to escape and assumed the life of her sister. Helen mentioned about Thomas’s abusiveness so it would’ve been an almost perfect way to get away. It’s the only thing I can think of that makes sense to me.”
John shakes his head, reaching over again to hold one of her hands. “You couldn’t’ve possibly known, especially with more than twenty years in between.”
Sherlock nods, pushing to keep his voice level, to placate him. “So you bring her back here and put her in a wedding dress. Why?”
, and he swears, he swears
Thomas’s legs begin to buckle under his weight, and he mumbles something along the lines of “I need to sit down”, an ashen expression falling over his face. Ethan, with a firm hand around his father, leads him inside with Sherlock and John following closely behind.
“Uh, not exactly.”
“Starving.”
, this investigation would proceed a lot quicker.”
The car was warm,
“Ready?” Sherlock asks when John slides into the passenger seat. He purposely avoids pushing further, not wanting to disrupt the progress they’ve made—it’s only been a day since they’ve properly spoken.
Sherlock nods. “Is he alright to talk to us?”
It’s quiet.
“It was twins. You’ve said it numerous times over the years that it’s never twins.”
“We spoke with Thomas yesterday,” John takes over, “and he said he remembers she’d mentioned going to meet someone, but she never revealed who it was.” He glances at Sherlock, who nods once again, and he presses on. “Do you think there’s a chance Edythe found out about Agatha and somehow tracked her down?”
“Okay.”
“How did you find Edythe?” The words rush out of his mouth, catching everyone in the room by surprise, including himself.
“You were right,” John breathes out, breaking the silence that had settled over them. “It’s only been eleven days, but I have missed this.” There’s a hint of longing in his voice, something John hadn’t expected to come through, so before he can inadvertently admit to anything that could possibly condemn him, he exits the vehicle. He makes for the house, but stops when he doesn’t hear the sound of the engine. Cautiously, he steps around the car and waits for Sherlock to roll down the window. “Sherlock?”
“Harry?” John tries, his hand outstretched with the need to follow, but the uncertainty of not quite knowing how keeping him frozen.
Her gasp in response rings out throughout the room and a stricken expression falls over Helen’s face. Her hands tremble for a brief moment before stilling as a distant look settles into her features.
Sherlock’s knuckles rap swiftly on the door, providing a sense of urgency for those inside of the house. He notes the array of flower bushes and assorted pot plants that appear to be in dire need of tending to. The front door opens and they’re met by a middle-aged man of a height that could rival John’s.
“We’re investigating the recent death of someone you knew, and were wondering about the last time you saw or spoke to her.”
are being screamed at him, over and over and over, and oh, how he wishes he could scold himself for not focusing on the case, on something else, on anything that isn’t John.
“All the airport staff is still here, I presume,” Sherlock asks, though it’s more of a statement than a question, moving in the direction of the nearest security guard.
“John, come look at this. I need your eyes,” Sherlock called over his shoulder, eyes fixed on the corpse. She appeared to be in her 80’s, judging by the wrinkles and age spots adorning her face. She’s practically swimming in an enormous wedding dress that consumes her delicate frame, and one white shoe that looks as though it would fall off with the slightest movement. What strikes Sherlock as odd were the dozens of sewing needles placed haphazardly along the material. That, however, wasn’t nearly as odd as the fact that the body had been discovered in a suitcase at the baggage carousel of the airport.
His phone chimes again, the single word
Sherlock takes this opportunity to investigate some of the other belongings, gesturing for John to do the same. Behind the box filled with photos sits a bag overflowing with women’s clothing, all distinctly from the 1970’s. He makes a mental note to look into Dorothy’s police report.
“You what?”
Helen’s quiet; still hasn’t moved except for the rise and fall of her chest, for almost long enough that even Sherlock feels concern begin to rise. She lets out a shaky exhale, and when she speaks, her voice is hushed, practically a mutter to herself.
“Is it?”
and the
“I don’t have any secrets to hide.”
Sherlock sends
“Are you sure?”
“I never said she wasn’t,” Sherlock adds. “But the way you responded, the phrasing, leads me to believe that’s not correct.”
He finds himself humming that morning, the sounds complimenting the ones he recalls John humming as he’d updated his blog time and time again, the melody simple yet sweet in his head as he studies the blood samples under the microscope. Though it isn’t until Mrs Hudson enters the kitchen carrying a tray of tea that he notices.
“That’ll have to wait,” Sherlock says as he puts the car into drive and pulls out onto the road. “I don’t know whose body they identified as Edythe back in 1960 because the Edythe we found didn’t have a freckle above her eyebrow.”
“And what is it we’re doing now, John?”
“I need someone without my level of intellect to tell me what they see. It helps me think, process.”
John’s smile widens as he recalls the line from after the first case. There had been so much intensity, so much adrenaline pumping through his veins that night; the exhilaration keeping him on his feet. But then he’d looked at Sherlock, and those feelings paled in comparison to what he felt then, to what he feels now.
the one who’s here, no matter what. You can shove your apology right up your ass for all I care.”
“Is your father in?”
“You were eight when she died, right? You remember their fights, don’t you? Screaming matches that resulted in the police being called numerous times. Don’t you think that if your father is capable of kidnapping a woman he abused decades ago, that he would be capable of killing your mother?”
“Oh really, John?” Harry calls from the front door, her eyes narrowed as she advances towards them, gravel crunching beneath her determined gait. “What about when you left for Afghanistan? Dad had a health scare back then and you just left like it was nothing.”
“In what way?”
“Jesus,” John breathes out. His eyes analyse the photograph, taking in her crumpled form, the almost resigned look to her, if that were possible to convey in death. “That poor woman. She’s, what, 70? 80?”
“From the box titled ‘throw away’.”
John’s going to need a drink. Or maybe two or three.
“Don't look so surprised, Lestrade. It was either you or Anderson, and God knows the case would cease to a halt if he tried to assist.”
“For when we talk to Thomas. Are we gonna storm in there and accuse him of helping Edythe or what?”
But Ethan remains frozen on the floor as he takes in the sight of his father’s unmoving body. He releases his grip on the knife and lets his body sag as the depth of the situation dawns on him. He doesn’t resist as John grabs his wrists and restrains him.
Ethan gives his father’s shoulder a squeeze, his eyes downcast for a moment, before they find the clock on the wall. “Time for your afternoon pills.”
“Lestrade has, but I haven’t yet. Was planning to do that if Thomas proved pointless.”
“She was wearing a blue coat when you identified her?” Sherlock asks, his interest piqued.
The urge to hide away in his mind palace is strong, the temptation almost overpowering him. But despite how desperately he needs the flimsy veil of self-control, Sherlock cannot run the risk of the police catching him without a licence. Mycroft may be the British Government but Sherlock certainly doesn’t want to deal with him if he can help it.
Sherlock doesn’t start the car right away, hands clasped in his lap. John stares at him questioningly. “Wh–”
They leave then, the harsh chill that’s now settled in the air for the night following them as they slip into the car. Ethan waves them off from the front door, and John gives an obligatory wave back.
was that moment they just shared? There is no way John can begin to dissect whatever that was without the slight (massive) risk of going insane. But allowing it to run free in his mind would be just as, if not more, detrimental for his sanity.
“Thank you for the tea, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says in place of the
stare back at him. The screen fades and Sherlock blinks. Had he missed something? Some kind of indication of John’s mood? Out of all the responses he could have anticipated (
“Okay, so you know who to talk to and you’ve got their address, so why am I here? You’ve questioned people with less information on your own before.”
John watches in shock, trying to keep his guard up in case Ethan makes for either of them, even when the scene brings forth memories he’s tried to bury: soldiers dying on surgery tables despite his vow to protect them, hands gripping his as fear overtakes them in their last final moments.
“That was important! Besides,” he adds quickly, cutting John off from whatever reprimand he was about to administer, “there’s hardly a time where my driving is called upon, so it’s easier to just forfeit the licence.”
“Ethan’s mum, Dorothy,” he says, gesturing behind him to his son. “We met in ‘63, were married a year later, until she, God rest her soul, killed herself when Ethan was 8. It’s jus’ been the two of us since then.”
“You’ve got no deductions for me about what just happened? No ‘Harry’s scared so that’s why she exploded at me’? No ‘you hate that she’s right’? Nothing?”
“I suppose you’re right.”
But even so, it still manages to catch him by surprise. Not the thought, no… Sherlock had already acknowledged it, however uneasily. No, it’s the intensity that startles him, the severity of the realisation that John feels like home. That John
Sherlock’s eyes flicker a few times in confusion as the question registers. “Wrong? What are you talking about?”
Sherlock glances at John, who nods, moving slightly to guard the exit that leads to the backyard. Sherlock remains in front of the entrance to the living room.
that Sherlock had never received wholeheartedly before that causes him to push and prod, to find and test the limits and edges to John’s tolerance that he just doesn’t appear to have when it comes to Sherlock. It’s been years and Sherlock still doesn’t have an answer for how that makes him feel.
“Waiting for you.” Sherlock sounds as though he’s stating the obvious, which John supposes it would be for him.
A croak is all that leaves Thomas’s mouth when he goes to answer. He gestures to Ethan for the glass of water on the cabinet, a slight tremor in his hands when his hands raise the glass to his lips.
“How’d she die?”
“I didn’t find out Dad was sick until after we were deployed.” John’s voice starts hard and stubborn, but morphs into an awful quiet, his shoulders sagging with the weight of his guilt. “I am sorry, Harry.”
“Do I just?” Harry bitterly laughs, years of resentment glaringly obvious. “You couldn’t
And for the love of everything John knew,
The familiar message tone chimes and Sherlock unlocks his phone to read the words
“What? The moment we met him? You knew and you didn’t do anything? And– wait a minute. How on earth could you possibly have known it was him?”
Sherlock needs to leave. He’d never before noticed how little his self control around John is, and he can feel it slipping away rapidly, like water through helpless fingers, and
“Good afternoon, Mrs. Carter,” Sherlock greets with a warm smile. “We’re with Scotland Yard as part of the investigation surrounding Edythe. We had a couple more questions, if you don’t mind.”
John’s shock surprises himself. This is a prime example of Sherlock being Sherlock. “So Mycroft knows about your lack of licence, obviously, and he still lets you borrow his car? Incredible.”
“Right, right. Like the lone wedding shoe hiding over there, perhaps.” Sherlock follows at a close distance, his eyes memorising the intricate routes between the piles of boxes. “Have you noticed that you tend to ramble, Ethan?”
Not having John around made his heart ache in a unique way he’s never before known, but it was the silence that got to him the most, intensifying that ache and leaving behind an emptiness that begged to be noticed.
The blood drains from Ethan’s face, his features distorting with disbelief. “Where’d you get that?”
“Mycroft would say so. I, however, would classify it as temporarily being in my possession.”
“For what?” Sherlock’s tone is one of indifference, his eyes focused on the road, and John’s immensely grateful for it.
Sherlock glances around the lounge room, eyes searching for the pieces of evidence he’d spied yesterday. “Sometimes speaking with a relative can help us solve a case. You know, get their point of view, find out what secrets they may or may not realise they’re hiding, that sort of thing.”
, Sherlock hurries to correct himself—was a little more difficult to place. John was standing there, last glimmers of sun shining around him, and he’d intended to say something. What it was, though, Sherlock cannot recall.
Something about the dismissive tone of John’s voice stings, for reasons Sherlock cannot fully comprehend, and he doesn’t respond. Whether John picks up on it remains to be seen.
“Yes, fine.”
“Kids?” Sherlock turns to John, his eyebrows furrowed, disbelief clouding his features and filling his voice. “We’re very clearly adults. The man commits murder, twice, and he isn’t even able to classify us as the right age.”
in his life. He was perfectly fine solving cases, proving his intelligence to anyone in the vicinity, regardless of whether they wanted to listen.
Helen whips her head up, her mouth agape as her panicked eyes meet Sherlock’s. “I must’ve misspoke.”
“Do you really think I’m going to leave without speaking to a single member of airport personnel? At a scene of which our victim was found in a suitcase, might I add? Thought you would've known me better after six years, Lestrade.”
“Well, she’s not alive now,” Sherlock deadpans, “but yes, it is ‘insane’, as you put it.”
“Mind filling me in next time you figure stuff out straight away?” John attempts fruitlessly, already knowing the answer.
Ethan glances at it before folding it in half and slipping it into his pocket, giving him a curt nod. “Will do.”
Thomas’s shoulders droop slightly, the bag in his hand crinkling slightly. “She was gonna take you away from me.”
“Right...” The information flurries about John’s head, and despite all the mysterious and odd cases he’d previously covered with Sherlock, it’s a difficulty to fully wrap his mind around it. “So, what are we doing now, then?”
“I kind of wanted to hear your thoughts. I’m very impressed with your deductive skills back there, the whole piecing together about Agatha and it being her body they discovered.” John opens his mouth and Sherlock rushes to add, “I– I don’t mean that in a condescending way. I just meant that I do value your input and your involvement and–”
and Sherlock stretches his fingers around the steering wheel, briefly relishing in the power lying beneath his grip.
Sherlock puts the vehicle into drive, and they head in a similar direction to yesterday. A wave of relief washes over him when he realises whatever the reason for this change in John has nothing to do with him. He’d been dreading the thought of returning to the silence of 221B on his own after this case is solved, but now, he’s not sure he’ll have to. He makes a mental note to check in on John later.
Sherlock was different. But why? It ate at him, the way he couldn’t understand why. Sherlock had never asked if John was okay, unless he was visibly injured or rattled, nor had he ever kept quiet to allow John to recuperate from emotional fatigue. What had changed? Why was Sherlock suddenly acting human? It can’t be due to John’s absence. Sherlock has made it known time and time again he loved his own company, infinitely preferring it to John’s. Was it because of John’s text? Texting was rare for them, save for the few
His mind drifts to thoughts of John, though these days, they never linger far. There’s an almost comfort in it now, in the way it settles in his bones, throughout his whole body, like it’s always lived there. He’s starting to suspect it has.
he feels to signify it’s been sent makes Sherlock feel the bizarre desire to erase himself from existence. Never, in his entire life, has he sincerely asked that question, let alone thought to. It’s a pointless question, a conversation starter really. It’s not something people mean. So what on earth compelled him to send such a text, and one that he found he meant?
“Then why on earth did we go through the hassle of speaking with Thomas and Helen and then whatever that mess we just experienced instead of sending Lestrade after him?” Sherlock fixes him with a pointed look, one that says
John glances up at Sherlock, then looks back to Helen, to the pale of her face, the shake of hands, of her whole body. He squeezes her hand to draw her attention. “Can I get you anything? A glass of water?”
“Right,” Sherlock says when the moment is close to being too much. He gathers his hands. “I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling peckish. Dinner?”
Sherlock takes a seat beside John. “Helen, do you have any idea why Edythe was in that particular building that day?”
“A body was discovered at the Heathrow Airport close to a week ago, and DNA revealed it to be Edythe Carter, aged 79 and evidently not the body they determined to be Edythe in 1960.”
, he would have thought John akin to an angel, what with the light that surrounded John like a halo. But, then again, it was
But now John had been gone for eight days. Eight days without his flatmate. Eight days without someone willing to be impressed by even the simplest of his deductions. Eight days without John and his music, his soft singing no longer filling the apartment, and the silence had begun to make Sherlock feel dreadfully lonely.
“As is the police allowing two citizens access to private information regarding crimes currently under investigation.”
“Well, I can see the sewing pins are put practically everywhere. That doesn’t seem like a logical thing to do if you’re trying to take a dress in.”
“No.” Ethan’s grip around John’s mouth loosens, his hand falling against his shoulder, the knife still pressed dangerously against his throat. “You killed her?”
Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s, lingering on him for longer than either would deem necessary. For those brief twenty seconds—brief in the grand scheme of things, of life, John would argue—time seemed to slow. Background noise washed away, the quiet lull of their stilted breathing and their quickening heartbeats taking over. John’s thoughts are replaced with nothing but
“But you said he’d correctly identified her.”
Once his father is seated, Ethan faces the two, spying Sherlock’s curious gaze as it flitters about the room. “We’re in the middle of sorting through his stuff,” he explains. “He was diagnosed with dementia a few years back, but these past few months have just gotten really bad… He’s really struggling, even with me basically living here again to help him. We’re moving him into a care facility so most of his stuff’s going to charity.”
“What? No, no no I can’t leave now,” John says, exasperated as he places a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to stop him from entering the vehicle. “My father needs me, Sherlock. I can’t just leave.”
Maybe one day, Sherlock thinks, he’ll reveal how John’s absence affected him; how it brought him to his knees and refused to release it’s tight grip on him. Maybe he’ll recite the moments and instances, regardless of how silly he deems them to be, that led him to discover the intensity of his feelings, and how he’d never before experienced emotions that somehow both set him on fire and provided him with comfort. But for now, in this moment, he settles for savouring the feel of John here, in front of him, more connected than they’ve ever been.
Too quiet.
“At the cemetery,” Ethan allows, his eyes fixed on Sherlock, the tone behind his words almost begging for Sherlock to slip up, to give him the opportunity to dig the knife in just that little bit deeper. “We were visiting Mum like we do each month, and Dad spies her a few plots over.”
“We were wondering what Edythe was like as a child.”
“Sherlock?” John’s eyebrows furrow at the unexpected sight of Sherlock, his gaze darting between the man before him and the house. The presence of Sherlock makes the familiarity of his childhood home suddenly feel empty and it almost overwhelms him. “What in the bloody hell are you doing here? Who’s car is that?”
“What happened to Agatha?”
“No. He wouldn’t do that. He loved her. She killed herself. I remember comin’ home from school and they were still documenting the scene.”
Before Sherlock could even open his mouth to say hello, he was greeted with the words, “There’s been a dead body found at the airport in an, uh...
“John's not here, Sherlock, remember?” Sherlock spins once more to see Lestrade strolling over, takeaway coffee clutched in his hand. “He had to go see his parents, remember? His father’s sick.”
“What? No. No, I know that already. How did she die 52 years ago?”
. All he knows is that he can’t move forward, physically or mentally, without knowing.
“Admittedly it did take me a while to notice, but then it was like a switch had flipped, because after then, I couldn’t stop noticing your absence. The flat’s so quiet without you there, without your singing. I know in the past it’s gotten to me, especially when I’m trying to concentrate, but then I had two weeks without it and that’s infinitely worse.”
“Oh, I forgot to mention one small thing.” There’s a flicker of a smile on Sherlock’s lips and a glint in his eye as he glances at John.  “Edythe died at the age of 27 in 1960.”
There’s the minutest of a nod, a reassurance as his breathing settles, and Sherlock feels his worry easing, if only fleetingly. His mind races as he runs through the scenarios that could take place, each second slipping by is a second closer to Ethan acting. He can’t lose John, not like this, not now, not ever. That would be a fate worse than death.
“Well… Are you okay?”
“Oh, hang on. I have it here somewhere.” The sound of paper rustling is audible through the line. “Aha! Found it. Right, it says she died when a building she was in collapsed in 1960. Body was identified by her fiancé and both her parents. They required multiple identifications due to the impact of the building.”
. But he’s trapped. His legs are unresponsive, feet stuck in place as though he’s glued to the ground.
It’s a simple
“Piecing together from what you’ve told us, about Agatha and Thomas, I think it’s possible that Edythe discovered your journal entry about Agatha and arranged to meet with her. And when the building collapsed, it was Agatha and not Edythe who got hit and crushed.” John pauses briefly, then hurries to continue, cursing himself for his word choices. “I think with them being twins, and the shock of the situation and the impact on her body, any of the notable differences you might’ve picked up on when identifying her, had the situation been different, were overlooked. The police received positive identification from three different people: you, your husband, and Thomas, and that seemed to be plenty for the case to be closed. I’ve looked through the police report, and they didn’t run any DNA tests or anything further.”
John shakes his head, a solemn look on his face as he recalls the images. He scrawls his number onto a blank piece of paper and hands it to Ethan. “If your father remembers anything else, anything at all, you can reach me on that number.”
“What?” Ethan’s focus faltered, the knife shifting away from John’s neck, but coming back forcefully—a warning for Sherlock to stay where he is. “What about my mother?”
“Sherlock, did you steal his car?”
And then he’d met John.
, John thinks, running his hand over the leather seat, noting the vehicle’s cleanliness and the way it exudes an obvious air of luxury. “And he just let you borrow it?”
“Should be. Just give ’im a minute. Quite a shock you gave him, telling him ’bout Edythe. I didn’t even know her and that shocked even me. I mean, it’s insane when you think about it,” Ethan rambles. “You think your fiancé’s dead for, what, more than fifty years? And then you find out she’s been alive this whole time?”
The flat is dismally quiet when Sherlock returns home at 4 am. How it escaped him for such a length of time that John’s presence was gone, Sherlock is unsure. The flat has a bizarre feel of abandonment to it—and if Sherlock were to pay more attention to his emotions, he would sense that same aura of abandonment radiating off himself in waves.
“That’s what I’m trying to figure out.”
Strangers pass by their table, their own conversations filling in the comfortable lull that’s settled over the pair. They spend the next little while sharing a meal and communicating with unabashed smiles that convey what they’re still a little scared to admit aloud just yet. But maybe, just maybe, their time spent apart and everything that lead to this moment will give them the courage to be a little brave; to say what they’ve kept buried, what they’ve tried to hide from everyone, including themselves.
“They– They came ’round again, saying they had some more questions for you, then this one,” he says, jutting his chin in the direction of Sherlock, “started spouting off about my leg and showing off that picture of Mum in her wedding dress, which I
John’s laugh in response startles Sherlock—he finds it peculiar given the heated situation from just moments prior, especially when John flips the question around on him. “Are you?”
(Perhaps, if Sherlock was less robotic, more…
“Helen,” Sherlock broaches cautiously, like approaching a wounded animal. “I’ve noticed your gaze keeps going back to the photo of your husband, William. You don’t have to hide behind him anymore, to be scared of his controlling ways. Whatever it is, you can tell us. We just want to find out what happened to your daughter, to Edythe, and we can’t do that without you.”
Helen swallows thickly and dabs at the tears brimming her eyes. “Uh, physically, mostly, but he also made it so she could hardly be alone without him. She said he threatened to kill her if she ever tried to leave him.”
“What?” John’s brow furrows, confusion clouding his mind. “Aside from her head, she looks fine.”
“She never really formed close bonds with people, at least as a child, and I don’t think she’d ever had a boyfriend until she met Thomas. Even then, she seemed closed off; always so quiet. Such a contrast to when she was a baby. She would always cry or scream or just sit in her crib, babbling away. She was always constantly waking Agatha up…” There’s a heaviness to her shoulders, the exhaustion of the case weighing her down, unknowingly drawing her guard down. “She kept her personal life private, hardly ever speaking of any issues. Though, there was this one moment, one of the last times I ever saw her, where she’d come to me and insisted that Thomas was abusing her…”
And when he feels John’s thumb brush against his cheek and rest there, gentle and wholly natural, he thinks that maybe this kiss is revealing it for him.
“52 years ago? That’s impossible. She’d only been dead a matter of days when she was found. Anderson ran the tests, correct?” Sherlock doesn’t wait for a response, eager for any opportunity to insult Anderson. “I’ve been telling you to fire that imbecile for years.”
“Yes. We need to find out whether he knew she was alive.”
investigating the bloody decay rates of limbs in different temperatures.”
Sherlock smiled.
for just a moment... I’ve seen you spend
“Well?” he huffs out, glaring at the wall, imagining Lestrade’s face there. “What is it?”
“Son…”
“How could you? How could you take her away from me? I was eight! A child!”
“Yes, Sherlock, I’m aware of the basics of driving. So, you’re telling me all this time we could’ve had a car of our own?”
“You’ve got the address?”
“That’s besides the bloody point, Sherlock! It’s still against the law!”
speaking to the empty apartment he’d thought John’s presence had been occupying.
John nods solemnly. “We’re truly sorry for the loss you’re going through, again. Let us know at any point if you need a break or want to stop, okay?”
way. Definitely your kind of case.”
“Oh, right. Well, I received a call from Lestrade the other night, saying they’d found a dead body in an unattended suitcase at the airport’s baggage carousel.” Sherlock pulls his phone from his inner coat pocket and opens the Photos app, pulling up a picture of Edythe in the oversized wedding dress before passing the device to John. He half-expects John to chastise him for using his phone while driving.
“I hate to admit it, but I kind of was.” John licks his lips, his gaze lingering on Sherlock’s profile and the way the light through the window enhances his lashes, before he catches himself and rushes to change the subject. “So, who’s car is this?”
and switches his device off. This is a good thing, if he thinks about it. He can’t afford any more distractions. He has a case to solve and if there’s a heaviness in his chest after reading that message… Well, that’ll have to wait to be examined once he’s uncovered the truth behind the lady in the suitcase.
An irrational need to step in, to protect John, almost overtakes Sherlock, but something about the ice radiating from both siblings keeps his feet in place.
“Ethan?” A weak, gravelly voice calls from behind him, a head peering out, eyes squinting against the light. “You’re letting all the heat out. Who are you talking to?”
Sherlock hums in agreement. “That’s my hypothesis, too. I think we should talk to Thomas again. Maybe if we’re lucky, he’ll divulge about the abuse or if he knew about Agatha or any plan to escape.”
Sherlock starts the car without another word and John appreciates it. He needs a moment, just one, to catch his thoughts, to analyse that interaction. It was odd. Just so… different.
“I don’t trust him,” John says, a different chill running up his spine.
Sherlock notes the way John’s jaw tenses, his knuckles turning white with repeated clenching. “You know it wasn’t like that, Harry.”
“Better, thank you. I’d, uh, never told anyone about it—I’d been too embarrassed of how weak I was…
Sherlock hums to indicate he’s right. “I apologise for not checking in with you sooner. To be honest, I didn’t even notice your absence for the first five days until Lestrade brought it up.” Sherlock briefly wonders whether John can sense the silent
“You were still in shock, faced with the most horrible situation any parent could find themselves in. You can’t blame yourself.” John lets the moment settle before shifting the conversation. “I think that given all you’ve just gone through, it’d be best if we stopped, gave you time to rest and adjust. Do you have anyone we can call for you? A friend, a family member? I don’t think it’s best for you to be alone after learning all this.”
“Oh,” John scoffs, an edge of annoyance creeping into his tone, “cause that makes it better.”
Sherlock nods, his mind turning at all the pieces of information forming links. He takes a moment to allow John to absorb the information. “Just before, you mentioned someone, an Agatha. Who was she?”
Thomas leans into his son, Ethan’s arm coming around to support his weight. “Who was it? Oh, God, it wasn’t Lydia, was it?”
“It’s so lovely to hear the sound of music in this flat again,” she comments, her hand coming to rest against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock adds another tally to his mental list of times Mrs Hudson has made that remark in the past two days (this instance makes six), and then as if she’s trying to add salt to his wounds, she adds, “It’s such a nice change from all that dreadful silence.”
He enters the kitchen and returns almost immediately, handing his father the tablets and ensuring he swallows them. He announces to John and Sherlock that it’s time for his father to lie down, helping him to his feet and leading him with a steady arm to a room across the hall.
