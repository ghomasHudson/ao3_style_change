It didn’t even matter that he’d started with good intentions. As usual, Tony had gone ahead and steamrolled right over Steve’s wishes, been too high-handed, too overbearing, too
“...and that’s why I can’t bring strawberries into the office anymore.” Stark finished his rant with a disgusted scoff. He nudged his knee against Steve’s, like he expected Steve to know what he was talking about. “Unbelievable, right?”
With every sentence she flicked through news articles and press photos. Stark sipping drinks at a gala, giving a presentation on stage, cutting a ribbon at a charity ball, throwing a party in Vegas.
Steve belatedly wonders if he's made another blunder, but Tony isn't castigating him over invasion of personal space or making any move to shove him away.
Now, they’re battling twenty projections in a high-ceilinged elevator lobby. The battle had made a wreck of the place, leaving burns and gouges in the walls, strewing debris across the marble floor.
None of them had asked for this. Sam blamed himself too, for not being around on that day. But he’d stuck with Steve through the worst of it, providing a steady presence in those dark days immediately following the Incident. He'd let Steve stay at his place all this while though surely he had to be fed up with Steve’s drama by now.
Natasha pulled up a family photo of the Starks. It looked like it came from private family album, and had probably been one of the last photos taken together, because Tony looked like he couldn't have been older than twenty.
“And what? You’ll buy me dinner?” Tony wriggles in his grasp, trying to buck Steve off, but he may as well be trying to push a tank for all the use it does him. Efforts fruitless, he glowers at Steve, quiet fury radiating off him. “Okay. Now you're starting to piss me off.”
Then… a glint where the sun reflects off the lenses of a ski mask and Steve knows with a chill that they’ve been seen.
“Stop,” A few swipes of his pen and Steve was done with the maze in ten seconds. “Not good enough. Try again.”
Scott’s mouth was hanging open at the massive overload of information. “Where do we even begin unpack all this… we’ve got the distant parents, the ex-girlfriend, the sleazy business partner, international kidnapping...” He shook his head in disbelief. “I've seen soap operas less complicated than this.”
As the projection staggers back, Steve retrieves the shield and strikes a blow so hard it tears the creature in two. The metal body collapses with a clatter at Stark’s feet.
“Steve?” Bucky’s voice was barely above a whisper. His grey eyes were strangely blank, searching the ceiling as if trying to part the layers of plaster for something beyond human sight.
“Not as much as he loved his legacy.” Stark leans against the pipe, letting his head drop back against the rusted surface. “Nothing could make him stop talking about it. The old man wanted to live forever, if he could.”
Sam and Natasha were already at the table. Over mugs of coffee and juice, they were engaged in a silent exchange of Meaningful Looks, probably debating which of them would have the daunting task of Having The Talk with Steve.
Watching the work take form under his hands, Steve can't help but be impressed by his skill, for Tony worked with a speed that would surely be impossible in the real world. His movements, fluid and certain, reminded him of Wanda’s magic but applied to engineering instead of buildings.
“Then we’ll have to be better.” Steve looked at the ceiling. A dark impulse seized him and he said “Besides, I know you can complete the mission if anything happens to me.”
The both of them work well together, seamlessly covering each others’ blind spots. Sure, Tony isn’t as perfectly coordinated as Sam or Natasha, but he had picked up the basics of combat surprisingly fast, always there to fire off cannon blasts and quips, and there's something electrifying and
"I've learned a lot about you, Captain. Following your honorable discharge, you became one of the best architects in the business. You and your team were very well-regarded in the underground network of dream infiltration. Until five years ago, that is. Your team fell apart and you abandoned designing completely.” T’Challa leaned forward slightly in his seat, gaze fixed on Steve intently. “You must have had strong reason for that decision."
“...Partly. That’s why we use totems to help us tell whether we’re in a dream or reality. But I’ll explain that another time.”
“You always have a choice.” Sam said kindly. “You don't have to do it for us, or T'Challa, or even…” He was cut off as Steve set his plate down with a clunk.
“It's called a flash mob, they're supposed to be fun and spontaneous-” Tony explained, already starting to deflate. How could he have been so stupid? Nothing he'd planned had turned out right, and all Tony had done was confuse and inconvenience Steve...
“Hey, Natasha,” Sam wrapped an arm around her in greeting. “Is that one of your ‘authentic’ Russian phrases? Cause we caught on to your bullshitting years ago.”
“Guh?” Tony goggled. He felt like all the brain cells he needed for language had died and gone to wherever brain cells went to when they died.
Nakia sat on the edge of the bed, watching him pensively. “If the situation is already that dire, perhaps a more permanent course of action…?” Her words trailed off but he knew what he knew what she was implying.
Steve can see the exact moment Stark realises it’s a kidnapping, because the dark-haired man springs into action before Steve can get close, throwing a hard right hook towards Steve’s nose. Simple enough to counter; Steve catches the punch easily and drags Stark forward by the fist, using the momentum to throw off Stark’s centre of gravity. He feints a palm strike, and when Stark shies away, traps the shorter man in a rear headlock.
Steve muses while connecting the IV to his arm. Until now, the possibility of returning to Limbo had been his only fear.
“I know you can,” Steve puts an hand on Tony’s shoulder to stop him from blowing up the whole floor. “Save what you have for the party.”
As much as Sam complained about messy housemates cluttering up his house with their belongings, he'd never said a word about tossing out Bucky’s things.
T’Challa raised his voice slightly to reach Steve’s ears. “It’s strange to me that a man who steals for a living would so suddenly develop a conscience.”
“Whoa, I really gotta adjust the power on the thrusters,” he clambers to his feet and lurches back to the bench. “That was only 10%, definitely way too much kickback…”
“It's what I was made for.” Tony withdrew his shutters back with a quick flourish, flashing a teasing glimpse of his bulb. “You like?”
They hadn’t even started digging into Stark’s life yet, but it felt intensely wrong to stand here watching the man going through a mental breakdown. Steve never knew the right things to say in these types of situations.
“Just stay close to me and don’t do anything reckless.” Steve says, feeling like his day just got more complicated.
“So, tell me if I've got this right,” Wanda asked, flicking a lock of dark hair over her shoulder.  “How does designing a dream create a new reality?”
Steve’s hands cupped his jaw and tipped his face up. Tony blinked, surprised to see that the blue eyes were full of affection rather than annoyance.
The noises of construction cease. Tony looks at him sharply and Steve can see the wheels in his head turning, searching his words for some hidden trap. “What did you do?”
“I'm hoping it won't come to that. This is the one mission I can't afford to fail,” Steve down at his cup. “It’s the only way I can move past this.”
T’Challa is gazing out into the hazy street. “We’re not alone,” His breath puffs out in clouds against the frost-streaked window. And then Steve hears it too; a rumble in the ground, too consistent to be thunder.
“This situation is fundamentally different; we're trying to discourage Stark from a course of action, not radicalize him.” Nakia pressed on. “I can get a group of our best operatives to start researching..."
Tony cursed and began putting on his clothes at a faster pace. As he buttoned up his vest, he snuck a glance at Steve, who was busy writing a text while waiting for Tony to get dressed.
It had started innocently at first, where they'd experimented with impossible buildings. That turned into multiple dream levels, manipulating the time and space of each reality, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
Dropping the dramatic attitude, Tony reverts his normal voice. “I’m trying to protect the people i put in harm’s way. When I was in Afg-” He bites back his words, then continues, voice flat and subdued, words sounding almost rehearsed. “I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.” His eyes take on a fervent gleam. “No more.”
the sole focus of all Tony’s energy is different from seeing it on screen: all Tony had done was flirt outrageously and dive into trouble, unconcerned with Steve’s efforts to rescue his ungrateful - but extremely well-formed - backside.
Steve’s tone was ambivalent. “It was a little unexpected, waking up to a swing band serenading me from the street-”
They'd held hands when they leapt from the train. The freefall into the freezing canyon seemed to last an eternity, ears filling with the icy roar of the wind, not knowing which direction was up or down, desperately hoping there wasn’t a sickening crunch waiting for them at the bottom
Tony felt himself growing hot again. All this while he’d thought he was the only one pining after Steve, but oh, how the tables had turned “I bet you say that to all the other lamps.”
His breath is coming fast and heavy, like he’s run a marathon. They got what they came for; getting a numerical code from the target is their success indicator for this leg of the mission, but he feels empty and vaguely sick - nothing at all like a winner. The fallen skull face grins back at him mockingly.
“True, but expensive doesn't mean better. We'd be better off with someone doesn’t have an agenda.” Steve took a bite of his food. “Can't go wrong with some youthful zest.”
Why would you do that to someone you care about?” His words choked off at the end like he was on the verge of tears. “We're all alone here, sugarbear.”
“Obie! What did they do?” Stark pulls himself towards Natasha as far his his bonds will let him. “God, they really did a number on you.”
Nakia, Natasha’s contact, was a slender woman garbed elegantly in Wakandan fashion. Her hair was styled in knots, the tips dyed a trendy shade of maroon. She met them in the lobby of a luxury hotel, the kind of place Steve might have designed in another life.
“It’s the middle of the night,” Scott lifted his head from where it rested on a stack of documents. “And the mission isn’t for another few weeks. What happened?”
“Ah… oh yes, you were a sorry sight in that cell. Lucky I was able to get you out.” For a whole second, Natasha blanks on her response. And that was odd, usually she never missed a thing in her research.
5. As you can see, I'm playing fast and loose with Inception canon, and the next few chapters will diverge even more. Schmoopy stuff is coming...
He’d first met Natasha in a figure drawing class. One of the other artists wouldn't stop badgering her, leering and making comments about what he’d like to do to parts of her anatomy. He’d gotten bold enough to paw at her leg and Steve had been about to bodily drag him out of the studio until Natasha put the creeper's head through his own canvas. Things had… devolved after that.
He was also very tactile; Stark talked with his hands, frequently touching Steve on the shoulder or arm to emphasise some point or other. Talking seemed to have a positive effect and at least he was less teary than before. It was hard to get a word in edgewise; the most Steve could was do nod, comment occasionally, or make sounds at the right places. Stark didn’t seem to mind, and Steve found he didn't mind the chatter either.
Steve seemed to realise at the same time he'd be constantly looking up Tony’s shade, because he gave an awkward wobble. “Um. You're very. Bright.”
“Seven… six… ” Steve presses on, trying his best to ignore the chatter. It’s distracting, the way Stark throws so many words around.
“Once I've made contact with Stark, we'll meet you there directly.” The bridge from South to North Tower was several floors down from him. He'd get Stark to the access point and - if they were lucky - manage to avoid any altercations with enemies. In and out. Simple.
The formerly empty streets were now lined by ranks of armored robots. Shaped like a heavyset human, each robot was at least eight feet high, clad in dark grey armor and bristling with guns. The only thing more intimidating than those shoulder-mounted cannons were the faces; every faceplate was engraved with the same sinister expression, cold blue lights glinting out from the slanted eye sockets.
A broad, perfectly round surface, balanced on shapely legs. Strong lines enhanced the dense applewood grain, the rich colour free of knots and imperfections. The rim of the tabletop shimmered where a delicate pattern of scrollwork and stars was picked out with mother-of-pearl inlay. Every inch of the table gleamed with varnish, the kind of coat that indicated Steve was built to last.
“What? No, that’s not her fault, I'd better talk to her...” Steve heads for the door but Natasha’s chilly tone freezes him in his tracks.
“That’s the point. It's called interrogate, not in-having-fun-gate.” She steps up to Steve and taps a spot on her cheek. “Now, I was gonna get Sam to help with this part, but since that anything that goes wrong from this point on is probably your fault - how about you do the honors?”
Tony gives him the finger without even turning round. “Worry about yourself, I'll take my own chances.”
Reluctantly shoving down the post-fight high, Steve pulls out the scanner. Based on the map, they’re only a few hundred meters from the access point.
Hoping he looks less threatening now, Steve plunges into his next lie. “Something like that. You can trust me, I’m your mind’s first line of defense.”
“Whoa, whoa, hold up.” The click of the gun spurs Stark into action and he schools his expression into something reasonable. “Why don’t we all calm down and try work something out.” He doesn't even break a sweat at shifting gears into businessman mode, cannily trying to move things to a playing field he knows. “What do you want, Bones? Money? New tech? Plastic surgery for that unfortunate countenance of yours?”
Wanda looked thoughtful instead of running for the hills, so he supposed that was a good sign. “Is that why you said it’s dangerous to forget the difference between dreams and reality…?”
“Tony has a heart condition.” said Natasha. “Every few months he checks into a private hospital for a medical procedure. The next one’s due in 2 weeks, which puts us right on schedule with T’Challa’s deadline.”
“You're too easy to wind up.” Stark laughs, clapping Steve on the shoulder. “At ease, Wonder Bread, I'm just messing with you.”
"You're right, my country has the best medical technicians in the world. I will put all of our resources at your disposal that your friend may be cured.” T’Challa inclined his head slightly. “You have my word.”
“If this is a shakedown, you amateurs are doing it wrong,” Stark drawls as Steve enters. His cuffed hands tug at the bolt, trying in vain to free himself. “When Rushman gets here, get ready to be sued so hard that you'll be lucky to-”
Encouraged by the praise, Tony lowered his balls once again. They grazed against Steve’s surface with a soft click - Steve gave another creak of a shudder - before starting to trail over the glossy tabletop
Sam paused, opened his mouth, and closed it again. Steve knew what the words on his tongue were, they've had this conversation so many times he knows it by heart.
“The Stark family inheritance, of course! Wasn’t there something your dad wanted you to have? Didn’t his will mention some kind of asset that would pass to you?” Stane wheedles. “As his only child, he'd be so proud for you to carry on his legacy.”
Sam gaped at him. "You’re kidding, right? That's barely enough time for a regular infiltration, let alone an inception. Just the research alone would take-"
The nights were getting colder, and their breaths puffed out in clouds. Even Steve’s sturdy constitution wasn't enough to fully resist the chill in the air; it’d be a few short weeks until winter was in full swing. He glanced over at Stark. The other man had pulled his coat tightly around him, shivering slightly but his thoughts seemed elsewhere.
“You could say that.” Steve paused at the doorway. “But there are some lines I won't cross.” Not anymore.
“Don’t you know what happens when you overheat? I don’t want you to burst like the last time!” Steve was pissed. “You can’t keep putting yourself into danger like this! The Owner might think you’re faulty and have you thrown out.”
Although, there seemed to be something different about this table. Tony swung himself a little closer to get a better look. Upon closer inspection, Steve’s simple appearance was more than it seemed:
1. Everyone's current ages in this AU are as follows: Steve (32 IRL with beard, looks 27 in dream world with no beard), Tony (46), Natasha (32), Sam (38), T'Challa (33-35), Bucky (33), Wanda (21), Scott (40)
But he can't afford to fall apart now, not when he has a mission to do, and he shoves down the part of him that wonders if he’s being selfish, that quails at the prospect of returning to that dark Not-Place.
T’Challa shifted in his chair under the weight of five incredulous gazes, looking sheepish for the first time since Steve had met him. “It seemed neater."
But Steve hadn't noticed - he'd been too busy trying to readapt to a mortal plane of existence, that he blithely assumed that Bucky would be able to make the same adjustments.
"I know this is rather sudden, which is why I’m prepared to offer an advance. You'll find that it’s a more than generous." T’Challa gestured to one of his bodyguards, who slid over a check for a sum of money so outrageous that even Natasha raised an eyebrow. “And the other half upon successful completion.”
It was night time and they were seated at one of the study areas surrounding the quad. Everything was quiet except for the distant boom of music from an event going on at a different part of the school. To anyone passing by it looked like a regular tutoring session between a college student and a TA.
The scene is uncanny, like something out of a movie; the front carriage of a freight train is blocking the entire corridor as if a giant had picked it up and rammed it through the building. The impact had destroyed all of the light fixtures, leaving the hallway lit by flashes of red emergency lighting.
“This is great, but all our plans mean squat if we can’t get the guy alone.” Sam said. “He’s pretty much surrounded by bodyguards 24/7.”
Stark took a few steps closer, brown eyes roving over Steve’s face. “I don't know why, but I can't get a read on you,” It sounded like he was talking more to himself than Steve. “That never happens… I wonder why that is.”
T’Challa’s face had turned stern, closed off. "My reasons are my own. And unless it's your policy to interrogate your clients so, I'll be the one conducting this interview."
The garbage truck had moved on and now the street was completely silent. Stark’s watch was sitting on his desk where he had placed it the other day. He picked it up - the watch sat heavy in his hand, and was so finely made that the mechanism didn't even make a sound as the hands ticked the seconds away.
Scott perked up from his slouched position on the couch. “I've been synthesizing a new sedative that can sustain multiple levels of dreams while leaving inner ear function intact.” He shivered “Wouldn’t want to go too deep without giving ourselves a way out.”
Tony takes out the power core and starts disassembling it. “Imagine every battle won before it begins. ULTRON can neutralize threats before they even materialize - identify the threat down to blood type, political affiliation, favorite TV show-”
Steve roughly cuffs Natasha to the pipe next to Stark then leaves swiftly, slamming the door behind him. There’s a one-way mirror panel just next to the cell, where they can all observe her.
With Steve as the Extractor of their two-man team and Sam running point, they’d had to hire freelance Architects every time they took a job. Vanko...as it turned out, had been deliberately planted by Hammer. The moment Steve cracked the safe, Vanko had stolen the documents out of his hands and run straight to Hammer. The smarmy little man was now refusing to pay up, even having to the gall to claim ignorance of the whole matter.
Breathing heavily, Steve touches his fingers to Stark’s neck once more - the return of a pulse sends a surge of relief coursing through him.
She flicked through a series of images: a blurry photo of Stane talking to soldiers, Stane getting into a car with a bearded man in sunglasses (“That man is on several government watchlists.” Nakia murmured). The last photo showed Stane and Stark having a conversation at one of the factories - Stane standing a little too close, large hands draped on Stark’s shoulders.
“Room to breathe, that's funny. How it’s the simple things you take for granted, that you don’t need to think about, until you do…” Stark’s breathing started to speed up again and his hand drifted to his sternum almost unconsciously.
“As experts, wouldn’t you be able to keep these variables under control?” T’Challa commented, steepling his fingers on the table. “Unless you admit this task is beyond your ability.”
T’Challa was younger than Steve had guessed; the young king was handsome-featured, with close cropped hair and a neat beard. He was wearing a long black tunic with silver detailing at the collar and cuffs. His dark eyes, large and thoughtful, met Steve’s with a commanding gaze. His chair was flanked by two female bodyguards, both attired in red body armour and carrying formidable-looking spears.
“Or a useful tool we can use against a powerful enemy. As you said, we are running out of time,” Nakia said. “This way there need not be any blood spilt.”
It was only after FRIDAY had gotten off the phone with the caterers, the dance troupes, the New York Philharmonic, the pyrotechnics company, and the animal wranglers did Tony start to wonder whether he'd gone too far.
“They couldn’t get through to me so they started on Pepper. Poor woman, they’ve been torturing her for days…” Natasha-as-Stane laments. “You’ve got to give them what they want or they won’t stop…”
“You said you're a manifestation of my subconscious, which means you're a reflection of some aspect of me, I guess. ” Tony smirks ruefully. “And judging by the All-American apple pie appearance - probably the part that still believes in truth, optimism and the inherent goodness of mankind.”
“Thanks, I wanted to have fun and not just make a Generic McCitysville.” Wanda tilts her head to give him an appraising look. “Hm.”
“I've never never met an antique before, either.” As Tony stretched his wires to the limit, he caught sight of his reflection in Steve’s satiny surface. The image gave him a jolt, because it was a angle few got a chance to see: straight up the base of his closely-furled lampshade, through the gap where his pull string dangled out of, giving an unadulterated view of where his glowing core was nestled.
inferior weapon.” Tony spins around, zapping a robot which had been sneaking up on Steve. “Mark 2 and I are Team Innovation, so you and your King Arthur cosplay better step it up.”
Nakia smiled and lifted one hand to cup the side of T’Challa’s face. He wrapped a hand around her fingers, turning his head to kiss her palm.
Tony grew warm. The view was indecent, and yet the prospect of constantly being on display was simply electrifying. It was what he was made for, after all: to be looked at. The fact that Steve was the best-looking table he'd ever seen was even better.
“Is that so?” Business-like as ever, Nakia began running through a list of solutions. “We can settle this the corporate way; absorb his company into WDG and shut the project down internally.”
“Waste not. It’s not like this buckethead is gonna need it anymore-” and Tony launches into a searing critique of the projection’s many design flaws and how much better it would have functioned if he had built it.
“Are you kidding me?” Panting from the run, Tony’s breath puffs out in clouds as he gazes transfixed at the train. As before, the carriage is covered by a sheen of frost - so cold that it could sear all the feeling out of human skin.
“Are you saying that Stark is involved criminal activity?” T’Challa had gone still at the sight of the images.
“We should've known a piece of shit like Hammer was gonna screw us over.” Sam said with a grimace (“Language,” said Steve). “If he spent on actual R&D instead of stealing from his competitors, his company might not be in the shitter in the first place.”
“We could tell him to stick it to the old man by tearing everything down,” Scott offered. “They hated each other, so let's go with the daddy issues.”
Steve hesitates. “The day I met Wanda, I also ran into Stark. He was at the college for some event.”
Steve looked at the only two friends he had left in the world and quietly crushed the lingering remnants of self-doubt. “Guess I have nothing to worry about. We're doing this.”
“I’m not asking you to go with me.” Steve said. “This is my mess to clean up. I’ll do this with or without you.”
Wanda's brow furrowed in concentration as she furiously sketched attempt after attempt, all of which Steve solved easily. It wasn’t like she was doing a bad job - she’d grasped the concepts faster than most people had, and Steve noticed that she kept getting closer with every new attempt - but she hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it yet.
“I don’t think that’s any of your business.” Steve snaps. He regrets it immediately because Tony’s face goes wide and hurt, before closing off again, stung by his curt tone.
“Cool down, Tony, it's not a big deal. I think my weird lamp adds a bit of character to the house.” Steve smiled, looping an arm around his waist to draw him back to bed.
After what felt like a long time, the retching stopped. Stark’s head remained hanging down, a pained whine escaping his lips. He started to sway but Steve quickly caught him by the arm before he could pitch forward into his own sick. Steve wrapped an arm around his waist for support, walked him away from the tree and sat him down on one the benches surrounding the quad.
The aluminium tower crumples in a scream of metal. The recoil sends Tony flying back, and he fetches up against Steve, who catches him before he can tumble any further.
Steve's grip on the jamb tightened so fast that it crunched a deep gouge into the wood. The two bodyguards tensed into fighting stances but T’Challa didn't even bat an eye.
“Sure you aren't, and Uncle Sam doesn't piss red, white, and blue.” Tony puts his hands on his hips, drawing himself up as much as he can, despite Steve having several inches and sixty-odd pounds on him. “So, what are you fighting for? Whales, world peace, the right to wear spangly underwear…?”
Natasha tosses something red at him: a cheap Halloween mask emblazoned with a grinning skull. Steve looks at her incredulously. “This is your idea of stealthy?”
Steve felt his hackles rise at the mention of Bucky’s full name, and in that moment he was truly angry at T’Challa for backing him into a corner with such a calculated move.
That is, unless Tony unplugged himself from the ceiling… Tony jiggled in his socket, giving his screws a few experimental twists. Falling for Steve would be literal death for him, and yet what a glorious end. In some way, Tony felt like he had fallen for Steve long ago.
Steve didn’t talk to him much after that. Despite Tony’s repeated to lighten the mood, Steve’s exchanges with him had been brief and stilted.
“Maybe, but it’s not your problem.” Steve makes a show of fiddling with the PASIV, hoping it would throw her off.
. Wandering off alone, unarmed, through a building infested with eight-foot tall metal robots falls firmly into the latter.
A woman’s tortured scream pierces through the walls. Steve tenses in shock, before realizing it had come from Natasha. Her face was impassive, fully focused on playing the role of Stane, but it was her voice too that came from outside the room, that of a terrified woman who begged and screamed against invisible captors.
Tony pushes himself off the wall. “Can't argue with that. Speaking of which, I’m gonna need a weapon, too.”
“Good news travels fast, I see.” Steve shoved his hands into the pockets of his brown jacket. The leather was worn butter smooth from years of wear, just enough to keep out the bite in the air.
“Uh, not being born yesterday, that’s for sure.” Stark shifts restlessly in his seat and the handcuff clinks against his watch. “You really think I’m so gullible that I'd believe a single word that comes out of your mouth?”
Tony took in Steve’s gleaming profile again, and twinkled appreciatively. He had been turned on his whole life, but he'd never felt so
Stark made a derisive sound. “Yeah, give them a front row seat to your bullshit, why don't you? Inflict the knowledge that you're
He’d always had good instincts, and his father had taught him well; how to read the swirls and eddies of power like the signs before a storm.
Sam sighed and finished off the last of his coffee. “I’ve always got your back, Steve. We all do.” Sam turned to leave the kitchen, but stopped in the doorway to look over his shoulder. “But you can’t keep doing this lone wolf thing forever. You’re gonna have to face up to yourself eventually. Just hope you know that.” His footsteps receded, and Steve heard the sound of a door shutting firmly.
Stark hunched forward, hands resting on his knees. “Totally hypothetical here, but if you knew this year was the last birthday you were going to have, what would you do?” He pitched his voice to sound casual but there was an odd tone to it.
It’s out of pure practicality - if Tony has a way to defend himself then it makes Steve’s job of protecting him a hell of a lot easier. Tony’s unfairly expressive eyes have nothing to do with it.
“Yeah, a special kind of stupid-” Tony began, but he quietened as Steve brushed a thumb over his lower lip.
“Three…” Steve feels sweat beading on the back of his collar. Shit, this could go south really fast.
. Steve thumbed the pages idly, smiling slightly at the colourful costumes and overly complicated booby traps.
Steve’s knuckles were still tingling as he and Sam left the Hammer Industries complex. He always felt grimy after a meeting with Justin Hammer. The man was as slimy as a slug and just as spineless.
Scott and Wanda fell into sync comfortably alongside Sam and Natasha, and in no time it felt as if they’d all been working together for years. The next few weeks passed swiftly as plans for the inception materialized.
“I heard about that job. We could definitely use a guy with his chemistry skills.” Steve started adding fruit to his oatmeal. "We’re gonna need a new architect as well."
Tony continues, this time securing something around his forearm. “I’ve been working on ULTRON for years - had trouble finishing because I’d always run up against the same roadblock.” His smile goes rigid. “Till a while ago, that is - I finally got the right push. Had a real come-to-Jesus moment.”
Sam’s place was the nicest, so they tended to crash there on long jobs. To Sam’s dismay, his three colleagues brought their clutter with them, which only accumulated as the years went by. Steve’s motorcycle magazines found a place next to Sam’s record collection, while the coffee table was piled high with Natasha’s knitting projects and Bucky’s comic books.
I’ll try to post the next one before Infinity War comes out but I’m not too worried if I can’t because I don't forsee any huge changes in canon that will derail my fic (what’s the worst they can do? kill someone? like that’s stopped anyone writing stuff)
The contact made Tony flicker. Against his balls, the wood felt like nothing he had ever felt before. To Tony, a creature of science and technology, it was a sensation both alien and thrilling: he could sense the echo of preserved organic life beneath the coat of varnish, the whisper of the tree Steve once was, ripened by age and made beautiful by craft.
“Beautiful. Your shutters are gorgeous. I've never seen you so open before.” Steve regarded him admiringly. He would give an arm and a leg to see TOny like this all the time.
Blinking in confusion, Tony closed his shutters, wrapping them around his redly-glowing bulb a little tighter. Pissing Steve off hadn't been his intent. He hoped he hadn't blown his first impression.
“The Point is the second in command, making sure everything and everyone is where they should be. And the Extractor - that's my role - deals with the target directly, getting them to trust me so we can extract the information we need.” Steve continued.
"Look, you've been through so much shit without complaining and you deserve so much, all the nice things in the world.” Tony said.
“Hang on guys, we’re almost at the bridge! Just a few blocks left!” Scott cries, and sure enough the helix bridge rises into view as their little van races towards the edge of the city.
Steve tucked him against his chest, settling them both under the sheets. “It was my grandfather’s, he had it way back in the 30s.”
“And I like when people aren’t handicapping themselves with crappy tools. Just wait until your frisbee gets stuck up a tree and you’re surrounded by bad guys who want to kick your-”
Sam watched him levelly, taking a swig of coffee. “I notice you haven't told the others about Bucky,” He said. “Scott and Wanda don’t know, and now T’Challa wants to come along too…”
They’re close, far too close now; it's impossible not to notice how Stark’s pupils are fully dilated against the brown irises, and the way a bead of sweat traces a line from temple to cheekbone. There’s a purplish bruise forming beneath one eye and a crimson scratch on the edge of his jaw - had he been jostled that badly in the turbulent ride through the city? Stark’s chest is beginning to heave as his breaths pant through slightly parted lips, in and out, faster and faster…
T’Challa gave her shoulder a squeeze. “He’d understand. I wouldn’t ask a subject to do anything I wouldn't be willing to do myself.”
Owner’s Companion let out a moan, a drip of his fluid starting to trickle precariously towards Steve’s surface.
Having apparently decided Steve was no longer a threat, Tony crouches down to examine the still-glowing power core of the dismembered projection.
“Way to for the jugular there, Nat.” Steve didn’t look up from the stove. So they really were going to address the elephant in the room. His spatula knocked against a yolk too hard and it broke, flooding the pan with its yellow guts. Dammit.
There didn't seem to be a way to pick up the conversation after that so they continue in silence, Tony working on his gauntlet with Steve keeping lookout.
This probably meant Steve didn't get to eat the breakfast prepared by the Michelin-starred chef. Tony kicked himself.
“That's what I like to hear,” Natasha grinned. “As a wise captain once said: let’s get down to business.”
Almost. There’s something else hidden in beneath the idealistic spiel. No, this wasn't just about politics - Steve can sense something personal buried beneath.
The street was deserted, still except for a dog barking in the distance, and the clatter of a garbage truck on the street below. The grind of the metal compactor seemed too loud - an echo of train wheels - and he couldn’t resist a shudder.
There had been two days which Steve could, without question, classify as the worst two days of his life. The first time happened when he was abroad with his platoon; the news of his mother’s passing was more devastating than any mortar round.
“All clear for the moment,” Sam’s winged form swoops down the avenue of skyscrapers, briefly casting a shadow over their car. The winged jetpack is Sam’s equipment of choice for dream walking, letting him scope out the lay of the land. “I've already located Stark. He's headed out of an office five blocks from here.”
The intensity of the moment charges the air between them and Steve can’t help how his body has started to angle closer, looming over the other man. They’re barely three feet apart, so close that he can see every cut, smudge, and scrape on Stark’s face.
The wall of smog at end of the street darkens, and then the iron legion bursts through the fog, heavy bootsteps echoing off the buildings as they advance on the van.
“That’s it.” Tony glared at the flickering light coming through from under the door and shot up to sitting position, pooling the sheets around his hips.“That damn lamp is acting up again. I’m gonna rip it out and trash it myself.”
Based on the types of weddings Tony had attended, ‘simple’ could mean just two private islands instead of four. That was what people did, right?
Steve knows, with bloody-knuckled conviction, how it's like to push back extra hard, so nobody looks too hard at the cracks.
“Steve? Here's the maze you asked for.” Wanda hesitantly crept up behind him. Steve quickly stuffed the watch in his pocket as she held out her sketchpad. “Can you tell me what you think?"
His words echo, oddly resonant in the steel-walled room, and he latches onto the momentum of it, drawing whatever courage he can.
under the table. Judging by the way he’s biting down on his bottom lip, the rustle-snick of fabric, and how his hands are bobbing around in his lap…
“I'm trying to be a better ruler than he was.” T'Challa touched the silvery ancestral ring he wore on a chain around his neck. The ring’s face was cool, worn smooth by generations of kings before him. “Which is why we can't just sit by as Stark releases ULTRON on the world.”
Steve tries not to fidget under the close scrutiny. He knows his appearance tends to attract attention, but there's not a trace of lasciviousness in Tony’s brown eyes, only open wonder. It’s...unsettling, but not entirely unwelcome.
“Do you ever wish you had more time to do the things you wanted to?” Stark asked quietly. His mood from earlier had returned.
“Is this some kind of joke?” Stark’s shoulders stiffen, cuffed hands sliding off the table to clench in his lap. “I don’t know what your game is, but damned if I'm gonna let some fluffed-up Backstreet Boy wannabe-”
She jerks her thumb to where his discarded mask sits in the corner. “So remember to wear your mask when you interrogate him.”
Tony talked incessantly, constantly bombarding Steve with bawdy jokes and inane chatter. But instead of feeling irritated, Steve found it endearing.
“Hey, it’s alright. Here, you better sit down.” They had circled around the whole quad to the same bench. Steve reached for his arm but Stark swatted his hands away.
Natasha’s voice was level, but Steve had known her long enough to be able to sense the emotion beneath it. Losing Bucky had been hard on her as well - after the Incident, she had left the group to strike out on her own, returning sporadically with quirky souvenirs and stories that were just barely on the believable side of outrageous.
Steve’s eyes were soft when he broke the kiss, licking slightly swollen lips which looked even more pink and plush against the dark blue of his suit.
“You think I’m scared of torture?” Stark spits out. Something desperate and haunted flashes through his brown eyes, only to be instantly replaced by fury. “Unless you’re gonna back up your little threats, this...
“Shall... shall I just cancel everything? Let’s elope right here. I have pillows and snacks in the cupboard so we can cut right to the sex marathon.” Tony ground his hips against Steve’s impatiently, suddenly annoyed at how many clothes they both were wearing. This never would’ve happened if they’d held a beach wedding.
No, the insidiousness of that plan made Steve feel sick. Breaking up Stark’s relationships was not the right thing to do - there had to be another way. Steve couldn't pretend there was anything moral about what they were planning to do. But he could put it in a gentler guise, if only for his own conscience.
Once again, it was mesmerizing to watch him work. The flirtatious attitude from earlier had completely vanished, which made Steve suspect that it was just a persona. The dedicated engineer who spins magic out of pieces of scrap, he senses, is the real man.
Steve leaned against a column. “No, nobody’s angry. Luckily, there isn’t anyone booked after us so the minister agreed to push our wedding back. But we should still hurry; I don't know how much longer Natasha can protect Peter from Bucky and Sam.”
Steve rolls his eyes, trying to hide his relief at not being recognized. “You know, just because we're in your dream doesn't mean I have to put up with your bull.”
“Language,” Steve answered automatically, spearing an apple slice on his fork and ignoring two pairs of rolled eyes. “I was thinking we go for someone younger this time round. A student, for instance.”
“That won’t be necessary,” The clock is ticking; in the dream above them, Scott will soon be starting the countdown song to wake everyone up. Steve has to move this along, and quickly. “I'll deal with anything that attacks you.”
The noise dies away abruptly, leaving a ringing silence in its wake. The pause lingers, one second, two seconds, three…
Steve takes a deep breath. “We have Shuri on the outside keeping Stark stable. Right now we have no choice but to trust her to do her job. Just like we're going to do ours.”
For the first in many times Tony cursed the wires that kept him anchored to the ceiling. Why did they have to be so far from each other? He wished he could rip himself out of his socket so he could confront Steve and explain the situation.
When the four of them formed the team they’d needed a kick song, and Bucky had chosen the theme song from the old Captain America cartoon as a joke. They’d found it hilarious that a song from their childhood now served as their anchor to the real world.
“I don't know.” The uncertainty that had plagued Steve since that night floats back. “You ever think you made the wrong call?”
The next thing Steve notices is the sharp drop in temperature. Their van is parked so close that he can see where every joint of the train is edged with ice, as if it were dredged out of a frozen river. Thick waves of fog start to billow off the carriage, washing over their van and plunging the entire city block into a bitter, oppressive cold.
“Easy, I'll get that for you.” Steve retrieved the pill box and handed it to Stark, who practically snatched it out of his hands. The dark-haired man shakily tapped out two tablets and dry-swallowed them.
“You can’t.” Stark said shakily. His hands dropped to his sides, which clenched tightly into fists. “It’s too late.”
3. Yes, Steve's disguise is a Red Skull mask. I originally wrote it as a dollar-store Captain America mask, but thought it'd be better this way since he's playing the bad cop in the interrogation.
“What are you talking about? I had to bail both of us out.” Stark looks at Stane strangely, zeroing in on her lapse with razor precision. “Wait a minute, something’s not right here…”
Under the combined weight of the humans, Steve to be dead on his legs and he let out a terrifying creak- it was the most frightening sound Tony had ever heard.
Steve sat down next to him, watching Stark try to get his bearings back. This… was definitely unexpected. He hadn’t known the man would be on campus this very day. Stark was shorter than he’d appeared in the images he’d seen, perhaps half a head shorter than Steve. Most striking of all was the dramatic difference in personality; the tired, worn-down man gasping in front of Steve was a far cry from the flashy and confident man he’d seen in T’Challa’s video.
“Call me a square all you like, but-” Steve backs up slowly, moving to the edge of the atrium. “-but sometimes the old-fashioned things work best,” He fixes the angle in his mind, calculating the trajectory and amount of spin needed for his next move. “Teaches you to get creative in other ways.”
Like Natasha, Nakia remained mysteriously tight-lipped about the whole situation, making only small talk with them.
“Come on, it’s me. Of course I can,” Shuri’s light tone quickly turned serious. “But nobody knows how safe it is to infiltrate a mind when the body's dying…”
He was used being admired. To hear the oohs and aahs of visitors as they gazed on his glossy outer shell, the many hands which caressed his sculpted curves in awed wonder, the short hush that fell over the watchers when his balls were pulled and his bulb lit up, bathing the room in a warm wash of light.
There's a long, low blast of sound, like the blare of a ship’s horn, followed by a rising rumble that seems to vibrate every molecule of air. The noise prickles the hair at the back of Steve’s neck and sends a bubble of dread into his throat.
Steve hates admitting when he’s wrong, but he’s grateful to have backup. One person couldn't have handled it alone.
“More like what didn't he talk about; our conversation was pretty one-sided,” The memory of his words from that night makes him wince; how he had treated the man like a random crazy person, offering fumbling platitudes that sounded so clumsy now. “He was in a bad place so I talked him down…”
But Tony was a prisoner of his own technology. No matter how much he stretched out his pull-strings, Steve always remained a tantalizing few feet out of reach. So close, and yet so far. Their paths were never intended to meet.
“You're not exactly giving me room to breathe here.” Steve said slowly, wondering if he was going to get interrupted again.
Steve had never thought he’d become an artist, but something about it called to him after he left the military; when he set pencil to paper it felt natural in a way those years of service never had. There was something extraordinary about the way a few lines could give beauty and meaning to a empty space. He went from a world of gunfire and tactical briefings to charcoals and watercolors. Instead of helicopters and tanks he painted cathedrals and bridges, landscapes and families.
“Sure I do, that movie’s a classic.” Steve feels a smile tugging at his lips. The adrenaline of a good fight is coursing through his blood, lifting his spirits. The good vibes lull him into nostalgia, reminding him of those old battles with friends, and he finds himself saying, “Great job, Tony, I couldn’t have done this without you.”
“Tony. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,” His lips curl into a sour smile. “Holder of exactly six hundred and sixteen weapon patents, and voted Sexiest Man Alive three years running.”
Tony felt a bit put out. He'd known tables before at the furniture store: They were big sticks-in-the-mud for the most part, staid and inflexible.
Gleaming in the afternoon sun, the city manages to be both futuristic and classic - they could be anywhere, any time in the world.
“You’re so weird.” Tony flopped back on the bed. “Didn't it blow a bulb the first time we had a date? And I’m pretty sure it tried to burn me. Twice.”
“I wouldn't recommend copying real world buildings exactly. The worst thing that could happen is if your mind loses its grip on reality.” Steve nodded at her sketchbook, which was opened to a study of bridge drawings. “You're a designer, put your own spin on it.”
They bantered with an easy humor and for a second Steve felt a sense of deja vu - back to when they were younger and more idealistic and a whole lot more reckless. Then the moment of nostalgia faded, leaving only a feeling of resolve. The emptiness of the fourth seat seemed more pronounced than ever.
Her interest was heartening, but Steve hoped Wanda wouldn't balk at the less glamorous parts of the job: combing through financial reports and digging up dirt on targets. “It's not all fun and games, you're going to have put in solid hard work for the next few weeks.”
have been at me for days.” Natasha’s imitation of Stane’s voice is flawless, punctuating every word with a groan or pained croak. It's very convincing, and Steve can almost believe she really is an old man beaten to an inch of his life. “I don’t know how much more I can take.”
- that stuff is so easy that we could do it in our sleep,” Sam tilted his neck to the side, narrowly dodging a grape thrown by a groaning Natasha. “A full blown inception is going to take more than the three of us to carry out.”
“There are several other exits, but we can't get to them with all these projections in the way…” Wanda scans her surroundings, quickly weighing up her options. “Let me try something.”
“Barely.” Sam rubbed his temples. “Those bastards keep getting bigger and faster. A day’s gonna come that we can’t outrun them.”
“Mmm, and what a face it is. I-” Tony drifts off mid-sentence as his gaze roves over Steve’s face and arms. “Huh.”
Tony wished he could throw himself onto the ground to end his shame. This was all probably because Tony had bungled their first meeting and Steve thought he was arrogant or something.
“Listen, I don't know what's going on, but…” Steve reached out his hands cautiously, settling them on Stark’s shoulders. “Don't waste your life thinking that. You aren't alone.”
“Can't have a city without people, right? When we go into a dream, the target’s mind will populate your world with projections. ” Steve said. “Normally they’re harmless. But if you alter the world too much they can get violent.”
“How about: I'm not my father, I'm my own man. I will build something new with my life.” Sam suggested.
And doves were tacky, now that Tony thought about it. Perhaps a flock of bald eagles was more befitting of the occasion...
“Hard work sounds great. Just what I need right now.” Wanda fiddled with the corner of her jacket. Her mouth twitched as she looked down at her hands. “Gotta take my mind off… stuff.”
“There's evidence suggesting he's selling to terrorists, rogue nation, dictators…” Natasha shook her head. “If I had more time I could dig something up more concrete, but this is all I got.”
“There are too many!” Scott clutches the wheel in desperation as the first armored car draws near. “If we don't shake them, they'll follow us to the first point.”
There's movement from one of the rooftops. Steve catches a glimpse of a figure, shadowy and long-haired, a sniper rifle held in hand. It’s too distant to make out any facial features, but there’s a certain set to the stance that he recognizes all too well.
“As I was saying,” Steve is ready to give up on Tony not finding a way to turn every word into a double entendre. At least he’s cooperating now. “We should get out of here before more enemies show up.”
“No, what did you do to your friend?” Tony presses. His voice is apprehensive, as though he expects Steve to confirm his worst fears. “What happened?”
Steve continued thoughtfully. “Once I put my suit on and climbed down to the street, a troupe of costumed dancers ambushed me and chased me all the way to the church.” He gave Tony a quizzical look. “It was the strangest experience. I didn’t know that was a thing people did in the 2000s.”
Eventually, the waiting stretched into years, but to Steve it could have happened yesterday. What was a handful of years, when you'd lived for hundreds?
As Steve cast his mind back, he realised that the last two days had been the longest they'd all been together since her departure. How long had it been since they'd all shared a meal in this kitchen together?
“Um. It’s kind of all our problems if honking big freight trains are showing up every time you enter a dream.” Natasha plants herself squarely in front of Steve. The sun glances off Stane’s shiny bald head in a way that makes it hard to look at her for too long. “That has to mean it’s getting worse - you can't just go on keeping it all inside.”
“It's not always bloodless,” T’Challa whispered. A memory rose to the fore of his mind. “We learned that the hard way.”
“We might not have a choice,” Natasha was standing next to the gurney, her quiet voice slowly morphing into one horrified self-realization. “When I was working in SI-Legal, I had a look at his will; ULTRON is set to go on the market two weeks from now. But if he dies before then, ULTRON is to be released automatically on the internet, for free.” Her leather-gloved hands clenched on the handrail of the gurney. “Stark is the only one who can overturn it.”
He really didn’t know. He had no clue what to do, and Stark was gazing at him like he held all the answers in the universe.
“Obie, Obie, always thinking about the bottom line. You should’ve seen his face when he heard about my freebie clause.” Tony chuckles, testing the tension on whatever mystery item he's constructing. “This is more important than money, it’s the future. ULTRON isn’t something you can put in a box and sell to the mass-market.” He starts flattening out a curved metal plate with a hammer. “I'm gonna make sure the world gets the protection it deserves, and this little program is going to change everything.”
To brainwash. He couldn’t say the words. Memories flashed before his eyes, of falling, shattered glass, and too much blood. No.
"Well, I wouldn’t say exactly like old times, we've gotten a lot better at not getting kicked out of every place we go to.”
"I know a guy. Engineer, knows a thing or two about chemicals as well. He’s a little nervous, but he knows his stuff," Sam said. “Scott Lang. He was one of the key people involved in the Cross-Pym job.”
“Stane.” Steve lies smoothly. “He kidnapped and drugged you, as we speak he’s trying steal information from your mind.”
“From what I gathered, Stark doesn’t know a thing about it.” Natasha shook her head. “So, no. Not directly, at least.”
The next images were a series of marketing materials for drones, missiles, and satellite systems. “You’ll notice that every product released since ‘08 was related to surveillance systems and weapons technology. They've been pumping out more and more ever since."
Zinnias - The Victorian meaning of zinnias is thoughts of an absent friend. Other meanings include: thoughts of friends, endurance, daily remembrance, goodness and lasting affection. I would offer the zinnia flower on any occasion but especially when a person is feeling directionless or lost.
“No! I won’t let you throw away your life for me!” Steve bucked up with all the force of a falling tree, throwing both Owner and Owner’s Companion up into the air. Owner’s Companion yelped as the back of his neck smacked into Tony’s globe, and there was a faint sizzling noise.
“You’re offering a lot,” Steve said slowly. “What’s the catch?” Because there had to be - nothing had gone right in years.
“He must've flatlined in the real world,” A drained Sam swipes at the cold sweat on his forehead. “Congrats, ladies and gents, you just got a sneak peek into the great unknown…”
2. According to my google research, it's 100% possible to pick handcuffs with a pen. Apparently you have to break it open and use the thingy inside to lift the lock.
Sometimes Steve wondered how he had come through whole ordeal with his own sanity intact. Maybe it was because he was the one who initiated the idea. Maybe it was the part of him that was too stubborn to quit, that was still a scrawny kid who picked fights with bullies. There were a hundred maybes.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about! I couldn't tell you a code even if I wanted to.” Stark appeals to Stane but Natasha remains unhelpfully silent. His eyes widen imploringly when he looks up Steve. “Look, I’m trying to work with you here, but you gotta ask me for something that isn’t made up.”
It felt absurd, trying to reconcile Tony, the cocky tycoon who designed weapons of mass destruction, with Tony, the broken man who gave out free college tuition like party favors and whose eyes were so irreparably sad. The two personalities seemed like completely different men.
Tony swung himself on his wires to get a closer look at the mysterious package. All the essential furniture had already been moved into the new apartment. Perhaps Owner had splurged on a treadmill, or a piano, or a massage chair.
So he scans his surroundings, looking for anything he can turn to his advantage... Steve catches sight of the humongous wrought-iron chandelier, an evil-looking thing studded with jagged spikes.
Blowing his bulb was humiliating, a behavior expected of some young light fresh out of the box. Tony wished for the millionth time that he hadn’t made such a mess, he must have looked like a blazing idiot in front of Steve.
Stark’s face darkens and his voice becomes tight. “Scratch that, let me rephrase; There’s nothing he loved more than the bottom of a bottle.”
“Smart move.” Tony rolled over towards the blond man. “It’s kinda interesting how you have that hipster monstrosity dangling over that gorgeous vintage table. They don't make things with that kind of quality workmanship anymore, where'd you get it from?”
“Sure fooled me.” Steve smiles wryly. “It’s good to know at least one part of our plan will go right.”
“Seems like you had a busy night, considering you aren't even dressed yet. Thanks, DUM-E.” Steve unhooked the garment bag from the bot’s arm and held it out. “Put on the suit, we have a wedding to get to.”
A tiny blue spark of electricity arced off Tony’s string, dancing across the table’s flat top, sending the most pecular feeling shooting through ever fiber of Steve’s being.
“There are too many enemies for one person to fight through, so we’ll have to work together.” Steve concedes grudgingly.
“Listen, your macho routine is very charming - in another situation I’d be vocally, enthusiastically on board - but I can handle myself.” Tony casts an uneasy gaze down the currently-deserted hallway. “You're gonna need help fighting those... projection things. They pack a mean punch.”
in Singapore, though it's a pedestrian bridge so you can't actually drive on it. I always thought it was pretty and wanted to do a shoutout to my own country :p
“Don't worry, I don’t expect you to fight. The rest of the team will handle any dangerous tasks.” Steve said. “But who knows, you might surprise yourself.”
“Cut the crap, Rogers, I know when people aren’t being honest with me.” She crosses her arms. “Sam tells me that train was twice the size it used to be! That sounds like a problem to me.”
“This is it, people. We gotta go.” Sam tossed his phone on the couch and immediately began grabbing equipment.
“Don't act dumb. We want the five-digit code Howard Stark gave you that opens the family vault. Now.”
“I stopped doing what I was doing. Immediately.” Steve chooses to misunderstand the question. “When I saw how much it hurt everyone, I had to make sure I never did that to anyone ever again-”
Tony catches him staring and readjusts his shirt with a frown. Clad now in a vest and with with his sleeves rolled up past his forearms, Tony starts organizing his pile of junk, extracting parts and fashioning them into...something.
Steve bites his lip. “I made a mistake.” That was putting it lightly. “Something I- I created turned out wrong, and my friend got hurt badly.” Careful, Steve. “He’s never been the same after that.”
“Of course.” Shuri nudged T’Challa with her elbow. “I can’t believe you’re actually joining this crazy mission too. Baba always said you were too hotheaded.”
Steve wished he could be closer, but was no way he could get a leg up off the ground. The few feet of distance between them might as well have been light years.
As they leave the storage room behind them, Steve feels doubt start to stir. The whole mission is heading into uncharted territory - he had never dealt on a target who refused to obey orders and took so much initiative. Tony’s unpredictability could turn out to be very helpful or very dangerous for all of them.
Being the recipient of Steve’s smiles was better than creating a new armor, better than flying, better than sex - just barely, though - and Tony would do anything to keep that smile on Steve’s face for the rest of his life.
“Okay, but…” Sam began counting out on each finger. “That'd mean we'd have to buy out the entire wing of the hospital and all the doctors, staff, drivers….”
T’Challa turned to Nakia and they exchanged a few terse words in Xhosa. She didn't look thrilled, but she gave him a grudging nod. “Besides, my sister, Shuri, will be handling medical support, and there's no one I trust more than her.”
“Protect m-? So you're like my imaginary friend?” Stark sputters weakly, looking like he wants nothing more than a stiff drink. “Okay, then… that's new…definitely shouldn’t have stopped going to therapy…”
A wave of uncertainty hit him. Was it worth it, to destroy another man's mind for the chance to fix his mistake?
“My dad?” Stark scoffs disdainfully. “We talking about the same guy? The happiest day of his life was when he shipped me off to boarding school.” He stares very hard at the stained wall directly in front of him as if he can burn a hole in it with his gaze.
Steve cleared his throat. “You have to remember that the subconscious runs on emotion. So we need to distill all this-” He gestured at the screen. “Down to one essential thing."
“The only way to getting out of a dream is to die. The easiest way is to fall from a high place.” Steve watched her carefully to see how she’d take that piece of information. This was the part of the conversation where most sane people yelled at him and walked away.
“What’s wrong with this tacky light? It keeps flickering whenever I come over. The cheap piece of shit blew on our first date too. Why don’t you just replace it with something that actually works?”
It was hard to remember he'd had a whole life before the Incident happened. Everything he remembered was divided into Before and After.
“I didn’t see you at my speech. Are you new here? New lecturer? You look like an art history type of guy.” Stark's bleary eyes wandered over Steve. “Has anyone told you you have the face of a Michelangelo? And the body of a...”
Steve laughed at shook his head. “Sorry, mister, but you made the extravagantly overpriced bed and now you gotta lie in it.”
“Then trust me on this.” Steve said, feeling more like he was trying to convince himself. “I’m fine.”
Natasha shook her head “I know about as much as you do. I’m just here to collect you two so we can all meet her boss."
“That turned out fine in the end,” Maybe not for Rumlow, though. He wondered if the man ever recovered the feeling in his hands. “Still got the job done.”
“I've seen colder. And if it can protect the people I love?” Tony sets his jaw determinedly. “It's worth it.”
The elevator doors opened to a luxurious suite, lavishly decorated with with Wakandan art and textiles. Nakia brought them to a meeting room where her king was seated at the table.
“How about that? Luckily for you I’m feeling extra magnanimous, so I won't say ‘I told you so’.” Tony stretches languorously, and Steve definitely isn't looking - even if the action makes Tony’s shirt slide appealingly over the curve of his hips.
Steve considered the money. It definitely was generous, enough to cover their problems for a decent amount of time. But…
Tony enjoyed when Owner threw parties with fancy food, because it meant Steve would be dressed up for the occasion. Their Owner would polish Steve till he shone, and cover him with a tablecloth. Tony’s favourite was the lacy one: the delicate white lace contrasted Steve’s rich colouring beautifully, providing teasing glimpses of gleaming wood as it shifted over his broad surface. Most beautiful of all was the way Steve bore all the weight on his sturdy back without complaint.
“What? No!” Stark turns to Stane sharply. “Seriously, Obie? You actually wanna play ball with Jack Skellington over there?”
“You heard the man.” Sam swallows heavily and starts hauling people to their feet. “Let's move, team.”
“But Steve, I-” Tony’s train of thought puttered out when Steve closed the distance with a kiss. His arms automatically went around Steve’s waist the same time Steve’s fingers threaded through his hair. The gentle pressure as Steve opened his mouth to accept his tongue sent a spark of sensation up his spine, and the sound Steve made when Tony’s hands wandered lower to squeeze at his ass had every every synapse in his brain short-circuiting.
Steve’s own eyes are starting to water from the intensity, and he hopes Stark can’t see how his grip on the gun is starting to shake.
“It’s impossible,” said Sam, breaking the silence. “You'd have an easier time growing trees on the moon.”
Stark hissed at the jostling. He fished something out of his pocket but it slipped from his unsteady fingers, falling onto the withered grass. He looked like he was going to cry, face twisting as he reached for the fallen pill box with slow, laborious movements.
“Aw, don’t be like that, I can’t help what you bring out in me.” Stark leers. “Ever hear of letting loose? You should try it once in a while.”
The cynical side of him contemplated just taking off with the cash. It was certainly enough to keep them going for a few years. Retirement even, if they were careful. He could move Bucky into a better medical facility than the current one...
Tony shuddered. Seriously, Steve had endured enough strife for ten lifetimes, and he deserved to be pampered and showered with gifts. Tony would summon up every scrap of love from the bottom of his shrivelled, shrapnel-scarred heart to make this the best gosh-darned day Steve would ever have.
The praise makes Tony's eyes light up. “If you think this is great, you should see what I can cook up in my lab. I could make an entire set of-”
The structural pillars explode in a spray of concrete and steel. A resounding crack rips the air as the shockwave tears the freeway in two, obliterating the stretch of road and the first two ranks of armored cars. The explosion opens up a chasm separating Steve’s team from the remaining projections - the ones that don’t brake in time go plummeting into the river alongside the debris.
“Don't be a idiot, Stark!” Steve calls after him. “There are more of them out there, it's suicide to go alone.”
The most outlandish of these new furnishings was definitely the globe-shaped lamp hanging above him. The last time Steve been in a home, lamps were simple appliances with shades.
I'm so in love with Steve's fam in TWS. Natasha and Sam are such good friends to him it always makes me cry TT^TT
Tony’s face shutters at the refusal. “Fine. If you're gonna be like that then it's better that we go our separate ways.” His jaw snaps shut with a click and he turns his back on Steve to leave.
“Yes.” Steve says tiredly. Now seemed as good a time as any to pick up where their interview had left off.
The next slide showed a bald man with jovial smile plastered on his cheeks. “Obadiah Stane. Howard Stark’s right hand man back in the day and Tony’s godfather. He’s one of the old guard and still has a lot of sway over the company. The relationship between him and Tony is...complicated.”
“We do have one lead.” A photo of a willowy redhead appeared. “Pepper Potts, Tony’s personal assistant and the only person at SI he trusts,” The earlier pictures of them had captured a spark of genuine closeness between Potts and Stark, but as the photos became more recent, the distance between them had grown. The most recent picture showed them standing side by side at a conference, a chilly aura palpable through the screen. “They broke off their engagement in 2013. Still remained friendly, although she’s now married to the head of his security team.”
“What's a train even doing in the middle of my city? I didn't design any metro systems,” Wanda demands, flipping through her drawings agitatedly. “And I double, triple checked all my plans.”
“I am well aware. And of course, I can’t force you to do anything you don’t want to.” T’Challa put a reassuring hand on his sister’s shoulder. Then his face hardened, crystallizing into a determined mask. “But know this, if you walk away now then our deal regarding the rehabilitation of one James Buchanan Barnes - is off the table.”
In the chilliness of the hallway, Tony’s hand feels very warm in his, those long, calloused fingers twitching slightly against his palm. Tony stares at him with an unreadable expression, breaths still coming hard from the exertion of the run, and then his eyes slide down to where their hands are joined.
“That's really amazing,” Steve says. “I've never seen a weapon like that before, and the way you just came up with it right off the bat-”
Steve raised an arm to stop her. “Hold on, you said he’s dying?” That changed everything. “Why can't we wait until he's more stable?”
The absence of sensory input is so absolute, it's like someone cut away the vision from his eyes, leaving behind a gaping endless void.
“Well fuck me sideways, someone’s a real hipster.” Stark scoffs, gingerly picking his way through pieces of shattered projection.
"It’s not impossible." Steve kept his face stoic as he looked T’Challa directly in the eye. "But before I answer anything else, I'd like to know why you came to us. With all the resources you have, why not take care of the job yourselves?"
“Well then, it's a good thing I've been keeping an eye on the design schools for the next bright young thing,” Natasha looked up from her tablet. She pulled up a social media page of a dark-haired young woman wearing heavy eye makeup. “Wanda Maximoff. She seems the most promising of the bunch.”
A silence fell over the table. Something felt significant about the moment, but Steve couldn’t put his finger on why. “Looks like the gang’s back together again.”
When he uncuffs Stark’s hands from the pipe, the wrists come away raw and bloody; he'd shredded the skin in his desperate attempt to save “Pepper”. Feeling a stab of guilt, Steve lowers the unconscious man to the ground and starts bandaging the torn skin in a roll of gauze.
Stark smirks. “What’s wrong? Too scared to hit a man who can't fight back? Oh wait-” He leans forward, eyes widening. “Is that your thing? Because you're supposed to negotiate the safeword
Steve blinks in surprise before realising Tony’s just making small talk. “The job? Just fell into it, I guess.”
Steve had awoken to a room painted in the deep orange glow of the early evening. By the clock on the mantle, their entire sleep (
I came up with this idea in 2016 and made a whole bunch of gifsets on tumblr, hoping someone would write the fic for me. After watching Black Panther I felt so inspired that I decided to write it myself! This is the first fanfic I've written since I was 14 years old xD
“Cardiac arrest. I’ve stabilized him for now. Which was tough, even for me.” Shuri said crisply. “Also, did you know that he’s dying?”
But when it came to the dream world, the four of them were an unstoppable team; Steve as the Architect, creating worlds for them to work in. As a Point man, Sam was reliable and organized, holding the team together with his steady presence. Wily and mercurial, Natasha’s Forging skills allowed her slip into any disguise. Bucky, always a natural with people, could Extract info from the most stubborn of marks. All three of them had unequivocally decided that Steve should be the one in charge.
“Some of us are still in here, Scott!” Wanda yells, wedging herself into the seat as deep as she can. “Where did you learn to drive?”
. And Bucky had been there from the start; defending him from bullies, standing with him at his mother’s funeral, the first person he came out to, and, after they’d completed their first military tour, the first one on his team before he met Sam and Natasha.
“His best friend is Colonel James Rhodes, 48. They’ve known each other since MIT and he's probably the only one knows Tony the best.” The next picture showed a stern-faced faced man in an air force uniform. Other than a few pixelated selfies from their college days, there weren't too many images of Rhodes. “The bad news is he was WIA a few months ago so we can't get to him. Still recuperating at an army hospital.”
For a split second, confusion blooms wide on Stark’s face before being swept under an insolent sneer. “Why should I give you anything?”
.” beaten, Stark's head drops in submission. His breath gasps in and out like he’s run a marathon. “I-I don't know, 6… 2 - 4 - 7 - 2… that's- thats all I got…”
They'd barely entered in the dream and the place was quickly turning like a war zone; Sam provides cover fire, concentrating his efforts on harrying the crowd, dodging the deadly rain of bullets with almost superhuman agility.
“I love you, not because of the things you do for me and certainly not because of your money. Just you.” Steve’s expression was open and attentive. “Your generous heart is one of the things I adore about you.”
"Stark Industries, the largest weapons development company in the world. It's currently run by the founder’s son, Tony.” T’Challa said. “I want you to perform inception on him so that he’ll shut down the company."
The second time had started with Bucky spending an entire morning tidying, tossing out the trash in a rare streak of productivity. “Heading out to stretch my legs, Steve,” he said, rolling his shoulders till they popped. It had snowed the night before, which meant Steve could hear Bucky’s footsteps crunching away down the street. Steve had thought nothing of it until that evening when a grim-faced officer showed up on his doorstep with the news that Bucky... that Bucky had…
“Ah, so that's how it is,” Betrayal flashes through Stark’s dark eyes, but he doesn't seem particularly surprised by the answer, almost as if he'd been expecting it. “And how do you fit into the equation?”
The man slung Stark’s arm over a broad shoulder like he’d done it hundreds of times before, giving Steve a brusque nod as he half-walked, half-carried his boss to the car. In a few seconds the car was gone, leaving Steve standing alone in the empty driveway.
He had bumped into Sam later on; at a charity ball for veterans where one of Steve’s paintings was up for auction. A slightly tipsy Sam had taken one look at the painting and loudly proclaimed that his grandmother, god rest her soul, could do better than this dinky bullshit. A very tipsy Bucky shoved Sam into a fountain, misjudged his footing, and toppled in gracelessly only to catch a fist to the face from a disgruntled and soaked Sam. The ensuing water wrestling match brought the entire retinue of security guards down on them. Steve managed to avoid being dragged into the brawl, but that didn’t stop the museum from slapping him, along with the two instigators, with a lifetime ban.
“Everything alright there, friend?” Of all the things that had happened this week, talking to strange men in the middle of the night whilst interviewing a college student wasn’t how Steve thought this day would turn out.
“It's a sign we need to move. Come on!” Steve makes sure Tony’s in front of him and they dash through the doors.
“We stick to the plan; Scott, we’re counting on you to hold the fort on this level. After we go under, wait five minutes to start the kick song,
"Out of the question.” T’Challa shook his head firmly. “I will not have our entry into the wider world be tainted by an act of violence - We don't assassinate civilians for agendas, no matter how noble the cause.”
“Since when did this become my life?” Stark mutters, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. “Is your entire kidnapping club hopped up on happy juice, or is it just you?”
“So if he kicks it, we're trapped in darkness till our brains turn to mush?” Wanda’s shoulders quake as she wraps her arms tightly around herself. “This is so messed up…”
“Give me a weapon. Or at least give me some time to build one.” Tony folds his arms, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. “There’s gotta be a maintenance locker around here or a set of tools… something
“You're in a dream now, Stark.” The rehearsed lie falls smoothly from Steve’s mouth. “Your mind is under attack by Obadiah Stane, but don’t worry, I’m here to help you.”
The van keeps rising higher, above the projections, above the the train, higher and higher until they break through the fog and into the sunlight, eye-level with where Sam is hovering. He gives them a wave through the cracked windscreen.
“It has to be a simple message so it can take root.” Natasha said. “The mind becomes more suggestible the more levels we go down.”
“Nah, the meeting for that is next Tuesday.” Sam said drily. “Support group for Steve’s friends who put up with his crazy shit.”
He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose tiredly. “What kind of people would we be if we resorted to such measures?”
“That reminds me, I forgot to tell you that your appearance within the dream reflects how you see yourself.”
Stark is glowering at him from inside the glass cube, sitting as upright as the handcuffs will let him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Tony, it’s just furniture.” Steve folded him into an embrace. “I need to get you to lighten up more.”
Steve woke with a gasp as if he'd been punched. Rolling to his side, he immediately grabbed his totem off the bedside table and dropped it to the ground.
“That skull face is creepy.” Steve grumbles. Playing the role has never sat right with him. Wearing the mask and interrogating a target always felt like a role that belonged to someone else.
"They’ve resisted every attempt we’ve made at buying them out. Stark’s a futurist, he doesn’t care about money,” T'Challa shut the curtains to block out the sight of Stark’s tower. “He’s only interested in his inventions, never pausing to consider how they might affect the world.”
The sight of Steve covered in those small lights made Tony’s bulb feel uncomfortably tight in its socket. As he watched, one of the melting candles dribbled a trail of wax onto Steve’s surface - and that pushed Tony over the edge.
Shaking her head, Natasha starts rolling her shirtsleeves up over Stane’s huge arms. “Anyway, what's done is done. I suppose you did what you thought was right.” She messes up her tie and rumples up Stane’s clothes. “The possibility of Stark recognizing you won't torpedo our plans, but it could throw a wrench into them.”
In the freezing darkness that followed, he could hear glass shards pattering on Steve’s surface. The thin curls of smoke streaming from his shattered bulb was evidence of his lack of control, and despite his extinguished state he felt a hot rush of shame.
“To see how much of a threat you are. You've been assessed from the moment you drove here.” Nakia murmured something into her comm, and every single occupant of the crowded lobby - tourists and hotel staff - instantly stopped what they were doing and vacated the area. She rose to her feet, gesturing them to follow her to the elevator. “You’ve just been cleared. I'll bring you to him now.”
Below him, Steve remained primly impassive. The only light in the room now came from the candles, shading Steve’s grain to a rich mahogany, and reflecting off the glass shards like diamonds. Those tiny chips of glass winked up Tony almost accusingly, a sign of his lack of self-control.
“And you chose that thing? It’s medieval.” Stark flaps his hand at the shield, trying to recover some of his composure. “I feel so much safer now.”
To Tony’s dismay, his new home had been dull, putting a real dimmer on his expectations. He was simply too far away from any of the other furniture to make friends with them. Tony didn’t expect the rest of his future to be bright.
Of course, no such code existed - it was all part of the gambit Natasha and Bucky had concocted years ago.
“That still only counts as one!” Tony stalks over to him, grumbling all the way as he steps over a tangle of metal limbs. “Oh, whatever, you probably don't even get that reference…”
Steve’s only chance to return it would be the day of the mission. It wasn't like their paths would ever cross otherwise.
"Yeah, we want to avoid another Vanko situation.” Sam drummed his fingers on the table. “We've got to screen them better so the next son of a bitch doesn’t…”
Sensing they were approaching a touchy subject, Steve decided not to pry. “Alright, now that you understand the basics, I have a test for you.”
A storm-grey freight train hurtles across the junction just in front of them, moving so fast it shatters the windows of every building within the block. Old, tarnished, and inexplicably covered with frost, it dwarfs the size of a normal train - the whole carriage stretches several city blocks long, and is so wide that it shears away all the street-facing shop fronts while churning the sidewalk to gravel.
Steve let out a low creak of a groan, hardly daring believe his wishes were coming true. It was everything he’d hoped for, but he had to go slow.
“We'll have plenty of time for that, after.” Steve answered, letting the end of his sentence drop into a low burr, and damn how that did
Natasha grimaces, an effect greatly enhanced by Stane’s beady eyes. “You met him before this? That's not good. If he recognizes your face, that could throw off all our calculations.”
All these modern appliances were so sleek and minimalistic; next to them, he was an antique in every sense of the word, and he couldn’t help feeling self-conscious of his appearance.
Shuri grinned at Steve, regaining some of her earlier aplomb. “Make sure my brother doesn’t do anything stupid.”
Steve realises. The last time they'd worked together Natasha hadn't quite mastered the technique of throwing her voice like that. Now, it was proving to be very effective.
Surprisingly, Stark followed him without question. And for a while they walked in silence around the quad, their shoulders brushing together occasionally.
Tony pauses take a breath, drawing himself up like he’s about to launch into a rousing speech. “Imagine, a suit of armor around the world-”
“Yeah. I didn't mean to wake you.” Steve closed the comic on a page of Captain America punching a red villain in the face and flipped the lid of the box shut.
“All I'm saying is I can tell the difference between someone running towards something, and someone running away from it.” Sam stated. “You can’t keep blaming yourself - Don’t give me that look, I know you do it all the time, going around like a big sad golden retriever all the time.”
“I doubt he’ll remember. He seemed out of it when I met him.” Steve feels a twinge of unease. At the time he had thought Stark was drunk or high, but what if it was as Shuri said, that he was dying…?
“I know there's little she can't handle, especially under your tutelage. I’m thinking of my own stress levels.” T’Challa muttered ruefully.
Swiftly as he can - all the while trying to avoid the fingers stabbing at his eyeballs - Steve wrestles Stark into the van where a waiting Natasha jabs a needle into his neck. The sedative kicks in within a few seconds and he goes limp in Steve’s hold, eyes fluttering shut.
