With a shaky breath and a firm nod, the horses began to move along the central road.
warnings for molestation ahead...
"Yes. Of course." Sherlock rocked on his heels, obviously relieved, then remembered something. "Although, I ehm, should warn you before hand. You may find it far easier to use the en suite upstairs as it's far less ...currently occupied. Well, the toilet's free, but the shower and sink--"
He'd recognize that voice anywhere.
A long time later, John was dozing, only coming awake when Sherlock began to shift like a halfnumb thing beneath him. He pushed up and rolled off, watching that long white body jack knife to sit at the edge of the bed and scrub a hand through his hair to resettle it. "I can't lay here any longer, John. I've things to do. But you should continue to rest, you're still tired." He said and turned to blink at John like a sphinx with a riddle. It was obvious from the clarity in his eyes that he'd not slept at all.
With a motion of Asano-san's hand, one of the body guards presented Sherlock with a 9x12" glossy picture and as he passed it over John saw that it was of a small, vivid red and white fish against a background of artificial blue. Its variegated stripes ran vertically across its entire body, punctuated by a bright yellow face and small, protuberant black eyes. For lack of a better word, John would say that it was cute.
"Yes. This morning,'' John says, not even bothering to worry about how he could possibly know. "'Natural causes' apparently. So if that doesn't make you mad enough to rouse you out of bed then I don't know what will." He picks at the bed linen a bit and goes for a cheap blow. "I thought you agreed that we would work together."
"You're an idiot's more like." John chided back without much heat, a little bit annoyed at how affectionate his tone kept being. "Sit down before you fall down."
"John? You're alright! You're alright. Just take a deep breath and try to calm down!"
It was the third strip of land that he tended to now. And he could already foresee the crop that would sprout from his hand-cast seeds. Come July, the golden stalks of barley would have grown so tall he'd have to take a scythe to it to see the horizon again.
"I'll ALWAYS want you. And just because you don't want to, or because - like you said - you function differently, that does not make you dysfunctional. Yeah? You're brilliant and mad and yes, a colossal git most days, I'll give you that, but that doesn't make-- you have never been broken. Nothing about you is." He pressed a kiss to the crease between Sherlock's eyebrows and pulled back to retake his eyes. "There is NOTHING wrong with you. Do you understand?"
It broke out onto the edge of the Forest, before banking up sharp and climbing the sudden stone face of the cliff that rose a hundred feet upwards. Up to where the natural rock sloped back into a man-made batter. Startlingly gray against the rich black of the earth. Hewn from foreign stone.
A few frantic pulls against his new bonds made the man learn that he'd been effectively immobilized and he finally slumped. Defeated.
"No no no. It was in the nineties that you began your residency, so the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 would have still been in effect and forbade anyone under the age of twenty-one to engage in any homosexual activity under penalty of law. And given that you had had conscientiously bigoted homophobic ...friends? No, a roommate! -- oh! even better! -- during that period, you wouldn't have risked your prospective career on any sort of possible drama that could have arisen, ergo you purposely chose to court strictly females throughout your time studying and only delineated from your set path once the perfect circumstances arose. Inference: Afghanistan.
John did his best to sit up a little straighter, trying to look his part. Little good would come in the whispers of the townsfolk if they thought the King was now employing broken knights.
"Yes?" Sherlock asked, his voice deep and raking and giving one final chance to call him off.
The impact with the ground lights up John's bones in the same moment that the force of it knocks the air from his lungs.
"I love you Sherlock Holmes." John says.
They kissed. Sherlock's hands scooped around to the back of John's shoulder while the grip on Sherlock's rib cage became stronger, possessive.
When his gloves finally came off with the balloon-smack of consummation, his mouth was a thinly pressed line. "This is most definitely murder."
Then again.
He kissed him once. Twice. Enjoying the half-second it took for Sherlock to catch up to his plan and admired the sheer look of confusion painted on that beautiful face.
And Bill's lips are splitting open now much wider than they should and the whispers that are pouring down from Bill's red mouth hurt just as much as the bullet had going in: 'Za ta sara meena kawom Za ta sara meena kawom Za ta sara meena kawom. I love you I love you I love you.' Before he is leaning back again.
"John?" A strong hand wrapped itself around John's straining wrist to coax him out of his reverie. John fought his eyes to open, his head to turn. Each muscle required to do so felt cemented in place, locked tight in warring arousal and objection. He could stop this now, go back to before, tread ground that was already well trodden with one simple word.
Not wanting to embarrass him, brother Michael gently took the scroll back from his hands and read it aloud, as it was evident John could not read:
Before he can even attempt to laugh at the absurdity of it, of the fact that he's about to be eaten /alive!/ the Union Jack neck man is wrenching his jaws open wide enough for the pliers to move in.
"This is what I get then? Three days of silence and then you throwing yourself at me like this?" John spoke a long time later. After their heartbeats had dimmed. After their blood had cooled. After Sherlock had stopped trembling. The spunk painting their bellies and fingers and lips had dried into a thin, salty crust. The blanket swaddled them together.
At the other side of the furlong there was a man seated upon a gray horse. He looked imposing from John's position on the ground and for a brief moment of confusion John mistook him for Marshal Moran. Having returned from the dead to exact his revenge.
"And I am also happy to inform you that the King is allowing you to bring with you a second man, your most trusted companion, whom has already agreed to make this journey with you. So we are to leave at dawn on the morrow."
"No." Sherlock met his eyes, looking wicked. "Your body is yours. You can do with it as you wish. But if you would allow me the same courtesies on occasion?" He tilted the bottle questioningly. "I'd like to do with it as /you/ wish as well. May I finish you now?"
It was a fine spring day to be readying this land for sowing.
"And what about you?!" William called, but John had already disappeared.
All it takes is one shout, one startled yelp from Sherlock and John is up, swiping out his hand for a weapon, and moving before the drugs know to stop him.
"You're joking right?" John swallowed hard and reread the smirk that sparkled in Sherlock's eye, seeing what was there. "You're having me on."
John pinched his eyes shut as everything came flooding into his mind, filling him up with so many mixed emotions that he wanted to react physically. But instead he lay there, counting to ten.
The King's presence beside him was evidently so terrifying that the man in the stocks immediately cowered and fell silent with his tears. But he was still trembling hard enough for John to see it.
This was a task which they performed almost every day. Charles not allowing any one else to touch his promised groomsbride so intimately. As if anyone might.
But he can't! Doesn't Sherlock see? /That/ is precisely what's wrong! He is suffocating and trapped and his chest is  not working and there's something wrong with his   a r m s...
John rolled his shoulder against a lingering pang.
/My John./
Bloody /deafening/ silence.
A look more peculiar than John had ever seen came violently over that long lovely face and with no preamble, warning, or response Sherlock simply stalked forward and held out his hands. He stooped over John's small body with eyes that were raging with starlight and waited for John to release him from his bonds.
"Oh, I don't think so. At least, I haven't heard him. But to be honest, I haven't heard a peep from either of you for the past two days. I thought you'd gone out on one of your cases. But it looks like staying in was the best thing for you. Now you sit right there and I'll bring you a nice cup of chamomile. What do you say?"
But none of them did.
"Very much so." John blurted. He had nearly said 'my Lord' but caught his tongue just in time. "That is...I have never worn such fine things in all my life. I do not know how I will ever repay you."
"I don't understand. What's going on?" John said.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed and with his free hand he pinched the leaking sieve that was John's nose, wiping away the mucus in arguably the most intimate act John had ever experienced with this madman. He wiped it off onto his pantleg and tipped his head in again, whispering. "I know."
The drums tapped softly. Page began to lob his voice as his ethereal guitar returned volley. The solo spiraled downward. The snares crashed. Licks swam. The beat stretched and wormed and found its place. "Don't leave me so confused." Page begged in the background and John could sympathise.
"Yes." Sherlock said absently, he was stroking his bottom lip with the tips of his forefingers. "How long do you think that deduction took? Saying, perhaps if you had clocked it. How long, do you think?"
John heard the strike of the match against the book, the hiss of a burgeoning flame and the sizzle of lit paper before he opened his eyes fully. His brain coming back to itself as he smelled smoke. "What do you think you're doing?"
Sherlock seemed to be satisfied with that, but John was too intrigued to let it go.
And it is in that moment that John knows.
"It certainly helps that I narrowed it down for them." Sherlock found his brain tugged in half by both paradigms. He snapped his fingers in agitation. "What are the main attributes for Lorazepam?"
But Sherlock seemed to feel him and chanced the smallest of looks his way, branding a message with the flash of his eyes that said 'no.' 'wait.'
"No." John stated suddenly as Sherlock reappeared. Arms laden.
With no more instruction than a wave of Charles' hand, they efficiently began to fill the tub in absolute silence. Charles' focus remained on Sherlock. "Undress now, my Prince. The quicker you are the warmer your bath will be."
"Right. Better not do that." It finally occurred to John that their walking had led them within proximity to Baker Street, but not heading directly towards it. "We're not going back to the flat?"
He caught Sherlock's smirk as the detective gravitated towards the second table.
(See the end of the chapter for
He rewarded himself by stretching out his feet just enough to where the tuberosity of his fifth metatarsal touched John's own tuberosity, clad as it was in ugly green and blue striped socks. He took a long pull and bowled into the last hurdle of John's patient waiting.
Really? He /really/ didn't know? Of course not. It was just a point on the map to him. "Sherlock. You were practically next door to the Queen!"
John started to think about the money in a new way as he stopped being surprised, figuring that if their client could willingly spend thirty thousand quid on some silly fish, surely he could spend a good chunk on their consulting services. "It could have died maybe? Disappeared in the tank? When I was six I remember I got a goldfish from the fair and I added to my sister's tank, she already had a bigger one. And one day he just, wasn't there. Harry told me later that her fish had been beating him up and then ate him after he died..."
It had been SO long since someone else had touched him in this way. His prick so much ignored, even by his own hand, that he'd hardly had a wank that he could describe as anything more than desultory since he'd come home. Languishing in hospital once the virus had cleared his bloodstream, ravished by fever, he had wallowed in the vast depths of his brokenness and isolation.
John was able to wait until Charles had turned his back and made it halfway down the hall before he had to throw out an arm to brace himself upright. He was dying. He was sure of it. It was only by his strength of will alone that he did not crumple to his knees.
He managed to towel off and make it upstairs wrapped in his robe. Even managed to change into a fresh vest and boxers, slip into his cool sheets, lay his head down on his crisp white pillow, and feign sleep for approximately 3.56 seconds before he simply couldn't /take it/.
He hasped out a terrible breath and stifled the urge to cough. He swallowed and swallowed against the sudden pain flaring bright in his throat, grimacing and massaging his neck with his fingers. God, he didn't want to admit it to  himself, but it had almost felt like this was the first symptom of getting sick. He eyed the petri dishes still piled on the table warily, but saw that they had all been closed and stacked according to some sort of organizational scheme. If he was truly becoming ill, he was going to /throttle/ Sherlock when he saw him again.
"Hospital. Steady as you can," Mycroft says to the driver and just as John's able to feel the effects of his drink take hold of him and begin to numb the pain, they're being spirited away.
He doesn't look back as he leaves Bart's. He can't. Not when he knows precisely how it will look to leave the love of his life lying on the floor.
"Needs must." John mused. Perfectly at ease with his roommate's more appalling hobbies. "Hang on. Haven't I seen this type of experiment before?"
"I've met someone, he's good for me.
It had been a surprise to them all when John'd finally been well enough to stand and then learned that he'd been too fucked up to accomplish it. MRIs and physical assessments had revealed no cause of the feebling musculature that was crippling him. No physical evidence. It was all invisible. Just like him.
"For you...well...if you wanted to go out to the pub or something. To chat someone up. Guy or girl. Doesn't matter."
As he spoke, John reached underneath and felt for the rugose pinch of his hole to prep him, feeling the taller man adjust his precarious position without the hand there to pull him forward anymore. "Hang onto me love. I have you."
Sherlock and John remained stock still when the door closed, both of them screaming with their eyes at each other, but knowing that the High Steward was cunning and could return at any moment. But the footsteps outside retreated until there was no more sound to be heard.
"Those eyes."
"It's alright." John soothed.
But what would Sherlock be expected to do tonight? The wooden cage around his groin was an absolute hindrance that had to be dealt with, but he had woken up sticky with John's name on his lips enough times to know what it meant and the general idea of what the outcome should be.
She had looked ready to take on the whole of Moriarty's Crusade herself, standing there.
"Absolutely not, Sherlock. You're not bringing case photos of dead people into the bed. No!"
The precipice at the edge of his property had a natural defense against gravity in the form of a crop of boulders. They told any wayward wanderer to wander no farther. And not to be outdone by nature, human hands had built a secondary edge of their own in the form of old oak fencing. Though it seemed more to make a point than to keep anyone safe.
Throughout his self-induced house arrest, John's illness persisted, never seeming to lessen or grow worse, only remaining stagnant enough to add a green tinge to each day. Sherlock, despite his own vow of silence, tended to John's needs with all due efficiency. But even John could tell that something was off with him. It seemed that everything was lacking its usual theatrics and commentary. He was much more subdued in his movements.
The little thrush jumped back upon the lentil as he shut the door to the adjacent room, watching him as he brought the lit candle and speared it down onto the candelabra near his bed and came to stand before the door to be ready when it swung wide.
Dislodging himself from his Prince, the High Steward stepped back as the mousy woman from the first day entered after she was bid. And John watched silently as all three people moved to the far side of the room, Sherlock and the High Steward disappearing behind the intricate triptych screen.
"It's just," she reached up and touched his neck with her fingertips, coming away red. "There's blood."
John only had a chance to frown.
CHAPTER (nine) NINE
"Yeah. Apparently I'm only good at two of those things."
"The bus's front passenger tire caught him first at full speed, rolling the body three times before the rear tire struck him again and pinned his lower body in place, well within the typical three second delay of unfocused human reaction, revealing to us that the driver had slammed on the brakes. Naturally. But by then it was too late. The catalyst of the body rolling in combination with the rear tire suddenly losing momentum wrenched the body 'round like an aluminum can." He spun his hands against each other for effect. "By which he ended up in his current position. I'd say the bus had to have been traveling at around sixty kilometers an hour to do something like that." His voice dropped reverently. "It's a rather beautiful cause and effect, in a way. What's your opinion on it Doctor Watson?"
"Yes."
"Thought you'd--oh Jesus," Without warning, Sherlock had dropped down onto his haunches, keeping a hand on John's thigh as he did so and doing something that brushed the inside of John's ankles with his other, keeping John suspended in anticipation and effectively left gasping when nothing happened except for the clatter of the cupboard's door. When Sherlock rose again, he was brandishing a half-empty bottle of baby oil that he'd scrounged up and John had to swallow the excess saliva pooling in his mouth at the images suddenly racing through his mind. "Thought you'd be upset."
"And yet you can't be persuaded to learn his name. It's /Greg/, Sherlock. Greg. Quit deleting it."
Spying something, Sherlock bent down and plucked up the picture of John and Bill that had been lost to the floor sometime last night, laying both it and the book gently onto his bedside table with incredible reverence.
"Sherlock believes himself to be indestructible and can do so because he has kept himself alone for most of his life. Not allowed anything or anyone to get close to him in any capacity. And yet, he has allowed /you/ that coveted position. Why? What's so special about an invalided army doctor?"
"Interesting?" John laughs a bit, figuring that that's the best he's going to get from a man that usually doesn't prefer sex. He himself though, is suffused with absolute pleasure. "I don't know why they don't recommend that in hospital for pain management. I can't feel anything." And it's true. There is not a single thing that hurts on him. Not with oxytocin pumping so vigorously.
The thrush's struggles were beginning to diminish now as more of its small body was excised. Its beak open and panting and soundless. Its eyes wet as the rising sun burnt behind it.
i'm hoping to have it finished by the Christmas special...so keep fingers crossed for that. next chapter's got A LOT going on it.
"Anyway. From there I was lead by a foot man to a private dining area where I was to be a participant in a poker game with three other guests. Two men and a woman."
"His Highness looks well." He said confidently and hoped that Sherlock heard the truth in it.
"You were angry." Sherlock said simply.
"You risk becoming another subject in that very short list, /John/."
It had really only been a matter of time before the Pusher would call again.
"What about you then David? What do you do for a living when wankers aren't disrupting your night?"
John makes an interrogative noise when it doesn't seem like he's going to elaborate.
John wiped slowly with the alcohol pads, letting the time between them fall away, letting his brain unspool as he had needed it to for a long while now.
"I've come to the conclusion that you wear your jumpers like they're your armour. They protect you in a sense. Protect your body and therefore your TRUE self from the outside world, but you haven't always done so, and that's what I found truly fascinating.
"Your brother is an adult, Mycroft. Even if you've lost the ability to see it. Let me out." John scowled, not able to stand another minute in the slowly rotating car. "Sherlock's fully capable of making decisions for himself and he doesn't need your constant supervision to get on in the world."
"It seems as though I owe you an apology Anderson." Sherlock said vacantly to the awaiting silence in the act of peeling off his gloves. He was lost in a far-away stare, looking upstream at a spot in the murky, icy water as if he could see through its dark depths. Missing the moment when all three of the other men's jaws dropped in unison.
And never will be.
"Jesusfuckingchrist!" John pants eloquently, "Jesusfuckingchrist..." He starts taking deep pulls in through his nostrils and letting them out of his mouth. Trying to calm his galloping heart.
"Yes John. You're far better off with me." Sherlock stood up straight, proud against John's quirked eyebrow. "In the time we've lived together I've cured you of your psychosomatic limp and have decreased the occurrences of your nightmares down to two to three per a bi-week interval. You've gained six pounds in muscle alone chasing my coattails. And all you need do is pay half the rent and write our cases up onto your blog. By my summation, and I'm sure it to be yours as well now; I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you."
From home, brother Michael had led John's borrowed horse on foot all the way through to Umberland Village. And when they reached the Manor, John had blown a heavy breath through his nose at the sight of William dressed and packed already upon horseback and had to fight back the burning tears that threatened his eyes.
Perhaps he was lucky. Or perhaps he was being punished.
"Well spotted doctor." Sherlock rubbed his hands together excitedly and arched an eyebrow as the whole of it dawned on his star pupil. "Where indeed?"
He wondered if Sherlock moaned, or if he wailed, or if he made no sound at all.
"Negative three. But I still don't see your point."
He did not see the surprised eyes Sherlock favored him with.
"I don't want their names. Just the number." Sherlock informed him curtly. There was a laden pause left to fill up the room between them and then he asked his next question almost as if under duress. "Would you like to ask me?"
"Yes. Me and Sherlock." John met the eyes of the older man as if he were about to protest. Finding himself stubbornly at ease with his feet beneath his shoulders in mimicry of parade rest, save for his occupied hands. A comfortable place.
"No. Thanks. I, um, I think I'll just walk it off, actually. Maybe go get some coffee from the cafeteria. Would you like one?"
"Sorry to interrupt," said a very familiar voice.
John licked his lips, unable to lie in face of his Prince. "H-he told me that I am not to leave your side again and that I will no longer be allowed to perform errands for you. My assignment keeps me here. In your company at all times."
"Hoo hoo. Thought I'd recognized that racket." Mrs. Hudson called on her approach, huffing slightly and smiling warmly as she crested their floor. "Looks like you boys have had a long morning, so I thought I'd just pop up for a quick visit while you're here."
She noticed one in particular and picked it up, admiring it with glassy eyes. It had a crude drawing of cycloptic monsters playing guitars in garish, thick lines. John recognized it as The Red Hot Chili Peppers' eponymous debut. "This band here, we saw them in concert, they were absolutely lovely back in the 80's. Frank got us tickets for my birthday.
At that, their eyes had been the meeting of two storms. A long practiced skill of reading each other through silence. Conveying messages while words lay unspoken and John hoped that above all else William understood that John was no longer angry at him. That William had been forgiven for breaking his heart.
The stocks gave the poor man no place to hide as he and it were ruthlessly pummeled.
Charles reached back down to gentle the cradle of wood now hanging unanchored between Sherlock's legs, rocking it a bit as though to help. To coax it from its tight hold. "Push." He instructed and despite being well practiced in this motion, Sherlock gasped as the piece fought to slide free from his body. It was a bit difficult given how long it had been in this time. But he managed it.
Advantageously, this was precisely the time the little brown thrush had a place to be.
With a pointed look, Sherlock was clambering over John's knees and out of the taxi like a dark flash, leaving John to pay and trundle slowly in after him as he shot up the stairs two at a time. If it hadn't been for the residual heat lingering on the back of his hand, John wouldn't have been so content to let Sherlock have a moment to get his thoughts together.
John launched himself up on his elbows at the sound of his name, momentarily disoriented. The room was strange, the smells were familiar but misplaced. The bed was facing the wrong way and too large and too soft and...oh.
He waited for the footsteps to fall into silence before groaning audibly into his hands. "Fuck."
Sherlock shrugged it away, flashing through the names again. Most of them were soldiers, written with their ranks next to them. Some were named 'unknown' and a couple simply left as blank spaces but for the dates of their deaths.
Gladstone yipped unhelpfully from the top as he found a better hold.
"I believe the term is 'versatile' and I might be."
"Excellent." Sherlock smiled openly and made his way over to the counter to pull on a pair of prophylactic gloves, a large black smock, and safety glasses Molly had laid out for him. He took up the proffered scalpel and waited for Molly and Lestrade to laboriously turn the body back over. "So. I assume we'll be employing the Rokitansky method..."
'Body found.' It read. 'Battersea Bridge. Thames. Come immediately.' - Anderson
"Not to worry. That is sufficient enough." The monk said, having ladled out some of the fragrant stew and handing a wooden bowl of it over. The aroma of cooked meat hit John like a lance and he had to fight his want to shove his face into the bowl and consume it that way. He only  just  managed to hold himself back from it.
"Alright alright." John wolfed down the sandwich, emptied the bottle and decimated the banana in record time, then found himself sitting awkwardly with his clothes in his hands and his body frozen in place. He looked at Sherlock expectantly.
John smiles at him. Large and loopily. Reaching his hand out as though he might be able to touch him from all the way over here.
"No." Sherlock said.
He felt a wave of nausea overtake him, bending him low enough for him to have to put a steadying hand out on the doorjamb and the other on his knee. Trying not to puke.
Sherlock seemed just as keen to change the subject. "What are you being so impatient for? Got a hot date?" He asked, snapping the "t" at the end for irritant's sake.
"What?" Light eyes come open. An occurrence akin to new galaxies being born.
John resumed his seat at the bar, signalling the barman over. What he wanted desperately was a good old fashioned pint to try and drown himself in, but he got something else instead. "I'll have another of those ...truffly things please."
"This." Sherlock proudly produced the rolled up glove that John had seen him secrete earlier from his pocket, pinch the item he'd hid securely, and hold it up. John had to twist a bit, but eventually he saw it in the light. It was a single strand of hair the color of bright copper about ten centimetres long.
"It appears to have gone missing."
There was always madness to Sherlock's methods.
"He already has." William had whispered and John's arms had dropped from around him in stunned shock. Tears finally spilling as he took a step back. Two.
John stopped bracing himself.
A woman entered wearing a plain gray dress with white sleeves. Her brown hair had been plaited and pinned across her hairline. In her hands was a clear glass flask with a wide mouth, a long neck, and a round base. She kept her eyes to the ground until she noticed that there was somebody else in the room.
"Would you like to come in? We're about to have dinner." Henry had offered instead/
He imagined the motions, the piston-like movements that would bring about his ruin. The in and out and in and out and   i n   and   o u t   and iiiiiiiinnn and oooouuuuutttt...
Sherlock was hunkered by the side nearest the door, apparently having snuck in at some point and grabbed a new wardrobe from his closet, because he was looking aggravatingly impeccable for four thirty in the morning. For as gangly as he seemed, Sherlock moved with incredible silence.
'Left at the skip. It's a shortcut.' - SH
Looking in, John could see that the spine itself had been detached roughly enough to crack a condyle, as if it had been wrenched from the man like a power cord from a socket. It left the ominous hole of his foramen magnum yawning strangely without his vertebrae to fill it.
Confident, Sherlock slid John's feet apart a little more, opening up his legs to allow a better view of his dark prize. The morning light snaking in through the edges of the curtains did plenty to illuminate his view. John waved his knees in a slow sort of flapping motion, allowing Sherlock to look but obviously uncomfortable with the idea.
Anderson, when they'd arrived, had been flapping about on the road, talking flamboyantly into his mobile. He must not have seen Sherlock and John exit the vehicle, or he would have been at them like an angry wasp by now.
And Sherlock certainly did not lack the mind necessary for extraordinary.
"There's been a body. Lestrade's asked for us."
"He doesn't like things over his face." Sherlock blurted suddenly and all three people startled a bit at his brusque voice. As if it were the fern that had spoke.
It was like pulling a snake out of its old skin. Each article removed revealing longer and longer stretches of desperately pale flesh that tightened instantly into goose flesh as it was met with warm air, his blood had retracted inwards to protect his core and left him looking almost gray.
John nodded absently, tucking the small package against his side and wondering at its contents. He was overcome suddenly with a flurry of questions about just who it was he would shortly becoming Captain to.
Charles smirked. Pleased to have peeked his interest. "You will have to wait and see . . . but first, you must be prepared." Charles moved back to the chamber door and opened it wide, revealing two servants carrying a large half barrel bath between them. Standing in a queue behind them was a line of ten more servants, all hefting two full buckets filled with steaming water. All ten servants were panting heavily, having had to run up all 17o steps from the kitchen on the main floor to bring him water that had started its journey boiling.
And it is in this moment, that Sherlock's eyes fly open. And his fingers splay before his chin. The madman has had an ace hidden up his sleeve this entire time. "Don't tell me you haven't noticed...
When he had made himself (and the bathroom mirror) once more decent, John reamerged fully dressed to find the flat awaiting him in a comfortable quiet. The television had been turned on in the sitting room, but turned down low, reminding him that there was a bigger, broader world still going on normally outside the walls of 221B despite its enitre axis having shifted irrevocably.
Unlike the hallway, there is no white. Instead /everything/ is saturated with red damask. The only respite in colour is the cream and gold ceiling that curls and scrolls like inside-out cathedral tops and the gold-framed portraits the size of small cars hanging up on the walls.
Both of them deserved to know one brief moment of love before their lives fell to utter ruin.
"In preparation. I can't...I don't...please John!! I /had/ to." He let Sherlock down at a glacial pace, the end of the sentence happening the same instant John's corona efficiently stoppered Sherlock's plied hole. Sherlock whined again.
"It is one of Mendelssohn's better ones." Sherlock accepted the praise in his own way, sounding slightly out of breath.
He sipped at his poncy drink as he let his eyes casually roam the other side of the lounge behind him through the bar's mirrored wall, half hoping the long dark figure he'd left standing in the throng would just magically materialize behind him like he seemed so often to do. Most preferably in fast pursuit of someone John could take out his aggression on, if he were to be truly honest.
Standing up, wringing out his beard, John mounted and kicked his horse southward. Not allowing himself to look back until he had reached the very edge of Baker Town's borders. It was only then that he twisted back in his saddle, looking to the sky to try and rebuild his confidence for the journey ahead.
"Stop talking then. Losing all your hot air's not doing you any good." He debated the warming IV again in his head, finding it easy to ignore the scowl he recieved, as it was somewhat lessened by the racking tremors coursing through the great wet git. "It'll be a bloody miracle you don't get sick from this."
CHAPTER (an) ONE
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been.
He let the levity of it settle before adding, "that being said, I took the liberty to include the WHOLE of his medical history in that folder, should you wish to illuminate yourself; from his psychiatric evaluations as a child, to the discharge papers from his multiple times in rehabilitation, to his current blood work taken as recently as six months ago. I trust that you will provide a properly thorough and unbiased medical evaluation when making your decision about how best to deal with how to proceed on such ...delicate matters."
"Well?" Sherlock asked impatiently, if not a little worriedly, when he was met with silence. "John?"
"Why? What difference would that have made?"
Henry opened his mouth to speak, but just then, William had stepped up behind him and slid his hand into his husband's, giving it a little squeeze.
The creep of exhaustion, which had been dogging him since the hall, makes its move into the empty space left inside him and blooms wide, overtaking everything.
They seemed to be partaking in a volley of question and answer, occasionally dropping what John believed to be the word 'peppermint' in English every so often, which made it even more confusing. The two men who had flanked the man speaking had remained standing and John guessed them to be some sort of body guards. And drawing back to Sherlock's pointed address to the client as 'Chairman Asano-san' when he'd come in, John surmised that he was possibly someone of importance.
"It was interesting. Yes."
"Mm." Sherlock sighs as he slips off. "There's a Buffalo Bill joke in there somewhere, but I'm too tired."
"I'll leave you now to sort it out, whatever it is you have going on. But don't get worked up on my account." Sherlock's voice was subdued, already walking away. "Goodnight John."
He is safe again. THEY are safe.
As his eyes adjusted to the brightness and took in the person before him, this person he was to serve for the rest of his days, John stopped breathing altogether.
And he chose then what was in his nature. Doing what they always had done. He turned away and disappeared.
John was incredibly staunch in his spending habits. He took vigilant care of their finances. Though he never confronted Sherlock about dubious purchases, only adjusted for them and moved on. It was his money that he'd earned doing cases, after all.
Sherlock's strong brow was crinkled in confusion.
"Certainly not." Sherlock smiled. "That was ...chance."
They both felt the thrill that went through John when he said that. And, taking that as a cue, Sherlock leaned in even closer, so close that John could feel Sherlock's breath on the hairs of his beard, his voice falling into a dark whisper at his throat.
And Sherlock makes sure to look into each of John's eyes too.
But Sherlock did not. His fucking only became more desperate, his head shaking in denial and he continued to pound himself down onto John's hard prick. Like a punishment. Driving his lithe body up and down, up and down like some sort of manic organic mechanacian. Frantic and desperate, to the point where it was almost unpleasant. And from the awful grimace painting his face and the terrible sounds hiding in his closed mouth, John had had enough.
She's finally dead.
When he rose, the King's eyes had finished scouring his person, but he gave no indication as to whether he had found any fault.
Donovan looked to John as if he should know better than to take a supporting role as opposed to a wallflower. She issued a harsh breath of disbelief. "And /you/. You haven't learned your lesson at all, have you? You're just happy as a clam to run around after 'im 'til he gets you blown up, aren't you?!" Her face was in a snarl, but her eyes were two desperately imploring black pools. It was clear then that she'd found out about the bomb vest, or if she hadn't, it'd been a damn good guess. "You're just waiting for the time when he pushes it - pushes YOU - too far, is that it? Hanging on for the day when someone like me says 'I told you so' even if, by then, it's too late for you to hear them?"
John squeezed his eyes shut as Sherlock sank deeper. Residual tears pinching loose to trickle down his temples, getting lost in John's hair. "Say it John." Sherlock pushed in up to the second knuckle, hooking his finger ever so slightly to press into the soft walls of his bowel, brushing against every nerve he could find, wanting to drive him to abstraction.
Trusting his small smile, John looked down at his reflection in the milky water between his knees and took in what all the others had seen. He looked exhausted. Sunken. Bearded and bedraggled. And on top of it all, mud encrusted.
"Don't move for a second." He squeezed out a dollop on his ring finger and smeared it over the angry wound, taking care to press some against the cut along his scalp as well, keeping as little as he could out of the wild, wet curls. "There."
He let out an incredulous scoff in the night and his phone pinged again before he could get cold thumbs to poke out a rebuttal.
John curled his small body more tightly into the tub, readying himself for dismissal. Naked and ashamed he would be sent away, just like he deserved.
It was here that the thrush took momentary rest upon a merlon, a large rectangle of stone that made up one of the crenellations on the outer curtain of the castle. A place for archers to hide while they reloaded. Perfectly placed above the dead-ground.
High Steward Charles Magnussen came up behind him quietly, appearing over his shoulder just as he felt gentle fingers tease a couple of curls on his head.
The poor creature was obviously beyond terrified.
To John, the entire endeavor had felt like a dream.
Sherlock raised a tentative eyebrow, watching Molly's face flush to a very bright pink. "Yes," he said slowly, driven into further confusion by her small shriek of joy and subdued gambol. "I've got a couple hours before we need to leave. Do you have any objections John?" He looked pointedly over to the hiding man, but merely received a shrug in return. John wasn't aware of anything else they had going on.
John wandered over to see, "you mean /yours/ are the only good ones?" He was a little annoyed that Sherlock had taken his project away, but he guessed it was better than having the madman sulk.
The dirt road had turned to mush beneath John's horse's hooves. Puddles of water building up in the ruts. John avoided the largest of them while leading his horse by the reigns and asked every person he came across if they knew of anyone who sold the devil's foot.
"Ex-CERE-bration, Greg. /Excerebration/." John corrected with a little smirk. "It means the removal of the brain."
He could hardly fathom it.
Breaking into his reverie, there came a little hum from the back of the room and the soft slide of parchment across a box. Sherlock was taking steps towards him by the time John had opened it.
Sherlock smirked. "Not then." He reached into the internal breast pocket of his coat and produced an expensive  eggshell coloured envelope with intricate black calligraphy on the front. 'Sherlock Holmes' it read simply.
And then a thought occurred to him suddenly, which prompted an attack. "What /is/ it with your ridiculously prejudicial views on wealth, John! I'm already well aware of your coming from destitution, seeing as how you beat me over the head about it every time we get a bill! Is it really so important to you? Does it comfort you to consistently remind yourself of your rank in the monetary system juxtaposed against me? Yes. I had money. There, I said it. Are you happy? If you're about to tell me how my being birthed into a higher social class should have had more of an influence on my chosen vices--"
John blinked, but did not need to consider it. He licked his lips. "What's the item?"
It's a thought that nearly cannot be borne.
One where they had left Henry waving goodbye to them from his front step.
Sweat trickled down his temple in anticipation.
And in their blinding happiness, neither men deigned to notice that of the twenty-odd-headed flytrap left abandoned on the sink's wet edge to silently witness them; seven of those heads had snapped shut to simultaneously feast upon meals most unnatural to them.
"So?"
"Christ." Goose pimples rose on John's arms as he shuffled into the kitchen with the daily papers. Starting the cafetiere and setting out two mugs, pleased to find that he only had to move a morning star and a tube of dialectic grease off their tall stele side table to reclaim it from the scourge of science.
John squared himself. "I didn't say I had to regret it. I'm just responsible."
Huffing out a laugh he very much needed to release, John turned his head to nose into Sherlock's hair. His breath catching short as he felt Sherlock release his towel with a flick and leave him standing naked once again.
John's hand went to his forehead, his fingers pinching his temples. A sad sigh deflating him. "So does starvation-" looking up, he realized that his Prince was misunderstanding him, to go by the naked fear only growing in Sherlock's eyes.
"But he has John." Harriet had said all the more ardently, looking up from where she was fastidiously  slicking the armour piece by piece with ox urine and then summarily soaking it with oil, getting the dark metal to shine without light. "He's going with you. Whether you like it or not. You won't talk him out of it."
"Well of course it is." Sherlock leaned in, almost conspiratorially, still clasping the LED puck in thin fingers, "upon doing some research to find a proper summarization, I've found that what we have can be best described as a facultative symbiosis."
Sherlock went stoically on. "Given the brutality of this man's injuries I believe we both know who it was that did it. The killer was there that night, stalking you. And as jealous as I was of your casual conversation with the man at the bar, the Pusher apparently took it a step farther."

The YouTube video showed a bank of identical ten gallon aquariums stacked up three across and four high on a metal rack, side by side. It looked like a back room containing what Sherlock had previously described as a cache of 'hospital' tanks. The camera operator took their time panning from one tank to another, showing each one's occupants for a certain length of time. It passed from small yellow fish making laps, to the next one housing a large blue fish with small flapping fins, to another with a pile of rocks and a tentacle disappearing into it, and then up to medium sized orange fish bobbing clumsily in place and so on.
Ten times over the course of the next six years they took their plea for marriage to the Lady of the Manor. And each and every time she refused them.
Sherlock snorted in further distaste, his mouth curling up into a grimace. "By God's bones, not that. Anything but that." And then it became suddenly clear to John that that is what Charles called him.
It was somewhat surreal, to be suddenly out of those small confined places of John's bedroom and the bathroom, where they had been sharing things so desperately intimate, and to know that the same feelings were still being carried between the both of them. That the presence of a wider space could do nothing to quell such happiness and make them no less palpable in the full light of day.
"Jesus! Are you wearing a plug?" He paled at the tenacity with which Sherlock had wanted to immolate himself just moments before and how they'd just barely skirted disaster. "Did you forget?"
The lick of dark in the dim of the window turned his head, acknowledging the small creature with newly opened eyes that seemed to shine with no light, the color of the moon. And with a shifting only seen between the black shapes of the ephemera around him, a single candle was lit with the flick of firesteel.
"Well," John sighed, the brevity in Sherlock's voice told him that the Prince had thought long and hard about his circumstances and had seen his way through every possible result. And he also knew that if a man this smart had had the opportunity to escape, he would have. Prince Sherlock did not need some lowly knight to rescue him. "I wouldn't be able to bear those outcomes either."
The video had no audio so Sherlock talked right over it, fidgeting where he stood like he couldn't contain his excitement. "The fish never disappeared because it never left. Do you see?" His long, pale face was lit from below by the screen, appearing almost manic. "The entire house was locked, guarded, monitored, and by all accounts impregnable. No one came or went. The perfect crime. A locked room mystery for the ages. This is a video I found on the internet for illustrative purposes."

A warmth bloomed in John's chest at that. Sudden and bright. His throat tightening until it made his queued up remark nothing but a click. He felt frozen in place, staring at his friend whose obliviousness could only be trumped by his observational skills. Sherlock Holmes content in the knowledge that John's name was enough. That /John/ was enough. It was heartening, to say the least.
"We were in formation; Murray and I had the prisoner between us, this kid, a nineteen-year-old Lance Corporal flanked us. And the two others were ahead, scouting for IEDs. Just...normal stuff."
Lestrade greeted them as the elevator doors opened to the basement, looking pensive. He fell into step as they headed for the far end, catching them up on the particulars. Three sets of shoes snapped rhythmically down the large, empty corridor.
"Then I guess I'll call you with the laptop when I get there then. Try it out?" It's Sherlock's turn to hum and John bends down to seek out the bottom half of his face so that he can get a proper kiss from it. The kiss lingers, then deepens, and John has to physically wrench himself away from Sherlock's impossible lips. They are constantly trying to draw him down like quicksand.
"Hang on a minute," a thought struck John and Sherlock took notice. The intricacies of the night coalescing. "Did you just hold up a death investigation to /impress/ me?"
The filmy, earl gray warmth of dawn was creeping into the windows of Baker Street now. Telling John that he had slept soundly throughout the entire night. A rare occurrence anymore.
John watched, numb, as he saw the tired old man pull a large broom from his cart and begin to sweep the mess from the dirt.
"Huh." Was all John could manage. He was flayed, absolutely truly exposed clear down to a feeling akin to having had his /bones/ opened up to have his marrow be read by a soothsayer.
"Good." John said, satisfied, and the folder fell with a thunk into the fire.
He had approached the village on horseback, with his army of a thousand women and men making camp in the fields. As if they intended to stay. The streets had deserted themselves at his approach. No man or woman willing to come and face him until John, having fallen heavily into drinking by that time, had stumbled out from the local pub on his way home and almost bumped right into Moran's horse.
"Um..." Lestrade shook himself out of his trance finally, shifting on his feet. "Sure. Yeah. Please. Black, if you would."
And given his position in the castle now for the last four years, it was a rather fair description. He seemed to be content in waiting for Appledore to die in its languish, so that he may feed from its offering.
As John maneuvered in, he noted that the head had been left with a strip of the neck flesh still hanging loose beneath it. The front, where the man's esophagus would have been was longer than in the back, as if the victim's head had been tipped back when the decapitation had been made.
What he saw first was the squad car lights ricocheting against the buildings and as he sidled up to the barrier tape there were a handful of people huddled together, gesturing in hoary clouds of emphatic breath. Met officers scratched at their notepads, taking eye witness accounts and trying to piece together what had actually happened.
"The entire time he was perfect, totally calm when I couldn't be. Me, the bloody doctor. He um...he kept whispering to me before I passed out. Over and over. Za ta sara meena kawom. Za ta sara meena kawom. Za ta sara me--" his voice cracked in his throat, having to swallow around the jagged words. "We use to say it to each other when we knew we wouldn't be overheard...back when--"
He leaned in closely. Until there was nothing but his tilted, sky-coloured eyes for John to see. He was everything in his vision.
John shifted on his feet. "Well then when were you planning to--"
It stopped at the cracked open doorway, taking up a small stone that had been set down for it and clacked it once, twice, against the floor.
"I am." Sherlock said, meeting his eyes. "But it's customary to have a post-coital cigarette. Don't you keep up on current trends?"
Sherlock nods, sniffing.
As he came nearer, the details of that pale rock began to become more discernable. Transmogrifying to include bumps and definitions he hadn't been able to see previously. And when he realized what exactly it was that he was /actually/ seeing, he frowned deeply. "That's not a body."
It had obviously taken in incredible amount of time and effort to get these kind of results in a detachment. And to such a degree of cleanliness. It was simultaneously unnerving and intriguing.
"He just kept pressing the old bastard that something was wrong, on and on and on. Well, of course no one's going to listen to a kid, especially not one with ideas that were bigger than himself, so he starts ignoring his calls. Gregson does that and Sherlock ends up showing up /at his office/, raving on about how the kid's shoes are missing. Trying to make it an issue."
"Talk about what?" Sherlock tried to be nonchalant, but when he raised his head, he looked immediately ensnared.
It was clear then that Henry had known of William's participation in John's recovery and had continued to allow it, given his silence on the matter.
Sherlock tilted his head back upright and fingered his hair, getting it to fall precisely without even having to look in a mirror. With the bandage covered, he looked immaculate as ever sitting straight-backed and proud. "With the lights off and the alarm pulled, it was difficult to tell. Though given the strength of the swing and the height it was at. It's safe to assume that it was one of the men. It was quite helpful that the exits were clearly marked, however, it made it possible to make my escape and return home."
Their lips pressed hard, touched softly, broke apart and rejoined. Tiny moans finding the small spaces in between.
Something in John clinches at the sound of Sherlock's voice and the way that Sherlock's shoulders curl in as if John is about to do or say something that will break him utterly.
"By me."
At this Sherlock was eternally grateful. Able to play his part as an object all the better.
"To bed."
"Not my style." Sherlock replied coolly.
follow my
He passed the photo back with a nod, drifting hopelessly again as the client's hand thwacked at the photo and his voice grew higher in volume. Irritated. Sherlock's baritone remained passive however, though not to the point where it sounded as if he was bored, which he was more than willing to use should a client fail to meet his steep standards of interest. He'd brought his fingertips together against his chin in the usual manner he did when he was thinking, a habit long fashioned of practice.
John snorted. "I think we might be able to arrange that."
The first cautious breach had John releasing a strangled groan and quickly realizing that Sherlock was starting out with /two/ fingers. He was even more surprised by the fact that without much effort that taut little muscle was  welcoming them at once, as he had apparently already loosened it considerably in the shower.
John turned back at the sound of his crisps dropping and fished them out, before heading back to his office, just expecting Sherlock to follow. He turned off the radio completely while Sherlock surveyed his office with a wandering eye, inspecting everything in the manner that was over in a matter of seconds.
"I've already taken care of it. You're being too slow." Sherlock said with a look of distaste. "Come on. Come on!" John didn't know if the detective was refering to him or the incoming cab.
John began walking again. Not willing to spend a night in the cold dithering on about semantics. It was a few paces before the detective easily caught back up and fell into step with him. Damn his long gait.
She lurches backwards through the curtain without another word. Fleeing from the room. From an illness she will never recover from.
Feathers tickled Sherlock's neck as Charles nuzzled in, careful not to smear his white makeup.
"It's nothing your Highness." John addressed to his feet, shame burning through him.
"You are a conscientious lover, one who puts other's pleasure above your own. Just as you do your life. You are a student of medicine and therefore have considerable knowledge as to the delicacies of human anatomy. A man with deadly fingers and the familiarity of each and every erogenous zone. Clever combination.
John surfaced slowly, skimming the world just between consciousness and sleep, but still caught in the undercurrent of blissful release. His brain kept getting pulled under, only to flash back above like flint against metal, trying to ignite.
The thrush outside made one more violent thrash for freedom. Not aware of its own demise.
"Hannibal Lecter was supposed to have been taking MAOIs for his personality disorder during the time he told Clarice Starling that line. And, as you well know by being a doctor, patients taking these medications are put on restrictions concerning high-tyramine foods; specifically liver, beans, and red wine, in the event that such a combination can prove to be fatal.
With his head bowed so low, John was unaware of the look that passed between the High Steward and the Prince at William's words.
He's left in this uneasy fog of questions until they're headed back to Baker Street, each of them sitting side by side but too far apart in the back seat of a cab looking silently out the opposite windows. John contemplates Sherlock's hesitance. Watches Sherlock's contemplative reflection, the way his knuckles are pressed to his lips.
"Our way back?" John tried. But the man was already headed for the cruck house, leading his horse along and did not bother to answer.
Sherlock was, above all things, pleased.
And what would Sherlock have to say about it? Something cutting? Something embarrassing? Something blaming?
And Sherlock is infinitely careful not to collapse straight down onto John when he pulls out. He rolls onto his side with one hand cupped into a fist and propped up on its elbow.
He looked to his scotch for guidance, licking his lips.
Later that morning, still accosted by silence, John tried again at Sherlock's door. He was certain at one point that he'd heard the detective's mobile hastily being silenced mid-ring, which had only made John's confusion click up into bewildered frustration.
"Just a fire axe." Sherlock added unhelpfully.
"Ta." John kissed him. Initiating the contact between them for the first time since they'd agreed to this as something more than a chaste peck. He kissed him deeply, making sure to press his lips against his friend long enough and firmly enough to release the coiled tension in Sherlock's muscles. Feeling it fall from his body like a caul.
The shiny pink underside of the glans bobbed forth, penultimately freed from its heavy blanket of skin and like a brace hitching up the tight silvery flesh, the delicate bridge of the frenulum pulled taut true to form what had just been a jumble of docile flesh. Up and up it rose, blunt and hot until the member grew too tall, too heavy and proud and tipped like a felled tree to thump softly against John's belly. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. Even Sherlock could appreciate the organic mechanics of the human body when he chose to.
"Sherlock. I swear to God. You'd better stop talking right this minute." He hissed. A quagmire of emotions bubbled inside him. Denial, longing, shame, obstinacy, dismissal, and just the tiniest breath of appreciation. He didn't know whether Sherlock was being true to his word or was just miming something that he thought maybe John would want to hear in his moment of panic. The man was quite daft when it came to social cues, after all.
"A gift?" He said, sliding the vial carefully back into its sheath lest he should disturb it in some way unknown to him.
"Sherlock." John said harshly, unwilling to budge. "You're having a strop, not thinking. Be nice."
"I'm sorry John." Sherlock said quietly, his head turned away. He was looking out the window, trying to disappear into the vast pale sky beyond the diamonds.
He was still mumbling as John's fist flexed dangerously next to his thigh.
In the time it took for him to swipe his palm down his face, Sherlock was on the move, expecting him to follow.  "Let's get rid of our coats and have some drinks, shall we?"
'Dear Mr. Holmes,
The scream that the Union Jack neck man had made before is nothing compared to the one he makes now. It is loud. It is high. And it is /afraid/. His hand is cupped next to his face, his dislocated eye cradled in his palm as he goes shrieking out of the room.
"No."
The last time John had been out in this capacity, had been when he'd gone to a pub with his old mates before his first deployment. Back then it had been about getting pissed enough to drown the anticipatory butterflies that had making a cyclone in his belly since the day he'd been told he was being shipped out. They'd been tossing up a tempest at his utter realization that he'd /actually/ be traveling to the Middle East, dropping straight down into the middle of the war zone in the effort of helping others to survive it.
Sherlock had shrugged nonchalantly. "Eight hours, approximately. More than I could possibly need."
Time seemed to suspend itself in that moment as he had looked down at this crying man.
"They're yours?"
Something glows in John's pelvis to hear Sherlock so innocent. To know that they may be on the verge of discovering something yet again new together. A new colour of feeling they had not known they shared. "Neither have I. Not this way. Do you want to try? We don't have to--but I would very much like--"
"Run over?" Sherlock asked, almost hopefully.
Through the magnifying glass, John could see that the bottom edge of the cut was smooth, suggestive of having been made with an incredibly sharp knife, possibly even a medical blade in one long, concentrated stroke. Which of course meant that it had to have been performed when the man had been unconscious or even dead, as no signs of a struggle were evident.
And he'll remember this.
That familiar broad smile once again bloomed across the monk's face and he gave a whole-hearted chuckle before patting John's his greave bemusedly before giving no answer at all.
It felt so natural to be this way together, despite it only being the very beginning of their time alone. But they had already shared so many intimate moments, and then there was tonight...
"I'll be in there with you."
With some trepidation, he described how had met Moran at the edge of his village, in a state far more sober than he wished to have been, and admitted now to Sherlock alone as to his having had absolutely no plan whatsoever as to what he was going to do.
It was unwillingly losing himself to the drug. His body going lax without his consent. His mind suddenly refusing to care.
"Then why?" Prince Sherlock asked quietly, rhetorically, nearly in a whisper. His eyes searched through John for an answer that he would not find. "Why were you sent here of all poor souls? What terrible thing could you have possibly done to be given such a cursed fate?"
The Queen Mother only shrugs minutely. "It's certainly possible. I don't know. It's probably out of a Miss Marple episode for all I know. But it's what he insisted on."
Sherlock blinked rapidly.
John tries not to stare, but he's not very good at it.
The notes rang out again as if they were a death rattle. Soft but trill. Calming and dancing and slicing and wobbling before sprinting away in jaunty gaiety only to become bruised with darker notes as it reached its climax. And much too soon, as it always did, the end came. Twelve hard minutes of brutal beauty filling the flat only to cease and be swallowed up by the heavy silence. As disappeared as a life written in invisible ink.
Sherlock was gone from his eyes again, though his gaze stayed locked on the instrument. It was the same look he had had on that first day when John had stayed with him silently for hours until he had found his way back. It was intriguing to watch Sherlock's body become a vacant shell, but it hurt John to think that he had unintentionally put Sherlock in this somber mood.
"Uh, very small rocks?" Lestrade said dead-pan and John couldn't help the giggle that pulsed out of him.
He stood to his full height, looming very closely with his back towards the window that showed Molly and Lestrade chatting over the corpse. And John could do nothing but stand frozen, jaw slack, as one long hand swooped in and took him gently by the back of the neck, while the other was pressed around the side of his hip.
"You know of the battle?" John shifted more to get a better look at his Prince, confused as to why a squabble so insignificant as his should reach the ears of Castle Appledore.
A vulture, too large in size, would come down to land heavily upon Mycroft's corpse. Filling the world with the scream of crumpling metal and shaking the ground beneath Sherlock's feet under its weight.
When he returned more presentable to polite company and balancing four coffees in a carrier, he found Lestrade standing as if in sentry outside the autopsy room door. His trench coat made him seem formidable, but his soft features showed his true intent.
The look on the detective's face was genuine enough to dispel most of John's anger, because it meant that it /had/ at least affected him in some way, and John sagged like a bag losing air. "Look." He said more gently. "I'm not trying to be an arse here. What happened is already done with, we can't change it. The real point I'm trying to make is that next time, whatever the circumstances, just include me, alright? I would like for us to work together." He made sure to hold Sherlock's eyes, driving home his sincerity. "I am with you. One hundred percent. Alright?"
As they approached the entrance to Baker Town, they could see a tall thin man sat upon a white horse with a crown upon his head. Given his stature, his long robes, and the two Royal guards flanking him, it was clear that this was King Mycroft. The ruler of the land himself had chosen to greet them.
"Did he say they were /kissing/?" Molly mewled, standing by Lestrade's shoulder looking pale. Her knuckles were tight around the clipboard she was about to snap in half and her face twisted into an ugly mix of jealousy and disbelief.
"I was just going to grab something on the way home. Unless you're in the mood to go out. Clearly you're in the mood to go somewhere." John stated.
"You, as a child, would have then witnessed the resultant discourse would have had upon your family and chosen very consciously to suppress any 'unnatural' feelings you might have had towards other men, choosing to burden yourself with becoming the quintessentially upstanding young man your father looked on you to be before your mother's death. In essence, Harry's coming out drove you to seek a medical profession and later to enlist in the Army in an effort to live up to expectations set upon yourself by you and your father combinedly."
Lestrade settled elegantly into this new understanding, nodding. "Sure. Yeah, of course. Though when you two do decide you'd like to make an announcement...can, um, will you warn me before hand? I'd like to get a video of Donovan and Anderson's reactions."
"Uh-huh. Tilt." John went about his work, pulling on nitrile gloves and manipulating Sherlock's head as if it were on a convenient swivel, tipping it onto his freshly papered shoulder. The old bandaging came off easily, completely saturated with blood and John did his best cleaning it with sterilized wipes. It took some manic rubbing to get it out of his hair.
"So can't we just follow the suit back to the tailor? Get John Doe's information from them?" Lestrade became more enlightened and more weary as he listened.
23 . . . 62 . . . 89 . . . 125 . . . 163 . . .
But Sherlock was nearly diaphanous now. See-through and threaded out on the blanket beneath John with only the most gossamer of existence to keep him tethered to earth. Tethered to John, and John alone.
Sherlock swallowed down the longing for those words to be true.
John was a man of facts and figures, as much as Sherlock was. Able to line things up in a row and tackle them one by one. His military medical training had taught him the delicate, merciless art of triage and he decided to take the simplest task at hand and apply himself to it, with whatever energy he had left. Give himself a break and tackle something inherently simple.
"Sherlock?" John's brain boiled with questions as he came bounding back up the stairs, but the man was nowhere to be found. He heard a door shut just as he slid open the ones to the kitchen, frowning. As if he'd purposely vacated the scene at John's approach. The brain was still in chunks on the table and left abandoned like some poor monster. Forming a gelatinous substance around its base. John's laptop was gone.
He came back to himself as the sitting men began to rise to their feet, realizing too late that his gaze had fallen on Sherlock and had left him staring blankly into the middle distance. But if the detective noticed this at all, he gave no indication.
Sherlock shrugged. "Certainly."
He was interrupted by Sherlock's quiet laughing and it only tapered out when he realized John was goggling at him in offense. "You're assuming my impotence stems from a previous traumatic sexual experience?" John frowned more deeply, not understanding. When Sherlock met his eyes again the smile had faded completely. "You're mistaken."
It wasn't the suit necessarily that John objected to; after all, it was a gorgeous three-piece bespoke cut from the same bolt as all the previous victims' had been. It fit him like a second skin and seemed to rival even what John had seen of Mycroft's wardrobe by a few hundred quid. So it wasn't that.
John's breath comes out shaking when he speaks next. His voice gruff. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Sherlock. But I have to do this. I have to make this alright. And the only person I am NOT willing to sacrifice is /you/. I just can't. So I'm going to solve this and I'll come back to you and we'll grow old together, alright? But right now I have to fix this. On my own."
The bird hopped forward.
John had milled about him with pointed glances and admiring stares, straightening things up. But not overly much. It was all quite a grand distraction. "That was gorgeous." He ejaculated, unable to help himself.
"But it didn't work."
"You're nothing but obvious. That's, I think, why I find you so intriguing."
Sweet little baby, I want you again./
But John is already walking away at a clipped pace, his thumbs poking at his phone as his neck prickles with the feeling of being watched as he slips between the streetlights. He glances out of the corner of his eye at a zebra crossing and sees every shadow loom suspiciously larger. He knows he's being followed but fortunately nothing more menacing than the bitter cold materializes.
"What! That's it? You're LEAVING! What are we to do now? Question every dentist in London? See which ones have pulled teeth in the last two days!" Anderson screeched, appalled. "That's impossible to go on!"
By the time they drew up to the base of the cliff, they had lost sight of the castle completely, so sheer was the rock face. This was as close as Baker Town came to Appledore.
To his left, John could hear Sherlock just inside his bedroom and when he shifted his weight to peek into the open doorway, found Sherlock standing profile before his open wardrobe, seemingly contemplating his clothes. He had just finished peeling off his wet black shirt and was hanging it up to dry. Long limbs moving slowly and broad hands carefully spreading the sopping fabric over the hangar. His hair still glistened with clinging moisture, though the curls had begun to resume their weightlessness once more.
"DENTIST? Oh that's a bloody /fine/ coincidence! What the hell Sherlock! You trying to take the Mickey out of me?" Lestrade realized quickly what was happening. He knew he was stuck here to meet the incoming forensics team, and knowing that Sherlock knew that as well, made it all the less palatable. Sherlock was going freelance and there was nothing he could do to stop him. "If you've got a lead I need to know it! You can't just swan off! Sherlock! You're suppose to be helping me!"
It had made his childhood a nightmare and his adolescence difficult. He had even foolishly wielded it as what he had thought to be an advantage in those first one thousand days in this tower, but instead it had become the main reason that he had fallen into despondency.
Sherlock looked confused. "But you shot him /because/ of me."
Sherlock startles into action, dropping to his knees beside the chair to even out their height and taking care to blow across the mug before tilting it delicately to John's lips. Not letting a single drop go astray.
Until the High Steward put himself physically between them.
This inaction seemed to displease Prince Sherlock further. "Rise then! On your feet! I've no time for idiots."
Sherlock Holmes had given him a rock.

"Payment. For Harriet and Clara. To clear all their debts forthwith."
And all of a sudden the High Steward was pressing out the door, carrying before him a tray laden with a golden plate that overflowed with a myriad of fruits, vegetables, various breads, and three different kinds of meats.
It was his giant palm clamping over John's nose until his mouth opened desperate for breath, followed by the two fingers hooked in his cheek to keep him from biting down. It was the terrible taste of the man's hands as they pried up his tongue and swabbed the pre-crushed pill all around the pink parts of his mouth.
"So there, that's the part you didn't know. The me right after Afghanistan. A wreck. It all goes a bit gray after that."
It strung out all the amazing and terrible and wonderful things that his life had suddenly become since his moving in with this madman. How only four months previous, he'd been sitting in his therapist's office, pathetic as a mongrel with a cane he didn't truly need, having trust issues and claiming that nothing ever happened to him.
John shook his head honestly. "No."
And again he moved.
He CANNOT escape.
She uncoupled the wire from the base with some effort and then with more mumbling, looked up, "oh!" She startled and nearly dropping the mechanism at the sight of the huddled men. "Good morning everyone!"
"Oh ta." John thanked him. "I can pinch closed a squidgy artery, god knows. But apparently managing a pair of sticks is beyond my skill." He happily tucked into his meal then, learning and readjusting as he went, quickly getting the hang of it. The hunger and the cold and the stress made the oily, salty, richness of the food absolute heaven.
Which only caused John's further confusion. "What?"
"Ah Lestrade, how nice of you to join us." Sherlock was saying, adjusting his coat back around his lithe body. "We were just enjoying your indictment on the telly before it was so rudely interrupted. Beautiful day to find another corpse, wouldn't you say? How's Gregson?"
From inside, there was the sound of one raised voice. Deep and startling and clearly displeased before Charles' eerily calm one cut in in attempt to placate it. The murmur continued for a moment longer before falling silent.
The head's eyes were closed and its tongue jutted out to an extreme length, nearly touching its jawline, almost as if the man (because it WAS most definitely a man) had been killed by strangulation and it had forced the tongue up his nonexistent neck.
"I don't remember the actual impact; just...one minute I was up and the next I wasn't and Murray was there with his red teeth and behind him the sky was purple and I honest to Christ thought I was hallucinating. My body felt so heavy and I kept trying to get up, but Murray was laying on top of me asking me what to do. 'What do I do? Tell me what to do John.' I knew it was bad if he was using my first name like that. You don't-- I fought, I remember, trying to get him to let me up, but he wouldn't let me see. He was ripping through my kit and started packing gauze into my shoulder and I was just trying not to black out. I think he stuffed in a whole roll.
Caddyshack's right leg was hitched up with John's help and held tight across John's hips. His face smashed against John's cheek hard enough to bend his glasses askew as his lips were puckered enthusiastically to plant a crushing kiss onto the doctor's temple. An act that had produced a fool hearty smile on the young Captain Watson.
William came up along side John. "Shall we?"
The man had been hidden from view by a large canvas that was settled upon a massive easel. His head was cocked at an odd angle, his eyes focused unmoving and he stroked at the center of his breast in a way that was nearly obsessive.
Finally, Sherlock had re-buttoned his wool coat around his ensemble and held out his arms indignantly. "Is this sufficient? Will you allow me outside now, /doctor/?"
John made a mental note to stop by the building supply store for the hydrochloric acid Sherlock had wanted after he got off work. Justifying it as a nice surprise.
Once inside, brother Michael began readying a fire for cooking and pulling down the Watsons' only cooking pot, spitting into it to clean away something with his sleeve.
"Well, it's certainly a relief to know it won't be having an effect on his manners; his being with someone." Lestrade muttered, unscathed, and held the door open for John.
For an instant, John paused.
John's wandering eyes fell upon the strange rock he'd been gifted yesterday and was reminded that he'd  totally forgotten about it. It seemed to have migrated onto the mantle piece sometime in their absence, taking residence near Billy the skull. It was no large task to imagine that Mrs. Hudson must have been unable to resist the urge to tidy while she had commandeered their laundry. "Well, anyway, on a completely different note; I never thanked you for the um...the rock. So thanks...for that." He turned back. "Why a rock?"
John chuckled at the comparison.
And John went along without protest, because it felt good to be necessary.
Sherlock stood tall and turned to them, drawing in a suggestive breath with his light eyes turning to saffron in the halogen. His hands coming up to steeple before the soft blade of his face, almost as if in offering. "Our murderer chose these two men because they possess nearly identical traits; same height, same physique, even the same hair color.
Sherlock nods, swallowing. And unclamps his right hand to bring it to John's cock.
By the time John caught up with him, Sherlock was out on the kerb sitting in a taxi with the door open, his nose buried in his Blackberry.
"Of course you'd forget." John, too proud to jump, had his arms folded across his sticky chest, looking angry. "She's /that/ girl. The one from the museum..." his voice became more heated at Sherlock's empty expression, his palm out expectantly. "The one who was killed by her brother from the Black Lotus Gang." Hge made a swipe at the book but missed and it only proved to anger him further. "Give it back."
It was on black paper, written in the same swirling penmanship, though in white.
The silence between them ensued for so long that John was able to dip deep into contemplative thought, nearly missing what Sherlock eventually mumbled his way. "Come again?"
John could not help himself but to stare as the key disappeared towards the vicinity of Sherlock's waist and felt a fresh bolt of anger at second helpless gasp that escaped Sherlock's lips. He tightened the fists at his sides, fighting everything inside him that demanded he overpower the High Steward and free his Prince from this nightmare.
"Oh, no no." John waggled his finger, one cheek full. "You don't leave things to chance; you're too bloody clever for that. How'd you even come to be there anyway? Lestrade said he'd only just got the call when you showed up."
Sherlock scrambled to fix it, "th-that is...I mean to say..." but then John's unoffended smile broke through and calmed his worry. "'Reasonably moderate' does make your intelligence level higher than most." Sherlock amended.
There was a bright sudden burst of indescribable pain and John's vision blew out into a high, white frequency, pulsating with opalescent, flashing stars. His surroundings dissolved into nothing but a claustrophobic swath of miles and miles and miles of agony. And he was the sudden center; the heart, the eye of a raucous and terrible storm.
"John please. There's something I should--"
With his consecrating nod, Sherlock took him back into his mouth like a key fitting into a lock and he lost most cognitive thought after that. His fingers stayed planted beneath Sherlock's face, feeling the inner workings of his throat and tongue as it laved and curled and fucked John's cock with deft precision. Bobbing in his hand.
"Certainly not. Be sensible John." Sherlock said, looking somewhat repulsed. "You're attempting to theorize based on insufficient data. Twisting facts to suit your theories, instead of using theories to suit your facts. I wouldn't have expected /you/ to make such a capital mistake." He worried his lip with his thumb.
"John?" He says quietly. "Is it like that every time...for you?"
So when he entered the High Steward's private chamber, he was completely unprepared for the sheer size and opulance of the place.
John had to think about it. "Getting a window crew to work at two in the morning in freezing cold is more than a favor, Sherlock. What'd you do, exonerate someone else from a triple murder?" Then it struck him. "You called your brother, didn't you?"
This command was given to William, for John saw from the corner of his eye the way William rose quickly and stepped outside the door.
Walking back through Umberland Village, John had felt a sense of subdued pride buoy up through his sadness. A feeling too long unfelt at being able to bury make peace with the past and be able to help those who had helped him so much.
'Don't move.' John texts before disappearing below ground. 'I'm coming to you.'
"It certainly could be a possibility," Sherlock said brightly, as if John had suddenly caught on, "only the night shall tell."
"Just touch me first, yeah? Get me off. Please?" John begs. Needing something to help spread out the tight focus of his hole being stretched wider than it ever has been. "I'll be quick. I'm close too."
"I am not like that now. You will have to bear witness to all of me."
"And you will still have me?"
"I can't use those. The handles aren't long enough." He replied. Pushing the pin into the foam board. He held up his eventual masterpiece at arm's length, inspecting the spacing.
And there it was again, another tiny yet monumental shift in their relationship that sent another warm frisson of sentiment licking through John's chest. Sherlock was ceding the floor to him IN FRONT of the Yarders. He was allowing him first crack at the spotlight and treating this partnership as an /actual/ partnership between them. Working as a team.
"But Charles Magnussen--"
The orbs of Charles' flat eyes glowed in the rising sun that had begun to spray its light more ardently through the solar's window. Painting the room with a massacre of dancing orange diamonds.
He addressed John like their previous row had never even taken place. That he hadn't hung from the hole in the wall in his house coat, yelling like a lunatic. And John went along with it, because now was not the time to air their dirty laundry, especially not in front of the canted eyes of New Scotland Yard. As they already suspected there was already enough gossip going on as it was.
John shifted lower in his seat, wiping back the comforter to let his own erection bob free in the tent of his boxers. Wanton. Allowing Sherlock to see what he was doing to him. He found himself panting, part from increased blood flow and part asphyxiating congestion. Witnessing the moment Sherlock's eyes caught fire, his mouth falling open to mirror him, but it was the Stradivarius that moaned.
"Yes!" John pants, watching as nimble hands work his underwear down over his thighs. Cool air sweeps across his groin and he gasps at the difference in temperature on his blood-hot prick. Then Sherlock is working his way down on his elbows, lips smearing down John's belly until his shins are hanging off the end of the bed and in one move he's swallowing John down to the absolute root.
"Good. Because I had no intention of doing so." Sherlock's eyes seemed to glow more brightly as his gaze intensified. Watching John as he toed off his shoes and stood before stopping with his hands on his belt buckle. A subtle shift in posture towards resolve and John loosened his pants and slid them down his legs.
Sherlock stubbed out his half finished cigarette, preoccupied. Barely hearing him. "No. I like the view."
"Thirty seconds more. Open." John turned back around from where he'd been fishing through the ambulance's equipment.
"No. No, but thank you. I--" John looked back to where Clara was watching him like a hawk, "best be getting back home. My endurance is not what it once was. I just came to give you this." He had then untied a small purse from his belt, hesitating only once before handing it over.
Two fingers at the body's neck revealed no pulse whatsoever and John was half tempted to let the ocean take the body back away from here.
The pliers find purchase around his second molar and John's tongue blunders against it, the metal cutting into his gums, and just as a heavy pain begins swelling in his jaw, everything is brought to a standstill.
"Two birds. One stone. I get it...well," John says. "I understand why you did it, at least. Can't say I enjoyed being the test subject. But I have to say, it was rather clever."
He growled at the injustice of it all, angry at his floundering. Then subsided into sad complacency. "I suppose I should feel lucky. We...I got to hear what I imagine everyone wants to hear before they die. But /I/ didn't get to say it back, Sherlock. I couldn't. I just was trying not to die. Pleading to stay alive so I could see him again. I didn--" John was curling in on himself, as if the expenditure of words were literally dessicating him of his very life.
"The after drop." And as if on cue, Sherlock began to shiver violently. "The h-h-half d-degree temp-p-perature drop com-m-mon in ind-d-dividuals exp-p-p-periencing expos-s-s-sure to c-c-c-cold." His teeth chattered uncontrollably as he spoke. John rubbed his palms all the more vigorously up and down Sherlock's arms. Leave it to Sherlock bloody Holmes to be monitoring his own internal temperature. "We n-n-need to r-r-raise m-my c-c-c-core temperat-t-ture."
"Yes." A perfectly tweezed eyebrow raised minutely. "I did hear about you three making your acquaintances at the pool some nights ago. Terrible business that. I don't know what fantasies my brother has been inclined to regale you with, but, as I've said before, I only occupy a minor position in the British government. Surely you can't expect /me/ to keep tabs on every criminal in London at all times, can you? "
"Which is...what exactly?"
"In a way." John slid his half-full glass onto the counter, letting the full understanding settle into his dignity. "Makes me sound like a bit of a coward doesn't it?"
"Sherlock." John warned. "Remember how we talked about inappro-" But his rebuke died in his throat as he saw around the man who had been acting as a second screen.
As an answer, John's mobile trilled from the kitchen. Though neither man moved.
"Oh? Cheers." John drank to that.
John blinked, catching up to his ears. "That's very ...clinical of you, Sherlock." And almost laughed. "And kind. But no."
In the indeterminable amount of time it took for Sherlock's hands to end up tickling against the soft invisible hair peachfuzzing John's arse, John had begun to tremble with anticipation. His fingers were slipping on the ceramic. His breath coming out in heavy pants. His cock throbbing like a monster and dribbling merrily.
All over satisfied that he'd done a thorough perusal of the strange new live-in garden of 221B however, John readied the shower (taking care to spray any stray soil down the drain) and stepped into the water that was just the right temperature of hot to beat his sore muscles into submission and turn his skin pink.
He tried harder, to end it faster, but the pressure was mounting and his focus was flagging and that water had dropped another two nefarious degrees and that deus ex machina button inside him just WOULDN'T reveal itself to his short, fine fingers and get this all over with and oh! for fuck's sake! Come on!
"Hmmnn...Sh'lck...please." John whined.
The Queen Mother is caught on the back foot for a moment. Her face a rictus of abject horror. Clearly reeling. "Wha--what do you mean? What DISEASE?"
It was a miracle this little cow had survived this long at all. Having been calved this past winter by these same oxen pulling his plough. Very literally almost having been born right on his pillow given that the cow had gone into labor at dusk and since all the animals they owned were brought inside the house with them during the night to dissuade theft and predation, she'd birthed the little calf right there beside the bedstead.
But not long after that, John Watson from Umberland of the North had come into his life and made things right.
John washed up at a slow pace as well, towel drying and putting the dishes away, and then finally, finally, /finally/ shrugged into his coat and muffler, hissing with a grimace at his shoulder. It was bloody awful today. "Come on then." He muttered halfway down the first turn of steps and Sherlock sprang from the chair like a frog in a dynamite pond to follow.
"It is not your fault John Watson." He whispered, with a voice pitched as deep as bubbling oil. He led John's hands together and transferred them both to one of his, wrapping five long fingers around John's small fists as he brought his freed hand up to his mouth and sucked liberally on his first two fingers. Shoving them nearly to the back of his throat.
"Right. I'll just, uh *ahem* ask the others." John told himself aloud, trying to reassert his intentions.
Would a man so beautiful truly treat John with the brutality that Charles suggested? John would have to wait to see the truth of it, but he took the description of himself with all alacrity. It would be far better for Prince Sherlock to know precisely what sort of man was being presented to him. A skin of truth laid over the body of lies.
And it felt so utterly wrong to see him depicted in this way that it twisted something deep inside John's stomach.
Knowing that he would keep at it if allowed, John rewound their talk. "So, going back to what I said. I think /I've/ figured out why you were acting like such an arse."
"Yes. It was." Sherlock felt the same, though for entirely different reasons. "I need you to send an e-mail to Mr. Asano."
Sherlock did not answer.
John couldn't stop his lip from curling at the thought and then really /considered/ just what had been going on for the past two days if one factored out the silence.
His arse hit the leather just as Sherlock finished his fulmination. John sat nailed in place like a crucifixion with Sherlock's eyes and totally unable to completely comprehend the breadth of what he'd just heard.
The detective would crouch down, stand back up, walk some paces, walk back, then crouch down again before contorting his head nearly sideways in an effort to get a look at whatever it was he had found so interesting. From afar, it looked as though Sherlock was examining a rather large pale rock covered in brown moss, but beyond that, John could see no body.
The words stung as he said them, but apparently hurt Sherlock more, because he hardened himself in the doorway, nearly growing to fill it.
"No, I--" John found himself saying, though he had not thought to do so. To have those eyes turn away now felt like this moment would disappear. "No," and then his hands were moving. He slid the wide belt from his waist and loosed the strings from the top of his boots. But here he paused, for he knew that the gauntlet he had run his body through for the past three days, his back would not be kind enough to let him bend.
On the contrary, John thought, he had been bestowed the greatest of all gifts.
A great stillness settled over John as his imagination assisted the silence. Sucking a breath in through his teeth in an effort to reply, only to have it dissolve into a gasp as Sherlock leant back down to resume his hedonistic debauchery.
"You live here with your sister, yes?" Brother Michael asked, taking a sip from the ladel and selecting another vial from his impressive collection, adding the entire contents of it to the grumbling pot, before slipping the empty vial back in. John eyed the impressive collection from where it sat next to him upon the bedstead and kept his hands graciously in his lap.
He kissed into him harder as John stroked him more fervently. Neither of them making any noise except for the overlapped staccato hisses of their breathing and the soft saliva pop of sticky lips.
Sherlock sidled up beside John. "It appears that not only did he help himself to this man's kidney; he also pilfered a rather large section of liver from here."
"Shitfuckgoddamnedbloodybastard." He snarled as his hand scrabbled on a piece of loose weed and nearly tipped him off. He wasn't nearly as keen on descending the cliff side as he'd been when he'd first laid eyes on it. Somehow, the idea of dying versus the impending threat of it were two wholly different ideals.
oo2. the "oh my god" song that earns John a groin squeeze is a hat tip to 'In the Flesh' in reference to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites by Skrillex that they use in one of their episodes. cause that show is wonderful.
"Yes yes. A moment." He rose from his chair, his long joints stiff from extended stillness and made his way across the honeycomb flooring on bare feet to the far wall. He had yet to gain the weight back that he has lost. His long linen shirt billowing around his thin chest, letting only the barest edge of his detailed purple braies peek out at the top of his knees where they were tied. They were longer than the usual small clothes favored by the townsfolk below; but being self-designed, they gave him the modicum of decency he sought to counteract to the shame between his legs.
John gasped despite already knowing truth of it and was not aware which one of them it was who leaned in first.
"Oh?" A gathered rivulet of sweat took that moment to escape the sheen from across John's brow to track down his temple. "Not good?"
Sherlock threw out the name above that. "Jefferson Hope?"
"What was that symbiosis thingy you said we had? Back before all this?"
For the last four years of his incarceration to this tower, this thrush had seen fit to come to him, seeking food. Its visits were never long. Only seeming to come to herald the morning, make an attempt at progress, earn its meal for the trouble, then slip away to leave him alone in his misery. But still it was  welcome all the same.
'you're cordially invited to join us John Watson...'
Shortly after the fourth and final reading of the scroll, Harriet and Clara had returned home with (not only with a bushel of baked bread) but also with their unbridled elation at the news of John's mission. Absolutely convinced that this could be the best thing that could ever happen to him.
John nodded sadly. "I wish I could take you away from here. Smuggle you out somehow..."
"Right." John sighed again, preparing himself for what was about to consume his life for the foreseeable future and gathered them up to hang. His first impulse was to go put the kettle on, but the urge to let himself settle took priority. So he stood and let the ambiance of 221B do its magic.
"After all, it was my first encounter with a dead human body in person and it felt like a natural reaction. Eric, however, did not understand my preoccupation with investigating the facts. He refused to think properly on the matter. It was then that he shut down and turned me away. Preferring to drink. The irony is not lost on me, of course.
"Hm?" Sherlock touched his nose to John's atlas. Pressing his frontal plate against John's occipital bone, which in turn pushed John's head down to examine their entwined fingers.
Its sharp talons took no pause in spearing the tiny thrush in place like an iron maiden. Gathering up its wild feet so that they would not wound, before using its hooked beak to tear the speckled feathers from the creature's small breast. Clearing a spot to feed.
His heels dug into the mattress as Sherlock lapped at his dark flesh, so close to his hole that John was beginning worry that he might not make it to the intended terminus. He had to tell him. "I've never...we need...oh-ah...a condom. I'm not *ah!* going to..." The words were difficult to find with his mind splintering in four different directions. The most base was in an effort to avoid injury and keep his arse from bucking.
"Come in Captain." The High Steward suddenly bade, and without looking away from the Prince's glass-colored eyes, he heard the knight enter the solar behind them and watched Sherlock's face intently for any hint of emotion.
"Sherlock." John found himself panting as his thrice-warmed arousal was exposed, almost wanting to make up an excuse for it. He felt slightly dizzy from the rush of zig-zagging blood through his body and wished for something to hold onto. But the only thing he had to ground him was Sherlock's palms laid flat across his belly, mere centimeters from his stiffening cock and the calm breath pulsing against his neck and the toothpaste in his hand.
/Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard earned pay
He had risen before daybreak and dressed by candlelight. Anticipation and doubt still gnawing at his guts that perhaps yesterday had been a figment of his imagination. But William's stroke upon the door to wake him a short while later had done much to calm his nerves.
He guided Sherlock back onto the gurney as there was a knock on the ambulance door.
"I don't believe it should be a problem, sir." The woman said brightly, wiping some of the blood from her hands on a linen rag that sat next to the suckling piglet she had just hacked into pieces. "But I'll not be feeding the pigs again until the morning..."
John had prepared himself so completely for this moment that when it came, so many scenarios spinning through his mind that ranged from icy stoicness to absolute outrage, that when faced with the actual reality of standing in front of the man who was married to the man he had loved most ardently for almost all his life, he didn't act at all.
Henry Knight, William's husband, was the one who had greeted him at the door, after having watched John's limping struggle up the path through the window. John had left Clara hovering from afar at the front of the path, watching for any sign of trouble and ready to come running if he had needed her.
"Johnny." Harry had exasperated when they'd explored the property for the first time. Waving a hand at his moron proclamation the moment he'd found that strange whipstitch stairway. "You barely just got back to walking! You'll break your goddamn neck trying to get down that." Her tow hair had been tugged awry by the breeze.
John felt loose and warm and wholly grateful that this little keyhole peek had even been allowed to take place. It became obvious then, that Sherlock failed to begin relationships simply because they ended up as disappointments, choosing an easier road to avoid them altogether. He made a little motion for Sherlock to stand.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He's still dead by my hand."
Sherlock's hands are quick to roll him onto his back, while John tries to gather his broken arms to himself so that he can curl up like a wounded thing, but with a desperate moan he realizes that his left arm will not come to him. It stays strung out against the red red carpet and it will not move. It cannot move. It may has well have come clean off.
John could make out the pale trunks of the trees and the dark undergrowth quite well. Every fifty feet was a small campfire that looked no bigger than the flame of a candle. Strategically placed, so even at night the Royal guards stationed there could keep an eye out for trespassers.
"I was able to sell the coke on to third party, double the price. It was either that or I was going to secret it home and experiment on it after you went to bed. But I assumed that had I chosen the latter you would have been fairly upset with me."
The sound of John's metal gauntlet against the soft wood of the door seemed like a thunder stroke in the silence. The pins in the hinges groaning terribly as the heavy door swung back and John took the last breath he would ever take of his old life as he stepped inside the room.
He is far too fast for Sherlock to anticipate him.
"You're going out?" John asked in surprise and got a small hum in response.
There was no man ordered to take the man from the stocks.
John laid Sherlock's Belstaff and scarf on an empty counter and snapped on some gloves, slightly bemused at Lestrade and Molly as they leaned in to examine along with him. Apparently feeling allowed to partake in the investigation vicariously.
With his victory, Charles' dark figure would block out the sky entirely to trap him in this grave. Until all Sherlock could see were the flat floating eyes that sought to swallow him whole and the feeling as though he was being torn apart from the bottom up.
"Why?" John asked suddenly, not slowing his horse, but keeping his voice low, only loud enough for William to hear. "Why have you agreed to do this with me?"
It felt like a benediction.
"He is, your Highness."
The radio was turned down low. Advertisements burbling nonsensically as John finished up his patients' notes in the quiet sanctuary of his office. Nothing but the calm scribble of indelible words and the intermittent hum of the heater coming on.
Smirking, Charles fingered beneath his own ruff of feathers and brought up a long ribbon like the line on a bucket that dipped into a deep and terrible well. A small key surfacing from the depths of his doublet. Warmed next to his skin.
"Of course I was!" Sherlock stated incredulously. "How else was I to make inquiries? Dealers can be plied with money, David. Information bought and sold just as easily as their wares. You KNOW this. The ecstasy he was pedalling was cut with ketamine anyway, which makes it cheap and useless. His coke, however, was a high grade uncut product, if his lingering cardiomyopathy is anything to go by, which it /is/. There are clear signs--"
John came awake with a sharp inhale. His neck protesting as he went to right it. He had fallen asleep in his chair with his medical journal spread open against his chest, his head cradled on his shoulder.
There had been times, he remembered during those darkest nights, when in his suffering he had willingly welcomed death. Opened his arms for mercy to take him, only to find Harriet or Clara and their ferocious desire for him to  live  bringing him back from the threshold. Stealing him back, as it sometimes happened.
He felt safe, for the first time in a long time. With large tight arms and long, wrapping legs and soft pliant lips that lay kisses upon kisses upon kisses on his cheek. He felt love again for new man. A great man. The best.
"Hm." Was the only sound Sherlock made as he contemplated it. From the sound of it, he was chopping the brain into smaller chunks now, though John knew that he was tucking the identification away into his mind palace somewhere for safe keeping.
The length of Sherlock's pacing wicked down to a small trail right behind John's chair, the breadth of the front of the kitchen. He kept snatching glances over at the picture of the specimen, willing it to knock an idea loose. "Irrelevant. This fish was completely alone. It was being held in what they term a 'hospital" tank. A completely barren holding aquarium in which they monitor stress levels and the relative health of the fish until it's deemed fit to move into its intended display."
"The thrill of the game is unlike anything else, I'll concede." Sherlock says, a cold wind blowing through his eyes now. Now that the stakes have been raised. "But your pursuit of Dr. Watson is a step too far."
He watched John take a tentative drag and dissolve quickly into a bout of bronchial coughing. John handed it back to the grinning man, thumping his fist against his chest to get his lungs cleared and make the burning sensation stop.
The first and second molars were missing. There was residue under the tongue.
Three more pulls sent him tumbling, careening, falling and flying over the edge into orgasm. He let himself go down Sherlock's mouth in three heavy, almost painfully full spurts. Claiming the mouth that took everything and gave nothing back. Claiming it for his own.
John huffed. "You do realize Lestrade's going to have a coronary once he finds out you absconded with evidence."
John watched her go, her little feather flapping on her hat. Their trolley was sufficiently full now, with enough food to last between the two of them - and occasionally the third - for a good two and a half weeks. He was thoroughly puzzled at her departure, until his eyes caught what they'd stopped in front of.
John's breath caught on a small pant. The soft, dry touch of lips all that Sherlock gave him. But it meant so much, like a seal.
"And you still didn't eat it?" An alarming thought was circling John's head.
"I believe he's allowing you to do so, yes." Mycroft said and that stopped John's thoughts in their tracks momentarily. Mycroft continued. "When you first met him, my brother had been engaging in, shall we say, suicidal proclivities. He did not sleep and rarely ate, conscientiously choosing to put himself in harm's way whenever possible. You are aware now that his pension for this behavior has only subsided since your moving in together, but it has not stopped entirely."
And as simply as that, the party of the three were headed North to Castle Appledore.
"This is the item that I would like for you to fetch for me John. Three to five of them of good size. There's an ... it's an ingredient that until now I've been unable to get ahold of and I need it."
They passed two men snogging ardently against a sign as large as John's torso reading: 'WARNING, EXCESSIVE SOUND LEVELS', which, in all honesty, didn't even come /close/ to describing the bone-shaking immensity of the noise that enveloped the dance hall.
"I really don't." He had repeated, his voice as wrecked as a river bed.
The entire drape of black and purple and gold and ivory was so extravagant that it almost seemed unnecessary for him to be wearing a glittering amethyst set into the center of a  thin, golden crown. But for him not to wear this extraordinary piece of refinery, letting it float in the cloudburst of his black curls as it did, it seemed more a shame for him to do without.
Miles seemed to relax noticebly after that. "Cheers. I promise I'll leave you alone as soon as they're back."
