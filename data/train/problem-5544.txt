“Your opinion is irrelevant.” He replied, “To an old man like you, who grew up during the Great Depression, that slob will look like the Thanksgiving.”
Tony gave him an incredulous look: “Well, that’s a new! He used to went on with bigoted speeches about the fate marked by one’s sub-genre and other bullshit like that.”
“I quote what I want.” Tony replied with petulance, “But you’re lucky I’m still in anxiety mode, so for now I will respect your requests, Captain.”
He was about to leave the room when he heard him speak. Nothing more than a whisper, as if he were afraid of being heard.
Tony shutted is mouth abruptly. Steve sighed deeply and his shoulders relaxed, the red of his eyes gave way to the usual baby blue. Leather, resin and
He sat on the bed, perfectly alert, and let himself be guided by his primarily senses. He found himself crouched at the foot of Tony's bed, his throat dry and his eyes burning with tears. It had been a long time since he last felt all this desperation, and now he had the feeling of drowning in it.
"No." he blurts out both annoyed and horny, "I know you think I'm a hedonist, but  when I’m having sex my first thought is not looking in the mirror like a narcissistic psychopath."
It's known that Alpha's eyes change color according to their mood. Tony had had the misfortune to often see red eyes: first in his father, then in several feral Alpha who had clashed with him. Finally in Steve, every time he went down on the battlefield – and sometimes even during the quarrels between them.
At the age of forty-three Tony no longer had to settle for a closet, but we know that a part of him still felt the need to hide. And since he was an engineer and a billionaire and ‘go big or go home his my motto’, in the Tower he had a nest-room all to himself, just like the one he had had in his Malibu house. It was his clandestine refuge, designed by himself to meet all his needs. Whether he was in heat or just needed a place to feel safe, it was perfect and equipped with every comfort. But above all it was
Steve raised his eyebrows and stared at him, because he wasn't good at that kind of talks and wasn't sure Stark was really alluding to
Steve knew about war’s traumas, but he was a trained soldier and had chosen that life. It could be objected that even Tony, despite being lacking in training, had chosen that same life, but in fact it was that life that had chosen Tony, whether he liked it or not.
What was he supposed to do? What did an Alpha expect from an Omega in a similar situation? Tony looked at Steve, but he couldn't see just
The questions hurt him more than the exercises he's forced into, but Steve was never the kind of guy to back down. He’s the one who asked for this, after all, so he grits his teeth and goes on, answering back every question.
“J.A.R.V.I.S. you heard Mr. Rogers.” He cleared his throat and casually stretched his legs up to touch Steve's feet, “Orange and cinnamon.”
As with everything related to Tony's private life, Steve found out how things had gone between him and Pepper practically by chance, during a completely unexpected situation.
Steve realized that he had held his breath only when he released it, moments later, in the air that smelled of blood and debris. He looked up to the sky, narrowing his eyes against the glare of the sun: a flash of red and gold darted through the blue, proud and blazing as always. Relief warmed his chest, but the cold of fear was always anchored deep in his soul.
He’s quiet at the Tower. And that's also why he likes to be late. The hallways are empty and silent, barely lit. There’s no danger of running into anyone.
When Tony turned five, Howard judged him old enough to say goodbye to the nanny he grew up with, and replaced her with a governess chosen specifically by him. Obviously she was an Alpha.
“Jesus Christ!” He clung to the work table and looked at him in alarm, “Did you make the return trip in
be enough, from now on. Leaving him meant doing a real violence to himself for Steve, but Tony was right: they couldn't share their first heat together like this. To make such a step, an Omega must feel safe not only with the Alpha but also with himself. And Tony wasn't feel like safe, Tony didn't want that heat, as he had never wanted the previous ones, even more if they were triggered by stress. Steve could understand it: he too had been an Omega, he knew what it meant to be submitted to a tyrannical biology.
, for a moment they can't help but stand there, with his hands clawed into Steve arms and their lips pressed together, stuttering breaths mingling over their skins.
It wasn't a noise that woke up Steve. Although thanks to the serum his hearing was very fine and because of his war experience he always kept a light sleep, what woke him up was the

in order to stick among the narrow expectations of others. Tony would have pulled down every standard – Tony would have knocked down even his own standards.
– even something more. For the first time in his life Tony was starting to feel okay in his sub-genre.
They limped in the heavy air filled of debris and gunpowder. The Quinjet was not far away, the others were waiting for them.
, so sweet and intoxicating that Steve had to break the kiss and shove his face under his jaw, breathing hard in his neck.
“I don't know what you all think, but this jewel is not indestructible.” He said as the plates closed around his legs, “I mean, I’d like to think it too, but hey, let’s be real, this is nothing more than titanium. You survived an airplane crash and woke up like you just took a nap, so…”
Tony had been doing this on his own since he was five – a lifetime – and had never felt the need to do it with anyone. He knew that many Omegas were happy to nest with other Omegas, or their Alpha – or anyone who lends themselves for the occasion. Omegas were basically the gregarious part of the dynamics, the glue between the sub-genres. But Tony had never had the privilege of being able to express this side of his sub-genre.
“So.” Stark got up and started walking, apparently concentrated on his ice cream, “How long have you known?”
“No!” He blurted with a shiver down his back, “Jesus, no. We grew up together, we… I could never have–”
“No no no no… Alpha, I'll be good, I promise, I'll be good... don't hold me down, I'll be good... see? I'm good, aren’t I? Don't hold me down, don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down…”
His mating gland had started throbbing hours ago. It was a miracle that the whole team hadn't noticed it as soon as he set foot outside the armor.
“Variation” could have been that they didn't train at all, because Tony was busy with some project, but Steve – God bless that ninety years old grandpa trapped in the body of a God – found nothing better to do than to wander around the lab, asking Tony questions whose answers would have required an engineering degree to be understood, taking away his favorite snacks to replace them with more healthy stuff because “good heavens do you ever eat a decent meal?”, and finally resolving to stay in a corner with his drawing materials. And Tony, well, he did not know how to feel knowing that Steve was portraying him: after all he was used to being under the media’s merciless gaze, but Steve's gaze was different. In what way it was difficult to say – and above all to accept – but it was
Dozens of portraits, all of Tony with his hair in bloom, alongside some notes, question marks that don’t need to be answered anymore. Steve's fingerprints where he blended the characoal, stroking the paper wishing it was Tony's skin.
Steve looked lost as he nodded silently and followed him. Tony shook his head in disbelief: they had a marathon of all
Steve goes to Helen’s office a few days later. When all the reports have been filled in, and all the meetings attended, and all the press conferences addressed. When all of Captain America's duties are resolved, Steve goes to her and asks to get checked out.
“Well, you guess good.” Tony smirked, than read from another note, “‘Sorry.’ I must say, the breakfast with which you accompanied the shortest of your messages was the most glorious that has ever ended up in my tummy. And you must be flattered ‘cause you are not the first who has tried to impress me with a good breakfast.”
"Steve." Helen sighs and stares at him frankly, "If you'd told me what you think the problem could be‒"
wasn’t like this, not in the way people thought. But clearly it wasn’t so obvious. And Steve didn't know if Tony understood it, or if he was acting like that because his inner Omega needed to take care of Steve to feel okay. But frankly Steve didn’t give a damn about the reasons: he just felt so good and for once he only wanted to enjoy the feeling.
“I think my father was a genius and a visionary and also a little insane.” He summed up, “We will never know what he had in mind, but yes, it could be that.”
. Steve let himself be lulled by the feeling of perfection that that moment radiated, with Tony sleeping confidently in his arms. And for a moment, while falling asleep in turn, he didn’t think about the past or the future, only about that moment and how much he wished it would last forever.
Steve asked him to pass him a blanket, the big blue one, and Tony helped him to drape it over the wall of pillows that he had skilfully built. He seemed completely absorbed in the task.
They are arguing in the Bartons' courtyard, and in the most heated moment of the discussion, when Steve smashes a log of wood with his bare hands, a white and pink flash blows in Tony's hair, the air between them suddenly smelling of asphodel.
When any threat had been obliterated and the victorious heroes could allow themselves to rest and return to their – more or less – normal life, Rogers' attitude changed imperceptibly. Slowly, as the adrenaline dropped down leaving room for the tiredness and shortage of post-war emotions that they all knew too well, Rogers began to gravitate around him.
Tony's acceptance of his behavior was something that exceeded the expectations of both of them. It would not have been easy to come to terms with it. It would not have been easy to understand all the possible implications.
that he wasn't used to doing so much anymore. Moreover, physical activities that, when performed with a super-soldier with super-stamina ‒ and super-
The air between them smells of wild flowers. Steve looks up to admire the buds and Tony closes his eyes as he brushes the petals with his fingers.
So, they had finally come to that part of the conversation. By now Steve was a little bit hurt by it: the lack of trust. After all, they had fought together, they won together, side by side.
ou cannot go to war without having full self-control. A feral Alpha is the last thing a platoon of soldiers needs.
He cautiously reached out and placed a hand over his shoulder. He did not know if it was a good thing to wake him up, but he couldn't stand to just look and do nothing.
Stark stuck his hands in his pockets and greeted him. Just like he showed there, he was about to leave with the same studied nonchalance. Steve watched him go. It was clear that all of this wasn’t easy for Stark as much it wasn’t for him.
In the semi darkness of the kitchen he opens the fridge, squinting his tired eyes against the light. He stares at the food as if it could give him an answer. He takes out the peanut butter and clears his throat to set the voice.
. Tony took advantage of his shock to duck and slip away from under Steve arm, giving him a playful spank before running away.
"He’s your best friend." Steve raises a hand to cup his face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone, "I don't want to be your best friend."
If two years earlier someone had told Tony that he would find himself nesting with an Alpha, he would have seriously doubted the person's sanity. But here he was, arranging pillows and blankets with an Alpha – and
From there to find himself in front of Tony's nest-room, the step had been surprisingly short. Tony had mumbled something about the need to nest for at least forty-eight hours to recover from the fright Steve gave him. And Steve's comment about he missed that part of being Omega, well, he said that light hearted, really. But as usual, Tony had caught it his way.
. It’s one among quite a few things about that man that confuses Steve when he meets him, and it certainly doesn’t help to get their relationship off to a good start.
When Steve disappeared into the kitchen with the leftovers, and returned with a brownie for him and and fond smile, Tony found himself plunging in that feeling as if he had been born inside it.
Tony leaves the lab heading to the kitchen, getting rid of the patch in the first bin he finds along the way. It's two in the morning, as they kindly informed him. Not that it makes any difference to him, but apparently to the rest of the world it does.
“Oh, he's nostalgic!” He had mocked him, “They found you on the bank of the Potomac. You were more drowned than alive,
“I've always been protective of my Marks.” He pointed out sharply, “Now that I have only one of them, I am overprotective and I pour my delusion of control on it.”
“‘Please, forgive me.’” Tony read from a note, “Concise. And I appreciate the gift. I don’t know why people think I'm not the flower type, but actually I have a soft spot for daffodils. How did you know?”
Over time, even this subtle interaction between them became part of the mission routine, leaving any discomfort or embarrassment behind. Just as, without even realizing it, somewhere between one mission and another they had left behind “Rogers” and “Stark” to make room for “Steve” and “Tony”. Until they found themselves relax at the point they could even joke about it.
So the next day Steve goes down to the lab with his sketchbook clutched in his hands. It takes him a while to make up his mind and cross the threshold. And he’s halfway amazed to see Tony in there, working like nothing has happened. As if something must have changed after what Steve casually heard him say the previous night.
It’s not uncommon to see them joking together, in those quiet moments between one mission and another. Which, considering Cap's depressing sense of humor, borders on a miracle. But hey, he’s trying his best, Tony recognizes it. And as much as he’s a champion of sarcasm, well, he finds more satisfying to humor Steve than to hit him.
Sure he's a fit guy: he can't be Iron Man without a strict daily fitness and yoga schedule. But being an Avenger doesn't include certain, uh,
“There, there.” He muttered uneasily, “Stop doing that, please? You're like… a forge of pheromones and I don't know what to do with all this tension, okay?"
That’s the super-soldier behind him. He's waking up and Tony would like to turn around to look at him, because he suspects that Steve Rogers with a morning beard and bed hair must be that kind of stuff that tempts a nun. But Tony is also very aware of the fact that this is the 'day after', and he has never been good at managing the 'day after'.
Tony held out a hand and Steve took it and they simply stayed like this for a long moment. Steve purring and stroking his palm with his thumb, Tony trying to regain a normal breath and relaxing his tensed muscles.

has been able to do. But he doesn't wake up. Then Hulk rips off the front plate and lets out a growl and‒
Now it was the Alpha who was asking for more. Yet Steve was still in control, his Alpha hidden just below the skin, contained, harnessed. They both knew that this wasn't the right place nor the right time. They couldn't burn the stages making love there, in the bedroom of Barton's children, during a parenthesis through a mission to save the world.
Now, what was weird about sharing a dinner with a friend and team-mate? Nothing, of course. Nothing at all.
Again, Steve swallowed back his Alpha's urges and fulfilled his request. Backpedaling one step at a time, without being able to stop looking at him, he moved away. Their arms stretched to the impossible in order to prolong that last contact. Finally he picked up the bag and left the room, leaving his Omega alone – for the last time, he swore to himself.
“Watch your head, big boy.” Warned him by moving his clothes and talking in a burst, “Yes, I know, it says a lot that I chose a
He was full-load with restrained anger on the return journey. The rest of the team stayed away and tried to interact with him the bare minimum. As soon as the Quinjet landed on the launch bay of the Avengers Tower, Steve rushed out and take the elevator.
“Okay, okay… wow! Um…” Tony raised his hands, “Let me put on the legs too, I don't think the arms’ propellers are enough.”
Tony eats another spoonful and then leaves the spoon in the sink, puts the jar back in the fridge. When he gets out of the kitchen, the room smells of heather. And he doesn't notice Steve.
“My comparison was between you and my pre-serum version of rachitic, asthmatic, hypertensive, anemic, and in general suffering from chronic diseases Omega. I was certainly not as desirable as Omega. While
Somehow Steve came back functional, even though he no longer had the gut to wrestle with food. Which, in Tony’s opinion, it was a shame. Anyway, after two hours, in a kitchen in which it seemed had exploded a bomb, they managed to pull out from the oven what were
It was no more than a few apprehensive glances or a cautious question. And the first few times, oh, Tony was simply

had no high hopes that things could be different now. He was a symbol, and symbols cannot have the luxury of carving out a life of their own. Not even after having thoughtfully made sure that the rest of the world is safe
When he enters her office, Helen is already there waiting for him, and she doesn't have a reassuring look. Steve braces for the worst.
But after all, when they were out of the team dynamics, it was entirely different. They could laugh and joke indulging in camaraderie, but then they were the only ones left to deal all with of this
“‘I'm desolated.’” Again another ticket, “Honestly, I didn’t imagine that there were so many variations for the same concept, but still… the drawing.” Tony put a hand over his heart, “Steve, you have an incredible talent. I mean, I'm good at numbers, I don't know a shit about art, but it's… I'm speechless. I'm sorry I can't accept it. Really.”
? Did he really think that the only reason someone would want a relationship with him was because of his financial empire?
“Just to know,” Steve took a sip of water while resting on the tatami, “Since when have you been so protective of your Marks?”
Steve hadn't had a chance to explore that side of himself yet. Back in the forties, suppressors and inhibitors were outlawed in the United States, no one could silence their sub-genre as was customary now. It was considered an abominable, unnatural act.
“The possibilities that opened such a thing…” Tony laughed bitterly, “And they threw it away like garbage.”

was used in that modern era, but when you are a super-soldier there is no way you won't be noticed. Fortunately Steve had enough experience
Tony's mouth gave way immediately and their tongues met, ravenous and possessive. Tony's arms wrapped around his neck, his hands sank into Steve's hair pulling him closely. Steve pushed him against the first available shelf, lifting him effortlessly and sitting him on it. Tony's smell reared up with
“That it would change your sub-genre.” Tony looked at him with undisguised curiosity, “Did they know that the serum would have this side effect?”
"Oh, that’s‒!" Tony's gaze snaps on him, his cheek burning red, "You're not the one who has his emotions in plain sight under the eyes of your crush!"
something else, dammit ‒ and Tony is almost always in armor. No smells, no flowers ‒ nothing that would make Steve question his own sanity.
, soft and enveloping like the blanket. Tony wondered if even his own smell gave off quiet, because honestly he didn't feel completely relaxed in that new and stunningly beautiful thing they were doing. Yet, as he rolled up in a blanket like a human burrito and let himself go on the pillows, he thought that never in his whole life he felt better than now, with an Alpha in his nest-room. For once his brain slowed down a bit – just a little bit, huh – but still enough to appreciate the moment he was living, here and now, and not need anything else.
“You are a super Alpha with a super sense of smell and you can't even count on suppressants.” Stark said dryly, “I think you can stop apologizing.”
“Believe me, I wish I didn't know. It does not concern me. It's like…” He clenched his jaw, fidgeting on his feet, “Like being forced to spy on other people's homes. But there is no way to…” He gestured vainly and finally shook his head, “To mute it. And I think it can happen again, because I just can't stop being like this. I'm sorry.”
“Good Lord, don't send me all those notes again!” Tony sighed out in frustration, "Flowers are okay. Breakfasts are
Long minutes passed like this. Between purr and sighs, languid caresses and cautious explorations, bumping noses and gingerly smell. The shadow of a kiss on lips as eager as shy. If they could have extended that moment for eternity, oh, they would have. They would have willingly imprisoned there forever.
The litany went on and on, and Steve's heart sank. Who had been doing this to him? The answer was obvious, but Steve couldn't focus on Howard Stark's faults. He was dead, while Tony was alive and still carrying the wounds of that unhealthy education.
He’s an old fashioned man, but he’s also the kind of person who doesn’t judge someone for those petty things. Still, he finds a bit disconcerting that Anthony Edward Stark smells of
His voice was cold, but a note of sadness was in his smell. It crept through the cracks in Tony's armor and came straight to his heart and it
"Get to the point." Tony chuckles, looking at him from under his lashes, and Steve, oh, he has already seen that look a few times but never enough.
The adrenaline is high, the relief at seeing Stark still alive makes him dizzy. It's the post-battle stress, he says to himself. It
And the following days Steve surely doesn't get bored. Helen makes him spend them in her laboratory, subjecting him to an impressive series of physical exercises, with a whole arsenal of electrodes stuck on him.
Steve untie a hand from their clutch and bring it to Tony’s forehead, kneading between his eyebrows. Tony closed his eyes and started to purr, and Steve smiled with relief and wonder. It had never happened before, even when they had nested together.
Steve looked himself into the mirros, all red eyes and fangs throbbing and broken breaths. Hell, he didn't recognize himself. He took a deep breath and shook his head, trying to calm the Alpha down. He couldn’t present himself to Tony like this – neither of them wanted this.

his life, Anthony Edward Stark – genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist – could have put aside the relationship problems with a now dead father who had made him suppress his real sub-genre, causing him a domino effect of large – disproportionately large – dimensions, and which he categorically refused to face. He could also have taken his life in hand, there was no longer anyone to account for.
Steve gives himself a time margin: six months. They fit inside a calendar, he can count them with just more than one hand, and he can carve out the necessary time.
“No.” He shrugged, and this time he sounded more confident, “It's not being Omega per se. It’s… all that revolves around us.” He gestured vaguely, “Come on, don't tell me you liked it. Back in your day it was even worse.”
How his mother was like him, and before her his grandmother, and even before her her great-grandmother, and so on, back for generations. How it's unknown which was the first one, but sure is something that has been passed on in his family since the dawn of time. How it’s present only in the female line, so no one expected Tony to inherit it.
“But he was also devoted to science, wasn't he?” Steve pointed out, “Maybe… I dunno, maybe he thought that the important thing was to act according to nature, but if science could
"I mean, there was that time a few days before, too, when we first met." Tony is deathly pale and Steve is seriously worried about him, “But I just smell it. Does it count? I don’t know."
reaction. Not even Steve. So, with a bit of astonishment, it turned out that even an Omega could be frightening when he wanted. Especially if it was covered with a lethal armor capable of making scorched earth around them within a radius of a few miles.
He had woken up in a bed in the Tower’s sickbay, never as grateful at that moment as he ended up there. He had breathed deeply the reassuring air, inhaling along with the smell of disinfectant also a familiar citrus and cinnamon smell, tinged with tiredness.
Eventually they decided to give up their hope upon the pizza and fell back on toast and beer – a classic. While in the movie one of the protagonists were swallowed by a flying shark, Tony felt suddenly tired. That full and satisfied tiredness that makes your limbs slack and your eyes heavy and then you feel sink among the sofa pillows. Tony felt it on himself and in Steve's smell – the smell of an Alpha – and found himself in the feeling with immense and unexpected ease.
All good, all perfectly understandable. The boy woke up after seventy years of freezing and no longer has anything in common with today's world, he no longer has anyone. It’s natural for him to emotionally lean on them. Tony knows what it means to be alone, he knows what it means to desperately seek affection outside of strict family ties, and in spite of a wary disposition. So, no, he certainly won't be judging him.
has seen them, Tony. You want to destroy them? Then do it, and we’ll never talk about it again." Steve wouldn't want it, but if that's what Tony wants he would never stop him, "It’s on you."
As if he had received a punch in the stomach, Steve backed away, head down, hunched his shoulders. When he looked up, his eyes were blue again.
Tony watched amused Steve, who was carefully observing the various robotic tools moving out from the walls.
. Because, come on, he doesn't believe it either. And why risk it, anyway? They managed to build a good friendship, after all. Things are going okay, aren't they? What more does he wants?
Fury was talking, but Steve could no longer follow him. Again, his gaze shifted to Stark. The Omega rose up simulating a phlegm that did not belong to him.
unbearable ‒ unlovable. Because, he thinks, it must be difficult to love someone like him. No? Only a select few could make it.
Helen buzzes around him, reading indecipherable data on the monitors and writing notes on her tablet. Her focused gaze doesn't reveal anything. She eventually sends him home, telling him to come back the following Monday. She has to process the results.
meandering in his smell. Fear of scare the Omega with his imposing size, Tony imagined. By now he knew him well enough. All those protective Alpha attitudes that made his eyes roll.
Content with his plan he unwrapped Tony from his blanket cocoon and carried him to their bedroom.  Once his omega had rested he planned to celebrate their good news by fucking his omega full  of cum and then stuffing him with his new food.  He could not wait to see Tony's body swollen with his pups and softened with a layer of fat.
Bruce adjusted himself, it was time to visit May Cow again so Hulk could let off a bit of steam, then he would implant the embryos. Thor had offered to take her to Asgard with him once Loki had given birth to quicken her pregnancy.
“Steve l can tell exactly what you are thinking, and yes it is not the same size, but believe me when l say that it will be plenty big enough to fill your virgin hole when you ask me to.”
Natasha continued to speak quietly in Russian, petting Tony’s cheek until he stirred, confused eyes taking in all the Avengers sitting round his bed.  His nose twitched at the sweet smell of freshly baked cake, his stomach chose that exact minute to let out a loud rumble, blushing furiously at the soft laughter he tried to hide his face under his covers.
Steve thought for one wonderful moment that rescue had arrived, he went to step forward only to be slapped on his cheek by Bucky.
“Shhhh Tony, it’s me Steve, you are safe and away from Him!  We are back home in our world he cannot hurt you anymore. You will never have to see or deal with that Bastard and his Pack ever again.
His makeup today was all earth tones and shimmering body dust.  He never thought that when Bucky first ordered him to start wearing makeup that he would enjoy finding new and dramatic ways of transforming his looks.  His hair was back to being cropped short at the sides and back, with soft, messy curls on top, he had been so happy when Steve had taken the clippers to his thick long curls, even Winter had admitted that he looked cuter and even younger with his hair short and anyway he had a selection of wigs for when his Alphas wanted him to dress more feminine.
“Right lets go and see the little shit and get this signed, I have a company to run.  It will be a relief to not have to split my time running the company and babysitting him, be warned Captain he is very high maintenance and needs a firm hand, give him and inch he will take a mile.”
Bruce’s tone of voice automatically made her lower her eyes, even though she wanted to argue she found herself biting her lip, Perhaps it would be better to do as asked, she didn’t want to risk a confrontation with Professor Hulk.
The second serum that I have developed along with having all the above has some additional adaptations that may be of interest.  Now if you turn your attention to the holo-screen I will go through in detail what you are viewing, and then you can make an informed decision.”
I will always care about you but you are not my omega and quite frankly I am tired of all your mental and emotional shit, you will thank Steve and me one day for doing this.”
Natasha ran her fingers over the smooth skin, pressing down on the small, raised bump, the room filled with the scent of omega slick.  She took a deep breath, her own scent of arousal mingling, as she pushed her fingers into his tight cunt. She smirked as the omega immediately started to respond.
You have until I have completed my paperwork to decide, then I will let Dr Banner and Professor Hulk know what procedures they need to prepare for.”
If you desire it, with many weeks of stretching and training I can get it to a size where you can plug her cunt with it.”
Pepper knew that tonight she was going to be punished by Alpha Steve, she had spoke out of turn at the board meeting, questioning his decision and to compound matters had balked at being offered to the remaining old board members as a thank you for their service, since they were retiring.  With the giveback of their share it meant that Stark Industries was now a Private Company again, owned completely by Captain Rogers and the Avengers.
Fury’s office door opened and in swept Ms Potts and a stern looking man in hospital scrubs, both took a seat at the conference table next to Fury and across from the team.  Steve watched as Ms Potts placed several files in front of her laying a pen on each before pushing them across the table to each Avenger.  The doctor himself had been carrying an extremely thick folder, which Steve assumed was Tony’s medical file.  Paying full attention to Ms Potts he waited to hear what decisions had been made with regards to Tony’s future, he could only hope that she would look with favour on Tony becoming part of their Pack.
It took a while to move the sack of oatmeal; in the end he sacrificed the rest of the rough blanket to drag it and the rest of his finds back to the cabin.  He would look in the barn’s loft tomorrow, for now he just wanted to light the stove and eat. It wasn’t until days later that he remembered the barn loft, he had been so tired, eating and sleeping was as much as he could manage. The oatmeal was surprisingly tasty, even if made with water instead of milk, each day he made three small portions, not wanting to run out before he could plan his next move.  He didn’t notice that he was increasing the size of his portion with every meal or that the sack never seemed to empty.  He just knew that he was gaining
Steve couldn’t bear to see Tony looking so upset, his punishment would need to wait, his omega needed to be reassured that no matter how much he misbehaved or pushed the boundaries of acceptable omega behaviour, Steve was not going to abandon him like so many others had.  Mindful of his still healing shoulder and casted leg, he settled Tony on his lap back leaning against his chest so he could wrap both arms round him, the smaller man’s legs straddling his thighs.  Hugging him tight he kissed the top of head through wild brown curls.
Steve tore through the crowd of reporters not caring who he hurt or what equipment he trashed, he needed to get inside and find Bruce, Bruce would know what to do, he would sort out this mess and make it all go away.  The other Alpha had been a good advisor to him over the past two years and had provided him with comfort and solace when he needed a break.
He approved of Captain Rogers and would defer to his greater knowledge of how to a bonded relationship worked but he had reservations about Sargent Barnes which has be exacerbated by the Hydra files he had been scanning over the last few days and heightened further by the notebooks and what amounted to an instruction manual on triggering the Winter Soldier to take control and perform missions. JARVIS had already decided on a plan of action, the timing was critical Sargent Barnes needed to be dealt with before the pups were born and before he inflicted permanent damage to Alpha Rogers or their omega.
Pepper could feel the tears pouring from her eyes as Happy and Steve abused her battered and bruised nipples, uncaring that in between sucking their cocks she was begging them to end her agony.
“Tony, give me your answer now, do you of your own free will consent to bond and accept my mark?  Do you consent to registering your contract in the traditional style, knowing that it is unbreakable and binding for the rest of your life?”
“Yep, as much as l want to fuck her mouth it’s not going to happen now because she is such a slut for punishment, see she is making no effort to keep still, her arms are shaking and  her thighs are twitching.
“Now look at the mess you have made, such a useless omega cannot even do the simplest thing without fucking it up.  Now we will have to start all over again.”
I would urge every Alpha to claim his omega and every omega to present yourself willingly to the Omega Council.
The pain was excruciating as Winter’s teeth bit down past skin and muscle to scrape against bone.  Tony howled until his voice broke, but Winter pinned him  down, teeth buried deep into his shoulder as his saliva started to heal the wound, kiting back the flesh and torn muscles until all remained were raw, red scars.
Peter hated going up to the Avengers Pack floor of the tower, but Ms Pepper his Alpha insisted that he visit his aunt two times a week to have lunch with her, and to spend time with Omega Tony discussing the latest developments in R&D and if Tony had produced plans for new tech for SI to bring them down to her.  There was also the unspoken rule that he was to make himself available to any of the Alphas of the Avengers Pack, whilst he was present on the Pack floor, he could only be thankful for the chastity device Pepper insisted he wear at all times when not in her presence.
Steve nodded in agreement pleased that she was advocating the natural birth that he wanted and that she would not be pandering to Tony’s demands for drugs.  He should have guessed that any omega midwife that worked for their obstetrician would hold the same views.
“Bossy little omega, I will allow it this once, as you have been such a good boy today, but next time I expect you to be polite and respectful when asking me for anything.”
“Milk cows don’t have time for doing their hair May cow, you need a practical style, nice and short so it doesn’t get caught in any straps or hoods, hmmm…. yes, I am going to buzz cut the sides and back and leave little on the top, just enough to grab hold of when you are putting those lips to good use, servicing your Pack!   Still don’t worry your hair will not go to waste, I can always do with more wigs for my disguises.
The days passed and he grew more resentful, BB was a useless cow, he bought the crop down on her tits, the stupid things were too small to produce much milk.  There had to be a way of getting them bigger, she had put on a little bit of weight but was still thin.
“My apologies Alpha Rogers I was just taking a moment to compose myself, everything is fine, the anomaly with the heartbeats is due to the fact there are not just two separate heartbeats but three.  Congratulations your omega is expecting triplets!”
Steve walked Tony down to his lab, admiring his pert nipples sticking out through the thin material of his tight t-shirt, his eyes trailed to his plumb ass and the outline of the vibranium chastity belt through the equally tight material of his yoga leggings.  Tony’s stiff bow legged walk had everything to do with the two thick, long phalluses plugging his holes and the hard metal nubs rubbing against his clit as he walked. Once Tony was secured in his lab, he decided that it was time to hit the gym and then drop in on Pepper to ensure that she was keeping to running Stark Industries and not trying to interfere in matters that did not concern her.  He was hoping that Rhodey would be available for a talk as well, they needed a replacement for Iron Man, and he was the obvious choice.  He just hopped that Rhodey could separate his friendship with Tony and Tony’s new life as Steve’s omega and mother of their child.
Tony comes with a loud scream, his body shuddering with the force of his orgasm, his cunt walls tighten to the point of pain, before relaxing and ejecting his juices onto the thick parchment placed between his thighs that he had long forgotten about.
Thirty minutes later Steve led a docile Tony to the bathroom to complete his morning cleansing, enjoying the sight of swollen red lips and the raspy breaths coming from his omega.
“Tony, this is nothing compared to what plans I have for you.  Now you will not move until I finish breeding your tight cunt and ass.”
Rubbing the sensitive bud of nerves forming on Tony’s neck he waited until his omega calmed completely before buzzing for Stella.  As he waited, he coaxed Tony in to eating a bag of Avengers shaped jelly candies and sugar coated, Captain America foam shields, laughing at Tony’s offended face when he stole and Iron Man jelly and bit of his head.
“Tony have you made your choice, I need you to be clear about what reward you want, I will be happy either way with your choice but you need to realize that the procedure that you don’t chose will then become a punishment for any major transgression in the future.”
Steve looked at the small plate of food that he had prepared for his omega ready to hand feed him once he has finished his own breakfast and pushed it away.  Thor quickly swiped it onto his plate before Hawkeye could even launch himself of the refrigerator.
Pepper had called to inform him that Rhodes was shocked and furious that his friend had hidden his orientation, concerned that his duplicity would effect his career with the Air Force, there were bound to be rumours that Rhodey had known and had willingly help him cover it up.  She had said that the Colonel had wanted to come and confront Stark, but a well time called in regards, to his immediate deployment meant that he been forced to accept that he would have to wait until his return.
Bruce has genetically modified Tony's skin/muscles around his mouth and holes, Winter and Steve test out how far their petite omega's holes can stretch.
Where do you think that Captain Rogers has been disappearing to every afternoon for the past week, certainly not to the gym!
Once she had bottomed out Pepper started to gently thrust, ensuring that she nudged Peter’s prostrate with each thrust, building up the force and speed slowly until Peter was a sobbing and crying mess, begging for her knot, omegas were so easy to train if you were clever about it. Every Sark Industry omega that she picked was partially bonded to her before being fully integrated into the SI Pack, she knotted them all once to assert her dominance as head of the pack and then placed them in various departments, always in a low key role so that when an alpha wanted to make use of them they would not be missed, their silence meant they kept their well-paid job for an omega, and if they stupidly bonded outside of the SI Pack they knew they would immediately lose their job and all the extra benefits that went with it.  Tony had been stupidly blind to it all, to wrapped up in Iron Man and R&D, convinced that his instructions for Pepper to hire omegas and create an open friendly environment were being followed.
His cock exploded, spraying over Tony’s face and breasts, he could only watch and ride out his orgasm as Bruce pumped his cum into Tony’s mouth and then sprayed his omega’s stomach and cunt. He squeezed his cock hard to stop the flow and pushed in beside Bruce who had returned to his normal size, even so it was a tight fit and he could see that Tony’s lips were bruised and split by the time they both withdrew.
“Pepper you are such a disappointment you couldn’t resist upstaging your brother, trying to proof that you were better than him. Look at you now, neither male nor female, a parody of what my daughter should have been.  You were supposed to join the family business and be David PA when you graduated and as such you would have done everything he asked of you to secure a business deal and the future growth of our family business, just as your  mother did for me. After a few years we would have found you a strong husband who would have given us grand-babies and kept you in your place, but would have understood the need for you to still provide the entertainment on occasion when David had need of you.
“Tony, I do believe your clit it bigger that your pathetic little cock, that truly is a sign that you are now a complete breeding bitch.”
Pulling out his wet fingers, he raised his hand bringing it down repeatedly on each plump buttock, the wobbling flesh turning rosy and warm as the breathy moans turned to shrieks of pain then garbled words and sobs as his wayward omega begged for forgiveness and yet another chance to prove that he could be the perfect obedient submissive omega that his Alphas wanted.
“Hello Stark or are you Tony, it’s a bit difficult to tell as you can’t speak, and you do look decidedly different, more of a little bitch now.”
“Anthony Edward Stark-Rogers, that is quite enough! If you carry on with this tantrum you will find yourself over my knee, you already have one punishment spanking to be discharged, do you want another one as well?
“ Just a little taster Captain to wet your appetite, you want to tap my ass then you are going to have to work for it!”
“No baby boy you need to finish the whole of this bottle for daddy you are too thin, the dietician has given me a special diet that must be followed so that you can put on weight and become healthy.   This formula is packed full of all the nutrients you need, daddy even had them flavour it with vanilla which I know you love.”
He watched her face as she noticed the shift in her scent and her body’s reaction to his knot finally filling her pussy.  He could feel the moment her cunt tightened and shrunk, making it agony for his cock to be invading her dry beta hole.  Pain and anger filled her eyes as she beat against his shoulders, screaming out cursing her fate.
The President thrilled at the panic filled eyes staring beseechingly up at him, he may be the leader of the most powerful country in the world, but nothing beat the absolute power an Alpha had over their omega.
His back passage is looking healthy and still tight, good muscle control around his anus, keep him plugged full of cum as much as possible this will provide the necessary nutrients he and the babies need but will also keep his craving for your cum at an even level.
Steve pressed the head of the wand against the first layer of Tony’s hymen, knowing that the vibrations on the sensitive tissue would be the final straw.
Peter stumbled and tripped as he was dragged through the barn by his nose ring, a switch to his behind soon had him trotting a long behind the herder until they reached an empty stall.
I do not want him around Tony until you have thoroughly trained him, my only other stipulation is that you ensure that he does not go anywhere near the pups and he must spend at least one day a week being used by the hounds.
Not wanting to drink his omega dry this time he pulls off, teeth deliberately grazing the milk drenched nipple, Tony twitches and moans beneath him legs circling his waist heels to his back pressing him deeper into his pulsing cunt.
Tony started rattling off details of all the projects ongoing and completed over the last quarter, it wasn’t hard with his eidetic memory and the fact that most of the original ideas and designs were his own.  He had to bite his tongue a few times when the old goats on the board grumbled at the cost of some projects against the low return they would yield.
There was a minute shift in the air before the flogger landed on his raised ass, he had been so lost in his thoughts he had missed Alpha Steve moving into position.  The flogger continued to rein down on his back, ass and thighs until he was crying and begging for Steve to stop, he could do nothing but howl when the strands of the flogger hit his pussy or hole, eventually the flogging  stopped and he was hauled to his feet before being impaled on Steve’s cock, his legs dangling as Steve held him against his chest as he fucked up into him. He could see the list and avarice on the spectators faces as he was pounded by his Alpha, one of his large hands roaming down to his pussy, three fingers pushing deep into his wet cunt to send him screaming into his first climax.  He could hear cheering and clapping as his cunt pulsed, squirting his juices forcibly out on to the floor.
The thin leather straps framed the stubby remains of the bitch’s cock, the exposed head red and dribbling.  Squeezing the nub hard he could see no real need for it, the Wolf agreed, it needed to go, but would be fun to tease and torment Tony with the threat of it for awhile.
Bruce carried on with his examination, even though he could hear the omega’s quiet sobs and feel her body trembling as he inserted the ultrasound wand.  She would need to get used to these examinations as they would be happening every week throughout the fertility treatment and insemination and the following months of her surrogacy until the Pack’s pups were birthed.
Fury had met him in secret to discuss the mission, Intelligence suggested that The Elite Alpha Club and possibly some Hydra elements were funding certain members of Congress and the Senate whilst blackmailing others in to supporting the more extreme elements of the Omega Registration Bill.  The Elite Alphas wanted control of the Omega Registration and Breeding Clinics, there were whispers of experiments to create the perfect breeding omega already taking place.  With legal access to omegas and their babies there was no end to what they could accomplish. The need to rapidly increase the omega population would see all omegas of age having to produce two omega pups within the confines of the Clinic before they could be bonded.  There would be exceptions of course, beautiful fertile virgin omegas would be available for immediate bonding but at a high price.
You will need to eat and drink everything I feed you, no matter how many meals a day I decide to give you, there will be at least three main meals such as you have just eaten and many snacks and treats.  Your weight gain is not a matter for you to decide upon, you will adhere to all medical requirements and to what I as your Alpha decide is best for you.
I am not going g to make that mistake, I want you to fuck me on my birthday and if l present as an omega you can either mate me or give me to one of your wealthy friends, who would then owe you a big favour.  If l am going to be an omega, I want to be a rich, spoiled omega.
Settling back in her seat she motioned for Captain Rogers to come stand beside her to await their next appointment, this was the one that would need all her considerable negotiation skills and for Steve to play the part of the distraught loving partner who hated having to go to such lengths to ensure his husband’s personal health and safety.
Steve stopped, there was no way he was doing that, it was dirty and not what an alpha did, he was willing to play the game, but he would never demean himself and act like an omega whore.
Tony was not happy with the change, he wanted his bottle back and to be sitting on daddy’s lap. Slapping his hands on the tray he proceeded to make his feelings on the matter known.
Sex Doll counted out the final five, her breasts covered in red handprints, her nipples bruised, the swollen nubs of flesh standing out two inches from her breasts. Her cunt clenched as Clint tugged on them as he fucked her from behind, her cunt squeezing him tight, to milk his cum deep into her greedy hole.  She could hear her loud moans as Thor’s  giant cock replaces Clint’s, he easily pick her up and pushes her against the glass windows, she scrabbles to brace herself with her hands as he begins to pound into her, his booming laughter deafening her as he jokes with the others that she will lose her grip and end up hanging off his cock before he is finished with her.
, so he was too delighted to prank Thor by telling him the most colossal bullshit about their alleged bonded life or whatever, just to hear his quaint comments.
Steve waits for that Monday as back in the 40s, when he was waiting for some test that would have confirmed his health was doomed. Maybe the serum worked on his body, but was the mind lost as a counterweight? Or maybe those seventy years stuck in ice damaged his brain?
pheromones. Feeling like a deer caught in the middle of a road, he propped himself up to raise his torso and his pelvis slid back and,
Rule number one: while they spoke, there could be no more than a foot between them. Really, more than a foot and they felt there was something inherently
Steve lowered the barbell and raised his torso, sitting on the training bench. Obviously this moment had to come, but frankly he thought that Tony would choose a different situation.
They both knew what Tony would need, but with those premises neither of them would have dared to do anything. He put the device back in its drawer and leaned wearily against the wall, rubbing his eyes. He felt drained, he just wanted to curl up in a ball and sleep for days – possibly on Steve's lap.
Tony became fully aware of it in Johannesburg, when the little witch from Sokovia had started playing with their minds. The terror inflicted by those hallucinations peaked at the sight of the Captain America's broken shield, of Steve dying under his eyes, and Tony burdened by total impotence.
But somehow, despite the digressions and the distractions, Steve managed to untie the skein of that story and understand something about it. He understood that Tony had spontaneously sacrificed his Marks to make amends after the events of Extremis. That this act had cost him a great deal, but that for the sake of his relationship with Pepper he considered it necessary. That apparently that sacrifice hadn't been enough anyway.
. They wandered around each other, trying hard not to be too obvious, ignoring the urge to look, to nose, to touch. From the outside it had to be ridiculous, if not downright obvious. Suggestions had come to ‘find a room’ – Steve just blushed, while Tony's response was usually a middle finger, and he really didn't have the nerve to scold him.
“From a physical point of view, I would be able to explain the presence of sharks inside a tornado Yet I can’t understand how is possible that the base of this pizza has been completely burnt while inside it has remained raw.”
That confession comes unexpected. Steve sucks in the air in surprise and looks at him with wide eyes. Acacia blossoms mingle with peonies and Steve is out of breath.
It feels like he’s carefully choosing his words, like he’s carefully choosing what emotions bring out.
Steve had thought about it, he couldn't lie to himself. But it had been easier to repress that thought. It had been easier to label it under the ‘demanding sub-genre’ voice than to think they liked each other for who they were.
“Variation” was also the choice of what eat for dinner. Anything could fill Tony’s stomach was fine for him, but Steve opinion was different on course. After the first few dinner of take away, he had showed up to the Tower with grocery bags and a look that Tony had only seen while he was in ‘Cap Mood’.
So, every time Tony saw Steve show up with grocery bags and an improbable recipe – oh, what a mistake it had been to introduce him to cooking competitions! – and it was all so dangerously
and, well, act accordingly. And if Steve had any doubts that Tony felt different, he had the opportunity to change his mind during breakfast. The not-so-stealthy way in which he buzzed around him, how he managed to touch him constantly making it seem like
Unavoidably, something snapped between them and neither of them managed to stem the consequences. Or maybe neither of them wanted to. The fact is: they let everything flow by itself.
“A… whole other level.” He repeated slowly, “And what exactly do you mean by ‘a whole other level’, Mr. Rogers?”
Slowly, the soldiers took off their helmets to show their faces. Steve watched Iron Man's head move to probe the group: surely Tony was asking J.A.R.V.I.S. to scan them from hairs to toes.
Steve nodded, but the red on his eyes did not retreat and Tony clearly saw his tongue sliding over his fangs. Fuck. Tony felt his blood flowed away from his face, his chest intertwined in an icy jelly and he was
And Tony is also smart enough to guess what it is that makes him do so. With the father he had it’d be difficult to come out mentally stable. Unfortunately, to admit it would mean that he needs to go to therapy and, no, thank you, one thing is to understand the problem and quite another to face it. There are things that he’s not ready to discuss for now. He can build an arc reactor out of junk while he’s held hostage to terrorists, but baring his soul is something outside his comfort zone, even if it involves paying an unknown professional.
"I can’t." Tony takes advantage of his position to hide his face tucking it under Steve’s chin, "Anyway you wouldn’t‒"
Still but alert, Steve watched attentive as Tony moved forward, bringing them face to face. He moved his hand from his neck to his cheek, stroking the bristly skin of his morning beard. Under his touch, Steve softened his glance and started to purr. Tony bit his lip, watching with fascination this horny super-Alpha tamed with a caress.
But Tony knew, as a matter of fact, that all the good things have to end. They had to save the world, as Steve reminded him. Ugh, such a waste of time...
It took a few months to settle down before starting a sort of functional relationship that did not compromise teamwork. And as much as he was less than amused at first, Tony was sure that seen from the outside the situation would have been hilarious.
There was nothing weird if Steve stopped to have dinner with him after they trained together. Nor was there anything weird in repeating that experience several times, and more and more often, inserting variations, perhaps, between the themes of the meetings.
Tony just didn't know where all this would lead. And for a control freak like him he was bizarre that he wasn't worried about it. A part of him felt reassured that he was committed with Pepper, because there was another part – a rather new and unknown and a bit frightening part – that felt flattered by Steve's attentions. Too flattered, honestly. In a completely unexpected way. So well, really, it was great that Tony was currently engaged in a serious relationship with Pepper. Because get a crush over a teammate that was clearly acting just for the sake of both their biology, well, that would be a damn mess.
Tony was looking at him now, and he realize that it no longer mattered that he was an Alpha. Or maybe he did, but it was a whole other kind of matter.
Steve straightened up immediately. That was the first time Tony had called him that without joking, the first time he had really called him as an Alpha, who needed him in
Howard had been an acceptable father – authoritarian when not absent, but hey, it could have been worse, if nothing else the emotional void was filled by the presence of his
Faced with that spontaneous confession, Steve didn’t know what to say. His inner Alpha stepped forward and replied in his place, resuming his purr again. Tony shot him a puzzled look, an adorable blush that made its way up his cheeks.
Then Mrs. Barton came to ask him to take a look at the tractor. Tony leave Steve and followed her knowing that the tension between them was far from subsided. But he can’t do more than that, he just can’t. They were acting again as a human shield between the Earth and a threat of apocalyptic proportions, and this time its all Tony’s fault. He held himself up with nails and teeth, in constant struggle to keep up with himself, and now also in struggle to keep up with the very person he was falling in love with.
Now Steve was there, in a small room of the S.H.I.E.L.D. sickbay, with one knee on the ground and a t-shirt in his hand. With Tony's  staring astonished at him.
How he managed to seem so innocent yet luscious as he keep staring hungrily at him? Steve allowed himself to kiss him again, this time with all the self-control he could put.
Yes, Steve knew how to keep a secret. It was certainly not the hardest part of the matter. The hardest part was waking up with an Omega at the bedside and absorbing all his concern for you. To think that it’s beautiful and that it can’t be better. Then to find himself at the door of his nest-room.
None of those present made a turn: those exits were typical of Stark. Steve held his breath and released it when the meeting room door closed behind the Omega. He remained nailed in his chair for a few minutes, stiff with tension.
“I'm plagued with a doubt and only you can‒ nah." he stops again while opening the jar, “Hey, Cap! How are you? Just wondering if‒ ugh!” he sticks the spoon in the jar,“ Hey‒
He smirked at the idea of posing for Captain America, a ridiculous – far ridiculous – picture of himself splayed over a sofa, just the arc reactor on him, full
After the serum he had noticed how his olfact had increased, as well all the other senses, but it had not been an epochal change. Now, in 2012, surrounded by people constantly on drugs, this put him in an uncomfortable position. As reserved and honest as he was, Steve didn't care in the least to discover the secrets of the people around him.
“I was stupid and impulsive and paid no attention to my health.” He listed anyway, unable to restrain himself.
was sweaty, Steve was not even out of breath – damn him and his serum – and for Tony's calculating mind it was not easy to avoid lingering on the potential implications of such stamina.
Tony braces himself to be able to look at him. Which is not very smart considering that, yes, his suspicions were right: Captain America is a breathtaking sight even just woke up. And Tony's dick wants to let the whole world know.
“Can you feel it?” He ran a hand on the left side of his neck and Steve followed the movement with a hungry gaze, “Of course you feel it.”
Then Laura comes to ask Tony for something, and Steve just stays there. He watches Tony speechless as he walks away, the scent of flowers still in his nostrils.
Steve sneaked back to his room and is now lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling without rest. The six months he has given himself have almost ended, a resolution must be taken. Whether he's just insane or not, something has happened in the meantime. Something that obviously isn't just affecting him. And it wouldn't be fair to Tony to keep it from him.
Steve didn't said nothing, but growled softly and stared at him with a look that was probably intended to be reproaching. It had quite another effect on Tony.
But now that particular secret was out, filling with unspoken questions the void between the two of them. Steve couldn't help but be curious: Stark was a strange puzzle. Much of the frustration that had hovered over their first encounter was due to the fact that Steve just couldn't quite figure it out the man.
He was there to fix things with Steve, to reassure him. Even if he feel absolutely nonsensical that he –
He had goosebumps all over his skin. He felt the blood drumming in his hears. He could smell his own pheromones giving out very explicit signal. Shit. He felt like a fucking gawky teenager – and he was
Scenes like this were played more or less at the end of each mission. It was an unorthodox way to release tension, but for Tony was fine. He was happy to be able to play with his own sub-genre and pretend to flirt with an Alpha. He had never done either. Having the opportunity to experiment in that way with someone he could trust was a new and interesting thing, liberating even.
as he entered the experiment cell was that there was a war out there that was devastating the whole world, and
For the first time since Stark had gave it to him, Steve paid attention to the ice cream. He made a face when he noticed how it had melted to his elbow, and that must been a funny face, as Stark greeted him with a laugh. Red with embarrassment, Steve muttered an answer as he sucked ice cream off his fingers.
So yes, Steve was really scary. But everyone expected it, didn't they? While Tony – well, nobody was prepared for
In a society where each sub-genre has a defined role and the interactions between them are predetermined, how should be taken an Omega who invites you to nest with him outside the heat?
“It's a bit old-fashioned.” He said condescendingly, “But I've just discovered to have a certain taste for dated things.”
Again, the hand in the middle of his back pressed down and Tony let himself be guided placidly. It wasn't exactly unpleasant to spread himself over Steve's body and let him cuddle him, rub his face against his neck, inhale his smell. It wasn't definitely a bad experience look at Steve and let himself be seen in the astonished silence of mutual wonder.
He’s confused when Natasha asks Steve if he’d like to train with her and he answers that he just wants to chill reading. He even waves a book in his hand. But then what happens is that Steve goes down to the lab to do ‒ who knows what? The book is usually soon forgotten and later Tony will have to send Dum-E to return it to him. The rest of the time Steve just keeps buzzing around him, touching things he shouldn't touch, asking questions that distract him from his work. Tony appreciates the company, really, but he doesn't understand.
Nobody had ever set foot there, not even the cleaners. Being his sub-genre a secret, Tony had included that particular romm in the Tower project making sure that no one knew about it. It had been built by his robots and they always managed it.
Steve had never met the colonel, but he knew him by reputation, he knew how much him and Stark had shared. And he knew something about friendships that span decades and survive wars and tragedies. So he was pretty sure Rhodes wouldn't judge his best friend in any way. But he still refrained from carrying on that speech: it was clear that Stark had his ideas on the matter and there would be no point in getting in the way, if not to annoy him. Steve was in no position to advise him on such a personal aspect. The fear of losing a loved one is sometimes able to raise barriers that over time become impassable ramparts: breaking them down is no small job.
Broadly speaking, things went always like this. There was some mission at the end of the world and a small group of them were sent to risk the neck bone, they came back dented but alive and in serious sleep deprivation. By tacit agreement, during the work Rogers was impeccable, they both are – and Tony would not have been able to say if he had to thank the air filters of his armor or the admirable self-control of Rogers or both – probably both. But for sure he would never have denied that in the battlefield the two of them worked perfectly.
“Please!” Steve covered his eyes, “We were like brothers. He was just protective around me. And he wasn't entirely wrong.”
, I get frozen at twenty-five.” He pointed out while putting on an apron, “While how old are you this year? Let me do the math…”
He felt revved up and no, he wouldn’t pretend that all this wasn’t fun. Maybe a little hazardous, but absolutely fun. Well, that night they were alone in the Tower, so there was no one who could judge him.
. Hello. Look, I might as well be wrong, I'm not perfect even though I look, but... uh... I get this vibe from you? And maybe‒ maybe‒"
“Fourty one.” He finished for him with an obvious expression, as if shocked by the fact that Steve didn't know the answer, “For a total of forty-two.”
“It was a hell.” He nodded, “For someone like me, if nothing else. But today it is different, especially for someone like you.”
“See, this is where the heroes fall.” He then declaimed grabbing his wrist, “Those like you.” He specify as he brought his fingers to his mouth and, oh, how the tables had turned, huh?
“Yeah.” Stark swallowed the last piece of ice cream and grimaced, “Can you imagine how he would react if he founds out that I lied to him for almost thirty years?”
“Yup?” Tony didn’t seem willing of lowering his arms, holding them under his blaster, “No, I mean, I don't know them, do I? Get off the helmets, would you?”
Tony glances at the sketchbook and then snatches it quickly, as if Steve hadn't left it there on purpose. He put some distance walking backwards, the sketchbook open in his hands, an astonished gaze traveling between Steve and the drawn sheets.
Then Tony grinned and batted his eyelashes to him and said something like: “Oh yes, Alpha my Alpha!”
And here it goes the door, clearly opened with a force disproportionate to what it was: the miserable door of a small room of the sickbay.
The third thing Steve notices happens after so long that in the meantime he has almost forgotten about everything.
Tony got up from the tatami and pulled up his arms, stretching himself lazily. Steve tried not to get distracted by the elegant arch created by his back, and above all by the interesting counter-arch created by his ass. Because Tony had started to speak at supersonic speed – as usual – putting several arguments one after one – again as usual – and opening parentheses inside other parentheses with various annotations and appendices and “ah did I ever tell you about that time?” and going to end with a nice “anyway what I was saying?”. As usual.
Steve found himself growling in frustration a few times. Across the table, Tony stretched his feet to meet his and hid the satisfaction behind his cup of coffee. In all this, they had to regain some kind of dignity and collect the amused looks and the comrades' comments from their team-mates.
It belonged to them that sort of hesitant dance in which they fell at the end of each mission. It belonged to them the exchange of phrases that sounded less and less like a ‘sort-of-flirting-but-just-for-fun-and-stress-relief’, and were becoming more and more a ‘oh-fuck-we-are-actually-flirting’. It belonged to them the sublte shift from the exchange of words to the exchange of act.
“That they pumped me out of serum. Now I can be stupid and impulsive without having to worry too much about killing myself in the process.”
Steve tries hard not to find his stubbornness to avoid his gaze unnerving and at the same time adorable.
Like the one he was willingly undergoing now: Steve leaning towards him, sniffing the air between them. It was a bit odd knowing that he’s studying his smell in all its nuances, sensing what even Tony wasn’t able to explain.
taken advantage of it. But, hey, it wasn't every day routine that someone actively cared about him. He was Captain America: everyone took it for granted that someone like him didn't need anything or anyone. So big, so strong, ever in charge.
than usual. And God only knows as I wish you were with me. It's the first time I want to share my heat with an Alpha, you know? But I just-” Steve's words finally sink into him, “Wait... what?”
Steve realizes that she’s right. He also realizes that in such a world, with all what he represents and the unknowns that his life holds, relying on a psychologist could be a risky move.
Not that Tony is complaining, at all. He just thinks that if this thing ‒ what ‘thing’? He doesn't want to give it a name for now, thank you very much ‒ if this
Tony rests his chin on his closed fists and puts on a pout. However much he manages to keep it in the current situation.
Except that, at the end of it all, when he and Tony are saying goodbye ‒ when Steve hears him talking about how he'd like to drop everything and build a farm like Barton did ‒ the wind blows between them bringing the smell of wildflowers. And when Steve looks at him, he thinks, certainly in a moment of total madness, that he shouldn't be surprised by now. He should expect it, to see wildflowers bloom and fade into Tony's hair.
That Steve wasn't his Alpha, but Tony was still an Omega and no, he wouldn't have denied this in front of him. They had gone too far. And it was fine. Steve was fine. Steve had his trust, he had earned it.
“Pizza flour?” He read, “In the era blessed with instant noodles and microwave oven, why should you waste time making pizza with your own hands? I mean, if I want to work hard and then eat badly, all I have to do is just go to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s refectory. -
“How many laps have you done? Nah, I don't want to know. Here.”, He hands him one of the ice cream, “I'd kill to have your metabolism.”
The palm of his hand slid across a broad chest and over a muscular shoulder, found warm skin that throbbed under his fingers and rested there. Under him resounded a deep, soft approval grumbling. It penetrated in his bones and went straight to his morning wood.
“You are the one who was comparing me and your pre-serum version of penniless art student from the New York lower class burdened by the Great Depression.”
Steve’s voice wants so badly to be sure but in reality it falters. And Tony smiles: it’s nice to feel like he can read so clearly his emotions too, sometimes.
nd there was no room for self-pity. There were no support groups for dated superheroes without the slightest foundation on how to start living again. When he enlisted for Project Rebirth, Steve knew the risks of war.
The effort they had to make to break out from the mist of pheromones and emerge out that bed was unimaginable.
And seriously, it was paradoxical and completely insane. Because Tony had spent his whole life pretending to be Beta and dodging the Alpha as if his life depended on it, and now he was working side by side with one of them and joking with him, being able to show a side of himself that he had show to nobody. Not even to Pepper.
Tony lowered his head and raised a hand. Steve was a good person, but Tony knew from personal experience how good people can become when the Alpha emerges without restrains. And that was a fucking super Alpha.
When a robotic arm served them the steaming cups, the smile on Steve's face opened completely, showing all his teeth. At a safe distance, Tony looked at the fangs made to bite and thought that they were not as frightening on him as they were on Howard – or on any other Alpha he unfortunately runned into. Maybe it was the blue sky of his eyes that sweetened the whole, or maybe it was the chocolate mustache that gave him a childish air. Or maybe – well, maybe it was the fact that Steve, despite being a forge of pheromones and had all the reasons to become non-stop feral, had never done anything to Tony.
what Howard wanted in a son – Omega or not, it didn't matter a fucking thing. No. Tony refused even to
What remained between Tony's armor and his heart, that seemingly unbridgeable void, he had tried to fill it in many ways. With success, with money, with sex, with alcohol. But they had always been ephemeral, temporary fillers.
“I went into the ice for seventy years and survived. I met an alien demi-god who throws lightning and flies with a hammer. I fought against monsters from outer space and an army of robots. Not to mention our lovely doctor, who has a habit of becoming a green giant with some anger problems."
Helen is puzzled, but she doesn't object: it’s hard to find someone of the team voluntarily to be checked.
, and he was sure that Steve saw the Omega and Tony didn't know what to do, he had never been with an Alpha, he spent all his life avoiding them–
“None ‘but’.” He stopped him, “To have a hypertrophic ego, you don't really know how to take compliments.”
. It's easy to not grasp certain nuances when you don't get to know the real man behind the armor, and Steve doesn't mean the Iron Man suit.
Tony greets him with the usual bright smile, and the usual sunflowers blooming in his hair. Then he brings his attention back to his work and the sunflowers recede, making room for the comings and goings of multicolored blossoms that weave in his hair when he's working on something. Steve is used to it by now, but he’ll never stop liking it. He will never stop being amazed.
Because words were no longer enough. So, without making too much resistance, they were finding themselves responding to each other's call. In a world where everything was regulated by the smell and the language through it, society had chosen to repress that resource, and the two of them were not in a position to change the rules. But in that dance they had chosen to make their own rules.
“Give me a week. Maybe ten days? I don't know.” Tony picked up the device and pressed it on his neck, activating it, “This time I want to bypass the implant. I'm not going burn trough synthetic hormones for days again.”
For this he had stolidly ignored the Quinjet landing, as if he had not had an eye all the time on a holographic projection of the return journey. Again, he had stolidly ignored J.A.R.V.I.S.’ notification about Steve’s imminent coming down to the lab. A little less stolidly he had welcomed said coming.
Steve smiles at him knowingly and Tony just wants to wipe that smug expression off his face with a punch, though he thinks that he’d just dislodge his wrist. On the other hand, Steve's hand has slipped on his ass and now he's fondly squeezing a cheek. Tony remembers very well what those hands did a few hours earlier in the same area of his body, and that doesn't help him at all.
“Nah.” Stark shrugged, “Well, I'm almost sure that Fury found out with his ways and Natasha isn't one who can be fooled. And Banner…” Between one lick and another of ice cream Stark took on a thoughtful expression, “Frankly I'm happy that when he pulls out the Hulk I always have the armor on, ‘cause I think that the beast can feel it.”
“Thank you?” Mumbled, “I mean, I’m certainly not the epitome of the Omega. In fact, that’s why I can easily pass for a Beta. I'm far from society's aesthetic dictates.”
Steve wanted to reply that, in his humble sight, his ass fit perfectly into the aesthetic dictates. But he wisely thought it was not the time to make lewd comments about his body.
That was only the first of many disastrous DIY dinners that neither of them digested, as many trash films that they put on only to be able to comment out loud. If they had eaten well or seen a good movie, they couldn’t have spent those hours pretending not to wooing eachother. Because those evenings weren't dates, absolutely not. But that didn't stop them from flirting badly, unable to call things by their name and carry them on properly.
Where "variations" means that sometimes it was Steve who helped Tony train – supporting the barbell or keeping his legs during the abs. And God only knew how much Tony hoped that Steve was too focused on the exercises to be able to feel the subtle but rather
In a not too distant future, for example, Steve would run into a ghost from his past, and he would almost die at the hands of that ghost. Engaged elsewhere, Tony wouldn’t have been there to guard him, thus finding himself breaking that now proven rule. The consequences would have been unpredictable and to soothe the Omega it wouldn’t have been enough just a purr.
had managed to do something good, and that he could continue to do it. The price to pay was no longer his health –
He doesn't grasp why when the guys go out to eat Steve declines, saying is not hungry. When, in fact, ten minutes later he shows up to Tony with something to eat. And Tony, who hasn't eaten but coffee and energy bars for about ‒ ten hours? ‒ pounces on it hungrily. Whatever he’s currently doing can wait until his stomach is full again. Steve looks satisfied, Tony doesn't understand why
his attention on Fury. There was nothing that could freak him out like an Omega in anguish. But Stark was officially a Beta and
Steve hadn't put his Alpha voice into that word, but Tony could feel the effort he was making in refraining from doing so. The same one he put in staying firmly there, at a safe distance from him, with the gear bag hanging from one shoulder and the torn up door handle clutched hard in one hand.
And it was of little importance that at that moment Tony wished with every fiber of his being that a certain impulsive, intrusive not-so-knot-head entered through that door and pollute that room. Possibly, that would also pollute
stress by annihilating every type of chemical cocktail with which he tried to put a brake on his hormones.
, he moves again around the workstation. He seems so wary, almost like a wild animal approaching. Steve forces himself to stay still, too scared of making him run away again to make even the slightest movement.
But there are far more important issues to focus on. Like a pangalactic war to try to avoid. So, while they're arguing into the Helicarrier, Steve files that detail as one of many eccentric rich quirks, and puts it aside.
.” Tony made a laugh, but it was a tiny melancholy one, “I love to gossip when I'm not involved. If you want the details I am sure Happy will be able to inform you. Anyway…” He clapped his hands, “You are a champion to apologize but not at explain why.”
, and Bruce – bless him – taken by to second-hand embarrassment, tried in vain to divert the conversation; but Tony, well, he was
Afraid to startle him, he slipped slowly under the covers, and tried to settle in the bed without taking too much space with his massive size. Said space didn't have to be a problem for Tony, because a moment later he had cut a perfect corner for himself under Steve’s arm, limbs wrapped over him, and face tucked under his neck. Steve let him settle on him whatever he wanted, unsure if he was allowed to touch him back.
he was expecting, yet it was so, so every time that sigh came. And sometimes, oh, sometimes Tony turned for the sole purpose of smiling at him with a soft but full smile. So, even if Clint destroyed the moment starting to clash
, you can make me breakfast even if you have nothing to forgive yourself for, you know? Handmade portraits… let's talk about it, mh?”
Steve knows that any choice he makes will be risky. But he also knows that making a choice without first considering all the possibilities is a leap in the dark. And he wouldn't be a good strategist if he didn't carefully consider everything before making a decision.
“Tony, it's all right. It was just a bad dream.” He murmured softly, “Can I stay here? Just in case you need me, okay? I’ll not touch you. Just here.”
With a snarl, Steve pull away from his neck. Tony snarled back and gave him a kiss that felt more like a bite. For a brief, breathless moment, they looked at at each other in wonder. Then, their mouths clashed, chasing each other with kisses and bites and licks.
Tony’s breath falters, his eyes going wide. The succession of flowers blooming and fading in his hair is too chaotic to keep up with.
Tony is lying on the worn out couch down in his lab, a wet patch on his eyes burned from too much work, and a glass of centrifuge in his hand. He finishes it just before the phone call is taken, and hands the empty glass to Dum-E.
With considerable effort, Steve took his eyes off Tony and raised them to Natasha, who was standing next to him, smug as always despite her bed hair and the fluffy pink pajama. He opened his mouth to answer, but was unable to come up with something that made sense, so he just watched her sipping her coffee slyly.
Oh man, how could he always understand the opposite of what Steve meant? How he could end up to a ferocious self deprecation
under him was moving, breathing on his hair. Tony felt a hand wrapping around his, the other slipping under the edge of the t-shirt and spreading in the middle of his back, pressing gently in a gesture he knew so well.
Luky for Tony that his jaw was attached to the skull, or he should have picked it up from the floor.
The line goes down, and Tony would like to have a shell cell phone to close dramatically. Sometimes Stark technology is too advanced even for him.
Steve settled himself better on the floor, his arms crossed on the bed and his chin resting on it. And he resume to wait, trying to project
Steve lifts him effortly and seats him on the workstation, making space between his legs. Tony wraps his arms around his neck and pulls him down, exposing his neck to his kisses. The soft skin under his ear is inviting and Steve takes it between his lips and sucks, slipping his hand into his hair, his fingers sliding like silk between the rose petals. The moan that escapes Tony’s lips is faint, almost shy. He clings to Steve and presses, presses desperately, as if he were afraid of him suddenly disappearing. Steve grabs his face and lifts it to kiss him again, to take all that desperation off him. He’s there for Tony, to welcome his tongue in the warmth of his mouth and make it his.
The litany of heartbreaking pleads ceased slowly, accompanied by sobs and light whine. Tony was calming down, his conscience re-emerging from the nightmare’s twists, but the process was long and painful. Steve's inner Alpha was pawing, but he kept it at bay: he wished he could have done more, but he knew that any move would only cause Tony to panic.
