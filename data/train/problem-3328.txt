“This looks really good Cas.” The man’s husky voice rang out much closer than he thought it would.
He let out a moan and reached out his hands to try the same for Dean. If he felt even a fraction of what Castiel was currently experiencing then he wanted him to have it. Dean moaned in return before his hands roamed south. He took Castiel’s dick in hand, fully erect now, and stroked it slow and rough.
Sam risked a look at Dean’s face and he saw that that same mask was back on his face again. He looked at his father and saw the start of anger and it was immediately put out with an exhale, like he was releasing it from his body.
“Well it’s not my weekend to babysit so I don’t have anything planned.”
Surprised. That’s the only way that he could describe how he was feeling right now. Not only did Lawrence have a nice, little Inn to stay in, he was lucky enough to find one that had a decent rate for extended stay. Everything he would need was in decent walking distance of the place he chose to stay. Hometown Inn. There was a little grocery store around the corner that had a pharmacy, a park a few blocks over, and the town’s library was a mile jog away. The weather was nice enough, winter had just broken here and spring was clawing its way in. This place was all too perfect, he’d hate to have to leave here.
“How’d you get here?” he looked past him outside to see some small modern, probably electric eyesore sitting in his driveway. “Ugh you rented a car? Why didn’t you ask Bobby for something?”
Once they finished eating Cas offered to help Ellen clean up, but she swatted him with a towel and chased him out of the kitchen to join everyone else in the living room, where they were all gathered by the tree. It was gift opening time and Dean could barely contain his excitement. Once Bobby gave the ok everyone dove towards the presents. It was all in good fun, though they were shoving each other out of the way. Cas made it a point to lightly elbow Dean in the side trying to get at the gift that Sam got him. Dean turned to see one of the biggest smile’s he’d ever seen on the other man. The corners of his eyes were wrinkled due to how big it was, his nose scrunched up, and all his teeth were showing. It made him look truly childlike. Not to mention how the lights on the tree played off his irises, making his blue eyes shinier. He looked gorgeous like this, it took Dean’s breathe away for a moment, it was infectious and he couldn’t help but to return it. Sam had gotten him a new herb grinder and some rolling papers, plus a couple of graphic t-shirts. It was sweet to see the tender smile and thanks he tossed his brother’s way.
“Hurry up and come back here.” Cas growled.
He was greeted with a smile, Dean in a botton-up, and well displayed spaghetti on fancy looking China. The tablet even had a table cloth on it, and a metal bucket with a wine bottle chilling off to the side.
The man was going insane on his entrance at this point, fingers moving at a quick pace and going quite deep within him. Half bent over at this point, and he was still moving with such an intensity it was insane. Castiel was almost mad himself with pleasure. Mind blank except for whatever Dean was doing. He couldn’t even recall the last time he blinked.
“Yes.”
“You ready to head out?”
“Yeah there’s nothing casual about it.”
“Good, good.” His father clearly racking his brain for something else to say.
“My name is Missouri and you have the job. I expect you here at 8 o clock every morning to help me open up. You’re shift will be from 8-4pm when my closing girl comes in. Your responsibilities are to keep the place clean and neat, run the register, and answer the phones. I have a book on the shelf below the till draw where you write appointments.”
Cas took Charlie’s advice since he really had nowhere else to turn. He went over to Dean’s place with a bag of take-out burgers and milkshakes. When he arrived Dean had just gotten out of the shower and let him in with glistening, flushed skin and a tiny towel wrapped around him. It took a lot out of him not to jump Dean right then and there. Why would he answer the door like that? Did he have no clue what it would do to him? He thought as he sat on the couch.
Bobby let’s go of a throat laugh before he continues speaking. “None of that sir crap around here son. That’s John’s deal. You just call me Bobby and nothing more.”
They’d finished their meetup and he decided to go home to see if his father is around. He does miss the man now that they hardly see each other. His father had even called him earlier that morning to ask if he was officially moving out of the house. Though his father didn’t mean it to, it actually hurt a bit. Even Charlie had felt slightly abandoned. When he puts his mind to it, he and Dean have been pretty wrapped up in each other. They were both pretty excited with the holidays coming up, though he’s a little happier about it than Dean appears to be. Charlie spilled that Dean has no idea what to get him and he gave her a couple ideas to give Dean so he wouldn’t be totally lost. Castiel wasn’t a material person, he never really had to want for anything in his life. But he did like the fact that Dean wanted to get him something thoughtful and heart felt and was only seeking a general idea of what he would like. The gesture was sweet and brought a warm blush to his face when she told him.
“Well this was more fun than a man with a 1 year old probably deserves. We should probably head out before Ellen tries to keep my kid hostage.” Sam got up and motioned for Dean to do the same.
The two men and Charlie at least looked a little remorseful for their actions. Personally, it didn’t really bother Castiel. He could understand where they were coming from, being protective of the ones you loved. Dean deserved to have people in his corner that were willing to go to bat for him. The conversation took a definite term as they began paying attention to the movie. Everyone learned that Castiel really had no knowledge of the Marvel cinematic universe. Dean got very excited that he could go through all of the movies with him, bringing out his own excitement to be a part of this.
“Wish you were here to help.”
“Wanna grab some burgers together? I know this great spot over on Main street. We can even get it to go if you really wanna get home.”
“What do you think Castiel?” Charlie must’ve read Dean’s mind somehow.
Cas: omw
Squeezing tight was doing the trick, the look in Dean’s eyes, that unbridled pleasure, was what did him in. He nodded his agreeance as he erupted. No way could he deny this man anything.
“Are you going to reject it?” he opened his editing software, and plugged in the memory card so he can begin what they are there for.
“Hey Cas.” Dean paced back and forth in his living room with the phone to his ear and a baby sitting on his hip trying his hardest to take the phone away from him. “I was just wondering if you wanted to ya know watch a movie or something.”
Finally gathering the courage, and partly due to the time he’d finally sent the message.
“You know good and well what we wanna listen to Sammy.” He smirked.
“Hey Sammy what’s up?” Cas perked up and mouthed to Dean his greetings. “Cas says hi.”
“That was a surprise.” He chuckled as Dean leaned his head on his shoulder.
“Hey sunshine.” He walked in as Castiel moved to the side. “How you feeling today?”
“Cassie! That’s a great idea. I know just the place.” He said with a mischievous look in his eyes.
He couldn’t accept that. It didn’t feel right to base the one relationship he actually wanted to go far, on a bunch of really big lies. It hurt, really did, that his own flesh and blood would just shoot him down like that without even hearing his side. Drinking the rest of his glass all in one go, Dean then pushed back from the table and walked out of the backdoor. He needed air and he got it for the remainder of the meeting.
“I’m very glad you made it through that ordeal Dean. I’m also glad you refrained from telling me until this morning.”
“Alright, Sam and I are gonna take a walk around the building, scope out all our entrance points. Then we’ll come back here and form a plan.”
“Charlie can we please leave?” Castiel growled his plea.
It was more than hot coffee worming it’s warmth between his joints. That damned smile was knocking him off the high horse of loneliness that he was used to riding on. He put his whole soul into hoping this wasn’t a one-time thing, and those hopes quickly came to fruition when Dean put on his shoes and was ready to go.
Castiel wouldn’t let himself hope for anything but that.
He proceeded to tell her all the things that transpired between last night and up until this afternoon, obviously omitting the part where he drank himself into unconsciousness. He watched her face fall with every sentence uttered and it took a heap of strength he didn’t know he had to finish the tale.
“Y’all in here torturing my friend?”
“I want details now. Like right now.”
“Hey Cassie. Just letting you know I’m heading out.”
Castiel wanted nothing more in this moment than to finally be with Dean the way they both clearly wanted. Dean made him feel safe, wanted. He never pushed too far and maintained a beautiful balance of soft and rough. He was the perfect partner in all aspects, always knew just what Castiel wanted in each moment. It was breathtaking, but more importantly it was easy. He didn’t have to think too much with Dean, but he couldn’t shake that dark feeling. Dick had been that way in the beginning….but then he took too much.
He thought to himself. He rose to actually wash his body then hesitantly left the warm embrace of the shower. When we left the bathroom he could hear his phone vibrating violently from his desk in the corner. Not bothering to look at what name was on the screen he picked it up and held it to his ear.
“Did you give the housewarming some thought?”
“I really don’t wanna do this.”
“Wow Cas…you look awesome.”
He looked at Cas and with a firm hand on his shoulder, turned him to meet his intense gaze. With that same hand he pressed his calloused palm to Castiel’s stubble. He moved his fingers, softly, hoping the touch would get his point across. They were taking a big step, a giant, heaping step. This was no small task to Dean. He wasn’t sure what it meant to Cas, but this meant a hell of a lot to Dean. His family was his lifeline, the people that kept him going, kept him alive. The fact that he wanted to bring him around such a big piece of him meant that he wanted Castiel to be apart of that lifeline.
“I’m not sure if you’ll remember it as it’s quite—shit” he stammered as Dean finally put his mouth to him, “It’s old, but the one with the tentacle dildo.”
“Yeah like how you wouldn’t even let me see my boys half the time!? That you regulatin’ too?”
Castiel was surrounded by dense fog and nothing else. He walked aimlessly for what felt like hours, searching for a way out or a reason why. Either would do in this endless land of nothing. Everything was washed in gray tones, no actual light source but he could see what direction he was walking in. This was different than his normal visions, their setting always being the forest that his colony lived in. Something familiar to put him in a state of relaxation while he was shown an uneasy message. He sat down, somehow bogged down by exhaustion from all the walking. From the fog a figure began to appear. A dark silhouette in the shape of a woman, made of viscous blackness. He watched, not in fear, but in curiosity of what this figure would do.  It just stood there; tendrils of its darkness floated around it. The head of it turned to his direction, just staring with no eyes until it spoke with no mouth, and clear as day in the voice of his mother:
“It’s a date.”
“I—um—“ Castiel was burning with embarrassment now, post-orgasmic glow ruined as he was now mortified by his words.
“That depends on the couple boo. Why do you ask?”
“Listen buddy we do not throw food in this family. Your Dad insists that you eat this rabbit food and until you’re an adult you have to do just that.”
“I feel like I should get something for my troubles.”
“I see that but why? And why this late at night?”
Dean was getting antsy, and that was putting it lightly. He was worried and felt kind of bad for not noticing Cas slip away like that. At first he’d been relieved to see Balthazar jump on what was happening and trailed after him towards the bathroom, but now he was worried. They’d been taking a bit too long for his liking, even if there had been a line to get in. He told Charlie where he was going and made his way through the dense crowd. Once he got to the door there was no line at all. He pushed on the handle to find it was locked…..no no nonononoo no. This wasn’t right. This was a bathroom in a popular club, no way would it be a single stalled bathroom. There’d be a line out the door. He was panicking now, felt bile rising up his esophagus at all the possible scenarios that crept out of the darkest corners of his mind. He looked around for anyone that could help him. Immediately running towards the bar, he flagged down the first bartender who he made contact with.
“Good morning Sammy.” Dean held the phone slightly farther away from his voice fearing that his brother would break his eardrums.
The woman’s service was quick and sooner than expected Castiel was digging into his plate of cheesy bacon fries and sipping from an ice cold beer. He sensed someone coming towards him, and out the corner of his eye he saw a man sit on the stool next to him. Peculiar, most of the bar was empty seats and this man chose to sit directly next to him.
Cas took this at his signal to back away. Gabe always hugged Castiel whenever he had a panic attack and it brought him out.
“I understand Dean.” Castiel cut off his nervous rambling. “The thought is nice and I’m very appreciative. But I must tell you that you don’t have to take me to an expensive restaurant every time we go out. I’d be happy just driving around with you in your car.”
“Sorry.” He mumbled through the last bites of his bacon.
Once he picked up Cas they headed over to his favorite steak shop in town. He took Sammy here when he first moved to Sioux Falls. It was only a couple months after Jess’ funeral and Sammy wanted a fresh place to start. What better place then around the corner from your brother? Dean was excited that day that Sammy had signed all the paperwork and was officially a homeowner. They went out to the steak house with Bobby and Ellen to celebrate their sudden reunion.
“You ok Cas?” worry was written all over Dean’s face.
Dean hung up the phone, and he wanted to put it back on the night stand, but he couldn’t bring himself to reach over. He could barely breathe let alone move. Cas crawled up until they were face to face. He kissed Dean softly everywhere he could reach. His eyes, nose, cheeks, lips, and forehead all were showered with soft drops of affection. Should he really go see his father? Dean had always had a handle on everything in his life. He worked hard for everything he had. Hell he worked hard for everything Sam had too. He was always on top of everything, but this little dark corner of his life was the only thing out of his control. His father was unpredictable, tough, and ruthless. Dean use to think he did what he did out of love, but after years of suffering with their tattered relationship he wasn’t even sure if his father had even loved him. Those words never left his lips according to Dean’s memory.
He raised his hands and stomped out of the apartment slamming the door behind him. That was the last noise made for a while. Once his boots were out of hearing distance Dean broke down. His chest heaving and his breathe rapid. Castiel rushed to his side wrapping him in a tight embrace. Sam stood not far behind. His support looming over his brother’s shoulder.
Cas turned his head and Dean followed to find Charlie on the other side of Sam laughing about something he had said. She waved and turned her attention back to Sam.
A half hour later and the pizza arrived, it was officially break time. They cracked open a pair of beers, cheers to some good luck in their future. Nights like these were what Dean missed the most while his brother was off getting his fancy law degree. He was damn proud of all that he accomplished but he’d be a blue faced liar if he said he didn’t miss him.
“I know. Sam said you met with your Dad today.”
It was late, 1 am when Sam crept down the stairs of Bobby’s house to find his Dad in the kitchen, huddled over a glass of water with his head in his hands. He could see beads of sweat had formed on the man’s forehead despite it being quite cool in the house. Sam pulled out a chair and John’s head popped up at the sound, fixing his youngest son with a small, gentle smile.
Cas felt a growl grow within him and before he could move Dean had crossed the room and stood at his side.
He took it with the upmost reluctance glancing in Cas’ direction for help. He just stared at his friend like he wanted to skin her alive.
So they went and sat on the couch, Dean with the bag on his lap digging through the obscene amount of tissue paper and Castiel with his hands on his knees and averting his eyes. He tossed the tissue paper aside, Dean couldn’t help but make a comment about the sheer number of sheets that were stuffed in the bag. Castiel told him how the sales clerk and Balthazar both ganged up on him, telling him that the more paper the better. The shirts came out first and Dean was excited about them, kissing Castiel on the cheek in thanks. He examined each one carefully and tried on the flannels. Castiel would’ve been quite proud of his ability to guess Dean’s size just by looking at the garments, if his stomach wasn’t currently trying to escape his body. When he pulled out the boxer briefs he was silent and his smile disappeared, morphing into a face that he could not decipher.
“Does he like to build things Cassie?”
“No peeking.” Dean’s voice chastises from behind him.
“Cas.” Dean spoke quietly. “If you aren’t ready to talk about this then you don’t have to. I’ll still wanna be with you whether you do or you don’t.”
Castiel was struggling at this point.
“That may be the case but it’s not gonna stop me from trying.” He took a pause and a deep breathe. “I may not…agree with the way you wanna live your life Dean…but I’ve realized that it ain’t my place to agree. It’s my place to support. And for all these years I couldn’t understand that. I know I can’t just walk back in your life like nothing happened…like I did in the past. I’ll do what I have to do to show you that I’m man enough to be your father again.”
He went up the elevator instead of the stairs, he didn’t want to run into whoever was watching him in the stairwell. Luckily Dean had recently texted him so when he banged on the door it was open nearly immediately.
“Is everything alright Dean?” he looked up his eyes meeting his boyfriends
“How are you feeling Dean?”
Castiel had a feeling he was referring to the random threats Gabriel had tossed his way when Dean had come to pick him up. Gabriel really was all talk with minimal bite, he actually really liked Dean and talked about him often to Castiel, but he would whine and complain should he ever share that with his partner.
Knee jerk reaction was to say no. Man, woman, or anyone in between he didn’t think he’d want to see Dean with anyone else. Through his computer screen prior to meeting the star of the show was one thing. Dean hadn’t even known he’d existed so he could be fine with that. He could easily block out whoever else was present regardless of how much camera time they got. He was there for Dean. If he agreed to this he’d still be there for him. But it was so much different now.
“Um no I don’t.”
“Ok good. I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
With the shakiest inhale he left the room, with laptop in hand.
“Usually I wouldn’t, but I find myself doing a lot of things I wouldn’t do when it comes to you.” He drummed on Castiel’s backside. “Now sit your fine ass down and let’s eat.”
“You know I didn’t Dean.”
Was Dean as much of a coffee man as he was? Taking in several cups a day like he had been for the last few years wasn’t at all healthy, but tell that to early morning Castiel. That guy would behead the nearest anything that came between him and caffeine at first thing. Coffee would be easy, due to his addiction he was aware of all the good spots within a 10 mile radius of his residence. Wouldn’t be difficult at all to sit over some pastries and past the time with good conversation until the steam stop flowing and their mouths were covered in crumbs.
They were led to a booth off to the side. Their menus were laid out and the waiter came to the table with water and they were finally left alone. Dean looked down at the menu with his eyebrows knitted in concentration.
“The bitch fucking bit my dick! The hell you expect me to do?!”
person hmm? This is sweet. Thank you Dean.”
Dean received more shirts from Sam and a new iPod with one of those radio adapters so he’d be able to play it in his car. Bobby had gotten him a bottle of whiskey and a book on ancient Egypt, Ellen got him some new cook books and an iPad.
“Thanks Dean.” His brother beamed at him. “I know you don’t like the chick flick moments, but I really appreciate your support with this.” He played with the hem of his shirt speaking carefully.
“Help? Oh no Dean I’d be there to ruin you.”
It took him a week to scrounge up the courage to go to the shop that Mary had advised him to get a job there. His main motivation was to avoid running out of money. He learned that lesson years ago, it was much better to be uncomfortable in a job he would rather not do, than to have no roof over his head. With her insistent poking reminders at his aid he finally put his suit on and headed over. The jacket and pants were far too large and no matter how many videos on the internet he watched he could never seem to tie his tie correctly, it was the nicest set of clothes he owned and they were perfect interview wear. They belonged to his father, and the only belongings of his that he’d had left.
“I’m on my way over so you better be dressed. I want to smoke before we start the day.”
“We can do that, but I think you should use the restroom first.”
“You can ask anything you want Dean, it’s my choice whether or not to answer it.”
“Yeah he told me.”
With that Dean walked to get in line. Took him a while to conclude that Dean was buying him ice cream. That accompanied some confusing feelings. He didn’t like handouts. Though he’d been on his own, running from shadows and dangerous men most of life, Castiel still prided himself on being an independent person. Sure, it was just an ice cream, nothing to be alarmed about. Dean did know that he was pretty much living at the Inn, what if it got worse from there? What if he tried to buy him food or clothing? He couldn’t accept charity and refused to be pitied. He wasn’t the best off, but it could be worse, and unless it ever got there, he wouldn’t be accepting any help. Castiel had seen and lived in rock bottom, he could handle it on his own.
Finally Castiel pulled back, hesitantly of course and began to strip off the rest of his clothes for Dean. In any other moment but now he’d feel self-conscious being completely naked while Dean was fully closed, but he couldn’t think about that right now. His mind wouldn’t let him.  All that swirled in his head was how he wanted to give himself to Dean, everything that he had. Dean stood there in awe, taking the vision of his lover in all his naked glory.
“Nice to meet you too Cas.” His smile had the nerve to get brighter. “Well I better get ready. Don’t wanna take up too much of y’all time.”
“27. You?”
When he finished his story he was surprised to not find himself in tears. His brain and heart hurt with the retelling, but some small part of himself felt relief. He was finally, finally able to tell Dean, and although it hurt like hell he was proud of himself for being able to. He expected Dean to kick him out of his house and tell him he never wanted to see him again. But when he looked up from his now cold hot chocolate he didn’t expect to see Dean crying.
Hey humans! Got another one for ya. So I actually made art and like section breakers for this story, but I can't figure out for the life of me how to put them in this story. If anyone knows how please help! comment here or dm me on ig @artonphire. Anyways hope you enjoy this chapter!
“How’s it hanging Clarence?”
“Um alright.” Dean did what he was told, curious to find out what this was about. Cas didn’t look mad, more like anxious and he wanted to know why. “What’s going on?”
It was getting to the dildo part and he hadn’t even bothered editing the previous portion fully. He was thoroughly distracted now, and there was no turning down his excitement. It felt good to have Dean compliment him like this. He’d received praise for his work many times over the years, winning himself some awards here and there, but nothing compared to hearing the star of his spank bank telling him that he was good at this.
“I’ll be right back. Gotta take a leak.”
“How you been son?” he asked but his eyes were focused elsewhere. Dean followed his gaze to find everyone else with a stern cold look on their face. They were ready. So ready to protect Dean at the first sight of this meeting going wrong. It eased some of Dean’s nerves and gave him a sense of calm he didn’t think would be possible right now.
“So do you have another class?”
Castiel took a quick glance around the office. It was neat and messy at the same time, but It looked like everything had a place.
“Dean.” He heard Cas’ voice ring out next to him. “You ok?”
“It’s not my place to judge you for what you like. And it’s really none of anyone’s business. You aren’t hurting anyone with it so why do they care?”
“Wait what?” he scoffed. “I never said I didn’t like Dean. I hardly know the man.”
*                             *                             *                             *
He didn’t nod. He just continued to look past him.
“I’m willing to listen if you’re willing to talk.”
“Benny happened to be on set and pulled the fucker off me. He wailed on him until he realized I was having a full blown panic attack. The crew was frozen and didn’t know what to do so they all just stood there. I don’t blame them though cause what can you really do but remove the threat? I almost quit after that but spite kept me going.” *********
“Nope. I wanted to give you guys an actual break. I’m sure your other professors gave you enough to worry about.”
The remainder of the conversation went pretty much the same. Sam and Charlie joining forces trying to bait Dean and poor Castiel into revealing things and talking about things that they pretty much wouldn’t talk about on their own. They glossed over the topic of exes, but Charlie quickly shut that down once she saw the way Cas froze during the topic. Must be a touchy subject. Dean thought to himself. After that the rest was pretty light hearted and Dean was starting to loosen up once he noticed Cas had done the same with the alcohol in his system. He placed a hand on Dean’s thigh at one point telling him how his dad had tried to surprise him with a birthday cake and somehow face planted into it. Dean laughed along trying to hide his nervousness and crippling arousal at the contact with Cas. Luckily the buzzed man hadn’t noticed the change in Dean. He even left his hand there for the remainder of the night.
“Aww you were gonna miss me angel?” he asked copying Castiel’s movements.
“Jerk.”
“Dean? Oh my goodness thanks for answering it’s Chuck.”
Dean awoke the next morning to the screaming ringtone of his phone. He wondered how in the hell Cas could sleep through all this. He jet a hand out feeling around on the night stand until his phone was in his grasp. He picked up the call failing to look at who was calling.
Before he knew it they were sitting in front of his house. Castiel’s mood dropped at arriving so soon. He unbuckled his seat belt and gathered his things moving to leave the car.
Once class ended all the students quickly filed out of the room and as usual Castiel stayed behind. He locked the door to the classroom then walked up to the desk slowly, not trying to startle Dean who was grading a stack of assignments. He looked so drained, as he rubbed at the stubble on his cheeks. His tired eyes gliding across the page and his hand nervously tapping the pen on the wood.
“Then it’s settled. Bye Dean. Bye babe.” She placed a peck on Cas’ cheek and bounced away to her car.
But was the money worth the emotional toil?
They arrived at the inn all too quickly. Castiel didn’t want the night to be over. He wanted to be around Dean and all the spice and flavor he brought to Castiel’s very dull and tense life.
Though he knew full well what Dean meant the statement still stung a little. He hadn’t told Dean too much about him. Fearing that he would run away, or be disgusted with him he avoided the conversation altogether. He wanted nothing more than to prove Dick wrong.
“I’m sorry Dean I shouldn’t even have mentioned it.” He repented approaching the man and wrapping him in a tight embrace.
Walking inside he didn’t bother to close the door. He looked at Dean lying in the same position he had left him in. His eyes looked so distant as he stared at the ceiling barely blinking. He hadn’t even acknowledged Castiel walking back into the room, he was very lost in his thoughts.
“Oh angel. You had this in all day?” he tugged at it gently sending shivers up his boyfriend’s back.
“Class dismissed bitch.”
“I just turned 21 a few days ago.”
“I find you immensely attractive as well Dean.”
“Oh Gabe for heavens sake.” Balthazar groaned.
“He’s not my family Cas, not anymore.”
“As I saw yes.”
“Hello Dean.”
By the third month of them living with Bobby he had been transferred into the local high school. The only thoughts he had walking through the doors that first day was he hoped no one started bullying Johnathan again. He hadn’t heard from the other boy in quite a while and it was messing with him. The thoughts that ran through his mind did nothing to help his weakened mental state. Sam did his best to try to distract Dean when he’d shut down, made every attempt to make him laugh. It helped a little, but that’s only when his brother was around. When alone the darkness threatened his mind and often times he gave in.
“Do you wanna sit? I can stand.” Dean leaned in to talk to Castiel.
“Usually no one really comes out here. This is our smoking spot. But the more the merrier.” She spoke pulling a blunt and lighter from her coat pocket. She handed Dean his own blunt and flashed that sneaky grin again.
“He has two laptops.” He took a sip of his coffee as she lit the first blunt.
“If it’s anyone but my mother they’re gonna get a punch in the face.” He rolled out of bed and threw on the sleep clothes he’d had on before and foregoing the underwear.
“You don’t have to open doors for me Dean.”
“Alright. I’m gonna go now.” He strained, trying to keep his inhale in for as long as he could.
“Hismotheristheleaderofthecoven.”
Hearing his name falling out of the man’s mouth right at the precipice of pleasure was the perfect thing to end him. Oh what a way to go. His member erupted, shooting up and landing on his thighs. His upper body folded over as all his muscles clenched together in ecstasy.
“I’m sorry sweetie I know that had to be hard. How did he take it?”
“Those some strong words Sammy.” Dean couldn’t help but let out a light chuckle at that. Sam was never vulgar, that was Dean’s thing.
“I’m not gonna be the only one topless sweetheart.” Dean spoke as he slid his hands under his boyfriend’s shirt pausing to rub his now perky nipples under his palms.
“Of course! So Gabriel told me that was your first shoot. I liked working with him. I think I want to do another shoot with him if he’s got anything good coming up.” He waggled his eyebrows as he smirked.
Dean thought about that for a minute. Of course he wanted him to come over. He wanted to hold him and lay on his chest under his sheets, listening to his heart beat until he fell asleep. But Dean couldn’t possibly say that. He’d feel like he was being desperate, and desperate wasn’t him. On the other hand he truly didn’t want Cas to see him broken like this. Broken didn’t look good on him and he felt it was too early to show it. Hell he’d been with Lisa for a year before she’d seen him cry.
Dean gulped at that and seemed to be at a loss for words. Two can play that game.
“You were there for 4 hours. Unless you guys moved in slow motion for some reason there’s no way that’s all that happened. Spill Castiel.”
At least they had that in common. Castiel was done for as soon as he’d heard the man’s voice. To see all that naked skin in 3-d just for him had been amazing. He was truly gorgeous and just exuded this aura of other worldliness that Castiel was hopeless against. From the first video he’d brought of Dean’s he was done for.
Castiel exchanged numbers with Dean and had no idea what to do from here. He wasn’t really the dating type, so greatly wrapped up in his work to pay attention to anything else. Rarely even spent time with his family outside of his biweekly dinners with Gabriel when they could. His job was his life and he was fine with that, business was a little slow now and he made it a point to make time for those who remained in his life.
He’d always been a better shot than Sammy, he was the grunt while Sam was the brains. For the sake of time, since they didn’t have any to spare, Sam bowed out and let Dean have his way. Sam knew Dean more than he knew himself most times. He knew the joke and the fact that Dean wanted to go by himself stemmed from the darkest parts within Dean. The joke was an obvious cover-up for his actual feelings, he was terrified. Scared that they would find Cas beaten and battered, and afraid that they wouldn’t find him at all. Going in by himself was Dean blaming himself for what had happened to Cas. He should’ve been the one to pick Cas up that night, in hopes that he could’ve stopped this whole thing from happening. Now wasn’t the time to dwell on Dean’s inner issues and Sam knew that. It was now or never as they went their set, separate ways and walked as quietly as possible.
Dean was on his phone now, looking half angry and half confused at whatever was on the screen. As Castiel took his seat he locked the phone, shoving it into his pocket, and putting his attention on the other man.
“You have a brother?”
After the heavy makeout session with Dean, Castiel decided to meet up with Charlie since she had an ounce of free time. They went to their usual coffee shop and sat at a table near the back. Charlie sipped her coffee between bites of her jelly doughnut.
“I’ll go with him Gabe.” Cas spoke up.
“Mhm.” He barely managed.
“She’s actually almost here. Had to work so she should be here by dessert.”
Of course Sam had called Cas. He was surprised that Sam hadn’t come with him. He expected a full therapy session paired with a raging intervention.
888888888888
“I really don’t wanna hear that Sam.” His blood began to boil as he watched his brother sling around his usual clichés hoping that somehow Dean would magically become a better man.
Once they arrived at Dean’s apartment he was more than happy to get out of his costume. He was even more glad to get Cas out of his. Dean watched Cas as his back was towards him. He took off the antlers and then the shirt. His back glistened with the sweat of the alcohol and the night of dancing. He sauntered over to him and placed a hand on each of his hips. Dean was getting ahead of himself and he needed to be cautious. He kissed at the back of Cas’ neck and trailed them down to his shoulders. ‘Gosh how could he still smell so good after all that dancing?’ Dean wondered to himself. He ran his hands down Cas’ arms, feeling how soft his skin was. Cas’ clothes were very deceiving, Dean would’ve never thought there was all this lean muscle under those button ups.
. He thought. Sam went in front of Dean and had both hands on his shoulders. Dean began his counting and reached ten before Sam told him to recite odd numbers then even. Once he finished those his breathing had slowed down considerably. Sam held onto Dean until it reached normal then ushered him over to sit on the couch.
Some man with the confidence of an army general who’s just won a war stood very close to Dean’s chair. He wore all black with a bright yellow tie that matched his yellow contact lenses. His smile was predatory and everyone at the tablet, including Dean, scowled at his arrival.
“I miss you.” He moaned.
“Nah Cas I got stuff to do. Just wanted to hear your sexy voice.” Dean joked in an attempt to sway the path the conversation was bound to go down.
“Yeah I did and they were great together. I actually could hold a conversation with the man…I was amazed. Oh and Bobby is upset you’ve been dodging him all week.”
“I’m not jealous.” He didn’t mean to pout but, if he was perceived as jealous then that meant he thought they were something that they weren’t.
“So Castiel, Dean tells me you’re in one of his classes.”
“I like to take control sometimes.” He smiled slyly.
“I know I know, it’s just…well now you can see why I’m so hesitant to believe anything any one says.”
“Hey Dean?”
Dean kept going until he felt the tell tale heat in his groin. His rhythm was stuttering but still at the same speed he kept up all this time. Castiel wasn’t the only one lost in the sensations that tied them together.
“Either way you did good.”
“Would Cas stay here so much if I didn’t? I got you Red.”
“Yes Dean.” He breathed, loved the feeling of being saturated in Dean’s gentle care.
“Hush Dean or you don’t get your surprise.” He stepped closer into the man’s space until they were attached from chest to hip, one of Castiel’s legs in between Dean’s parted ones.
*                             *                             *                             *
“Shut up Cas, let me be a gentleman.”
“See that’s where you’re wrong. There won’t be a next time.”
“Ready for my close up fellas.” Dean emerged from the bathroom naked as a native of Eden.
“Henry I think you need to leave. I’ve already said no and I don’t think there’s anything else to discuss.”
“Well first of all it’s being guarded by a small, but very old coven, secondly you won’t like this coven.”
He took his hand off the toy and waited until Castiel took it in his hand to begin swiveling his hips again. While the slow grind he had before was nice, Cas wanted to speed things up a bit. He wanted Dean incoherent, beside himself with pleasure. Holding the base of the toy tightly he sped up and waited for Dean’s hips to catch up before he went even faster. Dean’s voice got progressively louder as he increased the aggressiveness of his thrusting.
Armed with a strong cup of black coffee Dean set out to get all of his work done. He was babysitting tonight and he wanted everything done before little Mark was due to be over. He was determined to grade the daunting stack of essays that littered his desk. He really wanted to complete this task, but then blue eyes flooded his vision every time he really got into it. He sighed and stretched his arms above his head and moved his hips in the office chair trying to get more comfortable.
“I’m glad you were my first at something.” He tucked his face into the curve of Dean’s neck, where he liked to be the most. “Although I’m upset that I came first.”
Castiel checked his phone and sure enough Dean had texted him. He looked out the large windows at the front of the café so see the impala with his boyfriend leaning back with a book in his hand.
Most of the students immediately left the room, giving Dean thanks and wishing him a happy thanksgiving. One student did drag along a bit, Castiel knew him as Kevin. He’d never talked to the individual except for the few times they were paired up in his Biology class. He was nice enough, a little strange but Castiel didn’t dislike him.
“That’s your best shot? Dad wants to help? When the hell has he ever wanted to simply help? When has he ever given a damn drop in a bucket about what’s going on in my life?” Dean stopped his pacing and turned his icy glare on his brother. “You heard him last night. He ‘doesn’t approve of how I live my life’. Why would he suddenly give a damn what happens to my
“I’m not your brother-in-law.” He rolled his eyes in reply.
“Which reminds me I should probably take mine.” Dean reluctantly withdrew himself from Cas remembering the only thing masking his horrid morning breathe was a cup of coffee and a plate of food.
John was the first to notice Dean standing in the open doorway and smiled shyly when their eyes met. He had to admit that his dad physically looked like he was getting better. He looked more like the Dad he knew before his mom died, granted his hair was a little more gray in some areas, but his skin held that healthy glow it use to. Maybe he was really trying to turn things around. Dean had no plans on forgiving him anytime soon, if ever, but the effort was noticed even thought he’d never admit it aloud.
“What do I do if he wakes up?” he turned his head to look at the sleeping bundle in the crib.
Dean: yeah gimme 20
“Um Hello?” he spoke into the receiver.
“Yeah I know.”
*                             *                             *                             *
“Cas you mind grabbing him some water?” Sam asked with a half smile.
He thought.
“This isn’t your first class. I’m sure you’ve found students attractive before. Just let it go and move on.”
He looked up to find Dean much closer than he was before. Those green eyes and that stunning aura enveloping and effectively trapping him in its existence. Overtaken by their proximity, both men met in the middle in a clash of lips and teeth. As harsh as the mutual attack was, the pleasure of it was very much there. Phone forgotten it fell out of his hands and in between the couch cushions. Strong hands wrapped around his side and back, pulling him into Dean’s warm lap. He went willingly, bracing himself on strong shoulders, their chests pressed up against one another.
“Yeah go ahead and toot your horn. Where is it and when can we get it?”
“Focus dammit.” He hissed aloud at the intrusive thoughts that surrounded the thoughts of his angel. His angel, he thought and smiled to his self.
“Castiel wow you’re back from the dead?” Charlie shouted as she entered his house. She embraced her friend and hugged him tight to her own lithe frame. “I’ve missed you.”
He felt a leg run in between his own. Rubbing his calves, on the inside of his thigh. It didn’t even occur to him how close their legs were under the table. Since they were about the same height and the booth was rather small, with a small scoot forward the other man was able to get his knee right up against Castiel's crotch.
Castiel was right there. Right fucking there, just one more thing and he was done for.
“You did good angel.” He whispered. “Thank you.”
“Hey Cas. How was class?”
Dean then rushed out of the office and fled down the hall. Cas was crumbling on the inside. He just asked Dean the top question he promised himself not to ask. Charlie was a terrible influence on him. Giving him that friendly courage to go after everything he wanted. Supporting all his terrible decisions. But Dean was single . He didn’t have anyone.
“And I don’t care if you like Dean or not, but you will not disrespect him or our relationship.”
“Sure thing. I can do that.”
So on a sunny Saturday morning he used the small iron and board provided with his room, he made himself look as nicest as he could before going on his way. The Light Path was the name of the store, tucked beside a hardware store. From the outside it looked much smaller than it was, but when he pushed over the glass door he was delighted to find it more spacious. Rows and rows of shelving lined the front of the shop, with a wide aisle down the middle that led to the register counter. The walls were solid black and the floors were purple with different runes and symbols painted in white and gold. He recognized a few of them as he walked towards the counter, hoping to find the owner. Behind the counter were three doors, one with a sign that said employees only, another said reading room, and the third off to the side was a restroom. He scented lavender in the air and the energy of the shop brought him such a rush of calm and safety that he hadn’t felt since he’d left his parent’s home that night of the rain.
They pulled back finally, because breathing was necessary. Dean smiled, happy that his feelings were reciprocated and that he knew something new about himself. Johnathan, however, looked ready to tear Dean’s clothes off and ravage him whole.
The realization hit him far harder than Castiel did as he crashed into Dean’s chest, not knowing how to stop himself. He was babbling on in happiness, but Dean couldn’t hear a word. He had to snap out of it fast, if the other man noticed, he would surely crumble.
*                             *                             *                             *
“I didn’t mean too actually. But I guess I got carried away.” He spoke reaching in his back seat to take out yet another bag.
That was the danger of letting himself say yes to dinner.
“Yeah I can stay here.” Dean smiled.
“Can I use your laptop?” Cas smiled at the term of affection.
Mark clapped and smiled as Cas walked closer as if he knew the guy. Cas smiled widely at the child and turned his attention back to Dean.
“I believe you’ve been dismissed. To avoid further embarrassment, you should leave now.” He grunted.
“Is Balthazar even sick?!”
Charlie was studying computer science. Castiel completely disagreed with her choice and thought she should switch to politics instead. The way that woman smoothly convinced him to attend the ridiculous party without breaking a sweat was a work of wonders. Against his better judgement he found himself agreeing. She had some good points and agreed to stay with him the entire time. She’d even installed some fancy GPS system on his phone so that even if they were separated by the wild, flailing bodies of drunken college students, they’d be able to find each other easily. It put a part of his frantic mind at ease, but he was still very wary about going. She also brought up the point that the possibility of Dick being there shouldn’t stop him from having fun. Balthazar even agreed to being his body guard. That must’ve been quite a feat convincing him to do that. He was the king of partying if there ever was one. But with all of this he actually really wanted Dean to be there. Thank goodness the theme of the party was a masquerade, whatever attire you wanted, but you had to wear a mask or you wouldn’t be admitted. All Castiel had to do was muster up his own political argument to convince Dean to go. That would be the biggest feat of them all.
Dean was anxious to say the very least. He tapped on the steering wheel impatiently at every red light that they had to stop at. Sam kept shooting him side glances as if he could read Dean’s mind and know that he wanted to just fly through all the stop lights. His dad and Chuck were in the backseat, which in itself was driving him to the edge. From what Cas had told him his Dad was very accepting of his sexuality once he’d understood it. He was the complete opposite of his dad, and to have them occupying the same small space was slowly undoing Dean’s sanity. He shot Sam a worried glance hoping his brother could read the feelings on his face. When he nodded in return he knew that he’d gotten the message.
“A nuisance is what it was.” He grabbed a couple beer bottles tossing one his brothers way before he decided on what to eat.
“She didn’t turn on you Dean.”
Dean: Of course I like coffee. Send me the when and where and it’s a date
Dean hummed in response and Cas continued to lead him to his bedroom. Cas’ bedroom. He barely knew the dude a month and he was already getting to his bedroom. Cas opened the large black wooden door to reveal a room much like Dean’s but 3 times the size. He had a king size bed with black blankets and a million pillows of varying sizes and textures. He had two dressers. One with a tv on top, and his desk rested in the far corner of the room. Cas went to the opposite of the bed farthest away from the door and began to undress. Dean followed suite and he watched Cas…closely. His dick reminded him of its presence and he internally yelled at it to calm the hell down.
“I’m not asking you to talk about it. I’m asking you to stop pushing me away.”
“Wow Cassie’s got himself a boyfriend.” Castiel whipped around to see Dick leaning on the side of the restaurant with a tall dark haired man leaning up against him.
“That in itself is a lie Gabriel.” Balthazar added.
You: That’s fine with me. And yes
“No, it’s gotta happen at least twice more for it to be a habit. Right now it’s a coincidence.”
He thought to himself.
“Well looks like I get to cash in a favor.” He smiled.
“We are not friends. Not even close!” he turned to stomp away. “Dick let me go!” he tore his arm away from the hand that grabbed him.
Is that what they were now?
“I was just out of my element.”
“Hello Dean. May I come in?”
The next half hour proved to be quite difficult. He offered Dean some sweatpants and a t-shirt to sleep in. He quite enjoyed the fact that the man would be sleeping his clothes. It was like the two of them were caught up in their own version of auto-pilot, winding and turning around each other as they got ready for bed. For being the one to suggest this in the first place, Castiel was a wreck while Dean looked like this was any other night.
“I give you the credit you deserve. This isn’t a perfect world but you sure do grace it with your imperfectly perfect presence.”
It wasn’t though. It was pretty far from ok. But with Dean by his side Castiel believed that it one day would be ok. Dean finally let him go and took the mug from his hand and set it on the table. He dove back in for another hug, this time Castiel had time to properly wrap his arms around him. He melted into this hug. He wanted it more than the air he breathed. He never truly needed physical contact. But in this moment with Dean he truly wanted nothing else. He let the strong arms embrace him and ground him in the present. That was then and this was now. Castiel felt like he deserved this present.
He lined himself up, with Castiel’s dick in hand and slowly began sinking down. His expression was twisted in pleasure, his eyes screwed shut, and his mouth hanging open on a silent scream. Once he sunk all the way down Castiel was sure he could die happily in this moment. The tight heat of it all was overwhelming. Dean leaned back, a hand on each of Castiel’s shins before he started rising slowly only to sink back down quickly. A gasp was punched out of Castiel. He didn’t think being inside of another person could feel so good. After that initial thrust Dean kept up a slow and quick pattern as Castiel just laid down enjoying the ride.
“You ready to go Cas?” he growled, eyes still trained on Balthazar.
“Well I actually wanted your opinion and—advice on this. See I’ve never moved anywhere—permanently, so I’m not sure what I should have.”
“Nothing to be sorry for angel.”
“Sorry Dean.” He grumbled.
“Now you’re talking.” He smiled, getting up from his seat to go get him a piece.
He hesitated for a few moments before answering. “Not to be rude Sam, but why haven’t you asked Dean this?”
“I’m good Cas how are you?”
Castiel didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to think. All he knew in that moment was that Dean was probably going to kill Dick Roman and he had no clue how to stop him. He could feel himself shaking as he watched Dick take each blow worse than the last. His arms were up as he tried to shield his face, but that was utterly pointless. Dean put every fiber of his being into each punch and his one intention was to land them all. He could feel Dean’s anger from where he stood across the room, plastered against Kevin’s side. It was horrible to see his man in such a state of rage. He never wanted to see Dean like this ever again.
“Ah yes. A tradition we hold dear. I just got out the shower. I’ll be ready in 10.”
From the little he’d learned about the other man’s love life he wasn’t just giving out private shows like the ones he’d received. Certainly not for free, in the privacy of that person’s home. That was well within his right of course. He didn’t know what he was to the other man, but that didn’t much matter. They were something. He still felt special to receive such treatment.
“Drunk already?” she laughed.
“Those pants have to go Dean.”
Sam took Dean to Bobby’s because that was the best thing to do for his brother. He knew how much the both of them valued the little family they had left and thought it best for Dean to be surrounded by the people who love him the most. Plus with him taking half of Bobby’s weapon collection he thought he deserved to be filled in on the situation. Sam knew Dean had half a liquor store in his house and the last thing he wanted to do was leave him alone with it. Dean would not turn out like their father if he had some say in it.
“I take it that’s not a good thing.” He wrapped an arm around Dean and pulled him to his chest.
Cas froze. He didn’t know what to say to that. What did Dean mean by that? Too bad for him? Did he want a chance with him?
“Dean I hope you don’t mind, but my brother will be joining us at the Halloween party.”
“I don’t give a damn what time it is! We talkin about it now.” He stomped off the landing at the bottom of the stairs and walked up to Bobby. “You kept my boys from me! That’s probably how Dean turned out to be a damn fag!”
Took a few seconds for his brain to upload the fact that he was supposed to greet this other worldly creature.
“How about you and I get undressed so we can enjoy your unexpected purchase?” he walked out of Dean’s hold and tore his shirt over his head.
“Well Christmas eve dinner yes. I figured you’d be spending Christmas day with Dean’s family so I wanted to have a small something for the night before. Maybe open a gift or two together?”
“The biscuits are made from scratch.” Dean spoke clearly proud of himself.
“Listen today is just about fun. Tell me a story or something.”
The man stood up, slowly turning to Dean as the man was licking his lips.
“My eyes are up here angel.”
“Oh the things I wanna do to you angel.”
“I don’t want to inconvenience you.” The boy shifted on his feet clearly a bit uncomfortable with the offer.
“I’m doing well. How are you Sam?”
“Hey Cas. I see Mark has a new friend.” Sam made eyes at his brother.
Dean,
“You can do that if you want. I’m hungry so I’m gonna eat.”
“Yes! You can change the words however you like, but that should be the general message.” He rolled his eyes. “I know that’s not an easy thing to admit for you, but the least you can do is try. Because right now I’m the only one who’s trying.”
“Look who’s sappy now.” Cas laughed as he slid off of Dean’s lap.
Leave it to her to sniff out an issue before he’d even said anything.
“You never know until you tried.”
“Now do you have a bank account sweetie? Cause I don’t shell out cash, you’ll be getting an old fashioned check.”
“Good thing I’m starving babe.” He laughed. “You in a rush?”
“You like watching me don’t you? I want words Cas.”
They walked inside the old fashioned place and Dean took Cas’ hand leading them over to a perky hostess. She sat them down and gave them their menus and brought out water and breadsticks while they thought of what entrees they wanted.
“No Dean, it’s better that you didn’t. If it had escalated and the cops involved. The last thing I want is for you to go to jail on my behalf.”
Good grief that fucking line tore more holes in Dean than he could count. Since his childhood he’d heard that same line more than anything else his father had ever said to him. It got so bad that it made a terrible wedge in him and his brother’s relationship for several years. That line alone caused Dean to be on the worst weekend bender of his life. And it was said right after his father had found out about Dean’s bisexuality.
“Your welcome.”
The scene that laid out before him was not one that he expected. Castiel stood over Dick squirming on the ground with a look on his face that could smite an army of men. His lip was cut but other than that he looked relatively fine. Balthazar was crouched on the floor with a hand over his left eye and breathing heavily, the two other guys that no doubt belonged to Dick’s crew were knocked out cold on the floor. It was 3 against two and pretty obvious they had won. Dean stepped over Dick’s trembling body to embrace his fuming boyfriend.
“Yeah everything is cool. Cas needs me.”
He apologized in a very Dean like fashion for his family’s behavior. Attacking the man with an extra special hand job seemed like the best way to do so. Laying him out on his bed, he was as tender as he could be bringing him to the height of pleasure to fix the disaster the day turned out to be. Cas was, of course, none the wiser and just took whatever he was willing to give and returned it right back to him.
“Some one’s happy to see me.”
“Is it ready?” Dean purred in his ear.
Then he opened his mouth.
“Ok then Dean. You’re eyes remind me of a warm Autumn day. You smell like sandalwood and sunshine.” He inched his face towards Dean.
“Dude your hair is still wet.” Sam said bursting in through the door.
“Hey little brother.”
“So I haven’t seen you in forever. Would you like to explain that?” Charlie took a sip of her coffee while scowling at Castiel.
Dean parked in the faculty lot and hesitantly got out of his car finally. He wracked his brain thinking of things he could possibly do with Cas while he babysat. Would he mind hanging out with Dean and the baby? Dean went into auto-pilot once inside his classroom. He taught as efficiently as he normally did with thoughts of Castiel lingering in the back of his mind. His eyes kept flickering to the clock on the wall praying that time would move faster and he could get to his phone to see if Cas texted him.
Now he was utterly confused, but he didn’t have enough time to get upset because Dean walked into the room with that blinding smile of his.
“That’s where you’re wrong. Then what happened?”
“Yes. I’m meeting up with someone.”
Once he was alone, he made a point to order additional minutes on the phone, and wouldn’t even admit to himself he’d done it all for Dean.
Cas lowered his head and stared at the beginnings of Dean’s erection. He brought a hand down and cupped it tightening his fingers around it.
“Come on Dean you and Castiel obviously got something going. We’re just trying to push it along.”
His heart broke once again that he’d have to spill the news to her and ruin her usual carefree mood. Placing a supportive arm around her shoulders he ushered her inside to do the inevitable.
“Dean let me wash my hands.” He did his belt back together as the other man began kissing his neck.
Dean wanted to hangout with Cas again. He really did but he had no idea how to go about it without letting his lewd side get the best of him. He and Cas had just began to form a friendship and he didn’t want to taint that it by thinking with the wrong head. He only sees the guy twice a week but they text constantly. Monday and Wednesday have become his favorite days of the week. Each of those mornings at 10 am he gets to see him for the hour and a half that the class is in session. Castiel sits front row center every time, his eyes following every one of Dean’s movements. It’s distracting but he also finds himself loving the staring. He even made a habit of licking his lips more often so he could enjoy the way Cas’ eyes got wider every time he did it.
“Hmm. I guess I could try that. I’ll just give him a bottle for now.”
He said dinner. Now it really sounded like a date to Dean. Cas retreated the car and rushed into the house like he had the last time. Dean drove off once he knew the guy was safely inside. Once he was home he undressed wearing just a t-shirt and boxers he crawled into bed with thoughts of Castiel on his mind. He looked at his phone to save the number and saw that Cas had texted himself a winky face.
“Yeah I had fun to Cas’. More fun than I’ve had in a while.” He admitted.
“Oh wow, keeping it all in the family.” He chuckled. “This is my first shoot with Dean. Kind of surreal ya know?”
He walked into her bookstore, somewhere he was more than familiar with since he helped with a lot of the renovations and interior design of the place. At first Charlie had hired a contractor, Dean had a lot going on at the time, so he wasn’t offended that she didn’t ask him. The dude was a scam artist at its finest, tried to upcharge her on everything under the sun, made fake estimates for products he wasn’t actually getting. He was bad news from the beginning. So, they got rid of him and with the help from his uncle, dad, and brother they got the rest of the job done. All in all, Moondoor was one of his favorite places on earth.
Castiel loved how protective his friend was over him. She had been with him through the after math of the whole ordeal.  He was grateful for her kindness and every chance he got he had let her know that. For a while after that night Charlie was the only person he had felt comfortable being himself around. That was of course until Dean fell from the sky and swept him away in an ocean of green.
The work was hard, and the weather was hot, but Castiel enjoyed himself, nonetheless. When he had the right amount of service, he spent it texting Dean and sending him picture after picture of the things he viewed around him. Hannah, the guide assigned to help him, shook her head in amusement every time he’d asked her to take a picture of him with something or someone to send to his boyfriend. Dean hadn’t sent any pictures in return, but he replied to everyone sent to him. Castiel thought he was being a lot, but the other man had assured him that he appreciated every last one of them. In addition he made several remarks of them needing to travel together so that they could take photos like that together.
John was just about to pounce on Dean, the look of a man with nothing to lose in his eyes. Pure rage and fire radiated from the man and for the first time in Dean’s life, that too familiar look didn’t scare him anymore. Bobby was quick to catch John, using all the strength in him to hold him back, but Dean didn’t budge, he didn’t need to. John couldn’t hurt Dean at this point anymore. He was old and drunk, where Dean was young and sober. All he had left were his hate filled words, and empty threats. And if that’s all he had then Dean would no longer show it affecting him.
“Can he cook? Cause you know the two of us would just be the blind leading the blind in here.”
“Alright everyone you know the deal. Let’s go around the table and say something we’re thankful for. And keep it clean and happy folks.” She shot John a glare that would turn a lesser man into a crying mess. “I’ll start with I’m thankful for all the ones gathered here today. You’re my family, even the new additions,” she smiled at Castiel, “And I’m glad you could all make it here in one piece.”
“I’ve already finished my shopping. Everything was shipped to my house a couple weeks ago.”
88888888 88888888888 888888888888
The deal, he couldn’t give two shits about that. His father was just as stubborn as he was and that wasn’t going to happen. But where Dean was concerned, well Dick had crossed the line as usual. Dean gave him everything he could ever want in a relationship, even things he wouldn’t even know to ask for. The man was selfless with his friends and his family, adding Castiel to the list. They grew so in tune with each other so quick, and things were great between them. Sure Dean has his bad days, but everyone does including himself. Even when they’re at their lowest they know that they’ll always come back together eventually.
“Well that worked out great for you huh?”
They let the water off and Dean made it a point to towel dry Castiel from head to toe. He gave him clothes to wear to bed, but Castiel opted just for clean underwear, so Dean wore the same. With covers on them, they settled into each other’s arms. He basked in the way Dean ran warmer than himself, despite the A/C running.
He reached down and picked up the squirming bundle, holding him like he was a giant priceless gem, which in retrospect he was. Mark wrapped his little arms around Castiel’s neck and placed his head on his chest giving him a hug.
“Yeah I am. It’s going well.”
“It’s a compliment man.”
“Well then tell everyone I appreciate it.”
Pulling out the chair across from him, he only took his seat when Dean was settled. For someone that had such a huge detest for vegetables he never opposed anything that Castiel made for him. He dug into the salad with the same veracity that he ate his meat.
Castiel threw his phone down on the couch and jumped in front of Dean. Sure John was a large, solid man, but he couldn’t fight both of them. He spent the new few minutes trying to keep him behind him and calm him down. John was now pacing back and forth in his living room huffing about how Dean was such a disappointment. This threw Dean into a different kind of emotion, one that Cas had hoped he would never see on the man’s face. Heartache. He swore he could hear Dean’s heart crumbling under the hand that was placed firmly on his chest. He didn’t have to hold Dean back anymore because had stopped moving.
He felt the chair being turned around and as he was now face to face with the last person on earth he wanted to see, so he averted his gaze elsewhere. Two of Roman’s goons were in the room, sitting at a ratty looking table playing cards. He felt like he was in a cliché kidnapping scene in some low budget action film. All he wanted was to escape this place and get back to Dean.
The man smiled and waved before exiting the store with a smile on his face.
He gave his thanks with that blinding smile and bright swirling colors in his aura.
He asked himself.
“Heya Cas.” He greets him before anyone else with that disorienting smile of his.
“You’re lucky you’re so damn cute.” He smirked. “Got me doing manual labor on my day off.”
Castiel looked up at this and was honestly shocked. He searched Dean’s eyes for any thread of deceit and when he found none that made his mood rise just a little. To think that Dean would take him as he is whether or not he knew the truth was baffling. How could he have so much trust in him?
“My Aunt Ellen would love you.” He laughed. “Of course you can meet my family. Speaking of which we’re having a big Thanksgiving dinner and I want you to come.” Dean beamed.
“You’re right. I’m impatient. I’m sorry.”
“Let’s keep it that way. So tell me the part where it got hot and heavy.”
It was a picture of someone tied to a chair with their head hanging between their shoulders. He pulled the phone closer, and upon inspection he could see that it was not only Cas, but that he had spots on his lap that were clearly blood. Under the picture the there were several texts.
“Let me accompany you.”
John pushed past Bobby and came walking into the living room only to met by several pairs of wondering eyes. He looked….better than he had the last time he’d seen him. His hair was groomed and his clothes were clean, they couldn’t smell a distillery with every move he made. His skin even looked better, full of that tan color that he use to have. He’d been supposedly in rehab since thanksgiving and that would be the longest time he’s ever stayed. But 3 months aint enough time for someone to turn around such a life as the one John Winchester led.
He’d look at any further responses when he was done. For now, it was time to dive into it. Clicking the play button he was rattling with energy. It began with the image of the thumbnail, Dean just spreading and squeezing his cheeks, letting them go and doing it all over again. Castiel was ramrod straight at this point but it was only a 10 minute video so he wanted to draw this out. It wasn’t time yet to touch himself. With a dry finger Dean poked and prodded at the hole, with his headphones on he could pick up all the background noise including Dean’s heavy breathing. It appeared that he was in the bathroom from the lighting and the countertop in front of him. No wonder it looked so good.
“Dean, I borrowed some stuff from Bobby. It’s in my trunk.”
“Are you saying you wanna take a road trip with me Cas?” Dean choked on his sip of water. “If so then that’s by far the sexiest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“So how do you know Gabriel? Doesn’t he usually use another camera guy?”
“Can I be honest with you Dean?”
“Don’t let her hear you say that. She’ll rip you a new one.”
“Very interesting.”
“You baking a pie in my apartment….naked.” he whispered.
“I’ll drive you and your car home. Dean you can take Cas right? Just pick me up from Charlie’s house.” Sam shot him a knowing look.
“After that whole fiasco Father eventually found out and he immediately had me transferred. Charlie transferred too. He also severed many of the ties we had with their family. Their business suffered tremendously.”
“I called you a lot Dean. You didn’t answer either of us so I decided to come over.”
Cas’ eyebrows knitted together in the center of his forehead at this. He sat up fully keeping his dissecting gaze on Dean. Dean mouthed that he was talking to Sam and Cas smiled slightly.
“I’m going to die.” He wheezed from his sprinting.
“I’m going home.” Turning his head away, looking up at the starry sky.
“You like my unruly hair? Uncle Dean does too. He does that every time I try to tame it.”
As Dean redressed him in sleep clothes of his own, a well-worn t-shirt that’s seen so much love, and a pair of sweatpants that were slightly longer than he would have worn. Even though they both knew Castiel had brought sleep clothes of his own they were forgotten for the act of sharing ones garments. He then ushered him into bed, pulling up the covers over him before he crawled into bed himself and wrapped around the other. It was only when they were settled, tangled up in one another that he realized what the feeling was.
“Well if you weren’t with your green eyed lover then I’d probably rebuttal that point. And that’s the perfect Segway for you to tell me everything that happened.” She plopped down on the couch.
The most beautiful hue of pink rose up on the man’s cheeks, his full lips formed a tight line in embarrassment. “Shut your damned mouth Joanna Beth.”
Dean tore at his jeans trying to get them down, then he spun Castiel around to get a look for himself. Sure enough tucked in perfectly was a shiny silver butt plug.
“Dad what are you doing?”
*                             *                             *                             *
“Yeah? How is he?”
There wasn’t much more to take because soon enough he was pumping into the beautiful man above him. He hugged Dean close and as they began, so they finished, with lips intertwined. The only difference now was that they were sweaty and sated. While Castiel heavily enjoyed their rigorous sex, there was a special place in his heart for the tangled afterglow that they were now basking in.
“What’s up Deano?” Gabe hopped up on one of the barstools and sat his chin in his hands. “Having fun cooking with good old Dad?”
“Hello father.” He answered tensely.
When they arrived at his house he placed a kiss to Dean’s forehead and left the car with a whispered goodbye.
“The hell is wrong with your phone? You don’t know how to call anymore?”
Cas: Are you busy
That was fine and dandy if those were the rules, he was quite confident with his hands, and he had an idea of what Dean liked based on the way he did it to himself the last time. He didn’t take too long with the circling, just went ahead and plunged a finger inside. He was off to a good start if the man’s sharp intake of breathe was anything to go off of. He watched as the man moaned around a bite of the pie, waiting until he finished to put another finger in.
“In public?”
“Dean told me you recently finished law school.”
“Eww Dean.” He chuckled. He was grateful to have Dean to rely on, always turning something bad into a laughable situation. Castiel only hoped he could one day return the favor. “I don’t want to imagine that.”
After plating up there food they sat in mainly silence watching a documentary on the Animal Planet and chewing their food. Castiel happily ate and texted Dean trying to offer comfort for the man’s boredom. In mid conversation he received a phone call from an unknown number. Reluctantly he answered and was stunned at how much noise was happening on the other end.
Always to follow the man’s command he brought his hand down in quick succession 3 times, then waited for further instructions. Dean simply moaned louder and rocked harder. Taking that for what it was he started in on the other cheek with another triple.
“You can’t just run off like that love. You had us all worried.” He placed a reassuring hand on the middle of his back and rubbed tender circles on the area. His breathing, which he hadn’t realized had quickened, slowed down to its normal patterns with the help of Balthazar.
Kissing Dean was always amazing, and not always a means to an end. In this case it certainly was now. Seating on the bed next to each other they embraced one another and got lost in the scent and feel of each other’s mouths. Castiel was so into it that he whined when Dean pulled away only to return with one last peck before he was gently leaned backwards on the bed. One leg was lifted, and Dean was sliding his boxers off of him. Once they were gone, he immediately dove down and took Castiel’s half hard dick into his warm mouth. He gasped and moaned as Dean got so far, the tip of his nose met his pelvis. Just holding him, not sucking, or moving and the anticipation was killing him.
“That’s a weird way to form a friendship. I like it. What made you turn him down?”
********
“Dean I was—actually wondering if you um wanted to stay the night?” he could feel the heat on his face and sweat in his clenched hands.
“It’s a fruit blend. I think you’ll enjoy it.”
Mary sighed at this and he could tell she was refraining an eye roll. “Talk to Missouri about it before you make a decision on that.”
“So, you need to know that if you hurt him, I’m capable of many things.” She raised an eyebrow that didn’t quite match the smirk on her face.
“Hello.” Dean’s gravel post-drinking voice sounded terrible. He hadn’t even bothered to check the caller I.D to see who was calling. What was the point of caring anymore? Cas hadn’t shown up last night, he didn’t even bother to shoot Dean a quick text letting him know he wasn’t coming. He was stood up in the worse way, by someone he never thought would leave him.
Without another word Dean rose and motioned for Castiel to do the same. Slowly he peeled his shirt off of him, pausing to kiss his cheek before moving to his jeans. Placing his hands on his shoulders he pushed at them gently, for him to sit back down. He untied his shoes, putting them to the side and slid his jeans off where they were pooled at his ankles. He pulled back the sheets, and watched as his boyfriend climbed under them, eyes trained on Dean as he removed his own clothing. He climbed in bed on the other side with Cas’ back towards him. He pulled him with a gentle arm over his chest until their warm skin merged. In the dark they laid silently, their breathing synced as they tried their hardest to fall asleep. Dean waited until he thought Castiel was asleep, kissing the back of his neck and whispering a gentle ‘I love you’ into his ear.
“I believe so. He is also a mechanic.”
Dean lightly pushed Castiel until he was standing next to him. He loved how protective the younger man was of him, but he was sick of being shielded. His father’s hatred had no foundation, no real reason for it in the first place, and he was fully intent on crumbling it to pieces and blowing it out of his life.
“This table is full.” Dean growled.
3:00am Dean jacked off in tears before blacking out
“He was worried?”
“Yes I’m fine. How are you Dean?”
“Yes….Dean…Ahhhhh.”
They did work in silence for a couple hours before heading out. It felt almost routine to do this. They went to the car and Dean drove him home.  He was so mentally tired from todays whirlwind of emotions. He needed his 4 hours of sleep.
Something about alcohol made Cas’ voice sound much more deeper and alluring than it normally was. He needed to stop talking now before Dean broke his promise to Gabriel.
“Yes, it’ll be 3 months on Friday.” He nodded sipping what Dean would call his ‘liquid sugar’ coffee. “He wants to go out to dinner after my shift.”
“I know he gets really low sometimes, and it’s rough to handle, trust me I’ve been there. But Dean’s a good guy and if you really care about him then you’ve gotta be ready to roll with the punches.”
“Can I touch you Cas?” he said through another moan.
“It’s very nice to meet to meet you. And thank you so much for all of this.”
“So do you think it’s too soon?” Sam asked cautiously.
He pulled himself from his boxers as Dean inserted another finger. The pressure was getting to him and he needed to relieve it. Pouring his own glob of lube, he began stroking up and down, rolling his sack in his other hand. He kept the pace slow as the man on the screen began to vocalize his enjoyment. He let go of his sack, getting those fingers on his chest, rolling his nipples between his fingers alternately. Dean was up to three fingers now, and you could see the slight tremor in his upper thighs. That was all well and good, but what did Castiel in was the moaning, the groans and heavy breaths was what was doing him in. He joined in on Dean’s song with noises of his own.
“Um—an adult store.”
Dean was sending out all the signals that he needed to be alone right now. He shied away from all his tender touches and even Sam’s supportive hand on shoulder seemed to be too much for him right now. His coldness was very much understood after what just transpired, but it hurt nonetheless. He watched as Dean and his defeated shoulders and dead eyes walked away from them both.
“Yeah but—“
“Of course it does sweetheart. Burgers and pie are my specialty.” He winked. “The pie isn’t the main course here though.”
It took Dean two hours to get back to his apartment. He stopped at the liquor store on his way and had many plans for the 4 bottles that clinked against each other. Once he got in and settled he sat on the couch with a glass full of whiskey. He pulled out his phone with a long sigh and proceeded to send emails to his students that class would be cancelled for Monday. There was no way he’d get as plastered as he intended and be able to get up the next morning. He rarely ever cancelled class, if ever so he had a nice pile of sick days to use. But he just needed this one. Just one day to himself and he could muster through this and get back to his life. Just one night to throw caution into a fire and wallow in his self.
Castiel: Dean is here J
“Dammit Charlie! I’m coming whether you like it or not.”
“Noo.” The man groaned and turned his back to him.
“All fine and dandy darling. Wouldn’t want to make your beau jealous.” He reached into his pocket for a business card and handing it over. “The second number is my personal cell. Just text me time if you’re able to make it.”
He got a mix between a growl and grunt in response as the man stirred.
He heard a laugh that formed into a cough at the end of the table, clearly coming from John. Castiel had to reel in some self-control not to glare at the man, he felt Dean’s grip on his knee tighten and sat a hand of his own on top. It seemed no matter what he would say, no matter how basic and platonic the words were that they wouldn’t be accepted by John. He could’ve said he was thankful that it didn’t rain today and it still wouldn’t be received well. And that was no fault of his or Dean’s.
Dean: You better study hard. This exam won’t be easy.
*                             *                             *                             *
“Good grief Cas.” He erupted in laughter. “It’s also an insult. I wasn’t actually requesting you to do this, but hell am I glad you did.”
Dean jerked out of his sleep at Charlie yelling. He swiped a hand over his face wiping off the drool that had accumulated on chin. He blinked several times trying to figure out what Charlie could’ve possibly found, then the knowledge of the situation he was in all came flooding back. She was smiling so this was a good thing, maybe the solution he needed.
“That’s great Sammy.” He came back into the living room sporting the most genuine smile he could muster at the moment.
“Do you know if Dean has a gun? I hope he has a way to protect himself. You saw right? They all have guns.”  He plopped himself on the small twin bed next to Castiel as he finished his meal.
Dean turned and handed the bundle back to his father and left his boyfriend and brother to help Ellen set out all the dishes.
“Go for it.”
“You—are you sure?” Castiel was taken by surprise. He shifts their intertwined position a little so that their eyes meet. “You don’t have too if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“I’m talking to you!” he raised his voice.
“It’s kind of late for that now.” Dean’s voiced raised significantly in volume.
Luckily Cas’ phone was in his hand and he dialed Sam while they both were distracted. They were both far enough away from it that they couldn’t hear when Sam picked up. He just let the phone sit in his hand and let Sam hear what was happening. He was smart. He knew he would understand what was happening here.
“I see.” Cas sighed. “Are you single Dean?”
“At first he tried to ask me on a date, but I turned him down as I am with you.”
“Pleasure.” V-neck man smirked at Dean. “So you’ve managed to snag our Castiel’s interests.”
“No you can’t. You aren’t even supposed to be drinking.” Ellen chimes in.
After, they steered the conversation to more ‘icebreakers’, Balthazar talking about his strange family and Castiel evading each question about his own. He did, however, tell a story about Gabriel, the colony prankster and his brother. To this day no one knows how he managed to make itching powder and spread it throughout everyone’s homes with no one noticing. Enjoying the company of a man so brash and brutally open was a new feeling for him. As much as he’d deny it to the man’s face Balthazar was quite funny.
“I guess we should go then.” Cas spoke his hands rubbing together and he was vibrating from being cold.
“For what? The class hasn’t really started yet.”
Dean clearly had other plans for this moment. All heat and passion behind each slide of their lips. It was sweet and warm at the same time. Castiel tried and failed to keep his composure. Against his will a breathy moan escaped his lips. Dean’s hands slid behind him and he was now gripping his ass pulling him forward, their crotches meeting together. This pulled a similar moan from Dean and Cas’ walls were tumbling down. He ground on top of Dean, his fully erect arousal searching for friction. This left Cas panting and wanting for more. He tried to push his brain to form words that he could communicate to his lover, but nothing seemed to flow right. Except for the broken whimpers that left his lips.
“No yeah I definitely get it now. And I respect you even more now.”
And without another word Sam was out the door and he was left alone. He assumed it would be best to return to the child’s room and make sure he isn’t alone should he wake up. That seemed logical enough. He stood close to the crib with his hands in his coat pockets swaying back and forth on his feet. Peering into the crib, he watched the toddler sleep. He looked so peaceful and serene. His little curls surrounded his face, making him look so much like his father, but his hair was blonde like Sam’s late wife. It saddened him to know the child was going to grow up without a mother, but it comforted him knowing that Sam was strong enough to fill both of those roles on his own.
He pulled out a notebook for another class and propped it on his lap immediately getting to work. He could feel Dean’s eyes watching him in silence. He started sweating again. Nervousness creeping through the veil of the comfortability he felt before.
“Um—I’m—I need a minute.” he stammered in a panic.
“I’m alright. How are you Sam?”
“Um…yes I’m fine. Sorry.” He fumbled and dropped his notebook.
He watched as she fidgeted with bobbleheads and not meeting his eyes as she talked.
“Hello Dean.”
“I can do that.”
“No.” he growled and dug his face further into the side of Dean’s neck.
“I didn’t know I had joined a game.”
“What’s a girl gotta do to get some more of that?” his hands were now tracing swirls and random patterns along Castiel’s spine.
“I’m sure you’re aware that what happened between me and my ex was…. far from being ok. I don’t want to share everything right now. There are just some things that I’m sure you’ll want to know before we make this…official.”
“I keep my promises Dean.”
Of course not 5 minutes after the man left, little Mark’s eyes fluttered open. He wiggled until he was on his back and looked up at Castiel with a curious look on his face. They stared at each other for a minute before Mark reached his tiny arms up beckoning to be picked up. Castiel immediately reacted and gingerly picked him up. A little frown formed on his face, and if it wasn’t a sign that crying was on the horizon he’d find it cute.
Cas froze watching Dean’s blissful demeanor change into something frigid and frozen. His father was here, all signs pointing south. He stood with his shoulders tensed ready to go into action any second. Sam had told him a bit of what transpired at their meeting. He didn’t give too many details since it wasn’t his place to do so, but Castiel learned a few things about his father today. He was homophobic, angry, and violent about it. Castiel had experienced some his self from his mother, but it was never aggressive, she just expressed her unneeded disappointment. Castiel’s father had been the complete opposite. He was very accepting and open to talking about it with his son. Castiel’s bravery and his father’s reaction even inspired Gabe to come out.
“He deserves it. It suites him. He’s a ruthless lawyer and uses it for all the wrong reasons. He represents the people you know for sure are guilty, but he always gets them off. It’s disgusting if you ask me.”
Dean’s pictures had given him the courage to send some of his own. He decided on taking them in the bathroom since the lighting was much better. He angled the camera to capture his face and neck, like Dean had done. After several attempts he scrolled back and forth between the photos to decide on one good enough to send back. He didn’t have a fancy smart phone like Dean, but he made due with what he had. With a deep breathe he sent it off, waiting impatiently for Dean’s reply.
“I’m fine Dean…just good.” He smiled a half goofy smile.
“I’m glad I could relieve your boredom.”
And he meant every word of it.
Ah, so he was being asked to leave.
“What’s there to think about? I thought you wanted to do this.”
Dean: most can’t make a coherent thought
“Yeah well I’m just happy father doesn’t want to deal with him. Can you imagine?”
They pulled up to Bobby’s house not long after. Dean was surprised himself at how quickly they got there and how deep in thought he must’ve been to make this drive entirely on auto pilot. They got out and grabbed the dishes Dean brought from home then proceeded to walk in. They were greeted immediately by Sam holding little Mark. His face lit up at the sight of his uncle and his little arms reached out for Dean. Cas smiled tenderly at the sight of the two of them together.
“If you don’t like them I can return them I have the receipt.” He rushed out. “It wasn’t exactly my idea—Bal—he—I thought they would look—I’m sorry Dean.”
He followed Dean’s instructions, the experience downright exploded as it got impossibly better. His hands grasped at Dean’s hips so he could match his rhythm to his. The noises that came out of Dean were flat out obscene, but they sounded like lustful music to Castiel’s ears. His body picked up the pace on its own in search of the inevitable release. Gripping Dean’s hips harder he pushed up into him with all his efforts, until Dean was basically bouncing on top of him.
*                             *                             *                             *
“Maybe. Let’s talk about something else for now.”
He’d rung the bell several times and no one answered, then he texted, then he called, and finally it dawned on him to try the knob. To his surprise (and high concern) the door was in fact open. Maybe the man just wanted him to let himself in. Dean’s house was beautiful and quaint on the outside and just as much if not more on the inside. Navy blue seemed to be a reoccurring color throughout. Maybe the color brought Dean comfort, made sense to decorate your house with things that created serenity. It was quiet, in the main room and living area. There was no one to be found in the kitchen either.
Graduation came and went and the summer after they were inseparable. Dick had taken him to his family’s vacation house down by the shore and gave Castiel his first kiss. It was magical, like out of a romance novel and Castiel was smitten at this point. But it was very one sided as he later found out. They began dating, but it was always a secret since Dick’s family hadn’t known that he was bisexual. They only kissed in private. Whenever they went anywhere in public they had to act like friends to keep prying eyes from being suspicious. At first Castiel understood and was ok with it, but after a while it weighed on him. He didn’t like that he couldn’t be himself regardless of who was around.
Didn’t take Dean long to turn his finished basement into a studio. Maybe he’d gotten a little too excited about the new endeavor he was going on with his boyfriend. He’d brought a whole new bed and sheets and blankets to go with it, he’d gotten a chaise too because imagining himself spread on that, with Cas so close to him, filming, had him hard as nails in seconds flat. He’d even got a bunch of new toys that he totally didn’t need but wanted anyway. Could probably even use a few on Cas.
“Well I was just about to make breakfast and shower and stuff.”
“How’d your date go sugar?” Missouri said instead of a greeting as he walked into the shop.
Sam made another pitiful attempt at getting a handful of mac and cheese, the sound of wood hitting skin brought Dean out of his trip down memory lane. He turned to see his brother rubbing his reddened hand and pouting face. He laughed out loud at Sammy’s demise.
