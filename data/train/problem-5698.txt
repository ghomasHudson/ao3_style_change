There were screens everywhere, literally everywhere, even in the bathroom. And just as many speakers, lights, phones, laptops, and all sorts of stuff Steve could only marvel at. E-sports were still a bit confusing for him, but sports and the excitement and electricity that came with it were all very familiar to him. So standing there, at the Stark E-sports Stadium, and with his husband and his son being so involved in this, Steve couldn’t help feeling just as giddy as everybody here.
Tony flounced in, late to the party, as always. He smacked a kiss on Juliana’s curly head and took a moment to compliment her demolishing her toy with her new itty bitty baby teeth, before moving over to smack Steve on the ass.
[Image 1: A selfie taken by Tony with Julia and Steve on the limo on their way to the hotel. Steve is kissing Julia’s cheek and Tony is beaming at the camera.]
Bucky nodded. “Hey, zvonochek, what do you want to play with today?” He brought the baby away.
(A lot of people thought Tony or Steve would be squeamish about it, but it was so much different when you had a child on the way, ya know?)
Darcy was suddenly standing on the couch, wide-eyed and arms waving madly. “I taught her something! Oh my god! I have imparted knowledge! I take it back!
Thor looked at him and if he had his hands free, he would probably be wagging a finger at Steve. “Ah, but as we are men, dear Steven, we would do well to listen to women on the matters of what young girls would want.”
Gail brought Juliana (their daughter!) higher up her chest and smiled at the camera. As if sensing such a momentous occasion, Juliana opened her eyes.
Steve handed Tony a cloth and turned back to Bucky. “Anyway, I still need to feed Tony and get him into the shower and a suit for his meeting.” He ignored Tony’s outraged noises. “You go play with your goddaughter. She has her milk, and her blanket and toys are in the living room. Go.” Steve shooed him off.
Satisfied that his daughter was secure, he glanced over at his husband. “Gigglenoodle?” he chuckled.
Tony made a kissy face at him. “Are you free from Sunday to Wednesday to spend a few days with the most adorable person in the world? And the cutest, most gorgeous baby in the world? And Steve?”
Fury give him time.
Then there was the taufr, a magical protection stone Thor brought from Queen Frigga of Asgard, said to guard children against those who wished them ill intent. Thor said that taufrs were common gifts for Asgardian newborns. The presenter would go to one of Asgard’s mines and pick out a gem or a stone they deemed worthy of gifting. Then they cleaned them until they shone and fashioned them into a trinket that would be presented to the babe as soon as they were born. Julia’s stone was chosen by Queen Frigga, and blessed by the Queen, the Allfather, and Thor, making it a rare gem indeed. It was hanging from the very center in a place of honor.
Steve looked at his husband in confusion, which was par for the course since his husband was Anthony Edward Stark, who swung between crazy and genius at the drop of a penny…or a hundred dollar bill as it were, because Tony Stark did not carry change in those hideously expensive slacks, nuh-uh, no way.
“Yes, sir. They know to be careful.”
Steve held it up for Tony to see.
“Yeah,” Steve muttered. “I’ll keep this in mind, Phil. Thank you.”
Peter gulped.
Phil glanced at Julia and sighed. “I don’t blame you, Jim. I blame Tony.”
“Air Force is fine with it, Phil-bug. I already cashed in a favor,” Tony piped up, apparently having heard them over the sound of Julia’s screaming.
“Babe, we don’t exactly spend Thanksgiving like normal folks anyway,” Tony said. “And the holidays have nothing to do with this.”
“She found it delicious! Another!” Thor boomed, a controlled one though, in consideration for infant ears.
Gail laid Julia down between her and Tony, smiling as Julia yawned. Gail laughed when Julia let out a drooly raspberry before sleepily accepting a bottle of warm milk from her.
Oh, that was a thought. Steve leaned forward.
Tony nodded, happy to have gotten his way, as always. “Pep and Happy are coming too, which is awesome. Rhodey won’t be available, because the Air Force can be such horse puckies. We got Steve’s VA boyfriend and Jane, Darcy and Erik will be picked up from the airpo– oops.”
“She’s having fun though,” Steve said, chuckling. He stuck his tongue out and blew one of his own. Julia look so surprised that Steve laughed.
“And I appreciate it,” Tony said, sliding into his lap. “And you know, I’m suddenly not in the mood to go back to my workshop so…” He trailed off. “Let’s go up so you can appreciate
Bruce groaned and raised Julia higher up his chest, as if hiding behind her. “Don’t finish that thought, please.”
“Tony, you know how busy Pepper is. We can go out, but you don’t have to force her of all people to babysit. We can ask Phil or Nat instead, even Bucky.” He looked up in thought. “Or we can take her with us, but I really don’t want the paparazzi getting a picture of her.”
“There we go, my love,” Tony said. He stroked her head and curly brown hair. “Your favorite blanket, your favorite bottle, your favorite jammies, your mobile, and your Mama, with your Daddies just down the hall.”
“You did? You invited Sam?” Steve turned to Tony, surprised. That wasn’t part of the plan. “And stop calling him my VA boyfriend.”
In the end, Bruce had helped with the decision when the scientist, after weeks of listening to their talking and fighting, called Jane and together presented a neat, surprisingly objective, well-researched, and definitely well-referenced paper, wherein the most intelligent people they knew offered their hypotheses on how the super serum would affect their offspring. They even got Reed Richards’ opinion, which Tony didn’t read and insisted almost made the whole paper null and void, but they did get Dr. Helen Cho’s incredibly detailed hypothesis. Tony greatly admired her, so that made up for it.
“Anyway, most parents have a monthly photo book made just so they could brag about how cute their children are while they’re still actually cute enough to have a picture of them taken, or to make creative, blackmail-worthy photos that will haunt their kids for the rest of their lives.” Steve sighed at that, but Tony pressed on. “But people also use it to record their baby’s milestones and important events that have happened over the month and important memories and stuff like that. So I think we should make one for the baby.”
“Even though that is cute, I say to you…” Darcy let out a raspberry. “Jane and I had such good ideas too and Thor was gonna be part of it and you were gonna love it, I tell you! Love it! It was going to be epic!”
“Miss Potts and I thought you might require the services of either a nanny, or at the very least an on-call babysitter,” Phil said as Steve leafed through the personnel files in his hand. “We haven’t interviewed anybody, just did some background checks, then compiled the ones that both Miss Potts and I felt would be a good match. You can take as long as you need to pick one or none at all, but we both thought it would be good for you to have the option.”
“Have fun, son. Oh, and here.” Pops handed over a large takeaway bag of drinks that Peter didn’t notice. “Just a treat, because I think their coffee was good. You can go bring it to all your friends and your guide. Oh, and I’ve added moussaka just for you and Wade as a treat. Very tasty.”
“Surprises…” Steve murmured.
Tony just kept snickering, not stopping even when Steve glared at him.
“Going back.” Tony leaned against Bruce. “You’re sure you are free next week, Doc? No takebacks.”
Darcy pointed a finger at him. “Ha! Lookit that, Iron-ic! I taught your spawn something!”
“I get Pepper, but JARVIS?” Clint asked. “No offense, Skynet.”
Tony pressed his face to Steve’s hair and kissed his ear. Steve leaned back against him, as if knowing his thoughts.
Thor sniffed and let go of Jane. “Aye, the babe is much better company than the likes of some.” He sent a baleful glare at the still-snickering Clint and then clomped towards Julia’s playpen, plopping inside. Julia, always glad to have a doting audience, let out a giggle and crawled towards Thor.
“Erm…” Wade looked confused, but waved gamely at MJ’s camera. “Yeah, I’m Deadpool. It’s nice to meet you all.”
“What? Where?” Clint asked. “Invited to what?”
Clint, Darcy, Natasha, Rhodey, and Tony posts the photo online and it trends all the way until the New Year.]
Bucky winced, looking at the tiny, squirming baby in his arms. “Zvonochek is not going to like that.”
Peter hobbled off as his parents did what they did best – save the world and bickering while they did it.
Tony disappeared around the hall, whistling as he went. Steve watched him leave, feeling a little colder without his husband, but plenty warm enough in the company of friends.
And honestly, Steve would say it was excessive, but he and Tony actually had a lot of fun making those emails.
The elevator dinged open and they stepped inside as Steve opened the other folder.
Gail waved a hand, minimizing the holographs to the side. “You’re not cute, you know that?”
Natasha hummed in agreement, tilting her head to look at Julia. “Her blue eyes are starting to show. I know Gail is the mother, but Yulia looks like quite the combination of Tony and Steve.”
Pepper winked. “We detoured over to a baby-friendly studio before lunch.”
It was like Peter was watching in slow motion as the robber ran past their hiding space, still firing his gauntlet. A ball of electricity exploded close to the wall he and Wade were hiding at.
Steve grinned, and smiled wider at Wade's firm grip and honest smile. “Thank you, and yes, it's just Steve for today. Good luck on your match.”
Steve looked around the stadium, amazed at the leaps and bounds the future had taken. Back in his day, sports were physical and rough. In his wildest dreams, he’d never thought that sports could evolve to the electronic and the imagined. But with the surge of technology, now even online games have evolved into a full-fledged sport. A very competitive sport at that, as per Peter, and a very lucrative one, as per Tony.
“Oh, she and Bruce went to get pizza and takeout,” Steve said, grabbing his phone. “I should tell them to get more.”
“Ooh!” Julia beamed when she saw her aunts and uncles, tired but alive and safe.
“Hey! Hey! Baby in the room. Let’s keep any magical levitating items out of the way,” Tony said from the loveseat close to Julia’s playpen.
“Everybody decent?” Tony called out as they slowly shuffled in. “I mean, I’ve seen worse and I’ve been seen at my worst so pretty much nothing can surprise me but, you know, I just thought I’d ask to be polite.”
“Yeah, because tall, dark and scrumptious over here said he wasn’t going to make it this month. So I had to fake an emergency. Poor Julia.” Tony sighed. “Seems like Uncle Rhodey doesn’t want to take a photo with you.”
Tony was just taking it all in, looking at his husband and daughter(!) and bots.
“Okay. Thanks, Gail,” Steve said to the phone. “See you later tonight, hopefully.” He put his phone in his back pocket and swooped forward, leaning down and kissing Juliana. “Hey, baby girl. You look beautiful today.”
Like a sixth sense, Steve turned towards the doors just as Tony and Pepper stepped in. Pepper was in a sleek, peach-colored pantsuit and Tony was in a dark blue shirt, a suit jacket, white pants and white sneakers with plaint splatters, also painted by Steve to match Peter’s pair.
Tony had left the individual suites alone, but the Avengers’ common floor had a large tree in the living room and a few smaller plastic ones in the various rooms. Their big tree had been decorated beautifully and left with lots of spaces left for anybody who wanted to hang up a décor, which had quickly devolved into a game of who could hang up the most interesting junk – so far there were two glass angels, one of Bruce’s spare glasses, a pair of figurine elves with beer bottles, four sprockets with the bots’ and JARVIS’ names painted on them, an Iron Man mask, strings of dried chili peppers, and Mjolnir balanced near the upper branches. A picture of Juliana on a star-shaped frame was balanced on top of the tree, which Steve knew neither he nor Tony had hung up. And hanging from the back wall was an array of stockings, labeled with all the members of their ragtag family, AIs, bots, magic hammers, and green rage monsters included.
“Hello, Steve.” Pepper laughed behind a hand.
“Don’t call your baby crazy, Tony, for god’s sake,” Phil sighed. “And how many times do we have to tell you - it's just colic.”
Steve stroked a hand over Juliana’s head. Her wild, untameable curls were getting longer by the day, so much like Tony’s own disheveled locks.
“Doctor? Who’s going to the doctor? Why?” Clint asked, wincing.
“You still on that kid-friendly cursing kick?” Darcy asked Tony, grinning as she watched Juliana crawl towards her. She clapped her hands, coaxing Julia closer.
“Oh hey! That’s Reason #34 for crying: I hate my parents’ faces!” Tony grinned madly. “JARVIS, add that to the list!”
DUM-E waved his claw and dropped something on Steve’s lap. It was a crumpled photo. When he looked at it, Steve couldn’t help the chuckle that bubbled up. It was a photo of Tony and DUM-E, taken at MIT when Tony was seventeen for that engineering award he won.
“Don’t be so melodramatic, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Pius tutted as he got ready. “It’s your daughter who’s getting the vaccines, not you.”
Phil sighed, looking at the little papers sticking to him. “Stark, be glad I’m not wearing a suit.”
And it must mean something horrible if Steve could hear the relief in the AI’s voice.
-Avenger. There will be no actual avenging or superhero-ing.” He scoffed.
Tony’s words suddenly registered in his head.
“It’s fine,” Steve said, rubbing Tony’s thigh soothingly. “What’s that in your claw, DUM-E?”
“Fuck you, Barnes,” Clint said.
“I know you are, dear,” Steve said soothingly, “But if we don’t nip these things in the bud, you’re going to run a mile with them.” He waved a hand. “Go on.”
(The only thing that had lifted Tony’s mood was that Julia had puked on Steve’s shield. Steve didn’t really take offense, but Tony decided that they were going with the idea that Julia was just a baby and obviously didn’t know better yet.)
Steve whirled around to look at Juliana who was peeking out from Clint’s arms. She was pointing at the armor.
There was a beat of silence.
Wade noticeably perked up. “Captain America... Er, sorry. Mister Stark-Rogers. I am a big fan!”
Gail already knew she wasn’t going to keep the baby, but she was concerned over the effects her work at SI would have as the baby developed. She had been ready to drop out of the internship if necessary, but Pepper reassured her that SI would still welcome her after the pregnancy and they had policies to protect single mothers from losing their jobs.
Tony: “Stop playing with that JARVIS!”
Steve was watching a promotional video for the event. They were holding the Opening Ceremony in a few hours and Peter told him there were even a few celebrity performers lined up. Steve didn’t know any of the bands or acts he named, but he was just glad his son was so excited.
“What?” he asked. “I mean, they’re not wrong, Rogers. You’re such an ass man.”
She suddenly seemed a bit wistful. Steve was far too familiar with that expression to know there was most likely a story there, but he knew better than to ask. Clint didn’t seem surprised or worried when he glanced over at her. He was leaning back against the foot of couch, Julia on his lap, and was letting her slam her tiny fists on the remote. The TV would have been a mess of sounds and channels if JARVIS wasn’t obviously directing it to cartoons and Christmas carols.
This week though their ninja staff managed to grab their hamper before Steve could get to it, but as per his request, he was the one putting away their things in their drawers. He could look the other way if Tony insisted on just letting somebody wash their underwear, but he wasn’t going to let them put their underwear away for him. Sometimes he even got Tony to help, though that wasn’t very often. The one time he left Tony to it, Tony just stuffed everything into a drawer without folding anything. So usually chores only worked if Steve was there to supervise Tony and if he remained stern about finishing the job and not let Tony
Oh god, their baby was crying.
Julia let out a soft cry and waved a drool-covered fist demandingly. Bruce started rocking her, a bit awkwardly, but it worked. Steve smiled, his baby girl had good timing.
, and, as Tony mentioned, he and Pepper had made enough noise that he would sue anybody who tried to get close enough to try. Steve had never been a fan of making grand announcements or press releases, but he knew he couldn’t just leave it all to Tony. So he had also made it clear that he Strongly Disapproved of children being tailed by the media, especially his own.
There were eighteen sets in total, one set on the day of Tony’s birth and one set for every year until Tony was seventeen. It stopped then, most likely because of Howard and Maria’s deaths.
“Tony, we can’t go to the Parade,” Natasha said. “Pepper banned you and SHIELD banned the rest of us. That’s why we do Thanksgiving dinner instead.
At the sound, Juliana turned her head to one side, as if trying to look for him. JARVIS’s voice was a near constant after Steve and Tony’s. She cooed.
“Yeah, Gail’s paediatrician,” Steve said. “If we even thought about going to someone else, Gail’s going to be mad.”
“Hey boys, Daddy’s home,” Tony called out, grinning.
“Uhh. Nice ones? What’s wrong with you?” Tony turned to Steve. “Jealous, apple pie? Want me to print one out?” He leered. “One of me? We can pick one from our private–”
Clint ran a hand through her curly locks. “Juju-bean is the most adorable baby in the world. I mean, I’ve seen a few babies and I guess all babies are probably adorable by default, but she is something else. She’s like adorableness times infinity.”
Two days later, it was time for a family dinner-slash-movie night. Steve and Tony had been prepared to pass on movie nights for a long while because Julia was scared of loud noises and any sudden reactions or loud exclamations from the team. But in a show of solidarity, the others would occasionally pick a cartoon, a Disney film, or something mild so that the family of three could join them for a while and then switch to other films after Julia was bundled off to bed.
Clint snickered. “Oh my god, Darce, you know what you did? You just blew a raspberry at Captain America.”
His parents turned to him, both of them smiling.
Julia looked up at Bruce, chicken leg in her mouth and smiled. Bruce looked down and stroked the flower pinned to her hair. Julia giggled.
“Mommy Gail and b-baby… Juliana Jae Stark-Rogers.”
Steve didn’t even bother hiding the fact that he was getting teary-eyed.
Since it was Julia’s first winter, Tony had been adamant that Julia sleep on the bed and not her bassinet.
Thor motioned to Natasha with a raised brow at Steve, as if to say ‘see?’
Tony moved to a spot away from the bright windows, and kept his hand against his baby’s neck, thumb rubbing against a shoulder. Then he rocked slowly to and fro, murmuring gently.
Tony was dazed and he nodded absently as he headed for the elevator.
Tony scoffed and waved a hand. “And honestly, your record speaks for itself, kid. SI Scholars was happy to offer you a slot. Didn't even have to do anything.” He waved a hand towards Steve. “Wade, this is my husband, Steve. Steve, Wade Wilson. He's going to be playing later.”
“And by that, I mean… um… I’m fine. Don’t worry,” Peter amended. “Sorry.”
“You sure you’re riding out there at night, Colonel?” Bruce asked.
“My friend, it is very obvious,” Thor said, chuckling greatly and standing up to bring his plate to the sink.
“Where’s Gail?” Steve asked, looking out towards the hall.
“Ah, ah, ah, Juju-bean. No grabby the ears,” Clint said, taking her hands away from the hearing aids. “Uncle Clint needs that to hear your beautiful screams.”
“Oh, please don’t,” Darcy said, following the archer. “I’d love to watch.”
[Image: In the middle is Juliana, dozing on her bassinet placed on a two-foot tall stand. She’s wearing a onesie that had colorful gears, gauges, and wires drawn on it. Her baby cap has a tiny antenna poking from the top. DUM-E is in the middle behind her, waving a fire extinguisher. U is holding up a video camera. Butterfingers is leaning down, one claw clamped around a corner of Juliana’s baby blanket. All three bots have a birthday party hat strapped on their claws. In the background are a series of holographs, including one of the Iron Man armor. Looking closely, one will be able to see the letters J-A-R-V-I-S highlighted among the visuals.]
.” He waggled his eyebrows.
“You what?” Bucky asked.
Steve ducked his head, flushing a little. “Thanks, Phil.” He smiled. “And I can’t believe Julia’s almost four months old. It’s like she came home to us only yesterday.”
“My turn to what?” he asked. Steve wiped Juliana’s chin with a bib. Oh, but they had a leaky baby in their hands.
“This is supposed to be a cultural exposure trip,” Peter hissed. “
Juliana had Steve.
Steve paused when he noticed that the door to the playroom was open. Ever since Julia came into their lives, the Avengers and most of their family and friends usually took the trip to the playroom to see her or hang out in her room. Many a time their friends, or even Steve and Tony themselves, would just sit on the rocking chair with or without Julia in the room.
“Hey, I don’t blame Julia. Being a baby is hard,” Clint spoke up. “Everything is just so big and awful and terrible for someone so tiny and fragile.”
Thor had been the last to meet Juliana, already three weeks since she was born before a strike of lightning revealed the Asgardian on the landing pad at the Tower balcony. Thankfully, Pepper had taken Julia to the nursery or else the baby would have startled badly at the flash of light.
[Image 3: Rhodey has his back turned to the camera. He is completely naked, save for the metal jetboots of his suit.]
“What s’it?” Tony asked, blinking slowly.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sex, then sleep, then sex some more. Chop chop, Rogers.”
Steve poked Tony’s forehead with the eraser end of his pencil. “Stop cursing.”
“–Especially as she has yet to understand them. But once she is of age, then she can use them most aptly.” Thor nodded sagely. “I don’t partake in it myself, but Lady Sif and Brunnhilde say it is quite invigorating, shouting it to the heavens as they pummel their foes.”
There was a thud and Tony skidded in from the hall on socked feet, wide-eyed. “What is it? I’m here. JARVIS called. What happened? What’d she do?”
“You were adorable though,” Tony said, leaning against Steve. He waved a hand and JARVIS, ever dependable and intuitive, brought up a photo of tiny Steve with his Ma. It was one of Steve’s few and most cherished photos. Steve didn’t really like anybody looking at those, but he didn’t mind if it was Tony.
“I had to,” Tony protested. “How else was he going to get out of the evil clutches of the Air Force?”
“Same diff, now shush,” Da said, waving a hand. “What I’m saying is, this is not about you. Your Pops was the one who wanted to go to on a trip, and he’d always wanted to go to Greece. So blame him.”
“Peter! Miss Alanis was wondering why you’ve been gone– oh hey, Mister and Mister Stark-Rogers!”
Bucky took her on automatic, never one to resist carrying his godchild. He cradled her with his flesh and blood arm and rubbed at his face with the other. He looked down at Juliana.
The face plate slid up to show Rhodey’s intensely unamused face. “Why the hell would I even bother thinking about what to wear when you left me some vague message telling me to rush over here because there some kind of emergency, you fu– da– bas–” Due to the baby in the room, he glared at Tony for lack of a curse.
“Oh, daaaamn, that sounds good,” Clint moaned.
JARVIS: “Thank you, Captain.”
“Oh, please.” Tony scoffed. He accepted his plate from Steve. “You’re Captain America’s best friend, you live in New York City, and you joined this mess of a clown brigade. You’re the most photographed assassin in the world. Your privacy’s already shot to kingdom come, you donut bumper.”
“Good. Good. Thanks, Jay.” Tony pressed the last button and sighed when he heard the soft click of the locks sliding open. That sound was like coming home.
“Anyway,” Phil waved a hand, “As agreed, you’ll be doing regular hours for a few weeks in a consultant and trainer’s capacity. I took the liberty of pulling a few of the open cases we have so you can review them with fresh eyes, and I have the stats of some of the new recruits you’ll be overseeing once you come back, just a few things to get back into the loop.”
“Well, thank you for that, son, and for bringing these,” Pops said. “You staying for lunch?”
“It was a surprise! And, I mean, it seemed like such a waste to put just one photo in that tube, not to mention it was a waste of poster paper and ink!”
“You two look absolutely perfect,” Tony said, sincerity so clear in his voice.
“What’s up, coconut?” Tony raised a hand to his best friend.
Pepper walked in, toting a slim package. She sat down on a loveseat across from Tony. “They’re all fine. The engineers are having fun with them and when they inevitably break it, you can storm down there and shout at them for being idiots.”
“To be fair, Tony, Juliana’s probably just making sounds and doesn’t actually understand the concept of awe.” Bruce sighed. “Come on, Thor. We still have to make lunch. Hopefully the pasta didn’t overboil.”
The pole was also detachable, and Tony had unscrewed the top part from the stand and had brought it over to Gail’s bed, sliding it into the pole fastened behind her headboard.
“Ooh! Ooh! Let’s have the oldies answer that one,” Clint said, elbowing Bucky and letting out a yelp when Bucky elbowed him back with his metal arm.
At this point, he was mostly trying to web all manner of flying debris from hitting civilians or glass windows or buildings as the assailant got farther and farther away. Peter had to find a way to stall him and keep him in place until backup arrived.
Clint had only one hearing aid on, wincing at every scream, and he looked like he wanted to cry himself. Bucky was gritting his teeth and stabbing his fork so hard he was liable to break the plate, maybe even the countertop. Natasha kept drumming her fingers on the table. Phil had more control and looked unbothered, but Steve had noticed he had been on the same page on his paperwork for near twenty minutes now.
One of their stops for the day allowed them a few hours to stroll around the square and indulge all the souvenir shops and artisan booths. Peter had to make sure he had gifts for all of his family and friends – Da and Pops (because they might both be in Greece too, but Peter was Still Required), Ned (anything gladiator-related), MJ (something called the Greek Evil Eye), JARVIS and the bots (surprisingly, they asked for old tiles, pottery, or stones to scan and study), Uncle Buck and Uncle Clint (they secretly liked matching couple stuff), Auntie Pepper, Uncle Happy and Uncle Rhodey (who were the easiest and less fussy), Auntie Nat, Uncle Thor, Uncle Bruce, and Uncle Phil (who all liked something odd or funny).
“Lady Darcy bears credit for the babe’s new skill,” Thor said, and then let out a mighty raspberry of his own, so loud it made Julia screech happily.
“All done, my darling?” Steve smiled. “That’s a good girl.” He swung her up against the bib on his shoulder and patted her on the back as he walked back and forth, trying to get her to burp. She spat on the bib with a gurgle and after cleaning her up, she was back to being smiley and ready to face the day.
“And your jokes don’t seem to be getting any better, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Pius clapped back. “How’s the baby?”
Da’s head popped up from the couch where he had been reclining with Pops, but a large hand grabbed his head and pulled him down.
“…No.”
“I am not a child, Steven.” Tony snorted, and then promptly dropped a piece of syrup-soaked pancake on his shirt. “Oh, fu– fiddlesticks.”
“But we’re all still cooking Thanksgiving dinner, okay,” Steve stressed, looking around at everyone.
Steve grinned, pleased to see Clint a little more back to his usual self.
“DUM-E, U, Butterfingers, meet Juliana Stark-Rogers.”
Tony was thinking about the viability of inhalable vaccines and whether Stark Industries should get on that. Steve was murmuring to Julia in hushed tones, mostly about how vaccines were important and that she shouldn’t be scared of needles. She was enraptured all throughout, looking at her Poppa, holding onto Steve’s fingers with one hand and nibbling at her own fingers with the other. Tony had one eye trained on them, helpless in the face of how much he loved his family.
Steve grinned as Tony flushed, red and blotchy in that way he did when he was caught off guard and didn’t have time to compose himself. He chuckled when his husband hid his warm face in Steve’s chest.
“That is true,” Tony muttered, sliding onto the floor and making a silly face for Julia. “Barton and Barnes better be thankful I haven’t murdered them.”
Clint tossed himself off the top of the fridge and made a beeline for the trio. Natasha was closest and he fluttered about, wanting to touch her but waiting for her permission. She grabbed his hand and murmured something to him that made him calm down. Bucky made to pass them on his way to the couch, but Clint’s hand shot out, grabbing his vest. Bucky didn’t seem too put out and they glanced at one another meaningfully before Clint let the man go. Phil simply walked up to Clint, flicked him on the forehead and then headed for the loveseat.
Today, they were supposed to watch Moana, and the others even brought Julia gifts. Natasha had dressed her in a pink top and white shorts similar to baby Moana, and even tied a plastic pink flower on Julia’s brown curls. Clint brought along a chicken Heihei stuffed toy. Julia had screeched at it, banged it on the blanket covered floor for a few moments, before starting to gnaw on one of the chicken’s legs. Clint counted it as a win.
“I think it’s hilarious,” the archer said, only to yelp when Mjolnir suddenly shot off its spot hanging from the Christmas tree and flew past Clint, bringing his legs up in the nick of time lest they be dragged right off him. “Hey!”
Phil and Natasha greeted them good morning, with Natasha taking time to press a kiss to Julia’s chubby cheek. She smiled indulgently when Julia sighed at her.
“Nah, it’s fine. Happy will be here.” Steve snapped his fingers. “Oh, and Gail’s coming for dinner, by the way. Hopefully. Maybe.” He winced.
Their tiny bundle of joy had two of the world’s greatest superheroes for fathers, and had Pepper, Rhodey, Happy and the Avengers as her godparents, aunts, uncles and role models. She had the world’s most advanced AI and the three most protective bots as her guardians and brothers.
Clint made gagging noises before turning to Bucky. “Okay, how about you, pretty boy? You stole some rando phone and it’s Steve, right?”
“I’m a bit burned, but the webs were perfect,” he breathed, waving his web shooter. “But I’m gonna need one more to balance things out.”
“Me?” Bucky looked so gobsmacked Steve had to bite down the urge to smile.
“Oooh! Wooh!”
“There, there, darling. It can’t be helped,” Jane said, kissing the top of Thor’s head. “Julia’s here though, and she’s always happy to see you.”
“You staying for lunch, Rhodey?” Bruce asked.
Oh god, he kind of wanted to cry.
A hologram appeared, hovering just in front of them, showing a series of photos dated by year. Steve pressed his shoulder against his husband’s comfortingly, before leaning forward to inspect them, bringing up each one. Tony didn’t seem inclined to say anything about them, so Steve didn’t think to ask.
“Why are we banned again?” Bucky asked, to which Clint motioned explosions, screaming, before dramatically fainting on the floor. Julia giggled at the image.
“Hey! Julia learned how to blow a raspberry!” Clint cheered.
Steve watched them all, warm and amused. It was times like these when the ever-present ice in his veins seemed to thaw almost completely. He remembered once again that for all there were things to miss and be saddened about, there were also so many more things to be grateful for.
“Peter, let’s go!” Wade tugged harder until he managed to squeeze himself and Peter down a tight alley.
“I said I
“Penthouse, please,” Steve said. “I just need to get changed. Then, please tell Tony I’ll be at the gym. He and Rhodey can play with Julia, but remind them she’ll need a nap soon.”
Tony chuckled and waved to the camera, but Steve dutifully took a step back.
Steve let them have a bit of privacy and handed Julia over to Bruce, ignoring the man opening his mouth in an attempt to decline. He and Tony had talked about it and they both agreed on how important it was for Bruce to bond with the baby. Hell, they both knew it was important for the baby to bond with
Bruce nodded, a little hesitant, but still willing. “Yes, I’m free.”
Peter ran, following after the panic and damage the attacker left behind. He finally saw him up ahead. The man fired off a round and Peter saw a bunch of tables and chairs outside a café fly into the air. Another hit sent a parked motorcycle skidding down the road and Peter webbed the vehicle away before it could hit a man and his daughter who were running for cover. Peter stopped to help the man hide inside a shop with some others, before he ran off again.
“You’re all far too easy to please,” Tony grumbled, trying to put up a front despite the sweet gesture. And yeah, Steve married the sweetest, most kind-hearted fella.
Tony tilted his head, confused. “Hm? What’d you have in mind?”
Steve was kind of hoping it was the latter, because for all that Rhodey was one of the best men Steve knew, he was still weak when faced against Tony’s wiles. When they were together, things and people ended up broken, on fire, drunk, or naked, sometimes all at the same time. Steve wouldn’t want Julia to see that, at least not until she was old enough to understand that Dada and Uncle Rhodey just had a really special friendship – romance, really – that nobody understood, except maybe Aunty Pepper.
“And I think it appropriate for Anthony to show restraint,” Thor added. “We would not want your offspring spouting such foul words.”
“I was on a mission at the time in Ireland,” Natasha shared. “There was a couple getting married close to the hotel I was staying at. The bride was redheaded, easy to pretend I was a cousin.” She smirked. “I may have swiped a few bottles from the open bar. Helped me get through the mission.”
Steve waited until Tony murmured something under his palm. He leaned away and rubbed Tony’s cheek with a thumb.
Steve sighed, as if it was such a burden, but the kiss he placed on Tony’s nose probably didn’t help. He stood up and looked down at his own grease-stained shirt from Tony’s questing fingers.
“You’re still seeing Dr. Axel Pius, right?” Bruce asked.
“Which you are, of course you are,” Steve insisted.
Tony plopped Julia on Bruce’s lap, who immediately and very, very gently held her in place. Tony raised a fist in the air and Julia replied by immediately gnawing on Heihei’s tail, giggling.
“Wait. Before we hold her,” Tony rocked on his heels in excitement. “Gail, we’re thinking of making a monthly baby photo book.”
, bundle in his arms.
“Oh, shut it,” Tony said, glaring weakly at the nearest camera, while Steve only laughed.
Steve flushed and Tony snickered against his chest. Steve was tempted to pinch him, but it would just draw Pepper’s attention.
“Here, we go.” Steve smiled at Tony and gave him one last kiss before turning to the baby in his arms. He pulled away the edge of the soft, fuzzy blanket, and revealed their newest guest to the three attentive, now-quiet bots.
There was another scream from Julia and Steve winced as his ears rang. Phil noticed and gave a sympathetic smile.
“Good, good,” Tony shout-whispered. “Now, smile! Distract him!”
And Peter… well… he kind of had a lame crush on him.
Natasha’s lips quirked a tiny bit. “In this case, shots mean medical injections, Thor. Yulia is going to get vaccines injected into her, which prevents her from contracting serious diseases or illnesses as she gets older.”
“Hey, beautiful,” Steve greeted. “And hello, Tony.”
Bruce, who had been quietly plowing through his meal amidst all the chatter, looked up, wide-eyed. “Um… uh…”
Phil nodded and there was that small quirk to his lips that said he definitely didn’t mind. He waved a hand over his should and left them to it.
JARVIS replied.
Steve shrugged. “I just thought Rhodey was going to follow after Pepper.”
Steve chuckled. “So as scary as it is and as much as we say no, Tony and I know we’re not going to stop her from doing anything she wants.”
This was his baby, his and Steve’s baby.
Peter made to apologize, but Wade just poked him on the cheek.
The man had a package tucked under one arm and a gauntlet or brace of some sort wrapped around his other arm.
is true, and I agree. If Juliana wants to curse out men, then she can. She should, actually.”
Steve was awed at the gesture. Everybody had been so supportive when he and Tony started dating all the way to when they got married. Steve didn’t really think that would change now that they have a kid, but displays like these from the people he considered his family couldn’t help reminding him that he had a lot to be thankful for.
Oh shit.
Later that night, Rhodey was finally getting ready to suit up and head back. He was getting in a final cuddle with Juliana, who was thankfully feeling agreeable about being doted upon. Tony was being petty and pouty on the couch, occasionally wailing that Rhodey didn’t have to leave.
“Hey! Hey! Hey, you hunk of junk. You’re going to hit Steve.” Tony whacked DUM-E’s base. There was an undercurrent of relief in his voice at the tension breaking.
“You can feel it, can’t you?” Steve asked, looking up at his husband from where he was on the floor playing with Juliana. He was going back to SHIELD tomorrow and he was a ball of mixed emotions right now.
“Knew you’d like it.” Tony grinned in satisfaction, ducking back into the square-ish contraption on his workshop floor. “Practically everyone has one these days.”
“See you later, guys,” Steve called back. “Give her a few weeks and then you can all even come up to see her.”
Wade jogged forward, reminding Peter of another reason he didn’t want his parents around.
“Yes, dear?” Steve started folding underwear again. Maybe if he hurried, he could get them in the drawer, and Tony wouldn’t have time to mess them up even more.
“Ga! Boo!” Julia waved her fists. Gail blew one too, and Julia erupted into giggles. She turned to Tony, an expectant look on her face. Tony blew one right on her cheek.
find out that they all cried and they would tease Tony so, so much more than Steve and that was just a big no-no.
“Hear, hear,” Natasha cheered, smiling kindly. “The Captain has spoken.”
[Image 7: Steve and Sam talking and drinking beer as they watched the parade on TV.]
Steve couldn’t help noticing the glaring fact that, even considering those of his playboy days, there were only a handful of pictures that had Tony smiling,
Tony shrugged. “I was being kid-friendly.” He stood up, stretching his arms over his head. He was in a thick, faded Stark Industries sweater, jeans and thick socks that were probably Steve’s. He moved over to sit beside Steve, one hand curling around the knee where Juliana was standing, still transfixed by JARVIS’ cartoon.
“And,” Steve poked Tony on the side again, sending him scrambling away and making Julia giggle, “And it’s Thanksgiving, so we have much to be thankful for, like Julia and family and the fact that we all haven’t killed one another yet, or that nothing has killed us.”
Peter personally didn’t care. A lifetime of lessons from his Pops and Da, not to mention being around superheroes and villains, taught him that looks were literally skin-deep. There was so much more about a person underneath all that that was much more interesting and important.
Peter snorted. “Tell me about it.”
“Why what’s wrong, babe?” Tony asked.
Tony smirked. “I haven’t repeated one so far, peach bottom.”
not make it in time. And I was supposed to be on my way to a meeting to request leave, you as– ar– jerk,” He ended none-too-gracefully.
“Ooh, profanity, big word, Barton,” Bucky smirked, kicking Clint on the shin lightly.
“Oh, congratulations!” Wade greeted enthusiastically.
Tony humphed, crossing his arms and obviously fighting a grin. “Try again, Rogers.”
“Sir, Captain, Miss Potts is on the line,” JARVIS said, sounding a little amused.
“T-That’s great!” Peter said, glancing at Wade then looking away.
Steve exchanged looks with Tony. Even Pepper gave them a telling look. MJ was still taking videos.
As expected, Tony took it with a wink and fluttering eyelashes, but Steve laughed and kissed his cheek.
“More like a PowerPoint presentation, complete with graphs,” Happy shrugged, rocking Juliana along with it. She was blessedly soothed now though, as per Reason #34.
Really, none of them had any stones to throw at this point calling anyone a sap or a pushover.
The man fired.
“Tony…”
Everyone perked up, save for Bucky who looked smug.
“Oh shit. Damn.” Tony reared back.
“I’m prettier,” Bucky huffed. Natasha cleared her throat and Clint outright snorted, and Bucky immediately rounded on them. “Don’t even. You all know I am.”
“Yes, they’re cute. I know, darling. I think Auntie Nat bought these for you. What do you think?” He looked at one then the other. “Are we feeling Math-nerdy today or Doctor-nerdy?”
in Greece.”
“Will do,” Gail said, chuckling and holding out a hand to Julia’s tiny one. “Shall we have a bedtime story, my little miracle?”
“My turn to what?” he asked. Steve wiped Juliana’s chin with a bib. Oh, but they had a leaky baby in their hands.
“It’ll be fine, darling.” Steve kissed his grumpy husband on the forehead. “And Bucky is never going to pose for a photo. So we’re going with candids. Let them play, JARVIS will take a few shots or videos, I’ll see if I can take a good one of them, and then we’ll use that for the photo.”
smiling, and those were the ones from the ages of one, two, and three. After that, his expressions ranged from despondent to defiant to cocky to… lifeless.
“But she’ll have pictures of it, and of us celebrating with her.” Steve shrugged. “Part of it is a change in scenery really. She’s still growing but she soaks things up like a sponge and we want her to be exposed to these things. We rarely have reason to take her out as it is, what with paparazzi always around.” He smiled when Clint tossed Bruce the Heihei toy which made Julia more determined to get to him. “She’ll have a lot of years to spend here at the tower, but we’re not really sure if next year we’ll have time to take her out and who knows if maybe she won’t even like it and we’ll make up a different tradition.”
“Oh, but she will, and no one will stop her,” Tony scoffed. He raised two fingers. “Two, I have caused her enough pain, headaches, and stress over the past years, so honestly, if Pepper needs my baby to… I don’t know, unwind or something, then I can’t really contest that.”
Steve spoke carefully. His and Tony’s thoughts on this weren’t a secret. Some of the team had asked them about it, and Tony had never been quiet about his opinion on the matter. God knew none of the team would judge them regarding their choices as parents. But this was also something he and Tony were personally working on.
Gail’s laugh was gentle and bright. Steve thought it was only romanticised in books, but Gail’s laugh always reminded him of the pretty sound of tinkling bells.
“I have it all planned. Hotel’s ready for us by Monday, so we get an extra day to take in the amenities and get the turkey and Thanksgiving dinner ready and all that pizzazz. Then we watch the Parade on Tuesday, have Thanksgiving dinner that night, and we’ll all be home, probably by Thursday, because we’ll spend Wednesday puking our guts out from overeating.”
For all he was old and straightforward as hell, Dr. Pius was sneaky and worked swiftly. Before Tony could blink and while Steve was cuddling Juliana, he started on the shots.
Tony finally turned to him, letting the tablet slip to the carpeted floor. “Okay, see… between the photos up in the nursery, Pepper and Rhodey, not to mention Robocop, all talking about it, and Julia’s daily, weekly, and monthly email blasts–”
“Already done,” Jane said, waving her own phone. “Movie night? Or is everyone too tired for it?”
Juliana sucked her bottle slowly and lethargically. DUM-E almost reached out, but stopped himself in time and clicked his claws in concern. Tony reached out and patted DUM-E on the arm approvingly. U kept the camera trained their way, moving it this way and that in a way that was probably going to be dizzying once they watched it later.
“I’m gonna go make some calls and most likely soothe a few ruffled feathers,” Phil muttered under his breath.
“Jane hit Thor with her jeep and Darcy tasered him,” Natasha reminded him.
Thor looked saddened at that reminder. “Aye. I have seen her in photographs and we have exchanged pleasantries through cellular devices. But as it appears, we are not yet fated to meet in person. Perhaps tonight will change that.”
“Da, Pops,” Peter called out. “Sorry I was being a brat about you guys being around in the first place.”
Tony really kind of loved that his daughter had a god for an uncle.
Pre-serum Steve had a strong intuition, something that was still present post-serum, especially when coupled with his heightened senses. And honestly, when applied to his devious, mischievous, trouble-making husband, well… he had learned to always,
Steve gave in to the urge to pinch Tony’s hip. “The better question is: what have you been telling her?”
Steve stepped back and whispered to Tony. “He’s who again?”
Maybe Steve’s earlier thought was wrong. Bruce was probably the one who brought that darn magazine, not Clint.
Steve turned automatically towards Thor, who wasn’t able to catch Julia’s bottle as it missed the carpet and landed on the ground with a ding. Julia’s hand was raised, obviously having pushed the bottle away after being done with it. She looked pleased at what she had done and let out a giggle, arms and legs pinwheeling.
Peter thought of protesting, but Wade looked firm so he nodded, leading him down the hall. He sighed in relief when the TV was off and found his parents were gone.
Wade Wilson was nineteen years old and made a name for himself as an e-sports player. Under the moniker Deadpool, he became well-known for his specialty in death match games and for famously defeating former E-League champion Ajax two years ago during his debut as a professional e-sports player. Stark E-Games Division immediately snapped him up as one of their sponsored pro e-sports players. Since he was still set to enter college, their offer also came with a spot as one of Stark Industries Scholars.
“There you are, pretty girl.” He walked over to Bucky. “Now, here.”
“Hey!” Tony griped.
Steve sighed, even as Tony wrapped his arms around his waist. “Tony, don’t matchmake our son.”
U and Butterfingers nodded, moving their arms up and down with their claws twirling round and round. DUM-E was pushing his claw into Tony’s face, beeping excitedly and impatiently.
Juliana blew a raspberry and then said, “Ba! Boo!”
“And where is Darcy, giver of knowledge?” Natasha asked. She had bullied Tony into giving her a foot massage.
“Hey, Gail,” Steve called out.
Tony waved a hand at Steve, keeping him back, and stepped forward so he could give the terrible trio cursory checks and pat them calmer.
Steve smiled, reaching out to pat each of their claws. “This is Juliana, and she’s going to be your new baby sister.”
Dr. Pius said, frowning. “I have heard thousands of babies cry, but hers is quite intensely saddening.”
Tony shrugged again. “Nah. I mean, seriously, they probably know. They’re just wondering about the order and probably planning their shoot. I say we not mention a thing and make them squirm.”
Tony bounced over and Steve immediately stepped back, but ended up getting confetti stuck in his hair.
His phone beeped.
“Boo.” Julia smiled toothily at him, her little palms pressed against Steve’s cheeks. Steve felt his heart melt.
Christmas was always bittersweet, and there were so many other people that Steve would miss, moments he would never get back, nightmares that would probably never stop, maybes and what ifs that would always run through his mind. But the world had also been kind to him – new friends gained and old ones returned, once-in-a-lifetime (twice in his case) experiences compared to most people, a husband and a child to share his life with and shower with all the love he had inside him.
“Yes, Captain.”
“Get some clothes on, Colonel, then you’ll get a turn,” Natasha said. She bounced Julia up and down.
He just received odd looks from everybody for that, even Bruce, even Steve…
Steve watched them both, his husband and daughter, and felt like the luckiest man in the world.
“You can’t have them all, Barton. Learn to share,” Tony called out. “And I can’t believe I’m saying that to you and not the six month old.”
Butterfingers suddenly perked up and slowly, almost comically wheeled forward inch by inch until his claws caught on the end of Juliana’s blanket by her tiny,
“He found it in my files and had JARVIS print it out. He keeps it in his charging station,” Tony said. He was scoffing, but Steve was intimately familiar with that twitch to his lip.
Steve moved back and started putting the underwear and shirts away. “Why don’t you ask her, Tony? You were the one who noticed it after all.” When he turned back, Tony was sporting a massive pout. The engineer held up a finger.
Peter elbowed him. “Don’t encourage them, please.”
“I love Juju-bean and all, but I do not envy you guys,” Clint said. “I mean, she’s going to cry, like a lot. Whenever she cries, it feels like something inside me shrivels up and dies.”
“Steve. Steeeeeve. Steven!”
The call immediately cut off.
The birth mother, Gail, had supplied them with more than few bottles of breast milk ready in the fridge and freezer. Gail produced a lot of milk and while Tony wanted to stockpile, both Steve and Gail had patiently told him there were too many babies out there who needed breast milk, so they also donated a few.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked. “What are you looking at?”
Steve was almost hit on the face when Tony held his phone in front of him. He leaned back and squinted at the screen. “Oh, so she did. Um, not that I don’t want Pepper to babysit, but why did she pencil that in?”
Realistically, it all happened in mere minutes, but it felt longer with the way Juliana was crying.
“Tony, I’m going to go see Phil out. Plus, my ears are ringing,” he said.
“U, just make sure not to smash the camera on the baby’s face, and mine and Steve’s for that matter,” Tony said. “Butterfingers, no, you cannot hold the baby. Not yet. Ok, boys?” He waved a hand towards the ceiling. “JARVIS, they good?”
[Image 3: Natasha smiling at the camera as she sat on the sofa with a mug of tea. Clint has his head on her lap, crossing his eyes and sticking his tongue out.]
“…six-thirty, is that okay?” Steve was saying to his phone as he walked in the door. He pressed a hand to the speaker. “Tony, don’t let Julia spend too long without clothes.”
Steve leaned back and smiled as Tony licked his lips, a soft warm blush rising on his cheeks. Giving his husband time to recover, Steve leaned down towards their princess for a kiss, but she was far too busy valiantly trying fitting her fist in her mouth and getting drool everywhere.
supposed to be here.”
Steve stepped close to kiss Tony’s cheek and then Juliana’s curls. Her crying had tapered off, but she was still sniffling and getting snot and drool on Tony’s neck and collar. He didn’t mind. He’d rather go to a meeting with baby puke all over him than not comfort his own child when she was crying and in pain and confused about it.
It took Steve a while to figure out what he meant. To be fair though, he was making a mental note to ask their paediatrician, Dr. Pius, if maybe Juliana was teething.
Steve grinned. “Lead the way, hubby.”
Gail and her child were their miracle.
“Graphs are the boooomb,” Tony slurred.
you, is more like,” Peter muttered.
“It is Colonel James Rhodes, Captain,” JARVIS answered, bringing up the image of War Machine.
“Well, that’s the end of that game,” Clint announced, fluttering his eyelashes at them all before he dragged Bucky away. “I feel so close with you all. Yay team!”
“Tony, don’t drown in your coffee,” Phil said. “The paperwork will be horrific.”
Steve tried to push Tony off his lap. “JARVIS, what’s happening outside?”
Da’s eyes lit up. “Does it? We can buy some to bring home.” He turned to Peter. “See? How could I deprive your father of
And they looked cute together, with their matching curly brown hair, which always made Steve reach for his phone or his sketchbook.
housekeeping staff. Steve liked doing chores though, so he always tried to carve out some mundane tasks for himself before the staff could get to them, like sweeping the rec room, cleaning the gym, or doing laundry. It wasn’t as if it was a hardship for him, and Clint and Tony both amassed enough messes to keep the staff busy, not to mention the added mess of gigantic proportions when Thor was in town, so Steve knew he was lessening their burden.
“Thank you. I know Bucky will love it, Tony, even if he’ll try to hide it.” He rubbed the shell of Tony’s ear. “Thank you. I love you.”
Yeah, taking into perspective. Peter really was lucky. Wade lost his parents and no relatives took him in. He never even got adopted, and his ‘guardian,’ who Wade called Blind Al, was more of a roommate than an actual guardian.
“You’ll never take us alive!” he screamed as Julia absolutely shrieked in delight.
Clint made a face and murmured something under his breath. Darcy let out a snort, and tucked Julia into her arms. “Man in Black and the One-Armed Wonder told birdbrain to stop calling, and he’s too chicken to bother Lady Russia in the first place.”
Pops sighed, grabbing Da’s hand and pressing a kiss to gauntleted knuckles. “I know. I know. I shouldn’t have said it. I cursed us.”
“JARVIS–”
When one was married to a billionaire, things like laundry and folding clothes were taken care of by a staff – and no, Phil wasn’t their housekeeper, or JARVIS, or Pepper, though all three of them vetoed the tower’s
He knew better than most that the ignorance hurt far worse than any wound.
“They’d be impressed,” Natasha spoke up, staring at the photo. She tilted her head to the side. “I didn’t know Rhodey looked like that under the suit.”
“Hey! / Natasha’s smaller!” Clint and Tony glared at Bucky, but the former immediately turned to the latter, hissing, “Tony, the hell?”
Steve waved a hand and followed Phil down the hall towards the elevator.
None of them liked hearing Juliana cry. The first night Juliana had her crazy time, none of the Avengers slept. Even Bruce said the Other Guy hated it.
Gail poked him on the ticklish side, and Tony swatted her hand away.
Wade was smart and funny and nice and he was good at games and he didn’t mind Peter’s techno babble and awkwardness and he got along with Ned and MJ and his parents and…
Wade’s blue eyes grew so, so wide. “You designed the new Stark VR console?” He stepped forward.  “That’s so cool! I heard the new VR console has a totally different interface than other VR headsets and they even upgraded the command system!”
[Image 2: Thor twirling Jane in the air, a beaming Darcy and Erik waving in the background.]
“That was well done, Mr. Stark,” he said. “Far more eloquent than I had expected.”
Bucky:
“Yep.” Tony took a swig of coffee. He looked at Steve’s confused face. “Cheesecake, you’re a hell of a lot smarter than the blond hair clichés.”
“Pete said the same thing. It was actually like, one of the first things he said he fixed with the new console,” Ned commented, ever supportive, as Peter flushed redder.
“Bucky.” Steve sighed and motioned to the baby in his arms.
Steve had to resist stroking a finger over the photo in his lap or else get charcoal on the frame. It was of Pepper, Happy, and Juliana and Steve knew exactly what it was for. He held it out to Tony, who took it and smiled, one hand slowly rubbing Juliana’s back. Steve placed a hand on Tony’s hip.
The baby mobile had been one of the team’s projects for the baby and they had hung all manners of items from it, each person contributing a little something of themselves for the new addition to their family. They gifted it to Julia for her second month celebration and she had loved it ever since, always watching it whenever it was in sight and crying whenever she couldn’t find it once she was laid down for a nap.
Happy nodded, smiling as he listened patiently.
Dr. Pius hummed. “Now, baby, let’s check your heart.” He warmed the end of his stethoscope.
So Steve, Tony, the Avengers, Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy waited and paced and cried (just the new parents though, as Bucky liked reminding them) until hours and hours later, they finally got to see the baby.
In the middle of recounting the aftermath about what happened in Greece, from Wade’s point of view left out on the street and Peter having to get ferried out of the scene by Iron Man – in vague terms, of course. Wade didn’t have the appropriate clearance level… yet – Pops walked in.
“Petey, Wade’s being sponsored by Stark E-Games and he's a Stark Industries Scholar so he’ll actually be around
“Wait, how do you all know?” Steve asked, sputtering, indignant and a little red in the face.
“Eeehhhh.” Tony made an undecided, yo-yoing, so-so gesture with both hands, before shrugging.
“I brought you some doughnuts,” Wade said as he put down his loot on the table. “The ones you liked, plus some extra ones for your dads. I got their favorite flavors, which was easy enough because the donut shop knew what they were.”
He looked up from his sketchbook. Tony was on the floor, greased up from hands to elbows, neck, and left cheek from working on… something, but it was obvious his mind was multitasking.
days and his bots, though loved and cherished, were still cold machines. (As in literal, machine, steel kind of cold, okay? Because nothing in this world would convince Tony that his bots had no personality or warmth, and that was that!)
“Sure. It’ll be nice, memories for all of us.” Steve smiled, leaning down to kiss Tony gently. He tasted a little like coffee, sugar, and the sandwich Steve had to force him to eat, but his mouth was warm and sweet and Steve loved him. He leaned back and Tony was a little flushed and a lot happy. “But I don’t want it to be about milestones and… and not just random memories though.”
One of the things Tony and Steve had talked and fought about long and hard was on who their child was going to be genetically related to. Tony insisted Steve was the better sperm donor, because heee-lloooo? Peak of human perfection, enhanced abilities, accelerated healing factor; enough said. Steve, on the other hand, thought Tony should be the donor, mainly because he didn’t know what the serum could do to their baby.
[Image 1: Gail is beaming at the camera with baby Juliana in her arms, her eyes open and mouth wide in a yawn.]
“Wade! How are you?” Pops greeted.
Tony laid her down on the bed to let Steve put her onesie on. He grabbed his phone and hit speed dial.
Bruce still looked unsure, so Steve decided to help.
“Yes, Sir.” JARVIS immediately opened a hologram screen near the charging station, which made it easier for Tony to usher the bots back and for Steve to move towards the elevator.
The rest of his life could wait.
. Bruce was ridiculously cautious, never once initiating contact, but he – both of them – were family and Juliana was not going to grow up afraid of either of them.
Suddenly there was a knock on the door and it flew open without a word. Phil walked in, cradling their drooling newborn, who was looking adorable in an orange onesie and a green cap, like a little pumpkin.
“Steve, what the hell are you talking about?” Tony asked, acquiescing to the kiss, if a bit shakily.
Steve read the messages. “Yeah, she said she had to help a friend and she’ll be back in two weeks.” He let out a whistle. “That’s a long while.”
His Ma had tried, and so did Bucky, and Steve himself had tried to be careful and not to make trouble. He tried finding work to help her, which would have been easy considering how much help people needed during the winter, but not a lot could actually be done by somebody short, weak, and sickly. What tugged Steve’s heartstrings even more was that as far as he could remember his Ma had never missed a Christmas present. No matter how small, tattered, or broken, his Ma would always have a gift for him and would scold him whenever he tried to return the gesture, claiming money was all better saved or spent on himself.
Steve strapped Juliana deftly in the car seat and Tony checked it over a few times. Ever since it sunk into Tony that he and Steve were going to be parents – which was the first time Tony touched Gail’s baby bump – Tony started designing baby gear, sparking a whole baby line for Stark Industries. The Board thought he was crazy, which was nothing new, but when Tony let it leak to the public to get their reactions, demands started skyrocketing for Iron Man and Captain America approved baby stuff that they finally agreed to give it a try.
