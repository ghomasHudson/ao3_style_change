All of Saturday, I waited.  I was determined not to show my hand so quickly; although in truth I had already – and had been turned down!  I smarted at the sore of that.  I cursed myself for
Adams found me by the egg dish.  “Morning, Watson,” he said cheerfully.  “How goes it, on your end?”
“It is in the shape of a moustache,” said Holmes, eager now to clarify.  He stood back, anticipating my approval.
The window bore no curtain, and the evening gloom stretched in to meet the shadows that roamed freely by the glimmer of the lamp.  I rather wished we might have waited 'til the morning to begin this wretched task, but Holmes was set on his pursuit and I would tag along behind, avoiding spiders, blowing dust from here to there – did Mrs. Hudson
“It is too warm for gloves now,” he exclaimed.  “Remind me the next time before I go out.  They are an absolute nuisance to store in one's pocket.”
“Oh, he is often to be found at Bart's,” my friend replied, as he refilled me.  “He does some research in the lab; well, you must know, that sort of thing.  I have a wager with a pal that either one of us might nail him 'fore the year is out.”
.”  She laughed again.  “I hope that we'll have cocktails on arrival, Mr. Watson, do you think we will?”
“We are well matched, then,” I said, provocative, not caring of the fact.  His grey eyes widened just a fraction.  He may have edged slightly away.  He might have spoken, had our driver not drawn up the cab and tapped upon the roof.
I smiled.  “I cannot recall.  You may well be right; you usually are.  Victor will know.  I am anxious to see him again, Holmes.”
That was how I came to learn, then, of the treachery of family and the process of elimination.  For secrets fester when they have no right nor privilege.  I asked only a few questions, and Holmes answered them as best he could.  At length we had no words to speak.  I found myself curled up upon his lap as he sat upright on our sofa.  I fell asleep, and many hours in that position, and he did not move an inch that he disturb me.
So we spoke of Goethe and Dickens, and then of the new restaurant – the 'Steamboat William' – in the Strand, that Gregson found much to his liking, not least the excellence of its wine list.  We made promises to all meet there one evening, their best table set for four.
I collided with the postman on the Friday at ten-thirty, in our joint attempt to access 221B Baker Street, albeit both for our own reasons.  Mrs. Hudson was in evidence, the door already open, and she was smiling as she noticed me, and beckoned that I enter.
He shook his head, as if I must be a slow simpleton indeed.  And it is partway true, of course; I am.  As most men are, if they should be compared with that great brain – its owner now engrossed in some thick volume propped half open, making notes and sighing soft into his coffee cup.
It took some time to find a hansom that was free.  At length, I managed to locate one, huffed myself inside and sat back against the cushions.  I was not relishing the thought of meeting Mr. Holmes again, for he unsettled me.  I pondered this predicament, and put a question to Miss Marsh on my return.
“Since January,” he replied.  He told a tale of how he came to meet the owner, Mrs. Hudson; of some small business with her husband (sadly no longer alive), and how she treated him much as an errant son, in fondly scolding him for messes and mishaps.  I could see the evidence of these: the acid stains upon the table, and the ash upon the rug, and papers, papers, everywhere, and books and scrolls to fair abundance.
He did so, gasping, desperate.  He waited, then.  We might have been a photograph, quite frozen, space and time, but for the heaving of his stomach, and the rising and the falling of my chest.  I tipped the oil onto my fingers, and advanced.  I kissed his mouth, I kissed his throat, I nipped his shoulders, and he moaned.  I scraped his chest with avid teeth, I stroked and probed and placed my fingers where he wanted them.  He shivered, base and absolute.  “
“Oh, for goodness sake, why?  For refusing his case?  How would it make any difference?  I am certainly sorry that he is dead, but there is nothing that can be done to bring him back.  We should focus our attention on the case.  I fear that Lestrade will be tramping all over and destroying the evidence if he can possibly do so.  I suggest we leave now.”
Mr. Flowers looked pained.  “I was just getting to the point,” he said.  “If you might just indulge me.  As I was saying, these past few days have been a trial.  I am a married man, and I have reason to believe that my wife – Florrie, that is her name – is in a, er, well, an er...”
Ten minutes later, I had written some instructions, left some powders and a tall carafe of water, and was back out in the hallway where Sherlock Holmes was standing, hovering.
He looked at me askance, then.  “Whereas you would wish to do the same, but upstairs in our room,” said he, a sharp twinkle in his eye.
“Not even remotely, Dr. Watson,” replied the jester.  “Just a bitter, sad remonstrance.  I am over it now.  I am optimistic that it needn't damage our esteemed association.”
“These country folk are singularly unobservant,” said Sherlock Holmes.  He looked to Victor.  “Are you all right, my boy?”
His hand swept down my back to clasp my backside, and I jolted, moaned, and shivered.  “Give me time,” he whispered, ragged.  “Can you wait?”
according to your mindset, there is a fine morality of sorts.  The deserving always fall.  Those on the side of the greater good should not need to rue their...
“That was my plan all along,” Holmes replied.  “So I am glad you approve.”  He swept out an arm.  “The main difference is that our writing desks are in the library now.  And, of course, the lab has its own separate space.”
And since it was Sherlock’s night for the sofa, he smoothed out the flannel sheets and the winter duvet, crawled in and turned out the light.
Lestrade was already hitting a speed-dial number when Sherlock said, tightly, “Mycroft. You need to call Mycroft.”
But it didn’t happen. Rosie’s version of adolescent angst or rebellion was to spend more time in her room some weeks, and to write us very loving notes to ask us to leave her be. I remember Harry screaming “
But that was a persuasive strategy, not an analytical one. It would be a good argument if I were trying to convince someone else that all was not as it appeared in Sherlock’s death. But I wasn’t. I was trying to find out for myself.
I’d looked up the press coverage of a related (actually, unrelated) case, and it was pretty sensational: an MP, torture, and a delayed discovery of the body made for some juicy details for the media. What was most worrying was the amount of attention the press gave the consultant: photographs, front-page coverage, obsequious hyperbole. A flamboyant, self-serving, headline-hunting amateur was the very last thing I needed, when we were finally
The plans I’d made were eminently undemanding. The following weekend we’d start a driving vacation through the mountainous region to the south of Rome, stopping where we felt like stopping, exploring where we were inspired to explore, eating and sleeping and making love as our appetites dictated. A low-key, low-stakes week, a hiatus from the frenetic pace of work life in Rome, or the intensity and near-frenzy of the weeks preceding our departure from London.
I don’t romanticise a white Christmas, or ice skating, or the gelid gusts that whistle down London’s alleyways. I can endure being trapped in a sub-zero meat freezer for a case, but not being cold for
He’s been working on finding the right way to soothe her with the violin when she’s fretful. He’s tried different keys, intervals, tempi, repetitions, ornaments. Different volumes and bow strokes. He hasn’t made a spreadsheet, but since her reactions change according to time of day and proximity to mealtimes, he might have to start one. Having no cases on, none at all, should be deadly dull, but the great empty walls of his mind are filling up with post-its about Watson, about John. So many changes to track.
, standing there in the dark, holding John’s hand and caressing it. He pulled me down, though, until I was sitting on the coffee table.
“I’m checking.” Seeing him absorbed in his phone I ran back to the street window only to see John walking away down the street, as relaxed as though he’d never been covering a murderer in our flat from the house opposite. I sagged against the window with relief.
—Fuck it, Watson, he tells himself: the problem’s staring you in the face. You beat the man within an inch of his life. Could’ve killed him. If he’s reserved now it’s not because he resents you distrusting him—it’s because he distrusts
The noise level in the room went sky-high as everyone tried to cram an hour’s worth of conversation into the twenty-minute break.
It didn’t seem a good moment to tell him that “both” can’t actually be followed by three objects, so I wisely kept that to myself.
. I had nothing to offer or trade anyway. Whatever I might’ve had to offer, Sherlock had taken away with him.
But so was John’s smile, open and caring and a bit sly. So was his chest, broad and muscled. His shoulder, beautiful despite—because of—the marks of suffering, origin of his return to civilian life (
And I was always, always on the run. As the pursuit heated up, the remnants of the network were working overtime, and they knew that someone was making headway against them. Working alone was a necessary evil, and one that had begun to drive me mad. As a momentary escape, communicating with John again was a godsend. It was the counterpoise to my frenetic, frantic life as a nemesis, a golem. And it was the
Wednesday morning found him online ordering John an air ticket for the following Sunday. It was fine. He’d get used to the chill again.
We were circling around being ready to go home to London, to 221B and to Rosie. Somehow. I didn’t want to face the question of where we were going to live. If Sherlock wanted us with him, I figured he’d let me know in the most unequivocal (well, demanding) way possible, and for my part I felt ready to move us over to Baker Street. But I didn’t want to make that decision for him. It’s no joke to make over your life and your work and your flat to accommodate the needs of an infant.
The five stages of grief, say the experts, are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. They emphasise that these are not static. Sequence may vary, earlier stages resurface again. Grief is messy, they say. Highly individual.
. They yours, or did they come with the place?” John’s voice was carefully neutral, but teasing was sure to come later, by way of revenge. He’d sniped at John’s love poems for his girlfriends often enough.
I knew he’d want his turn but I couldn’t wait, I was too close, I pushed my cock between his thighs, trying to avoid his oversensitised bollocks (shame, I loved their texture against my erection). I pushed the eager head of my cock up to surface between his inner thighs, felt the hot water pulse over it, and pulled back into the delicious pressure as he squeezed his legs.
The party was enjoyable, and having it on a Monday, with Watson at center-stage, meant that there was a natural early end to it. I noticed Molly taking discreet photos with her phone, which was fine; it looked more like a Christmas party than a wedding party. Even the cake was a Christmas cake: a recipe too sweet even for me, though Mycroft’s eyes gleamed when he saw it. We waved the last stragglers off before ten, and poured an exhausted daughter into bed, her dress sadly intact.
Her voice tightened. “Ah, no, they’re not out of school yet, they’re that disappointed, they really wanted to see London. And you two. Between the lockdowns and their school schedule it seems every time we get to England, all three of ’em miss out.”
“I didn’t even have time to text Mycroft,” I said through a mouthful of perfect toast. The honey tasted of England. It was so familiar, yet so long ago. I felt my chest ache.
Sherlock complied, but wrinkled his nose: oh, the remains of dinner. John pushed the coffee table away and turned back to the sofa, nudging Sherlock off his elbows and down. “Trust me?”
Halfway through, the key and the mood change; Cole takes the song in a decidedly jazzy direction, and Sherlock and Sally up their game. Now it's fairly obvious
you can say to justify what you did. I don’t care if you did it to save a thousand lives, to save the whole fucking planet. What you did—what you made me see—what you made me
“I’m so sorry, love. But to be fair. You were the one with the loud self-diagnosis of sociopathy.” I nudge his cheek again, trying to get him to look up. Not working.
Meanwhile I was getting better at this, and was fairly pleased with myself when I found a classic Chuck Berry line for May 13th:
His team was starting a very nervous, tentative search of the kitchen when Sherlock whirled in, flushed and overheated, his hair in a state I’d never seen out of doors, and wearing clothing that didn’t square with any of his usual personas. Or with my hopes of an innocent (read: non-sexual) explanation of his absences. As he whisked past I caught a heady scent of sweat, his own and someone else’s—and I swear to God, a hint of a woman’s perfume.
“Precisely. Idiot.” There it was, Sherlock's beloved grin, making its appearance just in time to suggest he might not’ve bollocksed this up forever.
Rosie’d been to the flat before, several times, but for some reason this arrival brought memories flooding back of Sherlock’s arrival in 2016. I couldn’t have said why; I still can’t.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding, but John is looking up at the inky sky with its scattering of glittering stars. “Look at that, Sherlock!” His expression was so enchanted, so enchanting, that again Sherlock can’t look away.
Later, he reflected that it was the first time since he’d left London that he’d been actively excited about something. Weeks of hopelessness and now, a flutter of excitement. About bees.
The flat was locked, dark, suspiciously tidy. Ominously empty. Sherlock’s violin case lay in its usual place on the bookcase, but nothing else about 221B looked usual. When Mrs Hudson came up and silently handed me an ivory envelope with Sherlock’s handwriting on it, my first thought was that he had gone away again on a mission for the British Government. It felt like some horrible joke.
A tiny wave of relief lapped at the edge of his awareness. John would come. Meanwhile he had to tell Donovan about the dying woman and the call.
Rosie was napping upstairs when Sherlock’s text came and sent adrenaline surging through my bloodstream like molten metal. If he’d ever texted “I need you” before, I couldn’t remember it; I was certain he’d never summoned me and said it wasn’t for a case.
CW: This chapter contains references to Sherlock's suicide and its immediate aftermath as depicted in the series.
I was disconcerted. I’d been trying to make John worry about competition for his role as trusted assistant; whatever he was feeling now, it seemed far more serious than that. He’d certainly never been this unguarded with me before.
Seriously. How did it come about, that Sherlock plays the violin of all things? (Yes, obviously it’s canon.)
As we walked it hit me that I was never going to be able to work in Italy, never. I was hamstrung by the unbending foreignness of my experience, and by the irrelevance of so much of my knowledge. While I was away, after Barts, I’d lived this partial and unsuccessful immersion in enough places that I should have known that transplanting myself to Rome could never work. I wasn’t myself there, not the world’s only consulting detective, and I never could be.
“These feeling will pass, and things will change for the better. You know caring is not an advantage.”
“Hm?” Sherlock turned from gathering a piece of toast and drowning it in marmalade, and looked at him as he took a bite.
We had been walking for twenty five minutes, the late spring sunshine at our backs.  The narrow path that we were on was wide enough for two abreast; our shoulders bumped as we negotiated potholes, the atrophied clumps of grassy mud.  My knapsack bounced, though light enough.  I heard the clink of earthenware, its shoulders bumping with the tin.
I blinked and focused on his face.  “Best not to ask then,” I replied.  I saw him flush a little, frown, consult his notebook, make a scribble with a pencil.  “Are you born of a large family?” I asked, now quite determined to find out just what I could about this beautiful enigma.
I threw down the shirt, stood up, rushed to the door.  I hoped that I might ease through to the sitting-room without alarm, but to my extreme embarrassment Holmes was but three steps away.
My friend had pulled me, dazed, from our new friend and up the path away to grass and field and quiet.    I wrenched myself free of his grip.  “Will you
“Well, you mustn't stand on ceremony,” said Langdale Pike.  “Come in, sit down, and all that.  Ha!”  He rubbed his hands.  “You are looking very dapper.”
“You have a choice,” said he, his cheeks a flush, his lips red-swollen, shocking in their state.  “I can make you come like this, or you can have me here, again, just how you like.”
“I've orders not to let you through,” said she, wringing her hands, upset.  “Oh, doctor, I'm so sorry, but I really can't.”
I took the stairs two at a time.  The door was open at the top, and Sherlock Holmes was standing there, smart as you like, polished and primed.
I'd barely settled with a nightcap when a knock upon the door made me start up.  Could it be him?  (But yet so soon?)
“At least not before giving you a thorough mauling,” I retorted, and I stood up from my chair.  Holmes watched me as I opened our bay window for whatever breeze it might allow.  I inhaled the morning air, so fresh and pleasant.
Mr. Talmadge slapped his great hand upon his knee in indignation, but my friend had burst into a loud guffaw that urged me to join him, and alas, we could not stop.  Our visitor glowered his disapproval until the second we were silent.
, half completed paper puzzles.  Picture postcards tucked between the dusty volumes on the bookshelves.  I was admiring one of these – a still life of fruits and flowers, mixed – when Holmes grasped me by the arm.
After the latest bout of cleaning and renewal, which had annoyed Holmes to his zenith, we sat back to wonder if the torment might be near conclusion.
“Well done,” I said.  I sprawled out to my full length and gazed up full into the sky.  “It is so peaceful.  We should retire to this place, come the day.”  I thought for a moment.  “Your bees would like it too.”
“That was it?  Breakfast?”  His tone raised a half-octave higher.  “You hurt my neck.  I'll be skew-whiff for days now.”  He got up all the same, and stamped across to the table still rubbing his collar.  He snatched the manila envelope.  Observing at the last that it was not addressed to him, he huffed and tossed it hard and high over his shoulder.  He sat down heavily.  “Where are my letters?”
“Was that too much?” I whispered to him.  Good lord, the wriggling!  It took all of the control I had to give him space and room.
I laughed.  I saw that my amusement rather pleased him; perhaps he realised I was not as dry a stick as he had feared.  I thought we might get on quite well.  I found him fascinating – for all his eccentricity – and looked forward with some eagerness for all the days to come in which I might observe the fellow.  I had been invalided home from war quite recently, and was currently much weakened with a slow-healing leg and shoulder wound.  How fortunate I was to have met old Stamford by sheer chance, and to learn of 221B Baker Street, with its light and airy rooms that would be most affordable if sharing with this fellow Holmes, and, well, here we were all settled in and doing very nicely.  I anticipated future days in comfort by the fireside, books and journals spread around me, cultivating this new friendship (how bold to call it so, already!) and becoming reacquainted with civilian life.
The day of the ceremony, then.  Set to commence at two o'clock, I was ready by midday.  As my “plus one”, Mr. Sherlock Holmes was looking dapper in his pinstripe suit.  He fussed around his buttonhole.  He fumbled in his pocket.  He eyed me sideways until my nerves reached fever pitch.
“I see.”  I waited for my new friend to elaborate, but it appeared that he might not.  “How long have you been, er, consulting?”
I followed the lad up a long curving flight of stairs to the first floor, and along a corridor to a far room which I was introduced inside.  My bags were placed inside the door.  I looked around.  A pleasant room, in shades of green, twin-bedded, richly furnished, with the windows looking out to the rear gardens, which stretched out admirably far.
“I like my shanties,” said Mr. Oaks, a half-smile twisting up his face.  “Aye, them were good years on the ship.  I learned to cook and do some housekeep.  It's served me well in later years.”
“Good gracious, Holmes,” I said, my heart to bursting with the joy of it.  I gabbled at Miss Marsh behind her desk, gave her instructions for the morning, and then tugged at my friend's elbow that he follow me upstairs.  Inside my sitting-room, I locked the door and turned to him.
As to what my friend was about to say, I never did find out.  For the bell rang loud below us, then rang again, and thrice for luck.  I groaned.  An early client.  I looked around for pencil and paper in case I might be taking notes.  We waited for the footfall on the stairs up to the landing, and they came, two sets, one firm, one slow.
“More or less,” my friend replied.  “It may not have said exactly that, but I interpreted it as such.  You TOLD me to look it up, Watson,” he said then, accusingly.  “So I don't understand why you're being so stupid.”  He scraped again at both thighs.  “Oh bother and blast it, I really do itch.”
A scuffling; a rusting squeak, which I recognised as the hinges of the full length angled mirror that Holmes kept in a corner of his room.  Whatever was he doing?
In the main hall of the house we wished our young friend a good night, and climbed the stairs to our Blue Room.
He treated me with courtesy, with friendship, fond, affectionate.  Sometimes his way with me was brusque and cold; those days would send me spiralling down into dark despair.  When he was warmer, I would test him; I would touch his hand but lightly, link my arm with his when walking through the city, pat his knee to stress a point in conversation.  All these things, to no avail.  He would respond, but on his own terms; two weeks later I might see him light my cigarette, his grey eyes close to mine, his fingers steady with the match, knuckles to brush my cheek, a half smile on his face.  Then he would draw away, quite nonchalant, to pass some pithy comment on the weather, or the hour, or the complexities of palimpsests.  I craved his mouth, his touch, his body, hot and trembling beside me, folding out as a shy bud into a potent petalled bloom, all slick and sweat and gasp and groan.
Holmes stared at me.  He appeared to have forgotten his cricked neck, for he had ceased his fretful rub.
, and I worried at the notion that he might not want me – after all, a fellow outs himself, that's very well, but it does not always mean the fellow likes
large enough.)  I fretted for a moment, while my stomach curled with glee.  “That's very kind of you.”
My friend shook his head.  I found myself wanting.  Nodding, I watched in emerging dismay as our man in green velvet tipped forward the pot, to pour out a half-cup of a similar hue.
I slipped a knife under the flap, withdrew the sheet, and read the words.  My eyes grew wider.  “Goodness me,” I said aloud.  I took a quick look at my watch: it was mid-afternoon.  I snatched my hat and coat, picked up my bag, and left the office; took a cab north-west which dropped me off at Crawford Street.  I knocked upon the door of number 23, and gazed up at the gleaming new brass plate.
“Six bloody days!” I said.  I kissed him, and we teetered on the rug as if it were a rolling cart out of control.  “Why were you so
My step was light, my heart the more so, as I made my way to work.  Lestrade was thoughtful when I told him of my prospects, as we sat talking in his office.  “It would be a shame to lose you,” he said, rubbing at his chin.  “Good police surgeons, well, you know, they're hard to come by.  Still, it's what you want that's more important.  You've made your mind up, eh?”
“Mr. Holmes!” exclaimed our visitor, staggering three steps into the room.  “My name is Jack Talmadge!  I am a persecuted soul!”
When no answer was immediately forthcoming, I looked across from my paper.  Holmes was still frowning, his eyes fixed to the vague middle distance above my right shoulder.
“Damn Lestrade, and damn it all,” said he, rather more loudly than might be discreet.  “How can he say there are no cases on, when his wretched office is a paper mill?  Ugh.
I fumbled with the key, opened the door, and there was Sherlock Holmes.  I stared at him.  It seemed to irritate him.  “Let me in,” he said again.  His tone was cold.  I stood back slowly, watched him enter and look around with some distaste.  “This is a dump.”
Well, if I told him, he might swallow half his tongue, so I just smiled and changed the subject.  Fresh spring flowers would be lovely for the surgery!
“But worth his weight in silver,” Holmes replied.  “For he can go where I might not, and not appear the least suspicious.  There's odd business at that tannery, and Wiggins and his gang will keep an eye on it.”
“You know you do.  You liked it last year.  You made snow angels out in the yard, and then we played games for gifts, and had the most wonderful lunch.”
“What did you mean back then,” I said, plucking two red-ripe tomatoes from the bowl, “when you asked me if I'd sorted through those papers that you're moving?”
“Absolutely not!” I said.  I dropped the book and turned to stare at him.  “Do you do that very often?”
“I quite understand,” said Holmes, sitting beside her.  “It must have been a most terrible shock.  Was Mr. Talmadge a good employer?”
“Not one single thing,” he said, his mouth turned down in disappointment.  “Not an invoice, nor a letter or a document that bears any relation.  It is most annoying.  But also very interesting.”
I found that I enjoyed preparing lunch for just the two of us.  (Life was a sequence of surprises, small and notable.)  Searching through the pantry, I found the remnants of the meat pie, and the fresh-baked loaf from breakfast.  Some thick-sliced cheese, a few soft pickles, and the tray was piled high.  I presented this to Holmes as a proud parent might their newborn son.
It was to Mrs. Hudson's credit that she made no further comment.  Neither did she exclaim loudly upon the partial undress of Mr. Holmes, who sat so nonchalantly at his mottled desk, a stub pencil scratching at his notebook.  By some fine miracle these past eight years, he had yet to blow us all to smithereens, despite what seemed – upon occasion – as his very best intent to.  Instead, his table bore the brunt of it, stained and woodsore, proudly stoic.
“Yes.  Two.  One was by the gate, and the other was by the window where Aunt Augusta met her guest.  John, you must pay attention.
He was all motion; undulation.  His cries were low-pitched; wanton, needy, and his legs curled up around me, and I felt his heat, his hardness, his desire.
I had no idea what that meant.  It seemed the strangest observation.  I became fascinated by Holmes's hands, his fingers twisting his cloth napkin into some abstract, knotted mangle.  I wanted to take one of those hands in mine.  Desired to hold it, feel its warmth, caress the tip of every finger with my tongue.
Through the crack I spied a tousled mop of blond, a young man fastening his tie, stooping to lace his shoes.  “You hypocrite,” I said.  “Toby, you bloody little hypo--”
One last item on my desk: a small year calendar, now showing the September of the year I set myself up in my practice as a medical professional.  I had returned from war abroad a little earlier in the year of 1881, and spent some time in dawdling, distracted and quite miserable, until an opportunity presented its broad face.  A Dr. Doyle, of Upper Wimpole Street, was selling on his practice, and as I had a little pension-pot and other savings of my own, I took the plunge.  So, here I was, a few months on, starting to wonder if I had made the right decision.  My new patients seemed quite few and far between; perhaps the summer months had found them hale and hearty, every one.  Perhaps, the coming winter might land itself upon my doorstep with a racking cough, a touch of influenza, or a spot of gout.  I sighed, and glanced up to the ticking clock upon the mantel.  It was ten o'clock; too early yet for lunch, but late enough for my first patient – should I even have a chance of one!
The evening weather was glorious, still.  The three of us sauntered, inhaling the sweet scented stock by the sides of the lane.  But of the mysterious lady in black we did not see a sign.
We listened to his boots as they clattered down the stairs and along the hall into the street.  The front door banged.
, and then there's me with these crooked teeth and these old clothes, and ah, I felt embarrassed after so many years.  I drew up the courage today, though.  But what for, eh, what for.”
Post-coital, he is beautiful.  More beautiful than any man has any right to be.  His cheeks high-coloured, hair a muss, a curving smile; the sated wanton on the bed, eyes fixed upon me to my pleasure.  I do so love him.
“Yes,” I said.  I did not move.  I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and his thumb caress the hot skin of my throat, which bobbed and swallowed with desire.
“She was.  Didn't I just tell you so.  Well, after she had done with grabbing my elbow and giving it a shake, do you know what she said?  Of course you don't, because your ears are filled with cotton-wool.  She said
We did retire early – rather needless to say – but it was only to sleep, or do the best that we could.  We lay side by side in the grey of our room, with the last embers of warmth stretching out from the fire.  Somewhere, outside, a dog barked.  The wind rattled at the window.  My friend breathed soft beside me, with the yawning gape of wakefulness set fast upon us both.
“I must have at least one,” he whined.  “Did you even look properly?  Did you drop some?  Is the postman still here?  Can you ask him?”
I scanned the room as if my friend might yet be hiding in a corner.  “I do not know,” I said.  “We're settled in quite well, thank you.  I'm very glad to be here, as your brother is remarkable.”
“Well, I feel anything but,” said he, with the teapot in mid-air and pouring a cupful.  “I pray to heaven we don't have a client while I'm in this state.”
“Well, that's better,” said Holmes.  “I feel like a new man.”  And he angled a smirk.  “If you'll pardon the phrase.”  (Holmes's humour very often confused me.)  We sat together on the sofa as the day faded to dusk.  My friend was buoyant and loquacious, and it filled my heart to hear him talk and joke of his adventure.  “John, when you are well, you
“I had better take on a little watering here myself,” he said, “else it won't look beautiful for long.  Or perhaps Jane might agree to do it, if I ask her very nicely.”
Rusty was sitting outside on the pavement, with his eyes fixed to the door.  Above him, nailed quite crudely to the brick, a small and flaking painted sign.
I looked down sadly at my breakfast, half uneaten.  I might have argued, but I did not.  Within two minutes we were both upon the stair and heading out, our hats clamped down upon our heads to protect us from the damping mist.
.  And so he thinks his spoken word is worth a hundred pounds.  Good gracious me, the greater fool he is.”
And ten o'clock came, and we cut off into pairs, and Mycroft went over the rules, and we were handed a small basket, and then the game began.  An egg hunt.  On a Saturday.  In June.
The young man became serious then for a moment.  He reached over, picked up a letter and held it out towards my friend.
,” Gregson continued, with a broad shrug of his shoulders.  “it's the same in our cheap digs.  It's a bit much to keep asking my Victor to squeal like a strumpet so that no-one suspects.”  A pause.  “He's very good at it, mind you.”
Imagine, if you will:  A white-painted cottage, four-up, four-down, surrounded by farm grounds with arable soil.  Outbuildings for storage and acres for growth.  It all seemed fairly daunting to my mind.
However, for explanations, there were none.  My friend was mute upon the subject, and we sat beside the fire and smoked our pipes, and discussed the inflated price of sugar pigs, and how we might afford them, or should we switch to peanut brittle.
I stripped, with only half the grace; not even that.  We fell upon the bed, and so entwined ourselves: all legs and arms, and cocks, like some cat's cradle gone awry.  I worshipped him; I kissed his skin, and ran my fingertips across him, heard the intake of his breath; I cupped him, stroked him, and with tiny gasps, he curled himself around me.  “What do you need,” he whispered softly.  This lean and tender, featherweighted man; I craved all I could reach of him.  I took him in my mouth; he yipped and yowled, and locked his hands behind my head to better guide me, to teach me slowly what he liked; I taught him something of my own.  He keened and bucked upon the bed.  I licked the tip of him.  “Try not to come,” I said.  I swiped my fingers through his pre-ejaculate.  “I'm going to finger you,” I said.
“This one, by Andy M. Stewart, is dedicated to my brother-in-law Ciaran and my sister Ash. And their terrible offspring, of course.”
But to Sherlock: I’d been sending three months of love songs. To verify that it was indeed him—that was going to take a different kind of song.
The building was full but the silence was impressive, as everyone concentrated on adapting their vision to the darkness inside. A perfect opportunity for a murder, I thought. I said as much to Roberto, but I could feel and hear that he was not amused. John would have understood. He would have smiled, looked down at the ground, and been unable to suppress a giggle. He never could.
It took me all of ten minutes online to get us plane tickets from London Stansted (sigh) to Bologna, and another seven on the phone to reserve us a room—because it had to be
In the months after Sherlock nearly crashed and burned, trying to bring me back to life after Mary died, we were carefully rebuilding a friendship that neither of us was sure would survive. Between grief and shame and remorse and desire I hardly knew how to talk to him, how to be around him.
We were both panting and hard by the time I stepped back, catching my breath and trying to compose myself.
As I talk I’m caressing John’s hand, his wrist, his fingers, trying not to kiss him. What’s needed now is words, and in the past year we’ve gotten noticeably better at taking as long as necessary to be explicit with each other. Still, I’d rather be showing him than telling him. Now he carries my hand up to his face and holds it against his cheek for a moment before he says,
I didn’t want to get out of bed at all, but I also felt slick and repulsive. Shower it was, and then back into bed to show John everything I’d not yet found the words to say. Someday I might.
Well. That might not be fair. The one time I’d answered his call, I’d bellowed at him for ten minutes straight. Choking back pain, I had given vent to rage.
“My plan was fairly chancy, but if Miletić did secure a meeting and it went well, then I was going to need some help getting out of there alive with Moran. So I scheduled yesterday’s ‘Help’ message. After all, if the network was having you followed, they must have suspected I was alive. That put you at risk, too, and the whole point of keeping us apart disappeared.”
She went into Rosedale with Sherlock, since I had no wish for her to see me weepy. I also had no wish to see Stalker-teacher; I knew Sherlock had got Rosie into the class of the “quite impressive” teacher he’d met at the Open Day. He whisked me home after, demanding that we make best use of our suddenly free morning, reminding me of what we’d done with the rest of our similarly unencumbered hours in Bologna back in April. I swear he was deliberately distracting me, and as always, he was spectacular at that.
I have to travel, and perform, and record, and he’d always known I’d fall for somebody else, somebody interesting, somebody
She politely refrained from rolling her eyes, but was mollified by my quick apology and apparently by my Italian, which was getting more convincing by the day.
Bless her, she truly was a saint at times. But I could feel joy coming over my face when I said, “Next: I have good news.”
“Obvious. We barely fit on the old one.” Indeed, the new sofa was not only longer but deeper, with dark green velour upholstery that would be a welcome change from the leather that I always found sticky in summer and chilly in winter.
“Regrets. The ... nothing, just, regrets.” I am trying to learn candour, but honesty may not always be the best policy.
And that wasn’t even true: you’ve always been a complete human being. (The best and the wisest man I’ve ever known, even when you’re a complete dick and a madman.)
“Why—not good?” He doesn’t look or sound worried, but the little wrinkle between his brows gives him away.
I push it away, being able to touch John can never become commonplace, and anyway I’ve been neglecting him horribly, he must be at least as desperate as I was. I reach for him with more conscious intent only to find that he can, apparently, multitask: he too is slick and softening, and apparently too sensitive to take any more stimulation. He shifts and mutters, “No, wait, just for a minute,” and I’m hoping I haven’t ruined everything by being so selfish a lover on our very first night.
Sherlock looked at John, only to see him staring back with clear concern in his expression. He reached for a tone of calm control.
But instead of resolving the anomalies I’d started with, my investigation had turned up new ones. An apparent purge of Barts Accident and Casualty employees in the month after Sherlock’s death. No police report, then an incomplete one hurried into existence and into the records. No post mortem, an inquest that had never been reported. And all the rest of it.
He looked grave and said, “You do realise that if you’re right, and she’s been put there on purpose, that represents a substantial investment of resources by the organisation Sherlock has been combating all this while. They must be almost certain he’s alive, if they’ve have placed a spy at your elbow. I will indeed look into her, and inform you when I learn anything.”
“There are none for you this morning, Mr. Holmes,” said Mrs. Hudson.  The lady had the good sense to begin her slow retreat back out onto the landing.
“May I call you John?” he asked, tapping his fingers on the table in a fidget.  “That is, if you don't mind?”
The afternoon proceeded slowly.  At five o'clock, I wended home to bathe and change.  I felt a rumble of excitement in my stomach, so familiar, and fierce.  I took a cab to Baker Street.  I heard the bell ring through the house, and the quick footsteps of the landlady.
What, then, within this room to throw my light upon?  The old sideboard, with the used breakfast tray upon it.  The table, laid in white, and strewn with newspapers and crumbs.  The sofa, chairs, and writing desks, the latter bare; all bare, the papers, pens and books, all packed away.  In the middle of the room: several large boxes, tied and bound.
, it proclaimed, proudly, in its first column.  I began to read through the short article.  The word reappeared a further dozen times.
(And how to compare this against the arch gentleman who emerges sprightly the next morning, once more the alpha and the dominant of we two.  And I am amused and oft bemused in equal measure.)
“Then we shall not place a foot in your way,” said my friend.  “Our best wishes for your future, Mr. Bruce.”
I eased myself out of his body, and watched him hoist his underwear.  “I shall be sore,” he said, with more than some degree of satisfaction.
I waited, still on tenterhooks.  The smell of rotting offal assailed my nostrils and made me blench.  Bluebottles buzzed a Symphony in D.  I wished my friend might hurry up.
The sun was deeper in the sky by the hour the Surrey train pulled in.  We hired a hansom for the short ride, and so stepped down into Augusta Burroughs' lane a little after five-thirty.
“I regret to inform you that Mrs. Augusta Burroughs is dead,” Sherlock Holmes replied.  “And it is, in fact, my business, as I was instructed by the family to make enquiries.  It was I who sent the telegram.”
“I don't care about beastly breakfast,” he replied.  “I'm hot, and I'm cross, and I've just had a row.”
“Very probably a kitchen knife.  Of course, the lady cannot remember this, and Stone would not have known.  A bread knife would well suit the close description of the wounds.  So, where then did it all stand?  Talmadge was dead.  Mrs. Barker was working with her false memories as best she could.  Dawkins had the skull.  What then for Stone?  And here was his cunning.  Stone did not wish to be implicated with the skull's ownership if anything should happen to go wrong – for example, if Mrs. Barker remembered fragments of what happened on that night.  With no skull in his possession, Stone thought himself clear of firm accusal.  Mr. Dawkins was quite unaware of the scale of deceit, by the way, Watson.  It appears that Stone was working on a plan that would allow him greater profit from the skull when the dust had settled from the murder.  A closer involvement with the 'tour', a greater persuasion over Dawkins in some direction, who's to say?”
I reacted quickly in defence, but Holmes was swifter; he grasped the wrists of the troubled man, and held him firm.  The fellow stood now, trembling, cowered, and deflated.
In order to push Langdale Pike from my mind, I mused on the events as they had developed in Surrey.  The burned note in the fireplace... the cigarette stubs... the talented gardener and the lady in black – who may or may not be the one and the same.  What good could my friend do in London, I wondered, when he was so far from the house and its circling storm?
We stared into each other's eyes, and bucked a little, stubborn, mulish.  I pushed my body into his; he whined, a high-pitched keen.  “Just lock the door,” he gasped.  “Before... you know.”
He fell to his side and turned his attention from Lestrade on the other end of the phone, to an unconscious Sherlock. He pressed his finger tips to his neck and felt a very faint pulse underneath the skin.
“No, um.. I don’t think it’s alright…” He motioned to the back of him and John took the hint to look down. His eyes quickly focused on the kink that was set in the man’s tail, and could not have been easy to deal with the pain it caused from being obviously broken. No matter how much the man put up a front, he couldn't possibly keep that up for much longer
Victor could not help the small smile that graced his face when he watched Sherlock looked so happy at just saying a man’s name. As much as it pained him, he decided to indulge his friend just to see that smile that was so often hidden from everyone.
“So.. I hit you in my sleep? It’s hardly crazy, John. It’s just muscle spasms brought on by the fact that I hadn’t entered the REM stage.”
John’s hands moved on their own accord to swiftly undo Sherlock’s own breeches, slipping them off his hips before they were kicked away into a darkened corner of the room to be forgotten. Sherlock pulled the two of them together to escape the lack of heat in the room, he soon slipped his head into John’s neck to press gentle kisses to his skin when he felt John lift him from the table and to his small bed.
“They say that one should never mix the grape with the grain,” he said – unsympathetically, I thought.
My friend exhaled; he dropped his head.  “So Mycroft really stooped that low.”  He undid the cuff of his left sleeve and rolled it up, to reveal a forearm scarred with puncture-marks.  “I do.  Not all the time.  Occasionally.  A seven-per-cent solution of cocaine.”  He searched my face.  “You are disgusted with me now.”
“On the sideboard,” I replied.  “And there is not so much of it.  Two letters and an invoice, as best I can tell.”
“I'd be prepared to take that risk,” I said, my heart beating aloud, my every nerve alive, in ferment.
“Holmes,” I said, guilty now, “I do not think we handled that at all well.  The fellow does seem to believe in the crystal skull legend.  I have read a little of it myself, and I would say that--”
I blinked slowly and considered.  “I don't think so,” I replied.  “We had quite enough to do.  If there was no cause to refer to them while still at Baker Street, then I suppose I felt no need once we were here.  Why do you ask?”
“Aye, that's right.  The word came through late this morning, 'fore I left off.  God knows who found it out.  One of the constables on an early plod, no doubt.”
By eight-thirty, I was ready, with my bags all packed to go.  I sat with Holmes upon the bed, and watched him fiddle with his cuffs.  He was sombre, and it worried me.  “Is everything all right?”
I pointed to the bookshelf.  “You have been searching those medical texts for the past hour and a half.  They are evidently of no use.”  I smiled.  “Have you forgotten that I am a doctor?”
We settled ourselves as the train pulled out slowly.  We were just three inside our carriage, and just as well, for so many bags and jackets, hats and sticks.  Gregson lolled back in his seat and fixed us with a lazy smile.
“I love the freedom that we have,” I said, as if the thought had only just occurred.  “I can kiss you here, or there, or grab you round-a-bouts--”  (and here Holmes began to laugh) “--and there is no-one to intrude, or see, or otherwise.  It's heaven.”
... however, I am the oddest bird, so there are certain facts about me that I am sure you would not wish to know.”  He smiled.  “Oh, you're frowning again.  It's all right.  I haven't
I ignored him.  “Why did you pretend to be a customer?” I asked.  “And why did you not ask him any questions about Mrs. Barker or Talmadge?”
Billy, fully grown, no longer dropping all his aitches, no longer sniffing on his sleeve, or cracking our best crockery.
” said he.  “I am most sorry for my trespass.  I have offended in some way?”  His eyes were now straying behind me to Sherlock Holmes, who had now reached us and was standing with arms folded, a wry expression on his face.
Our twin beds: conjoined and inviting.  The proximity of my friend, with the shadows from the lamp casting behind him onto blue, was most affecting.
My friend nodded, becoming thoughtful.  Taking out a small black leatherbound from one of his pockets, he proceeded to read, turning sliver-thin pages at unimaginable speed.  I could not make out the short title, the gold emboss being so fine, but I tarried a minute in my squint.  And as brick and cobble gave way to green, I turned to gaze out through the window and amuse myself by counting cows.
It was early one Wednesday morning when the envelope arrived.  Mrs. Hudson brought it up the stairs, balanced on the breakfast tray, alongside the cups and saucers.  Laborious, the climb was, too, for I heard her mutter not quite
.  I am so incredibly, terribly sorry.  We should never have gone to Franton.  I should never have allowed curiosity to get the better of me.”
My friend considered.  “A bottle of ink, and a half-sheet of stamps.  And a bag of those biscuits we like.  You know, the ones with the fig.  Don't forget.”
, in hopes of some amusing article to read.  I scratched my head.  And scratched again.  The itch did not abate.  A fresh itch sprang up in another spot, behind an ear.  I scratched.
I stared, fascinated, as he dropped his toast and clawed with both his hands beneath the tablecloth.
Those precious words, as clear as from yesterday; and each and every one we uttered, stuttered inside that tiny room, and revealing for the first time:
was a small bay-fronted restaurant, not far away.  A board outside the front displayed the 'Special' of the day, a roast beef platter, and inside, a quiet bustle, starched white tablecloths and polished wood, and booths adorned with vines, and smiling waiters who did welcome us and guide us to our place.  We took our seats inside a booth quite far away from everyone.  Holmes ordered wine; we watched the world outside for barely a small fraction, then:
I moved towards him, and he scrambled up.  He pulled me down, and launched himself on top of me.  “If you don't take me soon,” he said, “I'm going to erupt.”  He started laughing as he squeezed me at the ribs.  “John, you are
Upon my word, he was well-favoured, though.  His eyes were grey and piercing and deep-set; his brows were thick, his nose was hawk-like, and his chin had both a prominence and squareness.  All this, set to a fresh-faced youthful air, for he was but a few years younger than myself, in his mid-20s, I should say, with sleek black hair swept back.  His dress was prim and scrupulous.  I admired him, therefore, and wondered what he made of me.
“Yeah, great. Things are really ... good. Rosie’s a very easy baby, everyone tells me, I wouldn’t know. But it’s good.” Greg had kids, he wouldn’t need every little detail.
“Because this is where we came together. Where we told each other everything. Made love. Made promises. And if you’re going to leave me, this is where you’re going to do it. In this city. In this bed.”
He hummed an emphatic affirmative. “I’d have gone mad without it. I knew that the first morning. So Roberto sent me to an instrument maker who loaned me a very fine violin, from 1700 or so. I played so much I got decent calluses back, and I played music I didn’t, couldn’t, associate with you.”
There they are now, John and Watson, whispering on the sofa while I play the unfamiliar Christmas songs that haven’t been rubbed thin by overexposure, at least not in the U.K.
He moved in close enough for Sherlock to feel that his pulse was still elevated, which was ... stimulating.
It was refreshing to be admired by someone who didn’t repulse him. It was certainly flattering to be admired with—respectful discretion?—by someone it turns out he’d a lot in common with. Zanardi had the advantage of Sherlock’s long-standing affection, confirmed during the Hiatus, for Italy. For Italian, and for Italian standards of beauty. In addition, Zanardi was far more intelligent than the average person Sherlock met, in any profession. And he turned up quite regularly, fitting comfortably into consultations with Lestrade, which eventually became consultations one-on-one with Sherlock.
“You’ve picked the wrong woman, you know. This one could take you down with one hand tied behind her back. But then, you knew that, so you made sure to tie both her hands and one foot—probably the only way you can overpower anyone. Coward.”
thought him unattainable, and I did love him, want him, past telling. We never knew, either of us. This was pitiable and laughable at the same time. My years of pining were mirrored by years of pining on his part. Pointless, needless pain.
“We already showered,” he pretended to object, but he was shivering with delight as I drew my fingers up his sides and reached for his nipples.
They aren't things I can tell you, not in words. I can barely tell this journal. You'll just have to understand it all from the conducted light.
John’s behind him, very close now, and Sherlock turns back to see him in the deep-sea light of the hall, and he knows: this is where it has to happen. Here, where it should have happened years ago, their first night.
He refused to admit that he’d already walked away. Refused even to shake my hand. On the anniversary of the day I met him, he turned and left the flat without a word. I knew then that it was all over, once and for all, no matter what happened with Roberto.
He’d had a preconceived notion of what Sherlock’s editor would look like, based on his Oxbridge post and his triple-barreled name and the posh accent heard once on the phone. Reedy, tweedy, and—no, nothing apposite rhymed. (Needy? Hadn’t sounded that way.) Anyway. Definitely a skinny frame, eyeglasses (thick lenses), a butter-smooth leather briefcase that probably cost a month’s salary.
I couldn’t afford to get stiff or clumsy or distracted, so I changed positions often: I sat, stood, crouched, even stretched out on the floor for a few minutes.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
I didn’t know whether Will Simpson recognised Sherlock’s voice from inside his hiding place, but then I wasn’t sure I recognised it either: careful, and reassuring, and so kind. This wasn’t the triumphant, imperious tone I’d so often heard at the end of a draining case successfully solved.
“This is me touching you. This is me grateful you’re alive. This is me, furious that you’re scarred” (as he touched the divot in Sherlock’s sternum). “This is me, loving you. Is that alright?”
After the first Met Gala fundraiser-cum-matchmaker, Sally has a plan to woo her crush at the second one.
Eight months on, he’d wintered in the cottage (more of a cabin really); made music with a score of top-flight musicians, and dozens more promising amateurs like himself; and made himself indispensable with the bees. He had acquaintances in the village, fans in the town. They did not know him at all.
John takes advantage of the crowd’s focus on them to make his way quickly to the bidding table. He reads through the list of songs upcoming, chooses one he thinks is slow enough for him to manage, and bids the maximum for “The Very Thought of You.”
That was it, then. It wasn’t the technique or the muscle memory or the musical style Sherlock was afraid he’d lost. John smiled and reached out, touched a tense shoulder and said neutrally, “You know they won’t be disappointed with London Will.”
The next morning he was on an early coach to Liverpool, where he’d get a ferry to Dublin. Another coach to Killarney, and from there he’d hitchhike as far as he could. He was almost grateful he couldn’t afford faster travel: he had a lot to think through in the hours it would take to get to the arse-end of County Kerry.
“Oh. I just bid on you for a song I thought you’d like, one I might just about manage without embarrassing myself. Or you. I don’t know if it’s mixed-couple—it’s all the same to me. I’m still going to be the envy of the whole room. You’ll be very busy, you know.” John says this airily, but a thread of jealousy runs through the timbre.
Probably he’d started dating again, and wasn’t mentioning it. That was it: he’d met someone he liked, someone who might see Watson as an attraction rather than a liability. As Sherlock did himself, of course, but John was in the market for anyone but him. Perhaps if Sherlock too were to date, and achieve that elusive completion, he might become eligible.
“You’re interested in art thefts?” She spoke to us both, in excellent English and with an accent both slight and crisp.
And he had. He had. He was there, waiting. He followed me into the kitchen and watched while I put the shopping down with studied calm; concealing my nerves, I started to put things away. But when I caught a glimpse of him, troubled and tense, my heart twisted and I said, “Get over here.”
An apple tart and custard, then, with a coffee pot to follow on, and brandy too.  And then we sat, replete, somehow reluctant to move anywhere but where we were, inside our booth, secluded and so intimate together.
That led us to the sitting-room, brandy glasses by our side.  I lit a cigarette and sucked at it, all nerves, goodness knows why.  I tossed the bundle on the table; it made a deadened, heavy sound, and startled both of us, I think.
The music had stopped.  I strained my ears, for I seemed to hear an advancing foot tread on the stair.
“They each reside in a far corner of London,” said he, huffing.  “Hence why it is now past three o'clock, blast it.  I have been racing around tracking each of them down.  An absolute waste of time, might I add.  Two of the fellows are abroad on separate business, their wives informed me.  The third is a wheelchair-bound octogenarian.  The fourth gentleman was run down by a carriage last week, and is in the infirmary with two broken legs.”
“Well done, Watson,” he said dryly.  “You truly scintillate.”  He took a long pull from his cigarette.  “His name is
I trusted that my face revealed no sign of the excitement that was now roiling from within me.  Inwardly, I also shook my head at how ridiculous I was.  A farther corner of my mind had just embarked on a small raft of minor panic sailing into a dark haze of consternation.  And thus, the state that I was in progressed throughout the day, once more left quite alone as Holmes departed for “the Yard” to see a fellow named “Lestrade”, a rhyming couplet like no other.  I napped mid-afternoon, and woke just as my friend returned.  We shared a pot of tea and the newspapers, then I excused myself.  I went up to my room and sorted through my clothes to wear.  I selected a new suit I had not worn before; I polished up my boots; I trimmed my moustache, picked my cufflinks (silver amethyst), and sat down on a chair to ponder.  By seven-thirty I was dressed, and so descended to the sitting-room to see where Holmes was at.
“Aer-o-dy-nam-ic,” he repeated, stretching out each syllable as if the word was entirely new to him and he was not sure of the taste of it.  “Watson?  Elaborate, please.”
The early Friday morn saw me awake and in a tussle with my thoughts, for I do so loathe unpleasant dreams.  I threw myself onto my side and found myself within the same space as my friend.  He – rather astonishingly, given my restless state – was fast asleep, his breathing deep and calm.  One bare shoulder and the top half of his chest above the sheet, for of course, it being summer – and being us – there was no need for the full regalia of nightshirt or all the rest of it.  The air was thick despite our window being open a part way.
Holmes crossed the sitting-room, all flailing arms and shedding waistcoats as he shucked down to his shirt sleeves.  “Phew!” said he.  “Oh, phew!  That is much better.”  He sat beside me on the sill and lit a cigarette.
“How lovely!” I said, stupidly.  I listened as he told me of the detail, and I made small interjections to be helpful.  And if I moved a fraction closer to the fellow, it was pure accident; and if my eye caught his and lingered, then I blamed it on his narrative: so very
,” I continued, averting my discomfort, “the great British public – and perhaps those beyond our fair isle – shall know a great deal about you.  Whatever medium is popular at that time, even beyond the theatre –  imagine! – will perhaps take you for their inspiration.”
I rolled over and against him, threaded my fingers in his waistcoat.  He smelled of pollen and of pickles, quite the heady combination.  I brushed the yellow flecks away.
“Like Adams and young Dooley,” said my friend.  He sniffed, and stood.  “Oh well, come on, or we'll be late for eggs on toast.”
It emerged that Wiggins was a scruffworn urchin, wild straw hair, and boots a sight too large for him.  He greeted Holmes with pleasure, and the two talked for some minutes, where I caught the gist that Wiggins and some pals of his were needed to stake out a local tannery.  Terms and promises agreed, the ragamuffin made a sharp salute to both of us, and headed down the street, off on his way to racing marbles, I supposed.
“Anyway,” I continued, by now warming to my theme, “you are a fine one to be talking of peculiar.  You, with your tobacco stuffed in the toe of an old slipper!  And you, who has made a pretty mess already of the mantelpiece, stabbing at your letters with a jack-knife!  And you, who--”
