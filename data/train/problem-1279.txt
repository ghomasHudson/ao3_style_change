It’s a moment before Sherlock speaks. He scans over John’s face, noting the soft crinkle around the corners of his eyes, the warmth behind the gloat, the adoration that’s unmistakable. He leans close, drawing John near with the look in his eye, his voice just a murmur, a mere breath against John’s lips. “I don’t mind being wrong if it means I have you by my side. If... it means I can kiss you.”
“For those texts,” John says. “When you messaged, asking how I was… I don’t know. That had been a really difficult day. Dad’s health had been looking good the past couple days, but then it took a turn for the worst… We’d just gotten to the hospital when your text came through, and uh, I just… I just couldn’t get a handle on my emotions. I didn’t mean to take it out on you. Well, not all of it. You deserved it a bit.”
It’s said so casually, with such nonchalance, that John is certain Sherlock is messing with him. Surely he’s joking, right? But one look at his flatmate tells him it’s the truth. He takes a moment to collect his thoughts, putting the phone in the inner console. “Are... are you sure?”
“Waiting for you.” Sherlock sounds as though he’s stating the obvious, which John supposes it would be for him.
They kindly decline her offer, and she takes a seat opposite John, her hands clasped in front of her to still the tremor running down her arm.
Sherlock scoffs. “What would give you that idea? Surely not the size of the victim. And you know how much I despise that word,
“Yes,” Sherlock answers, pulling out one of the many police badges he’s taken from Lestrade over the years, flashing it briefly in front of his face. “I’m Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and this is my colleague John Watson. We’re looking for a Thomas Richards. Does he live here?”
There is one thought, however, lingering to the side, threatening to pop out of hiding if Sherlock pays it so much as an iota of attention; one that Sherlock smothers whenever it rears it’s head. It’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Sherlock’s poised, tense,
“Damn you, Lestrade.” Sherlock hurls the words out into the apartment, illogically praying they’d reach the Detective Inspector in Scotland Yard. He had been
Lestrade hurries to grab his takeaway cup, chasing to catch up to Sherlock. “We’ve already questioned them all, Sherlock. Got everything we need to know.” He even adds a smile for good measure, though he instantly regrets it when Sherlock stops on the spot and stares blankly at him.
John shakes his head, a solemn look on his face as he recalls the images. He scrawls his number onto a blank piece of paper and hands it to Ethan. “If your father remembers anything else, anything at all, you can reach me on that number.”
Sherlock briefly considers driving to the hospital to demand brain scans, but quickly brushes the idea aside. He’s just being absurd. It was simply a momentary mind blank. He’s fine… If John happens to question him, he can simply feign having gone to his mind palace.
“Ethan’s mum, Dorothy,” he says, gesturing behind him to his son. “We met in ‘63, were married a year later, until she, God rest her soul, killed herself when Ethan was 8. It’s jus’ been the two of us since then.”
“It’s so lovely to hear the sound of music in this flat again,” she comments, her hand coming to rest against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock adds another tally to his mental list of times Mrs Hudson has made that remark in the past two days (this instance makes six), and then as if she’s trying to add salt to his wounds, she adds, “It’s such a nice change from all that dreadful silence.”
“That body we found? We found out who she is. Name’s Edythe Carter, she’s aged 79, but get this.” Lestrade pauses for dramatic effect and if Sherlock’s not mistaken, he sounds a little mystified. “She died 52 years ago.”
“Even though it took you, what was it? Five days to notice?” There’s an easy tone to his voice, the wine easing any unresolved tension. “I almost want to be offended that it took you that long, but it’s not all that surprising, to be honest.”
Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s, lingering on him for longer than either would deem necessary. For those brief twenty seconds—brief in the grand scheme of things, of life, John would argue—time seemed to slow. Background noise washed away, the quiet lull of their stilted breathing and their quickening heartbeats taking over. John’s thoughts are replaced with nothing but
“Well, if you’re sure… I’ve noticed you’ve been favouring your left leg quite heavily,” Sherlock mentions, drawing John’s attention towards where Ethan had absentmindedly lifted the pant sleeve to scratch at his right shin, revealing a small, slowly healing wound above the ankle. “Nasty injury you’ve got there, Ethan. Looks like you’ve been kicked by, say, the pointed heel of a wedding shoe.”
John coughs to draw his attention to a solitary white heeled shoe peeking out from under a pile—a perfect match to the one found on Edythe’s body. Sherlock slips his phone from his pocket and snaps a photo.
Ethan gives his father’s shoulder a squeeze, his eyes downcast for a moment, before they find the clock on the wall. “Time for your afternoon pills.”
“Yeah, that’s one way to put it…” Lestrade trails off in a way that irritates Sherlock immensely, the reception crackling slightly through the phone due to the heavy rain currently covering London.
It’s odd, John finds, to be back in his childhood bedroom. Everything was still the way it had been throughout his teenage years, jarring him upon his arrival. He’d stood in the doorway, unable to enter as his childhood flashed through his mind. It was as though he’d been forcibly thrown back into adolescence: into the awkward body of a teen struggling with his sexuality. He hadn’t expected his parents to leave his room untouched after all these years, with the bedspread the same dark blue he remembers curling into after petty arguments with his father. Even his clothes were still hidden away where he’d left them all those years ago.
A few moments of silence pass before John speaks again, facing Sherlock with a raised eyebrow. “So? Where are we going? What are we doing?”
sending inklings of joy through his bloodstream. He pulls into traffic, maybe breaking a couple of speed limits as he drives to John’s parents’. (He makes a mental note to send Mycroft a text should any speeding fines occur.)
The countryside rolls by, Sherlock practically on autopilot as his mind flashes moment upon moment of John. John laughing, smiling, grinning in response to someone—all the times John gazed or glanced or outright stared at Sherlock when he thought he couldn’t see him. Memories of John flash by, increasing in speed as his mind races.
She fixes John with one last glare before her eyes flitter to Sherlock, an almost curious look to them, before she’s swiftly moving towards the door.
“You were eight when she died, right? You remember their fights, don’t you? Screaming matches that resulted in the police being called numerous times. Don’t you think that if your father is capable of kidnapping a woman he abused decades ago, that he would be capable of killing your mother?”
, John thinks, running his hand over the leather seat, noting the vehicle’s cleanliness and the way it exudes an obvious air of luxury. “And he just let you borrow it?”
The device vibrates in his hand and Sherlock feels a strange, warm sensation begin to swell in his chest. The warmth turns to a chill, however, when the words
“You were still in shock, faced with the most horrible situation any parent could find themselves in. You can’t blame yourself.” John lets the moment settle before shifting the conversation. “I think that given all you’ve just gone through, it’d be best if we stopped, gave you time to rest and adjust. Do you have anyone we can call for you? A friend, a family member? I don’t think it’s best for you to be alone after learning all this.”
Before Sherlock could even open his mouth to say hello, he was greeted with the words, “There’s been a dead body found at the airport in an, uh...
The sight of John standing there, waiting for him already, accelerates his heart rate. Then his eyes slide over his body and he takes note of his rigid form, the way he’s holding himself: straight back, eyes straight ahead, hands partially clenched by his side. His duffel bag rests at his feet and is the final piece for Sherlock to know that something’s different, that something happened in the 14 hours since they parted. And it can’t be anything good.
John’s laugh in response startles Sherlock—he finds it peculiar given the heated situation from just moments prior, especially when John flips the question around on him. “Are you?”
Once his father is seated, Ethan faces the two, spying Sherlock’s curious gaze as it flitters about the room. “We’re in the middle of sorting through his stuff,” he explains. “He was diagnosed with dementia a few years back, but these past few months have just gotten really bad… He’s really struggling, even with me basically living here again to help him. We’re moving him into a care facility so most of his stuff’s going to charity.”
Ethan shrugs with shoulders filled with tension, turning to the sink and filling one of the glasses with water to sip at. The slight shake in his hand jostles the water, and he sets the glass on the basin, crossing his arms instead. “Must’ve read it in the paper or something.”
, Sherlock hurries to correct himself—was a little more difficult to place. John was standing there, last glimmers of sun shining around him, and he’d intended to say something. What it was, though, Sherlock cannot recall.
, that Sherlock’s eyes drift to his lips for just the briefest of seconds before darting up and away, the softest red dusting his cheeks.
reasoning—behind coming to see John, but then the front door swings open and out steps a bewildered John. Sherlock exits the vehicle, taking one, two, three steps towards John, the other instinctively closing the rest of the distance. A mere metre lies between them and it’s almost too much.
, but what exactly, he isn’t even sure. (Wanting to bottle the sound of John’s voice so he never has to endure another eleven days without hearing it? Wanting to be back in their flat, mindless noise coming from the TV as they sit, where they’re okay because they’re together again? Wanting to draw him into a kiss that conveys all he regrets never telling him? (That last one might be the winner.))
John glances up at Sherlock, then looks back to Helen, to the pale of her face, the shake of hands, of her whole body. He squeezes her hand to draw her attention. “Can I get you anything? A glass of water?”
“I kind of wanted to hear your thoughts. I’m very impressed with your deductive skills back there, the whole piecing together about Agatha and it being her body they discovered.” John opens his mouth and Sherlock rushes to add, “I– I don’t mean that in a condescending way. I just meant that I do value your input and your involvement and–”
But how can John even think about the pull of exhilaration that gunfire still holds over him? He’s supposed to be completely and utterly focused on helping his father recover. And of course the thought of gunfire draws his thoughts elsewhere, longing for home, for Sherlock overtaking him.
“Helen,” Sherlock broaches cautiously, like approaching a wounded animal. “I’ve noticed your gaze keeps going back to the photo of your husband, William. You don’t have to hide behind him anymore, to be scared of his controlling ways. Whatever it is, you can tell us. We just want to find out what happened to your daughter, to Edythe, and we can’t do that without you.”
John’s body is stiff with anticipation, ready to let adrenaline fuel his body should a chase give way. He glances at Sherlock, who gives a subtle shake of his head, and he flexes his hands, shaking out the tension. “No, uh, I think we got everything we needed, anyway. It was mainly to see if your father had any clues that could help us work out what happened to her.”
Sherlock takes the moment to glance about the room, the sight of John catching him, and he pauses. The last few glimmers of sunlight streaming in through the open curtains illuminates the concerned yet concentrated look on his face, highlighting the few greys littered about his hair. It strikes him suddenly, the longing he’d experienced in John’s absence increasing tenfold, threatening to weigh him down. He tries to deflect it, force it to the back of his mind, in order to listen as Thomas recounts that fateful morning.
Ethan’s shoulders tense, the veins in his neck becoming more prominent as anger overflows. “My father was heartbroken after he thought she died. She caused him so much pain, and now she’s telling all these lies about him? I… She couldn’t be allowed to marry him!”
Lestrade’s referring to the fact that without Sherlock’s assistance, Scotland Yard wouldn’t be as exceptional as they appear to his superiors and the public eye, but Sherlock takes the response at face value. “I’m always right.”
Helen’s quiet; still hasn’t moved except for the rise and fall of her chest, for almost long enough that even Sherlock feels concern begin to rise. She lets out a shaky exhale, and when she speaks, her voice is hushed, practically a mutter to herself.
“No, don’t you worry. We’re just going to talk to him, see what he knows. He’s one of the only leads we have, aside from the mother, but my money’s on Thomas.”
Her gasp in response rings out throughout the room and a stricken expression falls over Helen’s face. Her hands tremble for a brief moment before stilling as a distant look settles into her features.
“Kids?” Sherlock turns to John, his eyebrows furrowed, disbelief clouding his features and filling his voice. “We’re very clearly adults. The man commits murder, twice, and he isn’t even able to classify us as the right age.”
He cannot for the life of him comprehend why his mind continues to remain fixated on John when he’s finally been presented with a case as extraordinary as this. How often would he encounter a woman who was supposed to have been dead for 52 years, only to turn up in a suitcase days after her death. He supposes there’s an exact percentage, but he finds his thoughts drifting back to John before he can calculate it.
“I really don’t see what the issue is. I mean, obviously I’m aware it’s technically not legal, but I
“So you approached her and what? Kidnapped her?” Sherlock spies Ethan’s jaw tensing, the simmering rage hiding behind his piercing stare. “Ah, but it wasn’t your idea.”
“No,” Lestrade coughed as he rose, “but we’ve got the lab running DNA so we should know something soon.”
John starts for the door, but Sherlock reaches into the box of photographs, holding up the golden frame featuring Edythe and Thomas in an embrace. “Do you mind if we take this? It’d be good to have a nice photo for the report.”
“Sherlock?” John’s eyebrows furrow at the unexpected sight of Sherlock, his gaze darting between the man before him and the house. The presence of Sherlock makes the familiarity of his childhood home suddenly feel empty and it almost overwhelms him. “What in the bloody hell are you doing here? Who’s car is that?”
The sound of the front door opening echoes throughout the house, cutting through the tension as the slightly unsteady steps of Thomas can be heard as he draws closer. He freezes in place upon entering the kitchen, the sight of his son holding John hostage sobering him. “Ethan? What… What are you doing?”
“Right...” The information flurries about John’s head, and despite all the mysterious and odd cases he’d previously covered with Sherlock, it’s a difficulty to fully wrap his mind around it. “So, what are we doing now, then?”
“Ethan?” A weak, gravelly voice calls from behind him, a head peering out, eyes squinting against the light. “You’re letting all the heat out. Who are you talking to?”
“I thought everything in that box was going to be tossed? Besides, you did say I could take the photo. Oh, wait, I must’ve
John nods distractedly. He swipes across to view the other photos, zooming in on the wound on her head. “How’d she die? Judging from the picture, I’d say it looks like blunt force to the head.”
She opens her mouth, then closes it quickly upon looking at the photo of William. “I, uh, I didn’t get a chance to do anything, because William, my late husband, had just returned home and she rushed home…” She clears her throat. “We never saw Thomas after Edythe’s passing, aside from the odd occasion in town or at the cemetery. Can’t say I wasn’t glad. There was always something about him that… unsettled me. Something about his eyes. When the police first told us about Edythe, I was so scared he’d done something to her.”
“That’ll have to wait,” Sherlock says as he puts the car into drive and pulls out onto the road. “I don’t know whose body they identified as Edythe back in 1960 because the Edythe we found didn’t have a freckle above her eyebrow.”
He has no idea how to return to the person they knew, and, he thinks with a tinge of guilt, it’s been so long that he’s not sure he wants to.
was warm. That’s all there was to it. Certainly nothing more. Sherlock winds the window down a touch more, pointedly ignoring the flurrying of rain and the chill down his spine that intensifies.
“John's not here, Sherlock, remember?” Sherlock spins once more to see Lestrade strolling over, takeaway coffee clutched in his hand. “He had to go see his parents, remember? His father’s sick.”
The ride back to John’s father’s house consists of a few observations of the surrounding area, almost all coming from Sherlock. He notes the cleanliness of the air, how quiet it is amongst the small towns—a complete contrast to the busy, bustling city he’s always known.
Lestrade looks between the three of them before settling on Sherlock, his face twisted as he struggles to absorb the scene before him. “Mind filling me in?”
She tightens her lips as she nods, her arms withdrawing close to her body, her thumb absentmindedly twisting her wedding ring around. Her eyes flicker again to the photograph of William. “Edythe’s an only child.”
. But I guess I have you to thank for this feeling in my chest,” she says, her hand curled inward. “This lightness. One time, I wrote about it all in a diary, but I guess the wounds were still too fresh for it to have any effect.”
The chill in the air hits his flushed cheeks, draping it’s tendrils around his neck, forcing him to tighten his scarf as he strolls towards Mycroft’s car. It starts with a powerful
Sherlock nods, his mind turning at all the pieces of information forming links. He takes a moment to allow John to absorb the information. “Just before, you mentioned someone, an Agatha. Who was she?”
“Don't look so surprised, Lestrade. It was either you or Anderson, and God knows the case would cease to a halt if he tried to assist.”
“Last time I saw her was back in 1960, the morning she died. Or when I thought she died, I guess… She left that morning, dressed in her favourite red coat. God, she looked beautiful,” he says, a wistful look on his face as he stares at the wall. “She said she was meeting someone but wouldn’t tell me who. Figured it was to do with the wedding. We were getting married in a couple weeks. I got the call a couple hours later to come identify her. It hurt to look at her, see her lying there. There was so much blood, all over her hair, on her blue coat… At least the impact killed her instantly.”
Sherlock takes this opportunity to investigate some of the other belongings, gesturing for John to do the same. Behind the box filled with photos sits a bag overflowing with women’s clothing, all distinctly from the 1970’s. He makes a mental note to look into Dorothy’s police report.
“Well, I can see the sewing pins are put practically everywhere. That doesn’t seem like a logical thing to do if you’re trying to take a dress in.”
“That would make sense, if the police had disclosed the details of her discovery to the public. But there’s also the fact that we found Edythe in a wedding dress that’s identical to the dress your mother, Dorothy, wore on her wedding day,” Sherlock says, holding up one of the photographs he’d spied yesterday alongside his phone displaying the pictures of Edythe’s body in the suitcase.
John swivels in his seat, eyes scouring every inch of Sherlock’s face, unsure of what he’s looking for but that he’ll know it when he sees it. “Okay?”
But even so, it still manages to catch him by surprise. Not the thought, no… Sherlock had already acknowledged it, however uneasily. No, it’s the intensity that startles him, the severity of the realisation that John feels like home. That John
The car holds a chill from where it sat in the shade. Sherlock turns on the car to start the heaters, but leaves it parked as he turns to face John.
The man nods dazedly, his eyes moving between the two, his fingers anxiously twisting one of his rings lining his hand. “Uh, yeah. That’s my dad. I’m, uh, I’m Ethan.”
“Good. Now, if we ignore for the moment that the sewing needles are placed as such, why would they use a dress that is clearly too large for a woman this size? Wouldn’t it be easier to find a dress that’s closer to her size and go from there? That’d be more practical, wouldn’t you agree?”
“Right, right. Like the lone wedding shoe hiding over there, perhaps.” Sherlock follows at a close distance, his eyes memorising the intricate routes between the piles of boxes. “Have you noticed that you tend to ramble, Ethan?”
“Uh, no, my aunt’s taken him to the shops,” Ethan stammers out, the sight of the detectives on his doorstep so soon shocking him. “He’ll be back soon, though.”
There’s a crinkle in her brow as she processes the question. “I don’t understand how that would be part of the investigation.”
Sherlock needs to leave. He’d never before noticed how little his self control around John is, and he can feel it slipping away rapidly, like water through helpless fingers, and
But late at night, when the silence is at it’s loudest and sleep eludes him, he’s almost anticipating the ringing of gunshots filling the flat or a small explosion from whatever experiment Sherlock’s working on at the time. It provides him with a lingering sense of nostalgia he doesn’t dare to admit to anyone, not even Sherlock. Shame bites at his ankles whenever the thought arises. Although Sherlock would probably be able to deduce it by some minuscule detail in his features or the way he holds the newspaper or something equally pretentious and unbelievable.
“All the airport staff is still here, I presume,” Sherlock asks, though it’s more of a statement than a question, moving in the direction of the nearest security guard.
Sherlock had flicked the indicator on and was pulling off to the side of the road before the memory of doing so catches up to him. The words
“You’re very sweet, dear.” Helen reaches a hand out, resting it gently atop John’s, her gaze gesturing to Sherlock standing behind him, his arm resting on the chair, just out of reach of John’s shoulder. “He’s lucky to have you.”
The urge to hide away in his mind palace is strong, the temptation almost overpowering him. But despite how desperately he needs the flimsy veil of self-control, Sherlock cannot run the risk of the police catching him without a licence. Mycroft may be the British Government but Sherlock certainly doesn’t want to deal with him if he can help it.
“You rambled quite a bit about how ‘insane’ the whole situation was before your father recounted the supposed last time he saw Edythe, and there’s also the fact that neither John nor myself mentioned how her body had been found, yet you somehow knew she’d been put into a suitcase. Quite interesting.”
“Sherlock, it’s fine,” John says, holding up his hands. “I’m guessing the reason no one ever heard of or from Edythe after the building collapsed is that she used the opportunity to escape and assumed the life of her sister. Helen mentioned about Thomas’s abusiveness so it would’ve been an almost perfect way to get away. It’s the only thing I can think of that makes sense to me.”
But back to why John’s morning seemed to be ruining his carefully built layers of camouflaged feelings. Sherlock had decided that the information he was receiving was not coming fast enough, so took it upon himself to dig deeper. All well and good were it not for the fact that the way he chosen to do this had been sat in the detective’s lap in their lounge room, looking thoroughly shagged out and undressed enough that she might be getting ready for a second (or third, going by the noises John had been subjected to earlier) round.
“I spent all week trying to find someone perfect.” Sherlock whispered to him, just slightly too close to his ear, so that John could feel his warm breath brushing against his skin, “She’s exactly your type, going by my calculations on what you find appealing in a woman. I’ve told her that you’re taking her on a date. And given the fact that I misstepped a few days ago, she will be pleasantly surprised by your stamina. Have fun!” John gaped as Sherlock trotted merrily out the door, no doubt to go meddle in the affairs of some other poor fellow.
“This isn’t...” he paused, “You’re in no way obliged to tell Sherlock about any of this are you?” He questioned, only now realising this may be some sort of test.
Greg was there for the arrest, standing by John as the perpetrator; the mother of Sherlock’s fake beau, was loaded into a police vehicle. “I’ve got a date tomorrow night.” The Detective Inspector commented offhandedly, “Was wondering if you’d be able to come round beforehand. It’s been a while since I’ve gone out and... well you get it.”
“Sherlock, I haven’t been... I’m... look I’m not impotent, I’ve been doing...that just as much as I always have been, I’m just choosing my times when you aren’t home and am practicing cleaner... methods.” He scrubbed a hand over his face, trying to calm himself, “and even if I was impotent, which I’m not, that’s not for you to try and solve. I just...” He paused for a moment, remembering another false deduction, “What the hell did you mean advanced age? I’m 45 not 60! I’m only 6 years older than you are!”
“Well you said I wasn’t allowed to go into your room without your permission, and if I left them in the bathroom there was a chance you either wouldn’t have seen them, or thought they were mine.”
It was another two months before Sherlock began digging again. Long enough that John had gone back to being comfortable in openly loving Sherlock and disinterested in anyone else. If he were an artist, he knew he would have a hundred sketchbooks filled with parts of Sherlock’s anatomy in action. His fingers steepled in thought, his eyes bright as a connection was forms, his hair in the wind, his lips... him, in every beautiful moment that existed in every second John spent gazing at the younger man. If he were a poet he’d have composed more sonnets each day than words Shakespeare had used in every single one his works together. But he was neither of those things, so instead he settled for making Sherlock tea when asked, cheering him on from the sidelines as his brain raced through the mazes of mystery they face regularly, and being the best friend he could be to Sherlock.
He had thought to have been doing well in this endeavour, for the most part, until this morning. Sherlock’s newest case had been almost tedious in its longevity, but they persevered; it was an 8 on the Sherlock interest scale. A rare high number that they hadn’t come across in almost three months, much to Sherlock’s chagrin. Indeed, the case itself had been on for nearly a month itself; the residence in which the offence took place living on the cusp of Lestrades’ division’s perimeters, and the Detective Inspector on the other side of that line had not been nearly as forthcoming as Lestrade himself.
He enters the kitchen and returns almost immediately, handing his father the tablets and ensuring he swallows them. He announces to John and Sherlock that it’s time for his father to lie down, helping him to his feet and leading him with a steady arm to a room across the hall.
He finds himself humming that morning, the sounds complimenting the ones he recalls John humming as he’d updated his blog time and time again, the melody simple yet sweet in his head as he studies the blood samples under the microscope. Though it isn’t until Mrs Hudson enters the kitchen carrying a tray of tea that he notices.
“52 years ago? That’s impossible. She’d only been dead a matter of days when she was found. Anderson ran the tests, correct?” Sherlock doesn’t wait for a response, eager for any opportunity to insult Anderson. “I’ve been telling you to fire that imbecile for years.”
When no response comes forth, Sherlock rises from his crouched position and spins, searching for the familiar jacket amongst the few officers milling around the airport. “John?”
Sherlock takes a seat beside John. “Helen, do you have any idea why Edythe was in that particular building that day?”
Sherlock nods, pushing to keep his voice level, to placate him. “So you bring her back here and put her in a wedding dress. Why?”
“You do realise that that’s the second time you’ve asked me how I am in the past 40 hours?” John turns his gaze out the window, keeping his eyes trained on the gravel. He doesn’t have the emotional strength to keep his guard up and the idea of having Sherlock verbally scrutinise every emotion he’s currently experiencing isn’t appealing in the slightest.
“Ready?” Sherlock asks when John slides into the passenger seat. He purposely avoids pushing further, not wanting to disrupt the progress they’ve made—it’s only been a day since they’ve properly spoken.
“No time to explain, John. I need your assistance.” His response comes out clipped, autopilot taking over in the face of something that threatens to engulf him. He gestures to the car, turning around with what John perceives to be an unspoken expectation for him to follow.
“A body was discovered at the Heathrow Airport close to a week ago, and DNA revealed it to be Edythe Carter, aged 79 and evidently not the body they determined to be Edythe in 1960.”
Guilt grips him, twisting and wrenching his insides into tight coils until he can barely draw breath—which he finds sickly ironic given that’s how it tends to feel when he thinks of Sherlock for too long.
“How did you find Edythe?” The words rush out of his mouth, catching everyone in the room by surprise, including himself.
He also notes, though only mentally, the quiet humming coming from his left, a gentle companion to the low volume of the radio he’d flicked on. Another wave of emotion overtakes him and he finds himself wanting, wanting
The bustle of strangers—of lovers celebrating anniversaries or having their first dates, of friends catching up, of families celebrating birthdays—fills the pub they’ve found, yet the moment between them feels oddly intimate. The soft lighting washes over them, their little booth providing a sense of comfort.
and switches his device off. This is a good thing, if he thinks about it. He can’t afford any more distractions. He has a case to solve and if there’s a heaviness in his chest after reading that message… Well, that’ll have to wait to be examined once he’s uncovered the truth behind the lady in the suitcase.
Helen nods, her throat tight. Her clutch on her handkerchief tightens, her knuckles pale against the vibrant material of her blouse. “It’s all just so confusing…”
“Yes,” he says, his tone now stern and appealing; determined to be the voice of reason. “We do that to help people, the police. We do that to catch criminals.”
“There was… so much blood, the police said. When we went to… identify her,” she says, her throat thickening with the memory, “there was still so much blood in her hair, on her hands. Her beautiful hands… God, how could I not recognise that it wasn’t Edythe’s hands? That it
“Am I just going to be a replacement for John while he's gone?” Lestrade’s tone is of one who thinks he should be offended but doesn’t have the energy to be. It’s easier to do as the consulting detective commands.
“Good afternoon, Mrs. Carter,” Sherlock greets with a warm smile. “We’re with Scotland Yard as part of the investigation surrounding Edythe. We had a couple more questions, if you don’t mind.”
Sherlock notes the way John’s jaw tenses, his knuckles turning white with repeated clenching. “You know it wasn’t like that, Harry.”
“I’ll be sure to do more of that, then.” There’s a tender smile on John’s face, his gaze steady as he stares at Sherlock. “I don’t think I could stand to be away from the city that much, anyway.”
A door clicks shut and Ethan’s figure appears in the doorway, leaning against the doorframe. “The pills tend to make ’im drowsy. Sorry if that messes with your questioning.”
Maybe that’s why, despite stealing the file from Lestrade’s desk that night and studying it extensively to no avail, he makes the five hour drive to John’s parents’ house a couple days later, certain that John’s absence is the reason for his inability to piece together this case. Once John’s around, he’ll be able to focus.
“You’ve got no deductions for me about what just happened? No ‘Harry’s scared so that’s why she exploded at me’? No ‘you hate that she’s right’? Nothing?”
“Oh, I’ve been meaning to ask you something…” John trails off. He reaches across the table for Sherlock’s hand, his fingertips feather light, sending chills up his spine. Sherlock’s lips part, his gaze lingering on John, quiet but ultimately captivated. “How does it feel to be wrong?”
Sherlock’s knuckles rap swiftly on the door, providing a sense of urgency for those inside of the house. He notes the array of flower bushes and assorted pot plants that appear to be in dire need of tending to. The front door opens and they’re met by a middle-aged man of a height that could rival John’s.
in his life. He was perfectly fine solving cases, proving his intelligence to anyone in the vicinity, regardless of whether they wanted to listen.
Lestrade exhales loudly, fingers tensing beside him in agitation. Just one punch. One swing at him is all Lestrade needs, and then he’d happily listen to Sherlock correct every single sentence he’s ever spoken. He rolls his shoulders to relieve the built-up tension, then crouches for a closer look, placing his cup beside him as he perches over the body.
“Your father had killed her and staged it to look like a suicide. Surely you’ve heard the rumors from her friends and–”
“I don’t…” Several emotions flicker across Thomas’ face, confusion highlighting through it all. “I don’t understand. Recent…?”
It had just gone 12 am when Sherlock’s phone rang. A quick glance told him it was Lestrade. The temptation to let it ring out was strong; he was in the midst of an experiment, of course. But a call in the middle of the night meant exciting, interesting by even Sherlock’s standards.
John nods solemnly. “We’re truly sorry for the loss you’re going through, again. Let us know at any point if you need a break or want to stop, okay?”
“Okay, so you know who to talk to and you’ve got their address, so why am I here? You’ve questioned people with less information on your own before.”
Sherlock had never had a best friend, or even a friend really for that matter. Not one he can remember, that is. He supposes his early years might tell a different story. He’d had colleagues, acquaintances, sure, but even referring to people in his life as such was a stretch. He had never had someone who was willing to be close to him, to put up with him and everything that his level of intellect and lack of outward emotions consisted of. And God knows Sherlock never needed that, especially something as trivial as a
know how to drive and I’ve never been in a collision. I’m a safe driver. Not even once did you appear uneasy during this drive, up until a minute ago, that is.”
“If she survived, which we know she did, wouldn’t you suppose her fiancé would be the one person she would confide in?”
and Sherlock stretches his fingers around the steering wheel, briefly relishing in the power lying beneath his grip.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock interrupts. He doesn’t fully understand his desire to know how John is currently feeling; how John's been feeling the last eleven days—those eleven days
“I need someone without my level of intellect to tell me what they see. It helps me think, process.”
But Ethan remains frozen on the floor as he takes in the sight of his father’s unmoving body. He releases his grip on the knife and lets his body sag as the depth of the situation dawns on him. He doesn’t resist as John grabs his wrists and restrains him.
“Oh, right.” Sherlock stares at the victim for a brief moment before looking back at the Detective Inspector. “Well in that case, come stand here,” Sherlock gestures to beside him. “I need an ordinary pair of eyes to provide insight.”
Sherlock puts the vehicle into drive, and they head in a similar direction to yesterday. A wave of relief washes over him when he realises whatever the reason for this change in John has nothing to do with him. He’d been dreading the thought of returning to the silence of 221B on his own after this case is solved, but now, he’s not sure he’ll have to. He makes a mental note to check in on John later.
“Oh, no no no,” John says, waving his hands in the air. “Don’t you try to flip this situation around, to make yourself be in the right.”
An irrational need to step in, to protect John, almost overtakes Sherlock, but something about the ice radiating from both siblings keeps his feet in place.
“At the cemetery,” Ethan allows, his eyes fixed on Sherlock, the tone behind his words almost begging for Sherlock to slip up, to give him the opportunity to dig the knife in just that little bit deeper. “We were visiting Mum like we do each month, and Dad spies her a few plots over.”
Sherlock resumes his determined stride, flipping the collar of his coat up for good measure, and Lestrade sighs. A quick glance at his watch tells him it’s just gone 2 am. It’s going to be a long night.
“I…” Her breath is coming rapidly now, her chest heaving as years of lies and guilt threaten to crash down around her, with William’s eyes watching her like a hawk from the windowsill. John reaches for her hand in an attempt to calm her down, his notebook forgotten on the table.
But now John had been gone for eight days. Eight days without his flatmate. Eight days without someone willing to be impressed by even the simplest of his deductions. Eight days without John and his music, his soft singing no longer filling the apartment, and the silence had begun to make Sherlock feel dreadfully lonely.
It happens in a flash, a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it move. Ethan turns towards the sink, John snapping to action, racing to stop him while Ethan’s hand finds a knife lying in the sink. He spins quicker than either had anticipated, seizing John in his tight grip, holding him captive.
are being screamed at him, over and over and over, and oh, how he wishes he could scold himself for not focusing on the case, on something else, on anything that isn’t John.
John laughs softly, turning to watch the flower fields peeking out through the treeline. “I didn’t even know you could drive,” John mentions off-handedly, his mind already pulling him back to the days of his childhood when he and Harry would race through similar fields—back when they were still on decent terms, back when they were okay.
And when he feels John’s thumb brush against his cheek and rest there, gentle and wholly natural, he thinks that maybe this kiss is revealing it for him.
“Admittedly it did take me a while to notice, but then it was like a switch had flipped, because after then, I couldn’t stop noticing your absence. The flat’s so quiet without you there, without your singing. I know in the past it’s gotten to me, especially when I’m trying to concentrate, but then I had two weeks without it and that’s infinitely worse.”
“You were right,” John breathes out, breaking the silence that had settled over them. “It’s only been eleven days, but I have missed this.” There’s a hint of longing in his voice, something John hadn’t expected to come through, so before he can inadvertently admit to anything that could possibly condemn him, he exits the vehicle. He makes for the house, but stops when he doesn’t hear the sound of the engine. Cautiously, he steps around the car and waits for Sherlock to roll down the window. “Sherlock?”
Strangers pass by their table, their own conversations filling in the comfortable lull that’s settled over the pair. They spend the next little while sharing a meal and communicating with unabashed smiles that convey what they’re still a little scared to admit aloud just yet. But maybe, just maybe, their time spent apart and everything that lead to this moment will give them the courage to be a little brave; to say what they’ve kept buried, what they’ve tried to hide from everyone, including themselves.
“No, she was an only child, jus’ like her parents. Nothing like the six siblings I had or the five my wife had.”
“John, come look at this. I need your eyes,” Sherlock called over his shoulder, eyes fixed on the corpse. She appeared to be in her 80’s, judging by the wrinkles and age spots adorning her face. She’s practically swimming in an enormous wedding dress that consumes her delicate frame, and one white shoe that looks as though it would fall off with the slightest movement. What strikes Sherlock as odd were the dozens of sewing needles placed haphazardly along the material. That, however, wasn’t nearly as odd as the fact that the body had been discovered in a suitcase at the baggage carousel of the airport.
“What? The moment we met him? You knew and you didn’t do anything? And– wait a minute. How on earth could you possibly have known it was him?”
John shakes his head, reaching over again to hold one of her hands. “You couldn’t’ve possibly known, especially with more than twenty years in between.”
“That was important! Besides,” he adds quickly, cutting John off from whatever reprimand he was about to administer, “there’s hardly a time where my driving is called upon, so it’s easier to just forfeit the licence.”
Ethan glances at it before folding it in half and slipping it into his pocket, giving him a curt nod. “Will do.”
He makes a vow, then, to use John’s absence for the better. John’s absence would be a good thing. Of this, Sherlock was certain.
“What? No, no no I can’t leave now,” John says, exasperated as he places a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to stop him from entering the vehicle. “My father needs me, Sherlock. I can’t just leave.”
“Ethan,” Sherlock says, taking miniscule steps closer, his hands steady in front of him. “Your father was an abusive man. We spoke with Edythe’s mother, and she told us about how much Edythe had insisted on the abuse she endured at your father’s hands.”
. But he’s trapped. His legs are unresponsive, feet stuck in place as though he’s glued to the ground.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker a few times in confusion as the question registers. “Wrong? What are you talking about?”
“Oh, I forgot to mention one small thing.” There’s a flicker of a smile on Sherlock’s lips and a glint in his eye as he glances at John.  “Edythe died at the age of 27 in 1960.”
John watches in shock, trying to keep his guard up in case Ethan makes for either of them, even when the scene brings forth memories he’s tried to bury: soldiers dying on surgery tables despite his vow to protect them, hands gripping his as fear overtakes them in their last final moments.
“Harry?” John tries, his hand outstretched with the need to follow, but the uncertainty of not quite knowing how keeping him frozen.
Thomas’s shoulders droop slightly, the bag in his hand crinkling slightly. “She was gonna take you away from me.”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s grip on the steering wheel tightens just long enough for John to notice. (He pretends not to.) “Right.”
“Yes, Sherlock, I’m aware of the basics of driving. So, you’re telling me all this time we could’ve had a car of our own?”
Curiosity prickles at Sherlock’s insides, the words coaxing his attention from the slides he’s studying. He moves away from the eyepiece lens of the microscope to avoid any distractions. “Something came up then?”
John’s smile widens as he recalls the line from after the first case. There had been so much intensity, so much adrenaline pumping through his veins that night; the exhilaration keeping him on his feet. But then he’d looked at Sherlock, and those feelings paled in comparison to what he felt then, to what he feels now.
“But why did you believe him? That the lady at the cemetery was his late fiancé? Surely he would’ve mentioned that she’d died.”
that Sherlock had never received wholeheartedly before that causes him to push and prod, to find and test the limits and edges to John’s tolerance that he just doesn’t appear to have when it comes to Sherlock. It’s been years and Sherlock still doesn’t have an answer for how that makes him feel.
Perhaps it’s because he’s only really known John in London, but as the house comes into view, looming over them, Sherlock can’t help thinking that John doesn’t seem to fit in here. That he instead belongs in their flat with the smile on the wall, the skull on the mantelpiece… with him. Though maybe that’s just the part of him that’s constantly anticipating the day John leaves him, never wanting to be taken by surprise when it inevitably happens.
Sherlock hums to indicate he’s right. “I apologise for not checking in with you sooner. To be honest, I didn’t even notice your absence for the first five days until Lestrade brought it up.” Sherlock briefly wonders whether John can sense the silent
Thomas’s legs begin to buckle under his weight, and he mumbles something along the lines of “I need to sit down”, an ashen expression falling over his face. Ethan, with a firm hand around his father, leads him inside with Sherlock and John following closely behind.
He cuts himself off, his stare at his father filling with despair. Sherlock glances over at Thomas, spies the tiredness around his eyes, the truth seeping through.
“We’re investigating the recent death of someone you knew, and were wondering about the last time you saw or spoke to her.”
The knife shifts from John’s neck, who’s focus had been fixed on trying to calculate the risk involved in moving away, that he misses when Ethan’s entire demeanour slips into one of fury and resentment as he charges at his father. The knife finds a home in the base of his throat, buried to the hilt as their bodies hit the floor, a sickening
“Agree with it?” Anger flashes through Ethan, the knife inadvertently piercing John’s skin and drawing a drop of blood, causing him to wince. “It was insane. It was like he was trying to replace Mum. He puts her in Mum’s wedding dress and shoes, starts going on and on ’bout how he’d dreamt of this day for years and tells me to fix her dress while he gets ready. ’S when she started spewing lies upon lies about how he abused her and how the only way she could get away was faking her death and taking the place of her twin sister and all this other crazy shit. And she wouldn’t stop. ‘He hit me constantly’ and ‘threatened to kill me if I tried to leave’ and she just wouldn’t stop so I hit ’er, again and again for all the lies and hurt she caused.”
Harry’s expression is unreadable, even for Sherlock. “You can apologise all you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that you haven’t visited Dad
Taking a seat opposite Thomas, situated between two precarious piles of newspapers, John flips through the pages until he comes across a page that isn’t filled with scribblings that vaguely resemble words and numerous calculations. “Okay, Thomas,” he begins, his voice steady. “I know this is all very confusing, but it’s really important. When was the last time you saw Edythe?”
“Oh, that’s alright, Ethan,” Sherlock says, stepping to the side of Ethan to enter the house. “We also were hoping to talk to you, too.”
“Lestrade wouldn’t hand over the file,” Sherlock replies simply. “Open it up and read over the information.”
“Piecing together from what you’ve told us, about Agatha and Thomas, I think it’s possible that Edythe discovered your journal entry about Agatha and arranged to meet with her. And when the building collapsed, it was Agatha and not Edythe who got hit and crushed.” John pauses briefly, then hurries to continue, cursing himself for his word choices. “I think with them being twins, and the shock of the situation and the impact on her body, any of the notable differences you might’ve picked up on when identifying her, had the situation been different, were overlooked. The police received positive identification from three different people: you, your husband, and Thomas, and that seemed to be plenty for the case to be closed. I’ve looked through the police report, and they didn’t run any DNA tests or anything further.”
Sherlock hummed in response, eyes darting about the room, before staring again at the deceased. “Did you manage to find any identification?”
Sherlock cheeks flush slightly and he turns his gaze to the distance, attempting to appear nonchalant. “Oh, right. I knew that.”
Before he could think better of it, or even think at all, Sherlock retrieves his mobile from his inner suit pocket and quickly types out a message to John.
John shakes his head, fighting to keep the smile from his face. The front door opens behind them, revealing Lestrade escorting a disheveled Ethan towards the police car.
“Mrs. Carter,” John begins gently, before he clears his throat and corrects himself. “Sorry, Helen. Are you sure you’re comfortable speaking more about Edythe? We completely understand if it’s too much for you.”
Sherlock glances around the lounge room, eyes searching for the pieces of evidence he’d spied yesterday. “Sometimes speaking with a relative can help us solve a case. You know, get their point of view, find out what secrets they may or may not realise they’re hiding, that sort of thing.”
“I do, but I figured you wouldn’t appreciate it at the current time.” John can only stare at him incredulously. “It’s also because you’ve summed up what I would have stated.”
“What?” John’s head whips around so swiftly Sherlock is momentarily concerned he may have whiplash. But when he looks over, he’s met with an expression similar to the many he recalls from their Hounds of Baskerville case: open mouth, the whites of his eyes visible, disapproval accentuating it all.
Five days in his parent’s house, and his insides feel hollow, as though the silence is draining his emotions, dampening them down, leaving him in a horrible mix of being restrained yet floating away with zero control. He never pictured there coming a day where he missed the sound of gunfire. God knows he’d endured plenty during his time in Afghanistan.
“Yes, but why hide it?” Confusion etches itself over John’s face as he stares at the pages, as though he’ll find the answer written there. This case is making less and less sense with the more information revealed. “If he knew she was alive, why tell the police it was her body found? And whose body
In came someone who listened to his deductions with a sense of astonishment and wonder, even after all this time. Someone who moves in with him and puts up with his (admittedly) insane experiments and body parts in the fridge and guns firing at all hours of the morning and to top it off, hours upon hours, sometimes days of silence, and John takes this in his stride as though it’s the most normal of situations to find himself in. And maybe it’s this…
“I didn’t find out Dad was sick until after we were deployed.” John’s voice starts hard and stubborn, but morphs into an awful quiet, his shoulders sagging with the weight of his guilt. “I am sorry, Harry.”
John steps closer and digs his hand in the left pocket of Sherlock’s coat, rummaging around until he retrieves a pocket-sized notebook. He catches the befuddled expression on Sherlock’s face when he glances up. “What? I know you keep one in your coat, and I didn’t bring mine.”
Granted, it had actually been just under nine days since John received the call from his mother, her worry and urgency seeping through to the surface of her words sending John flying up the stairs to his bedroom, hastily tossing clothes in a duffle bag and offering a rushed explanation to Sherlock before he fled. An entire two hundred and eleven hours—not that Sherlock was counting, of course. No, no, he had more pressing matters at hand.
Even for him, this case is causing some confusion, some uncertainty he hadn’t expected. He provides silence, ready for as much as John might require, in order to allow John to process. (It only takes twenty seconds.)
“Then why on earth did we go through the hassle of speaking with Thomas and Helen and then whatever that mess we just experienced instead of sending Lestrade after him?” Sherlock fixes him with a pointed look, one that says
John’s shock surprises himself. This is a prime example of Sherlock being Sherlock. “So Mycroft knows about your lack of licence, obviously, and he still lets you borrow his car? Incredible.”
“Because it never works.” John sighs, running a hand over his face. He fixes his sight on Sherlock, staring almost long enough for Sherlock to feel the need to shift in his seat or draw John’s attention elsewhere. “Okay, enough of that before I lose my mind… Wanna tell me what our game plan is?”
“I– It was in the 30’s when the girls were born, during the Great Depression, and William just couldn’t find any work. Some days, we were so hungry. I don’t know how we managed…” Her eyes are downcast at the table, a crease in her brow. “It got so bad that William forced us to give up Agatha. I… He came home from another endless day of searching for work, and he announced he had a solution to all our money problems. I can still picture that horrible smile on his face as he told me he’d found someone to adopt Agatha. I–” She chokes out a sob. “I tried so hard to forget about it, to pretend Agatha never existed, but every day,
A scoff escapes Lestrade, mostly out of shock at Sherlock’s ego (which he can’t believe he’s still surprised by), but Sherlock’s mind has already latched back onto the deliberate rip in the victim’s skirt, mind racing as he scrutinises all the possibilities, the conversation already deleted from his memory. “Focusing solely on the sewing needles, tell me what you see.”
“What?” Ethan’s focus faltered, the knife shifting away from John’s neck, but coming back forcefully—a warning for Sherlock to stay where he is. “What about my mother?”
that’s resting on the edge of his tongue. Her retreating steps sound down the stairs and he raises the cup to his lips, taking a sip as his mind wanders from the case.
Sherlock’s keen eyes analyse the situation, momentarily glancing at Ethan settling his father into a chair before turning to take in the surroundings. Crowded around them are boxes upon boxes stacked in precarious piles, creating narrow pathways throughout the loungeroom. The closest box is filled with books and newspapers, and the one just to the right holds photographs. Family photos, many of Ethan in his youth, a few of Thomas working on his car, one of a wedding. A golden frame in particular catches Sherlock’s eye, displaying Thomas in his late 20’s on the front steps of the house they’re currently standing in, enclosing someone Sherlock deduces to be a young Edythe in a hug. Scrawled on the side of the box in chunky letters are the words ‘throw away’.
John lifts the cover and scans over the information regarding Edythe’s death in 1960, brushing over it and coming to a stop at the people who identified her. “A Mr. Thomas Richards, aged 83, lives at– Wait, previously engaged to Edythe Carter? We’re visiting her fiancé from 52 years ago?”
John nods and instructs Sherlock to find Beverly. He sits with Helen, holding her hand while they wait for their return. They leave her after promising to return when they’re certain of what occurred on that fateful day and on Edythe’s life afterwards.
he feels to signify it’s been sent makes Sherlock feel the bizarre desire to erase himself from existence. Never, in his entire life, has he sincerely asked that question, let alone thought to. It’s a pointless question, a conversation starter really. It’s not something people mean. So what on earth compelled him to send such a text, and one that he found he meant?
There’s a slight sway to her as she strains to look up at his tall figure. She nods shakily, stepping back to guide them to the kitchen and gesturing to the seats. “Please, call me Helen. Can I get you anything? Drinks? Biscuits?”
Sherlock starts the car without another word and John appreciates it. He needs a moment, just one, to catch his thoughts, to analyse that interaction. It was odd. Just so… different.
John looks down at the notebook, using the pen to help him scan through his notes. “Do you remember thinking anything was different or, I don’t know,
“Alright, we aren’t spilling all my secrets in the first five minutes of you two meeting. Brat put your clothes back on.”
“He’s been in far more compromising positions than this, with a lot less doubt of what was happening mate.” John hit Brat’s calf disapprovingly, “What? It’s true! Remember that time I walking in on you with those two-“
“That’s a first coming from your mouth.” A choking noise from the doorway again at Brat’s words, John spared the man a glance and noticed he was now flushed red, eyes almost bugging out with what he was viewing.
As I said previously, this story is being submitted to sherlocksmolmes “Keep Johnlock Alive” competition, so if you love the story please go over to their tumblr on the 30th and make sure they know!!
“How do you... the cabbie! He was your spy not Coral!” John pointed a finger accusingly at a black cab as it passed.
John had thought after sufficiently embarrassing them both, Sherlock would put this idea that John had a secret to keep, to bed. Unfortunately that did not seem to be the case as a mere two days later Sherlock was escorting a lovely-looking blonde woman into their lounge room with his politest and most charming of smiles. John had been enjoying watching a new show based off a book written by two of his favourite authors, when Sherlock came to a stop in front of him.
So, to hide his hidden feelings, without hiding them so much that he would be devoured by a litany of caustic deductions, he knew that he could also never act upon them, for fear that the ridicule would come to much more disastrous effect. The suggestion that he may have some ulterior motive for standing by Sherlock’s side, that he may be shunned from him and the glorious adventures they had together because of perceived notion that he may only want for base and carnal motions reviled John even more that the idea of having been in Molly’s place at Christmas during the year of The Woman.
WARNING: Some discussions of a sexual nature happen in this chapter. Nothing actually happens, but there are mentions of dicks, so you’ve been warned.
John stood to greet her, presuming she was a client with a particularly interesting case, only to be interrupted before he could open his mouth.
“My apologies Mrs Hudson, we were under the impression that we may have a little more time before anyone arrived.” Sherlock shot her a smile as the girl buttoned up her clothes and dashed out, but not before giving Sherlock quiet instructions to call her later and a quick kiss to his cheek. John knew that was a lie. Sherlock has it down to a science how long it took John to get to and from the shops, with variations such as weather, road works, and John’s mood, all accounted for.
“Well, given your recent disinterest in the opposite sex, lessened masturbatory sessions and advance in age I figured you were just uncomfortable about confronting your impotence, so I thought, being your friend, I would buy some... aids for you.”
“How about, in future, you worry about your own cock before you go wondering what mine is doing hm?” He left the room, heading upstairs to get ready for work, surprised that he’d managed to keep a straight face all the way up to the door.
“Normally when you see an attractive woman you cannot help yourself from staring, yet Bethany,” Ah. That was her name, “was practically naked and you didn’t even spare her a glance.”
“If you’re going to try and disguise yourself as restaurant goer, might I suggest actually eating something?” He called to the shadows, from which a very put out looking Sherlock emerged.
“You said it yourself when we first met, ‘there’s always something.’ You miss things and-“ John was interrupted as Sherlock grabbed he sides of his face, face lighting up as he realised something.
“Second Lieutenant,” Sherlock amended, “I just wasn’t expecting to find John willingly in a stance that could be misconstrued in such a way.”
“Except that can’t be the case can it Sherlock? Because we both know that when I’m single I have more time to be on cases, yet you attempted to find me someone who you deemed suitable for me, which had that worked would mean I would be there for less cases from there on out.” John’s grin was almost manic at this stage, “It also doesn’t explain why you were listening in the night for me, you weren’t tracking or checking, you just wanted to listen. And then when you found out I’d told Greg about what was happening, it upset you because I hadn’t said anything to you, and you were supposed to be the person I told everything to, the person I was closest to, because I was that for you in every sense because,” his heart stuttered minutely, taking a soft gasping breath in to make sure he had the strength to say it.
“I’m going to walk home, and by the time I get there, you better have let this go or so help me god.” He didn’t have words to articulate his frustrations, so instead he finished with a simple, “Good night Sherlock.”
“You are washing your sheets less frequently, the monthly spending on lubricant has gone down and...” he paused for a moment, looking almost as though he was beginning to regret this interaction, “I haven’t heard you at night in weeks.” Those words sent a red flush through John’s face.
John had felt a sudden rush of cold beginning a the back of his neck and spreading down his spine, as unpleasant a feeling as if he had poured the dessert in his hand down the back of his shirt. No. This wasn’t the moment. A beat of silence and John contemplated whether he would turn around.
The flustered look on Sherlock’s face turned from embarrassment to angry in seconds, “Of course it was a secret! I didn’t know about this! You stopped looking at other people, it’s been going on long enough that not only does Greg know, but you’ve discussed it with him, but you haven’t told me anything!” He took a deep breath, clearly getting ready for a longer rant, “it isn’t anything medical because apparently you’ve been hiding your changed routine from me as well! And even when someone literally perfect for you is presented to you, you don’t even give them a chance. I don’t understand why you won’t just tell me John,” his voice was going into a high octave of distress, “why can’t I figure this out!” His own shouting seemed to confuse him, as he tightened his scarf on his neck, “I’m going to Mycroft’s, I need a couple days in my mind palace and I can’t do that with you and your boy toy soldier in the house.”
John knew however, that’s for the rest of the day he would be wondering about Sherlock’s cock, thanks to his own exiting line.
“Yes, but that was because I thought it may affect your ability to be my assistant.” Sherlock attempted to butt in but John was on a role.
“Don’t, please.” She rested a hand on his arm, squeezing lightly, “In all honesty I was hoping tonight would fail. I’m bisexual, but this was going to be a deciding date about whether or not I continue to actively date men.” A mischievous happiness filled her eyes, “Though to be fair, with you being so upfront I’m not really sure which way that swings the decision.” They both laughed quietly at the comment, falling into easy conversation before the cab finally and unsurprisingly reached Angelo’s.
“You see but you do not observe Sherlock,” God, John had been waiting ages to throw that particular turn of phrase back at Sherlock, and he felt a powerful sense of satisfaction doing it. “You’re too close to it all. When have you ever in your life cared about the feelings or relationships of those around you? You’ve always thought that sort of thing was meaningless. Yet now, you’re watching to see if I ogle women, questioning why I’m not dating-“
Sherlock made an affirmative sort of noise. He knew he should have something to eat, but his appetite had vanished with his good mood. Besides, getting out from under John’s hard gaze sounded preferable to food, anyway.
Moriarty regarded him, brown eyes sparkling with malice. “Well, then.” He slipped his hands into his pockets and shrugged. “I suppose I shall just have to kill you, then. But first I will kill every member of your meddling little crew, and then… I will take a long… long time killing you.”
“That all, Captain?” the man, Ekene, then asked in a rough voice with a glance and small nod at John. His brown eyes were almost golden in the sunlight, full of a quiet intensity.
John watches, and laughs, and loves him. Their future may still be somewhat uncertain, but at least they have this.
“Just an acquaintance,” Sherlock says, eyes going wide as he realizes this is dangerous territory. He stands and, with frantic movements he can’t seem to control, gathers his things. “I’d better go.”
“Here, I nearly forgot!” Margaret says when they break apart. “These are for you, dear.” She picks up a bouquet of flowers from on top of her purse on the ground and hands them to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed with something between mischief and malice. “If we destroy the ship and its crew, the NOTP would likely crumble. No leaders, no corrupt operations.”
“Not when one of the staff here is a fan,” John smirks. “Plus, I told him I’d name a character after his mother.”
The word acted as a stimulant. At once, despite their injuries and fatigue and pain, John’s men fought against those who had helped them.
Moriarty’s eyes widened dramatically, and he even lifted a hand to his chest as though scandalized. “Why, I can hardly imagine what you mean. We are a ship of a trading company-”
The gashes on Sherlock’s skin screamed out as he hoisted himself up onto his hands and knees and fixed his most withering gaze on Moriarty. The crew around had fallen silent, watching.
do you want, Irene?” Sherlock growled. His voice was gravelly and almost indecently low. John shivered, and Sherlock flicked an amused glance at him, as if he knew precisely the effect he had just had on John.
John smiled, cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder. He tilted his head up and placed his hand at the back of Sherlock’s head. “Come here, you.”
and other NOTP ships must bribe or manipulate certain representatives, feeding them false or incomplete reports. In turn, the representatives tell merchant companies, rich benefactors, and nobles all about their marvelous, non-corrupt, non-evil Programme. Ruthless and despicable, though I do love with when the criminals are clever. Much more fun,” he said with relish.
He launches into speech about the chats he’d had with a pair of up-and-coming mystery writers from America, then with an editor friend of Mike’s, and then with the fans during the public part of the convention earlier in the day.
Mycroft considers his response, as well as his use of the word “boyfriend,” for several long moments before finally nodding. “Very well, Mr. Watson.”
“I…” Sherlock has to clear his throat and swallow before his voice can come out not croaky. “I was thinking we could go to my flat. It’s not far from here.”
a profession. Besides, looking at you right now, you’re like a handsome — I don’t know, Victor Frankenstein, concocting genius creations.”
“You think that’s enough time for someone like me to have decided to just hand over... everything?” He flaps a hand at himself.
He was rolling the sixth barrel when he felt it. A slim, cool line of metal, pressed against the side of his neck.
Sherlock nodded. “The members of that company are criminals, of a higher order than mere pirates. They are embedded in the fabric of European society, masquerading at being respectable when really their reputation is built on violence, corruption, and death. I cannot abide the hypocrisy.”
“Only because I knew how the crime was done in advance, because they were fictional! You’re actually figuring these things out!”
The breeze filled the grey sails with steady, cool air. The ocean rolled in gentle waves beneath the hull. The sun shone in hot beams down onto the decks of the
Sherlock blinked, a slow, thoughtful movement. Then, with deliberation and yet with hesitance, he set down his tea and let his hands come to rest on John’s cheeks. The lightest of touches, reverent and fascinated, brushed down from his cheeks to his jaw.
John grew braver, too. Slowly, carefully, over time, he told of how he’d been the two years Sherlock was gone. How he’d doubted everything about himself, about his friendship with Sherlock, how he’d railed at himself for missing the signs of Sherlock’s depression.
However, with Sherlock, he doesn’t feel self-conscious. Sherlock feels as passionate about John’s writing as John does, and his observations and suggestions are detailed, thoughtful, and helpful. Certainly, he has some suggestions for improvement, but John finds that he loves every single one.
The bullet in Sherlock’s chest. Magnussen. The tarmac and the goodbye that should have been so much more.
Sherlock inclined his head, but eyed John with a keen gaze. John, used to his pirate’s sharp observational skills, didn’t react other than to straighten his posture a bit.
were the wronged one. “I’ve known plenty of men who have scars because of people like you. Or they’ve lost friends, brothers-in-arms, siblings. You are what is wrong with the world. I don’t care you think you have a good reason. You do not.”
The men scattered, leaving John and Lestrade alone by the mast. They turned to each other in unison.
“Well, I’m sure you can hold your own against him,” Sherlock says back. “You’re the one with actual experience. He thinks he’s going to be the next Hemingway, though why anyone would aspire to that, I’ve no idea.”
Sherlock nods, leaning forward in interest. “How did you come up with his name?” Immediately, the red tint is flooding back to his face. “I know that might be a strange question, but… I always wondered, and could never find online-”
He handed John a ration of salted beef and bread. “Winter is doing well. She was awake and asked if she could go back to work already.” He shook his head.
John stared, mouth hanging open. Around them, the crew tittered and beamed. Irene whooped, to general mirth. Finally, John swallowed.
“I’m not going anywhere with you.” John’s fists clenched at his sides. How could he have been so stupid as to leave his flintlock at home?
A small crease has appeared on Sherlock’s forehead, and John is struck by the urge to smooth it away, either with his thumb or his lips. He doesn’t act on either desire though, and just waits for Sherlock’s answer.
He locked the phone and shrugged, casual as could be. “False alarm. It was from a study partner from one of my classes.”
John’s feet hit the deck with a sound like a thunderclap, and his face broke into a glorious grin. His sword sung as he pulled it from its sheath and flung himself into battle. Sherlock watched with still hazy vision, wonder spreading through him as he saw how John moved. Strong, confident in a way Sherlock had never before seen his lover.
Sherlock nods, as if it is perfectly reasonable, even normal, to have intense discussions about how best to get away with homicide. “Well, I hope it didn’t ruin your appetite.”
John slipped a hand into Sherlock’s, lacing their fingers together, and pulling away just enough to make eye contact again, feeling a shiver down his spine as he did so. Sherlock’s eyes were so beautiful, the pupils blown so wide he felt as though if he looked hard enough he could see directly into Sherlock. He reached a hand down to lazily pull at Sherlock’s cock in time with his thrusts. Sherlock moaned, and John licked it right from his mouth, unable to stop a moan in response when Sherlock clenched around him.
"John, please tell me you have lube," Sherlock said, before closing his teeth over John's earlobe and causing the older boy to cry out.
“Sherlock, darling, so nice of you to join us!” Sherlock’s mum joked somewhat wryly when Sherlock entered the kitchen. “I think Sherlock’s got himself a friend,” his mother continued, nudging Mycroft lightly and winking at her husband. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John stomped into the flat, clenching his fists. He muttered under his breath furiously. He slammed the door shut, closing his eyes and breathing the comforting smell of home-which at that moment smelled like an odd mix of lavender and sulfur. Probably the result of Mrs. Hudson trying to be nice, and Sherlock doing one of his ridiculous experiments.
After they got dressed, they entered the kitchen once more to see Mike eyeing their bacon quite hungrily.
This time, the cannonball smashed through their mainmast, which creaked and tilted dangerously. The men who had followed John onto the deck cried out.
Mycroft’s eyebrows, he thinks, raise slightly while he shakes John’s hand. Then, he nods at Sherlock before at last leaving. John waits until he hears the front door open and close, then turns to face his boyfriend.
“Perhaps a bit,” John admitted. He took the bottle back, though, and gulped some of the horrible concoction down.
“Fair enough,” John shrugged. He kicked Moran’s sword into the flames. “Burn here for all I care. Now, Irene, Winter… Let’s get off this ship.”
“I met James Moriarty today.” Sherlock describes their brief, odd, discomfiting interaction. The more he speaks, the more concerned John looks.
Still fuming, he entered the building, clipping his ID onto his shirt. He waved to the receptionist, who nodded back. He was just about to head to A&E to check in with his supervisor when he realized… he was wearing the wrong ID badge. This was his university ID, not Bart’s. He cursed under his breath and shot a glance at his watch. He would have to head up to his desk and grab the right one. He’d be cutting it close, but ah well. He was covering for someone; that had to give him some kudos.
John glanced at Irene, slightly skeptical. What honourable reason would there be for piracy? But she appeared to agree with Ekene if her emphatic nod was any indication.
“You are remarkable, John,” Sholto continued. He was blushing slightly, and John felt panic rise in his throat. “I…”
“John!” he gasped when he shoved the pillow off and squirmed under John’s fingers, laughter bubbling out of him, uncontrolled. “No, stop! You’re being-! Ah! Ridiculous!”
“I’ve been thinking about you for months, Sherlock Holmes. How you and your freakish meddling ruined me. If you hadn’t pried, I wouldn’t have had to come to your flat, you wouldn’t have got me arrested. You have any idea what prison is like? What it does to you? What it teaches you about people and yourself? I learned there, Holmes, that people are terrible. Every single one.
“Perhaps not,” Mycroft tilts his head. “Still, already spending the night. Should I anticipate hearing a happy announcement in another few days?”
, Rosie,” Sherlock said earnestly. The sound of that sentence, spoken so casually, practically shattered John’s universe, even though it was not the first time he’d heard Sherlock tell her that. (The first time, John had nearly burst into tears.)
, and he had no inkling of what had happened to them. Had they made port? Had anyone been badly injured, or worse? And what of Sherlock’s work? Surely someday the NOTP would catch up to them, and what then?
Sherlock searched desperately for a hint of where Sebastian might be hiding, but the man was too vague, too focused on talking about Sherlock, to give any clues. Sherlock even tried asking him questions, but the other man always stopped texting for a few hours when that happening.
She shrugged. “I know.” Then leaning close enough for only Irene and John to hear, she added in a whisper, “I just think it’d be fun to beat him again.”
He interrupts Sherlock once — to bring him his cup — but otherwise leaves him be. After about an hour, though, John is missing him. That, and he thinks they need to have a discussion.
He didn't get any more, though, because John pulled back then, eyes fluttering open. There was a delighted sort of gleam in them, and he was grinning. Sherlock was fairly certain he had never seen anything lovelier.
She nods and pulls out her phone, hits a few buttons, and hands it over. “I haven’t replied yet. I tried googling them, but I can’t find any helpful reviews, really.”
He laboured for a while, measuring and making notations. His navigation abilities were not as refined as their navigator, but he has ensured from months of study that they were well enough should he have to take charge of these matters. The
He stands, though, and helps Sherlock upright. They scramble back through the window — giggling when John nearly stumbles and falls — then collapse into bed.
Sherlock nodded. His lungs no longer felt as though they were being squeezed through a narrow pipe, so that had to be an improvement. “Sebastian,” he whispered. He would have to tell John everything now; he just knew it. The time for dealing with this alone seemed to have passed.
He signed in, rolling his eyes at the ridiculous website—which featured a horrible pun on a Roman god’s name in its title—and found his profile. The photo Janine had selected for him was admittedly not a bad one, one she had once snapped of him without him knowing. She had, however, managed to catch him looking not entirely horse-faced and awful. In fact, he looked… alright. On the profile itself, he corrected a few things, including his birth date, which Janine had “helpfully” made five years younger than it truly was. Then, he groaned and began to type in the “About Me” section.
“We’re friends, that is all. Perhaps if I had not met you first, I’d have…” John cleared his throat. “But you’re rather diverting.”
The implication that Sherlock is free to refuse is evident in every syllable, and Sherlock finds himself smiling. If he can’t show it to John, who?
And all through the days leading up to Christmas, John finds himself facing the same question over and over again.
“Sherlock, breathe,” his boyfriend was saying, hands wrapped around Sherlock’s upper arms to steady him. “Just breathe, he’s gone. Come on, let’s get you inside.”
He does stop at a door, though, mere steps past the café. Only when he pulls a key out of his pocket does John realize—
“Poetry,” Sherlock murmurs after a beat. He does not elaborate, and John does not push him. Instead, he takes up the last two books and opens one. He signs it with quick and confident pen strokes, then pulls
“Good morning.” For several minutes they simply regard each other in silence, John stroking the tangles from the curls.
Ekene was a kind man, which John found remarkable. Not remarkable that Ekene was kind—that much was evident every moment—but that John could so easily think that of a pirate.
Mycroft, despite your reasonable hesitance to believe it. My brother, seven years my junior, took to the seas nearly eight years ago to avenge the death of our father. His ship, a schooner, he named the
Sherlock giggles, pushing himself off the side of the building where he had been leaning like a damn model. “How were your writers?”
Sherlock huffed out a frustrated breath between his teeth. “Lieutenant Watson, just because I am a pirate does not mean, contrary to your opinion toward me and my kind, that I have no ability to care for other people.”
Sherlock snickered, then kissed John in response. He moved with eager confidence again, the acute focus he so often trained upon his work now turned directly onto John.
rocked once more, and John felt the entire vessel tilt. The aft end rose high above the stern. The hull was breached. They were sinking.
“Sure I did. After all, it’s my fault your old one broke.” He nods at the bag at Sherlock’s feet. “What with you carrying my entire collected works in it and all.”
He raised an eyebrow at her. At the moment, he was standing over an array of tools and notes, none of which were organized from what Molly could tell.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, which made John grin as though that had been just the reaction he had been expecting. But a moment later, the memory of what Sherlock had been worried about yesterday flooded back. Would he get to wake up next to John more often? Would they be able to spend the night at one another’s flats more often next term? Would they drift apart if they moved apart? He felt his expression transforming into something more thoughtful, almost sad, as his mood fell from its pedestal of contentment. His eyes flickered down, away from John’s gaze.
Sherlock frowned, a bit perplexed. He clicked on the man’s profile photo and scanned the information there.
In the cabin, John was pleasantly surprised to see how similar the contents were to Sherlock’s cabin on the
“You're sure?!” She heard rustling in the background and imagined him sitting up on his bed. “It wasn't a burn or something? I mean, he
“Yes, we will! Okay, John, I’ve got to get all this tour information confirmed with our marketing people. Talk soon.”
“I’ll let you read it when I finish,” Sherlock murmurs. He neglects to point out that John’s now repeating himself. “Goodnight.”
Sherlock met his eyes, and whatever John had been about to say vanished from his mind. The pirate looked distant, distracted, probably too worried about his wounded crew member to truly focus on John. "What is it?"
Sherlock’s lips pressed together in a thin line, and he was stepped down to stand next to John. He thrust a map into his hands and pointed to a mark. “The surgeon lives a few streets away from the docks, that way.” A long finger pointed toward a dirty street, filled with merchants. “Not the best part of town, especially at night, but I am assured this is the most knowledgeable doctor in the city. She is expecting you, and you will be well cared for. I’m sorry I cannot accompany you, but I fear I must get back to the crew…” He trailed off.
John did not look back this time, deep blue eyes fixed on Moriarty. “Very well,” he said as he slipped his gun into its holster. The grin reemerged, but this time it took the form of a challenging smirk, mischievous and ruthless all at once. “You won’t surrender? Good. I could use some sparring practice.”
John felt clumsy, uncoordinated, especially next to Sherlock. The pirate moved with such an easy grace, his sword controlled as a limb. However, the man was patient to an extent John had not predicted, though he insisted John repeat each move multiple times, scoffing and rolling his eyes each time John did not perform to his standards.
Laughter rippled through the group, but Sebastian did not join in. “Maybe I don’t like being defeated by a woman!” he barked.
“You really want me to spell it out for you? I thought you were supposed to be a genius.” John smiled at him. Teasing was good, teasing was encouraging.
, he had concealed that a convicted criminal was stalking him. And stalking John as well. For four whole weeks, Sherlock had elected to hide this information from John, acting as though everything were alright in their lives.
It wasn’t exactly peak hours, but John agreed anyway. He had a distinct feeling Sherlock had told the DI that they had fought the previous night, and so Lestrade wanted to keep an eye on them as long as possible. Not that he needed to; John felt like napping, not yelling.
“Alcohol,” she replied. “The crew wasn’t too happy at first that I used some of it for this, but once I explained, they’ve taken to setting at least a bottle aside. It’s maybe a bit silly, but it seems to help.”
John had appeared barely a minute later, in his pyjamas and looking a bit sleepy but worried. He must have fallen asleep already, though it could not have been a deep slumber for him to have heard Sherlock's text. Standing in the doorway of the bedroom, he had taken one look at Sherlock's face, then climbed into bed next to him. They didn't speak, but Sherlock immediately felt a tension in his shoulders he hadn't noticed before start to ease in John's safe, steady presence. He drifted off within minutes, the last sensation before he was gone entirely a tender press of lips to his forehead.
was well out of port. The closer to dawn he completed his mission, the more streamlined the attack would be. This was a gamble and balancing act all in one, however, for the longer Sherlock stayed on the ship before giving a signal was that much more time he could be discovered. It was a risk he was willing to take, though. After all, he was clever. He could do this. No one on board had any idea he was here—a fact which they would come to regret once they learned what damage he was doing to their ship.
He stops himself, eyes widening. John just grins. Finding out he has been stalked on the internet should not be so flattering, but from this man, it is somehow. “I think I saw it on a gravestone once, maybe in Wales? To be honest, I don’t really remember where it was; I was pretty young. But the name stuck in my head, because I’d never heard it before, and then when I got this story idea, it seemed like a good fit.”
The Royal Navy seemed… different. Whenever John would visit London now, he would inevitably find himself pulled into yet another soiree put on by the admiralty. And more and more, they referenced the New Orient Trading Programme in conversations. John hardly knew what to make of such allusions, only that he feared many of the men he knew and respected were somehow beholden to that group.
, sailing the seas and having adventures, and had he once thought of John? Had he even wanted to find him again?
“Hey, Molls,” he said several minutes later, after listening to her summarise her paper in rather painstaking detail. “Don’t stress so much. You’re brilliant, and you always pass with flying colors.”
The doors of the lift at last swung open, and John stepped out and headed down the corridor. His desk was crammed in a room with those of the other interns, but at least it was something to call his own. Hopefully he really had left the ID there…
“Thank you for telling me that,” John finally whispers. “Victor was an idiot, obviously. He didn’t deserve you. And neither did those others.”
Sherlock didn’t reply, simply watched John, still clutching his hand. John stared back, marveling at this man, the numerous revelations he had just been given reverberating in his mind. Who had ever heard of an honourable pirate, a pirate with a valid reason to do what he did, a pirate with a moral code?
He edged forward, eyes on John’s shoulder. “Your wound may need to be cleaned,” he declared. “My late ship doctor always claimed the wounds he treated healed better and faster if they were kept clear of dirt or other contaminants. If I may?”
There was the sound of movement, then soft laughter. “Perhaps I was overly optimistic about having you meet my parents.”
He watched John, who stared back. The captain made a striking silhouette, the wide ocean and clear blue skies a backdrop making his dark hair and intense eyes all the more dramatic. His shirt was something between green and blue today, open at the throat as usual and rolled up to the elbows. He wore no jacket over it, due to the heat, and his trousers were of a thin, rather close-fitting dark material.
John grimaced and nodded. "Yeah, but it should be over around half one, assuming I don't have to stay over because I'm a moron."
“I, erm, was told I ought not leave conversations hanging the way I did earlier,” Sherlock admits. He stands by the window still, hands deep in pockets.
He entered the room further and looked guiltily at Molly, though she did not appear surprised at the reception. Instead, she handed him a needle and thread.
. The shorter man pulled out before thrusting back in, hard, hitting Sherlock's prostate exactly. Sherlock couldn't quite hold back a yell.
“Is that what you think? What you want?” John forced the words past his teeth, formed them with unwilling lips. The last thing he wanted to do was to give into Sherlock’s lunacy, but he didn’t know what else to do. Looking at the pack of cocaine, all he could think of was Harry, always saying she was getting sober and always inevitably falling off the wagon again. Loving her was hard, but he was her brother, that’s what he did.
Hello my lovelies! I'm finally back home! From here on out, updates should (hopefully) be regular again.
“Yes,” he replied, lifting a hand to run one finger along John’s cheekbone, his sharp eyes catching the contrast between his pale finger and the molten gold of John’s skin. John chuckled, his eyes soft, the ocean lapping at the sandy beaches of his cheeks, before leaning forward and catching Sherlock’s lips with his own.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John said under his breath as his eyes ran over the mess of bruises scattered along his chest and stomach. His brow furrowed, however, when he encountered some old bruises. “These aren’t from today.” It wasn’t a question. He ran his fingers lightly over the yellow and green spots covering Sherlock’s side, leaving a trail of goosebumps in his wake.
A few minutes later, Sherlock still hadn’t replied and John had to help a customer who had just walked in. He put his phone away with a sigh.
“Er, why? Don’t you have school or something?” John asked somewhat halfheartedly. Sherlock gave him scathing look.
“I am clean! Well, perhaps, I wasn’t when I started the experiment, but now I am, and anyway it doesn’t matter, the police won’t listen to me, they never do. They say I’m too young, despite the fact that my IQ is higher than all of theirs combined,” Sherlock muttered darkly.
“I know who it is, now answer it,” he said wanting to be gentle, but not wanting to miss a chance to listen to the suspect. “Put it on speaker.”
Sherlock leaned in and began by kissing him slowly along his inner thighs, getting closer and closer to his cock, making John fairly scream with anticipation.
“Sorry, I forgot about that,” John said, unable to keep the smirk off his face. Sherlock looked up at him from under his thick lashes and bit down on the skin right under his collarbone. He licked at it immediately after, however, so John knew he was forgiven.
“Yes, I’m finally done,” he replied and he felt the sigh of relief against his face before Sherlock swooped down to kiss him once more. John reached up to card his hands through Sherlock’s thick curls, and was only slightly prepared for the whimper that left Sherlock’s lips when his hands reached his hair. John pulled back, amusement glinting in his eyes.
“I believe it’s crispy enough, now,” he said, looking for all the world as though everything had gone exactly as he had planned it. John couldn’t help but giggle as he took the bacon off the stove and put it on a plate.
John read the text for about the tenth time, wondering what it could possibly mean. He knew he was being ridiculous, but he felt horribly disappointed to look up and find the genius gone. He had been looking forward to the late night conversation with Sherlock.
It would get Mycroft off his back for a couple weeks about going, and might even help his boredom. Downing the last dregs of his coffee, Sherlock made his decision.
John tried to focus on studying. He really did. But they were sitting right in front of him, and every so often, Sherlock would absently run his fingers through his hair, and god if that didn’t just melt John into a puddle right there.
“Not right now, but soon. You underestimate just how…sensitive my scalp is,” he said. All of the sudden, and evil grin erupted onto John’s face.
All of the sudden, he felt a hand in his hair, carding through it lightly at first, before gripping it tightly and forcing his head back. He gasped, the feeling going straight to his already impossibly hard cock.
“John.” He lowers the cigarette, breathing out a puff of air that is equal parts smoke and vapor from the cold.
He seized a protesting Victor’s arm and launched the man into the last longboat as it began to descend.
“It’s not anachronistic!” the woman seated next to Sherlock exclaims. “It was a fairly common thing then!”
“Winter won in a fair fight,” she said. “Rematches are only valid if there was a rule of combat violated or other extenuating circumstances.”
Sherlock’s countenance had become serious, almost stern and urgent. “I shall. Have you heard anything of a specific pirate gentleman, by the name of Victor Trevor, within the last few months?”
He looked back and smiled, amused. “You are entirely unafraid, aren’t you?” He chuckled. “The name is Captain Sherlock Holmes. Welcome aboard the
Sherlock’s face, or the closest approximation John’s less-than-refined art skills could manage, stared up at him from the sheet of paper. The pirate captain was leaning against the railing of the
Sherlock’s mind freezes as one word echoes in his mind on a loop, one word that he can’t help but echo. “Yet?”
The pirate captain shook his head. “On the contrary. My brother may irk me like no other, but he is useful at times, not to mention dedicated to our goals. Victor’s cover was paramount, and providing him with a better one appears to have been the best course for his investigation. It is a logical conclusion: The less we know about one another’s plans, the better off we would be in the event one of us is captured.”
