When he was done cleaning up, Tony decided he was going to explore the rest of his house, or mansion or tower or whatever Jane and Thor had called it last night. He had only seen the lab and his bedroom and kitchen space, which wasn't too terribly different than what he'd had at his home with Steve. But this Tony in this world seemed a lot different than him, and he didn't know what to make of it. If they were truly this band of superheroes like everyone kept mentioning, then maybe he had files on them somewhere, so he could navigate this world as long as he was stuck in it. And hopefully figure out a way back, if there was one.
“No,” Natasha said. “I don’t think he was—” she was interrupted by the sound of their doorbell ringing.
And that's how his teammates found him: passed out on the couch, with a whole empty bottle of vodka on the floor beside him and a half empty bottle lying next to him on the couch. Natasha slapped him until he began to come to.
Steve frowned. “I know I can’t use it for that, Tony. No matter how much I want to, I know we have a mission on hand. I’m focused on the mission.”
Clint noisily made his presence known and he walked back into the kitchen. “Well, it looks like you two patched things up,” Clint drawled.
"Yeah, that sounds good," Tony said, not even trying to argue. He was tired and confused and hoping this was just a really vivid dream. Natasha found out he was following her and she drugged him, or something. He's gonna wake up tomorrow and his life will go back to being normal and boring, just the way he liked it.
“Yeah. We’re waiting to get married until after he finishes law school. He’s at Columbia now, absolutely killing it. He’s gonna make a great lawyer one he passes his Bar Exam.”
"What? They asked. And they won't let it go, so I just figured we'd get it over with, if you want to."
A series of emotions he couldn't suss out played across Steve's face for a brief moment, and then it was gone again. Tony wondered what he had said wrong.
Loki pursed his lips in thought for a moment. “I think not, brother. I would much rather stay here and rule Asgard than fight the man I once aligned myself with. But I wish you and your Avengers well in this war. And know if you win, you are welcome back in Asgard as long as you choose.”
“I think the term ‘friends’ is stretching it. But we’ve come to an understanding. He…may not be as terrible as I had initially expected.”
, down to his core. Frustrated because he had misjudged Tony before getting to know him. He believed all the gossip and the stupid tabloids that Tony was a self-proclaimed ladies’ man and an attention whore and wanted nothing more than to party his way through life, flashing his money around like a badge every time he got in trouble. He was frustrated because now he knew there was more to Tony than the tabloids showed. He knew Tony wasn’t the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist he claimed to be, and yet he insisted on only showing people that awful side to himself. Steve just wanted him to be real with them, that’s all.
Thor wanted to argue that his brother had let go of the Bifrost that day, and not that he’d pushed him, but arguing at this point was futile. He would not let Thanos get to him. He had to stay levelheaded and not let his temper make him decide rashly, like he always did. He had to focus today. So he bit back any comment he could have made to the contrary and simply said, “We shall see who wins, Thanos.”
"Nah, man, not a lot of time to watch movies when you're a kid in the circus and when you're out on missions for weeks at a time."
"You're wearing your glasses," she commented. He was doing that a lot now. But never when it was just the two of them. She liked to see his eyes.
“Me too,” he murmured. “We all turned out okay, despite the circumstances. That’s a pretty big accomplishment, I’d say.”
Natasha stumbled out of bed and walked down the stairs blearily to get a glass of water. She was chugging down her second glass when Steve walked into the kitchen. He crossed his arms over his chest, nose curling at the smell of alcohol.
Tony’s eyes searched around the void for the ugly purple Titan, and his eyes came upon him a ways away, just sitting down in the void with his eyes closed, like he was meditating or something.
Tony shook his head. “Figured Howard would be horrible in more than one universe. But you and your brother…you’re still intact, right? I mean, Steve and I didn’t royally fuck up or anything did we?”
"And you still married me?" Steve didn't understand why Tony would marry the other version of him. None of the girls had ever looked at him until after Project Rebirth. Why would Tony have looked at him?
Tony opened his mouth to speak again, but the stone in his hand lit up and suddenly he was back in Loki’s magic shop, blinking. He looked at Steve, then looked at the clock on the wall, and realised that no time had passed while he was in the void. Nothing was amiss.
“I’m here,” he said automatically. He was beginning to realise his surroundings. He was in a room. A warehouse maybe? No, a workshop. His workshop. In Avengers tower. He was in his workshop, seated at his computer, with Jane Foster and Thor Odinson standing above him. He was in his body, but he wasn’t, at the same time. Tony could see himself, eyes slightly unfocused, not really coherent.
“Indeed. The name Tony Stark means something in the multiverse. You know, I’ve met another version of you before. I hope he’s doing well.”
“Why not?” Steve asked, exasperated. “We have a real chance to save one of our own! Why can’t be take it?”
"I don't know," Tony said honestly. "I'm assuming since Steve was never a part of that whole super soldier thing, he never tried to recreate the serum and the gamma accident never happened."
And so he did. Tony didn’t know how he did it, but above their heads, an aircraft came into view. It came down to Earth and landed in the space not far from where their battle was taking place. Two women exited the spacecraft and walked towards them. One of them was a woman with green skin and a look on her face that seemed displeased with her surroundings. The other woman had blue skin, and looked like she was made of little different bits of machinery. Tony got FRIDAY to scan her, and found out she was indeed made up of mechanical pieces that had replaced her real body parts. He couldn’t even begin to guess why. He was pretty sure he didn’t
Steve shook his head. “Thanos already has one of the stones. We have another, in case you’ve forgotten all this universe hopping.”
Jane and Thor cast another look at each other. "Yes, Steve exists in this world," Jane reassured him. "You saw him with the shield, remember? He and all of your friends, your group, live here with you."
“Fine, then you don’t get a stone to control,” Tony quipped. “But you do remember your powers came from one of those stones, right?”
Steve and Tony looked at each other again. They knew there was more to the story than that, but they kept their mouths shut.
Nat's little brother Bucky was, thankfully, on a play date with some friend named Sam that he'd met in pre-school. She was just happy she didn't have to deal with her annoying little brother for a night, especially since she was nervous for her dads to meet Matt. It's not that Matt was a bad guy, or that that she was embarrassed by him or anything, she just wanted to keep her private life and her friends away from her parents.
Tony sighed. “I guess I’m taking your computer away, too. Do I need to set parental controls or have you learned your lesson?”
Clint made that a little easier on her claiming he really had to pee and heading off towards her bathroom.
They held on for a few more seconds and then Natasha groaned, pulling back. “I’m gonna go see if I can catch up with Matt. Text me when we’re all meeting up later tonight.”
“Uh huh. And you were born in the 1940s and went through from kind of super soldier program during World War II that cured all of your illnesses and make you really buff and apparently hot. And then you were frozen in ice for 70 years and then came back to life.”
He didn’t know why he knew things about this world. Why it seemed so familiar. He was Tony Stark, husband and father. Why did he have memories of a life where he was a superhero? A dream of a different world with robots and aliens raining from the sky? People with magical powers? Why did it feel so real? Tony was only dreaming. Thor and Jane weren’t real. He wasn’t really an Avenger.
And without waiting for a response, Tony entered the passcode to get back into his lab, shut the door behind him, and sunk onto the couch, praying he could just shut the world away for a little bit.
Tony shrugged. “To be honest, we haven’t really spoken much since the Ultron thing happened. I think she’s frustrated with my lifestyle. She doesn’t like being put in the middle of feuding superheroes and villains. I don’t think she belongs in this world.”
Vision perused the e-mail and nodded. “This seems like a decent plan. Tony, do you have a way to re-map my neurons?”
In fact, Steve would be. For now, he would hold his tongue and try to get along with Tony best he could. After they defeated Thanos, then they could get everything out in the open, come to some kind of understanding. It seemed that the other Tony and Steve had actually learned how to communicate with each other in healthy way, and that’s why their relationship worked. Maybe if he and this Tony talked, they would actually become friends. Steve and Tony were never going to be a couple in this world, but at least they didn’t have to be at each other’s throats all the time.
“No,” Natasha told her younger self. “While he was sealing Hela in her underworld tomb, Frigga and Heimdall took the stones and scattered them throughout the universe again. Odin never tried to find the stones again, and instead kept the infinity gauntlet in the weapons room I guess as a trophy.”
“He and I were friends long before you were ever born.” Steve sighed. “Long story short, I grew up in another time period. Crashed my plane in the ocean during World War II, and spent the next 70 years trapped in ice but still alive.”
That night, as he lay in bed with skinny Steve wrapped around him like a starfish, Tony carding his fingers through his hair, (what? Just because he was with Pepper in his own universe didn’t mean he had to be an asshole and deny his husband something comforting in this one. It wasn’t like he was cheating; it was just fingers in this guy’s hair.) he wondered how the hell he was going to defeat this force trying to destroy them all. And worse, how he was going to make it back to his own universe so he could warn his team of their impending doom.
Thanos continued his ugly leer, but it took more of a condescending dip to it. “I’ve fought much braver, stronger, and honourable men than the Avengers, my child. However, none of them have amused me as much as you have. Perhaps after I control the stones, our paths will cross again.”
Natasha shrugged. “I asked around for anyone who had any authentic Asgardian history books, did a little bit of hacking, and found something I wasn’t supposed to see. This sidekick Odin had? Was his daughter, Hela.”
“After that crazy mission I spent all night talking to him on the phone and then like last week Pietro found out that Crystal was cheating on him with some older guy named Norman Webster. He broke up with her and I took my chances on asking him out on a date. He said yes, of course.”
“So four out of six, and we somehow have to get the fifth one away from Thanos and locate the last one.”
Steve perked up at the last one. “The multiverse? That’s access to all of reality? Different timelines and universes?”
Steve snorted. “Telling me not to stare at him is not the same thing as telling me your boyfriend’s blind.”
“Wanda.” Wanda cautiously shook young Natasha’s hand. “You two should come up to the common area. We’ve all set up base there.”
I promise I meant to get this out sooner...and then life happened. In this scene, Steve remembers meeting the other Tony in his universe, but Tony has no recollection of these events and he's meeting Steve for the first time. Confusing, but timelines and time travel still kind of blows my mind, even though I chose to write a whole fanfiction centred around it.
Steve though it was such a shame that all of the aliens, sans Thor it seemed, didn’t seem to have the best intentions. Bucky sometimes came home from work on the days when Steve was too sick to get out of bed and brought home whatever books he could afford at the time. Sometimes they were science fiction books written by Olaf Stapleton or the horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. Steve sort of guessed if Earth ever made contact with humans, it wouldn’t be as…bloody and violent as it was in reality. He thought after everything he’d seen in the war he would have been disillusioned by everyone in general, but he still had that optimism intact. He hated being proven wrong when it came to aliens wanting to take over their homeland. Earth was theirs to protect.
The bell rang and they both groaned. Natasha walked Matt to his classroom. "I'll see you at lunch," she said. "Probably. If Clint doesn't want me."
Steve took a couple of calming breaths. “I see where you’re coming from Tony, but I’m sorry, I can’t agree with you on this one. I say we save Natasha, take Thanos down, and then destroy the stones. Just this once, and we never used them for our own gain again. Just once.”
“Or we can see if this plan works, then we can use the time stone to go back before he murdered Natasha, do it all over again, and then call Fury so he can decide what we do with him.”
Natasha thought about going after him, but then decided he needed to cool down. Besides, she was probably the last person he needed to see. If only Phil Coulson were alive, they’d have someone to diffuse the situation. Coulson was always good at talking both her and Clint down from a ledge when they needed it. It’s what made him such a great handler. Alas, that was gone and done, no thanks to Loki.
Thor called on Heimdall to open the Bifrost and with a rainbow flash he was gone from the place he once stood.
“Thank you, brother.” He clasped Loki’s forearm and watched as his brother walked out of his room and down the corridor to his chambers.
“I’m not—” Tony sighed. “I’m not trying to treat you like you’re five, Nat. I promise. If you were 18, this would be a totally different discussion. But you’re not. And I’m not having a kid fight this battle against a mad Titan us adults don’t even know if we can defeat. Okay?”
Heimdall bowed his head in assent and led him away from his post into a more comfortable setting. “What is it you wish to know?” Heimdall asked.
Tony shook his head slowly. He was trying to remember the details, trying to find that world that he was in. Something about...robots? A suit of armour? Super soldiers frozen in ice? A shield painted like the American flag? "I...I think we were superheroes," Tony said eventually. "I was in a suit made of metal, and you...had enhanced strength. They called you Captain America...you were biologically enhanced."
“Can we go back to the conversation at hand?” Steve asked. “Thor, you said the gauntlet was fake. What happened to the real one?”
"Took your morning meeting with the board. They're deliberating on the new energy bill. Should come to a consensus around lunch time. I'm gonna need your approval and signature on the paperwork."
Tony turned the burner off and put a plate of pancakes on the island. He got out the maple syrup and helped Bucky cut up his pancakes into bite sized pieces so he could eat it better.
Loki frowned. “Well, I suppose. Studies of the multiverse aren’t really my area of expertise. You’d have to ask my sister in law Jane about that.”
Tony spluttered. “Uh, excuse me? Where’s the daughter that argues with me over everything and tells me I’m ruining her life when I try to punish her?”
respond to the call when the fate of the Earth was on the line. So he fought along with other people, simple humans, who never asked for this responsibility, or even really maybe
“You don’t understand, Nat. I can’t breathe without you. Do you get that? There’s been so much shit in my life. So much hurt. I’m not a good person. But you make me believe I can be. You’re the only one who’s ever believed in me, the real me. Who’s ever understood me the way I need to be understood. You’re my best friend. I don’t know how to go through life without you.”
“Yes you can. You remember the technique I was teaching you? Try closing your eyes and focusing your hearing on my heartbeat. That’s really all you need to be able to tell if someone is lying or not.”
“Two months, give or take,” Tony informed her. “I called your school and told them about Bucky and requested your teachers give you work to take home while you’re on a hiatus, so you didn’t miss much.”
Natasha stayed focused, though, even if she was confused. "Tony, you're not married to Steve, okay? He was frozen in ice 20 years ago."
When Natasha walked out the door that afternoon to take the train to wherever she, Matt, and Clint were meeting up, Tony followed her. He left a note on the fridge for Steve to tell him he was working on a project and would be home later that evening and not to worry, and tailed Natasha. The three teens met outside an abandoned warehouse. He tried to get close to see what they were doing in there without giving it away he was spying.
Tony huffed. “Yeah, but he also annoys the living crap out of me. He acts like he’s some boy scout, that he has some kind of moral high ground over the rest of us. It’s like no matter what I do, he’s not going to like any decision I make because it’s not the way he would have done it.”
“Are you okay?” Natasha’s voice cracked over comms system. She’d grimaced as she watched the footage from Tony’s HUD display, still annoyed she couldn’t be there to wipe that stupid smirk off that purple asshole’s face.
They ate at the kitchen table and talked some more about hobbies and interests, future career goals, and the like. True to their words, her dads weren't being too embarrassing or awful and seemed to genuinely like Matt, which was a good thing for her. They didn't bombard him with questions about his dad's death or him being blind. Instead, they treated him like they would anyone else.
“Okay,” she said. “It won’t happen again. And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for what happened between us, and I’m sorry I didn’t listen to what you were trying to say.”
you kick Thanos’s ass? Doesn’t it make more sense to wait until after since he’s gotta use the stone to defeat him?”
Tony blinked up at Natasha, abandoning his work. “Big ass purple dude with some seriously weird chin action going on?” he asked.
The Maximoff twins, Wanda and Pietro, grew up in a Romani household in Transia before their house caught fire and their family got caught in the flames. They were forced to move in with their ex-convict father, the infamous Erik Lehnsherr, and his daughter Lorna. Their accents and their Jewish/Roma heritage didn't win them any favours. Pietro hated his father and Wanda was mentally unstable but the nicest person you'd ever meet.
Tony approached the chair she was sitting in, and knelt down until he was eyelevel with her. “What if I told you I won’t destroy the reality gem once we send you back to your world? Would that help?”
Thor was back to his proud self. "Yes, my friend! I thought you were a sorcerer when we first met! The talking ceiling was most fascinating! JARVIS sees and hears everything and can talk back! He can do things for us, like order groceries or take your phone calls for you. He's incredible! Was incredible."
Tony cleared his throat. “No, I know. I’m just stopping in on my way back to the hospital. Natasha’s gonna have to take some time off from work. Bucky was in an accident and it’s not looking too good at the moment.”
Hours later, and lots of yelling of concern and one too many drinks, Tony was fitting himself for sleep. He needed rest. Like, a decent good night's sleep that didn't involve images of his best friends dying or robots invading the world or crazy power wielding goths who can get in your mind and bend reality.
Tony shrugged. “Yeah, why not? We’re all on the same side here, want the best for Vision, so on and so forth. No need to argue about it.”
Tony sighed. "Yeah, but she's not the same. She's...unstable at best right now, really. It's gonna take a lot of work to make me like her. What's up with you and your merry band of new Avengers?"
He didn't wake up in Steve's arms. He woke up, by himself, in his bedroom at this tower, in the world that was and wasn't his own simultaneously. He was homesick for something that probably never really existed at all. And didn't that fucking suck.
Thor put his hammer down on the ground and crouched next to Tony, studying the man. “I do not understand. You and the Captain are not married in this world? You are dating Miss Potts.”
“This guy named Alexander Pierce approached me and my friends, said he was from this secret government facility called S.H.I.E.L.D. He basically told us to train so that when we graduated he could recruit us into the program, and that he’d give us a trial run with a mission we had to complete.”
“No!” Thor said, panic in his voice. “You don’t know what the dungeons of Asgard did to my brother, the torture he endured! I won’t sentence Thanos to that.”
“Loki is on Asgard?” Thor dared not get his hopes up at the thought of his brother still being close to home. He had thought his brother dead at one point, only to find out he had survived slipping into the void. He did not fall for that ploy again after Jane was possessed by the Aether. He knew his brother was alive and well, free from the chains that had once bound him. He had no idea his brother had stayed in Agard, however, as much as he hoped to have been able to speak with him again.
“Excellent!” Thor informed. “She is back in London working but I have informed her of our events. She wishes us all luck and has ordered me to stay on Earth with her after this is all over.”
It was Tony. This world’s Tony? He was not cruel enough to believe the Tony from the other world would be heartless enough not to care about a bleeding five year old, but he didn’t know how this whole…parallel world thing worked. Did his Tony get transported here and the other Tony get stuck in his world, or no? The science was kind of making his brain hurt a little bit.
“Great,” Natasha said. “So he’ll be on his way to Earth to retrieve the stones. He must have some way to tell where the stones are?”
Wanda opened her mouth to respond when Clint called out to them. “Guys, there’s nothing we can do about this situation tonight. We probably shouldn’t mess with anything until FRIDAY says we can. We should just watch a movie or something instead.”
The two lapsed into silence again as Tony kept driving to Loki’s magic shop. He pulled in and killed the engine, took in a shuddering breath.
"No. For all we know, I don't exist in your world. But here, on this world, we know each other pretty well. I'm Jane Foster. We talk science together. And when you're not busy running your own company, you're well...you're a superhero."
Thanos nodded. “I like this General Kodos. He and I have a shared value and goal in mind. Mine is just on a larger scale.”
Karen's mom worked all the time to distract herself from the fact her son was killed in a car accident, her husband was an abusive alcoholic and a drug addict, and to ignore the fact her daughter was headed in the same direction.
"I'm sure, at least," Clint said. "So I exist, right? I'm still like a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and stuff?"
Tony sighed. “Fine. I’ll hook up my HUD camera to the tower so you can see everything I see in the field, okay?”
They all replied with groans and death glares, but not surprisingly took him up on his offer. Soon as everyone had coffee mugs in front of them and enough breakfast food to go around and they were all seated at the kitchen table, Tony decided to take the plunge and just get it over with.
But he was good at what he did, and so he eased into the file without a hitch, and there were the names of every single member of the Avengers in alphabetical order: Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff, Steve Rogers, Thor Odinson, and Tony Stark.
Natasha took a deep breath and looked at herself in the mirror. She looked...kind of hot. Clint called her mature looking, and she guessed that was true. She traded in her usual look of crop top and high waisted jeans for a silk blouse and a pencil skirt and heels. Her normally straight hair was curled in beach waves that framed her face. She tucked the hair behind her ears. She had been letting it grow out for the past few months.
“I know, but I swear it’s true there.” Natasha took a bite of her waffles and chewed before speaking again. “You and Dad were different, but good different. I think I’m really gonna miss them.”
Pepper. Okay? I just…found him like that. It’s fucking sickening. Who does that? Who leaves a five year old fucking bleeding in the street like that? Who’s so fucking heartless like that?”
"I promise. I haven't had any run-ins with Happy since the divorce was finalised last week. I'm just trying to take one day at a time."
It did come as somewhat of a shock to Thor that, as promised, the next day Loki did give him the stone. Thor had woken up that morning, had a breakfast feast in the hall as he caught up with his friends. He kept an eye out for those coming and going in the hall, but Loki was absent entirely. After breakfast, he took the time to walk around Asgard, visit its people and its shops to see what had changed since he’d last encountered them.
Karen laughed. "I thought about it. But Matt, even if he's not judging you, you know he disapproves of your actions. He does it all the time. I'm not trying to hate on your boyfriend, but he's just a really good guy. He believes in justice and the law and God and I just feel...lesser in his presence for not putting my trust in any of those things. He'll want to tell the authorities and he'll just make the situation worse. You know how to keep your mouth shut."
Tony let out a heavy sigh. “Are we done talking now? You’re boring me. I’d rather we get to the fighting now.”
Loki shrugged.  “Sure, be my guest.” He got the reality stone off the wall behind him and handed it to Tony.
“I don’t know why Steve hates me so much here,” Steve heard Tony say. “And I don’t know how the universe can decide to make us hate each other in this world and literally be married to each other in another. I mean, how does that even work? Is it that thing where the choices we make in life matter, and if he and I had made different choices in our life we might like each other more in this world?”
Natasha looked at Tony with wide eyes. “S.H.I.E.L.D. exists in your universe? They’re some kind of secret government facility?”
“Hey, kid,” Tony said quietly behind her. Natasha’s breath shuddered and tears started to spill over her cheeks as she turned to look at him.
"Amen to that," Natasha said under her breath. Her cell phone buzzed and she took it out of her pocket, smiling as she texted someone back.
“Something did not sit right with me after my visit to Asgard, so after I collected the stones, I went back to Asgard and had a conversation with Heimdall. He told me the full story, which I see you all have learned as well.”
Steve smiled at him crookedly. "Yeah, it's me. You were having another nightmare. You all right there?"
Ah, shoot. I realised I forgot to post the last chapter and the epilogue. My bad. It's up now. Months late. Sorry to anyone who actually read this garbage.
Thanos smiled slowly, a big, ugly, devious grin that made Tony’s mouth go dry and his body shrink inward. The dude was terrifying.
“You may not be getting lucky tonight, Legolas, but robot and witchy over there probably are,” Tony whispered.
The girl (Natasha?) stared at him some more. “Dad,” she said calmly, “What happened? You were sober for longer than I’ve been alive. What…does Daddy know?”
“So, Tasha,” Tony said. “The younger one,” he clarified when both Natashas turned to look at him. “What’s up in your world? With the situation you were in? Any updates?”
"No. She's always just been my best friend." Excluding that drunk party, but Tony was not about to reveal that to these people he didn't even really know.
Karen sighed again and sat down on Nat's bed. She followed. "Foggy...doesn't understand. He has a good life. A normal family. Lots of prying sisters and a mom who actually gives a shit. It's good to have that kind of support from his family, but...I don't know, sometimes it's just too much for me to handle, you know? I don't want everyone in my business about it."
The team found themselves drawn to each other that night, doing what they normally did on a night when they were all stuck together: make food, gather around the living area, and watch some good movies. Clint had found the fridge stocked with beers and Steve busies himself making a dish he knew everyone would enjoy, and they all gathered around, waiting for Tony to make his presence known.
Childhood: Natasha was taken away from her parents, assumed murdered, when she was a baby in order to serve the Soviet Union. She was born and bred into an assassin in the Red Room. She was trained every day to fight, to kill, how to manipulate to get what she wants. She was bred to be a killer. Her mind was also altered, as well as her physical chemistry, with a modified version of the Project Rebirth serum. Memories of being a ballerina in Bolshoi and an entire family and life were implanted in her mind that never happened. Her graduation ceremony was sterilisation.
Natasha smiled softly. “Nah, you guys are just the regular embarrassing kind of parents. No major trauma here. Or well, no trauma from you. Not that I can remember it.”
Jane put a hand on Thor's chest. "No, we can't, sweetie. Remember, JARVIS is no longer with us, yeah?"
and no one had believed him. He was just trying to protect the world, and all the got was flak for it. A typical day in his life, but at least he was right. At least he knew there was something out there that needed fighting.
Natasha tried not to look at Matt as she talked about the mission. He’d told her it was stupid and dangerous, and she hadn’t listened. They had a lot to talk about, and she wasn’t sure what to start with. Or when she would ever catch him alone long enough to talk through all of their issues.
Wanda’s red magic flared in the air and then dissipated as she turned to look at Tony. “I still can’t figure out a way to remove it without hurting Vision. I contacted someone who might know more about the situation than I do. I am just waiting to hear back from them.”
“Geez,” Natasha said. “The other version of my dad said you were bigger from the super soldier serum, but this is
Tony sighed. “Do you think we can defeat him? Just us, without the power the stones can provide us with?”
“Yeah, the one and only. You remodelled it after grandpa died and changed it from a weapons manufacturer to a clean energy resource facility.”
“No, I don’t know. I want you to be able to go home safely to your dads in your own universe. I will not be responsible for your death, you hear me?”
"Ooookay," Clint said. "Can we talk about something else? Like why I'm deaf or if Natasha still has red hair in that world or who our other friends are?"
“The gauntlet in my father’s weapons room was a fake,” Thor said as he entered the room, a rainbow bridge appearing along with him.
"Ugh," Tony heard from the stairs. "You guys are so gross!" Natasha complained. She walked into the kitchen, ruffled her younger brother's hair, and opened the fridge and got out the carton of orange juice. "Pancake day?" she asked Tony.
Steve shrugged, but Wanda’s voice chimed in over the comms. “Like Nat said, use the stones to trick his mind into seeing something different. Who’s using the reality stone?”
“I can travel back to Asgard and ask around,” Thor said. “Heimdall sees all. Surely he knows there this other stone is.”
"Well, I don't know. I suppose so," Jane said. "I don't see why you wouldn't be." She sighed. "Why don't you get some sleep? We'll figure this out when we wake up in the morning. Maybe you'll remember something in a dream again, or you can talk to the rest of your team tomorrow and they can fill in some blanks that we can't."
Clint saluted her and disappeared into the crowd, leaving Natasha alone with her part of the mission.
Wade scanned the crowd until he found Peter. "Peter, buddy, wait up!" he said before taking off in a blur of red.
Clint watched again as Tony held on to Steve, flinging him at Thanos’s face. Steve, again, bashed in Thanos’s face with his shield as Tony took his place on Thanos’s arm. Thor flew Wanda close enough to control Thanos’s mind, while Vision and Natasha kept an eye on the situation, ready to jump in at a moment’s notice if the situation went sideways.
“One of you chopping off his hand so you can steal the infinity gauntlet?” Natasha piped up. “Think about it, it’s kind of perfect. Steve can…I don’t know, chop it off with his shield or Tony, you can burn it off with your beam things and then just take the gauntlet. And then that leaves him wounded enough for the others to stop him.”
When the doorbell rang, she jumped out of her seat as fast as she could and got to the door before either of her parents knew what was going on. She opened it and smiled nervously at the two men on her doorstep. "Hey, Foggy. Thanks for driving him."
After a few minutes and as the object started to take shape, Steve reared back in surprise and almost threw the sketchbook across the room. He could see in the dark shape of the eyes, in the dense muscles, in the light that coalesced from the chest. Why in the world was Steve Rogers drawing Tony Stark?
She was still glaring at him murderously, but eventually agreed. “Fine. Steve and I will go do some research to see if this kind of thing has happened before.”
Natasha waited while it sunk in to her parents that Matt was blind. She was dating a blind guy. Completely not what they were expecting, but they didn't let it rattle them too much. They just shared their customary glance at each other like they were reading each other's minds, and then turned back to their daughter and her boyfriend.
“Dad, it’s worth it. You know it is. And besides, the other you is smart. If I get stuck there, he can find a way to send me back.”
“Let’s get him into a holding cell and knock him the fuck out until we know what to do with him. And the we’re going to have a nice, long debriefing session that none of you are allowed to skip and you’re all gonna tell me what the fuck you all were thinking.”
He took a few moments to focus his mind, gain purchase of who he was, details he remembered, and ground himself in reality. When he stopped hyperventilating, he remembered the voice, felt hands pushing his hair away from his eyes, stroking it, and whispering to him. He looked up at the voice, in a daze at the blond hair and deep blue eyes, like every fantasy of his had just come true. "Steve?" he murmured.
“In my world, Buck fell from a train during World War II and lost his arm. He had some brain damage as well, lost some of his memories. My world is bleeding into yours. I’m so sorry.”
Steve chewed his lip for a minute, debating about whether to speak up or not, and decided it was worth it to bring it up. “Do we know what will happen if we destroy all of the stones so no one else tries to wield their power? The universe created them for a reason. If we get rid of all of them, will it have lasting consequences?”
She and her group of friends were all a little screwed up in the best ways. They generally called themselves the Merry Band of Misfits, because they all just fit in with each other, while the rest of the school looked at them like they were weird. There was no judgment there with any of them.
Tony nodded. "That was in my dream. Everything felt so real there. I was a superhero and so was Steve. He had like an American flag on a shield. And I think Bucky wasn't a kid because he had a metal arm, and he shot Natasha once. She was a Russian assassin, not my daughter. We were part of a group together. I don't remember what we were called."
Steve chuckled. “I was thinking of going tomorrow, after you’ve slept and showered and checked in on Bucky. Yeah?”
“The beginning of Vision’s distraction,” Tony told him. “We can still use that as a cover for me to fly you up to him and attack. We do everything the same way. Steve attacking, Wanda controlling him, me chopping of his hand, Thor destroying the gauntlet. Understand?”
Steve doubted he would, but he agreed anyway, just because he was too tired to argue with Clint right then. So he shut his mouth, allowed Clint to order them all pizza, accepted the tea Natasha made him, and pretended that his mind wasn’t searching for every possible outcome to end this conflict with the mad Titan.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know what kind of a man Howard became, but I don’t think he was a positive influence for either Tony.”
“Yeah, but we’re retaining our memories when we go back in time. So this time we know how to stop Thanos and we can repeat everything we did to capture him.”
“Sure, Legolas. Go pick out a movie.” Tony was exhausted. Trying to save the world without all the details was the worst.
Tony was silent. Then, “Rhodey does. I met him in college, so he was there when my parents died, when I went off the deep end. He always saw past the mask. He called me out on my shit. He was the one that would sit up with me when the nightmares got bad, or help me control my breathing when I had a panic attack. He’s the first person who’s ever told me he didn’t want my money, he just wanted to hang out with me, and that was enough.”
“I do. But you’re going to do it anyway. I’m trying to be supportive of the fact all my friends are in a super-secret club of future assassins.”
Tony sighed heavily. “Nat, what if I am myself around them and they don’t like me? Okay, not just Steve, but the rest of the team? What if they only like me because I can buy them cool things and make them cool weapons and give them a cool place to live? What if I’m completely myself with them and they decide they hate who I am?”
“Okay. If you think of a way we can beat this son of a bitch that we didn’t think, or in the heat of the moment notice something coming at us that we don’t, let us know. We could use your observing skills.”
Thor set off that night to Knowhere with a newfound love for his brother, and a hope that one day he wouldn’t mend their relationship, but rather build it into something better in the future.
The more Tony stared at the girl, the more he began to recognise her: the green eyes, the red hair, the stance…
“I don’t know,” Natasha said. “It’s not like any of us have killed anyone yet. We’re just planning on taking the law into our own hands when it’s needed. The law can’t take care of everything, Matt. I know you and Foggy have wanted to be lawyers your whole lives, but you can’t save everyone.
Loki’s eyes flashed green. “Or maybe I enjoyed the chaos he represented. Maybe I wanted to see your precious Earth burn.”
“Okay. So once the gauntlet is destroyed and Wanda’s mind controlling him into being still, you’re gonna come in Clint.”
“Let FRIDAY scan them for their powers and composition so we can figure out which stone Thanos has in his arsenal. Then we can come up with a plan to defeat him and use the stones against him. Once he’s been defeated, you can have at it.”
Tony peered at it, then grabbed the yellow stone from Steve’s hands aggressively, turning it over and over in the palm of his hand. “I know this,” he said. “Loki sells this in his store. He sells more like it, in different colours. They all do different things, or so he claims. I don’t remember what yellow represented but…this is definitely the stone from his store. An Infinity Stone, I think he called it.”
Suddenly the door to Tony’s lab burst open with a flash of red. Wanda walked in, hands raised, and then dropped her magic as soon as she saw Steve.
When Tony was finally up the next day around noon with the worst hangover of his life, he ventured into the kitchen for some paracetamol, a glass of water, and like four cups of coffee. He was in the process of preparing himself a cup when he noticed the Avengers huddled together, asleep on the couch and on the floor in the entertainment centre, the menu screen for the movie
The Avengers braced themselves as Thanos came to a stop right in front of him. Thanos was tall, big, and a distinct purpleish pink colour. He had on battle clothes, as well as the infinity gauntlet on his arm, and was smiling condescendingly as he towered over the petty humans. He was confident he would win this war. After all, he did conquer many other planets before this one. Gaining control of the entire multiverse, to him, seemed like a piece of cake. His biggest conquest yet.
He pulled the younger Natasha into his arms for hug. Shit, he knew he wasn’t her Tony, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to protect her.
“How’s that? Gonna use your superhero powers to track down the asshole that did this and kill them or somethin’?”
“Yes, trust me. Not that long ago in my world we found out HYDRA had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. back when it was founded and had been growing in strength since. Pierce was the head of HYDRA until you and Steve took him down.”
“It’s just…Loki’s not a good guy where I’m from. He’s kind of an evil alien sorcerer who tried to rule Earth and stuff…”
"I'm pretty sure you did exist! Natasha worked at a magic shop your brother Loki owns. So if he's on Earth and human and everything, you probably are too."
He silently slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink from the fridge. Steve was on the sofa, flipping through some sketchbooks of his husband’s. Tony wondered if this Steve was an artist, too.
Jane and Thor helped him find his way to his bedroom (this tower was fucking huge! How many fucking floors did they need?) and after brushing his teeth and getting into some comfortable clothes, he collapsed onto his bed, praying when he woke up it would be in Steve's arms.
Maybe it was naive for Natasha and her friends to think they could make New York a safer place. But people she knew were buying drugs, were overdosing, on the drugs that Fisk was providing the city with. Karen included. Her father was a deadbeat who used to work for Fisk and gets his drugs as long as he kept his mouth shut, and what had been happening with her friend lately had been freaking her the fuck out. Karen could lie to her and pretend she wasn’t using, but Natasha knew the truth. She was going to be damned in Fisk took another friend from her. Not after Elektra.
“Did you really think you could beat us?” Tony asked, shooting a repulsor beam right into his face. The blast knocked him onto his back, and once again Wanda was using her magic to keep Thanos under her thumb and docile.
Wanda continued to glare at him, but didn’t argue any further. Natasha stayed to see Vision go under. She helped Tony painstakingly disconnect the neuron paths that kept the stone wired to his mainframe. After a long few hours, they were allowed to remove the stone without killing him. Wanda wouldn’t let either one of them touch him, and she removed the stone gently, with her scarlet magic guiding the way. Once it was removed, she and Tony loaded his mind back to his mainframe, making sure he worked the same as he did with the stone in.
He brought up the home screen and clicked into the files drive, searching for what he was looking for. He found a folder marked "Avengers Initiative" and started from there. The file was locked, of course. Why wouldn't it be? Tony was at a loss for a password since, hey, not his life here, so he just ran an algorithm to hack in (ha, hacking into his own files. He used to do that when he was 10 in order to improve his security system).
“Well, I was wondering if you can tell me about the stones, on the wall over there.” Tony nodded to the wall with six stones of all different colours. "Did the colours mean something special?”
“I guess. Probably he can. I’ve got a sizable piece of land I bought a few years back. It was supposed to be a secluded area for weapons testing back when I was still in the weapons business, but never actually built anything. It’s just a flat 600 acres or so of easy terrain for us to fight him on. We could easily get there and wait for him to come to us.”
Natasha smirked. "I'm sure I can talk my way out of any trouble. But that reminds me, my dads want to meet you. Tonight...for dinner?"
That was the last thing Jane wanted. Thor went back to Asgard and there was no telling when she was going to see her elusive boyfriend again.
The Avengers were at a bit of a standstill as they learned how to properly use the gems to their advantage, fighting with them until they were semi-confident that they would be able to use them as an aid in defeating Thanos. Tony let the younger Natasha run different simulations provided by FRIDAY for them and calculate what their strengths and weaknesses were. Clint was not happy about them using the stones instead of destroying them, but Tony argued they needed the reality gem at least to help Natasha get back to her own world, and that Wanda still hadn’t successfully detached the stone from Vision’s head.
“Sort of? Your dads wouldn’t tell us anything that was going on. We thought you were dead. Your boyfriend almost broke my nose when he punched me.”
Sure, he’d failed to secure Earth the first time around, but it was really rather foolish of him to place his trust in a bunch of disposable Chitauri soldiers and that blasted, slippery God of Chaos. This time, he wasn’t trusting anyone but himself to get the job done.
Nat arched an eyebrow. "You two were discussing when his dad and Mr Xavier were going to admit their feelings for each other and hook up."
“What if this is our last night alive?” Clint asked. “I mean, the world can’t end tomorrow, can it? I can’t die without having sex one last time.”
"So I'm...what? Skinny Steve there? Five foot four with enough medical issues to fill a whole book?"
Tony shrugged again, this time at ease. "Okay," he said easily. "I'm sure I have a really good lawyer, anyway. Apparently I'm rich and everything, so..."
"Why didn't you call Foggy? He's your boyfriend. Aren't you supposed to talk to him about this kind of stuff?"
“I am the one who proposed and carried out the decision,” Thanos informed Tony. “That has become my job. I go to planets that are suffering and sacrifice half the population in order to keep the rest of the population alive.”
Steve didn’t know why he brought his art supplies with him. He hadn’t had need of it for a long time. He started to draw when he first woke up from the ice, but this future, these people…it left his passionless. Out of ideas. He hadn’t drawn since that day he teamed up with the Avengers.
He placed the pizza boxes on the island and got out paper plates for them to eat off of. Natasha burst down the stairs, phone still attached to her ear. "Hey, can Karen come over?" she asked.
“Hold up, your evil murderous brother is controlling your home planet? After everything that he did?” Clint burst.
As the coffee pot gurgled, the Avengers began to stir, starting with Clint and trickling down to the rest of the group. Tony snuck back into the kitchen, the coffee pot full to its limits with the strongest amount of coffee he could make. When he turned back around, the group was all making their way towards him.
“That’s not what I’m saying,” Wanda interrupted. “I just think this gives Thanos an easier chance to steal the stones from us.”
Tony's mouth went dry. No, really, what kind of a person was this Tony Stark? He didn't think he liked him very much. "I didn't do anything, Pep," he said in a small voice. "I'm sorry I tried to be nice. I won't do it again."
“Yep. The guy is certifiable. Apparently it’s like his job, or something. I don’t know, the guy is insane. But he’s from your universe. I think he’s attacked your Earth before.”
“Yes, that is most troublesome. Perhaps I will stay here until her research is finished and then take her up to Asgard with me. She deserves a break, no?”
Steve asked Matt a few more questions about being Catholic, how he was liking high school, and how he and Natasha got together (which embarrassed the hell out of her), but the more polite her parents were, the more she relaxed. It helped Matt was squeezing her hand in reassurance and remaining calm throughout the entire meeting.
reference. This general guy on the colony Tarsus IV did the same thing after most of their crops were destroyed by a fungus. So he rounded up half the population and murdered them so the rest of the population wouldn’t starve to death.”
“Hit and run. He was just lying there in the middle of the road. No one said or did anything. He was just lying there and….” He sighed heavily again, raking his hand through his hair. “Anyway, he’s out of surgery now. His left arm had to be amputated and there was some brain trauma, so they don’t know if he’ll wake up and if he does what the extent of the damage will be.”
“You’re not going to do it,” Tony said. “You don’t have all the stones. And there’s no way in hell that you’re getting all of them.”
“Does Steve know you’re not destroying the stone?” He was gonna be pissed if he found out Tony kept different rules for himself and not the other Avengers.
Tony shrugged. “Sure. Until I build a machine that lets me jump into the multiverse and visit different worlds. I’m gonna miss you, and I’m not ready to say goodbye.”
Natasha didn’t think so, but she didn’t comment further. She waited to see how the fight was going to pan out. She had confidence in the Avengers. After all, it was all of them plus the stones against one alien. He hadn’t brought backup. He was alone. And it wasn’t like all those stupid action movies where the good guy was teamed up against like ten bad guys and he defeats them all because they all came at him one by one, allowing him to effectively win. All of the bad guys would be descending upon Thanos all at once. In what universe did he think he was going to win?
Clint shook his head. “I don’t know.” He took out his phone and texted Frank, then dialled Pierce, filling him in on the events. Pierce gave them a rendezvous location, and they were off for a debriefing.
"Will you please just humour your old man for a second? Your other father's been worried about you coming home pregnant and he's too scared to talk to you about protection and I just want to make sure you're being...safe."
Tony laughed. "Actually, I think you're crushing on some guy named Pietro, but he has a girlfriend."
Seemed like this Tony was a better version, too. Lighter. Happier. Maybe he could use a dose of that. Maybe he could learn from his mistakes and let himself settle down with Pepper and be happy in his own world. Maybe, after all this shit was done and dealt with, he could retire, and just live normally. That was the dream, wasn’t it? The dream he had never allowed himself to dream. But now, maybe he could. Maybe this was the start of something good.
"And so naturally you come to me? A teenage girl with two dads who gives a shit about me and an annoying younger brother? If you wanted someone to understand your family dichotomy you should've talked to Matt."
“You’re the brains of this operation. I have a suit that protects me, and Steve’s a super soldier. And to be honest, I don’t trust anyone else. This all started with me going to that alternate universe where we’re all a family. It started with us, and I want it to end with us. Is that okay?”
, but it made Steve positive that if he were to make an honest woman out of Ms Potts someday, he would indeed be a wonderful father in the future.
“That’s the thing, Dad. I told the other Tony about it, and on his world S.H.I.E.L.D. is run by someone named Nick Fury. Alexander Pierce is this neo-Nazi guy, the one who tortured and turned his world’s Bucky into an assassin.”
Tony peered closer at the girl. Where the fuck did she even come from? Why was she calling him Dad? The thought of ever being a father left him with a bad taste in his mouth and certain thoughts that he would screw everything up. Pepper and he had a pregnancy scare a couple months back and Tony had had a panic attack, not ready to be responsible for a little baby that depended on him for everything. He was terrified he was going to turn into his father.
“We need that gauntlet off of him, and it’s clear that anything we throw at him he’s going to notice, so we can’t really sneak up on him.”
Tony rubbed at his forehead again. "This world is so different from my own. I had a simple life that was normal. A husband, two kids, a modest house in the suburbs. There wasn't magic or superheroes or anything like this. I work in clean energy, for fuck's sake! I'm environmentally friendly!"
Since Thor and Wanda didn’t have any stones to help aid them, they used their enhancements to try and gain control of Thanos. Thor had Mjolnir, and was using it to fly at Thanos and attack him as best he could. He kept trying, and Thanos kept deflecting or taking every blow from the hammer as if it were nothing. Wanda was trying to get in physical contact with Thanos while also using her magic to battle him and absorb any blows he tried to throw her way. She was trying to gain control of his mind and change his view of reality the way she had done with the Avengers before she joined their ranks. If Thanos was stuck inside his mind, he couldn’t fight him properly.
Tony swallowed and shrugged, trying to act nonchalant. It was the first time he had really seen Natasha--this Natasha, anyway--angry, and he wasn't so keen to see it again. "I saw you with him once, a while ago. I was surprised you actually had a functioning relationship with someone who wasn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Or you know, screwed up in some way like all of us are."
“The other Tony figured out what’s happening. The guy you said that’s been in your head all these years? His name’s Thanos.”
Tony found himself back down in the lab, then. He knew fairly well how everything worked down there. His own lab had HUD screens and holograms and graphics, that was the norm in his world, but he didn't know about this whole AI business, or whatever JARVIS had been.
She texted her dad when she got to the classroom that dinner that night was a go, and a reminder to be nice and not embarrassing.
Tony was a bundle of nerves as he sensed Thanos’s hulking form in the distance striding towards them, just like he had done in that creepy void. All of their training they’d done was guess work; he didn’t know if they actually even stood a chance of besting the demented purple monstrosity. But Tony was determined to bring that bastard down for good, or to go down fighting for the security of Earth. He knew the media had branded the Avengers ‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’, but in that moment, he couldn’t argue with that term. These five humans and one Asgardian were going to fight for all the others who couldn’t fight for themselves. His Rhodey bear was off on a mission and away from the fight like he wanted, Coulson was off resting somewhere like Clint and Natasha wanted, and Sam Wilson was back in DC working for the VA program like Steve wanted. He’d warned Pepper, Thor had warned Jane, and all their loved ones were tucked away. Not that it would matter if things went sideways, but in case they won, no harm would come to them in the process. Fighting for these people was worth it, and Tony was going to do his damnedest to make sure all these people had a home when they were done.
Natasha's eyes softened. "He's just an old friend I was dropping by to say hello to. Please leave him alone."
Thanos held her in his arms, his hands big enough to crush her if he wanted to. His eyes assessed Natasha grimly. “Did you think you could distract me with that magic trick?” he asked her. Without waiting to receive a response, he plunged his hand into Natasha’s chest, breaking through muscle and bone, pulling out her heart. After making sure she was dead, he took the soul stone from her and put it on his infinity gauntlet. Then he released her body, and she crumpled to the ground, eyes still open, but lifeless. There was blood around her open mouth, and a gory open chest cavity where her heart used to be.
With Tony's senses dulled, though, he wasn't really sure what was going on, or where he was. The only thing his mind really focused on was the sound of Steve speaking. Steve saying, "So he isn't dead?" as if he had actually been worried about the man.
Her dad still had the ability to scare her and she had no clue how. Steve was 5'4 and weighed practically the same amount as she did, and yet he still made her swallow in fear when they had serious discussions. "Sorry," she said.
It took Pepper a few seconds to take the file Tony was handing back to her. "Why are you being nice?"
Tony placed the stone back on the counter and thanked Loki for his time. He had to find a way to get Steve back to his universe so that he could warn the others that Thanos was coming.
Thor chimed in, “There is one stone on Knowhere. Sif and I gave it to the Collector for safe keeping. There is another one on planet Xandar.”
“No prob, Natasha. You ready to go?”  Clint held out his hand for her to take, and with one last deep breath, they were out the door and on the way to completing their first mission.
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
“Yeah, I think it’s the project you’re working on now, actually. You keep saying it’s gonna change the world pretty significantly.”
“16 hours. FRIDAY alerted us when there was a surge of energy from the stone and showed us footage of you disappearing. You went to the other universe didn’t you?”
And that's how the group of Avengers relaxed for the day before setting off on trying to send Tony back to his world and figuring out why he was sent here in the first place.
Tony nodded and then clapped his hands together. “Okay, now who wants to do some infinity stone training?”
Once they entered the venue for the charity function, Natasha grabbed a flute of champagne from the tray and discreetly searched for Wesley. Once she spotted him, she nodded to Clint.
The first thing that happened to Natasha when she and Karen were dropped off at school was get rocks thrown at her. From the roof of the science building. She rolled her eyes, told Karen she'd see her later, and found her way to the roof, which she wasn't supposed to know about or be on, but fuck rules.
After dinner and a bit more talking, Natasha told them she and Matt were going upstairs. Away from parental company.
Natasha and Clint shared a look. Clint nodded his head a bit and Natasha bit her lip. “We’re going after Fisk.”
Wade Wilson's parents were scientists who, honest to God, did experiments. On their own son. One experiment backfired on them and set fire to the lab, which Wade was caught in. He had burns covering a lot of his body, which made him self-conscious and made people stare, so he made up for his discomfort by being a loudmouth jerk. But a loveable jerk. On occasion.
She pursed her lips. "As far as I know, you're just friends. But I live in London nine months out of the year, so I could be wrong. Why don't you ask Steve when you see him later?"
That night Tony took her home so she could shower, change, and sleep in her own bed for a change. He and Steve were taking shifts, switching who slept with Bucky at the hospital every other day so the other could take a breather and refresh. Natasha was immensely happy to be in her own space again, with her own clothes and her own room.
The other Avengers filtered in one by one, all of them fighting the sleepiness that had plagued them and clearing their mind for the fight ahead. Tony was last to make it out, handing them the comms system, which they all eagerly put in. Each of the Avengers tested the comms system out, made sure they were all on the same channel, and could easily communicate with each other.
The Avengers followed Fury onto the Helicarrier. They brought Thanos into medical, and once he was put under, they followed Fury into the debriefing room, spending the next few hours going over ever excruciating detail of the last few weeks of their existence.
"And keeping secrets. I want to trust you, but I don't know what's going on with you. Now I'm glad you guys stayed home and got drunk instead of going out somewhere, but you're still 17 and still living under our roof. And you know how alcoholism runs in the family. I just want to make sure you're okay."
He heard a sigh, and a sniffle, and the door being shut maybe just a little too loud for Steve’s sensitive hearing to handle.
“So, I think we have some things to talk about,” she said. “Starting with, are we okay? Or are we broken up? Do you even want to speak to me any more after everything that happened?”
“Well, Daddy’s taking Bucky to a playdate before work, so it’s just you and me. We don’t have to go upstairs if it makes you uncomfortable to see the Other You and his life. We can just stay down here.”
“Yeah, I’m okay,” she said. “We defeat Thanos and most of the stones have been destroyed, so he can’t try to take over the multiverse ever again. Tony wouldn’t let me fight with them, so I had to say behind and monitor their progress.”
“Tony, if you never let Steve past your barrier, how is he ever supposed to know that the man in the tabloids isn’t the real you? That you’re more than that?”
Tony shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine. They seem happy, though, so either way, no skin off my nose.”
“Tony?” Steve asked, concern colouring his tone. He reached out like he was about to touch Tony, check his body over for any harm, but decided against it at the last moment and withdrew his hands, settling on sitting next to Tony on the couch instead. “What happened?”
“Hell yes!” Natasha said, feeling more chipper, and eager to take her mind off the dark things. She followed Tony to the elevator, making small talk with him as they went, until they were gone, leaving the rest of the Avengers in the common area without them.
"And, well, your dad gets it. He's cool with me hanging around every time you say my dad's drunk because he knows, doesn't he? Everyone remembers him being an alcoholic before you were born; it's in all the old reports. And his dad was like that, too. Don't you ever wonder if Howard ever hurt him? Why he is the way he is?"
She wasn't wrong. Natasha carried around everyone's secrets. She had a way of getting the dirtiest things out of people and used it for blackmail whenever she needed to. If she was going to work as an international spy someday, she needed to get started on her training now.
“I know so. Me, personally, I might not be able to. But the Tony of your universe? The one with Steve and the other superheroes? They’re going to come after you. And they’re going to stop you.”
“Do you know the story of Titan, my son?” Thanos asked, no longer kneeling at eye level with Tony, but rather sitting in the inky black void.
“Reckless. Who disregards rules. Who shoots gun and shoots people and gets the government to cover it up for her.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow at him. “I’m glad to hear.” She secretly hoped Tony and Steve cut all the bullshit and eventually become boyfriends, but that wasn’t really for her to decide. She was just so used to seeing them as her parents that she just wanted every version of the world’s Tony and Steves to be together like hers were. That was probably wishful thinking, but she was still holding out hope they would make it somehow.
But now…his fingers wanted to take up that piece of charcoal and create. He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to draw, just that he did. He took the sketchbook, his charcoals, and a kneaded eraser out of his bad and sat down on the bed, ready to draw the first thing that came to his mind.
“He can’t kill all of us,” she reasoned. “Besides, we probably won’t even get close to him. We’re trying to get information out of Wesley.”
Tony arched an eyebrow at her over the console. “You’re the one who gave the formula. Why don’t you ask your source if it’s legit? Far as I can tell, all the calculations are perfect. Don’t worry your pretty head, little witch, your robot boyfriend will be good as new in no time at all.”
“Fuck backup,” Clint said. “I’m gonna use that stone to kill that motherfucker and spread his body all over space.”
Pepper huffed. "It's a legally binding document saying these investors are investing their money in the new Stark Phone I proposed to them last week. It's just a formality so that we are all in agreement and legally in business together, okay?"
Tony's stomach growled at him and he decided he needed to go make breakfast and have at least three cups of coffee before he could even begin thinking about what he was going to do. He found the kitchen easily enough. He put a pot on and got busy making scrambled eggs and pancakes, his favourite. Because he could use a little normal right now.
Tony snorted. “Why? It’s not like we’re going to change fate if you tell me. I’m just curious, I just want to know that I’m not going to spend the rest of my life alone.”
He distantly heard the sound of the other’s comms being turned back on, but he tuned them out for the most part and kept hitting Thanos as hard as he could muster. Over and over again, hoping he was doing some kind of damage.
Natasha's got her own complicated history with her biological parents. Her own dads wouldn't really talk to her about it every time she asked, but she could see the hesitance in their glances when she brought them up, and knew it had to have been bad. She'd been trying to brush up on her native tongue so she could travel to Russia when she graduated and look up her parent's files.
Tony just stared at Jane, who stared back. While Jane was staring expectantly, Tony had a completely blank look on his face, devoid of any emotion. He didn't even blink.
“Of course I came to visit. I couldn’t stay away from you forever. You know, even though we met during a really shitty time, I’m still really glad we met. I’ve never had a kid in my world, not one that I know about at least, but if I ever have a daughter, I want her to be just like you, Natasha.”
He and Steve exited the car and entered the door, listened to the chimes as they entered. Tony headed straight to the check out counter to see Loki while Steve hung out, pretended to browse around. This was Tony’s world. Best to let him do his thing while Steve offered support if he needed it.
Also, Google translate did all the Russian for me, as I don't actually speak the language. So if my translation is wrong, blame Google. And also let me know so I can fix it, please!
“Yeah, I know him. We work together. We’re a group of superheroes called Avengers. We…avenge things, and stuff. Occasionally deal with aliens wanting to take over Earth.”
The group of Avengers all looked at each other, not knowing how to handle this. Tony leaned back against the couch, still upright, and sighed.
“You don’t,” Thor said. “I know you, brother. We may not always agree on everything, and we may have very different approaches to situations, but I know you. And I know you don’t want him to win.”
"Maybe this version of me doesn't, but I put the self loathing behind me in college when my parents died. I let go of that negativity. And I have a good life and a great family and I'm happy with who I am. You don't know anything about me, Steve."
Rhodey shook his head. "Alternate universes? Man, that's way too science fiction for me, Tony. Come on, things like that don't exist."
“I did not imagine such things would have taken place,” he said, apologising in the only way he knew how.
Clint almost really did throw up this time. He forgot that the younger alternate version of his best friend was still alive. It seemed unreal, that his Nat was dead and she was still there.
“Wait, you’re like five. Are you even allowed to say fucked up? Won’t Steve scold you and tell you to stop using such vulgar language?”
. This Steve was so different from his Steve. All he and Steve did was fight, their bravados and opinions constantly clashing with each other. Sometimes Tony thought that even if he did everything perfectly, Steve would still have something to complain about. But this Steve…aside from the physical difference (Tony had to admit he still thought Steve was attractive without the rippling muscles and washboard abs), this Steve was more at ease with himself. He had an abundance of smiles, and tiny touches of affection, and an excited nature that couldn’t seem to be tamped down. This was Steve as he should be, without the super soldier serum and the war and all his friends who died as he was stuck frozen in ice for 70 years.
Wanda’s red magic nudged the stones on the table, getting a feel for their power. “They feel just like the other two,” she said. “When do I get to destroy them?”
“Yes,” Vision responded, taking over control of Thanos from Wanda. Clint wished them into space, and waited.
Thor clearly caught Loki off guard, as shock was evident in Loki’s eyes, the green of his magic receding into his clear blue.
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
Thanos sighed. “How disappointing,” he said. He flexed the fingers on the hand that held the infinity gauntlet, watching the power stone glint in the sunlight. He then reached that hand not in front of him to strike Gamora, but behind him, pulling Natasha off of him. She had been steadily climbing her way up towards the gauntlet while Thanos was distracted by his daughters. She had been so silent and light in her motions that any normal person wouldn’t have even noticed she was advancing on them.
Tony sniffed. “Yeah, we can do that. Let me just, uh…grab a bite to eat or somethin’ and then we can head out.”
"Let's go sit down," Steve said. Natasha guided Matt to the couch across from where her parents were seated.
The ugly alien with his ugly ass chin grinned at Tony. “Anthony Stark. So good to see you again. I see you’ve learned how to use your stone.”
Steve frowned. "Why would I stare?" he asked after her, but she was already halfway up the stairs and away from him. He shook his head and got started on making breakfast for his kids.
The older Natasha ran her fingers over the stones on the table. “I’ll have the soul stone, if that’s okay.”
Loki laughed bitterly. “After all of Odin’s lies, how can you still believe anything that comes out of his mouth? No, dear brother, I was not treated
Childhood: All of Bruce's childhood, his father was abusive and an alcoholic. One day, his father shot and killed his mother in cold blood and was put in prison for the rest of his life. Bruce went to live with his aunt and uncle. He grew up there very close to his cousin, studying science and trying to remain peaceful so he didn't end up like his father. He studied nuclear science all his life.
“Mr Rogers, good to see you awake. Thanos is on his way. Mr Stark has asked me to have you all awake and ready to fight.”
Matt was sitting there, a smile on his lips. She wished she could see the smile reach his eyes, see the crinkles he gets at the corner of his eyes when he's amused. He was wearing his sunglasses today. "Hi," he said.
He wand Wanda descended back down to the ground, the latter letting go of her control of Thanos’s mind. Tony flew through the air, grabbing hold of Steve again as he did so. Thor used the force of his hammer to smash the gauntlet into pieces, the stone and the gold gauntlet falling apart into a bunch of tiny little pieces.
Clint parked his bike a ways away from the building and travelled the rest on foot, canvassing the building for any other of Fisk’s minions. When he didn’t find any, he quietly made his way into the building, searching for Natasha and Wesley. He turned his hearing aids up just a touch so he wouldn’t be completely without sound. All caution was thrown into the wind as he heard two voices loudly arguing with each other.
Steve nodded. He guessed they came in contact at some point, but he wasn’t going to pry. Not when his (their?) son was in the hospital.
Natasha was beautiful. She had on a tank top and shorts and was barefoot, not a stitch of makeup on her face. Her red hair was pulled back into a messy bun. She must have just woken up or something. And yet, it took Tony's breath away. Not in a like, oh my god she's so hot way, because hey, he's gay. But more like in an awed way. He was blown away by his daughter, that someone that amazing was part of his family, and he guessed the thought that this is what his daughter would look like when she was all grown up kind of choked him up. He's a sappy old gay dad. What did he expect?
Steve smiled sadly. “No,” he said. “But I think I found the reason for all of this switching between universes. I think someone is screwing with all of us. In my universe, my Bucky fell from a train, which caused his left arm to be amputated. He woke up without any of his memories. I think our lives are bleeding into each other, and that once we stop the thing switching us into different universes, things will go back to being normal.”
"And now I'm asking," Tony said. If he got back to his world in one piece, he was going to make sure he didn't fuck this Tony over.
What the hell. He had to face this reality sometime. He turned around with a strange grimace on his face. "Yeah," he said. "I guess I don't normally cook, huh?"
Then she turned to Tony. She wrapped her arms around his middle and clung to him desperately, fresh tears spilling down her cheeks. Tony kissed the top of her head, hugging her back just as fiercely. “We will see each other again, okay?” he whispered. She nodded, and reluctantly let go of him.
“He called us ants. And that he was going to take the stones from us, and I quote, ‘dissipate us into dust.’” Tony shivered again. “I really don’t like that guy.”
He watched Tony trudge his way up the stairs and disappear into their shared bedroom. Only when Tony was safely behind a closed door did Steve let out a breath. Oh man, what did Steve get himself into this time?
Steve swallowed as Tony came into view. This Tony was an absolute wreck. His hair was sticking up at all ends, like he’d endlessly been running his hands through it, tearing it out in worry and frustration. His normally carefully pressed suit was missing the jacket. His shirt was pushed up onto his forearms, his buttons were undone, and the blue was marred by blood soaked onto the front of him. His eyes were bloodshot and the rims were red, and Steve didn’t think he’d ever seen someone so utterly wrecked in his entire life.
Tony looked back at Steve to see how he was processing Natasha as their daughter and a young Bucky hooked up to tubes, lying in a coma in the hospital bed. Steve was doing neither, though. He was frozen in the doorway, face ashen, just
“Not really,” she said, but she stood up anyway and made her way out of Tony’s lab. They took the elevator to the common room, where the rest of the Avengers were waiting to say goodbye to her, send her off with well wishes. She gave each of them a hug, including her older self, who hugged her tighter than anyone else.
“We have one on Earth,” Steve said. “Vision, this other robot Tony created, he has the stone from Loki’s sceptre in his forehead, powering him. The others could be in space somewhere. I’m sure Thor would know.”
“Don’t call me that,” he heard Loki mutter as he walked past Thor and opened the door. “I will retrieve the stone for you tomorrow. You may stay in your old chambers tonight if you wish to.”
“Your dad tried to explain to me everything that happened, but I still don’t think I really understand. I just want to know that everyone and everything is safe and that things are going to go back to normal now.”
Tony stared at her. “I’m telling you I’m from another world, and that’s the part you’re focusing on?”
"No problem. Good luck meeting the parents, man," he said to Matt. Foggy waved goodbye to Natasha and got back in his car. Natasha led Matt into the foyer.
They stayed in the lab for the rest of the day, trying to figure out what to do, until Steve called them away for dinner.
He took the yellow stone out from his pocket again, rolling it between his fingers. He kept a steady mantra in his mind, pleading for the universe to send him back to his world, to let him explain to the others what they were up against.
Loki turned to assess him. “There is the time stone; it can affect time. The legends explained that you can go forward or back in time, or bring things to different places in time. One stone allows you to travel through space. Another gives you physical power. Another can preserve your soul after death. Another can grant telepathy, while the last one can give one access to the multiverse.”
"Yeah, okay." Tony lifted his hands off Bucky's ears. "Finish your pancakes and I'll drive you two to school."
All things considered, luck really was on their side. Natasha wished this Shuri girl, Wanda’s connection, was somewhere in her universe. She though they would make good friends.
“Eh, I bet you’re decent at it. You’re pretty great at lots of things, Nat. You’re a better hacker than I am.”
But apparently he wasn't gay in this universe. And apparently aliens existed. And his daughter was bred to be an assassin in love with Steve Rogers’s childhood best friend, who was her younger brother in their world.
Okay, so no dirty business. Good to know. "Okay," he said, taking the pen from Pepper's hand and signing the documents. "Good luck at the meeting," he said to her.
That just meant they were going to have to use their infinity stones and take full advantage of their powers, just like they had practiced. The soul stone didn’t really help Natasha any. It really just gave her the ability over life and death, to the place between the living and the dead. She could call on lost and dead souls and get advice from them, but she hadn’t learned how to bring them back to the living yet. It didn’t really give her any special advantage. It wasn’t a problem for her, though. She had her weapons, her fists, and her mind, and she knew the others could use their stones to trick Thanos.
real. This is your world, Tony. This mad, crazy world where all of us just got done besting a psycho robot named Ultron that you accidentally created. You went down here to work three nights ago and never came back up. You've been sitting here in this chair, asleep, your mind somewhere else. This world where Steve is your husband, where Bucky and Natasha are your children."
Tony grinned at her. “Come on, Nat. You can teach Steve how to look up old stuff on Microfiche. It’ll be a blast.”
“Yes. If Thanos is in control of the power stone, this will make him physically very strong. You will need all of your strength combined to be able to defeat him.”
Steve tucked a piece of his daughter's fiery red hair behind her ear and held her chin up so she looked him in the eyes. "What's going on with your friends?"
"I hope you like stir fry, Matt," Steve said. "It's what I made for dinner. Natasha said that was okay."
Tony didn’t know exactly how it happened. One second he was in the other world with the Avengers, Wanda carefully probing into his mind to see if anything magical could be done to send him back, and the next second there he was, at the playground. He had looked around to search for Bucky, memories of the other world he had just visited escaping from his mind, and that’s when the incident happened: a big, black SUV just came out of nowhere and hit his five year old son. He thanked all the gods of the universe that he hadn’t been completely run over, otherwise he would be planning for a funeral instead of waiting for him to recover from his injuries.
easy to talk to when he’s mad or insulted. I don’t think Steve’s underlying personality is that much different. So he would understand, at least, a little bit about why you are guarded and put on a front.”
"Heh, very funny," he said with a straight face. He leaned back in his chair. "Well, this sucks," he stated. "My toys have been taken away from me, Pepper is pissed about me running off with the Avengers, the whole world thinks everything is my fault, and my best friend ran off in the Helicarrier to who knows where."
Clint hugged his best friend fiercely and whispered, “I’ll see you on the other side.” Then he let himself slip out of the soul world.
