Steve immediately cut him off. "Wait, no, that—that wasn't what I meant," He stammered, grabbing Tony's hand. The brunet looked down at him sadly, and Steve felt his heart twinge with guilt. "Please, don't think that—Look, I'll admit I was a bit...
"Yep," Steve lied, gritting his teeth slightly. "I'm fine, don't worry. The mission is kinda at a-a standstill at the moment, though. Um..." He paused, blinking away black dots that had suddenly appeared in the vision of his one good eye. "I got bored, so I...I thought I about calling you." He was surprised by how easy it was to lie.
"Excuse me," Tony scoffed, narrowing his eyes and poking Steve in the nose again. "I'm middle aged, thank you very much!" Steve giggled.
"Language..." Tony teased, trying to smile despite the fact that he was practically sobbing now, fresh hot tears sliding down his cheeks, because, Jesus, Steve really did love Tony. "Honestly, Steve. I-I can't take these, I-I'm not worth-"
"That reminds me, actually," Tony said, changing the subject and trying to hide the worry in his voice. "I need to see Bruce later," He was talking to himself, really (he wasn't crazy, he just did that sometimes, okay?) but Clint replied anyway.
Before Steve even had the time to blink, Tony’s hand darted out from under the covers and somehow found his wrist, holding it tight. His partner didn’t say anything, but the message was clear.
"Honestly, Cap, it's no trouble." Happy twisted his head over his shoulder to give Steve a warm smile. "You don't have to worry."
Tony exhaled slowly before saying, "Alright, fiancé." And Steve couldn't help but smile warmly at that.
At that, Happy barked a laugh. "The Tony Stark is telling you to drive carefully? Who is he, and what has he done with the reckless billionaire I know?"
He raised his eyebrows, impressed. "You guys know that this whole 'Steve-is-a-child' thing isn't permanent, right?" He whispered.
"And then there's me. Boring, old, fucked-in-the-head Tony," He continued, eyes welling with tears. "I know I'm nothing special, but you could've at least-"
Fortunately, it didn't take long for the pair to arrive at the ice rink. Tony had brought them to the famous Rockefeller Centre, which had changed a lot since the last time Steve had seen it during the 1940s...in more ways than one.
"But I want to," Tony insisted anyway, rubbing his thumb over Steve's knuckle. "I want to make you happy."
"Steve, relax. Please," Tony begged, turning to face him. "I'm pretty sure they do this sort of thing all the time with parties—"
"Bucky," Steve interrupted, his eyes full of tears. "I saw Bucky...at the H-Hydra base..." Tony could hear him swallowing. "And on the train...I-I didn't stop him...I should...I should have stopped him..."
"It's really nice to hear yours," Steve whispered, hot tears suddenly stinging his eyes. "I love you, Tony."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony had waved him off. "I get it," He'd sat in front of the two, leaning against the couch, and had expected Steve to lightly run his fingers through his hair, or something. But nothing happened, and, when the movie was over, Tony saw the the two had fallen asleep. On eachother. Typical.
Tony laughed gently, and then smiled even more when Steve began to rub the pad of his thumb over his cheekbones. "Yes," He breathed, closing his eyes.
Tony watched him walk away with a fond smile on his face, thinking of how lucky he was to have someone like Steve in his life.
Steve let out a small gasp, but didn't say anything else. Curiosity overcame Tony immediately, and he slowly opened his eyes, preparing himself for rejection...
to get some sense into the man. "It's 2015, and you're in the tower. You're okay, it's just your imagination,"
"I assume that's Tony texting you." Happy suddenly said, smiling knowingly. As far as Steve was aware, he'd not taken his eyes off the road once, and so he felt himself startle a little and blush at the observation.
"The top drawer, Tony," Steve continued, forcing his eyes to stay open despite them constantly drooping. "I-I need you to open the top drawer, okay? There's—there's something in there for you, darling. Promise me y-you'll do that...?"
The brunet was scratching his neck awkwardly, avoiding eye contact as Tony watched him through the glass door.
And yet, after seeing Steve with Bucky, looking happier and laughing more (more than he'd ever done with Tony), the billionaire couldn't help thinking one thing: hadn't he been enough? Yes, Steve had become happy and felt at home when he'd met Tony, but now that Bucky was here? He was
"How long have you been there?" He called out, eyebrows furrowing. "When did you come off the ice? I didn't see you."
you," He pulled Tony down with him as he laid back on the bed, so that the two of them were both on their backs on the mattress, Tony on top of Steve, and Tony giggled, wriggling in Steve's grasp as he tried to escape (though he was secretly loving it).
"It's okay," Steve mumbled, pulling Tony into a tight hug. He kissed he top of his head, whispering in his ear: "Whatever's happened, we can sort it out. It'll be okay,"
"Tony," He greeted, trying to keep his voice steady, which was rather difficult when you were bleeding out. "Hey."
"I see that Nat and Clint took good care of you, then," Tony said, sarcastically, as he rushed over to the child. He slowly crouched down, so that he was at the same level as him. "What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare? Hmm?"
And Tony? Tony had helped. God, how he'd helped. Steve couldn't be more thankful - he'd told him himself. Tony had introduced him to as much tech as possible, and he took to teaching Steve slowly and patiently. He'd shown him movies, songs, and told him about all sorts of historical events that had occurred in the pre-defrosting years. He had held Steve close when he needed it, whispered calming words during his panic attacks, and had always just been there for him. He'd shown Steve that he wasn't alone, that he had friends, and that he had a family (the Avengers weren't related by blood, obviously, but that didn't matter).
"Mute," Tony whispered, silencing the artificial intelligence. Immediately, he felt guilty — J.A.R.V.I.S. had only been trying to help, after all — but the genius couldn't bare the thought of seeing anyone right now, because Steve—Steve had—
There was an audible exasperated sigh, and Steve pulled away from Bucky with an apologetic look on his face. "Tony," he began, using That Voice. "Be nice."
of the rink for parties," Steve corrected, raising his eyebrows and pointing at the ice. "They don't let them have the full thing!"
"Tony!" Steve cried out, shaking the man beneath him in a terrified manner, as his eyes roamed everywhere but Tony's face; he was too much of a coward to meet his gaze.
? Tony forced his eyes open. Within seconds of him doing so, there was another yell, and then Rumlow's face appeared, a few feet away from Tony's, as he was pushed to the ground. He made eye contact with Tony for a split-second, and then-
Steve shook his head, stubbornly pressing his lips together. As Tony brought the spoon closer, Steve unexpectedly began kicking his legs, which shook the high chair slightly (yes, they had a high chair. Tony didn't know why, or how, but used it anyway. After all, what else was he supposed to do with it?). And then, just as the spoon neared his lips, he started to yell.
"There you go," Tony breathed happily, after Steve had both feet down on the ice, and kissed Steve's shoulder. "That wasn't so bad, was it?"
with me, Rogers?" He was doing his best to sound cocky and teasing, despite the fact that inside his heart was fluttering like a fucking moth.
Steve felt kinda bad, knowing he should've just ignored the text; Tony was ill — he wasn't being sharp on purpose.
"Well, yeah," Tony replied immediately. His voice was partially muffled from being bent over as he finished tying the laces on his white skates, but Steve could hear him perfectly with his enhanced hearing abilities. Still, that didn't stop him from doing a double take at Tony's next words, wondering if he'd misheard him: "I rented the place out for a couple of hours."
Tony paused, before his eyes widened dramatically, and a look of delight suddenly sparkled in his eyes. "Really?!"
"Thank you!" Steve said brightly, laughing as he texted Tony. As previously mentioned, Steve of course knew the real reason why Tony was telling him all of that again. But it was fun to sometimes tease his husband.
"You must've, surely," He continued, grinning. "Although I suppose the flavour's gonna be different after all these years...but, hey, they still taste amazing," Tony was reaching into his pocket now, and Steve simply stared, his mouth agape like a fish. He couldn't believe what he was hearing - Tony Stark, talking about kissing with him!
was blasting through his speakers, so loud that it was probably damaging his ears - but Tony didn't really care. He was upgrading the armour, singing along to
Steve didn't know what to say...okay, that was a lie. He knew exactly what to say (YESYESYESYESYESYES
"I can't believe this," Tony actually laughed, short and harsh, more out of disbelief than humour. "You actually forgot,"
"Keep telling yourself that, Tony," Bruce commented. He waved his hand aimlessly in the air. "Now go and get the child some food,"
Tony shrugged. "To be honest, Bruce, I've been too busy dealing with this little one-" He gently poked Steve's nose, smiling when the young hero squealed in delight. "-to actually get any proper work done. Thor took a look at the photos and didn't think it was Asgardian, but he can't really tell, so he's gone to S.H.I.E.L.D. to get a closer look at it. That's where it-hey, what's
, it wasn't your fault," Tony insisted. "Besides, I wasn't asleep anyway. You know me..." He chuckled, trying to lighten the mood.
After a short elevator ride, the four of them ended up outside one of the guest bedrooms. Tony eyebrows twitched into a confused frown, but Natasha said nothing. Wordlessly, she opened the door, and-
, for Steve, and it had been that way for a long time. And so hearing the man flirting with him was like a Godsend.
," [sweetheart] He brushed a few hairs that had fallen away from Steve's forehead, and pressed a light kiss there.
Steve pulled away from the kiss, panting. "Not yet..." He breathed, blushing slightly. "I-I'm not ready to-"
His workaholic of a husband obviously wasn't happy with being stuck in bed all day. Steve knew it was hard for Tony to 'switch off' his brain and relax, so a small part of him always felt bad for asking him to rest all the time. Ultimately, however, he knew it was the right thing to do. Tony's sickness wouldn't last that long if he took it easy — he'd be back on his feet in no time.
"Because I can see the future, duh," Steve deadpanned. Tony scoffed, rolling eyes, and Steve shoved him playfully. "It's because I know you so well, you idiot,"
"I'm sorry," Steve said quietly, staring at the clouds in an attempt to distract himself from the bloodied mess that was his body. "Missions are tiring sometimes. I-I, uh, I nodded off."
"Tony," Steve said softly, too softly, like he was afraid to speak. "Please, look at me. I-" He placed a tentative hand on Tony's shoulder. "I'm so
There were so many ways in which you could've done that," Bucky continued. "You didn't have to go and crash your flipping plane like some fucking martyr--" Bucky stopped suddenly, and oh, look, Steve was hugging the man now. Nobody else seemed to be bothered -- was Tony the only one who wasn't okay with this?
"Tony. I know I hurt you tonight, but...there's something else, isn't there?" Steve tilted his head. "What is it, sweetheart? Hm?"
Tears were forming in Steve's own eyes too - full of shame, and regret, and pure embarrassment - as he watched Tony. God, he'd never wanted the ground to swallow him up as much as this before. He wanted to escape, to sprint for miles and miles away from everything and everyone, until he could forget what had just occurred-
"I don't know what happened," Steve furrowed his eyebrows. "I was trying to make hot chocolate-" He looked down at the mess on the floor and sighed, "-and when I heard the thunder, something inside me just
"Right," Bucky nodded, clearly not offended by the sudden blunt tone in the billionaire's voice. "Sorry-"
In all honesty, he was surprised that he was still conscious. Super-soldier or not, three shots in the stomach and a stab wound that (he was nearly certain) had caught a major artery was an obviously life-threatening situation. Plus the gaping wound above his eyebrows and the probably-not-certainly-but-most-likely punctured lung? He didn't know what to think, other than that he was very, very lucky to be alive at this point.
Tony chuckled lightly, his heart warming with the use of a nickname. "Yeah, well," He shrugged again. "You can always try. And if it doesn't work out? Well, I'm here...if you ever wanna...talk..."
"Mm," Tony hummed, sighing happily as he nestled into the warmth of Steve's embrace. "Yeah. Yeah, I do,"
—the owners a rather large sum of money." Tony gestured proudly at himself with a smug grin, before reaching past Steve to grab a black skate off the bench behind him. "Trust me, I've sorted it all out. Now, sit down, would you? I can't have you balancing on one leg as I tie your laces or you'll look like some bizarre flamingo."
Steve's hands were shaking, but it was more out of excitement and an adrenaline-rush than anxiety or fear. He could do this.
"Tony..." The soldier muttered, and it was the word that the billionaire was waiting for him to say. Because he knew he'd wouldn't have existed in his flashbacks, and so he must be back in reality. "M'cold..." He really was shivering, too, so Tony pulled him even closer until Steve's head was resting on his chest, near the arc reator.
"I know, I just—" Steve began, but stopped short when Happy gave a small 'ah-ah!' and sighed in defeat. They'd had this conversation many times before. "I
. I can't..." and waved his hand in Tony's direction. He quickly added, "Besides, it was entertaining to watch you."
"I don't think I heard that first part correctly," Tony said, instead of taking the complaint, and made his way back towards Steve as gracefully as ever. The blond couldn't keep his eyes off his boyfriend's feet —
"I'm not your dad, kiddo," Tony muttered in reply. Steve took no notice, and continued whining, hitting the billionaire's arm lightly with his tiny fists. Tony looked at Bruce. "I'm serious. What do we have that we can give him? Can he even have solids?"
," Steve commanded with a smile, grabbing Tony's hand and pulling his towards him. It was difficult to get close to each other with their skates on, and sitting down on the ice for so long was incredibly uncomfortable, not to mention rather wet, so the kiss was clumsy, awkward, and definitely not the best one they'd ever shared.
Bucky let out an annoyed huff. "Trying to save everyone?" He echoed, waving madly with his arms. Tony looked around the room in bafflement, widening his eyes at everyone as though to say,
"Oh, Tony," He whispered, pressing a kiss into his soft hair as he rubbed slow circles on his back. "I'm sorry. I should've known, I should've-"
Bruce sighed, rolling his eyes as he turned the screen around again. "Whatever. Look, I don't suppose you've found anything out about that device, have you?"
Tony suddenly stopped walking, thinking those words were directed at him, but quickly he came to a realisation that they weren't as Steve started talking again.
"And, you won't have anyone-" Steve thrusted lazily against Tony, only once, in a teasing, jokey manner. "-to
With a sad, exasperated sigh, he had ran a hand over his face and through his brown locks and-and then he had left.
fine!" Steve exclaimed, eyes widening as he got a closer look at Tony's bruised and bleeding face. "Who-who did this to you?! How did they-
"C'mere," Tony said, softly, enveloping Steve in a hug. Had he dreamt about the ice? "It's okay, see? No one's going to hurt you. You're safe now," Tony carefully scooped Steve up in his arms, making sure that he didn't leave the blanket and toy behind. He made eye contact with Bruce.
"Yes, you are. You are worth everything," Steve said with an honest smile. "I'm sorry, Tony, for the way I treated you, and for the way I made you feel,"
"I'll never stop worrying about you, Tony," Steve said truthfully, and Tony ducked his head, feeling his cheeks redden. "I care about you too much,"
"Earth to Cap!" Tony was waving his hand in front of his face, which meant that he must've spaced out at some point, and therefore he'd most likely been staring. Great. "D'ya want a kiss, or not?"
. Steve and Tony's. Tony and Steve's. It hadn't changed since that day when Steve had bashfully confessed his feelings to Tony, and it wasn't going to change, either. At least, it wasn't supposed to.
"Tony, stop," Steve cut in hurriedly, because Tony was looking more distraught than ever, as if the whole thing was his fault. No, no, no. "It's not the ice."
Tony frowned slightly. He was tired, but he kept refusing to go to sleep until Steve did, which seemed to be taking a while. And so he did the one thing that he hadn't done for years.
Steve was going to be fine. The effects from the magical-glowing-stick-thing were semi-permanent. All they had to do was wait.
"It's alright, darling. When you're ready, we'll move onto the next bit, 'kay? Take your time though, love."
"You've never had the chance to go ice skating since," Tony sounded relieved, as though a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders. "And now you're...scared of getting hurt again?"
"Shut the fuck up, Stark," Rumlow snarled, pulling Tony forward just an inch before slamming him back into the wall. Tony tried, and failed, to hide his wince. "Stop using words to make yourself seem tough and start using your fists...oh wait, that's right, you can't, can you? Typical Stark," He added, keeping his eyes locked on Tony with a piercing glare as he leaned closer, spitting as he spoke. "Your bark has always been so much bigger than your bite-"
Steve felt like a teenager again. He was all flustered: stuttering his words; avoiding eye contact; wiping his sweaty hands on his jeans. Tony (who had remained completely calm the entire time and was now hastily typing away on his phone) kept throwing him piteous glances, probably thinking that his odd behaviour was because he was afraid, or something. It wasn't. Steve couldn't care less about being trapped, because he wasn't, really - they were only a few floors up when it had happened, and the exterior of the elevator was made entirely from glass: Steve could easily jump out, and he'd definitely survive the fall. So no, it wasn't the whole trapped-in-an-elevator thing that was making Steve nervous.
," His boyfriend said carefully, holding even more tightly onto Steve's hand. "You spent seventy years frozen in the stuff, and you—you still have nightmares about it, and I brought you
"I know, but-" Tony sighed, shrugging, and instead of finishing his sentence, changed the subject: "Look, I wasn't lying when I said I was getting cold. Look at my hands - they're turning
"Pwease stay," Steve whispered, somehow managing to do puppy eyes (AKA Tony's weakness) despite being so young.
"And-" Steve tilted his head forward, tugged lightly at Tony's ear lobe with his teeth, and murmured, "You won't have anyone to whisper
It was then that she saw them - Tony, covered from head to toe in grease, his hair sticking out in odd angles, and Steve, his own locks a mess, with old tear trails on his cheeks. She choked on her drink slightly. Then, wordlessly, she reached into her pocket, brought out her mobile, and snapped a photo, before spinning on her heel and leaving the room with a mischievous grin on her face.
. Tony kept repeating it, because, well, he didn't know what else he could say. He was thankful that Steve was 'back' though...
"You, Steven, are quite possibly the heaviest child I've ever held," Tony said, taking his eyes away from his work for a moment to readjust the blonde in his arms. "I thought you were s'posed to be skinny?"
And then, finally, their lips met. Steve's were soft, and tasted sweet, but also salty from the tears. Tony's were rougher, bitten and chewed, but to Steve, felt perfect.
From the lower floors of the tower, a particular brunette shivered as the loud weather boomed. He'd always disliked storms - he was more of a sun-sand-and-sea type of guy - and he hated Monday's too. The slowly improving mechanical arm that he was working on was giving him 'nightmares' too, not working the way the genius wanted it to. Overall, Tony Stark was not having a great day. Or night, as it was now.
"Tony, please. You don't have to protect me," Steve sighed. "But I want to protect you. And if teaching Rumlow a lesson will do that, then-"
And then there was the clinginess. The casual touches. The arm around Bucky's shoulder. The hand on Steve's waist.
Tony pretended not to notice, but the words stayed in his mind nonetheless. You don't know for sure. It was true, though, wasn't it? Tony had no idea about how magic worked, or even if it was magic that had made Steve this way, and he definitely had no clue as to how to fix it. Steve was adorable like this, but what if he stayed a three-year-old forever? What if Tony never saw his husband properly again?
"Rumlow," Tony interrupted, speaking bitterly as though the name burned his tongue. "It was Rumlow,"
Tony squinted, tightening his grip on Steve as he leant forward to take a closer look (Steve giggled at the sudden movement). The image clearly displayed a close-up view of a sample of blood, Steve's blood, full of red and white blood cells and numerous other normal things found in the human body. But there was something else, too. "That's..." Tony frowned. "Is that the serum?"
"Look," Tony replied, and Steve averted his gaze to see that, in his outstretched palm, Tony was holding something small, covered in silver foil with a small white tag sticking out of the top, and written on it in was a blue font was the word HERSHEY'S.
"There's a lot you don't know about me, Hawkass," Tony said. He shrugged. "I learnt most of it from my mother,"
Tony's eyebrows knitted together. "Oh, yeah..." He paused, and then his face lit up. "Oh, yeah! I didn't-"
"Boys, c'mon now, let's not start a war," Natasha interrupted, stepping forward. "James," She nodded in greeting.
- He sighed, folding his arms, and turned away from him to face the glass window. He gazed at the view of the city below. Oh, how it had changed since the forties...
Bucky raised an eyebrow at the lack of enthusiasm in Tony's voice. "Look, I get it, okay? You don't like me. That's...that's fine, I guess. But can you just listen for a moment to what I have to say?"
The disgustingly sweet metallic scent of it in the air almost reminded him of an abandoned abattoir that he and the other Avengers had once investigated. His mind was too hazy now for him to remember exactly what they'd been doing (it had been a rather odd mission) but he would never forget the putrid smell of death that had lingered in the air, just as it did now.
"Meet me here after fifth period, okay?" Steve whispered, once they'd broke apart, and Tony nodded, smiling. "We can walk home together,"
"Oh, so you know eachother too, huh?" Tony cut in, raising an eyebrow. He looked at Clint and Bruce. "What about you two? Is there anyone who
"No problem. I'll see you in a bit, okay?" Steve replied, and Tony's heart fluttered when he added, "I love you,"
Surprised, Steve smiled humorously. "Are you about to give me the shovel talk, Happy? Because I'm afraid you're about five years too late for that."
"I was going to take you there," Tony said. He assumed by the silence that Steve was reading it, so he continued, "I knew how important it was to you, how long you'd been wanting to go...I thought we could go together. I-I persuaded them to keep it closed for tonight, so that the public wouldn't be able to-so that we could be alone. I-"
"Okay, hang on a second." Tony kinda felt like an ass for interrupting his boyfriend's reunion with his best friend, but he wanted to know how the hell Bucky had managed to get into the Tower without alerting JARVIS, and what he was planning to do now he was there. "The hell do you think you're doing?"
Looking tiredly around the living area, Steve made a mental note to tidy everything up tomorrow, then whispered, “JARVIS, please can you turn the TV off? Thank you.”
Steve fell silent, his mouth partially agape as he stared in awe at his boyfriend. Then, as swiftly as someone who'd only ever worn ice skates once in their life could manage — and with the aid of the bench — Steve rose to his feet, reaching out to carefully cup Tony's cheeks in his warm hands.
Frowning, Tony looked over at Clint, who just nodded his head in the direction that Natasha had walked off in. He too then headed that way. Tony looked down at Steve, who was still sleeping soundly, and then decided to follow the pair. They were only a few steps in front of him, but Tony stayed where he was, avoiding rushing ahead to join them so as not to wake up the blonde in his arms.
Tony dug his phone out of his bag with fumbling fingers, unlocked it, and went straight for his contacts, scrolling down until he got to 'S', and then clicked on the name that, just by reading it, brought a smile to his face, despite the situation.
"No offence, Tones," Steve mumbled. "But it's kinda hard to find somebody with the same life experience,"
"You're nervous," The genius declared, stating the obvious. "Scared, even. I didn't know you were claustrophobic,"
"So," Steve began, once his mom had finished patching up Tony's face: it wasn't broken after all, but a rather large, angry bruise was beginning to blossom around it and his eye, which would, no doubt, still be painful. "You wanna tell me who did this?"
really tired, and he should probably shut up now. It fell silent, and Steve assumed Tony had really fallen asleep this time, when he suddenly heard, "'Love you."
Tony sighed, though his hands didn't falter as they continued tying the lace. It wasn't until he was finished that he stood back up and said softly, "
Steve gave a small, barely audible sigh, and though he had no idea what the words meant, he was smiling as his eyelids fluttered closed. "Wuv you, papa..."
Tony took a while to reply, and for one pain-staking moment, Steve thought that the line had cut off.
They stayed like that for a while, locked in eachother's embrace like two jigsaw pieces, the only noise being the sound of their breathes and, of course, the clicking of metal on metal around Tony's neck.
"Huh?" Tony squinted at him in confusion; his nose crinkled adorably. "You mean you've just been standing there?"
Steve interrupted him with a kiss, cupping Tony's face and pulling him close. Tony automatically melted into it, as he always did.
it began, and Tony smiled when he noticed a little smiley face drawn in the corner of the page. The doodle was so typical of Steve.
Steve eyed Tony carefully, unsure of what to do. Now, Tony was definitely suggesting that he liked Steve, and the blond was utterly over the moon with that fact, but he wasn't sure about making another move on the brunet...what if he messed it up? What if Tony was joking? He didn't want to create another awkward situation, not when he was stuck with the man in an cramped elevator...
FSteve's fingers grabbed at nothing, and for a moment he was still. Then, suddenly, he relaxed, his arm slowly falling to his side once again. Oblivious to Stark, he began shaking his head, slowly, and his face creased up as though he was in pain.
"I am sorry, Tony," Steve replied. "I really, really am. There's only so many times I can say it, though-"
And then it hit him - Tony had finally found his happy place, only now it was about to be ripped away from him because of Bucky's arrival, and he wouldn't be able to-
"Shh," Tony whispered, grabbing a nearby blanket and wrapping it around Steve. "It's okay. Go to sleep,
"It's alright, Tony," Steve said softly, realising Tony's panic. "Look, whatever...you said you wanted to stay at mine?"
"You hear me?" Steve hissed, and Rumlow, abandoning his usual, cocky, don't-mess-with-me façade, nodded rapidly, visibly swallowing, and -
. Tony hadn't meant to let that slip. He kept his mouth shut and stared at the floor, at his shoes, at Steve's shoes - anywhere but his boyfriend.
The once boring, plain guest room had been turned into a child's paradise, full of toys and books, and all sorts of wondrous things, each a shade of red, white, or blue. The walls were covered in posters and canvases that all displayed things to do with superheroes, and the large double bed had been transformed, and now, instead of it's usual white sheets, was entirely Captain America themed. Tony couldn't help but smile when he noticed the two plush toys that were centred on the pillows: Captain America and Iron Man.
The letter wasn't sealed properly — the flap of the envelope was simply tucked into the opening, which Tony had been expecting; Steve had always said that licking envelopes was unhygienic — and so it was easy to open. With careful fingers, he took out the folded piece of paper, depositing the empty envelope on the bedside table, and gently opened it, revealing a handwritten note and—
But Steve had his arms around Tony, and Tony had his arms around Steve, and that was all that mattered. Just them. Holding each other.
"Real smooth, Stark," He teased, and then, without warning, he mumbled, "Oh, what the hell," and kissed Tony's cheek.
, curled up on a loveseat with a blanket draped over his legs, when he felt the cushions beside him shift. Seconds later, Tony flopped onto the sofa with a loud sigh, and Steve, without taking his eyes off his book, automatically lifted his arms to make room as the brunet wriggled about in search of a comfortable position before — just as Steve was expecting — falling sideways onto his lap like an oversized puppy.
"Well," Bruce began. "I imagine it's because he's a child," He said simply. He added, "That, and the fact that you're the only one on the team who's actually spent time with him. He's naturally going to start thinking you're his parent,"
"Steve, it's okay. I'm okay," Tony whispered, and Steve nodded, exhaling slowly as he opened his eyes.
," Tony whined, tilting his head back to look at the ceiling (even though he'd told Steve countless times that, no, the artificial intelligence did not live in their roof). "
Tony raised an eyebrow, watching Steve with a quizzical look on his face as though he was trying to work him out. And then his eyes widened, and a small grin grew on his face. "I know what'll cheer you up!"
"It's alright Steve, I'm here," Tony gently placed a hand on his shoulder, going for the more soothing approach, rather than shaking him. Steve flinched anyway, and Tony jumped back in surprise as he suddenly shouted, his voice raw with emotion.
, I love you so much, you have to remember that. I would never leave you. You mean too much to me," And then he pulled Tony into another hug, more tightly than before. Tony barely flinched, just allowed it to happen, keeping his arms loose by his sides. He rested his head against Steve's chest, knowing full well that he shouldn't be doing it, that he should be angry at Steve. But he couldn't help it - he'd missed this physical contact from Steve so much.
"Oh, hey, I think we might be getting somewhere!" Happy announced gleefully, and Steve was absentmindedly aware of the car moving again, this time much more quickly than before. The traffic was probably,
"We'll have the b-band play something s-slow," Steve continued, his voice breaking. "I'd hate to s-step on your..."
Steve had his tiny hands placed over his eyes, so, no, he couldn't see. Tony sighed, standing up. He took hold of the toddler's wrists, and gently pried them away from his face, but Steve kept his eyes clenched shut, so Tony opted for lifting Steve out of the high chair instead. Holding the squirming child to his chest, he ran his fingers through the child's hair, something that Steve (though he would never admit it) usually loved.
Steve complied, thankfully. His eyes landed back on Tony again, and his eyebrows furrowed in worry as he silently reached forward, cupping Tony's chin lightly in his hands. "Tony," He echoed, leaning forward until their foreheads were touching, closing his eyes. "
"Alright, alright," Tony said, raising a hand. "Fine. I get it. It was all Hydra's fault, yada yada yada...but that still doesn't explain how he got here, or what he plans to do when-"
Tony pulled the soldier closer to him, actually hugging him now, knowing what he was seeing. He and Steve often fought and argued, but it was times like this when he knew that Steve needed him, the real him, the kind, considerate man that the public seemed to forget.
, he'd once told a reporter, after being questioned about their relationship a few days after they'd come out. And he meant it. There was nothing more wonderful than—
Tony brought his arms up in an attempt to shield his face, but he wasn't fast enough - Rumlow's fist connected with his nose instantly, and both the power behind the punch and the fact that Tony wasn't prepared for it sent him tumbling to the ground.
" Steve opened his eyes with a chuckle, playing along with Tony's teasing by poking him gently in the side. He smiled cheerfully at the little yelp Tony made in surprise, then asked, "Can't a guy express how much he loves his sweetheart anymore?"
"It's okay," Steve repeated, with a smile. And then he pressed his lips to Tony's. The billionaire was startled at first, but then kissed back, pouring as much love into it as possible.
It was quiet for a while, and Tony wondered why Steve had stopped halfway. But then the quiet sobs could be heard, and the brunette tried talking to him again.
All the lights were off, save for one large lamp in the living area — but when Steve got closer, he saw that the television was still on, too, illuminating the area with its soft glow. Some credits were rolling on the screen, but the TV was muted, so Steve couldn't hear the soundtrack and guess which movie was playing. On the coffee table, a half-full bowl of popcorn sat next to Tony's Captain America water bottle, which was empty, and Steve relaxed slightly, knowing his husband was most likely nearby.
And then he was off, whizzing around the rink at an incredible speed that Steve had only seen national champions pull off. Tony had, very clearly, done this before.
— that was another thing he refused to let go of. He was clinging to it as though it was a lifeline:
Steve hesitated before replying, because he'd always been bad at receiving compliments; he never knew how to answer them. He could feel the blush returning to his cheeks. "Well, you know, I—"
Steve and Bucky hadn't left each other's sides since the Winter Soldier's arrival. Tony knew that they hadn't seen each other for seventy years, and that Steve had always thought that Bucky had fallen to his death, but still. The pair were now practically joined at the hip: they ate together; watched movies together; sparred together; went shopping together; heck, they'd even shared a bed on the first night. (Tony told Steve that no, of course he didn't mind if his boyfriend abandoned their usual sleeping chamber so that he could cuddle up with Bucky under the thick, warm duvet in one of the guest bedrooms. Tony had instead spent the entire night in his workshop, fueled only by coffee, cold and alone. But he didn't mind. Obviously). It wasn't that Tony was jealous - he just...he didn't like the fact that Steve and Bucky were now basically inseparable.
Tony echoed. "Tell me, Steve. What were you doing today? What was so important that you had to miss our anniversary, huh? Go on, do
"Jesus, Rogers. You look like a leaking faucet," Stark quipped, turning to look at him and raising an eyebrow.
"I thought I told you to quit trying to be a hero, Stark," Brock spat, bringing his foot forward to kick him in the ribs. Tony winced, bringing his arms around his sides as an attempt to shield them, and squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the next blow.
"It sounds good," He replied with confidence, because he was confident; Tony had helped him overcome the lack of that first. "You sure you'll be able to stop me, though?"
JARVIS welcomed him home just as the elevator stopped, but apart from that and the gentle hiss of the doors sliding open, all was silent. And empty. Steve couldn't see Tony anywhere. He felt his chest tighten with panic, even though the logical part of his brain was certain that nothing was wrong.
And that's when he suddenly realised: how was he supposed to explain this to his parents? They'd warned him before about continuing this reckless behaviour, about trying to be some kind of hero-
"Hey, Tony, is everything okay? J.A.R.V.I.S. said that you were—" Bruce stopped in his tracks, eyes widening at the sight of Tony sobbing uncontrollably. "
," Tony pulled his hands away. "You are not getting involved in this, Steve. Did you not hear what I said earlier, about team dynamics, and all that? And besides, I don't want you getting hurt,"
"Tony?" Steve stepped closer. "Look at me," He said, carefully placing his fingers under Tony's chin and lifting gently. Tony's eyes met Steve's for a split second, and then he looked away sharply.
Blood-stained fingers fumbled around his belt, searching for the pouch that contained a single, precious item. He breathed a shaky of relief when he found it, grasping onto it, and with all the strength he could muster, brought it up to his face.
But they were minor things in comparison to worst of his injuries — three bullet holes in his abdomen, each one blooming a hideously bright patch of carmine that kept spreading, gradually turning his uniform into just one shade: red. It was on the floor, too, pooling around him painfully slowly like a lazy river.
"Huh? Oh! Yeah, yeah, I think so, anyway. It's just that, well, I think his memories are a bit mixed up. One minute, he's acting the way a usual toddler would. The next minute, well..." Tony paused. "It was weird, but, he started talking about Bucky?"
“You feeling okay now?” He asked quietly, lightly rubbing his hand up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture. Despite the tiredness, his husband seemed better than he had this morning.
Sometimes, Tony surprised Steve by coming out with Happy and joining them on the ride home. Those were the best days. There was nothing better after a long, tiresome day at SHIELD than opening the car door and being greeted by the most beautiful man in the world. It was times like that when Steve would take up Happy’s offer and raise the partition — but only so he could enjoy a private moment with his husband. Nothing too scandalous, mind you. They both knew, from previous experiences, that the back of the car wasn’t sound-proof...
"Nobody you'll know," Tony lied - Rumlow was on the school's football team, the same team that Steve was a captain of. "Just some jerk looking for an excuse to pick a fight-"
"Tony, what are talking about?" Tony stayed quiet, his eyes dropping to stare at the floor. He mumbled something inaudible, and Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "C'mon, Tony. I love you, you know that. You can tell me anything,"
"Oh, yeah?" Steve raised an eyebrow, smirking. "Okay, then. But you'll be-" He wrapped his arms around Tony so quickly that the brunet actually squeaked in surprise (not that Tony Stark would ever admit to making a noise as unmanly as a
"Mm," Tony hummed, his eyes wandering over to the airbed on the floor that Steve had pulled out earlier. "Speaking of which..."
"Stop. Apologising." Steve said, punctuating each word with a kiss, first on Tony's temple, and then on his cheek, avoiding his injured areas. Tony's heart fluttered at the touch. "This wasn't your fault,"
"You little shit," Tony managed to say, a disbelieving, amused grin working it's way onto his face. "Steven Grant Rogers, how
"Steve, hey, listen. I'm an asshole, remember? Assholes get punched a lot; this is nothing," Tony tried to reassure him. When Steve tentatively reached out and gently brushed his hand against his cheek, Tony, automatically leaning into the touch, added: "I'm okay, Steve, I swear. Although, it is getting quite cold; maybe we should head back to-"
Tony stared at the phone in his hand with a sinking feeling in his stomach as the silence at the other end of the line continued to go on interrupted, and wondered what the hell had just happened.
. He kept telling himself this, even on Friday (movie night), when Steve and Bucky had squashed up together on the loveseat, Steve and Tony's loveseat, and forced Tony to sit on a cushion on the floor.
Tony scoffed, tilting his head to look up at him. "Are you saying I can't hold my own?" He said, trying to lighten the mood.
“Don’t,” Tony cut in softly, voice still muffled but also clearer than before. “You, just being here, it—it helps. It helps a lot."
"You're not an asshole," Steve interrupted, dropping his hand to his side before adding softly, with a teasing tone: "But you are an annoying, reckless idiot," and, before Tony could say anything, enveloped him in a hug (whilst carefully avoiding his injuries, of course). Tony widened his eyes in surprise, but quickly accepted the hug, breathing in Steve's comforting scent. "If this ever happens again, you call me straight away, okay?" Steve whispered, fondly stern.
"I can put my own skates on," Steve muttered with a blush, but sat down anyway and allowed Tony to slip the boot over his foot. Tony hummed contently as he finished tying one shoe with his steady fingers, then moved onto the other. Steve watched him fondly, before quietly stating, "You must've put in a lot of effort to organise all of this, then."
"Aren't you going to say it back?" Steve countered, teasing lightly. Tony laughed, and it was the most beautiful sound that Steve had heard, next to Tony's voice.
"Great!" He said cheerfully, releasing Steve's hand. Steve already missed his touch, even though it had been merely seconds since they'd parted. But then Tony was talking again: "Okay, first of all, let's actually get you on the ice..."
, alright?!" Tony snapped. "That's why I've been putting off telling you. If you found out, it could've ruined the team's...dynamics, or whatever, and then the school would end up losing all the time, and you're the captain, so you'd probably get the blame, and I just-" He sighed. "I kept it quiet because I didn't want to upset you, to disappoint you-"
?" He echoed, finally peeling his eyes away from his book to look down questioningly at Tony, who was still staring at him with desperate (beautiful) eyes. A teasing smirk flickered across Steve's face for just a second before he covered it up with a raised eyebrow, and he then said as flatly as possible: "You want to go ice skating."
Bruce had been listening, but there was a small smirk on his face that told Tony there was something else on his mind. "It's nothing-"
The word came out quietly, barely a whisper. His eyes were wide, now, staring at nothing in particular, only focusing on the images in his head. A single tear trickled down his cheek, and Tony resisted the urge to brush it away, knowing that it could trigger another set of horrid flashbacks.
It was when he nearly passed out again that he decided to ask The Question. It wasn't ideal to do it over the phone, really, but what choice did he have? He was running out of time, and if he didn't ask now, he'd never...he'd never get the chance again.
"Uh, sweetheart?" Steve questioned, gazing in bewilderment at the empty rink in front of them. "Aren't there usually...more people?"
Steve lifted his head from where he'd been cradling it in his hands, facing Tony with wet eyes, and muttered a faint, barely audible, "What?"
"I love you too," Tony said automatically, and Steve smiled despite everything, because those words were music to his ears. Then Tony said, "But ever since Bucky..." He trailed off, his voice barely a whisper, but Steve managed to pick it up it with his enhanced hearing.
"I-" Tony paused. He was clutching at the dog tags with his right hand, wiping away his tears with another. "It's okay...I-I'm sorry for being such an idiot,"
"Woah," Steve interrupted, cutting him off. "Hang on a second, Tony. What do you mean, 'not really'? Are you alright? Where are you?"
Tony wasn't joining him today, though. He was suffering from a cold, and Steve had ordered him to stay in bed and rest. As dramatic as that seemed, when you had a fairly large lump of metal encased in your sternum, limiting your lung capacity, a simple cold could quickly turn into something worse.
It took quite a while for Steve to get the hang of things — Tony had made him shuffle (not skate; it was definitely
Within seconds Tony was standing still, having ground to a halt by tilting his skates to the side — and releasing a spray of ice as he did so. And then he spun around and stared at Steve in surprise.
Tony wasted no time in getting back to Steve's new room. The door had been left ajar, and Tony nudged it further open with his foot, stepping into the well-decorated room. Like before, he set Steve down on the bed, tucked him in, gave him the two teddies, and kissed his forehead. Only this time, as Tony turned to leave, Steve's small fingers managed to grasp onto his t-shirt, and he tugged lightly on the material.
"Doesn't mat-of course it matters!" Steve yelled, though he instantly regretted it once he noticed Tony flinch at his sharp tone, and he sighed, running a hand through his hair before saying, much more quietly, "Tony, what they did to you - they could've broken your nose, for crying out loud, or worse - it's assault, and I won't let it go until you tell me who was-was evil enough to do this-"
"What's the date today, Steve?!" Tony snapped, and yes, he was shouting now; he'd had enough with...with all of it. "Huh? What's the damn
It took awhile, but Steve eventually arrived home, and sent a quick text to Tony to let him know he was back. He didn't get a reply, but it didn't really matter, because he was already in the elevator and on his way up to the penthouse. He'd be seeing Tony shortly.
In one swift movement, he lowered Tony onto the bed. The brunet automatically shifted and rolled onto his stomach, burying his face into his pillow, and Steve gave a small chuckle, reaching forward to grab the duvet and cover Tony with it. He tucked him in around the shoulders and stated, “I’ll be right back, okay? I’m just going to get you some water.”
And so now Steve was always driven around by Happy. It wasn’t as bad as he’d initially thought (not that he'd ever thought being in the company of Happy would be bad — he just disliked the idea of not being able to drive by himself). Happy was forever in a good mood and would always offer a welcoming smile towards Steve whenever the two greeted each other; he reminded Steve regularly that if he ever wanted to raise the partition that separated the front seats from the back, he could freely do so, not minding if Steve wanted a bit of peace and quiet; he even let Steve choose which radio station to listen to. At first, Steve had no idea about which to pick, and so Happy gradually introduced him to them all, which in turn helped Steve learn more songs that he’d missed the release of during his time in the ice. Now, Happy let Steve listen to whatever he wanted, not caring whether or not he himself liked the music.
"Look, I-I know you're best friends, and I know that he means a lot to you, but-" Tony ran a hand through his hair. "You've been spending so much time with him lately, a-and not with me, okay?! I-I'm scared that you...that you'll leave me f-for Bucky..."
Steve returned the joyous look and allowed Tony to take the lead as the pair made their way over to the rink. Unlike Steve, who kept his eyes glued to his feet the entire time and took about one step every ten seconds, Tony strode confidently as ever in his boots, as though he wasn't balancing on two thin strips of metal, and casually stepped onto the ice without hesitating once.
"I'm so sorry, Tony. My phone died. I didn't-I've only just got your message," He was panting slightly, as though he'd been in a hurry, and his eyes were full of guilt. For a moment, Tony thought he remembered, but then he said, "What did you want to see me about?"
"Tony," Steve began, swallowing thickly. He could taste metal in his mouth. "Tony, when you—when you finish this phone call—" He had to pause once more as another coughing fit took over, and Tony started calling his name worriedly, but Steve ignored him and forced himself to stop despite the agony that was currently overwhelming him, because he knew that he couldn't afford to waste anymore time, not when—well. "I need you to...in my bedroom — my bedroom, not ours — there's a bedside table with three drawers—"
"Tony," Steve warned, his cheeks heating up even more, as Tony doubled over, hands on his knees, shaking with giddiness as he tried to contain his amusement.
He felt some of it as it trickled out of the corner of his mouth and down his chin, like a tiny crimson stream, mixing with the dirt and grime, and he shakily drew the back of his hand over his mouth in a sloppy attempt to wipe it off. You need to say something. "Mmnh—"
Steve wanted to give the man a hug, which he would've done, had they both been stood on the normal ground. "It's me. I can't...I can't ice skate," He finally admitted, looking down at his feet. "The last time I did anything like this was in '37, and I ended up breaking my ankle and spraining my left wrist, so it kinda put me off the whole thing, and—and—" Steve was rambling at this point, he knew. "And since then, I've—"
"No, don't apologise. This is my fault, I-I should've realised," He kissed the top of Tony's head shakily. "Yes, Bucky's my best friend, and yes, he means a lot to me. But you, Anthony Edward Stark - you mean everything to me. You're intelligent, charming, hilarious, adorable, brilliant, caring, sweet, sexy, beautiful, and
"I sure as hell hope so," Tony muttered. "But, uh, yeah. I should probably go find Bruce before it gets too late. Can you, er...would you mind watching Steve? Just...make sure he's alright, yeah?"
his PTSD, then Tony knew there was no point trying to 'wake' him up. He knew that this would only make things worse, and if Steve was picturing the scenes deeply, he probably wouldn't hear him anyway. Tony slowly slipped an arm around his shoulder, and it wasn't long before he was leaning on him slightly, rubbing his hand over his arm for comfort, despite being covered in grease.
Tony fell silent for a few (precious) seconds, and then finally said, "Steve? What's all this about, sweetheart? I'm flattered that you proposed, but I can't help but feel—"
With a small laugh, Steve said, "Oh, I know you can hold your own, Tony. But that doesn't mean you'd get away without any scratches," He added, frowning as his thumb ghosted over the bruising on his face that had yet to heal.
"Tilt your head forward, pinch your nose a bit, yeah, that's it," Steve's mom was a nurse, so he knew the basics. "And, no. Of course I'm not happy, Tony-look at you!"
"Yeah, well, the feeling's fucking mutual," Tony grumbled, staring daggers not at Steve but at the ground, because he couldn't look at his boyfriend, not yet. He heard the light shuffling of feet on the soft bedroom carpet, and then he felt Steve's presence by his side.
"Don't," Tony interrupted. "Don't do that, Steve. That's another reason why I didn't tell you, you know; to stop you from blaming yourself,"
' inscribed at the bottom. Tears gathered in Tony's eyes: the picture was stunningly perfect — Steve had captured every detail perfectly, from the freckles on his cheeks to the light curls of hair at the nape of his neck — and the amount of love that had gone into making the art was clearly evident, so much so that Tony's heart swelled with affection.
Steve had stopped struggling, but his eyes were still tightly closed, and he was still clearly upset over...a fake train that didn't even resemble a train? Tony frowned, wondering what on earth could've caused such a reaction.
"Uh, no, you little punk. You do not get a say in this. You--" he pointed his finger at the blonde, narrowing his eyes. With his dark eyes and metal arm, the gesture looked more threatening than it was probably supposed to, but Steve didn't seem fazed by it, staring at Bucky with a soft expression on his face. "--are an
It sounded like a mixture of things: terrifying, dangerous...and exciting. Steve was both afraid and eager to go through with Tony's plan; there were so many negative thoughts floating around in Steve's mind — all sorts of things that could go wrong — but the blond knew that if he did it now and succeeded, he'd no longer be so afraid of ice skating. Hopefully.
"You-" Tony waved a finger at him, then flopped his arm lazily back onto the mattress. "You absolute-"
Steve continued, "Peggy was there too...her voice was so...real..." His voice was muffled, but the pain in it was still evident. "Sometimes, I get these visions, and I always
"Okay," He said, poking fun, "Just for that-" He pointed to the airbed. "-I'm sleeping on the floor,"
"Steve is going to be fine," Natasha said, more sternly this time. "Okay? Bruce is going to fix this,"
"Huh?" Steve questioned, frowning. You know, you should really stop with the one-word answers, Rogers. "No, I-that's not it,"
Steve was growing tired. He just wanted to get back home to Tony, who was waiting for him at the Tower and probably wondering where the hell he was.
"Oh, that. Stevie suggested that I should, uh, get used to the layout of this place if I was going to, uh, you know, stay here..."
Tony, being human and inexperienced in alien technology, didn't know whether this was actually true or not, but he kept repeating this to himself and the team anyway. They needed as much optimism as possible, because dealing with a scrawny, messy-haired, hyperactive toddler (who was also his husband, for crying out loud) was proving to be rather difficult for Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Tony would know, since he was the one who'd been juggling the child on his hip all day (the other Avengers had argued that since Steve was his husband, he should be the one to take care of him).
"If-If you truly care about me, if you truly love me, then you won't pull any reckless shit-you'll leave it alone," Tony was practically begging now, and,
"Yes," Tony said, briskly. His eyes never left the man as he wandered into the room, and he couldn't help but feel smug at the look of awe on James' face once he spotted his car collection.
It was an ancient relic of a phone that was incredibly simple to use, and it contained just one crucial phone number. Steve accidentally smeared his blood over the screen and keyboard as he frantically pushed the dial button. He pushed it against his ear, and after a few rings—
"It's okay, Steve. I promise," Tony replied, with as much sincerity in his voice as he could muster. "It was just an accident. And I’m not hurt."
"Is it what I think it is?" Steve asked, sounding suddenly dumbfounded as he reached out and grabbed the
Steve made a small hum. "Erm..." After a moment, he grinned goofily, showing off his baby teeth. "Fwee!" He held up seven fingers. Tony laughed.
Steve shifted on the bed. "I know," He said, quietly. "I know. I just-" He paused, sighing and waving his hand aimlessly in the air, trying to come up with words that wouldn't start up another argument. Eventually, he simply said: "I just want to help,"
after I fell for you to turn into a self-sacrificing lunatic. Did you even think about the consequences? Why the hell did you dive into the fucking Arctic? What, you've never heard of a parachute? Or autopilot? Or--"
"I was only teasing," Steve clarified with a smile, letting go of the book with one hand so that he could boop Tony's nose. "I'd love to go."
"Yeah, he was reminding me again about how it's better than me driving 'dangerously'—" Steve made air quotes as he spoke, rolling his eyes affectionately. "—on my motorbike."
The words were falling out of his mouth so quickly that Steve was only just able to cut in with, "I want you to—to remember—"
Steve, sensing that Tony was practically fine given the sense of humour, sleeve-slapped him on the arm, and Tony gasped in mock offence, dramatically staggering backwards with a hand over his heart.
," Steve gasped, tilting his head back in relief. As he closed his eyes, a single tear rolled down his cheek, cutting through the dust on his cheeks — but a smile was on his face, too. "Tony,
"It never came up," Tony waved his hand, dismissing the subject. He wasn't really fond of speaking about his parents. "But, anyway...since when were you two experts in interior design? And where did you even get the money for all of this?"
Steve pulled away, released his grip on Tony (the brunet whined in annoyance at the sudden loss of contact) and rolled away, all in one swift motion, until he was sat upright, leaving Tony sprawled out on the bed, and looked down at him. With a smug grin, he said: "But, sure, take the airbed," He shrugged, pretending not to care. "That's fine by me,"
"I was going to take you out to dinner later," Tony confessed. Steve was still holding onto the ring box, but now he was just staring at it; Tony couldn't read the expression on his face. "It was supposed to be all fancy and special, like a
There was a brief silence, and then Steve picked up the noise of something crinkling, like a crisp packet, or-
There was a small noise - the tiniest huff of a laugh - and Tony couldn't help but smile a little. If the man had the guts to come and apologise, when it was clearly Tony who'd been a jerk (he wouldn't say that out loud, of course)...well, maybe he'd been wrong about Bucky after all.
"I can't tell if you're being serious or not," Steve said, "but it's the...twenty seventh? Wait, no-" He pulled his phone out of his pocket, and checked the date on the lock screen, the way Tony had taught him. "-it's the eighth, uh, the twenty eighth," He raised an eyebrow. "Are you happy now?"
"Tony—" He finally spluttered, squeezing his eyes shut in pain. "I—I want to know—to know something, I want to—"
. He carried on with his life, with his work, and tried to ignore the tiny pang of jealousy he had when he saw Steve with Bucky. He didn't complain. He didn't protest.
"I know," Tony said, "I know. But there's nothing we can do. The teacher's are shit when it comes to stuff like this - they just stick jerks like Rumlow in detention for an hour and expect them to behave afterwards, but it doesn't work-"
To say that Steve was terrified was an understatement. Tony...Tony wanted him to let go of the safety of the bar and glide forward without aid, but that—that was a risky move. It would only take one false move and Steve would be on the floor—
too squeaky. "Of course we, uh, we had...uh, we had kisses," He mumbled, his cheeks heating up. "Don't really know much about the taste, though. I-I didn't really get any before or even after the serum-"
he was. He knew Steve suffered from PTSD, hell, all of the Avengers did. And with today's storm...the thunder and lightning...they could easily be mistaken for the rolling of tanks and nearby explosions. And the rain: in a way, as they hit the metal exterior of the tower, they did sound a bit like bullets firing.
"What?" Tony questioned, sratching his head. He had a mental debate with himself, before saying, "Oh, what the hell. Let him in, J,"
"Natalia," The man replied, and then he ducked his head slightly. "Look, I'm really sorry about-" He made an awkward gesture towards Natasha's hip.
Both superheroes were incredibly disappointed when the S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians managed to get the elevator working again.
By the time he’d finished cleaning up the stain — in other words, once he’d given up aimlessly scrubbing at his soiled shirt with a wet clump of toilet paper in the gents — and made his way out of HQ, he was already half-an-hour late. Happy was waiting patiently for him outside, sat in the driver’s seat of one of Tony’s many cars, and, cheerful as always, had smiled greatly at Steve once he’d got settled down in the backseat.
," Tony tried again, and finally, finally, Steve heard him. His head turned to face him, and all of the anger in his eyes disappeared instantly as he took in the sight of Tony, who was now leaning on his elbow, trying to sit up.
. "I-" He swallowed the lump that was forming in his throat, unsure of what to say other than: "I'm sorry,"
Tony took Rumlow's proximity to his advantage and sharply brought his head forward. There was a loud, satisfying thwack as it made contact with the bully's forehead, and Rumlow yelled out in surprised pain, stumbling backwards and loosening his grip on Tony, who, despite being slightly disoriented (
Natasha frowned. "Yeah, that is kinda strange," She said. "Maybe it's a good thing, though. Maybe he's getting his old memories back. Maybe he's going to turn back to normal soon,"
"Quit it," He muttered, because Steve wouldn't stop staring, damn it! "Don't give me those puppy eyes, Steven,"
There was a gentle pat on his arm, and Tony looked down to see that Steve was staring at him, his bright blue eyes wide and round, an adorable smile on his face. "Wuv you too, Tony!"
"...I didn't do it for us," Tony quietly admitted after a few quiet seconds, biting his lip. "I mean, I didn't do it for 'us' as in...
"H-Hey..." Tony said, wincing at how coarse his voice sounded. He cleared his throat, and tried again. "Hey, Steve..."
Thinking about his beautiful, loving boyfriend at a time like this brought tears to his eyes and made another part of him ache: his heart.
This appearance was the complete opposite of what the rest of the world usually saw, and while Tony always looked handsome with his fancy suits and styled hair, Steve much preferred seeing Tony like this. Minus being sick, of course. There was just something about seeing him in the warm, oversized clothes, matched with his adorable, fluffy hair, that had Steve itching for a sketchbook and pencil to capture the moment on paper. Instead, he quickly whipped out his phone and snapped a photo of his partner, unable to resist how sweet and soft he looked. God, was he beautiful.
!" Tony yelled, as Steve rolled off of him, somehow without injuring him with his blades. He held out a hand, trying to grab Steve's arm to stop him, but narrowly missed. "Steve, please!"
"Nah, it just wasn't hard to guess." He was quiet for a moment, concentrating as the long line of traffic started moving again. It only lasted a few seconds, however, and then they were stationary yet again. Both Happy and Steve sighed. It fell quiet again, until: "He talks about you all the time." Happy finally added after a moment.
"Right," Tony nodded, drumming his fingers on the table. "Right. Well. I suppose you'll have to, won't you?"
, Steve thought in amazement, watching the elegant way Tony moved his limbs as he glided across the ice.
"I thought I was back...I thought I was back in the forties..." Steve stammered. "I thought I was back
"It's snowing." Steve didn't need to look down to know that Tony was gazing up at him with those wonderful eyes.
"You're incredibly cute as a baby, Steve," Tony said quietly, scooping some more yoghurt onto the spoon. "But I can't wait to get my husband back,"
to get hurt, either!" Steve snapped, pushing himself off the bed, running a hand through his hair. "If I can do something, anything, to help keep you from harm, then I'm going to fucking do it!"
"Well," Clint said, quietly. "You don't know for sure-ow!" Natasha sleeve-slapped him on the back of the head.
"That little-" Steve stopped short, and his hands curled into furious fists, knuckles turning white. "He's on the team!"
skating) a few times around the perimeter of the rink just so that he could get his bearings, and each time he seemed to thankfully grow more and more confident — but soon Tony was adamant that it was time for him to move away from the side and try and ice skate freely.
"No," He lied, turning his head away. He could hear footsteps, and then suddenly Tony's warm hand was on his arm, near his shoulder, gently turning him around.
"I-I can't believe you just-" He paused, wiping tears from his eyes. "Oh, Lord. You j-just kissed me!" He repeated, and then cracked up laughing all over again.
Getting Tony off the sofa and into their bed without waking him would undoubtedly be a challenge, but Steve knew from other experiences that it wasn’t impossible. He’d had to carry Tony out of his workshop multiple times before. And so, as lightly as he could manage, Steve edged his arms underneath Tony’s body and carefully scooped him up, carrying him bridal-style.
"Ugh," Tony rolled his eyes. "How many times, Steve? You don't to knock, you can just-" And then he paused, because the figure behind the glass door wasn't Steve.
"Tony," Natasha said, softly. "I can practically hear your worried thoughts right now. Stop it. Steve's going to be fine,"
Though he was inexperienced, Steve knew exactly what Tony was asking for when his tongue swirled against the Captain's bottom lip. He parted his mouth slightly in compliance, allowing Tony's tongue to enter, and then the billionaire took over, sliding his tongue around Steve's warm, wet mouth. His experienced hands worked their way around Steve's body, sneaking under his t-shirt and exploring each crevasse, each line along his perfect physique. Then his hands trailed down to Steve's belt buckle, and then further, reaching down and cupping his-
It was a stupid question. And of course Steve wouldn't answer. His blue eyes were glassy with tears, and even though he was staring at Tony, he was clearly looking at something else. His pupils were darting left and right constantly, like he was searching for something.
"Yeah, I noticed," He teased, referring to how Steve had literally kissed him. "But honestly, Steve, I wasn't mocking you for kissing me. I just found what you did amusing - it's such a typical 'Steve' thing to do,"
Steve looked taken aback. "I-I was with Bucky. I, uh, we were just at-" He paused, registering what Tony had just said, and then: "Wait, what?"
It seemed to be everywhere: he could feel it's warmth near his left leg, where a knife had been dug deep into his flesh; he could taste it's coppery tang on his tongue as it filled his mouth, staining his teeth red; he could see it as it dripped from a large gash on his forehead and into his right eye, temporarily blinding him.
"Boss giving you trouble?" He teased, knowing full well he wouldn't actually be doing anything of the sort. He turned his attention back to the road for a moment as the cars in front started to edge forward once more.
And though Tony had sighed, still shaking slightly from his panic attack, he told himself that it was okay. Steve hadn't seen Bucky in seventy years. Steve deserved it.
"-I guess I better say I love you too, huh?" Tony grinned, quickly pecking Steve on the lips. "Now, c'mon, I can't be late for-"
"You," Tony said simply, as though that explained everything. "You're gonna cause a flood in here if you don't stop sweating. I mean, it's not
”Mm. Better now that you’re here.” Tony shifted in his arms, his body now leaning more towards Steve’s, and sighed comfortably. “I must’ve—Did I, did I fall ‘sleep?” He asked around a yawn.
"But you already have," Tony said, sadly. "It's fine, I-I totally get why. Bucky's from your old life, he understands you, he-he's a frickin'

scribbled in the top left corner that initially caught his eye, and so Tony went for that to begin with, his hand momentarily brushing against the ring box as he did so.
"Mmhm," Happy hummed, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. "I've never heard him talk about anyone in the same way he does with you."
"I wasn't talking about my mom," Steve said, and then he grabbed Tony's hands and looked him in the eye. "I have training on Monday. I'll see Rumlow-"
"Oh, right...sorry," Bucky actually blushed. "But yeah, I-It really means a lot, Mr-Tony. Not a lot of people would-"
He stepped closer and around the L-shaped sofa to pick up a fallen cushion from the floor — and sure enough, there was Tony, stretched out haphazardly on the couch with his limbs spread out everywhere: one leg was dangling off the side, while the other stood upright and bent at the knee; his left arm was thrown over the top of his head, loosely holding a scrunched-up tissue, but his right hand was resting above the arc reactor, clutching tightly at his phone. He was dressed in an old, faded MIT sweatshirt, what looked like Steve's sweatpants — if the rolled up cuffs at the bottom were anything to go by — and wore Iron Man socks on his feet.
The mentioning of the one-and-only Captain America made Tony lose focus on his mechanics. As creepy as it sounded, he had set those protocols before. But it wasn't to stalk the soldier. He knew about Steve's nightmares, his PTSD, his flashbacks...and he wanted to make sure the blonde was alright. Because Tony himself knew how terrifyingly realistic those dreams could be - he knew from his own experience.
—" He clapped a hand over his mouth in surprise, but behind it he was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. "Steve—
"I'll tell you what," Tony suddenly interrupted his worried thoughts, as though he'd been able to hear them. "If you just push off the side—I mean, like if you use it to propel yourself forward—I'll be able stop you before you go too far. Then you can hold onto me if you want, and I can either pull you around the rink or direct you back to the side, depending on how you feel. How does that sound?"
"No, no, don't get offended! It's really quite adorable, actually. You get this cute, confused look on your face: your eyebrows knit together, this tiny wrinkle forms on your forehead, and-"
inside, and, quite honestly, thought he was about to be murdered, until Bucky had spotted Steve stood at the sink and started calling him a 'stupid little punk'.
Tony nodded slowly. "Yeah, I know. But Steve's younger now, so surely the serum shouldn't still be there?"
No. If he went home now, he'd only be a burden to his parents: another thing for his mom to worry about; another excuse for Howard to be disappointed in him. No. It wouldn't-he couldn't-
of locks (Steve had seen bird's nests that were tidier) made him look like a madman. But deep-down, Steve knew this comical face was just a façade. Tony also looked absolutely exhausted. The dark circles around his eyes reminded Steve of all the times Tony had pulled an all-nighter in the workshop — but that was the thing. This week, they'd spent nearly every night in bed together, with Tony, as always, curled up under Steve's arms with his head pillowed on the blond's chest. The billionaire hadn't been anywhere near the workshop, so why was he looking so tired? Was being ill really taking that much out of him? Maybe he was feeling worse than Steve realised.
"Alright, then," He replied quietly, a small smile on his face. He drew back the covers, and climbed in next to the small child, despite the fact that he was still dressed in his regular Black Sabbath t-shirt and jeans. Whatever. Steve hummed happily, and automatically pressed himself against Tony, a tiny smile on his face that was illuminated by the soft blue glow of the Arc Reactor. The genius wrapped a protective arm around him, pulling him closer. "Go to sleep, now, tesoro," [sweetheart] Steve probably had no idea what that meant, but his smile widened nonetheless.
"I know you did," Tony tried again. He was hopeless at comforting people. "But don't worry, you're back in the real world now," He winced when he said it, because he knew it was slightly harsh. After all, the forties
"Tony," He breathed, releasing his grip on Rumlow. The bully fell back to the ground, but he didn't stay there. Tony had never seen anyone move so fast: Brock was up on his feet and running away in seconds, stumbling as he went. Steve barely paid him any attention, just grumbled, "And don't you even
"Therapists," He clarified, then shrugged. "I never used to bother, but then Pepper made me go...and it does work, in a way. Sometimes, it's nice to just...talk...and who knows, maybe they've been through the same shit as you. Maybe they know how to fix it,"
How long had he been out?! The sun was still burning away in the sky, but Steve couldn't tell if it had moved or not since the last time he looked. His eyes scanned the ground, searching desperately for the phone, and when he spotted it, he actually cried out in relief.
"He was, as a child," Bruce commented, looking over his glasses at Tony. "But the test results say differently. Look-" He grabbed the screen, and spun it around so Tony could view it. "Do you see that?"
"He did. He did just say yes," Tony said, startling Steve, who hadn't realised that he'd spoken out loud. The billionaire made an adorable noise, that sounded just like a giggle to Steve (
"Um," Tony scratched the back of his neck. "Not really, but, hey, I was just wondering, I mean, you don't have to, and if you're busy it's fine, but could I, maybe, tonight, canIstayoveratyours? And it's totally okay if you say no, by the way, but I-"
Oh, God, Tony had not signed up for this. Quickly, he shoved the spoon back into the yoghurt pot, raising his empty hands in the air. "Woah...Jesus, Steve, look, there's no trains, see?"
It fell silent. Steve blinked, then gave Tony a pitiful, forlorn look, and silently reached out and brushed away a hot tear on Tony's cheek that Tony hadn't even realised had fallen. The brunet blinked several times, attempting to get rid of the unspilled tears in his eyes, then gave up on trying to be subtle and simply wiped them away with the back of his hand, blushing shamefully. Steve still didn't say anything; he waited until Tony removed his hand from his face, and then leaned forward, wrapped his arms around him, and pulled him into a tight hug.
"I don't. I just got a bit...held up...with something..." Tony lied, wincing when he heard Steve sigh.
Steve smiled and took a deep breath, preparing himself, then did as he was instructed. He wobbled as soon as his first foot landed on the ice, but Tony's hand prevented him from falling backwards, and his own grip on the side kept him steady...
"I know it's sudden, Tony, but I...I need—" Steve paused, squeezing his eyes shut as another tremor wracked through his body. A single tear rolled down his cheek. "I need to know. Yes or no? Please..."
Steve laughed lightly, looking down at the brunet, and said teasingly: "Sure, Tones, whatever helps you sleep at night,"
"I love you too," Tony replied instantly, and Steve squeezed him lightly in his arms before finally pulling away. Tony was still blushing, and Steve couldn't help but grin at that.
And then Tony booped Steve on the nose. "You, Steve Rogers-" He said, interrupting the solitude. "-are a menace,"
) had been in the room, and so he headed in their direction. Soon, he could hear Steve's voice, and he knew he was close.
"Oh," A soft smile broke out on Steve's face, and he tilted his head towards Tony, adding, "Well, you're in luck." He brought his hand up to card it through Tony's hair, and closed his eyes. "'Cause there's no place I'd rather be."
When Tony awoke the next morning and saw that Steve had changed back to his regular self, he yelped in surprise-
He'd left a note, of fucking course, as though that made it any better. A small ripped piece of paper lay on his nightstand, with a small message scribbled on it in Steve's familiar font.
"Oh, no, I—" Now it was Steve's turn to blush. "I never actually, um, got on the ice to begin with."
Dragging the back of his hand across his wet eyes, Tony painstakingly reached forward and lifted the letter from the ground, his fingers quivering so badly that he fumbled and nearly dropped it again before laying it back on his lap.
"I-alright, alright, enough with the puppy eyes! I'm coming. Honestly, you're so pushy sometimes, Steven Grant Rogers,"
, Tony had texted. He had waited, patiently, to hear the blonde's heavy footsteps as he approached. He had waited, patiently, to see the puzzled, adorable look on the blonde's face. He had waited, patiently, for hours, not moving from his spot even when the clock had turned from seven, to eight, to nine, to ten...
leaflet against the supersoldier's chest, still averting his gaze. Steve took it from him with shaky hands. "What-"
The thing is, Tony had done so much for Steve. The blonde had lost everything and everyone he loved (or so he thought. Bucky being alive obviously proved this wrong, but that wasn't the point). He'd crashed into the ice leaving behind a world at war, only to wake up in the future with the world
Tony opened his eyes a fraction to peek cheekily at his husband. “I could,” he began, his voice laced with humour, “but I don’t wanna.” And with that, he shut both eyes again.
"Uh, Capsicle?" Tony's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Look, if you're really worried about this...just, don't be, okay? SHIELD will know about this. Fury or Hill or that Fitz guy I met once - he was a smart kid - have probably already ordered some of their minions to sort this out. We'll be fine. We've just gotta wait for a bit,"
Tony, who was dressed in one of Steve's grey hoodies (that was way too big for him, by the way, but what did Tony care? It smelt of Steve, and it was soft and cozy, and it smelt of Steve, plus it was warm, and it smelt of Steve...) instead of his old, blood-covered t-shirt, was sat near the end of Steve's bed, and he pulled a face and grumbled something Steve couldn't hear, leaning back against the wall and hugging his knees.
