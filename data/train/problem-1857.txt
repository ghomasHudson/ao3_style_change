Inside, the smell of honey wafts through the air. A man stands in the kitchen, bent over the counter, carefully pouring honey into individual Mason jars. His hair is dark and curly and sticks out at all angles. He wears a dark blue dressing gown that billows out around him. His focus is unbreakable as he carefully pours the honey in each jar. Theres dozens of them, lined up against the back of the counter. Each one is tied with coloured ribbon and has a printed label on the side that says, "Holmes' Honey."
Sherlock nods. "It is very old. Let me take your bag. Let's go inside."
John laughs and bumps his shoulder against the other man's. "Thanks Sherlock. I appreciate that."
"Bees!" Mae exclaims. "You're a beekeeper? I thought you were a detective."
"Well," Sherlock chastises. "Don't get too excited. I'm going to live at that B&B you mentioned. Then, I suppose I'll start looking for a place to live, for real."
"So, when would you like to come over? Mae and I, we go to the park every Friday after school and order pizza for dinner," John tells him. "Come join us."
John meets his eyes again. "What? Why not?"
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says. He means it. "I'm sure you two are better off without her anyways."
Sherlock rubs a hands over his face. "I'm fine."
So, two days later Sherlock is accompanying John on the ride to one of the local public schools. In the passenger seat, Sherlock's leg bounces up and down, anxiously. He tries to hide his nerves but John keeps glancing at him, a fond smile gracing his lips.
Sherlock doesn't say anything and moves the conversation along. "Alright well...I guess it's time to go inside then. Stamford, thank you for everything."
"Was it scary?" She asks. Sherlock really doesn't want to talk about it but she's just a little girl and he can't bear to break down in front of her or be rude to her.
Not wanting to fall asleep again, Sherlock stays awake to watch the rest of the cartoon. He watches as Marc Anthony the dog thinks his kitten has been baked into a cookie. He watches as he curls up and sobs, mourning the loss of his best friend. Sherlock finds himself relating to it and growing sad. He knows what this feels like, to lose your friend, to be without them. He keeps watching and sees the story resolve. The kitten isn't really dead or baked into a cookie, the kitten has been alive this whole time. As he watches the cartoon dog pour put his emotions, Sherlock grows even more emotional as something hits him: this is how John felt too when Sherlock left. He, too mourned the loss of his friend. On screen, Marc Anthony jumps with joy when he finds out the kitten is still alive. The kitten curls up on his back and they are just the same as they always have been.
"I can check it out. I, too would like to be closer. Being in London is dreadfully boring, I have to say," Sherlock admits. "Its nice out here in the country."
Sherlock heard the sound of John rustling around, his feet on the floor as he came towards the door. After a moment, the door opened. Up close, John looked almost the same as Sherlock remembered, only older and a lot tired. At first, he didn't move or do anything at all. He stared into Sherlock's eyes, his expression carefully neutral. Sherlock didn't know if he should say anything at all.
John looks at him, smiling. "Just checking."
John stares into his eyes, a confused expression falling over his face. With a weak and raspy voice he says, "Who are you?"
"You know, I wasn't lying when I said I thought about this everyday. I really did. I imagined if you showed up on my doorstep. Maybe you would come to the hospital and surprise me or bump into me on the street. Maybe you'd pretend to be a cab driver and put on a disguise. I imagined it in so many ways, so many scenarios but I never really thought it would happen," John speaks quietly. "I hoped for it everyday. I wanted it to happen so badly. I'm not religious but, Sherlock, I prayed for it. Up until yesterday really. And now that you're really here, I--" he cuts himself off, sighing. He leans forward and puts his tea down on the table. "Now that you're really here, I don't know what to do." Finally, John turns to meet Sherlock's eyes again. "I don't know what to say."
Sherlock lies awake for some time, hours even. But with the sound of the crickets, the moonlight and the presence of John upstairs, Sherlock eventually falls asleep. It's the first time he's naturally fallen asleep without using a sleeping pill. He falls into a deep sleep and doesn't dream for a few hours. But eventually the nightmare starts.
"Nice to see you, Stamford," he says, giving the man a strong handshake and a pat on the shoulder.
Sherlock nods. From down on the floor, Mae looks up. "You're a farmer?"
"You can go change. The bathroom's just there," John tells him, pointing behind him to a closed door. "I hope its comfortable. If you need anything...just holler." Its awkward for a moment between them. John isn't sure if he should say anything more and Sherlock sways in his spot. "Well...goodnight. See you in the morning."
"Yeah. Why?"
John walks off. Sherlock waits before he's across the yard to turn around and watch him walk. What an interesting man.
As they start to make the venture back home, Sherlock feels guilty. John has been showing him around the town all day and Sherlock already knows most of it. He stuffs his hands in his pocket.
"Why don't you just stay with your brother?" John asks. "Much better accommodations, I can imagine."
"You must be glad to be back in London," John says. "Though, I can't imagine you staying in a hotel. Must be real posh."
"Of course."
"I do, stored away. I've been doing this for so long that I really have no use for them. I trust them."
"Well what do you propose I do?" Sherlock stands up and faces John.
"Well...the last time I saw Lestrade or Molly was maybe five years ago. I visited Mrs. Hudson three years ago. Time just...got away from me , I guess," he admits, guiltily. "How do they look?"
The little girl raises the hand that's not clutching John's and waves. "Hello. It's nice to meet you."
"I told her you were an old friend from London," he says. "I don't think she has any questions for now."
He had a lot to think about anyways. His relationship with John which was in a very awkward place at the moment. Were they friends again? Sherlock couldn't tell. But John did offer him to stay overnight and they had been spending a lot of time together as of late. John was even happy to have his daughter around Sherlock. That had to count for something. They certainly weren't anywhere close to where they had been before the fall. Before that, they were a lot younger and quick on their feet. They had adrenaline coursing through their veins and jumped at any chance of an adventure. They could talk about mostly anything. John was able to get Sherlock to laugh and he was the only person that Sherlock had ever felt truly comfortable around. They were far from that now but every time they hung out, Sherlock felt them getting closer and closer. He hopes they could heal with time.
"Don't be ridiculous, I'll take a cab."
"We went after criminals," Sherlock says.
"Yes," Sherlock sighs, through gritted teeth. "I was having a nightmare."
Sherlock doesn't bother giving John a full tour of the house. It's much too large and he doesn't feel like wasting his day with that. Instead, he shows him the kitchen, the dining room and of course his bedroom which has an attached bathroom. Sherlock watched as John sets his duffel bag down on his bed and begins to unpack his things. There's very little in the bag. It's mostly clothes and Sherlock notices some photographs and notebooks in the bottom. He decides he's invading the man's privacy and declares that he has things to do and if the other man needs him he should be around somewhere.
Sherlock flushes with embarrassment and shame. He watched Mae walk into the kitchen and fill up two glasses of water. She comes back and hands one to him. He thanks her and sits on the sofa again. She sits beside him. They are both silent for a while, sipping their water. Finally, Mae breaks the silence. She reaches over to the side table to grab the remote.
"Alright. Let's get going, then," John says. Mae eyes Sherlock, warily before opening the car door and hopping in the back. John's eyes flick to his for a moment, as if checking to see that he's okay. Then he gets in the car too. Sherlock slides into his place in the passenger seat. When everyone is buckled up, they drive off.
When Sherlock comes back into the sitting room, he sets the pillow at the head of the sofa and lies down, the blankets pulled up to his chin. The house is quiet. A steak of moonlight comes through the front window and lands on the floor next to the sofa. He can't hear a thing outside, only the constant chirping of crickets. There's a clock somewhere in the room that he can hear loudly too. Its eery and unnerving but he tries to focus on the fact that there are two sleeping bodies on the floor above him. John is here in the same house. The hotel in London was always loud. Even at night, when no one was around it still seemed to be buzzing with life. Car doors opening and closing in the distance, people arguing occasionally in the alley below his window, hotel neighbours listening to the TV too loud. But at John's house everything was calm. There were no noises for Sherlock to jump at every five seconds. He hadn't heard a night so peaceful since he was a boy in the home he grew up on. It was calming and creepy all at once.
John eyes Sherlock through the corner of his eyes, a sly smile playing on his lips. "Oh yeah, sorry. What did she do? Maybe letting you hang out with her was a mistake if she's some kind of trouble maker."
Sherlock's expression turns soft. "You don't have to do anything, John," Sherlock tells him. "But if you'd let me, I'd like to become apart of your life again. I can certainly try."
"Its fine," Sherlock mutters. "What do you need?"
"Well," Sherlock clears his throat. "They were all shocked. I got a lot of hugs," he grimaces and John laughs. "Even Lestrade. Mrs. Hudson told me she knew all along."
"Thanks," John says, even though it's not exactly a compliment.
"Its okay," Sherlock whispers. He doesn't really care much about the quality of the hotel. Most of his days are spent milling around this small town where John lives anyways or walking the streets of London seeing what has changed.
"A hotel in London," Sherlock answers simply.
"Come on," John laughs. Mae stands up. "Say goodnight to Sherlock."
The next day when Sherlock arrives at John's house, things already seem more comfortable between them. John makes them egg salad sandwiches and they sit at the small table to eat them. John tells Sherlock about the hospital he works at and some of the staff there. He tells him about the town itself and the neighbors he dislikes. The conversation is easy, if still a little tense. When they finish eating, Sherlock watches as John washes up the dishes.
Sherlock stopped playing a bit abruptly, and walked briskly past John and into the kitchen to make tea. He made himself and John a cup before moving to sit in his own armchair, carefully handing John his. John looked at it for half a minute, then finally dragged his gaze up to Sherlock.
John glanced at Sherlock's hand before closing his eyes again. He wondered how rude it might be to ask Sherlock what exactly he was doing.
Expect the unexpected, as the saying goes.
"C-close, John." Sherlock breathed, reaching to grasp John's arm.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed for a moment. What he wouldn't give to be able to feel that all the time. "Oh, you wish you had massive intelligence." He scoffed, opening his eyes as a smirk curled his lips upward.
John gave little gasps and moans, nearly trying to pull Sherlock in for a kiss.
"I'm not upset." John said, taking a slow sip of his tea.
"Don't be ridiculous, John. There are no Angels." Sherlock chastised. John let out an exasperated huff.
But he knew that Sherlock was more feeling than he would ever let on. "I was joking, of course. I'm just a little... Off." He said with a little frown. "So um... What happened, exactly?" He asked slowly, brows drawing together.
John leaned closer to Sherlock as he resumed mapping out Sherlock's torso. "What are you sorry for?" He asked gently.
But the next thing he knew, even though he had no idea what it was that he had noticed, he knew there was some kind of danger imminent.
Sherlock squeezed John's wrists. "Alright?" He asked, rutting against John a little harder.
He used a lot of things for his experiments (which he knew John hated). He rose an eyebrow when John returned with a roll of plastic wrap. "Are you about to murder me?" Sherlock asked casually, tilting his head to look at John.
The one thing Mary never knew about was Arthur.
is back,
Sherlock opens the bag and finds containers of lo-mein and beef with broccoli. He sets the beef and broccoli at John’s seat at the table and grabs the lo-mein for himself. It’s so much like old times, before Sherlock “died,” before Mary, that Sherlock feels a wave of sentiment in spite of himself. He comes into the kitchen for forks just as John is leaving it, and they brush against each other in the narrow doorway.
tear or reshape, despite his best efforts, he knows.
John’s halfway down the stairs before the thoughts can coalesce-
Irene Adler
Too high to jump.
John sighs. “There was always something in the way. People. Me. You. Then you were dead, and then there was Mary. And now… Now it’s just us, Sherlock. It’s the two of us against the world and we’ve always been together in that. But now?” John looks straight at Sherlock, and he feels Seen, like John can see every thought he’s ever had, like John can see what Sherlock thought about last night at four in the morning, like he can see everything that Sherlock’s ever wanted and knows that he is everything Sherlock has ever wanted. “Now there’s nothing in the way. Just you and me, back to back, fighting off everything the universe can throw at us.”
When Rosie wakes in the middle of the night, Sherlock picks her up, warms her a bottle, and talks to her while he feeds it to her. He tells her about her father and how brave he is and how much Sherlock loves him. He wasn’t able to tell John as much tonight, but he finds he has the courage to tell Rosie. When she falls back to sleep, he kisses her on the forehead, tucks her into bed with her stuffed diseases, and gets in bed with the man he loves. It’s even better than he’d imagined it.
“I’m thinking about moving back into 221B,” John says without looking at Sherlock, instead engrossed with impaling a piece of broccoli on his fork. “I wanted to know what you think.”
11:37 am: The second client leaves. Sherlock takes a quick break to change Rosie’s diaper.
Sherlock is furious.
Rosie seems to sense his restlessness and watches him, bored of her stuffed diseases. She coos at him and stretches her hands out to be held. Sherlock considers all the reading he’s been doing on juvenile brain development, ponders Rosie’s early life numerous mirror neurons, which will largely be lost to synaptic pruning, and how at the age of less than one year she is at a critical window for social development. She needs a responsive caretaker, someone who can mirror her emotional expressions back to her. Sherlock is not an ideal model for emotional development, and this shortcoming pains him.
It all comes spilling out. “I don’t want to live my life without you in it. Everything I’ve done for the last… for God knows how long… I’ve done for you. Because of you.”

̶̶  silence.
“I mean it,” he tells her, because he does, and it’s proven by how helpless he feels watching Molly Hooper in pain. “I know that I’m… not the best at this whole… human emotions… thing,” and that gets him the ghost of a smile, “but you are important.” He catches himself fidgeting slightly, hands clenching and unclenching. “Important to me, I mean.”
- was dwarfed by the hand cradling it. She was warm, soft, and painfully fragile. For a few moments he froze in sheer terror at the thought of the innumerable ways he could hurt her by accident, just by not paying attention. His thoughts fled to greenstick fractures and cranial damage, pinched fingers, how absurdly small her toes were, how Mary was gone and what the hell was he supposed to do, how on earth was he supposed to do this, he’d failed her, failed Mary, failed John, but most importantly failed Rosie-
8:45 am: The fun begins.
Sherlock silently curses himself and opens the silverware drawer a little too roughly, rattling its contents. He retrieves two forks and comes back into the dining area.
“This isn’t pure Bach,” Sherlock tells her. “This is Bach’s Violin Concerto in E major as played for Rosie Watson.” Then Rosie plunges her hand into his mouth and he can’t really explain anything at all.
Mycroft said of the issue of Eurus.
There is the sting of a needle, blood blossoming in the barrel of the syringe like some vibrant and lethal flower, before the plunger is pushed and the comingled fluids enter Sherlock’s body that feels like someone else’s body, like watching someone shoot up on a television in a dentist’s office waiting room, sterile and cold and impersonal. There is noise, layers and layers of noise like out of tune radios heard underwater in the pool where a small boy drowned, songs he’s heard before and only half remembers like  ̶̶
Better yet,
“So,” Sherlock finally asks, “so you know?”
“You like women. You’re always reminding me.”
“Like mother, like daughter,” he’d said, and she’d laughed.
John laughs. “What could possibly be so bad about you that would make me leave? After we’ve been to hell and back, after losing Mary, after almost losing you twice? What could possibly make me leave?”
his mind supplies helpfully. Her case is personal rather than professional- it requires… discretion. It’s also the most interesting case he’s heard all day. He finds himself intrigued- it’s a case that could involve actual legwork, leaving the flat and everything. Might even be as high as a six.
“It shouldn’t matter, it’s not as if you didn’t know.” Her voice is thick, her eyes sparkling. She looks away. “It’s so obvious, everyone’s noticed. And you, with all your deductions- you must’ve already known.”
“Yes.” John says, a little too quickly. His cheeks are red. “Me, too.”
left arm, pushing some clear fluid into his body.
It was about the cases, the adventures, the sheer absurdity of the man. The way he could make John feel alive in a dead world, the fact that Sherlock had indisputably saved him. It was about the rush of the chase, and the beauty of the stars through London smog, and being two against the world. No one in John’s life had ever made him feel the way Sherlock could, John was certain, even from the beginning, that no one else ever would. It wasn’t about whether he loved Sherlock (
freezing. There is sunlight, from windows placed high
Three o’clock finds Sherlock at his computer, solving some simple cases through his website, categorizing the rest as “BORING” and “Less Boring.” Eventually he realizes he’s hungry and calls for take away. He eats his curry in front of the computer screen, searching for something interesting and finding nothing. That’s not entirely true. There’s something infinitely more interesting asleep upstairs. In the quiet dark of the early hours, Sherlock searches for a case but all he finds is John.
It’s better than he could’ve guessed, even after all the times Molly has forgiven him. “Yes, please,” he says quietly, and she steps aside to let him in the flat. He closes the door as she rushes to silence the screaming teakettle on the stove. The new quiet is quickly filled with the tinkling of china as she digs for two mugs. She fiddles with the strings of the tea bags and clumsily singes her thumb on the kettle while she pours. With trembling hands, Molly hands him his mug, setting hers on the counter to cool. He follows her lead, putting the tea aside.
“Oh. Of course.” Sherlock puts his hands in his pockets, takes them out again. “I can wait here.”
John will leave. John will leave, taking Rosie with him, and that spark will fade and Sherlock will be alone once more.
echoes through his head over and over. He memorizes it, the cadence of John’s voice, the redness in his cheeks, the warmth in his eyes, the feeling of being Seen and Known and having that be okay. It’s all okay. It’s a crisis Sherlock has built up in his head for years and now it’s just
“Better?” he asks. John laughs. John laughs more often already, and Sherlock takes pride in that.

“Are you staying tonight?”
John’s response? “You of all people should know that I’m not gay.”

“I gathered,” John says. “You turned the baby monitor off.”
11:05 am: The second client, a teenager in a hoodie emblazoned with the logo of a Norwegian heavy metal band, spends half the meeting cooing over Rosie. “She’s got your eyes,” the client says. “Her mother’s, actually,” Sherlock corrects, exhaling sharply.
John pulls away. Instantly, Sherlock’s face closes up and his eyes harden, as though that yearning had never been there. Immediately regretful, John puts his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, squeezes once, and says, “I’ll see you tonight, Sherlock.”
Sherlock closes the book and tosses it onto the coffee table, not minding where it lands.5:13 pm strikes. Sherlock hasn’t been counting the seconds, exactly, but he doesn’t need to look at his watch to know when the minute changes. He walks to and fro, between the kitchen and his chair, from the door, where he puts his ear to the wood, listening for John’s steps, to the kitchen again, frowning.
END INTERLUDE: A WORD ON JOHN WATSON
Two weeks later, Arthur was dead on John Watson’s operating table.
3:32 pm: Client number three arrives. She’s well dressed (
John continues feeding Rosie, letting Sherlock think. Sherlock’s brain is silent, for once, abated by a warm and pleasant feeling spreading from his chest, like sinking into a bath that’s the perfect temperature. Gradually, he eats his lo mein.
3:57 pm: He’s on a roll- his mouth isn’t quite keeping up with his brain, but it’s trying its best. The client’s eyes are bright- god, but he loves the ones who can keep up- and her lips are pressed in a tight, focused line. He’s missed this, the rush of a real case, the intrigue, he feels on the verge of something brilliant when-
“I’m sorry,” is all he can think to say, but he means it.
“You would’ve been better suited,” Sherlock argues helplessly.
So brief a mourning period, and yet… From the moment he met Sherlock his life has been a matter of falling towards him, falling together. Death itself had failed to keep them apart.
“Maybe,” she considers. “But I want you.
) to gather data, to see what it feels like. To show John how he feels, in a language John is accustomed to. Sherlock, for the first time in his life, wants sex. Another of those bizarre things that people uniformly put far too much stock in. Sweat and genital fluids and more mess, STI risks and all the nonsensical emotional ramifications- all of it confusing, overrated. The Woman made him wonder, but she didn’t make him
The bed upstairs is still empty, at Mrs. Hudson’s insistence. She knows that John belongs here, Sherlock’s overheard her trying to convince him to come back, take up his old room. (“That flat is too big for two people,” she told him, her voice echoing in from the hallway. “Too lonely.”) The sheets are clean, the room is swept and bare and waiting for John to return. There’s a play crib for Rosie in the living room, a purchase Sherlock had made, then fiddled with for hours trying to put the damn thing together. There are stuffed animal bacteria from Molly- her favorites are a ruffled green gangrene with googly eyes and a plush pancreatic beta cell- and a nest of blankets that had migrated over from John’s flat. There’s a set of baby bottles that had been a gift from Mrs. Hudson, a decade and a half old bottle warmer that had been a hand-me-down from Lestrade’s children, all consigned to their own kitchen cabinet, scrubbed clean of spilled chemicals and the remains a shattered beaker. Mycroft gave Sherlock a baby monitor (though the tag had read, ‘To Sherlock and Dr. Watson’) because of course Mycroft would equate “baby” with audio surveillance. Sherlock had agreed to childproof the kitchen and other hazard areas before John would even consider bringing Rosie over, so now there are bulbous plastic safety plugs in all the open sockets and rounded rubber corners on the sharp edges of his furniture. Somehow, Sherlock has made room in his home and his life for a child, and as he looks around at the container of formula on the kitchen table and the stuffed microbes on the floor, what he wants to say is ‘Everything I’ve done is for you, John.’
crisis averted. He has the rest of his life to look forward to and it’s all because of John Watson.
and it wasn’t as good as it would’ve been with Sherlock there, with that strange other piece of his life returned, but goddamnit, it was
It’s late now, halfway between dark and dawn. The street outside is quiet, but in the distance Sherlock can make out the sounds of traffic- the last buses of the day rattling towards the station, the odd car whistling past, out of sight. Baker Street is still and silent, taking its rest at the end of a long day. It’s silly to personify it in such a fashion, but the analogy is accurate. 221 B, in particular, deserves rest. It still smells like construction- sawdust and wallpaper glue and aerosol paint- but over that there’s the smell of people, of all the thin traces clients carry on themselves and deposit on the slightly singed chairs in the siting room. The bring cigarette smoke and ocean air and the damp heat of the underground with them and they leave more behind then they mean to. On top of that, the olfactory clues about the flat’s more regular inhabitants. John Watson, with his hospital antiseptic, and something clean and male and warm that he can’t quite scrub off. Rosie, spilled baby formula and talcum powder. Home.
died, if this is what
John’s expression sobers. “Mary knew. Why do you think she was always trying to push us together?”
John looks like he wants to argue but thinks better of it. As if to prove Sherlock’s point, he yawns again, eyes watering with tiredness.
It was weeks after Mary’s funeral before John let Sherlock hold his daughter again. Sherlock had tried to avoid it before, generally confused by the noise and the mess, terrified equally by how
the strange new red-faced noise machine was and by the fact that it was another person to take John away from him. He knew it was selfish, childish, but part of him resented the infant. But then Mary was gone and there was no room for selfishness, no room to be a child when there was an actual child to take care of. His discomfort with the soiled nappies and projectile spit up evaporated and were replaced by awe at the fact of the human being in his hands. Literally, in his hands. The first time he held her after Mary, the first time he held her with the knowledge of what he owed her, Rosie fit in the crook of his arm. Her entire head-
The better part of Sherlock’s life (“The
INTERLUDE: A WORD ON JOHN WATSON
Sherlock shifts slightly, sitting up. “You were tired. I wasn’t. It was a logical decision.”
The Noise
“Family business?” John suggests before he can help himself.
“You deserve better,” he tells her. She reaches for her tea, warms her hands on it.
“It worried me,” John mutters, “when I woke up. I thought maybe-“
become.”
“You said you’ve had it explained, but I want you to hear this from me. I’m not trying to use this as an excuse. Whatever my reasons were, I hurt you, and for that I apologize.” Now Sherlock is the one pulling at his tea bag and staring into the water, avoiding Molly’s eyes from where she’s leaning against the kitchen counter. He forces himself to make his hands still, to look Molly in the face, taking in the tightness in her jaw and the way she’s biting her lips sharply, as if fighting something back. “She said there was a bomb in your building. She’d just blown up 221B, and we had barely escaped. I honestly thought she was going to kill you. I swear it, Molly, I wasn’t trying to hurt you, or be cruel.”
Rosie is playing in her crib. She has decided not to throw her stuffed diseases and instead arranges the fluffy microbes one way and then another. She chews tooth-lessly on the Black Plague. Sherlock paces.
“You’re not a fool,” Sherlock tells her, as gently as he can. “You’re one of the most intelligent people I know.” That only makes her cry harder. She buries her face in her hands, curling in on herself as her shoulders shake. Sherlock is torn between wanting to reach out and not knowing how, afraid of alienating her further, or hurting her more. He doesn't know what she wants, but reminds himself that she probably doesn’t know what she wants either. In the resulting internal conflict, he finds himself frozen, watching her cry. There’s a moment of panic- how do people do this? It’s easier to reach out and try to do something than it is to do nothing and see her suffer.
“…Yes.”
John Watson
“Tonight?” Sherlock asks, voice unnaturally even, “I don’t have a case on tonight.”
“Not exclusively.”
“Don’t stop on my account,” John says, opening the door. He’s tired still, clearly, circles under his eyes from the night before, but he’s smiling. His eyes flash to the corner of the room and Sherlock wonders if he sees Mary there, as Sherlock does. He’s carrying a bag that smells like Chinese carry-out from the place with the dragons painted on the door. Sherlock nods in acknowledgement and puts bow back to strings. As he plays, John sits in the chair that will always be John’s chair, no matter how long he’s gone from Baker Street. He leans back in the chair and lets his eyes close, as he had on so many other occasions done, listening to Sherlock play.
John’s crossed the room before he finishes, hand on the doorknob.
He didn’t have to say anything to that. In a single look she could read everything. She was always able to do that with John. Just look at him and know. Look at him and know that  he needed to be alone, look at him and know that they should go for a walk, just to get out, go anywhere. Look at him and coax him into renting a comedy and drinking crap beer after a bad day at work. So of course Mary knew how he felt about Sherlock.
love her because of all the reasons he should despise her. He’s fixated on Mary, on the child she’s carrying, on the fact that everything he knows about her is a lie, so he forgets about Sherlock’s strange behavior.
but not as bad as it was before.
From then on, on the rare occasions John Watson met a man he might be interested in, all he could think of was Arthur’s face with half the brains blown out. John would look at an attractive man and see only death. It was easier to forget, after that, and anyways, John had always preferred women.
“Is it?”
“Clearly you don’t, because you’re still sitting there.”
“Yes, but not to you.” Sherlock makes sure she’s looking at him, makes sure she can read his face plainly and can understand the next part. He has to say it right this time or he won’t get a chance to try again. “The reason she chose you for her game is the same reason she chose John and my brother Mycroft. I didn’t lie to you on the phone.” Molly is very still, and he realizes she’s holding her breath. “Molly, Euros chose you because you are one of the people I care about most in the world.”
Though Sherlock hoped that regular exposure to his Work would develop her detective skills, for the time being Rosie was content to babble in a language all her own before finally falling asleep in her carrier, her head bobbing gently against John’s chest from midway through the apprehension of the suspect and the entirety of the debrief at Scotland Yard. (Sherlock insisted to John, ‘Of course she was paying attention, didn’t you see how excited she was when they put the handcuffs on him?!’) Two a.m. found them back at 221B, John rubbing his eyes quizzically like he wasn’t sure how he’d gotten there.
“Can I tell her that?”
Rosie is fast asleep, lying on Sherlock’s chest. The covers are still on the bed, and Sherlock’s wearing yesterday’s clothes, but he’s dead asleep. He’s constructed a wall of pillows around the outside of the bed -
it seems to say,
“If you’re sure.” John helps Sherlock collect Rosie. She moves about for a moment, confused at the change, before returning to sleep in Sherlock’s arms. John bends and kisses her forehead, mumbles “Love you, Rosie, bye bye” into her hair. When he straightens, he is caught off guard by his proximity to Sherlock. His face is closer than John had thought, his eyes bright. For just an instant, John thinks of kissing Sherlock goodbye too. It would be easy- shift his weight to his toes, lean in, they’re close enough that it could almost happen by accident. Sherlock inclines his head, and the distance is halved. They’re breathing the same air, caught between them. It would be easy, and John is leaving, they needn’t discuss it now, Sherlock’s eyes are soft, and when he looks at him John doesn’t know how but he realizes that Sherlock is thinking the same thing. His face is open, hopeful, and John can’t quite bear to do this to him right now, to leave him for the day and not explain. There’s a conversation that needs to happen, but it’s not one that can happen now if John wants to be at work on time.
“The Woman was more or less right about me, yes.” There’s a pause.
“You brought dinner?” Sherlock asks, blatantly changing the subject.
“Okay, you win,” he says.
He’s finally convinced John Watson to stay.
“Sherlock,
“No, not that. I don’t think I’m… I don’t think I’m ready for that either.” Sherlock can feel his face color. “I just want to go to bed with you.”
Molly’s eyes are bright, focused. Trying to read if he’s lying, and touched when he isn’t. “Really, Sherlock? You mean that?” she asks him, and the rawness on her face, the waver in her voice, is so vulnerable and open that he struggles not to look down.
Doctor John Watson is not gay.
During the time they lived together at 221B, John felt like he’d been trying to run away from Sherlock, trying to resist how much he needed him, how badly he wanted him in his life. There were women- who he hardly remembers- and the constant assertion to Scotland Yard, to Mrs. Hudson, to every stranger he encountered, that they weren’t a couple. John Watson is used to taking care of himself. The thought of needing anyone the way John needed Sherlock was absolutely terrifying, so John denied it. So John pushed himself away from Sherlock, trying to maintain boundaries where he could, trying to resist the way he could feel them merging together, feel Sherlock bleeding into the rest of his life. John could tell where they’d begun to fuse, could tell that a separation would be impossible, would be more than either of them could survive.
“She wants you to shut up and play for her,” Mary laughs, leaning against the mantle to watch. Sherlock obeys. Time slips away from him. Rosie relaxes into the carrier and babbles to herself. When she looks at Sherlock, he smiles at her, giving her small feedback, mindful of Mary’s remarks about being a responsive caretaker. “You like that part?” he asks, playing the movement a second time. “What about this?” He shifts into the next Bach concerto in E major. “Do you like this one, too?” Rosie’s eyes widen, and Sherlock widens his eyes back at her, launching into the next piece, as lively as the last.
John gives him an odd look. “Mary’s only been gone such a short time. I don’t know if I’m ready for  ̶̶ “
9:36 am: The first client of the day arrives in a dusty overcoat, with alarmingly long fingernails and dyed hair with grey roots. The client does not seem to either notice or care that Sherlock conducts their entire session with a baby strapped to his front.
9:25 am: Sherlock washes his hands. (Very important, when handling acidic chemicals, human remains, small children, or all three in combination.) Then, he washes Rosie’s. He, with some help from Mrs. Hudson, puts Rosie in her carrier, secured to his chest. (It requires some adjustment, as John had worn it last.) Rosie still smells like vinegar.
And then there was John Watson who remained fascinating through countless dull cases, who has been the best part of his life. Sherlock claimed he was married to his work because it was what he’d devoted his life to, but here, in the stillness of a sleeping house he is willing to admit to himself that he will choose John over work every time. Somewhere between the first time they met and this moment, where John sleeps on silently unaware, Sherlock had chosen to devote his life to John. If his existing categorical schema dictates that what he dedicates his life to is what he chooses to marry, then Sherlock has chosen to marry John Watson. Schemas are terribly useful ways to process information, filter out the boring from the necessary. John has his own set of schemas. Sherlock has never held with the absurd idea of marriage as an institution, but at least it’s part of a schema that John understands.
At six-thirty the next morning, John is woken by his phone alarm. He doesn’t notice until after he’s shut it off that it’s on a different nightstand than usual, that it echoes more loudly in a room much smaller than the one he shared with Mary. Then, he remembers. The case, Sherlock, Rosie asleep downstairs. 221B is silent- when he lived here with Sherlock John would’e welcomed the reprieve from the rattling, crashing, splintering, banging noises of Sherlock in the throes of boredom, but with Rosie here the quiet is unnerving. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, John checks the baby monitor on the nightstand. Nothing, not even white noise. Someone’s shut the monitor off.
Sherlock rushes to his chair and lounges in a pose that is arranged to be careless. He picks up a book without noticing the title and opens it to a random page, reading without seeing any of the words.
now, can read the subtext in everything Sherlock says. Sherlock says there’s something he needs to tell John, and John understands. Sherlock plays it as a joke, and it’s a mercy, really, that Sherlock isn’t leaving John by dropping that particular bomb. It remains unspoken, but John hears it anyway. John has wife and a baby on the way, there’s nothing he can offer in return. Perhaps Sherlock’s mercy is for himself as well, sparing himself from rejection.
“No. There was an interesting one brought in today, though. Attorney with personal problems. She’s very quick.”
“Oh Sherlock,” she murmurs, her eyes soft. “I know you do.”
A voice that sounds a lot like Mycroft echoes back,
“Perform, then,” Mary insists. “You’re always ready to perform. Why can’t you perform for her?”
“You wanted to talk?” Sherlock prompts, handing John his fork. John is distracted velcro-ing on Rosie’s bib. Sherlock sets the fork on the table instead.
“What don’t I know? Moriarty, and Mary, and Eurus, and, for God’s sake, baby-proofing your flat and taking care of Rosie  ̶̶  I know it’s all for me, Sherlock, I see that. I see
“You saw clients with Rosie?” John asks, muffled from the other room.
is the easy answer, but it brings with it so many unwanted complications.
“I thought we did rather well, didn’t we Rosie?” Sherlock asks, miffed.
4:14 pm: The client shakes his hand when she leaves, after he’s returned Rosie to her carrier, hanging on his chest. “Thank you,” she says. She has a knack for eye contact- one of those stares that makes you quiet down and listen. Rosie is cooing happily from her carrier. “Your daughter?” the woman asks. “My partner’s,” Sherlock says, and doesn’t specify. “Your partner is a lucky man, Mr. Holmes,” she tells him, and winks her goodbye.
He is wearing a smock of stiff fabric that he cannot

Then Sherlock kills a man for him and it all makes sense. Everything falls into place. John asks Mary that night, when Sherlock has been incarcerated, if Sherlock is in love with him. Mary gives him that sad, knowing smile, and says, “Of course he is.” John has nothing to say to that, but he feels like he’s drowning, like he’s just watched his future be led off in chains. He has nowhere to turn but to his lying assassin wife (who is beautiful, and brilliant, and continues to be the best thing that could’ve happened to him), so he lets himself be guided into her arms, lets her stroke his hair and hold him. She can be so gentle, and even when he’s angry at her that gentleness finds a way around his defenses. He takes her to bed that night, and they make love like mourning, and he’s not sure who he’s mourning for exactly, Sherlock, or himself, or the shattered lie that Mary had created.
"I cannot take away your future." He said evenly, though his eyes betrayed his pain.
Something that was not unlike when he'd been shot in the sweltering heat of Afghanistan. "Did you drug me?" He accused, and he eyed Sherlock up and down.
The detective quickly hid the look by looking to check if the sniper was gone.
"Me." John said quietly, blinking. "Oh."  He nodded slowly. "No, Sherlock. Don't be an idiot. We're pretty much dating anyway, aren't we? Arguing, living together, understanding each other when no one else seems to..." He pointed out.
John looked rather focused as he took a hold of Sherlock's cock. He slowly began to stroke it, looking up to meet Sherlock's eyes.
"So you've never..." He had to stop himself from naming the things he was thinking.
"Sherlock." He said, because there really wasn't anything else he could possibly think to say.
When they broke apart, John was still flushed a deep red and he began to feel uncomfortable in his soiled pants.
John watched Sherlock put himself back together, and it was somehow enchanting to watch. He went from completely undone to perfectly put together in an instant, and he was definitely more composed than John was.
"John." Sherlock said with a frown. "I do not think that it needs to be discussed because I do not think it changes anything. Unless you've changed your mind about dating?" He asked, brows furrowing a little.
"It is very rare that I do somehing without you being present, John." He pointed out, taking a sip of tea and moving to settle down on the sofa. John gave a little shrug.
They lived in organized chaos, but somehow, they managed to make it work.
In crime solving, and in life.
"Christ." He looked at Sherlock, and then down at his chest. He ran a hand over his torso and frowned.
"No, no, I've just never..." Sherlock couldn't find the words he was looking for. Couldn't quite explain what he was feeling.
They managed to catch a cab after a bit of walking and soon they were finally home. After a wipe down and a change, John found his way to the kitchen to make tea. He then sat down to think over what had happened.
"That bad, am I?" He asked, trying to mask his hurt with humor.
"I know you do, but we can wait for that..." John said softly.
"So you're... Some kind of Angel of Death?" John asked, frowning.
Promise you still want this?
"I don't want to experiment with anyone's life. Especially not yours." Sherlock said quietly. John nodded slowly.
John realised that Sherlock probably hadn't had much experience with this sort of thing, if any. He rocked back against Sherlock, trying to resist the urge to kiss him.
Sherlock then turned John's face to the left, then after a beat he turned it to the right. John remained silent and pliable to Sherlock, watching the detective with a curious expression.
Sherlock chuckled as he ducked to avoid the kiss, but he didn't stop stroking John.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, giving John's arm a squeeze before letting go. He opened his eyes and fixed them on John. He pulled his trousers and pants back up, tucking himself in and buttoning up his shirt before he smirked at the doctor.
Sherlock nodded. "I trust you." He breathed.
"Alright. Don't move, yeah?" He advised, trying to look confident, thought Sherlock could tell he was a tad nervous. Sherlock could always tell what John was feeling, and mostly what he was thinking. But this was different. He wasn't at all sure what John was about to do.
"You...What? Come on, Sherlock." He said, and he smiled a little, because really, this was ridiculous. It must be one of Sherlock's experiments, right? It had to be. Yet, John couldn't help but think about what he'd felt.
"How could I, John? I cannot kiss, or hold hands, or consecrate said marriage. Who would want a marriage without affection?" Sherlock stood up, making to grab his violin.
God, how John wanted to kiss the skin there. He focused instead on Sherlock's cock, stroking a bit faster.
"We're doing this today." John said, and his tone left little room for argument.
Sherlock shook his head a little and brought his hand down John's neck. He then followed the path of John's arm until his hand finally landed on John's hip.
Things had been extremely slow around 221 B, and Sherlock was starting to reach that point in his boredom where he would do absolutely anything to help alleviate his so-called suffering.
John continued to work Sherlock's cock, swiping his thumb across the head a few times.
Sherlock trailed his fingers up and down John's chest, rubbing at each of his nipples experimentally. He noted John's reactions to different kinds of touches, and to being touched in different places.
Sherlock watched as John's fingers traced the hair down to the hem of his pants. He gave a full body shiver and looked at John. "I've never been touched this much by someone else." He admitted, reaching to touch John's arm.
John licked his lips. "Really?" He asked, raising his eyebrows.
More or less.
John had just been standing there, looking innocent and clueless but somehow knowing as ever in that endearing way that was entirely John.
Sherlock shook his head quickly. Of course he didn't want John to stop. He never wanted John to stop. "No. No, just... Keep doing what you were doing. I'm sorry."
Sherlock hadn't the faintest idea what the doctor had been talking about, but he had been paying attention.
John gave an enthusiastic nod, leaning to Sherlock's touch. "Please."
Sherlock gave a shuddering moan, closing his eyes. "John." He breathed, head falling back and exposing his far too long neck.
He'd immediately thought back to Afghanistan, where he had been nearly certain that he was going to die. And while Sherlock was a good actor, John didn't think he was that good. At least, he liked to think that he understood Sherlock slightly better than that.
John brushed off the near-scolding from Sherlock as he stood up and moved to stand in front of the man. He hesitated, face a bit too close to Sherlock's for a moment before he reached toward Sherlock's hand. Sherlock immediately pulled away. "John. Don't." He said, and the tone actually made John inclined to listen.
Sherlock nodded, studying John. "Yes. Alright. Another time, then." He gave a little smile and reached to caress John's cheek.
Sherlock slid his hand up John's thigh and continued up his chest until he could take John's jaw into his hand. He simply held him there for a moment, looking over John's expression, studying his face.
No matter how curious he was, Sherlock's eyes had held something so raw that it nearly unnerved John. It was a vulnerability that he was sure no more than five people could ever have seen in Sherlock's lifetime. Then Sherlock blinked, and it was gone. His walls of defense were put up, right back into place like they'd never fallen.
"What the bloody hell just happened?" He asked, and he looked up to the window. There was definitely a bullet hole, so where was his? He had definitely felt something.
Sherlock met John's gaze easily and smiled. "You really don't have to focus like that." He remarked, clearly amused.
"You are quite beautiful." Sherlock said after a time. "I know beauty is merely a social construct, but it matters to you, yes?"
"Be... be careful, yeah?" John said, trying to even out his breathing. Sherlock pressed himself against John, taking his wrists and pinning them against the brick.
John was already an utter mess and easily became putty in Sherlock's hands. When the glove came into contact with his cock, John couldn't help but moan.
"It's nothing to be ashamed of. Many people base their worth solely on what others think of them." He soothed, and the grip on John's chin relaxed and he slipped his hand into John's hair.
"I understand, John, but think of the logistics." Sherlock pointed out. John looked at Sherlock for a moment, trying to think of a way to prove to him that he was being a complete and utter idiot. He was also trying to think of the logistics.
Sherlock froze before pulling away, wide-eyed. "You kissed me." He said, looking as close to dumbfounded as John had ever see him. John looked at the cellophane in his hand and then to Sherlock.
"No, you bloody idiot. Come here." John said, nodding his head once to Sherlock. He carefully ripped off a semi-straight piece of saran wrap and looked at Sherlock.
The tears begin to fall in earnest. She wipes at them furiously with the back of her hand.
̶̶  there’s poetry in it, somewhere, the way the stars are constellations if you can draw the lines just right but Sherlock has never been able to confine himself to life within the lines so the stars are just burning gaseous orbs with the power to destroy or create, tendrils of crops breaking the soil after a thaw, and light from decades before. All we ever see of stars is their old photographs, and all there will be left of Sherlock will be old photographs, sealed away and whispered about, the greatness that never was and never shall be, amen. Like watching grief played out for a soap opera audience in a dentist’s office waiting room during the day when no one is left to watch except for plastic chairs and sterilized tile floors and the kind of trashy gossip magazines that People seem to like so much, that Sherlock will never understand. Sherlock doesn’t want to understand anymore. Sherlock  ̶̶
John rolls over and puts his arm around Sherlock. “Is this okay?” he asks. Sherlock’s mouth is suddenly parched. He swallows and nods. He is sure that John can feel him nod. Sherlock presses closer still and burrows into John’s chest. “Okay?” He asks. “Okay,” John says and reaches a hand up to card through Sherlock’s hair.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes, relieved. The door opens wider. Now Sherlock can see both eyes, the grey sweater and argyle socks (thick wool- earlier induction confirmed). Molly opens her mouth twice but closes it without speaking.
and still not know would be beyond torture. Sherlock has been tortured before in all the ways that count, but that would be the very worst. To have John in his home   ̶̶  in their home  ̶̶  and still not be able to be with him the way he wants would probably kill Sherlock. Sherlock has rehearsed this conversation with himself every night since John started helping him with cases again, but he still doesn’t know what to say.
Gradually, Molly’s focus shifts and it’s clear that she’s returned to the kitchen. When she’s completely back she seems to realize that they’re still standing by the kitchen island, reflected in the gleaming door of Molly’s oven. Molly gestures vaguely in the direction of the table. (Four seats, but only one has wear that indicates frequent use.) They sit, but the silence continues.  Molly’s eyes are still red, but the tears are gone. There’s something painfully unfair in that, in seeing her wounded and walking away having been spared her grief. An apology can mend wounds, but it isn’t quite as gratifying as sharing those wounds. People become close when they’re vulnerable, or so Sherlock has been told. She’s shown her wounds, it only seems fair…
It inspires awe and terror.
He wonders if she knew something he didn’t, clever as she was. Clever as she is, the version of her that Sherlock talks to when he changes Rosie’s diapers, when John is sleep-deprived and ill-tempered, or when he’s eating take-out alone between cases in a flat that really ought to hold two (or three) people.
Sherlock has no answer to that.
“It’s alright. Thanks for looking after her.” Rosie shifts in her sleep and John begins to bounce her gently. Rosie stills once more. Over her, Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s.
who was running away,
the way John did. John can make Sherlock’s mouth water, make his pupils dilate, his pulse elevate, but somehow he’s never called Sherlock on these physiological responses. Sherlock didn’t want sex until he realized that he wanted everything with John, wanting the grunting and the sweating, the foolish absurdity of it all. He can’t imagine wanting that with anyone else.
Molly sighs. Once more, Sherlock waits for the door to swing shut, for her to retreat to stop the whistling, for her to send him away- for now, or forever. Maybe not forever, after all, she’s still talking to him. Sherlock waits. The tea kettle is getting louder, harder to comfortably ignore. Nearing a volume that will certainly bother the neighbors. Then, Molly’s face softens into something akin to resignation.
12:15 pm: Sherlock puts Rosie in her high chair again and feeds her lunch- a baby food jar of peas and a pouch of pulverized fruit. Half of it winds up on his shirt when she spits it out. He can’t blame her- he’s never been terribly fond of peas himself. Since he still isn’t on a case he makes himself a bread sandwich. (He hasn’t bought groceries in a while.)
In the ruins of the flat he finds that putting the world back together again must begin with putting Molly Hooper back together again. She’s had the situation explained to her several times- by Lestrade, by John- before she’s willing to talk to Sherlock. Her willingness to talk does not translate into a willingness to make the effort to reach him. He considers approaching her at work, in the morgue where they’re both comfortable, where she won’t leave before he’s finished. Instead, he comes to her flat. At least this way if she wants to she can refuse to let him in and can have the small satisfaction of slamming the door in his face.
“No, it’s not!”
Sherlock remembers, suddenly, leaving John’s wedding, pulling his coat on over the suit he’d worn as best man. The air was chilly, but not unpleasantly so, the music cheerful and energetic. There was laughter in the distance, the sound of a good time being had by all. Well, not all, he thought then. You’ll get over it.
John stirs himself from watching his sleeping family. (Sherlock’s term, not his, during his argument with Mycroft.
“Beautiful,” John grins, and comes over to gather Rosie. Sherlock sets the violin in its case then helps John undo the fastenings of the carrier. Rosie reaches her arms out, eager to see her father after being apart all day.

Sherlock wakes up anyway.
“She did.” Sherlock confirms, a little proud, a little surprised at himself.
She doesn’t reply, but her single visible eye is blinking rapidly. She’s gone still, the floorboards beneath her quiet. For a moment he almost expects her to slam the door in his face.
He wonders whether that’s due to the puncture

, sharp and breathless and burning. First, wanting John to look at him the way he looked at his wife, that warmth in his eyes, that belonging. Wanting the heady timbre in his voice in the early hours after a hard case- sleepy and satisfied, and enough that Sherlock can imagine… Then, wanting touch. Contact- a handshake, a hug, a clap on the shoulder, anything. Now Sherlock wants the single most damning thing he can possibly want: Sherlock wants John’s body. He wants the rough warmth of his hands, the press of his ribs expanding with breath, he wants to touch all the skin he can only imagine. He wants to kiss him (
John didn’t love Arthur. He never got the chance to.
Molly Hooper
Things fall apart, the center cannot hold. The ground quite literally comes out from beneath Sherlock’s feet when 221B explodes, and it feels like Sherlock just keeps falling. Eurus emerges from the shadows of Sherrinford, from the dark forgotten recesses of Sherlock’s mind. She toys with him- her game, her dissections- and manages to force his pulse to race as quickly as his desperate mind races. When he remembers it later he recalls certain images sharply, but distorted and fractured as though reflected in broken mirror. The deaths of strangers, the brutal unfairness of it all. The ache of old wounds being prodded at. Stinging fear belying an acrid taste in his mouth like compassion chewed up, swallowed, and vomited back out again.
“I know, Sherlock.” John tells him, but he clearly
Suddenly, a shrill whistle rents the air. Molly startles and starts to turn towards it but thinks better and stays where she is.
Suicide risk, then.
and Dr. John Watson and they were worth far more together than apart. It was about the fact that John needed Sherlock, just as much as Sherlock needed John. After everything they’ve been through and emerged from together, that had been thoroughly proven.
“I’m sorry I can’t give you what you want.” He doesn’t say, ‘I’m lonely too.’ He tries not to think of Mary Watson dying in John’s arms. He fails not to think of that final image of the two of them, the two who will always be two, Sherlock alone in his grief, alone in his longing. Instead, he thinks of John Watson and his sure hands, his clever eyes, his girlfriends, his dead wife, his daughter, all the women he’s loved. Sherlock knows a thing or two about not getting what you want.
“Yes?” John replies, wiping all the remains of dinner off Rosie’s face with a wet napkin.
He rings the bell twice and waits. It’s eight o’clock on a Wednesday night. He hears the white noise of a television inside. (A talk station- company for the lonely.) It cuts off after the second ring. The floorboards creak softly (no shoes, thick socks) in the same timbre (shifting weight in place- hesitating). He waits and realizes he can’t accurately predict whether she’ll choose to let him in. Then there are footsteps (rapid, unsteady- trying not to lose her nerve) and a deadbolt slides from home, a chain rattles out of place (more rattling than is strictly necessary, her hands are shaking-) and the door opens. A single brown eye peers out of the gap. The gap doesn’t widen.
After two years, Sherlock came back. He came back and John was
“Sherlock, would you like a cup of tea?”
(break)
Sherlock doesn’t say. He just thinks it very loudly. Mary puts a hand on his shoulder then disappears into his Mind Palace.
“The Woman was right?”
They talk about the day, John’s dull day in the hospital, Sherlock’s day with Rosie. When they’re done with dinner, Sherlock asks, “John?”
“I’m not here,” Mary reminds him gently. “Go on, then, Sherlock. Be responsive.”
And yet. John will not raise Rosie alone- he has built himself an army of caretakers and guardians. Mrs. Hudson, Molly, the godmothers. Sherlock. Sherlock, who has already far surpassed his expectations, who (
comes to mind. He ignores it.) He decides to just get Rosie- it’s Mrs. Hudson’s day, and he can drop her off on his way to work. He approaches the bed softly, fits his hands under her arms and lifts her gently, sitting her against his hip. She wakes slightly, blue eyes blinking open then closing once more. Her tiny fingers grab at the air for purchase, finally embedding themselves in John’s shirt. John smiles before he can help it and uses his finger to comb through the mess of her hair, pick at a small green spot where dinner must’ve landed the night before. By the time the green spot has been obliterated, Sherlock has opened his eyes and is observing John and Rosie quietly.
8:43 am: Sherlock digs through the cupboards and produces an unopened box of baking soda and a half-empty bottle of vinegar. He finds one of Rosie’s plastic bowls and sets it on her high chair’s table. He sifts a thin layer on baking soda into the bowl. Then, he pours the vinegar.
“Yeah. You on a case?” John asks, scooping the bag of food from where he’d set it beside his chair and moving it to the table. He sets Rosie in her high chair and moves into the kitchen for a jar of baby food and a spoon.
“How’s my girl doing?” John coos, and picks Rosie up, hoisting her into the air to look her over. “Mrs. Hudson said she spent all day with you.”
“You don’t, though. You
) - it was about the fact that they were
hum of thousands of bees, or the sky
“And she doesn’t look at all maimed. Well done,” John says.
“I know how it feels to want someone you can’t have,” is what he decides on. He isn’t sure what he expects her to say, but she says nothing. Her hand crawls away from the handle of her mug and finds Sherlock’s where it’s resting on the table. Her skin is soft and dry (frequent washing, latex gloves). Her touch is gentle, and warm, and he surprises himself by wondering if that could be enough, if they could both pretend, and she could love him, and he could do his best love her back. They could have quiet evenings watching telly, he could bring her on cases and impress her, making deductions just to hear her praise. There would be John still, John and Rosie, the family he wants that doesn’t want him, but it would be alright because he could return home to Molly and her warmth, her soft hands.
John Watson is a good man, too kind of a man to tell his best friend that he’s not interested. He’s also a very smart man, and there is no way in hell that he hasn’t noticed that every risk Sherlock has taken in the last three years, he’s taken because he loves John Watson. Sherlock is torn between frustration-
8:34 am: Rosie runs out of toys to throw.
“I’m thinking about moving back into 221B,” John says without looking at Sherlock. “I wanted to know what you think.”
Once more, he eases the door to Sherlock’s bedroom open. They’ve hardly moved. John takes exactly sixty seconds to appreciate how wonderful they are and how much he adores them before he debates the best way to wake them up. (
They meet on the tarmac as Sherlock prepares to board a plane that will take him far away from John. John doesn’t know for how long. That’s one more on the list of Things John is Trying Not to Think About. They’re on the blacktop, and they’re talking without saying anything, but John
) is watching Rosie right now. John still doesn’t know what to make of him volunteering to look after her.
“Come in!” He calls, resting the violin.
So Arthur clapped John on the shoulder, a little too rough, like he was seeking an anchor, and before he could pull his hand away, John muttered “Don’t.” John himself wasn’t sure if it referred to the “Well done, Watson,” that was probably coming, or if he was telling Arthur not to pull away. Whichever it was, Arthur got it. He didn’t say anything to John- he didn’t have to. Their wordless understanding extended beyond the operating table. They looked at each other for a moment, Arthur’s hand spread warm over John’s back, and the lightning that usually struck with Arthurs smile instead was sparking in his eyes. After hours of violence and death, John would’ve given anything to feel just a little of the life he could see in Arthur’s eyes. So he kissed him.
The unuttered fears that had been racing through John’s brain from the moment he woke up evaporate instantaneously. Something else creeps in to take their place- something warm and heavy that’s making John’s eyes sting. He exhales sharply, trying to force it back, not aided by the fact that he knows somewhere Mary is smiling. If she were here, he knows they’d be giggling together, that she’d insist upon taking a picture for later. But Mary’s gone, and now it’s just John watching Sherlock’s breath stir Rosie’s hair, observing from the outside how well they fit together. From where he’s standing, John feels utterly alone, on the outside looking in. The raw ache of loneliness wars with something that might be pride, witnessing the perfect creature that is his daughter, seeing Sherlock self-actualize in front of him. John watches, and more than anything wants to curl up with them, rest his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, hold Rosie in his arms and stop being alone.
"Okay," Sherlock breathes. "I just wasn't sure whether to confront you or not. I guess I was afraid of your reaction. I spent a lot of time um, following you around town. Watching you go into work or--at the school."
There's and awkward moment where no one knows what to say next. John comes to the rescue. "Sherlock's gonna accompany us to the park today and he's going to have pizza with us later. Sound good?"
Sherlock did. He told John about Moriarty's web. He told him about travelling around the world, solving crime. He explained how exactly he faked his own death and the reasons why. He decided not to tell John about being held captive, about being chained in a dark basement, about the scars on his back. At the end of it, John was nearly crying again.
Finally, John did something. He swallowed thickly and his eyes moved downward, staring at the ground, at their shoes. He rubbed a hand on his face, then looked back up, maybe thinking if he rubbed his eyes enough, Sherlock would disappear. He looked back up, not quite meeting the taller man's eyes. He cleared his throat.
"It's alright," John says softly, turning to look at Sherlock. "She'll like you. She's very easy to talk to. I want you to meet her. I want you to be apart of her life."
You should come over. I'll make us lunch and I can show you around the town. -JW
"Shouldn't you have some sort of protection on?" John's voice slides through the air and Sherlock jumps. He turns around. The other man is standing sort of awkwardly. His hands are stuffed in his pockets and he's put on a backwards baseball cap since they last talked. "Sorry for scaring you."
John shifts. "Hmm. That's beautiful. They are beautiful. Still nervous though," he chuckles.
"John--"
"Apiary? You mean like beekeeping?" John asks, surprised.
"Well...why not?" John shrugs, meeting Sherlock's eyes again.
"Yeah. That's cool," Mae nods.
John beams. "You think so? Everyone always comments on her beautiful brown hair which she got from her mother but never that she looks like me."
"Yes," Sherlock nods. "It was my life but it led me to Moriarty and while it may have been the challenge I always wished for, I want to stay as far away from it as I can, now. It is not worth it."
"That's cool," Mae decides, turning back to her drawing.
"Well, I wouldn't say that...but there is a certain...essence about your clothes, you could say," Sherlock says, smirking.
"I'm not sure. I suppose so."
"So, are you still staying in a hotel?" John asks, somewhat out of the blue.
After everything, after being dug up from a child’s grave at the bottom of a well, after being saved once more by Sherlock Holmes, all is forgiven. John forgives Sherlock this time partially because there’s honestly nothing to forgive, and mostly because after everything they’ve been through together- the thousand cases, the shared laughter at inside jokes, the misplaced stares, the whims and obligations of the British Government, the death of the woman they both loved- when all is said and done it has always just been the two of them. Mary’s final video was absolutely right.
Next, there is Silence.
Then John met Sherlock Holmes. Irene Adler was right- with Sherlock it wasn’t about sex- gay, straight, whatever- it wasn’t about men, it was about
I love you, he doesn’t say. Instead, he aims the gun away from Mycroft, away from John, and presses the barrel into the bare skin under his own chin (below the fragile bone of his skull and soft tissues of his brain) and hopes that they both understand the truth in the words he isn’t saying.
“John told me what happened.” She says softly. “About the game, I mean.”
Even more vividly, the moments burned into his brain, imprinted by adrenaline. Looking for Mycroft’s slick beating heart through the tailored grey wool of his waistcoat. The sweat on Sherlock’s palms, the way his hands shook around the grip of the gun as he realized the truth and the guilt of the choice he couldn’t make: that he would choose to save John Watson every time.
There’s yearning, aching and strange. The way John’s laugh made Sherlock’s heart race, how watching him play with Rosie felt like witnessing everything he’d ever wanted hover just beyond his reach. That strange warmth in Sherlock’s chest watching John help Mrs. Hudson with her housework, the sting in his eyes watching John and Mary waltz on their wedding night. Then came the
“Yes.” John says, spooning out some peas and levelling the spoon into Rosie’s mouth.
“Yeah?” John asks. “Yeah, okay.”
3:05 pm: Sherlock realizes that Rosie has fallen asleep. He moves her to her play crib and surrounds her with stuffed bacteria.
Sherlock wonders briefly if he’s
Sherlock has ever experienced, like the blue
There’s no good response to that. Mercifully, she continues. “I know, Sherlock. It’s okay.”
There’s no good way to give voice to the chaos building in John’s head, a confusion of yearning and loneliness and paralyzing fear that he’s going to get it all wrong with Sherlock, worse, with Rosie, that he’s going to fail them both. There’s calm at the eye of the storm: the persistent image of the two of them fast asleep this morning, the almost painful pull to stop thinking for long enough to join them in bed, pull them close and refuse to let go.
It takes him less than ten minutes to put Rosie to bed, tucking her in and kissing her on the forehead. When he’s finished Sherlock offers him a tee shirt and sweats left over from playing junkie. John takes them without comment, though Sherlock isn’t sure whether that’s just because he’s too tired to argue. He takes the baby monitor with him, but Sherlock shuts it off as soon is John is out of eyeshot. Better to let him rest. Sherlock’s room is close enough to hear if Rosie wakes up. Besides, Sherlock is fresh off a case and far too wired to sleep.
“Sherlock, it’s okay!”
He returns to Baker Street. The flat is in splinters and shambles and soot, and he finds himself choking on it a little. There’s so much work to be done. But he knows in time the structural damage will be repaired, the wallpaper rehung, the books returned to their shelves. What matters is the work, the fact that two days after the return from the ancestral home at Musgrave he finds a client (hair part says retired, left hand reads widowed, with the skin of a longtime smoker, gas flame blue eyes, and a speed about him that means “thief”) waiting outside under the 221. His case is resolved within twenty minutes, but what matters is that people still know where to find them, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and 221B together again, and the chaos, the burns, the shattered world around him mean so little when he can come home to that.
And for what? After everything they’ve been through, to go back to being flatmates? To see John every day?   ̶̶  of course he wants to see John every day, every day of the rest of their lives but  ̶̶  to see John every day and know that he can’t have him the way he wants? He will take John any way that he can get him, but to have him
Sherlock’s brain whirs so loudly he’s sure John can hear it from across the table.
Arthur’s hands tightened in the fabric of John’s shirt, a low growl surged from the depths of his chest, and for a split second John expected to be shoved away, thrown to the ground. Instead, he found himself pulled closer and kissed furiously. In the heat of the moment, it was so much more than John had ever thought it could be, on the rare occasions he found himself thinking about doing such a thing. Together, they burned. It was fast, passionate to the point of brutality. There was pain, but pain was a reminder that he was alive, so pain was welcome. John left the med-bay with bruises that he prodded the next day with deep satisfaction. He was certain he left more than a few bruises of his own.
He brought Victor back to life, who looked so looked scared and hurt. Sherlock vowed then and there, no matter if he understood it or not, he would never touch anyone again.
John stilled his hand, looking to Sherlock's face. "Do you want me to stop? Should I go slower?" He asked, brow furrowing in worry.
"You're not relaxed. You're thinking." Sherlock chastised as his stroked John's hair gently. John rolled his eyes before closing them and leaning into the hand.
"That, or you leave. That's what usually happens. So I won't blame you."
Perhaps the fact that this was ridiculous to do at his age factored into his reasons for liking it so much.
"I know." He said. John ran a hand over his face.
Sherlock smiled, a genuine, relaxed smile.
Sherlock's lips parted and his tongue flicked out to circle the tip of John's thumb. The latex tasted a bit odd, but it was worth it for the look on John's face.
"No, I'm not- Just hang on a second. I mean... What do you want? Do you have any more ideas that I don't know about?" John asked, fiddling with his mug.
"Don't be sorry. Now you know. Don't ever touch me. I'm sure that it works both ways, it has to. So don't be stupid." Sherlock said with a sigh. He gave off a loneliest-man-on-earth sort of air.
Sherlock quickly began to make himself tea, seeing as he knew John wouldn't make it for him unless he was making himself some, which he wouldn't be doing very soon. "Got any plans for today?" John asked, watching Sherlock carefully.
Sherlock stroked John through his orgasm, and as soon as the doctor was done he tugged his own throbbing erection out of his trousers. He stroked himself quickly, John's release making his slightly-soiled glove slide more easily over his cock.
Sherlock watched him, brows furrowed. What on Earth could the doctor be up to? He watched John open a few drawers, looking for whatever it was. He must have moved it after doing one of his experiments, but that didn't narrow down much.
The night sky was a rich darkness and the alleyway Sherlock insisted on taking (because it was a 'short cut') was very dimly lit by a half functioning street lamp.
There had to be a way to fix some problems. Gloves, for one. That seemed to work just fine, so couldn't they work out more solutions?
John rolled his eyes and resumed stroking Sherlock. He ran his spare hand over Sherlock's torso, rubbing lightly over each of Sherlock's nipples in turn.
Sherlock took John into his hand and began to stroke at nearly the perfect speed. He had committed to memory how John liked it best the last time they'd had their little sexual encounter, and he needed now adjusted the pressure and speed according to John's reaction.
"Alright." John confirmed, ashamed to admit that he was quickly nearing his climax, what he considered embarrassingly easily. With all the adrenaline of the night and his lack of an outlet for his frustrations over the past few weeks, he had pretty much lost the mental battle for control of his body.
"I want a future with you, and someone would have to have to kill me to make me ever let you go again. Do you understand?" John said firmly.
"Definitely not." John said, carefully tracing the curve of Sherlock's bottom lip with his thumb.
John pulled his thumb away after being shocked into silence for a pause. He then carefully began to undress Sherlock, methodically working through every button on his shirt as well as the one on his trousers.
John shook his head. "No, Sherlock. I'm not going to just leave. Of course not. We're mates, remember? No matter how much of a pain in the arse you are." Sherlock managed a small smile, but it also looked a little too sad.
"Ah, so you like me for my massive intelligence, do you?" John teased, tentatively reaching to run his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock smirked softly and slowly began to stroke John.
John gave the tiniest of nods. He felt a little embarrassed that he thought beauty was important, but he couldn't lie to Sherlock. Sherlock always knew when he was lying anyway.
"Now what?" John asked after a pause, looking at Sherlock. He wasn't sure where this was going, but he knew for a fact that Sherlock had some kind of scheme he was setting into motion.
"So that's it, then? We just... get over it?" He asked softly. Sherlock shrugged, deflating as well.
"I'm trying to make sure I don't try to touch you, arsehole." John grumbled, stroking Sherlock at a slightly faster pace.
Of course, John wasn't okay. And it wasn't the bullet that got him. "John. John?" He asked quickly, but it was obvious what had happened.
It was a long bloody time before they did anything again. It had been a hell of a time for crime solving, and Greg had kept bringing them one case after another.
Sherlock gave a little chuckle of pure feeling before he composed himself. "We should hurry home, yes? Best to clean ourselves up as soon as possible." He said it like it was the most logical thing in the world.
"Of course I'm sure, John. Don't be ridiculous. I want to be intimate with you. In every way I can. It will just have to be a little bit unorthodox." Sherlock returned.  John wasn't quite sure what that entailed, but it excited him.
Promise you'll talk to me if you feel something is wrong?
"I understand. I'm, uh... Sorry, mate." He straightened up and cleared his throat.
"Memorizing you." Sherlock answered the unasked question.
"I have a few ideas, yes." Sherlock replied casual as could be. "Why?" He looked to John. "Did you have something in mind?"
Promise there will be a next time?
"I'd like that. If you're sure." He said, looking down into his tea as if it may hold some kind of answers.
"Are you sure this isn't just you looking for another crime to solve?" John asked, quirking a brow at Sherlock. He was too full of excited energy for the words to have come out as scolding as they were intended to be.
"John. I am not going to let you sacrifice yourself because you think you owe me something that I never got to experience. I assure you that if you haven't had something before, you can't miss it." Sherlock said firmly.
"Partners."
"No, John." Sherlock said softly, and his face held more of an anguished look than John could ever recall seeing on the man before.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "For being different, I suppose." He murmured. "Makes things more difficult, does it not?" He asked, opening his eyes.
"Perhaps." Sherlock replied, rolling his hips against John's. The angle was a bit off and it was slightly awkward, but it served its purpose well enough.
"I shall live to solve crimes and hope to be remembered. That's all I can do." He said, and he began to play a melody he usually only let himself play when John was out.
Well, the unexpected hit when Sherlock was least expecting it. It was also the place he'd least expect it: their home.
Sherlock's grip on John's arm tightened as he gasped out moan, coming over John's hand.
Sherlock looked at John for a moment. He could see what John was doing. He could also see that John probably wasn't even aware of it himself. "I'm not interested, John. It's not something I am willing to put someone through." He fixed a firm gaze on John.
"Sherlock." He meant to protest, but the way he said it was coloured with nothing but want. Sherlock smirked as he rubbed John slowly through his clothes.
John watched Sherlock and felt illogically guilty. Had he hurt Sherlock's feelings? He really hoped he wasn't the cause of such a look as the one Sherlock had been too slow to hide. He wanted to say that he couldn't have caused the look, because Sherlock wasn't like that.
"Partners." John suggested.
It was exciting, yes, far more so than when there was a lull between every case. But it was also exhausting.
"John. I'm so sorry." He whispered, caressing John's cheek gently. John gasped, and jolted up into a sitting position.
"Of course not, John. Unless you are looking to commit a crime?" Sherlock replied, and he somehow managed to make it sound like a dare or even an offer.
"John, are you alright?"
He rummaged around in his dresser for a moment before he found a pair of socks. He pulled those on as well before looking over himself. "Minimizing the amount of exposed skin to lower the risk." He explained.
"So wearing gloves works to keep you from killing people. Does that mean that it has to be skin-to-skin? Or is it some kind of proximity thing? Have you tried different fabrics? Different places? And you can obviously un-kill things. Does that work on say, plants? Or is it just people? What about if someone touches you?" He questioned, setting his tea aside. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John was not an ordinary person. In fact, Sherlock thought that he might even be extraordinary. He knew that he shouldn't get attached to the man, but god, if he didn't want to.
"Don't think I didn't notice how excited you are." He purred close to John's ear, a gloved hand coming up to cup John through his trousers.
"You are-" He corrected himself. "Phenomenal."
"Promise?" He asked, looking to meet Sherlock's eyes. It held a lot more than just a simple question. It was a lot of questions piled into one anxiously hope-filled word.
"Angels are ridiculous, but not killing people with a touch? Do you know how that sounds?" He asked. Sherlock sighed.
One touch, and Victor had crumpled to the floor. It had scared the hell out of him, and he'd dropped to his knees, touching Victor's cheek.
Sherlock took to wearing gloves more often, just in case something were to happen.
"But what if they don't care what you think you want?" John asked, brows drawn together and lips tugging down at the corners.
John knew it was going to be quick and dirty, but he wasn't actually ready for how much it reminded him of his teenage years. He thought back to those desperate rub offs in risky places, where neither party was quite brave enough to do anything without clothes on. This definitely felt a lot like that.
"The idea of us having a relationship together is utterly fanciful and you know it. So please stop entertaining such unrealistic thoughts, it's unbecoming of you." He said matter-of-factly, at which John deflated and took a step back.
It was one he had written himself. It was how he felt about his situation, about John, about everything.
Sherlock smirked when he felt the slight firmness there. It was always good to know he was right. John's breath hitched and he tried very hard not to move.
John smiled and let his hands wander back down to the hem of Sherlock's trousers. He undid the zip and then gently pushed Sherlock's pants and trousers down just past his knees.
was about, what he’s going to say tonight. He thinks of what people will say (always
His devotion to Rosie belongs to an entirely different form of reasoning. Rosie’s mother had died to save Sherlock. That level of sacrifice carries unknowable weight- as Sherlock had told John, it was a currency he didn’t know how to spend. The answer of how to spend it came with further reflection. Mary’s dying words to him were “Take care of Rosie.” In her final breaths as she died for him, she gave him her daughter. The title of godparent means little to men who think themselves gods- it’s a title more than it’s an obligation. Mary’s death made Sherlock understand the depth of his obligation. He owes his life to Rosamund Watson- little Rosie, asleep in her crib, not knowing that she will grow up without a mother thanks to Sherlock Holmes.
John is asleep upstairs. ‘Just for tonight,’ he’d managed around a jaw-splitting yawn, after the case had wrapped up after midnight, left in the hands of one of Lestrade’s less incompetent cronies so that Sherlock could address the fact that John had been asleep on his feet since they got to the police station an hour previous. Rosie had been brought along in her carrier, after Sherlock had assured John many times over that it was a burglary and the suspect wasn’t dangerous.
“Molly,” Sherlock manages before he has to swallow against a suddenly dry throat. (Fear response?) Molly simply watches him through the gap in the door, waiting for something. Her weight shifts from foot to foot like she’s debating whether to step back and let him in or to lock the door. He needs to convince her. But how? Lestrade and John have explained the circumstances, so this isn’t a matter of explaining. Feelings, then. She’s hurt. She’s angry. And as for Sherlock?
“I’m listening,” John says. He is. His attention on Sherlock is rapt, like the face before he pulls the trigger.
Then Sherlock jumped off the roof of St. Bart’s, and John spent months lying awake an wondering if he hadn’t kept pushing Sherlock away, if Sherlock wouldn’t have jumped. If John had told Sherlock that he loved him, would Sherlock still be alive? John would’ve given anything to have him back, to do it right this time, to bring him closer instead of pushing him away. But time passed, as time does, and John tried to heal, tried to move on from a separation he knew was crippling. John met Mary, who was brilliant, Mary who taught him to smile again, who could make him laugh at nothing, Mary who was everything John wanted. John wasn’t okay, but he was
John tilts his head slightly, like Sherlock will make more sense from that angle.
After another great loss, another painful deception, John heals. Slowly, though not as slowly as last time. He laughs, if not as freely as he used to, smiles, though not as often. He relearns Mary, relearns her body as it changes with their child. They discuss baby names, design a wavering future, and slowly he begins to forgive her. He thinks of Sherlock, often, of where he’s been taken since the night at Appledore. He thinks of Sherlock and 221B and being two against the world. He tries not to think of roads not taken, of the things neither of them managed to say. Instead, John thinks about the future. He thinks of his daughter. He cringes at the thought of telling her about Sherlock and their old adventures. Sherlock finds his way into John’s head, no matter how he tried to avoid him.
