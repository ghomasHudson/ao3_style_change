"You guys wanna quiet down over there?" said Uncle Sam. "We're just getting to the good part!"
Finally, once Tony’s ears were ringing and Obie had exhausted himself, Tony spoke up, telling Obie that in no uncertain terms was his relationship with Steve anyone’s business but his and Steve’s, and that if Obie didn't like it, he could pack up his stuff and leave.
Phillips blinked and shook his head, the odd look disappearing into the lines on his face. "Not unless you've managed to make one magically appear in the last ninety seconds," he said. "You're dismissed."
"Oh!" Peter exclaimed as a kaleidoscope of bright colours suddenly lit up the sky in the distance, followed by a series of thundering
"I'm not opposed, Captain," Stacy said. "As a matter of fact, I was very impressed by that boy of yours when he came over that evening, and I felt bad that it had to end on such a lousy note." He heaved a heavy sigh, shaking his head. "I guess I'm just not quite ready for my little girl to grow up. She had never shown any interest in boys at all until we moved over here, and—"
"Yes, he definitely does," agreed Steve. He glanced up at the wall clock. "Think you can be ready in about ten minutes? I thought we might take the bike this morning since it's so nice out."
"Yeah, true. And don't forget the guys constantly plotting to kill off the leaders at any given time," stated Ned. He looked back towards his bedroom door as Peter heard Ned's mother's voice in the background, calling for him. "Ah, sorry dude, but I gotta go now."
"Huh?" he said, clearing his throat. "JARVIS? Is that—is that… you?"
"There," Peter murmured as he finished shading in his latest drawing of Mrs Bird and her three chicks, tilting his head as he added a single wayward feather sticking straight up on the top of the smallest chick's head. It was something that Peter could empathise with, always having had such crazy hair as a little kid.
And finally, after Papa had looked his team up and down, made sure that they were all prepared to fight the strongest creature in at least three universes, he gave the order to attack as one, single word.
But Tony only shook his head, his brown eyes glaring bullets that hit Steve square in his heart, ripping it to shreds. "No. You're nothing but a liar," he said, low and tight. "An imposter who killed my husband and tried to take his place. Well, I'm not falling for it anymore, so you can just take your HYDRA ass and get the hell outta here, 'cause you're not getting anywhere near me or my son, you got that?"
"It does not seem like he wants to do that," said Mantis. "Maybe because he knows we will lose if we—"
Uncle Bucky raised his eyebrows, shifting slightly on the chair. "That's a pretty straightforward way of lookin' at it, don't you think?"
Shifting course, Tony flew back towards the hole in the roof with his heart stuttering, landing on the concrete floor not too far away from where Bucky stood guarding a handcuffed Justin Hammer, his expression suggesting that he wished he could squeeze Hammer's head in with his metal hand. Next to Hammer sat Quentin Beck, who shot a sharp glare in Tony's direction before returning his gaze to the feet of his guarding police officer, with a third man with salt-and-pepper hair sitting next to Beck and shaking his head.
"Okay, Mr Stark, I think I almost have it here," Gwen said, squinting at Peter's computer screen from her seat on the floor of Tony's lab. "It looks like Peter was trying to observe something along this part of the Georgia coastline, but I can't be sure exactly what he was looking at."
"Yes!" Peter cried triumphantly as his head whipped from side to side. "Wait! What are those?"
"You do?" Steve asked. "He seemed pretty upset on the phone."
Tony’s hands tightened on the steering wheel as he bit back his sharp retort.  Unfortunately, as much as he hated to admit it, the kid had a point.  Especially since at the moment, Tony honestly could not remember the last time he’d last set foot inside any retail establishment that wasn't a restaurant or coffee shop.
"What in the goddamn
"Hmph," muttered Peter. "Fine."
"Oh, thank God!" Tony knew Bucky would rather die than let anything happen to Peter, and Wanda was powerful as hell too.
Helen sucked in a deep breath. "Well, his foot will require surgery. The metatarsals have been broken and rehealed so many times that they are now grossly out of alignment, rendering the foot pretty much useless. I've telephoned the top orthopaedic surgeon in New York, and he's already on his way here. We'll begin the surgery as soon as he arrives."
“I thought you said you weren’t gonna take any of Obie’s calls this weekend,” he quietly said.  “You promised.”
"Shoot."
Tony's lips twitched into a rather salacious grin. "Oh, really? That's a rather unusual request,
"So far, Captain," answered JARVIS. "However, I am keeping the exit point as a floating variable until you and Captain Danvers are closer to the atmospheric barrier."
"I know you didn't," she said. "But it's okay anyway."
And the fact that Steve had obviously gotten to not only know Peter's father but decided that he liked Dad enough to ask him out on a date, well, that was just funny.
"Listen to me, Птер. You are stronger than them. You are the strongest person they have ever seen, and you can fight this! Ты сильнее их! Now, show them!"
"I mean exactly that, Mr Stark," replied Stacy. "I'm standing right in front of his cell right now, but there's no door or any other exit that I can find and Captain Rogers can't locate one on the inside either. There's just this massive window, but it's not made out of any kind of glass that I've ever seen before."
"So, Uncle Thor was thinking about maybe taking Gwen and me to a hockey game sometime," Peter said, picking up a fallen bit of cheese from his third taco. "And we were kinda hoping we could go before we leave for spring break, so… you guys think that'd be okay?"
He glanced at his clock, letting out another groan when he saw that it was already after 3pm. Through his slightly cracked door he could hear Uncle James talking to someone in the living room, and he knew Dad was in his lab, no doubt talking to one of his army of lawyers to try and figure out some legal loophole that would force HYDRA to release Papa back to them.
"No!" Peter snapped, crossing his arms. "I'm ready now, so let's do this!"
"Me too, Ma," Steve whispered, fighting back tears as he watched Howard step forward and offer Tony a congratulatory handshake. It was a bit stiff, and more than a bit tentative on both of their parts, but it was still more affection than they had shown each other in a long, long time.
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, just shut the hell up, Drax, okay?" yelled Quill. "You can't just erase people from existence! That stuff only happens in
"Then… you believe that this green veld might have something to do with the Soul Stone?" Sam asked carefully.
There was also an eerie, almost unnatural-looking fog rising from the surface, which didn't appear to be part of the lake itself, or a result of the broken ice.
"I'm Spider-Man," Peter said proudly.
Steve's eyes flew open with a shuddering gasp, his chest heaving as he shot bolt upright up on the bed, nearly knocking Tony in the face with his shoulder. Tony immediately gathered Steve into his arms, tucking his head under his chin so he could hear Tony's heartbeat, his entire trembling body coated in a thick layer of sweat.
"Not when we've got a pilot fighting for his life," Papa said firmly. "There's no way I'm letting this go."
"Of course, Captain," replied JARVIS. "Shall I also inform Mr Wilson that you will not be accompanying him for your usual run?"
Peter's heart started to thud as he and Ned approached the house, the pulsating beat of the DJ music loud enough to rattle the windows. He knew Gwen was already inside since she had texted him while they were en route, and he was very much looking forward to seeing her. This was the first time that they'd been able to get together outside of school or the watchful eyes of their parents, and Peter was both very excited and really, really nervous. So nervous that it had taken him almost an hour to decide on what to wear, and then at least another thirty minutes to wrangle his curls into something that he considered more respectable than just having them hang in front of his forehead.
"Copy that, Director," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "We'll talk again soon."
"Well… since it's on a Friday, and we usually head up to the Compound on Fridays after I'm done with school, I was wondering if it'd be okay if I took Gwen up there with me for the weekend? She's been wanting to see my new telescope, and according to the star charts we've been studying there's supposed to be a lot of cool stuff that'll be visible that weekend, and—and we just kinda wanted to see if we could find some of it, and—"
“I know, buddy, I know,” Dad said, holding up his hands.  “I just… I just need a bit more time, okay?  I need to get all of my shit together first, and then—then I’ll go and see Steve.”
"They're just really excited to see you, bud," Tony grumbled, grunting as yet another camera flashed in his face. "Just keep your head down, okay? We're almost to Uncle Sam's car."
"So this was just a 'let's see if we can do this' experiment, then?" Peter asked. "Just… 'cause?"
Tony heaved a sigh, reaching for Steve's hand and squeezing. "I don't know, babe, okay? You're right, it doesn't make sense for them to ask for both of us. But we can just fly down there tomorrow night with Rhodey when he heads back, see what this is, and then come home right afterwards, okay? I'm sure Thor and Sam will be happy to get Pete to and from school, they've done it before."
Peter blinked, not understanding the foreign words. "What does that mean?"
as Sam come to an abrupt landing about a metre behind him and assumed the rest of the team was also falling in, already scanning their surroundings for a possible way out.
Thanos' snap, Steve feared, would end up with far more victims than he had originally intended.
"Love you too, babe," he whispered. "Now get."
Emotionally, though, Steve wasn't there quite yet, and he had a feeling it was going to be a long, long time before he was.
And it not only ruined his life, it made my dad's a living hell!"
"That's fine, little guy," Steve finally said. He pulled back, planting a kiss on Peter's forehead. "And we'll figure out a time to talk every night too, okay? Even if it's just for a few minutes."
It really all depends on what kind of medals they are.  Two golds, in the 100 free and the 4x100 relay, would net him around fifty thousand dollars after taxes, which would be enough to cover the last three rounds of Ma’s chemo treatments and the six months of missed mortgage payments on the house, hopefully ensuring that she’ll be able to keep it.
"Thank you, Bruce. Tony and I both appreciate it very much," Steve said. Not that he figured anyone would insist on Tony leaving Peter while he was unconscious, but it was still nice to hear.
"At the moment nothing besides getting this baby up in the air," Steve answered. "So if you don't mind, I'd like to—"
"Forgive me if this sounds cold, Tony," he said. "But this has been going on for twenty-eight years now, and your boy's not the only one who has suffered."
"Okay, okay, bad example," muttered Tony. He pressed his lips to Steve's forehead, the heat radiating from his sweaty skin almost scorching. "Look. Killian and Stane came after us because they both had a personal vendetta against me—"
"Pardon me, Captain," JARVIS cut in. "But Master Peter is awake, and requesting information regarding Mr Stark's current status."
“Mmmhmm,” Steve said into the pillow.  “It’s—I’m just—”
"Since whoever was behind this attack did in fact manage to kill the Wakandan king, I'd say that's a very reasonable theory, Mr Wilson," Fury said. "And as I told Tony, I've offered the assistance of the Avengers to Prince T'Challa, but I'm honestly not holding my breath on that one. If this humanitarian visit was Wakanda's way of trying to dip their toes into interacting with the rest of the world, I can't imagine that their prince is going to be too eager to make another attempt."
"Okay but, Sam,
“Rog-ers!  Rog-ers!  Rog-ers!”
"What?" Tony exclaimed, wincing as a hot bolt of pain shot up his left arm. "Up at the Compound? But that's supposed to be impossible!"
"Okay, so," he began, clearing his throat. "I'm hoping to nail down the final details for the space flight simulations in the next couple days, and I've got Pete working on the final designs for both the satellites and the tesseract containment vessel. Once those are done I'll upload them so you can take a look, all right?"
"Yeah. Thanks, big guy," added Tony.
But T'Challa had barely given his order when Thanos raised the gauntlet, the Reality Stone glowing a bright red as he curled his fingers into his palm. Stunned, Steve watched as the entire plain began to change, transforming the battlefield into something that resembled a post-apocalyptic fallout.
"That's 'cause you put me to sleep," Steve answered, practically slurring the words as his head lolled to the side, groaning again at the feel of Tony's glorious fingers digging into his flesh. "Your fingers are magical or something."
"Why would you think that I'd say 'I told you so'?" Steve asked gently as he placed his palm on Tony's shoulder, giving it a light squeeze. "Tony, do you really believe I would do that?"
that came over the comm. "Rhodey, how many of those fancy grenades have you got left?"
"I'm pretty sure everyone in the class knows how smart you are, Peter," Gwen said, her green eyes twinkling as she looked at him. "I figured it out on my first day."
Image Peter only stared at Stane, sucking in a deep breath as he regarded him. Then he deliberately squared his jaw, turned his head, and trained his bruised and bloodshot eyes on the grey, concrete ceiling.
It was quite frankly, unbelievable.
Steve cleared his throat, folding his hands on the table in front of him. "As it stands right now, Senator, I highly doubt that I'll be able to give you an answer that will satisfy you, but what I can promise is that it will be the absolute truth."
"He could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of," finished Dr Strange.
“Excellent,” said Tony.  “That’ll be all for now, Miss Potts.”
No wonder Peggy liked to call him dramatic.
“Mmm,” Peter grumbled.  “Then that means
Steve reached for Bucky next, hugging him carefully. "I'm so happy for you, Buck."
"Yeah, it worked," whispered Steve. "I can understand why you keep insisting on going in now."
😣 = the angst is killing me!
But Tony knew the truth then just like he knows it now.  Obadiah was more afraid of a tiny, helpless baby than of the thousands of guns and rifles and rockets that he and Howard built in their weapons’ factories.  He was afraid because he knew that as Peter grew, it meant he’d have to figure out how to control him when he already had his hands full with keeping Tony at an arm’s length.  Tony had suspected for a few years that Obadiah was up to something that was less-than-copacetic, but was never able to prove it.  Howard tossing Tony and Peter out of the company surely did nothing to quell those suspicions.
"Okay, then I guess I'm just a bit confused," said Bucky. "Because—"
And smirking against Steve's skin when he got the desired response, a long, low moan that rumbled up from Steve's chest.
“I’m afraid not, Captain,” said Doctor List, still chuckling.  “We have just been in hiding.”
Steve's lower lip was shaking as he swiped at his eyes. "And I love him, Tony," he choked out. "I love him so much. And it's so hard sometimes to see him the way he is, when I know how he should be. There's no way he should've ever been allowed to get as sick as he is, there's just no
"Pete?" he said carefully. "Buddy, what's going on?"
After getting a rather mournful
"Tony, go to your husband," Sam said. "That's an order."
"Uh huh," Peter said, his huge brown eyes downcast. "Well, thanks for coming back."
Tony smiled, his lips twitching ever so slightly, like he still couldn't quite believe it when Steve told him he loved him.
"An overachiever?" Uncle Bucky said with a slight smirk. "Like your dads?"
And Steve knew Clint was right, that if anyone would know about navigating unpleasant modern political waters, it was Natasha.
"Oh my God," Peter gasped, his heart leaping into his throat as he grabbed his second laptop and opened his recently decrypted HYDRA files. He pulled up the long one that he'd dismissed as the gibberish fairy tale, his fingers tapping impatiently against the keyboard as he scanned it over.
"Very good, Captain."
Tony screamed inside his head.
"It was the
And so was Peter. Steve had seen enough of Peter to know that he had just as much—if not more—of his father's resilience and tenacity, and Steve couldn't wait until the day when he was well enough for he and Tony to get him out of that hospital room and take him home, where they could finally be a real family.
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed as he leapt to his feet, faster than Peter had ever seen him move before. "There's a spaceship! We're all gonna die!"
Steve's bright blue eyes darkened, his grin turning positively shit-eating.
Settling in on his side, Tony moved his hand to cup Peter's cheek, his thumb brushing along his cheekbone as he kissed his forehead. He and Steve had washed Peter's hair earlier that day, and the smell of his shampoo had permeated into the bedding, making the entire bed smell like green apples. Closing his eyes, Tony breathed in, allowing the comforting scent to wash over him like a soft breeze.
"What, no goodbye kiss?" said Uncle Clint as they headed across the street.
"No, no, don't thank me. I didn't—I couldn't—" Steve stammered, watching dazedly as Sam took Bucky's limp right hand in his as they rolled the stretcher towards the emergency vehicle.
“Oh,” Steve says.  “Well, that’s good that you have a backup plan then.”
“Hey, Dad!” Peter exclaimed before Tony had even had a chance to get through the door.  Peter was sitting behind Steve’s counter with a small bag of Doritos in one hand while Steve was helping another customer, an older guy who was looking for something in the History aisle.
It was almost too good to be true, which is why Tony couldn't believe it. Not yet.
"This must be their blood to spare," said Natasha.
And now, once Tony was able to double-check everything through JARVIS, it was ready to present to Colonel Phillips. The colonel had put off their originally scheduled meeting, saying that something else had come up, and while Tony had initially been frustrated by the delay he was now grateful for it.
Tony pursed his lips, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides.  He was used to getting into the occasional financial disagreement with Obie, especially when it involved their military contracts.  But this seemed like more than that.
“Oh, yay!” said Peter as he stifled a yawn.  “So, what should we do now?  Can we watch a movie?”
There was no way in hell he was expecting an ambush.
"Stop!" Bucky pleaded, his face as white as a sheet. "That's not me, I'm not—!"
“Yes, I can,” Steve said, rather matter-of-factly.  “Are you sure you're all right?”
Steve breathed in, deliberately lowering his shoulders. "Carol and I will be up there for over two days deploying the satellites. Once we're done and everything's activated, we'll reenter the atmosphere and report immediately to the hangar to wait for Colonel Phillips's instructions."
"Papa? Something wrong?"
Unfortunately, Steve had no sooner taken his seat next to Carol inside the briefing room when Colonel Phillips stepped through the door with Anthony Stark in tow, a stack of papers clutched in his arms. Without thinking Steve shot to his feet and immediately straightened his shoulders, hoping against hope that the blush creeping up his neck to his cheeks wasn't as obvious as he feared.
"Of course you've been thinking," Tony retorted. His palms rubbed up and down Steve's back, taking some of the sting from his words. "You've been thinking you're not gonna let anything like that happen again, which I happen to agree with. This is just my way of contributing."
"Goddamnit, who did this to you?" demanded Tony. "Who ordered you to attack our son? Tell us who!"
"Thank you." Steve turned back to Scott, who was glancing between Steve and Natasha like he was watching a volleying tennis ball. "Scott, how 'bout we show you to one of the guest rooms? Let you get cleaned up? Maybe take a nap?"
"She means she figured out that Peter is Spider-Man, Mr Stark," Stacy said. "And that he was leaving to go search for Captain Rogers."
"Well, neither did I," he admitted. "Even before the serum, I never thought that I would—" He broke off, gulping against the knot in his throat. "You know, I grew up taking hits, just about every single day. And in a way, I used to welcome it. 'Cause if all the bullies were busy hittin' me, that meant they weren't hittin' someone else. And then once Pearl Harbour happened and the U.S. entered the war, I begged the Army to take me 'cause I knew it was the right thing to do. I was gonna die soon anyway, or at least that's what all the doctors kept saying, so I figured that I may as well die fighting some of the biggest and baddest bullies around, right? And then after I got the serum, well… then I could finally fight back. Finally give them a taste of their own medicine, you know?"
Next to Tony, Peter audibly gulped, causing Steve to place his hand on his shoulder.
"Tony, I'm pretty sure that Nick didn't know anything about HYDRA being responsible for that bombing," Uncle Bruce said carefully. "I don't think he would've deliberately put Prince T'Challa in harm's way like that, and especially if he's trying to court him as an ally."
"Nat—"
Tony's expression grew serious. "I know you're not perfect, honey, but I do know that you're perfect for me, and for Pete too." He brushed his lips across Steve's forehead. "You might wanna be prepared though, 'cause I have a strong feeling that Pete's gonna launch himself at you as soon as you're close enough."
okay, at least physically. I mean, I haven't seen him eat like that in years, and both your ma and Sharon have said that everything looks good, so… why? Have you noticed something?"
"Oh," Ned said. "Well, I can understand that. Well, maybe he should ask Thor to join the police force?"
"Understood," Nat and Thor both said.
Grandma laughed, a soft, tinkling laugh that reminded him of a lighter, gentler version of Papa's.
"And what drug was that?"
"We shall," Tony answered, just like he always had before. Before the Chitauri, before Stane and Killian, and the horrible aftermath.
and let's not even begin to talk about how fucking
"Eh, you know how it is. The kid keeps her pretty busy, probably helps keep her mind off of things, ya know? Keeps her from dwelling on it."
"Yeah, they sure seem to be," said Steve. "Is that why you love working with them so much? 'Cause they're resilient?"
"Sounds great," said Steve. "So then I guess the only question left is, when should we go?"
need to save him," Tony snapped. "What
The next chapter will post on Monday, December 21st.  I do apologise for the longer wait, especially after a chapter like this, but never fear.  I will be posting a fluffy baby/toddler/kid Peter one-shot set in this universe on Friday, December 11th that will hopefully help heal your hearts for the time being 💖
"Oh my sweet boy," he whispered as he pressed kisses all along Peter's hand and wrist. He let out a sort of morbid chuckle as Steve settled into the second chair. "You'd think that I'd be used to seeing him like this with how sick was all the time, but—"
"Oh God, Steve, I don't want Pete watching this," he said. "Don't let him watch it!"
"I'll drive," answered Steve. With how little sleep Tony had gotten the night before, he didn't particularly want him trying to drive in the busy Midtown morning traffic.
"Well," Tony said, his voice cracking on the word. He cleared his throat, trying again. "Well, I have a feeling you might be right about that,
"No, no, not quite yet," Tony answered. "I wanna run some more checks on the security protocols and the command codes first."
And especially for Peter's sake. Because no matter how low Steve got on any given day, it was still a million times better than having to watch his poor son suffer through his own horrible nightmares and flashbacks, and he knew that Tony felt the exact same way. They weren't coming as frequently as they had right after the water monster attack—thank
"Okay," said Gwen. "Well… will you call me if you find anything out? Please? It's not just me, my parents are worried too."
"JARVIS, can you please open a Russian/ English dictionary on my tablet?" he asked as he started typing, hoping that any typos he made wouldn't be enough to skew the results.
But Quill just shrugged as he walked through the damaged hull of the ship, pulling a yellow device from his pocket once he got outside. "What the hell happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis, and the gravitational pull is all over the place."
"Yes," answered Steve. "Please, hurry!"
"Oh, that's good," Steve breathed. "That's—that's really good. I—" He dipped his head to kiss Tony, nearly crying in relief when Tony returned the kiss with vigor. "So when would you like to go?"
"Yeah, you do seem like you're okay," Tony said as he tilted his head, pressing a slow kiss to Steve's neck. "I think this trip's been pretty good for you."
By the end of the two-hour practise, Steve’s voice is hoarse from calling out encouragement and he’s nearly dripping with sweat in his thick button-down shirt.  He makes a mental note to start packing a t-shirt and a pair of shorts that he can change into before practise, hoping that his newly improved range of motion will finally allow him to start wearing t-shirts comfortably again.
"Mmm, I guess you're not too bad yourself," Tony said, barely audible over the nighttime rainshower that had suddenly begun to pelt against their windows, one that Steve had heard about on the evening news report.
"He got shot in the heart, Steve," said James, completely devoid of emotion. "He's dead."
What Steve did remember, though, was that the HYDRA agents posing as FBI who had arrested him on the charge of falsifying his Army enlistment forms had done so right after he and Tony had enjoyed a late anniversary dinner together, and it had been that incident that had propelled Tony into developing his nanite armour. Never again, Tony had told him later on, would he ever get caught so completely defenceless.
A rather big problem, since it was kinda the entire point of the whole goddamn missile.  Obie had already thrown three massive fits about the fact that it still wasn’t ready, demanding in no uncertain terms that Tony have it ready to go by Monday morning.
To which Steve's answering touch responded, "
feel the immediate urge to punch him in the face only proved that Steve's innate hatred for the Stark family wasn't really hatred at all.
Tony made a choked-off noise in the back of his throat at Nebula's last statement, pressing Steve's dog tags harder into his chest. If Steve was still alive, Tony had no doubt that he would already be helping to coordinate things, to be a voice of reason and calm through the erupting chaos.
Tony closed his eyes, imagining Steve's warm hands grasping his own, and the bright stars twinkling in the sky above them.
"No, you're not, and neither were they," Sam said firmly. "General Patton was just an asshole who didn't know any better."
"Of course he means hide, Peter!"
Clint's throat bobbed as he swallowed. "I've already spoken to Fury about it, Cap, and his opinion was the exact same as yours."
"That is correct, sir."
Shooting Natasha a raised eyebrow, Steve hurried into the kitchen, grabbing the bread and the jar of peanut butter as he tried to will his thudding heart to calm down a bit. There were so many possible ramifications of Scott's sudden reappearance that his mind was racing, and he absolutely did
"Sweetheart? What's wrong?"
"I'm not sure you can say completely innocent when he's the one who came up with this whole crazy idea, but I do get your point," said Phillips. "And he will live, Tony. Like I said, I've got a whole plan in place just for him."
But the Colonel was cut off as the enemy aircraft suddenly went into a full reverse-thrust, slowing its descent just in time to avoid crashing into the mountain as it released a small, square-shaped payload. Joseph gasped, running his tongue across his dry lips as he attempted to switch his lock from the aircraft to the payload.
“Tony, be careful!” Steve says as he grabs onto a jeep as it races by, knocking the driver out with a single punch.  “Those cannons—we really need to get inside!”
"But you didn't, honey, and that's all that matters," Tony said firmly. He didn't want to add that he was also more than a bit flattered at how Steve had defended his honour. Now wasn't really the time for one of his ill-timed attempts at humour. "Can you tell me what you said?"
"Sister, we must try and fix the ship," Nebula said, gently but firmly. "We must leave this place."
Tony screamed inside his head.
"I didn't tell you about Steve 'cause I didn't wanna upset you," Peter said once he'd finally regained his breath. "You were already so bummed that you couldn't get here much, and I thought if you knew that some random pilot was visiting me you'd be even more bummed. I know how you feel about the Air Corps, and especially about most of their pilots, so—"
"Eyes on me, soldier. Don't you dare look away, you got that?" he said as firmly as he could muster, his breaths coming out in little puffs of white in the frigid air. He had no idea if Steve could hear him or not, but he also knew that Steve had become something of an expert on reading lips lately with Clint's help, so Tony knew that if he was still conscious that he could at least see what he was saying.
"Holy shit," Tony whispered as all the blood drained from his cheeks. "Steve, that's—that's—"
If direction even mattered out there in space, which Steve honestly didn't know and didn't really care to figure out. He figured poor Tony—and now Peter—knew enough about space for the three of them.
"This was it, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he rubbed soothing circles on Tony's back. "This was the universe we've been looking for. It was almost identical to ours, they had gone through the snap just like we had. And Peter was there! He was right there, right in front of me! This has to be how we win, Tony, it just has to!"
"Gotta take the tiny victories when we can get 'em, honey," Tony said. "And yes, Pete is visually accounted for and out like a light." He slipped his hands underneath Steve's t-shirt, gliding them up his back and causing Steve to shiver. "Now, I finally got Sam's new pack and Clint's new bow up to snuff, and I think I'd like to take a shower. Would you care to join me,
"It's a standard procedure, Tony," Papa said. "I've had to do it before."
"Thanks, Rhodey," Tony said as he got to his feet. "I owe you one."
"Mmm. Well, don't say that too loud around my papa, 'cause he'll latch onto it right away," warned Peter. "He and Uncle Bucky love baseball, and they aren't above trying to talk your ear off about it if given the chance."
They both looked up as Gwen entered the classroom, balancing an inordinate amount of books in her arms, along with a laptop perched on the very top of the stack that looked to be dangerously close to sliding off.
"You're thinking because of all the extra scrutiny we're under that someone might find out about it and use it against us?" Steve asked.
Steve thought, pulling the name from the far edges of his pain-muddled mind.
want to get ahead of himself before they had gathered some more information.
"Oh, I won't!" Peter exclaimed, so much so that it triggered a brief coughing fit. He couldn't imagine that in the so-called "new" Langara that officers would still be punished by the questionable actions of their significant others, but he supposed it was better to be safe than sorry.
"I'm sure they'll tell us long before we actually go on a mission, Buck," said Steve.
"See, babe? Pete's just fine," Tony said. He dug his fingertips into Steve's scalp, pulling a soft moan from his throat. "JARVIS would never lie."
"I don't know, honey," Tony murmured as he cupped Steve's cheek, kissing his forehead. "But we're gonna figure it out, I promise you."
"I don't think that'll be necessary, Mr Lang," said Steve. "But we will be asking some things of you before we allow you to leave."
frightened him, Tony couldn't deny it any longer. He'd fallen in love with Steve.
But regardless of where he did end up going, Peter knew he wouldn't get accepted only because he was Tony Stark's son. He was more than smart enough in his own right to get into any college he chose.
"It's okay, babe, I've got you," Tony said as he took Steve's face in his hands, kissing a path to his ear. "How fast can you get it up again?"
Dad let out another sigh, punctuated by a muffled, “C’mon, Tony!” from Obadiah Stane, who must’ve just wandered uninvited into Dad’s office.  Again.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Hold on, lemme find my…" He fumbled around on the counter, finally finding his discarded glasses so he could read the code for himself.
Which he did, until he was attacked by a mind-controlled Wanda Maximoff and subsequently captured.
"And your papa's time?" Gwen asked.
“Well, go on then, Pete,” says Tony.  “Don't leave your coach waitin’!”
"I will be happy to, Captain," JARVIS said. "Oh, and I also have an urgent request from Mr Stark that you telephone him as soon as it is appropriate for you to do so."
"You know it, buddy," Dad said with a smile. "Papa thought you'd appreciate it."
"Uh huh," came the answer from somewhere in the depths of the room. Pushing the door open, Tony stepped inside, frowning when he noticed Peter's rumpled but empty bed. He glanced up, intending to look towards the overstuffed chair against the wall, and immediately jumped back with a gasp when his eyes landed on his boy sitting up in the far corner of his room by the ceiling, dressed in his favourite Hulk pyjamas and reading from his thick quantum physics textbook.
"That's it, baby," Tony said as Steve paused to suck in air, his arms and chest shaking. "Gods, you're just so fucking gorgeous!"
"Yeah, babe," he said. "We shall."
"I have!" Steve blurted out, shivering as a cold sweat broke out across his body. "I-I mean, I saw—I saw—
A true heartbreaker, as Grandma would apparently call him.
With a rather proud grin, Tony stuffed the rest of the bread into his mouth as he dragged a second chair over to the counter for Steve. They made idle small talk as they ate, discussing Peter's upcoming school year and Steve's initial plans for their next set of HYDRA raids, which they were hoping to start around the beginning of October, pending James's availability to stay with Peter. As much as Tony had softened towards Bucky after the bunker battle, Tony wasn't to the point yet where he felt comfortable leaving Peter alone in the Tower with him.
Tony bristled at the mention of Hank, but managed to keep his mouth shut as Steve began peppering Lang with various questions, including why he chose to jump back in to committing crimes shortly after getting out of prison.
He also knew that Tony was refusing to speculate out loud because he was afraid of how Steve would react.
"C'mon, Peter," he whispered. "C'mon, you can do this!"
"Happy New Year, Daddy," Peter whispered once it was over, his eyes already at half-mast. A knot rose in Tony's throat at Peter calling him 'Daddy', something he hadn't heard Peter say in quite a while.
With him.
against either one of us, so now they're just making shit up!"
"And your name is Peter, right?" Peter asked.
"But then, I met Peter, and then I met you, and together the two of you took the broken shell of a man that I was and managed to piece me back together with such unconditional love and devotion that I'll never be able to—" He broke off, unable to continue as a single tear tracked down Tony's cheek. "I love you, Anthony Edward Stark, and in front of all of these witnesses, I promise to love you and only you, for the rest of my life."
"Oh God, Tony," Steve groaned as Tony pushed lightly against his shoulder, indicating for him to lie on his back. It was almost frightening sometimes, how well Tony could read him. "You don't—you don't have to—"
Peter's attempt to defend Gwen's honour was interrupted by the arrival of their teacher, who promptly launched into a lecture on the fall of the Iron Curtain following World War II. Since those events occurred after Papa's time, him having been frozen in 1945 before the Allies won the war, Peter made sure to take decent notes knowing that he would be sharing them later on with Papa and Uncle Bucky. Papa especially had become very interested in the events that occurred shortly after he was frozen, and Peter suspected it was because he was searching for historical parallels with the current political climate.
Peter's eyebrows shot up, then knitted together into a frown. "Hmph. Well, I'll believe that when I see it," he said, rather impudently. Silly or not, Peter was proud of being the smartest person in his class, and was not at all excited about the prospect of having that challenged.
"Did Peter tell you about the redesign I made for the containment vessel?" Howard cut in, tipping sideways into the wall. "The rhombus? It'll boost the energy output by at least—"
"Uh huh," Peter said sleepily. "I'll look at it more in the morning, 'kay?"
Steve’s face dropped.  “I’d like to see you, if that’s okay.”
"Yes, I'd like that," Steve said. "There's still a lot more to discuss."
Steve grinned, showing off the dimple that gave Tony heart palpitations. "Well… I try. There's no way I can compare to you or Peter though."
"Well, they're only the two smartest people on the entire planet," Steve said, with whatever he'd been planning to say next dying on his lips as Tony suddenly appeared on the opposite side of the aisle, standing next to James.
"Yeah, I can understand that," Peter said, breathing a slight sigh of relief as he finally was able to open his locker. There was no way in hell his dads would ever allow him to go overseas by himself at age sixteen. "I'm sure there'd be a dorm or something they could put you up in though, isn't there?"
"Wait a second," Peter said. "JARVIS, does Dad still have that old lab next to the CEO office downstairs?"
Steve stood against the far wall of Peter's room, trying to stay out of the way as Sharon and Tony worked to pack up the last of his monitors and IV pumps. For Tony's sake they had made a quick stop at Ma's house on their way to the hospital, making sure that she was ready and had all the equipment she needed. While Tony was still very nervous—as was Steve, although he was trying like hell to hide it—he did have to admit that so far everything seemed to be going okay. Thanks to a good friend of hers who worked in the hospital pharmacy, Sharon had been able to amass a stockpile of Peter's IV medications that at his current dosages would be able to last the next three weeks. Anything that Peter might need after that Sharon would have to obtain from the hospital, but given that the Phoenix mission was only three days away, Steve was hoping that it wouldn't come to that.
And then, once the Project Phoenix satellites were all deployed and JARVIS was able to link them up with the tesseract, well… from Peter's perspective, everything would be fine.
Rogers Lane 5: 47.52
"Are you sure?"
"Hey, Cap, Tony," she said softly as they stepped inside, the sharp smell of disinfectant and the distinctive
"No. No more goddamn buts. You know I'm right about this."
Peter's head popped up so fast that he wrenched his neck. "Hang on. You did? When?"
"All right then," Rhodey said, clapping a hand on Tony's shoulder. "Then I suggest we let the guests get home and start packing, 'cause Tony and I should leave for D.C. before dawn."
“Found ‘em!” he says just as Dad appears in his doorway.  “I knew they were in there!”
and now—"
"Ohh," Tony moaned as Steve attacked his neck again, his fingers tugging Steve's shirt loose from his pants to glide up his smooth skin. "No way in hell am I saying no to that."
"So, what did you and Uncle Bruce find out about Wakanda?" Peter asked, cutting Tony off mid-word. He popped another chip into his mouth, licking the toxic-looking orange dust from his fingertips. "Papa said you guys were working on it all afternoon."
Tony could’ve sworn he heard the UI sigh.  “There have been a total of eleven attempted calls, sir, between the hours of 9:30pm and 1am.  As per your instructions, I informed Mr Stane that you were not taking calls until normal office hours began at 8am.”
"No, thanks," Carol said from across the table, her own glass clutched in her hand. "I think we're good."
Tony yelped as he touched down next to Alt-Steve, obviously getting frantic. "
Holding his breath, Steve raised his hand and knocked three times on the door, stepping back when he heard Tony's approaching footsteps.
"Looks like another successful patrol, Tony," he said. "Congratulations. Seems like your plan is on track."
The Winter Soldiers were still bent over Image Peter, chattering in Russian and obviously confused.
Several seconds passed before Tony felt even capable of breathing, much less speech.  Steve wasn’t only the most kind and beautiful man that Tony had ever met, he was also the bravest, always the first to dive into any potentially dangerous situation, and so protective of Tony and Peter that sometimes Tony had to remind himself to not take it personally.
"Nah, I'm used to it," answered Steve. "I'm usually awake before dawn to go running, so…" He pushed himself up to his feet, reaching for Tony's hand once he stood up.
"You wanna take a vacation? Really? Mr If-We-Don't-Train-Everyday-Then We're-The-Ultimate-Slackers wants to take an actual vacation?"
Despite his nervousness, Peter was able to fall asleep rather easily. Staying asleep, though, turned out to be a problem, as a steady flow of nightmares had him crying out in fear pretty much every hour on the hour. Horrible dreams of Papa's aircraft exploding on reentry in a massive ball of orange flames, or of General O'Brien overpowering his guards and arresting Dad for treason, sentencing him to death by firing squad without even the pretence of a trial. They eventually got so bad that the adults started taking shifts with him, thinking that he'd be able to sleep better if he knew that he wasn't alone.
"Okay." Steve turned a page in his beat-up notebook, rereading a few of the notes he'd scribbled earlier that morning. "Um… I'll be there in a couple minutes, okay?"
“Okay, but that ‘dumb’ missile schematic, as you so eloquently put it, is what pays the bills around here,
"Steve?" Tony blurted out, all attempts at professionalism temporarily forgotten. "Steve, are you there?"
—had emerged from its own ashes to be reborn, that Peter could be reborn as well.
Steve had stated.
Plunking himself down on the couch next to Steve, Tony pulled up the incriminating code on his tablet, explaining how Beck had altered JARVIS's programming in order to send files to a private server off-site. To his relief, Steve seemed to take the news in stride, asking intelligent questions in his Captain's voice instead of panicking and immediately trying to get Peter home early from school.
And, if that was indeed the case, then the time had come for him to finish the mission. Because of the vote, Steve now had a list of every single senator who had supported the registration act, which meant that he could determine exactly who in the government was out to get them, and work on figuring out why.
Steve hung back as the three of them walked to Sam's car, smiling as he listened to Sam and Bucky's playful banter. It was amazing, really, how healthy Bucky was now compared to how he'd been when they first brought him to the Tower after Project Insight went down. Back when Bucky had little idea of who he truly was, and when no one could even approach him without fear of being attacked.
"So, what did you do?" he murmured.
"Goodnight, JARVIS," he added. "Can you please turn on the rain sounds?"
Steve's heart gave a flutter as he stood back up. For all of Tony's constant compliments about Steve's physical appearance, he thought Tony was absolutely beautiful, and even more so right after being thoroughly kissed.
"He's honestly the sweetest kid I've ever seen, Buck. And I'd say just as smart as his father, if not more so."
Tony thought, shaking his head.
A title that read,
"Nothing," Peter said quickly as his face flushed hot. "Just… I fell when I was waterskiing and sprained a couple of my fingers. It's nothing."
"God, you're just so fucking gorgeous," he whispered once Steve was completely naked, in absolute awe of the exquisite man hovering over him. "How'd I get so damn lucky?"
Twenty-eight years of rationing everything from electricity to certain foods to coffee in order to funnel as much as possible into the military, and subsequently treating civilians as second-class citizens.
"Yeah, he is, but I wouldn't put much past Loki," Bruce said. "I suppose it all depends on how big a mess he's caused this time."
“Hey, now!” Rhodey suddenly called from the direction of the parking lot, Agent Danvers on his arm.  “Who said you guys could start having fun without us?”
And he hurt you!”
“Yeah, buddy, I know I did.  And I’m sorry, I really am.  But you know how cranky Obie gets sometimes.  And if I don't get this missile schematic done before I leave then I’ll be having to deal with him for the entire goddamn weekend, and I know how much you hate it when he bugs us at home.”
And those of you who comment every week, I love you with all of my heart, and I can’t thank you enough.  ♥️♥️♥️
"Tony—"
"Uh huh," Peter said as he tugged on Thor's arm. "C'mon, Uncle Thor!"
"Okay, but seventeen still isn't an adult," Papa said firmly. "Which means—"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t hesitate to leave me a comment!  😊
"Yes," she said. "When I said that I've never seen you so happy, Steven, I meant it. And Tony is nothing but charming, that's for sure. And he absolutely adores you."
noise that his webs made as they shot out was such a satisfying sound. "I'm pretty sure this is an all-hands-on-deck type of situation."
"Well, maybe we can all go together sometime?" Gwen suggested. "The three of us? I bet that'd be fun."
Which happened to suit Tony just fine, thank you very much.
"Yeah. And I bet it didn't go over too well, hmm?" Bucky asked through a mouthful of chips.
"That's fair," Bucky said. "It's not like you were doing anything wrong either. I can think of a lot worse things than spending your afternoons sitting with a sick kid, even if you did lie to me about it." He paused, shooting Steve a rather harsh glare. "And why the hell'd you do that, hmm? You afraid I was gonna make fun of you or something?"
"I'm afraid I have no good answer to that question, Captain," said Thor, so gravely that Steve's blood ran cold. "I have only what I fear."
"I know that, Tones," Rhodey said softly. "One step at a time, right?"
"Yeah," Dad said as he gave Steve's leg a playful kick. "The big hotshot pilot's all excited to go where no one has gone before, hmm?"
Sam let out a chuckle as he took a drink of his Powerade. "Pretty sure you're not alone in that sentiment, Cap. I don't think any of us are used to how much that kid has grown lately."
"Oh? And what kid might that be?"
Evidenced by the fact that he was already on his third backpack for the year, and it was still only October.
“But the extras are sitting there in the warehouse, correct?”  he asked, just to double-check.
"Yes, it does make sense," said Steve with a heavy sigh. "Which likely means it's Hammer who now has the schematics for the Iron Legion."
"Like what?" asked Peter. "What things didn't you tell him?"
—I didn't mean to—!”
"It is," agreed Peter. He pushed open the double doors to find Uncle James' car parked nearby, with Uncle James and Uncle Bucky sitting inside.
Natasha tilted her head, but thankfully chose not to call Steve out. "I just got a text from Bruce saying that one of his crew members in D.C. found something—some kind of souped-up, old-fashioned pager—down by the old SHIELD headquarters."
"Right," Sam said grimly. "Benign! Nine! Home—!"
"Jesus, Pete," Tony gasped, pressing his palm over his racing heart. "You gotta give me a warning or something when you come up behind me like that, okay?"
And he very much hoped it would still remain so after he confessed to him the real purpose behind the Phoenix mission. Tony had made a promise to Peter that he would tell Steve the whole story that evening, and there was no way he was going to break that promise. He only wished that the gnawing fear deep in the pit of his stomach would just go away already. The thought that he was literally going to ask one of the people that he loved most in the entire world to essentially sacrifice himself to save the other person that he loved most in the entire world weighed on Tony's mind like a massive anvil, threatening to squash him completely if he couldn't keep it balanced just so.
"Uh huh," said Peter. "But you're my dads. You're supposed to say stuff like that. But what if—what if I hadn't caught Gwen when she went over the edge? Then what would've happened to her?"
looks. "Uhh, yeah, it kinda does. No surgeon means no surgery, which means my heart, and therefore me, is pretty much outta luck."
"Uhh." Peter licked his lips, his fingers clenching and unclenching rather strongly around Steve's as he drew in a deep breath and let it slowly out.
added Uncle Bucky.
"Uhh, that was Admiral Nimitz," Peter said, frowning as he flipped his pen again, catching it just before it would have flown over the edge of the table. Normally he would've been able to just rattle off answer to that trivia question without hesitation, but apparently not today.
And now, he literally had no idea what to do.
"I'll remember to eat if you remember to rest," Steve replied. "Deal?"
Gulping down the rest of the lukewarm coffee in his cup, Tony ran through all of his calculations again, huffing out a sharp breath when he arrived at the same conclusion he'd come to an hour ago.
"Not unless you call seeing the occasional comet zoom by weird," said Carol. "I hate to say it, but it's actually kinda relaxing."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I was getting the hang of it," Bruce sheepishly said as he dug some embedded grass from his faceplate. "Don't worry, Cap, I'll be okay."
"Copy, Phoenix One," replied Tony.
"I don't remember calling for a meal delivery," Tony said as Steve set down the tray, leaning back against the counter. Steve crossed his arms, holding Tony's gaze firmly.
"Okay, okay, look," Peter said quickly, his voice trembling. "I'm gonna assume that you guys aren't with Thanos, right?"
“Good afternoon, young man.  Can I help you?” a soft, kind voice suddenly said from somewhere to Peter’s left.  He turned to find a tall, blond-haired man sitting on a stool and smiling at him from behind a small counter, an obviously well-loved paperback held in his left hand.
It was how Tony had been when they first came back from Afghanistan, consumed with plans of revenge against the Ten Rings. Steve remembered vividly the night that he ventured down into Tony's workshop at the Malibu house and found him hovering a metre above the floor, testing the latest design of his flying boots. Tony had missed dinner that evening so Steve had brought him some food, and somehow over the course of their ensuing conversation Tony had ended up firing his palm repulsor off to the side of him, triggering a whole cascade of repressed memories of fighting against the HYDRA regiments during the war.
"Mmm. Not too surprising since he's in a new place," said Tony. "Are Bucky and Sam there with him?"
Steve shot Tony a concerned look over Peter's head, one that Tony volleyed right back at him. Both he and Steve had noticed a few clingy tendencies in their son over the summer, but with how aloof he could sometimes be and how grumpy he still was about not being allowed to do his patrols, Tony just assumed it was just yet another part of his wonky teenager mood swings.
"Hello, Mr Lang," Steve said as he opened the door, allowing Scott to step inside. The man looked like he'd just driven across the entire country, which, based on what Steve remembered of him, was probably exactly what he had just done.
Gwen. You died right there in front of me, and I couldn't do a damn thing about it. I failed you!"
"Tell me what you want, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he trailed kisses all along Tony's cheeks and jaw. "How can I please you?"
"That won't be fast enough!" Tony rasped, his heart threatening to pound out of his chest. "We've still got Carol coming in, and—"
"I gotta get up," Steve said, the words so automatic that they almost seemed fake as he felt a set of sharp incisors break the skin of his right forearm, causing burning hot pain to shoot up the limb like an arrow. "I gotta get up!"
Peter thought as he crouched down, his web shooters at the ready.
"He said, 'Dad, Papa, I'm okay," Steve finished, gasping as Tony tipped forward, nearly crumpling against him. He curled his arms around his husband, burying his face in Tony's hair as Tony's hands slid up his back to cup his shoulders, his entire body trembling.
“Um…” Peter said as he quickly glanced around, realising that he’d spent his entire time in the store in that one aisle.  He would definitely have to come back, and soon.
The sceptre had been Stane's trump card in trying to convert Peter, and they had to ensure that it got played or the whole thing would be for naught.
Someone had gone in and redacted almost the entire file.  After Tony had ordered it sealed.
“Why?” he asked, before he could stop himself.  In the grand scheme of things Steve knew the ‘why’ didn't matter at all, but he felt he at least deserved an explanation.
"You are quite welcome, Captain."
Even Colonel Phillips had asked for a Peter Stark-Rogers original, which Peter had already sketched out and received approval from the colonel. An X-302 with its nose pointed up, overlaid with a phoenix.
"So. It seems to me that you might've enjoyed that," Tony said, batting his beautiful thick eyelashes.
"Oh. Well, that's nice of them."
"We're with you, Stevie," said Bucky. "Or at least as much as we can be." He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "Yesterday I got a call from some staffer assigned to one of O'Brien's inner circle, who proceeded to tell me that since I was injured on a mission that wasn't associated with either the protection or the defence of Langara, that I wouldn't qualify for the compensation fund for injured pilots."
"Peter!" Gamora cried as she placed her left hand onto Tony's right shoulder, shaking her right hand in Quill's face. "Peter, take my hand! We must help them!"
The surgery was Peter's only hope, and everyone knew it.
“Aww, he sounds cute,” croons Natasha.  “Hopefully I can meet him sometime.”
"Sounds good, J. Thanks."
"I love you, Tony," Steve said once they were curled up together on their bed, with Tony's back pressed up against Steve's bare chest and his head tucked under Steve's chin. He pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek, his voice trembling ever-so-slightly. "I love you so much, I can't—"
The last, desperate words of a frightened child begging for his father to help him, and all Tony could do was sit there and watch.
Because now, not only would the Stark family be remembered as heroes in Langara rather than villains, his father would be able to live out the rest of his life with the man he loved.
Not that she'd ever say anything, or even acknowledge that she knew Tony while on Air Corps grounds. Carol may have been Tony's best friend's girl but she was also an Air Corps pilot, something that she valued way too much to go babbling about Tony's personal life to her teammates, especially since she was technically forbidden to do so. The Air Corps code of conduct even stated as such.
"Once this is all over," Steve said firmly. "And by 'all over', I mean once every last scrap and shred of HYDRA is gone. Completely
"Sounds good." With a final kiss, Steve stood up and offered Tony his arm. "Shall we?"
Peter grunted, giving his head another hard shake. And he used to think that Uncle Thor liked to talk in riddles.
"Oh. Was it 'cause of what happened in Africa?" Ned asked. "My mom saw it on the news."
"Just a bit stressed, bud," he whispered. "I'm worried about Papa, and I'm worried about you, and all this goddamn government stuff isn't helping anything."
, had lost.
"Tell me what you want, mo grá," Steve murmured as he slid Tony's loose shorts and underwear down his tanned, toned legs, tossing them over his shoulder. He traced his fingertips down Tony's temple to his jaw and across his full bottom lip, in absolute awe of the beautiful man lying beneath him. "Tell me how I can pleasure you."
the CEO here, which means that ultimately
of Tony's heart monitor.
"Yep," said Tony. "We shall."
"We're not done yet, little guy!" Steve said as he launched his shield at the second target, catching it right in its midsection. He paused, his eyes going wide when the target continued on as if nothing had happened, ripping the shield from its body and dropping it behind another pile of wreckage at least twenty-five metres away.
“Or as charming, right?” Steve added.
"Yes," answered Steve. "But before they could do anything, Thanos snapped his fingers again, destroying the stones and a good part of the planet where he'd settled. They were barely able to escape with their lives."
Steve gave a nod, still clutching Tony's hand. "All right. And where are we on that? Have we been able to uncover a photograph yet?"
"Yeah." Peter fell silent then, his eyes narrowing as he studied the hologram floating in front of them. "How's this coming?"
“I understood that reference,” Tony says with just the slightest hint of humour.  “And, yeah, I actually have a couple of ideas on that one.  But if it’s all the same to you, I’d like a few more minutes to ponder ‘em.  They’re a little half-baked at the moment.”
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas, allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeheh 💖
They were also easier to cook, heating completely through in about half the time as a regular chicken breast. After sprinkling the thighs with some olive oil and a touch of salt and pepper and setting them to steam roast on the stove, Steve set Peter to shredding some carrots, a much easier task for a twelve-year-old boy whose strength varied from one to a thousand at any given time than grating fragile cinnamon sticks. They then added the carrot shreds to some chopped up celery and fresh basil leaves, fresh garlic, and a pinch of oregano and black pepper, stirring it all with a wooden spoon. After adding the cooked chicken and some elbow macaroni noodles, Steve and Peter set up a quick chess game at the table while it all simmered for about fifteen minutes, finally ladling a big bowl of the soup for Peter to try.
And as Tony's hands and lips slid and kissed and nibbled across the whole of Steve's body, as he touched him with such tenderness and care as he prepared him, and as he held Steve's gaze with such intensity as he took him, Steve was finally able to once again beat down the demon that haunted him, locking it back into its cage where it belonged.
As soon as Fury's viewscreen went blank, Steve turned to Natasha and Clint, asking in feigned seriousness, "Can Clint handle the twins on his own?"
After placing nearly a dozen coffee cups littering the counter into the dishwasher, Steve grabbed two bottles of water and padded out into the living room towards the lab, where he found Tony standing with his head and shoulders inside what appeared to be the chest and back plates of yet another new armoured suit.
"Very good, sir," answered JARVIS, and Steve could have sworn that he almost sounded relieved.
"We're really gonna do this?" he asked. "We're really gonna bring him home?"
His poor Peter, fading into ashes while Tony was forced to watch, completely helpless to stop it.
Instead of responding, Steve rolled his hips, pressing Tony down at the same time and delighting in the gasp he pulled from his throat. Tony wasn't wrong that it was an unusual request. In fact, they had only done it that way a handful of times in the almost three years that they had been together. Steve usually preferred to be in control, and Tony knew it. He loved having Tony writhing and panting beneath him, and Tony was always more than willing to allow Steve that control because he himself didn't need it.
"I've got two arms for a reason," he said with a gentle smile. "Come on over."
"Mmm, okay," Peter answered. "I'm guessing she's one of the Honour members?"
"Will you come to bed with me? Please?" Steve asked as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, drawing him flush against him. He could feel his own body relaxing as the warmth of the arc reactor radiated through their t-shirts, and his ears picked up its comforting hum. "I always sleep better when you're with me."
"Really?" Bruce hissed at James, who only chuckled.
And he was even more immensely grateful for what he knew awaited he and his drop-dead gorgeous husband once they got home.
It wasn't Nebula who was at the door, though. Or any of the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
But what Steve discovered, as he and Tony began the long, arduous path of grieving the loss of their son, was that there really was no 'proper' way to mourn. There was only their way.
Retaking his place between his dads, Peter quickly began to fidget, wondering when the actual battle was going to happen. The team had been fighting before the portals appeared, that much was certain. But ever since they opened and everyone came through, it was like someone had pressed the Pause button or something.
"Yeah, I know, but—" Peter broke off, his shoulders sagging in defeat. From what he could tell, Grandma was already barely holding herself together, and he didn't want to upset her even more.
"Got it!" Peter said as he took off running, launching his web at the target's arm as it flew by. Steve gasped as the target used the web rope as a slingshot to try and fling Peter off, sending him flying as he yelped in surprise.
"No, I suppose not," Steve said quietly. He ran a hand through his hair, shaking his head. "Tony, I am so, so sorry. I wish there was something else I could say, but—"
"Shouldn't be so… what, anxious?" asked Sam. "Why not? You think you're the first person who's told me stuff like this?"
Olympic gold medals.  One individual and two relay.
“Say, you wouldn’t happen to know why all of the pharmaceutical trials were suspended, would ya?”
"You think O'Brien might suspect something?" he asked.
"Okay, so… let's see what we got here," Tony said once the hologram appeared. He ran his fingers along his goatee as he examined it, his eyes narrowing in on a layer of concrete dust that had settled deep into the elbow joint. The whole time Bucky stood ramrod straight, his jaw tight and his eyes intense.
"No, probably not," Peter muttered, rubbing at his eyes. He'd been awake for over four hours the previous night working on more of the HYDRA files, and his eyes were already starting to lose their focus.
And then, once Steve and Carol were back and all of the dust had settled, he and Steve would be finally able to get Peter his operation, and then they could finally go
"Was he your son?" she asked. "The boy?"
At least Bucky had Sam, who Colonel Phillips had granted a leave of absence to help care for Bucky while he tried to adjust to living with only one arm, something that up until then had been unprecedented in the Air Corps. Steve could still remember how torn up Carol had been when Colonel Rhodes got hurt, because with her tight flying schedule she couldn't be with him as much as she'd wanted.
Tony nodded as he burrowed even closer, listening to the sound of Steve's strong heart beating in time with the music.
"Well, hello there," Steve murmured as he ran his palm along the smooth dash and the shiny, never-before-touched controls. The cockpit even had that 'new aircraft smell' that no one aside from test pilots could ever understand.
"Nah, bud, I'm not worried about Phillips. But like I said; he came by just a few minutes ago and told me that he would personally make sure that I got out of here on time tomorrow, so you make sure to dust off your party hat before I get there, okay?"
"Okay, so, you gentlemen might've noticed that the cockpit has been slightly rearranged," Anthony said over the comm. "This is because in order for the power source to be able to propel the aircraft through the planet's atmosphere and into space, we had to make the whole thing quite a bit lighter."
"Batter up!" Steve yelled as he twisted the balls of his feet further into the dirt, readying his bat. "C'mon, Sam, I'm ready!"
"Yeah, but that right there's the same kind of thinking that got us into this whole damn mess in the first place," said Sam. "It's not a matter of who shot first anymore, it's all about who keeps shooting."
Steve's voice was laced with guilt, so deep and heavy that Tony had to briefly look away. How in the hell could he possibly think that any of what had happened was his fault?
It was something that Tony did not handle well. Not at
“Well, I should hope so,” Tony said with a wink, just as the pilot came over the intercom on Steve’s plane, announcing that they were approaching the drop zone.  Tony’s heart began to thud, and he swallowed hard, trying to keep his expression neutral.  This was the first time that Steve would be going on a mission without him, and Tony was nervous.
“Yes, I’m fine,” Steve said as he slid his arms around Tony’s waist, giving him a brief but tight hug.  He’d have to ask what was bothering Tony later.  “Peter and I have been looking forward to making our dinner.”
Obie often liked to say.
“Ah huh.  Have you got your glasses?  Contact case?  Snacks?  Calculator?  Pencils?  Phone?  Your head?” Tony asked.  It was a rare week where he didn't have to run something or other up to the school at least once, but he supposed it couldn’t hurt to ask.
“One hundred percent,” Tony stated.  “Actually, how ‘bout we say one million percent, just in case you're not quite convinced.”  He paused, trailing his fingertips up and down Steve’s spine, something he had discovered that Steve found soothing.  “A lot’s happened this weekend, honey, too much to go into until we get you cleaned a bit, so… what do you say we head over to the Tower and get you fixed up, yeah?  I’m thinking a hot shower and shave and some food might make you feel a lot better.”
"JARVIS, you blocked that news footage from all of Pete's stuff, right?" he asked, his fingers tightly curled around his left forearm. The arm had been aching quite a bit lately, no doubt due to stress combined with his recent severe lack of sleep. At Steve's insistence, Tony had just had a complete physical exam with Helen Cho about a month or so ago that included a full cardiac workup, and she had pronounced his heart about as healthy as it could be given everything Tony had put it through.
Peter instinctively smiled. "Was he a lot like my papa?"
Because that's the kind of person that Peter was. Always thinking of others first.
"The next one of these stones," answered Tony. "Wakanda is the home of the Soul Stone, so if Thanos is coming here to Earth, it makes sense that that's where he'll head."
“Sure looks like it,” says Steve.  “Which means Baron Von Strucker has just outed himself as one of the HYDRA moles inside SHIELD.”
"Scott told us that both Hank Pym and his former apprentice suffered brain damage from using the particles too often, and I'm not going to allow you to risk that," Steve said firmly. He swung his right arm, testing the feel of the new nanite suit. "Especially if there's no need for it."
Not the least of which were Director Fury’s resignation, which had been demanded by the President, and also the complete separation of the Avengers from SHIELD.  Steve was now recognised as the official leader of the Avengers by the U.S. Government, and as such, had been asked by the President to ensure that any and all traces of HYDRA were eliminated from Earth.
"Yeah, I know, but…" Steve couldn't bring himself to finish his sentence, couldn't bring himself to admit that the last time he'd needed a wheelchair had been only a couple of weeks before his ma's fateful conversation with Chester Phillips, begging for Steve to be allowed to receive the Project Rebirth serum.
"Mmm." Tony leaned closer, his eyebrows knitting together. "So, is that why you nearly got blown out of the sky earlier today on your patrol? 'Cause you didn't eat when you were supposed to?"
"But you can't," said Peter. "And that's not your fault either, Papa. It's just… how it is." It didn't help that Wanda still felt the need to apologise to Peter—and Papa and Dad as well—nearly every single time that they saw each other. It wasn't her fault that HYDRA had captured her and Pietro and experimented on them, like they had with Peter. Forcing her to imbed those awful visions into Papa's and Peter's minds had just been a part of her torture.
"JARVIS, incorporate these commands into your matrix and then run another diagnostic, okay?"
"Uh, thanks," said Gwen. She shot Peter a sly wink as she reshuffled her index cards. "Okay, Peter. Which two countries were first aided by what was known as the Truman Doctrine?"
"So, uh… Стиви? How'd you know where this thing was?" Bucky asked, his rifle at the ready. So far no one in Thanos' army had seemed to notice what they were doing, but Steve knew it was only a matter of seconds before that changed.
The Avengers. Steve's team, no, his
"Um, I'm pretty sure he just did, Cap," Uncle Clint said with a rather wicked grin. "This is gonna be fun."
"I'll pick the two of you up at ten after midnight, all right?" Mr Stacy said, giving Gwen a quick peck on the cheek. "Have fun!"
Steve bit his bottom lip, his worry wrinkle on full display. "How can I help, sweetheart? Do you want me to call the team? We can get started on the vetting process, and—"
"Well, we wouldn't want the hotshot Captain to lose his focus now, would we," Tony said with a wink, even as he cupped Steve's cheek in his hand and kissed him again, forgetting all about the fact that he hadn't brushed his teeth or anything and probably had morning breath from hell. But Steve didn't seem to mind—or was just too polite to say anything—as he wound his arms around Tony and rolled so he was on top of him.
to create something that actually healed people instead of blowing holes in them, that there really were no more excuses.  Obie had said that manufacturing weapons kept the world from falling into chaos, but from what Tony could see, the world was already there.
"Go on and open it in your room, bud," Dad said. "Papa's got dinner just about ready."
"Holy shit," Dad said slowly, his hand holding the tablet dropping to his lap. "Those goddamn sons of bitches are really going for it."
"Copy that." Steve then stepped closer to Natasha, staring at the monitor in front of her. "Nat, you said my name is on that list, correct?"
"Oh, Pete's a master tree climber," said Tony. "You might wanna be careful though. It's been so long since he's been able to play outside that we might have our hands full trying to get him back in the house at the end of the day. You have not seen Pete's puppy-dog eyes to the fullest extent of their
Tony loved him, Steve knew that without a doubt.  But even with how familiar with each other they now were, it was still sometimes difficult for Steve to be specific when it came to sex.
"I'm gonna go see if I can get in touch with Director Fury now, little guy," Papa said. He patted Peter on the shoulder. "And I'm sure Dad's already expecting you."
Tony thought as he tossed the coffee-soaked towel haphazardly towards a box in the corner.
Too bad JARVIS was offline, or Tony might've had him try and catalogue the design for future reference.
Papa propped himself up on his elbow, smiling down at Peter. "Sure, little guy. What's on your mind?"
"Oh, sure," Bucky said with a smirk. "Whatever you say,
"And he wasn't gonna give it to one now, hmm?" Tony cut in. "Yeah, that sounds exactly like Pym, that old son of a bitch."
Tony dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. Leave it to Steve to continue on the mission as if nothing were wrong. If Tony hadn't been so goddamn worried and scared, he would've been almost amused.
Slumping back against the booth, Tony lets out a heavy sigh.  He should know better than to go toe-to-toe with the world’s leading expert on perceptiveness.
“Oh, yes,” says Mags.  “My oldest granddaughter worked as a lifeguard while she was in college, and she always said the chlorine helped to keep her sinuses clear, so it’s probably good for the lungs too, hmm?”
"Love you too, Dad. 'Night."
"You are such a sap, honey," Tony said as he curled his fingers around Steve's bicep and tipped his forehead against his shoulder. He breathed in deeply, reveling in his husband's glorious ivory-soap-and-vanilla scent as they swayed gently to the music. "You know that, right?"
Tony cringed, clutching Peter's shoulder and Steve's hand even tighter as Sam and Bucky attempted to clear a path for them through the throng of reporters and news cameras crowded outside of the hospital entrance. Colonel Phillips had warned them that the news people had been camping out at the various hospital doors in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Langaran heroes, but Tony hadn't quite understood the scale of it until they stepped outside and were immediately bombarded with camera flashes and shouted questions.
And, since all this junk was just a bit too close to the chest to Dad for Peter’s comfort, then he felt it was also his job to make sure that nothing got missed.
"Yep," Tony had said as he'd burrowed closer. "Just like Pete said."
Nope. Peter very much did
he thought, ignoring Natasha's pointed glance.
Tony gave him a downright wicked grin, waggling his eyebrows. "You know it, babe."
"So, you got any ideas on how I could ask him out?" Steve asked, groaning as he tipped his head under the hot spray of the shower. "Or what we could do?"
"Yeah, okay, but we probably should get started now, shouldn't we?" asked Bucky. "Isn't this stuff kinda important?"
"Look!" Sam cut in, causing Tony to whip around as Sam pointed his guns towards the sky, and the shimmering beam of golden light that was hurtling directly for the ship.
And, most importantly: as much as Steve realised that the Phoenix mission was going to both end the war and save their planet, it was also going to save Peter's life, and Steve didn't want that responsibility to fall on anyone else's shoulders. He was Peter's papa; it was up to him to take care of his child.
"Bucky would've done the very same for me, sir," said Steve. "Or for anyone else in our squadron."
“Really?” Peter says between breaths.  “‘Cause I’m exhausted!  This is hard!”
"Yes, JARVIS, I know!" Steve sobbed, pressing a light kiss to Tony's forehead, which was both burning hot and freezing cold. "Oh God, sweetheart, please, just stay with me! Don't—don't—!"
"Please," Tony pleaded as his hands latched onto Steve's shoulders, trying to pull him up. "Please, baby. Need you right the hell
"Perhaps that question would be answered if you allowed them to come up to—"
“Ahh, do me a favour and move all the files for the pharmaceutical printer onto my private server, yeah?  Anything regarding its design, manufacture, and where they’re going.”
Tony studied the video, watching as the student repaired what appeared to be a severed set of arteries in a holographic patient's abdomen. While he could definitely see the advantage of learning a time-critical trauma surgery holographically than having to practise on patients in the heat of the moment, Tony couldn't hold back the shiver that raced down his spine at the rather dead look in the young woman's eyes, almost as though she was being possessed by something.
“So, ah, Pete, you ready to get going?” he said, nearly tripping over the words.  “Get something to eat besides dusty orange chips?”
"Thank you," whispered Steve. After ordering a humidifier and a large supply of Vicks VapoRub to be delivered to the Tower, Steve retrieved the damp washcloth from the bathroom, cleaning the dried sweat from Tony's body before helping him change into a fresh t-shirt and pair of pyjama pants. Then he swapped out all three of Tony's pillowcases and tucked him back into bed, handing him his tablet and a full glass of water.
Not when Tony was more personable and charming in their brief, hour-long interaction than Brock ever was during the entirety of their three-plus-year-long relationship.  And seemed like an excellent father to boot.
Then again, it was obviously important to Peter that he check out this bookstore, and he supposed it couldn't hurt to get a good look at this Steve person too.  Just to make sure he wasn’t up to any funny business with the heir to Stark Industries.
Steve hesitated, gripping his belt so tightly that his knuckles were white.
"Yes, Papa," Peter said with a sigh. "Liz told me at practise today that both of her parents would be here the whole time. There's nothing to worry about."
He was everything that was pure and innocent in a world that seemed to be on a lightning-fast track to hell, and Tony…
"I think we're pretty much set out there, buddy," Tony said as Sam and Bucky entered the room, taking their seats against the back wall. He held out the MAUDE glasses, which Peter took with a trembling hand. "You still good with all this?"
Only, it didn't.
"Yeah, I do—"
"And you turn into one of them," Peter finished.
"Uhh, Tony?" Bruce said with wide eyes. "Care to share with the rest of the class?"
"Mmm," Tony mumbled, barely coherent. "I'm starting to think that this was part of your plan."
"Understood," said Papa. "Thank you, Colonel. And if you don't mind, if you could let Carol know about Bucky, I'd really appreciate it."
Tony gulped as he checked the monitor. Bucky's heart rate and blood pressure were elevated but not dangerously so, and everything with the interface looked good.
Before he even realised what he was doing Tony had turned around and grabbed Howard by the lapels of his uglier-than-sin robe, slamming him up against the wall.
"Okay, so…" Tony prompted.
"You can't beat him hand to hand!" another male voice suddenly said, gruff and mechanical and so eerily familiar that a shiver raced down Peter's spine, joining the chorus of the nearly continuous ripple warnings from his Spider Sense.
"Yes," Steve said with a firm nod. "Yes, I am."
They were the very same words he had always said whenever he was knocked down.
It was too horrible to even contemplate.
"No!" Tony managed to choke out, startling as Steve's fingertips glided across the bare skin of his waist, his hand coming to rest in the curve of Tony's hip. Tony was still shivering violently, his lungs gasping for air that seemed far too hot and way too thin as he kicked at the blankets tangled around his legs, trying to shuck them off.
"I'm not exactly positive that he didn't, little guy," Steve added, with an amused twinkle in his blue eyes that Tony hadn't seen in a long, long time. "He sure hurried to his car pretty fast after Thor asked him to apologise."
They were quiet for several heartbeats, until Steve spoke up again. "That's how it was for me after the battle, mo grá," he whispered. "And it still hasn't stopped."
"Hmph, patient," Tony muttered. "Like that 'patient' isn't the very same grandson that he didn't even give a shit about six months ago."
During the Compound's remodel last summer to better accommodate the Maximoffs, Tony had added a new outside entrance that led directly into their bedroom suite, allowing them just a bit more privacy in what had become quite a busy household. It was especially nice for Steve, since he usually woke up so early for his runs, and had also proved to be useful for times like this, when Steve absolutely did
"I see," O'Brien said. He placed his glass on the table and took three steps forward, getting close enough that Steve could smell the man's minty aftershave.
Uncle Sam let out one of his goofy laughs. "Well, when you're the youngest kid in this grand madhouse, that's kinda how it's gotta be." He glanced back, smirking when Peter glared at him. "Oh, come on. I highly doubt that anything we've said is gonna change anything. Isn't that right, Miss Stacy?"
And Peter had not only managed to rebuild JARVIS practically from scratch in only a few hours, he had also done so by hacking into the Air Corps systems using only Bucky's datapad, and while gradually becoming so weak and hypoxic that it was a miracle he'd been able to think clearly at all.
"That," Tony said, waving his hand at the air. "That thing you do where you read my mind. Make me feel like I'm walking around with a cartoon bubble above my head or something. I've seen you do with it Pete a bunch of times too, and I don't remember ever reading anything about telepathy being one of the side effects of the Project Rebirth serum, so,
"Okay, but Beck could still be linked to whoever it is that got the data, right?" Steve said. "Could he build one of the suits if he had the blueprints and the components for it?"
"Okay, but… Carol actually said that?" Steve asked, kicking himself for sounding so stupid. "When?"
"How much?"
"Not true," Tony gasped as Steve's fingers trailed down his sternum and abdomen to wrap around his erection. "Pretty sure anyone who's as pretty as you isn't completely mortal."
So instead, after stopping off in the kitchen for some coffee, Tony headed back to the lab.  Settling in at his workstation, Tony tapped his monitor to life and rested his chin on his hands, wondering how in the hell it had all come to this.
"About ten inches shorter and over eighty pounds lighter," Steve answered. "But it wasn't just my appearance that changed. My metabolism got four times faster, my reflexes improved, even my memory got better."
so why don't you just go and feed the beast in the back room and let’s be off, yeah?”
"I've also named it," Peter cut in. "I figured something this monumental deserved a name. But it's a surprise, so you'll have to wait to see it till you get here tomorrow."
he thinks.
"What was that, Stark?" Thor asked. "I didn't quite catch—?"
Tony shrugged. "It's what a lot of people speak here. We're not too far from Siberia, you know."
about this?"
It was the invasion. It had to be.
"But, why?" asked Beck, sounding more like a whining teenager rather than an extremely intelligent engineer. "The MAUDE glasses don't work without the added effect of the drug, so without it the whole thing's useless!"
Bernier Lane 5: 47.88
"Then yeah, you'd better get going, J," said Tony. "'Cause once I'm certain that this works, I'm gonna be building one for both Steve and Pete, you got that?"
"Well, that's a comfort," muttered Dad. "Why don't you try telling us something that we don't know?"
With a heavy sigh, Tony swiped away the hologram.  Now that he knew the machine worked, he had some hard decisions to make.  Keeping the designing part secret was one thing, but there’d be no way he’d be able to keep Obie from finding out about it once he started building them.
It wasn’t the chilly type of cold that Steve was familiar with, like the autumn weather in New York or the training gym at SHIELD’s headquarters in D.C.  The kind of cold that a sweatshirt or jacket or a cuddle up with Tony under a blanket would alleviate.  It wasn’t even the type that used to seep through the thin walls of his and ma’s house during the bitter Brooklyn winters, burrowing right through his multiple layers of patched clothing and ragtag bed coverings.
He had just closed out the screen when the conference room door flew open and Beck rushed into the room, a large tablet under his arm and a harried look on his face.
Gwen gave him a rather awkward nod as she waved to her father. "Yep, I'll be here."
"We don't know, Tony, none of it makes any sense," said Clint. "You're sure it wasn't just an animal of some kind?"
"Stand by, Master Peter," JARVIS suddenly said from Peter's pocket, where his phone was resting. "Mr Stark and Captain Rogers are en route to your location, with an estimated arrival time of ten minutes. Are you requiring any further medical assistance?"
“Ah, which just happen to be your favourites, hmm?” Tony said.  He sucked in a quick, deep breath.  “So, seems like you two are running a pretty decent business here, yeah?”
"What happened to me wasn't my fault, Tony," he said quietly. "You of all people should be able to understand that."
"Take it out, Wanda!" Natasha cried as Wanda landed directly in front of the churning gears, pushing the red light underneath them. A heartbeat later the gears lifted off the ground, separating in the air before each of them slammed back down directly on top of a herd of war dogs.
"We can't let them get that stone onto the ship, Tony!" Papa cried. "We have to keep it here!"
Suddenly, all the hair on the back of Steve's neck stood straight up as the air around him sparkled with electricity. He immediately slammed his cowl onto his head and leapt in front of the prince, raising his shield just in time to blunt the force of the explosion that tore through the trailer like it was nothing more than tinfoil.
"I'm very sorry about that, Peter," he said softly. "It's really not fair."
Tony moaned as Steve broke away from his mouth and kissed a path down his cheek to his neck, sucking gently on his pulse point as his trembling hands worked the buttons of Tony's shirt, shoving it off of him before going to work on his belt.
"Boys!" she shouted, raising all the hair on the back of Peter's neck as he got to his feet, fighting the urge to cover his ears. "Dinner!"
"I love you too," he murmured as he slid his palm up Tony's back, drawing his shirt up. "
look over his shoulder. His armoured fingers were curled around Peter's arm, gripping him like he was afraid he was going to disappear if he let go. "First we've gotta figure out what the hell this asshole's up to."
But even better than that was the expression on his radiant face, one that caused tears to prick Steve's eyes.
Steve thinks, giving his head a quick shake.
"Yeah, okay," Tony said, gasping as his HUD shifted to Steve's face, so bruised and swollen and bloody beneath his matted facial hair that he was barely recognisable. He was lying on the floor, propped up against Peter and holding Peter's hand against his chest with a white-knuckled grip. Peter looked up as Tony approached, whispering something into Steve's ear that caused him to try and push himself up to sit.
"No, I doubt that, buddy. You're the smartest person I've ever seen so I know you can understand just about anything, but—"
"Well… Uncle Bruce said he's free tomorrow, so—"
Everyone looked up as George Stacy entered the lab, having spent the last two hours making phone calls to his FBI contacts.
“How come?” Peter asked, just in case what he was thinking was wrong.
"Thank you," he said. "Mrs Rogers, I can't—I can't tell you how much—"
"But—!" Peter started, startled again when an image of Auntie Nat suddenly appeared, her broken, lifeless body lying twisted at the foot of a huge cliff while a hooded Dementor-like figure hovered near the top.
And Steve would know.
And right on the heels of that particular thought…
They’re quiet for a while, both of their bodies growing more pliant by the minute as their shared body heat goes to work.  Finally, just as Steve is on the verge of sleep again, Tony speaks up.
"Well, you probably don't remember that the twins are graduating from high school in about three weeks—"
"I love you!" Peter called, whispering a soft, "Bye" as he watched Gwen walk up the steps to her front door, which flew open before she even reached the top. Peter's heart jumped into his throat as Chief Stacy stepped out, giving Peter a friendly wave before following Gwen inside.
could’ve prepared him for the sight of Tony Stark, one of the richest men in the entire world, stepping into his tiny little bookstore dressed in a  decades-old rock band t-shirt and a simple pair of jeans, and then clapping Peter on the shoulder like he was just a normal father happy to see his son at the end of the day.
But since he didn't really feel like having to patch up yet another hole in the penthouse, he had managed, at least so far, to control his temper.
"Gee, thanks," Peter muttered.
"Sorry 'bout that, gentlemen," he said, his eyes flicking briefly over to Steve. "Colonel Phillips asked me to oversee the X-302s as they took off this morning."
And while it sometimes annoyed Tony that Steve thought he needed to treat him with kid gloves—he
Papa, how're we supposed to give things like this time if they just keep happening?"
, but Tony knew him better than that. As much as he still tried to hide it, constantly wrestling with his own persistent demons took a lot more out of Steve than he liked to let on, and adding Tony's in on top of everything else only made it that much worse.
"All right, hon," Tony said, muffled against Steve's chest. "Then we should tell the team, yeah? I mean—"
"No, I don't imagine he did," said James. "Dude definitely seems to hold a grudge."
There was another flash of red light, and Steve felt himself being forced back up to his feet only to be immediately shot in the abdomen. He doubled over, choking and gasping for breath, his heart audibly cracking in two as he realised that in order to protect his son, he was actually going to have to fight his own husband.
"Gaahh!" Steve screamed as the third bag finally went flying, landing in a mess of spilled sand and shattered canvas. He stumbled forward, his breaths coming in short, stuttered gasps as he frantically glanced around the gym, searching for another punching bag.
"Rogers, we're—"
Peter gulped as he nodded. It had been Papa's choice to wait, telling Dad and Peter that he trusted them implicitly and didn't need to know all the specifics of the Phoenix mission if telling him could potentially get Dad into trouble. But now… with the possibility of there being a severe security breach in one of the upper levels of the Langaran government, Peter didn't think they could wait any longer. If Papa was going to risk his life on what amounted to a treasonous mission, he deserved to know exactly what he was going to be doing.
"I know, Tony," Steve murmured. "But you don't have to tell me all at once, okay? I'm not going anywhere."
Apparently Justin Hammer, and Quentin Beck, for that matter, had thought it was a good idea to put their suits' secondary power relay in a vulnerable spot. It was the ultimate in arrogance to think that nothing would ever be able to actually get behind the suit to target it, since severing that connection was enough to cause a catastrophic power failure in the entire thing.
"You mean Howard," Tony said. "And me. 'Cause no one else's stuff has ever come close."
"Well, that's about all you can do," said Pepper. "You'll let me know if there's anything I can do to help?"
Steve smiled, that gorgeous, eye-crinkling, dimple-inducing smile that had been so rare lately that the sight of it almost brought tears to Tony's eyes. Why the hell hadn't
Peter wrinkled his nose. "I'm almost twelve, Dad. I'm pretty sure I'm past the cute stage already."
was going to be interesting. Using the portable repulsors to fly had sounded kinda fun when he'd first thought of it, but now that he was getting close to actually doing it, he was more than a little nervous.
"I'm afraid it's not quite that simple, Captain," T'Challa said. "Only a very few people are granted such a privilege, and it is not something that we take lightly. Communing with one's ancestors requires a ritual that not everyone is equipped to survive."
"—that by the time you get approval from the government it should all be ready," Peter finished. "I mean it, Dad. This has to happen, and not just for me. If this works every single living thing on the planet will benefit, and that's worth a lot more than just one person."
So he just couldn't risk it.
"Good morning, little guy," Steve said as he ruffled Peter's curly hair. "What's so funny?"
But even so, the elimination of HYDRA as a threat would allow Tony to focus all of his attention on the imminent Chitauri threat, which, based on the increasing severity of his nightmares, was only getting worse with every day that passed.
"So, did you hear about the guy in Japan who took DNA from luminous jellyfish and inserted it into other animals?"
"Yeah, he did," Steve muttered. The worry wrinkle between his perfect dark blond eyebrows was on full display as he glowered at the screen, an abandoned dog-eared novel sitting on his lap. Apparently the Jackson Murphy dude didn't have much of anything to add to the already low-on-details event.
Not surprisingly, the list was short.
"I was afraid you never wanted to see me again!" Steve yelped. "And I also thought if that was the case, then I deserved it."
"Don't have to tell me twice," Tony said, just before Peter poked his head up from his arm, his nose scrunched up in disgust.
“Copy that.”
And now, as he held his entire world in his arms, all he could think about was that it had all been worth it.  That he would go through it all again, the pain, the suffering, the twenty years in the military and struggling with PTSD—
Peter sighed as he shoved a french fry into his mouth, shooting Gwen a grateful glance when he felt her hand squeeze his knee under the table. Gwen of course knew pretty much everything that had gone down in that Georgia prison, but so far Dad, Papa, and Pepper had been able to frame the footage they'd shared with the news stations by saying that Peter had been taken from school during the dance by HYDRA, with their intent being to use him as leverage in order to get Papa to cooperate with their sadistic plans. Peter had admittedly been pretty upset when Dad and Papa had sat him down to explain why they were going to skew the news stories, but unfortunately since he had chosen to disobey them again by not sharing what he had found with Dad, they told him that he had no say in the matter. He wasn't eighteen yet, so that meant their decisions were still law.
Thor gave a nod. "Yes, that is true. Your encounter here has only solidified my theory that the gem inside Loki's sceptre is in fact one of the six infinity stones. More specifically, the Mind Stone." He paused, tapping his palm on the table. "It is also my belief that it was this stone that was driving Loki's madness when he attacked this planet. I know that Loki has caused all of us great pain, but I also know that he was not himself during that time, and I believe this is why."
"And I've told him multiple times that he doesn't need to be worrying about me," Tony said, cringing at his own petulance. All he was doing was making things worse. "Look, I promise I'll talk to Sam about this stuff sometime soon, okay? But right now all I wanna do is get this questioning over with so we can figure out what the hell Hank Pym was after."
Peter rolled his eyes, bobbing his head. "Uh huh. Thanks for coming."
Tony thought, his lips curling into the slightest of smiles. It was already almost eleven at night, not exactly the best time to be napping.
"Yeah." He sucked in a deep breath, releasing it slowly.
it emanated as it disappeared echoing across the vast plain.
“No,” Steve said, shaking his head.  He had already put the files back, no sense in pulling them right back out again.  “No, I just—I just wanna forget.”
Peter thought as he slid two slices of pizza onto a plate.  Because even though he trusted that Dad had blocked all the calls from the office, that didn't mean Obadiah didn't know how else to get to him.
At Steve's invitation, George Stacy, Gwen, and his only surviving son, the youngest, had arrived to stay at the Compound two days before. Since their arrival, George Stacy had been working closely with Clint and Natasha in trying to catalogue the remaining local and federal law enforcement in the area, coordinating assignments and developing plans to keep homes and businesses from getting robbed or looted, as well as ensuring that the tons of dead cars, trucks, and other debris covering the streets and freeways was removed as quickly as possible so that supply runs could resume.
It was why Howard couldn't even bring himself to attend Tony's graduation from MIT. Tony's mother had told him that Howard had gotten called away on urgent business the night before, and Tony had accepted that flimsy-ass excuse for her sake, but he had always known the truth.
"You are most welcome. Goodnight, Master Peter."
A choked noise escaped Steve's throat, and he looked over at Bruce, who simply shrugged.
If only it was possible.
"And why not?" asked James.
“What did you say the father’s name was?” Steve asks, just on the minuscule chance that he somehow heard her wrong.
“Everything looks good here,” Peter said as he queued up the readings.  “Whenever you're ready, Papa, we can start.”
He was actually still surprised that Dad had agreed to allow him back into the Stacy home after that. Of course, Chief Stacy did assist with Papa's rescue from the HYDRA bunker, so there was that. Dad had also recently extended the range of the Tower's defence drones to reach Gwen's house, which, combined with the two security guards stationed outside by the front steps, was probably just enough to keep Dad calm enough to get through the Avengers' debriefing.
Here we go! 😉
Peter watched as Dad and Papa exchanged one of their eyebrow-quirking looks. "Nothing much yet, bud," said Dad. "Like I said, there's a ton of data here but it's all locked up pretty tight, so we're gonna be working on it for awhile once we get back."
allowed to see him if I say you're not!" shouted Tony. "
But Grandma only stubbornly shook her head. "Again, I couldn't take the chance, and especially not after he got the serum. That serum saved his life, but once he was in the clutches of the Air Corps, I couldn't take the risk that Matthew would do something to him if he suspected that Steven knew something he wasn't supposed to know."
Tony leaned his head against the doorframe, carefully shining the handlamp across Peter's skinny chest as he watched it slowly rise and fall with each of his laboured breaths, the slight
Regardless of who the aircraft belonged to, it appeared to be making a beeline towards the massive Langaran power plant facility located in one of the neighbouring mountains, which meant that Joseph needed to take it out. Immediately.
Or maybe even
"What's that?" Steve rasped, biting his lip as Tony kissed that spot again.
As he slides into the wall after his second backstroke lap, Peter grabs onto the gutter and tugs his goggles off, waiting to see if Mr Rogers will ask anything else of him.
got some things to discuss when I get home!" said Carol.
"Well, maybe they don't know yet. These look pretty new." She reached inside, pulling out a pint carton of ice cream that read Stark Raving Hazelnuts and handing it to Peter. "This is your dad's, and this one, the Star-Spangled Berry Blast, has to be for your papa."
, a vehicle that Tony absolutely
"No, hon, I know that," Tony murmured. "No one is. But as far as perfection goes, I'd say you're a lot closer to it than the rest of us."
"Okay, so… what're you gonna do about it?" asked Bucky. "I mean, I'm not really sure what you can do about the kid, but you're gonna try to fix this with Tony, right?"
"And it burned, right?" Peter asked, letting out a hard shudder. "The drug? It burned going in?"
"All right," Steve said as he gently removed his fingers. As soon as they were free, Tony twisted around, settling himself with his back to Steve's chest. He knew that Steve usually preferred to face him while they made love, but Tony was already so dangerously close to breaking down that he was afraid he might lose it completely before Steve left, and he didn't want Steve worrying about him while he was flying into a potential war zone.
"Thanks for the advice," replied Carol. "Approaching go/no-go in five… four… three… two… one…"
"Um… thanks for that, Mr Harrington, but I'm sure we're gonna be so well-prepared that we won't have to worry about any of that. Yeah." She sucked in a deep breath, shooting Peter a brief grimace. "And on that note, why don't we call it a day?"
"Okay," Steve breathed as Shuri tapped Tony's nanite case, her eyebrows twitching as the damaged armour began flowing back inside it.
It just wasn't
"Okay, but help us do what, exactly?" Steve asked. "If Fury was trying to contact someone at the exact moment he was fading into ashes, then it's a bit late now, don't you think? I mean, how do we even know that whoever this is actually got the message?"
"No, babe, you can't go blaming yourself!" Tony protested. "There's nothing more that you could've done—"
It was working. All he had to do now was rid the rest of JARVIS's coding of any mentions of Ultron, and Papa would be good to go.
How in the hell could I have missed them?"
"I agree, sir," Steve said quietly. "And thank you."
"Yeah, I guess that makes sense," Peter said as he carefully eased onto the street. It wasn't quite rush hour yet, so the traffic was fairly minimal. "That last battle was a bit of a doozy, so I guess I can give them a pass this time."
Peter stuck his bottom lip out as he nodded. "You really think so?"
Steve barked out a laugh, his fingers tightening around Tony's. "I'm sure I could arrange for something like that," he said as he shot Tony a look that was pure smouldering intensity. "As soon as Peter goes to bed tonight, okay?"
And it was similar for Tony as well, as Tony still insisted that no matter how sweaty or stinky Steve was, his skin always smelled of vanilla, which had always been one of Tony's favourite scents. That plus the fact that Peter's precious curls always smelled faintly of green apples and Steve was one happy family man, surrounded by his boys and their comforting, foody-type scents.
"Are you seriously asking me that?" Tony replied. "God, Steve, you're just… you're just—" He paused, clearing his throat. "You're just fucking gorgeous, honey. That's all."
Happy grimaced. "Actually, he's already scrubbed in and talking the surgeon's ear off, asking him all kinds of questions. He told me that he wanted to be in there with you guys, and I'm sorry, but I just couldn't say no to him."
" Tony said, delighting in the light pink blush that worked its way up Steve's cheeks. "Do enlighten us, hmm?"
"As you wish, sir," answered JARVIS. "However, as I have already stated, all pre-flight checks on the three space-faring aircraft have come back clear." There was a short pause as he completed the ordered check. "Pre-flight check complete. As of this moment the mission is a go."
"Peter, what're you still doing awake? It's really late!" Ms Sharon said, startling him as she stepped into the room, her stethoscope at the ready. She had offered to take over checking on him during the night so Grandma could try and get some sleep.
“All right, sweetheart,” Steve whispers.  He swallows down his fear that either he or Tony might not wake up again, choosing to retain at least some of the “giddy optimism” that Tony mentioned back in the beginning.
, but Sam had warned Steve prior to his discharge that the reporters were all very eager to hear statements from Steve and Tony as well.
"I gotta go, Tones," Rhodey said as he handed Tony the receiver. "Gotta finish my paperwork."
It was the same way that Dad had always been whenever Peter was sick as a little kid, and when Papa had been in the hospital after the Malibu house bombing and the Project Insight mess. He just couldn't rest when someone he loved was sick or hurt.
"What the—?" Uncle Clint said as a massive portal began to open in the cloud-dotted sky above the plain, an almost exact replica of the portal Loki had used to bring the Chitauri into New York. "Is that—?"
"But what?" asked Phillips. "Why the sudden interest all of a sudden, Rogers? For crying out loud it's been ten damn years!"
"We're attempting to verify it now, Rogers!" O'Brien snapped. "Stand by!"
The cat stared at Tony for several seconds, tilting her head like she was contemplating whether he was worthy or something.  Then she walked back and forth across the doorway three times before heading back towards the back where she’d come from, pausing once to look back at Tony over her shoulder.
"Get this to Maria Hill ASAP, we need to put out an arrest warrant on Adrian Toomes before he can get the hell outta dodge. And something tells me he's gonna need protective custody, 'cause I don't think his bosses are gonna be too happy with him once we get our hands on him."
Instantly, Steve's eyes darkened again, his half-hard cock twitching where it rested against Tony's hip.
“In third place, from France, Jacques Dernier!”  As the crowd cheers, Steve hoists himself out of the pool, grabbing his towel to blot his face before offering his hand to Jacques.
Tony scoffed, catching his bottom lip between his teeth as he dug under Peter's blanket and pulled out his waterlogged phone. "JARVIS?"
"Peter, please, little guy, just hold on, okay?" Papa yelled again. "Dad's gonna get you!"
"Ah huh. And did he build any safeguards in there to prevent someone else from grabbing on to you? Such as the Meridian government?"
Which was also the year that Tony had started phasing JARVIS into the rest of Stark Industries. Having finally worked out most of the bugs with the UI at home, Tony began implementing JARVIS into the SI mainframe in small stages over the course of several months. He had also implemented pretty strict—at least at the time—safeguards against tampering, but he supposed it wouldn't have been too difficult for someone who knew what they were doing to make some minor changes to JARVIS's programming without his knowledge.
it contained first-edition printings of the other six novels as well.  All in hardback, and each with their original concept covers.
"It's about as convincing as I can muster at the moment, babe," Tony grumbled. "'Cause right now I'm just too damn tired to do any better."
"Absolutely nothing," stated Carol, earning an eyeroll from James. "I'd personally be more worried if all you two were doing was just going to sleep every night."
"Really? That's so awesome!" Peter exclaimed. Gwen had told him that she'd sent in several applications for different summer internship programs for the following year, hoping that her experience working at Stark Industries over the previous summer would be a good stepping stone.
"Um, with all due respect," Scott said, raising his hand. "Don't you guys think I should go first? Since I'm the only one who's been in there before?"
"Daybreak."
"Please,
At the edge of the gym, Peter took advantage of the teacher chaperones' distraction with students making out behind the bleachers to slip into the hallway, heading for his locker. He quickly changed his clothes, cringing as he stuffed his nice suit into his locker and slammed the door, hurrying towards the nearby boys' room where he'd hidden his cloned phone. It was the same restroom with the busted window where he used to sneak out for his Spider-Man patrols all those months ago, behind the tall set of bushes and still out of the sightline of Happy's security guards.
as the ends realign are the final straws for Steve’s whirlpooling stomach.  He lurches to the side, coughing and choking as he barfs all over the cement floor, vaguely aware of Tony’s hands gently cupping his shoulders, keeping him from tipping over.
"Well, I can't promise anything," Sam said with wide eyes. "That'll depend on how much this one ends up pissing me off."
Choosing his business partner over his very own flesh and blood… not even Tony had believed that Howard could stoop that low.
demanded Rhodey.
Just like he had.
Tony had never pushed Steve to talk about it afterwards, and Steve definitely hadn’t volunteered to do so.  During the war, soldiers were called “chicken shits” for daring to express even the slightest amount of fear, and that combined with the permanent chip on Steve’s shoulder from when he’d been so small and sickly was not something he was prepared to let go of so easily.
"Peter, maybe we should quit talking about this stuff," Uncle Bucky said worriedly. "All it's doing is making you worse!"
Tony jumped as Fury slammed his palm onto the desk before leaning forward, almost like he was trying to crawl through the screen.  “Goddamnit, Tony!  With the unbalance in that area it’d be a suicide mission!  Think of your son!”
"You gave up all the rights to your wardrobe the second you married me, honey," Tony said, groaning in frustration as Steve once again refused to touch him where he needed him most. "What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine, right? The fact that you can't fit this god-like body of yours into anything of mine is completely beside the point."
"Yes, please. Thank you," said Steve. "Please tell him that I'll talk to him later in the day."
Who, for all intents and purposes, had been perfectly cooperative ever since he got caught, even going so far as to relinquish all of his equipment to Bruce so he could take a look at it. The uniform itself was crude, Bruce had told Tony on the flight home, but still effective for its intended purpose. But it was really the tiny red particles encased in the clear glass vials on Lang's belt that were the key to the whole thing, allowing Lang to shrink and un-shrink as needed.
"Uh huh!" Gwen gasped, nodding as her fingertips dug into Peter's arm. "Peter, what—what's happening? What is this?"
"I feel—I feel… good. Like I can actually breathe for once," he finally said. Then he frowned, glancing down at his chest. "What happened? Did I have my surgery?"
"Mmm," muttered Tony, raising an eyebrow. "And what about yours?"
Of course, Steve didn't know that at the time. Sarah Rogers had been a very proud Irish woman, and as such, did not like to broadcast just how precarious their finances were, and especially not to him. Steve knew that they didn't have as much money as Bucky's family since Bucky's papa was still alive and able to work, but if he'd have known then that his new sketchbooks and pencils had cost his ma three days worth of dinners for herself, he would not have been nearly as enthralled with them as he was.
As silently as they could, they tiptoed closer to where Strange was suspended, the long, silvery spikes now sticking out all over his head and body. The alien had his back to Tony, still monologuing in that skin-crawling, soft-ass voice that reminded him way,
"Goodnight, Peter," said Papa. "Sleep tight."
, is what that sounds like. Do I wanna know why in the
"Our son," he said, with only a hint of sheepishness.
"You don't usually bug me about stuff that shouldn't be bugged," Tony said. "What's up?"
"Thor, now!" Steve nearly choked as Thor immediately launched his axe towards Thanos, aiming it directly for the giant brute's neck.
But aside from that, there was apparently something going down that night, and not too far from where Peter was at that very moment.
Tony was quiet for several heartbeats. "Well, I guess we are. Isn't that part of the Avengers' mission? To take down HYDRA?"
"As a grandma should, yeah?" Tony said sadly. "Pete never got to meet my parents either, but… I know my mom would've loved him. It's not fair that he only had me for so long. Well, me and Rhodey. Rhodey adores him, loves him as an uncle, but it's still not the same, ya know? Obie had the chance, but… the asshole just never took it."
Steve watched as the corporal disappeared behind a door on the opposite side of the ornate room. He stood at attention while he waited, his hands at his sides as he tried to keep his expression neutral. That morning had been the first time he'd been able to run again after the attack, and he'd practically ran himself into the ground trying to work through his nervousness. Steve had never been skilled at hiding his emotions, but it was going to be an absolute necessity now.
"Happy New Year, JARVIS," he said once he'd started the dishwasher in the cozy kitchen. He and Peter had managed to get JARVIS fully programmed into the house over the summer, and Tony was grateful for the extra layer of security that the UI provided, as well as the familiar comfort of his voice.
Steve thought, his eyes narrowing slightly as he burned the image of the offending senator—a woman from Pennsylvania—into his memory. So far the tally was 17 Yea and 17 Nay, with two senators who were believed to be abstaining.
"Then where the hell did this dose come from?" Tony finished.
"I wasn't flirting, Buck," Steve whispered sharply. "I only asked a simple question, and—"
It was like Sam had said; that they had been up there just to watch.
"Okay, so then you gotta promise me that you're gonna tell him," Peter had stated. "Dad doesn't like secrets and he's really overprotective of me, so please don't wait too much longer."
"Oh yeah? What about?"
“Uh huh.  Love you too.”
"You know, Gwen, that's a great idea," Mr Harrington said as he shot to his feet so fast it was like he had sat down on a pushpin or something and started running towards the exit. "'Cause I just remembered that I forgot to turn off my coffeepot before I left this morning, and… oh boy, that'll be the third one this month already, and… um… class dismissed!"
And not that they had discussed Sam and Bucky's sex life in great detail, but Sam had also mentioned to Steve a few times during their runs that sometimes when Bucky was going through a rough patch mentally, he just wasn't interested. And that even with all of his knowledge and training, Sam still had to remind himself not to take it personally.
And he had been
It just didn't make sense, or at least it wasn't making too much sense at four in the morning when he was drop-dead exhausted. Peter was enhanced, that much was true, but it wasn't like he was the only enhanced person out there. Papa, Uncle Bruce, Uncle Thor, and Uncle Bucky were also inherently enhanced, meaning that their abilities didn't depend on specialised equipment like Dad and the rest of their family members. But why was Peter being singled out as the target for all of these experimentally enhanced people? Why not Papa, who the senate was personally targeting with their smear campaign, or even Uncle Bucky, who had already been caught in HYDRA's clutches once before and who was also still sensitive to the trigger words?
“Mmm.  He damn well better be.”  Downing the last of the coffee in his cup, Tony rolled his shoulders, trying to ease some of the tight soreness that had taken up permanent occupancy across his neck and upper back.
It had taken nearly every ounce of Steve's inner strength to not completely fall apart right there in the coffee shop as soon as JARVIS uttered the word "lake", the memories of what had happened up at the Compound slamming to the forefront of his mind. If it hadn't been for Tony's quick action, and the stoic, no-nonsense look on his face that Steve knew only barely hid his own panic, he wasn't sure if he would've been able to hold himself together.
This attack brought the total to three which was scary enough, especially since this one had almost triggered Uncle Bucky as well. But now they also had to deal with the fact that Peter had very likely revealed his identity to Gwen's father, who as far as they knew still had orders to arrest the vigilante known as Spider-Man on sight.
me, they would immediately run for the mountains and never look back. And I liked to use the excuse that I did it to protect my son, but what I was really doing was just reinforcing the walls that I'd so masterfully built around my heart. Walls that you then managed to completely tear down with just a few kind words and a couple flashes of that sexy-as-hell dimple."
"As soon as Thor snaps his fingers and Thanos and his army are gone, the Soul Stone will be returned. You have my word," Steve said. "I know how important the stone is to your people."
As soon as the words left Peter's mouth a massive wave of guilt washed over him, one so strong that it nearly knocked him sideways. Here he was, sneaking around behind his dads' backs, getting involved in the very thing they didn't want him involved in. They had been keeping all of this stuff from him the whole time because they were trying to protect him, and now Peter was basically spitting right in the face of their fear.
"All right," said Papa as an alien jumped off one of the Chitauri's speeders and landed next to Thanos, one who just happened to look exactly like the guy who had tried to take the Time Stone from Dr Strange.
Uncle Bucky shot him a rather cheeky grin. "Yeah, sure. Usually guys don't turn as red as a tomato when they're talking about just friends, kiddo."
"Arm was hurting again last night," he said quietly. "Couldn't get comfy. Sam tried to help, but… eventually it got so bad that I sent him back to the barracks to get some sleep. Poor guy hasn't had a decent night since—" He broke off, gulping. "Well…
"All emergency crews to the runway!" Phillips barked into the hangar PA system. "Alert the hospital that we've got an injured pilot coming in, condition as of yet unknown!" Then he whipped around, pointing at Rhodey. "Get on the comm to the backup patrol pilots, I want them in the air ASAP! Tell them that they have permission to fire at anything that even dares to show its face, you got that?"
Arriving back at the main building, Steve bypassed his and Tony's private entrance and headed directly for the gym. James had offered to check in on Tony while Steve was out running, an offer he insisted that Steve take when Steve tried to decline. He didn't like people thinking that he needed help with Tony, even though James and Natasha, and even Bruce, on occasion, had all recommended multiple times that he take a break every now and then.
"Oh, you have no idea," scoffed Grandma. "Oh, but my parents absolutely loved him. Matthew was a bit older than me, already a Lieutenant Colonel by the time he tried to court me, and so smooth and charming that he had my mother practically eating out of his hand after only one meeting." She scowled, waving a dismissive hand. "And he was indeed very charming, and an absolute master at telling people what he believed they wanted to hear. But there was something about him that just… unnerved me. Something… sinister."
used just a bit of my influence as an Air Corps pilot to ask them very nicely if they wouldn't mind cooking something for me."
sweetheart. Just you."
—body. And how Steve could possibly desire an old, scarred man like himself still floored him.
"Have a wonderful summer, everyone!" the teacher called as the students shot out from their chairs like Uncle Clint's arrows, practically tripping over each other in their haste to escape from the room. Shoving his books into his backpack, Peter slung it over his shoulder and stepped back, waiting semi-patiently as Gwen packed her laptop and books into her bag. They had both cleared out their lockers the day before, and so only needed to grab what was left and head out to the parking lot.
"Oh. That's too bad, Peter," said Mrs Stacy. "I'm very sorry."
"Oh, Captain Rogers!" Gwen cried as fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. "I'm—I'm so sorry! Peter—I never meant to—"
"No. You don't."
"Hey, little guy!" Steve said as he swept into the room, sketchbook and pencil in hand and a wide smile on his face. "How're you doing today?"
“Hey, J?”
"We are approaching the exit point now, Captain," said JARVIS. "Atmospheric exit in five… four… three… two… one… exit."
“Ha, ha, ha.”
"Tony," he said again, low and thick against Tony's neck as Tony's fingers combed through his sweat-dampened hair. "Tony, I love you!"
"Whew! That was way too close!"
“Oh, Christ,” Tony mutters as his gauntlets slide down his forearms to cover his fingers.  He stares at his left hand for a few seconds, mumbling something under his breath as he disconnects the armour covering his left pinky.
days. There's a lot of times that I wish his job was more boring than it is, and so does my mom."
"Alrighty, then. Let's do this."
"There," Peter said with a rather triumphant smile. "Look okay?"
"Will do."
"Mr Stark," Bartlett said, pulling his badge from his breast pocket as Tony's belly gave a hard swoop. "Captain Rogers. Good evening."
Steve was quiet as he and Tony made their way towards the elevator, their hands clasped tightly together. His entire body felt numb, the burst of energy he'd felt during his reentry and safe touchdown now completely gone, leaving him wishing for nothing more than to curl up in bed next to Tony and sleep for the next week or so.
And, one of Tony's absolute favourites, watching as his husband and son worked together in the kitchen to prepare their meals, listening to their goofy, never-ending banter while he sat at their table finalising the designs for whatever latest thing Colonel Phillips was asking of him.
"Except what, Clint?" demanded Steve. "JARVIS, how did this happen?"
"Yeah, baby, that's me," Tony said as he kissed his way back up to Steve's glorious mouth. He groaned as Steve's tongue slipped between his lips, stroking against his own. It still amazed Tony that even now, after the millions of kisses that he and Steve had shared, Steve still took his time to explore Tony's mouth as though it was his very first time.
"Can you please start compiling files on these individuals? Military histories, work histories, things like that? I wanna know how and why these names wound up in a HYDRA bunker. And if you can find their current whereabouts, that would be very useful too."
"Yes, Master Peter?"
"Peter," Gwen whispered as he drew back, wishing they were anywhere else but school. "It's okay."
“I’ve just gotta feed Ashes real quick, okay?” he said to Tony.  “Then we’ll be out of here.”
"We need to know what we're up against, Tony, you know that," he answered, gripping his pencil as he frowned at the television. "And I'm tired of always being three steps behind the enemy. It's time that I quit slacking."
Tony breathed in as he took Steve's hand. "Together?"
"Are you ready, sweetheart?" he murmured as he began kissing across the small of Tony's back, his fingers dipping teasingly into his crack.
"Oh God, buddy," Tony rasped as he pitched forward, burying his face in Peter's hair as he peppered him with kisses. "You've been out for awhile, but I think—I think you're gonna be okay now. Helen said we just needed to give you time, so—"
he thinks, hoping against hope that the flush in his cheeks can be explained away by the fact that he just stepped onto a humid pool deck.
"Oh. Uh huh," Peter said through another yawn. "Can we still stop and get some food on the way home?"
"Run, young Starkson!" Peter heard as lightning bolts burst out from inside the monster, merging with the electrical charge from Auntie Nat's Widow's Bites and Uncle Clint's arrows, which Peter just happened to notice were made from wood and fibreglass rather than metal.
"Uh huh." Peter didn't even look up as she exited the room, his tongue poking out between his teeth as he studied the code he'd just written.
"Yes, I can see that," O'Brien said. "Well, I hope you don't mind if I indulge, hmm?"
"Okay, what're we missing here?" Tony asked from his spot cross-legged on the floor of the lab, the blue holographic image of the time-space GPS he'd constructed, or compass, according to Steve, hanging in the air above his head. He let out a sigh as he raised his arms up over his head, tipping his head from side to side to try and stretch out his aching shoulder and back muscles. He would definitely have to take Steve up on his offer for a backrub later.
“So, I’m thinking we should first try and establish where exactly we are,” he begins.  “‘Cause I don't know about you, but it sure seems to me like we’re not in Kansas anymore.”
Or give him a heart attack, which is mainly what Steve worried about. Dr Cho conducted cardiac examinations and tests on Tony's heart function on a regular basis, and everything pointed to it being as healthy as it could be, but Steve still worried about him. He still didn't eat very often unless Steve or Peter encouraged him, he still didn't get enough sleep, and he still drank enough coffee to supply an army, none of which was good for keeping his heart healthy.
"I do indeed, sir. The check will arrive in approximately one hour via courier."
"Okay, so… how long was all of this gonna go on?" he demanded, his fingers curling around his left forearm. "I worked my ass off on every single one of those designs, under constant orders—actually, more like threats—to always stay ahead of the enemy's tech, and for what? Only for them to be turned over to the enemy as soon as our guys tested 'em out?"
"Tony—"
A small laugh tore from Peter's throat. "Yeah, they've both told me a few stories."
Nine days, to be exact.
"Mr Stark's body temperature is currently thirty-eight point eight Celsius, Captain," answered JARVIS. "Heart rate is one hundred and ten beats per minute, respiratory rate is twenty-two breaths per minute. All three are elevated."
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "I'm not asking you to help me," he said. "Just—"
But not Peter. Peter he had just pulled apart, leaving him to die out there on that barren rock. And now—
Which, although he'd become a certified expert at hiding it over the years, Tony was getting a lot closer to than he wanted to admit.
"Get—get me out?" Papa stammered. "But—but—I thought—" He planted his palm against the floor, grimacing as he pushed himself up into a semi-sitting position, his head tilting as he tried to focus in on Peter's face. "Peter, what in the world are you doing here? Is Dad with you?"
to be it!" Peter whispered, burying his face into his polar bear. It couldn't have been just a coincidence that someone—or something—had activated a defence drone up at the Compound, which just so happened to be the place where the sceptre was being stored.
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, heaving a heavy sigh.
"No, no, Cap, we're all fine," Clint said as Steve reached for Tony's hand. "And yeah, under normal circumstances, it is supposed to be impossible to break in because JARVIS would've blasted the bastard right outta here with the drones the second he showed his face. Except—"
And the last thing that Howard heard before he was shoved into the backseat of the Safety Officers' car, was the sound of his wife attempting to comfort his son, trying and failing to hold back her own sobs of despair.
and he just couldn't seem to help himself from enjoying them whenever he had the chance to take one out.
Steve would whisper into his ear, his right arm tucked snugly around Tony's waist and his left hand holding Tony's against his chest. "
“If I have to run back to the shop while you’re swimming, I will,” says Dad.  “Don't worry, buddy, yeah?  We’ll make it work.”
Aside from that, the logistics didn't really matter.
"Hey, Tony," Natasha said as her face filled the viewscreen. "You got a minute?"
The buzz of his phone in his pocket startled Steve so badly that he let out a soft grunt, pressing one palm to his chest as he retrieved both it and his list.  The buzz was just another text, one that he ignored like he had all of the others, but now that Tony’s visit was over, he needed to cross it off the list before he could move on to the next item.  He picked up the pencil he kept next to the register, biting down on his bottom lip as he drew a straight line through his hastily scribbled words.
"I've already watched one dictator's rise to power, and I'll be damned if I'm going to watch another," Steve concluded. "And I hate to have to say it, but all the signs are there, and it might just wind up being up to us to prevent history from repeating itself."
Steve thinks as a wall of shame suddenly hits him like a sledgehammer.  A massive shiver ripples through his body, and he gasps, wrapping his arms around his front.
He was just so. Goddamn.
Dr Strange shot him an annoyed look. "No, your father isn't dead."
"Exactly what it sounds like," replied Bucky. He poked his head over the metal divider, resting his chin on it. "When was the last time you went on a date, anyway?"
"Not likely," Steve agreed as he leaned over the microphone. "C'mon, Bucky, you're almost there!"
"Ugh," Tony muttered, fighting against the almost overwhelming urge to roll his eyes.
Turning out the overhead lights, Steve crawled onto the bed, carefully removing Tony’s glasses from his face and placing them on his bedside table.  He went next for the computer, chuckling when Tony’s fingers instinctively tightened on it as he tried to pick it up.
"Hey, Papa," Peter said as he tucked his head under Steve's chin. "How long was I out this time?"
I can’t thank you guys enough for all of your wonderful comments, thank you so much for reading! 💜
"Got it, Cap," said Bruce as he grabbed a medical kit and jumped out of the truck, hurrying over to where Sam was laying the man out on the grass with Steve on his heels. The man's skin was very pale, almost translucent, and from what Steve could see he appeared to be having some sort of fit or seizure, with his entire body twitching like he was being electrocuted.
Peter nodded against Papa's chest, swallowing against the knot in his throat. "I know. I think sometimes I just need to hear it."
Anger flashed through Peter like lightning, and he fought against the urge to scowl, very much aware of Gwen's eyes shooting darts of mortification and apology.
He found Dad sitting cross-legged on the floor surrounded by about a hundred different notebooks and papers, which Peter recognised as some of Uncle Bruce's notes on the HYDRA files. DUM-E beeped a soft greeting from his perch over in the corner as Peter approached, a lot more melancholy than his usual.
"I'm so sorry, little guy," Steve murmured as he trailed his fingertips down Peter's round cheek. "I wish I could make all of this go away."
"Hardly," said JARVIS. "Oh, and Captain Rogers reports that he and Mr Thor have retrieved Master Peter and are en route back to the Tower."
Steve pursed his lips, shaking his head. "You're not gonna let this go, are you?"
"Yeah, well, I'm afraid you might've just woken Peter up with that landing," Steve said, trying to reign in his impatience. With their soundproofed bedroom there was a chance that Tony hadn't heard anything, but Steve knew Peter was a lost cause. His enhanced hearing combined with the fact that he never completely closed his bedroom door would no doubt have him running onto the landing pad in five… four… three… two…
“No, it does not!” Peter said.  “It only means that you're completely innocent in this whole mess, and that you're also the only one who can put a stop to it!”
"Yes, it is," said Grandma. "One of the worst things I heard people say about him was that he talked funny. Joseph had this sort of lilt to his speech that I found incredibly romantic, but apparently others said it made him hard to understand." She frowned, shaking her head. "And when I was finally able to work up the courage to explain to my father that I wanted to marry Joseph instead of Matthew, well… let's just say that it didn't go very well."
"You're not in any danger though, are you?" asked Steve. "With your heart? It's not going to… undo itself or something someday, is it?"
"Body heat is a good thing at this point as well, Tony," Bruce said, now assisting Helen as she carefully wrapped Peter's right hand in the splint. "In a few minutes I'll increase the temperature of the water; we don't want to bring their body temps up too quickly or they can go into shock."
"Yeah?" said Steve, sniffing. "I mean, it's just silly, right? I shouldn't be so—"
"JARVIS, is Pete okay?" he said in a shaky voice as he started the car.
In a flash Tony's expression morphed from teasing to absolute seriousness as curled his arms around Steve's waist, dropping his forehead against his collarbone. "God, Steve, I could never wonder about it," he whispered. "Not in a million years."
"Oh, absolutely," agreed Gwen. "In fact, I'm thinking that we need to buy a bunch, just in case everyone else wants to try some."
But Peter's elation was short-lived as he heard Papa let out an agonising groan just before spitting an entire mouthful of blood across the floor. He raced over to him, practically tearing the cowl from his head bearing the hateful HYDRA crest before carefully cradling him in his arms.
"Um… some more coffee would be nice," Tony finally said. He scrubbed his palm down his face, sliding on his glasses. "The headache's starting to come back, so…"
"So, I hate to be that guy," Cam said as he popped the last of his fried potatoes into his mouth. "But given how powerful this tesseract thing really is, are we sure it's safe for us to use? I mean, how can we be sure that it's not gonna explode as soon as Steve deploys it?"
"Yes, all signs are pointing in that direction," Natasha said. "But if the Chitauri were trying to launch an invasion of Earth from this point, why only stop at two attacks? And why attack what amounts to an office building during the night, when there were basically no people inside it?"
But she was cut off by another ear-splitting howl from Thanos, nearly causing Peter to scream right along with him. His senses were already stretched so thin they were nearly at the breaking point, even with his adaptive suit, and he wasn't sure how much longer he'd be able to keep going.
"Ah, it is so good to see you again, Young Starkson!" Thor exclaimed as he set Peter down, ruffling his hair. "Alas, I wish my visit was of a social variety."
"Wakanda?" Wong asked, obviously confused. "What's in Wakanda?"
And, he also knew that there were plenty of Special Forces troops who ran various covert missions through there.  Rhodey had told him as such.
But then Peter came along, and although Tony had been tempted more than a few times over the years, he hadn't touched a drop of the stuff since then.
That still didn't mean that Peter wanted an audience when he was trying on pants, though.
Which makes sense, since it’s at a college and everything.
"I highly doubt it, sir."
You know, the
"To us," Steve said. "To celebrating one of the happiest days of my life, and for the lifetime to come."
"Thanks," said Peter. "Did you get to finish yours yet?"
"Oh, you think so, huh? You only lasted a whole three moves longer."
of the keys on the rather cheap keyboard punching tiny holes in Tony's already fraying nerves.
"Damn," Bucky said with an approving nod. "So… it sounds to me like you just need to apologise to Tony."
"Yep," Tony said firmly. "Let's get this over with."
"All right, honey," he murmured, nodding. "Copy that."
He hadn't wanted to admit it, but that had been the first time he'd been able to picture the three of them together, as a real family.
, the team he had curated and trained with such care and precision that they could now read each other's minds, and discern the tone of each other's voices out there on the battlefield.
He felt Steve smile against the back of his head. "I might've heard that a few times in my life, mo grá."
, 'cause once Pete gets all of his strength back, I swear that boy will be able to out-eat even you. I've never been able to figure out where he puts it all."
at this hotter-than-
"He's already got three of the stones, guys, which makes him the most powerful creature in the universe," Bruce continued. "The Power Stone, the Mind Stone, and the Space Stone. The Space Stone was inside the Tesseract, just like Thor said. And Thanos just crushed it in his hand like it was nothing. Heimdall, Thor's guardian, was able to send me here just before the ship broke apart, but… guys, he's coming. Thanos knows there's another stone here, so he's on his way. And if we don't stop him, then—"
Tony gasped, his blood pressure plummeting so fast that he felt woozy, and he grabbed onto the back of the couch, trying to keep himself upright.
Grandma patted his shoulder. "It's not a problem at all, dear. Now, I think we have about fifteen minutes before we're due to begin. Do you still have your papa's ring?"
Peter sucked in a shuddering breath, eyeing Tony through his soaking wet eyelashes.
"You know I'm not really supposed to be telling you this stuff though, right?" Tony added. "So I'd kinda appreciate it if you'd keep it a secret until Colonel Phillips makes the announcement."
There simply was no other explanation. No other way Steve could explain the appearance of the portals, or the anticipation this universe's Steve and Tony had felt while waiting for Peter to arrive.
Well, Tony wasn't wrong. "Okay," Steve said slowly. "Go on."
Peter sniggered as he shook his head. "No, the book doesn't say. It does say that the so-called 'treatment' was never very successful though."
"Oh my God!" Peter squeaked, pressing his palm to his chest. "I was dead!"
Unfortunately, Anthony was now seven minutes late to begin Steve and Bucky's session.
"Okay, but none of this explains why these people keep coming after Peter!" Steve said, his voice cracking on their son's name. "What do all these people want with him, he's just a boy!"
"The lab has never been properly decommissioned, Master Peter, so I would assume that it is still functional," JARVIS answered. "However, it has not been used since Ms Potts took over as CEO."
Dad's nostrils flared as he huffed out a sharp breath. "Well, since he doesn't see fit to actually tell us how we win, we've got no goddamn way of knowing that, right? But anything's gotta be better than just sitting here on our asses! My husband—!"
Tony gulped, the intensity in Steve's blue eyes so profound that he almost couldn't look at him. No one had ever looked at Tony like that before, like he'd literally hung the moon, and it was more than a little frightening.
"I'm eating right now, sweetheart."
Goddamnit, honey, I promise I'm ready!"
Steve, and I wanna know why!"
He was cut off as the fireball suddenly appeared directly above them, smashing straight into the main SHIELD building about fifty metres away. The blastwave was enough to knock Peter and Gwen off their feet, sending them both flying across the roof. Gwen screamed as Peter landed on the very edge of the roof, clutching Gwen's hand so hard he feared he might break it.
"Yep," answered Tony as he stole a small piece of the croissant, winking as he popped it into his mouth. "Bruce and Sam said they'll have the panic room prepped and ready by Saturday morning, so…"
"I've even personally witnessed it," added Ned. "One time when I was staying overnight I spilled pop all the way down my shirt, and Captain Rogers offered to wash it for me. And he didn't even shrink it or anything."
Tony thought as he breathed in, trying to contain his patience. "Yeah, okay, but we're not in an episode of Star Trek, Pete. This is actually happening, so I really don't think that—"
Dad grumbled, his helmet closing over his face with a
Colonel Phillips had personally promised Steve numerous times that both Tony and Peter would be kept as safe as possible during the Phoenix mission, but Steve was still worried for them. He was supposed to be their protector, but how in the hell could he possibly do that while he was millions of kilometres away in space?
Peter swung his backpack onto his shoulder and stepped back, allowing Gwen to step in front of him. "After you."
"It's okay," Peter said in a small voice. He flopped down into the squashy armchair opposite the couch. "I take it there hasn't been any good news?"
"I know Wanda didn't mean to make us see what we saw in that HYDRA bunker," he began. "And I know she still feels bad about it, but… they—they still—I mean, I still—I just wish that I could unsee them, you know? 'Cause—'cause, and now with Gwen wanting to go away to England, I just—I can't not see her falling, and I keep thinking, how am I supposed to protect her if she's all the way over there? I mean, not even our Quinjet can get to England that fast, so…"
"Long story short, I didn't tell Tony that I already knew his son because I was afraid he'd be upset that I could go and visit him when he couldn't," Steve said. "I was gonna tell him tonight, actually, but—but he figured it out this morning… while I was out running, and—"
"Ah, he's always been like that," said Uncle Bucky. "Стиви has one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen in a person. He was always looking to help people, even when he and his ma barely had a roof over their heads or food on the table. But he always hated being so small and sickly. He would pick fights with guys that were twice or even three times his size, but then he always hated when I'd jump in to make sure that he didn't get killed. Even if he never said anything, I knew he hated it. It helped a bit after he got the serum, but he still never liked showing any pain or anything he might consider a weakness, especially around the rest of the Commandos."
And every single one of those discussions had come to the same conclusion: going back to reverse the snap by essentially preventing the snap from occurring was the only way to prevent the absolute pandemonium that had ensued as a result of it. Steve had explained how difficult those early days were to Tony during his convalescence after breaking his hands, telling him it was even more difficult to coordinate than the bombing of London had been during the war. The near-collapse of many of the world's governments, the halting of trade routes for food and other essential supplies, and the crashing of airplanes, trains, and cars as their pilots and drivers disappeared, leading to even more deaths.
"It does!" Dad shot back. "But you really think Thanos gives a shit about universal rules?"
"Yeah, you just might've," Steve said with a grin. "You guys hungry?"
Drawing in a deep breath, Tony activated the 'Record' function in his HUD.
"And then Thursday night I'm gonna be going with Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky to the Mets game, so Dad will be picking you up from school after Robotics Lab, okay?"
And he, Steve, and Peter were all right there, smack dab in the middle of all of it. Designing aircraft capable of transporting hundreds of people at a time, reinvigorating the entire planetary economy with the creation of tens of thousands of different types of jobs, and establishing things like labour laws and employee safety practises that would ensure plenty of time for the working people to actually enjoy some of their new amenities.
Ned exclaimed, so loudly that at least a half a dozen students sitting at a nearby table stopped talking to look in their direction. "You get to go to
Steve needs to be completely focused on his task at hand, which means he cannot become distracted with thoughts about how badly the man he thought he was in love with managed to screw him over.
Not that Tony had a clue what in the hell they'd actually
"One of the reasons," answered Steve. He kissed his way over to Tony's temple, breathing in his incredible scent. "Just one of the millions,
"Tony, it's almost three in the morning," Steve said. "It can wait until after we bring Peter to school."
"Nothing," Steve said quickly, reaching for Tony's elbows. He pressed a soft kiss to Tony's forehead, relieved when Tony's hands came to rest in their usual spot on his biceps. Now obviously wasn't the time for Steve to mention all of the research he'd been doing on the possible lung capacity and immune system problems having a big piece of hardware embedded into one's sternum could cause.
Peter shivered at the awful thought, prompting Dad to glance his way as they exited the elevator.
"It's not too far, little guy, okay?" Steve murmured, kissing the top of Peter's head. "We'll get you set up in no time and then you can go to sleep."
"Uh huh. Loads," Peter whispered as he raised his head, sniffing. "Dad, I'm—I'm sorry. About… well… all of it. I—I was just trying to—I didn't mean to cause any extra trouble, and now—"
One enemy was apparently all they could handle at the moment. And then only barely.
"Never again sounds fine to me, mo grá," Steve replied. He twisted around so he was facing Tony, smiling widely as he drew Tony close. "I am so proud of how you handled that, though. That could've gone down pretty ugly, but you handled it with a lot of grace."
"No magic," Steve said as Tony took another bite. "It's my ma's recipe, passed down from her ma."
"I would concur, Your Highness, based on what we saw in New York," added Steve. "I think we're gonna be in for quite a fight."
With a weird
"On my signal, okay?" Steve added. "And Nat—"
"Yeah, well, you stay close to me, understand?" Dad said. "I wanna be able to see you at all times, no matter what else is going on."
