It was impossible for John- a man whom Sherlock found himself caring for deeply and devoutly after an incredibly short time together- to truly regard Sherlock so highly. Yet he saw himself mirrored within John. He saw disdain for the words falling from his mouth, saw the way he struggled with what he wanted to say, saw that he was hiding something. Therefore, what remained was, although infinitely improbable, that John Watson, like himself, could only speak in lies.
The bed, the closet, nor the walking patterns interested Sherlock quite as much as the floorboard, however. He knew this floorboard- had utilized this floorboard. This particular floorboard lifted to reveal a convenient pocket of space that could be used to store items one might want to hide.
He’d solved international terrorist attacks more quickly. What made these murders special? Yes, surely tomorrow was the day. He would pry information out of anyone he needed to, go anywhere he needed, examine every centimetre of the village until it yielded its secrets. It seemed too daunting to think of himself remaining clueless in 24 hours’ time. He would solve it early and be back in London by Friday, in the comfort of his home with all those heavenly vices that his skin crawled for. His veins were screaming, crying out for the relief of his stash, of blissful quietude as it wrapped around his racing mind and- for just a moment- made it all stop.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at the man. He was clearly upset that Sherlock was refusing. But why? He knew why Lestrade was upset about his personal life- could read it in his shaving pattern and the state of his cufflinks. But why would he be upset about his refusal to join him in a drink? It had never bothered him before.
Lestrade’s smile evaporated, a look of concern glistening in his eyes under furrowed eyebrows. “Bloody hell…” he trailed off. He clearly had never considered Sherlock as a man who would have cried in his life.
It was a cold, dreary day when Sherlock awoke, determined to survive one day of his life without being ridiculed. Today, he vowed to himself, he would go the whole day without speaking. He would not answer the teacher’s questions no matter how easy they were, he would not make observations about his classmates, he would not attempt to engage in “small talk,” he wouldn’t even greet those around him with a cheery “good morning” in a futile attempt to obtain their good graces.
“Can I go now?” John spat, furious at the degrading nature of his position.
“I didn’t

Falling in love with John Watson was revealing the colours within him one by one.
On cue, the man accompanying him fished his phone out of his own trouser pocket and offered, “Here, use mine.”
“Let’s just say this guy isn’t any big barrel of laughs.”
And this, so close to it. He felt as though he was shaking its hand through a thin, weightless glove.
The lie was alarmingly convincing and John wondered if-
“The bassist who passed me on his way out to the lobby and asked for the fastest way to the bar?”
It was always the silence that broke Sherlock most. In John’s silence, there was the incessant, foolish hope. In the silence, he could imagine he felt John’s body fight itself from entering an embrace that would knock down the wall between them once and for all. In the silence, the world would move in slow motion as John’s eyes flicked to his lips and, in that sole moment, in the silence, there was yearning for his touch more than he could bear it.
John looked again to Sherlock, certain he was missing something. If this man wasn't high-
It was the longest of shots, finding Philip at The Tobago after all this time, but John's mind was full of imagined reunions as he traversed the darkened streets of Cardiff toward the familiar club.
“Because
Stupid question. He knew precisely where he made the unforgivable turn down this doomed path he was on. He faked his death and allowed John to believe the lie. He threw a live grenade into their relationship and was surprised to find the remains of the explosion. Every moment since was a more painful step down this path of thorns. And this- this moment of blissful dreaming, this moment of lost consciousness, this brushing alongside the veil of life and death- was the end of the road.
John said nothing, just stared across the miles between them and processed the words. His eyes, animated, reacted precisely as Sherlock predicted. First, going wide with shock, then narrowing suspiciously, the irises darting wildly around the pair of them. It was as though he was attempting to spot the source of the words- as though he would be able to find a criminal with a gun in-hand who was forcing Sherlock to say the words.

“You’re sleeping well.”
. It was like being in on the joke instead of being the butt of it.
Understanding, yes, but never love.
Sherlock turned a corner abruptly and he couldn't help but notice the grace with which he moved, even in the smallest motions. He was the epicentre of motion and the world conformed around him.
Recalling Victor was as painful now as it had been the night he died. John lost many friends in that war and but Victor was no friend. He had been his best friend- his brother. Through it all- the endless days in battle, the painful treks through the tropics, the neverending heat- Victor had been a beacon toward life and perseverance. When he died, John had no hope to hold onto and only survived the remainder of the conflict because he’d made a vow to Victor that he would deliver his letter to Sherlock, who John had incorrectly assumed was his wife.
A lock undone.
“This is Andre Baruch for The American Songbook of Popular Music, brought to you by Bayer Aspirin. We’re are looking for a great swing band to write their very own song in honour of our boys in uniform.” John, whose ears hadn’t been particularly focused on hearing the words, suddenly perked up. It was the strangest of sensations, this total stillness as he intensely focused on each word floating to him from his radio. “Yes, it’s The British Songbook’s ‘Tribute to the Troops.’ One band from each county in Britain will compete in a preliminary round on December 16th. Each winning band from each county will then compete in a nationwide broadcast, live from London on March 22nd to determine who will appear in a spectacular new motion picture musical, and be immortalized in film history.”
“I told you, my love,” he whispered with closed eyes, “that I want to. Remember, I asked you.”
” -Benjamin Disraeli
John was struck into silence by the scene before him. A mass of black curls bounced gently around the man's pale face as his head turned to the waitress, telling her dismissively that he would have the scampi di gamberi for their starter.
It happened so suddenly, he couldn’t say how he was suddenly stumbling forward. One moment, he had been leaning forward, and the next it seemed Sherlock had simply vanished from the air before him. John’s eyes snapped open, placing one foot ahead of him to prevent himself from falling over. His neck still burned with the contact where Sherlock’s hand had been upon it.
like mistletoe.”
“You leaned into my hand.” Sherlock smiled to the ceiling, pleased with his past-self. “You tilted your head into my hand and your eyes fluttered closed as you did so. I rubbed my thumb along your cheekbone, a motion I had dreamed of for so many years.”
He could taste his own tears upon Sherlock’s now, though perhaps he was tasting Sherlock’s. He was aware of a tremor that passed through him and wondered distantly if it was a tremor of pleasure or if he was perhaps crying. John was, he knew it. This moment was so perfect, tears fell slowly out of his closed eyes as Sherlock enveloped every part of him.
things, even if I don’t know how I know. Your posture is that of a soldier. You never see a civilian walk like you do even if you do see soldiers walk like civilians.”
Lestrade heaved a sigh before rolling his eyes and saying in a diplomatic tone, “Look, I'm not judging you, alright? I just thought with- you know… your serious attitude and your... whole 'thing’... The drink choice is just a bit of a surprise. But it’s fine. Really.”
I can't find anything. SH
“Wait- what? Why is he singing?” asked Philip with a deserved reservation.
“When you perform in London, you will be competing again the winners from the fifty other countries in the UK,” continued Alex. “We can’t tell you much about your competition, though. Many of them haven’t competed, though a great number are holding their preliminary round today.”
“Sherlock?” he tried again, placing a tentative hand on the curved shoulder.
As John slept, his stomach rising and falling in perfect rhythm, Sherlock watched intently. Minutes fell away into hours as Sherlock took in every perfect detail of their arrangement and committed it to memory.
“I had a few drinks before this one here,” she giggled, drink rattling in her gesturing hand. “And going by the smell of your breath, so have you.”
His hand swept the table again, a light shrug accompanying it. “The visual evidence exists to see, but few can observe.”
“Sherlock!” a voice called behind him. His heart gave one firm thump in his chest, his eyes widening because he knew the voice before he turned around.
“You mean when you get home?”
me: spells it "Phillip"
Sherlock seemed to consider this for a long moment. Finally, after considering, he said: “Then you will not need to go out with me again.”
Their evenings together were nothing short of domestic perfection since they'd grown used to one another's routines and behaviours. John, so frequently prone to outbursts of anger, seemed generally calmer in these hours. In the dim twilight's illumination, his muscles would relax, his guard fall down. These were the moments of innocent touches- brushings of his hand along a small expanse of Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he slipped behind him in the kitchen or gentle brushes of their knees as they sat in silence together on the couch. These touches were electricity in his heart, fire in his blood. It took nearly everything in him not to tense up at the contact, though he couldn’t always help it. He gazed on John as though he were the sun- which, of course, Sherlock thought he was.
“You got it,” John said instantly, thinking of Tobias’ similar condition. “No Tuesdays. What else?”
“I don’t believe you.”
When Sholto came to inform him that there were five minutes until curtain, John removed his hand and allowed the curtain to close, his mind refocusing on the task at hand.
The night Sherlock had just endured had been a proper disaster. He’d been overjoyed when John’s eyes had done exactly what he’d anticipated: slid over Sherlock initially before recognition passed over his face. Everything after…
“No, of course not. I told them they were for me.” This wasn't
And yet every day was better. It was never easy, but it got easier. It was months of work, months of communication, months of dredging up their mutual pain. Forgiveness rang through their bones as they cleansed themselves of the regret that flowed through their blood. Sherlock fixed himself, John put himself back together, and they both built themselves to be better men through the combined effort.
The man sized him up, scanning him from hair to shoes with sceptical eyes that felt an awful lot like standing naked in a crowded room.
Lots of anger.
Nevertheless, it didn’t matter. His plans for entering this room had come to fruition.
The Mind Palace, in theory, was a memory recollection system. In practice, however, it was capable of so much more.
run.”
“I can see it all: the swanky leather seats, the fine cuisine, an attendant offering every accommodation that could be expected by someone like us- someone in the movies. The conductor will call us aboard and take our bags. He’ll say: ‘Right this way, gentlemen. Let me take those bags, you’ve been carrying them far too long. We can’t wait to hear your song.”
Despite knowing she wasn’t coming, John foolishly allowed himself to remain planted in that seat, allowed his eyes to dance around the room, scanning every face for her face. Pride wouldn’t let him foolishly stand and walk out, allowing everybody in the room to confirm what they already suspected. Pride also wouldn’t allow him to sit here and allow those around him to pity him. Especially the waitress, so smug in her- correct- assumption: John Watson had been stood up.
I love me a First Meeting AU. I hope you all enjoyed.
Greg sighed and rolled his eyes but remained jovially energetic. “Fine. I know a guy. Trumpet player.”
It is the 30th of January 2020 and John has three hopes:
He placed the rest of the letters several feet from where he had settled himself on the mattress. Gingerly, he took the letter he was convinced would hold precious confessions from the rest and stared at its unassuming envelope. Taking several deep breaths, his hands worked slowly to peel open the envelope and extract several pages of paper.
“If I left it- all of it- behind…” John said softly, the breath of the words flooding Sherlock’s mouth.
A pleasant surprise passed over John's face even as he shook his head in refusal. “I couldn't. It's your thing.”
The bristles shone until they blinded him. Without his conductor of light, their illumination was unbearable. He begged this was it, the final barrier between his high and death.
Victor had smiled a mischievous grin and John had wondered why he looked like he had a secret. “I’ve got a special someone, yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Slight warning for descriptions of blood and injuries.
“Why?”
Sherlock Holmes was 15 when he caught the eye of a rather handsome boy. Zane Hope was only particularly extraordinary in two ways: he was Sherlock’s first crush and, more importantly, he was kind to him.
“You recall, then, that you’ve made similar confessions before.” His eyes were cast down, his tone cold and distant.
So Lestrade changed the subject to one that Sherlock couldn’t pay attention to. Try as he might, Lestrade’s words were floating around his mind with none of them registering. He politely threw “Mhm”s and “Mm-mm”s whenever Lestrade stopped for breath. Because of his focus on maintaining eye contact, the man seemed to have no idea that Sherlock was not processing or understanding a single word he spoke.
“I- Thank- Thank you,” stammered Sherlock between smiling teeth and suddenly, Greg wasn’t the only one embracing. Philip’s bubbling laughter came out purely happy, his arm extending around Sherlock’s shoulders for but a moment.
Sherlock’s eyes searched John's, and his tongue seemed to fail him as he opened his mouth to respond but closed it silently, nodding his head curtly. They remained like that for a long minute and John would have happily remained drowning in those eyes for eternity.
He stayed an outsider of the experience while enjoying Sholto’s rigid perfection, Tobias’ dark sense of humour, Philip’s frequent eye rolls, Wiggins’ mindless perfection, John’s impatient corrections, and Greg ’s snarky jabs when John corrected anyone other than himself.
For a long moment, Sherlock stared at the small bundle of fabric in his hands. The socks were ordained with smiling penguins, one tobogganing happily across a frozen lake. “And you,” Sherlock said softly, “think these are cute?”
It couldn’t be.
Greg wore a casual smile, approaching Sherlock with an easy grace and a halo of chocolate hair. He was indubitably handsome. He carried his bass without a case as though it were an extension of his hand and not a twelve kilogram hunk of wood.
Sherlock ordered the pair of them some drinks and invited John to take a seat with him at an isolated table that was a decent distance from the performers. From here, the music was still loud but the two could comfortably speak in raised voices without their words getting lost.
The stranger dragged his fingernails painstakingly along the filthy countertop, clumps of dried alcohol gathering beneath his already filthy, chipped fingernails. “They needed- They wanted a way to make it… stop.”
Sherlock considered this, his eyes glazing over with thought. John couldn't recall exactly when Sherlock had acquired each wrinkle on his still-perfect face. His eyes were decorated with a painting of them, his mouth surrounded by smile lines so indented, it hurt to observe.
But the more people disliked him for being so brilliant, the more he needed to control their dislike. He tried holding it in, but it oozed from him without control. He couldn’t stop it- the deductions. They were part of him, arriving to betray him because he sincerely couldn’t tell what was common sense and what was a “deduction.”
Then he was gone, heading toward the staging area where his saxophone awaited his preparation.
OR on Dreamwidth:
He’d ask someone how their sleepover was and they would get angry because suddenly their girlfriend was screaming questions at them. He would make small talk and inquire about a woman’s recent engagement but she would burst into tears, calling him a jerk.
He was correct. The whole body beneath him was shifting with desire. When his tongue dragged slowly along the head for good effect, Sherlock’s legs tensed and he whimpered-
He fixed the man with disbelieving eyes and then went to work on cleaning the wound. “You mean to tell me that you
John couldn’t rake the music quickly enough, heat rising in him from a cocktail of excitement and precaution. The words sunk in as he scanned them, the ghost of a melody in his head as he read through Sherlock’s scrappy sheet music.
“Yeah, and Bougainville.”
Sherlock flushed, a nightmare come to life as Philip exposed him for the fraud he was.
“Obviously,” said Sherlock in a tone that suggested the question had been an unimportant one. “Tea?”
“Now imagine I noted your band mate’s sexuality in front of him,” Sherlock continued. “Even though it’s obvious to me- even though the evidence is there for
The question stunned him. Hesitating, he began, “well- I- I’d begin by picking up what I could manage.”
Otherwise...
“It is nearly winter, my love. Eighteen days until Christmas.”
Their fingers brushed, setting every single nerve in his body on edge. His mind was clouded with desire, hope was overriding every attempt to know if it was John or himself who was leading the entwining of their hands, gentle explorers on the skin of the other.
He couldn’t say for certain when he’d begun appreciating how precious his own life was. It was certainly after and related to the entrance of John Watson. He woke every day and did not struggle to find joy; it was beside him in his own home.
“Yeah,” Philip chuckled with excitement in his eyes. “That means he’s in.”
It was hauling through the airless vacuum of space. It was treading from the deepest depth of an unexplored ocean. It was strength he never knew he had- the strength John Watson inspired in him. Sherlock needed to move, his mind clicking into activity, changing gears to embrace reality when he’d fought against it for so long.
“Oh dear,” she fussed. “I can’t bear to see you like that!”
“You want to start a band,” said Sholto, finally. He didn’t beat around the bush and John could only give a sly smile.
Sherlock’s tongue grazed along the outside of his lower lip and the resulting summersaults performed by his insides were pleasurable in their intensity. No one else, his whole life, had ever caused such a reaction from any level of physical intimacy. Here- with this perfect man- everything was heightened. The sensation of the lightest tongue flick awoke every nerve in his body.
The most amazing night of John’s life was abruptly ended when the door opened aggressively, Sherlock’s sentence cut short as the two turned their heads in unison to a mousy young woman standing in the doorframe, one hand on the doorknob as her eyes darted quickly between the two of them.
The pair of them stared at him before turning one another, the woman looking affronted and the man rushing to make himself busy.
Deep sigh. I didn't mean to write light angst. It just sort of... happened. Regular readers know that I love (
John was smiling despite himself, his eyes narrowed and head shaking. It was a smile more beautiful than any sunrise, and smile that corrected all wrongs in the world in a flash. “Alright,” he said slowly. “What’s going on, then?”
Greg started, uncertain whether or not Sherlock was being serious.
” John proclaimed when a wave of frigid water crashed over him, unexpected droplets falling down his face and neck, seeping into the fabric of his shirt and stunning his body and mind away from the nightmare kiss.
Hush.
“No!” he said, his tone harsh and far too loud and oh God, was the room trembling? “No, it’s f-fine. Really.” His words were thin and insincere in his own ears.

Lestrade let out a bark of laughter that shook his belly. “For a man so clever, you are so bloody dense.” When Sherlock continued to silently glare at him, he shook his head and, exasperated, he said, “

“Jealousy really isn’t a good colour on you,” said Sherlock, placing his microphone back into its stand.
The music swelled around him and his panic rose viciously, the first bar passing him in the blink of an eye. His microphone was distant from him, all reasoning for agreeing to this fleeing him in one swell swoop. He couldn’t have chosen a worse way to “put himself out there.” He didn’t belong here.
The announcement visibly surprised Sherlock, though his tone was even as he said, “Me too, actually.”
“It was nothing,” he said hastily, shaking his head in non-verbal refusal.
The clasps of his case snapped shut and he heard a low, reverberating voice behind him:
Never in his life had John known such shame. It filled him within an inch of overflowing, the surface tension stretched thin on the horrible sensation. It churned in him at a nauseating tempo.
“Sherlock?”
“You know… In a way, that would have been better.”
“I quite like the sound of that,” he said quietly into their shared space, the two falling back into a comfortable silence.
“Yeah.”
As if the brilliant purple fabric wasn’t completely torn apart from his

! This was so meant to be, you have to sing with us!”
And that is how they came to this situation: John’s right hand shaking with a brush as he beheld the scarred back of his friend turned lover. John meant it when he claimed this man a work of art. After asking- begging- to see the scars, Sherlock had permitted it. John had traced the scars and fought back tears before asking Sherlock if he could paint him. Now, every curve, every dip, every centimetre of perfection combined to make what was surely more art than human. He was petrified by the actions taken against Sherlock to cause these scars, but they weren’t ugly. They were a part of him, a portion of his existence, and physical proof of his resilience in life.
Sherlock closed his eyes, the sensation burning from tears that had thankfully subsided for the time being. He knew they were likely to return, and he vowed to keep this paper, this letter, pristine.
“Oh absolutely. Life was rough before him… No offense but the rest of you were just awful. But life is… good now.” Sherlock’s heart beat harder, the image of John floating in his mind.
.” He whispered the words, brain racing to beat itself in a race to reach a conclusion that he couldn’t see yet. "Again," he ordered.
The two-syllable syllable word was a wall of grief in his throat, the despair and desperation ringing through the air. It was as much a scream as a question, a cry that would never receive an answering response.
Their eyes scanned one another, confident in their knowledge that this was it. Their lives had been torn apart, each of them broken in every imaginable way. Now, together, was the beginning of the rest of their lives. They would rebuild the shambles of it all as an unbreakable unit. Their love would work, slowly, to pick up the disaster that lay around them.
“No,” responded Sherlock in a barely audible breath.
Perhaps John saw it as Sherlock leaving him, but Sherlock had never been without John for even a moment. His whole existence since the first moment they were brought together was centered around John.
“Thank you. Thank you.” He was moving away and could no longer see her or the building or the street or anything in this world. All that existed was this endless dark tunnel and him, clawing his way out. His feet carried him down the street and he crouched down on the pavement when his feet were unable to carry him any longer.
“Blimey,” laughed Greg. “A joke! Didn’t think you had it in you.”
“Well, bit different from my day.”
Sherlock sat within eyesight, unconcerned with hearing any of her banter. When John had asked whether or not they would sit closer, Sherlock had explained confidently that nothing she would share with these strangers would be of importance. Rather, they were better off observing and following in search of a lead.

“I promise.”
“Fine,” huffed Sherlock, rolling his eyes. “Three, yes?”
“I suppose it’s just… the most likely explanation,” he stated with the inflexion of a question. “They’re clothes for boys. Probably not your dad because of the style of them- only a few years old- and it probably isn’t very likely that he would have kept clothes for so long. It could have been a friend, I guess, but still… brother is more likely.”
.” When Sherlock’s expression didn’t change, John’s resolve steeled and he pulled the tray toward him. “I can handle my alcohol just fine, thank you.”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated but never required. Be well, all.
John was pleasantly surprised how quickly the time had passed. A surreal feeling of peace washed over him in gently cresting waves as scratching pencils sounded against the otherwise silent room. Every person in there was quiet, focused, and lost in their own worlds. The comprehensive retraction into his own mind was what made the alarm for their portraits so terrifying. The silent, peaceful concentration was ripped apart violently by the aggressive beeping that signified the end of the class. It is only then, as the class moved to put their supplies away and the model replaced his robe, that John felt the too-familiar return of blood in his cheeks. He knew it was ridiculous to suspect, but he had the strangest feeling that the model

slightly. “We don’t need to talk about him-”
With his arm was extended, the letter remained safe- dry and pristine. His tears came unabashedly in this isolated room, his face absolutely drowning in the volume of them. His vision was blurred, his air flow constricted, his voice emitted a pained growl that he had no control over. There was nothing he could do but allow it all. He was helpless to even attempt a facade of control. It took everything- strength, control, effort, focus… It took
I love them. All of them.
Why his vindication in this belief was so strong could not be explained. It was akin to grabbing wind, this inscrutable certainty that something about this stout, blond man was as revolutionary as if the sun had begun revolving around the moon. He was something more than a retired Army Captain, more than an insomniac, more than a man suffering from an eating disorder, more than an isolated introvert. No, he was much more- somehow.
Yet every time he saw a black curl, vibrant eyes, or a tall, lean figure, his heart would jump out of his ribcage until he realized with falling hope that, no, it wasn’t him.
“Absolutely.” He finished the rest of the eggnog in his cup for courage. “You better watch out, women everywhere will be falling over themselves if they see you in such a handsome jumper.”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip, eyes downcast toward his fidgeting fingers. “I don’t always know what isn’t obvious. For example, imagine you met a man with a wedding ring. Imagine as you’re chatting, you ask him how long he’s been married. Then, imagine he becomes outraged, demanding to know how you knew he was married. You would try to tell him that it was obvious because he was wearing a ring. But imagine he was still angry at you for it.”
“Oh dear, I’m afraid he’s not here at the moment,” she said with her voice brimming with regret as though she hadn’t just set fire to John’s world with the smallest of strikes.
He flinched away from the touch, a bolt of hurt striking John’s insides.

What had he done?
The order was so commanding, John, the Captain in the Royal Army, fell silent instantly. He narrowed his eyes, eyebrows fully pulled together in confusion as he tried to piece together what was happening.
An echo of Mycroft's words echoed meaninglessly in his mind: "

A lazy hum escaped from between closed lips as John snuggled closer to Sherlock’s bare chest. Every precaution screaming at him to stop, Sherlock moved with excessive caution to wrap his arms around the back of the man he loved. When the initial results proved promising, he wrapped himself more tightly around John, pulling him closer until Sherlock imagined he could feel John’s heart beat against his skin.
Thank you.

When the words came, they tumbled out like a river crashing over a waterfall. They were rapid and slurred and his eyes were deliberately anywhere but on Sherlock. “I don’t think I like girls.”
Sherlock is only twenty-four years old when Victor suddenly exits.
“I have a question now,” declared Sherlock after several songs spent in silence between them. The assertion surprised John, his eyes flying painfully wide from initial surprise.
Sherlock smiled wide, a knowing glint in his eye. “You hate it.”
His hands steepled under his chin, his familiar cool eyes scanning easily over his companion before saying, “Fate is a fool's hope of ridding oneself of control. It is the illusion of deflecting responsibility for action. It does not exist. How, then, can we explain the fashion in which we met and our subsequent bond?”
Greg was a blur of motion on his bass, his tempo immaculate as his dark beat stirred the rich undertones of their music.
John raised his hands to run through curls crafted by God. His fingers wound around and through the mess of hair that he’d spent years wanting to pull-

Sherlock Holmes was not heartless or incapable of love; he was merely painted that way. It was his greatest secret. With careful strokes of a harsh brush, he covered himself in the illusion of distance and watched with satisfaction as everyone around him believed it. Love, he knew, was a dangerous disadvantage. He’d learned from a young age that to love is to hurt and to hurt is unbearable.
“Aye, Aye,” offered Wiggins, his stare directed to an unknown object. “Me too.”
John’s fingernails were hurting his palms from prolonged digging. “My point?” He suppressed the urge to scream into his hands. He was so tired of this dance. So incredibly tired. “My

John cleared his throat, his feet shuffling beneath him. “I could… fix it,” he offered casually, as though he were commenting on the weather.
Sherlock lifted a lazy finger to point at beautiful woman sipping on a bloody mary behind John in a booth seven seats down from them. Her long, brunette hair was pulled into a elegant updo that didn’t suit the atmosphere of the grungy pub. John gawked at her, wondering if Sherlock was making a joke.

In this way, he learned that he could at least manoeuvre as close as possible to what the truth. If his mother cooked a warm, perfect meal and asked him how he liked it, he could instead say, “I prefer your potatoes,” and bring her slightly less sorrow. Although, in truth, she stopped asking him that question many moons ago.

John’s train of thought was aggressively pushed off its tracks when a figure walked through the door of the pub.

It is, in fact, the classification Steve Rogers gets at the beginning of Captain America. I'm claiming artistic liberty, I suppose.
It felt a fiery betrayal.
Seeing a sudden moisture in his eyes was all it took to provide John with enough courage. Lifting himself up a bit, he raised his tear-soaked face to Sherlock’s own and brought his lips up to the tense cupid’s bow that entranced him until they were separated by only the distance of a hair. He didn’t move, didn’t force the connection. He waited only a moment to see if Sherlock would oblige and then-
The laughter was gone from Jackson’s face, but his eyes were hard against John’s pleas. “That’s a bit dramatic, don’t you think? I’ve given you my answer. But you can try out for the community theatre guild- they’re down the block.”
said the voice in his head. It was quite right, of course. His tolerance of alcohol was already minuscule and the effect of it was made worse by the lack of food in his system.
“I-” John was suddenly speechless. He’d simply assumed knocking would be the hardest part. This continued necessity of courage was drawing him from sanity. “I was wondering- is Sherlock Holmes here?”
“Sherlock and Mycroft… Jesus.”
Established Johnlock! My favourite.
,” he said the word with a heavy meaning, “will have the arrosto di maiale. Also, a bottle of your Caprili Brunello di Montalcino Riserva.” He swept the menus from the table gracefully and put them in the hands of the waitress, already looking away from her before the menus were even out of his hands.
“I- no- That’s not-” Sherlock scoffed incredulously but his hands tightened in on themselves and John’s jaw dropped. As he stared, the next band started playing following Al’s introduction and John felt a cruel satisfaction that their band was so much better-
But suddenly, the years spent in silence didn’t seem to matter. Because John was holding Sherlock close, the two were sharing an intimacy John had only ever dreamed of, and they’d gotten here in the end.
For John. SH
As always, find me on Tumblr:
John blinked, attempting to recall any wrongdoing on his part. “What? Why?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes in response. “No, not like that.”
Wasn’t alcohol supposed to be liquid courage? He needed it to be.
“A drinking game.”
Removing it would seal his fate for the evening. He would have to go home and give up. Getting rid of it seemed to be admitting failure, which took a strength he didn’t know if he possessed.
He drank until the nearly-new bottle was empty. As the hours slipped away from him, so did the terrible recollection of his past.
Sherlock had flinched from him.
He gestured to a woman decorated from head to toe in decadent apparel. Brilliant pearls shone on her chest and wrists, her heels perfectly pointed, her dress a royal blue to compliment her chocolate brown hair.
“Because,” he interrupted again, speaking so every work out of his mouth was clipped, “I work alone.”
Ah, this bullshit.
It turned out they were, in fact, only one second. Passing by one another for one split second. The two had just one second together and the million more miles before him seemed impossible to traverse alone.
Because, of course, if Sherlock
John was hastily rising, watching a blur of blonde hair make its way to the door. “I’m certain your mind could sufficiently solve this case.”
John exhaled, ready to fight this battle. “I have a present for you.”
The edges of the world were blurred, panic mixing with anger inside him to cause an eruption of the worst of him. It was the fog of war all over again and, like clockwork, he heard
Greg believes it's because John is embarrassed to have been stood up but we know the truth, don't we? ;)
“As I live and breath,” she said, shamelessly abandoning her flirting adventures with the other nondescript man who turned away dismayed. Poor bloke. Instead, her whole body was directed toward John, a bright and wide smile threatening to blind him. “I can’t believe you’re here. It’s been ages.”
Slowly, millimetres taken at a crawl, he felt his body lean closer to his best friend in response to Victor’s own increasing closeness. The two were shaking, either from anticipation, fear, or any other emotion running rampant within them, and for the smallest of moments, before their mouths found one another, their eyes were wide open and observing the universe in each other’s souls. When their lips touched with the lightest of brushes, their lids fell closed and Sherlock’s entire stomach clenched into a tight ball that dropped straight out of his body. His mind went completely silent, wholly consumed by thoughts of Victor.

His curiosity was sufficiently piqued. “Go on.”
It wasn’t that Philip Anderson hated  Sherlock Holmes. It was that
He shook his head in agreeance but said nothing.
A trace of a smile re-appeared on the devilishly handsome man, his eyes gleaming with understanding. “Are you asking me to join you for a drink?”
“Look, this is it, gentlemen,” John inserted. “This is all we have. I've written
Why was he rambling? Did this total stranger need a rundown of his life? He clasped his mouth shut, eager to prevent the rest of the words trying to flow out of his unwilling lips.
“Why-”
He shrugged, forcing his eyes to the old, forest green curtain several feet to the left of John. “I had nothing going on so…”
She walked up to him, arm outstretched holding the paper out for him to take. John gripped it, eyes narrowing to figure exactly what he was looking at. Five young men, standing stylishly together. The third to the right and standing toward the front was- Good God, it was Sherlock. He was standing with a guitar over his shoulder. He was leather-clad, effortlessly cool.“Feast your eyes on who you’ve just made a date with: Sherlock Holmes, guitarist of Midnight Focus.”
Sherlock’s eyes darted to and from John, his discomfort clear. “John,” he said slowly, leaning back slightly- no, leaning
Sherlock stood upright quite suddenly, his jaw set in determination as he put the socks in their basket of goodies
“And he’s good?”
Their shared life experience was nothing. John had been so desperate, so instantly smitten… so foolish.

Not to be indelicate, but he was
Good LORD, I cried buckets and buckets while writing this. I know not everyone finds this sort of stuff sad but I was
“I bargained with the the forces that be: If I could only have you in my life- as a best mate, as a business partner, in any capacity- then I could be happy. If I could find another lover outside of Mary, I could fill the voids within myself after I lost you. I fell into depression when I realized you were out of my reach and no one could fill that void.”
Shout out to SoSoHolmesWatson for being wonderfully supportive and for also correctly guessing that my continued use of "97" was, indeed, a countdown to the big reveal. I'm sorry if everyone was expecting something more dramatic, but there it is.
John’s stomach tightened, his mouth forming an impossibly hard line of tension. A fresh whisky was placed before him. He gripped the fresh glass until he was certain he could shatter it with his grip. “What happened?”
“Brilliant!” With one long gulp of his beverage, the darkness, always at so close to overwhelming him, began to ebb away. He sighed in relief before looking back to Sherlock. “I’m going to get one more, yeah? Then we’ll have some fun.”
“So you’re scared they can’t handle you,” said John a bit too loudly. “What else?”
“Then why-”
“Deductions,” he said finally, seeming to judge John worthy of knowing him in return. “That’s all they are. I see you and see a musician and insomniac. I can know you are haunted by the war, your childhood was less than perfect, your brother isn’t talking to you, and you’re overdue for a dental appointment.”
“Do you want to know who in this pub still wets the bed?” Sherlock asked, voice low and conspiratory in a blatant but intriguing effort to change the subject.
“A wife?”
“Sherlock,” John just barely managed to scrape out from his terrified throat. He would have set fire to his own heart just to erase the source of those scars form existence. Sherlock froze in the doorway, knuckles pale with their grip on the shirt. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Three days he’d been on the case.
No. His mind rebelled against processing what she’d said. No. The world was spinning, the woman disappearing behind miles of blurred concentration. No. It couldn’t be. He’d misunderstood.
Mycroft impatiently opened the box, quizzically examining its contents: a tacky snowglobe, a rather ugly sweater that would surely itch, and a collection of decorated sugar cookies.
“Alright, we've got it narrowed down to these two,” John sighed with resignation. He loved these movie nights but absolutely despised the selection process. “Miracle on 34th Street or Love Actually.”
“I certainly didn’t take that shot for fun.”
Then he went to uni and his object of affection shortened in two senses of the word: Tall, lanky Jonathan became a thing of the past and short, stocky John Watson replaced him. His very first words to Philip had been “Excellent finger work on that sax,” and Philip, mouth dry and heart racing, had been instantly in trouble.
“On the grounds of fate, of course,” supplied Holmes with a cheer indicative of an impending explanation.

“Wha- Sherlock!” bellowed John in surprise as Sherlock’s hands firmly gripped John around his waist and hoisted him up several feet in the air.
“Yes,” snapped Sherlock. “But I am more than a statistic.”
Without even thinking about it, he began to grind his hips against Sherlock’s, pleased to find as he did so that he could feel the other man’s hard form around his movements. He could hear Sherlock’s breath hitch at the motion, and the ability to impact him in such a way gave indescribable satisfaction. He continued to move, reveling in how it caused Sherlock’s kisses to grow more frantic, small moans leaving him every time John rolled himself over Sherlock’s erection.
His heart was a stone in his chest. Sherlock could not bear to think about it.
John was radiant in his true joy saying, “Best damn day of my life.”
“Any other surprises we should know about?” asked Tobias to nobody in particular.
The unforgiving cement beneath him left a bruise where his body was frozen in paralysis. The whole of his right side was a pattern of black and blue, exposing his lack of movement where he lay in this place of misery.
He’s incessantly curious. SH
, John.”
“How-”
No, nothing was alright. “Yes. Please, when can I see him?”
Silence followed, unbearable to endure. Again, his breath remained stubbornly frozen in his own chest. It was as though the words were echoing around him, frozen in the air until he was suffocating. The silence between them spread into an insufferable torture, and Sherlock was now certain that every word he had spoken had been a meter dug deeper into his own grave.
“Right.”
The doorknob turned hesitantly, a head slowly poking around the door frame and John was instantly sitting up straighter. The young man’s eyes scanned the room only for the briefest of moments before finding John. He couldn’t believe his eyes.
“But… how?”
Reality seeped in slowly, crawling water drops along a glass pane until John turned to register a wildly cheering crowd. The gathering of people in front of him were on their feet, wildly whooping and hollering in response to the music they’d produced. Nothing felt real as they stood up and walked off stage. Only distantly did he register the announcer’s words, fading as he walked away.
Forgive my absence, folks. 🙏 My other WIP (
“Because,” John said slowly while Greg put a hand over his mouth to hide a smile at John’s thinning patience, “we all need this.”
Instead, he dug the heels of his palms into his eyes until he saw brilliant blue spots projected on his closed lids.
A rather beautiful woman sat two tables down from him, though he could not catch her eyes despite how hard he laboured. Another man that John figured was around his own age- perhaps a few years younger?- sat in the isolated corner seat, face hidden behind a thick volume of pages. He spotted jet-black curls above the book and forced himself to tear his eyes away from his long legs that were crossed and bouncing to an unheard rhythm. The only other person sitting in this small space was an older gentleman who stared out the window, clearly lost in wistful thoughts that left the rest of them behind.
“Barely.”
“What’s so funny, then?” he asked, standing a bit too tightly between the two of them.
All roads lead to death. In every sense imaginable, that much is true.
Yet nevertheless, they were the same. Reserved, hard to connect with. Cold, slow to trust. Together they fell, their hard shells crashing together to expose their softer insides with little resistance. They made each other laugh, the wine warmed their insides and assisted with bonding, and John found that he had been silly this whole time.
“An act.”
At least he’d
John broke the silence first, saying, “How long have you been wanting to do that?”
He riffled through the letters until he found an envelope matching the description: unbalanced writing with a great deal of effort evidently put into keeping it clear and controlled.

“Well, there is only one more band left to change your mind. Once again, this is Janine and Archie, your hosts for tonight's broadcast, brought to you by Bayer Aspirin, just in time for the holidays. Our last contestants are six of our boys just home from the war and a young man who lost his wife and best friend in the war efforts with a song called
“You know, it sounds so easy when you explain it all like that,” he said, just drunk enough to be unable to prevent the dreamy note of admiration in his voice.
His eyes narrowed, reading guilt all over John’s face. “What did you do?”
- how difficult these things were for him. What was he playing at?
Lestrade will never get a break from the Holmes brothers.
“What was what about?” Sherlock asked, not sounding nearly convincing enough.
John's shot a surprised look toward Sherlock, whose face was arranged in a stony glare directed toward Wiggins. “What do-”
Sherlock Holmes moved like a man dying of thirst presented with a glass of crystal clear water. They were together, hands frantic across each other’s bodies as their mouths moved in clumsy unison, each of them striving to satisfy a carnal need deep within them. John’s head was swimming in thoughts of Sherlock Holmes, certain that absolutely everybody on Baker Street, everybody in London, everybody on the planet would hear the world as he knew it crumbling around him.
“What does it
“I can understand that,” John spoke, hoarse and speaking to the air more than Sherlock. Still, Sherlock heard and they shared a fourth shot without needing to discuss it.
“If that pleases you, Doctor.”
“Positive.”
He was the only man without a partner in this light gathering of people outside the bar. He was leaning against the wall like he had not a care in the world, but his strikingly bright eyes were alight with mischief. Locks of perfectly curled, black hair framed a face consisting of angles and panes that gave him the distinct look of a prince out of his time.
Unbelievable. This man was insufferable. John settled into the right cushion, making a show of trying to get comfortable to shame his friend into moving over. It didn't work of course, but it made John feel better.
,” he reprimanded, voice suddenly stern. No challenge was more irrefutable than someone else's doubt and Sherlock’s denial in his ability was a flame in his chest.
With a clang, Lestrade’s empty glass met the table. “Alright, time to refill. Next round’s on me, want anything?”
“John,” whispered Sherlock, his whole body limp from orgasm and voice weak with the effort of speaking even that one word.
Furious. Reserved. Aggressive. Engaged. John was all these things, though Sherlock had imagined none of it.
Welcome Home will be a Bandstand!AU (Bandstand is a musical) wherein Captain John Watson returns home from WWII with more than his fair share of trauma. A musical soul, he tries to reincorporate himself back into society by performing but finds that everyone is more concerned with saying they are proud of soldiers than actually trying to help them. He struggles to find work in the city but he soon finds out about a life-changing opportunity. All he needs is a band and a singer. The band gives him a reason to live but he copes with survivor's guilt as he grows closer to his late-best friend's significant other: Sherlock Holmes.
“Great.” Philip picked up his case and shrugged on a jacket, feet taking steps away even as he continued to speak to John. “Meet me at The Rio Lounge tomorrow around 1900.”
By popular demand, that "deleted scene" that I mentioned from Greg's chapter is now canon but featured from Sherlock's POV instead. :) I also get "Danny Boy" stuck in my head
Lead feet carried him to the threshold. Three breaths attempted to steady him, to centralize his thoughts, and his fist raised to rap twice on the door. It was the soundtrack of his anxiety, the trepidation of the knocks loud in his ears. In the silence following his knock, he heard the echo of the sound rattle in his mind and there was no breath or time or awareness- there was only an eternity of silent expectancy.
Which I wasn’t. SH
Sherlock does some thinking and reaches an inescapable conclusion.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Victor didn’t tell you what I do for a living.”
Jackson rolled his eyes and put his hand up to stop John’s pleading. “Watson, we just got a new headliner. The gals just love him, they call him “Babyface.” See, he’s eighteen and draws in the crowd- and what a crowd it is!”
“My heart was icy, cold, and closed before you,” continued John as though he had not spoken. “Since you’ve entered my life, it’s been an entirely different existence. I’m happier, life is fuller. I’m not quite as sour toward it all. I eat now, my memories hold less horror than they used to.”
3. Sherlock Holmes is in love with him.
“Oh,” he said, taken aback but grateful for the change in subject. Oh, how he wanted another shot. Oh, how he knew Sherlock shouldn’t have a third so quickly. “It’s a competition for bands in Britain to write a song to honour the returned men in uniform.”
“How long have you been playing?” John ignored the way Sherlock leaned in closer when he asked. Well, he tried to, at least.
“Sherlock?” he called hesitantly, his eyes unable to make sense of the overload of information that the room offered. Sherlock always said that John sees but does not observe, and at that moment, he had to agree. The flat was registering visually, but he was far too overwhelmed to take any of it in. The minute details of the ensemble were lost on him.
All around him, classmates picked up their pencils and set up their drawing station. They moved as he assumed his position and everybody in the class was in motion except for himself.
that John would never allow Sherlock to endure ten consecutive shots. It was an unhealthy challenge he would embrace happily himself but would be mortified if matched by his companion.
I mean I'm not saying I cried again while writing this chapter but... I mean... I definitely did.
The man he was introduced to is based on the actor who plays John's equivalent character from Bandstand. Just my way of giving another nod to the source material. :)
“Right, well I can’t very well help you with your sleeve on,” John snapped, beginning to wonder if this handsome stranger was worth the smart arse attached to the beautiful face.
a surprise.”
He reciprocated the motion, opening his mouth against Sherlock’s to move his tongue inside the man. Their tongues brushed together, their lips pressing together with more vigor than before. On his side, he felt Sherlock’s hand twitch and John needed no further cue: maintaining contact with his lips, he rose clumsily from the floor and wrapped one leg at a time around the man’s hips until he was straddling him while Sherlock’s hands lifted tenderly to rest upon either side of John’s waist.
“As per the rules, I don’t believe I need to answer that,” Sherlock said, repeating John’s own words back to him.
“She’s with women around her own age, though. She’s not talking to men so she’s not trying to rise above her station.”
“Yes.”

“And what’s wrong with the landline?” Stamford asked.
Yet even with the rising anger, he felt shame. It was woven into his blood, this quick-rising anger. He couldn’t understand why the man before him was reacting as such, but he knew he wasn’t angry at Sherlock; he was embarrassed at his refusal to reciprocate and he was turning it into a manageable emotion.
“I wasn’t going to- what lead?”
“So to make a living, he’s been forced to the street as a middle-man to deliver drugs to addicts in need of a fix. It’s as much of an honest living as he can get and he must look the part, so he wears what he wears. He, himself, is sober- not even a drop of alcohol in him.”

He’d said it mostly for himself, but Greg lit up enthusiastically in response. Philip and John both looked at him curiously. “This guy I know is
Without too much thought, John shoved Love Actually into their DVD player. John remained kneeled before the telly just long enough to skip through the trailers and select play on the menu before rising to his feet.
“Right,” intervened Sherlock, his patience visibly thinning as though the interaction had taken hours rather than minutes. “John, why not give Wiggins here the details on where to meet and we can all be on our way?”
” escaped the machine.
John flinched away from the name, though Greg couldn't begin got imagine why. Yet with the rest of the band agreeing that they all knew and John letting the piano cover drop over its keys, they all began packing away and small talk erupted that arose as the very specific, distinct sound of the end of rehearsal.
“Ease up, mate,” Greg said, taking a drink of the delightfully cold amber liquid. “I’m not actually attempting to use my super successful pickup line on either of you.”
And he was right. “Technically, no,” he admitted. “I’m just a med student. But this isn’t technically a clinic or any formal treatment centre so they let us future doctors take a crack at it.”
“Sorry, it’s in my coat,” Stamford said casually.
It was evident that Sherlock, too, was surprisingly sober. Though John could tell the man wasn’t completely unaffected because of the lazy smile that had cemented itself on his regularly guarded face.
Not anymore.
“No.” The word was a dagger in his heart, allowing his very existence to seep out of him instantaneously. “Sherlock, our separate lives have a million miles to go. But you and I… you and I are just one second.”
Ah, now there are two people who aren’t scared of him. He’ll be so disappointed. SH
“Brilliant,” he said in a low undertone. “See? Now I’m forced to attack some other way.” With long fingers, he moved his knight to a position that didn’t immediately make sense to John. Though to be fair, his mind wasn’t properly functioning.
The two were unabashedly laughing now, his parents joining in on the laughter though they clearly didn’t understand either. He knew they were laughing more at the joy of their other son than from any understanding of the joke.
The memories flushed him with a sickening guilt. John had never been honest with Mary, Sherlock, or even himself about the extent of his affection for the detective.
“That’s what we deserve, isn’t it?” John choked out, looking up for only a second to see Tobias’ lip harden and Greg’s eyes heartbreakingly crestfallen. “I don’t know about you, but I have seen too much of hell. After bunks on cargo ships? After trenches in the rain? After personal injuries? After watching my brother die? After running for cover and dodging death? After fighting for four goddamn years and losing my faith in any God?”
Tomorrow's prompt: Star
John’s voice cut through his concentration, his eyes forced off of Tobias to focus on John, concern on his smiling face, his head tilted.
John's smile reflected the light in the room so that it surely could have been seen from space.
know. Not for certain, at least. His theories were repeatedly confirmed, though perhaps John was simply a chronic liar as opposed to a cursed soul forced to avoid the truth. But how could he ask?
Him. His. Sherlock Holmes. A man?
It wasn’t possible for John’s smile to widen, though it certainly was trying. “I’d love that. You free now?”
If she noticed that he remained still, she gave no indication of it. She moved further forward in her seat, her arms wrapping around him to-
“What’s her name?” John asked, imagining what the Trevor household must be like outside the tragedy of war.
Tobias entered silently behind them, face expressionless and his trumpet secure in its case. Not one soul save Wiggins acknowledged his entrance and Sherlock’s heart constricted with the group’s indifference. Philip worked sourly with glances up toward John, Sholto continued to polish an already spotless portion of his trombone, John and Greg were deep in a teasing exchange, and Wiggins stared blankly at a spot on the wall opposite him.
If there existed but one grand truth, it was this: Sherlock Holmes was incapable of uttering words devoid of deception. He was full of the poison, cursed from birth to speak only lies.
His voice when he spoke was sparse and terrified. “I don’t want to go back to a world without this.” He said the last word with a deliberate shake of the both of their hands. He gave a defeated shrug, but Sherlock could not figure out why. For the words had elated Sherlock’s heart to unknown heights.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look who’s up now,” shouted Lestrade over the din of the song.
John drummed his fingers against his palm as he made to follow the man in a last-minute attempt to keep his fingers limber. Sholto picked up his case containing his trombone while Greg, Philip, and Tobias carried their instruments loose as though they were extensions of their own hands.
The man asked him to sign a few papers, asked for his breakfast preferences, and gave Sherlock back his card. At long last, he was escorted to his room and bade good night by the plain-faced employee. The room was comparable in many ways to his room of the previous two nights, though with several improvements. One window was looking over what was sure to be a beautiful sunrise, the bed was several inches thicker of increased softness, and he was placed strategically above an outdoor sitting area, a prime location for easy listening in on conversations that visiting guests would have with their families regarding new happenings in their lives through the window. Perhaps there would be talk of these murders, a first-hand account of some interaction they’d had in the days leading up to any- though, hopefully, Lauren’s- murder.
John will burn through those in one day.
“She said ‘he’s no longer around.’ That terminology, John. It’s something divorced or widowed people say. It implies he’s gone permanently. Now tell me, why would a woman whose husband has been missing less than a month and has, in no capacity, been presumed or declared dead use that verbiage? Especially someone who clearly craves attention so badly: what could garner more attention than a missing husband? A dead husband would accumulate sympathy, certainly. But it also calls for distance from those around you. A missing husband? It’s drama and attention that could be dragged on for months, years even.”
He moved a white pawn to E4, allowed only one brief glance to the pretty women whose eyes still hadn’t risen from her screen, and walked briskly back to work.
They stood still, silent, for an impossibly long time, John’s heart surely abandoning him with its violent palpitations. When Sherlock finally moved out of the gap, his hand leaving John’s mouth, they clamoured together into the street in silent chaos.
Then it was done and Sherlock was facing him, eyes wide to make his deductions and his hands fidgeting with one another. John tried to say something- anything at all, but his whole body was paralyzed with horror that Sherlock misinterpreted.
The man ran closer and closer, looking crazed as he flitted from bed to bed in search of Victor until he was close enough to Mycroft for him to see his still-fresh battle scars. There was a significant gash on his left arm that was clearly the damage of a rock- most likely from a fall he took. The fog of war was still over him, his mind not yet realizing that it should be processing any pain from his multitude of broken skin. His name tag and rank were smeared with mud and were difficult to make out, but based on the visible evidence, he reasoned them both and called over the din of the tent:
He bided his time, the day stretching behind him, the end drawing nearer until the sun hung low in the winter sky. Only then did he permit himself to travel into The Crescent, lively and booming with energy. The source of its energy was entwined with the lively band releasing an arrangement of jazz melodies that intoxicated the blood in his veins. Gazing at the stage, he saw himself seven years previous, smiling under brilliant lights that cast harsh shadows as he sang his tunes to a full house. He saw the shadow of his past flicker across the stage, fading into nothing when reality caught up with him.
Four minutes.
Sherlock blinked, his heart wrenching painfully from this show of excessive cruelty. What was John getting at? What, pray tell, was the purpose of this level of emotional brutality? Sharp, surprising tears made themselves known by burning painfully behind his eyes. He refused to concede them, refused to show just how much John had disappointed him. His face twisted into a mask of deflective anger.
“You said you’re the best,” said John with quiet intensity. “You said you’re amazing.”
Injected in those two words was a world of understanding that stabilized the quivering world beneath him.
to think he was uptight.
(in case you were wondering what Sherlock's POV was during that portion.)
The frigid night air was a bolt through him. The instant contrast of his sweaty, leather-clad legs against the winter night was peculiar and not altogether unwelcome. There seemed more than a door between him and the club now. Music was dead upon this street, yet the beat seemed to be riding through the wind around him. The ghost of the song was still in his blood.
He fixed the man with disbelieving eyes and then went to work on cleaning the wound. “You mean to tell me that you challenged somebody to stab you and they actually did it?” He was quickly realizing he wouldn't be able to properly fix this wound with the shirt fabric in the way.
He's fortunate to have an unlimited texting plan.
“Pleasure,” Sherlock said to Tobias, extending his hand in a handshake. “Would any of you object if I stole John away for a drink? I have business to discuss with him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock raised his eyebrow in a challenging manner, saying, “If I recall correctly, you were more than ready to take ten shots by yourself.”
“Right,” he said softly. His eyes fell to the liquid in the saucer and he cleared his throat. “First, I need Tuesdays off. It’s the one night my family- It’s… our night.”
“And- and- you didn’t work with- Victor?” His name was fire in his throat, a painful but necessary question ripping his heart even as he asked.
- I mean if you can’t even
“I’m not using you, Sherlock. You have to believe me- I mean it. My entire life has simply been leading up until the moment I met you. I have spent my whole life falling into you. You are my safe harbor. I love you wholly and completely. In every universe, in every timeline, in every version of this world that exists, I love you. In a thousand lifetimes, I will love you in every one. There are no words available in existence to tell you how ardently I want you and your companionship for the rest of my days.”
Soiled.
Why had she come down here? What was she doing? Did she know her murderer?
“So we give it to Philip, yeah?” confirmed John.
, then how can you…” he trailed off, allowing the insinuation to fill the gaps.
“That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” breathed John between gusts of laughter.
A foreign wail of pain resounded throughout the room. Distantly, Sherlock wondered where the noise was coming from. Why did Mycroft halt his explanation? It took far too long to realize that the sound was coming from himself.
After he’d released it, he hadn’t considered where it might land.
“No, please, Sherlock. Please just listen, okay?” John pleaded. Sherlock was physically closed off, his arms crossed, his mouth tight, his body full of tension. John scrambled into his seat once again and leaned in, gazing at him with nothing but hope and eagerness.
He gave Sherlock a long, quizzical look. What the hell was he thinking? How was he supposed to just
Tobias wore a devilish grin and said, “Don’t get used to it. Now play, fish boy.”
“No,” he responded as cool as could be, but he did get off of John. Scrambling as fast as he could, he rose to his feet without an ounce of elegance. He turned a furious face toward his attacker, jutting one pointed finger toward him. But before he could get a word out, the man swiftly extended his hand. “The name’s Sherlock. I’m a detective.”
He gulped, opting for silence and hoping eye contact would answer for him.
“No” repeated Sherlock, throwing his chin up in defiance at the proposition and turning on his heels to stride from the room.

“It is rather good,” Philip admitted, albeit hesitantly. Sherlock looked pleasantly surprised to hear the compliment escape and John couldn’t blame him since Philip's snarky comments toward Sherlock had become more and more frequent.
Relief flooded through his entire body, illuminating him from the inside and providing him with an unfamiliar lightness.
“Well, have-”
I have five passes to get me to shut up, three passes for a non-condescending explanation, two passes where he can fill in the blank, and ONE where he is allowed to ask me ONE question about my sex life. SH
“Will you tell anybody of your love? Are you scared for the world to know?”
“Oh, please,” Sherlock scoffed. “I’m saving you.”
“It can wait a bit. Sherlock, you and I- in this moment- are just one second. But we have a million more seconds, a million days, a million years, and a million miles to go.”
(Also, that paragraph took me like five minutes to type lol)
. Years wasted, years regretting, years suppressing, years resisting, years and years and years.
He shrugged, uncaring. “I do this fairly often. I’m not nervous.”
“Afraid not, sir. One of the rules.”
“I need another drink, excuse me,” he said hastily, gripping his empty martini glass in one hand. He walked away with false ease, pretending vehemently not to notice Sherlock’s affronted stare.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said rolling his eyes slightly, his arms folding over one another. “You’re going to throw up, pass out, or worse. The alcohol content before you combined with your height, weight, and lack of food will accumulate to-”
John had just begun sputtering in contradiction when Sherlock’s hand flew up to halt his words. “I will. But not here and don’t go getting the wrong idea.”
And knowing that must be the truth- for Sherlock had confessed he could only speak in truths- John stepped away. His act of distancing was all the permission that Sherlock needed to leave, apparently, for he twisted the handle in his grip and flew out the door without another word.
“What’s wrong, my love?” John asked softly, his lips pressing into several curls atop his head.
“You keep horrible experiments in the fridge without labelling them.” This time, it was John who took another step forward, his bag sliding seamlessly off of his shoulder without a sound.
“Yes, my love.”
Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he forced the words out, though they escaped perhaps too quickly. “I’m afraid I offended you greatly that night, Sherlock. I- I didn’t mean to. I must have misunderstood what you were trying to say and I didn’t mean to overstep or hurt you. I’m so-”
“Another Mai Tai, good man.”
His head snapped toward the sound of his name, his eyes tight with suspicion even as he caught the sight of John's face working toward him. It was a full two seconds of analysis before recognition washed over him and a smile was spread wide across his face.
“Because it
How was this possible? Victor was married- to a man? How? But
If you're interested in a prequel to this, I can inform you if/when I post one. Just let me know if you're interested. :)
He smiled slyly, an ambiguous look that lent him a cool air of mystery. Then, so easily it felt foreign to him, he said: “Only if you’ll join me to drink it.”
.” The words were sharp with contempt, his mouth a harsh line.
“I do not wish to be used like this.”
“It’ll be Sherlock singing, yeah?” Greg asked, tossing a fresh apple in the air and catching it smoothly. “No offence, mate, but you really don’t have the range for this.”
“Yes?”
“Not that there’s anything wrong with you,” Sherlock said in a frenzied rush of words. His eyes were wide with fear of his own miscommunication. “I just don’t do it. The whole… ‘dating’ thing.”
He was also brilliant and perceptive. He was also friendly, if not a bit odd. He was a skilled musician and writer. He was poised and his motions were elegant.
“We can’t say- for certain,” Mycroft said, with a note of uncertainty that was rarely found in his tone. Sherlock should have been more intrigued but couldn’t find a single reason to care. “He was in battle. We are fairly certain it was a grenade from the Japanese-”
Who's ready for another ~style change~?
Everything. All that there is, all that ever was.
John could not have possibly suppressed the bark of laughter that escaped and surprised even the bartender. Sherlock smiled, his demeanour relaxing. “Well, some say that. Others just… walk away.”
For Sherlock had endured physical wounds that healed, but the thought of a safe and healthy John had sustained him. That thought- that
“You’re welcome.” His voice wavered from desire- or was it emotion? It was too difficult to sort out in this series of events that left his head spinning. This sequence of moments that were already fading away into the past was too much to process.
“What do people normally say?”
“No, unfortunately not, sir. I’m sorry,” the employee said, and he actually did seem sorry.
John: always reserved and withholding. This letter shed a sharp light on his true feelings and, much to his surprise, it placed an inexplicably dreadful weight in his heart.
“You said it yourself; we are just one second.”
“For the competition.”
“Ask me if I adore you,” he whispered, lips leaning in to meet John’s temple. “Ask me if I’ve adored you since the moment I heard you with Mike in the lab.” Another kiss high on his cheekbones and John’s head tilted back in consent of the wandering lips. “Ask me if I adore your company-” the hollow of his cheek, “-Ask me if I’ve been dying, all year, every excruciating minute, to find a way to tell you-” the corner of his slightly parted lips “-what you mean to me.”
"And what of myself?"
Interested in the difference between holly and mistletoe? Here you are:

It seemed nothing John said about himself particularly surprised him. It was almost like he… knew it all? Or rather, like every word out of his mouth was a confirmation of a truth that Sherlock already suspected. John couldn’t begin to understand it but he was entranced and unbothered.
Sherlock thought long and hard about this question. The truth was that his mind worked so fast, he couldn’t always explain
“Victor.”
He watched the man swagger away in disappointment. He wasn’t getting an answer, then.
TW: suicidal thoughts
OR on Dreamwidth:
John’s days were composed mostly of waiting. Today his distractions would carry him through the day until evening came. He bided his time in a bookstore, shooting guilty glances toward the owner every few minutes. The shop was ordained with a stunning, handmade sign that proclaimed support of the returned soldiers but he knew his service would have no real bearing on whether or not he was banned for loitering. Still, he risked it in the name of distraction in the music theory book he found.
“What is it, John?”
He gave a mock salute once again when the whole of them looked at him with a bit of surprise. He didn’t speak much and he spoke much less to contribute actual information.
“Nothing at all,” he laughed. “I told you- my brother has influence in all government matters. To boot, he happens to be particularly meddlesome. He marked me as a 4-F in the official records the moment he caught wind of the war- in 1934.”
“So your brother gave you two a legal marriage.”
?” John practically shouted. Had he heard that right? “What do you mean?!”
Footsteps.
God, that was hot. Why was that hot? John didn’t know, but he didn’t care. That was remarkably hot.
John’s eyes snapped open, the room around him appearing to him as though through an unfocused camera lens. He hadn't even noticed them fall shut. “What?”
I love the band so much. I love every single one of them.
Tomorrow's prompt: Gingerbread
I promised a post-S4 fic, but I personally align myself with the belief that The Final Problem wasn't real. So to me, the infamous "hug scene" is one of the last of the S4 canon. Therefore, I think this qualifies as a follow through on my promise. (Please let me know if you're interested in reading metas about how TFP is TAB from John's perspective.)
The memory gave him courage.
It was like how John described to Harry how he’d wanted to go to the store yesterday but had run out of time to do it. Casual. Nonchalant. A simple fact. Nevermind that he didn’t know who “David” was and this supposed “David” just
Sherlock had no answer but his mouth hung open in shock.
Stumbling to his feet and backing away with a still-damp face, he shook his head against the horrible truth.
“No kidding.”

instantaneous.
Several words were fighting to escape him all at once and he couldn’t even begin to decide which one should win. He wanted to say “Fine” or “No” or “Yes” or “Thank you” or “You’re a fucking idiot.”
His whole life, he couldn’t seem to understand
John could have leapt with glee, hugged Greg until his eyes popped out, composed an entire opera in one night. “Great,” he said simply, cheeks tight with the smile that overtook his face. It was happening. “Now we need a couple of horns and someone on drums.”
“I mean there is my life before you and there is my life after you. My life before you was nothing but aimless wandering, lost in ambition and love.”

happen, Sherlock.”
“Why?” he whispered with trepidation.
He flushed, mouth opening for a retaliation but his mind unable to scrape one together. She was correct, after all. “Yeah,” he finally said, shame overwhelming him. “I guess it is.”
“No!” exclaimed John because it was all he could get out. “No,” he repeated after another moment, more controlled this time. “It’s fine. It’s all fine. I don’t mind.”
It was a small miracle how often Sherlock was laughing lately. It exuded out of him as surely as the sun’s rays shone upon the Earth and he was helpless to prevent it. He’d never been one to laugh outwardly for such trivial reasons, yet his giggles were nearly infinite with John’s blinding reflection cascading its light over his world.
“Oh dear,” came a familiar baritone voice to his right. “Oh, sir, ma’am, I am so sorry. I am
In this half-high, he swore he heard John’s voice. It echoed around him, ricocheting around his mind as he marvelled at his mind’s ability to craft his desires into nearly-real hallucinations.
Please let me know if there is an element of this chapter that is confusing. I believe it makes sense, but I know everything about this universe so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
His relief was a tangible thing. “The Crescent.”
Spinning his head abruptly to the man, he threw his mind into overdrive to make deductions. 21 years old (third year at uni), poor time management skills (clearly he had been late to class), very confident in himself, taking this class as an elective, and-

John suffered the pain of lost love and now Sherlock, too, understood how significant that agony was.

“I can certainly guarantee that it is not only women who will fawn over your appearance in that sweater.” The words were out, his heart wringing out every last drop courage it held.
“That record doesn’t skip normally,” he said in a nearly apologetic voice. He was distant, and John shot an uncertain glance between Sholto and the record player to determine whether or not he was speaking to him. “I wonder how the damage-”
“Ah, hello John. Didn’t expect to see you here” he said with all the calm he could muster. He was barely aware of his words, John’s face, or anything else in the world. He was only aware of his drug-addled mind as it took in the sight of John and his heart as it beat with the pain of knife wound. “Did you come for me too?”
John Watson had plenty of talent and burning ambition. His songs were authentic from living through four years of hell. John Watson needed something to block out the memory and break this insomnious spell and here it was. His number one priority- his only priority- was to find a group of men who could do this with him.
No, but seriously: I have the greatest readers that exist on this planet. Thank you all SO much for your support and kindness. I deeply appreciate every single one of you more than you can ever know. <3
Soon, Wiggins joined in the new tempo with light taps of his symbol and Sherlock was overwhelmed with an unfamiliar emotion as the rest of the band prepared to join in once more- gratitude?
With the drugs running through him with less intensity, the pain was biting. He flinched from it.
They walked their empty glasses to the bar, where they left them for the bartender to take for cleaning. The soundtrack of their exit was none too pleasant with off-tempo drums and off-key singing. Through their walk toward the grand entrance, they made innocent small-talk until the cold, silent night outside embraced them both.
The pair fell into a comfortable silence, John hauling himself up from his chair and into his room when his buzz turned into a quiet exhaustion. In the morning, he didn’t regret what he said but the two didn’t discuss the brief flirtation.
handsome?

“What the-” he whispered, his words trailing off from sheer dubiety.
Damn. “As I recall, you were against that whole-”
“Oh.” It was all he could choke out, so scared of sounding too excited, too scared of revealing himself.
He always knew this is how he would die, buried alive with the volume of input his mind threw at him. Dying from a combination of suffocating and being crushed by the volume of those thoughts he couldn’t escape.
“John,” he tore John’s strong hands from his chest and clasped them tightly between his own delicate ones. He stared deep into the man’s eyes until he felt an intensity he had never experienced before. “For the first time in my life, it’s as though a channel has opened and you’re the one who let it all flow freely. There is absolutely nothing to contain my love, nothing to contain
Smiling the whole time and allowing Sherlock to get it all out of his system, Lestrade nodded along the whole time. Sherlock was beyond grateful for this. Truth be told, his love had been dangerously close to tearing him apart for want of expression. Now, as he spoke it, he felt his heart release an ancient tension.
They wrapped their set to a scattered round of polite applause, taking their leave off the stage to the modest backstage room with dust so thick, it was palpable on his tongue.
“Papa!” screamed Rosie, running into the living room with the toy train that Mycroft had given to her in hand. She ran into Sherlock’s arms, only just able to unwind themselves from John in time to catch her flying body. “Uncle Lestrade is here!”
Thank you for reading!

, thought Greg, trying and only somewhat failing to mask a responsive smile.
It was a gloomy, dreadful, chaotic day when his assistant informed him that Victor as awaiting a private meeting with him. Mycroft was as startled as he could be, a fairly difficult feat to accomplish.
Holmes’ eyes slid into focus, his lips adjusting in a minute motion toward what he recognized as a pleasant interest. “Yes, Watson?”
Thank you for reading!
“Tell me,” John ordered. “Tell me the truth- our truth.”
It was not that Sherlock underestimated the impact of alcohol. Nor was Sherlock unable to calculate how much alcohol would be needed to achieve maximum enjoyment. Rather, he was determined to allow the different side of himself to come out tonight. Not only for himself, but for Lestrade.
“Whoa,” the boy breathed, eyes still wide and unblinking. “Amazing. How did you know that, then?”
Too close.
“Don’t mention it,” Sherlock responded with a soft passion he couldn’t keep out of his voice. The words came out in a murmur.
“What else?” he croaked because his voice was uselessly out of his control. He desperately needed the subject to change. Immediately. “What else are you scared of?”
A long “hmm” escaped from Sherlock as his eyes scanned John for something he couldn’t guess. “Doctor John Watson,” he said softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pupils impossibly large, he nodded fervently and hoarsely replied, “Yes. God, yes. Please.” His hands were clutching at the armrests, his body writhing for want of John’s touch.
hated Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes again. “Don’t tell John.”
Lestrade sighed and put his hands on his hips. After looking at the ground for a moment, he looked up and said in an even tone, “He’s changed you, Sherlock. I mean, of course, there are the obvious changes like how much happier you are and how much more patience you have with- well, with all of us. But more than that, you’re also more inclined to think of how your actions impact those around you. You’re- dare I say it- more social and kind.”
Comments are the light of my life and my whole source of motivation. Thank you in advance to every single person who does so. I will never be able to tell you how much they mean to me. <3
It was a beautiful sight.
“And you-” Sholto said, more unsure than John had yet heard him, “-you’re the pianist?”
The pair sat with their toes in the water, Victor wiggling his to create thoughtless splashes as the two fell into a comfortable silence and Sherlock could
“Sherlock…” the contrast between the consonants and vowels as the name escaped John’s lips were intoxicating, unparalleled in its impact on his whole body.
By Sherlock.
Who's ready to see what the band will perform?! For your convenience, I embedded a SoundCloud widget of the song before the lyrics begin so you can hear what the band is performing. However, bear in mind that Sherlock is a baritone so the song would not be nearly so high as the woman who sings it in the musical. I encourage you to listen along to the song as you read through the lyrics.
“Really?” He hadn’t meant for it to come out so high and shaky, but it had.
Watching John swear before God and his family that he would eternally love and protect another was unendurable. It was verifiable proof that his love had always been unreciprocated. It was visual evidence at odds with the hypothesis he’d always known he shouldn’t propose. Yet by the warmth of John’s light, Sherlock had revealed more of himself to the man and fell in love along the way.
So he had called up Professor Hudson and asked to volunteer for their nude portrait day.
But the words faded and reality hit the lot of them as the stage door closed and they shuffled toward their dressing room until they were all alive with the energy that just now caught up to them.
“Of what?”
The time simply soared. He smiled, chuckled, made mental notes, and got lost in their music. When, after an hour and fifteen minutes, John looked suddenly up to Sherlock, he was caught completely off-guard. As though he hadn’t the slightest recollection why John had invited him there in the first place.
“John,” muttered Sherlock. Panic rose within him because the word was not one of ecstasy, but one of hesitation.
It was no surprise to him that Sherlock did not stir one iota when John walked in and sat down across from him. He never seemed to notice John’s actions when he was like this.
Then they morphed together, clinging desperately to one another as their lips met with ferocious intensity. Sherlock, abandoning caution, took John in his arms with a passion previously unrevealed. His arms wrapped around John tightly, his head was tilted back to reach John’s lips but it wasn’t enough: he needed more. Their lips were sewn so tightly together that it nearly hurt. They needed this- each other- more violently than either had ever needed anything.
Yet the teacher said nothing in regards to the new boy’s entrance nor in response to the open mockery that was occurring. Typical.
“Yeah,” whispered Sherlock. John risked a minuscule glance up to him and saw that he, too, was looking at the ground beneath them.
It was too much for them both. Finally, John wrapped his mouth around the long cock that was dripping with desire. He went down slowly, making sure to withhold maximum pleasure by working his way up and down the shaft in incremental pieces until, finally, John’s lips were touching the base of Sherlock’s cock and he could feel the entirety of Sherlock’s attraction inside him.
. “So you’ve noticed that I never-” Since he couldn't finish these thoughts, he let the sentences fall away to insinuation and was elated to find a smile spread wide and disbelieving on John’s face.
The primary source of light, however, was not from any of these. The room was lit with what must have been hundreds of flames, each connected to the wick of different sized candle. They cast dancing shadows around the room, their heat washing over them both in fierce waves.
If I may be so bold as to say so, I love this chapter. Thank you for reading! <3
He was right of course. “Right. I think we’re getting along alright. How many rehearsals do we have left?” He meant it as a rhetorical question, raising his hand to double-check the days on his fingers when Wiggins spoke up rather unexpectedly.
“It's good,” defended Sherlock with a pout. To reinforce his point, he swept his glass into his hand and took a long drag of the bright orange slushie. The action caused a brain freeze that Sherlock attempted to quell subtly, but his wince surely gave him away.
“No, I’m serious. I like it. It looks
“Ah, best of luck to ya, then,” Greg said nonchalantly, though scanning Sholto under his eyelashes as he walked away from them, his march continuously that of a soldier’s. What sort of gathering was awaiting Sholto at his home?
He was walking away without another word and John was frozen in place.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, his smile faltering slightly as he caught sight of Sherlock, his eyes lit with curiosity.
Sherlock stood upright quite suddenly, his jaw set in determination as he put the socks in their basket of goodies. Without another word, he strode toward a child’s section that John quite suspected would be the source of Anderson’s gift. He was pleased to be behind Sherlock because he smiled for a bit too long at the fuzzy socks sitting innocently on top of expensive cologne and a top-shelf umbrella.
“How have you been?” John injected into the silence between them.
within him to read this letter and there was nothing remaining to impede the emotional response.
"Then we will find you work in the intelligence-"
“Everyone knows it?” called John to the rest of them to a chorus of indistinct agreeance, shuffling around their instrument to prepare.
Sherlock and Victor have one last night of sensational passion together before Victor is shipped off to fight in the war.
Deleted scene that I couldn't fit in but I need to make sure my readers know about: After spending a few hours messing around with John and Sherlock that night, Sherlock remarks that Greg wouldn't make a bad detective. As a final test of his deductive skills, he asks Greg to deduce John. Greg looks at him up and down for a long time before saying "well he's clearly dressed a date, isn't he? Guess he got stood up, though, seeing as how it's so late." A long silence follows while John flushes, stammering denials that are not remotely believable. Sherlock's eyes widen in realization, saying "What an interesting theory..."
“Don’t insult me,” Sherlock said, voice falling to frustration for the smallest moment. “I know you’re hiding something. I know it. I used to think it was okay, that it would pass, that I could live with it. But it’s not. And it hasn't. And… I can’t.”
“Good,” he nodded as his own eyes swept the amassing crowd. “You’ve no reason to be.”
Context: I've been thinking a lot about the end of TST when Sherlock is speaking with Ella in that weird room; about how the room looks like an attic, about how the encounter is never explained, and about how it probably wasn't the first time Sherlock saw her.
“Gentlemen,” said Sholto, his face fighting a smile as well. “Please, I want to maximize our productivity and I would like to see the kids tonight.”
“His name, for starters.”
“Sherlock,” John called from his piano where he was amassing a pile of unorganized papers. “You okay?
“You had too much to live for,” Death says as though these words don’t pierce Sherlock's mind with needles of confusion.
“Of- About- About that night that we- That you-”
A rather adorable “humph” escaped Sherlock in return, his arms crossing into a tighter manner. “Look, it’s not about being
The place was small and intimate with enough of a crowd to allow for privacy in their conversation but without a large number of people that would forbid peace. It sat in a perfect medium and John mentally gave himself props for choosing such a perfect environment for this outing.
? Sherlock’s anger rose as rapidly as it diminished into guilt.
There are also some spoilers in the songs before these so you aren't safe anywhere unless I tell you to listen to the songs haha.
He opened his eyes and, holding the paper at a safe distance from his tear radius, began to read:
If you like it- if you find yourself glad you came, then you sing along with me on one of the practice songs,” John had proposed. And Sherlock had agreed.
He’d meant it teasingly, but Sherlock smiled knowingly, shrugging to concede and said, “Fine, how about her?”
“No!” John shouted, wishing quite desperately he could pull his hair out. “No, okay?” He felt every pair of eyes on him, their stares burning holes into him, holding him to this spot with a cumulative fury. “We joined this band to win this competition, yes? Well, I got news for the lot of you: we’re playing like shit because we’re at each other’s necks constantly. How do you propose we play as one unit if we are too busy treating each other like the enemy?”
itsalwaysyou-jw.tumblr.com
Shit. John’s eyes racked the board, desperate for a way to kill the queen who was one move away from a checkmate. He was so surprised, he couldn't even think to scan his surroundings. Instead, he scanned every piece, imagined their best possible move for his given situation, and juggled between two options: save his king as a short-term solution or kill the queen but leave himself vulnerable to attack from one of their rooks.
He knew better now.
“Her stockings…” John ejected cautiously. “They’re painted on, aren’t they?”
“But I loved you.”
,” urged the voice in John’s head. He willed the forgiveness into the universe as though it would occur through sheer will.
know about rap and he knew he'd be caught in the lie and God, how long had he been silent now? “I kinda like… classical music,” he said, cheeks flushing scarlet. The truth was embarrassing.
An incredible amount of time spent suffering was relieved almost entirely in the arms of Sherlock Holmes. The affection was undeserved while Sherlock still bore the injuries of John’s rage.
Sherlock- beautiful, brilliant, entrancing, exciting, hilarious, and human-
“Please,” he said again, urging Sherlock to listen with every ounce of his being. Impossibly, miraculously, incredibly, Sherlock finally released his tension and, with a sigh, silently gestured for John to continue.
“Er- yeah, come on in,” John muttered, closing the door behind him and panicking about the state of the place. Stray books littered every visible seating option, his throw blanket in an array over its chair, the singular light source now seeming small and lacklustre in the presence of such a shining personality. It wasn’t messy- he was an army man, after all- but it was a bit cluttered, a bit demonstrative of his way of life. He found himself embarrassed by it, wishing he could boast a more impressive living arrangement. “What are you doing here-”
Apparently, he’d decided a meeting at his home would be most appropriate. John travelled the streets with only slight confusion due to less familiarity with this portion of town and, after a fair amount of walking, glanced once more at the paper in his hand.
The words took their time sinking in, his mind working over what his friend was meaning. “I beg you, explain your process of reasoning.”
“Because Frank Sinatra is a fraud,” said John with a venom that resulted in a series of chuckles.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said dismissively. Then, suddenly, the thought was in his head and his mouth was heeding no caution. “How long have we been friends?”
“For longer than I’ve been alive.”
Because who would have thought that John would turn away from Philip almost entirely to place another man on a pedestal high enough that Philip couldn’t even reach?
But John was back- for good- and Sherlock Holmes was 42 when he could say with unfaltering certainty that he did, finally, after 34 years spent searching, have a home.
Sholto ushered John into his home and offered him a cup of freshly brewed tea. Politely declining, he took in the state of the house he was in. Primarily white with accent colours of blue and grey, every single last item in the house was in its place. Every book on the massive shelves was organized and labelled like it was its own small library. Every utensil in the kitchen was placed in order of purpose and size. Every blanket was folded, every pillow fluffed and placed in rigid position. There was not a trace of dust in the whole place, the sinks even remaining clear of any build up.
“The only portion you didn’t care for was my excuse.”
I wonder if they ever will... ;)
Yes, John’s leather trousers positively must have shrunk. They were suddenly uncomfortably tight.
“I couldn't stop my hand from rising to wipe away that snowflake. The attempt to resist was futile. I rested my thumb on your nose, the moisture melting between my thumb and your skin before I swiped away that moisture. My hand rested on your cheek, a motion I had no excuse for. It was the natural position to assume after my thumb brushed your nose.”
“How long-”
It's been more than a year since Sherlock received the telegram announcing Victor's passing but the loss still hurts as though it's a fresh wound. Sherlock hopes the client that is coming at 2:00 will distract him from some of the painful memories but that plan crumbles when the "client" named John Watson admits that he used to know Victor.
His prism was gone now; never from his heart, nor absent from his life, but gone from his future. He walked around and saw the world in only distant, dull detail.
As a little nod, Jeremy Brett (Sherlock Holmes from Grenada Holmes) actually plays one of the love interests in the movie version My Fair Lady (Freddy), which is referenced in the third paragraph of this chapter. :)
Sometimes you just gotta write drunken Johnlock going on cases. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Turning off the lights and grabbing the remote, John walked over to the couch and saw, in the dim light of opening sequence, that Sherlock was limiting his seating options. He sat criss-cross applesauce on the centre cushion, his knees spilling over the seam of the other two cushions.
Now he knew John had loved him nearly as passionately as Sherlock had always loved him. Sherlock imagined being safe in London but coping with the permanent loss of John. He knew beyond doubt that suffering the loss of the love of his life would be immeasurably worse than any wound afflicted from undercover work.
Sherlock rambled the rest of the cab ride home about John, his words following his train of thought as it changed course through John’s appearance, the cute habits John had, how he changes his behavior to keep John happy, and, most importantly, how excited he was to see him in a few minutes.
One down, 23 to go!
“Okay,” he said into the silence following one of Sherlock’s gorgeous violin renditions of We Three Kings. “Don’t get mad.”
The curt words were a fire in his heart.
“Yes, he also-”
Over the years, John’s ability to reflect light showed Sherlock the way to revealing the colours of life until they were no longer repressed within him. Each new colour formed together into a rainbow over Sherlock’s life that lifted away from his disguise.
This opening note contains TWs that are minor spoilers to the progression of the chapter. If you aren't bothered or triggered by anything, you can skip over this note to be surprised by the plot.
Thank you. :)
Bickering, tempers, and resentments aside, their music swelled in generous waves of melodious perfection around them. Sherlock’s voice filled the room with a rich tapestry of words that he wrote and brought to life. John was not alone in his awe at the incredible voice filling the room. He watched mouths gape, eyebrows raise, and eyes flitting upward every time they reached the conclusion of the song and Sherlock’s voice reached incredible heights.
As promised, John’s food was among the most delicious things that had ever been in his mouth. Even if it hadn’t been, John would have lied to secure a second date with the dark, funny, and handsome man that sat across the table from him. They were the same, the pair of them. Not completely, though. Sherlock was cold, analytical, and mysterious and John was reserved, impatient, and lacked control. They were different, Sherlock needing explanations of how his actions impacted others. John needing constant explanations for how Sherlock reached his conclusions.
Nope, that was true.
good.
“I’m John, by the way,” he said to the table. “John Watson. In case you were… wondering.”
After several hours alone, mind saturated in thoughts of his brother's words, there was no temptation calling him to fall into the escape of heroin. He wasn't certain he could ever forgive John for everything that had come to light, but his anger and resentment had diminished to a cool understanding. After Mycroft was successfully convinced that the hazardous thoughts that had previously consumed him were dried up, he was freed from that grey, unfeeling room.
“Just because I don’t
Read on, friends. :)
Unbidden, Sherlock felt himself expand against John’s bare skin beneath the blanket they shared. If John noticed, though, he didn’t let on. Their embrace continued, their hands exploring the bodies of each other. After a blissful eternity, John’s lips left Sherlock’s so slowly, they were connected until the very edges of their lips were pulled apart by nothing other than the physics of the universe.
I’m waiting.
Even at ten, Mycroft had been a self-important arsehole. Still, that night, Sherlock had cried silently into his cotton pillowcase until the sun began to peak its brilliant rays over the hillside. It had been the first time he'd fully appreciated that his experience was not a universal one. He was different in a way he couldn't even begin to comprehend.
He watched with a mix of endearment and pain as John tried once-twice-three times to stretch himself far enough to place the star on the tree. With each failed attempt, John grew more disgruntled until, on the fourth attempt, he released a string of angry curse words and very nearly threw the star on the ground.
, exactly,” he managed to stammer out. When he received nothing more than a politely curious rotation of his head in response, he continued, “I don’t
. He’d only seen the man twice yet it wouldn’t have been possible for him to not recognize the timber, pitch, and cadence of it.
They’d come so far.
Of course. Of course Victor’s husband would be a brilliant model. Of course sweet, caring, funny, handsome Victor had an equally perfect spouse. Yet there was something…
John wanted to rip his own hair out in frustration. “Ugly?!” he shouted. “God, Sherlock! I’m not horrified because they’re
Good Lord, the mouth on this man. And yet an unexpected, burst of laughter escaped, surprising himself. Sherlock’s sly smile grew slightly, staring ahead but clearly pleased with himself for making John laugh.
“What?” Sherlock said, surprise cutting through his discomfort. “No, it’s not. I-”
Pushing his pelvis aggressively against Sherlock’s and leaning his torso along every part they could touch, John deepened the kiss and explored every crevice of Sherlock’s perfect mouth. He couldn’t tell what was his breath and what was his own and didn’t care. He wanted him- wanted every last bit of him. He kissed him like it was the last time he ever would.
“What-”
“Two, my father was a proper arsehole.”
In truth, he contained all the beauty of the rainbow within him, though it was suppressed beyond recognition. He had no idea, truly, how to allow himself to be the man he was inside.
“You are… of moderate intelligence,” Sherlock said, barely able to meet John’s eyes. So many things could go wrong with the things he wanted to say. Terror was rearing its powerful head at the forefront of his mind and he fought valiantly against crumbling into it.
“Well let’s take a look.”
and so my focus was split a bit.
But still, Sherlock remained in place. His mouth opened and closed several times from the effort of forming the words.
“Yes, your band was better,” said Sherlock matter-of-factly, piercing through his thoughts.

“Okay, okay,” said John, waving his white flag and stopping Sherlock from exacting any more revenge via public deductions. “Fine. I’ll drop it.”
And this infuriating lack of empathy, awareness, or perspective was the reason he broke up with her in the first place.
“Please,” he choked, his voice sticky and eyes flooding with waves of tears. “Please, he’s my friend. Please, I need to see him- he was- he was my friend.”
The afternoons were tortuous due to his absence. Certainly, being around John on those sleepy, rushed mornings were difficult, but occupying himself without John was worse. Why did John have to work at all? It wasn't fair. To his dismay, he had, like Henry Higgins, grown accustomed to his face. Much akin to Henry Higgins, Sherlock was a callous, critical, and prideful man. John Watson was not entirely dissimilar to Eliza Doolittle- rough around the edges and torn between his old life and his new one. Though, in truth, Sherlock had always had quite the crush on Freddy- the man who professed his love so beautifully.
Sherlock could have keeled over that very second and died a happy soul. It was, in fact, the very first nice thing that anybody besides his family had said to him.
. “Could you tell me if they’re a man or woman?”
John hushed him, running one hand gently among the thigh on his right, a love swelling in his heart that he could barely contain.
“Good morning, John,” replied Sherlock. He had wanted to sound calm and collected, like he hadn’t been staring at the man for the past five hours. However, the tone that escaped him was distinctly smitten.
Philip. A wave of relief flooded John, exuberant joy that the man was alive and well and even continuing his career as a musician. For the briefest of moments, John forgot the duality of him; his ability to be both a great friend and an extraordinarily difficult man. It wasn’t that Philip was rude, but he was the sort of person to spoil a good mood rather quickly with his desire to always be right and follow the rules.
,” bellowed John over their mounting anger. “Everyone just shut up, alright?”
“Good.”
Philip struck each note with perfection, his extensive knowledge of music theory providing him with a casual sort of air as the instruments surround him played with foreign ability.
“I think we should put White Christmas back in the mix,” grumbled Sherlock from over his shoulder. The breath of his words was warm on John's neck and his eyelids fluttered from the ecstasy of it.
John would have laid down his life in an instant to make that statement false. He would have made any deal with any devil to alter the reality. He would have welcomed death without question if he could erase what he did.
John watched in awe as the man placed the fallen pieces into squares that actually seemed to look right. Could it be-
“Yeah,” he laughed. “Well you’re not eighteen anymore, are you?”
Sherlock's cheeks filled with a colour he couldn’t blame on the alcohol. His eyes were wide with what John thought was intrigue but could have been terror. The distance between John and the response forming on the lips of the man was too much to handle. His heart leapt around helplessly waiting for the man to speak.
“Yes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What season is it?”
This was what Sherlock lived for; this experience so close to dying.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he muttered under his breath, shaking his head to clear a lingering confusion before redirecting his attention back to the patrons socializing beyond the curtain.
So now he was Philip Anderson: overlooked, alone, hardened, and not even second-best.
That's a wrap, folks. 16,150 words in seven days. Where's my medal?!
“You’re the Snowman!” the said together and fell into a laughter that left them clutching at one another. Mother rolled her eyes and walked into the kitchen for a cup of water while their father simply chuckled amusedly.
The portion of him that fought brutally against closer connections was growling inside him. Sherlock turned on his heels, aware of Lestrade’s silence as he paced toward the door. One hand on the handle, he stopped.
All but Sherlock and Philip rose their hands with mumbled “aye”s.
Did Redbeard wonder who he was?
He moved his attention to James Sholto and read what he needed off of the man. Still, for an excuse to stare, he prompted, “Why are you here so early?”
There are ten days until the fateful preliminary for the band's contest. John has no song and no plan until Sherlock shows up at John's flat in the dead of the night with a solution.
Careful to mind the delicate seal, he slid his finger under the lip of the envelope and revealed its content. Shaking in anticipation, he pulled out the solitary paper within and began to read:
John walked away from The Crescent, his legs carrying what felt like nothing at all. He was light, his heart was leaping over itself in its attempt to beat its way out of his chest. A smile tore at his lips and even as he fought to rid of it, it stubbornly remained.
John Watson is truly elated when every word out of Sherlock Holmes' mouth seems to support his hypothesis that Sherlock, like himself, cannot tell a lie.
But something stopped his train of thought in the sort of way that only one thing could: new information.
No. This was special. He would wait. He didn’t want to rush things with this man who was filling his heart with more joy than he had felt before.
The world would be worse off for his absence.
Sherlock halted and stood frozen, remaining eerily still in the centre of his living room.
“Happily!” he proclaimed, leaning forward in his seat to examine Watson through narrow but blazing eyes. “Let us say I were not a detective but, say, a florist and if you were not an army doctor but, say, a professor. All else remaining constant, my 'genius mind' as you so generously called it would seek and find your romantic heart.”
John picked up a glass, maintaining eye contact as he said, “One, I’m very competitive.”
understand why John liked Sherlock so much.
“John.” His name a swelling desire on Sherlock’s lips. Not a desire for passion, but a desire for the truth.
“Stitched!” he sputtered far too loudly. “It’s been sewn- Blimey, in two or three places? You can see where it ripped.”
John, panting from shock against the cubicle’s edge, didn’t notice Sherlock’s own pacing. When he had held Moriarty captive to allow Sherlock the chance to run, that was the first time it truly struck Sherlock that he didn’t have an accurate read on John.
There were just over one hundred of these alternate realities that he could have traveled through, though he was cautious of how many rooms he entered. At first, the alternate-realities were bittersweet: in the early days, their close friendship was almost comparable to the wild affairs Sherlock created in his Mind Palace. The more doors he entered and passed, however, the further along their story they got. These doors weren’t bittersweet at all; they were heartwrenching.
Swing. Create a song. In honour of the soldiers. It was John Watson to a T: musician, talented, soldier. The idea was forming more quickly than he could grasp it. The world was merely crawling around the sun compared to the racing thoughts within him. Andre Baruch might as well have proclaimed “John Watson: come and get your prize!”
Sherlock flushed red but his voice was stoic. “It’s an experiment,” he defended.
The image swam in his head, that first night John had slid his fingers under the hem of his lover’s shirt to discover a rugged surface under his fingers. He had stopped, kissing each one with whispered apologies.
“But?” shot Sherlock with more venom than he intended.
His eyes flew open, the wild blue of them bearing deep into his soul. “What?” he snapped.
“W-wait,” said Philip, torn between indignation and fright at speaking up. “I can’t- John, you know- law school-”
John’s eyes fell closed, his breathing reduced to the shallowest of motions.
Five weeks. Five weeks of trying to find a job and all he had to show for it was two extra weddings that Al recommended him for. He was grateful for Al’s effort, but it wasn’t enough.
“Alright,” he said. “You need to make sure to keep this dry for one whole day. After that, you need to wash and rebandage it two times every day, okay? Take pain pills as needed but otherwise, you're good to go.”
that brought you to John?”
for permitting me... Thank
“Well, for one thing, they keep your feet warm,” John said distantly, flipping over the price tag of a tie that he thought Lestrade might enjoy.
“Of course.”
“Sherlock,” John repeated slowly, experimenting with how it felt in his mouth. It was a peculiar name, but it fell from his mouth like it was second nature. It was as though years of learning complex medical terms was nothing more than a preparation for being able to appreciate the beautiful sound of his name.
God, he wished Victor was here. He would clap John on the back with a bark of laughter that would light up his eyes and say “Ease up, Watson. He’s my husband, not a croc.”
“What are you on about?” he asked with a friendly smile, taking his scotch with a grateful nod to the servicing bartender and walking a couple feet to where Greg sat.
The question was unexpectedly loaded, his body freezing entirely as six pairs of eyes landed upon him. He’d so nearly forgotten the reason he was there at all. John’s words floated through his mind, clear as the moment he’d spoken them in The Crescent.
Instead, he pulled himself up, heaved a breath of frozen city air, and forced himself onward through the onslaught of pain. Ever the soldier, ever the war-induced clarity of action.
I appreciate you all. Thank you for reading. <3
Sherlock sucked on his lower lip and finished with a sharp nip that aroused a groan of pain-induced ecstasy from deep within John. A burst of pain arose from the spot, and a growl of laughter escaped.
“Sherlock, I am so sorry,” he whimpered through a trembling lip.
Sherlock: okay drinking game to learn more about John because I need to UNDERSTAND
And because there is good left in the world, Sherlock nodded stiffly, his eyes falling to release John from their hold and John could feel the tension lift from the pair of them.

Yet Sherlock’s hands held it for some time without moving to open it. If this contained a confession of love, he was not sure if he was ready to see it. For so long, Sherlock had wondered and hoped for love from the glorious man he shared his life with. He never imagined he would learn of reciprocated love from a letter whose confession would be expired by the time it was found.
“Nice socks,” he said with a great smile.
Without missing even the slightest of beats, he moved his hands to unfasten his shirt, wincing as his right arm pulled in to his torso to fiddle with buttons holding the shirt closed. John, the future doctor, felt the craziest urge to look away. “What’s your name, then?” the man asked while he was uncomfortably struggling with the shirt’s removal.
“No, you- you have the right,” he choked out. “I just- I’m not ready. I’m sorry.”
“Where would you like to pick up then?” asked Philip, fingers poised over his pages.
“As per the rules, I don’t believe I need to answer that.”
“Come on, Tobias-”
Then he kept a
“So that’s it? We just- can’t accept?" Tobias’ voice came entirely too soon after the door closed, though an eternity had elapsed.
But he
John smiled in earnest, staring into the blue eyes across from him with utter confidence. “The very best, sir.”
“Hey,” he practically shouted, volume inappropriate and causing a look of surprise to flash over Sherlock.
"A band so new, they haven't a name yet! Let's hear it for six men recently returned from the war.”
Fine. I’m sorry, okay? Now, will you come help? SH
A zing of electricity shot through him. God, that was hot.
“Go on then.”
“Oi, why don’t you focus a bit more on hitting your mark and less on my technique,” barked Greg an hour into rehearsal, a rare instance of impatience breaking through after Tobias snapped once more at him for being “incompetent.”
But it was perfect. John himself was a decent singer but nothing astonishing. Perhaps not even good enough to win the contest.
“Captain Watson.”
-the most kudos
He wondered if he’d ever know.
An impossibly long silence, the moment lasting a small eternity.
“Yeah- er- I just meant that I- I think it looks good.”
So he had crumbled, his strength diminished. He had left his haunted flat that moment, travelled into the pits of the city’s civilization and located one gentleman who had refused Mycroft’s bribe. In less than half an hour, he was floating away on dense clouds of black unconsciousness.
"I don't see myself blending in there.”
Slowly, excruciatingly slowly, Sherlock manoeuvred the buttons on his shirt. His face was pale with anxiety, his body betraying him with staggering hands and the chewing of his lip. As the shirt slipped away, Sherlock held his breath and turned around with the grace of a crashing car. His motions were jerky and sudden until his back was exposed and John was certain he would never breathe again.
John waiting until she was out of earshot to giggle like mad. “You reckon she’ll spit in our food?”
It was a surprise to find Holmes consider the question in a serious manner. He had meant the inquiry as a rhetorical one. His real question slipped away with Holmes' serious consideration. “Ah,” he said after some time. “I think not, my friend.”
This last door, though, was special.
“All this time?” John uttered to the space between them
She shook her head and smiled down at the newspapers in her hands. “Alright, alright,” she conceded. “But you look very nice and I am very happy for you.” She crossed over to him to place a kiss on his forehead before leaving. She pulled the door closed behind her and, before it clicked shut, she spoke in a coy tone.
Everything lay next to him now, blond hair an untidy tumble of exquisite beauty, facial features lax in sleep, the gentle signs of aging indenting themselves along the curves of skin. John was everything. From the smallest joys on Earth to the greatest sorrows, from the color red to the birds that flew in the sky, John was everything. None of it meant absolutely anything without him.
The letter was close to him.
“Alright,” John muttered and Sherlock placed him down gently back on the floor. He withdrew his hands, relishing how it felt to drag his fingers along the outline of his waist. “Thanks,” he said to the wall.
“Anything else?”
“Sherlock.” The word was a whisper, a beg, a cry for forgiveness. “I love you.”
“Fine,” John laughed. “I’ll go first- but I still
Hadn’t considered that it would land in front of him.
Their endless fits of giggles were only partially due to the 13.5 oz of hard liquor in their veins.
“Well, for one thing, they keep your feet warm,” John said distantly, flipping over the price tag of a tie that he thought Lestrade might enjoy.
Sherlock fought off an enormous smile until his cheeks hurt with it and John declared, “Alright, then. Sherlock will join us for about half of our set.” Then, directing his words to Sherlock, he continued, “Can you learn all the standards in time?”
Sherlock literally leapt with joy at the suggestion, whirling on the spot to pluck the box from where it sat. John watched with love in his heart. He was light with it, his blood singing with pure adoration. This, right here, was enough. The two of them, bickering with familiarity at times and coming together with complete joy and affection at other times. It was an intimacy John couldn’t describe.
Heart in his throat, he ripped the rubber band off so ferociously, the snap of it stung his fingers. With delicate care he hadn’t shown the rubber band, he flipped through the stack of envelopes and saw with dizzying comprehension that each one- every single one- was a letter to him. All written in John’s handwriting.
Half of John’s mouth curled into an uncertain grin. “You’re ready for more?”
Sherlock opened his mouth, nothing but a solitary choked vowel emerging. He closed it, squeezed his eyes closed tightly to release three tears, then opened his eyes away from John, turned around, and left.
“Okay,” declared John, sitting upright and and slamming his hand on the table with stinging force. “Choose a person- any person!”
“Right, er-” John said, face coloring with humiliation at needing to be asked to stand up. He searched for the words- any words- to say, but none came. His tongue was heavy in his mouth, suddenly too large and too dry. “Right,” he said again, grabbing his phone off the table and moving it to his pocket as he stood.
Being in the military was a proper nightmare due to the battles, trenches, and killings. But meeting Private Lestrade at a point in the war when Philip had never felt more isolated and hopeless? That was an entirely new sort of nightmare.
“He is flat,” agreed Wiggins casually.
“Hello,” he said directly, flatly. “You must be Watson.”
“Your wristband,” the man drawled as though it was perfectly clear what he was on about. “To get you back in. You’re wanting to remove it to prevent tempting yourself going back in. But if you take it off, you will still be tempted to return and, additionally, you will suffer guilt for removing the option. Whereas if you keep it on, you can do whatever you please with no guilt.”
Imagining a life without Victor was painful. He considered every cold, isolated, painful path his life could have gone done without him and he became more and more grateful every day to have Victor in his life. He was a shield against words of cruelty, a confidant for the doubts and concerns that crept along the edges of his mind. They were as inseparable as two people could be, the only source of companionship that the other needed.
,” defended John. “He can’t even read music. Plus, he skipped out on the army and sings out of tune constantly.”
“No. No, I mean it. I mean that would
“Well, how have
He was not somebody who deserved the warmth of John’s fire, yet he suffered all the same for not receiving it.
His mouth was suddenly dry, his eyes blinking him out of his trance. A top? What was John talking about? John didn’t need a top. Sherlock had been so focused on the man, their topic had escaped him. He knew the fact of his disassociation would disappoint John.
He pushed himself off the wall, turning to face the lot of them. A fire burning inside him, this cruel, unstoppable desire for even one Goddamned thing to go right. In his face and stature, the band must have seen his determination, his desperation for life. They fell silent, every eye upon him. Some held anger, some confusion, and some dismay- yet in every pair of eyes, he saw the desperation to maintain a grip on this dream that matched his own.
The question surprised him. Partially for the interest Sherlock now showed in him and partially for the strangeness of the inquiry. His finger itched toward another shot, the desire unstoppable within him. “What do you mean?”
Somewhere, deep within himself, he thought John loved him. Sherlock now hated this part of himself for raising his hopes so thoroughly.
Finally, if you (like me) are obsessed with the Lestrade/Sherlock friendship, go read another fic of mine called "Stupid With Love." I will always write Lestrade as a good friend. In that fic, Lestrade invites Sherlock out to drinks. They get drunk, Sherlock sings and dances to ABBA, and Sherlock rants about how much he loves John.
The word repeated in his head over and over and over and over until John was mad with it. There was no breath, no blinking, no sense, and nothing other than the sight before him.
“Three hours and seventeen minutes of rehearsals over the remainder of today plus two more sessions and six days until performance, Cap.”
Sherlock straightened up and looked at John as though the words were a challenge. His pupils were wide and moving too quickly to track, words spilling out of him with extraordinary speed.
“But-
A slow smile tugged at Sherlock's lips, his eyes falling to the starter before them. His delicate fingers lightly grabbed a piece and brought it to his mouth in a way that was both mundane and absurdly erotic.
Sherlock nodded with shocked approval.
“You need help out there, mate?” offered Lestrade, mistaking his stillness for inability.
He didn't want to insult this person who spent money to get here and dressed up nicely only to get injured and have to miss the whole thing. But the longer it went on, the more the din dug under his skin.
“Ah, thank you,” he said with a wave of his hand, dismissing the compliment even as it brought a smile to his face. “And what do you think of the house band, Johnny?”
The rest of the letters were more or less a guessing game. The outward writing would only provide hints up to a point. Taking a guess, Sherlock selected another letter that seemed to be more confidently written than the first and was still clearly written with a great deal of caution.
If it's any consolation, this was originally HEAVY angst. I cut it down and edited it to make it slightly less heartbreaking. Perhaps one day the original will see the light of day.
Yes, John was definitely sitting up straighter- and smiling. Smiling from ear to ear. Smiling in an unnatural manner and God, he needed to reel in the smiling. He forced his cheeks to relax, the very short seconds of silence felt like years and years and why wasn’t he saying
He crumbled internally, his soul giving out, the tragedy of the truth too much to live with. Still, his knees were locked, his muscles tense and while his mind, soul, and will-power changed to dust, he stood helplessly still save for his head, which finally rose to meet the terrified eyes of Victor's widower.
,” he growled between his teeth. His eyes shut close to block out the overwhelming visual stimulus. Mycroft remained stubbornly silent and his silence was worse than a defence. “
Yes. SH
Sherlock lazily held up the scotch in his hand, the liquid sloshing dangerously close to the lip of the cup. The next moment, in one swift motion, the rest of the drink was flowing down his throat.
“At the precinct. You called me a friend.”
“No,” he jumped to correct. “I’m just confused about… I mean to say… Didn’t you just meet them? When did they tell you?”
“And which adventures would those be? The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes? Don’t be so saccharine, Mrs. Hudson.”
James Sholto's life was beyond picture-perfect before the war.
“How?” repeated John, throwing more weight behind the word this time. “How do I stay with you? How do I leave Mary and come to be with you? How do I pack my bags, close a door on everything I know? How do I lock that door and walk confidently away to be with you?”
“It will.”
He hated that even at that moment, he was waiting for the minute he could sneak a picture of the contents to send to Greg. He would rather enjoy the joke, and Mycroft couldn’t believe he was relishing that fact.
“Anytime.”
“Four murders, all with the same MO, have stumped Scotland Yard,” he said a cock of his eyebrow and that ridiculous smile still plastered on his face. “Come along John, my beloved, the game is on.”
“No kidding?”
“Sherlock,” he answered in record time and showing no interest in John’s name.
Lestrade pursed his lips to avoid a smirk and chewed his cheek as he seemed to contemplate Sherlock’s words. It seemed ages before, finally, he threw his hands up defeat. Clearly, he decided not to push Sherlock into talking.
It’s Christmas Eve, he’s the only one laughing, and this daydream is churning into a nightmare. The party is over in an instant, shuffling feet walking out the door to a colder, more welcoming night with half-hearted wishes of good cheer. Sherlock Holmes is nowhere to be seen and John Watson couldn’t possibly be a bigger arse.
His right eyebrow arched in response, but his face remained otherwise stoic. He removed his hand where it sat beneath John’s own, drawing it away as he strode down the hallway. Perplexed, John watched as he walked back into the sitting room, the soft
“He could be mean, he could run away, or he could be untrustworthy. That would be unfortunate. But what if he is kind? What if he makes me laugh and makes me come out of the shell I’ve carefully orchestrated? I wouldn’t even know what to do with that.”
The echoing sound of excited footsteps pacing quickly toward him spread a welcome warmth through his heart.
“What division?” said a voice two seat to his right. John’s head turned to see a gentleman with short, cropped blond hair. He was staring at his own glass as bone dry as John’s.
They walked offstage with the genuine confidence that had been lacking when they walked onto. Their places were taken by the next band and Al’s voice boomed in mumbled clarity as he made their introduction. As the six of them made their way back toward the green room, Greg was positively skipping for joy, practically jumping on the shoulders of Tobias as he chanted, “We killed it! We
“Deal.”
“Yes, sir.”
A bubble of uncontrolled, giddy laughter bubbled out of Sherlock without warning, the truest joy he’d ever felt overwhelming him wholly. This was better- smoother- than he'd ever imagined. “Right,” he managed to say through a smile that threatened to strain every muscle on his face. “Quite right.”
Mike treat him so warmly? He briefly considered being kinder to the man before mentally shaking himself back to sense and reminding himself that sentiment was no benefit to him.
Well, folks, it wasn't easy. This was easily the longest it has ever taken me to write. And it's PAINFUL. Lord, it's painful. But Johnlock demands to be written so here we are.
Soaring through the exit, Sherlock jerked awake and heard his bed protest under the urgency with which he left out and scrambled to the bedroom door. He found himself in the sitting room, chest heaving from a run he’d never physically taken- he blamed the rush, the excitement.
“Come along, I’ll accompany you back to a more recognizable part of town,” offered Sherlock, his hands linked behind his back. His tone was no longer harsh, no longer carrying an undercurrent of resentment, but there was a softness in it that wasn’t there before.
Sherlock sauntered off to refresh their beverages, John’s heart sick with the whiplash of emotions. Perhaps it was cruel to tease himself this way. Perhaps it was cruel to Sherlock to befriend him when there was so much left to confess. Perhaps it was cruel to both of them.
He took in a sharp breath, the air centralizing his mind to the reality of their situation. “Just go sit on the couch!” He ordered, desperately needing Sherlock to take several steps away from him. “I'll pick which one we watch.”
Okay. There may be a small-
“Don’t forget, we have-”
Sherlock seemed to be about to ask a second question but settled for looking at John intently for a long, impossibly long moment. “One more,” he finally prompted after what felt like ages of deliberation.
Sherlock ripped the first envelope out from the rubberband that bound them all together and temporarily dropped the rest, not thinking to glance at the others said until he could absorb the words of the envelope in his hands.
“I want to say… thank you. For.. everything. The evening, for listening, inviting me... For being a friend.”
It was the sort of place where nasty secrets lay beneath a moss-laden log, the innocent cover giving way to vile, swarming vermin. Naturally distrustful of outsiders, the too-polite behaviour displayed toward Sherlock was proving a challenging obstacle to overcome. How could he infiltrate the minds of these locals if they would not permit a glance into their way of life?
The alarm rang with vicious intensity, pulling John from the depths of his thoughts. After swinging one arm to silence the contraption, he dragged one heavy hand along his stubble-strewn jaw and contemplated exactly how many hours one could survive without sleep. Alternatively, how long could somebody survive with a guilt that crushed them under impossible pressure? One of those would surely be his undoing.
“Did you just make a date with Sherlock Holmes?” she asked, wide-eyed in a whisper after Sherlock was well out of earshot.
my thing, so I beg you to cut me some slack. 🙏
“Absolutely.” The guarantee escaped before he intended to agree. It escaped before he would reason himself out of it.
Gas: 40s slang for a good time (or something quite funny).
“I…” the words were causing him excruciating pain, it was evident. “I can’t.”
Because that’s what was sitting in the box: inside the snowglobe sat a smiling snowman who would accumulate further height from the falling snow, the sweater depicted a snowman with two plump portions of body, and the cookies were snowmen personally decorated to be wearing suits and each stick-arm was holding a black icing-umbrella.
Let me begin by saying: I am so sincerely sorry for not responding to all of your lovely comments on the past two chapters. I have no good excuse, but a feeble one: I've been so incredibly busy. I vow to you all that I will respond to all of them tonight because I sincerely, truly, deeply appreciate every kind word you all have left. Please forgive me.
Victor said nothing for a long time. He maintained his eye contact with Mycroft, barely moving.
"Gold Star families are immediate relatives of members of the Armed Forces who have been killed in combat or in support of certain military activities." (
“The patience the band demands,” Sherlock said, eyes intent upon him, scanning him. “The time requirement. The effort of writing the music. Forcing yourself to relive the war experience by seeing the struggles of the others. Will it be worth it?”
John loved these moments: Sherlock was unable to deduce the meaning of John’s staring because he, in fact, was paying no attention at all to his external surroundings. So he drank him in, the hollow of his collar, the buttons on his shirt pulling from the strain, his too-short pyjama shorts, and his-
“It’s just you,” reassured John.
“Er- yeah,” he said, uncertain of how to convert the particular sort of not okay he was. What was he supposed to say? “
John was dreaming. He'd fallen asleep and he was dreaming that he'd met a beautiful stranger who was funny, smart, and played the violin. But John's fingers dug into the palm of his hand and the biting pain told him this was better than a dream. He really was here.

Sherlock Holmes was everything the colour represented.
“I’ve waited a long time for you,” he says.
“I’ll lead the way!” proclaimed Sherlock with a skip in his step, striding out the door with long legs that left John half-running to keep up. He didn’t mind, of course. His heart was light, flying far above London in erratic patterns.
A young man with a brand of acrylic paint that could only be purchased in bulk, a beginner’s sketchbook, and a notebook of notes on subjects taken by the average third-year undergrads. Comparing the time of the crime with the availability of materials lead to only one conclusion: the murderer took this specific art class.
Sherlock: That conventionally attractive woman is interested in you
“Leave me alone,” Sherlock pouted, rolling his shoulder away from his touch and sinking lower into the booth.
“You need to go talk to him.”
Sherlock muttered his good-bye and watched him walk away, a strange admiration in his eyes. “I like him,” he said decidedly after a few seconds of deliberation.
Better make it two.
But he wouldn’t. He’d stay at his house, wishing it felt like a home.
“What the hell just happened?” John asked, his own voice sounding like a shout after his prolonged silence.
“Do you often kiss women you barely know?”
The doors swung open to present him with a cloud of thick air polluted with hot breath, smoke, and the stench of bodies. He was unable to keep his displeasure off his face but continued on, eyes raking every face in the crowd for a familiar chin, nose, pair of eyes, or hair colour that would stir recognition. A blaring saxophone resounded through the air, sound waves trembling with the intensity of the bursts of music. John's neck whipped around to locate the source of the racket, muscles protesting against the sudden motion.
“A meal you’re guaranteed to love,” said Sherlock confidently.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s fingers worked to undo the belt and trousers, freeing them rather ferociously from where they were caging what John wanted.
Sherlock prefaced his response with a drink from his own glass. “I meant that I didn’t want you to think this is a date.”
It is a quiet, lovely day in 221B as Sherlock and John celebrate their anniversary.
He was shrouded in mystery, this Sherlock. He was unpredictable and gorgeous and absolutely insane and John wanted to know everything about him from his family to his favourite food to deepest workings of his mind. John could not recall ever being so intrigued in his life. It was like a magnetic pull that John couldn’t struggle against.
“What’re you smiling at?” asked Lestrade benignly, drowsiness coating his voice.
Sherlock nodded with a delirious smile upon his face, eyes simply sparkling with pride. “Very good, John. Now what does it all mean? Talk through it.”
“I’m sorry you fell in, that-”
A sob escaped his throat, the memory of what he did overwhelming him. It was a horror of indescribable magnitude. He was incapable of comprehending its cruelty. It was suddenly apparent to him that his face was damp with tears, though he couldn’t know when they began.
It has come to my attention that my brother has texted you. Has hell indeed frozen over?
“I want you all to imagine… that there is a train.” John spoke with wavering words. He made no attempt to fix them but allowed the weakness of it. “There is a train that leaves from Cardiff General at quarter after five. Do you know where this train goes?”
This information churned in John’s brain, turning to mush as he tried to reason it. “So your brother... What? Has influence in matters of government?”
When they broke apart, John’s mouth brushed against his to whisper, “I love you too, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock gave him a smile he’d since learned had the knack of charming him. “I told you I’m married to my work. But on second thought, I don’t reckon my work would notice if I got caught up in a rather turbulent affair.”
“No,” said Sherlock curtly. His head was down, eyes risking only side glances toward the handsome boy. “The whole ordeal is foolish. I’m staying home.”
”- instead of remaining pristine to provide millennia of comfort for Sherlock, were illegible, ink bleeding across the page.
But Sherlock was still frozen in his bizarrely formal stance, staring at John down his nose as though he were missing some blindly obvious fact that explained everything.
liked. John couldn't explain it, but he wanted so desperately to impress him. Maybe he should say he liked Rap. That's what the other boys his age listened to. But then he thought of all the things he
“No, I mean it. That is bloody brilliant. You’re a right genius.”
That one unseasonably cold morning in April when the clouds were heavy but didn’t drop their moisture where Sherlock paraded all over London hand-in-hand with John because some villain needed to believe they were together. They’d gone flower picking, their hands warm in each other's grip. John had looked at Sherlock with all the love and adoration he’d always wanted to show on his face. Sherlock put a flower behind his ear and the light brush of fingertips along his face haunted him later that night. Apparently, their act had worked because Sherlock reported that some scout had reported back to the head criminal that they two were dating.
know, John, is why.” It settled in slowly, realization seeping in as he continued to explain: “I know things about you. I know many things about many people. But it stems from visual evidence, not from any sort of connection or confidence. That lack of  intimacy has left me worse for wear and it’s not anything I was necessarily aware of until this evening.”
Sherlock smiled with infuriating patience. “Perfectly sound observation but I was hoping you’d go deeper.”
“Stop.”
When the world rotated for enough time to allow them the strength to break apart, Sherlock rested his forehead upon John's.
Steady. Reliable. Yet still changeable.
John had been a Captain in the Army during the world’s greatest war but this- this required a whole different sort of bravery.
“No.”
I apologize for the delay on this one. It's before midnight PST, but I'm sure it's already the 9th for many of you. Please forgive me!
There was just one problem: John couldn't focus on the movie. Even sitting as close to the arm rest as possible, John's knee was still resting against a portion of Sherlock's leg. He was hyper-aware of the contact and his mind was racing with thoughts of grabbing his knee, throwing his legs over his hips to straddle him, or resting his head against the robe-covered shoulder. He wanted to touch him, to turn this one minuscule connection into something from his dreams.
“Well neither of those apply any more,” injected Sherlock with a smug tone, his arms wrapping more possessively around John’s neck. Their mother tensed a bit at the confession but said nothing. “I’ve got John and you’ve certainly softened since your... deepened kindship with Grahm.”
All he could choke out in the midst of judgemental stares was, “I- I don’t remember the bridge.”
“Which story would you like to hear, my dear?” John's fingers looped in and around the curls so delicately, a lesser effort wouldn't have moved the hair at all. He thought of the beautiful mind beneath these curls. Once storing every memory like a computer and now weakened with age- but always beautiful.
That did it. That broke the frozen terror that had seized him. His head snapped up to gawk at Trevor, eyes bulging with disbelief and a tremulous smile beginning at the edges of his mouth.
“We know,” Greg groaned, unable to hear John’s reminders even one more time before he lost all patience with the man. “The Wallace. Tomorrow. We know, Johnny boy.”
“Devil of a thing, innit?” responds Mike with a good-natured laugh. “Why not get a flatmate?”
“Are you coming, then?” he called, an unseen smirk aimed at the door.
“I promised I would do everything in my power-”
sing.”
make me hate you. Ever.”
Between a family too emotional to provide any helpful information and distant acquaintances remaining steadfast in their insistence that they had no useful information, the well of contacts was emptying. The answer would be from a stranger who had seen something insidious that had seemed innocuous. From a friend of the murderer who saw her the day before, or from a lazily left footprint leading away from a scene of the meeting.
A long silence, John’s heart the only audible sound. “You’re not?”
Sherlock snapped back around quickly, a mixture of alarm and delight on his face. It was a melange that surprised John.
It was a rhetorical question that was answered by Philip. “And which original should we be preparing for the contest?”
“Then I’m in,” Greg said easily, looking immediately bored after he said it, his portion of participation done with.
Her mouth crept slowly across her face, a mischievous glint in her eyes that did nothing to appease the knot in his stomach. Slowly- too slowly- she extracted some sort of pamphlet from within her jacket. No, not a pamphlet- a flyer.
“And his name is…?” he prompted when his laughter subsided.
“I’d have to agree, Janine, their jazz was as hot as a summer’s day. But I’m certain I’m still leaning toward the Supernova Band from earlier.”
“Tell me of one of our Christmases.”
He rose from his chair and strutted to the doorway, nerves raising with every passing step. Swinging the door open, John took in the sight of Sherlock before him, tall and manic. The energy around him was strange, active, anxious. In his eyes, John saw something like determination mingled with an almost sort of fear.
“Right,” said John hastily, rushing over to Wiggins with paper in hand, jotting down the time and location of their first practice. In turn, Wiggins surprised him by relaying that he’d be using his own drums over whatever amenities might be available in their rehearsal space. Tucking “homeless man owns his own full drum set but can’t afford new pants” away in his “most surprising things” folder, the pair finished their conversation. When John turned around, Sherlock was standing some 20 metres away, his back turned to the pair of them.
It was quite the challenge to refrain from the smile fighting to spread across his face. The man was so adorable at that moment, too short to complete the task he adored and too disgruntled to pull up a chair or step-ladder.
“It's unimportant,” Sherlock had groaned.
“Ah, there’s that brilliant mind that has propelled you to your position.”
It was all… so planned. This final goodbye, this period on a sentence he hadn't known had been written yet. He wrote this letter. He asked John to deliver it. Why would Victor write this? Why would he
Taken aback, John wished desperately he could pull Sherlock aside and clarify what, exactly, this guy's story was. A terrible pit of wary disapproval sat like a rock in his stomach. He didn’t even know if this guy was any good on drums.
John was so close. He dared not breathe, so intoxicating was the scent of him. His heart was a tumbling disaster in his chest, the longing to reach over to touch him was pain as real as any wound. The world was nothing of importance compared to John Watson.
Instead, he stared blankly across the table, a nervous laugh bubbling from him without a smile. “Can I ask you s-something?”
“Not particularly,” he said with a falsified indifference to match John’s. “You?”
More to come soon- promise!
Sherlock is only eight years old when a boy named Victor Trevor suddenly enters his life.
“You recall that night?”
The wrong idea? What was the right idea? But he was strolling away before John could even begin to wonder what was happening.
“Are you s-” “Yes.” His words were clipped. He did not have the time to repeat himself nor listen to stupid questions.
In the meantime, let's fall in love with our other band members.
Beware: lots of swearing ahead.
“Deal.”
John hesitated only one half of one split moment after hearing him sit before following suit. Hands active in their wringing, he walked until he stood right next to his own chair. Before him, Sherlock was sitting with his legs crossed delicately, the dangling leg bouncing back and forth as his eyes searched John with skepticism. His hands were steepled beneath his nose, his body language screaming that John was under every scrutiny that Sherlock Holmes was capable of.
“Text me,” he said, as smooth as could be. “Perhaps we could attend the London Symphony one evening.”
“A tree?” said Sherlock, his voice hoarse with lack of use. It was a mere guess based on the strokes that had danced across his back and John couldn’t hold back the smile that spread across his face. Clever man.
It didn’t add up. “Alright, then tell me, mate: what’s wrong?”
It was a frequent occurrence that Sherlock and John needed to pretend to be a couple. John always told himself that it was okay because it was always “for a case.” But the things they did “for a case” left a glorious feeling in the pit of John’s stomach.
“Anyth-
“William Wiggins is not
Then again, the man was staring right back.
A lazy shrug. “That’s it, I suppose.” The words were thin and rang false in John’s ears.
His mind fought tooth-and-nail to prevent the violent onslaught of blame barreling blindly towards the man. The duality of his emotions were ripping him apart into unrecognizable pieces. He hated Sherlock for breaking his vow, but he hated that he put the weight of that blame on the man. The two undeclared affairs he’d pursued while with her were guilt in his stomach, his unspoken resentment toward her was a hated lump in his throat. Yet she had been his wife.
“I surely don’t know what you’re referring to,” said Sherlock too innocently.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows for a moment, clearly racking his brain for the right words. “I don’t always know,” he admitted. “I see what I see and the conclusions come to me rather naturally. Can you tell me why water is wet?”
“Yes.”
Equal parts bewildered and stunned by the abrupt appearance, John could only manage to stutter out, “You have what, exactly?”
John shook his head slowly, the motion conflicting with the eye contact he maintained with Sherlock across that impossibly long intimate moment. “It’s… challenging, you know. It’s hard for me to… tell you how I feel. That is, how I feel the same way toward you.”
The words were a bullet to his unexpecting ears. They were precious syllables he'd waited lifetimes to hear. John’s eyes flew to Sherlock’s, an enormous love filling his heart until he was more than certain that he would explode from it.
A sharp rap against his door pulled him sharply out of his thoughts. The muscles along his neck protested against the speed with which he moved his head toward the door. Two sharp knocks in quick procession- it was Sherlock’s knock.
“Jealous,” teased Greg.
Sherlock took a step closer. “Tell me another.”
Now it's time to see what John was up to during that time. We'll be skipping ahead through the chapter and let's see if you can catch the timestamp references from the other chapters. :)
Find me on Tumblr, if you fancy it:
. Is that all you have to say?”
I suspect he will use the first “shut up” pass when I give it to him and mock his moustache. SH
