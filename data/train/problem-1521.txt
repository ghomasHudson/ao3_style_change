I was in the doorway of my own little attic bedroom without any clear idea of how I had actually made my way up the steep and narrow little staircase.  I had looked into Sherlock Holmes’ eyes, clasped his hand, and essentially declared myself to be hopelessly and irrevocably in love with him -- and I can only suppose that at that point my conscious mind, realizing that it inhabited a gibbering idiot, simply took its leave for a short while until I was out of Holmes’ presence.
Normally, I would have been beside myself at the disastrous revelation that I had just made, but for the moment I found myself distantly surprised at my continued calm.  I vaguely recalled feeling a similar sense of fatalistic composure after I was wounded at Maiwand; the situation was, I reckoned, already as bad as it was likely to get for the time being.  Nothing was to be gained by worrying about it now -- and at any rate, I was nearly prostrate with exhaustion and clearly incapable of coherent thought.
“It’s been a dreadfully long night, and I’m terribly sorry for my part in keeping you awake, old boy.  To tell the truth, I’m absolutely shattered.  As you’ve already deduced, I’ve worked for nearly two straight weeks, and I’m still feeling a bit peaky from my own little bout with the ‘flu.”
I felt him stir against my breast with the first rays of dawn.  His sudden tension told me that for the first time in several days, he was free of the fog of delirium and fully able to understand what was going on around him. I could imagine that after days of illness and confusion, coming at last to awareness in the arms of another man would be rather disconcerting, to say the least.
It was several hours later that I was sweetly awakened by a kiss -- one that quickly turned into something so much more than sweet, and which caused my entire body to awaken fully to the beautiful, passionate man who would always have my heart and soul.  There followed what I consider to be some of the most sacred moments of our time together as we joined together in every possible way. Ours could never be a union sanctioned by church or state, but we sanctified it ourselves, pledging our all to one another.
The next few hours passed in a strange patchwork of jumbled impressions.  Looking back, I can say that I was only occasionally aware of my surroundings throughout the night, though I had the certainty that I was safe wherever I was, as I could sense that Watson was nearby at all times.
I realized with no small relief that I was feeling like myself again, thanks to Watson and his steadfast care.  A moment later, I also realized that the poor man would awaken stiff and miserable if he continued to sleep in such an unnatural position; he needed his own bed and his own rest.
He smiled down at me once more.  “I’m glad you’re better, my boy.  It wouldn’t do at all to have you ill.”
And with that, we both stared at one another wordlessly; I found myself wondering how on earth I was ever going to get myself out of this situation, and I suspect that Holmes’ mind was similarly occupied.
A week was sufficient time for me to do the research necessary to have the blackguard arrested and charged with not only forgery and fraud, but murder – but not, alas, without gaining said blackguard’s rather unfavorable attention.
Up until that night, I suppose I had prided myself on my ability to remain calm and unflappable even in the most terrifying of situations.  I had managed to stand up to any number of armed assailants, and even retained my wits as the Reichenbach torrents tried to batter me into pieces against the unforgiving Alpine rock.
Fortunately for me, my maternal grandmother’s brother had been the painter Horace Vernet, and she had been a gifted painter in her own right.  She had seen a glimmer of talent in me as a child, and undertook to train me extensively in the art of painting and portraiture so as to allow the “family gift,” as she called it, to be passed on to a younger generation.  But again, I digress.
I believe we were both awed into silence at that moment.  We were both so profoundly happy at the knowledge that we were loved, we were wanted, we could truly
But in this moment, I was hopelessly lost in the strong circle of Watson’s arms, sobbing like an imbecile into the fabric of his nightshirt and physically incapable of either responding to him or moving away from him.  I was speechless, breathless, as he confessed that even with the enormity of his loss, he was grateful to have me back with him.
Suddenly, Watson dropped his head down into his hands with a shuddering sigh. I had been silent too long, and he of all people knew the workings of my mind.
But here was the blasted man tucked warmly into my own bed, the honey gold of his hair lying on my pillow, his arms steadfastly clasped around me, his mustache brushing against my ear as his warm voice murmured comforting nonsense to soothe me.
The argument in my head did not sound like Mycroft this time; it sounded very clearly like my own voice.
“I’m not at all certain that I’ll be able to explain this in a way that you can understand, old boy, as I know that you eschew matters of the heart whenever possible.”
I needed to see him.  Watson was alone upstairs, and ill, and I needed to be there.  I was headed to the stairs almost before Stamford was done speaking, but the round-faced doctor clasped my arm with unexpected strength.
He turned me around and propelled me slightly toward my own chair.  “From what I understand, you should be taking some care with yourself this morning.”
“As little as you wish to be deduced, old friend, it is clear that you must be aching for your own bed, and perhaps the warmth of a hot cup of tea or a bit of brandy.”
As I came closer to the river, there was an unholy din behind me – but rather than turn around and slow my escape, I kept going, albeit with flagging speed as my breath was still coming in wheezing gasps after Morty’s attentions to my throat.
I was still trembling despite Watson’s sure grasp and his quiet voice in my ear.  He was gently drying my hair with a towel when I began to relax again, and realized that he was softly singing in much the same calm, reassuring tones he’d used to speak to me moments before.
Neither of us saw fit to discuss that the relationship had been more than simply friendship for years, and that the two of them were clearly devoted to one another.  I had no issue with it at all, as I felt that our nation’s laws against inversion were patently ridiculous – and I was genuinely pleased that my brother had found someone with whom he could share his life.
He had reached over and taken my hand in both of his, much as I had done earlier in the morning.  “I
However, it may end up being 4 chapters long instead of only three?  I'm going to have to see how the rest of the story ends up breaking itself apart.  But yes, yes, to the (non-graphic) slash, and YES to the happy ending.  Promise.
“Get up,” he said shortly.  “Get dressed.  We need to have a talk, and I won’t do it with you in your nightshirt.”  With that, he stood and stalked out of the room.
Had I ever taken the time to consider it, I would have imagined my own return to have been a pale and cold comfort compared to the loss of his wife -- much less, dear God, the loss of his child as well — and yet Watson’s words, his tone, the fierceness of his embrace all told a different story.
Then I could speak no more, and wept bitterly for some minutes before I could resume my story.  Holmes, bless him, waited in absolute silence.
“Of course you do, brother mine,” I replied sardonically.  “Especially since you have, shall we say, a confidential source at Scotland Yard.”
He looked so forthright, so brave, and so very determined in that moment that my heart ached for him. “You needn’t tell me anything that you’d rather not,” I whispered, not trusting my voice.
As it turned out, my illustrious client was so devastated to discover that she was being threatened by her beloved grandson and his unsavory companions from university that not only did she refuse to press charges, but she also forbade me from alerting the police about the attempted extortion.
Like a flash of lightning, realization struck me; it was utterly unthinkable that Watson would have to climb up to his little garret room tonight. I would have none of it, and told him so in no uncertain terms.
“Please, Watson,” I cajoled, “you’ve given me this kind of assistance on more occasions than even I can recall; if I have ever been your friend, my dear boy, let me try to make you more comfortable tonight.”
Our friendship survived such trials as his marriage (granted, more of a trial for me than for Watson), and my three-year absence after my supposed death at the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland.  For Watson’s sake, I was grieved to learn of the (actual) death of his wife during my absence, but I was heartily glad when he eventually agreed to move in with me again in our former lodgings in Baker Street.
Someone was moaning.  It was a piteous, miserable sound, and  would have wakened me even if I had been far more soundly asleep.  I sat up, looking to find the source of the cries, only to find that they had stopped as soon as I had roused from my slumber.
Mycroft rolled his eyes at me as though utterly disgusted with my inability to absorb the obvious.  Fortunately, Lestrade was willing to answer.
I didn’t need to express the rest of that thought to Holmes; Mary and the prospect of our baby had been the only slender threads that had kept me going through my time of mourning after what I had thought was his death.  Mary’s death and the loss of that hope, that future, had left me as truly despondent as I had been at any time in my life.
Within a few minutes, I had indeed dressed and made my way out into the sitting room.  I was not at all surprised to see Lestrade awaiting us there – I was, however, surprised not to see Watson with him.  Then I heard his bedroom door open, and looked to the stairs to greet my friend…
Holmes was still silent, but I had finally composed myself enough to meet his eyes again -- only to be shocked to my very core to see that he, too, was weeping.  I squeezed our joined hands, feeling a sense of brotherhood with him that I had rarely felt with any other man in my life.
Perhaps Watson, with his warm heart and persuasive manner, could have convinced Lady M to change her mind, but Watson had been unable to accompany me into the Midlands due to a frightful epidemic of influenza in London. I had felt his absence keenly during the two weeks I had been away from London; in truth, it seemed that I missed Watson’s calm presence at my side even more these days whenever we had to be apart than I had done during my long absence after the unfortunate events at the Reichenbach Falls. He had returned to 221B Baker Street not long after my return to the land of the living, but on this particular night, knowing he was under my roof and I was not made me even more distressed.
“You knew I was going to be fine, Mycroft.”  I watched his face carefully — frustratingly, his was a countenance that could nearly always elude my powers of deduction if he so wished. “Why are you really here?”
I may have smiled in return, but I was quickly drifting into a place that was dark, and warm, and peaceful, and where all that I could hear were the quiet tones of John Watson’s voice.
My heart ached at the number of times that Watson, in his delirium, was trying to protect me from some unknown menace – and I was unable to convince him that I was safe and by his side.  At length, I crawled into the bed with him and pulled his too-hot body close in my arms – and at that, he finally relaxed and subsided into sleep.  I held him thus long into the night, and I was with him when the dreadful fever broke at last and left him exhausted but peaceful.
I felt his grip on my arm tighten slightly.  “No, friend Watson.  When I returned from my long absence, I knew only that she had passed away the year previous.  I know it had to have been a grievous loss to you.”
Perhaps it was my relief that made me thoughtless, or perhaps it was simple clumsiness – but in the next instant, my foot had caught upon an uneven board, and I went flying.  I was in the Thames, struggling to keep my head above the greasy water, before I could even understand what had happened.
“You had such a look on your face just now,” Holmes said, looking at me with a smile on his lips and inquiry in his eyes. “Whatever was going through your mind?”
“I had great affection and esteem for Mary, as I believe she did for me.  But ours was not a marriage of fervent passion; she was not in love with me, nor was I with her.  She married me because the expectations of polite society and her own financial situation would not allow her to live the independent life she would have preferred.  And I… I married her because I had already lost my heart to someone who could not return my love; it was rapidly becoming an untenable situation for me, and I had to remove myself from the temptation to say or do something that would have been at best humiliating, and at worst illegal.”
“There now, lad,” Watson’s voice was uncharacteristically tender. “Rest easy, now.  You’re safe, here in my hands.  I’ve got you, see?”  Those surgeon’s hands, strong and capable, were gently stroking the wet hair out of my face.  “Dinna fash yourself, lad, always safe here with me.”  I’d never heard Watson’s Scottish burr – though I knew he'd worked hard to train himself out of it during his days at university and in medical school.  I thought, as if from a great distance, that it was actually rather charming.
“I can only beg your forgiveness if I’m wrong, but I felt that perhaps the… the ‘untenable situation’ in which you found yourself before your marriage may have had something to do with… with me.”
I sat up in the bed, reaching to pat one of his hands as it grasped my shoulder.  “Indeed, dear boy, I’m fine,” I said in the heartiest voice I could muster. I was just startled to see you, and probably overreacted.  I’m terribly sorry to have worried you.”
“As you prescribe, Dr. Holmes,” he said with an ironic bow of his head, “I’ll see myself off to bed now.”
I could only sigh, guilt-stricken, in response.  But Watson smiled reassuringly, patted my shoulder through the blanket, and said, “We’ll have you right as rain in a trice, my friend.  That’s what comes of living with your own physician.”
Some minutes later, both men reappeared into the sitting room and walked over to my little nest on the settee.  They were glaring wordlessly at one another, but moved in concert to help me sit up as they began to remove my sodden garments.  I stood, dazed, as they worked silently to strip me nearly bare and guided me toward the steaming bathtub.
Whether it was due to my powers of persuasion or to Watson’s eventual willingness to be persuaded, I managed to insinuate myself back into his embrace while I provided him with all of the myriad reasons that I never wished to let him go.
Moreover, as little as I would have cared to admit it at the time, I had exhausted myself almost to the point of physical collapse after a week with essentially no food or sleep.  (
I thought.  I found myself gazing upon his sleeping face for a long moment, as if to commit him to memory.
I broke away for just long enough to pull him up onto the bed to lie next to me -- not a difficult task, as he came along quite willingly.  He looked nearly transformed, his face glowing with what I supposed to be the same quiet, overwhelming joy that I was feeling.  His shining gray eyes were bright with unshed tears, and I felt for all the world as though my heart would explode from my chest if I could not soon manage to give voice to my own feelings.
I did, of course.  I had to admit to myself that even if he had told me about his concerns at that time, I would likely have dismissed them as fanciful nonsense.  It had never occurred to me that Watson would be so affected.
An oddly detached part of my mind made a note that at a later time, I would need to do some research as to the physiological reactions that were currently making me feel as though my blood had turned to ice and was jangling terrifyingly through my veins.  Watson might know; perhaps I could ask him.
Edward Griffith had quietly taken over a modest London art dealership from the elderly gentleman who had been the original proprietor – and who had not been heard from since then, with Griffith reporting that Mr. Hollingsworth had planned to visit relatives in Scotland.
But I hadn’t asked – indeed, I hadn’t seen Watson in over a week.  A flash of guilt brought home to me that he had no idea where I was unless Lestrade had told him – and that, if the gentleman currently trying to crush my windpipe had his way, my friend might never see me alive again.
Mycroft, particularly, seemed to feel a great deal of indignation toward my treatment of Watson (his favorite descriptive terms being “heartless” and “cavalier”) – but I was not unaware of his sentiments by this time.  He had, as the only other living soul who was aware of my survival, protested most bitterly and with increasing urgency over the course of the last two years of my hiatus that it was “absolutely vital” that Watson be allowed to know that I yet lived.
What he was going to tell me that he wanted remains a mystery to this day, as I was utterly unable to allow him to continue.  I took that beautifully chiseled jaw into the palm of my hand and guided his perfect lips to my own. Not possessing his eloquence, I allowed my kisses to show him that there was nothing he could ever ask for that I would be unwilling to provide.
Finally, Mycroft told me, there came a period of time when he actually feigned an illness in order to ask for John to come and stay with him and oversee his care.  “I had come to fear,” he said quietly, “that Dr. Watson would do some kind of harm to himself.”
“Mary’s doctor is a very forward-thinking man, and had asked me when we first realized that her illness would likely prove fatal whether I would be willing for him to try to rescue the child when Mary had passed.  It was a horrifying, gruesome conversation to have -- but I agreed to the procedure, knowing that Mary would have wanted our baby to have every chance at life even if hers was lost.”
Lestrade was working on a cold case, because suddenly the criminals in England was surprisingly idle, but he rarely ever managed to solve a cold case without Sherlock. He needed his brains, even after two sorrowful years. Flipping through the files he had on that particular case, Anderson came in to tell him that a car was waiting for him outside New Scotland Yard. He was partially bewildered, because he didn't order pizza, he didn't have anything planned for the night, and he certainly didn't have any date even on a last minute notice. But he got up anyway, because he wasn't progressing on the case he had on his hands. He grabbed his coat and left the files on the desk for further reading.
“Why do you say that? Whenever you needed me, I helped you,” then there were a pause. Like a moment of realization.
They had decided that visiting Sherlock in 221B after months of silence would be an appropriate approach. John had worn the engagement ring and brought along a bouquet of flowers as a small token of apology. Usually when he knocked, Sherlock would open the door for him, but that day, it was Mrs. Hudson, who had a shocked and sad expression on her usually vibrant face.
, did you bring along an enemy behind you to come and kidnap me and my daughter for hostage? Because that's your favourite way to be contacted by your enemies, wasn't it?" he hissed every word with seething pain and anger, that it took him a while to realize the tense in Sherlock's body, and the blank stare towards the piece of photograph in his hands that he had gripped hard at the sides as a sign of containing or holding back the hurt and the tears threatening to spill.
"But it's still yours," he hissed back before walking straight in front of the glass wall separating them two, directly opposite of Mycroft. "
Mrs. Hudson daren't come upstairs anymore, only doing so when she wanted to try and coax Sherlock into eating something,
"I'm fine, Sherlock. It's just... I've never done this before and I'm sure you know that straight from deducing me alone," their lips were only a breath away and he can feel the hot breath from between the bowed lips on his when he returned to pleasuring John with his skillful violinist hand, whispering reassurance to take care of him.  Moving his hand faster and tighter around John's shaft, he managed to hear John's breath caught in his throat a few times followed by harmonious moans. His cheeks and his nape were flushed with pink accompanied by his half-lidded eyes showing how much in ecstasy he was and that made Sherlock felt proud and powerful of how his dominant side managed to elict such behavior from this strong man and made him aching for friction on his aching cock.
"Of course. You can have all the food you need," he grinned and held out his hand to John, which John happily accepted and just savour the warmth of the other man in his gentle grip. It was just a simple moment, but it personally felt a lot to it than just a walk in the park. He felt
"Did you really meant what you said?" his voice hitched midway through the sentence, most probably holding back tears (hopefully) of joy. Or it could just be tears of relief.
“In those two years, couldn’t you shown me a sign that you were alive? A call, a text, heck even a note? You could’ve asked me for my help…”
“Because I’m real, Sherlock. Please, just look at me and deduce. I’m real,” he kept Sherlock’s head fixed in a way that his eyes will look at him, and thankfully the blue eyes was moving frantically, deducing his existance. It didn’t take long before Sherlock had made a conclusion, in the form of tears.
“As I was saying, John, the case. I’ve been assigned to investigate a possible terrorist attack and these pictures are all my rats. My markers. If one moves, I’ll know. If she buys another grocery, I’ll know. If he walks his dog, I’ll-”
"Yes, but they're good news. Don't worry," he put down his empty glass of scotch. "We are getting married. Or at least that's what I hoped we could be. I already got a ring but didn't get a chance to propose to her yet".
"Don't try to push me away now, young man. Go and clean up so I can put on fresh bandages on you," she said firmly and put aside the food and cups aside, pulling Sherlock towards the bathroom. She reminded him to just come to the living room straight after for her to try and treat the wounds. Worried as she is, she needed to help because no one seemed to be around to do so. Sherlock complied nevertheless, intentionally taking more time in the shower than he needed to, which was already so long. In addition of taking off the bandage stuck to the wounds and having to be extra cautious with it, it was already taking ages. Mrs. Hudson didn't complain anyway. She spent the time to clean up the flat a bit for being abandoned for too long.
"Apparently so. He had flashes from when we would be running around London together. And he told me that he missed me. This is just... Too much for my brain right now,"
and nobody had any goddamn clue about who did it. This murderer must be a very professional one, highly trained, and good god he needed to be captured quick. Everyone was panicking, and of course everyone went to him, the great Mycroft Holmes who usually solved the government problems, asking him to track down any signs of this assassin. He had sent spies into various gangs and mafias in his knowledge, and none came back with even a speck of lead. This was getting rather interesting. For once in a blue moon, he'd came across a highly intelligent criminal. Dear lord, he felt like his brother trying to catch a criminal on a spree-
" he pressed his lips together and after a few moments, he pulled up his sleeves to show a still-healing carving of the letters 'J' and 'W' with a delicate knife. "
. I am sorry, brother dear, but I am positive that he's not interested in you as much as you think. You're just one of his spare tools,"
"I thought I was supposed to not care about my life," he took a long drag of his cigarette while hugging himself with his free hand.
When he finished settling with himself, he sat back down at the bed and picked up the picture again, only to notice a faded out writing at the back of it that looked like a multiple attempt of rubbing the note away but still readable nevertheless.
"Oh are you?" he stood up from the chair and faced John, looking down at the doctor. At his friend. "Or is this just another unwarranted guilt and misplaced emotion, like what happened last night?"
he couldn’t finish the sentence because the worry he felt had already got stuck in his throat. When the criminal was cuffed and dragged by the Yarders, Sherlock took the ring-John’s ring-along with him while frantically deducing clues to John’s where about, and stopped at a struggle mark, at the very edge of the building. With eyes filled with panic and fear, he slowly looked over the edge of the building and never had he screamed on top of his lungs like that.
After god knows how long he had been unconscious, his eyes finally fluttered open and his senses started to come back one by one, functioning gradually until he could feel the ache all over his body. He finally decided to look around and realized he was on a white bench-like bed (as if the ones in the hospital) in an all-white room, with his own all-white outfit. His previous clothes was neatly folded beside him on the bed and all his weapons,
"Heh. Then, I'll gladly carry you around. Like a princess or a damsel in distress," both of them broke into laughter at this statement. It's always a good moment between them. The warmth and tenderness that only exist between them was something he wouldn't miss out on, and so he vowed to make sure they would work out into a healthy, functioning relationship.
He just needed to find where this next victim was and deal with him, before leaving for the fourth political man, but there's not much he could deduce because there's no indication that this man had any appointment outside of the building. Most probably going to be back soon in the room from the loo or someone's office, so he proceeded to look around for anything at all in this room that would help him remember why this room felt familiar.
But she smelt of hot sex. Her plump breasts brushing against his arm and her dainty fingers delicately moved across his chest was an attempt of arousal, which only worked in his imagination because subconsciously, his hand found its way to his semi-hard cock. When he was about to relief himself, the door to the bathroom clicked open, which cause him to be shocked and instinctively pulled the shower curtain to hide his body, although not his silhouette.
"Because, I would just be a bother. You have Mary now," he sighed. As painful as it is to say it, it's the truth. John looked away for a second, as if punched with a guilty realization.
“Oh… He is brilliant! Hiding poison in ice and administering it in his lover’s drink, truly brilliant!” Sherlock praised aloud on the crime scene. Of course, everyone on scene were making faces of disgust mixed with surprise of how he managed to uncover a poison inside a seemingly transparent ice cube. John, who was following right behind and jotting down each and every detail of interest on his notepad for the report, stopped midway, bewildered at how Sherlock just doesn’t care about what other people were thinking of his bluntness and his amazement for the criminal techniques (which isn’t new) but the woman at the side was terrified. She was the lucky one to stumble across a dead body in a pub that day. A mouth-foaming, blue, body.
. He knew that as the best man, he should've stayed with John until the end of the event, but as per mentioned before, he just couldn't.
OK, so... smut. Obviously. This is the first time I actually written smut in detail and in a story (usually I censor as much as I can and cut it short to save my ass the pain) but here we go then.
John still needed to solve his little problem, but he just couldn't at all focus on the woman's figure anymore. The only thing in his head was only a few steps away from him.
It all started with an innocent puff of smoke, a drag of nicotine after a long streak of staving from it. The wedding night was when he took out the cigarette stick from his coat, having to muster enough energy from it to even step into the flat that's now officially just
“Oh God, John no! Please be okay. SOMEONE BRING MEDICS HERE! PLEASE! Please…” the last word barely came out as he held back his tears while cradling John’s head on his lap, giving a proper position for blood flow.
"PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN! YOU'RE SURROUNDED!" Sherlock swallowed a smart remark to say 'don't bother pointing out the obvious' because it'll somehow set a bomb onto himself at this point. It's embarrassing to be in such situation when he'd been so cautious all these times to successfully escaped the radar of higher authorities. He muttered a curse under his breath, and squinted a bit when he scanned the whole pack to assess how many they were but obviously too many for him to take out in such a small place when crowded.
"Right. You're right, you always are. Which is why I need to know the end of your sentence, so I can tell you if that statement is also right," There's an awkward pause as Sherlock looked at John, almost angry that he had to say it.
It's not the end of the fic ;) but I can't promise you when I'll be able to update. But not too long, hopefully. I'm stuck in preparing for a family holiday/getaway and I'll be back to uni afterwards :')
"Just... Leave me alone. I need to make sense of this," he rubbed his face, hiding it from Mycroft's stare.
“I… I need space. Go home John. It’s almost dark and you need to pick up Rosie. I just need to… think,”
It took him a while to finally understand what the sound was, and when it finally dawned on him, he rushed up and pushed the door open, first to have cold air against his face, and then to notice the window was wide open. He glanced to his side to see the tea was only half drunk, and the crumpled up photograph underneath it with a scrawny and shaky handwriting on it saying 'I'm sorry'.
“He hadn’t been moving much nor talked for so long. Not even eating. Maybe just once for every 5-7 days in very small portions. I’m sorry but he just won’t do anything if he doesn’t want to,” she nodded at John after putting the food tray on the table and left immediately. With a sigh, he placed his hand on top of Sherlock’s which was very cold he had to check for a pulse just in case.
"He's taking a shower. I'm just waiting on him because I needed to change his bandage," she said plainly, but the happy voice still present.
“Because, I should have deduced that our feelings aren’t mutual,” Sherlock frowned for a split second before giving him the softest smile he had ever had the privilege to see.
for him. Him being more fit isn't a problem but he was severely deprived and it showed on his body and his skin. Speaking of which-
"You may be a handful, Sherlock. But you're never, ever, a bother to me, okay? You're still an important piece of my life. I wont just let you slip away dealing with your personal problems by yourself," he gave a small smile which Sherlock responded with a smile of his own. When he saw Sherlock was struggling to find words to reply to this, he slowly pulled Sherlock up, cautious to not irritate his skin, and softly hug him close, trying to reassure him of what he said. Sherlock hid his face in the crook of John's neck and tugged on the back of John's shirt, scared to let go as if doing so would make John disappear. He can't tell John why he was crying. John was already in a happy domestic environment and Sherlock was happy for them. But he supposed, this was at least a good start to repairing what had broke from the night of the wedding.
“Plus, I never said anything about involving Mary in our cases in any way. But by the way you put it, it seemed like you don’t want to be involved with me anymore,” he sighed. He was tired of the pretentious vibe he got from this friendship. Was it still friendship, though? Acquaintance seemed like a more appropriate term.
He was about to complain but sucked his breath instead when he felt Sherlock's tongue on his nipple and his hand on John's now-hard cock. Fuck, Sherlock Holmes had made him rock hard in just mere seconds and now he's pleasuring him in the middle of the bathroom. He kept flicking his tongue from one nipple to the other and slowly moved his way down. John was curious by the lack of contact at first so he looked over only to see Sherlock pulling his pants fully off before looking at John through his eyelashes and wrapped his hand around John's penis. He could only mutter curses at the skill he had at pleasuring him.
"What the shit," Lestrade mumbled under his breath and looked at the scotch, thinking that if such drink was served, then it probably would be a heavy kind of information to be given out. When Mycroft saw the two men in confusion and frustration about being there, he sighed and put the glass back on his table to straighten himself before putting both his elbows on the table, propping his chin on his hands.
"That was... incredible. Not that I expect less of you," John grins once he regained his breath fully. They laid side by side, looking into each other's eyes and amazed of how
"I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I did," he said, resting one hand on John's cheek before kissing him sweetly. "I-I never thought all if this was possible in any way," gesturing randomly when he said it. John was smiling at him tiredly the whole time, but a genuine one, while cleaning up his mess with a tissue from the night stand.
“I need the address, Mycroft,” he was beginning to hyperventilate but managed to calm down meanwhile planning to drop Rosie at the usual babysitter. She doesn’t need any of the negative vibes the rehab give out at this young of an age.
“Oh, I see. Then you really like Janine,” John said while his expression grew serious with every word.
Somehow, just somehow, those little quirky comment from the landlady had brought up a thought in John's mind. A very specific colour, a specific flower, and a specific dressing. He remembered Sherlock once muttered to him about the Victorian flower language. Maybe a small part of Sherlock had hoped John remembered about the short lesson on it, and he did. God he did, and he was utterly glad he did. Mrs. Hudson was a tad confused on the sudden light of realization on John's face, and the immediate action of him going towards Sherlock's handwritten note about the flowers. He flipped through the pages until he saw a scribbly outline of a flower closely resembles the Azalea, and sure enough, the title confirmed it.
Something about that statement hit Holmes in just the right way, I suppose; he was clearly struggling not to laugh, and the sight of his amusement made me burst into rather embarrassing giggles.  Of course, the sound of that was the last straw for my poor darling, and we were shortly convulsed with laughter.  After all of the profound emotion we had been through over the past hours, this release felt absolutely wonderful.
“With all my heart, my dear boy, I thank you for listening to my tale of woe this night.  I can’t begin to tell you what a comfort your friendship is, has always been to me."  He glanced down at our joined hands before releasing mine with a brief, affectionate squeeze.
His poor wife saw the change in him, and knew it for what it was; in her lingering final illness, she had begged Lestrade to look after her John, because “he’ll have lost both of us, now.” It wasn’t an easy task to undertake, he explained, because once Mary passed, “he lived like a man with nothing to live for.”
I had to actually shake myself a bit to bring my full focus back to my friend, who looked somewhat startled by my reaction but kindly chose not to mention it.  Watson looked as though he might have dreaded the conversation ahead as well; he curled up rather miserably as he sat with his knees drawn up almost to his chin, and his head nearly buried between them. I could hear him clearly enough, but his face was completely hidden from me.
In his writings, Watson has given me rather outrageous credit for my gifts of observation and deduction.  Looking back on this period of our lives together, I can only feel ashamed of myself for willfully choosing not to more closely observe this dearest of friends, or for neglecting to deduce how and why his behavior toward me had altered.
I was in Holmes’ room, in his very bed -- and the man himself was perched at the edge of the bed, with such a look of distress upon his face that it was humiliatingly clear that it had been I who was moaning in the night.  I felt the redness creeping into my face, and could only feel some relief that in the dimness of his room, perhaps Holmes would not see my blushes.
No, not silent. The barest rustle of fabric, a quiet indrawn breath drew my attention to our settee, where I could see what appeared to be the form of my dear friend the doctor. As my eyes became more accustomed to the dimness of the room, I was able to see that Watson had not removed his boots or even his greatcoat, but was utterly motionless, stretched fully clothed with his face turned away and buried in two throw pillows.
I kept his medicine in him at regular intervals, put cool compresses on his burning brow and added blankets to his bed when he shivered with chills, trying to reassure him when his fevered imagination made him see things that were not there.
I was sorry that Watson was not there to meet her as well; it was always interesting to me to hear his ideas about our clients, regardless of how misguided they might be.  However, a number of virulent diseases had been making their rounds through the city, and Watson was spending even more time than usual performing duties of
With no small difficulty, I managed not to awaken Watson as I eased him into a dry nightshirt — his own having been drenched with his perspiration as the fever released him.  Joining him again under the covers, I pulled his unresisting body into my arms, relishing the sensation of having him near, and safe, and healing.  At last, I allowed myself to join him in a deep and restorative sleep.
“I most certainly will call upon you in the morning, never doubt it,” he growled.  “And if I can’t talk sense into you, I’ll bring along someone who can.”
He glared at the offhand tone of my response — which, after all, had been my goal.  “Yes, yes, of course, that’s always your recourse, isn’t it?”
“We had chosen names for our child whether it had been a girl or a boy,” I whispered. “Our little son was named Arthur Holmes Watson, after Mary’s late father and the man who would have been his godfather.”
I startled slightly as his palm lit gently onto my forearm.  I followed his line of sight, realizing that he was looking closely at a small, dark splash of blood that I’d failed to wash away after scrubbing myself clean at the end of my last rounds for the evening at Royal London.  I knew the meaning behind this look, and knew just as well that Holmes was deducing my entire miserable day with no more than this tiny bit of evidence.
As my wits slowly returned to me, I realized that the vision next to me was in fact John Watson, asleep in the chair by the window with firelight gilding his face while moonlight limned his fair hair in silvery white light.
He looked up at Stamford, who had been watching these proceedings from the stairs with no small degree of interest.  “What do you think?”
The doctor shook his head sadly. “Lord knows that the fever itself killed more good men than the enemy did, so Watson knows enough to be grateful he was spared.  I’ve given him some quinine, and left more for him to take every four hours until the fever passes.  The worst should be over in the next day or two, and with luck he’s on the mend after that.”
He closed his eyes for just a moment, and when he opened them again, I could swear that I could read his very heart in them. “I want you as all of those things, and as so much more.  I want you as the one who shares my joys and sorrows, the one who knows me sometimes better than I know myself. I want you, John Watson, as the other half of my heart -- because you have had the whole of it for longer than I can tell you.  I want --”
Lestrade alit from the cab first, pulling me out after him with a gentleness that vaguely surprised me.
He gave me a sort of sad smile.  “In truth, my dear boy, you would have -- indeed, you have --  taken me to task most severely if you’d found I’d treated myself in a similar way.”
We bade one another goodnight, and I believe I was asleep again before Watson had made it all the way up the stairs to his own room.
In all our years of close association and friendship, Holmes had never used my Christian name, and I could not imagine why he was doing so now.  I could scarcely breathe for wondering what would come next.
I know Watson feared that my deductive skills would be superior to his powers of concealment; had I been allowed to speak, I could have told him that his fears were for naught. I had no idea whatsoever what he was so afraid to tell me.
But before I could give that another moment’s thought, Lestrade was angrily thrusting his arms into his overcoat in preparation to take his leave.
Others of our mutual acquaintance, such as my brother Mycroft and our friend Lestrade of Scotland Yard, expressed incredulity that Watson would be willing to do this after all that had passed between us; they both felt that Watson had been dreadfully ill-used by my having allowed him to believe me dead for all those years.
The cab had pulled up to 221B Baker Street without my having realized it; the after-effects of my run-in with Griffith’s thugs and my subsequent dip in the Thames had left my powers of observation sadly diminished.
“Holmes?  How are you feeling?”  He was searching my face in the same way I’d seen a hundred times; I referred to it in my own mind as his “diagnosing” look, and I knew myself incapable of deceiving his scrutiny.
He shrugged – and in just that small gesture, I saw hours of weariness. “Part of being a doctor,” he said with forced lightness. “People don’t always become ill at convenient times.”
I began to understand how frustrating it must feel for him to try to persuade me to see to my own care in similar circumstances.
Apologies, even (perhaps especially) those that I know to be the most necessary, do not come easily to me.  Admitting that I had been in the wrong — worse still, admitting that I had failed to observe and understand — was nigh onto impossible, for all that it was also vitally important.  Having my beloved doctor tucked warmly against my heart made it just that little bit easier to begin to tell him all the things he so badly needed to hear.
I came to myself again just as I was being laid down upon the settee in our sitting room and covered with the blanket in which I had previously been wrapped.  I think we were all equally grateful that Mrs. Hudson had been in earlier in the evening to see that there was a fire in the hearth, providing us with both warmth and a bit of light.
I was never more grateful to see Lestrade’s exasperated face before me as he took charge of me, taking my dripping jacket off of my helplessly shivering body and wrapping me up in a rough woolen blanket with more efficiency than tenderness.
It was a trying couple of days – far more so for poor Watson than for me, of course.  I was certainly not the caregiver that he was, but I never left his side as long as he was ill.
I likely sounded rather desperate in my urge to help him, and indeed, I found that I was feeling rather desperate.  Yet I could tell that the doctor was about to turn my offer away, to try to deal with his distress on his own, and it was nearly more than I could bear.
I had left him thinking I was dead – and then I came back blithely expecting him to exclaim in wonder at my ingenious escape.
The door to our flat clicked shut, and I heard Watson whisper, “Oh, for God’s sake, not both of them.”
I placed what I hoped was a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Of course I will not, Watson -- only tell me how I might help you find some relief. Even Scotland Yard would be able to observe that you’ve worked yourself almost to the edge of complete collapse.”
“Even so,” I protested, “you are not the only doctor in London, or even at St. Bartholomew’s.  It is imperative that you get enough rest lest you become ill yourself.”
“He’s not a fool,” Mycroft replied quietly. “He’s… well, he has his own reasons for what he does, and we’re in no position to judge.”
do you propose to be any good to him if you’re…” Lestrade somehow managed to get his point, whatever it was, across to Watson without having been able to finish a sentence, though his furiously whispered utterances left me completely at sea.
I always knew that Holmes was possessed of a great deal of compassion, regardless of how assiduously he attempted to conceal it from the general public.  But his clear and genuine concern nearly unmanned me, and I was dangerously close to tears.
He squeezed my hand in return. “Hush, now, Holmes.  You’ve been through a bit of a shock, and nearly drowned on top of it.  And if I have my guess,” he looked accusingly at my pale face and the dark circles that were doubtless beneath my eyes, “you’ll have been many days without sleep and barely any sustenance.”
I hoped that I was not to be called upon to speak, because that power had temporarily left me. I had to remind myself to inhale.
The young constable who was sent in to fish me out seemed less than pleased to do so, and his displeasure was even more evident when I unintentionally vomited a good deal of river water onto his already soaked boots.
I suppose it goes without saying that ours has never been a conventional friendship, Watson’s and mine.  Quite frankly, I’d never intended to become friends with him at all, and was more than just a bit astonished when our tenure as flatmates lasted longer than the first three months.  (No one had ever tolerated my presence in their living quarters for even that long; even my elder brother, who felt familial affection and obligation toward me, had tossed me out onto the pavement within six weeks.  Not that I blamed him, honestly.)
Stepping out of my slippers and shrugging away my dressing gown, I moved a bit stiffly to climb into my own bed.  Though it was neither as large nor as luxurious as Holmes’ bed, it was cozy and familiar; I was likely most of the way into the embrace of Morpheus before I had managed even to pull up the covers, and was lost to dreamless sleep before my head hit the pillow.
As might be imagined, I have found other ways to show Watson my love for him as well, of course – but those may be slightly too, shall we say,
We had both tried to speak at the same time, and then stopped simultaneously as well.  I was prevented from trying to start again by the utterly novel sensation of Holmes’ long, slender finger laid over my lips.  It was not a fleeting touch; his fingertip remained there for long enough that I had to make a conscious effort to keep from kissing it.
“Stamford?”  I sounded like the veriest idiot, as it was clearly Watson’s colleague Stamford who was closing his medical bag as he walked into the room.  “What is going on?”
“Two things, Sherlock Holmes,” he said in a voice that was slightly hoarse from disuse – but so very welcome to my ears all the same.  “One – I don’t much care for being in your arms without damn well knowing why I’m there.  And two – if I don’t take care of a matter of some urgency immediately, we’ll both regret it.”
“It’s taken me far too long to have you in my arms, John Watson.  You’ll need to accustom yourself to being here, for I won’t be without you any longer.”
I covered my eyes with my free hand, nearly overwhelmed.  “The only thing my son knew in his life was to be held in his father’s arms, and the only sight his eyes ever saw was my face.  He only knew his mama when he was wrapped in a blanket and buried in her arms.”
I was taken by surprise as he stopped, taking my hand with great tenderness in both of his own, and looked at me so seriously and so very kindly with eyes that were the same deep blue as the early morning sky.
As I awakened more fully, I recalled with horror how I had left my friend several hours previously.  God only knew how Holmes had taken my pathetic declaration of love and devotion -- and I could only hope that he would not object to my continuing to live with him under such awkward circumstances.  Not that anything had really changed for me -- I had loved him devotedly for years, after all -- but he had remained safe as long as he hadn’t known. My misery and frustration were vented in a quiet but heartfelt groan as I buried my face into my pillow.
“Best get you home before you catch your death,” he muttered.  “Hell to pay for me if I let anything happen to you.”  He shouted something – I know not what – to his men, then bundled me into a cab that had seemingly materialized out of nowhere.
John Watson — would think to compare himself to a drab little sparrow.  I was ready at that very moment to leap off of my bed, chase down the unmitigated idiot who somehow continued to spurn Watson’s love, and... and demand satisfaction.  Somehow.
I had my own doubts as to the whereabouts of the gentleman in question – and I rather suspected  (correctly, as it later turned out) that Scotland had very little to do with where he might currently be found.  It was at the behest of Mr. Hollingsworth’s niece, Miss Edith Caruthers, that I was investigating Mr. Griffith to begin with.
The worst of the illness had passed for Watson, and may have been less virulent for his having already contracted influenza earlier in the year, but he was still far from entirely well. The creases in his clothing indicated to me that this night was the first time that he had been back to our home at Baker Street since before I had departed for Coventry sixteen days previously.
“We’re just recently engaged,” he blurted out of panic. That had John looking at his fingers to see an unfamiliar ring that matched Sherlock’s.
It wasn't much, but the doctor at least managed to clean the wound, apply every required ointment on it and patch it up with a few medical gauze under a bandage across his torso. But for further care, he would need assistance. Mycroft urged Sherlock to ask for Mrs. Hudson's help, or Lestrade's, because they're the closest and the more open options. And Sherlock just shrugged at the long explanations, mumbling a half-hearted agreement under his breath.
"I'm really not. Look who's talking," he breathlessly chuckled. Having the gorgeous Sherlock Holmes saying that he's a masterpiece seemed out of context. Denying the truth doesn't cause him any harm so he put the fact straight.
"Maybe if you think from a merciful side; you wouldn't have to mourn twice if the situation occurs,"
It was funny, that during the questioning on the supposed victim's home, one lady who claimed to be the victim's roommate, she took the opportunity to flirt with him. Out of all places, she did it in a venue very close to home for the victim in this case. It was unsettling for sure, and maybe she sensed his uneasiness because she gave her number to him. Deep inside, he wanted to call her when people were busy in the yard and maybe run for a bit to meet with the lady but it ended up the flirt was just a trick to divert the attention from her. She was seducing John because she was the culprit herself.
"You still don't understand it, John. I love you, in a romantic way," he put down the pen as if anything linked to John at this point burns to even think about at that moment. He needs to avoid this shameful confession. John cleared his throat, obviously wanting his attention.
gave me the war, and he saved me by doing just that. I owe him some saving too, Mycroft. Now tell us, what are we supposed to do?" John leaned back on his chair and sighed, looking at Mycroft with a tired expression while awaiting a response. A rational one.
labelled him as a machine anyway. He's not supposed to be human. Crying was almost the same as drugs, though. It's a relieve but it also hurts. It's a different kind of high-an empty feeling instead of a drug-addled euphoria.
One of the staff came over to check up on Sherlock, and to bring in some food for him. Upon seeing John inside the room, she spoke up loud enough for him to hear.
I had also never before heard Watson’s singing voice, I realized with vague surprise.  Like the rest of him, it was strong and beautiful, a wonderfully resonant baritone.  The tune was unfamiliar to me, with a Celtic lilt.  I vaguely noted that it was in 6/8 time, and utterly lovely.
That Lestrade was also my colleague and dear friend made the situation easier at times, and more difficult at others.
Presently, I could hear the sounds of the bathtub being filled, and the distant voices of Watson and Lestrade.
Watson looked sharply up at me for a moment before seeming to relax again.  “So I’m told, Holmes – and please don’t think for one moment that you’re the first one to say so.”
Lestrade had begun pacing back and forth as he spoke, becoming more agitated with each sentence.  Finally, Mycroft stopped him with a hand on the shoulder and a long, significant look.
Holmes seemed almost to crumple into himself, releasing my hand before turning away to hide his sudden unwonted show of emotion.  Unwilling to permit this, I put both hands on his shoulders and manhandled him into facing me before I pulled him into my arms and held onto him as tightly as ever I could.
but he set the destruction upon everyone else, himself included. Neither brother had the courtesy to face him to tell him, or at least give him a sort of hint, that he didn't have to cry from grief. It was all for nothing, and swear to god, he never wanted to cry for Sherlock anymore by that time, no matter what the circumstances were. He took the remaining one glass and drank all the alcohol in it in one tilt and slammed it back on the table. He had lost Mycroft in the middle of the conversation with Lestrade, and only managed to hear the last bit of it.
“But god, I can’t ever delete how much I still love you,” he sighed in resignation. As if he was very much tired of this world. John broke the hug and went to take the ring from the silk cloth bedding and knelt beside Sherlock, making him more confused than ever.
Sherlock. His guilty pleasure, as one would put it. He didn’t realize the cab had stopped if it weren’t for the cabbie’s signal; the classic throat clearing. He paid for the ride without asking for a change and went straight to the dimly lit bench before freezing in spot a few meters away. He’s very much nervous, so he decided to scan the surrounding beforehand (though he was sure Sherlock knew he arrived). The exact bench was the one with the dimmest light shone over it and the one with the biggest tree as shelter if it were to rain. The tree seemed… wet. But from that distance plus the lighting he couldn’t make out what was the fluid adorned on the sides of the tree. He carefully made his way towards Sherlock and when he was close enough, he could make out that the fluid on the tree was blood. Fresh blood. Panicked, he moved so he was properly in front of Sherlock and had his suspicion confirmed. The blood was his.
but he just wanted to deal with this alone. This was a very big issue and he have to fix it. He played a very big role into breaking Sherlock. His steps were unusually heavy, indeed, because he was carrying a heavy responsibility along with heavy guilt. He got to the entrance of the building when a woman in white came out to escort him inside. The facility was eerily quiet and full of sorrow. When he asked for Sherlock’s room number, the receptionist’s head instantly looked up and just nodded. She must have recognize him from the papers or something. After a few exchanged words with one of the staff, John was escorted through long corridors and reached a part of the building which was comparatively bigger in size and was clearly more filled with necessary items. She pointed to a direction and just left him to deal with whatever it was that’s waiting.
. But just a friendly reminder, Mycroft; you know damn well that I would gladly risk my life for Sherlock, if it meant to save him. It doesn't matter if I died, with or for him. Nothing mattered more to me than the bond we had. I was a lost, ex-army doctor without any familial relative except for my alcoholic sister and was craving the warzone.
"Sherlock—Jesus what happened?" he rushed to Sherlock's side and knelt before him, taking his head on his lap to try and see if there's much he could do. His pupils were blown wide, unsteady balance, difficulty of breathing paired with chest pain, his body was undeniably high in temperature, he was profusely shaking and his lips were starting to turn purplish blue. God no, fuck no.
Like any rational person, he took his time to process all of what he saw, forming his own conclusion. And yet all the conclusions he made was to give himself a reassuring pat in the back. 'Sherlock's is on a case in other part of London', 'He's spending his nights at Bart's for something', 'Maybe he's in the yard to look over cold cases Lestrade handed over'. All to avoid thinking the worst case scenario. And god knows how long he spent dwelling in his own mind, because he heard the front door closed. First person he thought of that went through that black door was Sherlock. His Sherlock.
Now, before you talk, let me explain that if you knew something about his faked death beforehand, it would have been proven fatal for all of you. That is one reason, the other was that if he had actually died during his undercover mission, you didn't have to suffer twice and mourn in grief more than you already did," after the long explanation, he leaned back into his chair a bit, more relaxed to finally let out the information. He turned his computer towards John and Lestrade, letting them see Sherlock on his bed, just looking up to the blank ceiling.
Sherlock's smile started to go away, but the slight upturn of his lips were still present from the little hope he have left. He can fix this.
Sherlock grunted and turned to his back, tired of playing the game with this man and mumbled under his breath, "Jim would send someone to break me out soon". He turned back to Mycroft and asked about the unsettling familiarity he felt in his office.
"Then those lives can stay behind. I have Mary now. She's here for me, and you never did," John stepped forward slowly, his index finger just pushing at Sherlock's chest. If he were to lose control, he wouldn't give a single damn if his finger pierced the skin and damaged his heart-if he even have one.
His hands literally started to tremble in fear as he secured the ring in his coat pocket before going down the emergency stairs nearby.
"Theoretically, yes. Not that you actually died but yeah," he sat down on a single chair nearby and tried to distract himself by looking around.
“Mrs. Hudson! Rosie!” they immediately hugged Sherlock when they saw the red-rimmed eyes illuminated only by the light of the ambulance and no longer the light of his thrilling persona.
No answer. Not even a nod nor a hum. He glanced at Sherlock’s pale hand on his chest and realized one missing detail that had hit him so hard in the chest. He wasn’t wearing the ring. Glancing around, he noticed the shiny ring placed on top of a folded silk cloth on his bedside table. But it was partially covered by the cloth - as if contemplating whether or not to remember those memorable day of the proposal. Beside the ring was a faced-down picture frame. With much hesitation, John turned the frame over to see the glass of the frame was broken and had bits of dried blood on it - punched it, maybe - and the picture inside was torn apart but with whatever was left of the photo was enough for John to make out what picture it was. It’s a picture of all of them in 221B. A picture of Sherlock, John, Mary and Rosie. It was the only picture they had together, of course he would’ve recognized it. But now it was torn apart, missing a large piece of it and was bloodied, as if reflecting the condition of Sherlock’s heart.
He would want to instinctively run to his bedroom, pretending to be asleep but he's rather weak right then especially after consuming some pills that'll sure induce some sleepiness in him, so he just curled up on John's old chair, resting his head on one of the armrests. He heard the soft creaks of the stairs as who was said to be John, comes nearer to his flat. Once the creaks stopped, that's when he heard John's voice, clear, after a few weeks of absence physically and
"I don't know. But just hear me out, will you? You were gone, and Mary was there for me at my lowest. Everyone helped me moved on, and she was the best thing to ever happened to me," at this point Sherlock just scoffed and about to turned back to his bedroom, feeling like his ears might bleed from hearing all of these. How come Sherlock, even on his lowest point, could still hold onto the feelings for John, strived to come back to him, but John can't? Did he really think Sherlock had it any easier? Every mission, every location, he wished it'd be his last with a bullet through his heart but no. He had John in his mind and struggled to survive.
Like what happened in the hospital, both their reaction was more or less the same. A gasp and a slow whimper. And Sherlock just rolled his eyes at this. Pathetic. The wound looked more prominent now after all the ointments were put. The colour of red more vibrant from it drying, and the outline of every scar and torture is obvious since it was cleaned. A lot of whip marks and also knife tracks. A few cigarette burns and something unmistakenably like a heated metal used to mark meats. The worst part is that most of them are fairly fresh.
was how bad it got. It's only been three weeks since the dreaded day, a.k.a the wedding of the Watsons. Greg said that John still cared about him but to this date, he hadn't bothered to either visit, or even text Sherlock.
"Yeah. From his time away? I haven't seen it but Mycroft said it's bad" she muttered with a slow tongue tick, like of a mother when finding out her child fell off the bike.
had never happened, until that moment. But no need to add fuel to the fire. He pushed afar his arrogant personality to express his concern and hope for what could happen if they do cooperate.
say that about him!" he let his hand fall back to his side, suddenly giving up on trying to reach for the man in front of him. "I left you to save you, but Jim saved
"John, you're so tight and so warm," he grunted before curling his fingers to softly press his prostate, whispering love and reassurance to his ear when John was moaning loudly, desperate to feel Sherlock inside him, especially when he began to add his third finger.
He slouched against the kitchen counter while opening the prescription bottle to see the darkness of the night from between the flapping curtains.
This chapter (and maybe a few more ahead) could be highly frustrating because we're dealing with denial, confusion and misplaced affection of the greatest mind of Britain. It's a mild frustration (or major, however you take it) for most but an entertainment for me, so do keep anticipating for more
, on a daily basis. She was scared for him, worried too, a lot because at this point she was like a biological mother for him. Oh she was scared that at one point, she'd lose him. And truth be told, her fear might come true.
“Then why are you still here, John? If you insist so much at cutting ties with me, then why are you here? I honestly don’t need any more abuse from anyone at this point,” his words may or may not soften John a bit. It could just be an act of pity, but he lowered his voice from the shouting pitch and lightly touched his knees, clarifying what he believed was wrong.
"Yes, I know. I can't believe it. He obviously didn't save him. Look at his state-pale, too skinny,"
“I…I don’t know if you really want to hear about it because the two years of my pretentious death is as sensitive to you as it is to me to be discussed . But if you insist, I will give out what needs must,” John just looked at him with a gaze that clearly reflected the need to know. An intense need and concern for him. With a deep breath, Sherlock tried to explain as much yet as little as possible to him.
to do anything they can to bring back Sherlock from the unfamiliar character that's set upon them. It's unsettling. But they need to get Sherlock back before Moriarty suddenly come barging to to reclaim his prized possession.
He assessed the situation with his brainwashed brother and decided to finally let the cat out of the bag about his fake death to the three person he had saved from Moriarty. The efforts to restore what's left of the old Sherlock started, and frankly, it wasn't the best progress they expected. Sherlock was so fixated on the ideology Moriarty put onto him and sees the people he had loved the most now as his worst enemy.
. That was the last message from him that he had gotten through his earpiece before he went underground. When he came upon the large, obviously heavy high quality door, he realized the door was unlocked and proceeded to eavesdrop for any signs of movement, to which there isn't. He crept into the room slowly to confirm his theory that the room was empty. The unusually familiar room was familiar, and the fact itself made him uneasy but he brushed off the thought because he's only there for work. Not to entertain the thoughts in mind about the place.
really thought you were important, shouldn't he had already broken you out? It's been three days, Sherlock. No rescue team came for you," this could hurt him, but Sherlock needed to know the truth. He was being used.
"Sure. Food will be served normally. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. And I will try to come often to see how you're doing. Goodbye, brother mine," a short speech, but enough as a parting speech. He left the room, leaving Sherlock in the blank white space for him to finally breathe and think properly.
"Why are you even here? If it's to pity me then you can be on your way" he grunted before stepping on the cigarette once its thrown to the floor, now fishing for the keys in his coat pocket.
, disbelief. Time seemed to speed up afterwards, and the whole restaurant was reduced to a loud mess. Half of them are pulling John away from Sherlock that was pushed on the floor, and only a few bothered checking up on Sherlock. Guess a raging moustached man is more priority than the man groaning on the floor out of surpressed pain. None of the discussions that came after went well, anyway. Sherlock first was gifted with a split lip, and now a bloody nose. What went wrong? For Sherlock, it's Mary. For John, it's Sherlock.
“When we parted this morning, you gave me your word you would not ask more of me.”  Those keen silver eyes were dimmed with the beginning sheen of tears. “I am here now to beg you to break your word, John Watson. You gave me a promise I would never have required of you; I want you to ask
If you're reading through this and thinking, "Hey!  What is this, a gen fic?" then please be reassured -- it most certainly is not.
“He’s had a relapse of his fever, he wouldn’t tell anyone, he’s been trying to work through it for two days.  Last night, he was burning up and so ill he could barely stand – and then somehow, God only knows how, he put it all aside to care for you.  And now… now he’s paying for it.  He’s a fool.”
“I know that Uncle David would never have left the business to Griffith of his own volition, Mr. Holmes,” she had told me on a frosty January morning in our rooms on Baker Street.
“Sherlock Holmes,” I murmured, feeling as serious as I’d ever felt in my entire life, “I have been in love with you for so long that I can scarcely imagine feeling any other way.  I hope to spend every day of the rest of our lives showing you the truth of it.” I gave a squeeze to our joined hands. “Sherlock, you can have me with you in every possible way, now and always. I love you.  I’ll love you forever. It’s that simple.”
I hadn’t meant to give voice to any of my observations, but I still felt a stab of guilt that I’d made him feel as though I might. Lord knows how often I’d deduced him rather heartlessly in the past, unfortunately.
“There was another young mother on my ward today, near to her time, and she hadn’t even been ill for a full day before the influenza took her.  I thought to rescue her little one in a way that we’d been unable to save my son, so I operated as quickly as possible to try to save the baby -- but she was dead before I could take her from her mother.  I did my best -- I daresay that no other doctor could have done better in the circumstances -- but it brought back the memories of Mary and our son in a heartrending way.”
“Watson!” he repeated breathlessly, taking me firmly by both shoulders and turning me slightly toward him.  “Watson, you’ve gone pale, are you ill? What can I do? Need I send for someone?” I could not remember ever seeing Holmes so distraught, and even through my profound embarrassment, I was touched by his solicitude.
Now we hear from our dear Doctor Watson, and we learn why he is so distraught by the events of the previous day.
With that, he looked across the room at my brother, who was obviously responsible for the doctor’s presence this morning.  “Send for me if the need arises, of course.”  Then he nodded a brief farewell to all of us, and saw himself out.
The light and shadows in my room had moved across the wall rather significantly by the time I next opened my eyes.  In the first instants of wakefulness, a quick inventory of my own physical condition informed me that though I was still plagued by a host of aches and pains, the fog of bone-deep weariness had begun to lift from my thoughts and I felt slightly more human.
“You’re a fool, Watson, and I won’t have you destroying yourself.  For God’s sake, man, think of yourself for once!”
With the same infinitely sweet, sad smile he’d granted to the bird outside my window, he gave me a nod and silently made his way up the stairs to his own room.
I was able to reach up and grasp my friend’s hand; it was so very warm.  “Watson,” I began, thinking to reassure him of my well-being.
“Mary knew, of course. I couldn’t marry her under false pretenses, and she understood, bless her.  We got on well enough, and she more or less kept me alive in those first few months after… after you were lost.”
It will be a much more pleasant effort, and one of hopefully many years’ undertaking, to express to him all of the love I have for him in return, and to tell him how inexpressibly dear, how utterly vital, he will always be to me.
As badly as I wanted to be a good friend and confidant, I frankly dreaded the nature of any further revelations the night might bring; my much-vaunted composure had already proven to be a terrible disappointment, and any defenses I might have had against Watson were so ineffective as to be nonexistent.
It was a ghastly night in early February – combining cold and damp in the way that only London seems able to achieve – when, as Watson has since put it, things began to get interesting.
Never before had the report of a Webley revolver and cries of “Halt!  Police!” sounded like music to my ears, but those were the sounds that told me that my salvation was near at hand; I turned, still running, to get a better idea of the situation.
“Holmes,” he said presently, “I’m so terribly sorry, for I know that I’ve already caused you pain, but…” He paused, as if trying to find his words, staring straight ahead at the dimly lit window and assiduously avoiding my searching gaze. “But there’s more, Holmes.  I need to tell you the whole of it, there’s simply no other way. I can only hope that you’ll be able to forgive me once you know the truth about it… about me.”
Mycroft tensed immediately at John's reaction and looked down at his hand, staying silent for a few because what John said was right, so he tried to construct a plan forth. Pushing aside the generic cold and arrogant persona, he switched it up with a warmer approach and his eyes was not anymore lack of emotion. It was full of empathy for his dear brother.
“You should be,” John wasn’t expecting that. Sherlock had always been forgiving John and dismissing his apology as something unnecessary without hesitation, but his cold, short, and brusque comment hit John in the chest.
"Y-yes Sherlock. I like it. Fuck I like this. You're-" before he managed to compliment Sherlock on how he was good at this, he arched and released a choked moan when Sherlock pressed their body flushed together and begins to grind on him while his free hand snaked towards his hair and tugged on the short hair he could fit in his fist.
his where about from the information you had already received. Stuck somewhere for a few months; a treatment facility. What kind of facility is it, when you consider the major event that had happened in this time period, Dr Watson?”
“Wait a second… You… You have a girlfriend?” John finally spoke with genuine curiosity in his voice, and hints of surprise in it too.
"What do you want? Say it, Sherlock," he asked while his hand was still efficiently pleasing both of them. Sherlock grabs his face for a sloppy kiss before forming an answer, impatient to go further.
love her. I was about to propose to that woman and make her my wife and you ruined that, you know that?"
With the slam of the door, John slumped into his comfortable chair and Sherlock came out of the kitchen, hair clearly disheveled from raking his fingers through his hair multiple times, while tapping his phone quickly.
“It’s my married life, now, Sherlock! I don’t need any of these to the point that it will somehow drag Mary along to our cases! Plus, you don’t need me anyway. I’m just watching you work from the side,” he sighed after the last word, tired. If the hurt Sherlock felt was showing on his face, John didn’t comment on it or he just didn’t bother seeing it.
"I've been in love, with you," and he still does. He had to phrase and say it carefully, as if it would affect the response he'll get. People would think John would stop, take a pause when the realization kicks in and all is relieved, but not quite. Not every chapter have a good ending.
He took his time replying to Sherlock’s text. That had only made Sherlock more anxious because obviously the next text was well thought out and may be risky.
When his body stopped convulsing and was static on the ground except for soft, shaky breaths, one of the man in the team took out a pair of handcuffs to restrain the now slumped body. Hesitating, they finally decided to take off the mask off his face and when they did, they looked at each other in a mix of pity, confusion and misplaced guilt. No wonder their boss didn't want them to shoot. He recognized him, of course he would. It's his own brother. They confiscated the weapons Sherlock had with him before dragging his limp body out of the building and into a black car to be sent out to a confinement.
"I've done my part. Surely I could go back home, Graham" he replied as a matter of factly, and shamelessly took another long drag in front of Greg, who was one of the people who kept him off of it long ago.
," he whispered in a raspy, captain voice at Sherlock's ear, which resonated down south to his own length. Grunting, he put a trail of wet and dominating kisses down John's neck and licks his throat when his Adam's apple was vibrating from the moans he was holding back all the while he teasingly palms John's erection.
The brain is an unreliable author even for the beholder. It will manipulate your memory, distorting it as long as it's done in an intricate manner. And that's when sometimes, your intuition and your heartfelt instinct comes into play to bring you to the truth.
"I didn't know that it was logical to love someone this much. It's kind of scary," he chuckled before continuing. "But if it's meant to be with you, I'd face that fear,"
Now he was partly convinced that he was just a pitstop for John to distract himself with because of his lonely life. Maybe he was just a tool for John, too. Now that he wasn't experiencing the post-war depression, Sherlock was thrown like a banana peel when he found a decent lady the second he was roaming around like a fully functioning man.
John was unsurprisingly shocked by the fact Sherlock would even raise his voice at him. It was, in a way, how Sherlock wanted him to be. Shocked and horrified.
He pushed the door open slowly and the sight was very dull and kind of sad. Everything was… pale. White. White walls, white floor, white bed, white desk and tables. One of the only vibrant colour in that room was a blood-red apple on the table which seemed to be untouched for at least two days. The other was the dark, silky curls of Sherlock. He was lying on his back on the bed just… staring at the empty ceiling. He himself was as pale as the white clothes he was wearing. The short sleeved top had emphasized his now-thin figure and even his pants seemed baggy. He approached Sherlock slowly and when he was close enough he could see the continuous marks on the crook of his hands that had proved his recent drug abuse. He took the chair on the desk and brought it next to Sherlock’s bed and just sat down, studying his expression. He was empty. As if he was actually lifeless. He tried to reach out to take his hand but stopped midway, afraid if it would startle him.
"I... actually I found someone," he looked at Lestrade with a bashful expression. Lestrade was clearly surprised by this. He would had expected John couldn't move on from Sherlock's 'death' at all, but apparently he was wrong.
“I hope so, honestly. But even if doesn’t change whatever it is now between us, I just want you to know what I had felt all these years and had been too much of a coward to admit to it,”
"Will he be back soon?" and the conversation was left with silence in the air. All Mrs. Hudson had to offer was a shrug and a headshake. She had no clue either. And all that
“As you might imagine, our son did not long survive after the doctor removed him from his mother’s body.”  I felt hot tears begin to fall, and for once I was unashamed of them.  “He was a bonny little boy, Holmes, and I got to hold him for the few minutes that he lived.”
With that, he placed his hands on the armrests of the chair and eased himself, groaning, to a standing position.
