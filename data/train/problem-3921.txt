. This was suddenly a different game they were playing… a very dangerous one. Dean’s breath caught in his throat as he returned the stare, and put his bottle down on the table before he dropped it.
But he didn’t move away, so Dean lowered the back of the shirt and pulled first one wing, then the other, through the holes. They felt amazing - Dean couldn’t deny that - silky smooth and delicate, and not like anything he’d felt before. As earlier, when Dean had touched them as he wrapped Angel in the coat, he gasped at every touch, but yet he barely moved. Even though Dean sensed that what Angel really wanted to do was run, it felt like he was exercising control over himself… holding himself back.
Dean slowly got to his feet, and yelled at the creature, hoping this would scare it off. Unfortunately, it wasn’t scared - instead it charged at him, so-o-o... not friendly then - and the yelling had made Dean’s head hurt even more. He put his hand to his temple, in the vain hope that this action would stop the pain, but of course, it didn’t. The dragon ran at him again and breathed fire - which thankfully missed him - and as it did so, he became aware of voices chanting from somewhere above him. Looking up, he saw a whole bunch of his attackers, standing on the edge of a cliff, jumping up and down and waving their arms in the air, as they repeated one word over and over; “Lupir. Lupir.”
Gabriel huffed a laugh, and stared at Cas again. “So, where’s he been? What happened to him? We’d almost given up hope of seeing him again.”
But what if Cas said yes to Claire because Dean didn’t ask him to stay? Maybe he was waiting for Dean to give him a clue.
Castiel’s first encounter with Dean hadn’t been quite as welcoming as he’d hoped; in fact, although Dean had agreed to help, he’d been almost dismissive. The second time, however, had been very different. Dean still seemed dismissive, and disinterested towards the other angels, but with Castiel, Dean was attentive and friendly, and Castiel began to wonder if Dean was interested in him sexually.
“We can bring you back, Dean,” Ed said, excitedly. “It won’t be the same location, but it will be on earth.”
Angel found his lips again, kissing him as if he couldn’t get enough of the taste and the feel of them. Dean hooked his leg over Angel’s thighs, and he fell asleep like that, sated and content.
As they wound their arms around each other, and their hands tangled in each other’s hair, Dean had a feeling that he had finally won something, and it was pretty significant.
After a brief hesitation, there was a collective, “Oh,” as they realized what was required of them, and joined Dean at the table.
“I asked him if he’d be okay with me showing him how to sign, and he indicated that he would,” she explained. “If it’s okay with you?” she then added.
The feeling of being held in Cas’s strong arms while they flew over the city was incredible, and Dean was so wrapped up in it that he missed Cas bypassing their building, and instead landing them in the alleyway where they’d first met.
Eileen arrived soon afterwards, and they went over the signs she’d shown them in their first lesson, before she taught them some more. They learned words like ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘okay’, ‘goodbye’, ‘cat’, ‘dog’, and the numbers one to ten, repeating them over and over, and in different orders.
“I know it’s a lot to ask, but Sam can’t find out. He’ll have to report us, and that’s not fair; Angel’s the victim here.”
“Ed, I remember you. From the convention, right? You asked all those little technical questions about the EMF meter, and I was a little short with you.”
If he wasn’t worried about the inevitable bad PR that would arise from an altercation with these ‘fans’, Dean would burst out of the stall and tell these douchebags to shut their pie holes.
Dean could tell that Gabriel was the kind of guy who preferred to be lighthearted and jokey - he’d even said as much when they were outside - but despite the smile on his face at seeing his long-lost brother, he couldn’t stop his lip from trembling as the tears started falling. The smile morphed into something else, and his features seemed to be battling between sorrow and joy.
When Eileen joined in, Dean laughed and let go of his brother. “So what happens now? You gonna go back and arrest the sonovabitch?” he asked as they took their seats once again.
For Dean, he realised that the more Angel took charge, the more he liked it. On the third day of their sexual relationship, when Angel pinned Dean’s arms to the bed and fucked him fast and unrelenting, Dean came so hard he thought he might black out.
this was nice. Dean trailed his fingers up and down Blue Eyes' bicep, as he practically melted into him. He could feel the other guy's breath on his neck, and his resolve to leave began to weaken by the second.
Thinking about the way Angel moved those elegant hands over the controller suddenly gave Dean an idea. The whole writing thing hadn’t worked out, and it didn’t look like Angel was going to start talking anytime soon, but what about sign language?
"Also, he's gonna get fed up with me pretty quickly if the only face he sees is this one.” Dean pointed to his face and grimaced. “And yours is much prettier than mine." Dean laughed at his own joke, but Angel didn't seem to find that funny. He frowned at Dean, and shook his head, before signing 'no, you beautiful'.
“Before we travel to Heaven, please let me know if you have any requirements. Weapons, documents, personnel,” Inias continued eagerly.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times, and Eileen patted him on the shoulder in a consoling manner.
“Apparently not. You know, you should get that looked at. Yeah,” he laughed unconvincingly, as he flicked at one of Crowley’s prosthetic horns.
Disregarding her message as irrelevant, Dean spoke over her, saying to his fellow cast members, “Listen.”
Angel looked surprised, but he opened them out again, and Dean reached out to touch them once more. Angel made a kind of purring sound, and trembled violently.
Feeling emboldened by the enthusiastic reaction they were receiving, Dean broke off the kiss and walked to the front of the stage with Cas, raising their joined hands in triumph.
“You know, evidently we had a little miscommunication regarding the... hunt? You didn't show up?” Ed said, his words trailing off, as Dean walked away without a single word.
Dean took a deep breath, before speaking. “Okay, I hope this isn’t gonna piss you off, but yesterday you said you had other family, and… I decided to search for them. I found them, Cas. Gabriel and Claire.”
Crowley attempted to take control of the situation, by taking up his radio, and declaring, “Jo’s no good, Dean. You're just gonna have to kill it.”
The cars on the screen were ready to go, and for the next hour or so they raced each other - and the other cars - around the track, over and over. As always, it was great fun, and Dean found himself laughing out loud more than once. To Dean’s great disappointment, Angel didn’t laugh again, but Dean could tell how much he was enjoying it from the shy little smiles he kept shooting at him.
As the figures approached them, they suddenly shrunk and took on the form of human males, and thankfully the dreadful noise ceased.
But while Dean might like the ladies - and the men - he was no creep. He’d gotten Jo’s message loud and clear, and was going to back off. Suddenly realizing that, although Jo had left, the women cosplaying Beth were still standing behind him, and were probably watching to see how he would react, he turned to face them with a half-hearted smile. They all giggled at him, and he belatedly realised that he’d been foolish for thinking Jo might be interested in him.
Crowley rolled his eyes in a manner that would have befitted Sam Winchester himself, or his alter ego, Sam Wesson.
The sheer numbers of their pursuers had Dean beginning to panic, and as he started to run towards the rift with Sam, Crowley and Bobby following hot on his heels, it felt like all hell was breaking loose. “Hurry!” he urged.
“I didn’t just find Castiel’s name in those burned documents. There was paperwork showing that one of Chuck’s ‘angels’ is a violent criminal. It was pretty gruesome stuff… we-”
“Not your fault, Sammy. We’re gonna find him… We have to.” Dean needed to believe that, because the alternative was unacceptable. Using the remote control, he turned his screen on, and opened a map of the town. “I left the market at about eleven thirty, and I was walking for about ten minutes when they grabbed me… here.” Dean zoomed in on the exact spot he was attacked.
In hindsight, Dean realised that was quite a stupid question. Angel took his hand and tugged him towards the bedroom, with a devilish glint in his eye.
Cas looked the opposite of pissed off, in fact, he was positively beaming. He leaned into Dean’s personal space, and tapped the computer before signing, ‘show me’.
Ignoring Dean as if he hadn’t spoken, Naomi issued a chilling instruction to Cas. “Emmanuel, you're ready. Kill him.”
Again, there was no reaction, so Dean went ahead and peeled the wet coat away from Angel’s torso. He began his examination of the injuries as tenderly as he possibly could, noting with interest that Angel seemed to be keeping his wings tucked beneath him, almost as if he was trying to hide them. He also became hyper aware of how the guy stared at him the entire time.
Before Samandriel could do anything about Dean’s request, another one of the angels, who was holding a book of spells and magic, interrupted, exclaiming, “We'll have communication in five seconds, sir. Should we wait?”
Before Dean could get a better look, he noticed the guy glance past his shoulder, and then he was grabbed from behind and his arms were pinned to his side. He attempted to wriggle free, but the guy behind him dragged him into the nearest alleyway, the asshole who’d waylaid him following after.
A demon from Dean’s past appears - AZAZEL. Dean is startled, he stumbles back and reaches for the “special” toolbox he keeps some of his higher grade weapons. He manages to brandish a long, silver blade and lunges forward. When his attempt is easily ducked, Azazel grabs Dean by the throat and slams him against the wall. Just as Dean is about to pass out from the lack of oxygen, his previously deceased friend, SAM barges into the garage.
Ash nudged Bobby out of the way, and offered a solution of his own. “I know! You construct a weapon. Look around you. Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?”
Dean leaned forward and wrapped the coat around Angel as best he could, noting that every time he so much as touched the wings he would let out a gasp. Dean figured they must be super sensitive, and he did his best to not touch them again. When he was satisfied that he’d covered him sufficiently, he opened the door once more and all but dragged Angel out of the car.
Dean had realised that, despite no longer feeling scared to speak, Cas still found it hard sometimes, so he'd placed a notebook and pen by the bed. Cas reached over to pick it up, and wrote something down, then handed it to Dean.
When Crowley and Balthazar reached the garrison, they were greeted with an unpleasant sight. The constant flickering of the remaining angels’ vessels suggested to Crowley that they were experiencing the same problem as Balthazar. A number of them had fallen to the floor, and Crowley could see the light going out in their eyes, as if their grace was draining out of them as Heaven powered down. It was only a matter of time before it was too late for them... and Balthazar too.
Turning to his crew, he implored, “Is this amazing? They want me back, and I want you guys to go with me, please. Don't even think about it. Let's go.”
Dean had no idea what game Blue Eyes was playing, but he went with it, lightly caressing him on the arm. “Yeah, earth. I need to get back to earth.”
“There was a room in the basement, containing evidence of… of experiments. It was gruesome… body parts in jars, photographs of his work. Syringes, chains and handcuffs...” Sam glanced at Angel and looked quite sick all of a sudden, and Dean rushed to the kitchen to get him a glass of water.
“I mean, this is unreal,” Sam said in exasperation as he gestured in the direction of the stage. “They’re gonna start eating each other out there.”
“The show must go on,” Dean replied, knowing that Crowley would never be able to resist that barefaced attempt at manipulation.
Angel’s face fell, and Dean couldn’t help but wonder if it was because he was still anxious, or if it was because he wanted Dean in there with him for a very different reason. He nodded and spelled out ‘yes’ with his fingers, nevertheless, and made straight for the bathroom, while Dean got on with making them some breakfast.
Dean saw a rush of electricity shoot through the guy's wings and was about to comment, when the brick wall rushed forward and smacked him in the face. He just had time to register that the world was going blurry, before everything went black.
Angel smiled at this, and Dean couldn't help smiling back. He gently lifted his hand to Angel's chin, and with the lightest of touches, turned Angel's head. The graze was completely gone, but it drew his attention to how much stubble the guy had. Unless he was intending to grow a beard, he badly needed a shave.
Dean knew that they had to put this incident out of their minds, as they had a mission to complete. However, everyone but Dean was currently running away in a blind panic.
“Rifts,” Jo repeated, already making her way out of the room, with Hannah in tow. If anyone could do this, it was Jo, especially after her heroics earlier.
Sam stared at Angel again, taking in everything about his appearance, until eventually slapping his hands on his thighs decisively, before getting to his feet.
“No,” Cas replied, and Dean was suddenly confused as all hell about what they were doing up there. If they jumped, they would be injured a lot more severely than Cas had been when Dean first found him. This would kill them… surely?
A commotion from Ed, on the other end of the angel radio, was followed by an incantation, then everything went blurry as time was reset.
The guy was seemingly undeterred despite the underwhelming reception they gave him. Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a bunch of glossy photographs of himself, and asked, “Listen, maybe I could sit in and sign a couple of autographs?”
Loki ignored Dean’s protests, the hold Loki’s men had on him stopping him from moving, as the god mercilessly cut into Castiel’s neck with the blade, causing him to cry out in pain, a sliver of grace bleeding from the wound.
"Morning, sunshine," Dean said, then felt his face colouring with embarrassment at how easily that term of endearment tumbled out of his mouth.
"How about that game? The other one I was gonna show you?" Dean hoped that Angel would appreciate the subject change.
The graphics appeared on the screen, and Dean began to explain, “It’s a racing game, retro… you know, with old-style cars. You pick the one you want, customise it, and then we race around the track.” None of the cars in this game were actually racing cars, it was more about nostalgia than anything else, which was why Dean loved it.
Before Dean had a chance to ask, Castiel got to his feet shakily, imploring, “Help me save the other angels,” still not giving any indication of whether he was willing to forgive Dean or not.
As Sam waited behind Bobby to get into the minivan they’d been escorted in, he saw the fury on Crowley and Jo’s faces. Dean had really done it now, and although a part of him had wanted to stay and reason with his brother, a bigger part of him knew he had to walk away until Dean was sober and thinking clearly.
Crowley could see the bastard who’d delivered the fatal blow running away, and he became infused with a determination to kill him. He picked up Balthazar’s angel blade and set off in hot pursuit, a righteous anger boiling up inside him. Rounding a corner, he spotted the fucker up ahead, and he sped up and launched himself at his quarry, yelling furiously.
“I really would like to get my hands on him,” Gabriel growled, and Claire looked up from where she was playing with Colonel.
Castiel tilted his head and shot Dean a puzzled look. “I don’t understand that reference. But I believe that Fergus is right; together we can defeat Loki.”
That was a shitty thing to say, and Dean knew it was totally not true. They were a happy family, who enjoyed spending time together, weren’t they? Despite wanting to believe this, that nagging little voice was there again, telling him that these asshats were correct.
Colonel was waiting patiently beside the makeshift bed, and as Dean held his hand out, the dog’s tail began to wag in greeting. “Hey, little buddy,” he patted Colonel’s head, and Colonel stuck his tongue out and panted. “Sorry for sending you to bed like that last night. It was an emergency.”
“Sure, they're cute now, but in a second, they're gonna get mean. They're gonna get ugly somehow, then there's gonna be a million more of them,” Ash said, cringing.
“Cas?” Dean watched him, awestruck, wondering if Cas had been pretending all along, or if Dean’s words had snapped him out of the effects of the stuff they injected him with.
Dean could feel his face heating up as his cheeks coloured, and interestingly, Blue Eyes was blushing too.
When the coat Benny had adapted was finally delivered, they looked on raptly as Benny demonstrated how it would work. As well as making the same slits in the back as he’d done with the shirts, he’d attached some pieces of fabric in the same colour as the coat, and the exact shape of Angel’s wings.
did that mean he had wings? Dean really wanted to find out; he just hoped he would get to see him again.
The swirling, and disorienting brightness of the portal consumed Dean, before he stepped back on earth once more, into a place that looked surprisingly like a backstage area. He saw Bobby peek his head around the huge curtain that separated them from the stage, and suddenly an excited voice announced,
Crowley snarled and tried to punch Ash in the arm, as Sam watched on helplessly. How the fuck were they going to get Dean out of there?
Dean seemed to be making a habit of waking up on the floor with his head feeling like he’d been hit with a rock. Only this time it wasn’t alcohol induced; he had actually been hit with a rock. And... something was licking him.
“Damn, that’s rough. I hope you find a way you can tell him, especially since Eileen already knows.”
Dean shook his head, took Angel's hand in his, and brought it to his mouth to gently kiss the knuckles. "I'm not upset. It’s just… you spoke, and I wasn’t expecting it, and…
Any further words, however, were abruptly swallowed by Castiel’s mouth, as it collided with Dean’s. Castiel pressed him into the wall, and held Dean’s face as their lips instantly started moving together in a beautiful rhythm. They were every bit as delicious as they looked, and his tongue was eager to explore Dean’s mouth.
He was met with a sea of blue, gazing at him. Angel leaned forward and kissed the tip of his nose, then his left eyelid, and the right.
Once the drone had delivered the order to the collection hatch outside Dean’s apartment, he stopped work for the day and brought the shopping inside to put away. Angel moved away from the window and hovered by the kitchen door, until Dean turned and smiled at him. “You wanna make yourself useful?”
Dean immediately started trying to soothe him. "I'm really sorry, but if I don’t do this it won’t set right." He stroked his hand over the skin of Angel’s upper arm in a calming gesture; a gesture that seemed to confuse Angel. It was almost as if he expected the pain, but not the comfort, so Dean made sure to give it to him in spades, humming softly and touching gently as he worked.
Dean was in Heaven, for real? Those people he’d spent the day with were honest-to-god angels? Blue Eyes was an angel, and he seemed so otherworldly because that's exactly what he was!
“You know that makes you the best dad in the world, don’t you? I’m not sure many men would step up to the plate like that.”
“Well, if you’re happy, and you’re sure Dean will treat you right, then that’s okay with me... us,” Gabriel conceded, offering a tentative smile to Cas, then Dean.
“You don’t know?” This was suddenly the closest they had gotten to the question of whether Angel knew who he was, and now that they had broached the subject, Dean needed confirmation.
Blue Eyes made a gesture to Inias, who reached into a compartment on the inside of the car door. He pulled out a can of Coke and handed it to the woman, who then passed it to Dean.
“I won’t hurt Dean,” Cas growled, as Naomi fell to the floor, stunned, and he hit her again. She stopped moving, and Cas stared at his hands as if he was shocked at his own strength.
Flicking it off and laying it back on the tray, Dean shot Angel a look which he hoped conveyed his regret for what was about to happen. "You must be damn sick of me apologising then hurting you, so I'm gonna shut my mouth now, and get this over with. It is gonna hurt, but I'll be as quick as I can be, okay?"
“I want you and Hannah to look for any rifts that have been opened recently. See if we can’t bring back some of the missing angels.”
“The Divinity Den,” Castiel explained. “The hand of god, of course. And as we continue,” he said, leading them through yet another hallway, “the medical quarters are to the left. We’ve gone to some trouble creating a cure to counteract the bite of a werewolf.”
The group hurried through the warehouse, and out to the other side of the building, finding the female angel from earlier standing in what appeared to be a children’s playground.
Dean staggered slightly, and interrupted her spiel. He had no desire to hear the story they’d concocted yet again. “I got most of this in the car. Loki is the bad guy, right?” Dean set off through the hallways towards the Hunter Hub, with his female companion trying to catch up with him.
“We’ve enjoyed preparing many of your esoteric dishes,” Castiel said, with enthusiasm. “Your Elvis burger is a current favorite of the adventurous.”
“You can’t call him, anyway. He hasn’t got a computer,” Dean laughed, putting on a brave face to conceal how scared he really was.
was Cas the violent criminal? Dean didn’t want to even consider that possibility, and yet… how did Jimmy die, anyway? Dean realised that he'd never actually been told.
Angel stood staring at the water, as if willing it to disappear, and Dean wasn't even sure if he'd registered him saying that he would keep his clothes on. He stepped in front of Angel, and made sure to get his attention.
Dean smiled at the blank screen, then went back through to the kitchen to see how Angel was getting on. It seemed he’d timed it perfectly, as Angel was just putting the food on the plates. It was nothing extraordinary; just bacon and eggs, but the look of pleasure on Angel’s face as he glanced up at Dean and smiled was breathtaking.
As Dean moved to stand, however, something underneath the guy’s prone form caught his eye. It looked like… no, it couldn't be, could it? He crouched back down and reached his hand out to feel it.
Dean facepalmed and rolled his eyes, before following Eileen inside. How could he have not noticed what he was wearing?
Unfortunately for him, the young man was not getting the hint. “Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering what technique you used. Did you use any other parts-”
Sam shot him a serious bitchface, which Dean was certain summed up everyone’s feelings towards Crowley’s negativity. It was bad enough with Ash having a meltdown, without Crowley’s bad attitude as well. They were going to have to have a serious conversation when they returned home, but for now they had something more important to do.
“Listen, I'll go back out and create a distraction. I got this.” Ash waved his angel blade around, displaying a distinct lack of skill or dexterity. “I'm okay, I might be able to hold them back long enough, until Dean and Castiel restore the power.”
Angel nodded, his cheeks slightly puffed out with the amount of food in his mouth. Dean took a sip of his coffee, then ate the rest of his food contentedly. This was definitely a good choice.
"What did you think of the game?" he asked, in an attempt to distract himself. "Did you kick its butt?"
Dean had hoped to avoid this, but he realized now that the only chance they had of survival was to tell Loki the truth about their identities; that they weren’t really hunters. He could only pray that Castiel would forgive him. “I'm not Dean Smith.”
At first it was kind of disconcerting, but eventually Dean managed to concentrate on his work enough to almost forget that the other guy was there. Not that he wanted to forget about this alluringly mysterious creature who had fallen into his path - not for one second - but if he didn’t carry on with his normal everyday life, what were they going to do? A conversation was out of the question… sit and stare at each other? That would get awkward real fast.
Angel kept his head on Dean’s chest and nodded, his breathing gradually evening out as they both drifted off to sleep again.
Angel was practically twitching with excitement, and Dean could understand why; he’d been stuck inside for weeks now - and possibly a lot longer than that with his torturer - and now he was going to get some fresh air. Dean was also looking forward to it, as he realised that since Angel had come to stay, he’d hardly stepped outside either.
Dean passed the dice to Cas to get the game started, and after they had all rolled once, it was determined that Eileen would go first. Once the game got going properly, Dean focused all his attention on beating Sam. In the past, whenever they’d played games Sam had always won, and Dean was determined that this time he would be the winner.
Angel seemed to like the thought of helping, and once he was in the kitchen, he threw himself into the task. There was very little room to manoeuvre with them both in the room, so Dean passed Angel the items, and told him the correct place to put each one.
With a feeling of relief, Sam picked up the giant demon knife replica, and cut the ribbon, as a handful of balloons were released into the air. In the background he could hear Ash saying,
Dean was still smarting from the ‘old man’ comment, but he didn’t react to it. “He’s got wings,” he blurted out, stopping Claire in her tracks.
Castiel might have been extremely old, but until a few years ago he’d never had much interest in humanity; he’d always left that to other angels who didn’t have a garrison to command.
It was a nice day for the time of year, and Dean decided he would walk rather than drive. He’d spent way too much time cooped up inside lately, and besides, he wasn’t exactly in a hurry. Also, Cas, Gabriel, and Claire would appreciate this time together; Dean was certain of that.
Now that the police were involved in the case, Dean realised he wasn’t going to get to kill Chuck like he wanted, but he could assist Sam with one small aspect of it, at least. Getting up and going to the kitchen, he said, “I think I can help you with that language you don’t recognise.” He found the piece of paper he was looking for, then brought it back to the living room and placed it on the table. "This it?”
Dean caught the eyes of Ed and Harry, and he saluted them solemnly. The smiles on their faces were a great reward, and Dean felt truly humbled by these exceptional young men.
“You’re not a vigilante, Dean. And anyway, it’s about time you brought Sam into the loop, and explained why you haven’t spoken to him for weeks. I told him you met someone, but that excuse is wearing thin, especially since he thinks I met that someone before he did.”
“That sounds great. We’ll talk about you behind your back.” Gabriel gave Dean a wink and a grin, and Dean laughed. He couldn’t help but like this guy, and his quirky sense of humour.
Setting off again, Dean continued searching through the seemingly endless hallways, with the ‘angels’ accompanying him on his quest.
“You want me to turn him off?” he asked. “If he’s making you uncomfortable, or…” he trailed off, wondering if the very obvious mechanical appearance of his ‘dog’ was freaking Angel out. It would be perfectly understandable, given the circumstances.
Dean had considered that, but he’d seen no evidence of any injury that indicated head trauma. He was convinced that the memory loss was as a result of something Chuck had done. “Nah, it’s something else. I’m sure of it.”
“You were abducted by Chuck, and he called Gabriel using your device, to tell Castiel that if he came back, you wouldn’t be hurt.”
He found himself face to face with a very angry looking Crowley, who immediately launched into a verbal attack. “Do you know what time it is? Why do you even bother to show up at all?”
Cas nodded and smiled, then tapped the computer again, as if to say ‘get on with it’. Dean chuckled, then typed out another message.
“There, that’s better,” Dean said with a smile, as he finished drying his hands and got up off the floor stiffly after so much kneeling.
Dean couldn’t stop staring as the guy signed to Eileen. He understood enough to catch that the guy was apologising for being late, and that was because Claire only agreed to go if he wore a costume too.
It started as an appreciative murmur, for Loki’s impressive ‘special effects’, but this quickly turned into a chorus of boos, as Loki pulled out an angel blade. The crowd were treating him like a pantomime villain, waiting for Dean, or one of the other hunters to deal with him.
He got a sterile wipe from his first aid supplies, then picked up a small pair of scissors, which he scalded with boiling water. Despite the fact that the wound appeared to be healed, it was better to be safe than sorry.
“Hey, hey… you don’t have to do that. If you really wanted to, I’d be totally on board… you know that. But I can tell you’re not in it for the right reason.”
Despite this display of bravado, however, it was clear for everyone to see that Loki’s words weren’t quite ringing true. He might be talking a big game, but there was fear in his eyes.
As he walked along the sidewalk, looking forward to getting back to his boyfriend, someone bumped into him, knocking the box he was carrying out of his arms.
Dean thought, as they went through the sequence a second time. His idea with the samulet better damn well work after this.
“Well, Crowley, at least you had a part. At least you had a character people loved,” Sam implored as Crowley sat down in the chair next to him.
Cas was staring straight ahead, and for a few moments it appeared almost as if he was in a catatonic state. His eyes were fixed on an invisible spot, and even when Dean waved his hand in front of him, there was no reaction. Then, just as Dean was starting to worry that this whole experience had been too much for him, Cas snapped out of it.
That was a very good question; why was Angel not upset by the name? Dean knew very little about what Angel had suffered, but what with the wings and the Enochian, the evidence was pointing towards it being connected with angels in some way.
Eileen looked horrified at learning this upsetting part of the story, then quickly schooled her features before saying, “Got it."
Dean thanked every deity in existence for the heavy rain that was keeping most people off the streets. Angel’s wings opened out behind him, and Dean felt it was lucky that they weren’t any bigger, because if they had been they would surely be dragging on the ground. He regretted not having put his coat over Angel - to cover the wings and keep him from freezing, but at this point it would be easier to just carry on toward their destination.
Eventually, Dean sensed that Angel had fallen back to sleep, and he stood back up and tiptoed out of the room.
Angel didn't react; his startled gaze was fixed on Eileen waiting in the kitchen, who in turn was staring right back at him.
“D-Dean,” Cas groaned. “I’m…” His eyes shone a brilliant blue, and his orgasm shuddered through him, coating the inside of his underwear.
Silently willing the excitable angel to not say anything more until his brother was safe, Sam ordered, “Stand back, Dean.”
The angels laughed in unison, as if that was the most ridiculous question they’d ever heard. Castiel explained, “I don't believe there is an angel here who does not.”
Thankfully, Sam jumped in before Dean completely lost it with the guy. He always did seem to know the right thing to say.
Gabriel looked far from happy about it, though; in fact, he looked decidedly pissed. “Castiel, what’s going on between you and Dean? Did he take advantage of you?” Then, without giving Cas a chance to respond, he turned to Dean and asked, “Did you take advantage of my brother?”
Dean’s climax hit him suddenly, as his body shook and his come spilled over Angel’s hand. Angel held him up with an awesome display of strength, and didn’t let up with the stroking, until he came too. As had happened last night, the glowing intensified the closer he got to his orgasm, and his wings flared out behind him.
After Eileen had gone, with a promise to return tomorrow, Dean checked and discovered that his orders were in the collection hatch. He put the food on the kitchen counter, then brought Angel’s new clothes to him. Angel looked through the boxes, picking the items up and examining them, before doing the same with the next one.
Sam slapped his hands on the table and stood up. “You’re being ridiculous,” he said to Dean, taking Eileen’s hand as she also got to her feet. “This has been great. Congratulations, Cas. G’night, you guys.”
He could hear them all repeating the word, ‘mum,’ as if it was some kind of sacred word, as he walked away. It was lucky they were paying him, because…
When Dean awoke in the morning, sunlight was streaming through the window. Belatedly realising that the lack of drapes or blinds in the living room was going to be a problem if he wanted to sleep late, he sat up and noted the time. Eight-oh-two.
Angel closed up the dishwasher and nodded, then followed Dean back out to the living room. As he got comfortable on the sofa once more, Dean set up the game, then sat next to him, making sure the gap was large enough that they wouldn't be touching.
“Oh, my! Look, these thingies,” Bobby exclaimed at the sight of the collection of phones. “I remember I had it all worked out. This one is for the FBI, this is for CIA...”
They reached the apartment, but Dean stopped before putting the key in the lock. “One more thing... none of this was Cas’s choice. This was done
Taking up the washcloth he hadn’t yet given to Angel, Dean put some of the body wash on it, then proceeded to wash the wings as quickly, but thoroughly, as possible. Angel made a kind of whimpering sound, and Dean could feel him trembling; he’d forgotten how sensitive Angel’s wings obviously were.
Oh, yeah, the more help they could get, the better. As they waited for further instruction - Castiel leaning heavily on the door frame - Dean heard an unfamiliar voice greet Ed through the angel radio,
Dean gasped, and almost pulled his hand away, when it came into contact with bare skin. Every other night, Angel had worn a shirt, but now suddenly he wasn’t, and Dean didn’t know what to do. His hand lay warm on Angel’s skin, and the way it moved under his touch with his breaths was mesmerising.
Dean was perfectly happy to spend the rest of the evening doing this, and that was more or less exactly what happened; they changed games a few times, and stopped to eat, but the controllers never left their hands, and they hardly moved from the sofa.
He lowered the sunglasses he had put on, and ran his hand through his trademark mullet. “You probably don’t remember me, do you? It's the sunglasses, right? I was on the show for a few episodes in season two, before they killed me offscreen.” He gestured towards himself.
Dean didn't even realise that he'd stopped playing, until Angel turned to look at him, with a quizzical expression. Feeling flustered at being caught out this way, Dean covered up his staring by announcing that he was finished working for the day.
“Hey, Dean,” the one who’d spoken before started once more with his question. “So, as I was saying, in, ‘Phantom Traveler,’ remember, you said you made your EMF meter out of a Walkman. Can you explain how you did that?”
“I look forward to meeting you all in person when you arrive in Heaven,” the female angel said as she smiled sweetly.
Okay, here was his chance to make Dean understand that he was able to tell the difference between fantasy and reality. “Yes, yes, I know, Dean, and I actually wanna… I just wanted to tell you that I thought a lot about what you said...”
“For years since we first received transmission of your historical documents, we have studied every facet of your hunts and strategies,” Castiel continued, as Crowley and Sam stared at each other in amazement... or was it horror?
"We have a winner," Dean said, triumphantly, as he put the paper in front of Angel and placed the pen on top of that. "I thought you might want to write something… you know. Your name, or anything else you want to say."
Eileen nodded in agreement, and demonstrated the signs for them. They practiced a few times, then she left with a hug, as she whispered in Dean’s ear,
His mom looked like she was carefully considering the information Ed had given her, before nodding, and saying, “Alright, dinner's at seven.”
Castiel lifted Dean’s shirt, and panting heavily, Dean lost himself to the glorious sensations of Castiel working his way across and down his chest. It started off gentle and sweet, with little nibbles and licks, and sweet open-mouthed kisses, but it increasingly felt frantic... desperate, even. He ground hard against Dean, and his hands and mouth began to feel like they were trying to touch everywhere all at once.
When he opened his eyes again, Dean could hardly believe what he was seeing; Cas was flapping his wings, and
Despite their childlike appearance, however, the more they watched them, the more unsettling Dean found them. There was something not quite right about them, and it seemed it wasn’t just him who felt it.
When Dean glanced at Angel's face, he was horrified at what he saw. All the colour had drained away, and there were tears streaking his cheeks.
Unfortunately, he was supposed to be doing another gig with the rest of the crew very soon, and if he was late again, Sam was going to kick his ass.
A part of Dean thought about completely letting go and just enjoying the ride, but there was something he wanted to do. He slipped his hand inside Angel's pyjama pants, and wrapped his hand around his cock.
Desperately hoping that this didn’t mean there were no angels left, Dean set off briskly down the hallway in the direction of the Hunter Hub, with the others running to keep up.
“What are you, an infant? Look, we have these,” Dean said, utterly exasperated, and holding up his angel radio to show her.
Managing to lift his head a little, Dean was able to see people peering at him through the glass, and from the way they were dressed, they looked like cosplayers. Why were they at his house?
That was all it took, and Castiel cried out and his eyes glowed with his grace again, as his come flooded Dean’s mouth. Dean swallowed it all as it pulsed out, and he marvelled that it had a unique taste, just like Castiel.
“I dunno,” he shrugged, his voice thick, and lower than usual. “What’ve you got?” He winked playfully, as if he wasn’t actually engaging in some heavy duty flirting with his best friend.
“Yes, please,” Claire replied, letting her inner child out as if it had been hidden away for too long.
The door opened to reveal three figures; huge, with wings and multiple faces, and radiating a brightness that was almost too much to look at. When they opened their mouths, the noise they emitted was a kind of static, and it felt like it was shattering his eardrums.
“Yeah. It happened this morning, when we… after we…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment, and then it was Eileen’s turn to wink.
Deciding to leave her where she was to catch her breath, Dean continued on. Gesturing ahead, he said, “There's a celestial map in the core room. I'll show you, come on.”
The ‘hunters’ were clearly not as pleased with the proceedings as Dean’s new angel friends were; other than Bobby, they were all staring open-mouthed in shock.
“It helps,” Dean said, standing up and dusting himself off. There wasn’t much point if he was the only one doing it, was there?
Sighing heavily, he turned to his friend, who was waiting by the door. “All right, Balthazar, let's get back to the Hunter Hub.”
When he opened his eyes he caught Dean watching him, and Dean suddenly felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights. He couldn’t look away, and they stared at each other for far longer than would be considered normal. The guy’s gaze was piercing, and once again Dean felt like he was looking into his soul.
He should have seen this coming; why wouldn’t Cas’s family want him back? He wanted to throw up… or was he going to cry instead? Every fibre of his being was urging him to beg Cas to stay; to shout ‘don’t go’. But he couldn’t do that, could he? Cas had had more than enough decisions taken away from him, so despite what he wanted, Dean would have to stay quiet.
The elevator moved again, taking them to a lower level, and this time they stepped off. Following Castiel into a large room, they were shown what appeared to be a golden staff in the center, which was periodically emanating electrical sparks.
Dean went back to the Dean cave to pick up as many of the games he had stashed there as he could carry, and dumped them on the library table.
“My ears might not work, but my eyes do, and I see the way you two look at each other when you think no one’s watching. It’s adorable as fuck, and also frustrating as hell; so now that you’ve gotten that out of your system, maybe we can stop with the heart eyes?”
Dean chuckled as he put on his own coat, shaking his head fondly at Angel’s impatience. They went to the elevator, and Angel took Dean’s hand in his as they waited, holding on tight as they travelled down to where they could join the outside world for a little while.
Dean's words seemed about as welcome as a fart in an elevator. Yet again he appeared to have found something that scared Angel, as his eyes widened in fear.
“Good boy. Now, I’ll be back soon, to return you to your home. And please try not to soil yourself on my table; I need to keep it clean for my work.”
“Angel.” Dean’s own voice was suddenly scratchy, and he couldn’t control the tremor in it, as a tear slipped down his face.
When he’d used the toilet and brushed his teeth, Dean went to the kitchen and put on a pot of coffee, then returned to the living room and folded the blankets and bedcovers and placed the cushions back where they belonged.
“Yeah, I know that wasn’t one of my best jokes.” Kevin laughed, then peered at him curiously. “You okay, man?”
“Hey, it’s only ‘cause I’m jealous. I don’t think I could look that good in that…” Dean gestured to Blue Eyes’s costume, and
He tentatively picked it up, trying to make sense of this bizarre turn of events. “Dean, I see. Okay?”
“Man, that’s messed up. Now I know why you described it as ‘a situation’.” Benny shot him a sympathetic look.
“I mean, my TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about my six pack and my abs, and my hair and workout routines.” Sam stood and gestured towards himself helplessly.
Now that they were out of the rain, Angel was shivering violently from the cold. Dean really had to get him inside and out of those wet clothes, but for the moment, there was another way he could help him. As a joke, he had bought Sam an old fashioned gumshoe-style trench coat when he made detective. He hadn’t actually gotten around to giving it to him yet though, and it still sat in a bag in the trunk.
They jumped on their hurt comrade, and the scene that unfolded was straight out of one of their gorier episodes, which was fucking disturbing, as the poor hurt creature was ripped apart and devoured in front of their eyes. As he watched the childlike beings transform into horrific killers, Dean realized what it reminded him of; they closely resembled the changelings that had been so creepily portrayed in an episode of
He heard some muffled noises, then the bathroom door opened and Angel poked his head out. Dean saw that he was holding the towel around his waist, and his pants were discarded on the floor.
Angel went to bed reluctantly, after Dean pointed out that they were both falling asleep, and that Eileen would be coming in the morning. Dean knew that he was going to have to get Angel in the shower somehow, and he needed to get him some clothes of his own, too. Of course they would have to be altered to allow for Angel's wings, but he'd had a thought about that. Tomorrow he would give his good friend Benny a call, and hopefully they would get the clothes thing sorted out.
The only good thing about this scenario was that Dean now knew they were definitely in the right place, although he would much rather have gone inside with the element of surprise. While the first guy held them at gunpoint, all three of them had their hands roughly tied behind their backs by the second guy. He also had wings, and he was dark haired like Cas, but shorter, and nowhere near as attractive.
Cas looked as surprised as he was, and his smile was breathtaking. He soared up into the sky, and Dean felt a woosh as the air rushed past them. It was exhilarating, and Dean was astonished - and delighted - to see that Cas’s eyes were glowing blue again, and he was shining brighter than ever before.
Jo looked very uncomfortable at the thought of performing magic to open rifts. “Right,” she said, even less convincingly than Dean had been when he insisted that he was okay.
Eileen didn’t look convinced by that assertion, but she smiled anyway, as Dean fetched three mugs of coffee. She took a sheet of paper containing the signs for the alphabet from her bag, and then the lesson began.
board, explaining the rules as he did so. This game would last a lot less time than the two and a half hours their game of
The game started, and they raced around the track, trying to dodge the other cars. As always, it was great fun, but this time even more so, because Dean had a real person to play against for once. Every time one of their cars crashed into the barrier, or another car, Dean laughed uproariously, and he caught Angel grinning happily more than once.
It certainly made the nights more interesting, when Dean was alone and conjuring up a variety of fantasies involving Angel and his wings.
Determined to give Castiel as much pleasure as he’d received, Dean grabbed hold of Castiel’s tie and yanked him forward. He nipped Castiel’s bottom lip, placing his other hand on the back of Castiel’s head, then crushed their mouths together.
He headed back to the kitchen for forks and drinks, and when he returned he found that Angel hadn't moved. He was really engrossed in that game. "Get it while it's still hot… if you can tear yourself away," he joked.
It made sense insofar as it explained the wings, and the 'grace' he was injected with explained the memory loss and the glowing, but it also made no sense at all. Surely Chuck had to know that he wasn’t actually making angels? He couldn’t be that far gone that he no longer recognised reality, could he?
Thankfully, Gabriel was on hand to diffuse the situation with some sarcasm. “Claire is very grateful to you too. She’s so overcome with emotion, she doesn’t know what to say.”
Jo was making a cawing sound, and shouting, “Dean! They're coming! There's thousands of them, Dean! Run! They're coming! They're everywhere! Dean, they're everywhere!”
He had just finished measuring out the flour, baking powder, superfine sugar, and salt, and was about to add the eggs when Eileen reappeared.
“Kill it? Well, I'm open to any suggestions,” Dean challenged, as the monster found his hiding place and clawed towards him, before Dean ran once again.
Sam never told Dean how hot Cas was though, but he had mentioned something about Cas being a single parent since he’d split up with his
“Dean and his gang will be signing autographs next to the Coke machines," Ash said, his final words before leaving the stage. He had done his job well, and gone above and beyond covering for Dean's lateness. Sam hoped the convention organizers would give him some extra money to reflect that, but in reality, he doubted that would happen.
With the greatest reluctance, Dean said, “No, you know what? I'd like to skip that. I got this gig in Van Nuys in about...” he checked his watch.
For a moment, there was a stalemate between the two of them as they glared at each other, then Loki let go of him and ordered,
Their acquaintance couldn’t have been more than half an hour at this point, yet Dean felt drawn to him, though he couldn’t say why. Maybe it was Dean’s protective instinct coming out… maybe it was something more than that.
Dean removed his coat and hat, went to the bedroom, and hung them on the back of the door. He really wanted to change out of his wet clothes as well, but he had a feeling he would need to go back out to the store, once he had examined all of Angel’s injuries. He walked back into the living room and saw that Angel was lying exactly where Dean had left him. He hoped the sofa wouldn’t stain from the sheer amount of rain coming off the guy, but he would worry about that later.
Dean was sure he was babbling, but Angel was staring at him again, and this time he didn’t look too pleased. He finger spelled ‘no’, before Dean put out his hand to stop him.
Ash had that petrified look on his face once again, and Dean was torn between feeling sorry for the guy, and wishing he would get a grip. He decided to ignore him, and focus on something more important, like a plan to protect Heaven.
Almost as soon as he was up the following morning - after putting the coffee machine on first, of course - Dean messaged Eileen. As he didn’t want her to get suspicious about his sudden interest in sign language, it took him a few minutes to get the message right, but eventually he was satisfied with it, and pressed send.
“Sam Wesson, my personal favorite, Sam Winchester! Yeah!” Ash’s words were practically drowned out by the cheering when Sam appeared onstage, flicking his hair dramatically, and posing as seductively as he was able. His role on the show might have been one-dimensional, but he knew what the audience wanted.
Dean could do nothing but comply, and with a shout of ecstasy, he came over Castiel’s hand. Castiel worked him through it, watching Dean with a fascination, as his hand was coated in the sticky white liquid.
“You need my help, or can you make it on your own?” Dean gestured towards the bathroom door on the other side of the living room.
“I don't know!” Dean didn’t know how many times he had to tell the stupid blue asshole that he was clueless about how the Book of the Damned worked.
“So now you know,” Loki crowed in triumph. Then, pointing to one of his men, he ordered, “Open rifts to other worlds. We’ll send these feathered fools so far away they’ll never find their way back.”
“Sounds good to me.” Dean smiled. This was nice… great, even. Once Chuck was locked up, everything would be perfect.
This wasn’t going well at all. Bobby really didn’t look like he knew what he was doing, and Dean was almost ready to jump out of his chair and start answering the phones himself.
It might not be either of those options, of course, but Dean found that his pants were suddenly getting tighter, just thinking about the possibilities.
Walking towards the next building, however, something felt different. There was a flicker of movement near the entrance, and Dean swore he could hear muffled noises somewhere inside. Of course, it might not be Chuck; it could be other criminal activity, like a drug deal, or gun-running. But Dean was ninety nine percent certain they’d found the right place.
Gabriel watched his brother and niece in the kitchen for a few moments, before turning to Dean. "Claire was only ten when Castiel moved away, but she never forgot about him, or stopped believing he would return to us one day. Her mom also disappeared after Jimmy died - in a spiritual sense, that is - so Claire and I have grown closer. But Cassie was always so good with her, and losing him felt like a double blow."
Thankfully the elevator had reached the ground floor, and Dean no longer had to think of any excuses for his late night trip to the store. With a “Goodbye. See you around,” he rushed to the car and set off with a squeal of tires.
“Just ten more minutes, okay, Ma? I promise.” Ed gave his mom a hopeful smile, then returned to his task as she left the room.
Cas flipped him over, giving him a look that wasn’t angelic at all, before working his way slowly down Dean’s body in order to return the favour.
Dean stared at it for a second or two, before he suddenly took flight, and the atmosphere turned to chaos and panic.
“Well, I hope you know how to get through the traps, Dean. I’m unaware of how to navigate them safely.” Castiel continued to give nothing away to Dean regarding his feelings, and Dean couldn’t really blame him.
Angel looked at the shirts in wonder, as Benny explained the adaptations he’d made. Angel was able to slip them on, slot his wings into the holes on each side, then fasten the shirts below each wing with press studs. It was simple but effective, and Dean couldn’t thank Benny enough for the independence this gave Angel.
Undeterred, Dean pushed the people on either side of him out of the way, and leaned on the table to speak to Crowley and the others at eye level. “No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.” He said, enthusiastically, pointing to the sky. “I was up there. Remember yesterday at the convention, those people dressed like angels? They
The effect was almost immediate; Angel seemed a lot calmer, and Dean regretted not using that setting sooner. He had gone for speed rather than comfort, but he would remember this for next time.
Chuck, being the coward he was, ran for the door to make his escape, but before he could reach it, it flew open and the police reinforcements rushed through.
His head was still pounding though. Dean huffed in frustration, but before he could ask for painkillers, Samandriel interrupted his thoughts,
He put one hand on Dean's chest, and trailed his fingers across it, before leaning down and planting a soft kiss just above his nipple. Dean gasped, as Angel began to kiss every part of him he could reach; his neck, collarbones, nipples, abdomen, ribs… Angel worshipped each spot with his mouth. Dean tried not to squirm, but the sensations made that very hard.
Finally he was done, and Dean let out a long breath. He allowed himself a look at Angel's face, and was mortified to see a tear rolling down his cheek.
Angel tilted his head and gazed at him as if trying to decipher what he meant, before doing as Dean suggested. He turned away from Dean when he reached under the towel to remove his boxer shorts, while Dean hoped that he would be left alone in the bathroom soon, so that he could remove the wet clothes from his own body.
Jo walked hesitantly back towards the table, but she didn’t appear to be any more confident than she had been before. “Oh, no, no, no. Dean, I'll just... I'll just mess it up.”
“Then what do you want?” Cas had stopped fiddling with his beer bottle, and was staring at Dean now; looking into his eyes so intensely that Dean felt an involuntary twitch in his cock.
that voice. It was deep and rich, and sexy as hell, and Dean knew he had to pull himself together before he made a total fool of himself.
“It's all real,” Dean disclosed, causing Ed to pause, and sit still in shock for a second as he pondered on what he’d just been told.
Dean could hear Samandriel’s voice droning on as he continued relating his ‘fascinating’ tale about Loki. As he began to drift off to thoughts of blue eyes and pink lips, Dean once again found himself impressed at these guys’ dedication to the roles they were playing. If he wasn’t feeling so shitty he might even have told them so.
Dean thought with a chuckle, as he brought the sandwiches through to the living room, and they sat down to eat. As always, Angel ate hungrily, although Dean noticed that he did seem to be trying hard to slow down somewhat with his eating, and he smiled to himself as he started on his own food.
“It’s very hard sometimes, but also extremely rewarding,” Cas agreed. “And I’m lucky enough to have a great network of friends who are willing to help with childcare.”
Angel’s smile was tired but happy, as he raised his hand and stroked Dean’s cheek with his thumb. It was so affectionate… so reverent… that Dean almost couldn’t bear it. He came close to telling Angel to pack it in, when he bent down and playfully licked a stripe up Dean’s chest. Dean squirmed, and definitely didn’t squeak.
“he wanted to turn Cas into an angel. Man, that piece of shit was so fucked up… sorry, Claire. He thought he was god, and he hurt Cas. Tortured him. Locked him away, made him speak some bullshit angel language, messed with his memories.”
Dean pulled himself into a sitting position, only to discover that someone was hammering nails into his head. Probably the same person who glued his eyes shut. He lifted his hand to his head and held it for a few moments; a futile gesture. The truth was, it hadn't been a great night, and nothing was going to get rid of this headache.
“That’s not how I’d describe it,” Dean growled. “It’s not very fucking even, is it? Let me go and we’ll have a fair fight, and then we’ll see how
The way Angel was staring at Dean was a little disconcerting; so much so that Dean was grateful that he needed to watch where they were going, and to keep his eyes peeled for other people. He also had to concentrate on not dropping the guy, because,
He got out a baking sheet for later, as well as a large bowl which he placed the ground beef in, along with some seasonings. Adding the onion once Angel had finished chopping it, he then asked,
It suddenly struck Sam that the angels didn’t have any idea that he and Dean were really brothers. The fact that they looked nothing like each other had been ideal when they’d auditioned for unrelated roles on the same TV show, and this had allowed them to get away with playing those characters for years. Without giving anything away, he really needed to find out if his brother was okay though; that those scary little creatures hadn’t seriously injured him, or god forbid, something worse.
Like the previous day, Dean set Angel up with another game on the screen - this one involved fighting aliens - and he set about making dinner. Cooking together earlier had been fun, but Dean wasn't sure if he could handle spending time in such close quarters with the guy twice in one day. There was only so much sexual tension he could take.
Gabriel and Claire’s expressions had turned murderous, and Dean couldn’t blame them. This story was all sorts of fucked up.
The buzz of the door cam made them both jump, and Dean let go of him. "Stay here, I'll be back in a couple of minutes."
“I’m sure I can think of something,” Cas murmured, before pressing forward and proving that he could indeed think of something.
It looked like he was intending to cook it himself, but Dean took a step back anyway, and said “help yourself,” by way of a little extra encouragement.
Dean felt a wave of sadness at the thought of Cas’s family looking for him, and being lied to about his whereabouts. Maybe it was Chuck who’d given them the runaround; Dean found himself suddenly seething with anger at the very thought. Thankfully, he had something more important to focus on though, like how to prove that it was Castiel, and that he wasn’t trying to cause Gabriel more grief. A photograph?
Dean just needed to get through the rest of this crappy job, then go home and crawl inside a bottle. He went back to his table and resumed signing the autographs, but his heart was no longer in it. He found himself writing them almost mechanically, not bothering to even look at the people he was signing them for. What was the point if he was just a joke?
After he’d swallowed it all down, Dean crawled his way back up Cas’s body, and kissed him lazily. “Angel,” he added, one more time.
Dean thought, and he thought he saw a flicker of recognition in those blue eyes. Had that filtered through to Castiel like some kind of prayer?
There was a mixture of emotions as they made their way back to the portal room, and as the shimmering light appeared and grew in front of them. Dean didn’t know what the future held, especially for Cas and Hannah - would they become human, or would they still be angels? If so, were they able to go back to Heaven? It sure would be interesting finding out.
Feeling it was best to leave Angel be for the moment, Dean went back into the kitchen, and began to cook, every once in a while poking his head out to check on him, and at one point bringing him a glass of orange juice, which he swallowed in one go. He sat quite still, wings folded close to his back, his good arm resting on his leg, and his chin in his hand. Dean could almost believe he was content, with the way he was looking out at the city
“The look on your face was very funny,” Cas said, obviously feeling very pleased with himself, before adding: “wait there.” He ducked back inside, leaving Dean in a state of anticipation for the evening ahead.
Relieved laughter filled the air at their victory, followed by a great deal of hugging and patting of backs.
? After pressing the button, he looked once again at the face of the guy he realised he was now subconsciously referring to as Angel, to find him staring up at him again. Despite the apparent lifelessness in his dull grey eyes, Dean found them almost hypnotising, and he had trouble focusing on anything else for a moment.
The sound of laughter came floating down the hallway, growing increasingly louder until Castiel and a whole host of angels burst into the room, clearly finding something hilarious.
Maybe it was time for Dean to ask Sam that question about any cases involving missing persons, or even people with wings. But how could he do that without letting on his reason for such a question? Sam wasn’t stupid, and he would realise immediately that there was something Dean wasn’t telling him.
“Mother, I cannot stress enough the severity of Dean Winchester’s predicament,” Ed grumbled, his voice disappearing into the distance as his mom called after him,
Angel studied Dean for a few seconds, before nodding, and signing ‘okay’, as he visibly calmed down.
"Couldn't you… I dunno, just check his place out? If you wanna make it official, you could say it was an anonymous tip-off. Or a hunch. What about, you heard Chuck spouting some crazy shit and you were disturbed?"
There was no chance of going back out to deal with Chuck - not tonight, anyway - it was much more important for Dean to be there for Angel.
Dean rushed back into the kitchen, finished pouring Angel's coffee, and brought it back through to him along with the sugar and a spoon. "I'm sorry, I didn't know Eileen was coming. But don't worry; it'll all be okay, I promise."
Angel picked half of his sandwich up too, and examined it carefully before bringing it to his mouth. Dean watched expectantly as he bit into it and his eyes widened in surprise.
Dean's hand became Angel's, as he sped up the strokes and whispered Dean's name. His other hand travelled to his nipple, and he rubbed his thumb around it -
Angel slowly raised his head up until their faces were inches apart, and gazed deeply into his eyes. When he reached his other hand out to cup Dean’s cheek, Dean instinctively leaned into the touch, and his eyes fluttered shut for a moment. When he opened them again, Angel had moved closer still, and Dean could feel his breath on his face.
“Hey, get a room, guys, okay? Hey, Jo,” Ash said then, as Hannah did something incredible with her wings.
“Castiel, I'm not a hunter. I...” Dean hesitated as he saw the hurt in the angel’s eyes. “There's no hunter network. We don’t even have a real car.” God, this was killing him.
Castiel stepped forward, and Dean instinctively moved back. Not that he was opposed to the idea of getting up close and personal with the angel - on the contrary - but he did feel a little like he was Castiel’s prey.
had always intended for the show to end at season five, but the cast and crew had gone ahead and filmed the opening of an episode they hoped would be the start of a sixth season. A select few people had seen it before it had been shelved and forgotten, along with any plans for a sixth season, but now they were screening it to stall the convention goers before the main cast came out on stage.
He spotted them sitting at a table under an awning signing autographs - Bobby eating his way through a bag of chips at the same time - and he pushed through the meagre crowd to get to them.
After running the washcloth over Angel’s hair, his shoulders, chest and arms, then towelling him dry, Dean hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he should wash the wings, and the way Angel had them folded behind him seemed to be indicating that he didn’t want them touched. Or even for Dean to look at them.
fail to realize is that the angels have joined together to create a shield more powerful than you could possibly imagine,” Dean said, as one of Sam’s spells hit him and he was turned into a popsicle.
Dean got to his feet, and stumbled over to the glass door. With a sigh, he slid it open a few inches and peered at his visitors, trying to get his vision to focus. “Can I help you?” he rasped; god, his mouth was dry.
“Alright, we're at level C, hallway five. Now what?” He said into the radio, knowing that Ed was on the other end, looking at a detailed set of plans.
"Hi, Claire." Dean held his hand out to her, but she just stared at him, in a way that reminded him of Cas; although Cas was generally more smiley.
Angel stared at him in what could only be described as wonder, as he processed Dean’s words, until Dean began to feel uncomfortable himself.
Everyone backstage was well aware of how the situation was escalating, and Sam felt both sorry for, and thankful that he was not, that Ash guy who was bearing the brunt of the crowd’s anger.
“Cas deliberately hid himself away from the world when he moved here, because… well, of course you know why.”
When they were both teenagers, he and Sam had gotten into a bit of a scrape out in the woods, and he'd had to put a couple of stitches in Sam's arm. The scar didn't look too pretty, but it had stopped the bleeding, plus it meant that Dean knew he could do this. This time the circumstances were a lot less fraught, and he was able to thoroughly sterilise the needle.
Suddenly, Castiel stopped kissing him, and gazed into his eyes with an intensity that made his toes curl. His eyes fluttered shut, and Castiel growled, “No, keep them open. I want to see you.”
Castiel scrunched up his nose and stared at Dean, then disappeared through the door. Okay, so Castiel hadn’t gotten that reference either; didn’t mean Dean was going to stop making them. He could feel Sam watching him curiously, but he didn’t react. Sam was almost certainly wondering if he and Castiel were having a ’thing’, and while - yes - it was true, they could discuss that later. Right now, there were more pressing matters to attend to.
Dean groaned as Angel began to bob his head, and swirl his tongue around the tip, using his other hand to gently squeeze Dean’s balls. Dean bucked up into the wet heat of Angel’s mouth, and without missing a beat, Angel placed his other hand on Dean’s chest to hold him still. That feeling of power…
Dean found a couple of pens, and he fished them out, hoping that at least one of them would work. Angel had been watching him closely as he searched through the box, and he tilted his head curiously when Dean scribbled on the piece of paper he tore from one of his notebooks. It took a minute or so before any ink appeared, but at last it made a clear mark.
“I need a shower,” he said, exaggeratedly sniffing his armpits and making a face in mock disgust. “You need to use the bathroom first?”
By the time Angel showed his face in the kitchen, Dean was dressed and making coffee. Angel signed ‘hello’, accepted the offered cup, and took a sip.
Castiel stared at him in wonder, and Dean knew that the prayer had reached him. A huge smile broke out on his face, and he nodded.
Dean ran through the controls with her, then left them to play happily, while Gabriel told Dean and Cas that they were planning on staying in the area for a couple of days, and asked if they could visit some more.
“Emmanuel, there you are. I’ve missed you,” Chuck said, smarmily. “I know you don’t want Dean to suffer, so I’m offering you a swap. You come back to where you’re supposed to be, and Dean doesn’t get hurt any more than he already has.”
They would be going for a meal first, then maybe move on to a club for some dancing and hopefully a lot more flirting.
Mystery Man tried shrinking away from him, but judging from the way he winced with even the slightest movement, his injuries were obviously pretty bad.
he was too close to stop now. Pushing back against Cas’s skillful digits, and then forward into the tight warmth of his other hand, he felt that moment approaching. With a sincere appreciation of the fact that Cas had thought to cover the sofa with a shirt, he came, trembling and gasping.
“Is that okay? Me calling you Angel? I need to call you something… maybe a different name.” He racked his brains trying to think of one. “... Steve? Would that be better?”
“Mix the sage and the dried goat’s blood, then carefully cover the symbol with it. This will stop the poison-coated darts from shooting out and hitting you, turning you against each other.
As Loki went on his vicious rampage, and one by one, the injured bodies of Dean’s friends fell to the floor, he could only think of one way to save everyone, and stop Loki once and for all. He pulled his angel radio from his pocket, and whispered into it,
Angel signed ‘yes’, and followed Dean into the kitchen. Dean washed his hands, then took the ground beef out of the fridge while Angel followed suit and washed his hands also.
“There will be a puff of blue smoke,” Ed warned too late, as Dean and Castiel were engulfed in a cloud so thick, Dean couldn’t see a thing for a few seconds.
When the food and coffee was all finished, Angel put down his fork and stared back. His blue eyes were piercing, and…
Sam went back to work a few minutes later, promising to keep them updated on any developments, and Gabriel and Claire left soon after that. They would return in the morning for Cas's bacon and eggs, and for more family bonding time as well.
“Look at that. Would you look at that?” Bobby said, gazing at them in wonder. “They look like little children.”
Dean strolled over to stand behind Jo, who at that moment was being asked a most interesting question by a fan.
Eileen started to make a fake gagging noise, but stopped as a look of wonder crossed her face. “You spoke,” she said to Angel, before turning to Dean. “He spoke?”
“Hey, you know, you could put an eye out with that thing,” Dean quipped, trying to defuse the tension as he wondered what the hell Jo was up to.
This train of thought got Dean thinking about Sam again. Was there any way Dean could subtly bring up the subject of missing persons without raising suspicion? Or even maybe if any other people had been found with wings. Without using the word 'other', obviously.
Well, damn, this was going very poorly. “Hold, please,” Sam said, muting the angel radio again, and looking to the others for assistance.
Luckily he wasn't far from his apartment, so it would only take him ten minutes to get there and back.
Normally he would have carried on for another half an hour or so, but he could cut it short for once. It's not like he was working toward a deadline.
Dean knew he was going to feel this tomorrow, but he gave one last effort as he got the two of them into his apartment and laid Angel carefully on the sofa, thankfully without tripping over the coffee table. Colonel came out to greet him, wagging his tail excitedly. “Hey, little fella,” Dean smiled, “did you miss me?” Colonel’s tail sped up, and he reared up on his hind legs and lifted his front paws in the air.
He opened his eyes and saw a green tongue, which was attached to... something he hadn’t seen before. It had scaly green skin, wings, and red eyes, and if Dean wasn’t certain they didn’t exist, he could almost swear it was a dragon. He had no idea if it was friendly or not, but at least those vicious little changelings that attacked him had disappeared.
“You got it. And thanks, Eileen, for being so understanding,” Dean said, hugging her goodbye. He saw her out, then returned to the living room to find Angel practising the signs.
“Fruit from the tree of life,” Hannah said, handing it to Jo and shooting her a dazzling smile. In that instant Jo’s demeanor changed completely; she smiled sweetly back at the angel and smoothed her hair with her hands, and they gazed at each other in a long, charged moment.
She slid the paper over to Angel, but he made no attempt to pick up the pen. Instead, he shrunk back into the seat, as if he was afraid. Strangely, his reaction this time was even stronger than when Dean had asked him to write his name. Maybe it was because Eileen had asked him, rather than Dean, or maybe it was because she’d asked him for more than just his name. Whatever the reason, it was painful to see him in such distress.
“It's not a big deal. These guys put a little set in their basement. I'm there about an hour. It's nothing, Sam. They wanted Dean.” He gestured to himself, trying his utmost to convince Sam that taking a job on his own was perfectly fine, while Sam gaped at him incredulously.
Jo, however, was backing away, with a look of sheer panic on her face. “I mean, I can't. I can supervise...” she babbled.
When he was spent, Castiel helped Dean back to his feet and kissed him again as Dean tucked him back in, and straightened them both up. When they eventually pulled apart, they smiled shyly at each other, and with a pang of disappointment that Castiel’s eyes were back to normal - because
“Here we go,” Sam said, running his hand through his ridiculous hair as he broke through Dean’s musings.
"You want to teach someone? Who?” Eileen had that look on her face that said ‘don’t mess with me’, and Dean felt both intimidated and impressed.
Dean hadn’t been wrong about it lasting less time; within twenty minutes it was all over, and Cas came out as the winner, after correctly accusing Professor Plum, in the study, with the knife.
“Uh uh.” Dean tapped Cas on the shoulder. “You’re not falling asleep here; not when there’s a perfectly good bed in the other room. Move your ass, angel.”
When he’d finished writing, Cas furiously thrust his note into Gabriel’s hand, and as he read, his expression turned from angry to apologetic. He looked back over to Dean, and meekly offered an apology. “Sorry man, I... um, jumped to conclusions.”
They were all through the rift now, and Dean looked around with interest. It appeared to be very similar to earth, and he wondered how far those similarities went. Was there another Dean Winchester in this world? Another Sam?
Cas didn’t let up; working Dean through it until he started to become over-sensitive, then releasing him. Dean flopped down on the sofa while Cas disappeared into the bathroom to rinse his mouth and grab a washcloth, then he returned and cleaned him up.
Dean didn’t realise that Angel had opened the bottle of lube, until he felt a wet finger circling and probing at his entrance. He loved the tender way Angel ever so carefully worked the tip of his finger in, then began to slowly fuck him with it, going a little deeper each time he pushed it back in.
It was lucky Dean found him attractive, or he would probably lose it right now. This charade had dragged on too long, and all he wanted was to leave, with the guy's number in his pocket.
Dean had barely managed to groan out an, “Oh, fuck,” when Castiel began stroking him expertly. He definitely didn’t learn this from the historical documents, Dean knew that much.
Dean could feel sleep pulling at the edges of his consciousness, and this wasn’t helping him to focus on what Samandriel was saying. He turned his head to the side, and found that the woman was looking at him curiously.
He saw Sam drop his forehead to the table, as Cas gave him an inquiring look. “I’ll show you,” he said, disappearing momentarily to find a piece of paper and a couple of pencils. When he returned, they were all staring at him intently. It was kind of disconcerting, but he ignored them and drew the grid on the paper, before handing Cas a pencil and explaining, “we fill it with xs and os. Whoever makes a line first wins.”
Angel followed him into the kitchen, and Dean had a sudden thought. Turning to Angel, he asked, “Is there anything you’d like to eat? Something you really like?”
“What the hell happened to you, huh?” Dean asked, not expecting an answer, as he sat next to Angel and gently took hold of his chin to start washing the uninjured side of his face. When it was clean he switched to the side with the graze, dabbing at it, rather than wiping it. Although doing it like this would take longer, he figured this had to be less painful for the guy. Also, there was really no avoiding that gaze now; to Dean it felt as if the guy was trying to see into his soul.
Dean rested his head against the wall, and they gazed into each other’s eyes as Angel’s hand worked faster and faster over their shafts. Angel was making those adorable whimpering noises again, and Dean’s eyes briefly fluttered shut. When he opened them again, Angel’s stunning, and glowing blues were staring at him intensely, as the noises they were both making got louder and louder.
When the order had gone through - plus another food order - Dean activated Colonel, then took up his guitar and began to play. He watched as Angel sat with Colonel while he plucked at the strings, and it struck him that they had already fallen into a routine; this was more or less exactly what they had done yesterday.
"Shit, I'm sorry man." Dean raised his hands in a gesture of apology, and backed away a little. "I wouldn't ever hurt you; I hope you know that. But why would you trust me? You don't even know me."
By now it was six in the evening, and they stopped temporarily, to grab some dinner. An hour or so later, armed with full bellies, a shitload of beers, and determination - on Dean’s part anyway - game night resumed once more.
Dean was about to engage Castiel in another epic staring contest, when an angel had come to tell them that the rest of the cast had changed their minds and their imminent arrival in Heaven was due.
Angel nodded, and Dean continued the wing caresses, across and down, over the feathers. This was obviously all Angel needed to tip over the edge, and he fucked into him harder than he’d done before, his whole body shaking as his orgasm ripped through him.
“Yoo-hoo. Hello?” he said into the device, laughing at his own silliness, and momentarily unaware that Blue Eyes and Samandriel had left the room.
Dean clapped his hands, decisively. “Let’s blast him with a spell that’ll slow him down, and one that will block him from hitting us with a counter-spell. And while you're at it, why don't you toss that at them, Killer?”
Right... enough was enough. “Okie dokie, okie dokie,” Dean interrupted, noticing a look of sheer terror crossing Samandriel’s face.
Dean couldn't just leave him here, not knowing if he was hurt, so he crouched down and spoke softly. "Mind if I take a look at you? Make sure you're not injured?"
“Damn, I don’t even know where to start.” Dean looked around for his coffee, before remembering that he hadn’t had a single cup yet today. That needed rectifying, immediately.
Castiel grabbed the screen from Dean’s hands and glared at his brother. He didn’t say a word, but Gabriel seemed to get the message loud and clear, and when he handed it back, Gabriel apologised immediately.
“We're screwed. We're so screwed,” Ash grumbled, and Dean realized he needed to intervene to stop this constant fighting and complaining.
Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but their movements were as strange as their voices. Silted… mechanical.
Dean was not going to leave Crowley to go last; he was their leader, dammit, and he had to make sure everyone was safe before he left. “There's no time. Get in! Get in!”
Before Angel could react to that, Dean thumbed the head of his cock, eliciting the most adorable whimpering noises from him. His eyes fluttered shut and he laid his head on Dean's chest, and… he was doing that glowing thing again. Dean was mesmerised by it, but he realised that if he didn't want Angel to come before they got to the main action, he needed to stop and let Angel compose himself.
Continuing with his pity party, Ash added, “For all you know, I'm just the unnamed character who gets killed at the start of the episode.”
Rushing through the store warehouse with the others hot on his heels, Sam spotted Ash talking to a female employee.
"Do you know how to make pancakes?" Dean asked. When he got a shake of the head in reply, he held out his hand and said, "Cooking lesson number one. Pancakes."
Angel gave a small nod and wiped the tear from his face, as Dean wound the bandage around the wound and secured it with the tape. “Okay, that should hold,” he said as he took the tray back into the kitchen, grabbed a plastic bowl, and filled it with hot water.
Angel responded by kissing Dean as if he needed his breath to sustain him. Dean pulled him closer, revelling in the feeling of that firm body pressed against his, as Angel removed his hand from their cocks and rinsed it under the water.
not ready to make their entrance. Shaking his head ‘no’ and gesturing frantically with his hands, he mouthed, ‘stretch it out’. Ash hesitantly turned back to the baying crowd, feeling a rising desperation.
Dean’s mouth was still feeling kind of disgusting after last night, and distracted by this, he put his now empty can down, muttering “backwash” in Samandriel’s direction.
As if that thought wasn’t amazing enough, Angel then did something extraordinary. He opened his mouth, and in the deepest of voices, that sounded like it hadn’t been used for centuries, he spoke.
Dean had to stop himself from running around the store like a wild man, but he made sure not to pause except to pick up what he required. Glue, sterile wipes, tape, and a six pack of beer. Not many people drank beer these days, what with most drugs being legal, but Dean was old school. He liked the occasional beer or two, rock music, and classic cars; hell, he remembered when Baby still ran on gas.
“The main garrison,” Castiel explained, as Dean wondered how many more of them would fall for one of the angels. Just as long as none of them set their sights on Castiel…
Castiel seemed to be happy with that, and he smiled knowingly before turning to Bobby. “Robert Salvage,” he said to the only other member of the cast who looked like he wanted to be there. Bobby nodded in greeting, as his name reverberated with the repetition of his name.
Well, as long as he got paid, who was he to judge? It wasn’t like he didn’t make his living pretending to be other people, was it?
He could see Loki transforming back into his true form once more, but Sam and Crowley had their backs to the ugly blue bastard, and were pinning Dean’s arms to his side. Nodding in Loki’s direction, he tried again. “He's gonna try to kill all of us!”
Every instinct Dean had was telling him to comfort Angel with a reassuring touch, but he held back, not wanting to add to the distress. He could offer soothing words though. "It'll soon be over," he said. "It should only sting for a second or two."
Angel began to sob silently, his body shaking as he let it out. Dean wanted to hold him… to soothe away his distress, but how could he know if Angel would want that? It might make things worse. If he tried and it upset him even more, he would never forgive himself.
Benny huffed a laugh, and grinned. "I gotta say, brother, I thought you were gonna ask me to hide him. This will be much easier, so sure… count me in."
Dean stopped talking for a moment when Angel’s expression told him he wasn’t too pleased at the idea of Dean getting another friend of his involved in his plight. He’d accepted Eileen, but maybe he thought telling a second person was just too much. It would all be fine once Dean explained.
Dean already knew the answer to that; it was because it was on the television show, where the set designer obviously had a hard-on for Indiana Jones. That didn’t make it any easier to deal with, though.
Dean was happy to see that each day Angel made progress with his confidence and independence. Watching him go off to the kitchen unprompted, to grab a coffee, or something to eat was a huge step in the right direction. Dean didn’t remark on it, though; he didn’t want to say anything that might make Angel self conscious, and risk any kind of setback.
“Fuck’s sake… really?” Dean jumped up and paced around the room. “He can’t just get away with what he’s done, Sam. Please tell me you’re still looking for him?”
His mom picked up the full laundry basket, and gave him a pointed look. “Come on, Ed, don't make me ask you again.”
All eyes would certainly have been on them if Cas had done that, but Dean preferred that it was only him with his eye on Cas.
Angel removed the condom and stood up from the bed, and Dean wasn’t sure if he should stay. He moved to get up as well, but Angel signed ‘no’, and pressed lightly on Dean’s chest, before leaving the room. He returned a minute later, with a warm washcloth, and cleaned Dean up, then dropped it on the bedside cabinet, got back into bed, and pulled Dean into his strong arms.
He could feel the anger beginning to boil inside him thinking about Chuck, but he had to keep it together for Cas.
His mom obviously wanted more information than that, however. “Well... Wait. Ed, where are you going with all that stuff?”
Dean swallowed his mouthful and laughed, as Angel devoured his sandwich like he was a starving dog. “Good, huh?”
Realizing these must be the people who had booked him for tomorrow, Dean made a hand gesture indicating for him to lower his voice. “Whoa, whoa, is this about the gig tomorrow? Hammer out the details with my agent, and make sure there’s a limo at my house.”
“Yeah, I think we are. We’ll just need to get the portal open again, and we can be on our way.” Dean could see Castiel looking at him sadly out of the corner of his eye, and he realized there was a conversation they needed to have.
Eileen followed them inside, raising a questioning eyebrow at the way Angel stayed constantly plastered to Dean’s side. They sat, and Dean began, signing the words he knew.
Clearly dissatisfied with Dean’s answer, Loki stomped back over towards Castiel, and touched the angel blade to his throat.
He had a last name, a location, and a computer, and within half an hour, he had found two relatives; Gabriel and Claire Novak. They had both made posts on the internet, looking for their brother/uncle Castiel Novak, who had gone missing, so now all Dean needed to do was to contact them and tell them that Cas was with him, and he was safe.
It was the most gentle fuck Dean had ever gotten, but despite that he could feel his breathing becoming shallower, and he couldn’t help the increasingly loud moans he was letting out. He wanted Angel to get on with it and fuck him with more than his fingers, but it was obvious that Angel was using these actions to show Dean how much he wanted to care for him in return.
She went through to the living room after Dean opened the door, and he stayed in the kitchen, busying himself by making some pancake batter. He’d cook them once Eileen and Angel had finished their chat, and he would let Angel decide whether they would have them with fruit or bacon. Dean’s choice would be bacon - when wasn’t it? - but he would go along with whatever Angel chose.
Eventually, Dean heard a door open and close, then footsteps, and finally Chuck was bending down and smiling at him.
they were supposed to be able to see a demon’s true face. Surely Crowley having a normal human face would be a dead giveaway.
“What if we get all the angels to combine their grace?” Crowley suggested. “That kind of power should protect them from anything, gods included. Loki knows they’re more powerful together; which is why he sent so many of them into those alternate universes.”
Dean waited until they stepped out, then shook Gabriel's hand warmly. "Thanks for coming. Cas is so damn excited."
This was the second time Dean had accidentally made an innuendo like this, and it felt even more wrong this time, somehow. Maybe it was because Angel was showing definite signs of interest in Dean, but Dean didn’t want to encourage him… not yet, anyway.
Angel nodded, and started to eat, with as much enthusiasm as ever. The need for food was obviously more important than anything else in that moment, and Dean was glad of it.
Dean was struggling to open his eyes - it felt like someone had glued them shut. As he gradually came back to the land of the living, he realized that it was morning, and he was lying on the floor of his conservatory.
The wait for the elevator seemed interminable, and at one point he considered taking the stairs instead. When it finally arrived he pressed the button frantically, as if that action would get him to the store faster.
They both nodded solemnly, then Dean opened the door and they went inside, where Cas was standing anxiously in the middle of the room. The conflicting emotions on his face at the sight of his family were too much for Dean to bear, and he found that he was unable to stop himself from crying.
Crowley had done his part too, dammit. Why did he never get any recognition? “It's just not fair,” he moaned to no one, because no one cared.
Sam and Dean let go of each other, and Crowley approached them slowly, very obviously trying to hide a smile. Dean, on the other hand, was grinning from ear to ear.
Dean had no idea if this was deliberate or not, but he found he kind of liked the delicious torture of being so close, and yet so far.
“Come on, come on, come on,” he urged. “If we want to finish this mission, we have to use some self-control.”
Angel jumped at the sudden noise, and Dean held up his hand in apology. "Sorry, man," he said, before going across the room to pick up his guitar.
Dean had to put a stop to this nonsense, right now. He slammed his hands on the table and shouted, “There's no such thing as ghosts, or ghouls. No goddamn EMF meters, no supernatural. You got it?”
Cas’s statement had rocked Dean to his core. Although he had suspected the physical and emotional abuse, discovering the awful truth was almost more painful than he could bear. Chuck taking advantage of an emotionally vulnerable man, and pretending to offer him comfort, all while plotting his abduction… Dean was full of rage at the very thought of it. All that time Cas was held against his will - being tortured - nearly two years! No wonder he was so broken when Dean found him.
Samandriel picked himself off the floor, and beamed excitedly. “We are saved. He has saved us. Dean Smith has saved us!”
called.” Gabriel suddenly looked murderous, as he checked something on his computer. “That was at twelve thirty-six. We called Sam right away, and while he was on his way here, Chuck called again. Twelve fifty-two. He told Castiel where they were supposed to meet - alone - but Cas wouldn’t tell us. He only cared about protecting you. He left before Sam even got here, and about ten minutes later… at one forty, your door cam buzzed, and we found you unconscious outside the building. You woke up about twenty minutes later.”
As the music floated through the air, Angel turned around in his seat for the first time since he had sat down, and watched transfixed as Dean lost himself in the tune. It was intended to be a rock song, but Dean wondered if, with just his voice and an acoustic guitar, it could sound quite soothing.
“Oh man, I’m so fucking s-“ Dean started, but stopped himself before that damn word left his mouth again. “I’m… gonna put this bandage on the wound, clean you up and get you out of these wet clothes. I mean, er… get some dry clothes on you. Then I’ll fix us something to eat, oh… and get you some painkillers. Sound good?” He knew he was rambling, but the way Angel was staring at him was disconcerting, to say the least.
After pouring himself a large glass of whiskey, and taking a long sip that burned his throat, Dean picked up the remote control, and began flipping through the channels on his TV. And of course… there was an episode of
cared about him, Dean began to bob his head with enthusiasm. He would kiss him later. His hands got in on the action too; fondling Cas's balls, and stroking the part of his cock that wouldn't quite fit in Dean's mouth.
“Don’t move until I get the sequence for the wall spikes,” Ed said, altogether too cheerfully, as far as Dean was concerned.
“Benny’s a great guy. You’ll see.” Dean clicked the button on his computer, and let Benny into the building, then went to the front door to open it.
"Hey. So… that was Eileen, my sister-in-law." Dean sat next to Angel and explained. "She's gonna help us," he gestured between them. "Hopefully, I'll find out who you are."
“You’ve gotten all nice and cosy with each other, but you’ve only known Castiel’s name for two days? Something about this doesn’t feel right,
Dean melted into Angel, running his hands through that gorgeous mop of hair, and tasting the sweetness of those lips he’d wondered about so many times.
Dean began to wonder if giving Angel a beer had been a good idea. He’d taken one sip, but hadn’t touched it since. He got up and went to the kitchen, coming back with the bottle of orange juice and a glass. “Help yourself,” he urged, as he sat back down.
Loki was still talking, and this time Dean clearly heard what he said, “Blood and pain as you can not imagine.”
“It's getting hotter out here,” Ash continued, clearly relishing in his task now. “Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! Let's hear a warm welcome for Beth Roadhouse, Jo Harvelle!
Angel’s smile reappeared, and he blushed adorably. Dean found that pretty funny, considering what they’d gotten up to last night. “You going all bashful on me, Angel?”
They did as Dean instructed; then, after he’d grabbed a box of tissues and passed it around, he seated himself in the chair, and began talking. “This is what I know, based on Cas’s police statement.”
One by one, they slowly stepped forward, and Dean encouraged them all to hold hands and bow, before pulling them into a huge group hug.
Dean was about to place his hand on top of Castiel’s, but Crowley chose that moment to accept that they were in actual Heaven,
Dean stood rooted to the spot, staring at Cas and willing him to make the right decision, but bracing himself for the worst. If Cas wanted to go, who was Dean to stop him? It was time Dean faced facts, and accepted that Cas could do b-
Now though... now he’d had enough of ignoring his feelings. Being in such close proximity to Dean while they went through the obstacle course had set his attraction to Dean aflame, and the sense of euphoria when the samulet had recharged the Hand of God had caused an immense stirring inside him. He gazed deeply into Dean’s eyes and moved into his personal space, and as the air around them became charged, Castiel knew what he had to do.
“I said, "I'm not Dean Smith,” Dean repeated, picking himself off the floor and rubbing his stomach. Man, that punch really hurt. “Leave them alone. There's no reason to hurt them. They don't know anything,” He said, attempting to appeal to Loki’s better nature (not that he’d seen any sign of it) on the angels’ behalf.
“Don’t go anywhere,” Dean said, as he opened the door and went back out into the rain. He wasted no time in opening the trunk and pulling out the coat, despite the driving rain and the ever-strengthening wind, and within seconds he was back inside the car.
