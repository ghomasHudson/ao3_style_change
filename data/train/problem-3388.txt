They leave within minutes, and an hour later when the sun begins to set, they find the secluded house they’ve been searching for. It’s quiet and eerie, and it seems as though no one’s home but Dean knows better than to take a missing car in the driveway as confirmation.
The hotel room they stay at is quite big with two double beds sitting right beside each other, separated by a small, varnished Oakwood bedside table. On the other end of the room is a round table set with a vase decorated with plastic sunflowers that Cas is mindlessly fiddling with as he watches Dean undress himself behind the ajar bathroom door.
"I figuered you'd need sleep since you're human now" After a while of doing nothing Dean decides on showing Castiel what he's been working on while he was gone. They're standing at the entrance of Dean's room and Castiel listens attentively to the adjustments Dean has had to make over the weekend to make sure that the room could cater for Castiel as well.
Dean can never not be fascinated by them, they’re like a thousand ravens huddled up on the man’s back, each feather smooth and glistening like silk underneath the dim lighting.
Within a few days of driving and taking every stop they can find to rest and indulge in each other’s bodies; they finally end up back at the bunker with Sam and Jack waiting for them with a warm meal set on the dining table.
It got better and yet worse as time went by. Better because he could breathe again. He could smile without feeling guilty and he could talk about moving on, about finding a normal job and a small home where he could live with miracle. Worse because Cas was still gone and that never-ending void in his heart and his soul was still there. Nothing made it better, nothing could make it better. Cas left and took a part of Dean with him, a part of him that he could never get back. He couldn’t do much but ignore it, pretend like it wasn’t there and maybe as time goes he’d forget it was there in the first place.
His hand itches to be held again, and somewhere in the back of his head, he hopes to go back in time just a few seconds and instead of saying nothing, he’d pull Dean close and let their lips dance together.
They’re in an open field surrounded by white and bright yellow wildflowers, their petals flying off as the hunter and his angel soar through the field pretending to fly. It’s silly and it makes them laugh but they don’t stop.
He pushes himself up and launches forward to where the shotgun is, he fires, first at the ghost, to save Dean, and then at David to slow him down and keep him from doing anything stupid.
“Dean, I’m so sorry" He didn’t know what to do or where to even stand as his face contorted with guilt and pain.
The music is loud and catchy, the beat and the lyrics about being someone’s end game and first string—whatever that means— appealing to Dean, forcing him out of his seat and over to a clear space where he can move as freely as he wants. He doesn’t realize what he’s doing, if he had he wouldn’t be dancing in a room full of strangers, carefree like there’s no tomorrow. Castiel watches in complete fondness, the alcohol not working quick enough for him to join the hunter on the dancefloor.
"Dean" Castiel's hand tentatively rests on Dean's knee, getting the human to turn and face him. His eyes matches Dean's, both drenched in pain and heartache and as if everything else wasn't enough to handle Castiel has to try and convince the man he loves that he's not going to lose him again not even 24 hours after already losing him.
Dean let go and they both looked to Sam, a petrified one. He still hadn’t processed his brother slipping away a few moments ago. It was beyond traumatizing and not even Castiel’s appearance could shake it right away.
Jack disappeared and Castiel revealed himself to the Winchesters. They were struck but neither of them had the capability to react to him.
“I just wanted to check on you.” Sam says before Dean could even begin to express his agitation. He makes sure to keep his distance, wanting Dean to invite him over and willingly tell him what the matter is.
“How about we go back to our room? We’ve had a long day; I think we deserve some pizza and a movie.” Dean suggests and lets his hand fall back down to his side. The warmth his hand provided is replaced by coolness and an emptiness Castiel wishes he could tuck away.
Their clothes come off easily and before they know it, they’re making love, with Dean beneath Castiel, moaning his name into damp skin while his strong arms wrap around Castiel’s body, as if to urge him to go deeper into him.
“You don’t think we should stay here?” Cas looks around to the chaos around them. He knows there’s nothing left for them to do, but still, he can’t help but want to turn the world upside down and find this killer.
“I don’t know but Cas and I are gonna have a word with his parents.” He gives a serious answer this time and gives Castiel a pat on the thigh before standing to his feet.
They don’t know how they ended up here but they’re glad they did. This moment so pure and precious that it’s already embedded deep into their souls and that whenever they feel alone all they need to do is just close their eyes and dream.
“I love them,” Cas interjects, his words as sure as the first ones he’d offered to his fellow angels after rebuilding Dean with his own two hands.
They were in Ohio, fighting against one of the last vampires to exist on earth, they just didn’t know it yet. It was rather difficult for Cas to watch and not put himself in between the Winchesters and the fanged monsters. He just had to watch, no matter how bad it got, all he could do was watch.
They’ve contacted Sam about thirty minutes ago and he helped with the tedious work Dean refuses to do. “You won’t ever make it in this line of work.” Castiel remembers teasing when Dean picked him up and lifted him so high that it felt like he was flying again.
“How about you give me a kiss as compensation.” Dean smirks when they get to his car. They both get in and Cas doesn’t waste any more time as he hovers over the gearshift and places a soft kiss against Dean’s lips.
Castiel growls out in both pain and pleasure and a few thrusts later he feels himself pooling deep inside of Dean, the thrill sending a wave of chills down his spine. Dean follows suit and spills all over their bellies, but he couldn’t care less about the mess as Castiel’s soft lips closes around his own, muffling out his screams.
“You don’t have to be so mean to him.” Cas speaks the minute that they step out of the diner. The air around them is warm, and the sun is at its peak, greeting them with sharp and blinding rays of light.
Dean licks his lips, and Castiel stands to his feet, not caring if he’s a little too buzzed to do it on his own. He manages though, almost like every ounce of alcohol has vacated his body.
He can’t find his gun anymore, and when the ghost appears in front of him once more, he feels the air begin to leave his body. Castiel's eyes widen, and they start to look for the shotgun but before he does, David catches him off guard and shatters a glass vase over his head. If it were any other day, he’d let himself fall to the floor and writhe in pain, but not today, not when he’s sure he can still feel the last bit of grace flowing around in him, not when Dean is being killed right in front of his eyes.
“You’re whole again, Castiel" Jack spoke and Castiel frowned. He wasn’t the same Jack anymore and the angel could feel it. He would have been sad if he knew how to. He still couldn’t feel a thing, all he could do was process the information of that loss.
Dean turns his gaze from his brother and takes a second to wonder if Cas had given them away, if he told Sam about what he said this morning. It’s possible, but Dean knows that no matter what hell Castiel goes through, he’d suffer it alone if it meant keeping Dean’s secret safe. His lips almost twist up with gratitude, but they stop somewhere in the middle of it, realising the pain that Cas must be going through right now.
Miracle, could sense his sadness and it wanted nothing more than to take it away as it cuddled up against his new owner and licked his face. It brought comfort to Dean, it was the only thing that brought him comfort since Castiel died. It wasn’t the comfort and love he craved for but it numbed some of the pain and he was grateful for that, grateful that he could breathe, even when it was just for a moment. A moment felt like an eon after all.
He doesn’t say a thing as he forces Castiel to climb off of him. The air around him is thickening by the second, and he can’t seem to breathe anymore. “Cas, I—” he falters, refusing to look at him while he speaks.
It was a day well spent and despite the awkward last moment of it, it didn’t tarnish the beautiful memories they’ve made and promised to hold onto until they no longer can.
“Cas?” he tried looking at him without passing out. His head hung back heavy as he locked eyes with the angel. It was truly him. He could feel it, not only with the touch of his hand but with his soul. His broken soul felt whole again.
But even as they’re standing there, Jess starts to think. About everything—the blood, the fire, the sulphur smell she couldn’t get out of her clothes. She thinks about the hands pulling her out, the way sam looked.
She nods, however hesitant. “The nightmare. It was about Sam, you know, that night. and I was there on the ceiling thinking that shouldn’t have been me.”
It’s then, when he passes the library mirror, that he sees his reflection out of the corner of his eye. Cas’ handprint is still there on his jaw—stark red, slightly pinking around the edges. Dean’s breath catches. The handprint never fails to surprise him. He catches glimpses of it everywhere he looks—the car, the kitchen, the television screen.
Sam—well, Sam is gone. He’s gone. Jess had come back from a midnight snack run to find Sam pinned to the ceiling. All she can remember is the hot lick of flames and hands pulling her out the collapsing door. And, and there’s nothing left. Not anymore.
Cas. Covets. Dean fucking Winchester’s bread. There’s sounds coming out of Cas’ mouth that he didn’t think he could make. When he reaches for the butter, it’s the perfect combination. He needs to save some of it or else it’d be gone in under an hour.
Cas leans forward, the smell of sourdough too enticing to give up. The pattern though—it’s scored to look like a bee. The beekeeper looks up at his fellow vendor, confusion written all his face. He hadn’t expected this.
“It’s a Chinese dish I learned from my neighbor during my twenties. It’s called dàn bǐng, which means it’s egg wrapped up in a scallion pancake. Do you like it?”
But something about it doesn’t feel normal, feels safe. Everything feels unnatural, like she’s not in her own skin. Tearing herself free of her sheets, she stumbles her way over to the window, trying to get fresh air.
Cas gathers the bloody hands in both of his, examining the cuts. “I did not ask you what you wanted, Dean Winchester, I asked you what you need.” The other man hisses in pain as Cas prods the open wounds.
Cas tilts his head, a slight smile on his face. There’s a pause as he thinks for a moment before saying, “Yes, Dean. I’m good. Thank you.”
The memory stings, like so many things do. But Dean looks at Sam, then at the bowl of rice on the floor. At how he’s created something from fragments. And, god, yes he might have bastardized it, but
It’s funny, this bereftness. Dean has never believed in angels. Never believed in them watching over him. Dean believes in ancestors. It’s one of the reasons he’s clung so heavily to Mary, completing rituals with no incense and scattered rice. His ancestors protect him.
Cassie’s backing away, though she’s still facing Dean. She has to get to her next class. Dean knows this.
Dean’s eyes fly open, emotions like pain  and worthlessness flitting across his face. He tries to turn away, but Castiel holds still. Makes Dean look at him.
He remembers the way he clutched the back of Sam’s jacket. And then Sam,  slouching against Dean—chin to shoulder—not registering anything.
But Dean walks out of the room Cas is in, takes up residence in the part of the bunker Jack hasn’t even explored yet.
“When a temple is a place of worship,” Cas continues, “the tenderness with which we perform certain actions is tantamount. To show love, devotion. Do you understand?”
Dean taps the wheel. “Been taking care of her since I was 16 and started to drive. Fixed her up from a junk pile in my uncle Bobby’s scrapyard.”
Golden light fills the room as Cas heals Dean and suddenly the weight on Dean’s chest feels a bit lighter, his breathing less shallow from the broken ribs. The sensation makes the man rock back, eyes finally closing, as flesh knits itself back together.
Dean moves closer to Cas, eyes soft. There’s a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “I’m going to kiss you?”
But it’s also different now. He feels Cas draw himself up into a sitting position. Fingers gently grasp his chin, directing him to look at the other person.
There’s no significant reason why Cas shouldn’t be able to respond, but he’s opening his mouth and nothing’s coming out.
There’s a sharp silence that stretches out before them—Dean pursing his lips, staunchly looking away. If only he looked back at Cas, he would see the other man’s cheeks reddening.
The beekeeper looks over at Dean, eyes wide, and back down to their clasped hands. They’re holding hands. They’re holding hands and it’s nice.
Cas is at the pantry, looking for the right type of honey. What did he give Dean last time? He reaches back to grab one of the last remaining jars.
Cas thought he would send the baker off with a couple of honey jars and hope that he used them. Exchange done, they go their separate ways; Cas takes care of Dean from a distance, like orbiting a sun, but in no danger of getting hurt.
Cas leans down to kiss either of Dean’s cheeks. It’s not something he does often, the gesture (like most things) too intimate for them in outside settings. But here, here they are safe. Here, Dean can relax.
All the honey jars are unpacked now, and Dean wanders back to his own booth, sending finger guns Cas’ way while walking backwards.
“No, we’re good,” Dean continues, shutting the menu and tugging the other from Castiel’s grip before handing it back to the waitress. He can feel Castiel’s gaze on him.
Dean is asleep on the bed, legs akimbo but hands clenching the pillow. He’s likely in the throes of a nightmare. Cas strides forward, one hand outstretched to dispel them. The angel’s hand goes so far as to sink into the short hairs at Dean’s nape before the man snaps up, a gun in hand.
Something’s changed since Cas’ death. It doesn’t look like a home. It looks devoid of light, of warmth. Dean hasn’t stepped outside his room. Every time he tries, the bunker seems too vast, too cold.
“No time. Traffic was killer on the way in. I’m about 30 minutes late in set-up.” Dean gestures to the rest of the table, bags of full loaves haphazardly tossed on top. “Look at it. It’s a disaster zone.”
The exclamation doesn’t make Dean move back in, but the shiver that runs through Cas at the next gust of wind does. It shouldn’t be this cold, but Cas figures the drive from his house to the farmer’s market chilled him more than he suspected. There’s a reason he’s always bundled up in sweaters.
Cas sets the thermos down with a massive thunk. “Did you not use the honey? Your voice still sounds like
“Not at all.” Cas fidgets before continuing with, “It’s in the kitchen if you’d like to eat it now.”
“I haven’t asked for anything.” This anger is familiar. “Not a single, goddamn thing. You angels wanted my body, wanted to dress me up like a Ken doll. You
Dean gently smiles, dragging his hands down the sleeves of the jacket one last time before moving away and rummaging for something underneath the table. After a few seconds, he pulls out an umbrella.
. In fact, he desperately wants to stab something or, at the very least, send Dean a strongly worded anonymous note to cease and desist.
But even though the heating has kicked in, Cas still feels cold. He presses his hands together, trying to get feeling back into them.
It just happens that it wasn’t hate at all. Dean Winchester is a menace, and Cas loves him for that.
There’s a silence that blankets the room, makes Dean silently wish he hadn’t said anything. Words aren’t his friend most days and today is no exception.
, but it seems more a lie than ever before. Cas sees it in the way that Dean holds his body, the way he will deny himself what he truly desires. Cas has only known the man for a year or so, but even he knows this.
They stare at each other, Cas fidgeting under Dean’s ministrations. By now, Dean has slid his hand down Cas’ arm to run his thumb over Cas’s knuckles softly. As if to soothe the other man.
“Sure!” The baker’s voice is raspy—didn’t Cas give him honey to deal with that already? “Cas, where’s your honey dipper?”
It doesn’t make it hurt any less. The nurses come in and they poke and prod, asking questions with fake smiles like they can pretend everything’s fine. Like he didn’t get electrocuted.
The realization makes the breath catch in Cas’ chest. Because just like Cas can’t tell Dean how much he covets his bread, the beekeeper can’t tell Dean that perhaps he covets the baker as well.
“When I pulled you out of Hell, it was with a purpose. When I pulled you out of Hell, it was a battle. From the moment I touched your soul, something changed. I did not come all this way, I did not start having doubts for this. To have you view yourself as this unworthy. Do you understand, Dean Winchester?”
, she’ll call him when he reaches up and clasps her face between chubby hands. There’s something about this moment that never escapes Dean, even as he forgets how she looked, the way she did up her hair.
Dean draws back, moving one hand to clasp the back of Cas’ neck. “Me? I told you, Cas, I’m fine. That half hour on your couch? Best damn sleep I’ve had in months.”
Shaking her head, she turns to look out the window, resting her head against the cool glass. Jess hears Dean clear his throat.
Dean gives a half-smile, a consolation even as he claps his hands together in anticipation. “Hey, it’s fine. Let’s see what you’ve got; I’m starving!”
The baker quickly unlocks the door, guiding Cas in and walking over to the other side. When he slides into the front seat, he’s smiling and running his hands over the steering wheel. Cas thinks the car must mean an awful lot to him, but he’s still unsure why they moved and voices his concern as such.
“We were in Jericho.” Dean is still going. “Hunting a woman-in-white. Scorned woman type of ghost. Everything was fine, though my headlight’s still busted.”
He narrows his eyes suspiciously at that. Of course Dean would be good at kissing as well. Not that Cas needed a lot of convincing.
Jess bites her lip. Looks away. She looks at Dean, at anywhere other than the man in front of her. It’s too soon to do this—to face the truth, to understand Sam's not coming back.
Dean’s speechless. There are no words for this moment, for what he can have for the rest of his life. He’s never been particularly good at words, at articulating what he feels. It’s always been easier to reach out and do things. All action, no words. It’s easier to jump into bed than deal with the consequences of his emotions.
Dean lifts his head, looking back at Castiel and the hopeful expression on his face. He likes what he sees. For some unnameable reason.
He remembers Jack rushing forward for a hug even while Cas was struggling to get into a sitting position. Sam swooping in with a blanket.
The beekeeper nods again, waiting patiently with the cup held in both hands. The cocoa’s heat makes him shiver again, and Dean places a firm hand on his back to steady him.
“Dean, please.” Neither him nor Cas are young men anymore; staying here certainly guarantees back pain when he wakes up.
But despite a general lack of awareness in regards to coats and cold weather, Dean is—well, he’s Dean. It looks like he should be brusque and burly at first glance—large shoulders and beard—but then there’s the way that his crow’s feet appear whenever he smiles, and the small grey flecks in his beard. It makes him look kinder.
“Can I try? The raspberry honey with the bread.” Another voice made them both turn around. A blonde-haired woman stood in front of the table—Cas’ first customer of the day.
When Michael appears in a flash of light, Dean’s ready. The archangel doesn’t seem frightening anymore; he just seems human. Dean looks at Adam’s face and thinks about a time where they could have all been brothers.
She cups the back of his head as he closes his eyes, relishing the contact. Dean can feel her staring at him.
It makes Dean run a hand down the sleeve before he clasps their hands together. There’s a quick glance down as Dean rubs his thumb across Cas’ bare knuckles.
She lifts her hands up to her face, trying to see what it is. Oh god—it’s blood. Red, red, red. There’s a sharp pain, like something’s tearing her apart.
Dean puts an arm around her, helping her to her feet. The gesture feels more comforting than Jess originally thought it would be.
It’s a startling thing to realize. Cas is gone. And for some reason, this feels different. Maybe it’s because it’s Chuck or this big ending or the way that their existence has been reduced down to a deity’s plaything.
Jess closes her eyes. She thinks about how her grief will swallow her whole. Are answers worth this?
Dean’s voice is too earnest. But he hasn’t felt this way before, hasn’t known that love could feel this way. The girl in front of him is amazing. She’s just Cassie. Cassie the journalism major. Cassie whose eyes he falls into every time he catches her gaze.
Cas relaxes his grip, moving his hand to cup the underside of Dean’s jaw. He steps closer still. Cas wants and wants and if given permission, he’d take. “Is this what you want? Need?”
Dean braces himself, ready to throw a punch, but they’re too many. He gets shoved, then shoved again.
So he walks, walks out of the hospital and up on stage, and even when he seems healthy again—well, the touch doesn’t stop hurting.
Cas, if he thinks about it, could probably say he’s screwed. To feel this in love with the baker and not be sure of the other man’s feelings. At least, for this moment, he’s content just being by his side.
Dean crowds closer to Cas, hands hovering over the lapels of the trench coat, about to push him out. He forgets that Castiel is only in a vessel, that the angel’s power is incomprehensible to humans.
Cas sweeps a hands out towards the other vendors and the stall. “Our communal bread. The farmer market’s bread.”
So the baker takes Cas back to the market. So he helps him secure the honey jar crate onto the back of the scooter with the bungee cords. So Cas would think that’s where it’s going to end.
The words make Cas’ eyes soften. There’s silence between them, as well as an inexplicable tiredness that drapes over their shoulders. World-weary.
They are driving back from the hellscape of the broken town, the slow rumble of the Impala’s engines a soothing lullaby. Cas is in the backseat, having decided to accompany the brothers back to Bobby’s house. Dean’s knuckles are white around the steering wheel, jaw clenched tight.
Cas makes the accident of looking down at Dean’s lips. A brief thought of how they might kiss flashes through Cas’ imagination.
Dean gives the man a better look—how his hair is matted down, but still dark. The dust on his clothes, the way his shoes are broken at the seams. Something definitely happened.
Clearing his throat, Dean starts with, “Can you get me and my good friend Cas here two breakfast specials?” He looks up to make sure he’s got the waitress’ attention. “And two slices of key lime pie, please.”
His hands tremble, yearning for something to do. He glances at the bedside table, at the new beer bottle. But when he reaches up, the first thing he grabs is the joss paper.
Otherwise, days blur into days. Dean doesn’t see sunlight. He spends hours at a time in the library, reading until he’s blinking the sleep out of his eyes and still keeps going. Everything seems too desperate, and yet, he cannot stop.
All Dean can think about is the way the Empty swallowed Cas, how he could only watch, scrambling to get himself up before it was too late.
Only then can she clearly see the horrified look on his face, staring up at her. But this is wrong. This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. She should be down there.
Cas leverages himself up so he can cradle Dean’s face, thumbs swiping away the tears. “I speak only truth with you. I’ve always tried to. Believe me. You’ve done so before.”
Cas cocked his head, slightly unsettled by the words; he was unsure why Dean would say something like that.
Dean spends what seems like a lifetime digging his feet into the dirt, even though John will likely get mad when they go back to the hotel room. He’s about to call out, bored, when the thing whips past him. It shoves him, hard, and he falls, colliding with a rock.
In the few days between leaving Dean and now, Castiel has made his decision. It is, perhaps, the second one that he can claim as his alone.
A slow smile breaks out on Dean’s face. He brings the thermos up to his mouth, holding it by the lid. Cas is about to throttle him. Could he not just hold it like any other normal person? Before he can think too much about acting on it, Cas turns back to the task at hand. It’s a fair minute before he hears Dean choke and turns to the side, knuckles white around the handle.
“Can I—again.” The words are a demand. Cas steps forward this time, hands braced against Dean’s shoulder, and goes in for a second kiss.
Usually Sam’s words make him see sense, but there’s currently a bullet in him so what exactly does Sammy want him to do?
The question lingers in the air, Dean violently shuddering at the contact. His hands clench into fists. Cas grabs his wrist, pulling him around to look him in the eyes.
Cas fumbles with the crate, grasp ever more precarious. The crate leans forward, the momentum taking Cas with it.
There is no trace of the scared look on Dean’s face. He’s alert. Tired, yes, but ultimately alert, like he’s been all his life.
Dean wraps his arm around Cas as the beekeeper exits the car, drawing him in close to keep the rain off of him. They reach the porch with minimal wetness and the warmth from Dean’s body feels nice. Cas can admit that.  He fumbles with his keys for a minute, letting Dean know it’s okay to put the umbrella on the porch, before opening the door and letting Dean in.
“C’mere.” Dean shrugs out of his leather jacket, stepping forward to bundle Cas in it. It’s heavy, thick, Dean’s warmth still there. The baker tugs it close, then pats Cas’ shoulders. “Better?”
What exists between them is tenuous in the fact it’s new. Dean, for all of his bravado, is scared and wanting. So much so it’s hard to say it out loud.
Cas’ heart is beating so loudly he can hear it thudding in his ears. Both from the fall and the fact that, well, Dean Winchester is holding him. Holding him. Present tense. He scrambles to push himself away—anything to make it less embarrassing—but he’s met with a firm grip and a low voice.
It’s no use. Chin, meet edge of counter. Edge of counter, meet massive amounts of blood. Cas is ready to meet his fate.
Dean remembers it as some distant memory; back when he was four years and still a child, Mary would wrap her arms around him and bundle him upstairs to the ancestor room. In those days, they still had one.
Dean looks over at Sam, all curled in on himself. His shoulders hunch, a defined slouch that Dean knows too well to dismiss. The way he looks at the incense, but turns away from it.
Jess feels so hopeless, abandoned here with a boy and a car and seemingly nothing else. She lets her head fall against Dean's chest. “Please,” she whispers.
But Cas runs a single finger across Dean’s eyebrow, then across a cheekbone, over his lips. Tucks his fingers under the man’s jaw.
It’s the singular question—the one in the whole world that Cas has avoided—come back to bite him in the ass.
Cas is a dead weight in Dean’s arms, no life to him. Dean cannot breathe, too afraid that something has happened.
She had just gone for midnight snacks. And now she’s left with the remnants of her life, all scattered in pieces around her.
Her hands fumble for the window latch, but the first burst of air that meets her face makes her breathe a sigh of relief. She closes her eyes, telling herself to be calm. It's fine. It's fine.
That’s the question that’s haunted both of them over the years—the push and the pull of turning away from each other at their lowest points. Cas walking into the lake. Dean pushing Cas out of the bunker.
“Anyway, I just wanted to drop this off. Little bit of a lull and I don’t think we’ll sell enough of these so—”, Dean trails off, kneading at the back of his neck. An almost shy look crossed his face. “Here.”
mention to anyone besides his friend Charlie, Dean actively gives him a neck massage after complaining of sleeping on it wrong.
. Cas can’t take this today. The idea that he has to interact with Dean and make coherent sentences is more terrifying than anything.
The sudden awareness is jarring. His eyes are wide, heart pounding a little. But then there is this—a hand smoothing over his hair, pressing a thumb to the soft spot behind Dean’s ear.
Cas has to laugh. Of all things—of all things to say when he can clearly see Dean fucking Winchester himself has had little to no sleep.
Before Dean knows what he’s doing, he’s striding over and pulling Castiel into a hug. It’s instinctive to tuck his face into the crook of the other man’s neck.
So Dean keeps avoiding it; if he doesn’t say anything, then it does have to mean anything. They can go back to the way it was before.
Dean grins, the corners of his mouth tugging upwards, as he pulls out a massive sourdough loaf and a slice of pie, pre-packaged with the
The halo around Jack’s neck glows in the dark. It illuminates his face, his eyes, so much so that Dean can see the glimmer of tears, the smile.
When Mary turns to say good night and cradles his face with her hand, he can’t help but follow. It’s been so long since he’s been comforted that way.
Because for a moment, he had it. For a moment, it was all he had hoped for. And he couldn’t even keep it. What good was he if he couldn’t even keep it? What good was he when the whole world was ending and all he did was stand there, too paralyzed by his own needs?
Cas’ voice is sincere in a way that makes Dean shift. He remembers that sort of feeling, can still feel the ache of it now. The loneliness. The way somebody would pay attention to him, the way he craved being seen. It’s something that Dean has always wanted.
Cas’ voice is quiet. Decisive, maybe. “Not again. Not if you promise the same thing.”  He wraps a hand around Dean’s wrist, pulse point against his thumb, before leaving a gentle kiss there.
Dean watches as it alights on his pointer finger, silently waiting. Mary told him about this, when she came back—the moth is a person’s soul, the way they’re visiting the people they leave behind.
It’s gentle, this touch—a brush of fingers against Cas’ jaw; Dean tilts the beekeeper’s head up to view the damage. There’s some blood, his upper lip already swelling up. Dean winces in sympathy.
“No.” The word is final, absolute. Dean pushes away, brushing past her to look at the coffin. Hand over mouth, unbelieving.
The beekeeper stands stock still, eyes wide in shock and immersed in the comforting lull of being kissed
There’s an unsettling feeling that nestles deep in his chest, making him restless even before he’s opened his eyes. Like he already knows something’s wrong. So waking up is a gasp awake, eyes wide and staring at the bed across from him.
Cas clasps a hand around Dean’s wrist, pulls him back towards Cas. “I want you to.” There’s a tense sort of moment when Cas panics about screwing this up.
The expression must be bad for Dean to put the tea and step closer. He crouches down just enough to look Cas in the eyes.
Cas leans in, gently presses a kiss to Dean’s lips. It only lasts for a second, yet Cas draws back to look at Dean; the man follows, drawn in by touch.
They leave, and Dean sits up, trying to triage the situation. His jeans are ripped, a slight cut across the knee. He wonders if the blood will come out.
“Cas,” Dean fixes him with a stare. “No excuses, okay? I’ll drive you back later. It’ll be okay, I just want to get you out of the rain. You tend not to do well in colder weather.”
It takes him a long while to drag himself from the floor, limbs achy and slow. He feels lost. Errantly, he brushes away his tears only to wince at tender skin.
The baker starts to move away, hands slipping from Cas’. Almost immediately, Cas misses the warmth. He wants it back.
Cas shivers yet again under the intensity of the gaze. Dean fucking Winchester with his charisma, with the crinkles around his eyes.
The look on Dean’s face is too earnest. It breaks Cas’ resolve in half. He is sorely, sorely in love with Dean Winchester—a fact that makes him want to yell.
The ex-angel draws back, though not fully separating from Dean, to lay on his side. He coaxes Dean to lay on his tummy, watching how the man’s limbs splay out, vulnerable in a sense that Cas never would have seen before.
Cas really has stared at these too long. Traitorous stomach. It wouldn’t hurt to eat just a little, right?
“It’s fine,” the baker replies, “Benny’s already off-loading our stuff. Wanted to ask you how you liked the bread.”
“Hey, buddy.” Dean’s voice is rough, hoarse with use. Cas’ honey could fix that. If only Dean wants it—Cas had tried once, when he first started out, but Dean just waved him away. So Cas had learned his lesson; even if he still thinks Dean Winchester is gorgeous, he’s absolutely infuriating.
“Awesome! I’ll get you a slice next time we make it then. Just got in a batch of apples from Linda’s Orchard.”
“There’s nothing to talk about.” Dean doesn’t look at Cas; instead, he moves to his bed, fiddling with the bedspread. His heart is pounding so loud he’s afraid the angel can hear it.
Dean has tried to refuse, but both of them are just on the right side of stubborn that everything is a stalemate.
Dean stays. He’s always at Cas’ booth, shoves gloves his way when he sees Cas shivering in the early morning.
Castiel Novak, unfortunately, is not one of those people. It’s been a rough week with a new hive and several queens. He can’t wait to fall into bed. But he’s here. Here, at this ungodly time of day, to sell his honey. And even that mission is being hampered by Dean Winchester.
Cas is grateful for the moment alone; he needs to steel himself. He’s got this. At least, he thinks so.
“Guess that was implied.” The words leave him in a singular breath. “Does that—does that mean you’re staying?”
Embarrassment floods through Cas, so much so that he turns to go. He just isn’t expecting to hear what Dean says next.
“I’ll drive you. I can—anywhere.” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets to stop fidgeting. He looks away from Castiel, unnerved.
Dean draws Cas close, cradling him, forehead to forehead. He brushes Cas’ hair away from his forehead.
Dean looks up at the words. It’s some sort of sweet talk, this—but even as he looks back at Cas, at the sincerity in his gaze, that he means it.
Dean turns around, rummaging in his bag before turning back to Cas with tan gloves in hand. What’s next is simple, like something they’ve always done—Dean tugging the glove upwards, making sure everything’s in its proper place.
The baker raises one hand in defeat. “All right, all right. Not talking smack. I like Baby better though.”
Dean grins, a half-smile that makes his dimples show. “So, you gonna let me drive you home now? Or would you rather keep shivering to death on your tiny ass motorcycle?”
The man looks up, while his body curls up into a ball to conserve heat. It’s the eyes that strike Dean the most—a vivid, stark blue. Dean thinks he’ll remember the color of those eyes until he’s in the ground.
Cas would think that Dean hates the cold as much as he does, except the flannels are never buttoned. It doesn’t make sense!
“It’s okay, Dean. Beloved, it’s okay. Just breathe.” Cas’ voice is rough like it always is, but it’s calming, like it always is. Dean breathes out, slowly. He closes his eyes. Focuses on what he feels in the moment, like the motion of Cas carding his fingers through Dean’s hair.
A shot of light emanates from behind him. Dean and Cas are pulled back into the Bunker, covered in black ooze. Dean breathes out hard. Cas is unresponsive above him.
The other man avoids Dean’s questioning look, eyes fixated on his shoes instead.  “I wouldn’t leave without saying thank you.”
Cas swallows hard. He’s torn between telling Dean or not telling him. In seconds, Cas flicks his eyes down to the carrier bag he’s stashed the gloves in. Flicks his eyes back to Dean and how he’s holding Cas’ hands.
The words are slow to start, like they always are. “媽媽,” Dean whispers, and every emotion inside of him spills out. “媽媽, 請保護我. 讓我身體健康， 滿心愛了。請不要讓我繼續帶著這份悲傷。 Mom, I’m tired. But I’m going to do this thing—I’ve got to do it because it’s Cas. It’s Cas, Mom. And I can’t leave him there. I can’t—I gotta try.”
Dean looks across the table at Castiel, a small grin tugging at the corners of his lips. There’s something peculiar about the guy—just a funky, little dude—in the way he takes everything so seriously. Even now, he’s staring at the menu in such concentration.
He can vaguely hear Dean talking again, so he tries to focus on that. Even now, Dean’s palm is a warmth at his back.
The look on Dean’s face is incredulous and Cas has a moment of smug satisfaction that he has made Dean Winchester speechless. As well as paid his debts. Two birds with one stone. Now he can go back to the conformable animosity that exists purely within his head. He does
Cas directs him to the kitchen, telling him to sit down. He can hear the plate being dragged across the table, but Cas is on a mission. Dean’s voice still carries that rasp and if Cas swears by anything holy, he is going to fix it, so help him.
He looks peaceful, but Cas can see the dark circles underneath his eyes. Likely a result from waking up at 4:30; after all, fresh bread doesn’t bake itself. Cas moves toward him, careful not to make any loud noises.
“Oh.” The word resonates throughout the car. It seems louder than it should be. In all this time, Cas hadn’t really thought about the possibility of Dean paying attention to him the way Cas does Dean. “You’re right.”
The breath that escapes Dean is sudden, harsh. He cannot look away from Cas, rapt with attention. He also wants to look away. Cas does not let him.
For the first time that he can remember, he’s not worried all the time. He’s not afraid that something’s going to come and snatch the people he loves most out of his hands.
“I’m glad I could help you.” Cas pauses, and he holds Dean’s eyes, unflinching. “It makes my fall matter.”
He doesn’t like being surprised. And he doesn’t like being surprised by things that remind him of bad times.
“Oomph.” Cas says when Dean falls forward onto him, face pressed against Cas’ shoulder and hand still holding his. He feels Cas’ body vibrating and thinks he might be trying not to laugh. Dean wants to tell him this isn’t a funny-drunk. He wants to say, I had to stand in the spot I let you go today. His fingers are curling into Cas’ coat and he wants to tell him, I remember the smell of this burning. He’s trying to stand and tell Cas that he relived one of the worst moments of his short life and it made him furious and how little he got to live all over again. But he can’t quite get the words out.
“It’s just… I’ve still only seen him the one time after I got here. What’s he been up to?” If Dean doesn’t know, then there’s something weird going on. Sam’s always been a little jealous at how connected Cas is to Dean, not in a horrible way, but sometimes he wonders if it’s another thing he missed out on thanks to Azazel’s interference. He shakes his head to clear out the thoughts. These are just longstanding insecurities that bubble up, he reminds himself.
… The windmill is still fucking there. It’s standing in the early morning mist, surrounded by its goddamn fairy tale greenery, just mocking him.
Sam gestures that he’s going to take a look around back and Dean reaches for the gun that should be at his waist. But of course, it’s not there. Who needs it in heaven?
Sometimes, Dean remembers who he used to be. He remembers the worthlessness that used to look back at him from his reflection, the anxiety he had around people he cared about, how every person in his life felt temporary.
Dean reaches up to clasp the hand Cas has out, and he tries not to squeeze too tightly when Cas pulls him up. He knows he’s probably mostly dead weight and he can’t quite get a handle on his legs.
He’s there now, sitting, content, the heat of the sun roasting the back of his neck, the hum of wind in the grass and bugs fluttering over the water provides a soundtrack he can fall asleep to. He hasn’t caught anything since he started doing this, but it doesn’t really matter. It’s not about the catch. It’s about turning it all off.
“I’ve never really had a space that was my own before,” Cas starts awkwardly, looking away from Dean. “But this felt right.”
“I don’t want an apology. I’m not — I’m not trying to bring up crap for the sake of what was or what shoulda been. I’m — Cas, I’m, look, Cas you saw me. I’m trying to say you spent 3 minutes with me and saw right into my damned soul.”
Sam turns to head inside, letting the door close behind him. He pauses to look back out, through the screen, at Dean opening the door to the Impala. His eyes widen when Dean jumps in surprise, and Sam sees that Cas has shown up. He’s about to shout a greeting when Cas reaches a hand up and cups Dean’s cheek.
“And you think I’m handsome, too. Otherwise you wouldn’t—” Dean stands up, grabs Cas’ hand again, and pulls him towards the house. He hears Cas’ rough laughter from behind him.
Dean can feel his cheeks heating up. He furrows his brow and looks away at the lake. He’s not used to this.
“I – Look, there’s a lot we don’t know about how all this works, that’s all I’m saying.” Sam shrugs, willing to accept mysteries more easily than Dean. He thinks it probably has something to do with Sam getting live and grow out of the need to know in a way that Dean never got to. He takes a deep breath and tries to ignore that thought. It’s not fair, and it’s something that hasn’t bothered him in a long time.
because you two idiots have to shine on a spotlight on something that just is and is fine.” Cas gives him a small, knowing smile. Sam just shrugs, unapologetic. Dean glowers and turns back around to the grill. “Now, where the hell’s the meat, Sammy?”
He resisted the urge to pull the neck of his shirt down to look for a mark — there wasn’t anything there. No scar, no shadow, no nothing. Just a phantom pain, a remnant of something that was.
He slid behind the wheel and flinched a little at the sudden sharp pain in his shoulder. It was worse today. Harder to ignore.
Now, he stares at Dean, asleep in bed next to him. His breathing is easy, his face completely devoid of worry and fear. Like so many humans, he looks younger in sleep. He is, Castiel knows, an objectively attractive man. He follows the pleasing features along Dean’s face — from his sharp jaw to his fine lips, high cheek bones and long lashed eyes. But that’s not what Castiel thinks of as beauty.
“Cas,” he says instead, “This is–” What? He’s not even sure. He and Cas have been on opposite ends of things before, but this is giving him whiplash.
“Whatever, it was funny.” He pushes the recliner back, knees popping as he stands. “Alright, I’ll get out of your hair. But we’re picking this back up tomorrow. Don’t be a bitch about it.”
“That I understood what I meant when I thought of love. You were the closest to me outside of Sam, and I had to figure out what that meant to me. But I needed a push and you gave it to me.” He takes a sip of his brew, it’s heavy and dark, just like he likes it. And he grins. “I don’t know if you know this, but I’m a stubborn bastard, Cas. I’m a man of habit.”
Well, he had half that, at least. He twisted the top of the bottle that had appeared in his hand and took a deep swing. It was hoppy and bitter and suited his mood.
Cas takes Dean’s hand like it’s nothing out of the ordinary and like this isn’t a monumental thing he’s doing.
“What in the hell – ” Dean rubs a hand behind his head and looks out at his backyard. It mostly looks the same as he had when he and Cas had gone to bed. There’s a pile of lumber and some wooden boards for the shed that was coming up in pieces in the front yard. His cooler is still out there, and the low chairs he had for when he wanted to fall asleep in the sun without waking up with a crick in his neck. But… he did not know what to do about the space just beyond what he thought of as his property.
Everything outside has ceased to exist, there is just Dean and Cas and whatever comes next. Dean knows that Cas will never move first, not here. And so, it’s Dean who decides and chooses and leans. It’s Dean who pulls Cas in and puts his mouth to his.
Dean fights the indignation rising in his gut. Considering it’s been a considerable amount of time… he knows they’re not wrong. But
As if summoned, Cas flutters in, already sitting in the empty chair next to Dean’s, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He’d never taken to the beer, preferring a smoother tilt of a drink he’d concocted, he says, specifically for his kind.
“Real mature, man.” Sam rolls his eyes and turns on the TV. “Fine, if you don’t want to talk about it, we don’t have to talk about it.”
“Okay, chuckles, you and me. I’ve killed things that eat you for breakfast, let’s see what you got.” He laughs at his own joke.
said anything — to each other. People who are so close, the words fall out of their mouths without hesitation because who needs hesitation when you have the confidence of love.
They get to the door, which wouldn’t open yesterday, but doesn’t seem to be an issue now that Cas is here. Inside, it’s surprisingly cozy. Dean looks around, it doesn’t not remind him of his room in the Men of Letters bunker, if cleaner and warmer. There’s a bed, a desk. Dean sees a tape deck and bites back a strange laugh.
“We both what, Cas? Have seen each other broken and beat to hell enough that little blood should be fine? What are you going to tell me next? I shouldn’t worry?” Dean rolls his eyes and turns his back, heading towards his front door.
A few days later, Dean’s in the garage next to his home, legs sticking out from under a battered old Ford. He thinks back to Cas’ question about time. Dean wanted a clock because Dean wanted normalcy, and the life he didn’t get to have on earth. That meant time, and limits, and small things going wrong. So that the good things could matter.
I'm still here! Still avoiding the real world by living in my version of Dean Winchester's slice of heaven. Thank you for all the lovely comments and for reading my writing exercises <3 <3
It’s the same reason he started working on cars again. What do you do when there’s all the time in the world, but a limited amount of action? How do you keep going?
He shrugs out of the trench, and his coat, and pulls his shirt up to show Dean that there is no cut skin. But Dean can’t stop staring at the jagged line of torn fabric with a border of blood. He can’t stop staring at the smear against Cas’ skin. He takes a step back, and then two. He lets out a broken breath and is hit with images of Cas covered in blood, memories he tries to forget. Memories he doesn’t want here, with them. Memories that spent so long wrapped around his heart when he was alive, he doesn’t need it
There were strange little ways that heaven fell into the uncanny valley. Dean didn’t get hungry anymore. But that didn’t stop him from eating as many burgers and pie as he wanted. He was at a picnic table on an incline looking over a breathtaking view. A rushing river, a waterfall, and there was an honest-to-God viewfinder like he was just a tourist on a solo road trip to find himself. Whatever the fuck that meant.
I guess this is going to be semi-interconnected one shots for as long as this show won't let me be lol.
His whisper was rough and angry. He bit his lip to stop himself. He shook his head and spoked again.
But Dean still hasn’t learned to get those thoughts out from his heart and into his head. No, instead, they go straight to his tongue to be weaponized. To be protection.
At Cas’ voice, Dean’s head whips around and he stares at the love of his very being. Cas is looking at the windmill, but he doesn’t seem horrified. He seems … happy. His eyes are crinkling, and he’s smiling that smile that Dean adores.
“Does Time have a hot sister?” This time his grin is shit-eating and he waits, but Cas just stares at him blankly.
That makes the corners of his mouth turn up. He’s glad his brother’s here. But he’s not fit for company, tonight. He waves Sam off.
“This is my ideal weekend, dude. Good beer, great movies, all day couch time? Sign me up. That’s heaven.”
“I don’t know. I don’t think so, but only because it wasn’t… it wasn’t even in the realm of possibility for me. It’s not that I didn’t want it, I didn’t know it was there to be wanted. I think there was the beginning of something, maybe. Hell, who can say? I was a different person. You were… you were hard for me to wrap my head around. I tried to think of you as a human, and then you’d turn around and read that woman’s mind and throw the whole night to shits and giggles.”
He shifts his hand and pulls at Cas’ sleeve. Cas leans down and kisses him. Dean hasn’t quite learned to vocalize his wants, this is still all so new, but he finds ways to let Cas know. Cas straightens and looks down at him.
“I don’t know, Sam, and I’m fine. Go – this is probably like you said, just something that’ll come clear later. I’ll see you later.”
Cas nods, like he knows what Dean means, but when he replies Dean’s surprised to hear what he has to say.
Sam’s voice carries from the front, likely standing on his front porch wondering why Dean wasn’t answering the door. Dean grimaces and isn’t sure if he should answer. Not sure if he wants Sam to see –
different. Dean spends more time on the dock outside his home than in the Impala these days. There’s fishing in heaven, who knew?
Dean’s shoulder hadn’t stopped burning since he got to heaven. It was a bitch and a half, but he’d been through worse — plus, didn’t seem like heaven needed doctors so what was the point of complaining about something that couldn’t get fixed?
“I think you and I can categorically say that this is not hell, Dean. Besides, I thought you liked this place. Isn’t that why you picked it for Cas?”
Dean closed his own eyes and moved his hand lower, letting his arm fall across Cas’ chest. He inhaled a deep pocket of air and let the rhythm of Cas’ breathing lull him back to sleep.
“The patties are in that Tupperware.” Sam’s not doing a good job of hiding his laughter, but Dean is determined to ignore it. He pulls the lid off the plastic container and his eyes narrow.
.” Cas’ voice is low and urgent and he’s gripping Dean’s hand so tightly it almost hurts. Dean can’t help but lock in on those sharp blue eyes and then he’s trapped in a space they’ve lived in hundreds of times before.
Sam had showed up not too long back, or maybe really long back, who knows. But he’s got Eileen, and they live just around the corner. Sam asked him, when he got there, if he wanted to move in, and well,
Dean bit the inside of his cheek to keep from teasing his little brother about being whipped too badly. There was time for all that.
“Talk!” Castiel demands and then watches as he pulls a simple black necklace over his head and fiddles with the dove pendant on it, as if saying his last goodbye. He hesitates, but eventually hands it over to Dean who burns it right when the ghost appears again.
Dean quickly pulls away, his lips swollen and his cheeks red as he looks down at his one-button-less shirt. He doesn’t complain though, Castiel could ruin his whole outfit for all he cares.
The words come to him easier this time and he prays to remember them by the time he gets home. He wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t, the sight before him so captivating that he forgets everything else but the blue eyes staring back at him.
“Yahtzee!” Dean clicks his tongue, the sound and face he makes quite sexy, and if it weren’t for the urgency of catching a killer, Cas would have pushed Dean back down on that bed and stripped him naked again.
“Oh, God, thank you, now she can finally stop pouting at me.” Stevie smiles and follows Charlie to the kitchen where the drinks are.
, he thinks to himself, but he couldn’t dare say it out loud, especially not when Cas has his piercing eyes fixed on him like he’s trying to look right into his soul. For all Dean knows, he'd done it before, and he’s doing it right now.
“Seems like, all's well in paradise.” Trainor speaks, confidently. He'd already taken note of the purple marks on their throats, peaking out of their suits, and now the constant smile tugging at Castiel’s face.
“Would it make you jealous if you knew that I praised another man like this?” Castiel’s lips break into a smile.
He paced back and forth before Jack, a series of emotion flowing through him that for a moment, it suffocated him.
But Dean, as he is most days, is oblivious to the silent pleas Castiel throws at him. “It has to be a monster, some demon who enjoys tormenting kids before killing them…” perhaps he’s seen the look in Castiel eyes, but he needed to ignore it because all he can focus on right now is the five kids missing in this city, and the five dead ones they’ve already found, all he can think about is
Like a baby taking it’s first steps, Castiel spoke reluctantly. He was not sure what he would sound like, if his new voice was different from the last but it wasn’t. It sounded the same and every inch of him looked the same.
“Sam, Eileen. I know you two had to fly here all the way from Ireland, you could’ve skipped this one, but you didn’t, so, thank you.” He smiles at them, and they return his gesture. He carries on talking, mentioning Charlie, Bobby, and even Garth, and two minutes later, everyone assumes he’s done.
There was nothing but blackness, so deep and so dark that it felt endless. Along with it was pain, sorrow and regret amplified by a thousand. It felt worse than hell, far worse and Castiel couldn’t believe that he was back there. He felt almost regretful of his last choices as a living being but he knew that if given the chance he would have done it all over again, without hesitation. There was no question to what lengths he would go to save Dean Winchester. He was always willing to put the hunter’s life before his own, believing that it was his destiny, that it always was and always will be.
Eileen appears and takes a seat near Castiel as she signs something about how Charlie can’t get enough of playing with Jack. Dean signs back, slowly and carefully, not wanting to say the wrong thing like he always used to when he first started learning ASL. She chortles at his response and both Dean and Castiel joins her in laughter a second later.
Dean opens the door, and they both muster up their best smiles as they are greeted by their guests. Sam embraces Dean first, like a large puppy, and almost knocks him to the ground. They haven’t seen each other in almost a year, and Sam can’t contain how much he misses his brother.
“You can" a smile formed on Jack’s face and he glanced at Castiel for a moment before looking back to the constantly moulding scenery before him.
“Okay, I’ll be there in jiff,” Dean says, and as if Cas can tell that he’s not done speaking, he keeps the phone by his ear, breathing into the speaker to let Dean know that he’s listening. “I miss you.” The words finally come, and even if Cas tried to hide it from Trainor, he knew he wouldn’t be able to suppress the smile that Dean had put on his face.
About a few hours have passed and Dean has disappeared to the garage where he’s trying to distract himself by cleaning the place up and giving his Chevy a wash. He finishes up sooner than expected and he lets out a frustrated groan as his eyes peer to the watch on his wrist. It’s 5pm and his guests are arriving only at 6pm.
She wants to laugh. Nothing matters. Nothing. Jess doesn’t want monsters; she doesn’t want ghosts or shapeshifters. It doesn’t even seem real. An intrusive thought creeps into her head—
Cas wants to protest, but the prospect of another fall is enough for him to agree. It’s a short walk before Dean is hefting the crate on the table. But then he doesn’t leave. He starts unloading the glass jars, making sure that the labels are facing out.
Dean waits, taps his fingers on the steering wheel. Finally, the guy nods. He clambers up and into the Impala, one hand gripping a tattered backpack with a death grip.
Cas fills the silence. “I know you think you aren’t deserving, but you are.” The ex-angel wraps a hand underneath Dean’s shoulders, a way to keep him together. A slight wetness makes Cas reel back, only to find that a few tears have slipped down Dean’s cheeks.
“That’s pretty Catholic there, man. Thou shalt not covet and all that.” Dean shakes his head. “Don’t know how I’m going to compete with communal bread when I actually made you your own loaf.”
Dean fumbles for his phone, looking at his reflection in the darkened screen. He drags one hand over his left cheek, prods at the raised skin. Absent-mindedly, he thinks about the scar he still carries on his shoulder.
“Good news, Cas! Looks like it’s stopped raining. Want to head back?” Dean doesn’t even wait for an answer before heading towards the front door.
Cas looks over at Sam, asleep next to him, before blinking out and appearing next to Dean. The man is leaning heavily against the door, head bowed, knuckles already bruised and bloody. Cas lays a tentative hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Who are you to decide that? I put you back together. I know you better than you know yourself—I’ve seen all of you. Do you not think that I know whether or not you deserve it? Deserve this?”
But there isn’t time to ask, Dean already pushing away from the table and standing up. The table sways a little. Dean stops. Frowns.
Dean reaches up for another sheet of joss paper. The silence is so loud he can’t hear himself think. One lotus flower becomes two, becomes three.
Cas can feel his cheeks drain completely of blood; the tendency for his face to go completely pale after moments of embarrassment quite apparent now. He wishes he could just sink down into the middle of the Earth.
Dean keeps talking. “If you won’t take care of yourself, what am I gonna do with you, huh?” He steps forward, grips Cas’ wrist and pulls him into a hug.
He makes so much that his hands go numb. Dean drops the one he’s holding; they surround him—piled high and even higher—like they would Cas’ body, if he had anything to bury.
After a moment, he reaches out for it, trying to grasp the long neck. It wobbles, teeters on the edge. For a minute, it’s like the world stills. Dean watches it in slow motion. The beer bottle wobbles for a second more before crashing down to the ground.
Dean had started talking, just to remember how to do it at first. He wasn’t praying, per se, he was just talking. Although, he wasn’t sure if it wasn’t a prayer by default just by virtue of mentioning Cas.
Dean shakes his head. Well, when has it ever been easy? The shoe drops, and he adjusts. He grips Cas’ hand tighter.
. Cas is in and out as frequently as he wants to be, but he’s not living there. He has — Dean isn’t exactly clear on it all, angel quarters? At some point, Cas is going to have to come clean about what his life outside of Dean is like, but Dean’s not ready for that.
“I think bed might be best,” Cas says in response. He pushes Dean up and around and starts walking him away from the windows and towards the king situated on the other side of the room. When they make it close enough, Dean can’t even make himself try and he just falls face first onto the mattress. As his eyes close and he starts to leave his day behind, he can feel Cas taking off his shoes and laughing to himself.
. And you matter to me. You —” he falters, takes a quick glance at Cas and then clears his throat once. He will get this out. “I love you.” He rushes ahead then, filling the space with words before it can go all empty in the worst way. In the heaviest way. “I didn’t know what it meant, I didn’t know it was going to be you, I was so damn scared. And you? A friggin’ angel? A celestial being. What’s love to an angel? Sure you were a human for like four seconds, but what can my love mean to—”
Dean sighed and put his head back against the roof of his car. The words slipped out of his mouth unbidden.
“Hey Cas, did you base this on those gas station pies? Where’d this recipe come from? Whose grandma did you rip off?”
Dean frowns and examines the red-tinged splotches on the end of his pointer, not too bad. He turns on the sink and lets the cold water alleviate some of the burn. He rolls his eyes and looks over at the sizzling pan. Turning off the water, he picks up the spatula and glares down at the meat that’s crinkling at the edges, popping and sputtering with hot oil.
Dean’s head doesn’t hurt the next morning like it might have once. A perk, he thinks, of being dead. He blinks blearily, letting the room come into focus. Dean starts to push up from the bed and finds he’s in a black t-shirt and his boxer shorts, his jeans and flannel thrown into a laundry basket in the corner. There’s a shift and Dean looks at Cas breathing easily next to him, mouth halfway open and head cushioned on his arms above the pillow. He smiles softly before he remembers what got him drinking in the first place. He shoots up, grabs the jeans out of the laundry and shoves them on, not bothering to stop to put on his boots as he takes the steps two at time down the stairs and all but sprints to the back door.
They approach the windmill. There’s a garden nearby and Dean looks at it, incredulous. It’s in full bloom with an array of flowers, some he’s never seen before.
Sam waits, but there’s tension in his form and Dean knows he’s ready to move the second the door opens.
There was no response but a rush of wind, some leaves falling and hitting the glass in front of his face.
“This is weird, even for this place.” Sam says, following in Dean’s wake like he had nearly all of Dean’s life.
After that night, Cas had become a champion of sleep. So, now, when he comes into the kitchen, wearing — of all things — Dean’s hotdog pajama pants and a black t-shirt, Dean can’t help the smile that sticks itself to his face.
Cas’ eyes are narrowed, and his head is tilted again, and it’s like they’re back to Dean being a human puzzle that Cas needs to fit together to understand.
“I have…” there’s an awkwardness in Cas’ speech that Dean’s not accustomed to – Cas’ conversational cadence has pauses and hesitations as a rule, but they mean he’s considering the best way to move forward. This feels like something else. Dean turns his whole body towards Cas now, looking at him expectantly, but biting his tongue to give Cas whatever time he needs. Cas gives him an inscrutable look and then changes tracks entirely. “Can we go inside?”
just imagine it and make it show up on the table, but he also needs ways to spend his time, he needs to be
“I don’t know, man.” He says his tone part weariness and part frustration. He doesn’t like being surprised. And he doesn’t like being surprised by things that remind him of bad times. And as much as he’d loved the meadow, leaving Cas’ ashes there had been a bad time.
Sam knows that Dean… well, Dean had a life, which was more than Dean had expected. He wonders if he’ll ever stop being angry on his brother’s behalf. He looks out at the land in front of his house and laughs, but there’s no humor in it. Just bitterness and irony, and maybe a little guilt.
here — he pulled over and got out to stretch his legs. He stood on the gravel on the edge of the asphalt, twisting his head this way and that, pulling kinks out of his joints. The quiet pops sounded loud as hell in the still of his new world. He leaned against his car and looked up at the sky that Jack had built.
“I watched Jack listening to prayers the other day – he doesn’t engage,” he says quickly, at Dean’s look, “He just listens. But it made me wonder… and not for the first time… I’ve thought a lot about why you didn’t pray for help.” He furrows his brow. “Why didn’t you?” he continues, his head tilting to the right and his eyes narrowing. Dean pulls him close again.
“In here!” he calls out to who he assumes is Cas, pleased at how steady his voice sounds. He doesn’t feel steady.
OH WE ARE VERY MUCH STILL HERE living in Dean and Cas' heaven and being happy to do so. I have a bunch of half-started one-shots set in this 'verse that I will hopefully eventually finish. But for now, have some slight angst with a happy ending. Also, this ship will never stop making me feral.
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean realizes that Cas is giving him an out. He tries again and shakes Cas a little.
“I know from experience. But, no.” He takes his hands back and Dean leans forward imperceptibly, following the lost warmth. But Cas just gestures behind them. “
, laughing at Dean’s plea for her to stay because she can stop Sam from complaining about plot holes.
Cas turns and lifts his hands to Dean’s face, his fingers rough against Dean’s skin. He cracks a grin and rubs his thumbs along the hard lines of Dean’s cheekbones.
Sam drops onto the couch, grabs one of the beers Dean brought, pops the tab and takes a sip while looking at his brother sidelong. Dean isn’t looking at him, though, and it feels deliberate.
It’s the slight tremor he hears in Cas’ voice that stops him. And he thinks. It’s been so long since he’s been afraid, truly afraid. Heaven has lulled him into a false sense of security. Cas doesn’t have the privilege of death here. His face pales and he pulls Cas towards him, so close that he can see every worry line etched into his skin. So close that if he lies, Dean will know.
“Cas is fine, he’s doing angel stuff with Jack. They’re still in the process of rebuilding the ranks, I think.”
The next time he stopped, it was near a lake. Could have been anywhere he and Sammy and stopped a million times. Some generic hole in the ground on the other side of the guardrails, with a ring of dirt and grass around it. It was probably beautiful, he thought. But less so on his own, without a beer and family to share it with.
“I don’t think you needed this level of reality, bud.” He let out a small, rueful laugh. “But I guess what’s existence without some flaws. Boring?”
, have a family, be happy, and die an old, old man. He knows that even though it wasn’t the life he thought he’d wanted… it was still a good life.
“Alright, man. Let me know if you need anything, though, okay? Is Cas coming by soon?” Sam asks, not even pretending to be subtle. Dean glares at him.
“Jack is… good.” Dean sees Cas tilt his head out of the corner of his eye, probably deciding how much he wants to share, and Dean is struck with a million memories of seeing him make that exact same gesture. He’s struck with how intensely he knows this person sitting next to him. And he knows it’s probably time.
Apparently, Dean Winchester is still in my head telling me all the shit he's doing in heaven and so here we are because I am still thinking about it.
. Castiel had had his perfect moment of happiness, he had expressed his deepest feelings to Dean Winchester and in doing so saved Dean’s life. It was the happiest he’d ever been. What else could there be?
It’s a familiar sight, something that Dean recognizes within himself—the fumbling of heritage when they should know what to do.
“We usually just cut them in half. But that reminds me—next week we’re making some biscotti. I can do that, you know.”
It’s all the permission Dean needs; he peels away and drives the rest of the way to the motel. He feels somewhat nervous, wholly unsure.
“I didn't ask what they were, I asked what they were for.” Jess’ mouth is dry. It somehow feels suffocating, everything around her like a slow vise. She can’t breathe again. “You said—you said that your dad was on a hunting trip.
Finally—that gets a response. “Do you—do you have water?” It surprises Dean. The guy’s voice is raspy, but much deeper than Dean expected.
Dean hefts Cas closer, getting his arms under Cas’ and dragging him back to where Dean came in from. Light from a small, flickering crack appears; as both of them get closer, it gets bigger, revealing Jack and Sam.
At the funeral, one of her friends slipped her a pamphlet about the five stages of grief. Jess can see them clearly—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
Impatient, Dean tugs the paper bag from Castiel’s clenched fist. Opening it reveals a singular breakfast pastry topped with glazed apple. It takes Dean a minute in his excitement to realize that it’s only
It’s a refrain Sam has repeated over the past month. But sleep is for those who can rest. Sleep is for those who don’t have nightmares.
Dean barks out a short laugh. Stares at the shattered glass. It takes a moment for the shock to settle in, hands tugging at his hair.
It's only now that Jess realizes that she’s run out in her pajamas. She looks down at her hands, expecting them to be bloody.
But Castiel goes anyway. The more he thinks on it, the more he contemplates about what has just occurred—the worthlessness that Dean feels, the events leading up to devil’s trap breaking, the way he rushed in at the first cry that made its way out of Dean’s mouth, the way
When Cas asks Dean, this is what he means. And still, there is nothing, only what can pass as silent glances between the two of them.
It should have felt right. It should have felt like a new beginning. But Dean remembers seeing Sam and Jack and Cas and how they fit well together. Like a family.
There’s the sound of thunder roaring in her ears and an acrid taste in her mouth. She turns her head to one side, wishing that it didn’t remind her of blood so much. Sounds—something like heavy-soled boots—keep her grounded. She digs her hands into the wet grass, shivering despite the warm night.
A warm, familiar weight drops onto his shoulders. It’s Dean. The baker makes sure to pat Cas’ shoulder, like he always does now.
Dean’s cheeks turn slightly red. The baker backs away, slipping his hand out from under Cas’ and picking up the thermos with a mild look of distaste.
Dean draws closer. He starts rambling, tripping over his words. “We hunt monsters. Ghosts, shapeshifters, you name it. It’s real—it’s real, all of it.”
Mostly, these sounds become songs. Led Zeppelin sometimes, Queen others, but recently it’s been Hey Jude. Dean won’t—can’t—verbalize how safe it makes him feel.
