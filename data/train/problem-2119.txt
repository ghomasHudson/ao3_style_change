“Also, the nephew’s name is Henry Hampford.” He added out in the hallway without another word.
“Sherly?” Mycroft walked into the parlor where he found Sherlock reading next to the fireplace.
John groaned as he took a sip from his teacup. “That’s a name I’ll be glad not to hear about after this year’s election. His standing appears dismal.”
Sherlock grinned as he waved for her to settle down, holding up an index finger before pointing back to the ghost. The group watched as the ghost mimicked the same exact moves that Mr. McArthur completed not too long ago.
John sighed once more before Sherlock held up his free hand. “Look, Watson.” He pointed at a few specks of blood leading out of the dining room toward the kitchen.
A loud, boisterous cough interrupted the speaker. He stopped reading his notes to glare out into the crowd before effortlessly resuming his lecture.
“We’ll talk to Mr. Fedorov then we’ll look for that murder weapon.”
“It has to be timed precisely or this won’t work. Understood?” Moriarty pointed at the man before turning around to leave the cellar.
“H.S.…there’s something here about Carberry working with someone called H.S.…how could the police miss this?” Sherlock mused aloud.
“Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s poem about Lord Collingwood or Baron Collingwood to be precise.” Sherlock answered as he hobbled over to his bookcase.
He sent the message before rising from his chair to retrieve his hat and coat as he exited the office.
John automatically nodded back, but for some reason, it pained him to hear that Sherlock had been so upset. He thought back to the way his companion looked the morning they threw John into a cell at Scotland Yard before transporting him to Westgate.
“Holmes!” John shouted again as they run up the stairs through the growing clouds of smoke.
“…or I can get someone else to do it.” He added before opening the door.
Wiggins followed Sherlock to his desk. “Do you want me to go with you, Mr. ‘olmes?”
Sherlock sighed. “It looked like both men had been attacked by an animal and viciously so. I think it has something to do with whatever is in the vials. Carberry was working on something related to this—”
Mary sighed as she walked toward him, giving him a hug upon impact. Sherlock held still as she hugged him.
Sherlock motioned for Mr. McArthur to remain calm. “Also, it appears that the carriage house inhabitant wears a size 10 shoe…”
“Nice to see you again, Inspector, but if you don’t hand my brother over to me at once, I can make your position more difficult for you than it already is.”
As he listened to the men below, John was now struggling to keep Gladstone quiet. He could tell that Gladstone was becoming anxious from being muzzled for so long which wasn’t typical. John could also tell that Gladstone had sensed that something in the atmosphere had shifted greatly ever since Henry had perished in the vats.
“Ah,” Sherlock turned to John, “this must be Mr. McArthur.” He explained pointing to the man on the portico.
John gawked at Sherlock. “Holmes. Please don’t tell me you don’t think that wasn’t suspicious behavior.
The guide nodded again as she directed Sherlock and John to the reception desk. She walked behind the desk to grab the log.
The employee looked at John, taking a moment before jogging toward the sound of the voice. John watched him leave, remembering to himself that he should probably retrieve his medical bag from his compartment before tending to the passenger. He walked back from car to car until he found his compartment next to the dining car. He took his time opening the door, looking both ways down the hall before entering.
Detective Baynes scrunched up his face. “I’m not sure what you mean, Lestrade.”
Wiggins nodded, taking his hat off as he looked up at Sherlock. “You wanted to see me, Mr. ‘olmes?”
“Sherly.” Sherlock felt a hand squeeze his shoulder, “we need to leave now, please.”
Sherlock chuckled as he spun away from the desk to head toward the guide and the display case, limping on his bad leg.
William appeared to take some offense to Sherlock’s comment, but then he waved it off. He brushed some imaginary dirt off his night robe.
“Madame Loire, you dropped this.” He smiled up at her as he handed her what looked to be photograph of a younger version of herself with a small child.
“Holmes,” John started, letting out a heavy sigh, “I’m sorry. It’s just…this is all over the paper and now our position is in even more danger.”
to the one about Whitehall.”
Sherlock leaned backward in his chair with a huge broad smile. “I bet it did, Mr. Fedorov…anything else?”
Sherlock shushed John as they walked briskly through the corridor until they found the door leading to the back alley of the building.
generous of you considering the situation.”
John’s jaw hardened as he listened, refusing to let the detective rattle his resolve. He took another step to the side but kept his eyes on Detective Baynes. Detective Baynes followed his movements, circling John like a bird of prey.
“I really wish you wouldn’t refer to murder as if it were a parlor game, Holmes.” John groaned.
James continued to look around aimlessly before hanging his head. “I let Pierre onto the property…” He pointed at Madame Loire’s son.
“Wait, I don’t understand…” Bridget was looking around the room with tears streaming down her face.
Detective Baynes grinned as he pointed his revolver directly at John. “Of course, you didn’t, Dr. Watson.
Whitehall nodded before letting out a contained laugh as he reached for his waterglass. “Well, it helps having supporters, especially during a censure.”
John’s mouth fell open at Sherlock’s insistence. “Holmes, there is
Sherlock barely acknowledged Mycroft as he finally descended the hansom to walk briskly to the main entrance of the prison. He wrenched opened the unnecessarily heavy doors, walking inside to find a guard at the entrance post, reading a novel.
As he crawled into the upper story, John surveyed the area immediately, keeping in mind that some of the men from down below may come up the interior staircase. He could hear voices from down below, but he couldn’t understand what they were saying. However, nothing sounded amiss, so John told himself that Sherlock must be hiding to avoid any conflict.
Sherlock listened to Mr. McArthur with patience before pointing to a wildly ostentatious brooch on his lapel.
“Ah, so you
As soon as it appeared that Mr. McArthur was near the end of the ritual, everyone crowded around the window, looking out onto the burial landscape, seeing a shadowy figure emerge from behind a tombstone.
“Sherly…” Mycroft stayed near the street, looking around anxiously, “I’m beginning to think this is an unwise, if not deeply dreadful idea.”
John let out a sigh as he hung his head. He took a moment before looking back up at Detective Baynes.
“Mr. ‘olmes! We saw the police this morning!” Wiggins offered as he stood in the threshold of the door.
“…we’ll have to disguise ourselves before going…” Sherlock walked to his bedroom as he motioned for Wiggins to take a seat. Wiggins sighed as he sat down, too impatient to wait.
James reached out a hand toward his father. “Father, I don’t really think that’s a good idea. Our guests don’t want to see that old house—”
John and Sherlock waited a bit longer before the group in the sawmill broke up into smaller groups. A couple of the men exited the sawmill while the rest of the group stayed behind, working on the object that was left on the table. Their voices grew quieter, so it became difficult to discern anything further from their conversation.
One of the three men stepped forward. “The murder went off without a hitch, gov’. They got the doctor in custody.”
John nodded. “Why do we need Gladstone? I think we should leave him here, too.”
Sherlock crouched down in front of John, placing a hand on his knee. “What was the experiment, Watson?”
Sherlock nodded at John before facing Mr. McArthur. “This must be the house you acquired with the cemetery, correct?”
Ignoring John’s protests, Sherlock inched forward out beyond the covering before rising to walk quietly toward the sawmill. John watched in horror as his companion took his time approaching a side entrance. John thought quickly; he could either let Sherlock walk willingly into danger alone or go along, knowingly exposing themselves to possible risk.
“Detective Baynes,” John began as he regrouped, “this is a terrible mistake.”
Sherlock nodded as he stroked his chin. “Quite.”
“Following the thread led us to Lord Collingwood’s house where you worked for some time, but I can only give all the credit to one of my best informants in matching your name to the coat. I commend you on taking the time to give someone in need your torn coat while giving Scotland Yard a run…that was
“Mr. Kleinschmidt gave the museum a few donations in the past, but not recently.”
“Of course, Detective Baynes. And I’m sure this is a misunderstanding.” Sherlock responded just as coolly as Detective Baynes voice had been, causing the detective to flinch slightly.
“Holmes! Stop snooping around.” John tried calling.
The comment made Whitehall stop sipping from his glass. He slowly placed the glass back down on the table before looking directly at Moriarty.
“Get ‘em!”
“Miss!”
John laughed again. “Let’s get you back to Baker Street so you can rest.” He kissed Sherlock on the top of his head before helping him into the hansom that had been waiting for them.
“My dear brother doesn’t do well with fans, I’m afraid.” He smiled at the guards, however they still appeared uncomfortable at possibly offending Sherlock.
Sherlock thought to himself as he jogged to the next car. Upon opening the door to the next car, Sherlock could see John entering his compartment. He waited for John to go inside before positioning himself outside in the corridor, waiting a second longer for his companion to remerge with his back facing him before shoving him back inside the compartment…
William stopped struggling as he pointed at Fedorov. “It’s Fedorov, isn’t it. I knew it!”
John loved Sherlock dearly, of course, but his companion’s habits were beginning to bear too much lately, so John hardly gave it a second thought after one of his colleagues, a Dr. James Carberry, had asked him to attend a conference in his place. Sherlock was of course annoyed about being apart for so long, but John had reassured him that he would make it up to him somehow. But for now, as John had explained to an indignant Sherlock as he left earlier that morning, they could both use the time to decompress.
Sherlock looked up from the paper to give John a steely eyed expression which John took as a sign that he might have ventured too far in possibly insulting his companion’s expertise.
“We must go to Coney’s office. We’ll find more information about the case there.”
Sherlock flashed Moriarty a grin before unclasping his hand from Moriarty’s. “Perhaps. I would be delighted…”
Sherlock looked back and forth between the siblings then at Mr. McArthur before backing away from the huddle. Mary then explained in agonizing detail that she and James had seen the ghost a few days ago while they were visiting the house to retrieve some linen Mary had found from upstairs.
John nodded sternly; the call of duty was more drawing than being clearly bewildered by this train employee’s eerie demeanor. John placed his newspaper down on the table before rising to follow the employee. They exited the dining car and walked from car to car until they neared the luggage car next to the engine.
John nodded once more, taking his time letting Sherlock go before shuffling on the bed to lie down, fully clothed, being too tired to even undress. He closed his eyes as he felt Sherlock lie down next to him, feeling Sherlock pull him close to his body before quickly yielding to sleep.
“…it seems as if Dr. Carberry was working on some sort of an experiment…” Something in the corner of a page caught Sherlock’s eye. He squinted to peer down at the inscription.
John rolled to the side with a groan to see Gladstone attacking his assailant. John shook his head a couple of times to reorient himself from his assault before getting up to get Gladstone off the man. But before John could reach the scuffle, a loud boom appeared out of the sky. John’s vision went blurry from the loud ringing in his ears as he tried to look around the area, attempting to ascertain where the noise had emanated, but as he look directly at the factory, part of the building collapsed in on itself.
Sherlock nodded, pointing to Wiggins. “I’m looking for my brother. This is son. I think I once heard him say he works in a graveyard.”
Mycroft frowned before smiling a little. He then nodded as he closed the door behind him. Sherlock stayed at the fireplace, listening to his brother’s footsteps descend the stairs before he sprinted to the bay windows. He peeked out through the curtain, watching Mycroft hail a hansom, waiting for the hansom to take off down the street.
The officer reviewed the manifest before looking up at John. “Dr. Watson, you’re on the train’s manifest,” he then turned to face Sherlock, now expressing confusion by Sherlock’s costume.
And Lestrade knew Sherlock and John were connected somehow to the bombing at Judge Becket’s.
Sherlock looked up at his brother before looking back down at the priest. The man looked like he had been mauled by a bear.
“It’s not kind to make up stories about the dead, James. You of all people should know that.” She shot her brother the most biting look that caused everyone else in the room to look back and forth at each other as an awkward silence intensified throughout the room.
“I-I think…” Madame Loire started, “I think…I saw…the…ghost.”
“So, someone at the Yard is framing me.” John finally let out as the sinking realization hit him all at once.
“…but we can give you another compartment, if you wish.” The employee offered as he turned around to face Sherlock, “I’ll send someone momentarily.”
John sighed, reminding himself that they were going to have some time to relax. He strapped in the last suitcase before climbing into the automobile in the driver’s seat.
“You don’t think I know that?” John interjected.
Sherlock grinned as he walked to his desk to write a note before putting it in his pocket. “I’ll have you know, Mr. Wiggins, that I’ve managed to go undetected with many a 'getup' such as the one I’m currently donning.”
Moriarty sat back in his chair. He leaned into one arm, positioning himself into a pondering expression as he studied the newspaper clippings on his desk.
Sherlock and John followed Mr. McArthur into the house and into the vestibule as Mr. Arthur continued on about how wonderful it was to have them visit Philadelphia. As they spoke, music from a reed organ filtered in through the vestibule from the front parlor.
Mycroft clapped his hands together. “Well, Sherlock. Let’s speak with Warden James then. Thank you, director.”
John let out a heavy sigh; he felt too drained from the morning’s events to even think coherently on protesting his innocence.
John groaned loudly as Sherlock only shrugged. “He’s better than you think, Mycroft.” Sherlock answered.
John nodded he took a step forward before peeking down the hall back at Madame Loire and the young man.
The end of Madame Loire’s explanation forced a quieting silence that was eventually broken by an awkward cough from Mr. McArthur.
James sighed. “Because, father, I don’t want to be in the cemetery business. I want to study architecture. You know that, but you refused to listen. I know it was foolish to get wrapped up in this, but you never listen to me.”
Sherlock shook his head as he held John down with both hands before lying down next to him. “Stay down, dear.”
Sherlock grinned as he leaned backward in his chair. “Mycroft keeps peculiar company, but I assure you he is only a fan of yours.”
Mrs. Hudson let out another cry of disbelief as Sherlock tried to look past Detective Baynes. He then turned to look directly at the detective who stood his ground at the front door to the sitting room.
“However,” Sherlock stood up straight as he pulled out a slip of paper from his pocket, “I need you to pick up a few things for me. Do you think you can find them by tonight?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock managed to pull off in a higher voice octave, “but I think there’s something wrong with my compartment.”
All the color drained from John’s face as a voice appeared not too far behind him.
Mary shook her head as a stream of tears flooded down her face. “I knew this was a mistake!”
The disrupter coughed again causing some audience members to grumble, but the speaker pressed on, never seemingly losing his resolve.
Sherlock’s expression contorted with satisfaction. “That seems unsurprising. May we see the visitor log?”
John stared at Sherlock, lost by the comment as Sherlock began humming to himself once more as he looked through the book he was holding. After a second or two, he closed the book which produced a quiet thud filled with dust that had settled on the barely used book.
John waited before standing up a bit to peer over the bushes. He could see Sherlock standing outside the ground floor of the sawmill; his back was up against an exterior wall, and he was leaning to the side to listen to the group of men.
Bridget glared at both Sherlock and John. “Why I never! You already said it was a burglary, Mr. Holmes. Why put Clara through such an ordeal?”
Sherlock nodded with a slight smile. “Ms. Coventry. I appreciate the flattery, although what I do is purely simple.”
Wiggins shook his head. “I know the neighborhood, Mr. ‘olmes. You need me.”
John scrunched up his face, stepping forward as if to interject but Sherlock stopped him. “Thank you, Mary. Watson, could you please fetch Gladstone’s leash? I think it’s on the desk.” Sherlock pointed behind himself as he took a hold of Gladstone’s collar.
Sherlock, dizzy from the impact, then ran into a fruit stand, knocking it over which luckily obscured the path of the thugs who were on his tail. Sherlock ran to another street corner, looking both ways before running into a nearby pub.
John nodded sternly as he joined Sherlock at the counter. He leaned slightly to see what Sherlock was inspecting in his deceased colleague’s journal; the pages visible were riddled with incoherent symbols and sketches.
Sherlock hummed. “Well, you are quite the actress, Ms. Coventry.”
He turned onto his side to look at the side of the bed that Sherlock had been sleeping on. John believed that Sherlock could figure anything out, but something about this case felt like it would be their last. John groaned as he shut his eyes again, trying to tell himself that he needed to rest; at least he could control that.
Sherlock and John looked at one another simultaneously before running toward the room.
Sherlock laughed before turning around to face James who was by now looking everywhere except at him.
“…you and Mycroft are my only family…” Sherlock ended quietly, almost to a full whisper.
“There’s dirt and some strands of rope in the samples I collected…” Sherlock said to himself as he glanced back and forth between the open book and the samples taken from the chapel.
Ever since the symposium, Moriarty had been studying Sherlock Holmes, following every single case to get at the heart of the man who seemed to be an expert in criminal psychology. That day and after an exceptionally frustrating class, Moriarty had been studying once such curious case that involved an academic who had stolen a few priceless artifacts to get back at his colleague over a failed museum exhibit.
John clapped his hands together. “Well, I’m glad it wasn’t a theft, Madame.”
But before Sherlock could answer him, Saxon lunged toward him, taking him to the ground. They wrestled around with each other, knocking over some of the priceless artifacts in Wheeler’s study.
“Holmes,” Lestrade handed some papers to the officer before intercepting the trio before they could walk any further, “you shouldn’t be here.”
Thanks to a reliable source, the escape occurred about two days ago and involved the infamous “Rat Killer” of note, Dr. Hans Schuller, who had been housed in Westgate for a series of poisonings. My source informs me that it is possible that the Carberry murder and Dr. Schuller’s cases are linked, which means that our Dr. John Watson may be more dangerous than we originally realized…
John nodded as he took the donations book while Sherlock looked through the visitor log.
“Sherlock has not been acting like himself lately,” Mycroft continued, “I noticed it right away the morning they took you Scotland Yard,” he took a bite of his food as he mused on, “I mean this case—and I don’t need to tell you, Doctor—but this case is quite extraordinary to have Sherly so up in a tizzy. He is so much more…tranquil.”
Sherlock nodded. “And?”
“Mrs. Hudson?” John was interrupted by a woman’s voice. The door to the guest room opened to reveal Mary.
Sherlock looked around before walking to the other side of the row of houses. He counted the houses until he found the back window leading into the den. Sherlock looked around himself before finding a crate to stand on to reach the window. He easily pried open the window to climb inside the back room of the den.
Mr. McArthur shook his head quickly. “Nonsense!” He repeated as he jumped up from his chair before marching to the hall entrance into the parlor, “Madame Loire! Madame Loire! Madame—
Wiggins waved his cap back at Sherlock before running across the street. Sherlock anticipated Wiggins by opening the door to the sitting room as soon as the child arrived.
John didn’t respond; he was too busy watching Gladstone sleep.
“Watson,” Sherlock finally answered but he kept his eyes on whatever had captured his attention, “keep an eye on the pair down by the furnaces. I’m going to investigate outside.”
Two officers took a hold of Sherlock before he barely made a move. Lestrade walked up to the group. “Holmes, don’t make me do this.”
Lestrade grabbed Saxon away from Sherlock, handing him to the policemen. Sherlock straightened himself out as he helped John up from the floor.
Wiggins shook his head. “But Mr. ‘olmes!”
“Sherly…you had us running all over London just now. You need to rest.”
“Uh,” John started, turning back toward the incensed couple, trying his best to convey his sincerest apologies, “I am so sorry.”
John grimaced. “What? Holmes—”
John’s eyes widened as he ignored the mess growing in the kitchen. “Antidote?”
John had joined the party, knowing full well that his companion was covering for Clara.
“You must think we’re idiots, Doctor,” the provocation made John stare wide eyed at Detective Baynes as the latter continued, “we have you for this murder.” Detective Baynes wasted little time as he rose from his chair to open the door.
“W-what, w-what…I feel…a bit…under the…weather…”
“Watson,” Sherlock responded harshly, “I know.”
luggage. You always overpack.”
Lestrade eyed the detective, but something unnerving about the latter's demeanor made his skin crawl. Yet, Lestrade knew it would be a lost cause to push the matter any further without raising further suspicion that could negatively impact John’s case.
John sighed again as he stopped pacing. He rested his hands on his hips as he looked down at the bare floor.
Sherlock shook his head as he showed John the luggage that had colorful ties attached to the handle to indicate which was theirs.
ridiculous to me for all of us to put our trust in you based on hearsay. Even the great Sherlock Holmes must have the passion to commit murder.”
John shushed Gladstone as best as he could as they peered out of the nook and downward to see a couple of men standing near the furnaces and vats. The men were talking loudly amongst themselves, complaining about some production processes either going slowly or not as expected because of some unforeseen circumstances related to their boss’s obsession with a chemist.
“But…why?” John started, clearly confused, “…why go through such great lengths? Surely you could have used Schuller without having to resort to murder. Why go through so much trouble to have myself and Holmes involved?”
John tried to prevent himself from expressing annoyance coupled with amazement. Although he loved Holmes dearly, often his companion’s over self-satisfaction with his remarkable ability of deduction irked John to no end.
Sherlock laughed as he sprung from his chair. “I do, but it’s only a distraction. We must find the murder weapon.”
Saxon’s expression changed, clearly confused by Sherlock’s comment. “Whatever do you mean?”
“But, what, Mycroft? You’re going to have to do better than that.” Sherlock snapped.
Moriarty posed thoughtfully before waving a hand. “Dr. Schuller, I will get someone on that right away. My apologies for the set up…” He stood up from his chair to walk to the door.
“Holmes,” John began as he stepped forward, “we need to be careful.”
Sherlock laughed loudly. “No, I’m taking the weekend off, remember Watson?"
“…you’re too close to the case…I’m sorry…”
“Hans Schuller and Dr. Watson.” Sherlock added without flinching. He looked directly at Warden James.
Lestrade sighed again as he pushed himself away from the desk to walk around it. He pulled out a drawer before rummaging through it.
“Sherlock!” Mycroft shouted from the top of the stairs, “you need to leave the case alone! Besides, Mrs. Hudson will be back soon with tea!”
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, but I’m not sure how much one could do for a man as far gone as Hans Schuller.”
“I was just taking my dog out for a stroll, and he wandered in here. We’re leaving now.” John attempted.
Sherlock nodded as he got up from his desk to retrieve a book from his library shelves. “I’m not entirely sure yet, but I’m going to find out. This must have something to do with whomever is framing Watson.”
Sherlock took his time standing up to listen to the conversation. Although the voices were raised, the wall muffled most of the conversation. Sherlock pressed his body against the wall a bit more.
She stepped to the side after a moment to let a shorter man into the space. A joyous expression appeared on his face as he recognized Sherlock.
“My god…” Mr. McArthur gasped, “it knows the ritual? How can that be?”
“Why, McArthur,” Sherlock started, “that would be nice, but I don’t want your staff to go through so much trouble only to entertain us.”
John rolled his eyes as he made sure that Sherlock was inside before looking both ways behind the rowhouse block for any signs of the police.
John nodded back before reaching over to give Sherlock a hug. He felt Sherlock settle into his embrace, rubbing his back as John felt his eyes water a little from the stress.
Mycroft ran toward the chapel before slowing down, mindful of his footsteps as they probably weren’t alone. He finally reached the chapel to find Sherlock standing over the body of the murdered priest.
“What!” John shouted back, too afraid for his life to fully comprehend what was happening.
“Cover me, Watson.” Sherlock commanded as he effortlessly pried the window opened.
Lestrade was already on his way toward his office door from his desk to calm Sherlock, seemingly prompted by hearing Sherlock arguing with Detective Baynes.
Moriarty smiled to himself as he watched the staff shuffle about; the balcony doors had been opened into the hall, displaying the mountains and moonlight. Something about the scene seemed peaceful and serene.
“Here it is, sir.”
Sherlock placed the scrap of paper into his coat pocket before walking to the door. “His clothes suggest as much; this scrap of paper is the address of a dock located at the edge of the city; and the violin case’s interior has unmistakable impressions from a Colt Peterson which is presumably with its owner.”
“Uh, Professor?” Moriarty stopped with a sigh as he turned to face the man who was now crinkling his hat in his hands.
John tried to stop Sherlock before he could get away. “Holmes! Wait!”
“Perhaps I can call on you to talk to my students sometime in the future. I think they would benefit greatly from your…expertise, Mr. Holmes.”
Mary nodded timidly, reaching out her hand to shake Sherlock’s but she stayed on the stool in front of the organ.
“All right, Watson. Here are the facts.”
A man wearing something resembling a military uniform sitting next to Bridget fidgeted as he reached for his wine glass.
Lestrade looked back and forth between Sherlock and Mycroft as he finally remembered who Mycroft was along his powerful government connections that could potentially jam up regular procedures at the Yard if prompted. He then reluctantly waved for the officers to let go of Sherlock.
Even lying with John in the comfort of their warm, cozy bed was not enough to assuage his nervousness that Moriarty would come back from the dead, that he would find them and take John away.
"John," Sherlock tried again, his tone lowering to be more beseeching, his eyes widening as he licked his lips slowly to gain John's waning attention. John watched Sherlock's antics from the corner of his eye, biting back his first instinct to stalk over to the mulish man and give his delectable mouth something to do.
Time for one final blow: “my little slut, how I adore your lips around my cock. I’m going to use you as my little cockwarmer from now on, and you’ll love it because you’re
After all, he was never happy when forced to be an idle man.
John smirked, rubbing directly on Sherlock’s sweet spot while holding his hip so he couldn’t squirm away. Beginning to scissor his fingers, John felt the wet entrance was stretched enough and picked up the purple anal beads.
Shaking away the thought of Sherlock, John refocused, “I was in the army, but I was shot and unable to continue my work as a surgeon due to the slight tremor in my left hand.”
John looked over with a self-satisfied smile, his eyes gleaming with unparalleled affection for his genius,“yes, I thought you might have.”
“Ohh, I’ve got it!” Sherlock quickly announced, drawing out the
“Time for bed, Sherlock,” John said, watching with a quirked smile as the detective groaned in annoyance and pushed his head up into John’s hand, not wanting the stroking to stop.
Sherlock heard whispered in the winter wind, the voice soft as it had been in life, and he sighed.
“J-John?” Sherlock called out hesitantly, wandering forward slowly and increasingly aware of his naked form as a breeze rustled by, his self-consciousness growing despite the warming heat from the sun.
The two men finished their meals between nudging each other's feet underneath the table and Sherlock telling an anecdote about a serial killing hairdresser to John's vast amusement. By the time the two men left the restaurant, they were giggling like schoolboys on their way back to Baker Street. John grabbed Sherlock’s hand once again, marveling at how natural it felt with the large, warm hand encasing his own, and they continued their leisurely walk home.
A waltz began to play once they were in the center, something bittersweet and played on a solo violin, and John looked adorably lost about what to do. Sherlock smiled reassuringly, and stepped up, placing one of John’s paws around his shoulder and one around his lean waist, allowing the beast to lead them through their dance, "one, two, three," Sherlock instructed softly, and the beast's eyes dipped to look at his plush lips. They continued their first dance, both feeling equal parts bashful and emboldened.
He coated Sherlock’s chest with his release, mixing with Sherlock’s own from minutes before, and the waves of pleasure rolling over him caused him to gasp and close his eyes briefly, missing the hungry expression on Sherlock's face as he watched John take his pleasure.
Cheers!
“Where is my brother?” Sherlock countered, watching as Moriarty’s face slid into one of fake innocence. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, watching closely for any hints.
“Shhh, sweetheart,” John soothed, crawling back up to place a few sweet pecks on Sherlock’s mouth, “we can stop right here, right now.”
He let out a wet-sounding laugh at his father’s wrinkled face after so many months apart, but soon realized his father’s face was set in one of panic. Then, Sherlock looked to the side of his father and saw none other than Moriarty.
He had something very special planned, after all.
“Sherlock, what are you wearing?” John asked, beginning to stalk forward, the weariness from a long day at work falling away as Sherlock gulped and looked down bashfully. Gotcha.
But the Prince clenched his fists,
Once they were settled in the cab, Sherlock pressed his cold nose against John’s neck, breathing him in and feeling safe as John wrapped his strong arms around him.
John closed his eyes, and Sherlock panicked, digging into his side to cause him pain in order to wake him up and crying out to him.
Thanks,
The sound of the violin in the dark of night waking him from his nightmares became soothing, and a case involving some sort of scuffle or gunshot or chase became the exhilaration to get John through his tedious work as a GP.
When she was a child, other noble children had been brought to court for Mycroft and Sherlock to play with, but the two geniuses were often outcasts among their royal playmates.
He felt a heat on his naked back, and tensed slightly in anticipation, waiting for John’s orders.
John was roused into waking from the stinging feeling coming from his left forearm. He tried to pull his arm away from the discomfort but someone was holding on, and would not let his arm free.
John groaned at the- frankly ridiculous- statement that should be hilarious, but with Sherlock’s genuine and youthful voice, it sounded sincere and bordering on begging.
Lestrade and Molly were out in the hallway, Molly’s clock-face reading midnight and Lestrade's candles flickering in the darkened chamber.
John took a pillow, amidst the kisses, and lifted Sherlock’s hips, settling the pillow beneath and leaving the detective’s creamy bum prominently displayed, and leaned down to press a kiss on each cheek, smiling slightly and Sherlock’s groan of arousal at the too-chaste kisses.
John leaned forward slowly, nuzzling their noses together so sweetly, and Sherlock gave another choked off sob and buried his face beneath John’s neck, resting his head on John’s solid chest and listening to the comforting
, were to walk in right now.
John allowed the beautiful words, words he never believed he would hear, to wash over his senses and the overwhelming feelings of happiness descend. Sherlock loved him. He loved Sherlock. They had their home back, and a life in front of them that could be reclaimed; a life of crime solving, dinner at Angelo’s
Allowing a person, a stranger, to touch him- to
Looking past the cover, indeed.
And through the nights of crime solving and days of grocery shopping and going to the surgery, John realized that Sherlock had quickly become John’s most important person.
She looked…. Well, womanly. The corset emphasized her minuscule, pale breasts, creating a decent amount of décolletage and emphasizing her small waist. With her ebony curls falling down, tamed for once by Molly’s magic hand and lacking the smell of the chemicals from her experiments, she looked…. Different.
“So a babysitter,” Sherlock scoffed, sinking deeper into the bath with a huff and glaring at the painted ceiling.
Sherlock fought in vain to close his legs with a squeaked, "John, don't look there-" but John did not tear his eyes away from Sherlock's small hole, winking slightly in anticipation and nervousness.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and she leaned against John’s neck. She smelled of citrus, rain and gunpowder. It was an intoxicating, complicated mixture that perfectly defined the woman herself. Sherlock's hand accidentally brushed against John's amply chest and she clenched her legs together at the sensation.
John smiled slightly and spoke.
Sherlock did not see his usual fluffy-jumper wearing John, no, this was Captain John H. Watson, M.D., of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, commanding his unit and saving lives through his natural ability to lead despite his slighter height.
Sherlock’s dinner was almost gone, John having fed Sherlock and himself over the course of the dinner, grinning all the while and Sherlock’s adorable frustration as he sought his pleasure and fought off his embarrassment.
Sherlock thought, so wrapped up in his deductions about the flower in his grasp, that he failed to notice the light breathing taking place behind him. But, when he turned, he saw no one, but the door to the castle was standing open in dark invitation.
“You do, eh? Well, how about you let
They sat that way for a moment in the sun warmed bedroom, their naked backs to one another. After everything else they had done together, this moment shouldn’t feel that much more momentous.
“Sherlock, do you want some tea? What am I saying, of course you do," John answered herself with a little chuckle, moving to the kettle and setting down the briefcase with the enigmatic flowers on top.
“Sir?”
Sherlock nodded and followed silently, feeling slightly guilty that she had been so rude to the woman who had practically raised her; but she was so frustrated! Every day, to be no more than an object to be used or dismissed at the will of others, to have no freedom, no choices, it was destroying her.
worried,” he simpered with a mock-pout upon his pasty face. He winked at him, and shoved past and into their home, looking for Siger, seeing him standing beside the fireplace, his back ramrod straight and watching the flames.
Sherlock's hands reached down to lift her purple skirts up to pool around her knees. Was it always so hot in her bedroom?
“That’s alright dearie, you finish your cry, and then we will see about getting you some proper food,” the teapot, who had introduced herself as Mrs. Hudson, soothed.
John was by no means a prude- she had bedded men and women across Fairlyn of all rank and station. She had the reputation to prove it. While the reminders of her old days in the army made her feel prideful and a little smug, she had never met a single person who intrigued and excited her like the secluded princess: the mere sight of her infatuated John.
He glanced down, wanting to break that gaze that seemed to stare into his very soul- if he even had one of those left- and saw that Sherlock was tending to his wound from the wolf.
And when her voice said John’s name, even in her dismissive, haughty tone, it sent shivers down the injured soldier’s back. Somehow, her infatuation was more than physical.
“What, but why?” Sherlock queried, nonplussed towards John’s odd request for a moment before realization dawned on him.
“You’re driving me crazy love,” John said, peppering kisses on Sherlock’s cheeks and neck, traveling steadily lower, her hands raising the soft black material from Sherlock’s alabaster thighs.
” he leered, turning around.
Sherlock!”
After a while, John came to the door, opening it and finding Sherlock lying on the bed on his stomach, scrolling through his phone lazily, completely nude; John licked his lips, wanting to go over and plunge himself in that tight arse that knew only his touch, his cock, but he held off.
Moriarty turned around, walking straight up to the cage and leaning in, “you’re in love with the beast. You’ve fallen in love with him, despite the fact that I am your intellectual and physical equal, you fall for a monster like him,” Moriarty growled, his anger palpable, and Sherlock shivered from the chill of the night around the cage.
Sherlock’s mind settled from the tender, heated kisses they were sharing, but his breathing was beginning to become labored.
And Sherlock did, his cock releasing white floods over his abdomen and the edge of the table, Sherlock riding the sensations deliriously, his head flown back and his chest heaving, his hardened nipples highlighted by the fire.
John chuckled lightheartedly, turning Sherlock around and ignoring his groaning protests in order to meet his virescent eyes, "so, despite all that planning for the scene,
Sherlock glanced up, alerted by the sudden wind through his curls and looking through tear filled eyes to see John’s body begin to flicker with light. All around him, a singular gold began to shine ever brighter, and the melodious tunes off spring sounded around them. Sherlock sat back in shock as John’s body was lifted from the ground slowly, hovering a few feet in the air and defying the physical world.
“What, darling? What do you need?” John asked between light kisses, the keening in Sherlock’s voice just as sweet as the melodious notes from his violin only moments before.
While the two men caught their breath, Sherlock's virescent eyes observed movement in his peripheral vision and whipped around, his eyes locking with the murder who was only a few meters away and crouching low partially behind a trash bin, his eyes wild.
“Sorry about that,” John said with a mock horrified expression on his face while Lord Grey sputtered in shock.
John looked once more in the mirror and, wincing, turned away, hoping that he would be deemed appropriate by Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, “and after all this, the master has finally learned to love…. But it wasn’t enough, because Sherlock may not love him back. The rose has maybe days left, we’ve lost our chance.”
“Yes, ginormous, the largest you’ve ever seen on any creature.”
The blue jacket was rather nice, he would internally admit, and the trousers were fit and clean for once. The shirt was cut in a low V, showing off his muscular chest, and he was hoping that Sherlock could find him even a little bit appealing.
John watched the adorable sight for a moment while Sherlock stood there in sullen silence, glaring at John all the while, but not making a move, waiting for John’s next command.
Sherlock groaned as he rolled out of bed, feeling somewhat sore and remembering why. Last night, with John.
Lost as he was in his deductions and admiration of the rose, Sherlock didn’t hear the footsteps until it was too late.
John grabbed Sherlock by the hips, guiding him down slowly, so slowly, allowing gravity to help as Sherlock wiggled an writhed; bearing down on his cock and clenching as he did, causing John to gasp out.
“Unzip me, and then use your mouth. No sucking, only kisses right now,” John instructed lowly, and Sherlock’s face sank into gratefulness as he carefully unzipped John and took out his manhood from his trousers, his cock hardening in the detective’s skillful hands.
While it was true John was not gay, he had realized he was bisexual in the army. With the muscled chests and arms of the recruits, the hidden liaisons in the dark on cold desert nights, and his hopeless crush on his gentle commanding officer James Sholto.
Cheers!
John rolled off of his disheveled and ripped bedclothes and grabbed the magic mirror.
John smiled indulgently up at Sherlock, reminiscing about how adorable his lover always appeared when in his element.
He truly was a fearsome creature, he thought absently, at least double Moriarty’s width and standing almost two heads above him, but it was no matter, Moriarty had destroyed larger and more difficult adversaries before.
Sherlock scanned the room slowly, trying to focus on the people in front of him and not the army doctor pulling him close, whispering sweet words into his ear.
“Sherlock, I wanted you to have this. You never ask for anything beyond your science equipment, which was handed down from the university and is mostly broken. I know money is tight” he sighed softly, unable to deny the truth of the claim to his beloved child, “and that we had to move to this small house from the estate outside London, but my prospects are getting better. Money is coming in now from my many investments, and soon we may be able to move back to London!”
"This is a turn up, isn't it, Sherlock? My brilliant boy, I love when I am able to trick you. And I do so love to see you....
“No,” Sherlock whimpered, “Sir, I-“
John pulled away, beginning to walk towards the kitchen and opening the fridge.
Mycroft stepped away after another moment with a huff, glancing at his father who had joyous tears in his eyes from observing his two sons. Mycroft let out an annoyed breath and mumbled,
, Sherlock lost all sense, his lithe body fighting half-heartedly to escape John, trying to remove his hands from John’s grip and clenching around the pulsing heat splitting him in two. John’s eyes flashed frantically, letting out a guttural moan and allowing Sherlock to feel triumphant as he viewed John’s momentary lack of control.
He opened his arms, and Rosie giggled, running into his arms and clutching onto him tightly, “I will never be parted for you again, do you hear me. I love you,” John choked out, still feeling emotional and feeling tears drip down his face into Rosie’s fine golden locks. He knew eight years could not be erased, but now that Rosie could grow, this time he would be there for her, no more alcohol or cruelness, forced to shut her away from him for her safety and well-being. He would be there to love her, to teach her, and to guide her, as a father should.
Once Sherlock’s breathing had slowed down, John kissed up her abdomen, pushing up Sherlock’s lingerie in the process.
John swiftly tied him up, spreading his nude body across the bed in a vulnerable offering, and Sherlock squirmed consciously as John took in his exposed body. With a small smile, John tightened his leg restraints further, his legs stretching so far apart that his arsecheeks no longer pressed together, but rather his small pucker was exposed to the cool morning air and John's heated gaze.
!” Sherlock moaned as he neared orgasm once again, but the hard glint in John’s eyes forced Sherlock to whine and slow down his bouncing on the cock, knowing he was never allowed to come without permission.
Sherlock had never been courted before, but he found he quite enjoyed the sensation. The two of them sat on a bench right outside the gardens and enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and the glow of the moonlight.
“Look at you, you just needed a spanking on your bare bum and a cry, didn’t you love?” John smirked, watching as Sherlock’s cheeks flushed deeper as he moaned in mortification as John’s words registered in his brilliant mind, and he tried to hide his face in John’s military collar.
Sherlock huffed, “if only,” sitting down and burying her head in her arms, ignoring her maid completely.
“Yes, sir.”
The rest of the room had been cleaned as well, the paintings removed and a fresh smell surrounding the space from the candles and clean rugs and bedding.
They all went to the armory, brooms and hairbrushes, dressers and chairs, and picked up whatever weapons the objects could wield, before heading down to the entranceway.
, "for finding pleasure because of me," John finished, licking from Sherlock's clavicle to his chin, causing the younger man to positively writhe on the torn bedsheets, growing half-hard underneath John from his dutiful attentions. John softened his kisses, winding them both down from their pleasure high, Sherlock whining slightly as John slowed their passion to something sweeter, but John was cognizant that Sherlock would need some time, as this was all new, and John didn't want to overwhelm him.
, John thought, a wild idea popping up in his mind.
To finally be home, with his papa, was all Sherlock had truly wanted only two months ago, crying in his bedchambers at night in the enchanted castle and wishing more fervently than he had ever wished before. But now, after everything, Sherlock could not help but miss John with a present ache in his chest.
John shook her head in dismissal, “you mean
Gently leaning down on the bed, so as not to jostle his dozing lover who was breathing deeply, on the crevice between asleep and awake. John settled between Sherlock’s sprawled legs and took in his plump backside, perfectly round and heart shaped where it jutted from his otherwise lithe, and lightly muscled body.
Spinning around, Sherlock came face-to-face with-
“John, that's-“ John sucked around the rim, darting his tongue in once, twice, fucking Sherlock’s hips in time with his thrusts. Sherlock tasted heavenly, like his lavender soap and something decidedly Sherlockian. John leaned back, feeling hopelessly breathless as he viewed the pink entrance clenching around nothing, opening slightly under John’s ministrations, just
Finally pulling his sword free, Moriarty turned to the beast who was backing away from him, hands up in surrender. Moriarty kept him moving until he was outside, leaning with his back against the balcony.
"You know I do, Sherlock. I have to go to this investment opportunity, but know I will miss you" he replied, looking up to his son that was currently staring out the window with a downtrodden expression. Siger did not wish to leave his son looking so unhappy, "Sherlock, you didn't tell me what gift you want for when I return."
When Sherlock looked up at John, she quickly turned her head away to preserve Sherlock’s ‘modesty,’ her cheeks slightly flushed from the princess' exposure. Sherlock rolled her eyes and, trying to ignore the pulsating heat gathering in her abdomen, she reached her arms up to rub the substance into her hair, ensuring to comb it through every curl.
Sherlock watched and, upon seeing himself as the background, snatched the phone out of John’s hand to look at it closely, ignoring John’s annoyed “Oi!”
“No, it’s too….
“How does it feel Sherlock, knowing that I am going to leave you tied up here, gagged and helpless, while I go talk to Lestrade? Look at you,” John tutted lightly, his eyes sparkling with mischief, “ you’re always so
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
“Oh, you’re not sorry yet, sweetheart,” John cooed in his ear, nipping it lightly as he continued to thrust in and out of Sherlock’s post-orgasmic body, “but you will be.”
Closing the door to the lavish suite with a click, John hunched against the door with a quiet groan. That has not gone well at all. Perhaps John had overanalyzed Sherlock’s original reaction when she had kissed her hand.
John smirked in response, refusing to give his little lover the upper hand, “of course, darling, but for now, follow me.”
Sherlock, who had gone still with shock and trepidation, holding his hands up in a placating manner, which was belayed by their shaking. He hadn’t realized the murder was still armed. Mistake. Potentially a fatal one.
John swallowed as he watched Sherlock’s downright pornographic display as he drank his tea, and adjusted himself discreetly in his trousers, coughing and glancing away.
For Beauty is found within.
Sherlock threw himself on his freshly made bed with a decidedly unmanly squeal of excitement: Tonight he had a date with John. His first ever.
“You.” Sherlock answered, gently setting down his violin and bow on the desk and walking towards John, leaning down at the same time John leaned up, their lips meeting in a synchronized kiss; moving gently against one another like whispers being traded back and forth.
And John knew that the Work was the most important aspect of life to Sherlock, the pursuit of the game and the thrill of success once the murderer was caught and apprehended. John knew that any form of sentimentality was viewed by Sherlock as a ‘chemical defect found on the losing side.’ John knew all of that, and accepted it.
There are nights when John stares longingly at the Scotch bottle on the top of the fridge, craving to take the edge off the memories with his deceitful wife, until Sherlock will draw him into the bedroom with promises of an “experiment.”
There Sherlock sat in his armchair, his nipples clamped like a wanton slut, moaning for it with his head thrown back as he began to reach a hand down to stroke his own cock.
was the craziest thing I’ve ever done,” Sherlock gasped out, unable to believe he had just sucked John off in their hallway, where anyone could have seen. Mrs. Hudson, the mailman, Mycroft-thank small mercies that hadn’t happened.
As if by unspoken mutual decision, both men sat up and began unbuttoning their shirts, turning away from each other and sitting on opposite edges of the bed to take off their trousers, pants, shoes and socks.
Once they had tended to their horses, a young, stammering page guided them both to the council chambers for an audience with the king.
“No! You wouldn’t” he exclaimed, and John reached on hand up to stroke down his back in a soothing manner.
Sherlock saw the soft grin on the soldier's face and felt confused- no one had ever reacted favorably before.
He was practically delirious with denied pleasure.
John allowed this perusal for a few moments, never one to be body shy. But after a while of staring, John realized that Sherlock was caught somewhere in his massive intellect, and needed a push.
“Color, love,” he commanded, and Sherlock took a few heaving breaths, trying to control the stinging and burning from the wideness trying to enter his body.
“Master! A mob is approaching the castle,” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed, rushing into John’s chamber and relaying the news.
Sherlock’s large hands clawed at the armrests as he tried to control his pleasure, failing fantastically. The throbbing of his arse around John’s cock causing him heart palpitations, his skin positively dripping with sweat as he wriggled around on his possessive lover’s erect member, feeling helpless to escape the sensations as he was held down.
John cleared this throat pointedly, and Sherlock continued, breathing faster in anticipation:
What if Moriarty wasn’t truly gone? What if another criminal in London sought out him or John to enact revenge?
“Prisoner!” Sherlock gasped, not waiting to hear anymore before bolting up the stairs, coming to an empty room containing what appeared to be cells on either side of him.
“Am I interrupting?” A soft voice echoed in the vast bedchambers, and Sherlock spun around to positively scream at the intruder and vent her rage on the unforeseen target, until she saw who it was.
After a few more moments of bliss, Sherlock sagged down, whining incoherently until John turned off the vibrator.
admitted his feelings for Sherlock, even if just to himself, crashed over John as he stared at the detective in wonderment.
“What are you looking for today? Something for your wife?” The woman-
-“ John gasped, running his fingers through Sherlock’s wet curls, scratching lightly at his head while Sherlock gave him the most inexperienced, sweet and pleasurable head he had ever received.
John watched, his mouth gaping, as Sherlock stood in front of him, clutching his arms self-consciously in front of him which were spreading with goosebumps as John’s eyes roamed up and down his bare legs, settling on the bulge in his small panties that fit him perfectly, squeezing and cradling his half hard cock.
Sherlock gaped as he stared at his reflection. The chemise was utterly perfect, and he knew John would love it. He had originally decided to go shopping for lingerie to surprise John, and make his lover happy, but now Sherlock was realizing he truly enjoyed the experience of wearing the silky gown.
“Experiment” has become a euphemism for new sexual exploits, but John isn’t complaining.
Sherlock set up a chemistry lab in one of the many bedrooms in the castle, and attempted to keep the fires to a minimum. And while he didn't always succeed, John was always amused to see Sherlock's hair blown wild, his eyes sheepish as he explained to John how the particular chemical reactions blew up. Alongside his work, Sherlock helped Molly tutor Rosie, taking her daily out into the gardens to point out botanical life during the day and the solar system at night with a telescope.
, what-” Sherlock cried, scandalized and unbelievably turned on, his cock twitching against his stomach as John lightly kissed on and around his pink entrance.
But Sherlock, never one for vanity, was embarrassed by the whispers and jeers from his peers and siblings, and would often cry to his mother and father before bed, begging them to allow him to be homeschooled and escape the other children.
Sherlock’s mind was racing, trying to absorb the new information and catalogue it in his mind palace, which he wanted to restructure too look similar to this castle with more light and a slightly cheerier atmosphere.
Sherlock thought with a contented sigh, happily swaying in John’s arms to the beautiful music in the candlelight, feeling utterly safe with the once terrifying beast. The scene was like a passage in his sister’s romance novels, but far more lovely, because it was real.
Quickly, John texted Mycroft.
“Hello, Dr. Watson,” he said, his baritone voice soft, “my name is Michael, I am a new nurse here, and I was sent to get your paperwork.”
“Glad to hear it,” he answered with a wicked grin, reaching one hand to grasp at Sherlock’s bony hip and the other a finger up and down Sherlock’s crevice, searching for his entrance but in no hurry.
His once kind, emotive face etched with anger
Once Sherlock began to whine from oversensitivity, John gently pulled the washcloth from his bruised, well loved bum. He shampooed his hair, gently untangling the curls with his doctor's fingers until sherlock was in a near comatose state of relaxation as he lounged in the bath.
John lifted his head briefly, looking at the sight Sherlock made, black covered chest heaving, her nipples about the break free. A pink flush rose over her beautiful cheekbones, and her hair was in a wild spread of curls around her head like an angelic halo.
Sherlock, still clutching the white rose, turned slowly and stared at the door, the silent challenge lying in his wake.
“Slowly, gently,” Sherlock whispered against John’s reddened lips, and he paused, a guarded look still in his eyes, but he nodded. Sherlock pushed him gently back down, following his path with his lithe body until he was laying on top of John, chest to chest, controlling their kisses as John slowly gave up his rigidly held control.
Before the beast could enquire further, concerned by his bemused expression at the simple kiss, Sherlock was off, racing to grab the book on bees and then out the door, calling back “later!”
Sherlock was wearing lingerie. Sherlock was wearing black, lacy lingerie with make-up and her hair was down, curling around her features and-
“Who do you belong to, Sherlock?” John asked, interrupting Sherlock’s shaking voice as he continued to thrust the thick vibrator lazily into Sherlock, ignoring Sherlock wriggling attempts to escape.
“Come, John,” Sherlock called, darting out of the cab with the energy that allow accompanied him on cases. John exited the cab and placed a hand on his back, guiding him towards the open doors and inwardly smirking at Sherlock’s fiery blush at John’s obvious display of possessiveness.
“John, please-“ he began to beg, but John shook his head, his eyes half lidded in pleasure as he continued fucking him, Sherlock’s over sensitized hole beginning to drip around John’s still hard member.
He had known he wanted John in his bed, giving him pleasure, but he hadn't realized how much he had come to want this easy intimacy that John always achieved with other people, but Sherlock was unable to.
And that was how Sherlock became, quite literally, trapped on John’s hard cock, sitting naked in his lap with John’s large hands holding his hips down with a punishing force,
(See the end of the chapter for
And with one last kiss, John also fell into an exhausted sleep.
And Sherlock was his. His to love, tend to, care for. And he had nearly died today.
Sherlock had never much been interested in others in a physical manner, always preferring his books to dreary companionship and therefore never building any romantic connections. Despite Moriarty’s many attempts back in Sussex, Sherlock was entirely uninterested in him and his poorly laid innuendos. Intellectual abilities were attractive to Sherlock, it was true, but sentiment was a necessity in a romantic relationship, and Sherlock knew that he needed affection. Moriarty was cold, his smiles never reaching his eyes and his actions never kind.
He just-
John stood with military precision- her back straightened and her uniform utterly perfect. Her long blonde hair was plaited and in a bun, the only perceived flaw in her appearance was the small blonde fly-aways that circled her head in the candlelight. Like other guards she wore trousers, but Sherlock could imagine John in a beautiful dress while fitting in perfectly with the stuffy elite.
“You can’t pretend you don’t love this,
“You will count, and thank me for each spank,” John announced once Sherlock’s struggles to break free calmed down, and the naughty detective nodded, his voice choked off from embarrassment that John was going to spank him- like a four year old- yet again.
“I think they were, Lestrade,” Molly said gently, “but as they never admitted their feelings, the curse remains unbroken.”
“You won’t flirt with anyone like that for a case again, will you, Sherlock? Because if you do, I will turn you over my knee and spank you right there. And they will see how much you secretly love it,” John declared calmly, softening his spanks to soft pats and watching the blush colored cheeks jiggle, and small plug just peaking out from between those two luscious mounds.
“So, you want to know why the beast would destroy the portrait?” She asked hesitantly.
Sherlock shook Mycroft's pompous voice from his head, just as annoying as he remembered, but realized he was right.
That is, until the love of his life cleared his throat softly, approaching him to whisper, “John, I know you’ve missed Rosie, but we need to go check on the rest of the castle inhabitants. So follow me.”
“Sherlock is, she's, well…. I’ll let you see for yourself,” Lestrade commented with finality, sounding distant to John’s ears as night began to fall around them and the conversation drifted off.
“I just-I don’t know how-why is he so frustrating?” John complained to Mrs. Hudson, who chuckled and hopped onto the table so she could see John face to face.
John shook his head as he read through his blog, reminiscing about the many ridiculous cases he and Sherlock had partaken in when he first moved to Baker Street. Remembering his first impressions of the enigmatic detective.
She wanted to be more than a beautiful figure for the public to admire.
“You’re absolutely right Mrs. Hudson, we owe our freedom to Sherlock, who is truly beautiful in every way,” he pronounced, and Sherlock, whose face had lost some of its high color, turned rosy once more as he turned away to hide.
“Good boy,” John whispered, striding forward to tangle his fingers in Sherlock’s curls gently, and Sherlock pressed up into his hand, feeling warmth spread throughout his body at the touch and his kneeling position. John walked behind Sherlock, reaching down to pull off his coat and suit jacket, running his hands down Sherlock sinewy arms and smirking slightly at his shiver.
Sherlock then looked over at John with a slight glare: "is it normal to harass your lover after they have given you an orgasm? I may not know from personal experience, but I don't think it is appropriate bedroom etiquette John" he informed the doctor with a sniff, and John snickered at Sherlock's put-upon expression, leaning down to place kisses on his elegant neck and collarbones.
Shaking his head, John glanced down at his vibrating phone, seeing the surgery had called him into work.
After a moment more, John spoke, “Alright Sherlock, I need to know what you want out of a relationship. Obviously neither of us will change in our day to day lives, you will still put body parts unmarked in the fridge and I will still put up a fuss about it-“ John said, and Sherlock huffed out a small chuckle at that, “-but if you want intimacy, romantic or otherwise, then we need to talk about what we want out of a relationship. So tell me, Sherlock, what do you want from me?”
Just as John began to lower his face once more to capture Sherlock’s pliant lips with his own, a knock sounded at the door.
Closing his eyes, and biting his plush lower lip, Sherlock spread his hands, biting into the tender flesh of his well-spanked arse with a whine and exposing himself for John to see.
John began to slow the kisses after a while and the kiss came to a natural conclusion with light pecks exchanged until both men’s breathing had evened out. John stood back, and looked at the disheveled man in front of him. Sherlock looked utterly debauched with red, shining lips and his curls fluffed from John stroking during the kiss, his cheeks flushed a deep crimson from exertion and, John deduced, his natural newness to romantic intimacy. Realizing Sherlock Holmes, the great detective and genius, was blushing from a few of John's kisses cause a fierce surge of happiness through John that he couldn't ignore, and the doctor was looking forward to kissing his love many, many times if it would receive such sweet reactions from the supposedly "cold and calculating" detective.
“Well?” John asked, and Sherlock braced himself, looking up and seeing John standing in parade rest, ever the solider in uniform. The golden buttons were shining, having been freshly cleaned, and every line in the black suit was crisp.
What if she wasn't good at sex? Would John leave her, go and marry a man and have his children?
. What do you call the man who controls your pleasure, your body, your heart?” John growled, and finally,
John’s cock was throbbing, hot and needy against the bed sheets beneath him, but he felt a craving for a taste of the arse he had taken so thoroughly the night before.
“I’m here, bee, I’m right here,” the man said, his voice choked with tears, disbelieving he was holding his son in his arms once more. Sherlock nuzzled further into his chest, the feeling of home washing over him and settling his frayed nerves.
“No sweetheart,” John whispered, bringing their linked hands up for him to kiss Sherlock’s own, “tell me what I want to hear like a
Siger glanced down at the magic mirror and back to his son, who was looking at the rose sitting in the kitchen with a pained expression on his pallid face. Taking another puff from his pipe, Siger contemplated his next words carefully so as to not upset his son further.
John, at seeing Sherlock’s submissive action of acceptance, could wait no longer to plunge himself inside his beloved, the pulses from his purpling member becoming to much to bear.
A little too beautiful for a boy, a little too quirky with science experiments that blew up and singed the tips of his curls, a little too observant and not good enough with social queues to know when to keep his deductions to himself.
Sherlock untied Philip’s tangled reigns and turned to continue walking down the forest path towards home, but he paused for a brief moment.
“Why do you push me away?” John asked before Sherlock could escape into her bedroom, “Do you know what people say about you? The ice princess, rarely seen and never heard from.”
John was sitting in his armchair in 221B, drinking his tea, reading the newspaper and trying to ignore the nervous prickling at the nape of his neck. The flat was quiet, calm, and utterly ordinary.
“Fine,” the beast grumbled, and he sank into the tub, secretly enjoying the warmth against his matted fur but refusing to give Lestrade the dignity of being right.
They leaned their foreheads together once the sensations had finished, and whispered sweet nothings to one another, wiping each other off between kisses and declarations, before falling into a blissful slumber.
“See something you like, then?” John asked teasingly, walking forward a few paced until his was chest to chest with Sherlock, his eyes darkening with a challenge. Before Sherlock realized what he was doing, he was falling to his knees, looking up to John.
"John, I need it, give it to me," Sherlock whined, annoyed at John's lack of attention in the early morning at 221B.
“I-It was the easiest way the distract him. I’m his type…” Sherlock explained, but John’s grip on his forearms only tightened at this.
Sherlock reached forward, placing a delicate hand on his expansive chest to feel his heartbeat, and John placed his paw over Sherlock’s hand, drawing their fingers together.
Sherlock’s cock released once, twice, three times more; coating his stomach in release as he whined and held onto the wrinkled sheets for dear life as his took his pleasure unheeded and uncontrolled.
Mycroft refused to acknowledge her rank, calling her John with a dismissive air of the upper class, and John gritted her teeth against the barrage of insults that she wanted to yell to their pompous sovereign.
“Thank you, you look very fine as well. Princely, even,” Sherlock responded, realizing too late what he had implied and wishing that he could take it back. It was too late; the beast was staring at him curiously, without a hint of anger, but a look of deep contemplation gracing his features.
Inside the tavern, Siger had given Moriarty a brilliant plan, and Moriarty was already plotting his next scheme.
Sherlock's first time: riddled with fluff and love-making. I think I gave myself a cavity this time. Enjoy.
“Her highness has been taken ill by all the excitement- I am taking her back to her chambers. Please inform his majesty.” With a solitary nod, John stepped away from the slightly startled guard to carry Sherlock back to her chambers.
“Love you,” Sherlock slurred sleepily, and curled up on the duvet, still covered in his own release, and fell asleep moments later.
John always pictured the princess from a fairytale her mother used to read to her and her sister Harry when they were young. She probably had long, golden hair, a meek disposition, and adored the color rose.
“Alright” Sherlock agreed affably and, delighted, Molly and Lestrade began to wander down the corridor to the left of the staircase chatting amongst themselves about their favorite novels and memories in the library while Sherlock, remaining behind, shook his head at their gullibility.
Before he could even whisper out a retort, John began raining down harsh smacks on his backside.
“Hmmm. Let’s see if your arse matches the blush on that lovely face,” John said with a smirk in his voice, gazing fondly at the red he could see from Sherlock’s slightly hidden face, reaching up to grasp the back of Sherlock’s pants and tugging them down, keeping a tight hold on Sherlock’s hip in the process.
, caused a burst of fondness to expand in John’s chest, and he shook his head with a laugh at his contradictory detective.
,” he roars with complete abandon, the walls echoing from his discontent, and Sherlock was terrified.
With a sigh, Sherlock hailed a cab and rode in silence to New Scotland Yard, wishing a certain army doctor was sitting beside him.
"JOHN, please. I can't think without it. I'm desperate; I'm on my knees. I know how much you love me on my knees..."
Michael watched John’s face closely as he shook himself from his imaginings, and refocused on Michael.
John tucked a few stray curls from Sherlock’s reddened face, and kissed his forehead, biting back a smile as Sherlock leaned into the easy affection.
He held Rosie close, cradling her against his chest as if she were a newborn, and refused to take his eyes away from her angelic face for even an instant.
When Sherlock heard John lingering at the door, he huffed, rolling his eyes, "I'm busy with an experiment John, go away."
He moved over to the privacy screen and began undressing, putting on the new clothing and ignoring the chattering of the objects- that is,
Sherlock’s cheeks suffused with color at John forcing him to drink his tea, as if he was an infant, and nudged his hand gently away with his elbow and an embarrassed cough.
The spirited detective would not be dissuaded, trying to move his hips down further despite the burning sensation, but his strong-willed lover held his hips fast, looking down with a warning glimmering in his hardening eyes.
Siger wondered to himself for a moment, the question giving him pause. After a few minutes of observing the surroundings, and feeling confident that he was alone, Siger dismounted Philip and pushed on the huge iron gate roughly, hearing a screech that indicated it had not been used in many years.
“Whatever is in this vial from Dr. Carberry’s study is in some saliva I found on this piece of clothing…” Sherlock finally let out.
Sherlock nodded before pointing to the parlor. “Shall we?” John nodded back as he let Sherlock walk ahead of him.
“Are you part of the Guild, Mr. McArthur?”
my most trusted informant, Mr. Wiggins.” Sherlock started with a slight grin as he turned around to face his desk, “let’s leave now.”
Mycroft groaned again as he struggled to keep up with Sherlock now hobbling from the fall. Sherlock ignored his brother's pained protests as they walked back to the block behind the house to hail a hansom. Mycroft continued to complain about the fall and Sherlock’s pursuit of the facts all the way to the other side of the city until they arrived in the Whitechapel neighborhood, one of London’s poorest neighborhoods.
“Dr. Hans Schuller, Dr. Watson. We needed him and your colleague, Dr. Carberry, was in the way. He was working on something that posed a challenge.”
One of the women walked up to the pile before angrily grabbing her things. Sherlock and John watched her walk away before turning to each other.
Inside the pub, Sherlock dusted himself off before walking up to the front counter. He looked around, trying not to look like he was being chased before spotting a man in the corner, hunched over his drink. Sherlock waved the bartender off before sauntering over to the table. He sat down across from the man before addressing him.
Bridget choked on sob before answering. “I was in my room. Clara will be able to tell you.”
Wiggins nodded before quietly crossing the room behind Mycroft who appeared unaware that they had company as he dished out two pastries for himself and Sherlock, still complaining about his brother living in the city. Wiggins managed to close the door to the sitting room quietly as Mycroft finished his thought.
John attempted to readjust his position, but the restrains that kept him chained to the uneven table were making it difficult, essentially fulfilling their purpose.
“Murder.” Sherlock finished for the director who laughed nervously making the entire situation even more awkward than it needed to be.
Saxon’s expression was now a mixture between surprise and frustration as he realized such an obvious mistake that marred his otherwise perfectly executed plan.
A loud ringing pierced John’s ears as he stopped rolling, finding himself looking up at the mid-afternoon sky. The ringing continued as he looked back at the house, or what was left of it.
The two exited the kitchen through the side door. Sherlock crouched down near the knife, studying it before picking it up.
“Monsieur McArthur.” Madame Loire repeated sternly, crossing her arms as she tapped her foot in indignation.
“Well, Mr. Fedorov, reputation matters somewhat when one investigates a case, however,
“Mary?” Both Mycroft and Mary turned to face Sherlock who had emerged from the bedroom while buttoning a fresh shirt.
The secretary smiled before closing the door. “Holmes,” John started as he turned to sit on the sofa, “what should we do now?”
“Watson, it’s not polite to spy!” Sherlock shouted from the top of the stairs.
“Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft began, “I’m sure you can make some sort of concession for my brother to see the Doctor. I
Gladstone sniffed the hat once more before running toward what looked to be an abandoned factory building near the water’s edge.
After a moment of awkward silence, the group reshuffled to congregate in the adjoining sitting room. Sherlock huddled near John at the fireplace. John was trying to have a conversation with him, but it was clear that Sherlock’s attention was elsewhere.
Sherlock stepped in front of John to wedge himself between Detective Baynes and his companion. “Detective Baynes, what is the meaning of this? Where’s your warrant and where is Lestrade?”
“This man looks like he was in a fight for his life…” Sherlock nearly whispered as he carefully inspected the priest’s clothing and devastating wounds, “…but with what, is the question…”
Sherlock shook his head. “We need him to track the nephew.”
“Murder, Detective Baynes? What proof do you have?”
Mycroft hummed to himself as he read the newspaper, but before he could really consume the latest political news, there was a knock at the door. Mycroft wiped his hands with a napkin before sauntering to the door. As soon as he opened it, he expressed his confusion, for he did not recognize the visitor.
Moriarty nodded with a coy grin. He was sitting at a small table in one of the nicest restaurants in London. Across from him was Basil Whitehall expressing his sincerest gratitude that Moriarty knew the former only saved for his most generous supporters.
“Holmes!” Lestrade shouted, equal parts relieved and annoyed, “I’ve been on edge because of you! And what in god’s sake are you doing here?! The police have been looking for you and the doctor!”
Detective Baynes regrouped as he escorted Sherlock and a terrified Mrs. Hudson out of their building to a separate automobile. They could see the officers manhandling John into a police wagon before whisking away abruptly from the scene.
“Save the mental gymnastics, dear,” Sherlock waved his hand around, “it’s a genuine request.”
Instead of responding right away, Sherlock sat up straight on the sofa. He blinked a few times before sighing, slowly swinging his feet out in front of him to rise from the sofa, taking his time before limping to the fireplace to lean against.
“Schuller’s asking to see you, sir.” One of the men greeted Moriarty, pointing behind himself at a narrow hallway that led to other storage areas in the cellar.
“According to a reliable source,” Sherlock started in a low whisper with his back pressed up against the brick wall of neighboring building, “Coney usually leaves his office around 1pm for lunch. He usually stays out past an hour, maybe two if he has a lead on a story.”
“I think I saw Mary. She was speaking with Coney.” John looked back behind himself, but the woman was gone.
Fedorov’s mouth fell open as he took a seat; he hung his head low. Sherlock and John waited for him to answer, but before he could say anything, they heard shouting coming from the solarium.
John groaned. “What, Holmes?”
The guards shuffled the prisoners inside, documenting their stay before throwing each prisoner into a designated cell. After being dragged down a set of stairs, one guard tossed John into a cell next to a man who was talking loudly to himself in the corner; John could tell that the man was erratic and would probably benefit from medical attention rather than imprisonment.
But how does this make the famous doctor a murderer, dear reader? Well, think about it.
“Holmes, do you have to be so careless?”
are you being framed, something about all of this is bigger than it appears. But I’m afraid I cannot provide further details as we are being watched.”
Fedorov shrugged. “No.” He responded curtly before marching out of the room.
“They said you escaped!” Mary started, “what’s going on? Mrs. Hudson is beside herself. Do you know the mess you both started? The police have been here since last night!”
Sherlock rose with his hand out toward the chair in front of them. “Mr. Fedorov, please take a seat.”
Mamhud nodded before slowly rising from his chair before exiting the room.
Mycroft nodded as he held out the special pass. “My brother and I would like to speak with the director for a visit with one of the prisoners. We have the correct papers.”
Mr. McArthur nodded with another smile. “That’s my dear daughter, Mary. She always practices on that damn thing around this time. My son, James, is out at the office on Market meeting with some clients.”
Mr. McArthur nodded as he walked with Sherlock and John back through the front parlor and out into the vestibule in front of the grand staircase.
The group grumbled back that they understood before one of the men stepped forward with his hand raised. Moriarty rolled his eyes as he beckoned the man to contribute whatever thought he had.
“You’re a very difficult man to track down, Saxon.”
John smiled slightly. “Mycroft has another estate on the edge of the city. We’re staying there until we figure this case out.”
The doors to the wagon flew open as some guards dragged John and the other prisoners out into the cold, dark night in front of what looked like a fortified castle. John cringed; he had heard stories about Westgate prison, but he never thought he would end up as a prisoner there.
“Hurry, Watson.” Sherlock commanded as he ran into the street before calmly walking to the front entrance of
“We would appreciate your full cooperation down at the Yard,” Detectives Baynes began coolly, looking back and forth between Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock, “the both of you, please.”
“…one of the officers found this when they were searching Carberry’s house…” Lestrade held up a little plastic bag containing a small pendant covered in dried blood before holding it out across the desk so Sherlock could see it.
morning?”
John swore to himself as he tripped trying to catch up with Sherlock who was halfway down the street and about to round a corner. John had to prevent himself from shouting for Sherlock to wait for him; he felt ridiculous in his disguise, having been forced to wear Mycroft’s clothes.
John groaned. “You don’t have to make it up…and, you don’t need my help…you could probably figure this out blindfolded…”
Mycroft took a bite out of his pastry before placing the plate on the nearest table. “Sherly…I don’t mean to upset you. I’m only concerned about your wellbeing…”
“Uh,” John looked at the man before looking back at Mrs. Hudson who was now surrounded by more police officers, “yes. May I ask what is the matter?”
Whitehall raised one eyebrow as he leaned backward in his chair, chuckling to himself. “Forgive me, but that’s not terribly distinctive, Dr. Moriarty.”
Mycroft was standing next to the fireplace in the front parlor of the mansion that sat on his estate on the edge of London. John was sitting in a chair facing Mycroft, huddled in a blanket. Sherlock walked over to John’s chair to hand him a cup of tea before sitting down to listen to Mycroft.
“Where then, Holmes?”
Sherlock smiled. “You two must be very close then.”
Sherlock kept his eyes on the book he was reading. “Then don’t say it.” He responded curtly.
They walked through the dining room into the hallway to find Mycroft speaking with Stanley.
Moriarty nodded. “Okay, take me to him, please.”
Sherlock leaned up against his desk. “No, Wiggins. I fear that this is becoming dangerous.”
“Mr. McArthur, I realize that some secrets need to stay secrets, but this a matter of great importance that requires your cooperation,” he then stepped to the side for Mr. McArthur, “so please, sir. I’m sure your business partners wouldn’t appreciate knowing that a ghost is haunting their most recent acquisition.”
Sherlock shook his head as he picked up the makeshift makeup kit he had cobbled together while hiding out at Mycroft’s.
Detective Baynes took his time acknowledging the officer as soon as Lestrade was out of sight. “Good,” he turned to face the officer directly, “anything in that room is evidence. Make sure it doesn’t get lost on its way to the Yard. Understood?” He commanded firmly which prompted the officer to nod back similarly.
Mycroft ignored them as he continued. “We have the delightful pleasure to be joined by Bridget Persephone Coventry,” he beckoned for John and Sherlock to follow him up the staircase.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, but first we need to see our judge.”
Lestrade groaned as soon as he laid eyes on Sherlock, Mycroft, and Mary entering through the main entrance. He was standing next to a junior officer in the main booking area.
“Piece of wood?” Saxon looked quite offended, “Don’t you see, Mr. Holmes, this is not just
John continued to express his skepticism with his companion’s statement, but then told himself that Sherlock appeared genuine in the moment.
John and Sherlock found a window that looked into the kitchen. Sherlock jimmied the lock to the window before hopping inside. John followed, landing loudly in the kitchen as Sherlock left the kitchen to enter the servant hallway.
“…there he only took one painting…
Moriarty walked up to one of the tables that had been set up for the event. He examined the cutlery before complaining to a servant that they needed to make sure everything was polished before tomorrow evening. Moriarty walked around the space once, inspecting the staff’s work, before retiring to his room for the rest of the night.
“What are you doing up here?”
After finishing dinner, the group then retired to the back parlor connected to the dining parlor to have tea. Both Sherlock and John were listening to James recount his experiences in Paris while Mr. McArthur and Mary were standing near one of the windows speaking quietly to one another.
Detective Baynes walked away from John, turning his back slightly before facing him again. “The evidence we have is minimal, but one piece of evidence was key considering your close relationship with Carberry.” Detective Baynes clasped both hands behind his back as he proceeded to explain some nefarious plan, all the while John watched him closely.
my companion here has been most helpful in my exploits.” Sherlock added, still smiling which eventually managed to settle a very annoyed-looking John.
John and Sherlock waited quietly in an alley where they could see the window that led into Conrad Coney’s office at
“Holmes!” John wrestled underneath Sherlock, “what on earth are you doing here? And
“I do indeed, however, we must figure out what Coney knows about the case. The fact that his source is likely someone from the Yard leads me to believe that there’s more to this case than we realized. Don’t you think the timeline is a bit constrained?”
Mycroft pointed to a well-dressed man asking some of the police officers questions. “Well, it appears that Conrad Coney has caught wind of this tragedy…”
They chatted a bit longer before the hansom stopped in front of their home on Baker Street. John hopped out of the hansom first and waited for Sherlock before opening the front door to the building.
“Ah! Dear brother. Have you and your
“While otherwise occupied, it appeared that the thief had taken off with the
Sherlock looked slightly up at Mycroft so he could look him directly in the eyes. A second or two passed before he nodded back.
Extremely confused by his companion’s behavior, but told himself that he shouldn’t be, John sighed as he got up from the bed to follow Sherlock. He found Sherlock opening the door to reveal one of the neighborhood children who led what Sherlock affectionally referred to as the “Baker Street Irregulars.”
Sherlock looked back at the sofa before nodding at the secretary. “Thank you, miss.”
“We’ll leave then.” Sherlock concluded, before trying to hand John the cup of tea again.
Mycroft smiled broadly. “Wonderful! Now how about you finish your breakfast before lying down. I’ll show you that game later this evening and maybe we can get Mrs. Hudson to cook a decent meal in the meantime.”
well. She told us.”
Mycroft jumped up from his chair to step in front of Sherlock with an outstretched hand to stop him from leaving.
They caught up with Gladstone who was now sniffing around in the holding area of the factory. Gladstone stopped at a spot before running through an open door and up a set of stairs. Both Sherlock and John followed behind before they came out on top of some walkways that overlooked the furnaces and vats on the first floor of the factory. Sherlock held out a hand to stop John to indicate that he could see a young man standing on one of the walkways holding something.
“I think we should all sleep well at night knowing that the
John nodded as he let go of William before walking over to Mycroft.
John’s jaw hardened as he stared down at the invitation, noting to himself that he should inform Sherlock about the event later.
Sherlock let John kiss him again, but he looked away. “Watson, you’re going to have to do better than that.”
Sherlock ignored his brother as he managed to pry the old window open before hopping inside. He poked his head.
Sherlock watched for a second before turning to John, clearly unbothered by Madame Loire’s fainting spells.
Sherlock shrugged as he pointed to a portmanteau for John to haul. “Really, Watson. Sometimes I feel like you forget who I am. I
“Holmes—”
The man scrunched up his face in disbelief. “Sir—”
“Enjoy your stay, Doctor.” One of the guards poorly joked as he slammed the cell door closed before sauntering away. John heard the guard bang a few times on the cell next to him to quiet the disturbed man down.
Sherlock rounded the desk to stand next to John at the visitor’s chair. “It also helped that he dropped his calling card when he left in such a hurry.” He smiled as he handed John a small card. John inspected the card to find a set of initials that matched the name of the judge from the case files.
“Holmes—”
“Holmes,” John started, pointing to the chair,” something about this chair seems…off.”
“Well, then, Professor Moriarty, if you insist…” Sherlock began as he rose from his seat, “while I find your inclination to spot defining character traits to analyze a criminal…useful…to say the least, I do believe some of your interpretations are far too simplistic.”
John dropped the portmanteau he was carrying. He glared at Mycroft. “A few close friends?”
John took a sharp turn that bounced Sherlock around in his seat. “Holmes, I would appreciate it in the future if you would tell me that I would end up spending a long, much-needed vacation with your brother. You know Mycroft’s feelings towards me.”
“Why did you act as if you were strangers?” John asked.
“Gentlemen, please!” Sherlock grabbed William by the collar, but was soon knocked to the ground by a wayward elbow. John ran over to help his companion, nearly dropping Mycroft who was sitting on the floor, still exceedingly dizzy.
Sherlock chuckled. “Thank you for the offer, but we must be getting on our way.” He winked at John before acknowledging the heiress again.
he did it. You should treat your colleagues better, Dr. Wheeler.”
But before the frightened young man could explain further, Gladstone barked as he broke away from Sherlock, running toward Henry.
“Watson!” Sherlock called as soon as he approached the cell bars.
“Proceed with caution. We also have reason to believe that the doctor and Mr. Holmes are working with Dr. Schuller who also escaped from Westgate. Dr. Schuller is widely known for his poisonings. I don’t think it’s a great leap to assume that the Carberry case and Dr. Schuller’s past are linked.”
