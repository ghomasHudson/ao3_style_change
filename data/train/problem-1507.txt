*************
“Sorry,” John’s words tumble out of his mouth like he couldn’t get them out fast enough. “Sorry, I was…” he sweeps his hand in a gesture to the table and Mary, who had now stood and was staring critiquingly at Sherlock.
******************************
One morning, after another night spent at Baker Street, John came down the stairs to silence. He didn’t really think much of it, sure Sherlock had taken to playing his violin in the mornings to signal John that he was there, but, that wasn’t every morning. Some mornings he was sat there on his chair or splayed out with his too large body hanging off the couch.
He should answer it he knows, but he supposes he could spare Mary a few Sherlock-less moments. No matter how he was aching to talk to him.
John had decided the day before that today would be the day he’d talk to Mary. He couldn’t put it off any longer, he owed her that much. After he told Sherlock of his plans he gave John a look that screamed ‘finally!’ and all but pushed him out the door. The look made John wonder how long Sherlock had harbored his feelings for John. However, he pushed the thought aside; right now, was about him and Mary.
“You’re worried I’ll look at you different.” He can hear Sherlock let out a great sigh. “I really don’t know what goes on in that funny little brain of yours. I am not looking at you any differently, John. You’re still my blogger and I’m still looking at you the way I’ve always been.”
John knew that he was basically the only one who didn’t know Sherlock was alive and he suspected he wasn’t Sherlocks’ first stop when he came back to London; but that that didn’t stop the sting that spread throughout him at the thought of not being a priority on Sherlock’s list. Not to mention Sherlock had
John should have known better. Of course, talking about it just the once wouldn’t be enough for Sherlock. He’d pick and prod at him until he confirmed every theory his impossible mind thought of. He had woken up to several texts from Sherlock, ranging from ‘What Hotel?’ to ‘Which shoes were you wearing?’. He doesn’t text back because by now the messages are several hours old and he doesn’t doubt that Sherlock has already figured out the answers to most, if not all, of them.  He wished, futilely, that Sherlock would let it go. It was in the past and it should stay there, but, he wasn’t naïve enough to believe that it would.
"Please," John said and feels a quench of thirst when he smells the aroma of red tea.
John thinks hard if he needs to cooperate or not, He does not want to do it because he gave his dignity but having someone in the room watching is not something he wants to choose either. He does not even know what to feel with the Voyeurism.
"Back off" Sherlock answered. Then they both laughed at the same time.
For the younger it is nothing but a fish-face and melodramatic nonsense, he put no mind and continue his work. The older knows his younger brother would be protesting, he can picture a frowning face that was hiding in the mask of his calm one.
They get inside the room and take a rest on the seats. John is cover in sweat from running and adding the heat of the weather, he wants a shower badly. Sherlock locks the door and starts to strip his clothes until he is standing naked. John takes the covers off of him and breathes the air for his lungs. He tries his best not to look at Sherlock's body, especially the downside. Sherlock looks at John and grabs his arm, to drag him into the shower.
"Is that a collar?" John asks and looks at the black strap collar with a metal ring in the middle.
"Take care of me then,"
"What are you buying?" John asked. Sherlock is looking around for something that he'll need for any minute since he already knows that, Someone will follow them and take John away from him. The only problem is when will the signs come out for him to figure it out.
The younger one scoffed, the maidens did not notice it. He thinks these maidens that are trying to look seductive just to get his attention when actually it looks idiotic in the first place.
He plans to escape when he is out of the cage, He is a soldier and he knows how to think a strategy to escape from a situation like these.
John pushed gently on Sherlock's shoulders away and then he moves his knees closer to his chest. John may not remember it that he is wearing a short dress and he did not notice his thighs and his legs are fully revealed.
John feels the hard and hot rod, slowly sliding inside his arse. He flinched a bit because of the thick size. Then he could feel it filling it.
"You speak well in a British accent for a foreigner," John said and Sherlock gives him a smile and reply.
"Relax, John, and it would be better if you relax" Sherlock whispered into his ear, John grabs Sherlock face to kiss him deeply.
John's prick stood hard and hot, he wants to touch it but Sherlock stops his hand before he could.
Not Beta read... yet. Excuse my grammars, sorry...  (^v^'')
"I'll be gentle and careful, I am certain you will receive more pleasure as much as I can do for you," Sherlock cover his words in full sincerity to convince John.
Sherlock replied "You got it right"
"MONTHS?" John said it out loud and Sherlock points at the five Durian fruits to the vendor.
"Wear this, I know this will make you feel more comfortable"
"Good observation, I could tell you the rules later, for now, we need to buy some things in the market" Sherlock hold out his hand. John stared at it looks confused at the moment.
John wakes up from his dream again which he thought that it is quite very detailed one, and he could only hope none of them is true. . . . But he was terribly wrong because he still feels the silk sheet and the cover of the bed. Same as where he has this very erotic dream with this brilliant guy. It is not a dream again he could wake up, looks like from this day onwards, he cannot say this is a dream anymore.
They tie his hands on the back using a cloth instead of rope; the Ex-Army Doctor thought it is comfortable. They used it to avoid the rope that scratches on the skin because it would ruin the "Gift" for the buyer. The Owner of the Slavery Auction looked prouder to see his delightful slave is been presented like a porcelain doll. Many Aristocrats are bitter to see, the slave that they want cannot take home with them.
"Nine" John answered while looking out for gladiators.
"I knew you would come" The older one speaks to his younger brother, he is sitting in the front of the seats where only it is for the Aristocrat. The younger one sits beside him, the maidens who are close to the younger one could only flush, being close to him. Some maidens tried to look seductive but it only met with his ignorance and cold eyes.
After John said his answers, Sherlock kissed him and he could feel the tongue wants to enter in his mouth. John let it in and then their tongue fight for dominance, Sherlock take advantage of their position and John surrenders, he let Sherlock take the charge. Then Sherlock uses his hands to spread John's leg slowly, John's body is trembling when he feels the tension.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then one of the maidens starts to cry and pointing at the blue laces. It is like she is trying to look pity so John would not refuse and just do it. He does not know why she starts crying but seeing a woman crying is not what he expected. John is a gentleman, he would not let a woman cry like that, being a nice guy, he did what they told him to do.
They made him wear many kinds of Toga, there is one Toga he did not like it because it is See-Through and it is made of silk. They even forced him to take down the undergarments but he refused to do so.
Thank you for Kudos! I'm happy you enjoy it.
It had a rhythm first but then it goes faster and faster, it is like the fingers are ramming inside.
I know it's short.
"We are not done yet," Sherlock said with some huffs.
Two fingers are now inside, scissoring inside of the hole to spread wider and lessen the tightness, then it turns into three fingers, inside of John's tight hole. It goes in and out, Sherlock is trying to find the prostate.
There is one thing he is glad, that they tend his wounds which he really needs it so that he can escape on the way to the Buyer's home with full strength. He composed himself again to make him look tough but it only ends up some maidens to coo at him. When the time is up, they lead the Ex-Army Doctor to a carriage with a lined up guard outside, it is such a shame to see it because they are cautious that he would escape while transferring him.
The pirate captain who smiled smugly when he sells a good price to the owner of a Slavery Auction in Greece. The Ex-Army Doctor could only groan through a thick cloth that gag in his mouth, The Pirate look at him again before he bids his farewell with mockery.
"I-I...Fine." John thinks Sherlock has a point but it still feels awkward with a man inside the bathroom, both of them naked.
"How would they know that?" John touches the padlock on the back of his neck. Feeling the smooth metal that locks his freedom.
John pulled away to breathe some oxygen, then he saw his body is naked while Sherlock is still fully dressed. Then he is surprised when Sherlock pulled him down, now his back laid on the back comfortable.
John looked down to see some of the men wearing leather armor and a wooden sword in their hand looks like practicing sword fight but there is a difference somehow. There is something that it does not feel right. Maybe they are guards in training but when he saw another man with a black leather whip in his hand. He looks like a supervisor watching them.
Sorry for the wait, here it comes, two chapters to make amends with you readers. :D
"Sherlock Holmes is my name and what is yours," Sherlock said it in a statement instead of a question and still pinning the Ex-Army Doctor in place.
"Brother mine, would you please go outside and have something to do, then making any further experiments in your quarter or else I expropriate all your. . . . subjects at once"
Sherlock stands and motions his hand on the boots and John gets up from the bed and proceeds to wear the boots and after that, he stands properly on the ground.
"Suck it," Sherlock commands and John begin to suck the fingers then another one comes in until it is coated with his saliva, Slick and wet.
John blushed at the realization of his mind that he even think to CONSIDER it. He erased the thoughts and continue to walk through the corridors. Might as well memorize the routes so that one day he could escape without them to notice he is gone. He saw a maiden wearing a violet toga, who looks surprised to see him in the corridors.
*****************************
“…I have to go now. Mary. She’s waiting for me,” John’s transferred his gaze to the wall behind Sherlock and manages to catch Sherlock’s fist forming a tight ball before he utters a quiet ‘of course’.
since that very first meeting and honestly, he should have known Mycroft was keeping an eye on him, the bloody man saw everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
He sits back in his chair, going back to his phone. This admission seemed to enough for Sherlock, for now anyway.
He falls asleep next to Mary next to him and tries not to think.
“And then?” he prompts.
John narrows his eyes and closes his laptop. Sherlock was not going to do this to him, he didn’t get to analyze whatever it was he was analyzing about John to think he'd attempt suicide again. John wasn’t going to let him evaluate his every move as if John was a danger to himself. “What is this about Sherlock? If you think I’m prepared to do something like that again then—”
She’s upset, understandably, doesn’t want to see him for a while—possibly ever. He can’t help but feel that a small part of him is gone with their relationship and he vaguely wonders if this is the symbolic loss that his therapist was trying to tell him about.
“It’s a spilt lip, Sherlock. People get them.”
“I know,” John said.
***********************
This goes on for longer than John cares to admit.
Thankfully, there are no more panic attacks at the prospect of he and Sherlock not being in the same room, but that doesn’t mean they can just let each other be.
Everything’s moving in slow motion, drowning out and becoming loud again. He really didn't think Sherlock would call him out on it, he thought he would let them live out the rest of their days in eye contact-less bliss. Sherlock’s words are echoing in his ears and he can’t. Not looking Sherlock in the eye is his last line of defense, against Sherlock and against himself. John can admit that Sherlock has far too much power over him and he’s been trying (and probably failing) to not have Sherlock hold such a grip over his life. John was too dependent on him and that wasn’t going to work out well for either of them.
Sherlock texts him about a case and he almost doesn’t go. He doesn’t want the help the man who had faked his death for two years. Who put John through hell and a series of 3 therapists. But Mary, bless her, somehow convinces him to go and John can’t shake the feeling that she’s going to regret thrusting him back into Sherlock Holmes’ orbit.
“You want a cuppa?” he calls from the kitchen. He was sure Sherlock rejected Mrs. Hudson because he didn’t want to be bothered with her prattle, not because he didn’t want any tea. His suspicions proved true when Sherlock leaped from the couch in one fluid motion with a resounding “Yes! If you would!”
************************
John almost chokes on his coffee, “Excuse me?” He subtly looks around the café, luckily not many people are present besides Sherlock and himself.
John is sure it’s taking every muscle in Sherlocks body to keep him from rolling his eyes as he repeats himself, “I said: I’m sorry.” Sherlock walks towards John and plucks the jacket from his hands, effectively -in Sherlocks eyes- stopping him from leaving.
And John thinks that this why he loves Mary, her brashness and her no-nonsense attitude. She was there to fix him when he was broken, she helped pick up the pieces that fell away when Sherlock left. She made John stop going to the motions and actively participate in his own life again. He would think, that if not for hard edge he sometimes caught in her demeanor she’d remind him of Sherlock.
“I love you, too, Sherlock.”
“I thought you did, Sherlock!” John roared, slamming his hands on the table in front of him. “I thought I saw you die! I watched you jump off a building! I was on the phone with you when—” his voice broke and he had stop himself. He was on the verge of breaking down completely, his throat hurt from yelling and effort it took not to let a sob break through his sealed lips.
Mary sits down across from John and her smile drops a bit as they both hear his phone vibrate against the metal chairs. “Who would have thought I’d have to ambush you at your job for you to spend time with me,” she has a sort of contemplating look on her face.
I do not own Sherlock or anything associated with it besides the ideas in this fic.
And John’s saying yes before he even has a moment to think about it. And really, he shouldn’t have to, he loves her, she’s his girlfriend, and he can go out to get lunch with his girlfriend without thinking of all the places he’d rather be. So, John grabs his coat and they make their way out of the surgery. They walk in what John believes is an amicable silence but knowing Mary it could be anything but. Truly, she has every right to be upset with John, he did sort of abandon her to her own devices for over the better part of a week.
John does, at one point, ask Sherlock if had been looking at him the entire time, because he had been sure he hadn’t. To which Sherlock replies, ‘Of course not. How could I? Knowing what I had caused’. And that it wasn’t told John told him his story that he found the strength to. So, John leaves it at that. Silently pleased that Sherlock had had the same problem as him.
It’s not worse, John supposes, Sherlock looking at him the same. It’s an unimaginable relief, John lets out breath he didn’t realize he was holding. Sherlock was here, looking at him like he didn’t know John’s greatest shame. Maybe he didn’t care or maybe he’d gotten over it, whatever the case John was grateful. So, so grateful.
However, John was right, no eye contact was indeed his last defense against the whirlwind that was Sherlock Holmes. And now that wall had come tumbling down, he was completely and irrevocably attached to him again. Once again, Sherlock came before everything and everyone. The only saving grace was that it seemed Sherlock was depending on him just as much.
They we’re so ridiculously codependent that John was almost certain this advancement in their relationship couldn’t be healthy. But, what could he do? The heart wants what the heart wants.
She’s pointing the menu at him now looking him hard in the eyes, “But, don’t you think for a single second John Watson that you’re going to get rid of me that easily!”
Honestly, the nerve of the man. Pot and kettle. “That’s really quite the hypocritical statement there, Sherlock.” He’s still just sat there, statuesque, save for the fingers that had now moved to clutch the edge of the table in a bruising grip.
“Excuse me,” John says turning around to face Sherlock.
It’s one of those instances where they’re standing too close. They’re in the kitchen, standing in the aftermath of Sherlocks failed experiment. There are what John believes to be human entrails in Sherlocks hair and some sort of fluid underneath John’s boot.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s responding to Sherlocks texts with a ‘please stop sending me pictures of decaying eyeballs’ when there’s a knock on his door. He doesn’t know who he was expecting but he certainly wasn’t expecting Mary.
And John guesses Sherlock can see the weariness on his face or hear the fatigue in his voice because he slowly rises from his chair and walks steadily over to John.
“So, I’m just stood there, in the middle of the room, gun in my hand. Staring at my phone like it’s personally offended me and all I could think was ‘I can’t kill myself on my sisters’ birthday’. That wouldn’t be fair to Harry, having to deal with all that. So, I put my gun away…” John’s eyes are still staring at his hands on the table. He wonders what Sherlock thinks of all this. John is sure Sherlock could understand his reasons of attempting suicide, but not so sure if he’d understand his reasons for not going through with it. “I stayed with Harry for a few days after her birthday and thought about trying again. But, then it was someone from calling me to cover their shift, so I couldn’t do it that day. Then a finale of a program I had been watching or a conference I had to go to. Just little things like that, things that pushed me to keep living another day.”
Speaking of Sherlock, he has been texting almost non-stop since he left for work this morning. All nonsense really, just a stream of consciousness that lets him know that Sherlock is fine and still there. For his part John responds when he can, because he’s sure that Sherlock can feel that gap between them just as intensely as John can, though he does better at hiding it. But John knows Sherlock, or likes to think he does and he doesn’t miss the way Sherlock’s jaw tenses whenever he makes to leave a room, or the way his hands become a little too restless when the silence stretches too long between them.
“You need to figure out who means more to you. The man who faked his own death or the woman who has done nothing but love you.”
“Because I love him,” John said simply.
Sherlock back’s up, releasing his hold on John face and John opens his eyes again. Staring into the blue that he loved so much. Sherlock’s mouth was set in a firm line and his brows were furrowed.
If they stand too close together at the crime scene no one mentions it. Though, John does see Lestrade give them an odd as Sherlock places a hand on John’s lower back when he crouches to inspect the body. And if he’s really paying attention he’d notice Donovan huff in disbelief when Sherlock stops ranting and raving about the uselessness of the Yard at John’s touch.
As John watches for a moment Sherlock wanders over to the fireplace with his fingers taping restless against his thighs, he noticed something was missing.
Except it wasn’t. Something was broken between them and John didn’t even begin to know how to mend it. Actually, maybe, he did and he had a feeling Sherlock did too, but he’d be damned if he was going to bring that up of his own free will.
John smiles, he understands, “Alright.”
Sherlock’s compassionate face turns into one of exasperation and irritation. He rolls his eyes, “No, you’re in love with the idea of her. She saved you and now you think you have to love her forever because of it.”
And there go his fingers again, tapping in that unheard rhythm of unease against the floor. “Now, I have nothing to presume but you planning to end your life again, John! Everything is fine until the exact moment it isn’t, so I need you to be truthful with me John when I ask you.”
At Johns, non-response Sherlock raises to is feet.  He’s walking towards John slowly, oh so very slowly, as not to startled him. But, honestly, he would have been preferred it if he was walking at his regular high- speed Sherlock pace.
John’s worries about giving Sherlock that last piece of himself was unfounded. As it turns out when you give someone your everything and they give you theirs in return, it feels like you aren’t missing anything at all.
They still sit in the same room and eat at the same table, but, there’s a lapse of conversation. Sherlock is being too proud to apologize for accusing John of self-harm, either that or Sherlock really doesn’t believe there’s anything to be sorry about. Which John believes just might be the case if the haughty way he’s flouncing about the flat has anything to do with it. And John, makes himself busy anytime he sees Sherlock facing his direction too long.
The head or the heart.
Before John can finish his sentence Sherlocks’ mouth is on his and John’s laughter dies on his lips. Sherlock’s moving hesitatingly and awkwardly, but his lips are just as soft as John remembers. He lets Sherlock lead for a while before placing both his hands on the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulling him further down. Then John’s kissing him slow and deep, running his tongue over Sherlocks bottom lip, making him gasp. Sherlocks hands find purchase on Johns waist as he steps closer, their bodies now completely flush against one another.
John didn’t say anything for a long moment, just fisted his hands in Sherlocks’ comfortingly obnoxious purple shirt.
After work John goes to Mary’s. He thinks owes her that, not to mention he doesn’t think he can take seeing Sherlock tonight.
She motions for him to sit on couch across from her and he does. She looks at him politely, as if she’s waiting for him to speak, but as soon as he opens his mouth the look turns sour. “So, you’ve made up your mind then?”
“Glad you missed me so much,” John huffed and turned to finish making the tea.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, okay.” And he’s picking up his coat and running off behind Sherlock before Mary can get in a word in edgewise.
So when I met him, and when he opened his mouth and said such ridiculous things, and appeared so untouchable, so full of self-regard as to not let anything derail him from his passions - I wanted to learn his secret.
''Most of it? All of it? I don't know! I just have never,'' he starts, stops. ''I feel strange. Saying it aloud. I feel exposed,'' he breathes. ''Saying those words, even to you. I know I can trust you - that's not it. But I hate myself for telling you that, even though you know what it's called. Know the name. Maybe because I hadn't really accepted it, myself. Not really.''
My god, Sherlock.
And it's readily apparent by the tension behind the smile, not fake, but strained - that his decision to see me, for himself alone - was also not in error.
"Sherlock. Please tell me. How old were you when it happened?"
John gives me a very slight smile. Barely noticeable.
''No, Sherlock. He spoke, I mean. Not much, but-''
This is certainly not an establishment that Mycroft would ever voluntarily enter.
To anyone else, he'd sound more or less okay. A little numb, perhaps, but superficially fine.
Support?
And I don't know why.
''Well, if Dr. Rouse arrives in the next few moments, please just let him know that I will only be but a minute.''
My head whips back and forth in denial.
I felt something distantly sad then - a pale sadness, and pushed it away.
Upset is making my hands shake.
''Please,'' he repeats. ''Don't make me. Not tonight. Just give me one more night.''
"Does it hurt your throat when you eat, or does it hurt you somewhere else?"
Which, of course, is frightening enough if you really think about it. But it's not quite as overwhelming as the other possibilities.
Mycroft glances over to his brother in pain.
''Not usually,'' he responds in a restrained voice. ''Sometimes I add marmite to it. To the miso, I mean.''
He turns, and looks back to me, eyebrows raised.
He's accepting those more lately, too. Talking more, accepting forms of physical affection, telling the truth and expressing his fears.
He makes it sound so easy.
"Did you hear what I said? Do you understand the harm you may have caused to this case? Does any of this register?!"
He trundles back to his bed, where he crawls away from me, before he repositions the duvet over his body.
''No you don't!,'' I hiss, just as angry now. ''You don't get to hurt yourself like this and expect people who care about you to stand around and do nothing! Friendship doesn't work that way!''
“I don’t know,” I reply, hating myself yet again for how lost I sound.
''I can't love you back. I can't even feel, inside, like-,'' and he pats his chest. I can sense his frustration and his urge to express feelings that are incredibly convoluted and potentially distorted by years of growing insecurity and breeding self-hatred.
Sherlock blinks at that. As if the idea that I may have slept next to another man in a non-sexual way is completely foreign to him.
''I'm not a specialist...I wouldn't make that determination,'' I confess finally. ''But perhaps.''
I open my eyes and see that his own eyes are almost wild.
I don't like how he calls it a 'diet plan.' I don't like that at all.
'I'm going to tell you something... As someone who does, in fact, love you...''
I feel better than I did outside, in the white-winter sunlight and the frost.
"Yes," he breaths harshly, as if the very air itself is heavy. "I never even knew my biological father. I don't even know how well our mother knew my biological father. I don't even know his name."
''I, Robot,'' I mutter. ''It was my favourite story when I was little. Well, when I was nine.''
The guilt will come tomorrow. Like it always does when I take out my piss-poor moods on an innocent person.
''It's...look: I have no problem with her being gay. But everything got messed up. Her sexual identity and her drinking. And sometimes that lead to some pretty bad stuff.''
I give him an encouraging smile.
When he speaks again, his voice sounds hoarse.
That's a good thing.
He even seems to have the capacity to work well with others when he sets his mind to the task. Yet, Sherlock has fashioned a life around his controls, and his ability to reject or allow the continued procession of a routine.
Force and holding and pain in their hands?
-------------------------------------------------------
It's nearly 11 pm before I make it back to Baker Street.
Sherlock is nothing but outspoken, but if I am doing something that is unnerving him - he's never shared this with me.
''Sherlock? You okay in there?,'' I called, suddenly aware of the boundaries I was crossing. Bisquick slumped to my side, seemingly at ease with Sherlock's dorm, although not Sherlock himself, now watched a colony of ants working this way and that, carrying pieces of what looked like toast or Hobnobs back towards an opening into the sand.
''You also called the ambulance, didn't you?''
His brows furrow.
Because he did punch a man that was innocent of hurting his son, apparently.
''Wow.''
Sherlock looks up tiredly. I can sense the weariness in his entire being. Partly bodily fatigue from poor self-care, but partly mental turmoil. His mind and body are fighting one another, and he likely doesn't know which one to follow. His eyes are ringed in black, and he looks even thinner than the last time I saw him in the hospital.
I know it seems crazy, but when I'm upset tea always makes me feel a tiny bit better.
If someone is sick with a stomach ulcer, which he had - it can go down quite a bit.
''I'm not fooling around, Sherlock. Not about this. Tell me the truth. Right now. Is what Dr. Riley saying true?''
''Then he needs a clinic! Inpatient, right? He needs to go in, stay in, be fed,'' and my voice is soft. Strangled. ''He might hate me, but so what? Is that what you think he needs?''
I clear my throat, trying to dispel the tension.
And morphine.
And that's when I realize that I am truly angry.
But for always.
"I should have. In retrospect, it's clear that he should have been taken to the hospital, but I foolishly decided to keep him home for yet another day, despite the fact that I knew I could not stay with him. At the time, I thought it was a better alternative than forcing him to go to school when he was so obviously struggling to keep himself together emotionally."
But that I hate being a freak?
It's the coldness that really is the worst part.
I take in his form. He's had his shower (his hair is still damp, but not sopping), and he's in jeans (something I've never seen him wear, honestly), but he's far from ready. Sock-less, still clad in a silk pajama top. He hasn't even shaved, and the slight scruff on him looks odd.
Won't answer.
The amazing thing, from my perspective, is that he attempts to deal with people at all.
I exhaled, shakily, the prickling of something that I called fear making a rare appearance.
Yet Sherlock...
I'm surrounded by bright, blue water. Tinted blue bath crystals.
Otherwise okay.
My mind races; I know I can't lose this thread, this 'in.'
I pull my hands back.
----------------------------------------------
Later he talked to me on the telephone. Mummy got me from the play room and smiled at me, and stroked my hair.
The nod is automatic; I can't help but relate, and perhaps - just a little - be soothed by Lestrade's assurance. His relay of the fact that Sherlock has been in worse positions before yet managed - somehow - to make it through.
Mycroft shakes his head, curtly. ''The doctors do not deem it a good idea at present; although, that has nothing to do with the quality of your company. He's in a lot of pain. Physical pain, I should specify.''
'I stuck my foot in my mouth, and I am sorry. I just wanted to help. I just want to see you get better.'
Still: I'm missing something so I press lightly against his arm. Tap his side. Let my hand touch his wrist bone. Briefly.
I push my face into the sand. It's soft and muffles my words.
''That's hardly anyone else's busine-,'' he begins.
My hands burn on my tea mug, but I ignore the pain. Or maybe I revel in it. I'm not sure.
And I find that mindset - of wanting to cultivate illness - hard to entertain. Perhaps impossible to fully comprehend, and yet no one can tell me that Sherlock wants to be like this.
I rub a hand through my hair again.
I see him frown at his stomach, and then see pale fingertips dance along his ribs, splay out over his torso. Press inwardly against his meager belly.
Sherlock seemed to tense at the compliment, but quickly responded with: ''I have played the violin since the age of three. It's hardly impressive that I can play at my current grade.''
The last readout - gleaned from the scale he had hid away in his room - had put his weight at substantially higher than what I am seeing as recorded from three days previous.
But he eats. More than earlier in the day.
''John-,'' and my voice is shrill.
''I don't know. But I think that's a pretty tricky subject for you, isn't it?''
''I'm at Molly's. My phone was almost dead. I turned it off.''
It's akin to if he'd just told me that he can't read. It's something that you know has to be patently untrue if only because you've seen the negation of the stated reality so many times beforehand, with your own eyes.
He lets out a shudder of an exhale and I wonder if what I said was too much all at once.
But one of those avenues is certainly going to be better than the others.
"When we were looking for Toby - when we thought this was an abduction case, possible ransom case - and we spoke to his teacher at the day school - she said some things to me that made me suspicious about Toby's home life."
''Please open the door, Hope. I am escorting your child back to the clinic.''
------------------
''You can't stay here! I'm not good for anyone. Mycroft is right - caring is not an advantage! I know you are going to leave, one day, and I can't-''
My best friend finally gives the detective inspector a pointed look.
We walk back to the living room, and I pick up the bottle of anti-anxiety medication. Try not to glance at John as I do so. Open it, and deposit one into my mouth before swallowing it sans water.
''Okay?,'' I croak, my voice sore and tired. Now I feel like crying, for all this talk of needing to vent.
''In asking the question, the student destroys the robot. It might not have ever wanted to be alone, to be alone in the entire universe - but then it realizes that it's not, and that's even harder. Maybe even scarier. It's reality is destroyed. So it dies.''
''Sherlock? Come on. I can't make this go away. I can't do this alone. I need you to communicate with me.''
Succumb to a heart attack. Or to a low electrolyte imbalance.
'Move over, Sherlock,' the explorer says quietly, driving up to me in his little space car. It's a bright and flashing space car and the light is reflecting off the sun, and hitting my eyes. I close my eyes tightly, so I don't go blind from the light, but move my little car to the side so the new explorer can make way.
''Yes. Say goodbye to here, Lockie. Say goodbye, and never come back.''
Sexuality had nothing to do with what happened.
Who in their right mind would toss that aside? Throw away the gift that is his very presence in their life?
Hot bile is scorching my throat, and I root around in my bedside night stand table. Open the drawers. Locate a small bottle of Gaviscon.
''Did he say anything else?''
predatory ways of young men and women, both, looking for a new mate.
''Sherlock Holmes?,'' a man asks. He isn't portly, but he isn't thin either. Maybe 5 ft 10, or a tad taller, with an age edging towards 50 or so. Dark blue eyes, horned rimmed glasses (oh, the cliché). Hair several shades lighter than John's. In no other way does he resemble John however; his face isn't engaging in the same way that John's is and he seems brisk, but not cold.
But I have to speak with him. It's the least I can do.
So the knowledge that he's his pushed all this away? It scares the bejesus out of me.
That's it. That's all it is. That's all it must be.
''As a child?,'' he asked gently. ''This started when you were very small, didn't it?''
This has to be physical. A disease. Maybe a cancer.
''Sherlock - oh God, please, fuck! - wake up, Sherlock!''
My head is pulled back quickly, from my neck, from my hair. The explorer is holding my neck in his hands.
''Keep reading, please.''
I look down dumbly and away from Sherlock's line of sight and see Horlicks powder - creamy and pale - coating the floor. Shards of glass, thick and typically unbreakable, lay near Sherlock's feet.
''I can spare a few minutes while I check in on another patient. But after that, we will need to get some basic discharge information out of the way,'' the older man adds unnecessarily.
to be honest with someone else, even when afraid to do so?
''I read your profile,'' I exchange coolly, ignoring the question, ''and supposedly you specialize in eating disorders in both males and adults. It's why the hospital assigned you to talk to Sherlock in the first place, isn't it? So don't make it out to be the case that you can't help him! I know you can fix him, if anyone can!''
His look, of course, is not one of appreciation. It's one of alarm.
A ripple of something very much like anxiety goes through me, and I make a mental note to buy a combination of nourishing and comfort foods for when he gets back. Maybe I can even stock the shelves with some treats.
He shakes his head back and forth.
I always feel it deep down. Under the cold masquerading as heat.
''Do you think maybe-?,'' he begins, then shakes his head as if the idea burgeoning forth is ludicrous. He obviously considers a direct question too nosy. Too intrusive.
''After the last week? You're going to mock my ability to think?''
Or almost anything.
"John!," the sudden insistence in his voice is unmistakable.
It's nothing new. His disinterest in eating.
''John?''
''Nooo,'' he drawled out. ''No, I meant anatomy drawings.''
----------------------------------------------
''Sherlock?,'' I ask gingerly a short time later. ''You seem to be angry with John. Can you tell me why?''
''Oh hell, Lock,'' I encouraged, ''I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd get this upset. I thought it was just first-time jitters. Please calm down.''
''I don't know how to answer that either.''
Ever the solider.
It is so much easier for me to piss off and aggravate others. Force their hand, and make them hate me. Make them stay away. And usually it works, too - the John Watson's and Molly Hooper's of the world aside.
The fact that I can never be this open with him when he's awake isn't lost on me. Even so, I hope that some small part of him is hearing me right now. Hearing my words and stashing them away for such time when I can't be with him.
And, more intricately now – the words from earlier repeat in my mind's eye. This time in Times New Roman font, as if the book is still held in my possession:
That in itself should have been a huge red flag that something was very, very wrong.
I look down, and realize with horror that I've urinated all over myself. I turn around, slide out and come to rest on the other side of the bed, pressing my face against the wall. Willing myself not to hyperventilate.
''How- how did you get through medical school? How-?''
''He was just the meaner drunk, Sherlock.''
The man started to hurry off, and I felt horrible for what had occurred.
Sherlock lets out a garbled, horrible cry-laugh.
And then Mycroft is gone with a scant padding shuffle and a soft turn of the door lock.
And everything hurts, and I don't know if I want it to hurt, or if I want it to stop. If I could decide on if I wanted his kindness, or if I wanted pain then maybe I would be okay. Not conventionally okay, so much as okay with myself.
''What's this, then?,'' he whispers softly, and how in a million years could anyone buy his sociopath routine?
Autumn 1995 - Spring 1996
''You wouldn't be the first survivor of this form of child abuse to conflate sex with rape. And it's not a crazy concern to wonder if maybe part of you - even if emotionally - wants to be sick because of the obviousness of what sickness means to everyone around you,'' I say briskly, needing to advance this challenge. Needing him to tell me that I'm wrong. That I'm way off the mark. ''Sickness of this form changes you in an overtly physical way, Sherlock. It visually and immediately communicates the fact that you are in pain, but also that you are not emotionally ready to relate to anyone in very certain ways. It tells everyone - everyone, Sherlock - that you are not to be looked at in a sexual way because it erases and distorts those sexual-''
''And that answers my question, how?''
I was not stupid. I knew something was up. A something people didn't talk about, in relation to men. Especially *not* in relation to men. And especially not of those who tried so damnably hard to keep it to themselves. Because I knew he was not avoiding eating for attention. It might have done a good deal for attention, sure - but I could see how he ate, how odd he was with it all, and I could also sense when he tried to play it cool. In this area, at least, his behaviour didn't stem from a need to garner attention at all.
“That’s what you got out of this?,” John exclaims. “Not, I don’t know – “these points are valid, and make logical sense”? Not “children devise the most creative and hopeful means to escape horror, and that these escapes are normal and indicate a state of mental health”? YOU are not a freak! You have never been a freak! Your reactions are entirely – entirely – understandable! That’s the salient point here. You did what you had to do to survive. SURVIVE, Sherlock. But just because you survived doesn’t mean that you got through that portion of your life unscathed! Everything was taken away-”
The analysis of 240 different kinds of tobacco ash is a safer and realer state of existence for me than one where John loves me at all.
This atypical fear.
''Do you feel that your eating is disordered?,'' I ask plainly.
Suddenly, before I can register what is happening, I feel his lips against mine.
The resignation in his tone alarms me.
''But you know he's prone to something very dark and very ugly and you never, ever told me until it was upon us all! Don't you see how those actions could trigger him?,'' I exclaim. ''How what you are doing could have set him off?!''
Her fingers, then, are at my skin again. Against my temple, my face.
He's deathly still and quiet, the rapidity of his earlier breathing starting to slow. As if the pain is grounding him.
And for some reason I cannot begin to fathom, he sounds almost hurt.
He doesn't respond, but I know he's heard me and he turns slowly around as I release him from my grasp and makes his way back to the sofa. From there, he turns towards the inner portion of the furniture, completely hiding his face.
And it's not just his knowledge, or his passion, but the innovative way he fuses science with something that seems to me (and which I believe he'd be loath to admit) strikingly intuitive. However, he is ultimately drawn to the structured composition of science being undertaken. Science being lived out, if only just because he can test for something, test for a variable. Make an alteration to a condition, and see the changes in the situation.
I continue to watch the bird.
A crib, and clothes, but the other elements removed.
“Alright. Can I ask how you are feeling right now?”
''I know what you are doing, Sherlock. And it's not going to work.''
Was my main concern.
Oh, this chapter is in Mycroft's POV.
Molly sighs.
Numbness doesn't work, but neither do feelings.
I will not let myself yell at him, nor shake him.
Donovan opens the door to the room, and softly makes her way inside, looking at me as if unsure how to proceed. She's been glancing at me far more than would be typical. Staring, studying. It's a little unnerving.
''Listen to me, Sherlock: you have nothing to feel ashamed about. You haven't done anything wrong. If you broke your leg...would you be doing something wrong in admitting that it was broken? Or to even expressing that it hurt you?''
Because something vile is already forming in my mind.
John backs up on his own now. An essential six or seven more inches in an opposing direction. I let out a pent up breath.
I say:
''Can you open the door, please, Hope?''
''You are not observing, John. You don't get it and I can't make you get it, and I don't want you to get it and-''
''Yes, we are done! I'm not discussing that with you! About how that makes me feel, because you certainly won't like what I have to say, and it's all,'' and he makes a motion about his skull, a flittering, flapping motion that I merely take to mean 'noise', ''nonsense anyway!''
The intro to this chapter will mirror the previous chapter’s opening in certain regards and essentially will show a different side to Yuri – one in which he deals with the same issues and emotions as anyone else.
But something about the prettiness troubles me. Suddenly makes me feel unwell. Strangely nauseated.
My mind hisses with shame.
''What do you choose?,'' John asks again.
''What was the context?,'' I ask Lestrade a few seconds later, ''of Toby's request.''
''Please. Please let me see-,'' I fumbled with my words, my face - I could feel - beet red.
The departure throws me for a loop. I am used to his off topic ramblings though, so I respond simply, ''I didn't feel much of anything. I wasn't surprised. I had suspected how Harry felt for other females for a long time. I think I knew before she did, even.''
''Ahh, speak of the devil. Yes. That's Patrick.''
Until I realize that who he is and how he thinks and how much he means to me - to my heart and spirit - means very little to the Universe, or to whomever governs Universal affairs.
Sherlock looks away in frustration; I observe the body language between the two of them for a few moments.
''Sherlock, I know that, sometimes, emotions can be hard to name. But you must hear that passion in your voice. That's not a lack. That's the opposite of a lack of something. Nothing about you is lacking!''
How the wood paneling would appear and feel as you walked over it each morning, and how the objects would singe into your memory with comforting familiarity. How the decorations of the house would become a background hum in your mind, and how the white-painted bathroom with the lemon-yellow soap would smell like cleanliness, and not of threats.
"That must have been extremely awkward for a young boy," I mutter, feeling fresh concern blossom in my chest for my flatmate. "I can understand why he wouldn't have felt comfortable to discuss the subject. Especially not with his older brother in the room."
My cheeks flush at our proximity. Somehow, his hand has come to rest across the back of my shoulder blades. Almost like the start of a hug. Without the hugging. It's weird.
I was in an office, talking, speaking with a calm person. No physical pain, no screaming, nothing to generate such anxiety.
If talking to him about how I felt at my lowest helps him at his lowest, I will gladly reveal every secret and every dark moment of my past.
I want to smack him. I want to shake him. I so badly want him to hear me, but he's having none of it.
"Four days later, I had had enough. Even in that short time, I could see that he was rigidly avoiding all forms of nutrition, and though four days without food is a far cry from starvation, I was concerned where his behaviour was leading. I knew he needed help, and so against his pleading, I took him to see the psychiatrist I had first contacted two years previously. I explained the basics of what had occurred to the doctor - and had stressed that he was finding it difficult to cope with the nature of the event and found it highly shameful. Still, I was encouraged to bring him in later that afternoon. Which I did. Surprisingly, since Sherlock refused to let me leave his sight, I had to sit through the entire session - which revolved around discussing the emotional and physical dynamics of adolescence. Or rather, it amounted to a lecture on male adolescent biology, since my brother refused to acknowledge any question that was posed to him."
I run my hands through my hair in exasperation.
Sherlock stops talking as if suddenly jolted into awareness as to what he's admitting.
''John?''
''But you do care! Everything you've done shows how much you care. Look at it from his point of view: he sees you act out, even act aggressively-''
Guarded. Like girders falling away behind those eyes. The emotion has shifted.
''No, I am,'' he breathes, looking at his lap. ''I am.''
''How much his previous hospitalizations have traumatized him?''
Mycroft gives a reserved smile.
''I'll call you later-,'' he begins.
''I think it's possible that you could kiss someone out of affection, and not attraction,'' I say carefully. ''We've discussed that before, actually. And I want to make sure - really, really sure - that if we are even considering going down this road, it's something that we are both ready for and something we both have similar ideas about.''
Eerie, perhaps. But not scary in that segmentation alone.
''Bored. And I'm sick of tedious questions,'' Sherlock says quickly, licking at his lips.
they never understand.
But menacingly. Without compassion. With only steely-eyed intent, threats on their tongue-
I placed it on the kitchenette table, where he had been working on some sort of unfathomable project as if to distract himself from the presence of my ire.
He's still sleeping. John. His regulated breathing is calming and I watch him for a few seconds as his small chest rises up and down, not unlike accordion bellows.
I start with 100 and detract by seven. 100.
He didn't want to see me out of concern for himself. But he was considering doing so for John.
“Oh god. Can you imagine our life with a puppy?”
I want to make note that I will be putting SI tags or abuse-discussion tags in front of specific chapters from now on. Generally, while the descriptions of SI are not detailed - the feelings surrounding SI can be - so I have been encouraged by a reader to put warnings in place.
John suddenly looks so sad that it takes all my willpower to simply observe, and not speak.
My throat is suddenly dry, and I take a sip of the Perrier. It fizzes in my mouth. Tastes vaguely like lemon, which makes me feel a little less woozy.
"Do you mean when it started?"
"Sherlock," he whispers - and I know he means to say more, and merely doesn't know how to proceed. Or rather, he doesn't know how to proceed in such a way as to not give information away. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the more alarming issue. That fact that he feels he needs to hide the reason for his concern.
He nods, sagely. As if agreeing with my assessment.
In light of his words, I feel hesitant to do so.
''Since Toby,'' I ascertain.
He nods gently, finally, nudging the cup yet again. Even more tea spills over the side.
I recover by jolting upright in my chair, momentarily confused. Looking around, I can see a red light flashing on Yuri's answering machine.
''But you do remember why I felt it might be a good idea to test out a few sessions, alone?''
You wouldn't think such a slender man in such a cool house would be so warm to the touch. Even I feel cold. And I'm downright chubby next to Sherlock.
So I broke the kiss, quickly. Pecked against his cheek again.
Too late to add my contributions now, I guess.
She straightens her tan jacket then, and the motion - so proper - irks me. I feel an impulse to punch someone.
The soft, pert sensation of warm skin against warm skin.
And then, unbidden - an image of that night. At my apartment. Me and John, eating our soup, pecking at our salads and our biscuits, and Sherlock - throat convulsing, eyelashes darkened from dampness - struggling to skewer a cherry tomato. A fine ripple of anxiety shredding through his system, and then when he turned and stared at me, I saw a veil of emotional repression settle over his face. I saw the barrier come down and the outwards expression morph into something different, and the acting would have been tremendously convincing if I had missed the way he had seemed moments prior, missed the conversion.
I grab Mycroft's back and press my fingertips into his spine.
My stomach hurts.
Even though it's pretty horrible to contemplate.
The air bites at my throat when I finally get to the NSY parking lot, and I walk quickly past the cars - my heart in my throat.
Even the giraffe on the children's corridor wall mocks me as I walk towards the elevators.
There are no accompanying memories of Afghanistan, however, and I scrunch up in the bed, clenching and unclenching my hands. Trying to force relaxation into my body. I almost laugh at the irony there: force, and relaxation.
I disregard even telling Sherlock that this is actually a good sign. Showing a willingness to be close, rather than distant.
Now the real work has to begin.
Perhaps it's Sherlock's own overwhelm. His own fear. My need to assure him that everything will be okay in the end.
The mug doesn't feel quite as hot any longer against my bare flesh, and I don't like that. I want it to burn.
Yet I want to; I want to bite. I want to taste blood.
What I did was probably a lot more overwhelming, however. It was not a tactic he was familiar with at all.
Sherlock and I have gone over the flat for signs of bugs or wires, or general surveillance. We do so rather routinely, and we haven't found anything in quite a long time.
And I had forgotten that.
Please don't ask. Please don't.
''Sherlock? Why is this so hard for you?,'' he asks quietly. ''Eating?''
''Swollen?,'' I get out, my eyes now finally descending back down to his torso.
------------------------------------
John, I know, is frowning. I don't even need to look at his face to know it.
''I am limited by privacy laws in terms of-''
Sherlock's head now shakes back and forth in rapid succession.
The beverages quickly get deposited to my bedside table as Sherlock cups his head with his hands. His face is lined in pain.
He's (as I suspected) resolute. He's going to stay with the boy. Even Toby's mother had been asked to leave. Toby eventually given a mild sedative. Not enough to totally put him out, but enough to reduce his anxiety. Thank goodness for small mercies.
''You need to look for needle marks. You need to do a more exhaustive blood panel. Don't look for obvious poisons. Look for something less sinister. Something average. Something which, in certain contexts - might even be beneficial.''
''Get up,'' Yuri repeats, and I do.
In the truest sense, I owe my entire psychiatry practice to Patrick’s willingness to confide in me that one night over 27 years ago. He made me realize that my input could have value when it came to encouraging someone else to get the help they were denying they needed. He made me appreciate the power of words – and the power of confrontation when others would rather deny a situation.
Hell, I probably can not even articulate why he feels as he does as well as he could explain it, given that I've never suffered from an eating disorder. Never had the inclination towards that sort of behaviour. Cannot see or appreciate how the withholding of something so vital is so fiercely protected and almost beloved. A beloved, if knowingly twisted, secret. Akin to slowly poisoning yourself, but admiring the bottle of cyanide pills as you do so, while keeping them close to you with a surge of irrational fondness.
'Yes, daddy,' I whisper.
Molly returns with a couple cans of soup.
We go to a Tesco's. A large one. Or maybe they are all this large. I don't know; I never do the shopping. Certainly not the grocery shopping.
I feel a pinprick of coldness from my adrenals at Lestrade's words, then realize I'm nearing Baker Street, and utter a soft ''here's good'' to the cabbie.
“I never said that your responses were abnormal, Sherlock.”
We had been avoiding each other for the better part of a week, and even Sherlock's mood had degraded because of it.
I keep my hand pressed against Sherlock's leg. It's bleeding quite a bit still so I remind myself that glass wounds are like that. They are like head wounds: they bleed profusely.
"He's barely regained consciousness! And now you want to talk to him, without someone he knows even being present? What makes you think he's going to talk to you at all? He's not even talking to me!"
''So - caramel apple?,'' I remind him, and Sherlock looks back up to the food cart.
''He's with me, Miss Jenkins,'' Mycroft says smoothly, although when I turn to look up I can see the corners of pain edging along his eyes and a slight haggard look about his face. His movements lack their typical crispness as he turns and moves towards me.
''I've probably made you uncomfortable. I mean, you're handling it well now, but that will change. People leave over things like this, and-''
And if that's the case, there is likely something much darker and fuller and caustic ravaging Sherlock's mind.
Something safe.
I don't bother responding. The less I give a psychiatrist, the better. Provided I'm not completely mute - I can get through this. I just need to play up the fact that my actions were a departure from normal and in no way representative of how I typically handle stress. Just a stupid, crazily impulsive moment. And anger played a role, too. Perhaps I can use that.
Mycroft stands, and when he does - he seems brittle somehow.
He lets me try to finish my sentence, resolutely hopeful as always.
Sherlock looked at me questioningly.
My friend is gripping the toilet with white knuckled hands. His back is to me, and his knees look like they are going to buckle.
My hair is air drying and already starting to curl when I return to the kitchen; John is serving the tortellini into two chartreuse bowls.
''No. Dn't go!,'' he rasps, looking far more fearful than I would have suspected.
He doesn't get the fact that the thought of eating anything else right now makes me want to scream. Makes me want to gag.
"I know. I experienced it a lot back then," he hesitates for a moment. "Sometimes, I still do." I have to strain to hear the admission.
Don't you want to know what happened? - John
I feel myself perk up, surprised at the revelation.
Has he contacted someone on my behalf?
''Is that what you think I'm doing?,'' he rushes quickly, his eyes dampened down with what I know realize is a dose of hurt.
The little boy in the red cable jumper didn't live in their world anymore, and the light wasn't for him.
"If I tell you something - something very pivotal to explaining my concern for Sherlock - will you promise not to repeat a single word of it to my brother? He can never know that I've mentioned the subject. He would never forgive me if he knew that I was discussing certain...events...with you tonight."
I glance up quickly, and realize he's still studying me. He seems to be debating something. Sherlock's eyes drop to my hand, in his. His eyes come back up to my eyes. His left hand reaches for my cheek, and I take in a breath - surprised.
''What?,'' John guides me, his words an anchor. ''Yes - what?''
Sherlock turned around, looked less apprehensive now. He tapped against my hipbone lightly with his fingertips.
I feel like pacing, so I do.
that we had done anything expected, anything 'adult.'
I nod.
I look down at my notes.
''Are you done now? With your exam?,'' I say next, not liking the feel of her hands against my torso. She's touching my ribs - not excessively, but I don't like that she is touching my bare skin at all.
------------------------------------------
The stethoscope is cold against my chest.
I hear a sigh.
''Why are you so angry?,'' he asks carefully, no doubt surprised at my reaction. ''It helped me realize that I'm not like everyone else.''
Although John is watching you, genius.
I'm not done.
Sherlock's hands are sweating. Cold, clammy palms run their course over my forearms, then away - as if unsure if he should touch me at all.
A brief allusion to a hospital stay, and Sherlock not feeling 'up' to visitors. And I didn't push, I didn't pry, but I still feel like I should reach out in some low key way.
I swallow and try to keep my nerves - and imagination - from getting away from me.
Sherlock's mouth opened and closed.
''Mmmtired,'' he mumbles, ''And I don't want to think about it all. I just want to pause it. Pause life. Just not deal with it any more tonight. I'm sick of thinking about it and talking about it. You must be even more sick of it than I am,'' he whispers. ''I bet you're half sick to death of me by now.''
''Hello, Sherlock,'' he says carefully, and I can hear that sound I've heard a thousand times in my practice. Careful regard. A 'don't spook' them voice. I've heard the tonal qualities come from my very own mouth when in the presence of a person so tightly and overtly anxious that the wrong word could cause them to leave, even when they were very much in need of being seen.
everyone. even those that are by their own nature
I hear Lestrade hesitate.
Because I know how that feels, too.
I help him to his room.
The allowance of anger, the allowance of rage.
''Please don't-,'' I hiss, wanting to wring my hands through my hair and tug. Wanting to pinch my skin until it bruises, maybe even bleeds.
Next I change into silk pajamas. A gift two winters ago from Mycroft. They are grey-blue, with little flying geese all over. A gift skirting on being just odd enough, just different enough for me to truly like it, but also lacking in any real masculine style. I don't know if that has any bearing on the fact that I rarely wear these garments or not.
Sherlock now looks up at me and for a second I see it.
''Thank you. I will take care of this. I promise you.''
Not now.
When he lives his life as Mr. Piss People Off, when he's not living his life as Mr. Impulsivity?
''Sherlock - please don't leave,'' he says a bit more loudly, standing up. I hear him rub his hands on his knees.
''I'm fine, John,'' his voice warbles as he speaks, his face is dusted with pink, and his shoulders are clenched tight and up to his chin in tension.
''What else?,'' Yuri goads, while I stay still. Motionless in the bed. ''I can tell that you are a man of precision - so do us both a favour. Be precise now. When it really counts.''
Maybe in a year or so, I'll look back on this time and laugh.
''Why do you think that means he's unreasonable?''
Whose lying, now?
His hands eventually fall back down to the bedding.
“Because I almost started crying like a mewling infant in your office, Yuri, that’s why,” he grouses.
I say the name until the name becomes meaningless and then I grasp the sink.
''Nothing of any importance,'' he responds in measured tones.
His message stands alone - cold and alone. Three little words at midnight.
I feel like he's really seeing me, and I'm really seeing him.
I don't even know my own title anymore. My reality. My label. My sexuality.
“It is completely wrong. You are not a sociopath,” I repeat with greater insistence now. “You do care about others and as horrible as the last case was for everyone involved, if it doesn’t reveal that much to you – then the tragedy of those deaths is only worsened. You should be doing your work without setbacks caused by these issues. You are made for it.”
''Sherlock?''
''I hope you like cats,'' she grins at me as we climb the stairs to the top floor.
''There are...similarities,'' I say awkwardly.
''Please listen to me and hear me when I say this: Toby needs to feel. He may not like those feelings at first, but it's better he gets them out now. Whatever is inside him is akin to...shards of glass. Clear, hard to detect but sharp, and painful. Right now your son is full of broken glass, and if you don't remove the glass - if you leave him alone to tune everything out and deny what's happened - it'll hurt less right now, that's true. But then the skin will grow back over the top of all that mess. And the glass will still be there. Inside of him. Only one day he'll be grown up, and the glass will still be inside him and it will still hurt for him to do normal things. Because even normal things will scare him. And it will still be painful. Do you understand what I'm telling you?''
I digest his words, and test: ''Has John told you that he considers your eating 'bad'?''
That was me.
He shakes his head.
Clinical Details.
When I've already made myself look so foolish?
''No. No, not drugs. I don't think drugs. I don't think that,'' I breathe, my words almost a mantra.
I knock on his door softly. Try the handle.
"It was a comprehensive book," and now I am feeling keyed up, "That is all. I thought-" and what were you thinking, Watson?, "that if a book designed to help soothe an abuse survivor through a sexual relationship was so positively received by the psychiatric community - that the advice within could be adapted to a platonic relationship. And that it must cover a far wider reach of topics than a book devoted to platonic relationships. I wanted to be informed. I want to help him. That's the end of it!"
Charles looks up and over his shoulder, a faint look of surprise on his tanned features.
I let out a heavy breath.
They can threaten a person's physical existence, and from what I suspect of Sherlock - he's been struggling, acutely, for several months. And in a less acute sense, he's likely been engaged with disordered habits on and off since his childhood.
The action burns me. It suddenly lights the emotional match which incenses me.
"But it wasn't. And part of you is still very angry with him. Even now. Is it because he was unable to stop it from happening?"
“Dogs are an extraordinary amount of work, John. They need full-time attention. It’s like having a child.”
I see his jaw clench, and something steely slide in under his eyes.
Even now?
''No, he can't be,'' I concede, knowing that the man I am speaking to is more than reasonable. I already know where Lestrade is going with this, after all. I know I'll agree with his assessment. ''Did anyone complain about him?''
I shut up. I shut up, and his eyebrows raise almost to his hairline.
''He's going to be okay, John. We'll figure out what's going on with him.''
It’s not something I have ever seen him do before and so I watch the display with a sort of foreboding hesitation.
''I know you don't want to say. But how about this? You tell me - or you write it down, and then I will talk to Inspector Lestrade for you, okay?''
I bet if I grabbed at the pillow and pressed it against my nose, it would be scented like Old Spice and John's soap.
My eyes come to rest on a photo - black and white - off on the book shelves behind Yuri. Even from the distance, I can tell it's of Yuri and another man. They are holding hands and sitting on a bench. They look...intimate.
I look swiftly at her name tag.
John rewards me with a smirk, and then a fuller smile.
''What?,'' I bark. My fear is making me rude.
It won't make the pain he's been carrying around for months, if not years - just depart.
It is serious.
For the truth that is eating him alive. Literally stripping flesh away from bone.
His little shoulders bunch up, but his body seems less stressed as he leans forward to see. I take the motion to mean 'ok.'
Heart-broken.
My muscles feel taut, and I will myself to relax.
“I helped to save one of them,” he murmurs. “I helped to save one of them, at least.”
''Let's just take a bite then, okay? Just for starters?,'' he asks, and his voice wobbles and sounds far off. Then he picks up his own sandwich and does exactly that. He takes a bite. A big bite. Chews. Swallows. Turns to me, and speaks: ''The beginning of something new is always the hardest step. It gets easier after you start. Sometimes, half the battle is just in starting.''
And it is still a plan with a reasonable likelihood of success, given that I doubt John closely monitors any of the foodstuffs on a per evening basis, nor is he given to scouring the kitchen at five am in the morning for evidence that I've eaten.
''I think you know what this is. I think you know that you have an eating disorder. And I think you are scared.''
I let out of gush of air, and straighten my hands, my knuckles. Wish I knew the magic combination of words that would make him well. Make him see that he deserves so much more than this sort of life, and make him feel that truth throughout his whole body. Not just hear my words and understand the meaning, but know my words with his whole being.
No responses from Mycroft. And even worse - nothing from Sherlock. I set the alarm on my phone. Set it for 6 am, retrieve a new glass from over the stove and fill it with a few ounces of brandy. Down it in one go.
He gave up on trying to prevent my entry into his home about nine months ago. A skeleton key of sorts, and additional ones can be cut with relative ease. With the knowledge that I'd usually knock, of course, so my brother determined that the expenditure of changing the locks was just not worth it. I liked knowing I had emergency access when needed.
After that, I am silent, and there is nothing to listen to save for the beeping of a jukebox in the corner, requesting change periodically, and the buzzing hiss of the red signs.
John chews, swallows. Even from a modest distance, I smell maple syrup and tomato sauce.
''Maybe later,'' he says dully, and shuts the door on me before I can say anything else. The rudeness? That's Sherlock. The lack of eye contact, the dead sound in his voice - and his experimentation in his bedroom and not the kitchen (and I never thought I'd be complaining about this, particularity) - all of these things make me feel that something is really, really wrong.
''You don't understand. He's gone through hell, recently. He's not going to cooperate with any of your psychiatrists.''
''Never mind,'' he whispers. ''Forget it.''
''Did your father hit you?,'' I make my inquiry with a voice that aims for neutrality. Even though I even know the answer.
It goes as follows: every morning when I awaken – and every evening before bed – I am to start from the top of my physical being and analyze each sensation for each portion of my being. Does my head hurt? Do I have a stiff neck? Do my eyes itch, or hurt, or feel hot? Do I have a sore throat? And so on.
''Look, John. I have an idea. We can try it. I will call Sherlock, tonight if you'd like. I will try to convince him to come see me tomorrow, but with the condition that you'll be present during the session.''
I start to respond, then realize the words I was going to utter have departed my mind. I finally choose something practical, if not as effective at making my point.
I nod in acceptance of that fact: shame is one of the hardest demons to drive away.
Sherlock huffs.
----------
''Sometimes,'' I agree. ''I try. When I remember to take them with food.''
''I don't like anything inside me,'' he whispers, ''at all.''
I want to vocalize the idea that it's okay if he needs to cry.
What's more: I can't withdraw forcefully, either. I know that much.
My voice warbles even though I was going for strong. Contained. Solid.
''Have you texted Yuri back *yet*?,'' I attempt, in distraction.
------------------
------------------------
I see teenagers running around in tights. Black plastic capes. Devil horns.
''He could come here. Come here, have soup with us. Different place, different atmosphere? Might help.''
The woman backs away, running through the hallway - away from me, away from the door, and away from the knocking of Lestrade. With clumsy movements, I open the lock, shuffling the child to my stronger arm, while Toby lets out an alarmed shriek.
I am very cold, and I realize that now as I stare at the sheets and the padding and the pillows. I slip off my socks - sweat-laden and foul - and ball them up, toss them into a corner of my room. Then I push my bed flush against the wall to create a nook and pull the blinds down to cut out the light, before coiling up under a mound of fleece and cotton.
I had looked up at him, my brain temporarily slowed, the racing thoughts temporarily slowed. I had appreciated that question, liked the very possibility of hope that he was granting me if only because it had been the first time someone had ever asked that of me.
''You have little sisters,'' I repeat, dully.
I don't say anything, and he, too, goes mute.
Donovan lets out a pent up breath at that.
''He had been using, and got booted off a case he had been asked to consult on.''
I stop and look at the word - almost as if I cannot grasp its meaning - before turning down the aisle and scanning the books for titles, for themes.
He had blinked up at me dumbly, as if struck by my fists and not my words.
After a few seconds he pauses. Puts down the crayon.
I nod in his direction.
''Mmm, anhead hurts,'' he mutters offering me back the glass, which I take and deposit on the bed-side table.
Molly bites her lip.
He can hate me for all he cares.
''Unhealthy,'' I start, looking down to the table. I have limited words I can use right now to express my concern. What's more - if I don't make an impact, Sherlock is going to try to run roughshod over me, like he always does.
''I'm not stupid,'' I say firmly, an edge of an old, tampered down sorrow edging out of my heart and into my throat.
''Everything about me is lacking! I try, and I try, and I try to FEEL – to feel, really feel - that you care about me, and all I feel is numb! In my mind, I know you are doing all the right things! I can add up all the kind words – all your efforts - and appreciate that what you are doing constitutes concern. Possibly even love. But I can't *feel* anything like I'm supposed to, and-,'' his voice cracks.
''I'm afraid my selection is poor today. I haven't been to the shops at all this week. I do have an organic Earl Grey though that's really quite good. Or Red Rose.''
''Yes. Fine,'' he replied abruptly, continuing his walk.
John sits up with more attentiveness.
''I have no idea what Mycroft knows. We never talk about it.''
Sherlock's eyes are still closed.
My head whips up in alarm.
I tilt my head, confused by the question.
I am ashamed and I am numb and I am so terribly angry at myself, and angry at John, and angry at Mycroft. I know that I shouldn't be angry with John, nor Mycroft. And maybe, in a way, I'm not. But there is a rage inside of me, and most of the time it's akin to a low kindling fire.
I finally decide to grab my laptop and put it on the kitchen counter. From there, I pull up a website about an 'anti-dumping' diet for individuals healing from gastrectomies and come across some information.
It's not a question. It's a statement of bewildered fact.
When the camera begins to blink in red tandem with the other medical equipment, Donovan turns to me, her mouth pursed.
''I don't need 'help' shaving,'' he says with irritation. ''I have been shaving for 20 years.''
“Sherlock,” John almost growls, his mouth slipping into a small smile – almost, but not quite, amused by my words. “It’s not poetry. I promise.”
''I'm not hurting myself. Certainly not there,'' he says with an embarrassed half-smile, as if the thought is ridiculous. ''Don't be asinine.''
I wait a bit, feeling nerves flutter in my belly.
''In the meantime, I'm going to make dinner soon. But we have to go to the shops, first. We are almost out of food, save for condiments. It would be helpful if you'd come along. I want your input on things you'll actually eat.''
And with those changes, the expectation of more adult activities.
He looks so lost.
John raises the cup to my mouth. ''Just take a sip,'' he repeats. ''Just a sip.''
Sherlock nods, body pulled tightly in.
''You can't do anything, John. Not beyond what you've done already, I suspect. He's going to have to come to that point all on his own.''
''It's okay, we'll just take this at your speed. If you don't want to talk anymore, that's okay too. But can you tell me the person who hurt your head? Who hurt your head on the night you went to the hospital?''
I nod, trying to tell myself that I don't care one way or another what comes out of John's mouth.
''It'll rip them apart. But at least they'll be alive.''
But he's in pain.
I pushed him to talk, and that I fear was the wrong way to go about things.
''What's going on?,'' the voice of Mr. Thiesen cuts through the air, just as I'm about to turn the handle on the lock.
''What? You CARE about me?''
Laying Toby down away from the tracks, the rocks.
My heart is racing. Perhaps as much as it did just the other evening when John had to wake me from a night terror.
Sherlock turns his blue eyes onto my face, studying me closely.
''Something like out-patient, perhaps,'' I say cautiously. ''Nothing you can't do at home. Nothing that Yuri or I couldn't monitor, barring complications.''
But people more receptive to emotions always seem to feel it.
I close my eyes, drop my hand to hold one of his own. He's still leaning into me, radiating exhaustion. My voice is hesitant when I next speak.
When we learned that they had been killed in a different fashion to that which had been initially presumed - and only after had their corpses been mutilated - well, then it became even stranger.
''That little boy didn't have much of a chance then, no. He has a chance now. He has so much more than a chance. He has me, and he has his brother, and he has friends who love him. But he needs you in his corner the very most, alright? So you just can't give up on him too, because that's what almost everyone he ever knew did to him. They didn't fight for him. They didn't help him. I need you to promise me that you will do your best to help him. That's all I need from you, Sherlock. That's it.''
I wince.
I move to him first, give him a gentle hug, try to avoid the fact that his vertebrae press through the Greatcoat. Try to push down the sense of fierce protectiveness, the savage sense of concerning affection mingled with something that I can only compare to a maternal drive.
From times past. So many times, and my answer is rushed. Auto-pilot.
Not feel the keening need to cry.
Lestrade sits down, pushing the drawings off to one side as if to get them out of his sight.
But all the same - I am not looking forward to this visit. I don't want to look into those terribly young eyes and try to convince this child to talk. He obviously doesn't want to do so. I wish I could indulge him this one thing. I know what it is like to want - no, need - just one small aspect of control. To not want someone to take everything away.
I blink in confusion before clarifying.
''If you were anyone else, I probably wouldn't care so much!''
The lemon water tastes sour; the water tastes bitter.
''Not 'about','' Sherlock grouses as the door shuts and I glare at him. ''She's not listening at all, John. These health care 'professionals' are even more useless than Scotland Yarders, and that is a terribly depressing thought.''
''Can I have some plain water instead?,'' I croaked, my chest tight, my ribs pulled too far in discomfort at the request. ''This has sugar in it. It's bad for my pancreas.''
''Abstaining from food isn't a preference, Sherlock. It's the opposite.''
And while it's totally possible that he HAS shouted at Yuri ((very little seems to set him off these days)) this redness looks well suffused.
I stare at the back of his head, sweat slicked and trembling.
It scares me. It scares me more than Afghanistan.
''I liked it when he hugged me. When he touched my hand. I wanted to kiss him, sometimes. On the mouth,'' and his face is suddenly scarlet. ''I wanted to hold him. I wanted him to hold me. I didn't even mind after we were done with sex, because he'd hold me very tightly. I knew he cared about me,'' he staggers with his words then, and then abruptly stops speaking, his cheeks now bright red.
''Myco,'' he said. ''Myco care me?''
''Absinthe,'' he says evenly, not looking surprised in the least. He goes back to watching World's Worst Shark Attacks, but he seems distracted.
"I wasn't a bad kid," he whispers a few moments later. "I know everyone thinks I must have always been like this, but I wasn't bad then."
''I have no doubt that you could have kept your eyes closed, could have touched me how you thought I'd like to have been touched, could have even had sex. That's what concerns me - how readily you'd engage in all of that when you are afraid at all!''
That wouldn't do.
''You know, Sherlock, doctor-patient confidentiality pretty much assures me that even though Yuri Pascal undoubtedly knows who you are, and knows that I know who you are, and that I know he knows-''
Then nod.
"There were noises from him too, like crying. Not crying, of course. But I didn't know about sex then," he admits, as if this alone fills him with a sense of mortification. The redness now almost looks painted on his skin, as the rest of his face is white. Paler than usual.
''What?''
''You've lost about 20 lbs in a few months, Sherlock, and you were already about as low in weight as you could have been, healthfully, before hand. You realize that, don't you?''
Damnit, I haven't talked to him for weeks. Not since John's cryptic e-mail exchange with me over a fortnight ago.
He completes the action yet again, and holds the next breath for slightly longer.
Books.
His shoulders push back and he seems to be lost.
John grins.
I'm not my sister.
"I know that, Sherlock! But it doesn't explain, to me, why-"
I send it after lunch, while I finish drying three loads of laundry. Soon, the flat is scented like Snuggle, and I stop the dryers every ten minutes to take out items and put away garments, fold pillowcases, replace the hand towels in the bathroom.
''Sally,'' Sherlock whispered, ''I need your scarf for his feet. He's too cold.''
I stare at her, debating what to say and what to do to end this conversation.
-------------------------------------------------
''I'm going to wait for Sherlock. You'll call us if there's anything else we can help with?''
I scrapped my nails across my palms, relishing the feeling of the sharp edges. My hands flicking back in tactile defensiveness.
"Why shame?," he says quietly. "Why do they feel shame?"
''No,'' my mouth contorts in anger at the utterance. ''Nothing is okay,'' I get out before I can stop myself.
John smiles broadly, seemingly relieved to just have Sherlock in the office. His smile is eager. He's trying to encourage his friend.
“It’s not completely inaccurate as far-”
"I must have been about three. I couldn't have been much older."
So when I speak next, it's with a brute impulsiveness that is rare for me. Not rare for Sherlock, maybe - but rare for me.
“Then this is for you. We can cover some of this now to get started. But some of this you might want to complete at home when you have more time to consider the questions.”
The walk home could be uncomfortable, but it's not.
''Would you like me to text him?,'' I offer carefully, willing to accept responsibility for the action that seems to be causing him his present anxiety - and also wanting to maintain the illusion that he has some choice in what comes next. When ultimately, from an emergency standpoint, he really doesn't.
-------------------------------------------------
So maybe it is the fact that I am still woozy, still drowsy - that I blurt out:
''Sherlock, you can always help yourself to whatever is in the kitchen. I'd want you to,'' and he bites off a bit more toast, swallows, speaks again. ''In fact, I'd be insanely happy if you'd let yourself have a bit more.''
I squeeze my hands tight, totally thrown. Totally exhausted.
The other part of me is scared.
Sherlock nods, almost hesitantly.
His bites were also minuscule little things. Slowed down movements with the fork placed off to the side of his plate between every nibble.
It looks as if he is measuring his dimensions. And not liking the feeling of doing so.
An errant thought flitters through my brain, and the thought is this:
Until I stopped feeling.
And part of me is screaming internally - SHUT UP, shut up right now! - because this is not how I wanted to approach this subject. Because I wanted to wait a bit, until Sherlock brought it up himself, maybe - and not throw it in his face like he's done something wicked.
'It means I had to came home...'
I wait for a few seconds. Then five. Ten seconds. Realize no additional information is forthcoming.
------------------------------------------
What's more: he's seen more and done more to help Sherlock at the lowest ebbs than anyone else, and he likely is wary of putting off treatment for a man whose just confessed confusion over even wanting to get better.
Mycroft bites his lip. He looks miserable.
I close my eyes and push the images back and away, because it is wrong and foul and dastardly. And it could never be a possibility.
Sherlock's head slanted and he sat down a few feet from me, awkwardly crossing his legs. Fiddled with his cardigan, splayed over his lap. Probably Merino or Angora, or something equally expensive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
His nightmares, and the horror of what I learned about with regard to his childhood.
It makes the assortment easier to look at, really.
Yuri nods, looking pensive. He makes a gesture with his hands.
''So you find such cases more emotionally distressing, is what you really mean.''
''And that's okay,'' I assure him, though I'm certain that this story is far more complicated and far more layered than Sherlock's need to express affection.
"Time for what, exactly?"
"I said speak up" A commanding baritone voice from the cupid lips with calculating eyes, he could feel stark naked from the stare that strips him. John still could not reply because he is stunned at the moment.
"Find that pirate and cut off his head," He said in a calm tone and he ensured that everything is still under his control.
It bobs faster and sucks harder, John do as Sherlock said and let his voice out. He feels the hands caressing his thigh and his navel.
Anyway Enjoy~
"That is too soon, we have still more to do," Sherlock said. Then he put two fingers on John's lip.
Sherlock puts John down and hold is hand, they have left the basket behind the barrel. The good news for Sherlock is that they have lost the gladiators on the market. He takes John inside an Inn and paid for one room to stay the night. John has never seen an exquisite Inn for staying the night.
"Be careful at what you are planning, Sherlock. Remember you are not the only one who have eyes on him. Now, I know the reason why you buy the broken toy. It was going to deliver, to the spider but you buy it first and set another Auction to let it changed the schedules,"
The Ex-Army Doctor is confused when the man speaks a foreign language he didn't recognize or know. He calms his body down and then there is two-man, that came from behind, they carried the cage he was in. It is now placed in a carriage with other captured victim like him, except he is the only one that put in the cage. The others are only been tied up, their eyes are filled with lost hope.
"Yes, like it or not, you need to wear it or else you might be taken by another aristocrat..." Sherlock said while strapping the collar on John's neck and put a little padlock on the back. Sherlock leaned on John and hold his arms in place and whispered in his ear. "... and I dislike, when someone snatches it from what is MINE"
"You need to say it," He said. John looks into the emerald eyes of Sherlock.
"I don't want to take you back" Sherlock whispered to himself. The Toga fits John's body perfectly, showing off its legs and chest made his throats dry a little bit. He found John amusing, cause instead escaping from the start with many chances, but John only stayed.
The First slave and the Third slave has been sold to the buyers in the audience.
When The Second slave is presented on the stage, the reaction of the audience is almost astounded. A short blonde man who is topless, he only has his trousers and his boots left. There is a cloth around his mouth, and prevent him to bite someone, he could only do nothing but groan.
"What a delicate thing" Sherlock whispered and John only stirred a bit but not awakened. Sherlock brushes some of the blonde hair strands to behind its ear. Then he proceeds to trace John's leg using the tips of his fingers, tracing up to the hips.
He feels tired and soon falls asleep on the bed.
"I'm glad that, I'm your first" Sherlock said it casually and John looked at Sherlock with a baffled expression on his face then the choice to ignore it. He realized that Sherlock is speaking with a British accent and it is astounding.
"A mark? You mean the mark symbol on the slave's arms"
An Army doctor that has been captured by the pirates and sold to a foreign land he did not know of. The ship was a wreck because of the battle they have been ordered to capture, the wanted pirates and instead of winning in the end like most of the victorious day.
John only blushed harder when Sherlock mentioned it, he could only wish that this man would not do any irrational decisions and decide to Take him on the bed.
There is a knock on the door and Sherlock gets it, he talks to the maid and get the clothes from her then closes the door. John saw the clothes he is familiar with on Sherlock's hand. Sherlock put the clothes on John's lap and gets a chair to sit beside him.
"Yes, my Lord" He quickly retreats and closes the door.
"Thank you," John said and put down the glass on the bedside table. John take the white sleeve shirt and wears it then grabs the short trousers but he stops and takes a look first. The short is up to his hips just like what little schoolboy would wear and John does not like it.
He followed the voice and saw Sherlock left shoulder leaning against a wall, John did not know he was there before. Does it mean this is his Quarter while himself wearing this inappropriate clothes?
He sees a man sleeping on his bed, quite a surprise from Mycroft to send a man this time instead of a woman. He walks over to his bed and looks who is it so that he could toss him off the room.
Thank you for the kudos and comments. :D
"Do it whatever you want, Sherlock, but a toy like that, I could only sympathize him" The Older replied and it makes Sherlock lets out a low chuckle. Sherlock thinks about how his older brother would even feel any sympathy to others which he could laugh and point at him that it's ridiculous and such a melodramatic sense.
The color pitch Toga is see-through and it is short, it is like wearing a gown but its only above the knee. Its only see-through on the top and not on the lower part. He does not think this is what men would wear, but for a girl, would suit the best. The maidens guided John to a near room, they open the door and then closed it. Leaving him in the room, John looks around while standing in his place. He does not see any person's in here or even feel the presence of it. He found papers scattered around the cemented floor and there is some beakers and other equipment that is for experiments on the wooden table.
"Is that really necessary?"
"How do you know?" John asks with curiosity. Sherlock poured the milk into the tea and stirs it.
Sherlock pulled away to look at John, John's face is flushed and he saw the signs on the body that he enjoys it.
John is flushed up to his neck, he cursed himself for being so easy to flush up. He is a soldier for heaven's sake. John's head is down to prevent letting Sherlock know his face is bright red. He could only think one thing and that a hand on his lap and the hard stare he feels from another man. He grabs his courage to look at Sherlock in the eyes when he saw a hunger and desire only for 3 seconds then it vanishes quickly to a calculating stare.
Sherlock is in his room resuming his experiments then Mycroft came in.
"That is not what normal people say," Sherlock said.
Warnings:
"I know that, but I still need my privacy," John said as he strips his clothes, putting the boots outside, just beside the curtains with their clothes.
"I'll be gentle, I promise it would not hurt" He whispered to reassure John.
"I would not stoop that low to let you take my dignity as a man," John said with firmness in his voice. Masking the tremble of his hands even though it did not escape from Sherlock's eyes.
If there is anything that triggered you then I would suggest to close the window right away.
"Boring" The older gives a deep sigh and before he goes away, he looks at his brother one more time and says.
"They are waiting in the same place" the boy whispered and Sherlock nods.
John is really close to having his release, he shows his neck, for Sherlock to have more access and it did. John grabs Sherlock face to move up and kissed his cupid lips. Sherlock thrust faster and harder to meet his own release. Then the both of them came at the same time.
"There is an Auction near the capital market, buy some slaves to make yourself occupy. I heard there is a foreign man in the word of the market, and it speaks English" Then the older is gone.
"My Lord, the pirate betrays us. He sold your... precious slave...in the Auction. The one you strictly ordered to deliver it here" He drops a sweat from his forehead and getting a grip on himself.
"Lift your chin up" Sherlock commands and John followed.
"Wha- wait - - what?" John asks lazily.
John could not take it anymore, and he will take this chance to get his freedom. He found some clothes on the drawers which were left behind by one of the tenants in this Inn. He dresses quickly and looks in the mirror to see himself, the overall is enough to blend in. The problem now is he cannot find the Key to his collar and give up now since he doesn't have any time to waste. John grabs a scarf and put it around his neck to cover the collar.
John is not aware the hands on his knee and his thigh, that now caressing it in a way that a lover would do. Sherlock seems very pleased that John is distracted by thinking about the choices.
It shows his scar on his left shoulder and fitness of his body. His short height and sweet appearance won't make any people think he is on the war or a battle before. Even though the Ex-Army Doctor stand firm on his both feet with a calm expression, refuse to show any weakness.
"Clearly see that. . . .did I fainted?" John asked while looking around for clothes that he could wear it for the meanwhile. Sherlock glanced at John from his chemicals and deduce him. He can clearly see his back is sore because of the way he tries to regain his posture, he hesitated.
"Five of these, thank you," Sherlock said politely and the vendor packs it carefully on the basket. Then there are kids running towards the corner of the road except one, a boy stops in front of the stalls and he tugs on Sherlock's toga. Sherlock gives the boy 10 drachmas and the boy whispered to him something that John did not hear.
The older one speaks and looked at his younger brother, sitting on a stool in front of the desk. The younger meet his eyes with his brother cold demeanor.
The younger waited 10 seconds then he sprung up when he heard a foreign man has been sold into slavery. It peeked his curiosity and interest at the same time. He hopes it is not some kind of boring slave or a fake one that wants to flaunt with the aristocrats. He wears a proper white silk Toga with a blue one draped over his shoulder.
John is silent for a moment to hear the word from Sherlock and try his best to process it to his brain, John's face is red up to his ears. Blushing really hard and he thinks or maybe he heard it wrong.
"What are these fruit for?" John asked glancing inside the basket.
Sherlock undresses and tossed the cloth aside.
They stare for awhile and do nothing, it seems like hours but its only minutes have passed. John feels the silk sheet on the bed, where he sits. The softness of the texture can tell the quality and the worth that costs a high price.
This does gives you a hint for the next.  ;)
"Two months? How is that possible?"
Sherlock came back from the market streets. Then he walks his way to his Quarter and found two maidens guarding the door. He feels irritated when he sees it because that means his brother make an appointment, again.
There is an unexpected snitch in their crew, and it ends up them to lose the battle and right now, he is in a strong sturdy metal cage which he did not find any comfort inside. It only gives him aching muscles. . .
The slaps of skin to skin are heard with a slick and wet sound of the cock thrusting inside of John arse. Sherlock feels John has tightened more, it means he is close to release. He leaned down to kiss John's neck and then his collarbone.
"Coitus" Sherlock look a John directly into his eyes, telling he is serious about it.
Sherlock proceeds to put one finger first, inside of John's arse and John feels a little weird and this new sensation for him. Sherlock lifts up John's right leg to put on his shoulder. To have a better angle to put in when John is ready.
Looking at John's features, Sherlock found it adorable and he thinks John look more vulnerable at this point. He could take an advantage of him without John knowing. Sherlock made up his mind and never let the "Spider" get to John.
"It's Fine, There is a case I-" The younger cut him off.
He put his arms around Sherlock's neck, he could feel the other hands are spreading his legs after that then it goes to undress the Toga he wears. Sherlock tossed the cloth away from the bed while kissing John.
"No, and I will never be, I only have interest in a woman, not MAN" John replied and Sherlock chuckles, as Sherlock walk closer to the bed, John cannot help himself but move back. Until John hits his back on the headboard of the bed and Sherlock crawls on top of John.
He realized the room is a mess.
John turned his head to see Sherlock then he feels embarrassed and flustered when the erotic scene played in his head, the memories flowed through his mind like a tape of scenery. Reminding him just how he feels so good about their intercourse on this bed. He rearranges the bed sheets on him, and regain his posture.
He is sold as a Dmos what Greeks called as male slave or bondman to the Aristocrat who is willing to buy him, or other purposes, depends on the buyer wants.
After the Auction ends, they drag the Ex-Army Doctor to the preparation room. They showered him and give him a nice white Toga to wear; they prep him like he was an offering or a gift need to wrap in a beautiful wrapper. He feels vulnerable and exposed from the hands that touch all over his body to make him clean.
"I clearly see that. Think this through John, if you take this off then you are giving them a chance to sells you again"
With their loud moans and their final thrust. John feels something squirt inside. Sherlock pulls it out and flopped down beside John then he hugged him from the side. John tried to catch his breathe and relax.
"Oh~ John, your mystery is what I am looking for" Sherlock clapped his hands together with a glint in his eyes.
"I can fix a broken toy," Sherlock said.
"What are you doing?" John protest while being tug to the pool which looks like for a bath. The pool is not deep but for John to sit on it, the water level rise to his collarbone.
Looking up to see Sherlock who leaned down to kiss his lips again. John grabs the smooth curly black hair on the back while they deeply kissed in passion.
"Come in," He said. Then a man pushes the door open then his head bows down that his movements look very anxious to lift his head up. The man on a black cape already knows there is a terrible news, base on his observation of the man and that means one of his plans failed because of the lack of attention that needs.
A man is wearing a black cape on his shoulders with a crown leaves on his head, he wears a white toga with a gray cloak draped on his shoulders. He is writing his signatures on the parchments, which where he is sitting on his chair in front of the table, then there are three knocks coming from the door.
John wakes up and found himself on a bed with a blanket covers him. He thought that he was sold as a Slave is just a bad dream, looks like it's not. He sits on the bed and looks around the room, he saw two doors, one is the exit and the second one is to the balcony.
John nodded as to give his consent, even he hypothetically escape this mansion but he has nowhere to go. Sherlock grabs his chin and looks into his blue eyes. Then he caresses his cheeks, John's heart is still beating faster.
"Thank you, I could teach you our language if you want to and you are still in the land of Greece," Sherlock said and offered him a lesson, and he is very confident that John will make it in 2 months.
"Keep it a secret, do not let the poor ex-army doctor know" Then he closed the door.
"I...I do have past lovers but never ever been with a man, as I said earlier before we have... This," John said and still looking around the room with his eyes. Sherlock hide his smile when he heard it, though he knows there is nothing to be happy about since it is nothing but a sexual intercourse with a man.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, May I present you the Best of Three for this Auction"
"Taking you to a bath." He pushes the red curtains and now they are inside.
Again if someone want to beta read this work. I would love to. <3
"If you need undergarments that badly when we get home, I can get you one," Sherlock said in a low voice, then he releases John's face and goes back to his seat like before. John said "thank you" in a mumbling way.
He did not have any choice, better wear the short trousers than the toga that looks like a dress. John wears it under the covers and he could feel that Sherlock is watching, he ignores him and tries to focus the task at hand.
If one of you readers also want to beta read this, please I will take it.
John closed the door before they are aware that he is on the balcony looking at them. He walks out to the first door and John planned to ask Sherlock about what he is going to DO in this big mansion of a house.
One thing that his mind keeps repeating when the Aristocrat crawl on top of him, and that is "Escape".
John does as Sherlock says and throws the Durian fruit on the gladiator and its strike on the gladiators back. The man groans in pain and surprised by the sudden attack, he could feel the thorns pricked on the back of his skin. John throws the remaining four Durian fruit on the gladiators, one per each of them. Sherlock takes this chance and carries John on his back like a sack of potato and runs to a safe place for both of them. John did not anticipate that and yelps when he is carried by his owner, then he holds on Sherlock's toga and he prays that he would not fall off to the ground.
John's skips a heartbeat and feels his knees weakened when Sherlock said it in a rich deep tone. He could feel the dominance and possession of this man. However, it changes to anger when he realizes the collar means. John pushed him away after Sherlock is done and glares at him.
Sherlock looks up from his experiments and put the tests subject on hold for a moment. He turned around to get a glass of cup and he poured a red tea. When he ordered a maid to buy it from one of the markets near the docks, an hour ago.
"You did, is it too good? I mean you have plenty experience in this field of coitus, but you fainted from your orgasm because the pleasure is too much" Sherlock said and John blushed because he really can admit that it is very great.
Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and unhook the leg of John from his shoulder. Then John took it as a chance to put his both legs around Sherlock's waist, locked on it.
On each stall they looked or passed by, there were aristocrats looking at their side, some are observing and others are staring with curiosity. John avoids having any eye contact with other people and just focus on Sherlock's back while walking.
John could feel himself are starting to loosen up and he felt a sudden pleasure that Sherlock's finger probe it, the sensation goes straight to his cock. Then he released his come with a loud moan.
The cause of his fainting is from the pleasure that John receives might be too much for him and it is his first time with a man. His days in the sea is longer than in the land and that might build up those hormones inside his body.
"A distraction, How accurate for you to... huh... throw 1 kilograms of fruit, ... hah... in one out of ten?" Sherlock's said in between his ragged breaths from running.
"It is a Common courtesy in the slave system"
"Let it all out, I like to hear you moan," He said in a low voice.
"We could fake it, we do not have to do it" John suggested, and Sherlock is aware that John is still having a conflict in choosing on which choice. That he would accept and take it.
"You're a Doctor and that means you could memorize it well, even though I talk fast you still catch every word that I said clearly, I calculate that you could finish it in 2 months"
Sherlock lied and he is never going to let go of John, why would he let go such an interesting man that comes into his life. He will make a plan to make John stays with him.
They take baths in that room, after a short while, John finishes his bath and takes a towel with him to dry off then put on his waist. His face is flushed when he came out and ready to punch someone in the face. On the other hand, Sherlock seems relaxed inside the pool, and have this smug smirk on his face after when he slides his intentional hand on John's bottom which results to receive a slap on the face. It is now showing a reddish handprint on his cheeks.
He stands and walk to the second door and opens it, John did not step outside, he only look at the scenery upon him. A blue clear sky with birds singing in the morning, it gives a nice warm atmosphere. Different from London where it rains often and gloomy; where he lived before he joins in the navy to serve the Queen.
". . . and you are surrounded by your crews" John still sitting on edge of the bed, knuckles turning white from gripping the sheets.
"That would be delightful, but no it is not me, it is my archenemy brought you here. Want to punch someone, punch him in the face. That cloth is what he suggests for,... you and I to have a lovely time,"
John stops his complaints and lets them do their work. When they are finished, they guide him to a big mirror where he can see his full body. He is embarrassed at the clothes since he could feel stark naked in front of people.
"Remember John... Your life here is at risk, you do not want my archenemy to be a witness, on us doing... coitus" Sherlock whispered to John's ear and John tried not to flinch away or show any weakness to the Aristocrat.
The Ex-Army Doctor had to get inside the carriage, he sits beside the buyer on the left. His buyer look him with furrowed brow, seeing his slave hands are tied on the back. Sherlock has a thought that "what a consideration of using a cloth instead of a rope", he deduce on the slave to know his backgrounds and identity before it ends up a slave.
The younger one thought, he could die in the boredom of waiting for the foreign man. He said "dull, boring, tedious, stupid, idiotic, uninteresting and so on" in a low voice just for himself and his brother to hear. That is the comment on every slave that was being presented in the Auction.
"Believe it or not, but you quite make a name for yourself in that Auction. Especially with the aristocrats, some of them are not easy to give up to their interest, So this collar represents a shield to you Or Do you prefer a mark on your skin?"
Before reading this Chapter 3 further, I am warning the readers that this has a Sexual Content involving man x man. Total smut on the way of this part, skip it or scroll down to avoid reading the smut content. :D
"Well, aren't you a pleasant thing. Try to relax on the seat and give up the thought of escaping this carriage. As you already know I am Stronger than you, and it will give you a comfortable position when I release you"
"Yes, Master" He jumps out of the window and landed on the stacks of hay. Then stands up and run to find the slave.
"Wasting my Drachmas on a broken toy is not a good choice, Sherlock" The older spoke on the other carriage where it is just beside the carriage, Sherlock was in waiting. The carriages on the side drapes are open for them to have a conversation through their spoken words.
Some Tags are being added for the future chapters that I am working on.
"You can speak English?!" That is the first question he asks instead of what happened everything to him. Sherlock chuckles on the Ex-Army Doctor reactions.
This brings the other Aristocrats to gasps and stunned to hear such a big amount, that they cannot risk bidding higher than that. Sherlock slips a smirk only for two seconds then he goes back to his nonchalant expression. The Fat-big-belly man snorted and gives up bidding, he sat and began sulking on his seat.
I am on my word here it is.
"We will start in 500 drachmas,. . . ."
She made a frantic gesture that tells him to go back to his room earlier. John followed and walks to his room when he heard she calls someone in a foreign language. His arms have been grabbed and pulled him into the room, he is very surprised to see the maidens holding many kinds of Toga on their hands. He does not know why but they are surely irritated to see him like these.
They have been sat for a while, waiting for the carriage to stop at their destination. None of them spoke or having a conversation until now. John still has many questions in his mind and on how to convince Sherlock to let him go.
"Sebastian, keep an eye for my precious and do not attack, Go"
"Did you call the maidens to bring me here and wear this?" John asks while pointing at the colored pitch toga.
''My chest gets tight. Like I can't breathe. And sometimes it makes it less tight.''
There is no rest time, but perpetual alert and guarded suffering.
''Did I just get some sort of admittance, Sherlock? An acknowledgement that you have a problem?''
We approach the counter, and my eyes survey the overhead menu before I can remind myself that my order should never change. That the ritual could crumble if I do.
He nods in understanding.
These sort of problems don't usually just disappear overnight, do they?
I smiled against his neck, tongued the skin. White, still cool - but not so cold.
In the next second, I am staring at the years-old smiley face on the wall. The neon yellow slanted face.
Donovan shakes her head, as if not wanting my hunches to be anything more. I can't say I blame her.
''Had a nice little chat with Molly, didn't you?''
''Do you think you've linked what they were doing - if it was sexual - with the drugs? Do you sense that's what's causing some of your anxiety now?''
possibly.
Sherlock's blood.
''Now about those ears-,'' I begin, but Molly cuts me off.
“Oh do shut up.”
Which must infuriate someone like him. A person who generally knows what everyone is thinking and feeling before that person, themselves, is aware of those thoughts or feelings.
Toby's elevated breathing is now coming so fast and furious that he's starting to gasp for air.
But I don't just want to say anything.
My head and back feel sweaty, and Sherlock is looking away from me.
But it's not going to work tonight.
''I think so; in part,'' he mumbles. ''I mean, it's complicated, right?'' He stalls, collects his thoughts. ''This isn't new. This...thing.''
''So maybe we have a chance, then.''
I think about the question that isn't really a question at all.
My fingertips come up to press against my skull, my temporal lobe.
Speaking of John - how is it that John Watson - Doctor John Watson - has let my brother do this to himself?
I am freezing.
I like that.
John's eyes are still studying mine, looking at the empty bottle, squinting, trying to piece everything together.
"If he gets upset, I want you to stop," she warbles. ''He has gone through enough.''
''But-,'' and I lick my lips, not knowing if I am overstepping a personal boundary, ''you told me you were in the clinic. At Evelina, when you were 13. You told me you had cut yourself very deeply. Don't you think that maybe - for a long time, perhaps - you've been doing things to yourself to get that anger out? Harming yourself because you can't harm him?''
but that's not the issue.
-----------------------------
''Migraine?''
And suddenly he's gasping for air, and the doctor in me is kicking into high gear because even if I don't understand the why's just yet - I know what is happening. As even though I haven't experienced it myself, I've seen it countless times.
And sometimes, I think it's because in a manner of speaking, I want to disappear. To not give any clues about who I am and what I need - or don't need and don't want - away. Not to anyone. Not even to John.
Sherlock's face is steely.
''Dyslexia. Relatively mild. Relatively bad in early childhood. You didn't learn to read with the others.''
And then his lips start to tremble, his eyes pooling with tears. I disconnect our hands, and move a bit closer. Tower over his hunched form. Whisper to him, but with an intensity that I hope conveys the protectiveness that I feel.
Or perhaps the body attaches meaning and significance to a short-hand version of expression. A look, something of a nanosecond, something that barely seems to have anything of lasting impact - and that encapsulates an entire emotion. And eventually perhaps becomes a mascot for an entire disorder. Those little catches and splinters of life, so watered down, represent years of hell. Years of suffering, of grief, of bitterest solitude, of starvation. Of being alone and engaging in painful things, with few people ever comprehending the depth or seriousness of the situation.
"I want to go to bed, John."
''If you can, I'd like you to consider seeing Yuri. I can even attend for a period of time, if that helps. First few But I won't force you, Sherlock.''
John's POV
My friend cups his face in his hands.
“Yes. You are making excellent progress. The issue here isn’t so much that you are not making the ideal progress we want to see – but it really comes down to what I can do to help you and John formulate a plan that addresses issues such as nausea, gastric pain, gastroparesis symptoms – you name it. A gastrectomy is no small operation, and from your files it appears that the degree of damage to your stomach was severe. From that information alone, I know that you are in a substantial amount of physical pain, even now. Adapting to any diet is a challenge after a surgery. My goal is to help create a lifestyle plan that surrounds dietary practices and changes in exercise that will help you feel physically better. Ideally, in the future, I would also want to see you get you off some of these medications as we go further along.”
''S'rry,'' the boy lisps, and I suddenly am assuaged with guilt.
So I know that this is another topic we are eventually going to need to address. Obviously with Yuri, as I seem to muck everything all to shit when I try to deal with it myself.
Sherlock's eyes are flickering back and forth. He gives me a shaky breath. A shaky smile.
I bit my lip and gazed at my brother with steely intent.
''A ringing endorsement, if I've ever heard one,'' she quips, and then adds, ''Something you don't hate. Anyway, I have four. Two boys, two girls. They're rescues.''
Then I think: fuck it. What do I have to lose, really? Mycroft's respect? What do I care about more, anyway?
''What do you mean? 'Setup'?''
''I understand that you're a liar.''
''allow me to introduce you to victor,'' i would say. ''my partner.''
Nothing in my body really feels indifferent right now.
It hurts.
He continues his brisk stride, never once looking back, and after a few seconds of composing what I want to say, I give up – and pick up my own pace until I match his tempo.
''That experiment was over anyway,'' I say evenly, the tone of my voice neither affectionate nor annoyed. Just me. Just how I always sound, I hope.
'Holmes, Sherlock
I picked up the hydrogen peroxide, and doused the cotton in it.
Sherlock moves his hands, splays them against the cool tile. Presses against the puckered flooring.
''Can you open that? Share those files with John, please?''
How Mycroft sees me?
''When I was 12,'' he states, and I just like that: I feel sucker punched.
Sherlock then flips the photo right side up, eyes studying the haunting image as if it's a complex math equation. One he can't quite understand. After a few seconds, his features settle into something hesitant. Nervous.
''Are you certain, sir?''
''I'm no expert, but if I hazarded a guess, I'd bet on anorexia nervosa. You know that, don't you? You know that if you came into the clinic - if you were a patient, and not my best friend - I'd be trying to get you a psych referral right now. Do you understand that, Sherlock? How sick you've gotten?''
"Thank you, John," Mycroft says, looking away from me, and clearing his throat. "And it was a distressing session, made worse by the fact that the psychiatrist had an almost aggressive manner with Sherlock, and refused to back down on certain points. By the time the session had ended, he looked...dead inside. There was this horrible look of repulsion cast across his face. His mouth was twisted up and he was trembling. If anything - he seemed even worse than he had before he'd seen the doctor. I felt extremely guilty. I still do."
''Because you are worried about how Sherlock would respond to your advances, you mean.''
Why would he say something like that to me right now? When he knows I can't reciprocate?
Sherlock fidgets, and I grasp his hand. Feel the internal coldness bleat out against the heat of my own.
I can feel my eyebrows raise in surprise.
''I do. I do prefer rye. I just... No. Never mind. It was just a thought - it was just a crazy thought. Please forget it.''
"Exactly! You just think it's cathartic! You think I need to talk about it?"
'The person afflicted may believe they have special abilities shared by few others.'
''Then why are you angry at me?''
The explorer laughs softly.
''What does it MATTER if I am trying? Trying doesn't matter! Actions matter, and I can't...act properly. Please, I need to go. I need to get out of here. Please!''
''Is your transport defective too?,'' Sherlock says gently, barely teasing.
''You're late,'' I say flatly, still somewhat upset by the fact that my comments seemed to have upset John.
Don't get me wrong.
Because we don't talk for awhile. He departs upstairs, shaves, changes clothes, and I flitter about the flat in a state of agitation.
''No, Sherlock,'' I murmur, sleep settling in to take residence at the edge of my consciousness. ''That's the epitome of bravery.''
I turn to him, give him a slight nod.
''I can try calling, then. I mean, I can make it seem like I'm trying to set up an appointment for myself. Because this sounds really strange, Sherlock.''
The hand stills, temporarily.
''Sherlock, please put those down, and come over here.''
My heart is wild and sore, and I know I am being out of line. Beyond rude.
After a few minutes, my limbs feel heavy with dread and the music slows to a stop.
''My sister had problems - has problems. When she was a teenager she drank, but she also did drugs. Sometimes she was so high, I don't think she'd know if a bomb had gone off, never mind if her 10 year old brother was in the same room with her while she got it on with her girlfriend.''
''Did the alcoholism factor into your issues with not getting along with Harry?''
''So. Your sister-,'' he begins.
I try to imagine that's what John did, in fact, mean.
I start to type out: I thought you'd know what to do.
''What?''
“Your vision for almost everything around you is eagle-eyed. It is precise, and scholarly in its detail. But not when it comes to yourself. When it comes to how you see yourself there is an absence of clear sight. Your ‘notes’ are barely that. They are a bare, short hand version meant to fulfill an assignment but they do not come from the same place that you access when you work on a case. When you look at me, and make a declaration – those determinations come from a different place, too. One that doesn’t cause you pain. And because it doesn’t cause you pain you can engage with the objective of your focus. Be it me, or Molly, or a suspect on a case. Because you are actively engaged in the material. But you are not actively engaged in yourself-”
Sherlock huffed and scooted until his head was resting on John’s shoulder, their sides pressed together, “That’s really quite insulting. Honestly what would I do without my blogger?”
It always comes down to this, John supposes: the head or the heart.
Two things could happen if John looked at Sherlock, and he meant really looked at him. Eye contact, in John’s mind, could either make or break them. One, Sherlock would look at him like the weak man John feared he was. Sherlock would look at him like he was a civilian and not the war doctor he thought he should be. He would see him as fragile and unkempt; a ticking time bomb of psychological disorder. He’d see the worst reflection of himself in Sherlock’s eyes and he wasn’t ready for that.
“And you meant it,” Sherlock presses, his experiment long forgotten. He was facing John again, full undivided attention on him and John feels extremely uncomfortable.
“I love you, John”
Its two days after the coffee shop when they have a case that just infuriates Sherlock. He’s on edge the entire time and John can’t seem to figure out why. Even when it’s over and solved Sherlock is still walking around the flat in one big fit.
(See the end of the chapter for
That's all folks. Thanks for reading.
“Yes, Sherlock.”
“What?”
Sherlock can picture all of these things perfectly. John dressed to the nines, as most army men are when they plan to end their lives. Military corners on the bed, not a single crease in sight. And of course, John would put a silencer on the end of his gun, he’s a proper man and doesn’t want to bother anyone. Doesn’t want to cause an inconvenience.
“Homeless network.”
John froze. No, he hadn’t, not really anyway. He thought all of Sherlocks clinginess came from guilt at Mycroft informing him of what he had been up to. He never once thought that while Sherlock was out God knows where dismantling Moriatys’ network he was missing John.
Hope you enjoyed, Reviews mean a lot, thanks all who did. More to come!
Which leads to now, both of them sated and sweaty underneath a sheet. Sherlock on his side pressed up against John and John on his back with his eyes closed.
And John thinks, by her hesitation, that she knows what he’s come here to say. How could she not? John’s been away for so long, leaving her without an even so much as a text message. He knew, she knew, now all he had to do was get the words out.
“You can’t leave again,” John thinks this might unfair to ask of him, what with their hectic life, but he can’t help it. Down the road, when they can stand to be away from each other for more than a couple hours, he needs to know that Sherlock won’t go.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, so John keeps on babbling, “I—me. Mary and I—”
Sherlock’s mouth moves from a frown into a hard, thin line. “I think you’re taking undue risks. Injuring yourself uncaringly. Last week you nearly got shot,” his voice shoots out low and sharp, like he’s accusing John of something.
I do not own Sherlock or anything associated with it besides the ideas in this fic.
“Good,” she says smiling. This time her lips don’t fall as his phone vibrates once, twice, three more times in his pocket.
He runs his hands over his face and a tired, weary voice says, “Sherlock.”
A beat. And John opens his mouth only to close it.
Sherlock eases the bruising grip on his face, “Do you see?”
“I want to hear it from you.”
“You were going to propose to me, John! Oh, yes, I knew. Are you still going to marry me John?”
*********************
Eventually, he’d stop going to see Mrs. Hudson in the morning and stopped seeing Lestrade in the evenings. He cut his therapy sessions down to two and then one, claiming he was starting to feel better but really, he wasn’t feeling at all. In the end, he just stopped going completely. He tells Sherlock how he didn’t realize how tangled up his life had been in Sherlock’s. How embedded Sherlock was in his being. He remembers his therapist referring to this a sort of symbolic loss and he remembers telling her it wasn’t just symbolic if he was really gone.
They can’t really look each other in the eye. Or at least John couldn’t look at Sherlock. It’s been a week since he’s been back -miraculously- from the dead. John had been spitting mad when Sherlock popped round in that restaurant like he’d never been gone. But, he had also been so intensely and blindingly relieved; Sherlock Holmes had raised himself from the dead and maybe everything was going to be alright.
And John’s reservations about Sherlock being ‘boyfriend material’ also turned out to be baseless. Although Sherlock wasn’t great at expressing his more intimate emotions about John, he was becoming exceedingly good at showing them. Comforting John with his physical presence rather than with words, showing John when he wanted something romantic instead of asking him. Just little things that were so entirely Sherlock Holmes.
“No,” John says breathlessly. Because honestly with Sherlock this close to his face he’s having trouble thinking clearly. And actually, he’d be a little pissed at being blatantly manipulated like this if he didn’t have the sneaking suspicion that Sherlock needed this confirmation more than he let on.
John wonders if that’s worse. Sherlock looking at him like nothing’s changed when
They don’t say they that love each other, because word seems too small, too mundane for how they feel.  What did you call someone who was your entire life? John didn’t think there was a word for it, neither did Sherlock.
His socked feet are jostling back and forth in pent up anxiety, or manic intensity - I'm not certain which.
''At the core of the unattached is a deep-seated rage.''
''Is something going on?''
The little boy takes one of the sheets and pulls it close, staring at it. He suddenly reaches for the box of crayons and pulls out a crimson stick, putting the green crayon back in the box. The fact that he has switched to a red crayon is not lost on me. Toby then quickly colours in the left side of the head, pushing heavily onto the paper. He finally scratches out the eyes of the boy, pressing holes completely through the paper with the force of his strokes.
Sherlock is listening intently.
''Do you love me?,'' he queries, his whole body trembling.
''Do you want to destroy something?,'' my words rush and tangle. ''Break something? A physical object? Would that help, maybe?''
''About you being in the room. With those things happening.''
I can tell based on the tension in his hands, his neck and his face - that he's actually been worried about me.
''Any pain?,'' I ask seriously now. He's been staggeringly quiet these days.
''Thanks for getting back to me. I'll keep this quick,'' he mentions by way of greeting.
It's the only out I'm going to give anyone tonight, and if he doesn't take it - if all of this becomes a horribly big deal - I'm going to lash into Mycroft with such animosity that he'll think twice about encroaching into my territory again.
''Are we friends?,'' he queried, and the expression on his face was unlike anything I had seen on him before. Unlike anything I had seen on anyone before.
Ultimately, I want him to choose health for his own sake - and not for my own peace or mind. In fact, I am convinced that he will not achieve lasting healing until he comes to realize that he's worth saving. Not for his mind, and certainly not for the preservation of his transport alone.
Oh for heaven's sake. I don't believe this!
''Don't,'' I warn, pulling back into my mind.
''It couldn't be anything too recent. He was looked over briefly for signs of assault when they admitted him. Mind you it was cursory - not internal -''
''Harry.''
Then shakes his head.
"I was a bastard child."
Keep it together, Holmes.
Damn me, too. Because I've been asking for it, haven't I? I have. I know I have. I haven't exactly been coping very well lately. I know that.
''It was implied. It was very obviously implied, Yuri.''
He doesn't look me in the eye, just sucks in a deep breath and then walks through the door. It clicks with a metallic 'shlock,' and a few seconds later I see him as he joins Toby near the hospital bed. At long last, I see Sherlock drag a plastic chair to the edge of the bed, and I see mouthed words. Barely moving lips.
''What? Why?!''
----------------------------------
Sherlock doesn't respond. He merely turns slightly away from me, his shoulders drawn high. He's holding the Stradivarius in his hands very stiffly. Tracing the lines of the instrument softly, as if it were a pet. A living creature.
I squint at him, running his words through my head.
''This is probably a bad choice; a bad allotment of my daily calories,'' he says in a mock blase tone. Like he doesn't really care about eating junk, when we both know he obviously does. When we both know the degree to which he does, indeed, care has consumed him.
My tooth came out in my hand, and my hand filled with blood. And I screamed.
John takes a step closer.
What's more - for some reason the enormity of that declaration has stayed towards the back of my mind up until now. In a category of 'things-I-have-yet-to-deal-with.' Because I know I need to deal with them - bring them up - but I also know that they'd be the most complicated of subjects to bring up with Sherlock. Not just dealing with what someone else did to him as a little child. But also what he did to himself of a violent nature when he was a child. And what he's doing to himself currently. Not eating enough, voiding what he eats, using sharp instruments to damage his skin. It's almost like a free-for-all for him, a means of seeing how many ways he can hurt himself. Or at least that's what it feels like to me.
I stop eating cereal abruptly, rapidly needing salt, so I take the near empty salad bowl and pour almost the entire content of the Ragu sauce into the bowl. I open up 6 slices of plastic wrapped cheese and break the pieces up. Throw them into the bowl. Top with salt, pepper, hot sauce. Top with parmesan. Top with soggy bits of buttered garlic bread.
“You have trained your sight on everyone and everything else that happens outside of yourself. You have made that impeccable, breathtaking skill into more than just a science. You have made it an art form. And because you have that skill – an exquisite skill – because of that, I have some hope here – that one day you will feel better. I can hope that with your mind and your ability to see deeper than anyone I have ever met – you can one day apply that same ability to your own life. But you cannot see yourself clearly right now. Right now your perception is warped, and it’s wrong. On this issue, it’s dead wrong.”
Maybe I even have stomach cancer.
------------------------------------
''That's rich given what's just happened,'' he grouses a second or two later.
"What is it?," I repeat, more caustically than before.
It's not really a decision at all.
''It needs to stay refrigerated,'' I add, at his querying glance.
He starts to jog away.
The man faltered, fumbled brokenly for his violin case, and I tied Bisquick up to the side of the fence, now safely away from the two of us.
But I was never any of those things.
Sherlock's feet are tapping restlessly against the parquet. I can't help but wonder if he's aware of this fact.
He pushes his plate back angrily, and I rise to meet him - action for action.

Her eyes are still smiling, even when her mouth relaxes. She really has no idea the tension I've caused.
because he's healthy and i am not.
''You don't - you aren't,'' he trails off. ''You're not gay, for starters.''
I give him a smile. Soft.
''This your first time?,'' I said, presuming our further activities. Not giving Sherlock the head-space to psych himself out.
He sashayed back a few moments later, Vernet cupped in one hand and a rather large burgundy tome in the other.
I suddenly feel very, very dizzy.
The night he deliberately overdosed on morphine.
To be sure, I know I am inordinately fond of John. Almost to an absurd degree. To a degree that mucks up my ability to concentrate. But is it love? I don't know.
''Maybe we can't,'' he breaths back to me and pulling away suddenly - prematurely ending the hug. ''Maybe it's who I am now.''
N.B: In some ways, this chapter represents the greatest strides in psychological growth for Sherlock; although, in other ways, psychological growth can also hurt more than psychological stagnancy – at least initially.
''Mmm,'' he breaths, looking suddenly so much like a child-John that I almost pull away, feeling alarmed and disconnected. Feeling almost dissociative.
My throat aches with the knowledge that he needs to go through something like this. Again. Because it must feel the same. Sure, he'll know it's a doctor touching him. Not a person intent on using his body. But will that difference and that knowledge be enough to take away his fear?
''What do you propose I do? How do you think I address issues with him - issues it sounds like you've discussed with him, undoubtedly one of his best friends - and get him to see that he needs help?''
''What? What's wrong with that statement?''
''You know what I mean,'' and he frowned now, eyes blinking unsteadily. ''Sex. Not for me,'' he breathed oddly. Too quickly.
''It looks like you are bringing someone home?,'' he inquires, a small nervous smile playing upon his face. Trying to be polite. Then I see him sort of glance back to the road.
It was: 'I'd take that over what happened to me. I'd take every beating that he had surely gone through if I could never have gone through...that.'
“Yes. That’s my diagnosis,” I reply with uncharacteristic acceptance. “I just don’t like it much,” I mumble, not really considering my words until they are out of my mouth.
I feel the stirrings of grief trundle through my chest. My lungs feel full and heavy and wasted.
"It would take very little to scare him, John. Very little indeed. You must realize that."
''Sherlock, you're not!''
John touches my hand, and his voice is soft. Like sable. Like a blanket. It's soft and warm and gentle and quiet. And I appreciate all of those things right now.
''Oh, hey Greg. Yeah-,'' and his voice rumbles kindly.
''God,'' I sit up in the loveseat, implore him to meet my eyes one more time. ''I'm not angry with you, Sherlock.''
That message right there?
''Not really,'' he admits, his voice matching mine. ''But I'm not contagious, I don't think.''
"You see, it was when Sherlock was 13 that I realized that it was unlikely he would ever be able to have a normal - or shall I say adult - relationship with another person. Certainly not a sexual one."
John looks like he wants to interject something and I rotate in my chair, my senses on high alert.
I realize, abruptly - almost revelatory - that he's nervous.
I glance around.
------------------------------------------
''Yes, that would be fine,'' Sherlock says gruffly.
His eyes are scanning my own. Moving back and forth rapidly.
I wait a few seconds to determine if he’s going to add anything more.
I expel my breath and turn away, wanting the conversation to end now and as we walk to the kitchen, John suddenly turns to me. Studious and intent. More so than our previous interaction.
2 missed calls.
I need to get home.  - JW
Bao Binh smiles back at me.
''Turns out he sometimes had - has - excessive reactions to noise. Still does, but he covers for it.''
