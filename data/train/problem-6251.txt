“Crossbones doesn’t deserve anyone.” Steve let his head fall back against the headrest. He still felt pleasantly hazy from the rope, but that was tinged with the memory of sad eyes watching him every time he looked up.
The man just finished with the last rope, as Tony started across the room, adding its careful coils to the pile beside him and then slumped. Tony hesitated, waiting to see if maybe this was the end of the scene, if his partner or anyone else was finally going to go over to him. But after a minute or two of the man staring vacantly into a crowd who was pointedly ignoring him, Tony decided he wasn’t going to get a better chance and made his approach.
But before Steve could get too judgy, maybe the ignoring was part of the scene, the top stood up, kicked a small block of wood across the stage until it was under the bottom’s straining feet. It wasn’t big, and only a couple inches high, but it gave the man in rope the ability to take some of his own weight. Instantly the man’s head drooped in relief, then tilted back again as the muscles of his leg stood out in sharp definition. Steve suspected that knot near his throat meant that he could easily choke himself if he didn’t keep his posture.
Steve followed his line of sight and nodded approvingly. “Looks like you might be going to cause trouble.”
He was gorgeous. His long body hanging from a single suspension line, gleaming skin only interrupted by a brief pair of skintight black shorts, his straining toes just an inch from the relief of the ground. There were other ropes on his body, a hip harness, a thigh wrap, and cuffs dangling off his ankles, but they were just remnants of what had been done, nothing that would help him in what he was currently doing. The only thing left to hold his weight was the chest harness folding his arms behind his back. Two bands of rope crossed his chest and arms, a web over top of that made a little cross of a knot at the base of his throat, and a wrap of rope pulled tight around his lower ribs.
“Sure, let me know when you’re ready, or if you’d rather tie tonight,” Steve agreed easily, heading towards the bar to pick up some soft drinks. There was a second floor balcony that overlooked most of the downstairs play space and that looked like the best place to linger while they got a feel for the space. Steve tried to look innocent as he waved Tony up the stairs ahead of him, but accepted the eye-roll and casual smack he got on the shoulder as a reasonable cost for the view.
Once they got up a level, settled against the railing, Steve realized the larger group of people had a focus. There was a show on and he was beautiful.
Tony glanced around, noticing the top at the bar, chatting and laughing with a crowd and that felt even worse. It wasn’t really his place to step in, but on the other hand, they were here to meet people. He nudged Steve, “Hey Cap, I’m gonna go make friends.”
“I just wanted to say, that was amazing. It’s nice to see more rope bottoms built like us,” Tony started. There weren’t that many guys into the bottoming side of rope.
Tony blinked in surprise, looking down into that blue gaze again, that shy, wavering smile. Tony couldn’t help but grin back, even as he replied, “I’m working,”
“—am happy doing whatever with me, I know. I remember,” Tony maturely resisted the urge to roll his eyes again. “You really need to stop putting me in charge of all the decision making, it’s a lot of pressure.”
“I got some time off work,” Steve whispered once Tony ran out of breath and pulled back. “I have some things I need to work on, but I can do it here. I’m all yours for the week.” Tony let out a sob he hasn’t realized was bubbling up in his chest. Steve lowered him carefully to the ground so he could free one hand and wipe the tears off of Tony’s cheeks. “Shh, Sweetheart,” He leaned forward to press his lips gently over Tony’s face, on his cheeks, his forehead, and finally his lips again.
They clunked onto the platform and Tony held onto the railing while his body got used to being on ground that didn’t want to kill you. “Why did humans turn this into a sport? There are a million movies telling you how dangerous walking onto a frozen body of water is,”
places with you from a little sweet-talk.” He surged up press his lips against Steve’s smiling ones, clawing a bit at the end of his sweater until it was pulled up just enough for Tony to feel the firm muscle of Steve’s abs—
“You will be, Kid, come on, stay here,” Bucky interjected. “You’ll go home and be with him, and it’ll be okay because who the fuck cares. You just gotta stay awake until that happens, yeah? You stay awake, and then you’ll be able to go home and he’ll love you and you’ll love him and…” The words choked in Bucky’s throat, unable to come out anymore. And what? What happens then? “Steve? Stevie?” The sounds of screaming and gunshots and explosions became deafening in the absence of Steve’s reply.
Tony laughed again, pushing off the wall of the skating rink so he could glide a few feet in front of Steve before he caught up. Tony knew he couldn’t get far without Steve to hold onto, but he liked the little thrill he got when he felt Steve hurry after him and put a hand on the small of his back to steady him.
“I called Pops,” Peter admitted, his voice picking up speed as he went on, “I knew you might hate that, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it and then you stopped answering. I had the worst – “
“But it was hers,” Tony argued softly. He gently rubbed the back of his knuckles over Steve’s cheeks, taking care of the lone tear he let slip out, and Steve closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. Steve’s mom died not long after they’d graduated high school, and it had torn Steve apart. It had always just been Steve and Sarah for as long as Tony had known them both, and Sarah had been Steve’s world for a long time. Even though Tony had never seen Steve so completely devastated, Steve had somehow turned to Tony for comfort, drawing him ever closer when Tony had been prepared to step away. That was the time Tony knew he and Steve were something serious, so Tony held on and refused to let go ever since.
“Haha,” Steve rolled his eyes. “You were right about your cook, of course I had to have two slices,”
Tony was hiding his smile to himself as he took the garland from Steve’s hand and passed it around the other side of the tree back to Steve. He could only catch glimpses of Steve’s face through the branches of the tree, but he could definitely hear his cheerful voice singing along with “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” by Andy Williams, because Steve is a sucker for the classics.
“Thinking about something?” The fretting hunk in question broke Tony out of his thoughts. He lifted his eyes from where they had been staring at his skates glide in and out smoothly (with Steve’s help) to meet Steve’s. The blue looked even brighter next to his pink tinged skin. “You’re never usually this quiet. Did you hit your head on fall number 17?”
“Don’t let his face fool you, he’s a huge softy.” Steve told him with an affectionate smile. “But yeah. Shipped out a few months ago after his birthday. We send letters, sometimes, but uh,” Steve blushed again. “Won’t really be able to now when I ship. He sends some to his family, got a bunch of sisters, but I don’t…” He trailed off again, scuffing his show lightly against the pier. “Don’t got a whole lot of people waiting on me, or anyone waiting, really.”
“You’re changing the subject,” Tony countered, and he could hear Steve’s low chuckle at the other end of the phone. “Why can’t you sleep, Darling?”
He had biology with him fifth period, in the same lab group and everything. Steve was useless in that class, and so was Thor, and most of the time Sam too. But Tony didn’t seem to mind. He could probably do this backwards in his sleep, didn’t bother him that no one else seemed to know a lick of what the teacher was talking about.
Steve sighed at the other end of the line. “I just -- I couldn’t sleep is all. I thought you might still be up.”
“Steve,” Tony whined, stretching out the ‘e’ sound in his boyfriends name and flopping down onto the table sadly.
“Listen, I’m not interested, okay? I’m sorry if you were misunderstanding something, but I’m really, really not interested.” Tony interrupted quickly, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
“Still here,” Steve responded, fainter this time. “Yeah, science stuff. Could probably talk circles ‘round you’n me any day,”
“Ready?” Steve asked as he finished tucking his hat and gloves neatly into his coat pockets and folded the fabric over his arm.
“You suck,” he muttered, but there was about as much heat to it as there was in Tony’s toes, which wasn’t a lot, and he squeezed himself under Steve’s arm before taking one of the drinks for himself.
“Okay, let me go take off my pants,” Tony replied, rushing back to the bedroom to throw his pants haphazardly at his dresser before returning to the living room where Steve was putting another log on the slowly dying fire. “You know, it’s technically not Christmas anymore, we don’t really have to keep up the Christmas aesthetic we had going on,”
“Of course I’m still up, it’s me,” Tony scoffed. “I like to maintain a healthy amount of sleep deprivation at all times.”
“I know you’re still in school, probably got loads of friends there. Bet you got a sweetheart, too, but, uh, if it wouldn’t be too much of a bother--” Steve started haltingly.
Steve’s cheeks colored. “The one you told ma you would throw out for her?” Then realization dawned on his face. “It’s ma’s old coffee table?”
“What in the hell makes you think that was someone I would bring into Peter’s life?” Tony bit out in disbelief.
“I’ll say,” Tony agreed. “Blonde hair, blue eyes, you even still smell a bit like apple pie. Be honest with me, it’s just your natural scent, isn’t it?”
“They announced his name,” Tony told her abruptly. “Over the intercom, at school the other day. In the morning, they sometimes announce the names…”
Four am also meant two other things. One, that he had been awake for bordering on 24 hours, and when Steve woke up he’d frown in that worried way of his when he realized Tony hadn’t slept all night, and offer to call an Uber to the airport instead, but Tony would be damned before he gave up any last second of alone time with Steve.
“What the hell are you doing here,” Tony murmured, but didn’t let Steve answer as he rapidly pulled back and pressed his lips to his. He felt Steve smile against his face, making the kiss a little loose and messy, but it was the best thing Tony had felt in the months since he last saw Steve.
“Stop that,” he scolded. Tony giggled in response, though he’d never admit to the sound outside of this moment. Something about the cold and the brightness of the classic Christmas music over the speakers filled him with a different kind of energy than he was used to. He knew manic energy — that was three day work binges in his lab with barely a pause to down a smoothie or protein bar; and he knew nervous energy — that was standing in front of a doctoral committee with something he’d been working on for years, knowing the panel of rich, white bastards couldn’t wait to see a 22 year old fail; he even knew the healthy energy you get after a full nights rest — bounding into Pepper’s office with a new project for her. This was a different energy, bubbling brightly inside of him, filling him with a boyish excitement he couldn’t even remember having in his childhood. This was an unfiltered happiness — and he suspected it had a big something to do with the hunky blonde fretting over his balance issues and lack of coordination on ice.
The guy introduced himself as Jeremy when he checked them in and insisted on helping them to their room. He had a cheerful demeanor and, even in the short five minutes Tony and Peter spent with him, showed a general disregard for personal space. It was a hand on Tony’s arm when he offered to walk them up, guiding him gently through a door he was holding open with a hand on Tony’s back, and even a hug goodbye for both Tony and Peter. At the time, it had been something to laugh about. Peter teased Tony that he’d had an admirer, and that had been that. Until the next week.
“Because I missed you.” Steve reminded him. “And I decided to bother you in the middle of the night about it.”
“Flattery won’t get you anywhere, Stark,” Steve teased, putting his hands on Tony’s hips so he could pull him up against his chest, letting his forehead fall forward onto Tony’s.
“I’m good. Sorry I’m calling a little late, robotics ran over and then I had this assignment to finish before seven. Everything okay?” Peter asked, the stupidly perceptive kid.
Steve ducked down, hiding what Tony could only guess was an epic blush, just by seeing the start of it, “Right, of course.”
“Peter, Honey, take a deep breath for me, okay? I’m not upset with you at all. Well, maybe a little bit for worrying yourself so much over me, but not for anything else, Kiddo, alright? You did the right thing. Pops is actually taking me home right now.”
All that to say, the idea that had struck Tony a couple of weeks ago was still lying disassembled on the spare bed. Mostly it was pictures, dozens of them that Tony had gotten printed and spread across the comforter so he could choose his favorites and try to fit them into an okay looking collage on the still uncut piece of wood lying next to them. The ingredients for his home-made mod-podge were on the night stand.
Steve laughs, forming his grip around Tony’s waist. He loves holding Tony like this, so intimate and gentle, possessive in the best ways. “I’ll take bruised toes over the alternative,” he chuckles into sudden somberness. “We really thought you had been dusted, Tony.”
there, Steve is where Tony needed him when Howard wasn’t, but Steve can’t do that. Even if he travels to 2023 somehow, his Tony will always be dead and will never know or be able to make amends with Steve in the end.
3-year-old Tony though loves the drawing and says Steve has a really active imagination if he thinks the kid will look that good in the future. Steve laughs and ruffles Tony’s hair with a smile before taking him out for ice cream and a stroll at the local park.
“Uncle Steve!” calls Tony from down the way and Steve leaves Maria with a gentle squeeze before making his way to the kid. “Aunt Peggy was telling me about how there’s something called quantum physics.”
Tony doesn’t unwrap his arms though and Steve feels like he wouldn’t be able let him go anyway. He lets himself take in what almost happened, how close he was to something that shouldn’t happen as equally as it
“Something only Tony Stark can do for the great Captain America,” the brunette cheers ironically. Steve grits his teeth but doesn’t take the bait. He knows Tony is still so wounded from losing Peter Parker, from almost being killed by Thanos and almost dying in space. Steve can take anger from the man. It’s been proven that such emotion is deserved. “This has got to be something special. What’s got you needing me now, Cap?”
Tony seems baffled by that reply. He blinks and then starts moving again. “Okay,” is his only response, a soft acceptance that warms Steve more than anything in the past few years.
Steve can’t help himself when he laughs. “Hey, I’m 55, kiddo. What does that make me if 30 is ancient?”
Tony shakes his head with a pout. “Captain America is dead even though Dad keeps going on about him. Plus, Captain America is super strong and has big muscles and a good heart and pure intentions. I’m three and three-quarters and I have nothing super about me. I cry when I’m not supposed to. That’s not a superhero.”
“Steve, darling, come meet Anthony,” his wife calls, breaking him through the haze of fear that threatened to consume his thoughts like the lighthouse lamp on a stormy day at sea. He walks to her slowly but surely, reminding himself repeatedly that this is just a baby. It’s a baby, so what it happens to be the baby version of a man who changed his life forever with just a simple glance and oh god, maybe Peggy was right but not about being Tony’s boyfriend. Just that it could have been a desire of Steve’s if he even bothered to consider it.
Outside the sun is shining as Steve said it would be but the soothing sounds of nature at her peak are still missing from the atmosphere. Sometimes it’s more difficult than it should be to step outside and see the damage Thanos had done to the world, to see so much desolate land and know that they had failed to save half of all existence. It’s on this land, this half torn land that struggles to survive to the next day, where Tony and Steve set their feet and put hands to shoulders, and arms around waists.
Right now, Steve is 52, doesn’t look a day over 40, and sits in the hospital waiting room on May 29th, in 1970 when Anthony Edward Stark is born. See, in this reality, Steve ends up being close friends with Howard Stark. Howard and Peggy had founded SHIELD together and Steve, an agent himself as he couldn’t
“I’m trying my best here.” He grumbles back as he fixes his positioning. “Plus dancing with me means you have to put in more effort.”
“You’re gonna grow up and be so amazing, Tony,” he whispers through the beeps of machines tied to Maria and the incubator Tony has been in and out of over the past few hours. Steve doesn’t want to let him go. “Thank you for giving me this chance to show you.”
During the tour, Tony holds onto Steve’s hand, his tiny fingers grasping two of Steve’s own as he drags him through the halls. Steve is barely paying attention to the actual building, too busy watching Tony’s face as he describes rooms and hallways with varying emotions. He’s still a kid so he can’t hide the disgust or subtle fear in his voice when he talks about Howard’s labs in the basement. Steve feels like having a very long chat with Howard the next time they greet each other. In the meantime, he follows Tony along and simply finds joy in watching the moments when Tony’s eyes do lightup and his brain moves faster than his tongue and he stumbles over his words as he tries to tell Steve everything he can about the art room his mother has.
“Yeah,” is all Steve can muster. Tony pulls him back into a stepwise motion. He stumbles over a clump of dirt. “Do you think—,”
Maria passes her son along and those big brown eyes open at the sudden movement and consequential heat transfer. Steve is mesmerized again, taking a careful finger to Tony’s nose. The baby sucks on his pacifier as he watches Steve, staring into the blonde’s soul like he’s ready to rip his heart out his chest and make Steve confess all his feelings.
. I didn’t know he could be that upset at our son, our little boy who only wants to satiate his growing curiosity.”
Steve is staring into his cup of murky hospital coffee with the cold hard bench under him numbing his ass. Peggy rests half asleep on his shoulder and for a moment Steve wishes he could have brought a Starkphone along to the past or something to distract himself as he waits. There’s been moments where he hoped for something in 2023 that doesn’t exist now, craves food that hasn’t been invented yet or music that hasn’t been created yet. He has that list Natasha made him still, the things he should experience in the 21st century. He’s going through some of them as they appear for the first time in this timeline and he’s thankful for her sacrifice to allow him to relieve a different reality for himself.
“You know,” the mustached man begins as he gives Steve a glance, “you’re the only one who calls Anthony ‘Tony’. Did he ask for you to call him that?”
Tony gives him a hard look before rolling his eyes. He takes off his glasses and stuffs them into a pocket on his robe. “Of course you would ask me to dance when you can’t dance yourself.” Tony moves his fingers against Steve’s shoulder and looks past it back toward the building. Steve keeps staring down at Tony, eyes scanning his face and taking in every second of this moment. Tony’s body is thin but warm against him. There’s closeness in their posture despite the distance between their bodies. “You’re staring, Steve.”
“I won’t tell anyone if it’s true. I’ve only just had suspicions as you don’t age as fast as me and Howard do. You don’t get sick like Peggy and I do.”
“Your enthusiasm is refreshing, Steven. I appreciate it.” Maria then motions to her baby. “Do you want to hold him?”
“You lead,” Tony demands as he adjusts his grip on Steve’s shoulders. “I don’t have the energy to try to drag you about.”
Steve kisses the top of Tony’s head. “I’m sorry we can’t visit as often. I wish we still lived together in the same city.”
“Ew,” cries the child with a pout, “40 is so old, that’s like ancient! I probably look all wrinkly and gross like I’m gonna die in the next 3 minutes.”
It takes a few hours, hours spent with Tony babbling on and on about the languages he’s learning and the new motherboard he’s trying to build to replace the first one he made months back, but Steve manages to get a good portrait of the Tony he remembers when the Avengers fought Loki. The Tony he saw and disliked from early on, too bitter about everything yet nothing at all. The Tony with brown hair and only a few facial scars from all his battles. The Tony with youth in his eyes and snark on his tongue to protect people from his fragile heart. The Tony who refurbished his personal Stark Tower into the Avengers home base despite originally not wanting to be a part of the team. Steve’s heart aches and he wishes he could go in time and stop Tony from using the gauntlet but he can’t now and can’t ever.
God, Howard, what the hell? “You can never make me angry and you certainly didn’t just now.” He pulls Tony away so he can wipe off the tears as he stares into those watery brown eyes. “I’m so old, Tony, so old and ancient. More than you could ever know. Life is too long to be angry at something as menial as jokes about age, little man.”
“Oh, no,” Steve blurts out, red splashing against his cheeks as he pulls away from the accusation. “No, no; we weren’t like that. I just—,”
Peggy shakes her head. “He said Stebe, the little bugger. Stebe.” The woman rubs a thumb over Tony’s face and grins. “He loves you, too, darling. Misses you more than he can express when we’re gone. You’re making him a happier person for sure.”
On Tony’s birthday, Howard comes back early that morning and sets up the living room with Jarvis. The two are chatting between themselves, Howard wrapping presents and Jarvis arranging them on the center table. Steve watches them from the doorway, a large scale painting he’s been working on in hand, but he knows Howard knows he’s there. He shimmies up to the two men in silence and sits down on the couch, placing the canvas at his side in the resultative silence. Howard speaks up first.
Tony makes grabby hands and Steve places the child on his lap to run his fingers over Tony’s face, which makes the baby giggle happily. Tony reaches for Steve’s fingers and pulls one into his mouth to suck. Steve lets him and sighs lovingly to himself. “This baby isn’t even mine but I love him like he’s my own blood.”
Steve has never cried so much until baby Tony entered his life. He doesn’t cry now, but it’s a close enough thing. If he closes his eyes, he can still remember his Tony’s face, his emotional eyes and long eyelashes, the wrinkles at his eyes and mouth when he smiled, the bitter anger in his voice when he created Ultron with Bruce to save the world, the humor in his comments when he was checking out Steve’s ass when they went back to 2012 and lost the Tesseract. It’s been three decades but Steve can remember it all as if it was yesterday. For everyone in 2023, it has really only been a few seconds and for a moment, Steve’s tempted to go back and tell everyone how amazing the past was with Tony at his side and tell Tony how cute of a kid he is and how much Steve loves him.
“Only the best for the best,” he replies and Tony’s grip tightens as if letting go might mean Steve leaves forever. “Do you want to show me around the place? I wouldn’t mind getting a tour around the Stark mansion from the best tour guide I know.”
Her eyes glaze over and she turns to Steve with a cock of her head. “You’re not from here, are you? As in, this world maybe. This time in space. I hear your whispers, the talk about things that don’t exist here. The Google, the Amazon, the iPhone. Certain songs that you hum under your breath that I know are not songs anyone has written yet.”
Tony hums happily as if that little notion satisfies him enough to close his eyes and usher in the night. “Steve,” he yawns, nuzzling up against the other’s hand, “you’re my bestest friend. I love you.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile a bit, and discreetly slipped two fingers into his pocket to brush against the paper sitting there with Tony’s address written on it, and his phone number, “Just in case,” Tony had said.
They both watched as the van disappeared around a corner, and Tony’s knees nearly gave out in relief. He turned back slowly to where Steve was standing and saw that he was already looking at Tony. His scowl was gone, and his posture had relaxed some, but Tony could still see the tension on his face. It was probably reflected on his own as well.
“Excuse me?” Tony managed. “I don’t know what you thought you saw or heard, but you’re nuts if you think I was flirting with you in any way. Especially in front of my son.”
“Like anything you set your mind to doesn’t turn out perfect,” Steve said flatly, then turned back to the bed. “Where’d you get the wood from?”
Jeremy looked startled, standing up off the van and looking over. The car that had pulled up honked, loud and long. The back door of the van closed again so it was just Jeremy standing out there. Tony could only watch with relief and bewilderment as his mystery savior stepped out of the car and walked around to where Jeremy was standing.
“You’re the one who pushed me,” Steve replied calmly, like the little shit he was, brushing the rest of the snow off his fingers so that it landed on the ice below them.
“Bucky and Natasha? Yeah, I guess, on every other day ending in ‘Q’, but the rest of the time they were yours.” Tony replied sarcastically.
But anyway...Yeah, Tony was smart. He was confident too, which was a dangerous combination. He had brown eyes that danced in the sunlight and a mischievous smile that always seemed to be saying, “Fuck with me, I dare you,” but in the most charming way possible.
“Probably a few students somewhere around. Why? You want to make sure my friends’ parents are home before I stay the night?” He teased lightly.
So, the first time Tony saw him, really saw him, was in his army uniform at a cafe. It was Tony’s summer job, his source of spending money since his father refused to indulge him in anything that could remotely be classified as ‘fun’.
For now though, Steve has Tony again and can tell him how much he loves the kid all day every day without a single worry. He smiles warmly at Tony and then looks up at the Iron Man painting with knowing eyes. He can’t wait to see who Tony will end up being in this reality because no matter what, Tony Stark and Iron Man is inevitable. Steve’s just a lucky guy who gets to love him along the way.
here and you’re friends with Howard for a reason now. Maybe it’s to make amends with his son. You knew his son in your reality, right?”
Another five months pass before Steve and Peggy greet the Starks again. SHIELD is working on more field agent projects and Steve finds himself out the country again with Peggy this time. They actually meet the Starks while in Italy: Peggy and Steve are between missions while the Starks are here for an energy conference. Maria asks Steve and Peggy if they would care to babysit and Peggy says yes before Steve can even open his mouth to reply. Jarvis, which makes Steve sad because the AI named after the butler died in his old reality, leaves with the Stark parents so it’s only Peggy and Steve in the hotel for the day.
“Long,” he sighs and rubs the back of his neck, “but it succeeded if you can’t tell from me being here.”
It’s while Steve’s distracted by the intoxicating taste of the man in his arms that he realizes Tony’s pressing against his watch. “Tony,” he whispers against soft lips, clinging onto the name like a wave of promises he’s about to break again. “Tony, please.”
Love is a curious thing and it pops up in different ways for different people across different stages in life. Meeting Tony in his 40’s leads Steve to a romance that never comes to full fruition while meeting Tony at birth leads to a familial love that he can only hope carries Tony through the rough patches in his life. In some other alternate reality, maybe Steve goes back in time but doesn’t marry Peggy and instead immediately finds Bucky and saves him from HYDRA’s hands. Maybe he goes back in time to the early 2000’s and attends a party where he finds Tony and kisses him into a corner until he wakes up in a bed sweaty and sticky with Tony draped over him kissing his shoulders. There are all these
Steve is shaking and struggling to steady himself as his glaze over whole he reorients himself. The taste of Tony still fills his mouth and he stupidly wishes it will never leave. Bucky, Sam, and Bruce crowd the blonde on the platform and ask questions back and forth about how the trip to return the stones went. The man knows he should answer and reassure his friends but he can’t get Tony’s last words out of his head.
Steve twists his arms to grab Tony’s face, brushing soft thumbs over Tony’s still too hollow cheeks as his gaze climbs up Tony’s face until blue eyes meet brown. Tony’s eyes dart down to Steve’s lips and Steve doesn’t even know who leans in first but it doesn’t really matter in the end.
Cell phones aren’t really a ubiquitous thing yet, but the Starks have their ways and “Uncle” Steve gets in on it, too. He’s on the phone with Tony, who is still mostly babbling but does have some coherent English words and an odd sense of language to the nonsensical babbling, for the first time. Steve is practically grinning at Tony’s excited talking and Peggy teases him about his overexcitement. A few weeks later, Steve gets a package in the mail and it’s photos of Tony talking on the phone to Steve with this silly little sparkle in his eyes that warms Steve’s heart like nothing else. He puts up the picture of Tony asleep at the receiver on his wall and always finds his eyes darting to that photo in particular after a long trying day dealing with red tape and bureaucracy.
Steve’s struck with the notion that time is frighteningly limited and he has only minutes left. He should make the most of it.
Steve nods and pulls his hands away with a gasp, trying a little harder now to get his emotions together and not lose his cool again. He wipes at his face and takes a few deep breaths to gather his composure. Peggy keeps talking as her hand rubs at his shoulder. “You loved him, didn’t you? It’s okay if you did; I loved another man in that life, too.”
It takes a few stumbles before they start dancing in tandem with each other. Steve keeps watching their feet, eyeing when Tony steps back so he can step forward, following how the grass beneath their feet changes as they dance across the courtyard. Tony starts humming something under his breath and Steve looks up to watch him. His eyes are closed, his face turned up to the sun as a gentle calmness coats his face. Tony looks content here holding Steve, pulling him closer whether he consciously realizes it or not.
scenarios that filter through Steve’s brain at Tony’s “I love you” but it only hurts him more when he realizes that in his original reality, he never got to hear those words from Tony or say them back.
“I’m sorry,” Steve murmurs against those spit-slicked lips, catching another breath stealing kiss. “I’m sorry.”
“You’ve made it quite clear in the past that you very much wouldn’t,” he spits back as he turns back to stare at the ceiling. “Go find someone else to dance with.”
Howard waves a passing hand and cuts of Steve before he can rip the man a new one. “I know I haven’t been here much and when I am, I’m super focused on my personal studies. I know this and I’m trying to be better for Anthony but the world out there
Steve clenches his fist and the sharp action accidentally wakes up Peggy. He sends her a silent apology when she gives him a concerned glance but she doesn’t fall back asleep as she grabs his coffee drenched hand. “It’s going to be okay,” she says softly, warm and sweet and everything Steve could have asked for. “The baby and Maria will be fine.”
But, as he pets four-year-old Tony’s hair as the kid falls into a deep slumber, Steve remembers in the chaos of Loki’s failed invasion when the Tesseract was stolen by said invader and the possibility of the time heist plan going south became more real, that Steve and Tony did say “I love you” even though it was never those three words explicitly. He realizes that the words never had to be said because in the very end, their actions circumvented any words that could be said.
“Eventually the novelty will wear out, buddy, so it’s a good thing birthdays are only once a year.” He turns his head to press a kiss to Tony’s temple. “Happy birthday, Tony.”
“Sorry for what? A lost love? I lost you too and was able to move on. You’ve come back to give us both the future we couldn’t have. What is there to apologize about?” her voice soothes the unknown pains coursing through Steve’s veins. “You have a second chance with him as you do with me; don’t waste it.”
Maria cocks her head. “You’ve always been saying these strangely coded phrases since Howard and I met you all those years ago. Usually, I’m a little suspicious but today,” she stares at her baby boy in Steve’s arms, “no, not today but every day since he’s been born, I find that I want to hear you tell me that Anthony will grow up and be as great as his father. When it comes from you, I feel more comforted about—,” her eyes dart toward the house and Steve stiffens. The woman shakes her head as if clearing away thoughts and then smiles warmly. “It doesn’t matter. My point is that you give me hope and comfort about the future of my son.”
, is all Steve thinks as he brushes his fingers over the baby’s face. He still can’t grasp the fact that this child is Tony Stark. He wishes he could tell the entire universe to love Tony tenfold because without him they wouldn’t exist.
. “I just like nicknames. I used to call one of my old friends Bucky even though his name was James.”
Tony shrugs. “I’m still mad at you.” Steve gives him a look. “I haven’t hated you for years. If I did, we wouldn’t be here.”
Tony nods and then turns to give Steve a big hug. “Thank you; I love it!” He copies the hand repulsor pose in the painting and Steve’s heart gives out in one big fell swoop. He makes gun sound effects with his mouth and sprints around the couches and chairs shooting at nothing. Peggy squeezes Steve’s hand and the blonde merely watches the child enjoy his imaginary armor.
“Ah,” panics Steve as he notices Tony’s asleep in her arms. He’s sucking on a pacifier as he rests, little fingers curled against his chest. His brown curls are carefully parted on his head and for a moment, Steve has to remember this baby doesn’t hate him yet. Won’t hate him ever if he can do anything about it. “If you don’t mind, I wouldn’t mind holding him.”
Instead of detailing his own past future, Steve passes Tony back to Maria. “He’s a Stark so he’s gonna be amazing.”
The point is that Howard and Steve are close so he invites Steve to wait with him at the hospital while Maria goes into labor. Howard is stressed as hell, fidgeting in his seat and constantly questioning if he’s gonna be a good father. Steve wants to say no because he knows Tony Stark and how damaged that man is thanks to his father but that was in Steve’s old reality where he was also a shitty friend in turn so he doesn’t have the right to berate Howard before he can even begin to be a shitty father. Plus, Steve is here now to help keep Howard on the right track when it comes to being a dad. He’s here to make not only to live the reality he never got when he crashed into the ice but to make Tony Stark’s reality good too. Give Tony a reality he also never got to live and will never even live with his daughter as he sacrificed his life to keep the universe safe.
Howard doesn’t reply but he softens under Steve’s touch and the conversation melts into weapons development and marketing. He knows Stark Industries focuses on tech development with a sector dedicated to weapon development, but it’s still startling to hear the conversation. He’s a man of war himself but the profiteering side of the battle isn’t one he’s ever really given himself time to process. Now that he can, he can understand how easy it was for Tony to be so flippant about existence. How he could turn a blind eye when the life molded around him forced his future to be the way it was.
Panic stills Steve’s legs and he turns to Peggy with a mixture of shock and fright. The reality of the situation burns through his mind and he can’t move, not with his own mind at least. He’s moving, following Peggy and Howard down the halls to the hospital room, but his mind is still left behind on that metal bench that numbed his ass. Steve Rogers is about to meet a baby Tony Stark. This is real. This is happening. The man who saves the universe 52 years later, who doesn’t even know all of the amazing things he’s going to do in his adulthood, will be right before Steve in the most innocent manner he could ever be in.
“I consider Tony family. I think Maria would agree.” Steve places a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “I just want you to be more conscious of how your actions rub off on Tony. He’s smart as hell but still a young impressionable kid who just wants to make his dad happy.”
“It’s a hero,” Steve pats Tony’s head. “A hero who loved the world three thousand when the world loved him not even one percent of that.”
She laughs and that’s enough of a comfort for Steve to bite his tongue and go another day without blabbing about a world he can’t return to. Maria invites him inside for iced tea and biscuits and they sit at the kitchen table with Tony sleeping again in Maria’s arms, chatting on about the past three months while Steve was away. Steve’s heart hurts with the little things Maria shares with him about her son. Tony’s a crier; he’s a hungry baby, too, and he loves attention from Howard whenever the man isn’t too busy working on his new energy source technology.
and the two of them spend the entire movie chatting about how unrealistic the plot of the movie is, at least for the time period it’s set in. Steve watches them with a wide grin and is once again satisfied about staying in the past and living this life he never had.
Steve looks over at Tony, who is trying to convey something about electrons to Peggy, before giving Maria a gentle caring look. “I’m sorry Howard’s been on edge recently. I’m sure he doesn’t really mean it, he’s just busy.”
help the world be a better place if he left his old reality for this one, grew closer to the man in turn. The three would spend hours at the Stark residence talking over treaties and conversing in legalese, developing the strong pillars of an organization that Steve knows will be overrun by undercover HYDRA agents. He still doesn’t know if he should do something about it as HYDRA is the only reason why Bucky still lives but is also the reason why Howard and Maria Stark don’t. Steve can’t go back in time here, time travel hasn’t been invented yet because the inventor, Tony Stark, has only been in the world for at most two minutes.
Peggy laughs. “I’m just excited to watch Tony grow up because if he’s this awesome to put you in tears when you hold him, he’s someone very special and I can’t wait to love him, too.”
“He went by many things but honestly, it’s up to you to figure that out. This is just a fictional painting after all.” Steve doesn’t miss Maria’s knowing look and he smiles to himself but hides it behind Tony’s hair. Technically, Iron Man
Tony blinks and leans back in his bed as he turns to look up at the ceiling. “Steve, if you want dance lessons Natasha is taking up ballet again.”
“Why me?” He turns back to Steve with a darkness in his eyes, something protecting whatever emotions are passing by in his head. “Why do you want me?”
The blonde gathers his nerves and walks into the room with a smile and shy hands stuffed in his pockets. Maria is holding a swathed bundle of baby and Steve can’t see the baby’s face but he can already feel his heart clenching in his chest at the idea that the little bundle of joy that lights up Maria’s face like nothing Steve’s seen before, is Tony Stark. Two versions of Tony bounce around in Steve’s head as he makes his way to Peggy’s side: the snarky arrogant Iron Man who Steve never treated properly, and the newborn innocent baby Steve doesn’t deserve to know. He wants to fall to his knees and cry, pray maybe for this second chance at being better for Tony than he ever was while they were Avengers. He wishes Tony was still alive so he can rush back to 2023 and tell Tony that Steve
“Only when we’re fighting.” Tony steps forward. Steve forgets to step back. The older man winces but doesn’t comment. “This here? Us dancing? No fighting here. Just friendly tangled legs and a couple bruised toes.”
Cake and cookies come next but Tony gets overly excited and sugar high off the treats, which makes for a fun game of tag in the backyard. Steve isn’t as young and spry as he used to be and can barely keep up with Tony before the kid is bowling him over and giggling about being able to shove Steve off his feet. Steve can’t be mad about it when Tony looks so happy and carefree. He selfishly hopes that when he can save Bucky, he saves Howard and Maria and Tony never has to be captured and tortured into creating Iron Man.
Steve isn’t sure if Tony is asking about the dancing or asking about something much deeper. He wonders if he was obvious since Tony came back, since living in a dark reality for three weeks where he thought he had lost Tony for good without ever making amends. The blonde drops his arms to his side and looks down at where Tony’s arm lies on the bed. “The question is why
Maria takes a photo and Steve frames it on his desk next to a photo of him and Peggy at their wedding.
Steve can’t help the smile that forms on his lips. Tony gives him a look but his eyes are a little lighter at seeing Steve’s excitement. “We’ll dance in the courtyard,” starts Steve with a small hum. “The sun is out today and it’s stuffy staying indoors all the time anyway. Plus, you can consider this part of your physical therapy.”
In the meantime, Steve draws for Maria since she’s too sick to go around taking pictures or drawing things herself. Steve paints from his memories. He paints the purple and blue glow of space from when he traveled through the galaxy for the first time over thirty years ago. He paints the Washington Monument in DC as he and Sam jogged through the district together racing each other through the green lit park. He paints the cold desolate snow above the bunker he fought Tony in all those years ago. Maria loves all the paintings, trailing her fingers across the paintbrush strokes as if she can feel the emotion put into every detail.
“Steven! You’re back earlier than I expected.” She smiles even more and waves for him to come over. He walks onto the porch like a drone, blue eyes trained on the baby in her arms. She notices and giggles to herself, which snaps the agent out of his revere. “How was the mission?”
Then it hits him, how Tony took the brunt of the full force of six Infinity Stones to save the universe and all that’s left of Tony’s legacy is Stark Industries, Pepper, and their kid Morgan Stark. His eyes start to burn and he coughs into his fist to hide the rapid turn of emotions.
Steve crosses his arms against his chest and watches Tony eye him up and down in a very seemingly not defensive manner. It’s not the first time Tony’s checked Steve out and definitely won’t be the last but the attention makes Steve pause. He quickly finds his words but can only imagine the blush on his cheeks caused by saying them. “Tony, I want to take you on a dance.”
“Move out here! Come live with us; there’s a bunch of empty rooms no one uses anyway.” Tony places his head on Steve’s shoulder. “I feel lonely here.”
When Tony turns two, Howard isn’t at the celebration. He’s across the country working at some conference, getting investors to fund his flying car plans and his research on the Tesseract for alternative energy sources. Tony is making complete sentences now and can read basically whatever the hell Steve puts in front of him. Steve gifts him Adam Smith’s
“That’s great,” Howard tapes another present and then leans back on the couch. “Anthony talks a lot about you. He likes you.”
Steve clears his throat and walks to an easel. “I’ll draw one picture for you and then we’ll go out and get some lunch since it’s a nice day outside.” He pauses. “Is it? I better Google it, I guess.”
a fictional character in this reality because Iron Man doesn’t exist yet. “I made it because I want to show you another glance at the world. That’s what art is for, right?”
Tony kicks his shin. “Don’t think about the past right now. Did my speech the other month go in one ear and out the other?” he huffs against Steve’s chest. “I’m here now.”
“Yeah, kiddo, I’m Steve.” he pulls Tony’s hands from his face and curls him up in his arms with Peggy. Tony yawns and is already half asleep when Peggy pulls the baby closer.
“Mommy’s sick and Dad’s gone and Jarvis said I can’t go in the lab but I want to,” starts Tony between little sobs and Steve picks him up and hoists the toddler on his hip. “And you’re not here and Aunt Peggy hasn’t come over in months and I
There’s a moment of silence that lasts too long for it to be a natural silence so Steve turns from the easel to spot Tony half a second from crying. Steve drops the pencil and falls to his knees to cup the kid’s face, worry filling his eyes as he watches fat crocodile tears trail their way down chubby cheeks. Tony’s face scrunches up to cry and Steve pulls him into his chest to hold him as the child’s emotions boil over. “Tony,” murmurs Steve into disheveled brown locks as he rubs the young boy’s back, “You know I really care about you, right? It’s not luck because I’m always gonna care for you.”
Tony’s hand rubs his shoulder in something of a comforting gesture. Steve fidgets under it and Tony pulls his hand away to grab his arm instead. The blonde looks down at Tony and raises an eyebrow. Tony rolls his eyes and places his hand back as they continue their twirl about the grounds. Steve slowly falls back into their dancing rhythm and focuses on the way Tony fits in his arms. He’s half in a daze when he steps on Tony’s foot and the man cries out with a hiss.
“The universe.” Tony points at a few of the stars in the painting’s background. “What is the hero’s name?”
“I’m not from another world, just from a different reality.” He rubs at the back of his neck and sighs. “I’m from the future but I got a chance to come back to the past and I didn’t want to waste it.”
Steve cradles the baby closer and leans down to kiss the child’s head. “I eventually learned why he disliked me so much but I can only hope me being here for him now can help him be a happier person.”
Tony mumbles something under his breath before he starts pulling the needles out his arm. “One dance, Rogers, and then I have to put these damned IVs back in my bloody arm.”
“We gotta stop dancing,” he whispers hoarsely, “I can’t do this. I can’t keep teasing you like this, teasing
“Coulda fooled me,” snorts Tony. Steve’s grip on his waist tightens just enough. “Calm down, beefcake, I’m pulling at your leg.”
“Oh please,” Tony dodges another Steve misstep. “The fantasy died pretty fast and then I was mostly just angry about you. Angry you took up so much of my dad’s and Peggy’s time even after death. Seeing you didn’t help.”
The very first step is an entire mess. Steve steps back when Tony does the same and they end up leaning forward into each other with their arms extended. Tony looks down and then back up at Steve with a smirk. “You need to step forward since you’re leading. Always step back when I step forward. I’ll step forward when you step back.”
“Steve,” Tony whispers back and it’s so broke and lonely and hurt, it almost brings tears to Steve’s eyes.
Over the next year and a half, Steve visits the Starks as much as he can but with the young family moving to Malibu and Steve and Peggy still situated in Brooklyn, he can’t visit as much as he wants to. Tony calls at least once a month in the first year or so to give updates on life, but then Maria gets sick, so sick she can’t get up out of bed for weeks, so going into the next year, the calls turn to weekly events. Howard hires maids and butlers to take care of Tony and essentially bars the kid from being able to see his mom while she’s ill. Tony cries over the phone and the sound of the gentle sobs and his shaky vulnerable voice makes Steve want to drop all responsibilities and take care of the young boy until Maria feels better.
“You know,” Tony slips in once he’s done humming his song, “Peggy was my godmother. She would tell me stories a lot while I was growing up. One was always about a dance.”
Steve slumps to his knees, staring at quivering hands that held the man he loved just seconds ago. He allows previously held back tears to stream down his pale cheeks. “He knew,” is all he says aloud.
Tony pulls him down by the collar of his shirt, gasping into Steve’s mouth as he eager takes what Steve provides. His tongue is wet and heavy in Steve’s mouth and the blonde sucks as he squeezes his eyes shut to enjoy the moment. Steve tastes the heady warmth breath of this man he wants so bad, this man that’s built the world Steve was reborn into when SHIELD found him all those years ago. He presses kiss after kiss into Tony’s mouth, takes in every breath and gasp, plays the push and pull game with every passing second. His fingers leave Tony’s face and tangle in his graying locks. Tony presses deeper, following Steve’s hands until his left hand grabs at Steve’s right wrist.
“Thought you were out the compound for the week,” starts the recovering man with a subtle scowl. Steve can hear the defensiveness and he wants to reach a hand to stroke Tony’s hair and calm him down.
you back then,” he begins with a furrowed brow, “I was frustrated and confused. I wasn’t sure if I could trust you or not. I learned to hate you later.”
Steve stands by the door and waves Peggy in so he can have a moment to himself to catch his breath before seeing Tony. He did not expect to be so paralyzed and panicked about the situation but it’s still so mind boggling to be seeing his fellow Avenger like this. It’s like he’s intruding in on a life he shouldn’t touch but like Peggy said, since he remet her he’s not supposed to be here so why does this matter? Perhaps this is just to make amends with Tony.
That wall ends up being his Tony wall over the years. At Tony’s first birthday, he gifts him a circuit board and Tony spends half the party either chewing on it or taking it apart to put back together and Maria catches a photo of Steve watching Tony with this little lost look of love and awe. During the summer, the Starks go to Malibu and when Steve ends up in Los Angeles for a meeting with some SHIELD agents, he visits the young family and ends up spending half his day at the beach making sand castles with Tony. Maria snaps a photo of Tony throwing sand in Steve’s face with a wide toothy smile and bright golden brown eyes.
“I wish I could believe you,” whispers the woman as she turns to look up at Steve with the most haunted and frightened look on her face. “I wish I could believe things will be okay but Anthony is only 2 and he’s so smart and ready to see the world but Howard is going to scare him out of loving life.”
Tony tightens his grip of Steve’s hand. “I’m fine. Let’s get moving so I can rehabilitate my dumb legs.”
“Sure you do,” she plops down on the bed with him and places her head on his shoulder. “You loved him for a reason. Tell me about it.”
Tony gives Steve a watery smile and then squirms his way out of the blonde’s arms. “Aren’t you gonna draw me during the Cretaceous period?”
They kiss for what seems like hours under the cool breeze soon bested by the warming sun. Tony’s jaw is getting sore. His kisses are sloppier and lethargic, merely wet pressure against Steve’s mouth. Steve takes it anyway, takes every ounce until he can feel himself starting to slip away. It’s a slow thing this time because he doesn’t want to go. He should have taken the stupid watch off but he knows this is not a good moment to stay. Tony and Pepper are at odds right now but he needs to marry Pepper and have Morgan and live that life he deserves here, too. He always deserves a family of his own.
Tony recognized this feeling, knew that if Steve left now, then that was it. He’d be out of his life forever. It was the same feeling he had the night Steve walked out with a duffle bag over his shoulder and his ring somewhere on the living room floor, but Tony hadn’t said anything then.
“I think he loved me, too,” Steve continued, the red still coming out ferociously, “He said so. He’s so smart. He couldn’t be wrong about that, could he? He loved me, and I...I said I’d...I’d be there…”
Steve leaned back in his chair with a huff. “So, you can’t communicate, and I’m too stubborn. We might as well be in our twenties again.”
Steve saved him from trying to come up with an ending to the sentence by pulling him in for a hard kiss. Tony felt Steve’s arms wrap firmly around his waist, pulling him up almost in a bend as Steve leaned down to deepen it. He pulled away slowly, letting it linger on for a few seconds before whispering, “It looks like it’s going to be beautiful. I can’t wait to take it home.”
“Did you want to play tonight or do you just want to get out of here?” Steve’s voice drew his attention away, and Tony hesitated. He really wasn’t comfortable here, but he was incredibly curious about the Asset. He didn’t want to leave him.
Tony saw the man’s eyes widen slightly, and he grinned, ready to continue his favourite rant but then the other guy shut down again.
Crouching, the rigger untied the rope from one foot and started brushing his hair back. The strain between the bottom’s eyes lessened at the soft touch, before returning with a vengeance as the rigger closed his fist, roughly tying the rope into his hair. Using that handle, he caught up the ankle again, and started slowly pulling the man’s foot towards his head. The bottom struggled to keep his balance as the curve being forced into his back changed his center of gravity. Steve could see the strain in his neck now carrying the weight of a leg, could see the toes on the block go up a little higher as his hips shifted back. When he’d hit the limits of flexibility, the rigger tied off the line.
Steve laughs. “It’s okay because the universe as a whole learned to love him the rest of the 99 percent.”
Steve doesn’t know what he can say to stay. He doesn’t know what he can do to remedy the situation now. Tony’s pressing the watch into his skin like a reminder of how little time he has and he wonders if the other man knows. In a way, of course he would but Steve really hopes he doesn’t. Steve leans in for one more kiss, and then another and another and Tony submits repeatedly like he doesn’t know what else to do. No, Tony kisses back knowing he can be doing anything else in this world but he stays with Steve and indulges in what he shouldn’t have as much as Steve does the same.
The day ends in the lab with Howard setting up the personal computer. Tony is half asleep in Steve’s arms, mumbling about some multivariable calculus vector problem he was parcing earlier in the day. Howard decides to send Steve off to put Tony to bed after the long exhilarating day. Steve spots the Iron Man armor painting on the wall above Tony’s bed and smiles to himself at the sight. He wishes he could tell Tony all about himself from the future, and maybe one day when Tony is old enough to know the truth, Steve will tell him, but that’s not for many years and doesn’t concern him at the moment.
Peggy pulls on Steve’s arm until he looks over at her. Her face is firm and determined when she speaks. “You’re not supposed to be here at all and you know it but you
“She paints and sometimes she lets me sit and listen to music while she’s working and I love when she accidentally gets paint on her face because then I get to point it out and she gets really happy and then puts paint on my nose.” The toddler pokes at his own nose and then runs into the room. “Do you draw, Steve? Or do you play piano? I’m learning Spanish from one of my tutors.
Steve’s chest hurts and tears fill his eyes as he watches Maria bend her head down to kiss her baby boy. Howard is glowing beside her, looking down at his little family with a loving smile and absolute ecstasy. Maria’s brown eyes look up and over at Steve and she sends him a loopy grin. He smiles back, still off toward the wall, and she makes a motion for him to come closer. “Would you like to hold him? His name is Anthony.”
Steve shouldn’t be surprised Tony’s already speaking coherently in some manner eight months in, but he still raises his eyebrows as he gives Peggy a questioning look. She grins and kisses his forehead to smooth the creases there. “It was while we were first abroad; Maria paged you but you were out on the field so I answered. You can guess what it was.”
Steve chokes on air and thinks back to all the punches he pulled at Tony’s character now that he knows the other meaning of
On the upside though, Peggy always laughs when she sees Steve pacing down the hall bouncing the giddy baby as he spins a random fairy tale. It’s loosely based on reality but he makes things vague enough to not tip Peggy off to the details about Steve’s old life. Tony gurgles happily against Steve’s shoulder and seems oddly pleased with the stories anyway so Steve accepts falling for the little boy more and more as the hours pass.
“Steve,” she starts with a firm hand on his shoulder. Peggy is the only person to ground him, to keep him in this reality when his mind starts traveling elsewhere. She’s always been his anchor and for that he’s grateful and honored that she loves him so much to deal with the baggage that comes with time travel. “He’s here now.”
trilogy. Tony is over the moon about the Einstein book and wants to spend the entire day parsing the theories but his mom takes the presents away so he can focus on hanging out with Aunt Peggy and Uncle Steve.
Peggy hugs him and presses a kiss to his temple. “Sometimes we don’t know until it’s gone. Or until we’re faced with the newborn version of our affections in the case of others.” He snorts and turns in her arms. “In any case, you have the chance to be here for him again and that’s what matters. I’m here with you, Steve, I know what you’re dealing with. It’s okay.”
Steve pulls her into a hug. “I’ll be here for your son, you know I will. I’m not Howard and I won’t ever replace him as being a dad but I’m gonna make sure your son knows the joys of living.”
Steve’s head hurts. “He, uh,” The baby in his arms smacks his lips happily and then burps before giggling and babbling about whatever his neurons are processing about the moment. Steve pats his head and his gut clutches when Tony curls into the touch. “He hated me when we first met. We were, uh, battling this villain who had this powerful weapon that kinda elevated your anger when touching it, hell, even by being near it. I said some mean things, he said some mean things, and even though we fought together against the greater good that day, those mean things still left wounds in both our chests. I meant what I said, he meant what he said, and that truth stung a lot.”
“We’ll find a rhythm. It’s easier with music.” the brunette avoids all eye contact with Steve as they stand together under soothing sun rays. Steve nudges Tony to get him moving again. “Do you want music? I can get my phone. I have good songs. Fun songs. Nice music.”
The brunette gives Steve a look but then sits down by the easel and turns his big brown eyes onto puppy mode. “Can you draw me, Steve? I wanna see what you make when you see me.”
The blonde feels Tony’s grip tighten, fingers shaking in their hold. Steve slows their dancing and pulls Tony in for more of a hug. Tony’s arms wrap against his waist and he breathes out into Steve’s chest as they rock against each other. Steve closes his eyes and rests his chin on the top of Tony’s head. Tony pulls away just enough to look up into Steve’s blue eyes, lips parted for words never spoken. Steve starts to lean in before he can even realize it and Tony’s eyes shutter closed before he pulls back with a gasp.
Steve holds out his arms for the baby and stills when Peggy passes him over. Her eyes are warm and understanding as she watches Steve, brushing a hand against his bicep once he’s got the bundle in his arms. There’s a moment in time when the world seems to stop and every part of the universe comes in line to celebrate that moment no matter what. Steve thinks the moment Tony opens his big chocolate brown eyes and stares up at Steve with awe in his gaze is one of those moments.
Steve is 52 when Anthony Edward Stark is born. He’s known for years what exactly the baby’s name will be, who Howard Stark’s wife will be, Howard’s involvement with Tony’s life, the whole shebang. Peggy knows who Steve is; why he doesn’t age as fast as a 52 year old man should. He’s got some gray hairs and he barely looks 40 on a good day but no one really questions it. Howard definitely doesn’t question it, even as he spends years looking for the man that crashed his plane all those years ago. Steve wishes he could get Howard to stop being so obsessed but as long as Steve crashes that plane, Howard will keep looking for him no matter the reality Steve finds himself in. He wonders for a moment if Howard has a crush of sorts, maybe one that is never realized as the time period would never allow him to. Maybe that’s why Howard ends up so hard on Tony if he ever shows an interest in other men: he doesn’t want his son to deal with the internal struggles of homosexuality in a world that shuns it. He goes about it in a really bad way, mostly through neglect, but that’s a story for many years later.
