Sherlock swaying on his feet, hips moving in sync,  muscles rippling underneath scarred skin suddenly merging into Sherlock’s backlit figure against the window of their flat, his features highlighted by the glow of the little rainbow-coloured light bulbs, playing his violin… ‘
With trembling fingers Sherlock scrolled back down to the end of the flood of messages. His thumb hovered for the fraction of a second, but he threw his hesitation to the winds. He would give in anyway.
that you thought was at risk?” Sherlock asked and unceremoniously popped his trouser button open. When John only swallowed, eyes skipping back and forth between Sherlock’s face and his groin, Sherlock lowered the zip in a torturing slow pace, bit by bit revealing a half hard cock covered in black lace. John took a shuddering breath.
"Oi!" John bumped his shoulder against Sherlock's upper arm. And just like that the mood settled into familiar companionship again. It was reassuring; they were still their former selves; John still knew exactly how to take Sherlock's banter.
He'd only get some stupid ideas again." John laughed.
"Get more 'sets of data' as you'd call it. More opinions of people is how I think of it."
John huffed, pleased, and went looking for the song. Once he found it, he placed the phone on top of their joined knees.
"Well, the fact aside that you've been just as greedy an ape as him yourself only a year ago, the lap dance was part of the act. I have to say, it was a useful and essential part as it allowed me to get to Moran's gun and manipulate it. I knew he was the one Moriarty had sent after me. It was pretty transparent what The Spider was aiming for though. Did he really think I wouldn't notice he deliberately chose someone supposed to be similar to you? As if…" Sherlock huffed, apparently truly annoyed. "So, why was it different to everything else—which you didn't like to see me perform either? In front of others that is…" Sherlock tilted his head a bit to peer at John over his shoulder.
In the end he had totally lost it the moment Sherlock had spread his arms, letting himself fall, falling forwards.
"Okay, then. The game is on."
So, John guided the trimmer first over the plush arse cheeks, from the small of his back down until they merged into the thigh. Over and over again, from hip inwards, alternating between the sides. It was almost meditativ if it weren’t for Sherlock’s silent curses and John’s racing heartbeat. When only the cleft was left unshaved, the image of spreading Sherlock’s cheeks to get access to the dusty hair covering the skin in between, made John groan. He knew he should probably finish his work, which would definitely not happen this way. Besides, having only one hand to hold Sherlock's cheeks apart and one hand to guide the trimmer wasn’t particularly practical. Torn between his task and burning desire, a different much better plan formed in John’s mind. He’d get back to that tempting backside, but all in good time.
“Good for you then.” John ground his teeth together.
"I saw your confusion last night. It wasn't the time to explain then. I assumed you'd ask if you want to know." Sherlock scanned John's face, his eyes roaming John's features. John waited for Sherlock to go on, the silence stretched. When John was about to interrogate further, Sherlock started speaking again.
They stumbled into the bathroom, nearly tripping over in the attempt not to break their kiss at all costs. Still humming the pleasantly familiar tune, John only just caught them, engulfing Sherlock in his arms while trying not to slip on the bath mat. The door clicked shut behind Sherlock's back when John leaned them against it to regain balance.
Not only by his gun, not only physically, but all the memory of John, the thought of how he would react, softly judge Sherlock, kept Sherlock right. The dreadful feeling of never seeing him again had kept Sherlock alive. How it had provided him to do something stupid. How it had helped him suffer through pain and torture.
, because I’m also a
He sighed, stood on wobbly legs and went to the bathroom to clean up. On his way back to the sofa he picked his laptop from the kitchen counter as well as a glass of water against the dryness of his throat. Carelessly, he untangled  the sheets, tried to gather the soiled ones and threw them on the floor next to him. When he was fairly sure to have cleared the sofa from evidence of his activities, he settled, laptop on the low couch table right next to him.
"John." Sherlock huffed.
"..."
And with that the front door was opened and closed again.
At least now he was prepared for what he was about to find. And yet, he still wasn’t sure how to react. Just make himself noticeable? Just confront Sherlock? Wait outside and pretend to not have witnessed anything? Just… leave?
°°°°°°°°°°
"Not quite." Was the low chuckling answer he got.
John closed his eyes, took a deep breath. He feared that he had made things worse even though he didn't know what things that actually were, but there was nothing to it now. He already regretted his temper, he really had to get that under control. He couldn't allow himself more than… smash that slimy spider under his pretty sparkling slippers and for good measure stomp and jump on his remains like Rumpelstiltskin. Yes, that had to do.
“I wouldn’t know,” John interrupted, a bit annoyed but also a bit unsettled about the familiarity and ease with which Sherlock seemed to talk about it. Because honestly… What did he himself know of that part of society? Next to nothing, even after all this time of seeing the battlefield that where the streets of London at Sherlock’s side. But Sherlock only raised a doubting eyebrow at him. “Yeah, well, I can imagine…” John shrugged in defeat. How could he not, Sherlock always assumed the facts the genius had figured out would be magically transferred into Jon’s brain. There was some kind of telepathy between them though, but mostly that was related to when to pull a gun or when to giggle at a crime scene and when to better get home before things became indecent.
“Is all this…” Sherlock repeated, breathless himself, “... about the lap dances being exclusively yours,
“Not funny,” John tried to protest and be offended but the corner of his mouth twitched in amusement all the same.
"What exactly were you angry about?" he asked hesitantly. "The lap dance thing? Why did it bother you so much?"
Why wasn’t he able to deduce? He always had been. But his senses didn’t want to cooperate. Memories, dreams, hopes, fears all melting together into one pulp of blurry consciousness.
On his journey from bed- to bathroom he tried to come up with a plan, but the required thinking app didn’t seem to work properly in power-saving mode. Apparently, neither did his senses because he ran straight into Sherlock when he went through the kitchen door and rounded the corner to head in the direction of the bathroom. The suddenness and his muddled mind made him jolt and doused any traitorous and telling physical states.
He had brought the disc with him to Baker Street, left it behind for the unlikely case that he might show up… against all expectations. Maybe, if Sherlock didn’t want to get in contact with John, he would still take the disc, would still listen to what John had to say. And if not, John had at least tried, What else was left? However, until now there had been no reaction.
Only now, without a crowd blocking his view, with it flooded in bright light, John realised that the tendrils spreading out from the stage weren’t just funny gadgets. There were eight of them, four to each side. Spreading out like legs. Creepy, nauseating, spidery legs. Spider-legs. Him! All the anger and fury and rage built up during the last weeks... month? years, maybe… all that rose to the surface and made it difficult for John not to explode on the spot.
"John."
"Indeed."
“I know, lo…” John stopped himself just in time and froze. Slowly, stiffly, he raised his head. Sherlock looked rattled. He felt how Sherlock’s hand slightly trembled in his. He eased his grip so that Sherlock could pull away if he’d want to. He didn’t want to force him, to trap him.
He opened speed dial ‘1’, pulled a face and pushed the call button. He didn’t have to wait long for Sherlock to pick up.
“Hmm, I have an inkling but I think we need to confirm it.” John teased him.
John was horrified. What did Sherlock want to say with that? Did he even want to say anything? That’s not exactly what he said nearly three years ago. Back then it would have been exactly what John would have wanted him to say! But Sherlock didn’t! Why now then?
When he spotted a flash of purple from the corner of his eyes his guts started churning and his heart rate spiked to unknown heights, thrumming and pulsing through his body, flashing his system with adrenaline, setting a beat that only exhilarated the tension of his nerves, ready to snap like the strings of Sherlock's violin.
“You know, I’m not
Oh… but wait...
He felt his own cock thicken even more and an answering twitch from underneath layers of black leather and lace.
This is what they were - each other's counter balance. Affecting each other, correcting each other. Complementing each other. Together they were in equilibrium, harmony. Like a perpetuum mobile.
“I will do it again. You know how I am; caught up in a case, bored, annoyed or whatever. I’ll insult you, I’ll ignore you, I’ll criticise you….”
Jenny asked a bit less sweetly.
"Good. That's good!" Exhale on the other end of the line. "I just don't want any misunderstandings anymore. I can't… I think we only
"Well…" Mycroft started indifferently. "How have you been?"
“I’m not ‘people’!”
"John… *sigh*... Okay, then. Listen."
He knew that 221b Baker Street without a John Watson in it wasn't worth living in. He had experienced it before. Only at that time John had come back now and then. Even though he had always left at the end of the day. John had always needed an escape from his dull suburban life and Sherlock was all too willing to provide this distraction - even though the time in between meant nothing but waiting in agony for John's next escape. Now it was different. This time there wasn't any possibility of John ever returning… neither to 221b nor to Sherlock's life.
He tried not to think too hard about it and settled against the backrest again.
"Mhhh…"
"I left you. I lied to you for two years." It was like reading off a list. Point one, point two, … how many more to go? When would John tire in his efforts?
He sped up his pace. They had agreed to meet at the Espresso bar for a coffee to go and then afterwards just stroll through the park. He heard the gravel scrunch beneath his feet. Smiling he wondered what Sherlock would be able to deduce from this specific sound. Probably which road he had taken and how long he had already been walking. Which was hours. He hadn’t been able to stay at Greg’s and wait. But he had nowhere else to go to. So he had walked the streets and let his thoughts roam free. Not that it had had any useful effect whatsoever.
“Absolutely, Miss Elle Lamentory.” John nodded seriously. “How dare I doubt that.”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock smiled, a bit mockingly, a bit adoringly.
That should give Sherlock the chance to back out but also let him know that John cared. John didn't know if he should hope for Sherlock to take this chance or rather exactly the opposite. He wasn't sure what he wanted himself.
he heard, sharp, accusing, berating. The undefined room around him weighing on him, dark, dusty, suffocating.
"Let him draw his own conclusions. He claims to be smart after all…"
Sherlock shivered; it increased to a full body trembling.
and his heels
this happen! But what could he do? Get off the tube and go hide in some horrifyingly disgusting public toilet? Wouldn’t be exactly decent to go sit somewhere else, yeah? Cosy pub on the corner? “One beer and some nibbles, please. Oh yes, and some napkins to clean up the spunk after I get off with my phone sex date right here. Thanks so much.” Not a chance!
John stilled, took a deep breath, too exhausted to take any more. Why was he so devastated by all this? Why couldn’t he stand a silly argument? They had argued before, before all this fucking shit had happened and threatened to destroy them. They were shouting and swearing at each other, running off… but they’d always come back, most of the time just grinning at each other, giggling about their silliness and that was it. Now it felt as if his world would fall apart. He drew another deep breath, tried to get some oxygen which he felt had left his body entirely.
"Well, I had a valid reason."
And suddenly John understood;
"Mummy, leave him alone. He's a grown man, as am I by the way."
... Not everything needed words.
Spinning around in lightening speed she folded herself around the pole and let herself spin with the motion. With the music speeding up she stopped abruptly, raising one leg to bend it and hook it around the pole. Her hips started moving slightly and John realised that she had started to roll her pelvis and grind herself against the pole.
“Oi,” John raised his voice and slapped Sherlock’s thigh. The cabby quickly looked alarmed over his shoulder, but apparently considered keeping his eyes on the traffic more important.
“What about your trousers? Bespoke too, I assume?” He asked, aiming to collect the next piece of his poster for his inner eye.
“It’s just so much, John.”
“John, I understand. Really. I do. But you know… with these first lab results I just wondered… maybe it would have been better…”
“It’s Sherlock.” John said, fiddling with his napkin.
“So. What about Sherlock?” Greg kept insisting. “I assume it's not only him being his outrageous self. God knows you put up with
He propped the disc into the front pocket of his violin case. Closed the zipper. Patted it once, his hand lingering for a moment on the rough fabric.
, John had concluded. '
"Don't you have fun when you're working,
He looked at the screen for what felt like hours, until his eyes began to water. He assumed it was due to the fact that he hadn't blinked the whole time. Still, the merciless screen wouldn't offer him more than the few small lines which were burned onto his retina by now.
can put one and one together… with you staying with me and being gloomy as fuck, he not answering his phone and such...” Greg said running his fingers up and down his glass gathering the drops of condense.
"I'm here. You're here. We're together."
"I told you before, but I'll tell you again; you're the most human human being I've ever known. I was so alone and I owe you so much. And you don't owe me anything."
Speaking of, at some dreadful point he actually had to let go of his arm candy because his bladder screamed for attention. He told Miss Pirate in a, as he thought, clear and unambiguous way to stay put and not let anyone come near her. He didn't trust any of these folks after his spider-y encounter.
“Then you have to tell me...”
"He's banned from crime scenes. For the time being until
In that case I want to give you a present as well. Don't bother with a list though. SH
“Nice,” he purred and stretched the hiss like a snake, which sent a shiver down John’s spine. He looked down at John with his dark rimmed eyes, the dark purple eyeshadow accentuating the colour-shifting irises, making them gleam like fireflies in a night sky.
And suddenly everything fell into place. Reason. Give me reason. How could he have been so blind? This was Sherlock. Sherlock! And Sherlock didn’t need a reason for anything he wanted to do. But what he needed was… reason! Intellect. Mind. Rationality. Logic. Reliability. Facts.
"Never, John! I promise, I'll never leave you again! I wouldn't… I couldn't… I… You… "
Later when they sat across from each other at the kitchen table when John had calmed down a bit, he dared to look a bit closer at his boyfriend.
But Mycroft added in a more tender voice: “You know that I  care about you, Sherlock!”
The difference has been, back then he hadn’t had anything to lose. Nothing he would have considered valuable. But John finding him high as a kite, John looking so utterly hurt, he had realised that that could have easily meant the definite loss of John’s trust and friendship. And in contrast to drugs,
But then there was John this afternoon, accusing him of making the same mistakes he had done when he had to leave, back then; Moriarty and his network on his heels. How could John not see that everything was different now? How could he not see that it had been the sentiment that had made John a target? How could he not see that it had been Sherlock's weakness that had been the cause of the events leading up to the fall and all the sacrifices that had to be made. Sherlock tried to do better now. Sherlock tried to be stronger now. Not get weak again. And therefore protect John Watson. How could John not see that this was an improvement, that it was preferable? For both of them, for everyone!
“Well, what’s this then?” he asked, standing in the middle of the room—dressed in nothing but pants, hair ruffled, hands stemmed in his side.
"Uhm… alright then. Okay, yes.. yes. Okay. Noted." John cleared his throat. Sherlock heard him inhale sharply. Bracing himself? Trying to be strong? Disappointed? Of course he was disappointed! Sherlock had hurt him. Again. That was the
“Is that what?” The man asked back, a bit irritated and… anxious?
do this. And we
Sherlock exhaled one more time.
" The hand around Sherlock's waist traveled downward until it cupped one of Sherlock's arse cheeks, squeezing it and bringing their groins together in a very tempting touch, making them both groan. However, this wasn’t about sex—not
This meant John hadn’t forgiven him at all. He was still angry at Sherlock. He wasn’t happy, and it was all Sherlock’s fault. There was always something. He should have realised. Stuck in his own mind, strained to detach himself from any distracting thought, he hadn't. He hadn't seen it for what it was. He had missed it, he had failed John. Again!
"Look after him, will you?" Mrs Hudson asked quietly and turned towards John.
“Yep.” John popped the P like Sherlock loved to do and felt a pleasant and at the same time painful tug in his gut at that reminder.
Whatever Sherlock had anticipated, it wasn't this. Mycroft turned on the radio.
At this point Greg just nodded, silently, giving John room to gather his thoughts.
“Exactly that. Strictly speaking, a surgeon!” John said triumphantly, straightening his back — finally something to impress that madman.
Sherlock pressed the tips of his fingers of both hands against each other and lowered them until they lay softly on the lips. Gently tapping and sliding his fingertips back and forth over his lips Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to focus on the only task that needed to be dealt with at the moment - to shield and steel himself for the day to come.
Yes. SH
“Mmhmm…” Scott answered.
It stung. Even if he was aware that John knew better — of course he did, he was a goddamn doctor — this flat out dismissal stung. True, he had, apart from anatomy, sparse medical knowledge. He had done his research, he had done his best. Most of the time the people he was interested in, work related that is, weren't in need of life-saving anyway… not anymore at least… and the lives he saved through The Work were those of people he had never met and will never meet and therefore weren't interesting.
A wet cheek pressed against his own. A whisper to his ear.
But he didn’t notice and he didn’t care, because that exact moment, the catlike woman sat and swung her legs smoothly over the edge of the stage.
But the only thing coming from Mycroft was a silent "Sherlock" and that was even worse. Sherlock growled, dropped his chin to his chest and shook his head.
“We’ll be together this time,” he murmured against Sherlock’s scalp. The scent of Sherlock’s shampoo filling his nostrils, comforting, calming, and suddenly making it all feel so very much more real.
“Oh, I think my “handling” was quite successful.” John smirked, pushed his nose against the mob of curls tickling his chin.
“Don’t know the code,” John shrugged and looked expectantly at Sherlock, who locked eyes with him and said calmly, “5646” John typed it in slowly as was his habit, the screen unlocked and only afterwards it dawned on him. His head snapped up and stared at Sherlock. “Really?”
Sherlock walked over to where John was still hovering. His legs already decorated up until right above his knee with the laces of his insanely high heels, which made him sway his hips with every step he took. John got a bit lightheaded just watching him walk. That was very promising for when he would see him on stage again. Probably he’d just go up in flames, problem solved. Jeez…
"Oh… cut the crap, Mycroft!" Sherlock was getting angry. "I know for a fact, that you can start a war by flipping a switch and make the Queen disappear in a blink!" He raised his voice. "What's keeping you now?"
should!”
Suddenly Sherlock jumped up, almost bumping his head against John’s. He wiped the phone from the table and flug it against the fridge, where it bounced off to land on the floor with a loud clatter, the music died immediately, his chair tumbled over noisily. John jerked back, startled, eyes wide in alarm. Sherlock stared at him for a moment, face contorted in a pained expression, troubled emotions clouding his eyes, shoulders heaving from his heavy breathing. Then abruptly he turned and steadied himself on the kitchen counter.
“Sherlock,” he croaked, not sure if he wanted to stop or to encourage the man, his arousal evident in the way it tented the front of his today’s black dress pants.
After two days Mycroft brought a new mobile. Some sort of fancy British Government thing. Sherlock was reminded of John's beloved secret service movies—Bond… and his quartermaster. Who always equipped the agents with the most ridiculous devices. John liked the scenes with said quartermaster the most. He didn't say, but Sherlock had deduced it fairly quickly. Sherlock had always suspected that the quartermaster fancied the Bond guy… 'had a crush', John would say. However, it was never confirmed on screen and John didn't acknowledge it either. Bond guy was probably too manly in John's eyes… too 'not gay'... to take such a construct into consideration. Sherlock on the contrary pitied the quartermaster, not that he would care though. It was a fictional character after all.
“What no?” John asked, a bit taken aback. “You mean, you don’t accept my…”
Yes, alright, but what was he missing? Where did it all go wrong?
“Right. Uhm… his old self.” Sherlock could hear him huff. "Great. Just… great." Sherlock's imagination pictured John rubbing a hand over the short hair in his neck as he always did when he was uncomfortable.
Miss Pirate closed her eyes and sighed and something that looked suspiciously like bliss spread over her features.
was fighting for? Something that didn’t even exist.
This letter was a mess.
John swallowed, intentionally not avoiding Sherlock’s questioning gaze. Alright then, he had seen it coming. But even then, digging deep to wake the buried ghosts took the kind of courage that was never honoured with a shiny medal. At best, afterwards, one was no longer haunted; rewarded with one burden less to carry.
"Our room."
John still wondered; hadn't he said as much? Yes, he had told him all that. Why wasn't it enough?
This time he didn’t have to look up the number, just checked the outgoing calls. ‘You know your life really sucks when the only contact on your list in several weeks is a phone sex hotline…’ John thought, but tapped on the number anyway.
"It's not only the offering of lap dances, is it? What's it you're
John couldn’t see the path anymore. What was the purpose of all this new-old life they were trying to create? Wasn’t everything meaningless if they went on as before?
John doubled over from laughter, tears running down his cheeks. Sherlock glared at him as if he feared that John had gone crazy as well.
He winced.
Sherlock wasn't able to look away; this was everything he had hoped for, thought about uncountable times and still it felt unimaginable now it was becoming true. His mind felt a bit dreamlike and vague. He couldn't have that; he had to be clear headed, be present in this moment, experience every second like through a looking glass to store it all away for eternity. He swallowed, took a deep breath to get rid of all the fog caused by chaotically entangled emotions.
Sending you all lots of love,
"That's known to be my forte," Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at himself. Wincing he felt a faint blush creep up his cheeks ...
“Oh, I'd love for Mycroft to pick it up and bring it over," Sherlock grinned, "but I'm afraid Moriarty's minions took my bag with all my belongings including the dress when they found me. I haven't seen it back. Don't know what he has done with it. Probably getting a plushie Purple Pirate made of it."
flattered by your interest. And would I have been honest with myself, I was much more than just flattered." He looked somewhat apologetic at John; waited for a reaction. John only dropped his gaze for a short moment, shook his head slightly and smiled knowingly. When he looked back up there was nothing but fondness in his eyes. He stayed silent so Sherlock carried on.
But despite these thoughts John’s feet carried him inside, forced by the will to set some things straight, by curiosity and by something he couldn’t quite identify. The thought of Sherlock dancing hadn’t left him for the whole timespan of the last… god, it hadn’t even been a whole day. Felt like an eternity.
As in a daze, John was staring, all the reasons he initially came for forgotten, adrift in empty space, all grip on the world he once knew was lost.
"How's that scientific?" John felt like a character in a bad sitcom, both of them not moving, leading a conversation of barely understandable mumble-muffled words.
“We’ve done this before, remember. I didn't handle it well back then either. You know why I was that furious when you came back? That was the reason. I was so hurt that you had left, I was so happy to have you back, I was so torn between the past and the time ahead, I felt so much, I couldn’t place it or understand it.” The tumult of emotions seemed to untangle a bit, the eyes observing him were a bit more scrutinising. “I lashed out, too. I was afraid, too. I’ve almost lost you back then. I’m not letting that happen again!”
*******
His last hope had been to get in contact with Mycroft. But he, too, had apparently vanished into thin air. No reaction to messages or emails. No calls got picked up, neither on his mobile phone nor at home. His presence at the Diogenes had been negated. John had even gone so far to try to catch Mycroft at home, but was only ever greeted by his staff who kept telling him that Mr Holmes was not available for the near future, that he was traveling, work related, as he so often did. John wasn't fooled. Sherlock had berated him often enough about coincidences and the laziness of the universe. Both brothers not available, both brothers out of the country at the same time? It didn't take a genius to draw conclusions. But what was it worth when there was no way to get in contact with either of them. He knew the Holmes brothers, was familiar enough with the powers of the older one and the stubbornness of the younger one. He knew when he was outplayed.
At least not the one he’d want to. Not now that Sherlock was gone. John had had his chance. And he had wasted it. Anyway, would Sherlock have wanted it at all? John seriously doubted it. Greg was of the opinion that that song was a love declaration. But how could he be sure about that? Sherlock had never said a word. And not a single time the word love was mentioned. What if Greg was wrong? What if he interpreted Sherlock’s song choice out of the same appropriate-friendship-feeling-confusion? Maybe John massively exaggerated it all and just heard what he wanted to hear… hoped to hear... Plus, there was the minor fact that Sherlock wanted John out of his life. And the more than clear message, that he thought John wouldn’t be good for him. That Sherlock was looking for something else. Even worse, some-
After a while he gave in and sat up. Ruffling his hair with his right hand he waited until the room around him slowly stopped swaying. When he wanted to get up, the mess his release had created on the sheets and his never taken off shirt and also his belly, made him cringe. He had totally blocked that out, still feeling uncomfortable about the intensity of his thoughts, feelings, physical response.
It left him half naked, in the truest sense of the word—arms and torso bare, lower half of his body still dressed. John swallowed hard; no matter the situation, the sight was undeniably sexy—Sherlock moving smoothly like a feline predator on the hunt, intimidatingly calm and composed even though his dark shadowed eyes emitted sparks of anger; curls in a disarray; face flushed from his troubled emotional state and possibly some other emotions as well; the naked skin of his muscled torso sinfully illuminated, the dim lights accentuating every hollow and every bulge his muscles formed, caressing his lean form, his slim waist; the well worn denims John had never seen on Sherlock before hanging low on his waist, tight enough to pronounce the curve of his arse, loose enough not to cling, exposing his hip bones and the now hairless patch of skin underneath his navel, where normally a thin trace of dark hair pointed down to where now Sherlocks long fingered hands rested on his waistband; thumbs hooked in, fingers suggestively framing his crotch.
“John…,” he said under his breath, voice low and dark, sending little sparks of fire through John’s veins. “We’re not done yet.” And it seemed to be a reprimand and a whine at the same time. And it was true, they weren’t and John doubted that they’d ever make it to the club, but it wouldn’t matter because he wouldn’t survive that long anyway.
“Among other things,” Sherlock suddenly murmured and John’s head snapped up where he had lowered it, lost in thought.
His pulse was throbbing in his ears and was muffling all noises even more. He cursed inwardly; he couldn't afford missing the tiniest sign of danger or signal to act. First of all though, he had to find out what was going on in the first place. It didn't need a genius to know that this wasn't the cosiest of situations they could find themselves in.
His mental state was worse than expected. He used to delete 'Hi'-s now he had become a 'Hi' himself. He cringed.
“That’s why we’re here…” John hummed, pulling back from Sherlock to take his hand and tug him away from the door into the bathroom.
"Because it makes you whistle."
The brothers stood facing each other. Unspoken conversation bouncing back and forth, a trial of strength, a showdown. Neither of them wanting to give in, neither of them desiring to win the game. Just peace, Sherlock thought. That's all he wanted. Peace.
The next morning found John Watson awkwardly strolling the aisle of women’s toiletries at the chemist's. Sherlock bustling about in a flurry of excitement pulled out one product after the other, discussing the pros and cons noisily with John across the shelves as if they were the only customers. John tried hard to become invisible while still showing interest in the new "project" for Sherlock's sake. After all, it was in his Won best interest as well, he just wasn’t able to concentrate on the task without thinking about the implications of the supplies Sherlock gathered. It would be highly inappropriate to indulge in those thoughts in public…
"... and the things you've said, I don't know…"
"Follow me." Mycroft said and turned.
John was furrowing his brows, squinting his eyes. Bewildered. He then turned to the other man. Not less wary.
It was an announcement but John had sensed the question mark at the end of the sentence. Greg seemed to be quite uncomfortable about his home. John had turned and had given a reassuring nod.
"Greg…?" Sherlock started to interrogate, but Molly looked at him, pleadingly.
"Right you are, love. The only queen I love and care for." He pressed a kiss on top of Sherlock's head. And was rewarded with a sticky layer of… something… on his lips.
"No, love. Don't worry, nothing of that. I meant pretending without talking it through. Just assuming and hoping everything would work out just fine. Listen…," John grabbed Sherlock by the lapels of his dressing gown and locked eyes with him, pinned him into place. "I'm happy to play any kind of fool, for you. I will run along behind you like some groupie, making you look like whatever the case requires, if that’s what you need. But we're going to need to coordinate. No more going off on your own and no more leaving me in the dark. We're in this together, yeah?"
“No,” John hissed, stopped in the midst of the dancing crowd, turned. “
Yours sincerely (but emphasis on 'sin' for this chapter... sorry... not sorry),
Without further warning, he quickly reached down and deftly spread the dollop of shaving foam in one smooth motion from the top of Sherlock's twitching cock, over his balls, his perineum and all the way to the top of his cleft. Eyes blown wide, Sherlock's breath hitched in surprise and he threw his head back and groaned when on its way back, John's deliberately pointed finger caught on the rim of his anus, pressed boldly against his perineum and John's hand ended holding his balls in a firm grip bordering on painful. John rolled Sherlock's balls between the fingers and palm of his hand for a brief moment before sliding upwards and taking a just as tight hold of his penis. He quickly smeared what was left of the foam over Sherlock's shaft never easing his grip, which practically made him wank Sherlock in a frantic pace. Sherlock's erection swelled in John's hand at lightning speed to the point of busting; Sherlock's breathing became erratic and he made little hiccup noises.
Afterwards Sherlock wasn’t aware of anything, letting the music simply wash over him. One of the rare moments he dreaded - his mind in a state of anarchy, doing unbearably much and absolutely nothing at the same time, overload and shutdown. This had only happened on very few occasions and Sherlock still remembered every single one of them. A pool, a roof and a wedding  among them. Shooting up the maybe not just seven-percent-solution was the least painful part of it. Mycroft was still convinced that it had been an accidental overdose. Well, let the man have his illusions. However, hadn’t that been the main reason he had used - turning the uselessness of his brain into silence? This emptiness though wasn’t what he had been looking for in using, but it was nevertheless welcome right now.
He had made an utter fool of himself. And if Sherlock despised anything then it was a fool. Fools, idiots, the ones that didn’t realise what was directly in front of them.
“That’s not what she…” he started angrily, ready to defend Miss Pirate's and Sherlock’s honour at all costs.
Somehow, John knew that was his signal. He was almost close enough to just tackle the man, but all the fricking furniture was working against him.
Sherlock leaned into his touch, resting trustingly against the palm of John's hand. John didn't move, held him steadily, secure. Traced his thumb slowly, tenderly over Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock had once again nicked John’s laptop, but this time with a legitimate reason—research.
talked. That was the whole point. But that was something Greg couldn't know. It wasn't as if Greg would sit next to them to babysit their conversations.
Hiding behind a corner of the common sandy building in a deserted village, scanning every alley, door and window in anxious anticipation trying to foresee the enemies next move?
thought John. How was this supposed to explain anything? The sheet in his hands trembled like an autumn leaf in the wind. He wanted to scream. He wanted to shake someone. Preferably Sherlock. He wanted to yell.
"I'll make you happy, John. I promise."
When the next morning a completely agitated and bewildered Sherlock stormed into the kitchen, John had to do his utmost best to keep his facial expression under control.
"You won't let me pass."
This was pure logic. But then, logic never had been John's forte. Maybe Sherlock couldn't expect that much of him in his current situation.
"I looked everywhere, Sherlock. I couldn't find you. I felt so helpless, so useless… I almost went crazy…"
“And why is this troubling you so much?” Sherlock’s hands rested on John’s shoulders now, his eyes studying him earnestly but fondly.
Finding himself a bit ridiculous, he took a deep breath and tried to consider what Sherlock needed him to do. Taking position backstage, so to speak, he peeked through the gaps into the actual club. It wasn’t much different from the club they had met in, a mix of dance floor, bar, dimly lit nooks and space for an audience. Probably they were all the same in some way even though they tried to stand out by ambience, music, themes, audience, level of luxury. But at the end of the day, it was all about the same thing—booze and sex. Admittedly, he enjoyed both those things for himself, but not related to Sherlock and clubs. Well, okay, not entirely true… Sherlock and clubs and he himself being
John felt the beat of the music thrum through every fiber of his body, matching the hammering pulse flushing in his veins and throbbing in his groin.
*stop*
One of the guys grabbed his upper arm and dragged him along and with a sigh John followed as well as he was able to at his hoply pace. He was unaware of the knowing grin spreading on Mike’s lips walking behind John.
a reason for these curls to look as impeccable as they do!"
“How does one do this? How to… start, you know?” Had he, John “Three Continents” Watson, honestly just asked that question?
Being oblivious to the glimpses the people threw his way at the sight of him, John awkwardly tried to type his response one-handedly.
enough…? Would he stay? Would they be alright nevertheless? Would they last?
"I do. Catching snow. And it tickles."
“Cleaner.” Sherlock said cheerily.
John's stomach did a little flip at those words considering they weren't actually married. He cleared his throat.
It didn’t get any easier for John when Sherlock also unbuttoned the first two buttons of his collar. Did he know what he was doing to John? John still couldn’t estimate how aware Sherlock was of his insane attractiveness and its effect on John. It was… immense, both of it. And John didn’t know what his face was showing, when Sherlock looked at him again. Sherlock took a deep breath and gave him a short nod as a sign to start.
He was a bit caught off guard when he discovered that he had, without being aware, reached his floor and was facing the door to his flat.
Sherlock stared at the screen, blinking and blinking and blinking. This… was ridiculous! And definitely not what he had expected. Not at all. He read the reply again. And for a third and fourth and fifth time. But it didn’t change. The hotson-person seemed to be serious about this.
“You know, Sherlock, it’s just... for me, it’s…” John tried to start explaining.
The breathing on the other end was getting a bit faster, a bit more shallow. Nervous then. Stressed? Anxious? Very unfortunate he wasn't able to take a pulse or observe other clues like pupils, body language, perspiration. Scent. Mouth. Hands. Gazes. Voice.
“Zip…”
He didn't want it. Someone delete it, take it away, put it back where it came from.
The last remaining item laid out by Sherlock was a jar with old fashioned pomade. John sighed. Right, Sherlock had nagged him more than once about his outgrowing hair, but honestly… who cared? Now with the ongoing pandemic, sitting indoors all day every day with only your partner and your housekeeper… well, your not-housekeeper… to witness; why would he go through the ordeal of an appointment at the hairdresser? And after the disaster some weeks ago he sure as hell wouldn’t let Sherlock get anywhere near his hair. Not for styling that is… So he snatched the jar, trudged down the stairs and sneaked into the bathroom to slick back his hair.
“Uhm… I thought… weren’t you two… together?” John asked, confused. Greg turned his head, looked at John.
Eventually, John dared to move his hand. On first instinct he brushed the curl that had fallen into Sherlock's face, from his forehead behind his ear. This was one of the instincts he had suppressed a million times in the last couples of years. It felt freeing to finally give in. A heretofore unperceived weight was lifted off of him when Sherlock didn't object. Rather the opposite actually. He closed his eyes, seemed to chase the touch, not unlike a cat. This realisation warmed John from the inside with a fuzzy happiness.
“That is undeniably true; we never talked about it. But that’s why we’re here, right? To change that. And as I said, I saw you. You’ve never seen yourself dance like that, Sherlock. It’s… it’s breathtaking. And even if it is hard to believe I can draw conclusions, too.” This earned him a small grin from Sherlock. “You know,” he continued, “I know some of what happened before, I see you dance, I hear your music, I see what happens afterwards. I might not be able to fully grasp the content, but what was obvious is that it is pure emotion. Something happens when you dance, Sherlock. You’re able to express and process emotions you have no access to otherwise. Or for those you can’t handle any other way. You make decisions, you draw conclusions, you understand yourself in your dancing. And if you dare to show me, if you allow me to see that, if you let me in... I might understand it, too.” He watched Sherlock closely, curious about his reaction. His eyes lost focus, moved rapidly from one side to the other, which was a clear sign for John that he was weighing, evaluating, before they narrowed and the piercing, sharp, clear, familiar gaze was back and scrutinised John.
on his phone and made his way to the centre of the room.
John straightened his rusty legs and stretched his stiff back and stood when he thought he was able to without pulling any muscles. He huffed a laugh when he realised the contrast to Sherlock's ability to move effortlessly as if he had found a way to circuit nature's laws. John wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if Sherlock had managed even that.
John got sick to the bone; and while he had to deal with that madness, his Miss Pirate was on stage, showing off all of her striking features and He. Didn't. Have. A. Chance. To. Watch!! Which only heightened his irritation and made his responses sharp, his humor sarcastic, his comments snappy. God, he was so done! He played along because, honestly, there was no other option. He could hardly blow their cover just because he was annoyed. Well, a teeny-tiny bit more than annoyed, for fucks sake, but there was no opportunity to talk to Sherlock to estimate what progress they had made. His nerves were running thin.
Sherlock hesitated. Did he want that? Would he even like the thought of The-woman-known-as-Mary ‘retiring permanently’ as Mycroft would put it? Despite everything John thought and despite everything Sherlock went through he sort of appreciated her. There were only so many people who could outwit Sherlock Holmes. It would be a shame to put such a clever mind to rest.
In the end Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath at the same moment John started to speak.
"Possibly…" some of the former confidence was back in the playful purr that met John's ear. There was still a trace of caution though.
Oh damn, he had to stop this.
“Undercover…,” Sherlock squeaked, swallowed, cleared his throat. “You’ve been on an undercover mission?”
"Yes, you were!" John protested as hard as he was able to. "Fucking hell, Sherlock. That Moriarty guy and his gang had abducted you, you were completely at their mercy, dammit."
Aargghh… How? How was it possible that one short call last night had given him wanking material for the unforeseeable future? To be honest… John knew exactly how. That voice. That! Voice! John wasn’t a greedy man — he’d already be satisfied with that voice alone. Or by that voice…? Whatever… He’d buy it canned in a tin if that’d be possible. Although, admittedly, he wouldn’t complain if the lips that were forming those ridiculous words were to be part of the package as well. It must be a sensual mouth belonging to that voice, mustn’t it? Oh well, better not think about it while taking a shower to get laid by someone being Not The Voice…
"Good. I know an Indian restaurant just a few corners from here. Their chilli dishes are acceptable even if not superior and they're still open for selected clientele."
“Oh come on, John. You met Sherlock, right? How is he? Did you talk?” Greg inquired.
His mouth went dry when she slowly caressed her hips to reach behind and cup her butt on top of her skirt. Leaning slightly forwards and sliding her palms across the round curve of her buttocks she made her skirt shift the slightest bit revealing the hint of a tiny lace panty covering well rounded plush arse cheeks.
While John was musing about the might-be, probably-was experience his Pirate had, one of her high-heel-clad feet lifted and the tip of her toes wandered sensuously slowly up her calf, dragging the thirsty gazes of her audience in its wake. When it reached the hollow of her knee her leg snapped to her side like an arrow and made her spin that John got dizzy just by watching. John really had no idea how it was humanly possible, but in the end Miss Pirate sat gracefully on the chair, straddling it backwards, her back turned to the audience. As a consequence she was facing John and immediately locked eyes with him. Miss Pirate's intense gaze kept him hooked, never leaving him when she rolled her shoulders, her upper body shifting from side to side, legs splayed obscenely wide, the skirt even if short sufficiently draped over the intentionally not-hidden demonstration of Miss Pirate’s actual genitalia. Now John saw what Sherlock had meant with ‘the eye sees what the mind wants to see’. If one really cared, there would be enough opportunity to sneak a peek under that skirt to discover who Miss Pirate really was.
Was he jealous again? Over some imaginary meaningless partners of the past whom John might or might not have shagged in a shabby restaurant toilet? For someone working in the sex business this guy should really get his priorities straight. It couldn’t be healthy if he behaved this way with all his clients. Unless he didn’t…
“Who’d want me for a flatmate anyway?” John really couldn’t imagine anyone who’d be able to stand him for longer than a day.
He rang the bell and also knocked for good measure. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. For a short moment he considered to seek shelter under the awning of Speedy's cafe only to dismiss it immediately, afraid to miss crucial seconds to make himself noticed. What if Sherlock closed the door before John even had a chance. So, standing in the rain it was.
"John," Sherlock pressed a kiss on his worriedly wrinkled forehead, "it's all fine!" he said in a low voice; John sighed.
“Molly, it's okay.” John interrupted her. “Molly.” He said a bit firmer when she kept staring at her feet. When she finally looked up he hurried to reassure her: “It's okay. I know you care and that is… good. Yeah, really good actually.” he nodded. “But… you know… what was I supposed to do? I… just… yeah.” He shrugged one shoulder, being out of his depth, too.
to know by now…” He fell silent, not knowing how to react. Thoughts, emotions, fears and sorrows whirling in his mind. Did Sherlock really think that low of him? Where had that come from? Who had hurt him this much, that he would expect people to react this way? Suddenly some gears clicked into space. “You still don’t trust me.” He said a bit more forcefully, taken aback.
Turning himself into the typhoon he needed to forestall to be burned to ash, Sherlock steeled himself, arms positioned out in front of him, as a means of defence. One leg pointing sharply forwards, daring anyone to come near. In a flash, it was forcefully swung in a circle to pull himself into a pirouette of lightning speed. Without touching the ground his leg worked relentlessly, forcing him from one turn into the other without a break, without time to think, without any possibility to find a fixing point.
In which John Watson has his hands full.
Wordlessly panting he watched when Sherlock shifted a bit backwards, creating space, lifting himself up, and moved his lubed up hand between his own thighs. Still fixing John with his piercing gaze, he hooked his fingers under the rim of the thin black lace panties and pulled them aside; cock and balls still held inside it only bared the soft and sensitive flesh of his perineum and left a hint of what lay beyond.
Sherlock tried to breathe. He wouldn't succeed. His head felt dizzy, he felt sick a bit. Why had he done this to himself? He should have known that it wouldn't help… at all. As if it wasn't difficult enough to care and feel and hurt and miss and have to go on with his plans anyway. As if it wasn't enough to feel himself break. Why must there be evidence of John's suffering? He would have preferred to cede that to his imagination. Because it didn't change anything. Because John was right. That's what life was like. In John's words… it sucked. But as always, John saw but didn't observe. He was drawing the wrong conclusions. They wouldn't get better. Not together.
“It’s my turn on stage again, would have had to leave anytime soon anyway,” Miss Pirate said, all business.
What attracted his attention again was the sudden cheerful chatter of the presenter.
Sherlock couldn't hear him yet. No use to say it all out loud. John hoped that he was thinking loud enough, that Sherlock would understand anyway. That Sherlock would know.
Feeling confused John frowned and said: “I’m sorry, what?”
"Sherlock, I know this might not be the most opportune moment… although, it is actually… however, I wanted to talk to you. This is important and and I
"Interrupted? Ha!" John laughed out humorlessly. "If I hadn't
“No, I mean it... listen; just because I manage to talk to you
“Of course I remember.” Sherlock looked confused. “You followed me?” He sounded so astonished and pained at the same time as if he had wished for nothing more that day than for John to come running after him and hold him back. If only John had realised then, could everything have turned out differently? But different from now wouldn’t necessarily mean better, would it?
He sighed in relief when he heard Greg enter the boat, even though he wondered if everything was alright. But the moment he heard Greg's whistling he knew the date had gone well. He was torn by the contradictory feelings barreling in his chest. He was happy for his friend. Of course he was. Greg deserved some happiness and company and… love? And so did Molly. He wished them all the best and hoped that this would develop into something serious. But at the same time he felt heartsick with all the missed opportunities, with all lost chances. With everything that wasn't possible any more, no longer an option.
(See the end of the chapter for
?" Sherlock scrunched his nose.
“But… the case…” he tried to sound somehow reasonable, and failed.
“You’re swearing quite a lot, John.”
Since then John sat somewhere in the flat - well, boat - with a cup of tea in hands, most of the time lost in thoughts. Occasionally he replaced the tea by a can of beer or a tumbler of whisky. All three of them didn't help. He had discovered that he preferred sitting in the so-called kitchen, at the bar stool at the sort of kitchen counter. Here he could look out of the only window which didn't face the Power Station. Or the roof terrace would do as well as he had the possibility to turn away. But that didn't always work. He caught himself glancing that way by times until getting back the grip on himself and forcing himself to look away.
"But you see? Not even an exceptionally nice guy as Mike had been able to gain my attention. Nobody and nothing had. When something was new it was fun, but everything and everyone was boring after a while. So on I went, looking for the next shot of happiness. Everything that interrupted the dullness was welcome… work, the army, getting pissed, a quick fuck preferably in a different bed each night."
Dear readers,
“Do you mean… is it…” He had the browser open and was about to start typing, when a big hand closed around his and stopped him in his efforts.
"Wasn't easy to pay attention to any of those idiots and
John let himself fall back on the deckchair. the sheets resting on his chest, still in a tight grip, he looked at the sky and the trees and the houses and the people walking by in the distance and everything felt far away from his own reality. He concluded, this couldn’t be it. He still didn’t understand. He wouldn’t stop until he did. He wanted to understand.
"Care to elaborate?" Sherlock had a hard time to stay patient and grasp her intentions.
So, John swallowed, squared his shoulders and walked over. He sat next to Sherlock on the bench and without saying a word or even acknowledging him, Sherlock handed over the coffee. Their fingers brushed for a tiny moment and John wanted to jolt back in reflex but that would have made the coffee fly. And what would Sherlock deduce of that? Inevitably his thoughts went back to his nightly wank and he turned his face away from Sherlock in the attempt to hide the probably plain evidence of the nature of his thoughts. Right this moment, John's mind was that muddled by the memories that he wasn't even sure if they had ever touched for real before! This felt so new. This felt different. This felt thrilling and terrifying at the same time. Of course they had, he scolded himself. They had even held hands, although John had been Sherlock’s pretended hostage back then. John had patched Sherlock’s injuries up more than once. And he had hugged him at his own wedding of course. And he had… John swallowed thickly, why were his thoughts always straying back to that point… he had touched Sherlock, Sherlock’s cold hand, taken a non-existing pulse. He had wanted to pull Sherlock in his arms, brush the bloody curls from his forehead, hold him, hug him, squeeze him back to life.
“Yeah, don’t want to live with some random bloke…”
He sat the tumbler back down and raised his eyes again and with that John knew, he wasn't off the hook.
"I never eat."
On setting foot in the flat and laying eyes on Sherlock the dizziness of last night decided to join the party as well.
John's nerves snapped. He pulled his hands forcefully free and strode past Sherlock. He shortly paced up and down before he spun around.
"That's right, Sir." Miss Pirate murmured, submissive, as far as an outside observer would be able to tell. But John knew better. He saw the playfulness in his lover's eyes, heard the challenge in the seemingly humble voice.
“For God’s sake, John. Wait!” He got jerked around at his shoulders and found himself face to face with a panting Sherlock. He held his gaze and saw that Sherlock’s eyes shifted back and forth between his own, contemplating, evaluating. When he spoke again, his voice was steady, reassuring and soothing. But also desperate and pleading. He kept John’s shoulders in a tight grip.
"Mycroft. Please." Sherlock said silently, whispering.
Sherlock winced and he radiated agony, John could almost feel it physically. John closed the last remaining space between them and laid his hands on Sherlock’s waist. A connection, a reassurance, nothing more.
"I…" John started but paused again. "I warned you, it's laughable really…" He cleared his throat and started over, "For some stupid reason I thought… or
“I have no idea, John. It’s not as if I have a plan or made a spread sheet or something.” Sherlock said and John had to hold back a cough, almost choking. He blushed and was grateful that he could hide his face pretending to see to the coffee.
Deep within he knew she was right. Deep within he knew what he had to do. What he would do. And he almost fainted because of the lightheadedness the raising anxiousness caused. Mind dizzy and whirling, it left him reeling and a bit wobbly on his knees. His first instinct was to flee. He knew he couldn’t, he wouldn’t. He didn’t want to.
There had always been so much comfort and camaraderie between them after solving a case. John had always marveled at Sherlock’s brilliance!
“I want to suck you, John.” Scott murmured, intimately low. “Will you let me suck you?”
“That’s no acceptable reason.” Scott stated as if ending the call was a state's affair. Which it definitely felt like!
“You don’t?” And where did that insecure undertone come from now?
Stretching his arms over his head, exposing and displaying the entirety of the otherworldly beauty of his body, Sherlock languidly lolled on the sheets. Coquettishly batting his eyelids, he pointedly took hold of the headboard, gripped it tight the way they sometimes did when the cuffs were too far away and the orgasm too close to get up and get them.
Dear readers,
How was it possible to feel a whisper?
"John?" He heard Greg call from inside.
“How am I supposed to know?” John gestured, nearly sloshing his beer on Greg’s face. “That’s what he said. And the way he said it, it sounded more like a some
His hair, sticking out in all directions, fuzzy, matted, ridiculously tousled.
He finished the last remaining steps down the ladder and straightened his spine. Now, back inside, he felt the chill the evening air had left on his skin despite its summer-like disguise. He made his way over to the couch, his bag cramped next to the armrest, his makeshift home. He cringed at the thought of Greg's home being this muddled because of him. He pulled a jumper out of his bag, pulled it on and went to the door to slip into his shoes.
Suddenly, he was shoved back forcefully, painfully parted from the grounding and soothing warmth of Sherlock's embrace. His shirt fell to the floor. His blurry gaze was met by Sherlock's stern stare, eyebrows drawn together, brow wrinkled.
… what I do to try to keep me right when
"It is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognise danger when it is close upon you."
The first thing he realised the moment he surfaced from his fugue was music blaring in his ears. Vaguely he remembered snapping at an employee to already sell him these goddamn headphones. He had needed them. Desperately. He couldn't stand the outside world any longer, but his inside world even less. Nowhere to hide, all boltholes out of a different time. The time of the game. The time of John. He wouldn't find any peace there.
John was squirming, trapped between hard wood—the door was what he meant of course; even though there was definitely some different kind of hard wood involved in the trapping as well—and a firm body. Sherlock just held him now, looked down at him; his eyes still weirdly intensified by the dark shadows surrounding them; even more mysterious and enigmatic now the flowery flash of purple was gone. Lean yet strong bare arms pinned his own above his head, leaving him with the view of bulging biceps’ and hairless armpits, spreading pheromones that made John’s mind go foggy. Right in front of him his eyes were glued to the subtle swell of pectorals straining the skin tight vest Sherlock was wearing. The way it clung to Sherlock’s torso it strongly accentuated the little nubs of Sherlock’s erect nipples peaking against the thin fabric.
“You’ve seen him?” he had asked, voice small, nervous.
even worse
"Fucking Hell, Sherlock, you can't…"
"Shhhh…" John soothed him, caressing his face, dotting his face with tiny pecks like he had done earlier this day for the same reason
John thought.
"Need my help? Is what I wanted to say…" he rushed out, although it was obvious that it definitely hadn't been the case. "That why you… you shaved? The tape, I mean? What would I… how..." John wanted to slap himself for the way he was babbling unable to hide his uneasiness.
“No,” John sighed.
"About what?" Sherlock asked defensively, warily. Stopping his bustle. Inspecting John head to toe.
he thought. London was too expensive for his small army pension. And who would want him as a flatmate.
“What gave you the impression that I’m better at expressing my emotions in dance or even more that you’d understand me better? We never talked about it, so how can you be sure?” Sherlock asked without any venom in it. It wasn’t an accusation like it was often conveyed by this sort of questioning. Sherlock genuinely tried to understand, to find out if it was true
a conflict, but rather how to bear it, accept it, ignore it, adapt to it. Run from it.
"Shhhhhh… John. You're acting very odd and counterproductive, even for your standards."
“Hey, mate!” Greg greeted him with a friendly slap on the back. “Good work here. Looking for that lot for ages now. Pretty cool Sherlock was willing to help out with this one. I hope you recorded evidence,” Greg winked at him, the boyish grin beaming even from behind his mask. “Not something one gets to see every day, ey? The great detective in panties?” He laughed heartily. “Pity he had to change already, would have loved to see him all made up… We had a pool running, you know…”
“Just unlock it,” Sherlock stopped him, when he wanted to hand it over.
Once, in a fit of idiocy, he tried to check his email account. Only to discover that Mycroft had taken the hint with the phone very seriously and had also deleted all ways to contact him online. Even his blog was deactivated. All his posts still online, but not accessible, main page message: this blog is abandoned for an indefinite period. He took note of it unaffectedly. He had expected something similar anyway.
With a sudden determination he stood, closed his eyes again for a short moment, bracing himself for whatever might come next, and hurried after Sherlock.
good.” John confirmed convinced in at least that part of his abilities. He raised his head to show that he accepted whatever game this man was playing.
(one of my betas asked me to add a bucket of ice water... Unfortunately, there's no ice-water-bucket-emoji. My apologies.)
came up with this genius idea though.” He gave Sherlock a stern look. “So now, stay still, Holmes! That’s an order!” John instructed in his best Captain Watson voice.
John hadn’t expected the laugh the woman huffed out. She quickly caught herself though and cleared her throat.
“As you wish, brother dear.” Mycroft calmly ended the discussion. “Have it your way.”
Meanwhile Miss Pirate had bend her neck, head resting back on her nape, curls swaying freely and a slack expression of pleasure on her face. Her dark purple lips slightly parted, puffing little breaths, eyes closed, looking as if detached from this world and her performance.
"What about actors whose profession solely exists for the pleasure and entertainment of others?" Sherlock went on in the same matter-of-fact voice. "What about detectives selling their most precious feature, their brain, just for the thrill of chasing the most abhorrent kind of human beings?" Now Sherlock looked daringly at John, challenging him to contradict. He lowered his voice, emphasizing his next words. "What about doctors touching people in the most intimate way during their most vulnerable moments?" Sherlock's piercing gaze bored itself into John's core.
"Please…"
“John…” Sherlock winced. “I don’t know…”
Suddenly he felt small. The unseen roof rising high above him. Next moment his arms grew long… long… couldn't control his arms. His legs felt numb, but his feet kept moving. They were not connected, not his feet, no connection, just pulled along.
"Please," he whispered.
"Ohhnngg… Sherlock," John grunted, "you're not serious, are you?"
Of course it was. About what else? John was starting to frighten Sherlock…
John still didn’t know what Sherlock was thinking. His message could mean everything. But it was a sign, a sign that Sherlock was finally willing to talk. That much must have been clear after yesterday. No hiding, no assuming, no holding back anymore. Sherlock knew now without any possibility to misinterpret what John was feeling for him. They had to address it today. In some way. Sherlock had to react, to make a statement. Because there were really only two options, right? ‘
John barked out a laugh; release of all the remaining tension. Then, he teasingly raised an eyebrow and went back to his borrowed demeanour of Hollywood golden era heartthrob.
And when Greg finally had said a bit awkwardly, “Here we are,”rubbing the back of his neck in self-consciousness with one hand, John had looked up and groaned in resignation.
"John, I will do everything for you."
After his… well, breakdown is probably the most suitable description... Mycroft had interrogated him about the sincerity of his decision and the feasibility of the project. Obviously regarding mental and physical health. But Sherlock had found John's USB device. He saw his assumptions confirmed that John wouldn't see reason and was much too stubborn to give in to participate in the necessary and logical measurements that must be taken. Therefore he felt vindicated in his plans. At the same time as writing the email to John he had reinforced the request he had made the day he went to see Mycroft at the Diogenes Club. And then, the same night, unable to sleep, turning it all over in his head and reflecting upon all possible eventualities, he got the call from John. And he had felt sucked in again with the intensity of a maelstrom and he had realised that he had to speed up his undertakings. Time was pressing, his weaknesses threatened to get the better of him. He couldn't risk it.
Concerned and insecure he scanned Miss Pirate's face. It had been one hell of a weird evening. The eyes meeting his own were like deep dark pools—calm, earnest, fathomless. After a moment of taking each other in, grounding each other again, Miss Pirate nodded almost invisibly small.
Long slender fingers drummed on the tabletop a couple of times before…
"What's all that about, John?" Sherlock asked a bit reserved, when John had slowly calmed down.
“What in God’s name can be impossible about a foot?” Sherlock asked puzzled while he wriggled his toes in John’s lap when John started trimming the hairs on his ankle and shin.
“But I do,” murmured John against Sherlock’s skin.
“Yes. Obvious.” was the clearly bored answer delivered with a deep sigh. “On the Central line to be precise, which is a much more interesting detail by the way.” How could one single person sound this smug? But then, he had every right to be.
“Oi!” John glared at Greg without meaning it.
"That had always been more your responsibility, although I can assure you…"
Desperate pleading voice, begging.
Text message.
It had also been an emergence into a new chapter of his life, it had also been an escape, an unknown future ahead. He had also been hurt, abandoned, had lost the grip on his life and for that reason tried to find a new purpose. The very familiar mix of emotions, fear but also resignation at the same time, threw him back years into a time long forgotten.
"No, John. I mean the drugs from
During the day they were their bickering and teasing and arguing and love-making selves and John couldn’t imagine

For you to see the difference:
"So, what are you doing?" Greg asked, clearly avoiding to talk about his evening, probably to spare John.
he thought,
So he had picked only his most necessary belongings to live through a couple of days and had contacted Mycroft again. They had agreed that the cooperation would be much easier, if Sherlock stayed at Mycroft's… or maybe, Sherlock had insisted… just a little bit. And here he was. In this impersonal room, with its perfectly comfortable bed, with its neatly made up linens, with its everyday dusted furniture, with its emptiness, with it's Johnlessness.
He guided their hands carefully to his face, cautious to not lose contact. Once in front of his mouth he detached their palms, but instead of aiming for Sherlock's he pressed his lips against his own palm. He watched Sherlock closely and saw his eyes widen the moment he realised what John was doing—he took Sherlock's kiss over from his hand like from a blueprint. He licked his lips and Sherlock swallowed audibly.
“Oh,” whispered Scott, then started hesitantly, gaining confidence with each of John’s approving hums, “you already know the upper part, so… there are my feet to begin with. They’re quite big, but sinewy and slim; same as my hands.” ...appreciative, enticed hum… “directing my gaze upwards, following my legs, which are long, as everything on me I guess…”
Some of the outfits John liked better than others, same as the roles they implied for him to play. He managed, but they didn’t all come easy to him. However, one aspect always stayed the same—his roaring protectiveness in the face of the unfaltering interest shown towards his Pirate as she, unlike he himself, never changed her ways as the mysterious mesmerising Miss Pirate.
"No, we definitely shouldn't do
"Uhm… Sherlock?" Familiar voice, dear voice, warm but reserved, hesitant but inquiring. Sherlock blew out the breath he was holding.
“John, apparently I’m really not good with this. I keep making a mess of it. But do you know… the reason?” He looked John in the eye and engulfed him with the piercing intensity of his gaze.
John had to smile against his will and turned his head too.
"It's fine. It's all fine."
Okay, so John was still in denial. Maybe he had even forgotten that he had called? Sherlock had to be careful.
And he had needed an outlet. Needed to get rid of the heavy cape of dirty grey sentiment that threatened to pull him down, to bury him alive. He needed to get clean. Get bare.
If John was absolutely honest, which of course he was NOT, then he would have to admit, that this were the best moments of his god damn crazy life. But what he did instead of being honest, was muttering curses and glaring daggers at Sherlock who seemed to be oblivious to his current state.
“Well, usually that didn't include much talking. Especially not about ducks and morgues.” John added with a wink aimed at nothing but his ceiling. Maybe Scott had felt it anyway judging by the snort. However, at least it seemed to have dissolved his foul mood.
Well, after the surprise of John's presence alone, it was still a mystery to Sherlock what the man's motivation and intentions were. Yes, he was on a bloodhound-like hunt for Sherlock. That much was obvious. But after having caught Sherlock, having cornered him, having trapped him… then what? Sherlock had thought that he had made himself pretty clear. What about "go separate ways" was that difficult to understand? Why would John keep trying when Sherlock had told him repeatedly that there was nothing to gain from it. Why wouldn't he see reason? It was irritating in the extreme. Most of all because it was exhausting. Each time he had thought that he had escaped John Watson's orbit, his pull and power of attraction, that he wasn't any longer threatened to be lured in again… each time the man appeared back on the scene and was a test to Sherlock's steadfastness. It was utterly inconvenient that John Watson was the only person who had the ability to make him falter in his decisions. When all he needed in a time like this was a straight plan… how ironically fitting… without any qualms. However, John Watson being so fabulously and utterly delightfully John Watson-y made that an almost untenable task.
“No? Alright then. Then we won’t need any shaving foam after all. Great. Okay with me.” John nodded, turned and left a dumbfounded Sherlock behind in the bathroom.
Oh shit, this man really wasn’t doing things by half. His plain bluntness was even sexier than any playfulness could be. John exhaled, feeling his denims grow uncomfortably tight.
"Then stop behaving like my pimp," Sherlock growled between breaths, marking his words with the bold movements of his pelvis, raising himself only to sink down on John's stiff prick again with vigour. "Because you're not!" he hissed, never faltering in his efforts. Sweat making his skin sheen, and his curls cling to his forehead. John held on for dear life, even though he was convinced he had actually died by now; if this was heaven or hell he was not sure yet. "I'm not yours to sell. Nor anyone's." Sherlock's short hot breaths met John's parted lips, they shared the spare oxygen in the narrow space between their faces. Sherlock relentlessly rolled his hips, rose and fell in John's lap. John's sight started to blur at the edges, even if his focus on Sherlock never lost its sharpness. "But you, acting as if you own me..." Sherlock went on, voice becoming rough and ragged, interrupted by breathless grunts and moans, "... is exactly the same thing."
here and now
When Sherlock looked up with gleaming eyes framed by the most adorable laugh lines the only thing John was able to do was to respond with a smile as broad as Sherlock's.
He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, rolled off of the bed and went over to stand in front of the big window. He had to clear his mind of all this toxic, because distracting because painful because fruitless thoughts. He watched the deserted back yard. Flowers blooming, leaves beginning to sprout, an early butterfly, a honeybee crawling tired and slowed down by the chilly air across the window sill. All wasted to a garden as empty and solitary as Sherlock's bed, as Sherlock's life. As Sherlock himself.
"Yes, sitting. Thank you." He couldn't hide the grin in his voice.
“Then tell me.” John said quietly.
He cried.
Then he got to work—swipe after soft swipe over closed eyelids, forehead, the bridge of the noise, chin and jaw and perfectly shaped lips the pads absorbed layer after layer of the make-up that covered the face of his detective. He tried to be as thorough as possible and when he was pleased with the result he pressed another tiny soft peck on the relaxed and now familiarly pink-ish lips to indicate that he was done. Eyelids, slightly shiny from the lotion John had used, fluttered open and an affectionate gaze met his eyes.
"John, what…?" Sherlock gasped somewhat startled.
Sherlock would say.
*****
"Who?" asked Mycroft, eyeing him suspiciously.
John's chuckle turned into a full-blown laugh. Surprisingly, his...genitals, as the man had said, didn't seem affronted in the slightest. Rather the opposite...
And once again, Sherlock left. Left John behind, not saying anything, not explaining, just whirling around and rushing down the stairs. John didn’t even hear the front door closing.
Sherlock squinted his eyes, smiling devilish.
He grimaced.
Sherlock let himself fall back in his chair, swallowed and followed the advice of the blogger and started scrolling and reading and got more and more flustered the more he saw. Most of all his mind was blown by the fact that John was part of this community. And seeing his blog, even a quite active part.
"No!" Sherlock yelled. Petulantly turning away from Mycroft, as if the older one were about to pick the phone from him in an infantile squabble. Mycroft sighed.
He couldn’t really blame himself given the circumstances lately. But now he had to improvise. Unfortunately he had chosen his white dress shirt this morning, his casual one but none the less expensive. The only option was to do without. It wouldn’t be that intolerable as the temperature outside was increasing and the sun warmed the air inside the building through the windows . He even got glimpses of the dust whirling in the incoming light out there where he would stand in just a moment. He would be able to feel the sunbeams caress his skin, feel the warmth seep into his body, taking away the tenseness of his muscles. He noticed that he was even grateful now for the fate that made him forget his shirt. This would do, and it would add just the last missing bit to the task at hand - trying to lighten the dark shadows lingering in the corners of his soul.
Sherlock didn’t even think twice when he once again hopped into the black car in front of the Diogenes Club and slumped into the back seat.
When his laptop had finally started up and he watched his desktop flicker on, his eyes fell immediately on that little icon he ignored successfully most of the time. He wasn’t able to bring himself to delete it. But he wasn’t actually keen on being reminded of it, either.
"Oh, do I?" Miss Pirate pulled back, put space between them and raised one of her perfectly traced eyebrows dismissively. One corner of her purple lips pulled down, she very nearly spat, "And why would
Mrs Hudson whirled around, a bit dramatically as she used to do, and rushed down the stairs as fast as her hip allowed her.
He had to know. If not Afghanistan, then what? Was it totally unrelated to the PTSD maybe? That would open up a totally new range of possibilities.
“Really, Scott, I…” he panted and was relieved to hear the man whisper ‘Me too, John. Me too…’
"Don't you think…"
"What? Being right?"
"But then people do little else…"
"When they found out about Harry. And Harry's girlfriend. It was hell, Sherlock. I couldn't stand the constant fighting, stayed over at friends more often than not. I left her there all alone. I didn't stand by her side." He swallowed, hard, and felt his throat choke up. "And then, one day, it escalated. As much as my mom and dad hated each other, that day they were as a unit against Harry. And where was I? In my room, muffling the arguments with music. Did nothing but wait for the storm to pass. And she knew, Sherlock. She was called names and got insulted and I didn't do anything about it. A fucking coward." his voice was strangled.
“Not so sure anymore.” John muttered quietly so that Greg could hardly understand what he was saying.
“I’ve seen you enough times; I know now that it is your way to let it all out, everything you keep under lock and key. When you dance there seems to be nothing to hold you back; no restrictions, no boundaries, no shells. You seem to talk to me somehow. You’re letting me in without knowing it.”
*******
“Because I had a row... in the shop... with a chip and pin machine!” John grit his teeth and pulled a face.
“No!” John wouldn’t let him enter those areas of his self-awareness again. He thought they were long over it. “Sherlock, listen to me, you’re not a sociopath and you have never been!”
Was it?
John just stared at his closed laptop.
"Really, John, this is immensely inconsiderate." Sherlock huffed and was scooping even closer to John, digging and burrowing his head on John's chest and in his neck as if he were one of the pillows.
"You have seen me only mere hours ago. And the only thing I've done is trying to merge in with the furniture in your guest room!" Sherlock snarled. "What's the point of that question?"
"..."
John chuckled and resigned to his fate of trying to nourish them the upcoming two weeks by tinned food alone.
“Okay.” Sherlock still didn’t sound convinced.
"... ridiculous…"
He thought. Although it didn’t give him any satisfaction at the moment.
There stood a naked Sherlock, looking sheepishly at him, hair a rumpled mess, chest and arms and legs a map of patches in different shades of red. Shifting awkwardly from one foot to the other he was wringing his hands.
Without further warning Sherlock turned and strutted to the living room, picked up things John didn’t know they owned from drawers John didn’t know existed, put them all in a travelbag and grabbed his coat from the rack.
“Not that bad, is it?” He said happily through the buzz of the water, just hard enough for Sherlock to hear. A low confirming and content hum put a smile on his face. “Rinse,” he ordered softly, pulling Sherlock closer, under the stream of water.
"I'll prove to you that you can trust me."
"... told you…."
"When will you…" apparently he had stared open mouthed without realising, because he was a bit hoarse. He cleared his throat. "I mean the make-up… Do you need help there as well?"
“And you? You’re a pirate then?”
"I don't have time!" Sherlock shouted, jumped up and slammed the knuckles of his fists on the tabletop.
“It’s not as if you’ve never seen him before, right?” Greg teased.
Looking at it and listening to it from this new angle, John made his way slowly into the living room, closed the door carefully behind him. He put the coffee cups down on the couch table, shed his jacket and dropped it on the sofa without leaving Sherlock out of his sight. When John cautiously took one step after the other to get past the couch table, Sherlock seamlessly transitioned from one melody into another. John was aware that it wasn't Sherlock's usual repertoire he was playing, also not improvising as he often did in the early days. The slow wistful string of notes of this new melody softened John's steps as if he were walking on a cloud, the syrupy yearning made him slow down until he came to a halt in the middle of the room. Close enough to notice how Sherlock's breathing quickened the moment his hands and arms stilled and the melody gave way for
"Sherlock, listen." She cleared her throat and seemed to prepare herself for what she had to say. "Greg phoned me and told me that you're back at the flat."
“Love, I don’t think it’s good for anything really.” John had shaken his head at his nutter of a boyfriend.
to the subject," he said suggestively, "do you think a dancing pole could be installed?”
"And you told me it isn't always the case. So which of the two is it?"
"I was thinking… would you mind transferring this sleeping arrangement to 221b?"
"Why don't you just tell me?"
After a short moment she seemed to reconsider, inhaled and added:
“Please, Sherlock! Let it all behind. Don’t let the past win.”
That aside, it gave him the opportunity to watch Sherlock without restraint. This way he was able to enjoy the lines of the slim silhouette against the incoming morning light. The soft sway, the wafting of burgundy dressing gown. He could make out a white dress shirt underneath and was thrown back to the last time he had seen Sherlock in such a shirt, in admittedly a slightly different state and frankly considerably less clothed. Here, like this though, he wasn’t any less… well… beautiful. The contrast of the white of the shirt and the red of the gown to the black of the trouser legs peeking out from under it and the dark mob of curls on the other end was striking, as if deliberately arranged. Bathed in light, the tips of said curls formed a glowing halo around Sherlock’s head, made him look like a piece of fine art. John couldn’t suppress the little gasp escaping his mouth. Also, he didn’t want to, he had nothing to hide.
“I’m not sure.” was Sherlock’s evasive response and he sounded somehow… relieved? John frowned.
He kept staring at Sherlock in front of him. He couldn’t help admiring the appearance nonetheless. Maybe even more now knowing what Sherlock had endured; what he had been able to withstand, how strong he must have been.
The whirlwind of a man stopped short and twirled dramatically to look at John.
"No. Not this time at least. Although I know you're up to something."
“A… doctor?” Scott was obviously honestly surprised. Ha, served him right! “A medical doctor?”
"Because I'm not a woman." Sherlock shrugged, apparently insecure and self-conscious.
Cherishing this feeling for a moment he slowly became aware of the substance of his thoughts. Very literally speaking.
He didn’t know if he should laugh or cry as he realised that Miss Pirate was slinking her way in his direction, swaying her hips provokingly with each stride. But he was frozen in place so he did neither, apart from sinking a bit deeper into his chair.
"You… love it?"
A sad huff. Sherlock was still staring at the tabletop. John squeezed his hand a tiny bit, whispered “hey” to gain his attention, but Sherlock only shook his head no.
Sherlock lay on his bed, wiggling his feet in distress, fiddling nervously with his phone. He knew John. This had to work. John liked it when Sherlock behaved well. That always made him smile. John tried to hide it but Sherlock knew it anyway. And especially after nasty arguments like  today's… well, yesterday's by now… which had caused all of the current trouble. This must be it. Sherlock being nice ended most of their conflicts. It always caught John off guard. But didn’t that actually say a lot about what John Watson was thinking of him? Did he still not expect Sherlock to be able to be nice? When the only reason Sherlock gave any effort to it at all, was only ever John? Did he still not know Sherlock well enough to know that he hated to spell it out?
They weren't filled, but was that a reassuring fact or exactly the opposite. Patting the pockets he detects what he had wished not to find. A glass vial, unbroken, unopened,still full, but same here - was this meant to calm him? John held the items with shaking hands while rising again.
"Oh, fuck a duck!" he muttered.
That settled, they quietly went through their
"How long do you usually take to drink your coffee?"
Close them. No, not good.
“Not in combination of the length of my hair with that size of curlers. Basic knowledge, John.”
“You said. Yesterday. That’s why we’re here, right?” John hustled after Sherlock, almost running over an old lady, who complained about the youth of these days and barked at him to "keep his distance" and that he "really should take the risks more seriously" and "that he should ask one of the poor doctors if he still doesn't believe it". John quickly muttered an apology and "yes, poor doctors indeed" and hurried after Sherlock, who hadn't noticed anything of the encounter.
“Not a problem. You’re heading north I assume?” Scott said flatly as if working for an insurance callcentre rather than for a sex hotline.
For a moment Sherlock just looked at him, scanning his face, searching his gaze. Then he lowered his eyes.
"You damn well know I did!" he grinned and did his utmost best not to rise to his tiptoes to be able to reach the tempting lips and smear that purple lipstick all over his face while kissing Miss Pirate senseless. Wouldn't do for their cover, he guessed.
So, he waited. He positioned himself in a dark corner of the hallway and observed; his mood hanging over him like a dark cloud heavy from an approaching thunderstorm, keeping everyone at a safe distance. The glances thrown his way were  suspicious, estimating  and... if he wouldn't know better... bordering on frightened. Did he know better though? Did he know anything right now? Wasn't that the entire problem?
And suddenly John’s view shifted. Sherlock looked different. He hadn’t changed anything. But his leg, slowly lifting, tip of his toes smoothly sliding along his calf, upwards, reaching the lower part of his inner thigh before losing contact. Flickering outwards, up in the air, mirrored by the same side’s arm, hand twisting and curling at the highest end of the artistic sculpture he formed… it was like flames licking along his body, the sparks caught on his legs turning into ember, brought to life by the air sloshing around Sherlock’s dancing form. Sending tendons of bright warm light into the atmosphere. Making the hot air wafting around him, covering him in a cocoon of melting heat.
Greg, embarrassed, rubbed the back of his neck and ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair. The grease on his hands, still not fully absorbed by the cloth, didn’t help his appearance one bit. It made his hair messily stick in all directions.
*****
And then the silly thought that Sherlock might not want him around…. Why did John think Sherlock had gone through all that trouble in the first place, all that mess, all that… torture? Why did he think Sherlock had come back, when he had already been officially declared dead? No need for that, except for John. Being close to John. Not to have to endure any more of that pain in his chest that hadn't been caused by whips or punches, by hunger or too many hours on his feet without any rest or sleep.
Would John still be willing to take his hand? Take that step
Oh. Sarcasm, right? SH
John's hand! Only now did he become aware of the significance of the gesture. They were out in the open, in public. No longer sheltered at Baker Street or in a cab, no longer hidden by the thick walls of the engine room. For everyone to see John had taken his hand and held it steadily. That had to mean something, hadn't it? He kept the private little smile hidden inside his mouth but could feel it spread its warmth on his face and down his neck, his chest, his arms. Would John be able to feel it in his palm?
He was still engulfed in the music when his phone vibrated. Lost in thought and drowned in the sounds he hadn't even heard the signal.
Surely now John had to be satisfied. As this was probably his goal after all. Sherlock would never give in to this game, that much was certain!
"Mrs Hudsoooooon. Give them back! Immediately!"
this corsage in dark purple (like the purple shirt of sex)
don't—where I woke. A place familiar to you as well, by the way." He felt his voice getting harsher, his old sarcastic voice, sharp like a knife. As painful, too. He felt the urge to hurt John. To make him see. Better on purpose than by accident. "I
He had hesitated and then flinched - Sherlock hadn't, Sherlock hadn't reacted at all - when he had pushed the needle into the flesh to draw blood samples. It couldn't be helped. He needed to know, he had to be sure. The reassuring red flowing into the syringes had helped to ease the tension. A bit. The papers in his hand helped even more. They let him breathe again.
“How does one do that?” he had whispered.
“John,” he said under his breath, more a whisper than voice. He stared at John in horror. He didn’t know if he was able to do that in his current state.
"That's what I want, too. Exactly what I want, Sherlock." he murmured back and couldn't resist to steal one more kiss from that sinful mouth. It was just a short touch of lips, a chaste twirl of tongues; but when he broke the kiss Sherlock followed his mouth, leaned in, eyes closed, as if drawn in by a magnet.
to understand John. Without it he felt as if he were floating in the void. Lost all grip.
No, his mission, everything he had done could not be for nothing. He wouldn’t risk getting John in any kind of danger! Not after having secured his safety in the first place. No… taking him to minor cases was okay, just to please him. But if Sherlock expected any danger at all, he wouldn’t falter,  just to keep John’s mood at ease, to avoid arguments. John could be stubborn though, he always had been. '
He was engulfed by sensation as he had never been before; desire blooming low in his belly; heat making his own advances more daring.
"What's Christmas-y about anatomically incorrect hearts and astronomically incorrect stars and botanically incorrect trees and… what are those?"
Confused, but out of options to deny, John gave in, trotted over and took a seat.
"Uhm… yes?" Same effect on John apparently. "But you also…" A tad annoyed but also a bit anxious, Sherlock could see. John already wanted to put the music back on, but Sherlock covered the mobile with his hand just in time.
Somehow, this spiked John’s anger even more than actual danger would have. Was this all just a joke to her? Here he was panicking and she was… what?... having fun? John growled. There were definitely some things he needed to set straight.
give me a list with all things that make you angry?" John giggled. The body in his arms was rippling with laughter as well. "Asking for a friend…" John added smirking, which caused Sherlock to sit up in lightning speed, their arms forcefully untangled.
would have been the one finding you?? Huh? Ever thought about that??" John yelled.
When he realised that it threatened to drown him, that it was too much at once, he tried to channel it, to guide it. He tried to make use of the well known tunes of the grandmasters of classical music, of his personal favourites of modern compositions, but his mind wandered, he got distracted. He didn’t dare to access his own compositions, too charged, too many spectres hiding there.
wouldn’t have the courage to do it, nothing would change. And if nothing changed, then nothing would change. And that was unacceptable under the current circumstances.
Another whisper in his ear. For his ears only. Mike.
John tried to find the right words to describe what had happened just now or to explain what he was feeling. If he wasn't dead and if this wasn't heaven then his life was infinitely better than he had ever dared to hope. He sighed deeply.
“It is what it is,” Sherlock mumbled.
A flash of a memory crossed Sherlock's thoughts. John, exhausted, the lab at Bart's, his head resting on the table, snoring slightly. And Sherlock himself, fidgeting with the squash ball in his hand, already planning how to use it later that day. He had been watching John in his sleep, the whole night, his heart already aching with his loss to come.  There had been no other way. He had been convinced. And even now he didn't know if he could have done anything different. If that would have changed anything about their current messed up situation.
He pulled John forward and kissed him deeply again; John savoured every single minute of it as if it was the first and the last time, almost unbearably happy to know that it wasn't either of them.
“Everything. All of it.” Sherlock grunted without slowing his steps.
it would ruin them if they gave in and dived into the depth of their feelings without bearing through the uncomfortable part first. They couldn’t just brush it off, they couldn’t avoid it.
“We followed him, John. I assumed this would happen in some way. But even I had underestimated the effect it would have.” Mycroft cleared his throat. “He walked the streets for a while… well shuffled would fit it better I guess. I assumed he would seek shelter in one of his boltholes. But he never headed for one of them, not even gotten close to them. As if he downright avoided them.”
“Nope. Nothing.” Scott coughed.
"But we'll both grow a beard!" Sherlock called after him, scandalised.
“No,” Sherlock answered, fondly, “you wouldn’t be you otherwise.” He gave John a warm smile. “And you’re incapable of bothering me.” Sherlock locked eyes with John for a while and John realised that this had been Sherlock’s version of ‘I know, …’. A grin spread on his face.
******
Maybe that was it. Maybe his plan had gone wrong and he had been lying in hospital ever since. Has everything he thought he remembered just been a coma induced dream?
"..."
"Why have you been outside with this weather?"
An earthy, warm, exclusive scent, a hint of fresh sweat underneath. An intoxicating mix, dark and mysterious.
Only a couple of strokes later, not able to warn the other, he could only gasp before seeing stars, feeling his chest tighten, as he was coming hard, spilling on the strangers hand and his own shirt and trousers. Wave after wave of pleasure ripped through him and his come kept spurting with each tease and stroke the Pirate gave his cock to guide him through his orgasm.
Exactly what he meant. He
It took quite a long time for him to regain his senses and to pull himself together.
John looked at Sherlock, scanned his face, took in everything that his eyes showed willingly, without restraint. His breath was taken away by the sheer amount, the plethora and intensity of emotions he saw there. He held Sherlock's gaze, drowned in his eyes. Waited. Gave Sherlock space to take the next step, like a dance.
"I love you so fucking much… I want you so much..." John panted, holding their faces close, pressing their foreheads together. "Christ, what you're doing to me. And I've barely even touched you yet…"
“Come on, John. The game is on!” He called over his shoulder and off he was like the whirlwind John loved, flying down the stairs.
Or was it about himself… about Sherlock? Had he read it all wrong? Wouldn’t be the first time. Their argument, which had undoubtedly led to this display of emotion, hadn't been about Mary after all. Not on the surface at least. John bringing up the fall. Again. Of course the fall… everything was always about the fall. As if he would have had a choice. It’s not as if he had chosen to fall for fun…
to get it now. Sherlock couldn't possibly be any clearer.
“Of course, John. Do keep up. I told you it’s very convenient to have you here. So, get on with it.”
"How so?" Mycroft asked. Apart from his eyes nothing was giving away anything out of the ordinary.
"Don't… don't ask… just don't, okay?" he said intently, shaking his head subtly.
"Pocket. Dressing gown."
“That one time, when you asked for someone to shatter you, to make you feel alive?” John swallowed and Sherlock felt all the dread from that moment raise again. But John looked intensely at him, as if to pull him back from where he was retreating to. “I kept wondering why it wasn't me. Why couldn't I be the one? What was I lacking… I couldn't figure it out. I wanted it so desperately to be me.”
An impish smirk on her face Miss Pirate rose to her full height. Without waiting a single second, she hooked one of her knees around the pole and spun in circles holding onto it with one hand, the Jolly Roger held in the other wafting after her, floating in the stream of air she created.
They hadn’t talked about the night after their first visit to a club, even though a simmering tension kept lingering during their nights out. In a wordless agreement, their shared bath and John cleaning off Miss Pirate’s make-up became their daily—or rather nightly—ritual; as if it would wash away all the insecurity and confusion the case entailed and draw a line in between club-them and home-them.
“Come on, genius. This
“A place to go to.” he said, evading the actual question.
“Yes. Yes, John…” Scott breathed into the speaker.
A dancing pole, center stage.
while there is still a chance, because that chance doesn’t last forever. Trust me, Sherlock: it’s gone before you know it.” she said, roamed his face with her gaze like a lovers caress before their last goodbye. When she met his eyes there was the slightest tint of melancholy, although barely noticeable beneath the overpowering fondness, trust, encouragement, support. Sherlock had to swallow back a lump forming in his throat. How did he deserve this? Trust? Support? Friends?
John didn't know how to kill time and paced back and forth in the small space the boat had to offer. In the end he settled, again, on the roof terrace although it was still windy and much too cold. The chilly air seeped even through the blanket John had picked from the sofa, but he couldn't bring himself to go back inside, dreading the suffocating construction of low ceilings and the small room. It hadn't bothered him before, but he now felt caged in here, trapped. Probably because now he really had nowhere else to go. This wasn't a stopover any longer. This was the final destination. With the addition that even here he couldn't stay.
“But... you know... you could have kept your handcuffs,” he smirked and wrapped his arms around this mysterious Pirate-Detective that somehow chose him out of all people.
"..."
"Tits, you mean." John deadpanned.
"Ha!" John barked out a laugh when he pulled up his tweet. "Still a draw!"
Sherlock looked stunned and John marveled at the feeling to finally come clean with everything.
John caught him in his arm, pressing them flush against each other. Their stiff members trapped between their bodies, panting mouths only an inch apart. The increasing hum of pleasure radiating through his body caused John’s own eyelids to drop. Moaning, he captured Sherlock’s lips in a kiss.
"It's not that I don't want to, John." he finally managed to get out.
“It’s not, Sherlock. You didn’t know me at that time.” He picked the mute phone up from their knees, parted his to shuffle a bit closer. His inner thighs pressed against Sherlock’s legs, he was able to reach higher. He pushed the phone into Sherlock’s one unoccupied hand and reached up to place his hands on his hips. He pushed his thumbs through the pointless belt loops. Why bother with belt loops on bespoke trousers? Sherlock never wears any belts! And for a moment John wondered why he knew this. He tugged slightly on the loops to underline the gravity of his next words.
But there
“Promise!” John held two fingers up, grinned.
, he thought.
“You weren't supposed to be like that.” Sherlock said insistently. “I was furious; why would you be like that?”
He had never been to Greg's new home. Greg was a bit closed off about everything concerning his private life, but John assumed that probably was a totally normal reaction after a recent divorce. Especially because Greg's daughter was also involved and Greg has always felt guilty about spending too little time at home and working unpredictable hours. It was to be expected Greg would feel self conscious about his current situation and wouldn't share much about it.
“Of course, John…” Sherlock said humbly but couldn’t quite hide his smirk.
“What technique?” John asked, confused.
!!! They pull me through, they believed in me and this story. They are my greatest cheerleaders and my muses. Thank you, darlings! I wouldn't know what to do without you.
Sherlock was on fire. He was burning, too.
…" he playfully lowered his eyes and blinked his lashes at John, although the look he gave him was anything but innocent. Same as the foot now traveling past the crook of John's knee.
"Then bear with me, okay?"
? You really took your time.”
Arms flying, legs snapping, head turning.
“You have a point there,” Scott mumbled. And after a short moment, “John…”
"You… love… my… crinkle thingy?"
Confronted with Sherlock on his hands and knees, wiggling his back side in front of his face, he gave up all hope of this to be any easier. He took a deep breath and succumbed to his fate. The same ordeal of skin on skin combined with the slick and slide, the heat and shivers was as much a torture and challenge to their restraint as before. The sizzling tension sparking in their touch heightened by the not yet removed hairs prickling the over-sensitive soft skin of John's palms.
“I could come visit you at work or pretend to be a new co-worker." Sherlock suggested, voice smooth and sultry, trailing his nose along the side of John's neck, making him shiver. "There're nice attires for male nurses, too… although, you know now—I'm quite good at pretending to be a woman!”
Neither of them moved, the moment frozen in time. When finally, Sherlock took in a shuddering breath, John woke from his trance. Sherlock lingered a moment. A warm thumb stroked lightly like a feather over Johns knuckles and with that the detective let go of John's hand, turned and hurried away. His long coat billowing behind him. Curls in disarray where the cold breeze tore at them.
Mingling memories.
*****
“Well… at least… I saw you texting… and that email today… that was him… no? Are you not?” Greg threw John a worried look, seemingly afraid that he had overstepped in any way.
“May I ask what caused this sudden determination of yours?”, Mycroft dared to question.
“What time did I get home?” John asked. “I can’t remember…”
"Uhm...okay then," the other man cleared his throat as well. "Are you sitting comfortably? Or lying down? Or whatever one does in this sort of situation?"
“When did you arrange all that?” John asked, baffled.
Sherlock was out of breath as if he had run a marathon. He had rushed through the messages that fast, he was afraid he had missed half of it. He went over them again. And again. Mind distracted at a different point with each new re-read. But mostly, mainly, his eyes were glued to the one message.
"I... don't know…" a rough, dark, hoarse voice mumbled in his ear after a moment. "I guess, I was angry."
"Sherlock…," he gasped.
Nevertheless, John was right. He was always right. Sherlock knew nothing. But he had tried. Nobody can say he hadn't tried...
And again, again, he hoped this would be the last time. Never again.
"..."
“So, are you erect enough to proceed?” Impatience seeping into the voice.
“Oh Sherlock, you’re up!” She said with a hint of relief in her voice, clasping her hands in front of her purple dress.
“Yeah, of course…” John laughed. Who was this man? Sure as hell he was
“Checked the back door, boss.” One of the guys slurred, apparently equipped with the brain of a mayfly.
His memories drifted back to the first time he had been here. A totally different occasion; but causing similar confusion. He had followed hot on John’s heels, who had back then left in probably the same mood as he himself had been in today. In the end, John was taken here to meet up with someone who technically should have been dead, too. What a very fitting choice Sherlock had made to make this location his place to be, back from the dead.
After noting his current location, he mapped out in his mind the quickest way to get to his destination and hurried to get there; it was still quite a distance to walk.
“You know what is childish, Sherlock? Using up all our shaving foam to marinade human lungs with it!”
"What's that supposed to mean?"
John watched in awe, hovering at the rim of the shadows. Shifting where he stood, hands nervously fidgeting on his hips, eager to let himself be known. He didn’t want to push Sherlock though, to force him. John wanted to get it right this time. He had to choose the right moment. So he waited. And watched. And marveled at the magnificent mystery that was Sherlock. He was constantly shifting between fire and water, between burning and drowning, between vigour and tranquility, between dare and retreat, between forwards and backwards.
"Not sure this time," John had responded, but there had been no more messages. And that had been it. He had been left alone to struggle through it. Not totally alone though… there had been Mrs Hudson of course who had done her utmost best to provide him with food and company. And Sarah and Mike to supply more i.v. fluids, special nourishment and supplements to refill all the empty depots in Sherlock's tormented body. And just when the improvement of his friend's state had made his heart lighter, a sadness had weighed it down again. Because now the moment he had to say goodbye again would come soon. He had prepared everything so that he wouldn't be necessary any more for the time when Sherlock wouldn't want him around any longer. And now… now that moment had arrived. Mrs Hudson had confirmed it. He was his former self again. And that former self hadn't wanted John at 221b.
He stared at it. This sounded frighteningly familiar. Almost too much to be a coincidence. But this can’t be what John had meant. Why would he go back there? There was nothing to talk about after all this time. And more importantly, it had never been John’s responsibility to save his life in the first place. Neither during the operation, nor afterwards, nor before it had even happened. He did save him though. John was the only reason Sherlock was still alive! Not medical skills of the doctors, not a surgery-shot of the woman known as Mary. Only John had been motivation enough to fight back to life. But that was something the man himself didn’t know and never needed to know. Not ever. This article had to be a coincidence… He decided not to dwell on it and quickly went back to his search and kept on scrolling.
Sherlock  looked up and watched John silently with tender eyes, caressing his face with his gaze.
After he calmed his breath, he looked at Mycroft and tried to keep his expression indifferent. They regarded each other quietly for a moment and then continued their meal without talking. They finished dinner without talking. They had coffee without talking. Everything was said. All there was left to do was wait. Sherlock pushed back his chair to stand up when his phone once again came to life. No violin though. Just ordinary beeping. Sherlock furrowed his brow. Not John. Why not John? Why was that important anyway? He fished his phone out of his pocket and unlocked the screen hesitantly.
"John," he drew his eyebrows together. "You said 'no more songs'?" Actually it was a fact but the confusion turned it into a question.
' and nothing beyond that. What am I supposed to think?"
“I think this can work, Sherlock. What are you afraid of?” John squeezed his hand, which he was still holding firmly. Sherlock’s heart raced, his mind whirled. John knew... John had seen right through him. Sherlock felt his hand palms getting sweaty, trepidation made him jittery.
He let his fingers slide up and down the sweaty crease of Sherlock's arse until his middle finger rested over his entrance. By now, Sherlock had abandoned all words, his panting peppered with grunts and needy little sounds. John increased the pressure on Sherlock’s rim, rubbing his fingertip over it as good as he was able to with Sherlock’s now erratic movements. The man faltered in his rhythm; the skin underneath John’s hands damp from the sweat elicited by desperation of feeling the release within reach but not being there just yet. Sherlock silently started murmuring again and John realised it was a chant of begging ‘please please please’. His jaw began to ache, saliva coated his chin and he was afraid his dick would suffer severe damage if this took any longer. His fingers moistened from the droplets of sweat gathering between Sherlock’s arse cheeks, John dared to push his finger firmer against Sherlock’s entrance until the muscles gave way and he dipped his fingertip in. Sherlock cried out in pleasure but seemed to linger on the verge of coming, not quite able to let go yet. Without feeling any resistance, John slid his finger deeper, never faltering in his ministrations to Sherlock’s cock. His mind went foggy from feeling the same vibrations, which were pushed against the back of his throat by Sherlock’s dick, now buzzing under his searching digit. He let his finger slide against the smooth and hot tissue, pushed as far as he needed to crook his finger and pushed down the moment he felt the small nub of Sherlock's prostate underneath his fingertip.
echoed in John's head, thrumming in his every cell, shaking him to the core.
It would probably be better not to engage in any kind of social interaction at all. His face was too well known and metropolitan London was just as bad regarding gossip and tattle as every little countryside village. Someone would spot him and would tell someone who knew someone who would ... maybe tell John. No. Wouldn't take that risk. He couldn't risk to be seen, he couldn't risk to leave the house. Even if this meant no more cases, no more cases ever again. Even if this meant not to be able to go to Battersea, although he'd need that now more than ever. But then, he'd also not be able to indulge in any other way to clear his mind, to distract his thoughts. He'd just have to deal with it. With everything. Alone.
“... getting better and better…” Scott mumbled on the other end and John wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hear that. A bit louder but still restrained Scott said, “There’s always something… So, an army doctor then...”
Without the immediate option to process his emotions and pour them into dance he felt trapped within himself, pacing like a panther behind bars in his own mind. His skin felt prickly, he became over-sensitive for every sensation, every impression, every stimulus around him. He recognised the tells
Both men on the sofa jumped. They had totally forgotten about the presence of another person, too engulfed in the moment.
John wasn't able to hold it back any longer. He snorted, almost choked on his tea.

move backwards. No option. Not happening.
Sherlock watched him for a moment. John mirrored his silent contemplation even though he was convinced they saw different things—apart from the obvious of course. He just couldn’t grasp what. Or why.
He felt a drop of sweat run down his temple, following a path next to his earlobe along his jaw and down his throat to pool in the small hollow above his collarbone. The slight tickling send a shiver down his spine, his skin being over-sensitive sending high-voltage through his synapses. He didn’t allow it to distract him. He had to be in charge, controlled, shielded.
!!!  It wasn’t me! I just copied and pasted! I didn’t actually check it out, but if you do let me know how it went! *wink wink*
“I won’t give up!” John insisted.
On my way!
John tried to swallow but couldn’t; his accelerated breathing had left his mouth dry and his racing heart made it impossible to just breathe through his nose; as if he had just run a marathon.
John huffed amused.
“You don’t like not shaving.” Sherlock tried.
"I think it's a wonderful inspiration for the next drag dress…" He pressed his lips together to hide his grin without success.
“Dull.” was the clipped answer. “Not my area of expertise anyway.”
Well, that didn't help any further though. There was no background information as to why John couldn't sleep. In his current state, did he even know why?
to have around.” At this point Sherlock’s brow furrowed and John couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “For saving my poor arse once and again, for coming back to me.” He swallowed hard. “For giving me a second chance.” The sudden understanding of the magnitude of his own gratitude felt like a punch in the gut and he had to pause to get back on track.
“And I told you, I never felt this way for anyone either.” John slowed his steps until they stopped. Sherlock realised that they had almost reached Baker Street. When had that happened? Now though, they stood still and John was looking down, away from him. He sounded anxious when he asked, “What’s the point of all this, Sherlock?” He looked up now, his eyes pleadingly searching Sherlock’s face for answers.
Thunderstruck, John stood rooted into place. He tried to grasp what had just happened. John was quite certain that he hadn’t been the only one who had felt the gravity of the moment. Who had felt the pull towards each other. The almost… something. Why then did Sherlock leave? Wait... did John
The man in his grasp squirmed but—to John’s immense irritation—didn’t seem to be intimidated in the slightest.
hours maybe or not even that
Sherlock scrolled down to the inevitable lyrics. At first he didn’t even bother to listen to it, because the moment he read the first line he knew this was it. This was what he had been searching for, what John had meant… ‘do you by any chance know how to save a life’... not how to save lives then, but ‘How To Save a Live’...
Swallow. Shaky inhale. Eyes closed.
He didn't even try to stay calm. Being sure this time that John would come to see him felt even worse than yesterday when it had all still been unsure, insecure, in a fog of possibilities and probabilities and wishes and fears and hopes. This was different, this was definite. A fact. The emotions accompanying it crystal clear like a droplet of morning dew, like the sun through the crisp air of an early winter morning. Like looked at through his magnifying glass. This felt like meeting John at 7pm on the 30th of January 2010 at Baker Street all over again. This was like asking
Now he knew, did it change anything? Apart from making his own misery even worse? Now he knew what was on offer, what he had to reject? This wasn't about a convenient and additionally comfortable flat-share anymore. Not just about a friendship. Not even about a best friendship at that. No, he had to reject the one thing he wanted most in the world. The person he wanted most. John.
John huffed out a relieved laugh. It was him. His Scott! Well, his… Not
"You have to unwrap it to be able to thank me. You can't know yet if you like it."
The fragile but very lively woman jolted back and stared at him, wide eyed.
He had to actually, truly and really talk to Sherlock - in real life!
Sherlock called himself back to attention. No use to dwell on thoughts of John in fatigues. He had more urgent problems to solve.
He didn't realise how the day went by. Mrs Hudson walking in and out of the sitting room just side-eyed him worriedly. She had long stopped talking after the first few attempts to engage Sherlock into a conversation without getting any reaction from the man whatsoever.
" John sighed. "That's the required and obligatory protection gear during a fucking pandemic!  Most of all in cases of unknown cause of death. And
He believed in Sherlock Holmes! He always had! But Sherlock wouldn’t let him, and that John didn’t understand. Didn’t Sherlock care anymore? Had John become a burden for Sherlock as  he had always feared to be? Sherlock had always denied it, even though John never had seen the use of his own presence at that brilliant man's side. Sherlock had already known everything John could add to the observations anyway. So why bother? Maybe… maybe this was it. This was the moment John had always feared but expected. The moment Sherlock got bored of him. Sherlock denied it though, but John had always just been the idiot after all. Sherlock kept calling John his conductor of light. But what did that even mean? But who could tell about Sherlock Holmes? John couldn’t anymore. After today he realised that maybe he had never really known Sherlock after all.
Silence fell again. Charged, but promising. Tense, but cosy.
"Come here, you," John said, voice low and sultry, circling Sherlock's waist with one arm and pulling him very suggestively closer.
are still fully dressed.” It sounded like an honest accusation. He was right though and suddenly John couldn’t stand it a single moment longer. “Can I at least open your flies?” Scott begged, as if it would be the greatest honour to be granted that permission.
"Not what people usually say." Was there a tint of surprise?
made for my story! I'm still completely blown away that she spent her precious time and wonderful talent to draw this beauty for me!! Thank you again, darling 💕
"I can imagine." John reluctantly said but couldn't help but add, "Fascinating. Yeah, quite...extraordinary, really."
!!!” John screamed, leaning on Sherlock’s wobbling chest, unable to hold himself up from laughter. “You’re never ever again allowed to make puns!! Oh God, I…” He didn’t get any further as a new wave of giggles took over until tears fell from his eyes again—this time from happiness and relief and love.
She reached him and without hesitation slid her hand into the hair at his nape and pulled hard so that he had to bend his neck and look up at the gorgeous creature hovering above him.
That was an innocent question, wasn't it? If John would remember their conversation on the phone he'd probably mention it.
There was a brief pause.
"Dissociation, Sherlock. Did you ever experience that before?"
Sherlock was standing there, head leant back, breathing slowly, chest expanding with each inhale. He looked otherworldly, ethereal. And so different from the pained and desperate creature he had seemed to be the last time John had witnessed this spectacle.
Slowly but steadily he walked over to his chair, grabbed his laptop and flipped it open. Watching the screen lighten, he cautiously placed his fingers on the keyboard and started typing.
“I’ve probably seen that movie a hundred times. I don’t know, stopped counting. It’s embarrassing really…” John cleared his throat to get rid of the lump that made his voice sound thick. He was grateful that Sherlock just listened, eyes shortly flicking up to his, otherwise concentrating on his task.
“Molly? Molly Hooper?” Greg’s eyes lit up. He hurried to catch up with John.
“Look at youuuuu, Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson fussed. “Ooohh, so lovely, your pirate is back! I already wondered how long until you’d miss it. You're gorgeous! He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” She now addressed John.
unavoidable. I couldn’t risk breaking you, in whichever way.” His breathing became ragged, John saw that he had difficulties to maintain composure. He tightened his hold on Sherlock’s waist as if he could hold him together somehow.
“Exactly, John. We have to do some shopping at the pharmacy tomorrow. And afterwards, you will have the honour of helping me.”
No immediate response. That was okay. Maybe John had to let this sink in for a moment. Maybe he just now realised how it all made sense. Probably he'd come around now and thank Sherlock for his help in just a few moments.
, huh? That you’re a bloody rotting potato without him and that he isn’t any better. Maybe remind him how he was before he met you? That you’re both … without each other... not even half the man of who you are, when you’re together? Yeah, I could think of a thing or two to say!” Greg was now getting seriously angry. “Goddamn, John. Does he even know you love him?”
He swallowed, pressed the back of his hand against his slightly parted lips. He felt silly. He felt pathetic, hopelessly yearning, when he inhaled shakily, trying to collect and assimilate any trace Sherlock’s touch might have left behind. The thought alone of tiny fragments of Sherlock entering his body, coursing through his system made John’s head swim. Involuntarily, his tongue darted out to gather more of the man he longed for and the tip brushed against his skin. The contradictory feeling of the joltingly intense warm and wet touch on the otherwise insensitive back of his hand, heightened the feeling of dividedness, of being split in two. The slightly salty taste in his tongue faded and he wanted to chase it, if it meant to taste the faintest bit of Sherlock. In a twisted way of envisaging, he wanted to taste Sherlock's thumb, the one that had stroked John's hand. See if there, too, would linger a hint of John for Sherlock to take with him. He let his own thumb take over the wiping caress of his mouth. The tip of his tongue resting on his lower lips, catching a bit of the intense taste of the pad of the digit each time it brushed by.
So. There. He said it.
Dear everyone,
“I just mean, it’s good to know that you have somewhere to go.” He felt small and pathetic, pitying himself.

(See the end of the chapter for
That should be pretty reassuring. Facts are always good. At least for Sherlock. But then, John wasn't Sherlock. John was much more sentimental. Probably he needed social and emotional reassurance as well.
“No socks?”
“Well — that might be true...” he sounded pleased. “Anyway... where were we? Oh, yes...”
he scolded himself, rolling his eyes internally.
"Quite." Was the thunderstruck but euphoric response.
John thought he'd die of suffocation due to excessive laughter. His abs started to hurt and he ended up having a hick up.
Well, he didn’t want to talk anyway. What he needed was a shower, bedroom, doors closed, world locked out, mind-palace. As always. It was only to hope that John would keep it at least a bit quiet. Sherlock wasn’t able to stand any more input today.
The boys will experience their very own rollercoaster ride. They will take you along, so fasten your seat belts and have fun! Off you pop... 😈😇🥰
, John thought sourly.
"Right," the other man said after a short moment in which he scrutinised John until he felt stripped naked. He only hoped he had passed the test. "Any other chicks I have to keep my hands off?" the man asked all business but not without an undertone conveying his hostility.
Sherlock settled on the lawn, leaned against a tree and closed the eyes to send some air into his lungs and then out again into the world for the wind to drag it away. After several minutes he opened his eyes again and looked up at the sky. Some ragged dark clouds shifting over the sparkled surface, just fraily holding back the moon in it’s attempt to penetrate the gloom of the night. He realised that he sporadically recognised constellations of some stars. He winced at himself, but couldn’t stop staring. The longer he watched them, the more he found. He wondered how the night sky would look like at the new place. Would he even recognise any star there? Would he see the same sky as people in Britain? Or France that is, of course. And actually also any other country in Europe.
"Just about myself. Never anything about you."
"How very poetic, Miss Lamentory." he chuckled.
"There're people out there looking for me." Sherlock snarled and John froze. Had Sherlock spotted him? If he had, would the others have as well? Apparently not, he thought hearing those next words. However, they weren't a relief nonetheless.
John cursed. Fucking hell, she couldn’t be serious. This couldn’t be real. He pushed himself through the whooping and cheering mass of visitors of the club, bumping against them in the dark, not caring for the enraged muttering he caused on his way. This absolutely stupid silly insane foolish moron of a Pirate. What was she thinking. Jesus Fucking Christ on a Cracker. Dammit!
“Yep,” Sherlock only said, popping the ‘p’ as he loved to do, “becoming Miss Pirate again!” and his eyes gleamed. John saw his suspicion confirmed that The Pirate was more than just a disguise for Sherlock.
again. Thrilling, frightening, overwhelming. Not sure what the outcome would be.
This… this was almost unbearable. No—not almost. It
Now, that threw John’s mind completely off the rails—the combination of cuffs and saber, the first around Sherlock’s wrists, the second in his own hands, running the sharp tip along soft inner thighs, rendering the man beneath him at his mercy, coerced into immobility due to the risk of injury. He would never,
Short, denims, plaid button down, neatly trimmed blond fringe shimmering golden in the incoming light.
'Within yourself and within your mind, let’s find peace there.'... This next snippet which Sherlock grabbed out of the air seemed to confirm his fears.
Disbelieving glare.
He realised only then, that he hadn't seen Miss Pirate leaving the stage during her performance, blessing the delighted audience with her company, since this dreadful case had started; even though it had been
“The moon?” Sherlock frowned, but the mirth was obvious in his suspiciously moist eyes. “I’m disappointed, John. Isn’t that the closest to earth celestial body there is? I was hoping you’d go deeper… into space, I mean! We might have to wait a day or two for other black hole excursions…”
That’s where he found himself now gazing at the ceiling as if he could magically stare down John’s phone or even better John himself.
that’s fantastic. But for this, why are you so scared to make use of…” He paused; thought. “Wait, that makes me think…”
*****
Greg seemed to know John better than he himself.
He almost forced it out, angry.
"Waiting for it to be tomorrow." John muttered tired.
They were still untouched when Greg said, already a bit slurring, “At least the two of you still talk to each other,” as if there hadn't been any break in their conversation.
“Maybe I should, huh?” Sherlock smiled at him conspiratorially.
The violin died. Voicemail announced. Sherlock grit his teeth.
A mix of emotions washed over Sherlock’s face
He looked thin, his skin pale, his posture hunched.
John thought. And then Sherlock bloody Holmes who had to return early - today of all days - and spy on his embarrassing breakdown.
." Sherlock grunted while simultaneously thrusting his hips forwards, shamelessly frotting his rock hard dick against John's lower back, forcing John's own groin against the door, mimicking Sherlock's movements. John moaned and closed his eyes. God, that man would be the death of him.
"My feet are freezing."
Suddenly his arms sagged down, same as his head which fell backwards, eyes closed again, sort of resigned and slack expression taking over his face, his lips slightly opened, puffing breaths.
"Mischievous. Combative without anger. Your eyes are twinkling in that very particular way."
Was it?
taken him to hospital and they would have run tests too, wouldn’t they? What would have happened then? He would have been furious. Mycroft wouldn't have thought twice about  sending him back to… but who am I kidding… he would have known anyway. And…," here John lowered his voice, nervously keeping an eye on Greg in the corner of his view. "And cases, Molly… he wouldn't have been allowed on cases anymore. And that's his everything, Molly. You know that. I couldn't do that to him. It would have been hell for him, it would have killed him. Well, and… you know… Mycroft knew and he didn't force me to bring him anywhere but … home.”
"However," the man rubbed his chin in mock contemplation, "I wonder how the news would be received that she's about to leave the country…"
She had reached over and covered one of his large hands with her small and fragile one, skin crinkled and dotted with aging spots. He had watched how her thumb painted tiny circles on his palm.
"What was I supposed to think? Especially after tonight's display of your… skills..." John asked helplessly.
and as always:
He made a show from pressing the button with more force than necessary while still holding Sherlock's gaze.
"Well, it was worth a try."
"If I understand this
but I assumed. Not much of a leap, is it? But thanks for confirming. You know… I'm not a complete moron. Sometimes even
“John wouldn’t leave your side the whole time.” She took a step into the flat and Sherlock’s widening eyes snapped back to her.
"Yessss...pleeeaaase…"
With a trembling hand and the unshakable suspicion that he shouldn’t, he reached for the knife. It needed more force to pull it out than he had expected and when he did, the envelope tumbled to the floor with a surprising clatter.
"You damn well know, we have to.
They settled on the roof terrace under a sun sail Greg had installed. Lying on the deck chairs, sipping their beer, they enjoyed a companionable silence. The temperature was much more bearable up here, John started to relax. He let his thoughts wander and suddenly frowned. He turned his head to look at his friend.
He had purchased it after the one time they had ended up surrounded by trees, no street and no civilisation in sight in a goddamn place in the wilderness behind the boundaries of urban life. They'd had no fucking idea where they were. It had happened after chasing one or another criminal by foot. And of course, both their phones had run out of battery and there had been no way to contact anyone. It had been nerve wracking, especially with a sulking Consulting Detective at his heels.
waiting. He had even put away his clothes at some point.
"Chilli? Now?"
Suddenly, Sherlock's entire attitude changed, as if a switch was flipped. He leaned forward, caged John's shoulders in with his hands and lowered his face to John's; just short of lips touching lips, their gazes linked.
“You didn't know me before either.” John shrugged.
have a life outside of... calling you.”
“Just… don’t disappear on me, yeah?” He winked at Sherlock.
He started to run. Metres, centimetres? He didn't care.
His heart threatening to jump right out of his chest he held the envelope and looked at Mycroft, let him see, let him know. He needed the man to understand what this meant to him. When Mycroft gave him a small nod he knew the message was received.
“Right, your ‘genitals’,” he chuckled, unaware of the frown and suspicious look from the woman across from him, who chose to change seats that instant. “We
“I’m… I’m scared, John.” he whispered. “I’m so scared to do it wrong.”
"..."
One corner of his mouth pulled up into an impish smirk, John murmured the next lines; his voice gone low and a bit rough and like a Pavlovian reaction Sherlock's heartbeat sped up a notch.
Sherlock’s hand hovered above the phone for a second, didn’t withdraw. Then, gingerly, in slow motion, it moved up next to John’s forearm still propped up on his elbow, made cautiously contact half way, brushed gently over the thin material of John's shirt, made it slide against his skin. The sensation sent a jolt through John’s synapses, magnified as if his nervous system was on hyper-focus. Which it probably was. High tension, anticipation, hope, yearning making him over-sensitive. Most of all, it was the first touch initiated by Sherlock.
"No," he still laughed, "I mean... Yes, lube. No — no cock-chafing kink here..."
“John… I… god...” Sherlock gasped between breaths.
Sherlock was lying in his bed and gritting his teeth.
God forbid, no! I'll give you something different but not a list.
"Yes! Indeed!"
“For this one, I have to be a pirate!” He exclaimed, as excited as a child.
"You're just getting that
“So, tell me! What is it? I vaguely remember something about ‘belonging to yourself’? What did you mean?” John sensed that this might not be the most comfortable conversation for him, but he wanted to understand. He had obviously—no, definitely—hurt Sherlock. He didn’t want it to happen again.
gets too much
His mind, providing pictures of Sherlock's face, so close, eyes staring into John, so intense, was fogged, his senses heightened. The mental image of Sherlock being here, with him, made his breath come faster, sharper; the inevitable increase of warm air wafting over his hand, stirring the fine hairs on the back of it, raising goosebumps, caused a never-ending circle of accumulating sensitivity.
We wanted to thank you somehow, as it obviously all “worked out” between us. He says I don’t need to be so posh here, but I have appearances to keep up as the genius detective amidst this community after all. If you feel amenable to follow me, I’m running a regularly updated blog now. The content on my blog will meet the highest standards and I don’t know why John is laughing while I’m typing this. Anyway, you can expect to see my name among your followers. You seem to be not as much an idiot as most people.
“Hm? What was about what?” Scott asked and John could literally hear his frown through the void.
“Yeah… I can see
"We aren't?"
"I swear, I'll always be there for you. Always."
“Please…” John groaned, already fumbling with his belt.
Sending you lots of love and WELCOME!!! *chanting ‘one of us, one of us, one of us’!!!* <3<3<3
“What is it then… can't be that much worse, can it?”
"Oh, but I already have." The hateful sleek voice of the just as much sleek and hateful man it belonged to sounded from somewhere within the dark.
John coughed.
“So, a Captain it is then?” The pirate continued when John didn't speak.
Sherlock started to make his way to the exit, nearly knocking his cup of tea over. "If you insist on wasting my time, I have no intention to…"
John had corrected his own thoughts.
know that you have to use words for that, yeah?” John teased lightly.
"But women don't do drag, right? I mean people born with female genitals… jeez why is this so difficult…"
“You haven’t been there to rescue…
"Oh, I fully intend to, sweetheart, I really do.” The man in the dark laughed lunatically. “But will

“It’s just…” Sherlock started, apparently still hesitant. “Well, you’ve not been particularly… sympathetic towards my past. I wasn’t sure you’d be willing to broach that subject again.” Sherlock cleared his throat, tensing up in John’s arms.
A few days later…
All this confusing sentiment.
He wasn't sure who had let out the sigh, probably he himself, maybe both of them, but it was the expression of everything that clicked into place right this moment. His hand had found its way into John's hair, his fingers sliding through somewhat longer than usual strands. One of John's hands was cradling the back of Sherlock's head, the other loosely holding his nape.
he wanted to say. But how childish was that? Sherlock would huff.
"No. Being all fate and reasonless."
John just stared in disbelief, blushing fiercely. This couldn’t happen. This was not how he had imagined talking to Sherlock about something like….this. ‘Wait’ he stopped his own thoughts ‘did I really imagine talking about this? With Sherlock?’ His blush even deepened. And what to say now anyway? ‘No, I don’t enjoy it?’ Then why eat it? ‘Yes, I do!’ No way! To that question? Far too much innuendo!! That Sherlock was even capable of innuendo… holy shit! This was meant to be just a snack!! John’s thoughts whirled as even the word “snack” got filthy in his mind. He couldn’t think straight anymore! He snorted at this. Ha, straight, it got worse with every second! This had to stop! Sherlock turned around at John snorting and John could see him taking in his flushed face and embarrassed look, a gleam of mischief in his eyes.
With a sigh John dropped his gun on the table along with the cloth he was using to polish it. For more than two months now this was his daily routine; ever since he moved into this colourless, meaningless, depressing bedsit. Since he had come back from his deployment, invalided and useless, nothing ever happened to him.
Sherlock closed his eyes, tried to breathe slowly and deeply. He was scared, he was frightened, he was absolutely terrified.
"I certainly hope not!" Sherlock said sincerely and in a rush of warmth flooding his stomach John had to press his lips on his detective's skin again; on his shoulder, on his nape, on his cheek, on his temple; until he reached the corner of his mouth and Sherlock tilted his head a bit so that, in an awkward angle but still, John could steal a kiss from that tempting mouth.
A sudden inhale of breath and his eyes snapped open. He blinked, the darkness unexpected.
And he himself, he definitely shouldn't look at the end of his path. Even taking step for step, breath for breath he felt anxious still, actually more anxious with each step taken. He was doubting if he even wanted to get to the end of the road. But he forced himself forward. He had to face John, he had to reassure him, he had to tell him that it is what it is.
something… someone, not leaving because of something. John had thought Sherlock had a new purpose, something… someone to look forward to, something to gain. What was it that he wanted to ignore, to numb? To run from? After all, Sherlock left his whole life behind. But John couldn't help the feeling that the one thing Sherlock was leaving behind above all was John himself…
Hadn’t John tried to defuse all those concerns hard enough? Hadn’t he been clear enough about his own intentions? Apparently he hadn’t been convincing. John wouldn’t stop trying. He’d do everything for this man. What was it Sherlock needed from him though. He couldn’t give him more than everything he was.
Molly sensed his hesitation on the last said word and frowned at him. “Is... everything alright now, John?”
“And most of all…” Sherlock murmured in John’s ear, “I need to compile a list and fill in a spreadsheet about the different effects it has on… people.” Sherlock’s lips grazed John’s ear and a shiver spread down his back. “Purely scientific, of course. And there are so many possible combinations of the different eyeliners with the mascaras… I’m afraid it will take a while…” he rumbled, kissing down John’s neck, nuzzling his beard along his jaw, humming approvingly.
“You have?” Sherlock’s eyes widened, although not in shock or surprise John realised. No, it was something akin to wonder. Recognition even?
Taking Sherlock? John saw red—he darted the last steps forward and flung himself on the man’s back. Slinging his right arm around his throat he held him in a vice-like grip, pressing his gun against his head with the other hand.
Hidden underneath that indecent, tempting and very feminine leather skirt was a rock hard cock pressed against his groin, grinding through the layers of fabric, through worn denim and thin lace.
Worth the victims?
Greyish-green eyes resting on him. Unsettling. Grounding. Waiting.
He remembered very well that one occasion at Buckingham Palace; the one time John had even gotten a glimpse of something he hadn’t quite dared to think about.
The still urgent angst and need to be enough couldn't be left unanswered by actual words though. Sherlock had to understand. It wasn't about proving themselves to each other anymore; it was about being together, about doing it together.
-fuck-with-me’-vibes as well.” John could feel the vibrations of Sherlock’s silent laughter under his hands and joined in. “You really can’t blame me!”
“Scott?” John shouted harder than necessary. Just in time. He didn’t want to imagine! Well, yes, he did, he was calling a sex hotline to fuel his imagination after all.
When Sherlock was left in only his tight black boxer briefs and his white dress shirt, which he started to unbutton, the sleeves already rolled up, John gave up and resigned to his fate. He sagged back against the pillar, seeking at least some kind of support and sighed. He immediately slammed a hand over his mouth, afraid his noisy breath would make Sherlock aware of him after all, but apparently Sherlock was lost in thought, too deep in his own mind to realise anything suspicious. John sighed again in relief and slammed his hand back, wincing about his own stupidity. Well, in his defence, how was he supposed to form any coherent thought. How??
What? Sherlock frowned.
“Same thing.” Sherlock just waved it off and flopped on one of the chairs at their table in the living room. Immediately, he opened the laptop and got to work looking up his mail.
reverberated through Sherlock’s mind.
“That’s rubbish, Sherlock.” John interfered. “You always did. What about Mrs Hudson, Greg, your homeless people, your parents. Yeah, even Mycroft? What about them? You knew them all long before me.”
The call had already ended, but there was a message coming in and John fetched the device from the upstairs bedroom where he had apparently thrown it onto the bed at some point.

He woke with a groan.
He was pale as if all his blood was drained out of him, he looked as if struck by lightning. This sight was even worse than the one before, right after their argument, just before Sherlock had fled to get away from the situation, from John – once again – they hadn’t been able to solve it. Now there was a pain in Sherlock’s creased eyebrows John hadn’t seen before. He looked defeated, shattered. A vulnerability in his eyes that John felt physically. John’s heart ached at the sight, he felt a knot forming in his stomach. Sherlock gazed at him, lips slightly parted as if to say something, but only drew in a shuddering breath.
He heard the legs of John’s chair screech over the floor, a hesitant step. Then one more.
Hearing those words, the promise of everything that was to come, made a jolt of desire pulse through Sherlock's system, clouding his mind.
"I have
Only, the John Watson he knew wouldn't just stop doing something he was passionate about. He would never give up being a doctor. Unless… for severe reasons. There wasn't much Sherlock could imagine to be severe enough to stop John Watson, the most stubborn person on this planet, doing something he
“Greeeeeg…,” John whinged, “not funny!”
His mouth occupied, his mind too dizzy to form words, John went back to humming, his mouth against Sherlock's, sending tingling vibrations through both their lips, exaggerated by the water pulling the sensation along down their skin.
After a while, new hope. "What about Molly?". After all, Molly was the one who had helped Sherlock the last time he had vanished. Maybe she knew a way to contact him, a place to find him. Something John didn’t know about… after all, it seemed it was a lot more he didn’t know about Sherlock than he had ever anticipated. But no, Molly, too, was only shaking her head, denying any involvement. John couldn’t trust her entirely though. Not after the last time. But she kept assuring him that she really honestly would swear by her own life that she wasn’t involved this time. If not Molly, if not Greg, if not Mrs Hudson, if not John himself… who would be? Nobody. Sherlock was on his own this time. And that made John’s heart clench even more painfully. He should be there with him. If Sherlock would only trust him. If Sherlock would only let him in. But Sherlock didn’t… trust him. Sherlock didn’t want John to know. Didn’t want anyone to know. Sherlock wanted to be left alone. And who was John to disrespect and violate such a clear request? In the end, he was no-one.
