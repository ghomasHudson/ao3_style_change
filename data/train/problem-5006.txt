“Hey there Claire bear,” Cas crouches down to pull his daughter more into his arms and closes his eyes in contentment. Dean watches the pair with a soft smile on his face. He remembers it took a while for Claire to warm up to the move, but once she did Cas’ relationship with her got stronger. Dean has a feeling that it has something to do with the personal problems Cas hasn’t mentioned much about. Cas told him that Emma has been a huge help too, which made Dean’s chest swell with pride.
Now he stands on the corner across from the school with his daughter at his side practically jumping up and down. Dean takes a deep breath, looks both ways, grabs hold of Emma’s hand, and crosses the street. Ready to take on the next year with his daughter growing up all too quickly. They find the class lists posted on the front windows then make their way to the correct classroom. Dean made the mistake a few years ago of not checking the list beforehand and getting lost in the halls before one of the staff members took pity on him and showed them the right way. He is an absolute pro at this whole 'dropping his kid off on the first day of school' thing. At least that's what he tells himself so he doesn’t break down in the middle of the hallway saying goodbye to his precious little girl.
Dean glances over at Castiel and takes in the pristine white button-down and pressed slacks paired with his typical blue tie, which is never tied correctly, today is no different. One would think the guy was going to a very important meeting, not sitting on a plane for a couple hours heading to a luxury resort in Colorado.
Dean feels himself melt into the kiss and presses closer to Castiel wanting,
To distract himself further from his impending doom of falling out of the sky Dean takes out his old, seriously this thing is ancient, football video game. He plays the game ignoring the continuous beeping and the annoyed glances from his coworker.
Without a second's thought Dean gets up and moves to the other side of the small table to sit next to Claire on the bench seat. He can see barely there tear tracks running down her cheeks. Reaching out a hand he gently wipes the tears away with his thumb and studies her face. The pain and anger and betrayal are all clearly written, but he can also pick up hints of defeat and acceptance in her eyes. That breaks his heart the most. Claire really thinks Cas is going to abandon her.
“Well, to be fair, we weren’t going to tell anybody,” Jo replies, looking at Benny for some guidance. He nods his head and Jo turns her attention back to Dean. “It started as just sex really, we were both drunk and well it just sorta happened. And then it happened again, and again, except sober. Eventually we realized we felt something for the other and decided to give this whole thing a go.”
Dean makes up his bed for the night, smiling slightly at the laughter coming from the bedroom. His friends are happy and he is happy for his friends. Benny deserves to find someone again and Dean knows Jo would be good for him. He's a little disappointed he didn't see it earlier or even think about setting the two of them up.
“We could do that.”
“Oh honey, you already missed that party,” Jo replies, smirking.
“Are you two gentlemen going to the festival tonight?” he asks.
“Hey girls, come see who's here!” Sam shouts into the house and suddenly footsteps can be heard rushing their way.
Arthur comes out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel and Castiel immediately averts his eyes. It feels wrong. Everything feels wrong. Without looking up, Cas gathers his stuff and locks himself into the bathroom. He takes several moments to just breathe. When he finally feels calmed down enough to function properly he turns on the water in the shower and steps into the scalding heat. It feels good on his skin and allows him to relax further. Castiel uses the time he has to think about the last 24 hours. The stress and panic of not finishing his article to the rush of feelings he had while dancing with Dean and the different wave of emotions when Ketch surprised him.
A little over half an hour later finds Castiel sitting at the bar talking to a smiling Ellen.
Spotting Benny, Dean calls him over.
“Mr. Dean, stop! You’re going to make me puma pants!” Another big exclaimed while pointing at the next habitat with two black pumas resting in it. That seemed to be the last straw for the kids because suddenly there were eight kids and one grown man (definitely not Castiel, that’s for sure) laughing out loud and clutching their sides. Eventually when the group starts to settle Dean gives both boys a high five thanking them for their role in his shenanigans. He then looks back at Cas with sparkling green eyes and Cas can’t even pretend to be mad or irritated with the man.
“Water!” he exclaims and laughs as three heads snap forward to look at the lake. “Em, we made it sweetie.”
With a frustrated huff Castiel shoves the book away. He removes his thick dark framed glasses and rubs at his eyes trying to get his headache to disappear. Normally he tries to avoid wearing his glasses but his contacts were irritating him earlier. Of course, that is the moment Dean chooses to come back to the inn. Castiel sees him pause in the entryway holding a to go coffee cup staring at him. So he stares back thankful he took off his glasses, he doesn’t need another thing Dean will make fun of him for.
“I’ll take the group with the parent volunteers,” Gabriel chimes in quickly, with a smirk on his lips, knowing exactly what is going on with Dean.
“Do you ever respond to any of these?” Dean asks curiously.
“What?!” Dean snaps and turns to find a shocked, and slightly offended, Charlie standing behind him.
“You do know it was just for fun right? It didn’t mean anything to either of us,” she explains. The way she says it seems like she thinks that will make it all better, but it just reminds him of what he can't have. “Look. Clarence was just really stressed with everything going on and I offered a solution. Because apparently you weren’t doing good enough of a job.”
The next several hours drag by. Dean feels like the pile of trash in the hotel is never ending, and the more they explore the more they find. Cas and Emma join them eventually, giving them a crew total of twelve, and they move a little quicker. By the time night falls and the local crew members have gone home they have the dining, lounge, entrance, and all of the actual hotel rooms cleared. Tomorrow they will have to do the kitchen and the basement. Which Dean is really really dreading. Tonight though, they get to retire to their brand new villa.
Claire finds divorce papers for her parents and runs away (to Dean). Dean takes her out for mini golf (yes this is the scene from the show...) and food. Eventually Claire opens up about why she ran away and how she is worried her dad is going to leave her. Dean explains the situation about how Claire's mother developed postpartum depression and depression after Claire was born which led to a drug addiction problem. Amelia's parents were the ones to encourage Cas for the divorce and to give them the responsibility of her care (rehab center). Claire is still welcome to visit her mother whenever she wants and Dean explains how Cas still loves Amelia, but is no longer in love with her (hint hint, he loves Dean). Anyways! That about it!
“Really? Boring and wordy?”
“I promise I will never call you Cassie, if that makes you feel any better.”
Dean sets the girls up to do their homework at the kitchen table while he takes a quick shower, washing away the day's dirt and sweat, before sitting down in his home office to get some paperwork done while he has the chance.
“Twins?” Dean asks.
Cas nods his head and tries to calm his breathing. His fists loosen their grip on his hair and Dean reaches up gently, his fingers curling around Cas’ and urging him to let go. When the other man does, Dean cards his fingers through the wild dark locks in a soothing manner, causing Cas to close his eyes and lean into the touch. Dean moves his hands down to cup Cas’ face between them and waits for Cas to open his eyes again. Bright blue filled with worry stares right back at him and Dean tries to hide his own feelings from his own eyes.
A sensation on his hand draws his attention and he opens his eyes he didn't realize were clenched shut and sees Castiel’s hand covering his own. Once he registers that his other senses come back online. Dean can start to make out quiet words next to him and he tries to focus on what the voice is saying.
“It wasn’t long before we moved here. I remember waking up and hearing them arguing and yelling at each other. I sat at the top of the stairs listening. I don’t remember much of what was said but I was so scared. I had never heard them like that before. Especially dad. He's so quiet and awkward half the time that it scared me to hear him yelling like that. I remember hearing something break, glass or something, and then a door slam. I rushed back to my room and climbed into bed. Then dad came up a few minutes later and I remember him sitting next to me and stroking my hair. I refused to look at him though, I didn't want him to see me crying, so I pretended I was asleep,” she explains with tears threatening to spill.
“I believe her name was Abigail,” Jesse replies. Amelia’s mother then. Makes sense since she was the one that booked their entire vacation for them. “She told us when the four of you would arrive and we thought we would greet you here, take you to get some food and show you around a little bit.”
“Cas?” Dean asks, surprised to hear his daughter’s friend's dad’s voice.
Once everyone knows what they’re doing, Dean leads Cas to the truck and they take off towards the small town by the docks. The two men are silent on the short drive to town and it's not their usual comfortable silence that Dean has come to love and cherish over the years. It breaks a piece of his heart not knowing if they can ever get that back. He knows the two of them need to talk and Dean knows it will go one of two ways. Either Cas returns his feelings and they can move forward in their relationship or he can lose Cas forever which would destroy Dean beyond repair. He would prefer the former to happen, but won't allow himself too much hope.
“You say that every year Dean and you never show,” Sam argues.
“I don't…” Castiel hesitates. This is everything he wanted. He frantically looks around for Dean hoping for some clarity in the other man but he’s nowhere to be seen.
“Me? No,” Cas replies without looking away from the window.
“I saw the papers.” Seeing Dean’s confused look, Claire takes a deep breath and continues. “I saw the divorce papers in my dad’s office this morning.”
“Good night Dean,” Cas’ soft voice breaks the silence, and entirely against his will Dean’s entire mind calms at just hearing those few words.
“Well Meg pointed out…” Cas starts.
“Coffee.”
“What should I know about your family?”
“Yeah I’m fine. Just trying to get comfortable,” Dean replies grumpily.
Taking a few minutes to get himself back under control, Castiel takes one last look at his festive apartment and goes through one of his breathing exercises. Once he feels calmer and is absolutely sure Ketch would be gone, he walks out his door and locks it behind him. His cab is waiting for him when he reaches the street, and then he’s off to the airport at last.
As simple of a word that it is, it sets off every one of Dean’s feelings and thoughts he has been desperately trying to hide for years now. Cas said we as if they were one family and Dean would give just about anything for that to be true. He knows it's unrealistic but apparently that is a very difficult concept for his brain to accept since he keeps daydreaming about what their lives would be like if they could actually be together. Honestly it wouldn’t change too much since they already spend so much time together but he also knows how much better everything would be if they could. The little things. That's what he wants.
And thank you SO MUCH to
Cas looks at the boy completely confused as to what he could mean. Do the cats dance? The kids start laughing and pointing at something to Cas’ left. When he turns to see what caught their attention he finds Dean dancing like a complete dork. Cas stares in complete shock at the spectacle in front of him. Dean goes from doing the robot to the running man to some other dance move that Cas finds a hard time even being real. He’s not sure how the teacher does it but even when he’s being a complete dork and should be entirely unattractive Dean still finds a way of being the most beautiful person Cas has ever seen. It really is not fair in the slightest.
The thought of Castiel sends a pang through Dean's heart. Cas made his choice and went back to New York with his ex. Dean is just going to have to accept that. He stayed up until three AM finishing up the article for them after finding the certificate. If he put that last line in there in hopes of possibly changing Cas’ mind well no one needs to know but him. For now, he is happy enough to spend Christmas with his family for the first time in over a decade.
Dean closes his eyes, bringing his hand up to rub at his forehead where he can feel a headache already growing. “Cas, this shower is already bigger than the one I have back at my house in the states, it does not need to be bigger.”
Instead he clears his throat. “Uh, personal space, Buddy?”
“Ohh believe me! Cassie is very into the male form, and very into yours specifically.”
Castiel has got to be going crazy right?
“Oh yes, one minute please!” Becky says before putting him on hold. Dean lets out a sigh of relief, thankful to be done talking with the receptionist. A few moments go by before the line goes through again and a familiar voice answers.
“Yes ma'am,” Dean replies automatically.
“Please tell me you’re not just sitting here reading about this place when you could be out there experiencing it?” Dean finally says walking into the cozy sitting room Castiel has been in for the last few hours.
Dean proceeds to split the groups up and assigns two parent volunteers with each group. To Castiel’s great pleasure all the kids seem to be on their best behavior this trip. The zoo gets a few other classes that come in for field trips and most of the time the kids don't want to be there and are rude to everyone that crosses their path. They have never had an issue with any of Dean’s classes though. If Cas wasn’t dreading the rest of the day then he might be more inclined to think that Dean was a decent human. Even when the man annoys him to no end, he can really tell the kids love having Dean as their teacher.
“Bye, Mr. Novak!” his students call as they exit the small classroom.
“Cas,” Dean leans forward so that their brows are resting together and brings his hands up to cup Cas’ face, needing to just feel the man in front of him for a minute. Cas’ hands reach up and settle on Dean’s hips, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles, causing Dean’s breath to hitch. “I love you so much I’m so sorry for everything. I love you. I love you. I love you.”
“Is that celery?” Dean asks affronted.
Knowing Charlie has the lobby and guests under control, Dean wanders through the rest of the main hotel block into the dining and bar area. Benny and Jo are behind the bar making sure everything is in order for their guests. They both send a quick wave in Dean’s direction as he continues walking through another large double door into the bright island sunshine.
Cas rolls his eyes at Ash’s intro for him, but stands up and makes his way to the stage anyway. There are a lot of cheers and wolf whistles that follow him to the stage which causes him to blush a little. He silently prays that people can’t tell too much because of the low lighting. When he reaches the stage, he finds Ash still standing there with a smirk on his face which is odd, usually the man goes back to his music station behind the stage. He sends a wink towards Cas before turning back to the crowd.
Dean lays his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, squeezing gently. “Cas, seriously, don’t worry about it. Here, I’ll give you my number so you can text me when you’re ready to pick Claire up and we can work out more details later. Just go take care of what you need to.”
Dean loves him?
“Claire honey?” he says gently to get her attention. “I promise you, your father will never leave you.”
, for making this actually readable and the encouragement I needed to finish this. Also I would not have known about the Western and Cowboy Museum without them.
“I made a fool out of myself last time with all of my lame animal jokes, he probably thinks I’m an idiot. We should just not go,” Dean replies with a sense of finality.
With the motivation of food Cas gets out of the car and follows Dean back into the inn. They find many of the guests still enjoying their dinners and they find an empty table near the back. It doesn’t take long for Carol to find them and bring out two plates full of delicious food. Even after eating a ton at Sam’s Castiel still finishes his plate. Dean excuses himself saying he's going to go work on his article up in the room which reminds Cas that he has more research to do.
“Dean? Did you hear what I just said?” His brother’s voice sounds through the room, scratchy due to the phone speaker.
“Sam, work is hectic this year,” Dean says, taking his brother off speaker as he walks out into the dimly lit apartment building hallway. His elderly neighbor two doors down waves at him and he blows her a kiss in response before locking his door. “I’ll be there next year, I promise. Besides, I’ll see you for the new year! You guys are still planning on flying over right?”
They spent almost two years renovating the hotel, transforming the abandoned dump into one of the most beautiful hotels Dean has ever seen. His opinion might be a little bit biased, but the hotel still turned out pretty damn awesome.
“Sure is! Missouri meet my little brother Sammy, his beautiful wife, Jess, and this sweet little monster is Mary,” Dean nods to each in turn, ignoring Sam’s mumbles about not being ‘Sammy’ anymore, and smiles as Mary giggles.
“He told me how disgusting it is to be with another man and that my mom would be so disappointed in me. That's the part that hurt the most you know? Using my mom against me like that. Said it was disrespectful to prance around holding another man’s hand on the anniversary of my moms death and around her favorite holiday. He kicked me out right then and there. All I had was my car and a duffle full of some clothes from my apartment. I didn’t even get to see Sammy that year.”
“Oh my, that is a bummer. Here, have a candy cane to make things a little better.”
“I know what I’m going to write about!” He exclaims excitedly.
“What would we do if we chose to stay here?” Emma asks eventually.
“May I ask a question?” Chirs asks, dragging Dean out of his thoughts. He nods his head, thankful for the interruption, and the older man continues. “Why are you here?”
“Breakfast time!” Sam calls from the kitchen.
“Again, don't know what you’re talking about,” he lies, trying to keep his anger and irritation down. If he even shows a hint of how much seeing her and Cas together affected him she will latch onto it like the leech she is and drain him until he is nothing more than a husk of a man in love with his best friend.
“She’s missing.”
Dean shoots a glare in Gabe’s direction hoping his anger comes off clearly. How dare he set this up without giving Cas any warning? What if Cas doesn’t even want to see Dean again, and then they just ambushed him tonight. Dean meets Cas’ gaze and lets out a defeated sigh. Honesty is probably the best option here.
“Cas.”
The air is cold and snow falls from the sky in soft white flakes covering the path in front of him. He really should've grabbed a jacket but the only thing he could think about at the time was getting the hell out of there. When he is finally confident enough time has gone by for Castiel to be gone Dean heads back into the inn. He bypasses the party and walks right up the stairs to his room. Dean stands frozen in the doorway taking in the sight before him. Cas’ bag is gone and there is no trace left of the man.
“There's a blonde chick here looking for you?”
By the time Cas is done, dinner is also done and Dean calls the girls back from the living room so they can eat. Dean plates up two smaller plates for the girls, placing them on the counter, which Cas then takes to the table while Dean does the next plate. He doesn’t even realize that he made Cas’ plate for him until there are two plates with pasta and chicken in front of him. After serving dinner for the girls so often he's just used to making the plates for everyone himself. Cas doesn’t mention it and just takes his plate to join the girls at the table. Dean grabs two fresh beers before making his way to the table too.
“Um, I have Cole, Ash, Jo, and Victor all coming and I think you said Meg was coming next week or the week after?”
“No. I just can’t wait until we're there!” she exclaims with a huge smile. Dean chuckles quietly and agrees with his daughter, he can't wait until they're there either.
Cas’ whole face falls. What's worse than Dean calling him buddy? Calling him by his full name. Dean has only done that a few times in their many years of friendship and each time they had been fighting.
“Well not gone, just moved?” Cas looks at him with those big blue eyes of his that he
he gets to share with Cas.
him a little more than platonic best friends, then Dean would be over the moon. But Cas has given no indication to that being the case. Nothing has changed over the course of the last year and Dean is floundering.
“Um yeah, have you looked in a mirror lately? Or like ever?” Dean asks deflecting from the fact that Cas also finds him attractive.
“Uncle Dee!” the little girl shrieks, before taking off in a dead sprint. Laughing, Dean bends down and opens his arms wide. His young niece barrels into him, nearly causing him to fall over from the force.
“Claire, honey, your dad isn’t leaving you,” he tries to reassure her.
One of the best feelings in the world for Castiel is watching one of his quieter students speak up with their take on a poem. Or one of the ‘super-manly’ football players talk about a poem written about love or something else super soft. Cas makes sure his classroom is a safe place for all opinions, so his students know they can say anything they want to say. Obviously he can’t control what happens when his students leave his classroom, but he can hold out hope that they still respect their fellow classmates.
“I know princess,” Dean says, rubbing his hand on her back comfortingly. “I don’t want to leave you either, but guess what!”
“What's up?” he asks when he reaches him.
Already shaking his head Castiel protests. “I need to stay here and do more research.”
“We did, but Dean, this is what I was wanting! Something big to take my mind off everything and I think it will be fun!” Cas explains, smiling slightly. In the daylight, Dean can now see the slight hesitancy his friend has, even if what he is saying is true. This thing is huge, bigger than anything any of them have ever done. Dean knows that no matter how much work has to go into this, they are going to see it through to the end. He nods his head and Cas smiles at his acceptance.
“Anytime Cas,” Dean replies.
“Meg. Cas.” Dean keeps his voice even, looking between the two through steely eyes and making sure his mask is firmly in place. There is no way in hell he is going to give Meg the satisfaction of how much walking in on them is affecting him. He’s hurt. He’s pissed. He’s disappointed. But he’s not surprised in all honesty. Turning around to walk back out the door, Dean calls over his shoulder. “Sorry to interrupt, don't let me stop you.”
“You are such a hippo-crite sometimes Cas,” Dean says with a teasing tone and a quick wink that leaves Cas blushing softly. They watch the kids enjoying their last few minutes before they go to meet up with the rest of the class at the front of the zoo. Cas sends Gabriel and Charlie back in to finish their day. Gabe shoots him a wink and Charlie smiles at him before heading off. He walks with Dean and the class back to the bus and gives each kid a high five as they load up. After all the kids are safely on the bus, Dean turns back to Cas with a soft smile on his face. The zoo keeper steps a little bit closer to the attractive man and reaches up to fix his collar.
“Dean! Claire is missing! I got a call from the school saying she never showed up even though I saw her get on the bus this morning and I already called her phone and she didn't answer and I ran to the house but she wasn’t there either. I called the hospital and rehab center to see if she went to see Amelia but they haven’t seen her either!” Cas is practically shouting into the phone. Dean feels awful. He can hear the terror and panic in Castiel’s voice and knows this whole thing could have been avoided.
Dean shrugs as he sets up his bed, “Suit yourself man, but you're really missing out.”
“We’re going with you,” Emma replies happily.
If Dean were to ever admit he had a specific type it would be Cas. Messy dark hair that Dean would give just about anything to run his fingers through to see if it feels as soft as it looks. Bright blue eyes that he could get lost staring into for hours on end. That’s happened a few times now and Dean can’t wait for the next time. A lean but muscular and strong body type that he knows Cas has. When they were ice skating Dean could feel the man's arms and was shocked by how much muscle he felt. And Cas has that one pair of jeans he wears sometimes on casual Fridays that fit him just right and Dean always has to force himself not to stare at those same thick thighs and ass from earlier. Now add in the glasses and Deans a goner.
“Ugh Mr. Winchester you’re giraffe-ing me crazy with all of these puns,” Cas replies while pointing over his shoulder to the giraffe habitat behind them. Dean turns to stare at the man with shock in his bright green eyes. Then the biggest smile Cas has seen all day splits across the handsome man's face and it’s like pure sunshine.  The kids sense the switch of attention and head over to the giraffes while the two men stand and stare at each other with smiles on their faces.
“I thought you said the coffee here is the best,” Castiel says with narrowed eyes and a slightly raised eyebrow.
Three o’clock rolls around and Dean leaves the site in Benny’s hands while he hurries to the school to pick up the girls. When he gets there he sees them waiting outside, sitting on one of the benches engaged deeply in a conversation. There are a few other students and teachers wandering about, waiting for the rest of the parents to arrive. Dean waves to the girls’ teacher through the car window which prompts her to nudge the girls in his direction. Emma looks up with a big smile on her face and immediately heads his way with Claire trailing right behind.
Dean steals a strawberry off of Castiel’s plate and plops it right into his mouth with a teasing wink sent in his direction. In response Castiel glares and drags his plate closer to himself. Dean chuckles quietly before turning his attention to Chris.
“Sounds good,” Cas replies, his voice kind of scratchy. Dean can’t tell if it's just the phone or from emotion. “Thank you Dean, I’m glad Claire felt safe enough to go to you.”
“It’s all good, Meg. I understand. You go have fun tonight,” he replies with an easy smile.
“What is an idjit?”
The girl continues down the aisle with her parents giving him a grateful look as they pass. Dean smirks at the bewildered look on Castiel’s face before settling back down into his seat and ignoring the other man's questioning looks. The captain's voice comes through the speakers announcing they will be taking off in a few minutes. Dean’s hands grip the armrest at the thought and he tries to calm his heart rate. He has done this countless times before and nothing bad has ever happened, so there is no reason to freak out.
“Our plane got re-routed due to a big storm and we ended up having to emergency land at an airport a couple hours from here,” Castiel explains. Dean shoots him a grateful smile as he signs what Cas said for Eileen.
Coworker doesn’t even seem like the right word to describe Cas anymore. Their friends now right? Dean has found himself actually enjoying the time they have shared together the past couple days and is actually kind of pissed at himself for not attempting to talk to the guy before this trip. He has even told Cas somethings he hasn’t told most of his friends that have been in his life for years. Yeah he would consider Cas a friend now and just hopes the other man feels the same.
Next update will be this weekend, probably Sunday!
Castiel rolls his eyes and mumbles under his breath, “Unbelievable.”
“Dean it's like 10 in the morning she doesn’t need any sugar,” Sam protests behind him.
“Who founded the inn?” Castiel asks. Dean is impressed he is able to keep any disbelief or anything else that may come across hurtful from his tone. He himself would have scoffed and probably hurt Carol’s feelings.
The group moves on to the next section of the zoo. Cas leads them to a few other exhibits of random animals and he has an interesting fact for all of them. The kids are loving all of the information they get from the zookeeper and eagerly write down all that they can. Dean already knows the whole class will have way more than the required five fun facts. He’s very proud of his class for how they’ve been behaving on the field trip so far. The teacher is already planning the trip for next year and however more years he will be teaching here. They come up to the otter exhibit and see the four otters playing in the water. The kids laugh when the otters come right up to the glass then swim away in a swirl of bubbles. Cas doesn’t appear to have anything to say about the creatures so Dean takes the time for another pun. He gets the class’ attention and some are already looking at him anticipating another joke.
Castiel rolls his eyes, “No. Go do your own research.”
Cas looks like wants to argue but an impatient clearing of a throat behind him cuts him off. Dean gives him one last smile then turns and walks out the door. The cold burst of air prickles at his face and causes his eyes to water slightly. At least that's what Dean tells himself since he doesn’t want to admit he just got his heart broken and all he wants to do is sit down and cry. He takes a deep breath and walks around the property. It was obvious Ketch and Cas weren't planning on staying at the inn and there's no way Dean can go back up to the room yet if Cas is gathering his stuff. So Dean spends the next hour wandering with no destination in mind.
“Dean,” Cas says through heavy breathing, taking a moment to catch his breath. “It’s not what it looks like.”
“Not a problem,” Benny replies, leading the way down to the boat. A few minutes later they are all piled on the boat and heading south towards the caves. With the fresh sea breeze blowing against his face Dean feels a hundred times better already than he did the day before. He has almost all of his family and closest friends with him and they're going to have an amazing day.
Castiel thinks about it for a moment then responds, “Sometimes. Honestly, since we’ve been here I haven't thought of him very much. Which has been a bit refreshing. Back in New York, there were constant reminders of our life together and I always missed him then. Looking back on it though I think I really only missed the idea of him. The idea of a partner to come home to after a long day at work you know?”
“Is that why he's getting the divorce?” Claire asks, her voice small and quiet.
“Alright tell me how to play this dumb game,” Castiel says next to him, picking up the discarded videogame from Dean’s lap. Dean stares at him in confusion not quite knowing what to do. “Come on! What do I do?”
“Did the ball go in the hole?” Claire asks again.
Speaking of Dean, Castiel hasn’t seen the other writer all day. When they got back The previous night Dean immediately went up to the room and never came back out. The man was asleep on the rollaway by the time Castiel made his own way to the room and was still there when he got up this morning.
Castiel can see a little more than 20 kids file in and stand in a cluster waiting for their next directions. Some of them look bored and others look like they were ready to take off at a dead sprint. Luckily it seems like the parent volunteers are able to rangle them all together and calm a few of the over energetic bunch. The volunteers handout mini clipboards and pencils to each student. From past years, Cas knows that the paper on the board is a list of the animals housed at the zoo with space next to them for the kids to write one interesting fact about the animals they see. A couple of the students who were looking bored look a little more excited to be there, now that they’ll be able to actually do some work. Cas chuckles quietly to himself knowing that he was the exact same way when he was their age. Always enjoying time reading or writing more than engaging in class activities. The excitement in the air follows the group as they make their way closer to the waiting zoo employees.
“Hey Dean.”
“Ketch?” Cas asks, completely confused on why his ex is in the middle of nowhere Indiana instead of New York. He instinctively takes a step away from Dean and regrets it immediately. He misses the comfort just being in Dean’s arms offered. “What are you doing here?”
A few minutes later Castiel comes out and together they gather the sleeping bags and other supplies they will need in the tent. When Dean enters and finds there is absolutely no spare space he starts to panic again.
Thankfully Dean just holds his hands up in surrender and doesn’t say a word. They study each other for  who knows how long, it could be minutes or hours, Castiel has no idea. Then a slow smile starts to spread across Dean’s face which confuses Castiel. He tilts his head in question waiting for Dean to speak.
“Good morning Dean, how did you sleep?” Carol asks with a sweet smile.
“I thought Dean's family lived a couple hours away,” Carol says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. Cas’ heart clenches in his chest.
“Nothing will change for you Claire. You’ll still live with your dad and come over to my house every day. You’ll still be able to go visit your mom whenever you want. Castiel will never take your mother away from you and he most certainly will never, ever leave you, okay?” Dean says seriously, making sure Claire can see just how much she doesn’t have to worry. “I promise you your dad loves you so much Claire, he would never want to go through life without you by his side.”
Cas shakes his head and watches the bus drive away. He can’t wait to get home to his husband tonight.
The onslaught of information takes Cas by surprise. He expected maybe one fact, not one from almost every kid. What is really surprising is that all of the information is correct. He has never had a group that has known so much about lions before. He turns to Dean and finds the man with a sheepish look on his face.
Honestly Cas is still standing there in shock to feel any kind of way. Never once in the last eight years has Dean been this prepared with his students involvement. It’s actually pretty impressive if Cas really thought about it. He also has to admit the whole thing was kind of funny. Still irritating though he reminds himself trying not to cave to the other man's natural charm. Somehow, against his will, a small laugh does escape and it must catch the whole group by surprise because they go silent. Only for a moment though, because soon everyone is laughing again. Him and Dean both have a fond look in their eye when their gazes meet and they share a soft smile before turning their attention back to the students.
“Does Harrison Ford count?” Dean deflects with his normal humor. Cas huffs in response which brings a small smile to Dean’s face. “No I have not. There's not many things I’m afraid of, besides flying obviously, but falling in love is definitely pretty high on the list.”
“Let me go grab my stuff and I’ll be right back down,” Castiel says hurriedly before rushing up the stairs. As soon as he reaches the room he slams the door and sinks down to the floor. Everything hurts inside and he doesn’t understand why. Deans rejection should not have hurt that much. It’s not like Cas was expecting Dean to beg him to stay even though he knows he would’ve if Dean has just asked. Something about the way Dean was acting worries him but it was clear that Dean didn’t want to fall about it so Cas has to let it go.
He's about to crawl into the way too big bed for one person when his alarm on his phone goes off. Confused Dean picks it up and sees that it's 11:59 with the reminder of the golden streak. Dean debates for almost the entire minute whether it's worth checking out the window for. It's the thought of how happy and excited Cas was when he first told him the legend that convinced Dean to just peek out the window. He's about to give up and head back to the bed when he sees it. A bright golden streak lights up the sky as it swirls around the stars in the night sky.
The previous night's events come back to him and he shifts slightly to look over his shoulder. The sight that greets him is absolutely breathtaking. Early morning sunlight filters through the open curtains and lands perfectly on Dean. His hair appearing more golden with the light and his freckles standing out against his slightly tanned skin. Dean looks so peaceful sleeping that Castiel really doesn't want to disturb him but he knows that if he doesn't move now then he never will. He’s not sure what Dean’s reaction would be waking up to them tangled together and Cas isn’t sure he wants to find out.
Dean smiles triumphantly and Castiel glares. He has no idea what Dean has planned, but he does know it is going to be a very long day. Against his better judgment, Castiel ends up in the car with Dean going to who knows where with Christmas music blasting through the speakers. Dean sings along offkey to every song he knows and Cas can’t tell if he's doing it on purpose or if Dean really can't sing. Knowing how perfect Dean is at everything else it wouldn’t surprise Cas if the man could also sing perfectly. It's an hour into the drive when Cas can’t hold out any longer.
“Dean, this week's shipment didn't come in.”
“Castiel I’ve been so lost without you and I really want to give us another shot,” Ketch says and Cas can even detect a hint of pleading in his voice that shocks him. The Arthur Ketch he knows never begs or pleads for anything unless he really wants it. “Come home with me.”
Cas walks up the few steps to the new french doors and turns to them. “Are you ready to see our new home?”
“Yep! I wanted to tell you that the website is officially up and running!”
“Can you gather up the rest of the crew? I have something I wanna say real quick,” Dean explains.
The deeper they get into the place, the more issues they find. Cracked floors, walls, and ceilings. Water damage almost everywhere. And the basement... Don't even get Dean started on the basement. The place smells like something (hopefully not someone) died down there and the whole place is just one gigantic mess. Dean can’t get a read on Cas’ reaction to the place either, which is weird since Dean normally can read Cas pretty well. They make their way back out to fresh sunny air and find Benny waiting for them.
“What does he call you?” Dean asks curiously.
Cas startles slightly, turning his head to look at Dean through bright blue eyes. “I think this was a good idea.”
“Shurley Engineering, this is Becky,” a high pitched voice comes through the phone's speakers, causing Dean to cringe. Shurley Engineering has never been one of his favorite firms to work with. Their over energetic receptionist just adds to his already monumentally high levels of dread about working with them. Running a hand down his face, Dean pastes on his best customer service smile, even if Becky can’t see him, and attitude before responding.
“Dean,” Cas slurs from somewhere, Dean can’t pinpoint exactly where his voice is coming from so he just hums in response. “What are you doing?”
“You did so good dad! It looks amazing in here,” Claire responds with a small smile. Dean can hear the pride in her voice and can see it in her face. She really is proud of her dad and Dean knows how much that means to Cas. When he looks over to his friend he can see how much it affects him, with his wobbly smile and misty eyes.
Castiel doesn’t know why a pang of hurt shoots through him at those words. They're true after all. Dean and him aren’t even friends.
“Hey Cas, could I talk to you for a minute real quick?”
“Are we okay?” Cas has the audacity to ask and Dean can’t hold back the huff of disbelief even if he tried.
“What are you even doing?”
Cas chuckles in response. “She taught you well.”
— — —
“My apologies,” Castiel says in that deep rumbled voice of his while removing his hand (which Dean does not miss instantly, thank you very much) and taking a slight step back. “Those look amazing Dean.”
“Thank you, I will,” he replies with an easy smile. Several months ago one of his students had been at the Roadhouse during karaoke night and saw their English teacher perform on stage. The next day was interesting, to say the least, as the news spread all through the school. Every class period there were at least five students asking questions about him singing. Luckily nobody made any negative comments or judged him for it, or if they did they wisely kept it to themselves. Cas really doesn’t care if his students or colleagues don’t approve of his Thursday night fun. He loves it and that's all that matters.
“Nah, you go ahead,” Dean replies, leaning back and closing his eyes. Cas stands up using Dean’s shoulder for support and gives a gentle squeeze before heading into the villa. The phantom touch on his shoulder that lingers leaves Dean feeling like he already lost something he never had.
“Why?” she asks, tilting her head in question. The sight nearly brings Dean to his knees.
“Me? You’re the one who writes the fun and interesting articles that everyone loves!” Cas argues.They both seem to realize that they’re really arguing over nothing at this point and they end up just smiling dumbly at the other. With the fight out of them they finish the cookies they’re eating and agree it's probably time for them to head back to bed. Laying back down on the roll away is definitely not something Dean is looking forward to, but it will probably be best to get at least a couple more hours of sleep.
“Dean, that's not fair,” Cas protests. Dean just shakes his head and turns around to keep walking. Cas reaches a hand out and grabs Dean's arm trying to pull him back, but Dean yanks his arm free and stomps on, more angry now than he was before. “Dean!”
“Are you going to invite us in Sammy? It's cold out here,” Dean deflects. Sam steps aside and lets them into the much warmer house. Castiel didn’t realize how cold it was until the warm air hit his cheeks.
“Arthur Ketch. My boyfriend. Or I guess ex-boyfriend now. He broke up with me about a month ago,” Castiel says quietly.
Nothing.
“That’ll be great, thank you,” Castiel says before walking into the room they were brought to.
He finds the open bar and downs the first two shots the bartender places in front of him. Dean orders another whiskey for him to sip on as his gaze travels around the room again. It only takes seconds for him to lock onto a pair of men dancing slowly together. The two look like they are deep in conversation and anger rushes through Dean. It leaves him as quickly as it comes through, and he is left feeling empty. He watches the man he loves dance with another and there's nothing he can do about it. Instead of sipping at his whiskey like he was planning Dean downs it in one go and places the empty glass on the bar. He needs out.
“Yeah, but the kids love it, so totally worth it.”
When they reach the dock there is no sign of Claire's long blonde curls anywhere. Dean and Cas split up and start asking the locals if they have seen Claire. They have been on the island long enough for everyone to know them. Everyone gives them the same answer, they haven’t seen her since the last time all of them had been there last week. Dean watches as the panic and worry settles on Cas’ shoulders more and more as time passes.
Mrs. Winters finds him lying defeated on one of the couches in one of the many sitting rooms the inn has to offer.
“Were going to see my family,” Dean replies after a long minute of tense silence.
“Huh,” Cas looks like he's thinking about something and then smiles slightly. “I never thought about it before but they actually would make a perfect couple.”
“Everything alright?” Benny asks, frowning slightly.
“It's from a local shop here in town! I’ll give you the address later and you can go pick some up if you would like.”
“Hey buddy,” he answers.
“A group of lions is called a pride!”
Everything is ready. The kids are on the bus. Dean has all of the mini clipboards and worksheets for the kids to do while they’re at the zoo. It’s just a list of the animals they will be seeing and a space to write a fun fact they learned about the animal. They just need to get at least five to earn all of their participation points for the day. Dean did a lot of research on the zoo to prepare for the day and now he can’t wait until they’re there.
Dean shifts on the mattress for what is like the eighth time that night attempting to find some kind of comfort. He had a long day of wandering the town and struggling to find something to write about. That blank document from that morning? Yeah still blank. Now he’s laying on the stupid roll away thinking about his article and failing to get any sleep for the third night in a row. Doesn’t seem like Castiel is faring any better tonight either if the constant movement coming from the bed is anything to go off of.
“Do the bears have names?”
“Uncle Dee!” Two girls scream when they come into view. With a happy laugh Dean kneels down and gathers both girls into his arms as they crash into him. They wrap their little arms around his neck and he squeezes them tight to his body. Cas knew Dean was good with kids, the little girl at the airport and the boy from the other day showed that. Seeing him now with his nieces trying to listen to all the information the girls are telling him it's clear to anyone with eyes that Dean is a family man. It makes Castiel wonder if Dean would ever want kids of his own someday. He can picture a little blonde girl with bright green eyes running around in their apartment and maybe a little boy with dark hair and blue eyes like Cas’.
He gets halfway down the hallway when he hears his name called from behind him. Already feeling the tears prickle at his eyes Dean keeps walking, praying that he can get somewhere safe before he completely breaks down.
This is what Dean has always wanted. Someone to sit next to him in silence, enjoying their surroundings before spending the day on the lake with their family and having a blast. If this is all Dean gets to have with Cas, he is going to enjoy every damn second of it and take nothing for granted.
Dean takes a moment to notice how much Claire has grown since he first met her. He remembers the shy angry eight year old his daughter befriended and honestly that much hasn't changed. She's still pretty shy and still pretty angry. No one can blame her for any of that. The girl hasn’t had it easy. She's gotten strong though. Claire isn’t afraid to say what she thinks even if it hurts and she knows what she wants. Dean’s pretty sure she wants to just get away. Why she came to him, he has no idea.
As if his students can read his mind, one of the girls in a small group leaving the classroom calls out,  “Have fun tonight, Mr. Novak!”
Okay… Not exactly what Dean was expecting, but he can work with this.
That doesn’t excuse Claire not seeing Caddyshack though!
“You’ve been reading all day haven’t you?” Dean asks cheekily.
Emma’s eyes start to tear up before she throws herself into her dad's arms and mumbles something into his shoulder. Dean tightens his hold and smiles softly to himself. This happens every year and he really shouldn't be surprised. His daughter is just like him. She hides her nerves behind a bright smile and the need to do something; the case today was bouncing up and down on her toes to try to rid herself of that nervous energy. Dean is the same way, he throws himself into work or the nearest task and smiles through it. He has gotten better over time though and he hopes the same for Emma.
“Hey Benny!” he calls when he finds the burly man. “Can you take over for the rest of the day? I got some stuff I gotta take care of.”
“Alright, let's go check out the villas to see how we will be living for who knows how long,” Dean mumbles before leading the way to the nearest villa. They agreed that they should have an amazing view of the ocean while they live here so they chose one of the beach side villas as their home.
The simple words break Dean’s heart. He doesn’t want to leave her either! Without a second's hesitation Dean pulls his daughter back into his arms and holds just a little bit tighter. Dean never wants to let go of his sweet princess. The harsh reality, however, says otherwise. He knows deep down Emma will be fine and the second she walks through those classroom doors she will be surrounded by friends, old and new. Emma will forget all about her poor old dad... Okay that's not entirely true. Dean knows Emma will be excited all day because she just can’t wait to tell him everything she did. Dean can’t wait either.
“Meg.” he replies curtly, not taking his eyes off of the bathroom tile he is laying.
There is a gentle squeeze to his arm and he looks over to meet Cas’ eyes. The swirls of blue calm him slightly and he is able to take a deep breath to settle himself more.
— — —
“Why did I agree to do this with you?” Dean hisses through his clenched teeth. His hands gripping the armrest turn an alarming shade of white from the strain. He can feel Cas’ eyes on him, a questioning gaze. The plane jolts slightly from the turbulence and Dean’s grip tightens even more. His breath comes out in quick harsh pants, not enough air able to make it to his lungs or brain.
Castiel comes up to his side and peers at the flyer, “Oh! That's the Christmas Eve festival they hold here at the inn every Christmas Eve. Carol said there's dancing, singing, some good drinks, and a lot of food.”
“Anyways it still doesn’t give you the right to get mad at me for one kiss!” Cas jumps right back into their previous conversation. “Do you know how nice it was to feel wanted for once? That somebody actually wanted to be intimate with me? It has been years Dean! Almost decades!”
“That’s because you haven’t found anything.”
They were fortunate to find the Roadhouse not long after they moved to Lawrence and discovered they had karaoke nights once a month. Two months ago Ellen and Jo decided to host karaoke night every week on Thursday since they became more and more popular. So, it became tradition for Cas and Meg once again to go to karaoke night each week. Obviously things come up and they both understand that they have lives outside of karaoke. But having to go alone tonight is a little bit of a bummer for Cas and hits him a little harder than normal. Maybe it's because Meg is going to spend time with her girlfriend (?) while Cas spends the night alone at the bar. This wouldn’t be the first time he was jealous of his friend for having a love/sex life. Luckily he will still have Ellen and Jo to keep him company, at least for a little bit. Cas will just sing his song then head home for an early night.
A minute later the two men are walking out the front doors of the school, back into the bright sunlight. The warmth from the sun is a nice contrast to the cool autumn breeze. Dean takes a deep breath and relishes the crisp air. He notices the guy next to him soaking up the sun with his eyes closed. Dean can’t help but admire the strong jawline and high cheekbones matched with the richly tanned skin.
Cas is pressed all along his side with an arm and leg thrown over Dean to keep him in place. Dean has one arm wrapped around Cas and moves his hand to gently run through his hair. He loves this. Loves the presence of a warm solid body next to his and the way it makes him feel  safe and comfortable. It's been a very long time since Dean has had any kind of intimacy and he never realized how much he missed it until now. He could be perfectly content to stay here wrapped together with Castiel, but he knows his stomach will start protesting in a matter of minutes.
“You think you know me, don’t you?” Dean asks, slightly offended.
Dean picks up a stone sitting next to him in the sand and throws it into the ocean. The act soothes him a little bit so he does it again, and again. He’s not sure how many rocks he has thrown into the waves but soon a cold touch to his shoulder startles him mid throw.
“Hey kids, check out the lion up there! He has his very own cat-walk,” Dean exclaims with a smile. The kids giggle at his pun and look up at the magnificent creature strutting across the rocks. Without meaning to, Dean’s eyes skip over to Cas to see his reaction. To his great disappointment, the man seems to have a very angry scowl on his face. Dean’s smile falls instantly. He doesn’t know why the zookeeper is getting so upset about some stupid puns, but it's really starting to irritate him right back. Dean is here for the kids, trying to make this trip more entertaining and fun for them. What does it matter if their tour guide doesn’t like his jokes? Funny how Dean has to keep reminding himself that.
Dean leads them back to the bungalow the four of them have shared for the several months they have been living on the island. They find Emma sitting on her bed wringing her hands together. Her head snaps up at the sound of them walking through the door and there is so much hope in her eyes that disappears immediately when she realizes it's just them.
Except the fact that he will be hurtling through the sky in a flying metal deathtrap in just a few minutes.
“Have you ever been in love?” Castiel's rough voice breaks the silence surrounding them.
“Why did you want the Aspen job so badly?” Castiel asks, breaking the silence.
“The girl lions are the ones who hunt for the group!”
“You should feel very honored to be given this opportunity,” Dean replies, keeping his tone light.
“Hello, I’m Castiel and this is Gabriel. We will be your tour guides for today,” Mr. Blue Eyes says, and hot damn that voice is gravelly and smooth all at the same. “I understand you will split the class into two groups, correct?”
“It's going well I suppose,” Cas replies in his deep rough voice. “Is there a reason you are calling me at work? Is Claire okay?”
“Right? That’s what I thought too. And then the more I looked at it the less sense it made. I mean look at the clothes and jewelry, they match perfect with that time period,” Cas explains. Dean wouldn’t know, he’s not a history person like Cas is. “And the picture itself is clearly well over a century old.”
“Oh I bet, did you get her number?” Castiel sasses back, taking Dean by surprise. He didn’t think the man had it in him with always being so stuffy and uptight around the office.
The group reaches the polar bear habitat a few minutes later. Dean can see two polar bears playing in the water, but the group is too high to see what they are actually doing. Which he finds kind of a bummer, but then Castiel keeps walking and leads the group to a lower viewing area. The kids rush to the glass to get closer to a bear swimming by and they all have huge smiles on their faces. Of course, Dean is right there with them, hands and face pressing against the glass trying to get as close as possible to the giant creatures. A throat clearing behind him brings Dean’s attention back to their tour guide. Who is now staring at him with an amused smile.
“Yes, I was planning on attending,” Dean chuckles before taking a sip of his heavenly beverage. Carol pats his cheek then stands up to attend to the other guests. He finishes his breakfast consisting of chocolate chip pancakes and bacon before moving to one of the sitting rooms and the spot he has claimed as his. Just as he is pulling out his laptop Castiel appears in front of him holding his own cup of coffee. He’s wearing his glasses again, which is not fair, and looks like he didn’t bother to fix his hair at all. Dean loves it.
“Second drawer on the left,” he replies with a heavy sigh.
Cas on any normal day is attractive as hell and Dean has issues keeping himself in check. But sleep rumpled Cas with even messier bed head than usual? The sight nearly brings Dean to his knees right then and there. Cas squints at him through heavily lidded eyes and Dean wonders if Cas can see anything at all in the still dark lighting. Dean does raise his hand in a small awkward wave with a smile to match before continuing to exit the tent.
“Sammy!” Dean lights up at the sight of his little brother. Although little is certainly not the word Castiel would use to describe the man.
“Then why is he getting a divorce?” she asks between sniffles.
It’s field trip day again….
Evening drifts in, bringing the cooler air with it. Dean sets up the campfire for the girls and Cas to huddle around while he makes his famous burgers for dinner. You can't go camping and not have burgers! Plus, Dean makes the absolute best burgers in the entire state. The fact that Castiel loves his burgers too has nothing to do with why Dean is making them their first night. Humming a song stuck in his head (no it is not Taylor Swift), Dean startles when he feels a gentle hand resting on the small of his back.
“Did you not like my jokes then? Because if they were rude or disrespectful to you or the animals I can stop, I just thought the kids might enjoy them,” Dean says slightly embarrassed.
“Wow Dean it smells amazing in here,” Cas says with a smile. Dean returns the smile while checking the chicken in the oven. “What are you making?”
“They’ve seen how hard everything has been on Cas and how much it is draining him to keep up with Amelia's rehab, care and relapses. Of course, they have helped as much as Cas would allow them, which isn’t much. Somehow they finally convinced him to let go a little bit and give them the responsibility to care for their daughter,” Dean explains.
Yes. Dean nods his head. Finally able to take in his surroundings again Dean forces his eyes away from the pair of lips and instead focuses on a pair of bright blue eyes.
“This is Castiel.”
The question confuses Dean, “What do you mean?”
“I ran into a cute girl at the gift shop,” Dean answers with a smirk.
“You would do that for me?” Dean asks, slightly suspicious.
Dean sits on the floors in front of the fireplace with a giant fluffy pink tutu around his waist. Mary and Liz sit around him in their matching tutus playing with their new dolls. He loves his nieces, he really does, but they're really pushing their limits of what he can handle right now. There is glitter
“The captain did say that we are in for a bumpy flight due to some weather,” Castiel (un)helpfully provides. Dean’s glare is his only response.
“Dean, I have loved you for years. I like to think it started the first time you made me dinner at your house. And then it just kept growing and growing. When you invited me along on your sacred trip to the lake, I know how much that trip means to you and what me going with you symbolized. I was a goner at that point. I wanted to be selfish and have the girls sleep on the outside and us in the middle so that maybe just maybe we would end up close together during the night. That trip gave me hope that maybe there is something between us. Over the years that hope grew right alongside my love for you, but I am so tired Dean. I am so tired of not knowing and having this hope taken away time after time. So tell me now if my heart is in the right place or if I should move on because I don't know how much more I can take.”
“Oh that’s wonderful! Just in time for the festival! You are planning on going yes?” Carol looks at him expectantly, like he really doesn’t get a choice in the matter.
By the time they landed, Dean seemed to be doing okay. He still practically sprinted off the plane and just about kissed the ground but that was better than having another panic attack on the plane. The two men follow the rest of the crowd into the small airport and make their way to the service desk. The wait takes forever and Castiel swears it takes them at least ten minutes to move just one spot forward. Castiel can feel Dean getting restless behind him and he just hopes they can get on the next flight out to Aspen. The sooner the better. No matter what happened between the two of them earlier on the plane doesn’t matter, they still have an article to write and are each other's competition. They don't even like each other!
“Mr. Cas sir?” One of the boys in the group looks at him with a big gummy smile. “Can they dance?”
Cas is frozen in shock as he sees a man make his way to the stage, being pushed by a short blonde woman Cas recognizes as Jo. As they come closer Cas can clearly see that this is in fact the very same Dean Winchester. And for some reason, which makes absolutely no sense to Castiel, Dean is even more attractive in person than he is in the countless amount of pictures Cas has seen of the guy. He's not a stalker or weirdo,  but he just might have a really big crush on the guy. To be fair Cas never actually expected to meet the guy. That was the whole point of celebrity crushes; you look and appreciate from a far, but nothing is ever supposed to come from it!
Growing up without active parents in their lives is one of the things that the two men bonded over. It shocked Dean that he was even willing to open up about his own past, but Cas makes it easy and natural. He told Castiel all about how his mom died when he was only four and how it absolutely destroyed his dad. With his dad drunk almost all of the time it was up to Dean to raise Sammy, his little brother. As time went on, and Dean got older, their dad would leave them for long periods of time to fend for themselves and Dean would do everything in his power to make sure Sammy always had food and anything else he could possibly need. When Dean was about sixteen John finally allowed them to settle in one town and promised they would stay there long enough for Sam to graduate. That really just meant Dean and Sam would stay there while John still left them.
Castiel puts his tablet safely away and shrugs in his trench coat before leaving the inn. The air is cold and brisk but feels good against his heated skin. The sky is clear with a few white clouds sprinkled about. The sun shines big down warming the air slightly when not in the cover of the trees and it truly looks like a winter wonderland out here. Sparkling snow is covering every surface which brings a smile to Castiel’s face the whole walk to town.
“Alright dear, let me know if you need anything alright?” Carol says and with one last pat on his arm, she turns to join the rest of her guests downstairs.
“And Cas?” Benny asks.
Castiel isn’t sure how to feel about Dean anymore. He surprised him by giving his chocolate to the sweet young girl on the plane and then they had some kind of moment back on the plane. No, Dean was having a panic attack and Castiel helped him through it. That's all it was. There was no moment. Castiel scowls inwardly. He forces himself to remember they have work to do and they are not friends.
-- -- --
This can’t be good.
“Okay, let's do this.” Castiel takes a deep breath and then lets it out. He has never been good with meeting new people. His people skills are rusty and small talk is not his forte. Dean must sense his anxiety spike because suddenly there is a hand gripping his chin and turning his face. The hand moves to cup his cheek and Castiel leans into it slightly taking any comfort he can from the small gesture.
“Coffee,” the other man all but demands.
“And Jo, if you ever hurt him,” Dean pauses again, looking between his two friends. “Actually sorry Benny, you’re on your own with that one. She scares me!”
“Um yes. My boyfriend surprised me here and we are flying out early tomorrow to go meet his family for Christmas so he got us a room near the airport,” Castiel explains. Every word coming out of his mouth feels so wrong though.
“Hey, not always girls! Sometimes boys too!” Dean protests.
That is until Cas came in wanting to change the layout.
Dean wants him to go? It hurts hearing those words and Castiel can feel his brows pinching together in confusion. He thought the two of them were friends but by the way Dean is acting, he’s not so sure. Before he can ask or say anything though Dean is out the door and Castiel is left standing in the walkway with Ketch. Taking a deep breath trying to center himself, Castiel turns his attention back to his ex (current?) boyfriend.
It only takes a few minutes before the two of them are standing in front of classroom 2C. Dean peers inside and sees at least ten kids already in there, mingling. He sees a couple parents telling their kids goodbye too. A tight squeeze on his hand draws his attention and he glances down to see a worried look on Em’s face. The eight year old is no longer bouncing on her toes like she was the last time Dean looked at her. Now she is hiding behind his legs clutching onto him as if her life depended on it and worrying her lower lip, a nervous habit she picked up from Dean.
Dean mentally kicks himself when he remembers where he is. This is Cas’ workplace. He shouldn't be trying to hit on the guy here, especially in front of all of the kids. Dean wouldn’t want someone to come into his classroom and try to hit on him while he’s working. The silence hangs between the two men and grows increasingly uncomfortable. At least for Dean, Castiel doesn’t seem like it is affecting him at all. The man just stands there watching the kids and the other guests. With a heavy sigh, Dean turns his attention from the blue-eyed man to his group of kids.
Jody gives him an understanding smile. “We do have one, yes!”
The sound of water running brings Castiel back into awareness. For a minute he thinks he is back at the Winters Inn and Dean is the one in the shower but when he rolls over and buries his face in the pillow expecting the smell of cedar that he has come to associate with Dean he is very disappointed when it smells like plain laundry detergent. Cas sits up with a frown on his face and takes in his surroundings. Even through his blurry vision, he doesn't see any Christmas tree in the corner, or warm sunlight filtering in through soft curtains, or beautiful custom dark wood furniture. It leaves his stomach in knots not having the familiarity of the inn or the comfort of knowing Dean is nearby.
Dean most definitely does not pout when he steps out of the way to let the teenager have her turn. He watches Claire line up her shot, then watches the ball as it rolls straight into the hole for her own hole in one. The second that Claire turns back to him he rolls his eyes, knowing exactly what's coming next.
The question shocks Dean so much that he can't help the bark of laughter that escapes him. “Cas, buddy, if I had a problem with you being gay then I would have a major problem with myself.”
“Talk to Cas and see if he’s fine with a more mosaic look, so we don’t need to order more.”
Emotions well up within him and tears threaten to fall again. This time he lets them, knowing no one can see him. Somehow he manages to convince himself that things will be okay and they will get through the rest of this project, go home, and move forward. He just needs to take it day by day until he is okay.
All Ketch asked for was another chance. Castiel can give him that. They worked well together before so they can work well together again. Whatever little crush Cas has on Dean will fade when they get back to New York since Cas will probably be fired and never see Dean again. There's no reason to dwell on something that will never be. With his mind made up, Castiel quickly finishes his shower and gets dressed for the day. Their flight leaves at eight so they can make it back to New York in time for the big family dinner with Ketch’s family.
Slightly embarrassed Dean rubs the back of his neck, “Sorry, it’s been a while since I’ve been to a zoo.”
Castiel walks over with his suitcase rolling behind him and a smile on his face.
“Gah! You are so infuriating!” Cas throws his hands up into the air and stomps forward a few steps before whipping around to face Dean again with a finger pointed right at his chest. “You know I resigned myself to being alone for the rest of my life. After the first year or so when I finally accepted that Amelia and I were never going to be the same again, I accepted that. We fell out of love so fast that I don’t even know if we ever were truly in love. I had to stay though. I had to stay for Claire. I didn’t want to disappoint or let down anyone. Not Claire. Not Amelia. Not her parents. And not myself. I felt like a failure Dean. I felt nothing for years. Nothing! Until I met you.”
“Oh shut up Sasquatch,” Dean glowers at his brother but there is no heat behind his words. They join the rest of the family and serve up their plates. Cas was worried there wouldn’t be enough food since they are technically unexpected guests but Eileen assures him they have plenty to go around even with Dean there. Her comment earns another half hearted protest on Dean’s part but the second he bites into the homemade bun all is forgiven.
Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel sees Dean reach across the counter with a twenty dollar bill under his hand. Dean winks at the employee and gives one of his winning smiles as one last-ditch effort to get on a flight out of this place.
“You couldn’t have said something a little bit earlier, when we didn't have nearly all of them done already?”
Dean’s heart stops.
Dean glances to his right and finds Cas staring out the window just like his daughter. The sight brings a smile to his face. After their first meeting, Dean never expected this is where they would end up. Emma and Claire have spent basically every waking moment together. Last school year Dean ended up taking both girls home with him after school almost every day. Cas’ schedule just got more and more busy as time went on. Plus some other personal stuff going on that Dean only knows a tiny bit about. All he knows is that it involves Claire’s mom. Dean has been wanting to ask for more, but never felt like he could. If Castiel wanted to tell him then he would.
“Wait, suite?” Dean asks. “We’re not together.”
“My ‘people skills’ are rusty so to speak,” Cas says hesitantly and uses actual finger quotes, which causes Dean to smile. “I often don’t catch jokes, or puns, or references. Gabriel often makes fun of me for my lack of ‘pop culture knowledge’.”
Dean lets out a sarcastic laugh. “No, no it is not.”
“Hey man, how's it going?” A smile pulls at Dean's lips, his mood already improving. They don’t know each other very well but at least Dean doesn’t have to work with Michael or Chuck himself.
you mean my dad don’t you?”
“I’ve been working with Castiel for a few years now, some might even call us friends. I know him. I also gave him a hard time about you when we saw you checking in. Then I saw your reaction to him and well it was practically a no brainer to set you two up. Did it work?”
“Hello Claire.”
Dean pushes his way through the crowd towards the front door, desperately in need of some fresh air. Before he gets there though he hears his name being called in the familiar deep gravelly voice that sends shivers down his spine. Against his better judgment hope starts to fill his stomach as he turns around to see Cas heading his way. The little bit of hope that got built up comes crashing right back down when he sees Cas pulling Ketch behind him by his hand. The sight makes Dean feel sick to his stomach but he puts on his brave face and smiles at the two men.
