“The environs are vaguely familiar, although I can’t be sure,” John mused, clutching my arm. “I think Mrs. Hudson and I passed these places on the way to the Turners.”
I don’t know how long I wandered aimlessly. Did they catch him? Would they torture him before executing? Nothing mattered anymore. I could take a cab, go back to my surgery, and wait for them there. Then a thought crossed my mind that they would get me anyway, here, on these streets, so why bother. I lowered myself on some half-broken bench, having neither strength nor will to go on.
Lestrade descended the stairs and hid under the counter closest to the Christmas tree while Holmes and I remained in the shadows of the gallery, from which we could observe everything below. Our waiting stretched ahead for hours, but I was only happy to be at Holmes’s side, for there had been a time when I had had no hope of ever sharing it with him again.
I glanced at my watch: John was half an hour late. This wasn’t typical of him at all, considering his military punctuality. Had he been detained by a patient, he would’ve sent a note. But perhaps there were no spare servants in the house to do the task or perhaps the patient’s condition was so grave he lost track of time. In spite of the many possible explanations which it was easy to imagine, a vague sense of foreboding seized me. Mycroft regarded me with a slightly raised eyebrow, saying nothing. He had never approved of my ‘getting attached’ as he called it, but wisely kept his opinion to himself.
He pulled back to look at me and then crushed me into his embrace once again. His violent trembling turned into uncontrollable sobs. He was like a tightly wound spring which had been suddenly released. He cried and cried in my arms as I whispered to him every soothing endearment that came to my mind. At last I could comfort him, making up for that terrible day in Meiringen when he had wept alone. Tears were streaming down my cheeks too, and I made no attempt to contain them.
John turned back and stared at me. I reached out for him, but he staggered to his feet, still staring in utter disbelief. Then, to my horror, his eyes glazed over and he collapsed as though he was mowed down.
He silenced my protest with another kiss, this time harsh and demanding. There was a clang of the lid of the vaseline jar, and then his slick hand closed around my prick. I received so much pleasure from being taken that I didn’t mind leaving my prick without attention; being frigged and buggered would have made me reach the crisis too soon. John was giving me broad strokes, but I would much prefer that he enter me again. Then, however, I realised what was on his mind. He straddled my hips and guided my prick to his entrance.
“Mr. Holmes, you’ve always had a penchant for the dramatic,” Mrs. Hudson remarked calmly, even though colour drained from her face.
He interprets so much from just a squeeze on his wrist. Here we see Doctor’s humanity too—his first instinct is to help the one who is being hurt, even if it’s the worst man in London. When their night adventure is safely over, and Lestrade visits them the next morning, we have a rare instance of Watson’s physical description in the text of the Canon:
Approaching this story, let’s keep in mind that Watson is an unreliable narrator—he stated so himself on other occasions by mentioning that he had to suppress some facts, change names and dates, etc. This is not to say that the good doctor is a liar. He is a storyteller, he presents facts in a light which he deems most suitable. Actually, that’s what news agencies do all the time—presenting events in a certain way. As a result you have to take your news feed with a grain of salt, and the same goes for Watson’s narrative too. Perhaps that’s why for a while Holmes used to be annoyed with Watson’s method: it’s not a clear reflection of the facts as they are, but rather giving a version of them with creative licence. Remember what Holmes said about Watson in BLAN:
“My brother and I have a personal reason for revenge. We are sole survivors of a once-prominent family which has been decimated by the Crown. Ever since we were children, we both have been living under assumed identities. Mycroft, being good at numbers and analysing facts, made for himself a position of a consultant. He sabotages the government from the inside so masterfully that no thread of suspicion has ever led to him. Even now he is making a show of tracing me.”
Enjoying the ingenuity with which John hid the identities of our former clients, I repented of the harshness of my former criticism of his literary endeavours. While his renditions of our past cases often took blatantly fantastic forms (snakes summoned by whistling!), they never failed to entertain and cheer. What were supposed to be grim narratives of humanity’s vilest ways emerged from under his pen as messages of hope.
Among positive effects it had on me, there was a certain thing which brought John a special delight. I became fully able as a man again. I had him wherever fancy seized us, from the sofa in the drawing-room to the billiard table to the gazebo in the garden. These libertine practices tickled us immensely.
They were staring at each other, Saville’s attention focused fully on Holmes. Knowing Holmes so well, I realised that he was distracting Saville, relying upon me to act. I glanced around frantically.
I stifled another moan as his hands slipped back and covered my buttocks. He parted them and ran a forefinger along the cleft. The tip of his forefinger probed my entrance.
“Yes. On Boxing Day Lord Roxton and his wife will give presents to the children of the poor, and their son, the famous traveller, will read a lecture about his adventures.”
“Well, Mr. Holmes, whatever you did, it didn’t seem that the policeman was aware of it. He had no interest in you, and there are no bobbies waiting for you at the door.”
The threat left me with a heavy feeling, however. Having started the fight against Moriarty, I had since then been aware of the danger it entailed for John. The Professor wouldn’t have had any scruples about hurting him to bring me down. The way matters stood, it was only a question of time.
Watson describes his excitement which is quite close to sexual arousal: doing something that is punishable by law, but for a good cause; risking reputation and even freedom to be with someone dear—the parallels are quite obvious, aren’t they?
Holmes is being cute: he said just before that Watson would consider it simple after an explanation, and when Watson does exactly that Holmes is still a little ruffled. What an example of pure, emotionless logic, everyone.
“Yes, and it clarified matters a great deal. Note that it was delivered not to Baker Street, but to the gymnasium we frequent. The proprietor would surely notify me of its discovery the very day, had we not been there. Or, likelier still, the sender saw us. Why not just speak to me then?”
“No fever,” he muttered, relieved a little. “You must soak your feet as soon as we return, and I’ll ask Mrs. Hudson for some chicken soup. It will warm you up thoroughly.”
And he did describe it to me in detail. It was more than a method—it was a science, an art which seemed so fanciful that I wouldn’t have believed it was possible, yet Holmes read my late brother’s life story from the watch I had inherited from him. It was fascinating. We talked and talked until we fell asleep. That night for the first time in a long while no nightmares bothered me.
“Are you still in danger, Sherlock?” John asked, looking keenly at me. “The Park Lane murder is the signature style of those villains.”
We hailed a cab to go home. The thrill of adventure worn off, we huddled closer to each other for warmth, shivering in spite of ourselves. A nagging headache settled in my frontal lobe, my temples throbbing, and then there was tingling in my nose followed by a nasty bout of sneezing. I managed to take out my handkerchief just in time. Watson looked at me with concern and felt my forehead.
I had always taught Sherlock not to get attached, but to no avail. His first major attachment ended in a disaster. A college friend seduced him, spent a few months with him, and then left, both the university and Sherlock. If only Sherlock was able just to amuse himself casually, not letting a person he shared bed with into his heart. No, for Sherlock a mere dalliance was impossible. It had to turn into a full-fledged
A good appetite was a trait the doctor and I had in common. We enjoyed roast beef—my chef’s specialty—and a comet vintage, engaging in small talk. As I asked Watson about his practice and Sherlock’s well-being, it tickled me to observe the gears working in his head. He was clearly wondering why I had invited him.
At the crossroads we turned towards a grove in a small valley between the hills. Only upon approaching the grove did the valley unfold completely in front of our eyes and a lovely Georgian house become visible. Built of red brick, with a brown-tiled roof and white airy sash-windows, it was modest but genteel and welcoming. Although the garden which surrounded it had run to seed and the tall yew hedge was unkempt, there was something artistic about that state of neglect.
Nevertheless, it tickles me that ACD’s unintentional inconsistencies can be read as very much intentional clues on Watson’s part. It’s such a fertile ground for many headcanons and fic ideas.
Seeing off the police-van which was driving the malignant Jonas Oldacre away, I drew a sigh of relief. The past few days had been harrowing for Holmes, who had refused to eat, saying that it would slow him down. The diet of cigarettes and coffee was now taking its toll, for Holmes’s face was pallid as he peered after the van, his bloodless lips curved up in a triumphant smile. When the carriage disappeared around the corner, I touched Holmes’s elbow. It was time to go home and rest. Holmes nodded, but suddenly he swayed and staggered, grasping for me. The next instant he collapsed senseless into my arms. My heart racing, I held him and cursed inwardly that I hadn’t taken my medical bag with me.
“Because I turned the case down initially. It’s trivial. A careless lord is being blackmailed. He promises a generous sum in return for the compromising letters.”
Holmes’s plan worked like a charm. With his unequalled acting he managed to wheedle a confession from Smith and even trick the villain into sending a signal to the police ambush waiting outside. It took an athletic private detective, a former army doctor, and a police inspector to apprehend the giant of a zoologist, and the assistance of two more constables to put him into the police van. Needless to say, it was quite an exciting diversion from my everyday medical routine.
Sure enough, at five minutes past eleven Martha ushered a police inspector into my consulting-room. While Mycroft Holmes had been intimidating, this representative of authorities was merely unpleasant. He resembled a fat rat, with his pouch-like cheeks, long droopy moustache, and small shifty eyes. Constable Rance was following in his wake.
8. For a person who claims to have never loved, Holmes knows and understands what love is really well. Would he be able to, if it were a completely alien notion to him?
Sherlock’s eyes grew soft, and he caressed my cheek, smiling. After his return, for two months we had been at it like bunny-rabbits, making up for all those years of separation. By now our appetites had become more or less normal, but physical intimacy remained for us a great emotional consolation.
By noon we had another, much humbler visitor. A timid-looking lady in her sixties wearing a worn, dark dress was ushered into our sitting-room. Her face was round and good-natured, her shoulders stooped, and her hands red and coarse.
“For half an hour I remained there frozen to the spot, fearing that he might return. At last I managed to sneak out. I was at my wit’s end. What if the police wouldn’t believe me? What if he would learn that I talked to the police? Surely, he would do away with me!
Watson instantly wins people over—he did it years ago with Holmes himself and with us, readers: you get to like the chap just a few pages into
My feet brought me to Sherlock’s room again of their own accord. His mouse-coloured dressing-gown hung on the peg beside the door. I reached out and caressed the tattered fabric. Pictures of criminals adorning the walls, a dark lantern on the side-table, the tin box containing notes of Sherlock’s early cases—each item brought up unbidden recollections of the happy time. Even when we had quarreled, it had been a happy time. The future ahead was bleak.
“Looking forward to it, my dear fellow. Judging by what you’ve shown me of your writing in our army days, you have a talent. And you know I am not prone to flattery.”
Throughout many stories Watson repeatedly describes Holmes as unemotional and unreadable for strangers, and his own ability to perceive Holmes’s thoughts and emotions because he knows Holmes intimately. In this context, a parallel between them and Gibson/Grace Dunbar (who, as it is implied at the end of the story, are later in a relationship) is rather suggestive. Here’s what Miss Dunbar says of Gibson:
,” I replied matter-of-factly. Mycroft’s curiosity was somewhat invasive, but John’s well-being was more important.
that the Duke willingly left his younger son in the hands of the kidnappers for the sake of his older son. Then Holmes makes sure that the boy is retrieved and does everything to restore normal family conditions for the stressed and lonely child, suggesting that the Duke reconcile with the Duchess and Wilder is removed from the household. Technically, this is beyond the boundaries of Holmes’s professional services, and yet he goes out of his way to fix it for Arthur. Of course, it’s empathy again. But maybe it’s also because at some point Holmes was deprived of a loving home hearth himself? Perhaps something happened in Holmes’s past, and he ended up being sent off to a boarding school, all to himself without even Mycroft’s company, since Mycroft is seven years his senior and must have entered the university when Holmes was ten. It has always struck me as a possibility.
My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition.
He would have to go soon, for his own good and for mine. That was a fact. There was no point in getting attached, and yet I spent the night by his bedside again, relishing his company.
A naughty child who got carried away could say that. And then it struck me. He had mentioned once having lost his mother at a very young age and her death having been sudden. Mrs. Hudson, who always cared for us, was a kind of a motherly figure to us both. He must have had a nasty flashback, and in his weakened state couldn’t cope.
“Yes, finally, ‘A Study in Scarlet’ is to make an appearance,” I replied, delighted by his enthusiasm.
It was imprudent to say such things, especially to a stranger, but for some reason I felt that Holmes would not use it against me. He looked as if he was on the verge of taking me into his confidence, for I could see by his expression his inner struggle. Eventually he just nodded and stayed silent.
“Good evening, gentlemen, and welcome.” James Neville bowed his head slightly. “As usual, I believe?”
“First you shall wash yourself and change,” Mrs. Hudson said sternly. “Then visit the barber’s down the street. Then have breakfast. And then you are going with me, to Kent, to my sister’s.”
John did make good on his promise to advertise his practice for sale shortly after his birthday. Thinking of a way to be rid of it quickly and at the price John wished, I remembered a young doctor, a distant relative of mine. Horace Verner was a second cousin once removed, with an anglicised surname, yet christened in honour of our celebrated French ancestor. Last I had heard of the chap, in 1890, he had been employed as an assistant to a country practitioner somewhere in Shropshire. I sent a letter to Verner’s mother who informed me that he had recently married and was struggling to keep up a meagre practice of his own in Southsea. I made further inquiries to his former employer and learned that Verner was a competent and hard-working physician. In short, he was an ideal candidate. Under the pretext of congratulating him upon his recent marriage, I contacted him and offered to establish him in London at my own expense if he would be amenable to taking over the practice of my dear friend. As one might expect, Verner’s reply was prompt. He thanked me profusely for such a generous wedding gift and agreed with my stipulation that he not mention my involvement to Dr. Watson when writing to him.
Other patrons of the pub shot curious looks in our direction from time to time, but I remembered what Holmes had said once about the scattered country houses: much could happen under their roofs with none around being the wiser. While he had been referring to various terrible crimes, in our case the crime was merely being different.
As soon as the case started to look like a commonplace burglary with a murder, Holmes is disappointed. Note the simile Watson uses as a medical man:
Thoughts of the case abandoned, I got to my feet and followed John upstairs. The door of his bedroom was locked which only confirmed my conjecture.
Despite appeals in the medical press for newspapers to keep the threat in perspective and not to foster ‘dread’ of the epidemic through ‘sensational telegrams’, the pandemic appears to have sparked hysteria in London, particularly among male patients. At St Bartholomew’s Hospital in Smithfield and the Royal Free Hospital in the Grays Inn Road, for instance, Samuel West, a specialist in respiratory disease, described how he had been astonished to arrive at morning surgery to find more than 1,000 patients—the majority of them men—‘clamouring for treatment’. (
My back ached from the crooked posture I had been maintaining for hours. When I sat down, our eyes met again. I should have dropped the pretence at once but couldn’t bring myself to do it. John gave his utmost attention to the nonsense I was inventing on the spot about my being a bookseller, etc., etc. While I went on and on with my histrionics, he continued to regard me as a stranger. There seemed to be a sparkle of recognition in his tired gaze, but I waited in vain for him to acknowledge it.
Usually Holmes does show some appreciation of Watson’s kindness, though (REIG, EMPT, SOLI, DYIN, RETI, etc). Actually, it never ceases to amaze me how accommodating Watson can be of Holmes’s needs, and how he takes it with utmost selflessness.
I hurried upstairs to get prepared, and five minutes later we were in a cab, rattling to the station. At Holmes’s request, our kind Mrs. Hudson had managed to arrange for us a cold supper on very short notice, so I had a weighty wicker basket in my lap.
“The mechanism hasn’t been touched for about a decade, since the clock was made,” he said, scrutinising the lid through a powerful lens. “The thin layer of dust around the screws is undisturbed.”
, has had a good reception from the public so far, albeit the title seems to have unnerved many readers, having brought up memories of another December story,
” where a professor transplants human pituitary gland and testicles to a stray dog, and it mutates into a man).
I was numb all over. In his state Holmes wouldn’t get far, and there was nothing, nothing I could do. The screams from the market returned me to the battlefield, making me smell the rancid stench of gunpowder and rotting flesh. I kept repeating to myself that it wasn’t real, none of it was real.
“No, we are not being watched. But you do have a point,” Holmes replied cryptically. “Anyway, after the third message my theory was complete. I checked the news related to Hamleys and found out that indeed Lord Roxton’s charity event was to start at half-past two on the 26th of December. One would need unhindered access to the premises to set the time the night prior, supposing that the bomb had already been installed. Therefore, it was very likely that the criminal was one of the employees. I contacted the manager of Hamleys, explained my concerns, and asked whether I could come instead of the actor who entertained the buyers to see if there was a familiar face among the staff. Indeed there was. Saville—under an assumed name, naturally—works there as a maker of mechanical toys and clocks. The Irregulars are now shadowing him, and if we are lucky, we may catch his accomplices as well.”
“Truth to be told, I have mixed feelings about my Kensington practice,” he said pensively. “It saved my sanity, really. It kept me going. But the place is also linked in my mind with loneliness and misery, so… I shall send out advertisements.”
I think I found the ultimate answer as to why Mary calls Watson James in TWIS. It’s the most trivial version of all that exist: ACD did forget Watson’s name.
My Paddington practice was purchased by Anstruther who along with Jackson had often helped me out and now sought to expand. The practice I bought in Kensington was quite busy, and I was glad of it: with numerous patients to attend to there was no time to brood. As for my literary aspirations, writing new stories filled the solitary evenings I had so dreaded.
On better days we did venture outside, predictably followed by the most impertinent journalists. Solitary walks around the city were moot, so we had to postpone my reacquaintance with London for an indefinite period. We could still enjoy theatres and restaurants, although the attention from the public was wearisome. Thus we mostly stayed home, engaging ourselves in quiet domestic pastimes such as updating my indexes. It was a gargantuan task due to the quantity of information that had accumulated in my absence. I was infinitely touched that John had kept all his old newspapers for the purpose and had them delivered from his Kensington house. My favorite black clay pipe arrived with the countless newspaper bundles. Its appearance indicated that it had been used recently but handled with care and regularly cleaned.
He looked at me with such adoration that I felt my cheeks burn the way they had the very first time we had investigated a case together, when he had been amazed at my deductions of the crime scene in another empty house. I would have pressed him against the wall and ravished his mouth had we not been obliged to stay alert. His eyes twinkled, for the turn of my thoughts was obvious to him. He caressed my hand in silent promise: later that night he would be mine and I would be his again.
” about him, and he can’t resist MacCoy’s influence, even though Edward’s family try hard to separate them.
There would be no empty grave and no cenotaph; only a prayer recited by the priest in the circle of the closest. Besides Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, and myself, there were Lestrade and Wiggins, who represented the Irregulars, being their very first chief.
It was left unsaid between us two that my prospects had not been quite bright at the time. I could afford only renting, not buying, and a rather plain lodging, surely not a residence.
I returned home, resolved that countermeasures had to be taken urgently. John was in the sitting-room, ensconced in his armchair and wrapped in his maroon dressing-gown, a yellow-backed novel in his hands—a sight for sore eyes after a long day. The moment I entered, he started fussing over me, saying that I looked exhausted. I didn’t have much appetite but humoured him by taking a cup of tea and a sandwich.
Finally, we called it a night and exchanged promises to meet again in another few years. Putting on my hat, I felt something knock me lightly on the head. Upon checking, it turned out to be a big walnut. My tipsy comrades roared with laughter, exclaiming that the prank was hilarious, but nobody confessed.
He groaned in pleasure as I worked on his back. Upon his return from Afghanistan he had been skin and bone, but now he was all muscle and sinew under my palms. I have always loved touching him, and now that I can do it to my heart’s content, I cannot get enough. By the time he lay down to let me tend to his legs, he was completely lax save for his erect member which stood up proudly, engorged and flushed pink. I was just as hard for him, massaging his thighs and resisting the temptation to wrap my fingers around his gorgeous cock. Then I gave my full attention to his calves and especially his ankles, for his damaged tendo Achillis was bothering him.
Sherlock was reluctant to discuss his new friend with me, and yet it was clear that my brother committed the very blunder I had warned him against: he developed feelings for the man. No matter how hard Sherlock tried to hide it, I could see the tell-tale sparkling in his eyes whenever that fellow Dr. John H. Watson was mentioned.
Her remonstrance had a sobering effect, to some extent. Our dear landlady had tolerated and forgiven much over ten years. Nevertheless, there is a limit to everything. Even with her heart of gold she would have to evict me if I didn’t stop. Therefore, leaving would be for the best.
I gazed at him expectantly, confused and a little worried. He was biting his nails, and that habit manifested itself only at the moments of extreme agitation.
He was adamant that my first duty was to recover. Perhaps he was right: if my judgement were clouded, I could easily do more harm than good to my patients, and that would be unacceptable.
Slowly, I walked into the corridor. Muffled groans were coming from upstairs, from my bedroom. Holmes was in pain. In a few moments I was by his bedside, lighting a lamp. Holmes was gritting his teeth and moaning in his sleep. When I touched his forehead to check whether he had a fever, he woke up with a start.
“I didn’t know you fancied military men,” John said with a chuckle, trailing caresses along the curve of my neck.
This is clearly irony, yet done so masterfully that it can be taken at face value. Watson is a sly fox, really.
“Firstly, from now on your cheque-book shall be in my keeping. And secondly, you’ll assist me on a case.”
Good god, Holmes, control your thirst! Keep your whispered soft nothings and receiving hard somethings in your bedroom, you two :D But before bedroom Holmes invites Watson on a date, being a gentleman as he is:
“If everything else is to your liking, the papers can be signed tomorrow.” Sherlock passed me a half-smoked cigarette.
So passed a year. Not knowing anything of Sherlock was hard. Frustrating. Tormenting. Mycroft assured me that he was fine, and I had to make do with that.
Meanwhile, John’s interviews appeared in the press less and less frequently. He looked tired in the photographs. I trailed my fingers over his beloved features, tracing the lines on his face I didn’t recognise. And finally, there were no interviews at all, although the stories kept coming. Mycroft sent me ciphered reports from his agents who kept an eye on John. John’s schedule was very full. He had no health problems. That quelled my anxiety but couldn’t dispel it.
My temples throbbed; I breathed in shakily, leaning on my stick. In a few moments the wave passed, and I ascended the stairs.
When Holmes asked about the shape of Shlessinger’s ear, he must have been in London still. He either had known who Green was from the very beginning or quickly got an answer from his client:
“Do I need to remind you that you had better tell the truth, Doctor Watson?” the man said, raising his eyebrow. “For your own good.”
. From Holmes’s POV. But his obvious is showing. In BLAN Holmes tried very zealously to make an impression that Watson and he are estranged. In LION these two cunning gentlemen continue this charade, to protect their privacy, of course, as always. They live quietly together in retirement and have fun by still mystifying their readers.
“Then we are to spend a weekend in the country just for the pleasure of it? My dear Holmes, that’s rather unlike you,” I said, raising my eyebrows.
“For God’s sake, you must rest,” I exclaimed. “You’ve lost a great deal of blood; you have a broken collarbone and cracked ribs. You can’t go anywhere right now.”
“How could I lie about when the two of you must be fed?” she parried. “But now that my mind is at peace, I’ll follow doctor’s orders.”
Clara shrugged her shoulders and did as she was told. I examined the clock closely, trying to employ Holmes’s methods. It was a fine JJ Elliott clock in a square wooden case, relatively inexpensive and thus affordable to an average lower middle class family. The glass dial cover was shattered and a big crack ran across the left side of the case. The back panel arrested my attention—it had been crudely forced.
“This house obviously hasn’t been lived in for years,” I said. “And not even rented out to vacationing people, otherwise it would have been kept more presentable. Nevertheless, its owner cares for it enough to prevent its descent into disrepair: the ceiling in the hall and the stairs have been skillfully renovated not long ago. Perhaps the house holds some special meaning for the owner. Also, the owner must be quite well off—to look after such property while not using it must be costly.”
“You are going too far,” John demurred. “He supported you all this time. He did what he deemed best to protect you, even if it included keeping me in the dark. You’re judging him too harshly. He too is human.”
“But it’s true.” His eyes were earnest. “My colleagues even held a consultation on the matter—there’s nothing wrong with me except that I forget to eat and have bouts of insomnia. I worked, worked as much as I could because I dreaded idle hours. You said once that work was the best antidote to sorrow.”
“It must be a concussion,” I said. “No wonder, with such bruises on your head. Can you remember your name?”
“Carry on then,” Lestrade said and slammed the door shut. “Really, she’s like a jack-in-the-box, that old hag.”
“Rumour has it and Doctor Watson’s writings confirm that you can understand much from very little, sir. My grandchildren and I love to play charades, you see.” Mrs. Langley lowered her eyes and smiled.
To spare him the necessity of going to the bathroom afterwards, I pulled out and slipped my prick between his thighs. It didn’t take me long to finish. In a few thrusts my own crisis swept over me like a flash while John was whispering to me encouraging gentle nothings. It was glorious.
Having wrapped ourselves into sheets, we went back to the cooling-room. Supper was already served on the small table by the sofa. The smell emanating from under the dish covers was exquisite. My Watson rubbed his hands eagerly. He was happy, and nothing could please me more.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. You were absolutely right in coming for me,” I replied, clamping down my panic with an effort.
“I am already an accomplice, aren’t I? If I’m arrested, I’m done for anyway. One hardly gets back out of Her Majesty’s prison with such charges.”
“Well?” I whispered into John’s ear as we watched the sharp black silhouette move against the brightly lit background.
“No, Doctor,” Holmes muttered. “As you must have noticed, I have a history with it. Now I need all my faculties to be as sharp as possible.”
” (which indeed would have saved a lot of trouble and possibly Mr. Cubitt’s life if she had chosen to share the problem with him), Mr. Cubitt says:
borrowing becomes awkward because for a man who prefers to solve cases avoiding leg work it’s rather out character. As they proceed with their plan at night, we learn that Poirot visited the blackmailer’s house earlier under a false identity to ensure an easy access later. No, he didn’t get engaged to a maid but fooled the housekeeper. Points to Holmes for using his charm. Points to Poirot for not breaking a girl’s heart. I guess he didn’t have the looks?
“You had already been aware of your brother’s opinion, but those scribblings only made you feel bitter towards him. That was never my intention.”
Perhaps it’s the whole point of choosing this case for publication over many others. The plot is hardly original: there’s the same method of diversion—luring a person away under some pretext—which was first used in RED, then in STOCK, and in RETI. Which means that it’s not the case itself that matters, but its circumstances. And they are rather peculiar. We learn that:
He gazed at me intensely, his blue eyes darkened with lust. His lips were absolutely irresistible; I covered them with mine and ravaged them, divesting John of his clothes. When the kiss ended, he stepped out of the nightshirt pooling around his ankles. The subdued light from the fireplace accented the lines of his body—his powerful shoulders and well-defined arms, his chest and belly covered with gold-brown hair, his sturdy thighs and shapely legs. Indeed, my Watson was perfectly built, stout and muscular. His gorgeous prick stood proudly erect. My own was aching for him, confined uncomfortably by the garments. I undid the flies, took myself in hand, and stroked my prick, devouring John with my eyes.
“As a matter of fact I did, but my diploma was annulled. At the graduation party,” Stamford lowered his voice, “I made a joke about the Queen as we were drinking. Someone reported me the next day. We were all friends, and yet someone reported me.”
Actually, it’s not that surprising, and perhaps by that point Watson was already used to it, since he himself did the same to Holmes all the time (and in this story too).
“You seem to be as keen on geology as before,” I said. “The display of minerals in the hall is astounding.”
“Good God,” I muttered. “His biography almost mirrors mine. I do remember that disillusioned state. Who knows? Had we not met, I could have grown to hate the whole world too.”
There’s also one of the instances of Holmes mentioning Watson’s natural charm when it comes to dealing with people:
None of my past experiences with lovers belonging either to the fair sex or to my own had ever been that intense. It was so right, so natural to kiss him, as if we had spent our entire lives side by side. Perhaps somewhere, at some point, we had.
Thus I started writing up a remarkable case, obscuring the dates and changing the names. The Prince became a King and the actress an opera diva, but the main facts remained intact. The most blatant invention was my marriage, though. Sherlock used to be seriously annoyed by my fictional romance with the client in
“By Jove, you were right. It was worth the wait,” John said a few minutes later, his relaxed features all aglow.
By the small hours my wounded leg—which hadn’t minded mountain hiking in Switzerland—was aching and cramping up. Somehow I found myself in Sherlock’s room. He hadn’t been sleeping there often, preferring to do so in my room with me, but the pillow on his narrow bed still carried his scent. I must have drifted off, for it was already a bleak, grey morning when I was woken by being shaken carefully by the shoulder.
I could barely hold back during the ride to Baker Street, and as soon as the cab came to a halt, I shoved money to the cabby rather unceremoniously and dashed into the house. The moment the front door slammed behind me, tears blurred my vision. I could feel them hot on my cheeks as I bolted up the stairs into the sitting-room. There I collapsed into my armchair, sobs shaking my entire body. I wept uncontrollably the way I had never done before—not even when I had been too late to attend to my mother’s illness or when I had failed to shoot myself at the battlefield, wounded and helpless.
Later, I explained to John how I had escaped. He listened spellbound, and his blue eyes, which had been so lusterless, shone again as he gasped and praised me for my successes. When I was telling him of my darker experiences, the pity in his expression never felt humiliating. He was the only man from whom I could accept it. His loving compassion was a warm, soothing salve for my soul.
We approached a beautiful if somewhat unkempt oak alley which led to a gabled Elizabethan house of worn, weather-beaten granite. The house was in the process of renovation—its left wing looked considerably fresher than the right one—and promised to be a splendid sight once the works were completed.
“At least we’ll get to spend Christmas Eve properly. For the first time in three years,” Sherlock murmured. “Oh, by the way, while I was impersonating St. Nicholas, it occured to me why the first message was a walnut. There is a large collection of nutcracker dolls at Hamleys, and you in your scarlet uniform must have given the sender the idea.”
“Don’t take it to heart, my dear fellow. It was not the first time Mycroft and I had a squabble. He has to be reminded occasionally that I am not his property.”
Despite its shortcomings, that little book had a great deal of value, for it offered a good insight into the doctor’s character. Romantic, self-effacing, he had a dry sense of humour and a knack for obfuscation too. The real circumstances of the case were cleverly disguised. Sherlock’s finest qualities were lauded whereas the darker aspects, such as his mood swings and drug addiction, were glossed over. Sherlock might fail to perceive it, yet the book was a love letter to him. Watson was undeniably a man of passion, and that was what worried me most.
Aware of my mood, Watson was quiet. He hadn’t remonstrated with me regarding my untouched plate at supper and didn’t try to engage me in a conversation. I was rather grateful for that. My companion was the most considerate of men, always putting my needs ahead of his own. And that evening he was steadfastly ignoring the need he had.
. They had nothing to fear, however, for it was all make-believe again. To be more precise, those events had happened before Reichenbach, and they had been carefully orchestrated by Holmes, unlike the fight in Meiringen. Only
“I suppose the excessive attention from the press is a serious impediment to your work.” John chuckled. “Well, I could write something which is not about you—medical stories or even historical novels.”
Watson is shocked by Holmes’s plan to burgle Milverton’s house, not mainly because it’s against the law, but because he’s terrified that it would ruin Holmes. Watson has a physical, visceral reaction to the news:
The thought of the anguish John was being subjected to was gnawing at me, but approaching him in any way other than through Mycroft would be disastrous. At least upon his return to England John would be informed that I was alive—and that was a consolation of sorts.
I’ve finished watching the entire series of Poirot and now am onto some short stories and novels. While Arthur Conan Doyle admitted that Holmes was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s Dupin, Poirot, in his turn, is heavily influenced by Holmes, especially in early works. Let’s have a closer view, taking as examples three short stories.
Here are examples for this story of Watson’s ability to pick up Holmes’s thoughts and feelings without words. He does it with zero fuss, very low-key and matter-of-factly:
It was Sunday, so my surgery was empty, and no one could see Holmes descend the stairs and sneak into the kitchen. I took a fresh issue of
The case was as follows: Mr. Davenheim, a banker, went out to post some letters and wasn’t seen after. The police suspected his business rival who came into his house while Davenheim was out because Davenheim had made an appointment with him. Later it is discovered that the safe in Davenheim’s study was forced and jewellery stolen from it.
The Irregulars departed at about eight o’clock in the evening, with full stomachs and happy with their new outfits.
“Very well, we shall make do with our excellent home-made article.” He rose to his feet. “Come, darling, let me help.”
Nekosmuse suggests that perhaps someone close to Holmes was Milverton’s victim if Holmes reacts so strongly, almost taking it personally. If so, I find the following line even more hilarious:
“So Smith made a tobacco box of special design, with a small syringe hidden in the false bottom. The tip of the needle was cleverly disguised and placed right beside the lock. Smith did away with that poor devil Victor Savage by sending him the box anonymously, and later he tried the same with me. The box is on the mantelpiece, by the way. Don’t touch it.”
Summing up, as I’ve said above, I think this story isn’t quite about the case, but mainly about the relationship.
John let out a long-suffering groan, shaking his head, and we roared with laughter. His eyes sparkled, full of mirth, the crinkles in their corners like rays of sun. There were small dimples on his cheeks which had begun to regain their softness. I shall never forget it for as long as I live. Whatever trials life may bring in the future, that warm sunny day in late spring of 1894 shall remain a treasure in my brain-attic.
“Where would you like to go?” I asked him. “Shall we rent a castle in Scotland or perhaps a villa on the southern coast?”
“I’m afraid he died during the night, sir,” I replied. “I operated on him, but his injuries proved to be fatal. The undertaker departed with him an hour ago.”
Later, we shared the afterglow, our bodies pressed together. We were clean and sated, snuggling in our own small world, for we had drawn the curtains of the bedposts. Sherlock nuzzled my neck and breathed in with relish. His lips brushed over my skin as if he wished to say something, but then he sighed.
I dashed to the bookcase, took the camera from the shelf, and snapped a picture of him. Chuckling, Sherlock headed to the door with Mycroft’s heavy tread.
I had no appetite, but I didn’t wish to upset her by skipping the meal she had taken pains to prepare. Then I went upstairs, and there it was, laid out on the bed, the black mourning suit. I had worn it before on several occasions, but now I had to don it for Sherlock. In spite of the dangers our lifestyle involved, I had never envisaged this.
3) Certain types of gold bracelets symbolised engagement and marriage in the late Victorian era. More about it
“That is appallingly obvious,” Mycroft returned with a raised eyebrow. “Spend another month recuperating, Sherlock, and then there are several problems I should bring you which might benefit from your attention.”
Despite the instinctive fear each citizen had for the authorities, something in me rebelled. Call it my will or my foolishness, but something in me refused to be intimidated in my own surgery.
Holmes had been in one of his subdued moods even before the influenza outbreak, but when I became extremely busy with patients, he withdrew into his shell. A new case brought no change: absorbed in the investigation, Holmes barely spoke at all. With my consulting hours extended and the ever-increasing number of house calls, I had little energy left in the evenings. My feeble attempts at conversation would usually fall flat.
“Martha, hot water and more bandages, quick!” I yelled to the maid, grasping a packet of freshly sterilised instruments from the boiler.
I racked my brain for a means to accomplish it without endangering his mission. Some clandestine channels wouldn’t do: I would certainly bungle any step in that direction, for codes and ciphers were Sherlock’s forte, not mine. If I had a forte, what was it? Beside medicine, a thing that I could do relatively well was… At first the idea seemed mad. But the more I thought of it, the more it made sense.
There are cases I chronicle not for the sake of publishing but to preserve fond memories associated with them. Then the painstaking editing is unnecessary, and everything can be told as it was.
There I sat in a stupor and didn’t hear at first that someone was talking to me. A pat on my shoulder snapped me out of my reverie. It was a street urchin of about ten years old, grubby and barefoot.
And so I sallied forth. Smith refused to receive me, and when I barged into his house, I realised why Holmes needed my help. This was a Goliath of a man, about six feet and six inches, sunburned, all rippling muscle. Luckily, he was too happy to hear that Holmes was at death’s door or I would have been defenestrated.
Twilight descended outside, and gas lamps were being lit one by one, spreading their yellow glow, when my patient finally stirred and groaned. The stranger’s eyes flew open, and he took in the room with a blurry gaze. In a few moments he seemed to realise that he wasn’t dreaming; his grey eyes regained their focus, their expression becoming sharp and alarmed. With a jerk, he tried to sit up and cried out in pain.
“Perhaps for the New Year instead?” Sherlock pressed my hand. “But for now, we must stay in London to prevent an explosion at Hamleys.”
“Don’t think about it, Sherlock. Don’t think at all. Just live the present moment, love,” John said softly.
When I checked on him in the morning, he was peacefully asleep, which was a good sign. It was going to be another busy day; my first patients were already in the consulting-room, but suddenly there was a clatter of a carriage outside, and then loud knocking on the door. It was highly irregular, for the people I treated didn’t come in carriages. I looked out of the window, and a cold shiver ran down my spine. It was a black brougham, one of those so dreaded in the city. Her Majesty’s Special Division. When people were taken away in such a carriage, they never returned.
It was half past three in the morning as Holmes and I were rattling along empty streets, blinds drawn, almost dozing off in each other’s arms. Our work was done and we were happy that many people, including our clamorous young friends, were now safe.
Of course the doctor does notice the details of the crime scene, etc, and undoubtedly ACD used this device to give readers a clear image of Holmes, but what he achieved was ultimately incredibly slashy.
He propped himself up by his left arm and hissed in pain as cramps ran through his shoulder. I helped him into a comfortable position and kneaded the area around his bullet scar, pressing gently at the knot just above his shoulder blade until the tension melted away and John sighed with relief.
“Let’s not talk about it,” I said soothingly. “Better tell me about that peculiar method of yours—how you figured out I’d been to Afghanistan.”
I did as I was told. He gazed at me admiringly, as if I were a marble statue at an exhibition. My cheeks burned, but it was strangely exciting and titillating to be watched by my John in this fashion. At last, he undid his trousers and drawers and divested himself of them. His cock was standing rigidly, its flushed head glistening with moisture. The next moment John was on top of me, positioning himself between my legs. I was out of my mind with lust, for he had kept his scarlet tunic on.
(1922), doesn’t it? Although otherwise it’s an original story, with nothing else in common with THOR.
Chronology sets the case in 1899, but since it was published in 1904, I doubt that it happened so late into Holmes’s career.
He snuggles closer to me in his sleep, and I kiss the top of his head. His hand is resting upon my chest. The bracelet on his wrist peeks from under the cuff of his nightshirt. He is my conductor of light. Darkness cannot devour me while we are together.
In the beginning of July I moved out from Baker Street to a place I found in Kensington. Mrs. Hudson accepted my decision with kind understanding, even though it visibly saddened her.
Another interesting detail is that Murdoch is a math teacher and ACD makes him a prime suspect. As we remember, Moriarty was a mathematician too. It must have sprang from ACD’s distaste for math.
At first I managed to stay in touch with Mrs. Hudson via notes, but within a week or so I found myself too tired to scrawl even a few words. I would drag myself to bed well after midnight and drop asleep instantaneously.
For the rest of the time he chatted about opera, recent inventions, and electricity, his eyes twinkling, perfectly aware of my attempts to read him and failing to do so. It clearly pleased him that after all these years he hadn’t lost his ability to mystify me.
Growing more and more absorbed in our plans for the future, we talked till nightfall. By then our excitement was so great that it put to a severe test the integrity of the rickety bed in our room upstairs. We entertained serious concerns that it might fall apart. At one point we abandoned it, for the creaking was intolerable, but eventually we had to sleep. By some miracle it was still intact in the morning.
In August I received a letter with a New York stamp. It was from Mary. She expressed her condolences and asked how I was, so we corresponded for a while. Thankfully, she didn’t mind our fictional marriage and wrote that no one had made a connection between her and the heroine of the book. Perhaps my obfuscation methods weren’t that ineffective.
“Anything to indulge my little brother,” Mycroft said, chuckling. “It should be amusing so long as he doesn’t write about my rooms.”
Writing short stories instead of full-length novels would be faster and easier. I had been entertaining the possibility for a while already. Weaving a special message into the fabric of the narrative should not be very difficult. A deliberate inaccuracy in the circumstances of a case would draw his attention, and he would realise instantly the secret meaning of a phrase which for anyone else would be just a part of the story.
I felt him smile against my hole. He reached for the vaseline jar and anointed my entrance thoroughly. Then he rose and led me to the foot of the bed. I rested my hands on the footboard, supported myself firmly upon it and, tingling with anticipation, bent my back. He caressed me between the shoulder blades; his hand slid down and grasped me by the hip, and then his cock was pushing into my hole. Sparks of intense pleasure permeated me as he was stretching me inch by inch, taking his time. He knew what it would do to me, knew that I would be reduced to whimpering in bliss by being breached in such a fashion. His cock pressed in, in, slick and hard, making my body sing. I was biting my lips, losing my self-control. Of all carnal delights in my life, giving myself to my beloved has been one of the most sensual experiences from the very first time. Only with him I realised what true closeness is.
Mrs. Hudson was right in sending me to the barber: wielding a razor with a tremor in my hands would not have been wise. My mourning attire was done in irrevocably. Wearing it could not reflect what I felt anyhow, so upon disrobing I hurled it into the corner.
My interview with the lavatory finished, I was too exhausted to walk. I crawled back to the sitting-room on all fours, hoping that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t see me. It took the remains of my energy to climb onto the sofa, and then I remembered no more.
“Good Heavens, no more chemicals in our sitting-room! My dream will come true,” I exclaimed. “By the way, the attic could be used for storing your materials quite literally.”
Unlike the perceptive Mrs. St. Clair (TWIS), Mrs. Davenheim is described in rather unflattering terms:
As always, Watson can read Holmes without words, by touch. He produces a powerful effect on readers when he describes Holmes reading him, but he himself does it to Holmes all the time:
We parted on amicable terms, which was a great relief. I paused outside the door, waiting for John, who was following me out of Mycroft’s study, when Mycroft called after him.
The issues with Holmes’s health must have been pretty serious indeed if Watson needed a second opinion to diagnose him, and moreover, to persuade him to drop everything and get some rest. It was Holmes’s personal record in disregarding his own well-being if some other doctor besides his own had to
A two-mile ride back to our secluded house was especially beneficial in helping to settle our dinner. Spurred on by a spirit of competition, we raced like boys up and down the grassy hills, bantering and teasing each other. It left us quite winded, so upon our return we dropped onto the bench in the wild garden to recover our breath. It was heartwarming to think that soon we would finally have our countryside sanctum, as we had so long desired. The prospect of extensive renovation works wasn’t discouraging in the least. That could be done gradually, and we would be able to mold everything to our tastes. The house provided for far more possibilities than our Baker Street flat ever could.
If in the beginning of ‘A Study in Scarlet’ Holmes used to ask Watson to let him use the sitting-room when clients came, now he doesn’t even consider taking on a case without his companion. They’ve come such a long way!
Enraptured, John pushed himself towards me, taking my prick in as deep as he could and wiggling his arse. He got what he wanted—my glans titillated the innermost nerve-endings within him while my girth rubbed his prostate. I kept shoving my cock into his hungry hole, rolling my hips and grinding into him.
Wiggins assured me he wouldn’t tell a soul and didn’t object to being driven to the station blindfolded. Alone in the room again, I sank down onto the chair. What exactly had transpired between Mycroft and John if John had reacted in that fashion? Or what if Mycroft had disregarded my request? I needed to
Like many before me, having encountered mentions of this affliction in ACD’s works, as well as in a number of Victorian novels, I thought, what on earth is that? Google offered a variety of versions from a non-existent condition to a severe nervous breakdown, so it was really fun to find what ACD himself wrote on the matter in one of his medical stories:
“Please calm yourselves,” I said, walking into the parlour. “It’s rather complicated to explain, but I am no ghost.”
I sat in my armchair by the fire, smoking, as the first day at home without Sherlock was drawing to a close. Our sitting-room hadn’t suffered much from the arson, and thanks to Mrs. Hudson’s endeavours, changes were hardly noticeable, although Sherlock would have begged to differ, no doubt. The cushion in his vacant armchair was rumpled, and his old clay pipe lay on the mantelpiece. His violin was in the corner, half-hidden under music sheets with an unfinished air he had been composing. Everything spoke of his presence, as if he were here, in London, and not… I sprang to my feet and paced around the room, struggling to shake off the image of the roaring stream and sharp rocks, of the smudged footsteps on the path, of the horrible, bottomless abyss. But my thoughts kept running in circles. I shouldn’t have left Sherlock there alone. I should have seen through the ruse. Or I should have insisted that he come with me. How utterly stupid and blind I had been.
“You know that you’re the first and the only man I’ve had, Sherlock,” said I. “It all started with an innocuous chat at the club when the Colonel was in London on an errand, about five months ago. We discussed our lives as civilians, and, naturally, when I described mine, I spoke of you. Perhaps I was less cautious than I should have been, relaxed by a glass of brandy, or perhaps he was more perceptive, being of the same feather—well, he understood. He was surprised at my being inclined this way and told me he had found me attractive even in our army days, but never considered that I might be interested.”
The table was set in my study so that we could talk without the risk of being overheard in the Stranger’s Room. At half-past six there was a tap at the door, and the butler announced the doctor’s arrival. I could see from Watson’s fatigued face that he had had a busy day. He glanced at me warily as I waved him into the chair opposite to me.
“We’ll have a chance to talk to that person later. As for the messages, it was a long shot in the beginning. The first one didn’t tell me much, but it was enough to draw my attention. When you received the second one, I became almost certain it was a coded warning. Both you and I immediately arrived at the simplest inference it suggested: a time bomb. The hands were set at three o’clock, possibly for a purpose, which would mean that the explosion was to occur in the afternoon or in the dead of night. If so, where and when? And why did the sender approach you rather than me if it was in my line of work?”
By alighting at Canterbury we got rid of our chasers and from there traveled onward through Europe incognito, as discreetly as possible. On the day of the trial, however, I received a message from Mycroft. My worst apprehensions were fulfilled: Moriarty had escaped. On the one hand, it would be logical for him to try to salvage the remains of his organisation abroad. On the other, knowing his personality, he was sure to have his revenge upon me first.
“Absolutely none, unless the client presses charges. Can’t wait to wash my hands of this whole affair.”
“Fenton the cut-throat and Parker the garroter,” I said, frowning, having recognised the description of the gang’s henchmen. “It would be prudent if you took some time off from your work.”
“I shall not benefit from this,” I said, hurling the paper into the grate. “It will be better if everything goes to next of kin.”
I helped him to a glass of water and examined him. Nothing was amiss, but healing could be a tough process—which was certainly the case. I hated seeing Holmes suffer.
“You lead a retired life, don’t you, Colonel?” Holmes asked as the three of us were chatting merrily at the table.
And I was there to pick up the pieces. All of my reasoning fell on deaf ears; Sherlock didn’t listen to any of it. He took to drugs. He ran off with an amateur theatre company and traipsed around the country for a year, until he became of age and could receive his part of the humble inheritance from our parents. Without a degree, without systematic education, without much knowledge of the world Sherlock decided that he would be a private investigator. To work with the police! To be mixed up in various sordid matters, such as thefts, blackmailing, and murders! Definitely not a career a gentleman should pursue. I was outraged yet unable to do anything about it. At that point we almost stopped to communicate.
Holmes entered in a flurry of energy, like a powerful gust of wind. His eyes lit up with satisfaction when he spotted me lounging on the sofa.
Mrs. Langley fidgeted anxiously, and Holmes put a calming hand upon her shoulder. She nodded, visibly more at ease.
By noon my surgery was as busy as ever. Those of my patients who had witnessed Holmes’s dramatic arrival the previous day were curious about him and full of questions. I told them only that he was gone, avoiding further elaborations.
Within twenty-four hours I had reached Lyons, found the hotel, and been ushered to his room. The room was dimly lit, heavy curtains drawn on the windows. A huge heap of unopened telegrams littered the floor just inside the door.
I took out my notebook and started to write, considering my options. There weren’t many: I had a chance only by engaging Moriarty in hand-to-hand combat, so that Moran couldn’t shoot. Then perhaps I would manage to use my weapons.
To tell the truth, I wasn’t sure whether the Colonel’s invitations had been just friendly—that’s why I had declined them while they had been for me alone. But since in the latest letter the Colonel wrote that he would be glad to receive Holmes as well, I surmised there would be no harm in it. My partner would have much-needed recreation in the country, and his presence would spare me the awkwardness of having to refuse any unwanted advances.
“I’m not holding you here against your will,” I said. “The question is, are you recovered enough to go?”
3. Watson, however, is too a determined fellow to give up that easily. He’s so protective of his Holmes. Holmes is amused and apologetic. Note “our peace” and “our cottage”, oh this possessive case again:
“Was it only the smell of lye soap which led you to the conclusion it was the charwoman?” I asked Holmes in astonishment.
We both chuckled and started to descend from the hilltop. A steep rocky path winding between the cliffs was the only way down to the beach. One had to be most careful to watch every step lest one slip on the loose pebbles which were strewn all along it. Any lack of attention could easily result in a sprained ankle or injured knees at best.
In Paris we had an hour between the trains. We secured a whole compartment to ourselves once more. There were not many people on the platform, so we could stretch our legs and smoke at ease. Although Sherlock soon tired, it was beneficial, for he slept soundly during our journey to Calais. In fact, he went on sleeping after the ferry, all the way through, leaning on me, his cheek burrowed into my shoulder. Insomnia seemed to have been replaced by the opposite extreme.
In a couple of days we found ourselves on the train again. As before, Sherlock spent most of the journey asleep, curled up into my side. Upon our arrival the Colonel met us with the trap at the station. Dressed as a typical country squire, he still had the air of a military man. Civilian life hadn’t affected his immaculate posture. I had noted that even during our meeting at the club. Indeed, he hadn’t changed much over the past six years. Now the Colonel must have been in his early forties; his auburn hair had become slightly grizzled, and there were a few more crow’s feet at the corners of his shrewd hazel eyes, but his moustache and side-whiskers were as ever regulation trim, and his stocky figure fit.
The same evening John and I sat in our armchairs, smoking and relishing the peace and quiet of our home. I was thumbing through my correspondence while John was lost in thought, evidently pondering the recent transaction.
What I can’t stop thinking about is how heavily coded many of ACD’s works are. Not only Holmes stories and novels—other short stories and novels too. This simply can’t be a coincidence.
My brother is alive. He managed to slip away at the last moment. He is working under an assumed identity, for it turned out to be only the beginning. Don’t attempt to do anything—it will ruin both him and yourself. Do not share this with anyone, including your landlady.
I led him to the consulting-room and had him recline on the couch. An examination showed that he had a mild tachycardia and a somewhat elevated temperature.
Again and again we see that Watson is essential for Holmes’s success, that he is an equal partner on whom Holmes can always rely.
In a few heartbeats, Moran pressed the trigger. The sound of the shot was barely audible—no wonder no one had heard it on such a busy street as Park Lane—and there was a clang of broken glass in the distance. That was the cue for me to charge. I jumped forward and grabbed Moran, my blood boiling. At that moment I was ready to kill him. Moran dropped the gun and fell flat under my weight, but before I knew it our positions were reversed. I was on the floor, Moran’s iron grip around my throat and his sharp knees digging into my stomach. It was a horrid realisation: years of neglecting my health had taken their toll and now my quarry was stronger than I. But in the next instant, John had knocked Moran out with a hit on the head and dragged him off of me.
Later Watson mentions Holmes’s eyes again. It seems like Watson indeed pays more attention to Holmes than to anything else in the room:
I had to shake it off. Someone needed my help. I groped around and picked up a crude stick which I could use to walk. I trudged slowly to the marketplace, calling out for the injured. Thankfully, there weren’t many, and the injuries were minor, mostly bruises and abrasions. After I was done, I walked around the block, but there was no trace of Holmes.
“You could let me kill the Inspector and try to apprehend me, Holmes. But no, you and the doctor are too noble for that, of course,” Saville sneered. “Then I shall accomplish something even the great Professor Moriarty could not. What a way to go!”
The shortness of our stay chagrined the Colonel, although he was impressed to have seen Holmes in action and glad of his speedy recovery.
Once we had climbed the seventeen steps and entered the sitting-room, our hands sought out each other of their own accord. Mrs. Hudson had tended to our sanctum with utmost care. The sitting-room was unusually clean and new carpets replaced those which had burned in the arson, but otherwise there were very few changes. I could see joy tempered with longing and sadness in John’s face, and a tide of the same emotions was about to overpower me. Our home, our safe place, was waiting patiently for us to return. Only with a considerable effort I was able to preserve my composure. There was an important task ahead, and I would need to stay focused.
an emotional attachment to the house, but they are not exactly well off,” I murmured. “And now they are constrained to sell it.”
It seemed that we broke away. I had just drawn a breath of relief when the black carriage emerged on the next crossroads, and this time there was no way out: the slums were huddled so closely together that we couldn’t squeeze into a sidestreet.
It occured to me that Sherlock’s room was the last place in the house I hadn’t searched for alcohol. If he had such a storage, the wardrobe would be the main suspect. I examined the shelves, revolted with myself, yet in a state of some morbid excitement. My hypothesis proved to be correct: there, in the depth, amidst wigs, strange costumes, and regular clothes, a bottle of absinthe was stuck into an old boot. I laughed out loud—my Holmes, a Bohemian soul through and through.
We ate in silence, commiserating with each other. That’s a facet of our relationship which we treasure especially: we often need no words. I’ve never had this with anyone else. When he and I reached out for the teapot simultaneously, our hands touched. It was as if an electric charge ran through my fingertips, spreading across my entire body. For a moment Holmes was very still. He looked at me. Clearly he had felt that too.
“Ah, yes. Mine was ruined due to an unfortunate accident, and the other one I possess is being cleaned at the moment.”
And so, the next evening at the Diogenes we were ushered through the Stranger’s Room to Mycroft’s private study, where we were served a lavish dinner. Ironically, it turned into one of those social gatherings Mycroft and I have abhorred since we were boys: polite empty talk and keeping up appearances for the sake of staying civil. John was visibly awkward too, trying hard to build a bridge between us. Mycroft was extremely pleasant, yet little by little he was steering the conversation towards his agenda.
. Instead I realised I could not write a word. The material to choose from was abundant, but I would sit for hours, staring at a blank page, and it would stare back at me. It was around the same time that Colonel Moriarty published a series of open letters again, defending his brother’s name. Something had to be done. Try as I might, words still wouldn’t come, so there seemed to be the only solution available. I adapted my old article into
I thanked him for his valuable comments which I had no intention of heeding. He seemed to have missed my message to Sherlock, and it was all that mattered.
“Ah, it’s one of those thankless occasions when the client chooses to do nothing even though I gave him all the facts.” Holmes made a frustrated gesture. “In a couple of hours at the most the culprit will be caught, only to be chided and released again. A noble name can’t be dragged through mud, of course.”
“Are you so ready to shelter me, even though you think I am a criminal?” Sherlock Holmes asked in disbelief.
“Easy, easy,” I said quietly, laying him back on the pillow. “You’ve been injured in an accident and required surgery.”
The Baker Street flat remained as it had been thanks to Mycroft’s arrangement and Mrs. Hudson’s efforts. She was provided with sufficient income not to let in any other lodgers. I did visit her sometimes, as promised, and was touched by a new development: to avoid feeling lonely she had started to serve hot lunches for the Irregulars. I continued to look after their health too, and they called on me quite frequently in Kensington, sharing the latest rumours. I also continued my voluntary service at Bart’s, tending to the poor once a week.
The necessity to keep Mrs. Hudson in the dark was heartbreaking. But I could see that it had to be done for her own safety too. Nevertheless, I couldn’t look her in the eye. Living at Baker Street and deceiving her would be impossible, so I decided to find other lodgings as soon as we got back to London.
editor, and the next day it was on the front page. Meanwhile I needed to black out again, to be rid of the thoughts swarming in my head. But it turned out that I had accomplished the feat of depleting all reserves of alcohol in the house. I rang the bell and asked Mrs. Hudson to send Jenny for replenishment.
As an additional safety precaution, I asked Mr. Sidney Paget, an amazingly talented illustrator, not to portray the Holmes brothers and myself with any close resemblance to the originals, having explained my request as a wish for privacy.
The day was balmy, sunlight streaming into the sitting-room through the windows. Birds were chirping outside, their clear voices distinct even in the usual din of the busy street. I was daydreaming, my newspaper tossed aside. Staying indoors on such a lovely day would be a shame, so I was considering a stroll in the Park. But suddenly my musings were interrupted. There was a clang of the front door, and the familiar light, swift steps ascended the stairs.
The twilight had already closed in, and the still busy street was lit by the yellow glow of lamps. I drew down my hat and turned up my collar to avoid being recognised, but apparently an especially pertinacious reporter had been watching the house. He called after me as I walked. When I quickened my pace, he followed me and caught me by the sleeve.
“You are wearing my jacket,” I said, taken aback, as the smoke dissipated a little and I could have a proper look at him.
We had very little time to spend in John’s house: he took his pistol and instructed the maid to keep the lights on in his study until midnight. By half-past nine we were in the appointed spot near Kensington Gardens from whence our cabby drove us to the corner of Cavendish square. Thankfully, that part of the city hadn’t changed much, and I led John on foot to our destination. It was convoluted but the safest way to the empty house which faced our Baker Street flat and which, probability suggested, Moran would choose as his firing position.
A fortnight after our introduction I sent my brougham to Dr. Watson’s surgery with an invitation to dine with me at my club. The message to the doctor stated that the dinner was nothing as formal as to require dress-clothes and that his attendance was requested as soon as his working hours were over. I was certain the doctor would be too intrigued to refuse. Intercepting him in this fashion prevented him from discussing the invitation with Sherlock, and thus my brother had no opportunity to meddle.
“You shall have to arrange one of those private carriages for John and to ensure that he is delivered to Victoria Station. Do it personally,” I said.
“Have you unpacked your bags already, Holmes?” asked the voice I had expected to hear at the other end of the line. “You should run. Save yourself and your lover… for at least a short while.”
Now that the noble lady who killed Milverton had passed away, Watson could publish the story. As he often does in the openings, Watson shows us the atmosphere of domesticity with Holmes:
There was just a hint of irritation behind Mycroft’s suavity, but the very fact that it was noticeable indicated that my brother was in no sweet temper.
Holmes asked the other people in the room, but no one seemed to have seen the person who had placed the crate onto the bench. He warned everyone to stay away, took his stick, and carefully removed the cover from the crate. Inside we discovered a cheap wooden toy shaped as two boxers with dangling arms and a lever which pushed them back and forth. The curious onlookers were disappointed.
I scooped a generous amount of vaseline with my finger and smeared his entrance, playing with the rim and inserting my fingertip just a little, to incite his appetite. He let out an impatient sound, both needy and demanding. Chuckling, I coated the nozzle of the syringe thoroughly with vaseline, and then pushed it carefully past the tight rim of his anus. Holmes gasped, sensitive as ever. I pressed the piston little by little, filling him up with water. Holmes’s breath became deep and slow, but there wasn’t any tension in him; he was relaxed and pliant. Having finished, I put away the syringe, and wrapped my slick fingers around Holmes’s stiff prick. He moaned, his entrance clenched, as I stroked him, fondling his bollocks with the other hand. My own prick hung heavy between my legs. It was sweet torture for us both.
Yesterday, whilst sorting through old documents, I came across a photograph of Holmes in one of his funniest disguises. Upon consulting my journal of the corresponding period, I found that the entries were too concise and didn’t cover all the circumstances of the case, so I decided to write out a proper account.
Holmes shook his head, his gaze full of frustration and distress and... tenderness. I could read it in his eyes: I had become as dear to him as he had to me. He wished me to be safe and that no harm was done to me, just as I wished it for him. Before we knew it we were kissing desperately, clinging to each other like two madmen. I couldn’t believe it. He felt the same. We were criminals even in this—the law prohibited such relations as well as abortions since both prevented the birth of new slaves.
He was sitting in the shabby armchair by the fire, looking very pale and still exhausted. His eyes were heavy-lidded, and his head rested on the back of the armchair.
“You must have heard of this traveller and zoologist making a name for himself by studying various species of animals he comes across while visiting remote parts of the world. With an ambition to gain Darwin’s fame, he planned a grand expedition around the world, counting on the inheritance from his grandfather. Imagine his rage when the grandfather left everything to his nephew instead, and the nephew started to spend the riches on such trivial things as buying a house and sending children to a prestigious school.
“But how did a walnut, a clock, and a figurine lead you to the trail of this anarchist? And who sent them?”
“Jo—Watson!” I exclaimed, having forgotten myself momentarily in my tremendous relief that he was unharmed.
However, in the evening, when John came down dressed in his uniform, all thoughts of the case vanished from my head. Indeed, his uniform was a bit too tight. The scarlet tunic accented his broad shoulders and hugged his waist snugly, showing off his trim, sturdy figure, while the dark blue trousers made his legs seem even longer. The air of raw virility Watson had about him was irresistible. My mouth went dry as I stared.
Why did Watson enjoy the Turkish baths alone? He usually does it with Holmes. Why not this time? It seems that Holmes was too busy, so eventually Watson, needing badly some steam for his bones, decided that waiting until Holmes is in the mood for a break would be too long. Which worked quite nicely: Holmes was reminded not to neglect his Watson. Of course Holmes observed, not without a prickle of jealousy, the way Watson’s boots were fastened and that someone shared the cab with Watson. I think sending Watson to health resorts of the Continent was both an apology and a retaliation on Holmes’s part, since Watson obviously thought they would go together:
“Resuming our discussion of the neighbours, Harold Stackhurst is the owner of the house where we are staying,” Holmes said as we were consuming our hearty meal. “He inherited it from his father together with the estate and another residence, Southerton, about a mile from Fulworth. Stackhurst the elder had been a retired courtier, and his wife, Dame Elizabeth, used to be Her Majesty’s lady-in-waiting. After the father’s passing it became clear that the estate was too expensive to keep up. Stackhurst transformed it into a school, having relocated with his mother to Southerton, which is humbler albeit still quite grand. The smallest house, however, posed a more difficult problem to solve. They had no extra means to maintain it, yet the mother didn’t wish to rent or sell it because of the pleasant memories associated with it. The situation became so dire that Stackhurst auctioned practically all of the furnishings from the house to provide the repairs it required.”
John held his breath when Moran entered the room where we were hiding. We crouched in our corner, watching him assemble an air-gun of peculiar design. As he took aim, John squeezed my hand hard. His temptation to attack was obviously as great as mine, but we needed Moran to make a shot so that the evidence against him in the Adair case would be complete.
I slapped him on the cheeks lightly to bring him to his senses. Wiggins grunted with displeasure, stirred, and nearly fell from the chair he had been deposited on. His eyes flew open; cursing, he sat upright and blinked like an owl. As his gaze regained its focus and halted upon me, Wiggins gave a violent start.
“Considering the Wilde ordeal last year, should we need to get out of town in a hurry again, at least we’ll have our own place,” I remarked.
Mycroft chose the fifth of May for his inopportune visit. This was one of his gravest miscalculations, as rare as they were. His conduct towards John had been infuriating. Still rather raw over John’s account, I wasn’t ready to receive him. There was no choice, however, as he arrived within fifteen minutes of his telegram.
“I’m not of the drinking kind, but that night I needed a glass of brandy. I went to the nearest pub, and great Heavens above, Dr. Watson was there too! I sometimes see you both at the gymnasium, sirs, but I would never dare to bother you with an idle conversation. Even with a pressing matter I didn’t have the heart to approach you, Doctor. Your uniform reminded me of the toy soldiers and nutcrackers at Hamleys, and on the spur of the moment I dropped a walnut into your hat.
At last Swinsby gave us a bundle of letters. Holmes checked the contents, counted every piece of paper, and nodded.
, Holmes had no problem with turning down them both. On the other hand, if Holmes worked in intelligence for more than a decade to protect his country, that would be more like him.
Kneading my buttocks, Holmes lowered himself to his knees and took my prick into his mouth—at first only the head—sucking at it gently and teasing it with his tongue. He elicited from me a low, guttural moan. It felt amazing, yet I yearned for more. Holmes looked up at me, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. His lips stretched as he swallowed my engorged member to its base. The hot wetness of his mouth was heavenly. Bobbing his head up and down, he sucked me with obscene slurping noises, his cheeks hollowed. Engulfed in pleasure, I ran my fingers through his hair and caressed him behind the ear. He hummed contentedly, sucking harder. When we had just met, he had already been fairly experienced in it, even though he had been out of practice for years, since the university. By now he had mastered the art of sucking cock to perfection. In spite of myself, I began to rock my hips, disrupting his rhythm, and he let me fuck his mouth. Holding his head lovingly, I did so with relish; the tip of my prick pushed against the back of his throat, but my Holmes took it masterfully until I was on the verge of the peak again.
“Oh?” I put the novel aside, surprised, for we had had a hearty lunch only an hour before. “Well, maybe Mrs. Hudson will make some sandwiches.”
“The way you obfuscate the dates is ineffective,” Mycroft remarked when he was done. “Anyone slightly observant will realise that the case took place not in 1888 but definitely before the Marriages Act of 1886 came into force. Then your supposed marriage: if memory serves, in your previous novel you state that you met your future wife in September of 1888 whereas in this story you are already married by March. Certainly that will raise some questions. There are also other details in the need of correction, but it might result in a complete rewrite and could ruin the story. At any rate, this entertaining piece of fiction shouldn’t do any harm.”
For a split second I was too startled to move. The next instant, just as I was about to kick him in the bollocks and push him away, there was a blinding flash and the sound of a camera clicking.
“The clock was owned by a neat and diligent person until some unfortunate incident. It takes considerable violence to damage so badly such a sturdy specimen. Is this incident connected to the presence of gunpowder inside the clock? What about yesterday’s walnut episode? What is relevant and what is not? There’s much to think about.”
At midnight, armed and prepared, we set out to Regent Street on foot. In half an hour, as we were approaching Hamleys, we turned onto Kingly Street and stopped by the servant’s entrance of the house adjacent to the store. Holmes tapped on the door and we were let in at once.
“For you, by all means, but I’d best not visit a public place. Remember, I might be a carrier of the influenza. It won't do for me to spread it any further.”
”. Afraid of being discovered by the manager, they steal the remains of the company’s money and flee.
The meeting with my army friends in a pub was merry. It was good to know that everybody present was in good health and content with their occupations, most of them married and raising children. They were rather amused by my showing up in the uniform. It prompted vivid reminiscences which complemented each other and just had to be written down. I took notes, contemplating a collection of stories about those rough-and-tumble days, but then the conversation drifted to Holmes’s return. Answering numerous questions as truthfully as possible without giving away too much, I was warmed by the thought that he was waiting for me at home.
, and myself where we all were exasperated by certain scholars who suggest that Holmes slept with Agatha (
The first one is another example of Holmes’s empathy, and the second is that Holmes came to Watson’s room late at night, and then Watson
Billy stopped abruptly and flung up his arms, his face livid. Mrs. Hudson tossed off the newspaper she had been reading and sank into the chair beside the table. Jenny stuck the mop so violently into the bucket that some water splashed over the brim.
“Thank you, Watson,” Holmes said, turning from his bench of chemicals. “I was too busy to do it, and the atmosphere has become somewhat stale.”
“The library can serve as our shared study,” he continued in delight. “We shan’t need any live-in servants, I suppose. With all the conveniences, a daytime housekeeper should do. Therefore, the servants’ room can be made into a chemical lab.”
The house was surrounded by a beautiful orchard, well-tended and obviously cared for with love. Both spouses must have put their hearts into it. The four walls often became too oppressive, and then I would roam among the trees and flowers which were in full summer bloom. Life ebbed and flowed as if nothing had happened. Its exuberance was poignant.
At Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson welcomed us excitedly, proud of Holmes’s success, yet worrying about his still-emaciated state. There was warmth in Holmes’s eyes as he greeted her. His expression brightened the moment he stepped over the threshold of our flat, and his bearing became visibly less strained, as though a considerable weight were lifted off his chest.
John said it as one utters marriage vows. I drew him to myself and claimed his lips—something I would never dare to do outside in the city.
“Yes, sorry about that,” I replied ruefully. “On the bright side, we can go to Surrey. Our host will be most discreet.”
It was unbearable to stay in the bedroom, so I went down to the sitting-room. I paced from corner to corner, looking at the clock and biting my nails. I prayed that John would return soon and relieve me from my agony. Minutes slowly ticked away, seemingly endless. Smoking wasn’t a good distraction. I gnawed at my black clay pipe, knowing that John favoured it too and held it between his lips as often as I did.
My brother laughed heartily, for another brief moment allowing his heart to govern his mind, but then his feelings were quickly subdued by the reason which he so valued.
He must have had somewhere an absinthe spoon too, but I didn’t look for it. I didn’t even look for a glass. The bittersweet, fragrant taste of the green fairy overwhelmed my senses. The surroundings grew warmer and warmer, and then it was so hot that I began to sweat.
In the morning we ate the leftovers from our supper, and Sherlock proposed that we go to the beach. The weather was as wonderful as it had been on the previous day, and we strolled leisurely along the thyme-scented downs, basking in the summer sun. The sea air itself seemed more substantial and richer than the thin aether of the city. Just breathing freely was a true pleasure. Sometimes we would observe a few bees whiz past us in the grass, and Sherlock would regale me with amusing facts about them. Apiculture had piqued his curiosity some months before, so he had been reading voraciously on the subject ever since.
Even though Mycroft Holmes’s manner wasn’t overtly hostile any longer, he was still authoritative and quite intimidating.
I believed my calculations to be exact: Moran was the kind of a man who acted swiftly. My arrival in broad daylight should have prompted him to do so. There was nothing he desired more than to have his revenge on me. But hours ticked away, passers-by were fewer and fewer in the street, making the policemen conspicuous, yet there was no sign of the Colonel. What if he had seen through my plan? What if he had realised that such a blatant display in the window was a set-up? How would he strike then? Had I placed John in grave danger again?
“John, you mentioned that you considered moving to the country too upon your return to England,” said Sherlock.
At first glance, there was nothing out of the ordinary inside. Without a magnifying glass I couldn’t determine whether the metal lid protecting the mechanism had been tampered with. Then I sensed a familiar chemical scent and noticed something black at the bottom of the wooden case. As I tilted the clock carefully, tiny particles spilled out onto the surface of my desk. My heart skipped a beat at the sight of gunpowder.
Alas, the curiosity of the public did not subside. We were pursued by reporters when we visited St. James’s Hall, Simpson’s, and even the Turkish bath in Northumberland Avenue. People shouted, requesting new stories and demanding that we sign their copies of
John was once the more stable of us two, but that was no longer the case. Quietly, he sank down onto the edge of the settee beside me and hid his face in his hands. He was coping no better than I. It was all my doing, and I hated myself for it. We had been so happy that morning, having woken together after a night of lovemaking, and now we were both miserable.
By his return I was dressed again and had packed into my valise everything necessary. The cab was at the door; we set out, sharing the thrill of our forthcoming adventure. Although we knew how it would unfold, there was still an element of danger in it, for what we were about to do was considered a crime in our country. We broke the law quite regularly in the safety of our flat, in our double bed upstairs, keeping quiet. Our household was aware of our relationship, of course. The state of sheets alone was the most damning evidence, not to mention that it was nigh impossible to be on guard all the time, regarding with caution every glance or word that passed between us. Yet it still wouldn’t do to disturb the people who lived under the same roof with us, no matter how loyal they were.
“Take a seat, Mrs. Langley, and make yourself comfortable,” Holmes greeted her with an easy courtesy, motioning her to the sofa. “Watson, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Ellen Langley, who works as a charwoman at Hamleys and at the gymnasium you and I attend.”
“I have the surest remedy for you, Doctor,” she said, hurried to the kitchen, and returned with a glass of a concoction which I hadn’t encountered since leaving Edinburgh for London in my youth.
A retriever? Seriously? You’re so besotted, man, that you don’t even care that your obvious is showing.
But I wanted him to forget about control, to become undone. I slid my finger across his perineum, from his bollocks to his puckered entrance. Nice and clean, it wasn’t yet slickened with vaseline. He hadn’t used the toy yet, just as I had thought. I pressed my fingertip in, but only just, teasing him. He went completely still as I traced and caressed his rim with my fingers. John gripped my shoulder with a quiet groan and pulled his prick out of my mouth. His hand slipped into the pocket of his dressing-gown, whence he produced a small vaseline tin and passed it to me.
I lunged at Moriarty, cutting off his tirade. We wrestled furiously: his grip was vise-like and his strength equalled mine. He tried to snatch the pistol from my pocket, and as I thwarted his attempts, we drew closer and closer to the edge of the cliff. The raging stream was surrounded by mist, countless tiny droplets soaking our hair, our faces, our clothes. Locked in a clinch, we grappled, balancing on the slippery path. When Moran’s bullet whistled past my head, I dodged instinctively. At the same instant Moriarty attacked again. The momentum sent us hurtling onto the ground and we tumbled over the edge. I grasped the sharp rocks, but Moriarty was a heavy burden and so we were sliding down fast. He started trying to climb up, clinging to my shoulders and pushing me into the abyss. My bleeding hands would soon give way. I kicked him with all my might until he let go and fell, screaming. Before my fingers lost their grip entirely, I directed my body towards the ledge I had noticed. The impact knocked the breath out of me and bruised my side badly. Yet I survived.
When I came back home, I did relate the details to Holmes, in spite of the silliness of the whole thing.
“What would you say to soaking in a fragrant bath?” Sherlock asked after we had lazed about some more.
—When the carriage arrived, I was ready, at least outwardly. The moment Mrs. Hudson and I walked out, we were accosted by a swarm of reporters. Some hailed cabs and followed the carriage to the small chapel where the service was to take place. Mycroft Holmes must have foreseen such a development: at the chapel’s gate plainclothes policemen barred the vultures from entering the consecrated ground.
I might still have a chance to rectify my lack of assurance, and for that I had to stay alive. I examined my surroundings, searching for anything I could turn to my favour, any point of advantage. Under the edge of the cliff there was a small ledge where it might be theoretically possible to cling and hide, albeit a refuge that would require considerable dexterity, effort, and luck to utilise.
John gave me a long, intense gaze—he clearly realised that there had been attempts on my life as well and that I hadn’t told him about it. I covered his hand with mine in a promise to be cautious and imploring him to do the same.
So I summoned him and he was unable to refuse. We met in the morning in the comfortable hotel room he had settled into upon arriving. Mycroft glared at me, miffed by the lack of sleep.
I woke up to a pleasant soreness in my body. My eyes closed, I stretched luxuriously; the bed gave a sharp squeak of protest.
. It’s somewhat disappointing, especially from a female author. In comparison, ACD, in spite of his prejudices towards women, created an image of a spirited, strong-willed woman who doesn’t despair but takes effective measures to find her husband.
John had been justified in his apprehension and reluctance. His writings re-opened the wounds which had just started to skin over. And yet revisiting the past cleaned them, providing for a proper healing. At last the suppressed tension between us began to melt away.
John and I left the house separately, for we were aware that our Baker Street rooms were still under observation. John drove to his Kensington practice in full view, while I slipped out of the back door as carefully as possible. It was necessary to maintain the illusion that I was remaining at home. I made for the stables nearby and engaged a trusted cabby, an old acquaintance, to drive me after John and then drop me off one block away from John’s surgery, which I entered very discreetly. Meanwhile the cabby proceeded on to Scotland Yard and delivered my note to Lestrade.
Heat was spreading in my lower belly, my prick hardening at the image of John, the debonair officer. I craved him, his scent, his taste, his body against mine; I wished to be full of him and feel him move inside me. It was maddening.
“She will be all right. I prescribed her rest until tomorrow. Her blood pressure was too high but it should return to normal,” I said softly.
Not five minutes later I had reason to bless John’s foresight, for we heard a door open and close far off, on the ground floor. As furtive, careful steps approached, echoing in the corridor, my limbs quivered with a nervous tension I couldn’t subdue.
As we lie in our bed, my mind is still racing in spite of the late hour, reflecting on everything that had happened to us. I keep marvelling at John’s heart. Misfortunes and misery tend to turn one into a bitter cynic—to some extent, I myself am an example of that—but not John. Ever the romantic, he stubbornly chooses to see the good in people and believes that kindness can make the world a better place.
In the hot room we lounged side by side, our hearts pounding. John’s wet hair stuck to his forehead, sweat trickling down his eyebrows and moustache. Being more accustomed to high temperatures, he bore the heat better than me, though, for I felt like I was about to melt. Yet it was necessary to expel the remains of our ailments. We kissed and frigged each other lazily, too languid for anything more. After a while, giving my pulsing cock an affectionate squeeze, John declared that the maximum therapeutic effect was achieved. I was only glad to defer to his professional opinion.
After a short while I regained command of my faculties and made for the cab stand which was some hundred yards from the Adair residence. Cabbies were reluctant to drive such an odd-looking character until I showed them money and promised a generous payment.
Glad to hear that, I took in the darkened hall for the last time. I had worked so hard to establish my practice and lead a normal life. It was sad to leave it all behind, but nothing would have measured against the regret of parting with Holmes.
A groom whose face I couldn’t make out in the dark provided us with a dogcart. We rattled along deserted streets further to the east, to the grimy bowels of Whitechapel. Holmes navigated without difficulty in the maze of curving alleyways and slums despite the thick yellowish fog.
1) I tried to reconcile the discrepancy between FINA and EMPT. In FINA Watson writes of the “event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill” whereas Holmes mentions in EMPT that, having escaped, he read Watson’s statement “some months later”.
Half-asleep, I could feel him tossing and turning next to me, and when I woke up in the morning, he was sitting in bed, his back propped against the pillow.
There are some curious details about Holmes’s assumed persona. His name is Altamont, and he is Irish-American. As we remember, ACD’s father’s name was Charles Altamont, and the Doyle family is of Irish descent. Also, ACD killed off Holmes in 1893, the year Charles Doyle died.
“Good Heavens, Clara, I warned you against picking up anything left by unidentified persons. It’s a matter of your own safety first and foremost,” I chided her.
We had some trouble lighting up the old kitchen range, not to mention that it felt a bit odd to prepare tea by ourselves. Nevertheless, both Sherlock and I were no strangers to managing on our own, and so we did. Having partaken of ham and cheese with bread, at my suggestion we continued to explore the house.
We chose that hill for the picnic we had on John’s birthday. Mycroft employed the best chefs in the country, and the cook in his secret residence was no exception. Our wicker basket full of gourmet dishes and exquisite drinks, we strewed a blanket upon the grass in the shade of a large elm. For hours we lounged, eating from each other’s hands and sipping Lafite, until postprandial somnolence crept over us. John then sprawled himself on the ground with his head in my lap while I sat cross-legged, my back propped against the trunk of the tree.
,” and fifty is not that much for a busy detective, so it must have been much earlier. Perhaps it was even before Reichenbach—in the Lenfilm adaptation, Milverton is connected to Moriarty, supplying the organisation with a big part of their budget, so Holmes considerably inconveniences Moriarty when he interferes in Milverton’s case.
“For Heaven’s sake, Watson. It won’t tarnish the honour of your regiment. I’m not asking you to do anything untoward. All I ask is to gather some information discreetly. I would have done it myself, but on my part it would be merely acting whereas you are a real military man. You will be more convincing and hence raise no suspicion,” I said, pouring him more tea as we sat at the dinner table.
Thankfully, his symptoms were not as bad as I had anticipated: nothing that wouldn’t be remedied by rest and relaxation. His mental state was a more complicated matter.
Apart from the Norwood case, there was nothing else worth attention in the papers. New clients were unlikely to appear soon. Nevertheless, I asked Mrs. Hudson that we were not to be disturbed unless it was of utmost importance. Holmes begrudgingly agreed with my arrangements and resolved himself to rest. By the end of the week his health was much better.
“You’re irresistible, gorgeous. I can’t wait,” Swinsby panted, slamming me back against the grimy brick wall. “Double pay for the trouble.”
Warning: heavy angst and graphic description of alcohol abuse (but things get better by the end of the chapter)
was published, Greenhough Smith asked for a Christmas story, remembering how warmly the public had received
. It’s clear from Watson’s description of Gibson that Watson is both repulsed by the ruthless man, but at the same time acknowledges his powerful presence and considers him a formidable opponent. Here’s Watson’s obvious discomfort when Gibson is looming over Holmes:
“Well, I broke the nose of that Fenton fellow and dislocated the arm of the garroter, so they are welcome to send others.”
I was already at the door when he added hastily, “Very well, I’ll let him know. You have my word. Tomorrow.”
Holmes’s panicked outcry is almost verbatim Abe Slaney’s from DANC who was in love with Mrs. Cubitt (“
By that evening, I already had new documents and was telephoning Mycroft from a safe flat. The news of my demise had reached him an hour before, and he had rarely shown himself as emotional as when he received my call.
”. Then, after such a steamy scene it turns out suddenly that Watson lives separately, and he gives for that no reason at all: it doesn’t appear that he and Holmes had a falling out—they’re as chummy as ever, and although Holmes mentions in BLAN which is set a year later that Watson married, here Watson says absolutely nothing. Weird, isn’t it?
I waited while he scribbled a more lengthy message. Upon reading it, I shook and clamped a hand over my mouth to suppress a gasp. Tears pricked my eyes again, my heart hammering wildly. Even now I can see a few lines of Mycroft’s smooth handwriting as if they were right before me:
“I respectfully decline, Doctor,” Mrs. Hudson said, returning my sovereign. “You are ruining yourself. Mr. Holmes—”
He adjusted his breathing pattern so that it was slower and deeper. Little by little it seemed to help him. At the station we bought out a whole compartment, and for the five hours until Paris Sherlock was safe from external irritants. He dozed off now and again, lying stretched out on the seats, his head resting in my lap. We didn’t speak; he didn’t have energy for it. But already he had regained his ability to eat normally—we were served a decent dinner from the restaurant car—which was good progress.
“An electric generator could be installed in the cellar,” I obliged. “Safe and clean in comparison with the gas lighting this place doesn’t even possess. Then, a new stove would be handy. I’m sure the cook would be pleased.”
