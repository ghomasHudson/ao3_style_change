Dean’s phone has been burning a hole in his pocket for the last two hours. The alert came in while they were exorcising a few lingering ghosts out of an abandoned shopping mall. Then Sam and Jack both wanted to stop for dinner on the way home. Luckily it was late enough by the time they got to the bunker that Dean could go straight to his room without raising suspicion.
Cas opens his mouth to say something but nothing comes out. He tilts his head to the side. He’s obviously in shock. Probably thinks he’s dreaming. Not that Angels dream
“Uh… I got dressed. Jeremiah told me I was an adult and I didn’t have to go with him if I didn’t want to.” He put an arm around Dean’s shoulders to comfort him but Dean brushed him off.
“He was a bastard sometimes but he was my dad. My only family with Sam in exile. I wasn’t going to lose that for some guy I barely knew. I went out to the car and I told Dad it wasn’t what he thought. Except it was. It was exactly what he thought but I still tried to explain myself. I needed him to understand.” A tear rolls down his cheek. “I said ‘I still like girls but I guess I—“ That’s as far as I got before he backhanded me across the mouth.”
“You keep not finishing your sentences. It’s irritating,” Cas mutters. Dean sighs. He should know better than to expect Castiel to infer anything by now.
Cas though, Cas has seen him at his absolute worst. He knows every unforgivable thing about Dean and fell in love with him anyway. Isn’t that the heaping teaspoon of salt in the gaping wound that is Dean’s life? A person capable of loving Dean, warts and all, actually exists and Dean is too much a husk of a human to love him back.
“But what if he’s not an angel?” Sam muses. What was it Jack said? “He defied everything an angel was created to be. Can he even be considered an angel in that case?”
“Not finishing my sentences, I know.” Dean laughs. “We kissed and rolled around on the bed and got each other's clothes off. At this point, I hadn’t done anything I wouldn’t do with a girl and I figured that’s where I should stop.”
“I knew it!” At least he’s been right about one thing. “I knew it. No one else would— but if you don’t love Sam then... It’s me?” he breathes.
“We’d finished off the last nest and I was full of adrenaline and I kissed him. Not in front of Dad.” He heads off Sam’s question. “Dad was calling Bobby looking for the next job. We kissed. Jeremiah slipped me his room key and so we…”
“Dean,” Sam whispers, gently squeezing his shoulder. Dean looks up, he’d been so lost in the memory he forgot Sam was there.
“The Empty isn’t Hell, Sam. It’s not a punishment. It’s just where demons and angels go when they die. Even angels that defied everything angels were created to be. It’s only torment for those who were tormented in life. Cas was at peace when he died. He’s at peace now.”
“You can kick us out as many times as you want,” Dean says. “We’ll keep coming back. We have a Psychopomp.”
“Cas, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. You caught me off guard. Falling for me… it just doesn’t make sense. Loving Sam, that makes sense. All those things you wrote, that’s not me. I’m angry and stubborn and I let people down. All the damn time. I’m not the guy people fall in love with. I’m the guy they bang a few times until they figure out what a mess I am and run as far as they possibly can.
“Yeah, if I’d known that when I got here I’d have been twice as worried. I’m relieved as hell that you didn’t come here to kill yourself but you aren’t okay. What happened to Cas, Dean?”
“Cas, Cas, Cas,” Dean shakes his head. It’s sad. He has such a low opinion of himself, he can’t believe the person he loves truly loves him back.“It’s not a curse, buddy. Sam is in love with you.”
“I don’t get it. Why aren’t you more happy? This is good news.” Dean nudges his foot under the table. Cas shifts in the chair.
“I thought I was going to. Right up until I told him I wanted to suck his dick.” Dean laughs again, this time at himself. “Never did that with a girl. So he put on a condom and got up over my face and I —“ Dean covers his eyes, wincing at the memory. “This is so fucking embarrassing. I gagged so hard I almost puked. He pulled out. ‘You’ve never done this, huh?’ he says. And me, like an idiot, swears that I had only not with a man. Which makes no sense. Right?”
Cas said he loved him and he said no. It wasn’t what he’d meant but it wasn’t the wrong answer either. He can’t give Cas what he wants. He just can’t.
Second obstacle: the spell is enormously complicated, consisting of extremely rare and volatile ingredients. It can only be done by someone massively powerful and experienced. And even then it will probably kill them.
“This is bad,” Dean repeats. Cas is fragile. No, that’s not right, Cas is really fucking strong. Not throw-a-truck-into-the-sun strong, though he’s that too, he’s do-the-right-thing-even-when-it’s-the-hard-thing strong. Rebel-against-your-own-kind-to-save-the-world strong. Let-your-demon-possessed-friend-beat-you-near-to-death-on-the-off-chance-you-can-reach-him strong. But not bounce-back-from-being-rejected-by-the-guy-you’ve-been-pining-over-for-twelve-years strong.
Dean clenches his armrest out of frustration. He doesn’t understand why he’s so miserable all of a sudden. It’s a good thing that the two most important people in his life are in love. With each other.
“This morning. You were missing. I was scared. I guess I got through to him. I asked him to bring Cas back. It was the only thing I could think of that might help. Not that I don’t want him back too.”
“Shouted ‘Come near my kid again and I’ll end you.’ And drove us away. The next morning he says, ’Son, I thought you had more self-respect than that.’ Never brought it up again.” Dean lets out a weary breath.
“Aren’t you just an adorable little peanut?” She pinches his cheek. “You lot better be on your way before I decide to keep him.”
The next question the OP has responded to is: “Okay, important question, is your friend gay? Or bi? Or curious? Has he given you any hint that he’s interested?”
“Well, yes. You got me. But I had motive to make that deal. He was the one to wake me up. Haven’t been able to sleep since. I
“Cas?” he says to the empty room. There’s a chance he’s listening. There might be nothing Dean can say to make it better but he has to try.
“Sure. Is this it? Is this the Empty?” Sam asks. Kevin spins in a circle to take in all the nothing.
He takes a seat next to the bed, reaching out to take his hand but he thinks better of it. He doesn’t want to dislodge the IV. He’s got tubes in his nose delivering oxygen and tubes in his arms delivering blood. He looks like a second act-break on Dr. Sexy M.D.
“He has his reasons.” Sam sounds resigned. “He did bring the entire world back he doesn’t owe anyone anything.”
“Your true happiness was telling me how you felt. Which means you weren’t happy before. All that time you couldn’t be happy because I made it impossible to tell me. I’m so sorry.
“No biggie.” She smiles. “Did it work? Did he open up?” She had stayed behind to give them some one on one time.
“There was no escaping, that was it. We were done. Then Cas made a decision. I could see it on his face. He said he’d made a deal with the Empty back when Jack died. The first time Jack died. He bargained his life for Jack’s. The Empty would take him at a moment of total happiness.”
“Cas, what the hell? Isn’t this exactly what you want?” Nothing in the last twenty-four hours has gone the way Dean expected. “You love Sam! Don’t you?”
Dean didn’t mean to drive here. He didn’t have a destination in mind when he set out. He’d woken before dawn, feeling like he was suffocating, and just took off.
Dean waits until the following day. He finds Sam in the library, working on his Hunter wiki project.
“What do I think of Cas?” Sam repeats, his brow furrowing into its default ‘my brother has a screw loose’ position. “What am I supposed to think? It’s Cas.”
“So, we don’t have a way yet. We’ll look. We’ve got all the research in the Bunker. Eileen will help. We’ll raid the British Men of Letters files. Bobby or Garth might have a book we don’t. We’ll look and we’ll keep looking until we find something.”
Jack is gone but in his place a crinkled sheet of paper floats to the ground. Sam snatches it up. It’s a set of latitude and longitude coordinates.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry I was too stupid to see how you feel. And I’m sorry that I don’t know how to… Fuck!
“You are not acting like you, is my point. Dean, I saw you doing sit-ups a few days ago. What gives?”
“Please Dean, let me help. It’s not too late, I’ll call an ambulance but they’ll need to know what you did.”
The heart monitor beeps steadily as Dean approaches the bed. Cas had been admitted with internal hemorrhaging and multiple organ failure. Sam believes it’s because he was in the same vessel for so long the angel grace was the only thing keeping it functioning. The last twelve hours have been the longest of Dean’s life. He should have come out of the anesthesia a few hours ago. He hasn’t. The doctor who spoke to them gave him a fifty-fifty chance of waking up.
Rowena flicks her hand and Kevin’s spirit swirls into a mist and then gently reforms into a person. Kevin pats himself down.
“Oh jeez, Sammy. I owe you an apology. All those times I made fun of your hair, I didn’t mean— it wasn’t about your sexuality. It’s just that I think it looks really stupid.”
“Oh yes, I have the power to bring him back. Sam, you’re right, I care for Cas. And for you and Dean. Beyond what I feel for all living beings. We have history. But I can’t intervene in individual lives. If I get involved, have favorites, do favors, I become Chuck.
“Well, alright. I mean great. This is great.” Dean clears his throat. “Cas is going to be so happy. I’m… I’m happy for you. For you both.”
“You too.” Dean watches him go, finishes his beer and returns to the table. After they’ve eaten and paid the bill they pile back into the Impala and continue the drive back to the bunker.
Sam never should’ve let it go this long. He should’ve forced Dean to talk about it instead of waiting for him to be ready. If Dean had acted like he did after Lucifer killed Cas a few years ago, the barely functional depression that only lifted briefly when he erupted into a boiling rage, Sam would’ve pushed harder, not let Dean brush him off. But Dean was going to bed at a reasonable hour and buying cereal without marshmallows. Sure it was weird as hell but Sam took it as progress, that he was stable enough to reach out for help when he needed it. What he should’ve seen was that the grief was eating away at him. Even his coping mechanisms were breaking down.
“I was pre-law at Stanford. I can come up with a million arguments for why you should send him back. And I’m willing to make you listen to every single one of them.”
“I don’t know. Dad wasn’t that opened minded. I thought you’d probably feel the same way.” Sam shrugs.
Jack shakes his head. “Good people die all the time. Their loved ones pray to me to bring them back. Their pain is as real as Dean’s. Denying them is not easy. It would never be just one exception. It’s how things have to be. I have to let people die. Which means I have to let my friends die.”
The barn doors creak open. Dean’s heart starts to race. A figure stands silhouetted in the doorway and Dean can’t breathe around the swelling in his throat. Then he takes in the shape of the person at the door: long legs, broad shoulders.
Sam shakes his head. “I’ll tell her the truth. I owe her that much. Eileen is amazing but she’s no Cas.”
Dean takes a deep breath. “Billie chased us into the Bunker. She wanted me dead because… Who even cares why. She wanted me dead. She used her mojo to give me a heart attack.”
“We’ve opened the bunker to other hunters. Legacies be damned. The bright side of us being the last Men of Letters, we get to decide who gets to carry it on. It’s the People of Letters now, by the way. 'Cause that was just sexist. Some new hunters have moved in, Claire for one, but it’s available to any who need the resources.
“Yeah.” Sam steps forward, nervously brushing his hands on his jeans. He looks at Dean for encouragement. Dean gives him a discreet thumbs-up. “I need to tell you,” he reaches out and takes Cas’s hand, “that I love you.” He takes Cas’s other hand for good measure.
“Right, my old friend. Who I guess you could also call an Ex.” Dean is not sure why he was putting up such a fight about admitting to it and equally not sure why he’s caving now. He’s probably just tired. “You got me. I was surprised to see him because he was an old flame.”
“What is going on with you? Turning down burgers? Letting me drive? The untouched six-pack in the fridge?”
“No deals. I’m done with deals,” Empty-Crowley’s face goes cold. “Castiel is an angel. He died. He belongs here. End of story.”
“You said I changed you and maybe that’s true but you changed me, Cas. You did. When we met you told me good things can happen. I didn’t believe it then but you made me believe it. Over and over again. Good thing after good thing. And you loving me? That’s the best thing. All I’m asking for is one more good thing. Please, Cas, please wake up.”
“You’re my best friend and I’ve hurt you more than anyone. And somehow you’re the only one who’s never left.” Dean laughs, a tear sliding down his cheek.
“You flirted with him in front of Dad?” Sam asks, apparently, that’s the detail he’s having the most trouble grasping.
Sam has tried praying to him many times in the last few months, this is the first time he’s gotten a response. Jack smiles that familiar, guileless smile.
“I know,” he signs back. “It’s not like I don’t know it’s about Cas. I just wish I could get him to talk about it.”
“Yeah,” Dean gulps. “I don’t know how he found out. Maybe someone saw us and tipped him off. Anyway, he yells “Dean, you’ve got five minutes to get dressed and get to the car.”
“Good for you, man.” Dean clinks his beer bottle against Jeremiah's glass. “See? We’re both in good places.”
Dean laughs. The OP could give Cas a lesson in taking things literally. The commenter clarifies what they meant.
If someone had asked yesterday, he’d have said he couldn’t remember the location of the barn, but somehow he found it without looking. Honestly, he's surprised it's still standing. It looks a breath away from collapsing. He's probably pushing his luck just sitting on this moldy hay bale.
“This is bad,” Dean sighs. Cas is in love with Sam, that much is clear. He practically wrote a sonnet about it. But Sam does not love Cas. Dean is certain of that. Maybe Dean was too dense to see how Cas felt, but Dean knows his little brother. He knows how Sam acts around someone he likes. Not that Sam doesn’t like Cas. Of course, he does; he’s always the first to come to Cas’s defense, but he doesn’t love him.
Dean bristles and shifts on the stool. “No. You shouldn’t have. You were right, it would’ve made it worse. It wasn’t your mess to clean up. Anyway, that was a long time ago. It’s water under the bridge. I’m doing fine.”
Dean is going to have to tell Sam. If Cas follows Dean’s idiotic forum advice and confesses, Sam will be too blindsided to let him down gently. He’s going to break Cas’s heart.
“I need you to wake up. Okay? If we pulled you out of the Empty, where you were at peace, just for you to die as a human.” Dean gulps “That’s not something I’ll ever get over.
“Dean!” Sam rushes to him. “What was it?” He grabs Dean’s wrists and pushes up his sleeves. Then takes him by the chin and looks into his eyes. “Did you take something?”
Dean chuckles. He doesn’t have it in him to stay mad at Cas for more than twenty seconds. “True. What can I do for you, buddy?”
That pulls a laugh from Dean. And once the first is out another follows and another. It’s a snotty, weepy, kind of laughter but it’s laughter all the same.
Sam closes his eyes in relief, which is quickly replaced by fury. “You asshole, you scared me half to death!”
“Dean?” He knocks on his door the next morning. “Can I come in? I’ve got coffee.” No answer. “And pancakes.” Still nothing. “Dean?”
If it’s unsettling for Sam it’s got to be doubly so for Dean. There had been real affection between them. Sam always thought it was because he saw Crowley as a reflection of himself, or at least of his worst impulses.
“Loved it. Thought I was in Heaven. And now that I’ve been to some actual Heavens it’s still up there. I think we would’ve gone even further but…”
Empty-Crowley does an exaggerated shrug. “I admit I didn’t think the ‘moment of true happiness’ thing completely through. He has been frustratingly quiet since I took him. Still, his suffering at the anticipation of it was satisfying. And your suffering…,” he looks at Dean, “a delightful bonus.”
Dean wasn’t lying, he’s not going to get over this. He’s— Something touches his left shoulder. A hand.
Sam waits to see how Dean will react to that. He just nods. As far as Sam knows, Dean hasn’t told anyone else how he feels about Cas. Not that he actually put it in words to Sam. Didn’t have to.
“Actually, I should talk to Eileen.” Sam lets go of Cas. “I want her to hear it from me.” He jogs upstairs, turning around when he reaches the door. “I’ll be back soon.” He blows a kiss down at the still stunned Angel.
“I’m up to it,” Kevin says. “Probably. We’ll see.” He grabs each of them by a shoulder and with a clang, they’re somewhere else. “Corduroy, I missed corduroy.” Kevin fingers Dean’s collar. “It sounds how it feels, don’t you think?”
“Okay,” Dean shakes his head. Of course, Cas won’t let it go that easily. “Where do you want me to start?”
He locks the door and, once he’s sure he’s alone, he gets out his reading glasses. Dean doesn’t want Sam finding out about the cheaters. Dean groaned
Sam clears his throat. Dean turns back to the booth. “Guys, this is an old friend, Jeremiah Sloane. Jeremiah, this is Jack, Castiel, and my brother Sam.” Sam stands and shakes his hand.
“I can try. If it means that much to him. Maybe with enough time I will. If not, it would only be sixty or seventy years at the most.”
Dean is spared witnessing what would probably be the world’s most awkward first kiss by Jack coming down the stairs with a load of groceries.
“I’m not Dad. And I’m sorry I made you feel you couldn’t say anything. You’re my little brother, I don’t care who you date as long as you’re happy.”
He lowers himself to his knees, ignoring his popping joints. He should start using that yoga book Sam got him.
Dean covers his mouth, tears running down his face. He can see Cas’s face behind his eyes. “He said I wasn’t some monster that was only good for killing. He said I was loving and selfless and that I taught him…” He presses his hands to his eyes. He’s back in that damn storeroom. Helpless, useless, worthless.
Dean pushes back in the chair. His thoughts are chaos. It’s him. That can’t be right. He’s the one Cas called loyal and kind and selfless? “No.”
“Jack? Hey, buddy, I know you said you wouldn’t be popping by for a chat but I really could use some help.
“That night I told Dad I was going to see a girl I’d met at the bar a few days ago. He didn’t mind if I went out as long as we weren’t on a job. He just told me to be back by checkout the next day because he had a lead on the next hunt. So I go to Jeremiah’s room. I told myself I wasn’t really going to do anything. I was just going to get some time away from Dad. Okay, maybe I’d kiss him again because that had been alright.
“No story. I was twenty. He was twenty-two. Dad and I were taking out a string of vampire nests along the Ohio River. Jeremiah was a local hunter helping us out. He flirted with me and I flirted back. And eventually…”
“My pleasure. Been a while since I got to practice my craft down here. Now then. Go on. Get your man.”
“I’m texting Eileen that she can go home. I promised I’d let her know when I found you. She’s waiting at a gas station about five miles back. In case I needed…”
much more sense. An unmated alpha moving an omega into his home, no other live-in domestic staff, all the over the top religious stuff. The hundreds of female omegas in St. Mary’s, and this guy had seen Dean taking a beating and been
To address his excessively depressive symptoms, anti-neurasthenic treatments are to be increased (hydro-therapeutic), along with the introduction of physical activity and nature therapy.
‘I’m not getting rid of you,’ says Castiel again, and for a split second Dean flinches, thinking he’s read his mind. ‘Dean, I’m not. You can stop.’
‘-to get past that,’ he says, or something similar. There’s something else that Castiel doesn’t catch, and then, ‘for God’s sake. You’re being dramatic.’
Dean watches Balthazar watch her emerge. The guy’s dressed like an idiot, and he’s kind of the opposite of the sort of person he’d expect Cas to know, but he doesn’t seem dangerous or even especially sleazy. Hedonistic, sure. Nothing wrong with that. If Dean had been born an alpha, able to live freely and do whatever he wanted, he’d probably be fucking hedonistic too. As it is, Balthazar’s just pulling a bottle of something that looks like whiskey out of his bag, and he flings Lisa a delighted, flirtatious sort of grin.
Dean feels his shoulders lock up. He wishes, suddenly, furiously, that he hadn’t lied about knowing where Cas was.
‘Okay.’ He drops a kiss on Cas’ temple, then untangles himself from the blanket with difficulty in order to roll over, while Cas presses his teeth to the nape of Dean’s neck and the line of muscle leading down to his shoulder. He doesn’t leave marks often - sometimes sucks bruises into Dean’s throat like claiming bites when he’s caught up in the moment, or nips just hard enough to make Dean whimper and writhe - but even the graze of teeth against skin turns Dean lax and pliable most of the time. Sometimes Cas murmurs, ‘
He glances sideways, but before he can back up further Michael steps into his space, inhaling, and Castiel becomes suddenly, horribly aware of the fact that he has not yet washed this morning; that quite possibly Dean’s heat scent may still linger on him, and that if anyone could pick up on such a thing, it would be Dean’s true mate.
‘You mean cause- I dunno.’ Dean shakes himself into something resembling coherence. ‘I dunno. There’s like - I don’t know if alphas have all the same stuff. I don’t know if I’d wanna do it without slick. It - when it’s hurt, in the past, it’s usually been - I was dry, you know? And there’s - I mean,’ he hesitates, like he’s trying to remember. Castiel’s thoughts catch, unbearably, on the thought that Dean has been hurt in this way, that people have done this to him against his will, and the need to provide comfort becomes overwhelming. ‘Like at first I don’t think it felt like much, just weird. But there’s like a, a spot on the inside? That feels real good. Maybe alphas don’t have that the same, I dunno.’
He watches his mother watch Dean. Her expression is not uncritical, but he is not fool enough to imagine she does not know everything of the last few weeks, has not received multiple reports from various sources of Dean’s flight into town on the brink of his heat, and the upset at church a couple of weeks ago. Dean has, thankfully, been a model citizen since - the last two Sundays have passed without incident, although Castiel suspects that Dean has achieved this by sitting in complete silence without making eye contact with a single soul for several hours at a time. He has never liked to ask Dean’s opinion on the service, in case it turns out that Dean hasn’t been taking in a word of any of it.
‘Cas,’ the man pants, licking the closed seam of his mouth as if to coax him open. ‘Cas, buddy, you with me?’
His hair is almost completely vertical, his voice so gravelly it sounds painful. He looks like a fucking idiot. Dean adores him.
She actually tips her head to one side, and the movement reminds him of Cas so precisely that his breath catches. ‘Not if you refuse. I’m just not sure you understand the situation outside of how Castiel has,’ she hesitates delicately, ‘perceived it.’
The light across Dean’s face burns away as quickly as it flared. If Castiel blinks, he imagines he could see the after-image tattooed against the back of his eyelids.
‘Are you interested in such things?’ he says, a coward. He has to tip his head back to see Dean’s face at his shoulder. Dean twists his mouth a little, the way he does when Castiel quotes scripture and he’s trying not to say whatever he’s thinking out loud.
Flashbacks/nightmares of previous sexual abuse, in particular being drugged during it. I didn't really think of this as a rape scene while I was writing it, because it's not explicit - more of a disjointed mishmash of various experiences -  but it's probably a rape scene, and it's the reason the rape/non-con tag exists on this fic. If you want to skip over this, stop reading after 'He sleeps.'
There’s something - accusatory? - in her expression. Castiel makes his own face blander, flatter,  in response. Cut it away: quick and clean, no hesitation. ‘He’s been taken care of in my absence. I don’t intend to see him again.’ She opens her mouth and he quickly says, ‘Thank you, it’s nice to see you, goodbye.’
,’ says Castiel, and his tone makes Dean shiver, and that’s what he wants. He wraps his mouth around the opening of the bottle and tips his head back, swallowing, and the liquor burns hot against his throat. He barely tastes it. It doesn’t matter. The burn of the alcohol is enough, the warmth in his mouth, the sting in his eyes; and then Cas is on him, crowded up against him, trying to wrest the bottle from his hand like this specific sin is gonna be the one that takes Dean over the edge, the one that damns him. The lip of the glass knocks hard against Dean’s teeth, and he doesn’t care. He hopes his mouth bleeds.
“Then I trust that Castiel will do the right thing,” Crowley said. “He does not enjoy seeing Dean as a demon.”
Dean frowned. He hadn’t thought about that. “I doubt he’d get out. Besides, he’d be pretty stupid to target the same place again now the cops know who he is.”
Abruptly Dean moved, pulling at his bonds. Castiel pushed himself off the wall as he saw them coming free. Quickly he crossed the room and grabbed them, Dean snapping at him. Castiel reached into his grace and grabbed Dean to hold him down. The last thing he needed was Dean loose in the bunker. He would probably kill Sam if given the chance.
“Very quiet,” Castiel said as he put the supplies Gabriel had given him away. “Although my upstairs neighbours do tend to party a lot.”
“Kind of,” he moved back behind the counter. In many ways he did have it planned out, but at the same time he didn’t like the idea of being locked into the future. He was looking forward to one day taking over the business though but he knew he still had a lot to learn. Deciding to change the subject he leaned on the counter. “So how long have you and Gabriel been together?”
“A good demon uses everything at his disposal to get what he wants,” Crowley explained. “I know witchcraft, therefore I use it.”
“You really think CPS cares about a family that rich?” Bobby said. “They pay to make problems go away.”
This rush didn’t seem to be as busy as some of the previous ones, and they managed to work their way through it without Dean making a mistake. He actually felt relieved as the last customer exited with a smile on their face. Dean wiped his hands on his apron, feeling a wave of exhaustion play over him. Kali sent him to lock the door as the clock ticked over to closing time.
“I’m the one who’s going to have to deal with the fallout if you die,” Crowley said. “Be seeing you soon, Cassie.”
“We never saw eye-to-eye,” Anna said. “Castiel is more understanding. He’s the only one who hasn’t completely cut me out.”
“Is that what they teach you in Bible school,” Crowley said. “You realise Dean might make a wonderful parent.”
“Tried digging but got no results,” Benny said. “Few of his siblings pass through here but even though they’re happy to talk about him they never explained the name.”
“So you can put it back together again,” Bobby said. “Replace what you need to with parts from the yard. See if you can rebuild it and make it run.”
Week three had seen him in Kansas. Dean had been almost tempted to take a side trip to Lebanon to say hello to Sam but had stuck to his guns. This time the man he was after had tried to trap him with witchcraft and devil’s traps but Dean had managed to escape them. By now he was getting angry though and had let Crowley know it. Crowley had been feeding him whatever information he could come across.
Crowley had been right about Anton not being an easy one to break. Dean had lost count of the days he had spent trying to get the information out of the snivelling little weasel. Crowley had come to visit a couple of times, playing the “good cop” to Dean’s “bad cop”. Still Anton had refused to give up the information.
It took Dean a week just to pick up a lead on the guy. Dean had started at the warehouse in Brooklyn, using the information he garnered there to pick up the trail. It had taken him across New York and to a few more warehouses before Dean began to realise how deep into the system this guy actually was.
Dean’s mind was still buzzing as they wandered back to the car. The waitress had slipped Castiel her number before they had left, Castiel trying to hide it but Dean had noticed. He was surprised by his small pang of jealousy and protectiveness. He had pretended that he hadn’t seen anything.
“You do that,” Dean said. “Don’t starve yourself. Besides, I always learnt that the mind is sharper if you’ve eaten.”
“Mind you, I can see the appeal,” Crowley said as he looked down Castiel’s body to his crotch. “Why he’d want to mate you, I mean.”
“Only idiots have carpet on Main Street,” Kali said. “You’ll find it in the mall but you won’t find it here.”
He could still sense Dean’s anger at him. He had also felt the flare of protectiveness as Dean had come to terms with the fact he had conceived. Castiel knew that Dean was intent on keeping it no matter what Castiel said to him. He wondered if Dean could sense his own worry through their bond. He had tried to send thoughts of his wish for Dean to terminate the pregnancy but he didn’t know how successful he had been.
He was so deep in his mind that he didn’t hear the door to the cell open. His eyes were closed as he floated, drifting on a different level of consciousness. He had tried to tune into angel radio while he was doing this but that had resulted in a migraine. His stolen grace was a poor conduit, and being in Hell had muffled what little chance he had left of reaching out to his brethren.
“Look anyway, I need to go,” Dean said. “Bobby needs me back at the shop. We’ve got some training to catch up on.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Dean said. He stared at her. “I can’t believe you offered to sleep with your brother.”
Dean handed one of the sandwiches back to Castiel who took it gladly, Dean pulling out a chair and dropping into it. He stretched his legs out in front of him and took a bite out of his own sandwich. He didn’t like them quite as much as Castiel did. He remembered Castiel saying when he became human again that he looked forward to the taste of pb&j.
“He just doesn’t think that sort of thing is necessary,” Kali said, leaning on the counter. “He’s not much of a conversationalist either.”
“Just my brother,” Dean said. “Sam. He’s 14 and still with Dad. They fight all the time so I worry about him.”
Dean headed to reception to finalise the checkout, then joined Castiel at the Impala. They climbed into the car, Dean glancing at Castiel and having the urge to kiss him again. He pushed it down and turned over the engine instead. Putting the car in gear he steered them onto the main road and pointed them in the direction of home. Once they were cruising he let his hand drop, finding Castiel’s fingers and threading them together. He caught Castiel’s smile and beamed.
Dean smiled as he leaned back against the throne. Crowley had left him to his own devices, finally seeming to accept that Dean was an equal. Crowley had ordered the other demons to follow Dean’s commands so long as they didn’t run counter to his own. Dean wasn’t interested in running Hell so he had decided to leave Crowley in charge. A few demons had tried to rise up against the new orders but Dean had happily dispatched them with the First Blade, Crowley standing back with a smirk on his face.
“Cassie talked?” Gabriel said. “I haven’t had a proper conversation with him in ages. He’s always distracted with his work.”
Letting out a steadying breath Dean reached up and unlocked the straps binding Castiel’s wrists. Castiel pulled free and practically pounced on him, pinning Dean to the ground. Dean laughed as Castiel buried his nose into his scent gland and breathed deep. Without so much as a warning Castiel was pushing Dean’s knees apart and burying his cock inside him.
“He’ll be fine,” the doctor said. “We want to keep him overnight just to be sure. He sustained a bit of blood loss.”
Adopted, he reminded himself. They were all adopted. That’s why they would look nothing alike. Dean hung his apron up and washed his hands. He headed out of the back room and made his way out from behind the counter. Glancing up he saw that Castiel was serving drinks like he had been there the whole time, including the speciality drinks Dean noted.
“He doesn’t seem that bad,” Dean said, and he meant it. He really didn’t see Castiel the way that everyone said he was. “At least not to me.”
Not to mention there was Castiel. Sam was still scared about what could be happening to the angel. He didn’t know what demon!Dean was like. For all he knew he could be torturing Castiel. Even worse, Castiel might already be dead and they could just be trying to get a hold of Castiel’s grace for some other purpose. There was no clear way of knowing.
Gabriel joined them, bringing Castiel with him. “We’ll close up the shops tonight. You two head to Benny’s or whatever you had planned.”
Dean shrugged it off, checking the stock levels of the supplies out front and heading into the back to grab some more. He brought them back to the front and restocked the shelves, Kali putting new food out in the display case. Dean prepared himself for the lunchtime rush, going out and wiping down the tables and getting everything ready.
Dean wondered how long it would be before they allowed him anywhere near the till. He had always been alright with math, and Bobby had been practicing with him to work out exact change. Dean absently wondered if Castiel was allowed near the till. Given he had been there for seven years he probably was. It would be a while before Dean had anywhere near the level of experience that Castiel or Kali did.
“I doubt that.” He gestured around them. “I’m not having a baby running around Hell. Especially not some hybrid that could destroy us all.”
“The sweet shop,” Castiel said, his eyes flicking back to the man. Dean knew he had seen what he had seen. “They’re doing special orders. It would be a very profitable day.”
Dean stepped into the cell and instantly stopped as he was hit with the overwhelming scent of alpha. He smiled, closing the door behind him. It had been almost 24 hours since he had taken Crowley’s potion and he could feel his body begging to be mated. His heat was strong but not overwhelming, Dean able to think clearly and make rational decisions.
“If any harm comes to Cas it’s going to be on you,” Dean said, stalking toward Crowley menacingly with one hand resting on the First Blade. “Don’t think I won’t kill you.”
But Dean had a promise to keep. He hit the speed dial for Sam, putting the phone up to his ear. He wondered what Sam was up to right now. If he was waiting for Dean’s call or if he was in the middle of doing homework. He knew he wouldn’t have to wait long to find out.
“Got it,” Gabriel said as he extended an arm to Kali who hooked hers through his. “Thanks for this.”
“Well, I was thinking,” Dean said, feeling nerves play through him, “that maybe it could be Winchester.”
“We suspect that was his intention,” Isiah said. “We’ve been trying to narrow down the location though. He refuses to do so.”
“Step two of your training today,” Kali told him. “I’m going to teach you two speciality drinks. Basic but popular. Think you can handle that?”
The sound of the computer beeping snapped Sam out of his dreams. He raised his head and blinked the fog out of his eyes. Staring at the screen it slowly began to dawn on him that it had found something. Adrenaline flashed through him as he dragged the computer closer, finding that it had confirmed a trace on Gadreel. He had the library.
She shook her head. “Rent’s too high and it doesn’t get the tourists or school traffic. It would also mean moving away from the Sugar Heaven.”
“Oh I’m definitely interested,” Dean said, taking another bite out of his cherry pie and savouring it. “Good find, Cas.”
“I don’t see how,” Crowley said. “In case you’ve forgotten the angels had their wings clipped. They can’t get into Hell. Neither can your brother.”
“Well if things don’t work out for you at the Holy Perk my door is always open,” Benny said. “We’re always looking for eager workers.”
Castiel stared down at him, Dean seeing resolve on his face. He reached a hand toward Dean’s stomach. Realising what Castiel was about to do Dean grabbed his hand and tore it away. He flipped them over, rolling Castiel onto his back so that he was straddling him with Castiel still locked inside him. Dean pinned Castiel’s hands to the floor, Castiel trying to fight him. Castiel’s eyes glowed as he tried to summon up his grace.
“There was not much to tell,” Castiel said. “I can’t sense it. I don’t know where Metatron would have hid it. I know that the angels will not let Metatron out of Heaven.”
“Nah,” Bobby said. “Upkeep on it got too expensive. It’s sitting out in the yard now. Cut him a good deal on that too.”
Dean glanced at Aaron and saw that he was shivering while leaning against the door. Aaron frowned at being called ‘Mr Usually Late’, a small look of guilt on his face. Gabriel kissed Kali on the cheek and headed for the Sugar Heaven, Kali pulling out her own keys in order to open up the Holy Perk. Dean followed her inside, glancing around and noting that someone must have finished all the chores on Saturday before closing up.
“First food service job, yeah,” Dean said. “I’ve done odd jobs, but those were mostly manual. Bit of carpentry, some mechanic and engineering stuff, that’s it.”
When the last of the school rush headed out the door he noted that his feet were actually hurting. He frowned, rotating his ankles to relieve some of the pressure on them. He had thought he was getting used to being on his feet all day but it seemed that he wasn’t. He saw Kali watching him and gave her a reassuring smile.
Dean looked up at the roof of the room that Crowley had assigned him. Everything about the place was made of stone. It was boring and dull with nothing really distinguishable about the place. It was starting to drive Dean mad. He had even convinced Crowley to let him make a few hex bags to try and stem his boredom over but even that had been monotonous. He needed to get out of here and do something, and he needed to be gone yesterday.
“So everyone keeps saying,” Dean said. “I still say it’s messed up what your family did to her though.”
“Dean, we’ve been over this,” Castiel said. “I made the deal with the Empty. It was only a matter of time before it did.”
“Spark plugs,” Bobby said. “Followed by a complete oil change. You’re going to help me in the shop.”
With a cry Castiel was coming, Dean’s gaze locking on his face so he could watch the beauty there. He felt warm stripes pain across his chest, Castiel grinding down hard onto Dean’s cock and clenching around him. The sight and feel of it all drove Dean over the edge, gripping Castiel’s hips and with one last thrust upward he came deep inside of Castiel.
“Word of advice,” Gabriel said. “If you meet anyone run their name by Benny. He’ll tell you if they’re in the green or not.”
During one particularly intense moment Dean felt a hand on his. He glanced down to find Castiel’s hand resting on top of his on the armrest. Frowning Dean turned his hand, Castiel lacing their fingers together. Looking up at the other man Dean found that Castiel was fully focussed on the screen. He no doubt hadn’t even realised what he had done.
“Fire,” Dean said. “House fire. They think she was trying to save my brother but didn’t make it out.”
“Can you smell me?” He asked, wrapping his hand around Castiel’s head and pulling him forward, pressing Castiel’s nose into his scent gland. “I bet you can smell it.”
“One class has an assignment every week,” Castiel said. “We are required to study a different god and write a summary page on them and their worship.”
“He pretty much raised us like we were soldiers,” Dean said. “He had a pretty tight regiment. You had to be up and ready by a set time and you definitely couldn’t back chat him or he’d take your head off. We always moved around so school was hard but he still expected us to have the best grades. No slacking. He caught you lying about he’d have your head.”
“I actually asked at the shoe shop what they recommended,” Dean said. “They said these were preferred by people who work in retail.”
“Yeah. Chicago,” Dean said. He remembered the last time he’d been in the city. The hotel they’d stayed at hadn’t been great. “Provided Dad got the job he was going for.”
By the end of week four Dean was in Mexico City. He found it a bit annoying given his Spanish had never been very good so Crowley had organised him a translator. She was a feisty little demon who was more than willing to join in on a fight, and Dean had noted that she had been flirting with him from the start. He ignored it, sticking to his mission much to her dismay.
“But you do constantly have people begging for money,” Castiel said. “People who assume you only earned your place because of wealth, not because of your work. People who only want to know you because of your money that would dump you the second you lose it so you have no real friends. It’s lonely having wealth.”
“He does have a sweet tooth,” Dean said, watching as Castiel pulled out a bottle of soda to scrutinise its label. “He said you probably forgot to eat.”
“You’ll get the hang of this,” Kali told him as he finished. “We’ll go a couple more weeks with you serving the regular orders and then we’ll start weaning you onto the speciality drinks.”
“If the investigators say electrical fault then I’m with them,” Dean said.  “The lights did flicker that night you know.”
“Had to buy up a heap of clothes for work,” Dean said. “Also been buying a few tools for the workshop. Bobby says I can use his but I kind of want my own stuff, you know?”
Dean heard the fumbling of the phone, then Sam say ‘Dad!’. Dean felt a rock form in the pit of his stomach.
“You’ve done enough today, little brother,” Gabriel said. “You’ve been through a lot. Go take some time to relax before you lock yourself away for the rest of the weekend.”
Dean absently wondered about Sam. He hadn’t had an update on his brother in a while. He knew that Sam was still looking for him despite Dean having told him not too. By now Sam must have also worked out that Castiel was missing as well so he would be looking for him too. Dean wondered what sort of things Crowley’s demons had been leading him on with.
By Friday Bobby’s anger seemed to have abated a bit, Dean spotting him watching him from time to time with curious eyes. Dean kept himself focussed though. He didn’t want pity, and he certainly didn’t deserve it. He knew he had messed up by letting Anna get to him. He still felt sorry for her, but he knew what he had done was in the best interest of everyone.
“Cool,” Dean said. “I mean, we work together and don’t really know each other so maybe we could. You know, get to know each other.”
“We’re in Chicago,” Sam said. “Dad said we’re going to be here for a few months and even said I could join the school play if I want.”
Sam felt his heart skip as he realised what this meant. “You mean you’re looking for Cas’ grace again?”
The man slowly backed away from the counter, clutching the bag to him. He kept it trained on them as he reached the door, pulling it open and stepping out. They saw him step over and toward the sweet shop. When he was out of sight Dean let out the breath that he had been holding, slumping against the counter.
“Exactly.” Crowley took a drink for himself. “Anyway, you might want to go check on your angel. See how he’s holding up, although I would advise against doing anything… too recreational with him in his current condition.”
Castiel slid out from his hiding place, quietly walking up behind Dean. Dean’s entire attention was on the King of Hell so he didn’t sense or see Castiel as he approached. Castiel came to stand directly behind Dean and reached forward.
“If you were my boy, I’d be telling you how proud I am,” Bobby said. “And I’m gonna tell you it anyway – I’m proud of you.”
“He’s aware,” Crowley said. “He would also be aware of how pointless it would be to attempt to rescue you.”
“Fine.” Dean stretched, smirking as he remembered who he had locked up in the dungeon. “If you need me I’ll be in the dungeon.”
“I thank you for that,” Castiel said. “I also know that I will never fly again. My wings are broken beyond repair.”
“Six months,” Castiel said. “It is no secret in our family that we are all adopted and when. We even know a little of our birth parents.”
After Bobby finished his food they washed up the dishes together, then made their way over to the computer. Dean pulled up a chair next to Bobby who made room for him. Bobby took them to all the usual websites, going through with Dean what he was looking for and explaining how everything worked. Dean had heard it once already but each time he heard it he picked up on new details.
“So is Ishim,” Anna said. “Balthazar sometimes told them to leave me alone when he wasn’t busy preening in the mirror.”
“Metatron still hasn’t broken,” Crowley said. “Apparently angels aren’t as effective at torture as you are.”
Dean nodded, reclining back on the bed. Castiel touched a finger to his forehead. Dean closed his eyes as he felt the heat wash over him, healing him. The aches and pains of his body disappeared, Dean letting out a long breath at the relief. Opening his eyes he found Castiel watching him with a calculating look.
He watched as Dean entered the cell. Castiel looked him over and noted that Dean looked healthy. He had been worried since he had sensed Dean’s fight with the angels. He knew that Dean had gotten injured in the fight but he could see no sign of it now. Once the fight was over he had closed his mind down again, trying to suppress his bond with Dean. He didn’t need Dean to know his every thought.
“You can find better company than that,” Benny said. “If you want news about the town just come to me. I can answer any questions you have.”
Eventually the time had rolled around for Dean to meet up with Anna, Dean grabbing his keys and heading for the door.
“Yeap,” Dean said, picking up the condom. “Only this time we’re using protection. No more accidents.”
Dean raised a brow as he wondered if that had ever actually happened to Castiel. “He the one who taught you the ramen diet?”
He had cleaned up before he had headed back to Hell. He had also stopped at a bar and had a few drinks (on Crowley’s tab) in celebration. An alpha had made a move on him but Dean had put him down quick smart. That alpha would think twice before accosting an omega in the future. Dean smirked as he remembered the look of fear in the alpha’s eyes as Dean had stood over him, the alpha clutching his broken arm and gurgling on his own blood. Dean had left before the police could arrive.
Dean dragged Castiel forward, sliding his own teeth over Castiel’s mating mark and biting down. Castiel yelped, Dean feeling another burst of pleasure wash over him. Dean could taste the blood on his tongue, feel it trickling down his neck where Castiel was biting him. As he came down from his high he reluctantly released the skin between his teeth and felt Castiel do the same.
Dean finished sweeping, heading back behind the counter to help Castiel finish setting up for the morning. Castiel brought the till from the safe and placed it in the register as Dean made sure they had enough cups and things from the back. He checked the syrup bottles to see if any needed replacing or topping up, then finished setting things up.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean said. He could remember that fight he’d had with his dad some time ago. “Spent most of it on booze and gas.”
“Let me guess – it was a status thing,” Dean said. “Look how good I am because of how many kids I’ve adopted.”
When Monday rolled around Dean had made sure that he was on time, rocking up to the shop a good five minutes before he was supposed to. Kali and Gabriel were nowhere in sight, the morning a little chilly. The street lights were still on and there was only the occasional car on the street, Dean leaning against the door and looking down the road to the bakery. He could already smell the bread.
Dean glanced up from where he was drying the dishes as he heard footsteps out in the corridor. He gave Sam a look and saw that he agreed that it had to be Castiel. Sure enough the former angel appeared in the doorway, a duffle bag in his hand as he peered into the kitchen.
Sam started awake as his phone began to ring. He pushed himself up off the table, blinking the sleep from his eyes. It had been a while since he’d gotten a good night sleep. He’d gotten into the habit of falling asleep while researching – simply collapsing from exhaustion. He rubbed his eyes as he pulled the phone toward him and glanced at the number.
“That’s just a fancy way of saying ‘we threw all our leftovers in’,” Dean said. He frowned. “How’d you know about this place, anyway?”
“What?” Dean glances at the mirror to the backseat. Jack is asleep against the window but Cas is staring intently at him. Par for the course.
“Dean Winchester?” asks a man standing in front of their table. Dean blinks up at him. He’s tall, nearly as tall as Sam. He has dark eyes and salt and pepper hair long enough to push behind his ears. Dean squints, trying to picture him without the beard and minus a couple of decades.
“Okay,” Dean holds up his hands. “I get it. You like Cas. What are you going to do about Eileen?” Dean liked Sam with Eileen. He thought they had something special. Apparently, Dean doesn’t know anything about anything.
“I unlocked the door and he was sitting on the bed in just his jeans and he patted the spot next to him and…”
This is creepy. It had been creepy when the Empty appeared as Meg and Meg had only been an occasional ally. But Crowley was—eventually— a friend. A duplicitous, self-serving, sardonic, friend. And the last time they’d seen him he sacrificed himself to buy them a little time.
“I hated myself for feeling that way. For wanting something I couldn’t have and didn’t deserve. It made me so angry. I’d get mad at myself for thinking I might mean something to you. And mad at you for making me think it. But it wasn’t your fault.
“How? The reapers boarded up the door to the library from the other side. I’ve tried getting in, it ain’t happening. And we don’t even know if there was a way into the Empty from there. For all we know any travel back and forth was just Billie playing chess.”
“I’ll save you some time. Castiel stays. But cheers for the memories, boys. Now, off you pop.” He dismisses them with a wave of his hand.
Dean sighs. “Nothing. It just hit me that I’m older now than I ever thought I’d be and if I wanted to keep on getting older I had to start taking better care of myself. I thought you’d be happy about that.”
“I didn’t say anything.” Sam takes a few deep breaths. “Let me guess, you snuck away while he was asleep and never saw him again until tonight?”
“Uh,” Dean can feel the heat rushing to his cheeks. “I don’t know. I was young. He was only two years older but he was manly in a way that I really wasn’t back then. I was scrawny and soft looking. I mean I could still kick serious ass but you wouldn’t know it by looking at me.” Dean had hated it. He was finally an adult, but no one took him seriously because he looked like he should be in a boy band. Hell, even his kid brother towered over him. “Jeremiah, he was big and muscular. And he had this jaw… And he had this way of looking at me like he knew what I was thinking. And
Dean reads the posts a few more times to make sure he’s right. Nobody else talks—writes like that. He can practically hear the words in Cas’s steel-wool voice. All the details match too. There’s no doubt about it, the OP is Cas.
“People in comas are supposed to be able to hear when someone talks to them, I think. Don’t know where I heard that. Might’ve been a Stephen King novel. Doesn’t matter. I’m used to whole conversations without you ever looking at me. I used to wonder if you had some kind of celestial ADHD. I’ve memorized the back of your head.” Dean chuckles.
tried. He tried so hard with Lisa. She had loved him, the parts of him she could see. As much as he wanted it to work he never let himself relax with her. Never let his feelings go too deep because he knew as soon as his facade slipped and she got a glimpse of the ugliness underneath, it would be over. And he was right. Even if neither of them could acknowledge it.
“Anyway, we finished the hunt and Dad went to call Bobby and I was alone with Jeremiah. We said goodbye, maybe we’d see each other again sometime. I started walking away and he grabbed my arm. He had these big hands and a real firm grip and I spun around and I just kissed him. Right behind the motel where anyone coulda seen. When we pulled away he slipped something into my hand. His room key.
They get back to the bunker and go to their respective beds, Dean can’t sleep. Also par for the course. He goes to the kitchen and takes a beer from the fridge.
Dean falls silent. He drops his head to his hands. After everything, gathering the ingredients for the spell, convincing the queen of Hell to build them a Psychopomp, out-arguing the Empty, this is how it ends?
Cas shakes his head. “I didn’t need to hear more. You made it clear how you feel. And I accept it. You don’t have to say it again. I just needed a minute because I was…sad.” He bites his lip. “I’ll go.”
“Not an angel.” Empty-Crowley laughs. Hearing Crowley’s laugh coming from something so not Crowley is off-putting, to say the least. “Oh, that’s good!” He wipes his eyes. “It’s utter bullocks, but it’s good. I’m starting to understand why this form found you so amusing.”
“No offense, but you sound really codependent. You work together and have lived together. Do you live together now? Do you have any other friends who could support you if this goes South?”
Sam had suggested holding a hunter’s funeral for Cas after the dust from the battle with Chuck had settled, but Dean refused because there was no body to burn. Sam invited a bunch of people to the bunker anyway. Charlie, Bobby, Garth, Jody and Donna and the girls. He told Dean it was a celebration of them surviving. He made a toast to the people they’d lost and asked if anyone wanted to say anything but Dean just chided him for bringing down the mood and turned up the music. The thing is, he wasn’t just doing it for Dean. Cas was a part of Sam’s life for over a decade. He would’ve liked the chance to say goodbye. He needs the talk almost as much as Dean does.
Third obstacle: Psychopomps can’t be created from nothing. You need a ghost to build one on. You need a willing ghost. Ghosts are not overly fond of the Winchesters.
“You want me to drive?” Sam clarifies. Usually, this only happens as a slap on the back for a good outcome on a bad case or when Dean is too hurt or drunk to drive. Today’s hunt was run of the mill.
Or is it? Dean has never seen Sam flirt with a guy or try to make Cas uncomfortable. Then again Dean isn’t in love with Sam. He’s not watching every little thing Sam does for a sign that he’s interested. Besides, everything else he wrote: selfless, kind, gifted. That’s Sam.
“We also adopted a puppy. She tries to eat everything that isn’t nailed down. Naturally, I wanted to name her Dean but we went with Judy instead. Judy the puppy.
Everyone is entitled to their guilty pleasures and okay, Dean has more than his share, but this might be the guiltiest of them all. He’s addicted to the romance/relationships sub-board of HELP_ME_HIVE_MIND.COM
“Cas is also talking about getting a few beehives, but Dean is less enthusiastic about that idea. There was this case, involving bugs and— less said about that one the better.
That hits a nerve. Dean knows too well what it’s like to be raised to serve an agenda. How hard it is to shake that feeling of worthlessness. That’s probably why he and Cas got so close so fast. They both—
“Perfect, how about I buy you one?” Dean guides Jeremiah to a couple of barstools toward the end of the bar. Probably shouldn’t have an audience for this conversation. “I can’t believe we just ran into you.” He shakes his head.
Cas smiles, though it only reaches one side of his mouth. “Yes. Definitely. I love you, Sam.” He nods repeatedly.
“I’ve lost track of how many times you’ve saved me. Healed me. Fixed me. But there are some things even you can’t fix. I’m just… I’m broken, Cas.”
“You usually do,” Sam says. “Most of the time I can’t get you to shut up but I never heard about this guy until today.”
“You disappear without a word and then I track you to some murder-barn in the middle of nowhere? What was I supposed to think?” He gestures to the dilapidated roof. “I had a panic attack trying to get through the doors because I was sure I’d find you swinging from the rafters!” Sam shouts, chest heaving.
“I wasn’t flustered! I was just surprised. I hadn’t seen him in a long time and he was…” Dean trails off.
Sam’s got his hands clasped and his head bent. “Castiel? Can you come to the bunker, please? I’ve got something important to tell you,” he prays. This isn’t the kind of thing you do over the phone.
“Wait! I won’t ask you to bring Cas back again! But can you help me find Dean? This is barely a favor. Jody already has highway patrol keeping an eye out for the Impala. I’ll find him eventually, I just want to speed it up." Before he does something stupid.
“He was doing what he thought was right.” His idea of right was questionable but in his way, he was protecting his sons. Dean knows that. He’s made peace with it.
Dean laughs. He makes it sound so simple. It can’t be that simple. But does it have to be that complicated? Can it just be?
Dean shot to his feet and stood frozen to the spot until John pulled the splintered door closed. Then he fell onto the bed, shaking and crying. John hadn’t made him cry like that since the night Sammy left for school. He figured he was immune by then.
“Cas, wait. You don’t have to go anywhere. You aren’t the problem. I’m the problem.” Dean is crying again. Awesome.
strange. Anyway, they’re still at the bunker but lately Cas has started talking about opening a Bed and Breakfast. He says he wants to help people feel comfortable. And Dean doesn’t seem to hate the idea. Which is just proof of how much happiness has changed him. Then again he does love both bed and breakfast.
No wonder he’s a little gun-shy. Dean decides it’s time to weigh in. He’s never commented on one of these before, usually someone already said exactly what he was thinking a few hundred comments ago, but not this time. He already has a login though he’s only ever used it in the auto maintenance sub-board. It’s crazy to him how few people know how to replace a fan-belt these days.
“You were made to be a vessel for Michael so you could kill Lucifer and your brother and end the world.”
“C’mon Sam, it all adds up. Sheltered guy from a large religious family? Only friends are two brothers he’s known for over a decade? Can’t pick up unspoken cues?”
“Cas, stop. Maybe I would’ve done it a few more times if he hadn’t found out but I would’ve come to the same conclusion.”
Before Sam can say anything Kevin’s hand is on his shoulder and they’re back in the black void of the Empty.
“Cas?” his voice cracks. “Cas, you listening?” It’s no use, he’s not coming back. He offered Dean his heart and Dean crushed it under his heal. Cas doesn’t owe him the chance to make amends. He may never come back and that could be for the best.
Dean wipes his eyes and stands. He needs to get out of the bunker for a while. He’ll take Baby for a drive. To clear his head. Definitely not to drive off a cliff. He can do this. He grabs his jacket and keys and heads for the garage.
They do not know that Castiel is broken, although he knows they may suspect. They do not know that there is a crack inside him, getting deeper, filling up with
, and he kind of wishes he could talk to her, try to crack through that porcelain veneer of perfection and know what she really thinks; whether she
No maid comes in to wake him in the morning, and so Castiel - after several nights of interrupted rest, making his pilgrimages to Dean’s bed - sleeps in far later than he usually would. There is an abundance of crisp fall light brightening the room by the time he realises it, and yet no one has brought up the regular breakfast tray; by now, Castiel isn’t used to waking without the scent of coffee filling his nose, and he shifts uncomfortably in his bed.
‘It’s just for today,’ Castiel clarifies again. ‘They’re Gabriel’s - like when he sends over the carriage. I usually walk, but I know it’s… I’ve been informed that my idea of a short walk is not one shared by the general population. I assumed you could ride.’
He doesn’t really want to see anyone else, after that, but the following day his mother has arranged for him to take a walk along the riverfront with Daphne Allen, and Castiel is well aware of how it would appear were he to cancel. Mercifully, Anna has been sent once again as an intermediary, so they are able to take turns pushing her in her wicker wheelchair (Castiel is not used to days full of activity anymore, and he’s quite tempted to make use of the wheelchair himself, although his sister ignores him when he suggests it). Mrs. Allen arrives promptly in a pale blue promenade suit - a little on the plainer side but for its lace detailing, but the effect is pretty. Castiel bows slightly in greeting, and is startled by the way her face illuminates at the address.
‘I am the pastor,’ says Castiel, immediately. ‘It’s - Inias has been covering the role for me, but it’s still - I’m still-’
This time, Castiel does almost turn. He visibly forces himself into stillness, his voice gravelly as he begins, ‘You can’t go-’ just enough for Dean’s stomach to turn for a split second, before he adds, ‘-alone. Dean, it isn’t safe.’
The church is just a church. Dean’s not sure how Castiel wants him to react. It’s got church stuff in it: carved pews, tall windows, crosses all over the place. It’s literally just a church.
’ - on purpose in an attempt to shock or annoy Dean, but Dean isn't easily shocked and Gabriel isn't wrong. ‘You can’t even get knocked up, it would barely count.’
The clothes fit, more or less, not that Dean can see more than a few inches of himself in the little mirror in his room. Castiel still stares at him when he reemerges, assessing whether Dean’s gonna embarrass him in the house of God or whatever. Which, Dean probably is, but it’s unlikely to be his pants that are the issue.
The rush starts around 10.30. The counties who have counted and sent their results in earlier in the evening have been weighted in Michael’s favour: now it feels as though there is a near constant stream of telegraphs being delivered, and the strange chime of the telephone is starting to give Dean a headache, reverberating in his skull like the bone is vibrating. Every time more numbers come in, the staffers and party members in the hall send up great raucous cheers or howls of complaint, banging on tables. It is more of a party atmosphere than anything Dean’s seen since he’s been here - even at their dinner parties, even when they have guests over, no one actually seems to have fun; nobody seems to
Before Castiel can realising what he’s doing, his brother takes hold of Dean’s wrists, pulls them firmly towards him, and rubs them against the scent gland at his neck - Castiel almost yelps at the obscenity - and then Michael is at Dean’s throat again, pressed hard against him until Dean’s scent is all but swallowed up by Michael’s own. Until Dean is - scent-marked, thoroughly, as hot and conspicuous as a brand against his skin - and then Michael steps away and Dean stumbles back against the panelling.
The sick motherfuckers are gonna force him open, and they’re gonna laugh about how loose and puffy and raw he is, and they’re gonna act like that
Yeah, he’s definitely not going to relax. She takes a couple of steps closer, then goes to yank the curtains fully open, cracking the window open an inch or two, giving him time to get a look at her. Ordinary white shirtwaist and long navy skirts; ordinary brown hair; deliberately ordinary conversational tone, like she’s trying to keep him calm but doesn’t want him to realise she’s doing it. She smells good, though, comforting, like freshly baked bread. An omega? She doesn’t move like an omega.
‘Just a few things we need to iron out, now that you’re back in the fold,’ Zachariah says, sitting down. ‘Where, when, who, that sort of thing. Get you back out into the world, Castiel, as you should be. You said you missed your own house, didn’t you?’
If the point is to humiliate him - and Dean’s starting to figure out that that’s usually the point, when it comes to Michael - it’s going to work. Michael’s punishing him, and it can only be about the timing of his heat; Dean doesn’t have any control over that, and believe him he wishes he did, but alphas don’t always seem to get that. So, Dean’s inconvenienced him, or something. He clutches the sheet at his hips, trying to knot it into something more secure, but he’s very obviously naked underneath it, and at minimum - absolute minimum - he’d give almost anything to wash his hands right now. He’d give a hell of a lot to sleep for another twelve hours, too, but that doesn’t seem like it’s in the offing.
Dean’s pressed up against it almost immediately, his sheets tangled around his legs. It’s locked from the outside, but he knows they leave the key in the lock while he’s in there. He hisses, ‘Who-?’ because he’s too afraid to say ‘Cas?’ and have it not be Cas, and damn them both.
Naomi clears her throat a little, making her way towards him. She doesn’t try to come up the steps or anything, the way an alpha would usually challenge him for the height advantage, and he doesn’t know what to make of that - whether she doesn’t want to challenge him, or just doesn’t want him to think she is. Her expression is very neutral, almost pleasant. Her scent is sort of - tamped back, or something? ‘Dean, I’m not sure what Castiel has said to you, but I can assure you nobody is going to make you do anything you don’t agree to.’
Chapter specific content warning, though I'm not sure how to warn for it: Michael's scent effectively roofies Dean. Dean is placed in a vulnerable situation by someone with a lot more power than him, and isn't properly capable of consent. No sexual/violent assault, but he does feel violated by it.
Although Topeka is only 26 miles from Lawrence, in the US trains ran much slower and would read speeds of just 25mph in the West until the late 19th century - it would therefore take about an hour to get between them by train. The alternative was eight hours by horse and carriage, so.
‘No,’ he says, desperately. ‘No - please - please don’t-’ and he hates himself for begging, he hates himself for being so fucking pathetic, he hates himself for being so far removed from his younger self, from John Winchester’s son.
The horse fidgets slightly on the spot, bumping his shoulder with its nose. Dean laughs very softly, reaching out towards the chestnut, which is turning its head to inspect him.
Cautiously, Castiel pulls his shirt up over his head, and straightens with it clutched between his hands. He spends longer than necessary folding it, setting it on the ground, and then abruptly shakes himself into a resolution and removes his pants faster, shucking off each leg in as efficient and businesslike a manner as he can assume, followed by his underwear. He does not look at Dean as he does so. He is afraid to know whether Dean’s eyes are upon his back, although he imagines he can feel the heat of them.
John Draper wrote 'The History of the Conflict between Religion and Science' (1875), and Andrew White wrote 'The Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom' (1876, expanded as The History of the Warfare… in 1896). Lots of my sources for this section are from here: https://www.victorianweb.org/science/science&religion.html
He actually fucking glances at Cas. Incredible. Dean’s bounced back to team ‘liking this guy’, and Cas is standing there with his expression completely unchanged, like the joke has sprouted wings and flown so far over his head he’d need binoculars to see it.
Cas’ scent goes smokier at the words. Dean wants to inhale it so fucking bad. He wants to breathe it for hours.
He has already collected a large bundle from the lady at the General Store first thing that morning; he slides the brown paper parcel into the saddlebags of the chestnut horse, and flinches a little when it turns its head to see what he’s doing. Dean laughs, catches it by the bridle, says, ‘Sorry, baby, he shoulda warned you. Raised in a barn, this guy.’
Castiel isn’t sure how much Anna knows. What exactly needed to be fixed. He’s not sure most women would sign up for that level of project management. ‘Maybe,’ he says, and then, because there’s a fair journey ahead of them and she looks like she’s going to continue in this vein unless he heads her off at the pass, ‘Would you like to play Grandmother’s Trunk?’
‘We are blessed, as a family, with the superior breeding and intellect that gives us authority over lesser men and women; we are blessed with our true and appropriate roles of alpha and omega, that teach us where we belong in society; as such we have a responsibility to guide those lesser creatures, and to educate them where we must.’ It sounds as though this speech is going to be a long one. Castiel wishes he had more coffee, and glances around for Dean to pour it.
‘Mr. Milton,’ she says, brightly. ‘And - Miss Milton. What a delight to see you both again. I trust you are fully recovered?’
It is not long after polls have closed, and the hall is thick with bodies: local politicians in identical black suits and hats, arguing over predictions and dredging up old disagreements. With the exception of the odd ambitious beta, they’re all alpha gentlemen, which means that in very little time there’s practically a cloud of competing scents - too many alphas in one space often leads to conflict as they naturally vy for dominance - all crowded beneath the fog of tobacco smoke and confident voices. It’s too loud and busy for Dean to remain in the thick of it, and the alpha scents make him nervous: not long after the telephone rings for the first time, he’s sent out onto the front porch to receive telegrams as they arrive, and it’s a relief to get some distance from the overwhelming atmosphere.
Notes based upon the report of a female nurse, with whom the Patient has developed a friendship. She reports the Patient has spoken further with her about the omega male first mentioned in consultation on July 14th, although the Patient has declined to give further details about this omega in any sessions since then, before today. The Patient speaks of his great concern for this omega’s welfare, and otherwise refers to him as if describing a mate bond, although he denies such a relationship exists. He experiences great guilt around the existence and perversion of this bond, and confirms a sexual relationship of some sort has taken place, though his concern in this regard is primarily its impact upon the omega male.
‘Thank you,’ says Cas, awkwardly, his voice slightly muffled as he rummages through Dean’s stuff. ‘I still think you need to be comfortable, though.’
The Matron is watching him, unexpressive. For a moment, there is a flat silence between them; then she leans forward and pulls a small rotary lever. Castiel imagines he can hear the servants’ bell ring, down the hallway.
be worth the price of admittance. And you’ve never had an omega to bring, it’ll take some of the heat off me.’ He licks the batter off his finger. Castiel looks aggrieved.
‘You don’t have to stand in the door,’ he pants, and then gets distracted. ‘What have you - what’s-?’
The Patient is the youngest of five children, and comes from a highly-respected family, although for professional reasons he has distanced himself from the family name in adulthood. Otherwise his relationship with his family appears close. He has two alpha brothers, one beta, and an omega sister; all the brothers are stable and successful, although the sister suffers hysteria and episodes of violent insanity that suggest a congenital element to the Patient’s condition. The Patient has never known his father and is unable to answer direct questions about his history or mental state.
He appears willing to pursue marriage, as desired by his family, and believes he will be able to realise this intention without relapsing into his former inversions; he admits that his interest in the female sex remains lacking, but hopes to be able to address this in his continuing hypnotic treatment.
This time, when Cas peels himself out of the dirty bed a couple of hours later, Dean jerks awake. The room is almost entirely dark by now, with the candle burned out to a stump and no window to leak moonlight through, but Castiel knows all the same; knows the pattern of Dean’s breath and the shifting tension in his muscles and the tiny permutations of his scent. He could draw Dean in the dark.
Or perhaps not, because then Jody makes him clean out the chamberpot with hot water and soda, and laundry’s looking pretty good in comparison.
Perhaps that’s true, Castiel thinks from time to time. Simply because he - the youngest and least central to the family political sphere - is not privy to that information, does not mean the information does not exist: perhaps his mother or Michael, as the eldest son, are still somehow in contact with his father. They behave as such. And so, Castiel behaves as such as well.
Before Dean realises it’s about to happen, Gabriel snakes out a hand and swats him, mock-playfully, on the ass, and Dean
If Cas chooses to stay, Dean will go anyway. He has to. Castiel is kind and strange and confusing and clever, and Dean wants him. He wants to make fun of his dumb books, and mess up his hair, and kiss the sharp line of his jaw, and keep him safe from everyone who thinks Cas is broken, or sick, or a deviant. Wanting things is new and complicated: the thing about having desires, all of a sudden, is that as soon as he recognises them for what they are, they burn in his stomach and pound in his bloodstream, nagging and desperate to be realised. But if it comes down to it, Dean’s got to save himself.
‘I have, uh, spare nightshirts,’ he says. ‘A couple of sleeping suits. Whatever you prefer. If you want them.’
Castiel shifts a little in his seat. It is a familiar speech. Perhaps it is a consequence of the conversation with Dean back in the carriage - ‘
It smells as though the heat is reaching its end, anyway. It’s likely Dean’s fever will have broken by the following afternoon, and then Castiel won’t have an excuse to return.
The carriage turns onto the long driveway, and Castiel stares ahead at the house, illuminated by arching gas lamps even though the sun is not yet fully set. There are already several carriages outside, shining horses shifting restless on the spot as guests make their way up to the house: Castiel can see the a tall, silhouetted figure that must be Michael, with his wife on his arm and - as ever - three exceptionally beautiful omegas following in his wake with their heads bowed. Michael has always been a  collector.
‘I should break your goddamn face,’ he says, but not like he’s about to. The line of his jaw is tight, almost painful. ‘That stunt you pulled. That fucking - you - what were you tryna do to me, Cas? What the fuck were you-’ he cuts himself off, breathing with an effort. ‘Why are you holding a chicken?’
The black horse whinnies, and Dean laughs, breaking off mid-verse. ‘Hey, Cas, she’s a fan. You wanna serenade your girl, there? Sweeten her right up.’
The thing is, he can do the cooking and cleaning thing, probably. Not that he’s worked in a house like this for anyone before, but it’s only a stricter, cleaned-up version of what he used to do for his dad and Sammy. Make sure everyone was fed, make sure Sam’s clothes were patched so nobody would take him for some kind of fucking urchin, do whatever he was told to do on John’s endless crusade West from frontier town to frontier town, take a beating when he’d earned a beating. Even at St. Mary’s, he’d done alright with the chores - scrubbing floors, drawing fires, the endless laundry. God, the laundry had gone on forever.
His mother coughs a little, the sort that means Castiel has misjudged the level of small talk required.
He wonders what would happen to the man on his knees, if Castiel continued on - perhaps took in the pretty brunette woman with the strong throwing arm, taught her scripture and the value of domestic work, helped her understand the depth of her sins and pray for God’s forgiveness. She might be saved, but then again, she might be saved even without his help. Dean, still soaked and bloody and trembling with anger and adrenaline, would be locked into solitary confinement for god knows how long - weeks, he suspects - to eat and sleep and defecate wherever he is left, and eventually rejoin the rest of the institution, half-mad, to start the cycle again. Eventually, he thinks, they will give up; eventually they will put him in an asylum. Castiel knows that. He knows how that works.
It’s still cold out. It’s still dark, outside of the golden semi-circle of lamplight at the front of the house, where dozens of disciples wait for news. He bumps shoulders with Gabriel as he’s circling round - the beta’s only just arriving, even though it’s past midnight, apparently having decided to skip the long period of waiting and show up only for the anticipated party that will take place once enough numbers have been counted - and Gabriel laughs at the sight of him.
He startles a little. She’s clearly noticed him from some distance away, and come hurtling towards him as if he might evaporate into thin air: for an alarming second he thinks she’s about to throw her arms around him. He’s not - he wouldn’t hate the idea, exactly, not in principle, but he’s hard-pressed to think of a time anyone’s ever really hugged him, and he’s not sure how he’d be supposed to react, and he’s not sure he’s got the time to figure it out. Anyway, thankfully she pulls up short just a couple of steps in front of him and pants, ‘One sec-’ while she unsheathes a vicious looking hat pin, readjusts her headpiece, and stabs it back in more securely.
Michael is standing directly in front of him, dressed in his usual tailored suit. Behind him - the lawyer, Crowley, and their mother. For a few moments, Castiel just stares at them, trying to make sense of the situation, and then he snaps, ‘What - why have I been-?’ and his mother clicks her tongue, as if disappointed.
It is not much quieter here, in truth. There are fewer bodies milling about, but the babble of voices spills out from the entrance hall, and lamplight leaks over shiny black carriages until they gleam like spilled oil; local news reporters are mostly settled indoors, but their photographers and assistants loiter out on the veranda and the manicured grass, smoking pipes and gossiping as others make their way in and out. It’s a cold, still night.
‘He only usually wants toast and marmalade in the morning,’ she says, like maybe that’s the problem. ‘I sometimes bring ‘round biscuits if I’ve been baking. And if he’s visiting people in the town they’ll often keep him for dinner, so you shouldn’t have to prepare a big meal every day.’
He feels Dean shift a little, behind him, and although it would not be proper to acknowledge him at this moment, it is slightly reassuring.
The man is shorter than him by a few inches, wearing a well tailored dark suit; he smirks when Castiel twists to look at him, narrowing his eyes.
After his heat. There had been the very slightest whisper of heat scent lingering, under the steam and soap. Dean’s shoulders had been freckled; his back marked with old scars in various shapes and sizes - some of them strikingly vicious - and when he had stretched his arms the muscles under the skin had shifted with him.
Castiel doubts many alphas have ever tried it. It’s the wrong kind of deviance, as unnatural as it gets, lowering yourself to an omega’s role.
Cas is standing very still on the porch, his hands buried deep inside the pockets of his formal suit, his shoulders hunched. He has not been as carefully groomed for this performance as Dean has been; although his suit is also pressed and his shoes freshly shined, there is the shadow of facial hair at his sharp jaw that says he has not shaved for the occasion. Dean likes that, sort of: it makes Cas look more human, less perfect and mechanical.
‘We can steal one,’ pants Cas, who rebelled like one time and has now apparently committed to it. ‘We can-’
‘Castiel has committed himself to an asylum,’ she says, and the words burn in his mind like a lingering handprint.
They say ‘home’. Castiel is fairly sure they don’t mean his home - not the little house beside the church, with its neat porch and green shutters; he asked about it, early on, when he still asked about things, and was reassured that his work duties had been taken over by Inias full time. Mostly likely, then, Inias is also living up at the house. It would be the most practical solution.
‘That’s it, baby,’ he mumbles, lifting himself up a little from the mattress so that he’s resting his weight on his elbows; so he can really see what Cas is doing. ‘That’s it, you got it.’
‘Not too far at all,’ his mother intervenes. He squints at her. ‘Mrs. Allen takes on many charitable pursuits that call for her to travel, isn’t that so?’
‘You know you’re not going to be safe here on your own,’ Naomi says, practically. ‘It won’t be long before people in the town learn where he is; someone else will have to take over his job responsibilities, and most likely the house will go along with that. Without Castiel to take care of you, you know you’d have to be returned to the Refuge, if you do refuse to come with me?’
Inias is a thin-faced, dark-haired man in a navy suit. It’s no more formal than anything Castiel usually wears, but he looks less crumpled in it than Castiel usually looks. He seems pleased to see him, though, which makes him the first person since Castiel was discharged.
‘There is little more important than a religious education,’ Mrs. Allen says to Castiel, and it takes him a few seconds to replay the last few moments of conversation and make sense of this. When he does, he nods again, more earnestly.
The first time, Dean’s sweeping the hearth in the dining room, and he only just hears it; he’s heading through to the kitchen with a dustpan full of cinders to bank the kitchen fire, and dumps them quickly in order to wipe his hands on his pants and answer it. It’s only once the door is open and he’s staring out at the still, empty night, that he realises how odd it is. Castiel’s guests do not knock at the back door. Jody certainly wouldn’t - she would let herself in, same as always. He stands there for a minute all the same, hearing nothing but the crickets and katydids, before he closes the door again.
Remembering himself, Castiel turns around to watch Dean climb down after him; with his hands cuffed behind his back, he struggles to keep his balance on the thin step and pitches forward. Castiel catches him by the shoulder to steady him, and gets glowered at for his trouble.
He’s still in that same phase Bobby was in for a while, the one where every time Dean walks into a room he can’t help but stop whatever he’s doing and just sort of stare at him, dazed, like he’s been hit over the head with something. At least Bobby had the dignity to pretend like he wasn’t watching Dean’s every move and duck into a different room every time either of them got tearful: Sam just goggles openly, all bright eyes and too-long limbs and puppyish expressions.
The thing is, she’s right. And yes, sure, they’d been friends, sort of, and yes, they’d fucked a couple of times when they’d been able to get away with it, and it’d been good - it’d been amazing - and maybe Dean had entertained the fantasy of - okay, of whatever, that he could have a life like that maybe, if he ever got out of there. That they’d fake like they were married or something, like real people - as if legally omega-omega marriages would ever be considered valid - have a life like real people. He’d known it was stupid, obviously. They hadn’t even known each other that well. He hadn’t got to say goodbye to her, when Cas took him out of there.
She immediately raises her hands up a little, warily. ‘Hey,’ she says. ‘Alright, relax. It’s Dean, isn’t it?’
‘Cheer up, sweetheart,’ says the British guy. ‘From what we’ve heard, sounds like you might enjoy it.’
He’s given so many blowjobs - professional and efficient; carefully making his throat go slack and breathing through his nose so that whichever alpha could fuck his face; not fighting it when tears leaked down his cheeks or he gagged, so that it could be over sooner - and he never imagined it could be like this.
Dean swallows. ‘Uh. I mean it’s - I want it, obviously. My body wants it. I just - I usually just - get myself off, or fuck myself with,’ he waves a hand significantly, ‘and that takes the edge off. It don’t kill me, it’s just not the same exactly.’ He licks his dry lips. ‘I know I’m not supposed to do it. Like, that it’s sinful.’
So logically, Michael’s not here to rape him right this minute, at least not if he’s brought other people with him, but - if he’d been here any earlier, even a few hours, Dean wouldn’t have bet his life on it.
Castiel repeats, remembering as soon as he hears it, and has to pretend to simply be fond of the name - and she seems quite earnestly impressed by Castiel’s work and education. For all Castiel is suspicious of his mother’s motives, she is pleasant enough company - probably more pleasant than it would be to be left sitting between his mother and Anna alone. It doesn’t make the rising nausea at the back of his throat go away. Nothing does.
He doesn’t expect anyone to hear him, to be honest, let alone listen, but perhaps he is affected by the scene before him, the sobbing women, the overpowering scent of distress, because the word comes out as an order. The Overseer with his boot on the man’s head - a beta, he realises now, undoubtedly overcompensating - pulls back a little, as if realising for the first time that Castiel is there at all. Castiel grits his teeth, pushes back the hesitation, says, ‘
Sorry for the lack of the usual Friday post - I was at the wedding of one of my oldest friends. Normal service resumes here!
Cas deserves this. He wants it for Cas as much as he wants it for himself. As long as Dean keeps fighting, Cas will keep fighting back, and he deserves that. God knows he'll feel better for it.
Dean’s still busy, during the days - it’s only now that someone is actually doing it that Castiel realises how much work goes into keeping a house clean, and Dean seems to have thrown himself into it entirely at this point. Castiel keeps letting himself into the kitchen and getting dirty glares thrown at him when he realises, too late, that the floor has just been scrubbed - but sometimes when Castiel is working in his study in the evenings, Dean will let himself in under the pretence of retrieving the supper dishes or stoking the fire, and just kind of… linger. Castiel will be three pages into a letter to some pastor in Wichita (he has, at this point in his career, an extensive network he’s in communication with, and not just in Kansas), and Dean will hang around, picking through stray books or pamphlets, occasionally making faintly wry grunts or complaining about the layer of dust Castiel has spent years cultivating on his bookshelves. Castiel doesn’t think much of it, except that - well, except that it’s nice to have Dean where he can keep an eye on him; but after about a week of this it occurs to him that Dean might actually
‘Cas,’ he says, after a moment. His voice - his breath - is much closer to Castiel’s ear than expected. Castiel does not flinch; he almost leans towards it, towards where he knows Dean’s mouth to be. ‘Why are you reading about true mates?’
There’s boot polish under his nails and he should probably wash his hands first, but all the same he goes to sit next to her on the porch bench so they’re shaded from the sun, looking out to the dusty road. Her skirts swish softly as she sits.
Or - perhaps he does. She is a pretty brunette omega, a touch of honey to her hair, and he thinks perhaps they have been introduced before - or, no, he knew her husband before he moved further afield to get married and began attending a different church. Emmanuel Allen: Castiel had heard of his death with sorrow, although he doesn’t remember the cause. He cannot remember this woman’s name, although she is faintly familiar. Perhaps they have not met since she was widowed, then.
Castiel doesn’t panic, exactly, but he doesn’t not panic. Dean has been standing behind him for hours now; had been perfectly attentive throughout the meal, even though Castiel had been fully aware - had heard him fidgeting and shifting his weight - that the omega had been bored or hungry. He should have made sure Dean ate before they came out, but of course, it had never occurred to him before that the attending omegas never eat at these parties. He wishes, bizarrely, that he had managed to set aside one of the little apple tarts. He thinks perhaps Dean might have liked it.
‘You can’t keep me from resuming my job role,’ he says. ‘I can discuss it with Inias, I saw him today. I’m of sound mind.’
Cas doesn’t swing around to look at him, but he twitches slightly as if he’s physically restraining himself from doing so. His breath catches. ‘What?’
Laudanum was used as a cure-all medicine in the 19th century, was massively addictive, over-prescribed, and extremely easy to overdose on. Although its usage was so normalised, there was moral controversy around it (partly for good reasons, partly unfortunately the old anti-Asian racism and association with opium dens as a Chinese import). It's usually a tincture of opium and alcohol: although Kansas was dry at the time, the exception was medicinal purposes. All the same I did look at other recipes for stuff like Godfrey’s Cordial (also called Mother’s Friend), which was opium, water and treacle.
‘Nnnn,’ says Dean. He wants to get his mouth on the underside of Cas’ jaw. It’s suddenly very important. ‘There’s some stuff under the bed.’
‘I’m not going to lie to you, Dean,’ says Castiel, very seriously, ‘I’m probably not going to wash these blankets myself.’
He’s not a bad liar, not when he has time to prepare, but he knows that his eyes go wide and alarmed before he can catch himself.
‘What was I supposed to do?’ she snaps back, instantly defensive. ‘I didn’t have - they had your contract record out when I was cleaning; the address of this guy Novak. I didn’t know where to go, I thought you-’
bringing him down here now,’ and immediately starts to slow his steps. She sounds annoyed. So, when his brother answers, does Michael.
They remain in the sweltering drawing room for an hour or so, making polite conversation steered carefully by Castiel’s mother. Mrs. Allen has no children - her husband’s health deteriorated too quickly after their wedding - but is young enough yet to remarry; her Christian name turns out to be Daphne - ‘
The man is on him almost immediately, and he smells like sex. Castiel has never known how to identify this scent, although now in retrospect he knows he’s smelled it before: the man is on him, open-mouthed and half-mad, dragging Castiel down onto the mattress and crawling up his body to scent hungrily at his neck, groaning his satisfaction.
He’d forgotten that he was carrying them, and now - thought processes thoroughly wiped out by the flick of Dean’s hand - it feels, suddenly, very stupid. He shrugs awkwardly with the large bundle in his arms. ‘I brought some blankets. For your - to make you more comfortable. I’m sorry it’s too - I should’ve done it earlier. I know your heat’s almost over now, it’s probably pointless.’
‘Potato,’ says Balthazar, very seriously. ‘Potahto.’ He snaps his fingers at Dean, which immediately cancels out any points the illegal alcohol got him. ‘Point me towards the kitchen, will you?’
‘Jesus,’ says Gabriel. ‘First of all: terrible. Secondly, stop doing that. Is Dean honestly still at mother’s?’
Chapter specific content warning: dubious consent sexual situation; Dean tries to initiate sex under the mistaken impression Castiel is demanding it.
It might be pleasant, to have a companion. It might be more pleasant if the companion stopped telling him to shut up, but all the same, Castiel thinks - despite the odd twinge of something that might be reluctance to admit that his family was right on this front - perhaps it is time to keep a general servant. Technically, according to his mother, his position requires that he keeps at least two, but he can work up to that, once he’s used to having someone underfoot. And if Dean doesn’t calm down, doesn’t respond to discipline. keeps answering back and refusing to learn - he can, after all, return him to the Refuge. It is only his own pride that argues otherwise, and Castiel must not be prideful.
‘What exactly,’ says Michael, his voice acidic, ‘do you intend to do with your little pet, then? If you return him to the Refuge, I’ll take him on. If you pass him on to anyone else, I’ll buy him. If you keep him, you’ll be unemployed and homeless and - I promise you - cast out of this family in every way you can possibly imagine.’
‘Uh,’ says Cas, from behind them. ‘Lisa, Dean - this is my old friend, Balthazar. We studied together. In the seminary.’
Balthazar’s face softens a little. ‘Of course I am. I may have left the church, Cas, but you’re still like a brother to me. That much hasn’t changed.’
It’s weird as hell to be paraded through the hallway, barely decent and only a couple of hours out of his fever. They pass a couple of staff members - Tarrell, who’s a beta, can’t smell the lingering heat on him, but he still goggles openly at the state of Dean, and the lower-ranking omega maids linger in the doorways instead of doing their jobs - but no one gives Dean any more of an idea where he’s supposed to be going. It’s enough time for the mortifying self-consciousness to set in, and Dean’s trying very hard not to look down at his chest and find out whether there are any remaining streaks or stains of various bodily fluids. He really doesn’t want to know the answer to that particular question.
He shifts on the spot for a moment when Castiel doesn’t respond, then turns on his heel. Castiel doesn’t bother following him to the front door to see him out. Something buzzes hot beneath his skin. He does not want to look at Dean.
‘You hadn’t planned specifically, but you saw - how big is he, six feet? You saw Frankenstein’s Monster over here and just couldn’t resist?’
‘I’m not sure you understand, kitten,’ says the British guy. ‘You can just tell us, and we’ll let you go about your business, take the bath you
The Vigenère Cipher was the only famous 19th code I could think of, lmao. It was created by Giovan Battista Bellaso in the 16th century, but named (for the wrong guy) in the 19th century, but wasn't broken until 1863. Something fun to consider next time you're fingering someone.
He knows his eyes are too bright. He knows he’s shaking. But so are Castiel’s, and so is Cas. They’re standing too close together in the narrow hallway, none of the lamps lit, and Dean’s Sunday suit is the only thing keeping his body from splintering into pieces, and Cas’ breath is ragged.
He’s kept that coat beneath his bed for months, praying that one day Cas would come back for him. That one day he would be himself again. Wearing it now - and it’s still grubby, and rumpled, and it’s somehow
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Anna in her wicker wheelchair, quietly rolling herself out of the room. How odd.
‘I haven’t done anything,’ he says, pointlessly. It catches Michael’s attention; his brother turns a dispassionate face upon him.
The beast inside Castiel wants to strike. The beast inside Castiel wants to howl and snarl and rip at him; wants to hurl his brother aside, tear at his throat, cover Dean with his own body. This doesn’t make any sense.
It’s an easy deal to make, though. The guy even shakes Lisa’s hand when she agrees, like she isn’t a lady or an omega. His carriage is waiting down the road, out of the way so no one looking out of their windows nearby will realise he’s here for Cas, but he doesn’t seem in any hurry to get back to it - very quickly he’s perched on the edge of the kitchen table, reminiscing about his time with Cas in the seminary in a way Cas insists is inaccurate, and then both alphas make a point of heading into the study to look at some of Cas’ books in order to leave Dean and Lisa alone to say their goodbyes.
He’s met with another problem when he emerges from the water and can no longer keep his back to Dean (he is very confident Dean would laugh himself sick if Castiel tried to turn himself around and back out of the water in an effort to preserve his decency). He can tell that Dean has had the same thought by the stubborn expression the omega gets, like he’s daring Castiel to come out and face him full-frontal; Castiel treads water for a few seconds, anxious, before Dean takes pity and yells, ‘I’ll close my fuckin’ eyes, relax.’
It has been two weeks since he caned Dean over the kitchen table, until Dean had fallen to his knees with a mouth bitten full of blood and slumped, shaking, in Castiel’s arms. He has not touched the omega since, not even to brush against him in the hallway or meet his fingers while accepting the tea tray in his study. Something in Castiel had expected, perhaps, for Dean to hold a grudge - the man is combative at the best of times, a known brawler according to his papers - but he hadn’t appeared to consider Castiel at fault. ‘
His mother comes in the carriage to collect him: it makes him feel like a child, but any sense of emasculation is quickly cancelled out by relief - that he is being accepted back by his family at all, that no one speaks aloud of what they must surely suspect took place before his admission to the hospital, that the world has not closed its doors to him entirely. Instead, she leads the conversation with practical updates upon his circumstances: that he will be living at the Milton house indefinitely, certainly during his period of rest and recovery; that he will be neither expected to work nor live independently in that time; that his outpatient visits to the hospital will indeed continue in the following months. She does not say explicitly - although even Castiel is able to deduce - that his condition has been kept a secret from the people of the town; the parishioners are under the impression he suffered from nervous exhaustion due to overwork, and had been sent away for a peaceful retreat to rest his nerves. All firmly agreed that such a thing was only to be expected of an alpha of his standing with no mate or family, and precious little in the way of domestic staff. It was not, after all, the natural way such a man should live.
He’s at the top of the stairs, just at the edge of the landing, and Cas is standing in the middle of the hall, wearing his old, tan coat.
Western Union basically monopolised the telegram industry in the second half of the 19th century. Here's a cute visual that I can't find a proper date for: https://ids.si.edu/ids/deliveryService?id=NMAH-AC0205-0000133
Cas releases him with a soft pop. Dean’s cock twitches; bounces obscenely against Cas’ pink mouth for a second.
He’s staring now, from his position in between Dean’s thighs, irises just thin rings of blue around wide, dark pupils, and his mouth half-open as if he’s forgotten how to close it. Dean’s hard, his dick already drooling against his belly, and every time Cas works a hand around it or licks long and messily along the shaft, he feels the muscles in his thighs twitch with barely controlled desire.
Cas doesn’t do it gracefully, obviously. He crawls up Dean’s body and flops against his chest, so that his own hard cock bounces against Dean’s thigh and makes him gasp out a surprised laugh, and then he takes Dean’s face between both his hands and kisses him deep and messy and wet, licking into his mouth so that Dean can taste the salt of his own precome.
She breaks off for a moment. Castiel accidentally makes eye contact with a large faux-marble (possibly real marble? He doesn’t know) bust of George Washington on the other side of the library, and feels deeply uncomfortable about it.
‘Does that make a difference?’ Naomi says. Castiel turns to look at her, but she’s addressing the contract lawyer, Crowley, who is watching this debate with no small amount of satisfaction. He clears his throat.
He is, indeed, somewhat bow-legged, but they’re as long and well-muscled as the rest of him. Castiel looks away.
Dean moves an inch closer, two inches, close enough that Cas might feel the warmth of his breath against the nape of his neck, although Dean’s lips are barely moving.
Maybe it’s stupid, but the fear comes back. He forgets how to speak again. He turns around, and Castiel is standing too close, the same intense, unblinking stare as yesterday that makes Dean want to push him away, grit out, ‘
She doesn’t really nod, just raises her chin once and lets it fall again. ‘I’m aware. I’m actually here to see you.’
‘That’s not-’ says Castiel. ‘It’s not - of course I’m not going to, to keep him, I just-’ There’s a burnt sort of smell in the air, something increasingly aggressive, and he can’t tell whether it’s coming off Michael or himself. ‘I don’t appreciate being threatened.’
‘Sorry,’ says Dean, under his breath. ‘I tried to get you a proper drink, but I think it’s just ginger beer or some sh- something.’
He wonders how many kids she has. The omega thing starts to make more sense as she talks: she’s like, whatever, like maybe how he imagines a mom to be. He folds an entire fried egg into his mouth. ‘I don’t know why he brought me here.’
The church, a short distance away, is really the important part - the house is on the church’s land, rather than the other way around - but perhaps the omega hasn’t noticed that yet, or doesn’t realise its significance. Castiel can introduce him to it, give him a tour, maybe. Teach him everything.
When Cas finally wanders off into the living room to retrieve Bobby’s toasting fork, Sam edges closer.
When Dean wanders over, sweat sticking his shirt to the small of his back, smelling sweet and spicy and enticing and faintly grumpy, Castiel does not try to prevent him from looking through the pile of books. There is little point. Dean takes the topmost one over to the armchair to flip through, but he only reads for a couple of minutes before he returns it; he takes a second, and does the same. Eventually he stands behind Castiel, so close Castiel can imagine the heat of skin against skin, so close the thin cotton barrier of their shirts is more a tease than an obstruction, and leans over his shoulder to study the book Castiel is currently reading.
It’s the same face, though. It’s the face they showed him, sometimes, during the hours he spent in that dark room; sliding the glass plate into the projector alongside all of the grotesquely graphic others as if they were all one and the same. A leather bit clenched between his teeth, the mechanical whir and rattle of the machinery, his own heartbeat hot and fast in his ears - the flicker of light as the images changed, changed again, changed back. The white hot pain that coursed through him, that burned him empty, from the inside out. It’s the same face as that.
Very firmly, but very gently, Cas pulls Dean towards him, as if it’s very important that Dean is safe from whatever threat a little brunette omega woman might pose in his backyard, before they get any further into it. He turns back to Lisa.
The list of chores is… a lot. Dean’s pretty sure he’s going to fail miserably at it as soon as the whole explanation opens with waking up at six am - very, very much not going to happen without the Refuge’s bitch of a Matron crawling up his ass over it every morning - drawing up the fire, opening up all the shutters and curtains in the house, shaking out the hearth rugs, cleaning the parlour grate, sweeping the carpet and floors, collecting and sifting the cinders from the previous day, dusting the breakfast room-
Dean’s up with the dawn, pulling on his clothes - he usually wears work clothes now, blue denim work pants same as farmers and ranchers tend to wear, and shabby flannel trade shirts like Bobby’s. He’d been worried at first that Cas would struggle to adapt to the difference in lifestyle, but although Cas still dresses respectably in the more common style of suit, he’s pretty sure the alpha’s got sort of a thing for Dean all dirtied-up and low-class looking, based on the way Cas’ hands tend to wander into the back pockets of Dean’s pants (Dean calls them jeans. Cas insists on calling them ‘waist overalls’, because that’s what they were called fifteen years ago and Cas is a weird guy). They’ve not exactly got a lot of money at the moment anyway, not with Cas still looking for work, so their options are limited - and yeah, the work thing is a whole other discussion, and one Dean doesn’t have an answer for. Bobby doesn’t trade in horses as much as he used to, but Dean’s helped him out here and there enough to cover their basic expenses; and he
The term 'gunslinger' is used historically for the Old West, but that term only originated in the 1920s - at the time they'd have been more commonly called 'gunmen'. I have only watched one (1) Western in my life (okay, yes, it was Tombstone) so Wikipedia is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here.
‘It still isn’t proper,’ his mother says. ‘I’m glad to see you with a hobby, Castiel, but you must know you’re on thin ice.’
It’s such an odd question that Dean pauses in the middle of tipping bacon onto a plate, the skillet hanging in mid-air. ‘Like what?’
There’s a very slight sound of movement as they head into the kitchen, and the pantry door bounces slightly. From behind the little group, Castiel says, ‘Lisa, you - you can come out.’
He is moving away from the entrance hall, towards a small passage that Castiel is aware leads to the billiards room, although he has never spent much time there. There is a small washroom opposite, the sort with its own water closet. Perhaps that had been Dean’s destination.
The guy, the doctor, opens the bag. There’s something silver and metallic inside it that makes Dean’s whole body cringe instinctively.
Dean opened his mind up over his bond to Castiel, trying to send images of what he was seeing back to him. He knew that Castiel got the message when he sensed his alarm. Dean smirked, widening his stance and getting ready to fight. He kept the link between him and his angel open. He wanted Castiel to witness this.
“I guess I hadn’t really thought about it that way,” Dean said. “I just know what it’s like not knowing when your next meal is going to come from. What it’s like going to school without the books you need because you can’t afford them. Spending time having to darn your socks because you can’t afford to replace them when they get holes in them.”
Before Dean knew it two hours had passed, Bobby pointing out the time on the computer clock. Dean excused himself to his room, taking out his phone and sending Sam a text message to check if things were safe. Sam texted back almost instantly that they were, Dean calling his brother.
“I’m fine,” Dean said. “They caught the guy. Cas and I tricked him into going next door where a couple of cops were.”
Sensing movement Dean looked up as another customer entered. He frowned as he noted something was off about her, the way she walked full of hesitation. Her head was down and her red hair was wet around her face, Dean noting the wear on her clothing. He glanced at Kali and saw her expression darken as she saw her, Dean wondering if perhaps this was a homeless person.
“Not by intention,” Benny said. “When so many people pass through here you tend to hear a lot of things.”
Eventually Dean had to come up for air, pulling back from the kiss with some reluctance. He was pleased to see that Castiel was slightly flushed, his hair a little dishevelled. Dean blinked, becoming aware of their surroundings and why they were here.
“Because he’s the favourite son,” Benny said. “Probably why she went to him. He’s naïve and sheltered. I’m sure he got burned. He doesn’t help her anymore.”
“Took you longer than I thought it would,” Crowley admitted. He sipped from his drink. “As a matter of fact I have something that could do with your… expertise.”
“Took care of a vamp nest,” Dean said, frowning as he saw something catch in the light. “Was easy enough. They were fairly new I think.”
Dean opened the bottle and tilted Castiel’s head back. He held the bottle against Castiel’s lips. Castiel tried to resist it but could feel the grace rising toward him like metal to a magnet. He inhaled, the grace seeping in through him. He instantly felt his body begin to warm, the power coursing through him as he took it in. He tested his bonds again and found that they were still too strong for him, a move that Dean didn’t miss.
“Kind of get it,” Dean said. “I’d rebuild Baby’s engine if I had to. I’d rebuild the whole damned car if I had too.”
“Yeap.” Bobby shrugged. “He used to do odd jobs around town until he saved up enough money to put a deposit down on this place. Was a mess back then. He restored it all himself.”
“Not a spell, no,” Crowley said, feeling his frustration simmering beneath his veins. “A potion. Never fails.”
Bobby nodded. “Sounds like Castiel is doing it the right way. I’m sure his brothers and sisters just love that.”
He made his way to the Impala and opened the door, cringing again as it squeaked. He really needed to see about getting the door oiled. He kind of liked the squeak though but at times like this it was a problem. Getting into the driver’s seat he closed the door and again winced at the sound. He knew that wasn’t going to be the worst of it though. The worst thing was what came next.
The night before he’d gotten an email from Sam reassuring him that he was okay. Apparently John hadn’t confiscated his phone but they had one hell of a fight. Sam had told Dean that John hadn’t laid a finger on him though, which Dean was thankful for. In the end John had stormed out and hadn’t come back by the time Sam had emailed Dean. Sam had told him to contact him on the following Saturday as per usual. Nothing about their arrangement was going to change.
“Hm.” Dean studied Castiel, no doubt trying to gauge how much grace he had. “It’s starting to get dark around the edges again. You’re burning out again.”
“Could always find out,” Dean purred. “Just let me go, Sammy. I’ll leave you alone. Let me get on with my life.”
“Just keep doing what you’re doing,” Bobby said. “That’s the best thing you can do for your brother right now. Didn’t you say your dad’s working long hours?”
“Normally I would,” she said. “Especially after we were open Saturday, but there’s not really any point today. The police still have our money in evidence.”
“Yeah, you can smell it,” Dean said. “You didn’t know I was an omega so you never really paid attention, did you. But I’ve smelt you for a while now. I’ve known for a while. Just never thought you’d be interested, being an angel.”
He knew that his being an omega played a huge role in setting the alphas against him. Most alphas had a natural tendency to look down on omegas. When Dean had hit puberty John had taken Dean aside and explained how things worked, and then had started to train Dean in how to successfully beat an alpha down if one came onto him without invitation. Dean still used that training to this day.
“But don’t you have plenty of experience?” Dean asked. “You’d be able to watch the store on your own, wouldn’t you?”
“I know, right?” Dean relaxed into his bed. “It was stuff Dad taught me though so it wasn’t too hard.”
“It will make it hard to hunt if you don’t,” Crowley said. “Speaking of hunting, I have an errand I would like you to run.”
She walked him through the process of starting the machines up and getting them ready to serve. Dean paid close attention, taking in every detail. Kali pointed to a cheat note just to the right of the machines should he ever need it. She then had him repeat back everything she had taught him to make sure he had been listening.
Dean was thrilled to discover that they had a sample platter that you could buy. He handed over the money and they took it out to a small area outside the bakery that was reserved for diners. He set the tray down on the tabletop and rubbed his hands together, trying to work out which pie to try first. He decided on the cherry, picking up the slice and biting into it.
“Yeap,” Bobby said. “And I’ve got to take the whole engine apart to work out what I can salvage and what needs replacing.”
He took the point. He stopped in the middle of the warehouse and dropped his bag. He pulled out the supplies and began to paint a demon summoning circle onto the floor. Hannah stood back and watched him as he prepared the spell, not offering to help him. Sam hadn’t expected her to though. He finished the preparations, looking up at her.
“Every lie starts with a kernel of truth,” Castiel confirmed. “But no, things were not as she made out. She has exaggerated them.”
“On the job training provided,” Dean said. “Told you that food service certificate would come in handy.”
Dean had stuck with his work, finding that he was getting faster at serving the drinks. He was getting less complaints now about his speed, and he was actually starting to find it second nature to make some of the beverages. He was able to actually smile and exchange words with the customers without worrying about making mistakes, although he didn’t allow himself to get too complacent.
Dean didn’t answer but the look on his face was answer enough. Rage burned inside Crowley as he stared at him.
“No sir,” the demon answered, shaking his head. “He sent word and said he’d be back in the morning.”
“Animal,” Dean chuckled as Castiel started pounding into him. “That’s it, Cas. Harder. Make me feel it.”
“Drive carefully tonight,” Kali said. “The roads are going to be slippery and you just know the idiots will be taking advantage.”
“I am,” Dean said. “It was always a line Dad never crossed. He’d get mad but he’d never touch him. He’d take it out of everything else instead.”
Dean sighed. He knew that Castiel was right but that still didn’t change things. It was his fault that things had happened the way they had. He was just lucky that they had convinced Jack to bring Castiel back. Boy Dean missed that kid. He still dropped in from time-to-time but it wasn’t the same. And then Castiel had told Jack to remove his grace so he could grow old with Dean. Yeap, Dean definitely blamed himself for that one.
They headed inside, Dean bidding Bobby goodnight and heading for bed. As he climbed between the sheets he silently thanked his family for only being small. He knew his childhood wasn’t ideal, but it sounded mild next to that of the Shurley family. As Dean curled up in bed he dreamed of pie, cars and blue, blue eyes.
“You mean people asking about what happened?” Kali said. “It’s probably going to be like it all week.”
“Nothing wrong with that,” Dean said. So it was confirmed that Castiel was a virgin then. That intrigued Dean considering how hot Castiel was. “You’re just waiting for the right person.”
“Yes,” Castiel said as he began to warm up the machines. “But I expect these weeks so I have them scheduled ahead of time.”
“What? No!” Bobby set the paper down, leaning forward. “You did not deserve to have a single finger laid on you, Dean.”
“Yeah, I was thinking that,” Dean said. He filled the kettle and put it on the stove. “I guess I’ll have to owe you.”
“We’ve been over this,” Castiel said as he sat across from Dean. “There are times I do, but there are times I do not.”
“At the same time he can track you,” Crowley reminded him. “He can also sense what you’re feeling. Perhaps even what you’re doing. You turned a simple liability into a fucking train wreck.”
“Going to do it personally,” Gabriel said, picking up an apron and tossing it over to Dean. “Suit up and come around this side.”
“All you’d get is boredom,” Castiel said. “And the fact I believe you should terminate your pregnancy.”
He headed for the office of the motel, quickly getting them a room. Key in hand he headed back outside to where Castiel was waiting and led him along the row of doors until he reached theirs. Opening the door he led the way inside, spotting Castiel’s hesitancy. He watched him as he waited for Castiel’s reaction to there only being one bed.
“Nope,” Dean said, shaking his head. “We were his soldiers and he was our drill instructor. I think I’ve been hugged more times by Kali than by my father ever.”
He opened up the door to the coffee shop first before bidding them farewell and wandering next door. Kali lead the way inside and switched on the lights, Dean frowning at the cold air in the store. He knew it wouldn’t be long before it began to warm up but there was definitely a chill in the air first thing in the morning.
Castiel stared down at him, his eyes drifting down to Dean’s abdomen. He reached out with one hand and pressed it against Dean’s stomach. After a moment his eyes widened more than Dean thought possible. “Dean…”
“Now you’re sounding like Crowley,” Dean said. “If I restore your grace I don’t have to keep killing angels to keep you alive.”
“Dad and Sam and heading for Chicago next week,” Dean told Bobby as he wandered over toward him and dropped onto the nearby couch. “Some warehouse job.”
“You’ve been outcast,” Castiel said. He paused for a moment. “I can see why you gravitated toward Anna.”
“Okay. I get it,” Sam said coldly. “You don’t care about your brother. You’re just going to leave him to die. Well I can’t do that. I’m going to save them. I’m going to save them both.”
The doctor nodded. “I’m sorry to say that there was nothing we could do for the child. It’s as if his body had suddenly rejected it and was forcing it out. It was lost.”
Dean looked up as he felt eyes on him, noting that Benny was looking their way. He watched as Benny came around from behind the counter and sauntered over to them. There was a quiet confidence in the way he walked – a slight swagger in his step. He grinned at Bobby as he made it to their table.
“Criminals aren’t rational,” Sam said. “He’s going to blame you for getting him arrested. What if he tracks you down?”
“What are you intending on doing with him once you find his grace?” Crowley asked. “Have you at least thought that through?”
The tone of his voice was enough to tell Dean his answer. Dean’s heart skipped a beat, a thrill running up his spine as his legs felt like jelly. Dean swallowed himself, feeling heat begin to flush across his face.
She beckoned him over, pulling a book out from under the counter and flipping to the pages in question. She handed the book to Dean to read, Dean taking in the recipe and finding that it was indeed pretty basic. It was really a matter of making sure to add the right amount of the correct syrup to the coffee, with a dollop of cream on top with a shake of chocolate dusting or sprinkles depending on which drink.
“That can be arranged,” Castiel said, his hand slowly tracing circles around the small of Dean’s back.
Crowley took several long steps back from him as Castiel breathed in the grace. He closed his eyes, feeling the power seep into him. There was a bright flash and an eruption of energy radiating out from him. The bed was thrown backward and crashed against the wall, barely missing where Crowley now stood. Castiel straightened, spreading out his broken wings with some relief. They hurt but it felt good to have them back.
He leaned back against the door of the Holy Perk, his hands deep in his jacket pockets to keep them warm. He watched as the traffic drove by. It wasn’t very busy despite being a later time to when he was usually there. There was enough light that the streetlights were off, the sun reflecting off the shop windows almost blindingly.
He had settled in and was about halfway through his sandwich when someone slid into the seat across from him. Dean frowned, glancing up and starting as he recognised her: Anna.
They looked up as the door opened, a doctor stepping into the waiting area. He looked down at them and frowned. “Is one of you Mr Winchester’s alpha?”
“Easier than making coffee,” Gabriel said. “You’ll be wanting people to order hot chocolate it’s so easy."
“No,” Dean said, pushing his own love for Castiel back through the bond. “It’s requited. I just didn’t think you could so I never…”
“He’s an omega,” the alpha said. “And he’s going into heat. We’re wondering what you’re going to do about that.”
At the coffee shop Kali had taught him a few more of the specialty drinks. She was starting with the easiest drinks and slowly building him up toward the harder ones. Dean now knew half of the menu off by heart, relieving some of the pressure on Kali particularly during the school rushes. He still wasn’t allowed to serve food or handle the money but he expected that. He was a barista after all, not a cashier.
He shimmied out of the rest of his clothing, then climbed up to straddle Castiel’s hips. Castiel seemed happy to finally have something to do with his hands as they landed on Dean’s hips. Dean bent down again so they could kiss once more, licking into Castiel’s mouth and staking his claim. Castiel’s hands began their own exploration, trailing over skin so lightly that it almost tickled.
