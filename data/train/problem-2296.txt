As Sherlock lies down on his large bed, John looks at him and is lost in in what he sees. His long, muscled arms and legs, the fair skin that seems to reflect the dim light. His hair, chaotic and curly from drying without being combed. Sherlock’s stomach is flat and a thin line of brown-ginger hair trails down from his navel to his pubic hair. His cock is erect and has quite a stunning effect on John. He has seen a number of cocks, sometimes that’s part of being a doctor. He has seen a fair share during his army times, in the showers. Once, after a night of shared drinks in the camp, even one like this, erect, flushed. He had touched it, curious and with lust, had taken him in his mouth and had given his first and, so far, only blow job. It was some kind of a one-night stand, he hadn’t dated the man in any way.
