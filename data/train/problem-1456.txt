"No. Don't. Don't leave me. I can't- I can't do this alone. I- I love you."
“For acting all weird, and being an asshole, I’m sorry”
John was just outside Lestrade’s office, talking to Melissa.
“John?”, Sherlock asked.
"No."
John sat up to start unbuttoning his shirt, but when he did so, the fabric of his shirt hurt Sherlock's bruised arm, who couldn't help but flinch a little at the movement. "Ouch", he whispered.
John came back. He had not left. A rush of relief sped through his whole body. He listened to the ruffle of skin against ground, when had John ended up barefoot? He felt as John wiped him, the softest of touches, and he was speechless at the deep and intense feeling of John’s care.
-----------------------
"Stop asking questions!" Sherlock said lifting his hand. " I don't want to answer them!"
"I know what happened yesterday!" He said in a louder tone than he intended to. "I just... Look, I want to be a doctor, Sherlock. I want to do this, and I know it's not going to be easy, but I want to try, because I'm going to see bodies for the rest of my life."
Sherlock snorted. "Thank you? For what?"
Just as he was parking the car and turning it off, he heard a voice behind him. "Well, well, well, look who got home from school."
76 hours had passed by the time they had finished interrogating Jones and John still hadn't texted Sherlock, which was fine, perfectly fine, he needed time, that was it. He was
"Oh really? And how do you think you are going to teach me about it?"
John walked out and closed the door behind him.
"He isn't."
He finally turned to look at him, his arms were crossed.
"Goodbye,
Sherlock shifted in his seat slightly and winced. He felt the breath leaving his lungs.
It took less effort to John in order to find his voice. He looked down and then looked up to Sherlock, and started breathing hard before asking, "who are you?"
Sherlock couldn't breathe.
"Sure." Sherlock said and actually left with them and John was trying to process his thoughts, his pain (both physically and emotionally) and his anger, because right now, it was the strongest feeling. Not towards Jim, not towards Sebastian, not even towards Sherlock but towards him, for being so incredibly stupid.
Sherlock looked at him with wonder, he couldn’t help not to.
He stared at the piece of paper and carefully put it back on the table, he smiled when he saw John's scribbles on the paper, they reminded him of so many adventures, so many cases, so many moments by John's side.
"Look, I don't know what the hell happened between you and John, but whatever is going on now with you and Irene, it just...doesn't look real. How do you think he feels about it?"
“Panic attack”, John said.
"It's not simple! Whatever it is, it's
As they sat, John covered his face with his hands and let out a sigh.
"...because you do that very often or...?"
“I like his paintings, not the meaning behind them. I like the way he uses proportion and perspective.”
John shook his head and looked down, trying to swallow the knot on his throat, because this was too much. "Nothing. I'm fine."
Sherlock retreated immediately and stared at him wide-eyed. "You're bleeding." He said and ran towards the bath, he came back with a wet flannel with which he cleaned John's lip.
Sherlock frowned.
embarrassed. Sherlock looked serious and said, "of course I will, Mrs. Watson, don't worry."
"So, I thought I should warn you."
Sherlock saw the boy passing by and sighed loudly as the rest of the gang turned their faces to look at John. Jim looked at the greaser with a smile. "So...John Watson. Nice choice of someone to annoy!"
"That's what he did."
“We’ll find a way, I know we will-”
"Good luck with the boy." She said with a wink. Sherlock didn't look up and took an even bigger sip.
Lestrade had given him this case a couple of days after he’d arrived, to give him something to occupy himself with. He’d given an ordinary case that had ended up hitting extraordinarily close to home. But there might have been others before. Others that went unconnected, unsolved, that were discarded, thrown away and…
“Why did you come at three in the morning?”, Sherlock asked.
"Yes you're fine", he honestly had no reasons to doubt in her and had to admit that he actually kind of liked her. "I just know that it'll be easier for you to cooperate than for the rest of the staff."
They had breakfast in silence and then he and Harry rode to school. As soon as they got inside the car, Harry excitedly bent to turn on the radio and she put
"Unconscious when checked in. Eventually better. Managed to surpass the withdrawal. Thanks to your help."
John kissed him more eagerly, and started moving his finger in and out. A moment later he tucked in another and Sherlock moaned at the combination of pain and pleasure, perhaps more pain than pleasure at the moment, but it didn't matter. "Shh", John whispered against his ear, "it's okay, I got you love."
“Did you just listen to me?”
Sherlock frowned, “it’s three in the morning”, he said.
kinds of colors, that would be impossible, but there were all kinds of mixtures and tones and hues and John felt something deep deep inside that he could only explain by his physical reaction: heart racing, pupils dilating, a slight weakness on his knees, was he going to faint? Of course not, no.
Sherlock looked up and found John staring. He threw a desperate glance at him but the boy merely shrugged. The greaser sighed and went to the dining room, John went downstairs and followed him.
----------------------------
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes. Honestly now even Lestrade's hunches seemed to make sense to him. That was how lost he felt with this case. All he wanted to do was go back to Scotland Yard and look at John's folder, see what else it said, if it could solve another piece of the mystery. And he didn't mean this case.
“I work better when you talk to me.”
It was the only solution.
Irene smiled. "Great. Let's have dinner."
He was dying to, though.
John raised an eyebrow amusingly. Apparently he was lavishing on Sherlock's confusion at John's apartment.
A known actress, Isabella Dorman, had been found dead on her hotel bedroom last night. Security footage showed how she had arrived alone to her own room and so they didn’t have many suspects.
The painting Sherlock saw when he was a kid is An Experiment on A Bird in the Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby. The painting does make part of the National Gallery in London!
Irene was there too. They haven't talked to one another since their 'break-up', but she seemed to be fine with him. Sometimes he would catch her sight and she would wink an eye to him while Greg eyed them suspiciously.
Sherlock placed a chaste kiss on John's cheek. "Have fun with yours."
"No, no, it's okay, really. I'll go and take these ones to the locker and look for the classroom so I don't get late!"
greaser
The door opened half an inch. "Yes?"
So this idea popped into my mind as I watched The Manchurian Candidate, a 1962 film with Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh. The movie basically is about a man who is captured during the Corean War and whose mind is controlled in order to become an assassin.
Sherlock’s hands caressed John’s arms, and then touched his chest, stopping over his heart, feeling the rapid heartbeats, marveling at the anatomy, the composition and the structure of John’s body. John’s perfect body.
Sherlock laughed too, “that’s- a surprisingly fair point.”
He used to think that fame and money and girls -and boys- was all he needed to reach happiness, and at first, he thought he felt happy. But after all of that was gone he realized he was never happy, not for a single moment, he hadn’t been happy since the very moment his painting was unveiled at the Tate Gallery.
"What the hell was all that about?" John looked at Harry very seriously, in a worried way, as if he was scared of what his sister might have told Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes.”
He broke their kiss and stared at Sherlock’s neck fixedly. There was a point right where his neck and his torso met and he felt the desperate need to touch it. He caressed it as Sherlock could do nothing but stare into John’s lust-filled eyes.
Sherlock let it all out until he felt empty, devoid of pain. Well, that was a lie, but there was a slight relief in his heart, in his mind, in his soul.
"Nothing..."
greaser
John didn't feel offended, he actually found it slightly funny. A small smile drew on his face but he shook it away. "Fine, fine, we'll do it about the history of chemistry, what do you say? It's not that long, and it's a topic we like..."
Lestrade shook his head with a small smile as he closed the door behind him. "Feeling better, I take it?"
"Aren't you going to see the message?"
John frowned and stared at Sherlock, “what?”
"That's precisely what I want. All of you. All. Of. You", he said, for emphasis.
John smiled. "Good. Yeah. Lots of work at the hospital, but in general it was a good week." John said, avoiding the night he got so drunk he couldn't even remember it and the crazy encounter he had earlier.
"Shhhh. Don't blow this again!"
"John, it's just five! Come on, I'm having a lot of fun!". He wondered how could she be having fun, if he was such a lousy company.
John bit his lip. "Perhaps he won't remember, he was still... high", he said, sighing. Harry was in the backseat, looking completely knackered. She had her eyes open, but it was as if she wasn't there at all.
"I hate you." John said, his voice sharp, without any hesitation.
"I suppose you're right. It was never going to end well."
"What are you not telling me?" Sherlock said seriously.
“Don’t fail”, Sherlock replied. “So I won’t have to see you failing.”
“Yes. About violence in art. How could he ask me that? How could he?”, John said, feeling his anger rising.
Without looking at Anthea, he just said: "Bring me the photos we have from Irene's murder"
Sherlock smiled. "Good, good. I'm glad. Well, have a good night, then."
Mycroft stood silent and lifted his eyebrow at his brother, looking at him defiantly. Sherlock realized and widened his eyes, which were looking kind of lost, since the greaser was still very drunk. "Oh. Of course! You knew where I was!"
And there hadn't been a single second in which John Watson hadn't crossed his mind.
"I'm not giving up on anything!"
But John didn't leave and John didn't understand what he was saying.
And then again, Irene had a point. Why was she so right in everything today? What if people realized he had fallen for someone? What if they realized that
He squinted to the sunlight filtering. He felt the start of a headache forming itself, and he turned to ask -yell at- Mycroft to close the curtains.
Sherlock scoffed. “There’s no such things as coincidences. The universe is rarely so lazy. Melissa, please, I thought you were smarter than that”.
, and now you're telling me that it's all fake and that she is back and ready to tear down the government? Are you aware of the accusation you are making and how serious it is?"
But he had to break apart.
"Indeed."
"God, I'm so tired John! Where can I sleep tonight?"-Harry said looking at him suspiciously and with a smile.
John thought, snorting.
Sherlock turned to look at John. "What is so absurd about coffee?"
? You've heard him talk, Harry, he never talks about anything too emotional nor too personal, You know he doesn't work that way. It was wonderful. It was the biggest expression of affect, caring and selfless interest he could ever be capable of, and it was directed towards me. God, I'm lucky, I'm lucky to be missed by Sherlock Holmes." He smiled while Harry just looked at him in some hidden disbelief, so he cleared his throat and slightly changed the subject. "Now you answer my question, Harry!"
“I’m sorry”, Sherlock said after a moment. “This wasn’t how I expected it to be. I wanted to solve the case and see that smile that draws in your face when you see the solution. I wanted to see that small spark in your eyes when you faced danger. I wanted you to be happy once again.”
“I’m really not.”
“I met with Mike”, John said lowly as they laid in the couch. Sherlock’s head was on top of John’s, and somehow not having to look at his eyes made it all much easier.
"Why what?"
"Nothing. Just talk to you, that's all." She said pulling a small smile.
"Well, yes. That's what I just told you."
They were able to talk to some of the workers at the fair, who mentioned they hadn’t received more threats since they had visited. John was relieved but for Sherlock there was something clearly suspicious in that, as if those threats were messages, or calls, or advices or spoilers?
Melissa shrugged. “One of the advantages of understanding how brainwashing works”, she said with a smile.
---------------------
After 87 hours, a text from John.
"Please Harry, don't ask anything else, don't. Just please, let me stay here, please."
Sherlock's eyes widened, suddenly needing the stimulation a case would bring to his brain. He considered it for a moment, but he shook his head slightly, letting Greg know he wasn't joining him.
"What if I don't want to get over him?"
... Look, like it or not, we have to work together and there's nothing I can do about it. So we better do it right."
John stood up, breathing hard. "I would have gone with you".
Sherlock frowned and John tossed the paper at him. He glanced at it. He remembered the photograph, it had been taken when they were leaving for Moriarty's trial. He sighed for a moment and looked up, John had his eyes fixed on him.
"Oh! Wait for me!" Sherlock said running to catch John.
Sherlock really had to resist the temptation to roll his eyes. He should have gone out with Lestrade. He tried to come up with an excuse but his mind was dozing off. Well, that was a first.
to paint?”, he asked curiously.
”, Sherlock said, a bit sharply.
"Is it hurting?", Sherlock asked, feeling a bit calm now that he wasn't looking down anymore.
“I used to think it was. But it wasn’t. Sherlock I got so bored of my own life that I took that radical decision. I romanticize it now but back then, I was about to lose my mind. I never asked for that kind of life”.
Irene smiled. "I thought that so."
"I'm sorry, what is so obvious?" John said looking at her with a confused gaze.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "I assure you it is."
He wished Sherlock could know.
"It isn't fair, but it is what it is. I deserved it. After all I put you through."
Sherlock didn't reply for a while. Then he turned towards John. "Nothing. We are nothing at all." And he left walking.
"Watson, for you." John said firmly. His voice sounded harsh.
"Then why coming to me?"
Sherlock stormed into his room and shut the door, he definitely needed some time alone to think. How couldn't have he noticed the fact that her phone was no longer in his room? Had he really forgotten about her? Just like that? Well, that message proved that he still felt something towards her, he didn't know whether it was pain, or anger, or... Of course not, not that.
Mrs Hudson kept smiling widely. John returned the smile and said "Well, we have a project to do, so..."
"Yeah", John replied, before throwing him another of his long smiles. "You have got to stop", he told Sherlock.
"Oh Johnny boy, you're so desperate it's pathetic." Jim said leaning close to his ear. "You're dying to be a greaser, aren't you?"
Sherlock closed his eyes and retrieved to his Mind Palace, ignoring his racing heart and his ragged breathing. Melissa had said something when they first met, something about- something about the patients getting headaches when they were bombarded with the memories that had been erased.
"But it was- it was everything I could have possibly ever wanted."
“I used to write about- you?”
As he entered to the house, Mycroft stood by the car's door, looking at John questioningly. "What?" John asked.
"I'm sorry sir, he didn't announce himself."
But John Watson wasn’t ordinary, he’d never be.
" He said confused.
“Yes, I know.”
Sherlock stared at it for a long time. He looked at it fixedly.
They couldn't get upstairs fast enough, as soon as they did, their bodies sought one another unconsciously. John kicked the door to close it and focused all his attention on Sherlock. "You are brilliant", he whispered as he kissed Sherlock's jaw. "The way you examined the scene, the way you talked, the way you ran, God, I wanted to take you then and there."
"I don't like
The detective stood up and threw a hand dismissively. "I don't want it."
should.
John smiled back because he didn't know what else to say, he was just so happy and thankful that Sherlock was right next to him, and supporting him and understanding him and it was good. It was better than good, it was great.
"I'm very damn sure, John, I haven't drunk that much today."
"You and I know I'm not just your 'work partner' as you so classily call it"
Sherlock stood still, not moving from the door. He cleared his throat. “It’s still a work in progress”, he said hesitantly and he sounded nervous? Anxious? Scared? Something in between?
"Who?" Sebastian said looking up.
"So. The woman, she is back. How are we feeling about that?"
John smiled, breaking the kiss. "Have fun at the case."
"I'm sure this is a conversation you don't want to have, dear brother."
The last time he had felt anticipation, however, John hadn’t recognized him, so he didn’t hold onto that
John sighed, and looking at the rest of the class, closed the door and left.
Mycroft stood there looking calmed as John moved away and
"Listen to me." John said loudly. Sherlock turned back again.
This was grim and boring and dull and he was getting tired of it and he didn’t know how to make it better, how to make it brighter, how to make it more colorful.
"History." Sherlock said without hesitation.
He shook the thought away and stared at Sherlock.
Sherlock bit his lip. “Paint something about the war, then.”
And he slept. They both did.
Sherlock didn't know what to say, why did he? He didn't have the answer, he had no idea, he certainly hated not knowing. "Why did John, amongst all people, chose to call you?"
The response was almost immediately.
John didn't answer. He seemed absorbed in a different world.
"I'd rather have this conversation in private, dear brother."
But he didn't know if he was entitled to anymore.
Sherlock stood still, considering what Lestrade had said, but unable to mutter a word.
"Nice!"
John nodded. “Panic attacks are not an easy thing to handle”, he replied seriously before walking away.
He missed the way he used to reach with his fingertips and feel the brushstrokes as he smiled at his own artworks. He missed the way he used to take the paint in his hands and mix it with a completely different color and get something beautiful and intense. He missed the smell of the oil. He liked the way the oil merged with the canvas.
that.
"Of course." Sherlock said with a smile.
"What?", Lestrade said with a frown.
"We're not talking about that."
Sherlock placed one of his warm hands in John's face, and John leaned in it. "It's your life, John. They can't just tell you what to do with it. It's
The rest of the path was silent. He didn't feel like talking, anyway.
Sherlock swallowed hard. He couldn't move. He
He ran towards Sherlock, the pain in his shoulder (psychosomatic, he knew) completely forgotten out of his instinct to heal and to take care of those who had been hurt.
"The new girl! Look at that!"
Harry opened her eyes widely. "Shit. Did I?"
Of course, the medical opinion would beg to differ. The medical opinion would say that his body is suffering the morphine withdrawal, not the John Watson withdrawal.
And yet, Sherlock couldn’t regret any of it.
Sherlock remained still and silent, as if he hadn't heard any of the words she'd said.
Still, he couldn’t help to be surprised to find John in his flat once again, without previous notice, no text messages, nothing. He stood up in a rush. “John”, he said.
There was a knock on the bathroom door and Sherlock felt startled. "Sherlock?"
John looked at the picture closely, with a smile. “Well, it’s unfinished.”
John was looking at him fixedly.
He phoned Mycroft, "hello big brother, how are you?"
"I was caught kissing someone in the back of the school."
“Completely.”
Sherlock laughed lowly. "Oh! Your mom is looking for you!" He said with a huge grin on his face.
"Of course! Who doesn't?" He replied with a smile. Sherlock rolled his eyes and walked towards the stairs.
John blushed a little but tried to defend himself. He spoke lowly, very very low. "How can we be a couple if you already are in one?" He certainly didn't want it to sound hurt, because John was convinced Sherlock didn't love Irene at all, but still that was the tone it sounded.
“…the track marks.”
He left John's flat even more confused than when he had rung the bell and entered.
It happened like that. Just that simple. Sherlock already knew that he loved John, that much was obvious, but that he was
"Sherlock-"
Sherlock understood why John had been so dazzled the time he had visited his house: this one was very small and humble, but it was a very pretty house.
"Victor." Was all he managed to say, trying to bring some peace into his brain which felt like it was about to collapse, while keeping a stoic expression on his face.
He moved his hand around, drawing softly and thinking about the way Sherlock’s hands reflected the light, about the parts he would darken, about the dimension. How had he called them? Texture.
But that day, he walked into the Tate Modern. Perhaps in a fit of absolute rage, needing something to focus his anger on, surely criticizing every work of art he saw in there would make him feel better.
The door closed.
Sherlock shrugged. "What about that nerd?"
John sat straight on the chair, he thought for a second before replying, "what do you want us to be?"
He didn't like the look of disappointment in his mother's face. He told himself he was doing it for her and, gathering courage, finally decided it was best going to school. All he had to do was to avoid Sherlock at all costs. Sure, right, incredibly easy, avoiding the most popular boy in the school.
"Shit, they are in his bedroom, TOGETHER!"
The chair which had been empty almost since Sherlock had fallen.
"Hey, we're taking it slow."
He hadn’t forgotten a word. Not a single one. He hadn’t forgotten the dictation the accent the tempo the enunciation. Because that speech had changed his life.
before he settled back on the chair.
But even more important than that memory was the memory of what happened
He tried to push his feelings aside, tried to ignore the constant, nagging sensation of needing to be with John. No. His feelings didn't matter right now. What mattered was to keep John safe.
And Sherlock smiled and John loved that smile.
No. After seeing Sherlock drawing the torso two days ago, he couldn’t say anything bad about it.
Hawthorne closed the door and Melissa turned to look at Sherlock, who was now covering his eyes with his hands and mumbling: "there has to be something, something I'm missing..."
John shook his head, "not terribly. The hardest thing to control was the headache by the overexposure to memories, but it was only temporary. My head's still a bit sore, though."
I want to stop. Take me out of here. Take me out of here, please. Please.
Sherlock felt as if a Big Bang had crashed through inside his body.
Closer indeed.
Of course
"O...okay, so I'll better be off to the club. See you later."
“Look at yourself”, Sherlock said, turning to face John.
It was happening. It was really happening.
“What? Are they dead or…?”
Sherlock relaxed a bit and, while looking serious, his voice tone was not as threatening as it had been. "I'll wait."
“Ever since I remember, I always liked it”, Sherlock replied and then he turned his attention towards his phone.
John laughed a little, still not believing the bunch of crap he had just read. He rubbed his forehead and tossed the paper to her desk violently, feeling angry all of the sudden for being the target of such silly accusations. He didn't know how to react to them, one day he was a normal, boring person and the next day he was a superhero doctor solving crimes with a man he had only seen twice in his life? There was something completely twisted about this, and no matter how hard he tried, John couldn't find any logic in it, starting by that damn photograph he didn't recall having been taken!
It was too much, too heavy. Sherlock wanted to run away.
"Wow wow wow. You took him home?"
He really hoped this would be it, because he was desperate to come back to London.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock didn't want to look down and didn't want to look at John so he opted to look at the sky, at an unusually cloudless sky, with stars. The longer he looked at it, the more stars appeared. He remained silent and while he looked at the sky, his trembling faded.
And he was teaching him? Who did he think he was?
Including John Watson,
Sherlock remained silent. John couldn’t look at his face.
"I'm not your friend." John told Sherlock, as he couldn't say it to Mrs Hudson.
to hold onto. He wished he could just hold the whole universe in his hand, shut it tight and never let it go.
He looked somehow
John took Sherlock's scarf and untied it, throwing it to the ground, followed by his Belstaff.
"...but now my brother is rooting for killing you."
She opened the door of the locker and hid her face behind it. She was trying to avoid him. Sherlock hadn't thought about it, probably John had told her he had been the one on the black Cadillac. He didn't feel anger towards her, he was okay with that, he got over it. It took him a while, but he made peace with it. Plus, she was John's sister. Sherlock couldn't hate her.
Sherlock sighed and stood up, pulling his coat collar up and blinking a few times, trying to go back to his expressionless face.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow inquiringly.
He chose a dark background. He mixed dark brown with small, soft brushstrokes of light brown in order to give some texture and dimension to it, for the skin he chose a subtle tone of pink and mixed it with a bit of bronze, thinking a bit about John’s tanned skin, touched by the sun and the sand and the desert and the pain and the scars and creating an imperfect yet beautiful tone.
-------
history
John looked at him and smiled happily. “Really?”
and looking so incredibly focused, it was a sight he felt he could never get used to, seeing him so absorbed, so lost in his own world...
*******
He stood there, right behind him, biting his tongue to stop himself from doing any harsh comments -but he certainly was thinking them- until John finished and turned to look at him with a smile. “Tada!”, he said as soon as the drawing? -If he called it that- was finished.
There were some unbearable times, when Serbia came crushing back to him, when Moriarty's voice creeped into his mind, when John's unknowing look drew itself in his mind palace, looking far too real, and Sherlock just wanted to run away. In those moments, he would simply scream, he would scream until the tears rolled down from his eyes, until his voice was sore and until the huge effort left him as a trembling mess. And the seconds tickled by in his head. Tick tock. Tick tock.
He felt drowsy and tired, terribly tired. His blood pressure was too low and in the end, would it be too terrible to just leave like this? It was almost peaceful, if only he wouldn't be worrying about his pulse and if only morphine could stop the influx of John in his brain.
"So-", he started as soon as he sat. "-tell me about the case."
"Okay. So, good night, sleep tight. Merry Christmas."
They chatted for a while, John told him that Sherlock was tutoring him on improving his drawing skills (of course, that was all he was going to say on the topic), if Mike noticed anything, he didn’t mention it (thankfully), but as soon as they finished talking about it, Mike simply said, “I’m glad you’re working on getting better, because I want to propose you something.”
Sherlock nodded, not knowing what John quite meant, was it the place on his back that hit the foot of the bed? Were the scars? Was his heart? It didn’t matter, it all hurt, but it didn’t hurt as much as it used to.
Sherlock laughed too. They laughed for a while, feeling a deep sense of relief and of comfort in each other.
He shook the thought away and stood up, still holding John's hand, holding it tightly. They walked towards the bedroom and as soon as the door closed, John put his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissed him.
"...because I don't remember quite well what happened. But it's nothing criminal or anything, so don't worry."
"Painkiller?", Sherlock asked.
“No. You’re not coming.”
And saw them vanish, too.
He had a thousand ideas in his mind, flowing through his brain, flooding his mind palace. He discarded them all. They were a bit not good in different levels of variation. Somehow, Sherlock realized, no matter what he'd say or do, it could
This was all a disaster.
simple!"
"You can't drive?"
"Don't worry, there's pie for you too, sweetie!" Mrs Hudson yelled.
Now it was turn to John's face to drop. He had absolutely no idea. He didn't know anything about his "friend" oh god, he wasn't even his friend! He was someone he barely knew and he hated! He reminded himself. "...no, Molly. Sorry. I don't know."
"No. She is in love." -John said, sighing.
Mycroft, or course, realised of that. He narrowed his eyes as he stared at the mask, a smirk drawing in his face. He stared at Sherlock for a while. "What do you think I'm doing here? Assisting my addicted brother as I have done many times before."
Sherlock cupped John's face with his hands. John was still looking down, panting. "John, look at me, look at me now." The boy lifted his face and looked at the greaser's beautiful gray/blue/green eyes, which were wide opened and completely focused on his. " You are amazing." John shook his head. "And you are alive. And you are okay and I can't tell you how relieved I felt when I saw your face as I got out of the car. And I think you're better than you think you are. You can go now, if you want." Sherlock said taking his hands off him and turning towards the stairs.
“See, the problem is that, no matter how hard I try, I think I won’t ever achieve what I achieved before Afghanistan. I’ll never be the same artist, I’ll never have the same talent, the same spirit. It terrifies me that I might not be who I used to be.”
started playing. And things got better. Although he despised lots of things, Rock n' Roll wasn't one of them.
"No. I don't think that me not being with him would depress him. I think that having an alcoholic sister, parents who only care about his grades, an abusive father and an unhappy mother would." As soon as he closed his mouth he realized he had crossed the line.
Sherlock couldn't do anything but hold onto John's shirt and pull him towards him. He wasn't quite sure about what was a dream and what was a reality. John allowed himself to be pulled. Sherlock placed his face on the crook of John's neck, breathing him in as he felt himself calming down.
What the hell was wrong with him? He had to stop this. These thoughts weren’t doing him any good, he’d lose his concentration and he’d make a fool out of himself in front of Sherlock.
John opened his eyes as soon as he heard her. Then he closed them down again, trying to swallow the knot on his throat. "Mmm... Yes."
“That’s- that’s good. I’m glad you- stopped.”
He climbed up the steps, slowly, silently, remembering exactly which was the way. The power station hadn’t changed at all: it was as messy and abandoned as it had been almost three years ago.
He opened it and couldn't hide the look of surprise on his face. "Greg!" He said with a smile.
"I've tried, Harry. But he won't talk to me. And that is fine too, I understand it. He wants to stay as far as possible. But that we're no longer... John and Sherlock doesn't mean that I don't care about him anymore."
He couldn’t picture a life without John Watson in it.
So he convinced himself he was going to talk to Sherlock after the lunch and tell him that even though he had lots of fun with him, they could no longer be friends, or whatever they were, and that would certainly be it.
Sherlock looked at him and simply said, "SHHH!!!", a second later the greaser turned without entering the car, his body blocking the window so John couldn't see why he had turned, but he sure as hell recognized the voice that yelled at Sherlock.
Harry's smile widened. "You
He decided that John didn't care at all, definitely, he just said it because he thought it might move something inside Sherlock and he would forget everything he did, but that's not how Sherlock's mind worked.
He didn't know where to go from here: the hospital was one thing, but coming back to the place where everything happened, where everything had broken, where everything had been forgotten, might be too much.
"So you told her about what had happened..." John told Sherlock as soon as he entered to the "laboratory", trying not to sound as amused as he was.
"Oh. So you don't remember you passed out at Clara's bathroom." John said nonchalantly.
"I'm busy." He said, still looking at the ceiling.
"I did. I just don't want to reply. I just don't. So I'll shake the erasers instead and shut up and so will you."
face.
"Shit." Clara said leaning down and touching Harry's wrist, checking her pulse. "Harry, love, are you okay?" She said worriedly. No response.
Oh, so many things he wanted to say, but never could. Starting by the fact he actually never told Sherlock he was his best friend. But that was kind of obvious, wasn’t it? No. It wasn’t. Sherlock died alone. Because alone was what he had. That was the last thing he told John before climbing up the rooftop. How could he not know? How could he be unaware of how important he was for John? Of how much he meant to him?
"I'm sorry for your loss." She said lowly.
John broke the smile to stifle a yawn.
I have to admit that for 90% of the time that it took writing this fic I swore that after finishing this I wouldn't ever want anything to do with this au, mostly because it was emotionally extenuating. I wanted this to be the last chapter and be done with this universe.
He arrived to the classroom as soon as Hikes was entering, almost breathlessly, he mumbled a 'good morning' to Hikes and rushed to his seat. John was looking at his notebook, which was closed. He sat behind him and smiled. He was sure he was going to make things right this time. That didn't mean they were actually going to be together again, but Sherlock didn't want to rule the possibility out. He
“I know. They really are.”
He kept walking. Walking over the scar of something that was broken and had never managed to quite heal itself.
John shook his head. No. “No.”
He didn’t want to remember those scarce days when he actually felt happy, happy with his work, happy with the fame, happy with who he was. Someone had said that something that happened just once might as well never have happened at all. Who was it? He couldn’t remember, he had read it somewhere. And John wondered whether he had been really and completely happy or if he just had imagined he was.
He hadn’t felt like this in ages. He hadn’t felt this spur of inspiration, this raw, deep need to simply draw and lose himself amidst the proportions, the muscles and the lights. It had even been longer since he felt like this without the assistance of drugs.
Sherlock blinked too.
"Please..." John looked up. "Take a seat or you won't be able to stand for much long."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Without even thinking about it, he stood up and grabbed John’s hand
And well, that hell of a comeback left Sherlock speechless, he looked down, swallowed and barely mumbled "I hope not."
“Of course we are.”
“I didn’t. It doesn’t matter, it’s not important.”
Greg raised an eyebrow, surprised. Sherlock never accepted help and would play stubborn, but now he seemed too put down to protest.  Finally he turned to the door. "I'll be right back."
Was John even asking that? John would recognise Sherlock everywhere, just by looking at his scarf's colour or at the pattern his curls traced.
"I'm sorry, I'm
He stood in the rug of their -his- living room, simply staring into space.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly not amused. “Really, John? I don’t just
Sherlock couldn't help but laugh, and he found that this was the first time in a very, very long time that he laughed a genuine, humorous laugh, so he allowed himself to enjoy the moment, and he kept laughing. John joined him and they both laughed and laughed for a while. For a second it seemed just like the old times.
"Protecting me from what?"
Melissa frowned too but opened her mouth to speak. “I know this will seem odd, but can I come with you?”, she said, turning to look at Lestrade. “I’d just like to help you with the records. Please?”
Lestrade broke the silence for him. "Go home. Go home and make sure that John is safe."
"Ask your spies to find it out." Sherlock said bluntly.
"Oh boy, stop blocking the stairs!" Someone yelled at him from behind.
Greg nodded, giving the folder to Sherlock.
"Is it funny now? Is it still funny now? How does it feel, after seeing all you've done, how does it feel? Is it still part of your game? Am I part of your magic trick as well? Did you plan this? I bet it all went according to what you had planned, of course I would fall for it, of course I-", John shifted slightly.
"Don't try to get clever with me, Sherlock, you know I have a lot of power. Now, I shall repeat the question just once more, and I demand your answer. Where is she?"
"It's just... I don't know what to do, Irene." Sherlock said more calmly.
"Why not? You used to do that all the time!"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Greg waved at him and left.
He would have chosen Serbia.
They were both broken. Yet somehow they had managed to heal themselves.
And things changed after that moment. They did. And Sherlock allowed himself to hope.
"What?" She froze halfway through putting a wire.
It didn’t make sense, John was supposed to be angry with him, John was supposed to not want to do anything with Sherlock anymore, it was the only logical response to all the things that had happened between them but John was talking to him. He. Was. Willingly. Talking. To. Him.
“I could have never done it without your guidance. You are- you just- you
"Of course the doctor, even you might be thinking that he is our first suspect. He knew every single one of the patients, they allowed him into his house, he knows details about their lives, about the people they decided to erase-", he fell silent. He couldn't avoid the thought of John popping into his mind.
"It isn't fair. Any of this. You. Everything you've gone through. Us. It isn't fair", he said as his tone betrayed the rage he was feeling.
And collapsed against the wall, cracking in laughter. Just like they had done years ago.
"Sherlock. Seriously." John said unamused.
Irene leaned close to him with a smile. "Oh, we are going to be the most beautiful couple of the school."
“Then I’ll definitely go. Thank you for this class”
He sighed and rubbed his eyes. He hadn't slept at all last night, he stood there, looking at the ceiling, then at the windows, then at the clock. He was exhausted and he didn't want to do anything, lest of it all facing Mycroft. He grabbed a pillow nearby and tossed it towards the door.
John turned to look at him with a surprised expression, “really?”
Then her eyes opened wide. "-Yes, mom."
The last time he had cried had been just before he jumped, listening to John's voice, saying goodbye.
And John walked away.
“Was it-?”, Sherlock whispered hesitantly.
It was almost 8:30 and Greg hadn't arrived yet and Sherlock wanted to leave as far as possible because his brother would arrive soon and he would find out and not allow him to go, of course. He was pacing up and down in his bedroom, when a beep sounded. He looked through the window and Sebastian, Jim and Greg were looking up to him while waiting. "I'll be down."
It was better than thinking of him as a broken man, haunted by his own mind.
"Jealous again, Dr. Watson?"
"Unwise, brother dear." Mycroft was shaking his head, looking down. "Mommy and daddy will be very, very upset." He looked up and smiled almost mischievously. "But... They're used to it anyway, you've always been such a disappointment, Sherlock. A stupid,
John looked at him and never wanted to break the eye contact again.
"Hey! You should be grateful I'm driving with all that noise!"
Well, neither of them would ever know.
"Just like
He stopped in front of a blue photograph. The image depicted a man in a studio filled of drawings everywhere, who had his full attention on his next work of art. The whole atmosphere of the studio was fantastic, as if it was filled with a contained sadness, as if the drawings were capable of breaking with it, as if the drawings around, mixed with the man’s face, were capable of bringing life.
Still, he couldn't manage to move his hand away from where it grasped John's arm.
"Yes. I'll be there in a moment, I'll just go and put these books in the locker and I'll see you at the restaurant, okay?"
Harry's voice sounded distant even though she was in front of him. He was lost in thoughts, not paying attention to a word his sister was saying. What could Sherlock possibly be doing? Was he okay? Still working on the case? What if he was in danger? He really should stop thinking, but he simply couldn't.
They remained silent for a moment, neither of them capable of saying a word, probably for different reasons.
"You will leave, John. It won't work out, you'll meet someone else, or maybe I will. This will never,
John rolled his eyes. “You’re impossible”, he replied.
“Yes well, a perfect depiction of your right eye, right there in the forehead, while the left one is almost touching your lip.”
"Sherlock, I want to stay to help you. I'm not going if you aren't."
greaser
John placed a peck under his jaw before pulling away. He stared at Sherlock for a long time, the smile fixed into place.
“The first time we met-”, John stopped, his back turned to Sherlock. “the first time we met, we went to grab dinner. It looked like a date. Angelo thought it so.”
and yes, he had
"Well, Dr. Watson..." Hawthorne said walking in. "We'll do a little map of your brain, we'll tape your statement and tonight we'll go to your apartment and erase Sherlock Holmes from your mind while you sleep. What do you think?"
John had kissed him.
Sherlock looked at them and then at John.
hatred,
Sherlock smiled and felt a rush of affection because John
He didn't reply.
John shook his head instinctively.
“It reminded me of your painting”, Sherlock said softly.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and stood up in a rush, feeling more dizzy and having to lean against the wall to stop himself from falling down. John walked towards him to hold him. “Sherlock!”
John looked at Sherlock with a serious gaze. "Oh you know me so well. You know
"Of course I have to see him, we go to the same school, we have to do a project together!"
“No need to thank me, John. The credit is all yours, I’ve only provided guidance, but you’ve done it.”
he hadn't been able to take the topic off his head all night.
"Stitched", John simply replied, looking up to Sherlock to show him the work the doctors had done on his forehead.
Sherlock stared at Mycroft defiantly for a long time, then he spoke up. "Fine, you know what? Don't tell me. I don't need your help. I'll find out by myself. Thank you very much." He said turning to leave.
"So... You've talked to John?" Greg asked a bit too straightforward. He realised he probably shouldn't have asked, when he saw the way Sherlock stopped abruptly at the end of the stairs and cleared his throat.
John yelled again. Sherlock felt his knees growing weak.
He hadn't gotten rid of them yet.
Mycroft didn’t reply, he simply sported his hideous smug smile and left. Of course he knew. Of course he bloody knew.
Sherlock closed his eyes. No. This couldn't be happening, but of course it was, of course, this was Mycroft's idea of a proper punishment, a proper lesson to learn, to bring a broken, desperate, unconscious Sherlock and show him to John. He could have been taken anywhere,
John didn't look up.
“What?”, Sherlock asked, his brain not quite catching up with him.
John cleared his throat and looked around, the smile vanishing from his face. “Yeah that’s- that’s good. Lead the way.”
“Let’s put our little baby to the ground, then”, John said with a smile.
John gasped and grew silent. He closed his eyes.
“It was a perfectly logical response, John.”
He smiled softly at him as he took his hands and pulled them down. “Hello. We’re inside the hotel. We’re safe. You’re okay, we’re okay.”
In a second, Sherlock looked down again and saw John, standing right next to that ambulance station, looking up at him with the phone in his hand and he gasped and moved a little.
"Sherlock told me everything that happened, I didn't trust that girlfriend of his, I kept asking him about you and now you're back!" She clasped her hands together, smiling.
He focused instead on the myriad of possibilities ahead of him: he had been able to paint again. He had had an idea and he had put it in the canvas. And it had
For a second.
"May I ask what were you, John Watson doing to get a detention?"
Well it was about to become more embarrassing, because a doctor came upstairs with a small smile on his face and all John could think about was why nobody was taking the case seriously instead of wasting time laughing about the fact his mother was looking for him. "Which one of you is John Watson?" The man said looking at them both.
For someone who didn’t deserve the smallest, tiniest bit of empathy from John.
Hell, was Presley a fucking fortune-teller? He closed his eyes, leaned his head on the back of the seat and took deep breaths, as he heard the car next to him starting up and passing by. Just for this once, he wouldn't change the station until Presley stopped singing.
The teacher dedicated the last couple minutes to explain the first-term final project. John snatched in his pad:
"So Doctor Watson asked us to remove every single memory of you."
"What?" He asked slightly annoyed without taking his eyes off the ceiling.
he was a genius. A
1. I'm sorry! But I love angst and a bit of angst is always necessary to make things more exciting, don't you think? ;)
"I believe it is."
understand you, John!"
In an artistic way. Of course. Nothing else.
Sherlock shook his head.
John cleared his throat and frowned, still not getting used to being called Watson. "The first project draft has to be delivered in two weeks. We need to work on that."
Sherlock smiled and kept the note in his coat's pocket, when John and Harry arrived.
"I am not! I am NOT a square Harry!"
Except it seemed like it lately.
He could also blame it on John’s painting. But no matter what, he couldn’t help relating the sudden change in his life to that broken, bruised artist who without even trying had managed to completely turn it around.
"I'm afraid the woman in the pictures we were sent is not her, sir."
“This was brilliant, Sherlock”.
"So..." he looked around. "How have you been?"
John raised an eyebrow, “did I?”
Sherlock felt John's lips against him. Relentless bruising healing repairing damaging. Sherlock gasped against them and kissed him with just the same earnest, with the same need.
It was easier when he had the violin at hand, of course, but right now walking towards his room where he had last left it seemed like far too much work.
Sherlock snorted. "A normal person would. I wouldn't."
. Pathetic. But he was. Through his mind passed all the crimes he worked on with the police and he felt a pinch of nostalgia. He needed this again. He needed a case like the good old days.
"Have we met before? Your name sounds a bit familiar." John replied.
“Well and how did that work?”Victor said seriously and a bit bitterly.
“No. I’ve got to solve this case. But I don’t have a clue. I have absolutely no idea of who might be behind all of this. Shit, what is wrong with me? I haven’t solved a fucking case in ages!”Sherlock said pressing his fingers on his eyes.
John stared at him. "And you are?"
John looked away and smiled sadly. “You don’t have to.”
John realized she might have gotten it the wrong way. "No, no, no!" He said moving his hands in the air. "That's not what I meant to say! We are not
"Sherlock?"
"Well done, Sherlock!" She patted Sherlock on the shoulder after pulling him into an embrace.
“The biceps, the abdomen, the nipples, the forearms, they’re all part of the whole. They are the melodies forming an entire composition. You go slowly, one by one, focusing on how the light would affect them and when you realize”, he said taking a step back, “you’ve got it.”
John stood silent.
"Thanks, mate." Greg said, turning towards the door. "Well, I've got to go." He said awkwardly.
"I don't know." Mycroft lied, shaking his head. He certainly didn't want to be the one to break the news to his brother. Sherlock still seemed clueless, which only reaffirmed his hypothesis that caring was not an advantage. "The clinic's name is Lacuna."
“I’d never do that.”
"Don't worry. I'll talk to him."
John smiled, because he knew this was the moment when the greaser spent time by himself and read books he liked and seemed genuinely happy. He never looked happy when with Jim and Sebastian and Greg. Not like that. Not like he looked when he was alone, not like he looked when he was with John.
"Excuse me?"
He frowned and leaned closer to take a better look at it. Curiosity got the best out of him and he grabbed it, while Sarah stood frozen and silent.
"Great!" John lied with a nod. Molly seemed pleased enough with the answer and didn't push the matter any longer. John sat and tried to make conversation. "So... what are you talking about?"
Sherlock had…lost his inspiration. Once again.
He stood up, ignoring all of Sherlock's warnings and without saying a word, he walked towards Moran who was laughing and punched him in the face. He stood in there breathing hard, Sherlock turned to look at him with widened eyes and jaw clenched, but before he could say anything, Moran recovered from the punch and, with his nose bleeding, smirked at John. "You piece of shit!"
“Ah. Yes, quite commonly. Sometimes the image just appears in my head and I have to take the brush and express everything that’s in my brain immediately, lest I forget it.”
greaser
Sherlock's trembling stopped as soon as he felt the heat radiating from John's arm as it lightly brushed his own, they used to do that, barely knew the boundaries of each other's personal space, but it startled him anyway. It didn't make sense, it was a cold night, Sherlock was wearing his Belstaff, the fabric of the Belstaff was too thick, and he had a layer of suit jacket and a layer of shirt of distance between skin and skin.
Was it? It was hard telling these days.
Sherlock was already hard, but inexplicably so, as John kissed the scars he got much harder, and he needed John with him, looking at him and inside him. He turned around and looked at John, cupping his face with his hands before leaning in for another lust-filled kiss.
Private? Isn’t the street private enough at three in the morning? What requires them to-
"Well, let me apologize about that in the first place. And second of all, I
Perspective. Open or closed? Open, exposing the long palms, the delicacy of them. The fingers half closed, showing the creases of the articulations.
He opened his eyes an exhaled a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He focused on Sherlock’s smile once more. He felt a deep pain growing and getting heavier, and heavier. He stood expressionless and turned to look at Hawthorne seriously. “I’m ready.”
He lifted his hand to stop her from talking. "I'm not here to talk about the accident. I know you're sorry. And I'm okay with that. Really. It's fine. I'm here to talk about John."
He’d never know.
"It's not so obvious to me."-John said, his tone turned into an awkward kind of voice. He was uncomfortable. He knew it was a bad idea bringing her to the house, but she had insisted so much on it, she was lonely, things with Clara were really, really bad and she looked so unhappy, he wanted to help her, she was desperate to meet this Sherlock guy John had been writing so much about in his blog, well of course she had seen him before, she read the newspapers and watched the news, but she wanted to meet him. He looked at Sherlock, who was so focused in his new book that didn't even realize about all the things Harry just said. Greg, on the other hand did. He just looked at them, speechless.
are convinced of that! Adorable!" Sherlock threw his hands in the air.
He deserved this.
Then slowly, slowly, he felt another hand around his elbow, coming up and sliding over his arm, stopping over his shoulder. Skin on skin. John’s hand was warm and soft and firm and strong.
Two things to finish this chapter:
"Oh, I wouldn't say that." She said standing up, and then she fell, and then Sherlock had to help her to stand up properly. She nodded with a smile and waved goodbye, yelling "CLARAAAA!"
home. The sleuth's expression softened. "John." He said.
he thought. "And I thought I would start this year and everything would be clear, bright, defined. But now it just seems lost, abstract and shapeless. That's what future looks like for me."
“Because-”

“Open your eyes, John.”
"Good, I mean, okay, I missed school a lot. What about you? God! Your car! It looks fantastic!" He shouted happily turning his eyes to the red and white machine John was gladly showing.
"You could have saved me so much time, so many hopes, so many illusions, so many thoughts...Just tell me why, Sherlock. That's all I need."
John threw a small side-smile at Sherlock.
“You proved yourself useful from the very beginning.”
John bit his lip. “Was it good?
He dragged a deep breath that came out all choked. “I’m sorry”, he whispered, as he grabbed John’s shirt and pulled it into fists. “I’m sorry, John.”
His mother looked horrified. "Those are your neighbors! Your
It was the third period and John's back was still hurting and he was still angry but somehow couldn't manage to get the greaser out of his head. He still felt the warmth of his hands touching his face, the worry in his voice as he asked him if he was alright, the way he looked at him, and it looked so,
John smiled a bit. "It will, I suppose."
It was so real. All of it. So real.
Sherlock smiled. “Thank you, John.”
“Maybe I don’t want to be that John Watson anymore.”
“You have to get a bit of rest, Sherlock.”
"I'm sure the first floor is already on fire." Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
John laughed, taking his glasses off and cleaning them with his sweater. "Can we please behave like normal people,
Jim widened his eyes. "What? You are defending him now?"
But if it wasn’t him then who?
"I'll be going home after leaving her, I'll bring you your car tomorrow."
Sherlock looked at it and felt that crushing sadness taking over him. He ignored it.
He wanted to reach and touch and turn the dark into light.
Sherlock shook his head. “Can’t. Have history and Hikes will find out where I was. He already threatened me, next time he catches me smoking I’ll get in serious trouble. Not that I mind, but I want to avoid any future conversation with my brother.”
"John", Sherlock said, trying to calm him.
It was impossible. Not when Sherlock wasn’t around.
Sherlock looked at John and tilted his head to the side. "Please, John. I only have good grades in history and it's because I'm pairing with you. I dislike studying, I hate receiving orders and I hate the fact those idiots believe themselves superiors just because they're older and they think they can just come and impose things on us. I don't work that way and you know it. "
Well, not for Victor at least.
"Ugh, I don't know Harry, I don't know".
But he didn't want to fight with him. He didn't want to be mad at him. He just wanted to be with him. He enjoyed every single moment he spent by his side. Well, most of them. So as soon as he left the store he stood in the sidewalk, took a deep breath, calmed himself and entered to the car, waiting for Sherlock to get out, because he had the hope the greaser realized it was pointless arguing and go and apologize to John. He certainly wasn't going to, because he had all the right to complain. Didn't he?
A look of guilt and pity flashed through John's face before he schooled his expression. Sherlock smiled at him, trying to calm him. "I need my doctor too, back in 221B."
John nodded. "I decided not to listen to you." He was barely able to articulate.
“Sherlock?”
"I can give it to you now, if you feel like talking to him."
Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes. He felt his lungs weren't strong enough yet, and the shock had left him feeling exhausted.
Sherlock remained silent.
Clara smiled. "Would you?"
John stared at him in shock.
Sherlock gasped. “Running from what?”
“You look tired.”
Anthea looked down and Mycroft knew. Shit.  “He was checked in today. I don’t think there’s anything left to do. The process is very fast and very effective. It’s permanent.”
“I’m taking him to hospital”, he listened to John’s voice. He felt when he was picked up and he opened his eyes. His head hurt. So did his back. His back was killing him.
-------------------
Sherlock remembered that day John walked him through the Tate Modern and had taken him to that Van Gogh painting. As Sherlock stared at the paint-coated spirals, he had mixed feelings: on one hand, he wanted to feel aversion to such a low form of expression, on the other he was absolutely marveled by the texture the spirals exuded. Even though there was a very thick layer of glass between him and the painting, his fingers had the sensation that they were tracing the contour of those spirals, could absorb the color and could even bring him back to that single second in which Van Gogh had traced them with a brush.
Stillness. No stagnation.
Harry didn't answer, she just stared at John, who was clenching his fists and smiling, but not in a
And that was a kind of feeling Sherlock didn't even know how to express. It was an unusual kind of happiness and peace, a kind of happiness that is not expressed with a smile, but with a feeling deep inside that is as if all your organs had found a balance, as if the world was slightly more bearable and the sky slightly more beautiful. It was a kind of happiness that was far too big and too massive to embrace with a simple smile.
John closed his eyes, annoyed by Sherlock. He knew Sherlock was right, but he was trying his best, the problem was-
He jumped. He had been far too absorbed in his thoughts. He kept his back to John as he closed his eyes and sighed.
Sherlock turned to look at John, he was only wearing the hospital robe, yet the only part of his body that was trembling was his left hand. He looked down and... "Where did you get those slippers from?", Sherlock asked curiously with a frown, he had seen John's shoes and they were definitely not like the ones he was wearing.
him, for God’s sake!, he thought he was doing the right thing, wasn’t that what he was supposed to do? He wanted to help John, to save him, to rescue him from himself and the memories that haunted him.
"Oh please John, I know you since you were a baby, don't lie to me, you are desperate to go to Sherlock's room and stop whatever thing they are doing!"
Sherlock’s fingers remained over John’s lips, touching the soft skin, leaning closer as if it was a study on human lips and their shapes, on human lips and their colors, on human lips and their textures.
bad”, he said, defensively.
Intriguing.
“The light reflected on the right side of your back, lighting the color of you dressing gown. The bow held high and the pressure of your fingers over the strings. It was as if your body and the bow were forming a diagonal that contrasted with the shape of the window. It was brilliant.”
John walked away from him and stared at the painting over and over and over, in the same way Sherlock had stared at John’s painting. He wondered what went through John’s mind as he looked at it, did he feel somehow identified with Van Gogh? As if he was slowly losing his light and desperately needed to find it back? As if he was dying in life? Did he feel lonely, hopeless, desperate?
John stood up as Sherlock talked and went to his bedroom, closing the door. Sherlock became silent since John moved, he was shocked in surprise. He looked down, unlocked his phone.
“I’m fine”, Sherlock replied. He still felt completely weak, as if the attack had suddenly cut off the last scrapes of energy he had left. John was right, he hadn’t eaten properly in a long time but the daze of the case had been enough to rise up his adrenaline. Still, after all of that he felt completely defeated and weak.
Sherlock scoffed. “Everything I paint is
alone.
John dropped his Chinese sticks, moved his chair with all the strength he could gather and stood up.
"Harry."
"He was sad."
John spoke louder, impatiently. "About what?"
"Don't make me say it again."
John liked colors a lot. He used them a lot. Perhaps-
John sighed and crouched in front of him, he placed a kiss on Sherlock's head before leaving. "See you on Monday, love."
"Oh yes! Lestrade just called, there's been a murder. We have to be at Scotland Yard in twenty minutes" -Sherlock grabbed his coat and went towards the door.
He opened the paper and was surprised to find it had been written by Mycroft.
"Mom cooked dinner for you. You know how rude would be leaving?" John said lowly.
-----------------------
"I don't... Love her."
As he did, he touched Sherlock’s arms. He caressed them up and down. Even through the layers of clothes it was possible to trace the outlines of his muscles. Firm and strong even though he was impossibly skinny.
John smiled softly at him and Sherlock let go of one of his hands to run a hand down his cheek. John closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
Her salad arrived. He didn't eat, he just looked at her, puzzled. Still not sure of what to make of all of this, the situation was absurd, there was nothing usual about this. What could possibly be this?
Sherlock got inside the bed about half an hour later, keeping his distance as the night before. John hadn't fallen asleep yet, he was nervous, he didn't know what he was nervous about, but he was. Sherlock looked at John and flashed him a little smile. "Goodnight, John. Sleep tight."
rising
"I'm fine, I'm good. Any other reason for your visit?"
He knew that if Mike were to photograph him now, he wouldn’t be able to bring warmth into the picture, he would only bring a sense of death, a sense of stillness and quietness. John would impersonate the war.

“Are you?”
kind of guy. But suddenly this Holmes came and his life turned into a mess. Greasers started picking on him and he didn't need to ask, he knew it was all because of Sherlock. He couldn't understand why or what he could have possibly done. He became the school's target.
“I always do that. It slows me down.”
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, John."
It was 6:30 in the morning when the text woke Sherlock up. He opened his eyes and blearily read the text from Lestrade.
Sherlock's eyes widened but he didn't interrupt him. He sat next through him as John told him, one by one, each and every single thing he'd lived in Afghanistan. His face was expressionless, as if he was in some kind of trance. His voice never wavered. He never stopped to think, as if it was a tale he'd known by heart since he was a kid. Sherlock ached to reach out and take his hand, but he stood still, knowing quite well that John didn't want that at the moment.
This chapter wouldn't have been possible without
John took a deep breath while he was standing in front of the door of the house of the crime scene. Sherlock turned to look at him, worry drawing in his expression. "Are you sure you want to enter, John?"
Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the book. "I like chemistry."
Sherlock looked incredibly confused.
Greg stared at the doctor, who still looked completely unaware. "Yes, a year or two."
Sherlock was wrong. Sherlock was completely wrong. He turned and looked at the so-called-painting and hated it and despised it and thought it was the most meaningless and stupid thing he’d ever seen. He wanted to destroy it. It was the worst thing he’d ever done.
"Just- shut up for a goddamned second. Don't you dare, don't you dare say those things."
The intense light coming through the windows woke him up. He squinted, his head was pounding and he felt as if his eyes were burning.
"I didn't hear you", Sherlock said with his eyes fixed on the front window, "now, let's go."
He would never be capable of achieving
John blinked. “What?”
"Fine. Sure, I'll stay there tonight." -He finally agreed. Harry was smiling widely.
They climbed upstairs, John struggling a bit to reach the stairs but Sherlock knew how uncomfortable he felt whenever people noticed his limp, so he remained quiet and climbed in rapidly, as if he hadn't realized John was limping at all.
John groaned. Sherlock remained still and silent. He felt all his strength falling  apart, leaving only weakness and a kind of pain he could only relate with a deep empathy with John.
Yet, Sherlock saw everything it wasn't saying directly.
“The attention, the fake friendships, the elite who adored you one day and hated you the other, it was unbearable, Sherlock.”
”, he said, a little sharply.
It was meant to be there.
Clearly Sherlock's brother didn't believe in any of his words. "Well, I'll better be off." John said turning on the car.
It was an old building in London's suburbs. It was boring. It was not the place he would ever imagine John Watson living in.
He had to stop this. He had to stop wishing what he’d never have.
John closed his eyes and dragged a deep breath.
Oh. Oh. Someone killed a year before his return. A case that hadn’t been solved before. Killed at their own house.
"Oh great, you could teach him some things about Rock n' Roll. Seems like he needs to learn them too." Sherlock said smiling sarcastically.
He tossed the money hurriedly at the cabbie before walking (running) out. As soon as he entered to Scotland Yard, he found Donovan standing in front of him, her arms crossed. "Freak, your husband's looking for you."
He thought about how utterly
"Is everything okay, sir?"
As soon as they broke the kiss, John stared at him and seemed to realise that Sherlock was all dressed-up. He frowned. "Where are you going?"
He kept doing stupid choices, over and over.
And he walked away, towards the kitchen, giving John some space.
"Yes."
Damn it.
Later they finally decided to go back to the apartment, where Harry was expecting them. She was holding a glass of wine in her hand. She looked positively drunk. Sherlock entered to the living room while John locked the door.
Sherlock smiled and followed him towards the door.
But he wasn’t like that, he moved by pure logic, that was who he was.
Definitely a bit not good.
"He's here, he fell asleep, and it's too late for him to drive home..."
He stood right by his car, pacing from one side to the other. He didn't know why, but there was this sudden impulse within him, this sudden
His parietal lobe no longer registered the touch, for there was no touch to register.
He forced himself to look up and he found Sherlock's blue/gray/green eyes fixed on his lips. It was irresistible.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath and nodded.
isn't.
"And how are you feeling about that?"
Sherlock stared at him "You just talked to Mycroft and told him what had happened, you felt tired but felt the need to stay awake so you served a cup of coffee but thought it wasn't enough so you got yourself some wine. You talked to Mrs. Hudson, apparently the sex holiday is not going quite well, I think his new man is seeing someone else. You had a fight with Harry this morning, she is drinking again after all the money you spent in treatments. She's also talking to Clara again, they might come back together, she didn't tell you because she didn't know how to."
“I’m using a larger brush to paint the- what did you call it? Never mind, the white part, for obvious reasons”, he said as he stood in front of the canvas again.
John came back early the next day, he was feeling better, still hurt, but far more relaxed, at least he could face him now. He entered the apartment and caught Sherlock sitting in the living room, touching his violin without playing it. He didn't look up. John took a deep breath.
a great use of colors.
"What is
Isabella had the scar. Isabella had been to Lacuna. Isabella was dead.
Sherlock didn't say anything, he stopped looking at her and turned his head back to the window at the same moment she started talking about the fall. He still felt guilty, it wasn't enough to know John had forgiven him, he wondered, how was it even possible that he wanted to be his friend after everything he had done? He had been a terrible friend. But friends protect each other don't they? He was protecting John, of course he was, wasn't he? Everything Harry was saying to him was proving otherwise. John had never been more unhappy and it had been because of him.
"Yes. You will be this afternoon, when you two stay after lunch shaking the erasers. Is that clear?"
end well. Too many mistakes had been made, too many things had remained unsaid.
“I’m glad you did. That means you’re enjoying them”, Sherlock replied, trying not to convey the surprise at John’s statement.
"Yes, but he didn't understand any reason! It was a waste of time. Anyway, I have to go. See you later." He said leaving his chair.
"I've been reliably informed I don't have one." Sherlock said looking really serious.
Sherlock simply stared at John, silently begging him not to take him to the hospital, because he would drive himself mad if he had to go there again.
"We were assigned this damn work for history in pairs." They laughed. Sherlock frowned because again it
Sherlock smiled and looked at John up and down. "That is not an option."
He had acted on impulses most of the time when it came to John, he simply couldn’t help it. Ever since he looked at that masterpiece at the Tate Modern, he realized that life in such a way was nothing but a lie. Sometimes impulses were as necessary as pure logic.
John closed his eyes. He turned to look at his sister.
“You have got to stop yelling at me!”, John yelled.
Sherlock looked down, feeling himself blush. John bent down once again and took him in his mouth once again. Sherlock tried to control his hips from jerking as John licked along his length and it didn't take long, because the simple sensation of John's mouth on him, the idea of what they were doing and what he was doing it with, was enough to drag him over the edge. He needed something to hold onto and roamed through his own body until he found John's head, and he started stroking his scalp, pulling at his hair, just a little. John moaned loudly and the vibration of his voice was the last thing he felt before he came. John kept his mouth there, swallowing the come, and Sherlock could feel the smile drawing in his face. It was perfect. Having John doing this was perfect.
John widened his eyes. "What? All of them?"
*******
"He looked happy when he was with you. I tried to stop it. But I couldn't. I knew better than that, he looked genuinely happy, like I had never seen him before..."
“You had a nightmare”, Sherlock said, staring fixedly at him. John had moved away so they weren’t that close, but still, the tension was quite palpable.
But he hated drawing figures, and that was what he had been focusing on practicing so far, because he really, really needed to practice them.
John was terrified of asking the next question but he
John was making breakfast and Sherlock was reading the newspaper when Harry went downstairs, in her pjs and looking still a little sleepy. "Good morning Sherlock, good morning baby brother!"
Eventually, his breathing went back to normal.
"Alcoholic." Sherlock said, nodding.
Sherlock blinked. He stood silent for a moment before replying, “but I understood it when I saw it, John. This painting says enough”.
which meant he didn’t need this idiot anymore.
"I don't have one." Sherlock said seriously.
“Da Vinci always focused on two things: light and expression”, he said, leaning closer to John, as if he was telling him a secret. “He used the way light reflected on the hands to be able to draw them, but more importantly, he felt that hands could tell stories. And so, expression is fundamental. Hands must be positioned so they can become stories. Play with them. Use the lights. Highlight the knuckles, the veins, the bones. Think of the person you’re drawing in a broader context, does he or she works a lot with their hands?”
John looked down. He felt embarrassed from being caught looking at Sherlock’s marks, but he kept thinking about it, wondering why Sherlock did it. He was a genius, how did drugs help?
“Sherlock”, he whispered.
Except he had already done it and that was the reason why John was in a hospital bed now.
Sherlock laughed, “sometimes I wonder if I might regret teaching you this in the future”, he said, good-heartedly.
Hikes called and shit, John got up angrily to receive it because he didn’t want to hear his freaking name right next to Sherlock’s anymore. He took the paper from Hikes, looked at the grade and felt a sudden relief, they did make a good pair when it came to this work. He let his eyes wander around Sherlock, just for a moment.
If John ever needed a wake-up call then this was it. He realized of something that had always come to his mind but he tried to avoid constantly: he didn't have the slightest chance, not the smallest, not the tiniest glimpse of an opportunity of ever being with Sherlock Holmes. He had to get over it, to leave the hopes behind, to stop dreaming of things that were, well, improbable. No, more like impossible. Nothing was ever going to happen, ever.
Charcoal and white canvas. And he was slowly going back to the stagnation he had suddenly recovered from.
John cracked in laughter.
"About what?"
"Was." Sherlock corrected her, without opening his eyes.
John cleared his throat. “I’m sorry, for all of this. I shouldn’t have- I”, he rubbed his forehead. “You should go to sleep.”
I never thought I would erase someone like Sherlock Holmes.
He also grabbed Isabella’s, taking the tape off the player. Just in case.
"I want to do the history project." Sherlock shrugged.
"...Yes?" Sherlock said growing tired of the conversation because God, Harry was drunk, but he felt a pinch of interest.
"You- um- You'll be discharged today. Your brother's downstairs, signing the papers", he said, unable to meet Sherlock's eyes.
John didn’t reply. He just stared into the distance.
How is that even possible? He’s the best painter of all times!”
are you going to force me this time?" It took all of John's effort to understand what Sherlock was saying, because it came almost like a whisper, only meant for his brother to hear it.
John stood straight, his posture rigid. "Don't. Say. That."
“I know”, John replied, placing his cheek on top of Sherlock’s head. “I know you are, Sherlock?”
"They do look like one" -Greg said with a smile. "It was a pleasure meeting you, Harry."
"She is the only one who stands me." Sherlock said simply, as if that sentence didn't say a lot about him.
So he stood silent as John kept track of his signs.
He grabbed John's hands, intertwined their fingers and stared at him. John was breathing hard, and so was Sherlock. They needed each other desperately. This was new, all of this. Sherlock had needed John desperately every single day since January 29th, 2010, but he had never needed him like this, like he needed to pull him apart and to merge every single bit of him with his own until they were one. No. The need had never been so absorbing, so deep, so
Sherlock nodded, with a small smile on his face.

"All I need is to see him and know he will survive."
And then he felt an acute pain in his upper abdomen, just below his chest.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath. So John had been asking him because he’d seen the news. Hardly a difficult deduction. He looked up the internet for news on the Continental Hotel.
little boy."
"You went into Sherlock's bedroom! You looked so calm and cool and I honestly thought you were going to tell him everything about your feelings, but I couldn't stop you! I've never heard you more determined. Now you tell me what happened when you got into that room!"
He hadn’t seen John again since Mike’s gallery. Nor he intended to. Certainly not.
Sherlock gasped in surprise. John held him with the same determination and care he had done last night. “Thank you”, John whispered against Sherlock’s neck, “thank you for last night. I hate having to leave but I’ve got to. I’ll see you later tonight okay? As soon as I’m done I’ll come back here, if that’s fine for you.”
"Waiting for what?"
Mycroft smiled and stood up to leave. “At last you’ve decided to draw, huh? What made you change your mind? Was the lack of drugs… or the discovery of a new one?”, he raised an eyebrow.
have changed. He has changed you, and I have to thank him for it. It may sound a little silly, but I'm happy when I'm with you, John. It's like I needed this, I'm going through a difficult time, but I haven't drunk any booze in 48 hours, and I'm happy. And I'm enjoying this, even though you're endlessly bored and you miss your creepy detective. Do this for me, would you?"
he wanted to say.
Shit. The history project. How was John supposed to ignore Sherlock when they had to do a work together? "Yes."
last." Sherlock said looking down and regretting immediately each one of his words. John didn't want to admit it, but the greaser
"Let me talk to him." Melissa said, exasperated.
"Another what?" -Sherlock said confused.
Sherlock nodded, mirroring the expression he had made in history class.
Maybe, just maybe his heart rate was accelerating. Which was good, it usually started like that. Then, his body temperature would raise, his mind would go blank and he would be in a completely different reality. Which was what he loved the most.
"We were really worried about you."
Hikes took out John and Sherlock's paper and John swallowed and took a deep breath.
"Michael Jones, the only name I can find. Here it says that he and Melissa dated for-", he turned the page, "two years before their break up. That was two weeks before she checked into Lacuna, so she probably erased him from her mind."
the one who had killed all those people, but if they didn’t have the knife they didn’t have any real proof against him, except for the fact he had access to the patient’s records, but that was hardly incriminating.
"Distract me?"
Sherlock was about to open his mouth and answer, but John lifted a hand, as ordering the greaser to shut up. He did, so John took a step forward and looked seriously at his mom. "Mom, I want to be a doctor. This is my training!"
“I am. And I agree”, John said, feigning a confidence he wasn’t quite feeling at the moment. He considered Sherlock’s eyes for a little while, and turned away. Sherlock slowly dragged his hand away.
He closed his eyes. Why? Why had he done that? How could he have done that? That was the stupidest thing he could ever possibly do, how could he have failed to control his brain in such a spectacular way? He sighed.
About an hour later, he put his violin down and went to the bed. John was sleeping soundly, and Sherlock laid down softly on the other side of the bed.
”, he asked, confusion tinging his voice.
"Shut up. This isn't helping you, Sherlock. Now, let's try to organise a bit of this mess, we don't want Hawthorne to suspect anything once he comes back", Lestrade said, offering a hand for Sherlock to stand up.
Sherlock nodded.
History today.
Sherlock stood up and looked at him. "Promise me you won't tell anyone." John nodded. Sherlock doubted for a second and started pacing down the living room. "Two years ago, Moriarty came in here and we had a talk. He said he wanted to solve our problem. Our final problem. He said that he owed me a fall. Finally, well, he managed to solve the problem, apparently, though it costed his life. Before the fall I used to find the 'I O U' message everywhere, John, everywhere, and it was driving me crazy. I don't know what kind of sick trick this is, but Moriarty can't be alive, he simply can't. He died. I saw him kill himself. It's just not possible."
Sherlock moved towards the record player and took a vinyl. He put it up, showing it to John, who opened his eyes as soon as he heard the greaser's voice. "Alright Watson, you
In a moment in which she seemed a bit distracted by a message on her phone, John looked over to her desk and realized the newspaper had a picture of him with... someone.
John was cooking. He was standing in the kitchen and smiled as soon as he turned to look to Sherlock.
"Oh, so you're joining?"
"Not important", Sherlock said, clearly impatient, "what kind of mark does it leave?"
