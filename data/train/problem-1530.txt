'When John and I found out that we would be having twins, and then having twin girls, we sat down with tea in the middle of the night, still awake half due to terror and the other half due to this relentless joy. Two daughters for us, these two old, outcast men who never thought they would be married, let alone become fathers. That night we chose the names for these two beautiful girls. River Grace and Indigo Rose. I had wanted to wait to see which child would fit each name, naming them only after their personalities had formed, but John said that we couldn't keep calling our daughters 'A and B' until they were six months old and that their names would suit them just fine. As per usual with these matters, John was correct.
I stacked the girls' presents according to category and size, as I do every year. John's presents sat to the left of them. John was sitting in his chair, snacking on the cookies and milk we had left out. He better have left the ginger nuts for me.
"That's my girl. Go sit with Dada until I get breakfast ready."
Indie popped her head off his shoulder and immediately his face brightened, putting on a smile that was meant only for her.
"Daddy tried, he tried really hard, but it kept falling down, so I called Uncle Mycroft and he and Daddy built it!" Indigo said, still leafing through a book in Sherlock's arms.
John had grown used to his flatmate and now boyfriend's eccentric nature. He loved him for it, he had never loved anyone as much as he did Sherlock. He loved every fiber of his being, everything he was and was not.
John spent the remainder of the evening in a state of numb despair. How had he missed this? He had known Sherlock for 4 years now and loved him for just as long. How didn't he know? He sat in his armchair, wringing his hands and wracking his brain for any hint that Sherlock had tried to tell him, tried to reach out to him. He paced the floor throughout the night, hoping that Sherlock would reappear from the bedroom. He tried several times to get him to come out, or at least answer him, but all he was ever met with was silence.
"I'm done, Papa and Daddy! Can we read now?"
River waved her hand happily back and forth, shouting "I love you, Indie!" until she could no longer see the butterfly.
But what was the song?
"Papa said that too when we got done at the hairdressers, he said we got all that from you, Daddy, but I think we got it from both of you." Indigo said.
I could see his eyes scan the room and stop on the kitchen table.
I followed the sounds of mourning, through narrow corridors that twisted and turned like a maze, the crying getting louder as I went along.
"Look inside, love."
"What?" I said as I shook my head in disbelief and stood behind the girls to get a look for myself.
He was cut off with shouts of "SURPRISE!" as he entered the flat.
"River, what are you doing?" He said, confused.
Sherlock folded the paper back in half, slipping it into the pocket of his dressing gown. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, hands steepled. After a moment, his head sunk into his hands and sobbed, waiting for those strong, warm arms to wrap around him like they had so many times before, for that deep voice to tell him it was alright.
"Fifteen minutes was a bit of overkill really, John. Remember, they are our little girls. The most astute brains and biggest hearts in all of England."
"There you are, Sunshine, Daddy'll be back soon with medicine to make your throat feel better."
I glanced at the picture I had taken, Indigo expectantly looking up at me.
The group started back towards the car when River suddenly popped her head up and pointed.
He tapped his umbrella on the floor and sighed.
"I think that's a big penguin!" River giggled.
"Hello?"
When I opened the door, Sherlock was standing there, holding out a tissue for me. I took it from him and played with it in my hands, twisting and turning it over and over.
I thought about how often it had been said that she was just like me, but as I sat and rocked her, all I could see within her was John. She was as brave and as strong as my soldier, as caring and compassionate as my doctor. I had given her unruly raven curls and ice blue eyes, but John had given River her heart.
River's mouth fell open and she broke into a sprint, running to the sister that she loved so dearly.
The only thing shining brighter in that limo was Sherlock's face as the girls shrieked with joy and began to name the constellations they saw.
By the time Sherlock and I made it back to Indie's room, both girls were fast asleep. River lay on her right side and Indie lay behind her with her IV tubing and tape covered arm thrown over River. Both girls slept like Sherlock, with their limbs sprawled out as far as they could go. Raven and sandy blonde curls intertwined on the pillow they shared and their breaths were in tandem with each other, little snuffles emanating from the girls with each breath.
I knew the children could barely pour cereal for themselves and with the noise that awoke me, I was getting more and more anxious that they had injured themselves or were about to hurt themselves. I swung my legs down to get off the bed, when Sherlock quickly shook his head and motioned for me to get back into bed.
"Papa! Daddy! Come say goodbye!" Indie shouted from the edge of the ocean, seafoam wrapping around her ankles.
"Was that fun, my darling?" Sherlock laughed.
"Come off it Sherlock, you've been talking to them about cases and your experiments since the day we brought them home, I've heard you while I'm in the shower."
At that moment, Mrs. Hudson hurried into the flat, fussing over John and I, fussing over the girls, snapping photos, and hurrying John to get into his suit for the party. I slipped into my coat and scarf and walked toward the door.
"Half past six, love, best we get up before they decide to tear into the presents themselves."
She lay sleeping, her small body somehow taking up the entire bed, her arm wrapped around her teddy bear, her legs tangled in the sheets. Jack lay at her feet, tail wagging at my appearance. I bent and pet him on the head, his silly face making me almost laugh.
"John, we should capture who they really are, not the perfect, polished version. I am not going to make my girls do what my parents did to me," he huffed and threw himself on the couch.
"Well Papa, since Indie loves the Moon and space so much, I decided we need to go there, and Indie is practicing becoming Princess of the Moon."
John sighed, his message again remaining unanswered. He was worried beyond belief. Nothing had ever shaken Sherlock Holmes out of the mold that John had built for him. He was larger than life, the most brilliant man in the world. The touches of human suffering that he had seen in Sherlock these last two days frightened John more than any bullet, any bomb, any crazed murderer they had met.
"I won't let him find you, we'll hide together, in the farthest place we can find, the darkest hiding spot. I'll stay there with you as long as we need."
"Right, well, I'll be in here if you need me."
Her breaths were growing more shallow, more gurgled, and I knew that there wasn't much time left at all. Sherlock looked at me with eyes drowning in sorrow and I could see that he knew it too.
He merely grunted in response and got out of bed and started towards the door.
"Daddy, can I have a new room?" She had asked one night after she had calmed down from her nightmare.
I found Sherlock and Indigo asleep on the sofa, unfinished tea on the table beside them. I took a quick picture and walked over to Sherlock, shaking him gently.
"I love you," I simply said, joining him on the floor to help him sort.
Not good, not good at all.
Indigo sighed and kicked her legs against the side of the bed.
"Thank you, Daddy," she quietly said.
"It isn't enough!" I said with a painful cry as I bent into myself, tears continuing to pour from my eyes.
I had gone to the biggest room my palace held, a room strung with streamers of pink and purple, stars shooting across the sky, their brilliance filling the room with a shining light. Toys, dolls, crayons, and empty bottles of bubble bath littered the soft white carpet and laughter filled the room. I opened a file and I was standing in green grass as jet black and soft blonde curls in royal blue coats spun around me. John, about three years younger, stood across the way, beckoning to us. The girls were in my arms then, their chubby faces dimpled as they beamed at me. I went to John and he gave all of us kisses, taking Indigo from me. We sat on the blue blanket spread out beneath us. The girls waved their little hands at passersby, earning smiles and friendly 'hellos.' John let out his hearty laugh as the girls called to the ducks. He put birdseed into their hands and they stuck them out to the cautious ducks approaching.
"Sherlock!"
The oven buzzed, making Sherlock and John jump in their seats.
"I need you too, Indigo, I can't go, darling, not to a life without you," I said, crouching down to her level, "Here I can hold you in my arms, I can watch you play, hear your laugh, your lovely voice. I can give you a goodnight kiss, we can read together, I can teach you violin. Here you're alive, and back there, in that terrible world, you are not. That is a reality I cannot face, Indigo Rose."
"Open your mouth as wide as you can for me, love, Papa's just going to look at your throat."
He gave me a brief smile and nodded once, stepping quickly into the front room, brandishing popsicles for the two girls squealing on the sofa. I walked to my chair and sat down, drinking from my tea and flipping open today's paper. It was quiet then, with only the sounds of paper crinkling and fingers flying on a keyboard breaking the silence of the peaceful morning.
I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest.
She nodded and stared wide-eyed at John.
I gently placed a kiss on the top of his head and said, "Let's go love, we should go back to Indie." I stood up, gently tugging him with me, but he stayed glued to the spot.
"I'll be home in just a bit, then you can head down to the Yard, alright? Just make sure she keeps drinking and if her temperature goes up again, you can give her paracetamol."
Charlotte sniffled, wiping her tears with her gloved hand.
He brought his eyes up again, sheepishly looking at his older brother.
I fell to my knees as the world around me shook violently, the sidewalk beneath me crumbling.
"River, love, what happened?" I said to her as calmly as I could.
Sherlock smiled at this text he had received earlier in the day as he walked through the front door of 221B, the dying light of the summer sun casting his shadow onto the steps inside. It was late, much later than when he told John he would be home. He hoped he wouldn't be terribly upset, he hated upsetting John even though it was something he often inadvertently did. He climbed the stairs to the flat, each step creaking under his weight.
"I can't think of it any other way now."
He would recall later that this is what made him lose it, the feeling of John's cold hand, when it had been so warm, so strong, guiding him wherever he went. John's warm hand meant it was safe, it was alright. Now it was cold, lifeless. And this to Sherlock, more than the blood and the gun, meant that John was gone, meant that he wasn't here with him.
Indie leaned over and whispered into River's ear. River's face becoming serious and nodding as Indie spoke.
"John, I could easily teach them at home, they're too advanced for these classes, they'll be utterly bored!" Sherlock sulked.
"Thank you Uncle Mycroft! Stay and play with us!" River said, hanging onto Mycroft's arm.
We would get one more Christmas, maybe one more birthday with Indigo. We would not get those difficult teenage years, to send her off to university, or walk her down the aisle at her wedding. We would not see her fall in love with children of her own.
"I love you too, I'll see you in the morning." He said as he always did, placing another kiss on the pale cheek.
Sherlock and John watched the little girl when her parents were at work or just needed some time to themselves. They relished in the feeling of a baby in their arms again, the smells of baby shampoo and powder, and the high-pitched giggles of a happy baby.
"What are you working on?" I asked, sitting on the edge of her bed.
I glanced up at him. His eyes were wild and filled with tears, his nostrils flaring with his increasingly rapid breaths.
"Good. Thank you, that will be all. Goodbye."
But Mycroft had already spoken to all the top pediatric oncologists in the world, some of them twice over. And they all said the same thing.

title having been thrown out the window.
He opened his mouth;
“Now what are you gawping at?” Mike had wandered back over, eyeing John with a look of ‘do tell?!” as if he expected some salacious secret to be revealed.
John swallowed. Dear God. What monster had he now created?  He sat up straighter. Fork in hand. He eyed it with distrust. Did he dare take another bite with Sherlock watching? He sat deliberating as he slid another slice under it's tongs. Then he looked around the room. Gauging how many people, if any, could really see him right now? If they looked? He counted. One, two, three …  about a solid half-dozen. But they would have to really turn. Really try. Sherlock was right. Almost no one could see him in this corner.
He did not want to hear the apologies and awkward farewells that were no doubt coming.
He gave a small cute wave to John, as if in acknowledgement of the fact that John had been expecting
John had eyed it every morning.
"You boys need a stern talking to, that's what!" She managed at last, placing a plate in front of his nose harshly. She was able to pull Sherlock out of his reverie for a moment to focus on some soup that came next.
? Helped John out of it sooner? This self-contained pit he had dig himself in?
John smiled. Sherlock had clearly been living here a while. But he had not truly settled into it. Everything his eye landed on, indicated the transience of this place.

day ...
When they finally stumbled back into the hallway at 221B, it was well past midnight.
. For if Sherlock had not lived, then John would not have had a reason to go on living ... all those years ago. He might have ended it then. Serendipity. Fate. It had all happened for a reason. Made him change his entire life in a moment.
... I mean ...   I get the pity, Sherlock! ... I really do!! Taking care of me. Like a kicked dog. Make it feel better, since it stumbled into your house! Give it warmth and food …  Was that all I was to you?
Sherlock's baritone voice behind him, reverberated through his very bones. He felt it down to his toes. And in the soft crook of his neck. And in the tingle of his hands.

His eyes drifted across the darkened room once more, his breath coming in in ragged, grieving gulps. Making him heave with it ... a gutteral urge tearing the small sound from his throat. This tightness in his chest ... this. suffocating. need. ... to breathe!
“Sure, I guess?” Nat answered, noncommittally. Waving him off. Like she was thinking.
She hadn’t eaten in hours. She was exhausted. And she was doing her best to keep them busy and distracted … no matter the reason why.
Oculist?
And caught the expression
Sherlock allowed himself to look up then, a shock of genuine surprise written all over his features, "Oh."
But then Sherlock halted halfway ... as if he himself did not know quite why his own hands were also betraying him? And trying to brush away the tear from John's face?
Hopelessness to it.
And hit send.
There was after all

In which, no one is coming to dinner service.
And that distress he caught in her eyes after each call, was not unlike his own,
"I was incurably slow on the uptake, I'll admit," Sherlock took another sip, looking anywhere but at John.
She had shown up a few times here and there. Always with questions and a quick rush of words when she did speak. Though she was more often silent. Contemplative. Her body was either perpetually in motion or 100% foot on the breaks, unable to think about moving.
… John bit his tongue and tried to keep from growling.
"You said, ‘A bit mean springing it on you like that. Could have given you a heart attack. But in my defense, it was

Brilliant.
as if hung up
… utter astonishment …
Of that he was certain.
"Women, eh?" The cabbie asked, trying to make it light.
They sat there. Listening to the clock tick-tock-ticking away. John leaning back against the counter, casual charm. Sherlock leaning forward in his chair, brilliantly engaged. Elbows on his knees. Tea cup in his hands. Eyes locked. Scanning. Holding each other in stasis there. Not wanting to break the connection. Relishing in this moment of being able to do this very thing. Hardly daring breath. Or thought.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock nodded in agreement.
. John didn't seem to register the faux pas.
"I just want to know one thing..."
He could see the text ellipsis before the rest of the lines appeared:
Ribbons of gold streak throughout the marble. Spidering out in a web of fractured beauty beneath your fingertips.
Like he knew that some customs must be observed, but hadn’t quite figured out the where’s and the why’s?
Sherlock nodded.
He pocketed the slip of paper, containing his one point of contact with destiny …
And the key to unlock it.
"Is that a boy's name? Or a girl's name??"
"It didn't take long dear," Mrs. Hudson said with a long-suffering look in his direction, "did you

Usually so anxious to get their tip and hustle you out to make room for the next customer ...  the waiters tonight seemed to pass him as if he was one of them. Belonged here. Had rights the other PG's did not. He found himself smiling again. Good spot here. In the corner ...
And he felt foolish again. Beginning to withdraw his hand ...
He was ripped open by the invitation that had been laid at his feet. Only to be taken away. A paradise built on clouds. Fading. With every step Watson took. It was pulled further away. A void being drawn wide, that would soon engulf the world.
Not just the gaping black hole of purposelessness, that had been left in the wake of his honorable discharge from the service that had meant everything to him until that fateful wound …

Passed within a few inches of each other.

Sherlock, seemed to sense the dangerous mood that John was in, but held firm.
He knew where he wanted to be.
He knocked his head back a few times. Hearing the hollow thud it made with each connection ...
'We have to hide in this cupboard, John!'
Sherlock took another deep breath in, and out. Centering himself. Checking his watch carefully, and then steepling his hands beneath his chin …
Sherlock had known he was counting anyways,
"He may try to walk away. Catch up to him if need be! He
He wondered if she had anything worth forgetting?
Sherlock followed in Lestrade’s wake to give his statement. Hopping into the passenger side of the car like a kid on a fieldtrip. John knew NSY would have a job ahead of them, rounding up the last few stragglers from Moran’s crew … but for now, the main threat was down. And that was enough. Sherlock could begin to be real again. Be seen about London. Wear the posh coat … and John had positively
rather thin …?
Sherlock could not get the man out of his mind … and had nearly driven Mrs. Hudson out of hers! What with his violin playing and temper tantrums the last few days.
“Could get used to this,” John teased. He pushed open the door to 221b with his palm, Mrs. Hudson had left it on the latch for them.
After all, Sherlock was rarely wrong ...
John cannot understand when she says ‘yes’. Running into a girl quite literally, at the market is certainly a rom-com cliché - but John never thought that actually happened in real life. He had laughed at himself, and she was charming and funny about the whole thing, and had laughed with him. One thing led to another, and they were exchanging numbers. He wasn't really interested in anything serious. And couldn't find the appetite to ask anyone out. He was kind of enjoying his Friday night rendezvous ...
Down, down, down.
Like this was already routine ...
Natasha had just ended the call. Bits and pieces of the conversation had been more than John had overheard to-date, and what appeared to have been a particularly gruesome scene in Minske was the subject of this evening’s talk.
In a sea of black and gray.
He was sitting across from him, here,
John couldn’t help the ridiculous smile forming from deep within. Something inside was uncoiling and stretching. Breathing for the first time in … he didn’t know how long?
"Thankfully for you, Mrs. Hudson here is an angel. And

His face was looking a bit stubbly and he knew that by five o’clock he would have well earned the shadow that was going to be on his face …
Glaring holes into Mycroft's chair. Mycroft's locked doors. Mycroft's damn fucking stupid goddamn paintings!! He was livid. He grabbed something off of Mycroft's desk and threw it against the nearest door. Making a hollow echo. But having no other effect.
With a noble lift of his chin, he dropped the words in John’s lap. Like a bomb.
from just my message?!
“You okay?” he asked. Fear gripping him … as Sherlock was being so silent.
And leaned over to kiss John then, lightly, on the lips. A friendly reminder of their earlier passions shared, and a taste of what was to come … as he pulled away. His look was playful.
Nevermind that their star Chef was the best lover and companion John Watson could ever have dreamt of …
And was surprised to find that he didn't have to fake it. ANY of it.

He smiled a cheeky grin. Nothing of the anger he had let spill last time he was here, remained.
And he was irreplaceable.

It was extremely intimate.
John’s surprise was evident.
Sherlock snatched the coat up and stormed out of the room without wasting his breath.
Sherlock was saying from his perch on the top of the booth. Logically the only place to sit with Emmy in his seat. He was eying John with some amusement … and something softer … that made John’s stomach flutter a bit.

It may have been selfish of him. But once the insanity had calmed down ... and acceptance of reality fell into place ... John was glad that this was the day Thanos had decided to exact his cruel justice. For justice was the one thing that had been denied Sherlock before his fall. And justice - real justice - could have prevented it.
Sherlock fiddled with his own hands. His fingers nervously knotting and wringing. He decided on playing with his sleeve cuff, and twisted at a loose thread there … instead.

Cold linoleum. Uncovered. Exposed.
John had forgotten how brilliant they were. How they changed with Sherlock’s surroundings. With his attire. With his mood.

He declared it triumphantly.
Sherlock thought. And then …
At first, Sherlock had just been relieved to find him again.

--<>--
As his hand slipped away, he brushed it over Sherlock's bottom lip, perhaps just a little longer than was necessary ...     Sherlock blinked back at John. At last stunned silent. Saying nothing as John pulled away.
And through it all. The jumper stayed on. Sherlock’s hands roaming beneath it. It was a pleasure that John had not realized would be so fulfilling … like the taboo of touch had been broken between them. And they could at last take what they had always wanted. To keep. He was glad Sherlock had made him keep it on.
John silently Thanking him with every breath in and out …
Those he believed in.
He smoothed out the duvet. Straightening the covers beneath him, as he let that sink in.
John kept stealing glances. Just to enjoy how much he was enjoying the boat ride.
John breathed out a huff of frustration, and tried to say something. No words came out. He ruffed at his hair with splayed fingers, making it stand on end. Then he gave Sherlock a desperate look. A plea,
“Hello. Fine. You aren’t who I called for, but you’ll do. Anyway, doesn’t matter,” the man was speaking so quick and biting off each word, John could hardly keep up - and hang on! ...
John nearly jumped out of his skin when the young waiter came up behind him where he now stood - and tapped him on the shoulder. He hadn't realized that he had gotten up in anticipation and

Was courageous. He had bravely faced death. He would bravely face it again if need be.
Would Sherlock have turned like that? Switched in an instant? If John himself had been the one that disappeared?
Where it would it have lead? He asked himself.
Instinct had kicked in. Taken over. Years of army training. Of defending. But in preventing one wound, he had created a much greater wound. One that might never heal. At least he had breathed a sigh of relief, Sherlock was still standing.
The carefully disguised layers of both of their armor, having been stripped and left lying on the ground around them. Defenseless.
John barked out a laugh.
the closeness of John? Even if they were relatively still, strangers.
He followed an errand boy with a package of some kind through the next doorway, a long narrow hallway greeting him. Finally free of the din and ruckus behind. He hadn’t realized how much his head was splitting …
Camouflage.
It was a knowing smile, this time.
A puzzled expression crossing his face.
Sherlock could hear the rustle of cloth even as Mike was apologizing, and forced his face to remain impassive against the grin that threatened to pull across his features ...
! THAT IS IF you had ever planned to do so AT ALL?!!" John was shaking again. His fingers jittering uncontrollably and Sherlock's eyes strayed a half tick away from where they were transfixed by John's own - to look in horror as they twitched ... again ... twitch ...   A telltale sign that John had been broken further than Sherlock had previously mended him.

He had just turned to walk out of the bustling hubbub of the entry hall, when his name was called. "Dr. Watson?" a lad was signaling for him to follow into the crowded dining room, and John just couldn't make himself change his plans. He feared what he would do tonight if left alone.
John couldn’t look at Sherlock, he left his head buried in the other’s shoulder and tried to keep his toner neutral. He failed of course. “Sherlock, I… I lost you once before and it… It was by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I didn’t know what to do with myself. With you gone I… I couldn’t deal with that again. You are more than just my friend or flatmate… You are my other half. You make me, well, me. Without you I go from being John Watson to nothing. I need you. I lo-...” John trailed off, his heart stuttering in his chest. Clearing his throat, he sat back and removed his hands from Sherlock, they felt instantly cold but he ignored it and pulled out his phone, “I’ll go out and call Lestrade. You should probably go get dressed before they show up” he said, head down as he stood and went out of the flat to make the call.
“I’m fine, wait til you see the other guy” he said with a small laugh before getting more serious, “You should go check on Sherlock, I couldn’t get to him quick enough, he got...drugged”  he mumbled, eyes low.
While the detective had drifted into his own head, John had watched in amusement as his usual expression changed and morphed with his train of thought. It happened from time to time, Sherlock would fall into his mind and John would watch in awe as his face changed with each new thought he went through as if having a conversation with himself but his lips would remain closed. “Oh nothing, you just look interesting when you think.” he said, smiling up at the other man, “What were you thinking about anyway?”

“Whoa whoa slow down Sherlock” John said quickly, taking hold of the other’s hand once more.  “There’s no race ok?” he assured. Seeing the confusion dawn in those beautiful eyes, John decided words wouldn’t be good enough. Despite his desire to plow Sherlock’s fine arse on every surface of the flat, he didn’t want things to just be purely based on lust like that. Deciding that actions would be more appropriate than words, John moved his free hand to Sherlock’s shoulder and guided him backwards until the detective had his back against the wall. Raising himself to his tiptoes, John closed his eyes and pressed a kiss to those cupid-bow lips, humming a little at the contact. One thing was certain, if they were going to do anything, they were going to do it right.
It wasn’t clear when Sherlock had fallen asleep, one minute he was laying down and the next he was being woken by a nudge in his side and John’s voice by his ear. At first he merely stirred, however the events of the day sprung back to mind and he startled out of the bed in a manner that would suggest he had been electrocuted. Stumbling, he fell haphazardly to the floor and sat their in a daze for a moment. He looked up at the bed and saw John laugh, shaking his head. He wanted to say something, to leave… to stay. He wanted to do something, anything. But all he could do was sit there and stare up at John wordlessly.
It was strange, John looked different but for the life of him, Sherlock simply could not put his finger on how. It was something to do with the other’s expression and the way he had been looking at Sherlock lately. He had noticed it before but it seemed to be far more frequent as of late. Ignoring it for the moment, he smiled at John, “I’d like to stay with you, it was rather comfortable and I wouldn’t want to be alone again really… at least until that man is apprehended.” he admitted. It was true, Sherlock couldn’t bare the thought of sleeping alone before and that hadn’t really changed. He couldn’t believe how easy it had been for him to be tired and put in such a vulnerable position and frankly, he didn’t want to experience that again so soon. In a way, he knew at least if he slept beside John, he would be protected. John always protected him, no matter what the cost. Sometimes he wanted to tell the doctor to think of himself for a change but by now he knew that wouldn’t happen. Since they had met til now, John had put his own life on the line countless times in order to keep Sherlock safe and he knew that he would never quite be able to return the favour. At the end of the day, most of the time they are put in life or death situations is down to the cases they are on at the time and indirectly down to Sherlock getting involved in them. Guilt started to pool in his stomach and he tried to focus on John instead who was now staring at him with doe-like eyes.
“I… he… I think he needs some space” Sherlock stammered, still staring dumbfounded at the place that John had been standing.
Sherlock shuddered as he felt John lick at his neck, the cool trail left behind making him shiver slightly. It was so hot in the room, well, he thought it was at the very least. “I… you… nevermind” he stammered. Stammering, that was a new one. John has managed to reduce him to this after some simple kissing?
John shook his head and got comfortable, “Ah it’s alright” he said, smiling over at Sherlock before realizing how suddenly solem and… afraid the detective suddenly seemed. “Sherlock? What’s wrong?” he asked, immediately filled with concern. The other night Sherlock had been curled to his side like a cat whereas right now, he was lying flat and still on his back. It was slightly eerie and if John couldn’t see his breathing, he would have assumed a wizard had petrified him in that position or something. He got no response and shifted over, putting a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and taking note of how smooth and cool the skin there was, “Sherlock?” he tried, shaking the other’s shoulder just a bit and frowning when the other tensed up, “What’s going on? It’s just me…”
“You’d think that man runs on air, honestly. I’m glad he has a good man like you looking after him, anyway, I won’t keep you, just wanted to check in. Ta ta” she said before disappearing back out of the flat.
When Sherlock bolted, John felt disappointed but what more had he expected? This was Sherlock, if he spooked him, the man would run without a doubt. Relationships were not his area and this would have to be approached logically, not romantically. Straightening himself out, John followed at a distance and stood back as Sherlock worked things out with the police before gesturing that they could leave. As they clambered into another cab, John reached over and laid his hand over Sherlock’s gently, “You were pretty damn amazing today” he commented, “That Russian sure had a flare for the dramatic didn’t he? Too bad you were on the case, no one else would have noticed” He watched as Sherlock looked at their hands and back to john with a small smile, a grateful smile if anything. John knew he would feel bad for running, but he wasn’t about to let that happen. “How about we stick on some crap telly tonight? I think we could do with the break.”
“Oi you berk! I was just doing something nice. I won’t bother in future if it bothers you so much” the blonde quipped, backing off a step or two and clasping his hands behind his back.
Inside, Sherlock had tidied himself up and put on some clothes before coming down to find the living room already swarming with police. Normally this would make him uneasy as it usually meant he was being busted for an illegal substance but today he was actually relieved as he watched the beaten up assailant being dragged away mercilessly. Looking over to Lestrade, Sherlock couldn’t help but smile a little and headed over, “About time” he jested, “If it weren’t for John I would probably be causing you hassle by being locked up in an unknown location somewhere. You really need to up your detective skills”
Heading down to Sherlock’s room, John began to feel his nerves drift away and excitement took their place. This was an opportunity he was highly unlikely to get again, the opportunity to be close to Sherlock and show him how he honestly felt but in subtle ways. Some might call it taking advantage of a situation but the detective did that all the time. Now it was John’s turn. Of course it wasn’t something he was doing with malicious intent, far from it. Looking at it realistically, he just wanted to show Sherlock quite how much he is loved. When John saw Sherlock’s shock at him giving up his possessions in exchange for his life, he wanted nothing more than to tell the detective then and there that he meant the world to him. They were best friends, partners, flatmates… He had become quite taken with the brunette in recent years as well… How could Sherlock not see the obvious? Then again, it was hardly a surprise, Sherlock Holmes could read an entire life story from the condition of a jumper yet he could never tell when someone cared for him. Sighing, John headed into the room and was greeted by the rather appealing sight of a shirtless Sherlock half covered by what seemed to be a thin silk sheet, “I hope you are wearing pants under there” he teased, although there was a slight question to the comment. Sherlock was hardly known for being the most modest man on the planet and it would hardly surprise John if the other did turn out to be entirely naked although it might make sleeping beside him much more difficult than it was already going to be. He would have heard Sherlock’s eyeroll a mile away and couldn’t help but chuckle as he slid in beside.him. He almost went to cuddle up to him on instinct but managed to stop himself, unsure as to whether or not that would be welcomed. Last night seemed like a more intimate occasion, what with the near death experience and all, tonight seemed more casual.
“I’m fine, just lost my bearings for a moment” he explained, “I’m starving, I hope Angelo is ready for us tonight, I might eat half of his stock” he said with a small chuckle. “I hope you are going to eat with me for a change, make me look a little less like a total pig?”
“Because I love you… I always have. And with the way I look at things, your own happiness pales in comparison to that of the person you love.” John said without missing a beat. It was true, at least for him. If you love someone then your own happiness can be fulfilled quite well by witnessing the happiness of the other.
When Sherlock turned away, John was confused. However, as the sunlight came to rest on the pale skin of Sherlock’s back, the marks there seemed to shine. He knew they were there, of course he did, he had felt them. What he hadn’t felt was quite how many there were, marks were scattered across that pale porcelain skin in an unruly pattern like chicken scratch. The shock wore away quickly, no anger brewed at the people who had done this as one may expect, no sadness for the suffering the other had been through. Instead, a pain swelled in John’s chest when he realized that Sherlock had dealt with all of this for him… to save him from Moriarty. His heart was nearly still in his chest as he shifted to his knees and rested his forehead on the place between Sherlock’s scarred shoulder blades. Without hesitation, John pressed a kiss to the scar nearest his lips and could do nothing other than whisper against the mark there, “You’re as beautiful as you always have been”.
Sherlock was left rather stunned in his chair, one minute John had been sat calmly in front of him eating breakfast and the next he had bolted like a startled rabbit. That was wildly uncharacteristic of him… While he had been analysing the doctor, Sherlock had noticed that the other had become drastically uncomfortable and began subconsciously shifting in his seat. On top of that he had been licking his lips and swallowing a swell, signs of stress. Odd. John never usually got stressed when he looked at him. What had changed? Before he could consider it, he saw John rush past the kitchen and out of the front door without so much as a word. Frowning, Sherlock focused on eating the remainder of his food but he had somewhat lost his appetite. He decided to be helpful for a change and cleaned up the plates as he tried to understand what could possibly have made John behave in such a way but to no avail. Sighing he went to lay on the sofa, wet hair soaking into the cushions. He was about to head into his mind palace when the front door clicked open, John must have forgotten something in his hurry. The floor creaked slowly and it unsettled Sherlock, John was in a rush to leave so why on earth would he creep into the flat so slowly? He wouldn’t... Opening his eyes, the detective felt his blood run cold at the familiar masked figure before him and went to move when a syringe was brought down to his neck and the world blurred out before fading to black.
“John! John for the love of -... oh … you’re awake. Are you alright?” the detective seemed distressed and John realized he was laying there with Sherlock wrapped in his arms. Groaning, John sat them up and winced as the pain shot up his back. Usually when he fell he would always go to the side to reduce injury but this time he had to protect Sherlock and he was gonna pay for it apparently.
Sherlock listened to John patiently, watching is expression and posture, searching deeply for any hint of a lie or an exaggeration but to his surprise he found none. He knew he shouldn't be surprised really, this was John after all, but he couldn’t help himself. This seemed like such an unlikely situation for him to ever end up in, let alone with John. He considered each and every thing John had said before he spoke, squeezing John’s hand in a gently manner, “I don’t know how to deal with emotional dilemmas John, you… you understand this. But… I have noticed developments in my connection with you over time, things that I can’t quite explain. I was hoping… considering this revelation that perhaps you could show me how I could love you in return. I think I do… I just don’t know the most appropriate way to show you” he explained, trying his best to choose words carefully.
Rolling his eyes, Greg gave Sherlock a playful punch on the arm, “Oi! It’s not my fault you attract lunatics on a daily basis. Most people can go their whole lives without being kidnapped and drugged but you can’t go two minutes without agitating every criminal in London.” he said with a smile, “Glad you’re alright though. I think you should go talk to John… he’s really beating himself up”
John thought back on it and remembered, rolling his eyes, “It’s not that bad I’m sure.” However when he thought on it, they guy had gotten a pretty good swing in. When they had been searching the location, Sherlock had spotted a number of clues that had lead them to where they were now. On their search, the gang had ambushed them, granted there were only four of them at the time but they certainly got a good few hits in before they were subdued by police and Sherlock had taken off again. John had taken it upon himself to get the burly bloke off of Sherlock but had gotten a blow across the face for his troubles, at the time he hadn’t paid much mind to it, now however the area was warm and throbbing slightly, not that it mattered to him now. Right now, at this moment, only one thing mattered,  “Sherlock?”
Blink. Blink. Blink. Sherlock brought himself back from his mind palace and was surprised to see John still standing there, watching him with an expression he had never seen before. Usually John watched him with awe, indifference, anger or even on a more regular basis he would get shy when caught watching but this time it was different. John stood straight and firm, despite the slight tremor in his hand. He had a smile on his face but it was small and a little wary, like he was trying to hold a brave expression despite the fact that underneath he was clearly panicking just a little. It was only natural really, if there was one thing John had taught him over the years, it was that high emotions and revelations can make a person feel incredibly vulnerable. And here was John, standing before him, vulnerable. It was honestly a new experience, the doctor was usually so strong in his character, however it was seeing him like this that seemed to round him out just a little. Over the past few days John had shown so many things; bravery, loyalty, defensiveness, selflessness, care, kindness, observancy, anger, sadness, love… Now there was determination, tinted with fear of rejection and in a way it tugged at something inside of Sherlock’s chest. He took a step closer to John so that they were mere inches apart and looked into those dark blue eyes as he asked simply, “How could you love a man like me?”
“Oh you know dear, same thing different day. How are you? I see you’ve made quite the breakfast” she commented, smiling away as she always did.
Without a word, John shook his head and bent down, the next thing he knew, his lips were pressed against Sherlock’s in a firm manner, his mind not even bothering to  catch up with the situation. There was no embarrassment, no shyness, no excessive beating of the heart. No, none of that. There was only certainty. The kiss was brief, a few seconds at most before he pulled back, “Do you have a death wish or something, Sherlock Holmes? Because I don’t think I can constantly keep coming so close to lose the man I love again…” he said fondly, averting his gaze and clearing his throat before pulling himself to his feet and holding out a hand for the man who was staring up at him from the floor, clearly shocked.
When Sherlock sat on the floor looking like a puppy ready to be scolded, John sighed, “C’mon Sherlock, ‘m tired… get those clothes of and get into bed” he murmured, lifting the blankets and gesturing for Sherlock to get in.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re s…. “ Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly and he searched his head for any word ending in ‘S’ to try and cover the tracks of his original response. ‘Sandwiches? No. Sister? Hell no. Soft jumpers? No. Scar? Bad topic’ he sighed, “Your smile” he admitted after his mind failed to give him a decent alternate word. Going quiet, Sherlock closed his eyes, not to keen on finding out what John’s response would be to such a revelation. No it wasn’t anything sordid or personal but it was certainly something he would find strange and Sherlock really didn’t want to have to answer any questions about his fascination.
Looking up, Sherlock smiled a little, “Not at all. Did you sleep well?” he asked, bringing a hand up and resting it on John’s chest.
Thank you for reading :3
“I don’t think I would disagree to that” Sherlock said with a bit of a blush, “Unless there is a case at which point you understan-...” he was cut off by John’s lips against his own.
I’ve been a bit busy but here’s another chapter. Thank you for reading and sticking with the story!
Due to such a great response from the first chapter I was very enthusiastic to get out the second installment. There will be progression as things move forward but I'm aiming for a bit of a slow burn so I hope you enjoy the ride.
“Not at all.” John assured him, “”I was wondering, it’s getting late and I fancy getting some sleep tonight, would you like to sleep in my room?” He offered, it was a shot in the dark but this evening had been rather wonderful and he didn’t really like the idea of losing the contact with his lover.
John was more than a little surprised at that but he could see Sherlock was resigning in to himself and that was the last thing he wanted to see, “Hey, don’t do that” John said softly, reaching up and cupping Sherlock’s cheek without a thought. He watched the other man’s eyes shoot open and his lips parted as though he was about to speak but no sound came out. For a moment, John had no clue what was going on but the room was silent and the air grew thick and warm. Moments passed as they watched each other and soon enough, John moved his hand away and cleared his throat. “How about I go make us some breakfast, you haven’t eaten in days” he suggested, sitting up and shifting to the edge of the bed.
Frustrated, Sherlock let out a huff and walked over to his sofa, falling onto it and resting back with closed eyes, “Fine, it’s not as though it matters anyway. I don’t see why I should care, it’s just John anyway”  Some people used a phrase relating to the idea of putting a foot in one’s own mouth, this  wasn’t a saying Sherlock really paid any mind to… until that moment. A short choked sound came from the doorway and Sherlock turned to look, he wished he hadn’t. John was stood there, eyes widened with shock and hurt, is mouth still parted from the sound he had made and his entire body frozen in place. For once, Sherlock wished more than anything that John would make one of his usual joking remarks like ‘piss of you wanker’ or something along those lines… that didn’t come. He would even accept anger, aggression, anything… No… that didn’t come either. What came, was silence and to his genuine surprise, a tear rolling down John’s slightly bruised face. Sherlock knew he should speak, backtrack, apologize, something! But nothing came out. Before anyone said a single word, John steeled his expression and turned on his heel, marching out of the flat.
“You don’t have to do anything, that’s the good part.” John whispered. Leaning down, John pressed his lips lightly to Sherlock’s, it was nothing but a brief peck to begin with, but slowly, John deepened the kiss. Using one hand to balance himself on the mattress and the other to cup Sherlock’s cheek, John hummed and using his tongue, parted Sherlock’s soft lips and began to carefully explore. It didn’t take long for things  to pick up, Sherlock was a little hesitant to start with but soon enough John noticed him becoming far more receptive and responsive. He found himself smiling into the kiss when he felt the detective reach up and cup his cheek, the other hand moving up to grip the back of his hair.
“I haven’t eaten in four days so yes I will be joining you. You don’t eat like a pig John… more like a dog if anything. Pigs scarf their food down no matter what it is and they make a royal mess of it all. Dogs are far more refined in how they eat, they will eat what they need and finish every scrap.” Normally this type of comment would have made people look at Sherlock with sheer disgust or they would be affronted. He was pleasantly surprised however to find John was laughing, crinkles forming beside his eyes and a smile on his lips. He did love to see John laugh, it was a rare occurrence with all that had happened in his life especially as of late. With Mary out of the picture along with little Rosie, John had become withdrawn for months, only recently had he begun to come back to his usual self. For a while, Sherlock had to admit, he had become rather concerned for John’s mental health, keeping a close eye on him and even asking a few others to do the same when he was not around. He knew that John would find that more than a bit not good if he ever found out but Sherlock was confident that situaution wouldn’t arise. Focusing on John’s facial expression, Sherlock began to smile too, he usually did whenever he saw that curl on the edge of the other’s lips.
Sherlock looked John over for a moment, just standing still under his touch for a moment before backing away and feeling John’s hand slide off of him in the process, “I don’t need to talk about it, so do me a favour and let me work” he snapped a little more harshly than he had intended. Part of him wanted to apologize but he  knew that he realistically needed to do this. There was no point in telling John what was going on in his head was there? What would the other man think if he turned around and told him ‘Oh by the way, I have developed more of an interest in you but I have no idea how to date and would need you to teach me’? Considering John was straight that probably wouldn’t go down to well. Before he could compose himself completely, he realized John had stepped forward and pulled him into a hug.
Relief washed over John and he carefully pulled Sherlock into a hug, “I know it’s not your area but I’ll show you how things usually go alright? We can work on this together and whatever you want to do or give, I’ll be happy with so please just promise me right now, you won’t force yourself to do anything you don’t want to?”
“Yes he does. I suppose I am grateful for getting him off of that other crime… If he had gone down for it, we would be eating at home a lot more often.” Sherlock stretched upwards and yawned. “For once I’m tired for two nights in a row, I think I have been cursed” he murmured, looking about and hailing another cab in a matter of seconds yet again.
An almost immediate bump in the non-conventional relationship but what were they to expect? John’s short tempter and Sherlock’s inability to understand social norms was bound to cause some trouble right?
As Sherlock curled into him, John smiled and wrapped his arms around the detecting, pressing a kiss to the younger man’s forehead. “I overreacted today, I’m sorry love. G’night” he murmured, sleep creeping in and causing John to begin lightly snoring within seconds of his sentence.
Sherlock hadn’t expected John to tip over the edge so quickly but at the end of the day he knew the other man had been holding pent up sexual frustration for some time so it was understandable. “You’re welcome” He said with a smile, looking over John’s features and cataloguing every new detail there. His cheeks were tinted pink, his were eyes dilated wide, his lips curled up in a blissful smile of his own. It was something quite extraordinary to be honest. In the past, when people had finished they rarely showed any sign of outward pleasure. A grunt, a groan and a smirk was the usual standard of what the detective had seen in his youth. This blatant joy and emotion was something so new but there was one thing he knew, he actually liked it. “Should we go to the cafe for breakfast? I’m… well I’m hungry” he admitted, realizing that was a  statement he hadn’t expected to come from him.
At that, Sherlock sighed and shook his head. Without a word, he swooped out of the flat, not even bothering to pick up his coat or scarf as he tried to calculate the probability of where John may have gone in such a state. It didn’t take long for him to figure it out. Despite the doctor’s severe distaste for alcohol and alcoholics in general, one thing Sherlock knew was that in times of stress or upset, John usually found himself at the pub attempting to drown it all out. A foolish method by far but it was one that many people used on a regular basis. With haste, Sherlock raced down the roads, he had no idea at this point as to what he was going to say to his friend but he couldn’t leave things this way. Considering the length of his strides, Sherlock reached the pub not long after John and even managed to get inside and spot the man before he had been capable of ordering his first pint. “John!” he called out, rushing to his blogger's side but leaving a reasonable distance in case he had to dodge a swing. “John I… what you heard I… I didn’t mean…”
Smiling at the clearly overwhelmed detective, John simply took Sherlock’s hand, upturned his own wrist and rested the detective’s fingertips on it. He then looked up at the man, his expression unguarded, honest and open. All these years he had sat back and never once let the man know how he felt. Enough was enough. There was no way he was going to risk losing him again without at least letting him know that no matter what he does, he is loved. “I don’t expect anything to come of this Sherlock, know that. But I had to tell you. Forgive me”
"No, we're going home today and we will stay there, we will have the doctors come to our flat if we need."
Our little family of four had become a family of three, an equation that I couldn't comprehend, an equation I never thought possible when Sherlock and I brought two newborn little girls home to a blossoming Baker Street, reveling in this perfect world we had created.
"I feel much better, Papa! Daddy already checked me for a fever and I don't have one at all! And my legs don't hurt today, see?"
"What?"
The shadows of the two men and their little girls moved with each word and laugh, their voices and laughter filling 221B with a joy that its walls would rarely see again.
All three laughed and sat making small talk until Sherlock appeared in his classic Oxford and tailored slacks.
River nodded and looked down at her paper that was already covered with eraser marks and smudges of lead.
A girl with blonde ringlets down her back, wearing a white summer dress, was kicking pink cherry blossom petals under her feet when she saw a man in the distance, the sun setting behind him. She broke into a wide smile, her sweet dimples showing. She started running toward the man, arms outstretched.
Sherlock nodded silently, taking her and River's hand in his. They soon turned and went back up the hill to the car, leaving the willow branches waving, the yellow petals of the sunflower shifting in the wind, pieces of their hearts bleeding on the freshly fallen snow.
"You'll see us tomorrow!" River shouted happily.
"River, what are you thinking about? You can tell me, lovebug." I told her, bringing her closer to me.
"It will be the best Christmas then." He patted the girls on the head and they sang their goodbyes.
She continued, "Indie told me lots of times that she thought you were the best Daddy and Papa ever. When we saw shooting stars, Indie wished that everyone had a Daddy and a Papa just like you."
The doors were thrown open and a little fawn pug ran into the room, barking madly, charging towards us.
"My God, Sherlock you're freezing, did you walk all the way home in this rain?" John said, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's thin frame. "Sit down and I'll get you some blankets." He managed to maneuver Sherlock onto the cushions, pulling his jacket off and draping it over the bony shoulders.
“John, I need to come in” Sherlock called from the other side of the door.
“Well now… that is the question” the gunman said mockingly, “You and your little friend here got someone I know sent down for a long, long time. I’ve come for some… compensation. Valuables are preferred but… if you have nothing, the satisfaction of taking his life and yours will do just fine” he said flippantly, you could almost hear a smug smile forming under that damn skeleton mask.
When John stayed on one side of the bed Sherlock was a little confused, didn’t he say he was a cuddler? If that was the case, why was he leaving such a space between them? Perhaps he was uncomfortable or genuinely thought Sherlock was laying there half naked? Various thoughts began to swirl around the detective’s head but he tried his best to slow his mind down. The last thing he wanted was to get lost in thought and leave John in mid sentence or something like he did in the cab. “You don’t need to hang off the edge of the bed you know, there is more than enough room”
“Go on” Sherlock drawled in his usual toner, trying to appear uninterested.
John was still and thoughtful for a moment, but then he felt sick to his stomach. He had some across many sick people in the time he had been helping Sherlock on cases and he had seen a few people like this. That was the problem, people like this weren’t really people at all, they had no regard for human life and would do anything to reach their ends. It was people like this man that terrified John to no end because unlike the unhinged and clinically insane who go on sporadic rampages, these people were calm, collected and organised. That meant that unless John played this right, there was a high chance they were both going to get burned in this encounter. After what felt like an eternity, John nodded and stood slowly, hands raised in a non-threatening gesture, “Alright, alright, I have a few things you can have. I wouldn’t bother expecting anything off of him, unless you fancy a nice pair of dress shoes”  he sighed. Making sure to keep his movements slow and non-threatening, John opened the side table by his bed and rummaged through a few things. His gun was sat there but he knew without a doubt if he drew it, Sherlock would be killed in an instant and that was not going to happen as long as he could prevent it. Keeping himself collected, John pulled out a box which contained a pristine watch, a limited edition rolex that was handed down to him from his grandfather. It was in mint condition and he knew the gunman would have no quarrel in taking it as a prize. Despite his reluctance to part with the item, John placed it on the table. At the end of the day he knew a watch was nothing in comparison to the life of his best friend. As he rummaged, a few items came to the table; silver cufflinks, his phone, a few jewelry items he had received as gifts… All in all there was a at least a grands worth of items. He pulled his laptop in as the robber could clearly see it on the side, then he sighed and stepped back, “That’s all of it” he said, facing the man and standing firm, “Take it and go already”
Things are going to get a little more emotional soon, chapters will get longer once we get past these baby steps at the beginning.
John I need you. -SH
The sensations running through Sherlock’s mind and body alike were explosive to say the least, he had never felt anything like this in all of the years he had walked thought this dull plain of existence. Normally the world was full of constant prattle supplied by idiots that were inefficient, lazy and self destructive, not to mention stupid on the best of days. It was maddening. Normally Sherlock found his mind wandering in a million different directions and wielding no results or excitement, now however was a different story. Now, Sherlock was here on John’s lap and all of the world had faded away, it was him and his blogger, things had never felt so perfect. Before his mind dared to wander off again, Sherlock decided to lock it in place and focused back on John’s warm body below him, his lips pressed against his own and the feeling of those strong arms looking him in place, it was enough to draw a variety of small involuntary sounds from his throat. Despite his best efforts, a blush rose on his cheeks and he felt himself get embarrassed for a moment but that quickly faded when he pulled back just a little bit to see the flush on his blogger’s own face. John looked gorgeous to say the least, his lips tinted red from the action, his pupils blown wide, the look on his face in general… a look that made Sherlock feel he was about to be eaten alive. “John…” he breathed, stunned by the sight of his usually composed and neat companion.
While John worked away in the living room, Sherlock found that he couldn’t help but watch him from the corner of his eye. The doctor had always managed to intrigue him somehow from the day they met but after the incident in the early hours, John had absolutely astounded and confused him. While being bound and held at the mercy of the gunman, Sherlock had felt his mind and body freeze as he came to the realization that he had no chance to get out of it. Standing in the other man’s room, he had watched in amazement as John had calmly handled the situation, giving up his own possessions… John had always put his safety above anything else, it was part and parcel with regards to his personality and military background after all. The thing is, recently, Sherlock had been noticing more and more often how John had been taking care of him more around the house and even on cases. At first, he had found the behaviour slightly irritating and he almost scolded the other but by this point it had become something he almost liked. While watching John work, Sherlock soon found himself smiling a little but then John looked up and his heart stuttered in his chest as he spun away, pretending to be working on something elsewhere in the kitchen. A blush came up on his cheeks and he felt embarrassed at being caught just watching his friend but hoped John wouldn’t think anything of it. Why would he anyway?
John may not be the most observant of people... but neither is Sherlock
You didn’t need to have the skills of deduction to deduce a man like John Watson, in the nicest of ways he was quite a simple person and he wasn’t very skilled at hiding his insecurities. Sherlock had spotted several on the very first day they met. One being the way John stood didn’t only indicate his participation in the war but a determination to not be looked down on for his injuries. He was hurt both physically and mentally, most people would accept that sort of thing but not John. He didn’t want to be pitied despite the fact he was utterly ashamed of himself. Sherlock hated it. He hated how John always looked down on himself, how he always saw himself as second best, how he always hid from the world even when he stood in plain sight. It had been obvious that John wore baggy t-shirts, oversized suits and large jumpers in order to cover up his body from prying eyes over the years. He even wore them on dates… Sherlock had always wanted to turn around and call him out, tell him he shouldn’t hide and that if anyone dared to judge him that he could do better, but he held his tongue. Now however, he couldn’t. John was hiding, he was hiding from him… That wouldn’t do. Reaching forward, Sherlock rested his hand lightly on the slightly raised mark on John’s shoulder and looked up so that he could meet the now trembling man’s eyes, “John… you don’t have to hide from me, you know that right?” he asked gently, trying his best to keep his usual baritone low and soft so as not to startle him. He felt the way John tensed under his touch but under that he felt the beat of his heart as it picked up under his skin. Fear? Discomfort? Then he noticed it, the way John’s eyes became unfocused and his breathing changed and caught a little in his throat. Using his free hand, Sherlock copied John’s gesture from earlier, cupping the man’s cheek and allowing their eyes to meet, “John… “ he breathed.
Object lessons on how to transform a life.
“Aren’t we lucky, darling?”
John heard the fast light footsteps on the stairs just as the door was thrown open.
“I’m fine, Mrs. Hudson,” he tried, but it came out as, “I ...mhhu ..!” as he realized he really … could not, in fact, speak. She came over to him, despite his protests, and his hand now covering his face as he crumpled. His gruff façade broken. And he shook with it. The tears, no less real than the memory. The dream, no less real than the grave he had regularly visited. She was holding him. Rocking him back and forth as she tutted and soothed. “There there, I’ve got you,” she said, as she patted his back like a mother.
"Why?" John asked then.

His voice rang out through the empty hall.

His unspoken message stated clearly to Sherlocks ears. And Sherlock felt his heart breaking.
Every second of further contact making him realize he wanted to -
The cabbie watched him carefully from the rear-view mirror as they pulled up to the curb, and he made ready to alight. He didn't care. He was thrilled that he had been right!

He almost wished he hadn’t found the charger here. Had an excuse to continue walking around in the shops just to keep talking! Once he charges his phone, he goes back to his hotel - alone, right? How does he even begin to ask someone like that up?
Sherlock recognized that look on his face.
“I met someone,” John admitted, “He’s brilliant. And funny. And … solves mysteries?” Like he couldn’t believe it himself.
The soft yellow glow of the lights in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen touched John’s hair, and made it seem more golden. The blue in his eyes glinted like steel, color heightened by the contrast.

A smile had changed his routine frown;

The man stepped a bit closer to John. A reassuring movement. As if joining John’s side against this imposter sitting across from them and said,

John's jaw dropped and so did his fork. He closed his eyes. Wishing Sherlock away. Something about respect to the dead playing in an endless loop in his mind.
He took a breath. “Why did you say
“Why not just say it, John?” Sherlock’s eyes were soft with kindness. His hand cupping John’s face, as he kept himself propped up, hovering over John like a guardian angel.

He looked on the verge of tears. A state Mrs. Hudson had not seen him in ... since ... well, since he was a much,
John had to chuckle at that.

He found his nerve just as the message beeped to signal recording:

John noted that Sherlock's brilliant eyes were blue ... and grey ... and green. Like the sea.

And then ...

In, between breaths, his and John’s. Measuring with every sensory receptor he could stretch to touch and feel and see and smell and hear - just what John’s responses were. How his eye color and iris dilation changed and deepened; the quick catch of breath, the swift rush of pulse, the heightened vibration as if geared to shift at a moment's notice; the heady scent of his sweat and aftershave; the twitch of his hands; fingers furling and unfurling as if they wanted to be put to use …
It was one thing to indulge in the
"And run a busy kitchen?" John could not believe his ears!!
The little chinese cafe … the takeaway and telly … the Baskerville inn … the chrome diner …
He needed to release some of this tension in his fingers. In his toes.
As the pieces fell back into place, John's world came in around his ears.
That Sherlock
You and I will
Sherlock's face held the blank expression of a man in shock.
The mirth still there, but something deeper crawling in, and wanting to be spoken …
Sherlock realized, as he slipped out of the layers he had been sheathed in. The carefully constructed layers of his façade.

He looked up at the windows. The same lace curtains hanging there.
She smelled the air, covering her eyes dramatically with a hand, before pronouncing -
His feet had taken him, once again, to Sherlock's graveside.
There were candles. Glowing.
John often smiled at the incredulous responses it engendered from those they met. He was cocky with it. Here he was, a normal boy-next-door, running around with the most brilliant (and to be honest, the most stunningly beautiful) man in London. Him. Plain jane. Army boy. Boring doctor. John Hamish Watson. He couldn't believe his luck. He couldn't believe this was happening. To him.
Probably a personal tailor …
John felt his waistband tighten with the swell of happy belly and sated monsters all the way around ...
"And you came, here?" Sherlock was pursing his lips, holding back a mounting grin that John felt terribly endearing …
Sherlock looked up then. Saw John's face, and relaxed. "You think so?"

Sherlock’s eyes closed for the first time then. John kissing every corner of his mouth. John sucking at his top lip. Nipping a little at his plump lower lip as he went. His tongue teasing Sherlock into a moan. Sharp cheekbones in shadow as he went digging his fingers into Sherlock’s curls, further exploring his mouth … his hips moving beneath him.
If that makes sense?”
"What?" John inquired, "Not listening to you?"

John looked affronted, “No, I’m not!” He was concentrating so hard on the letters, and carefully writing each one down.
He paused a moment -

They were standing in Regent’s Park.
Straight down.
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement, "had some help with that. In getting up to speed." He also took a sip of his water, "Mr. Ramsey's services were engaged by Mycroft.” Sherlock continued, oblivious to John’s jaw dropping, “under a suitable cover of course ... "
