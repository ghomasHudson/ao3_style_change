“Is… is it not good?” John asked, his smile gone now, replaced with uncertainty and a loss of confidence.
“Yeah,” Greg replied with his own smile, a sad, downtrodden smile. “I suppose sex isn’t everything so... it doesn’t
“...What... what about it?” John asked, not being able to see anything wrong with how it seemed from his point of view. He shifted, tugged at them nervously, and pulled one half of his robe over. “I don't understand! What's
romantic.”
“...Yes,” Sherlock breathed, feeling stupider by the second. Why did he even ask? Of course the dog didn’t know what was happening.

“Yes. I’m sure Orion would love to
“Good. Perfect.
It took an hour, or just about, for John to feel, to know, that he could now do and give more, and he slipped the fingers of his free hand through the fuzzy soft curls, playing with them the way he liked, then continuing his light touch across and down his chest to pat where his heart beat, “I dislike this show,” Sherlock whispered in a rumble, despite his eyes being closed and lips limply parted as if in sleep.
Sherlock scowled, deflating and slumping back, disappointed, “
“Why? Do you know someone who might be
John trailed soft kisses between Sherlock's shoulder blades and began his familiar pattern on Sherlock's torso. They had developed it together after months of living together and dealing with Sherlock's black moods, through trial and error they had worked out a soothing dance of his hand that was perfect to Sherlock up. With a flat palm, John stroked from nipples to navel, circling gently as he kissed along the line of Sherlock's shoulders, giving the occasional surprising suck and lick before thumbing across Sherlock's now peaked, rosy nipples, watching as he jerked forward as though stung or shocked. It gave John a perverse kind of pleasure watching Sherlock slowly build towards arousal, watching the colour begin to darken across that normally perfectly pale skin as his hands worked, touching and calming and claiming all at once.

Sherlock looked up at John’s face, “I don’t know if…” he trailed off and blinked, not entirely sure what he was going to say, and instead just nodded, clicking his case closed. “Yes. Of course.”

“I don’t know,” John shrugged. “My dad named him, so it might have been, though I know Gladstone was the name of one of our Prime Ministers.”

“It was implied,” Sherlock retorted, though quickly glanced up, scrutinising John’s expression through his lashes. “At any rate, I...I...I shouldn’t have done it. It was a...a heat of the moment type of...of
! You
“Let’s try this, then,” John pulled him in for a chaste and light kiss. It was experimental kiss for John and Sherlock both, and John exhaled a shaky breath through his nose, kissing Sherlock again and running his fingers up into his hair. He gave in to the need to grip at the thick curls and increased the pressure of his lips against Sherlock’s, keeping his mouth closed until Sherlock shivered and clutched at John’s arm.
be able to function. - What is my life without you in it? A lonely GP with no real prospects of higher achievement.” His eyes watered and he looked away, focussing on the tree and the lights, at the science flask baubles. “It's like... you're the centre of my world and if you
“Yea, yeah, I know that. And I… I can do it, not justify it for others, but... but I... I...” John cleared his throat and finally putting down another card. "It's more... more to do with me.
At that moment Orion returned, bouncing up to rest his forepaws on their knees as he panted, the poodle having seemingly moved on with their owners. He looked between them with excitement and unbridled joy, shuffling closer until he could lick at their hands, clothes and their faces.
“Yes,” Sherlock rumbled, flexing his abdomen and shifting into a more comfortable position. All in an act to seem more confident than he was. John could tell that much from the lines of his shoulders and fidgeting hands. He was braced for mockery, it seemed, as he had been when John had first seen him whole and vulnerable.

Sherlock held the stick out spiritedly once he got it back, tugging when Orion snapped his jaws around it, testing the dog’s strength with a twisting swing to one side, bopping him on the nose when he barked, “We should stop off at a pet shop before we go home,” he said, chucking the stick again, aiming higher and longer.
“Browning nicely,” she replied as she settled once again. “So… you’re sitting
John gave Sherlock's neck a squeeze of support but as soon as the puppy twisted toward them he was taken, stepping forward and crouching down with wide arms and a wider smile, "Hey there buddy!" he called as the puppy excitedly bounded to him with happy yips and woofs, licking at John’s chin as the man laughed and rubbed at him. "It's good to see you too. What a good boy. What a

!” John exclaimed, “They have sharks right… or dolphins… I forget...” His mind trailed off suddenly and he found himself thinking about the time Sherlock had taken him to the aquarium. Had spent a full afternoon rambling and regaling John all about the dark side of dolphins, how they were actually quite sexually violent. To each other and to humans. “...and... uh... what was I saying?—

together, skin-to-skin, sweating and… and moaning and—”
John shot him a look, but Sherlock kept his gaze down, "Yeah. Yeah, alright, fine. - Well, if we're not going out, perhaps we should just get a takeaway and chill?”
“Nothing at all?” Sherlock pressed, feeling dizzy, stupidly hoping, foolishly wanting him to say something, anything, about the kiss, their friendship, their ‘them-ness.’
Mistletoe.
“What else is in this bank of yours?” Sherlock asked breezily as he reached to take hold of John’s aching erection, feeding it out through the underwear to bob in the space between them with a visible throb, and cupping the flushing tip, stroking the edges of flared, sensitive glans, taking them into his mouth with a clever, curling tongue.
' I want!”
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, finding the sudden subject change abrupt but needed. He gave a quick glance down at their lightly brushing knees and pushed their legs closer together, wanting their thighs to touch at the very least. Peering at John from the corner of his eyes he grinned, trying to distract as he inched nearer. “I’m not terribly fussy, you know that.”
, yes, well,
“Yeah?” Greg questioned with a stunned, pleased look, lips twisting up higher into a rather boyish smile.

much skin so suddenly,” he laughed, looking anywhere but at Sherlock, who gave a snarling smirk and bent his legs up in clear invitation, pillow already propping his hips. “You look, uh, healthy. Healthier than the last time I saw you naked. More meat on those bony limbs of yours.”

“One of your under shirts that I was going to put through the wash,” John replied. “It was one of your new ones, so I just bought another.”

John chuckled and pointed at one of the sheets near the top, “There. They called him Orion.”

"Uh huh," John hummed and threw the stick.
The lights from the Christmas tree were blanketing them both, were speckling the side of Sherlock’s face, chest, juddering stomach, and the long dribbling, swaying line of pre-ejaculate, in colour, “
"There are

“He...he does?” Sherlock blinked again, shivering from John’s subtle perfect affection. “Well...that’s...that’s...good…”
Sherlock huffed and nodded, giving him a sideways look, “Yes,” he answered shortly.
"I'm just saying it's... okay.
, you’re a right kinky sod, aren’t you? - Was it what John was doing or what he was saying?--”
“Yeah, I’ll sit,” Greg agreed, waving towards the bed and giving John a timid but reassuring nod as they disconnected their fingers and separated. John to the bottom of the bed, running his hands down Sherlock's legs as he went, and Greg to the edge, looming and regarding.
“I was…just trying to ease the tension,” John exclaimed uneasily, watching as Sherlock tilted his head appraisingly and then inched back to be close to John once more, chasing away the leaking chill that had taken his place. John clenched his jaw as the hard line of Sherlock’s penis was pushed into him again, bathing everywhere it touched with warmth, and was suddenly and utterly mortified when his own genitals stirred in interest.
... I, uh, I didn't want that represented on my
“That delightful gust of wind that blew most of the hail into my face a few minutes ago, was also nice enough to drench my thighs,” Sherlock said as he pushed up to crouch awkwardly astride John’s legs as John struggled to undo his jeans and peel them off. “My torso is fine, but my lower half is not. My feet are soaked, and my legs are just about drenched—”
control of your body,” he mumbled releasing both Sherlock’s mouth and John’s hand, then giving a testing, playful wink. Sherlock shot a small, soft, pleased smile in response, blushing. “
Sherlock peeked up at the side of John’s face and frowned, not certain it would be the case. He had thought John had been interested before, yet he had shot John down, chosen work then, over everything else, though he wasn’t entirely sure John had been asking at that time. Not because John wasn’t the type to do so, because he was, Sherlock had witnessed that on more than one occasion, but because of how John had acted and how inadequate Sherlock sometimes was with social cues. As instantly attractive and appealing as John had been to him in those first moments, he himself had thought it a passing fancy, just him finding a kindred spirit. Someone who he shared something with, someone who he wanted to share something with. Someone who might even put up with him and add something to his life, instead of taking away. Finally.
better, yes,” he mumbled, slumping in against him, nudging their noses together as he went for another kiss, then another, curling his long hand around the back of John’s neck as they got messier, wetter, hotter.

to believe that I 'fiddle,' especially as much as everyone claims,” John grumbled, putting the bundle of his work clothes down on the kitchen table and messing with the sash of his dressing gown. He could still stop this. Could still refuse and leave, and hide. Stay or leave. Show or hide. “I've

does everyone keep saying that?” John asked, throwing his arms in the air, which caused Sherlock's elf persona to wiggle. “Listen, my pants are
“I… I think I will,” John replied with a high level of certainty, giving it another look as Greg got comfortable, feeling a sympathy twinge in his own shaft. Had he put up with ignoring it so often that it barely registered? John felt infuriated and sorrowful at the thought. “I like Sherlock's, and I… I can make an expect assumption on what it might be like given the balance of your body. - Anyway, it’s not all about the look of your dick. That whole dominant thing you did really,

The smile on Sherlock’s face diminished, “Yes,” he said, knowing how cruel people could be to their pets. “He shan’t be lonely any more.”

“You did not remind… ”
“You came…” Sherlock said wonderingly.

The slipping of his wiggling forced John to change position, to push further in against Sherlock's trembling body, uncaring that he was naked and Sherlock was still fully clothed. It was his own bedroom and Sherlock had intruded so it was his own stupid fault. With his flaccid cock pushed into Sherlock's covered hip, John leered in close, incensed by Sherlock's sudden stammering, “Are you
.” He shot John a grin at the admittance and gave him a fond elbow nudge, pressing closer to sidestep a huddled group of passers-by. John breathed in the familiar bitter scent of cigarette smoke and tried not to let the disapproval show on his face. “Despite being reminded I’m a sad, lonely, troubled bastard, who hasn’t got the smarts to forget his cheating ex-wife, I did enjoy it. It was nice to see how marriages are supposed to be. So for that, I thank you.”

When he put the pen down Ryan took up all the sheets of paper and checked things on his computer before tearing a copy to the forms for John to fold away into his pockets, "Now that's all done I'll just fetch a few things and get Judith to bring Orion out." He picked up the phone, typing in a number. "If you'd like to take a seat?" John nodded and led Sherlock towards the chairs in the waiting room nearby.

"Why?"

“No you don’t.”
, like a private detective then?” Santa questioned, taking a sip of his own drink and getting frothy foam in his moustache, on his top lip, on the tip of his reddened nose as he peered at John beside him with friendly interest. “Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, or like that, uh, that one from Murder She Wrote?”
Greg groaned and turned on the light. “Go away,” he said, heading to the kitchen. “I’ve had a long day and I don’t want you ruining my moment of peace.”
! Its well documented. You might as well be friends with a slipper or… a piece of ham!”
this to work. I want us to try and keep this – whatever
John’s reaction to the sudden display was a mixed one. He was stunned, annoyed, jealous and turned on all at once, and he watched, agape, as Sherlock shifted to pull away after the initial push only to be stopped by Greg’s large insisting hand. It pushed down the hood of his duvet and carded through his messy curls, tightening and squeezing at the biggest waves to better adjust Sherlock’s head. John knew what the response would be seconds before it actually happened and he licked his lips, becoming hot with curling desire as Sherlock’s knees obligingly buckled.
! We... we all have to start somewhere--"

“I’m going to
“Please what, Sherlock?” Greg interrupted with a wicked gleam in his eyes while he regarded his own hand disentangle from John’s to flat out over Sherlock’s heaving stomach, gliding up to encircle his displayed, vulnerable, and ruddy neck. His thick fingers tensed, experimenting, and Sherlock sucked in a harsh, stuttering breath. John was enamoured. “What is it you need?”
"You'll see."
,” John murmured lowly, unable to really understand how she could have discovered this, how she sounded so sure of herself. Was the tension between them that palpable? “We're
“Well, he knows he has to go to the bathroom in the proper place and not all over the floor,” John told him, setting the timer on the microwave and leaning against the side as the custard rotated inside. “He knows the command ‘sit’ and ‘stop’, and… well, ‘fetch’. Not much else though I don’t think.”
than you already are.”
, and she is a
It didn’t take long for John to want more, to completely throw caution to the wind on whether or not it was a dream, and he sat up to grab and heave Sherlock up on the bed, throwing him down on his back. The look of surprise was a gorgeous sight to see, even in the low light, and John took a few seconds to reveal, to remember, before he pushed his hand down on the straining bulge of Sherlock’s erection. It pulsed under his palm and Sherlock gasped with a fringing whimper, arching his hips up an inch in a tensed buck, chest heaving and face reddened. He looked wanton and promiscuous and desirous, and he was shivering, fidgeting, blinking up at John with wide eager eyes. It was beautiful. It was his final undoing.

Sherlock eyed the collection, a mottled flush covering most of his body now, and hesitated, a tremor running through him, “Or… or what?” he asked, lifting his chin and licking his lips, giving John a searching, challenging look. "What if I don't want to do as you tell me? I... I only take my orders from competent, intimidating, controlled, disciplined, and... and..."

"We'll have to make sure we know who's feeding him then, or we might overdo it," he replied, tilting his head to the side as they leaned closer still.
Shrugging, Sherlock cocked his head, “The shouting, I probably deserve.”
“Mmhm, will do!” John called out, quickly pushing the underpants into his coat pocket and picking up his bag, keeping his eyes forward as he fled the clinic and was barely outside the doors before he heard the raucous laughter from within. He flinched and rolled his eyes. Just his luck. Had she shown it around first before she had wrapped it up, was that it? She was a menace!
John knew it was going to be a danger night hours before he received the text from Mycroft. He was becoming familiar to Sherlock's moods – they fluctuated wildly on a daily, sometimes hourly basis, but John followed them like a dog-eared and well-worn map. Knew when Sherlock was angry or frustrated, when he was happy and giddy with the flush of finishing an exciting case, full of morbidly delightful twists and turns, and sadly, he also knew when Sherlock was turning in on himself.
“Who says he can’t or
Sherlock released him with a timid sort of expression, “Indeed.”
, she’s not going to live here. She’s here until I can make other arrangements,” he muttered and turned his head to the turkey, leaning in to whisper to her whilst giving John a condescending smile. “Ignore him.
“Go on then…”
“Nothing.”
John just rolled his eyes with that fond smile and continued to massage his leg for a few moments more before trying to stand himself. He ended up leaning on his other leg while he shook the recovering one out though and used Sherlock as an aide. It felt good to be John’s support, as it always did, and he stroked a few fingers over his knuckles with fond contentment.
! Yeah. Explain those fancy silk dressing gowns, then?” Greg retorted around a short chuckle, sharing a glance with John. “How many does he have again? Three? Four?”
!" Sherlock snorted, face more red than pink now, and leaned into him, hiding into the crook of John’s neck.
“I’m always hungry for Mrs Hudson’s cooking -
“Ask him
...do that. What you wanted. What you said.
“...A...date?” Sherlock stared and tried to understand, light-headed. “The

"When I penetrated someone for the first time, I barely lasted more than a minute..."
?—Oh, so, what, you just sneak around in my room in the dead of night?” John glared. “Watching me sleep, me struggle, noticing the stale scent of sweat grow with every passing second, hearing every noise I make…” He paused and tilted his head, jaw cocked to one side, brow furrowing as he narrowed his eyes on Sherlock's shrinking figure. “Bad dreams only, I hope?”

the answers to what you’re saying. I don’t like answering stupid questions. I never have.”
As hoped, John returned the smile – this one his sleepy but satisfied and comfortable smile – and headed over to the kitchen, rubbing at his eyes as he prepared the mugs. And yes, there was the extra teaspoon of sugar, excellent. “Any plans for the day?”
start too—I eat just fine!”
“He wants to hear how desperate you are,” Greg ordered with a nod in John’s direction, calm, collected, and unexpectedly devilish. He leaned down to put his lips to Sherlock’s ear, the tip of his nose nuzzling at a small soft cluster of glossy coils, and eyes hooded, dark, and focused. John couldn’t believe it was the same man who had earlier been so unsure and befuddled. “He
of these should work,” he mumbled, frowning at the labels of each with a tilted head. “I don’t really think it matters which…”
, however it was still all very controlled. What I said, what I did, what I allowed to show. – Up to a point.”
John felt his heart throb in sympathy at Sherlock's overpowering sentiment. When this had first started, John had been thrown by the tears and the occasional sniffle while he'd touched him, but now he knew better. These unusual reactions, the needy touches, the staring teary eyes, the barely concealed whimpers, were simply Sherlock trying to control, to better understand the emotions flowing through him.
He inwardly groaned, he just wasn't sure. Wasn't sure what difference it would make either way.
“I never hear you complaining,” Sherlock sniped back with a peevish, smug, sneering sort of smile, his cheeks flushing a light pink. He was irate, not embarrassed. John knew most of the different kinds of blushes that decorated his cheeks now. Knew when they may appear and even how to attain some of them if he really wanted to. “In fact, I remember, quite distinctly, how much you

' so why not represent that on some pants? I thought it was ridiculous. Still do think so.”

John snorted, watching, and took a minute or two to get his strength back, then reached for and lifted Sherlock up so they could both fall onto their sides across the bed, looking at one another, “I feel like my body is made out of jelly,” he muttered.
John nodded and leaned back, patting Sherlock on the shoulder, "I'm going to wash and change, then we can both go down to Mrs Hudson. How does that sound?"
Laughing, Sherlock pushed closer, bathing in John’s affection, inhaling him deep, and closing his eyes, “Highly improbable then…”
. And look... look at me.” John always did that anyway. Never took his eyes from Sherlock for more than a few moments at a time. John knew Sherlock liked the eye contact as he was penetrated and stretched and worked open. It did something to him and in turn, did something to John too. "Look right at me.
“Bad luck is normally only for those who refuse a kiss,” Sherlock answered, eyes back on him, piercing into him, burning a mark wherever they shifted, digging deep into him and burrowing to his core. “

John pushed up onto his arms, "
John gave his torso a squeeze, “He will
idea,” Sherlock shot back sarcastically, head tilting as he absorbed John’s mannerisms and response. He replayed the look that had passed. He knew that look. Felt it twist his own face. Sherlock opened his mouth to comment, to bluntly state his deductions, but nothing came out and he swallowed, closing it again with a feeling of further affection for the man across from him. “I know, John. I’m not an idiot.”

for you,” Sherlock told him simply, bluntly, and grinned, a large, smug, rather flirtatious grin. A grin that faltered when John did nothing but gape at him, motionless, with his blood running hot and his cock twitching to life. “Don’t… you… don’t you want that? I thought—Is it the

The kettle clicked off and John finished making the teas, “I know you told me not to, but I got you something.”
“Kiss. Him,” John insisted, looking them between Sherlock and Greg as he worked his fingers faster. “He'll want it.”
“Let’s do them
“Merry Christmas, Mrs Hudson!” John called back to her and shut the door behind him, hefting their gifts as he followed behind Sherlock. A familiar, warm, welcome presence at his back.

“Um, Mrs Hudson?” John asked.

John tensed in exasperation, hunching his shoulders up and rolling his eyes, “
Sherlock closed his mouth with a snap, finding no deception, only exasperated determination, and returned his attention to the dog, to the papers, “You thought you would buy me a dog because I looked at puppies?” he enquired out loud.

John chuckled and followed Sherlock's lead, swinging the bag a little at his side, "You're going to get him to sleep with you, aren't you?"
The door opened so fast, so soon, that it startled them both back a step, “She’s a lot more than just simply
letter from a dog,” he said, waving it around and then glancing it over, “how am I to know what you actually did or didn’t do? And...and...what if…” He sighed and quickly cut himself off from that direction of thinking, not wanting to raise the subject of John perhaps leaving in the future, not after he’d just embarrassed himself moments before, not after having to continuously push the thoughts from his head. “So, he can be here...today? The dog? We’ll go get him? They are the plans of today you were so excited over.”
Sherlock gave a coy, sluggish nod, “Yes. I will be. I always am,” he replied with only the smallest of sullen and shy pouts on his face. They kissed again, twice more, then he slipped off John’s lap and stood beside the sofa, waiting until John joined him, with an arm around his waist again, before he made towards the bedroom. He felt warm and supple, leaning into every synced step so they bumped and touched and dragged against one another. Grounded with the familiar sensation.

has he said to you?”
It was ridiculous. Standing in their living room completely nude except for socks with the curtains still open and the door unlocked, but he couldn't care less. Nothing seemed to matter to him anymore, not during this, not when his mind had been conquered. He reached to help Sherlock take off his own trousers, salivating when his erect cock was revealed quickly, no underwear confining it, clinging to it, giving the freedom needed for it to jump out eagerly to meet him, red tipped, wet and pulsing with radiating heat.
“Mm...” John nodded slightly, giving a tight, unsure smile, not certain what he thought of it exactly. He couldn't keep his eyes from it, that was for sure. “It's

Sherlock clenched his toes to stop an intense shudder running through him and swallowed, glancing at the dog gifts, at the new socks, and then to the door towards the kitchen, “I...don’t
for me…”
Sherlock touched the top of John’s wrist to stop him after a time and turned his head, giving John a wet, vulnerable, pleading look under his floppy, mussed fringe. Taking the prompt, John guided Sherlock down across the bed, plumping the pillow under his head, and petted his white, marble hip as he discarded his own trousers. His socks went with them soon after. Sherlock preferred them to be fully naked with nothing at all separating them, liked seeing all of John, feeling all of John, so he could explore with gaze and crawling fingers whenever he deemed fit to do so. John didn’t mind. It was always warm and comfortable and luxurious in Sherlock’s bed, atop or under the sheets, and against his smooth, smooth body.

“You could have stood on a chair,” Sherlock replied and stretched up, fiddling with it and huffing when it took more than one second to get it securely hung.
Sherlock scoffed and loomed into his personal space, threw open John's coat, yanked his shirt from his trousers, and reached down to tug up a very worn looking waistband, “

Greg laughed through his nose and gave Sherlock’s slackening face a glance, captivated when Sherlock pushed his head into the firm dig of his knuckles with a very small, barely-there whine, “I doubt that you’re too soft, John. You can handle him better than anyone,” he said quietly, turning to suddenly take in the bedroom and then stand, strolling around to rummage through drawers. “Although…”
assumptions. You sigh and glare and stammer and--” Finally able to get the mistletoe, he added it to the rest of them and then moved away, starting to rummage around in drawers until he found some ribbon and began to tie it around the large clump. “
"Turn around, face the wall. Put your hands on it and spread your legs. I won't repeat myself a third time." John gave another smack of his hand in enjoyment and though he didn't look to see the skin in the semi-darkness of the room, he guessed it was a solid, throbbing red. His hand was starting to smart from the first impact. When there was still no movement, John hit him again, watched Sherlock's face contort with shocked and agonised pleasure, then took the upper hand and spun him around, kicking his legs apart and bending him at the waist until his cheek was against the cool wallpaper. "Always have to press your luck, don't you? Always have to misbehave. Always have to try my patience, twang at my last nerve!"
a coward… I just don't want to be pecked, thank you very much!” John exclaimed, but of course he let Sherlock take his hand, thrilled at the touch, in fact. Adored how Sherlock's long fingers wrapped around his wrist. “I swear, if I end up with a bloodied stump it'll be your fault.”
that was a thing.”
John's cheeks flushed as he realised exactly what was going on, "There isn't any paperwork, is there."
Sherlock didn't taste of much, a hint of their fabric softener and a touch of his own special scent combined with the musk of sweat, but it was the greatest aphrodisiac John had ever discovered, could ever need. Carefully hooking it with his tongue, John pulled Sherlock's into his mouth and gave it a light pressured suction, feeling the excess inches of his foreskin, the warmth of his flesh against the roof of his mouth. It was intoxicating to taste and feel.

“Good evening,” John said letting the lifted eyebrow arch. “Everything okay?”
John sighed and waved him closer, "
With hitching cry, Sherlock bowed his head forward, thrust his hips and erupted between them, catching John’s abdomen and arm, as well as splattering his own squirming torso, “Oh…

how perfect you are. How easy life is for you." Continuing to bite, lick and kiss his shoulders, John worked quickly but efficiently to get Sherlock ready for him. To stretch him open. "
can I have lots of custard?” John pursed his sublime lips as he put on a show of thinking about it, but then picked up the jug and poured custard all over Sherlock's dessert. Grinning widely, Sherlock took a chunk of brand butter to plop on top and then sat down to tuck into his dessert. “Finally.”

without preamble. Thinking she can just do what she likes,
Sherlock slowed to a pause and cupped John’s head in his hands carefully, caressing a sweep across each cheek, “I hope so,” he said quietly.
John nodded nervously and placed his next card down, not really paying attention, “Okay, I agree. Truth or forfeit.”
. Just one on
“You won’t,” John said cryptically, and pulled out an unassuming envelope from his dressing gown pocket, one which Sherlock had somehow overlooked, placing it between his fingers.
‘I always get so excited when John tells me about you though; about the exciting, brilliant man who has a big heart. I’m always going off and trying to discover new things, but when John finds me – and he always does – he keeps me with him with stories of you and your adventures and shows me pictures of you all the time.
John sighed as he pushed open the front door, almost falling bodily against as he did so and tripping up the step. He felt exhausted, mentally and physically drained from yet another day of seemingly endless dull patients and paperwork. Patients that he didn't really need to see and whom didn't really need to see him. Patients with colds. Lots and lots of patients with colds. A mild cold was not the flu, a cold was a cold. There was little to be done about it, little to give and prescribe beyond advising them to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and to gargle warm salt water. The common cold usually resolved itself in seven to ten days, with some symptoms remaining for up to three weeks. It wasn't worth visiting the local GP. Not at all. Pulling his keys from the lock and swaying up and in, John flinched when something touched the top of his head and reared back to look, terrified of what he might find, what Sherlock might have hung there, only find it to be a plant attached to the inside of the door frame, a rather familiar looking plant.
,” he muttered.
The smirk wobbled for a moment, almost disappearing entirely, before it contorted and Sherlock took the underwear in his fingers, staring at the image, at the cut-out placed photo of himself, “That’s my face…” he uttered. “
“I don't mind, Sherlock. I don't care that you won't be responding in kind,” John assured him, composing himself with a cough and an extending arch of his back. He turned away to gather his shoes, the most comfortable shoes he owned, the ones with most grip, and slipped them on, bending to tie them. “Tell you what – how about you let me watch Home Alone as a gift? No moaning or griping?”
and loud?” he murmured, glancing between them and then giving a breathy laugh. “It’s… quite something.”
"You haven't got the--"
Sherlock grunted in agreement and shrugged the heavy fabric off his shoulders before wrapping it around them both securely, his cold nose and forehead squashing up into the crook of John’s neck. John slipped his hands inside the coat to encircle Sherlock’s warm and dry waist, sighing in relief when his chilly fingers tingled from the pleasurable heat radiating off Sherlock’s torso. Sherlock shifted a moment, seemingly uneasy, before huffing in resignation and shuffling closer; so close, in fact, that they were suddenly touching from chest to pelvis. John blinked rapidly with a surge of embarrassment and cleared his throat, adjusting his hand placement on Sherlock’s waist and glancing around the cave and then outside at the deluge when Sherlock rubbed his wet and icy forehead against his neck with a groan of discomfort.
“It wouldn’t,” John corrected carefree and joyful.
, sit—
, Sherlock,” he bit out. John internally cursed himself for not getting naked when he had the opportunity. His cock ached with the overwhelming urge to be touched, to be pressed deep where his fingers lay, caught by Sherlock’s ravenous body, even as Sherlock shook his head, stubbornly mischievous and disobedient. “
Sherlock quirked his eyebrow as John touched his chin with his fingertips, tracing them along his jaw before he cupped the steady pulse in Sherlock’s neck.
—Your hands... the...
“She’ll add more icing,” Sherlock told him in a stage whisper, peering over his shoulder and almost missing a step at the fondly amused and loving expression on John’s face.
John closed that gap between their lips to kiss him once more. Getting to have such a thing, to have John’s mouth on his, even in a light, whispering brush, was something he knew he’d not get used to for a long while, something he’d probably never bore of. John was anything but boring after all. Sherlock lifted his hands, which were annoyingly trembling again, to cradle his head and dropped a kiss of his own, in thanks, in a plea for him to never stop.
you standing over me? Babysitting me?” Clenching both hands into the tight, creaking seams of Sherlock's shirt, John pushed roughly on Sherlock's shoulders with increasing pressure. “
“Top drawer,” John directed and wiped his hands on his jeans as he climbed off the bed, itching to strip.
Grinning, happy to have his way, Sherlock took out the buck’s fizz for her but turned to the cupboard quickly, “Christmas or not, you need to get the best out of meals, you need everything to compliment each other. The food, the wine, the sauces, the desserts.” There was a bottle of Merlot in the cupboard, a semi-decent one, probably a present from someone going by the bucks fizz, though it wasn’t quite the quality he would have liked. It would have to do though, as there was nothing else.
decaf.”
“I'm sorry?” The confused looking man asked, blinking and frowning, lips turned up in bemusement. “I think you're mistaking me for someone, mate.”
“I know,” John replied, resting his head on the back of Sherlock’s covered neck and straightened up collar.
Greg sighed, “I’m not your father,” he said, shifting forwards and placing the mug on the table again, “but I want you to listen to me, and I want you to listen
Once the fizzing climax had ended, John collapsed beside Sherlock and kissed the sharp blades of his shoulders, shaking with exertion, holding him tightly in his arms, “Are you okay?” he questioned, poking Sherlock's heel with his toes.

“John...” he whined, bending his head down and rutting forward, so close to the end that John could almost taste it in the air.

“You do,” John conceded with a bob of his head only to look towards the front door when a car horn sounded. “That would be them.”
“True,” John said, “but he’ll spend more time with you, he’ll
.” With a glance at John, at his beaming smile and warm gaze, eyes both affectionate and still incredibly flirtatious, Sherlock lobbed the stick over Orion’s head and across the green. Orion sprinted after it with a bark, looking up as it arched overhead and dropped with a bounce on the grass. The puppy ran around it before picking up and trotting back to the bench, where John had curled his arm through Sherlock’s.
“Good boy,” John said and squeezed Sherlock’s fingers. “You’ll teach him a lot of tricks.”
“I haven’t had duck in
... of you... oh
Torn between staring back and watching how his hands enveloped them, skin slicked wet, Sherlock mewled softly in fervor and swiped a deft thumb over their sensitive heads, mixing the fluid there with a lustful, slightly possessive baring of his teeth, “
John headed to the bathroom, disposing of the condom in the bin with a whistle before rinsing a flannel in some warm water, squeezing and folding and wringing. His rosy face greeted him in the mirror when he looked up from his task and he took a moment to stare. He looked happy, healthy, and there were red marks where Greg’s teeth had grazed him, a developing love bite behind his ear, and stubble rash on the flesh of his arm. John swallowed thickly and touched each spot in turn, surprised at how fast the sizzle of renewed arousal ignited.
“I still

are you talking about?"
“No chicken or turkey?” Sherlock asked her as he turned from them both, using the living room windows to watch their reflections, to spy on John. He knew John was happy living at the flat for the moment, though he also knew John could be happier, that he was forever chasing something else, something outside of their little world. Women mostly. Boring women with boring lives, which would no doubt end in a boring wedding.
, make her stop,” Sherlock grumbled, though he felt an odd fluttering of both shyness, at being caught indulging in affection, and anticipation, for the photo that would come of it. Documented evidence of their change in relationship. Irrefutable proof that they had been something more, that John had held him close, smelt his hair, kissed his skin, wanted him. If John ever left, if things ever stopped, he’d have the photo, he’d have the physical memory of it.
energetic,” John continued, “always exploring the garden they allow the dogs to run around in. He’s run off only to come back covered in mud a time or two.”
me would be...” He felt a throb in his groin and shifted curiously. “Yeah, I think I would like to try.”
“I thought you might have been... somewhat offended,” John answered quietly, allowing Sherlock to touch and divest him of his outerwear, even when he shouldn't, when he needed to distance himself to think properly, to calm down. He was already half hard. Already fighting to keep from doing more than kissing. “I thought you might have assumed they were belittling you or taking the piss.” He found himself abruptly cupping Sherlock's cheek and moved to the corner of his mouth, lips touching with every exhale. “I didn't... didn't want you to feel

nervous about--"
“Why didn’t you say anything?” John asked, putting the gloves down.
Growling through his open mouth, Sherlock reached back to swat at him, only just grazing John’s face with his fingertips, “Th-that isn’t fair! - What do… you expect me to do when there is nothing else to--” Another slap, this time to the inner thigh, and Sherlock bucked awkwardly, mashing his nose and mouth to the wallpaper. He sucked at it with a high sound of craving and frustration. Toes curling when John groaned up against that intimate skin and gave the meat of his backside a stinging bite, licking rough and eager. "
“After what we’ve done, I’d say my virginity is on it's way out. - If it's not done with already. I suppose it depends on who you ask. Some consider loss of virginity to include oral sex, anal sex or mutual masturbation, after all...”
“How did you think I was going to react exactly?” Sherlock questioned in curious interest, tugging John by the belt hoops for another kiss and then smoothing his hands up and down John’s shirt, getting rid of wrinkles and creases, before he palmed over his shoulders, down his arms, pushing the coat off. "What were you afraid of?"
John was sick with desire, “Th-that’s it. Do…
Sherlock blinked at him in reply and bent down to take the stick back, flicking slobber from his fingers, “
Sherlock blinked at it, finding his hands suddenly unsteady, and swallowed, staring at the photo, re-reading the letter, and then looking up at John, “A...dog,” he found himself uttering, voice a strange, wonky, strained whisper. The world around him tilted, went quiet, tunnelling on the weight of the papers in his hands and the expression on John’s face. His heart throbbed hard, throat closing, as he gaped at John, at the smile still on his face, at the glint in his eyes, at the anticipating lift of his brow, and then the sudden furrowing of his forehead.
exploration next..."
“...Yes,” he replied and gave John’s mouth a fleetingly glance as he reached up with a long arm to get down another dish and fill with water, all without moving too far from John. “She'll be thirsty too.”
“Sounds good,” John agreed, giving his fingers a squeeze and smiling back at their new dog. Their dog. “He needs to run around a bit. Don’t you, boy?”

,” Sherlock grumbled under his breath, peering in through the window, eyeing what he needed and where it was stored and shelved, planning a route through the small, short aisles. The less need to linger, to socialise, the better. There were only three people at the counter. Two slowly perusing, one of whom was stealing. Bracing himself, Sherlock brought Orion close and reached to push open the door, shooting a smiling John a warning glower. “
John hummed, his other hand twisting Sherlock’s to face palm up, as John’s fingers flittered across his pulse in his wrist, “

Sherlock watched and straightened, smiling when Orion glanced up the length of his body at the movement, “He really does like you,” he stated.
“Oh...really? Gosh,” Santa murmured with a mockingly serious wince, mouth hidden by his hand as he brushed at his moustache. John knew what he was doing. He wasn't stupid. Even if he was drunk. “Sounds

“Good lad,” John praised into Sherlock's right buttock with a smile, dipping to lick again, circling the rim and then flicking inside. Sherlock tasted like lubricant and musk and John was wild with want as he tongue fucked into the younger man, only stopping when the sounds suggested Sherlock had too. He waited, teasing with the poking point, then pulled away and left Sherlock with no stimulation at all. "You don't get something for nothing!"

“No, it’s not,” John laughed, pulling out of Sherlock as gently as he could to lay at his other side Sherlock, condom still comically attached. He leaned over, snuggling under Sherlock’s still extended arms, and rubbed across his twitching, tensing, heaving stomach, smearing in the ejaculate. It made Greg’s eyes droop in evident lust. “We haven't been together,
"Brilliant," John hummed, taking the jug of custard and tub of ice cream in hand. "After you."
John licked his lips, finding it difficult to focus, to really think of what he was against, of what he wanted to do about this, “I… just… there is a

Sherlock snorted at the compliment but looked at him, his expression open and amused, “Give me your hand, you
miss you,” he admitted breathlessly, voice so quiet it was almost inaudible, each word enunciated against John’s tingling lips between their sucking kisses.  "And it was... rather vital that I... see you after...
"Your soldier persona. Your

“Do you want me to suck you a little?” John asked in a low tone, nosing at Sherlock's stomach. He didn't always want oral stimulation, finding it quite overwhelming most of the time, but there were other times he seemed to like the sensation of growing hard in John's mouth, of watching John tug and suck at the flaccid skin until it was thick and flushed.
“You… can

“We could still open a bottle of wine too, if you like? I think we have a red… and Mrs Hudson will probably have a bottle of white, if you'd prefer that. I'm not working tomorrow so we could enjoy ourselves,” John continued, watching his own fingers sink and swirl and tangle within Sherlock's curls, enraptured by it now that he had the time to indulge, to fuss, without having his mind focused on other things. He found and stroked a small scar by Sherlock's ear, pondering the reason for its existence for a second, and then spread his fingers to envelop Sherlock's hot scalp, wanting to inspect more in a weird thrill of exploration.
“It-it’s okay,” John told him, “Really. It’s

," John told him with a stern wave of his spoon. "You'll set a bad example for Orion."
Always silent, always hidden, as though a private shame. Something for Sherlock to endure alone. John sometimes wondered if this was how Sherlock lived through his teenage years of schoolyard bullying. Did he hide away in his room at home or within a dorm room in some fancy boarding school? Buried under a mountain of bedding to shed his tears soundlessly, concealing himself from the tormenting cruelty of other boys? Spending years without a companion to confide in. Nobody but his big brother to protect him.

“Never is. We don’t ‘hang out,’” Sherlock said. “The definition of ‘hanging out’ is to frequently visit a place or spend time with someone. We don’t do that.”
!” Sherlock told her as he did as he was bid, striding to the kitchen after another mouthful of his remaining food, scraping the plate clean. “I love ice cream and custard with Christmas pudding.”
“Sh, it's alright, I know,” John purred, placing an affection peck upon the tip of his nose with a smile. “Just – don't come yet.
. No, I… it's nothing about the type of ribbon. I just… I don’t know how to process this, how to respond,” John replied with a short laugh, taking in the pretty picture that Sherlock made. The placement of each bow. How his pale skin looked in contrast to the multi-coloured ribbons that surrounded him, that clung to certain parts of him, that lay before him. “I know that we… that we’ve done… that we do
a test...” He grabbed at John again, turning him around with a glare and letting go once he was. “
“Yes…” Sherlock fiddled with the bow and then turned to watch her shuffle out, feeling the urge to request her company. She would love the dog too. She had agreed to allow it. He would be living in her home. She would love it as much as John and him. “Do you want to come?”
“It was barely a kiss,” Sherlock retorted with a cocky eyebrow quirk.
“...I’m unsure if there
“I know, John,” Sherlock whispered and tried to fight his gathering tears, hating his body’s reactions, hating the raw emotional wound that never seemed to heal. “Orion

“He has a

Greg hummed in faint agreement as Sherlock’s entire body began to shake, his cock giving a visible warning throb, “

too long, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I hated it and threw up all over his fancy fur rug. All right?”
Removing his fingers, John wiped each on some tissue and trailed them up Sherlock's inner thigh, cupping his testicles and teasing the long, raised veins of his shaft, “Are you ready?” he asked, practically vibrating with desire. He knew he couldn't touch the head of Sherlock's cock, it was too sensitive, too much for him, now that he was fully aroused. Instead John stroked and touched everything else that was available to him, every last inch of it. “On your side?”
He hummed the song under his breath whilst he waited for the water to heat, keeping it low in case Sherlock's sensitive and heightened hearing caught wind of it, and undressed, standing naked in front of the gradually steaming mirror. As he looked at himself, he didn't see himself, in fact, he looked straight through his own reflection and instead thought of Sherlock, remembered his reactions, his flush, his quivering thighs and arching back. How many people had done that? Made him squirm? How many had even the permission, the privilege, to touch and grasp and messily swirl? John shouldn't be arrogant over the answer he knew it would be, over the fact that he may be one of the only people, excluding a hairdresser, who'd sank their fingers through the man's hair, enough to make him shake, blush, and lose the power of speech. John shouldn't like it, but he did. God help him he loved the power it gave him.
, yes. Both. Of course. That’s completely understandable, I suppose. Especially with the puppy. How he’ll react to me –
matter?" John searched Sherlock’s face, hating how much his heart beat at their closeness, at how his breath hitched and skin heated, it made it difficult to argue, to think at all. As usual. Sherlock was a blurry mess but he still wanted him, wanted every part of him, and he was sure it showed on his face, had always shown, because Sherlock blinked and cradled his head in two, shaking pale hands to kiss him.
... as well as... the... the other thing. - I'd... I'd be willing to try and let you fuck me if you don't want to be fucked basically...”
John rubbed at his back and pressed a kiss to his neck, “I’m here for you, in whatever capacity you need. Just say the word.”
Sherlock took a deep breath with an irked glance upwards, “
"I might use this one."

, I think. Makes you question and ponder things you might not have ever even considered before,” Greg assured him in a whisper, patting Sherlock’s naked back with a fond amusement when he rolled onto his side, fussed in complaint, and pushed his face into John’s chest. “Even this kind of thing. Weirdly.”
“Hey, don't sulk, this is your fault!” John reminded Sherlock and his pinching mouth. “You're the one who forced my hand into telling him. But he's not bothered –

“Boring,” Sherlock sighed with a small, bubbling giggle that he hadn’t expected to tumble from his throat.
"Didn't even get the condom on in time--"
with what I do and do not want in
This time he did it slowly. Achingly slowly. Applying a bit more pressure when they were finally connected and sending John’s eyes rolling up, his legs wobbling. He reached out for Sherlock, grasping him like a drowning man for a life-raft, one unsteady hand going for his slim waist and the other cupping his cheek, learning the feel of him, branding himself with it. John wanted to deepen the kiss in abandon, wanted to push his tongue into the warmth of Sherlock's mouth, wanted to take and own and then give in equal measure, but he was petrified by what that lead to, knowing that to go through with that really meant there was no way back. What the hell was he doing? Warnings rang out in his head as he continued the pressure, continued kissing him, never pulling away, even as the thoughts that rolled about in his head got louder and more frantic, more shrill. This could be a disaster. This was a disaster.
This lack of adequate sleep, food and – John had to admit – sexual gratification, had quickly frayed his last nerve.
“Nope, though there are many more nights to come where we can experiment… hopefully,” John chuckled, making sure to keep his tone light and airy, looking at Greg, at his flushed face, dilated pupils, shimmering brow, and elevated breathing. He was still aroused and hadn't had any sexual relief. Hadn’t even asked for it. John felt a slither of guilt and chagrin. “Do you want me to uh… I could… I know he said I was no good at it, but I could maybe suck you off? If you want?”
“Sherlock…” he moaned, carefully removing his fingers so not to overstimulate him, “Sherlock, can I fuck you? I need… I
know them is another matter.”
Greg huffed indignantly, “

"It's already forgotten," John said, looking into his eyes. "It wouldn't hurt next time though."
John, with some difficulty, worked to slide his fingers away from Sherlock's prostate and kept just the tips inside him, just barely penetrating, unable to withdraw completely, yet enough to stop all wanted stimulation, “You heard the man.”
. - And you can’t seem to pick anyone good.

“I’m not well liked, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said under his breath, glaring at the microwave. “Things only go well if I am in
"Am I carrying everything?" John asked quietly with a resigned tone.
Now John was definitely suspicious and he wondered what terrible tricks Mrs Hudson been up to this time. What more could she do?
!" Where are those damn taxis?
The talking and sharing emotions was new, but the looseness in Sherlock's form was not, was achingly familiar, and John knew what Sherlock needed next. What he always needed. He nudged at Sherlock's ear, his cheek, so he lifted his head and kissed him lazily, “Ready for bed? I know you're tired, but I think you'd be more settled in the bedroom...”
distraction.”
John chuckled and raised his hand to the door, “If I didn’t know any better, I would have thought you skipped breakfast,” he said as he knocked.
“Oh, please…yes, Sherlock, please.” John’s hand dropped away as Sherlock’s long fingers encircled him, the slick wetness from his earlier release making the glide of his hand smooth and warm and dazzlingly satisfying.
“Wasn’t aroused then, though, of course,” Greg added in a mutter, eyes flickering over Sherlock’s supine figure. They didn’t linger anywhere until they’d roamed all the way up to his face, only then did they stutter to a stop, seized by Sherlock’s impactful captivating stare. “Is it in some part because of me? Should I be flattered?”
John hummed and stepped closer, slowly rising onto his toes and pressing closer before their lips met in a brief, soft, loving kiss, “I’m glad you did.”
it. It became a part of me. For a while…”
, John, I’d displace all my hard work.” He sighed with a forming scowl and quickly held up his hand when John stammered and animatedly swept his arm around, ready to start repeating himself, ready to lecture, ready to ramble. John was somewhat thankful that Sherlock had stopped the tirade. He was sure that whatever it had been, wouldn't have made much sense. “Why do you
“Didn't hurt you did I?” John asked with a gasp, attempting to catch his breath. Using his unsteady, clumsy fingers to hold the base of the condom, he cautiously withdrew, rubbing his thumb across Sherlock's puffy rim and then standing on wobbly legs to take the condom and dispose of it. "

"--Perhaps get you to ruin these unsexy pants of yours for good measure too. - Small challenge I thought I'd set myself."

“Yes, well...I regularly
," John said. "I'm going home."
Grimacing, Sherlock gave a jolting nod, "I suppose 'worried' encapsulates it in it's simplest form, yes."
“Er, yeah. Normally you tell everyone to shut up," John replied with a humourless, short laugh, looking at where his hand was now hovering. Midway between delving back into Sherlock's tempting hair or dropping back to the headrest. "I... I didn't hurt you or anything, did I? I didn't mean to tug or whatever it was that I may have done… even if it's... not... uh... any sort of pulling--”
Blinking, John frowned, mouth twisted halfway between a surprised grin and a suspicious grimace, “The ‘last time?’”
,” he grunted thickly, grabbing for John’s wrist with a vice-like, bruising grip, and dropping his head on John’s naked shoulder, panting there, leaving small, warm trails of saliva as he turned to nestle into the crook of his neck. “Stop… what
John huffed, throwing down his card, watching like a hawk as Sherlock put his next one down, “I'm
“Yes, thank you dears,” she said, setting the bowls on the side with a knowing smile. “Don’t forget to bring the ice cream and custard!” With that she disappeared back into the dining room again.
"I can't see you and... I
,” Sherlock commented, reaching down and close for his buckle and zip, nosing first back up John’s throat and trailing his curls across his cheek in a cat-like nuzzle. "I hope they're...
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a loud, put upon sigh, and then reached to cup John through his underwear, "
good and my body… well, it's perked up a bit. That's all—I can feel your skin on mine... I like it. I like it
John rolled his eyes and sat on his chair, crossing his ankles in front of him, “You could have come out with us. Mike and Veronica were asking about you.”
“Yeah?” Greg asked, leaning over to turn the bedside lamp off and pitch them into the swiftly drawing gloom of the night. “Was Sherlock the first man you’ve fancied?”
we're a couple. We're closer than regular friends, Sherlock. We live together and work together and finish each other's sentences sometimes!” John grumbled unhappily. “And anyway! This is
commendable,” John mumbled, though softened as he looked Sherlock over and took a moment to calm himself, to try and see it from Sherlock's perspective, tried not to let his horrid mood spoil something that was actually quite adorable if he thought about it properly. Smiling at Sherlock, John turned and sighed with a gentle nod. “Yeah. It's lovely that you've saved
“He’ll be the envy of the entire dog community,” John said, “and you, the master dog whisperer.” As if on cue Orion started barking, though it was at a cyclist that was riding past, fast and single minded, as all London cyclists were.
“It’s not often that men's nipples are, no,” John replied, giving Sherlock's prostate another tap and smiling at Sherlock's open-mouthed expression of pleasure, “But they are for him. Half of that is just personal erogenous zones and another, I think, is because he was so unused to sexual touch before, except his own. All these sensations are still relatively new to him, and he's
Blinking widely at the suggestion, like the thought had never occurred to him, like he had no idea it was even something that people did, Sherlock leaned back, reached down and took a firm grasp of them with a shaky hand, flexing his hips forward to grind up into it, up against John. It was immediately addicting for him, made him all the more flushed, made his mouth drop open on a throaty groan, and he began to rut forward with more and more passion, adding his other hand in a daze of bewilderment.

“I didn’t say
knowledge of the muscles and joints and bones in the human body to really pull it off correctly.”
He could hear John running the tap in the bathroom next door, hear him brushing his teeth with the strict care he always took when it came to his mouth just before a date. Shaken, Sherlock robotically got changed, putting his pyjamas and dressing gown aside, replacing them with a suit. He stared at himself in the mirror of his wardrobe and frowned, tugging at his jacket, smoothing out his shirt, and then picking at the fluff clinging to his trousers. He was nervous. It had been quite some time since he’d been nervous to meet John, since he’d wanted to look his best. His stomach quivered and he reflectively swallowed, wishing he’d gone to the bathroom first.
“Only for a short time,” she told him with a quick shrug and a smile. “It didn’t take me long to—”
“No more sausage talk,” Sherlock told him, embarrassed with how breathy his voice sounded as he relished the contact and warmth, spotting John’s cocky smile. “

“He’s right here in front of me,” John said, “and I hope I’ll get to see him a lot more in the future.”
“...No,” John heard himself whisper, looking into Sherlock’s face as he lay in John’s bed, utterly naked. “But I will..” He took a minute to absorb the sight, to watch Sherlock’s mood change, lips pursed, and then he got out of bed, changed, made a quick sandwich for himself, and left.
John snarled loudly with playful intent and threw himself back over Sherlock.
Sherlock’s next intake of breath was shaky with overpowering glee, “In Mrs Hudson’s living room?”
…” he mewled around a wet, shivery brittle gasp, tears falling down the sides of his face as he arched his head back. John continued with a comforting hush, thrusting and pressing and probing first one finger, then two, then three, feeling the prickle of sweat cascade over his scalp and down his back. Sherlock took it, as he always did, rocking very slightly and letting out small, quiet sounds of mounting pleasure under his breath, held back only by his tongue as his lips parted. "Mm, yes."
It hadn't been him. It had been the act. Plenty of acts could illicit such a reaction. It was only natural. No feelings involved at all. Not one bit.

"Hm. Exactly."
for you boys!”
"Stop."
,” Sherlock retorted with a drawling tone, ignoring John’s pinch of admonishment. “You either agree and continue or decline and leave. This is a threesome.
Sherlock's muscles gripped him like a velvet glove. Massaged his length spectacularly, as he reacted in the most delicious of ways, encouraging more movements from John while he half-listened to the low music still filtering in from the living room, pairing it subconsciously with the sounds uttered from Sherlock, gorging himself on both as they merged and heightened to a crescendo, twisting as he was coaxed towards orgasm. They were joined by John's own voice. By his moans and signs. The bursting eagerness that flared inside him, inside them both, growing and building, building, building until he was sure he would almost crack open with it. John could barely hold the pleasure in, could barely breathe, could barely think of anything else but wanting to touch Sherlock, to claim him, to smell him and taste him and reassure him that yes, yes, they would always be together. John didn't care about Sherlock's black moods, he didn't care about the experiments in the teacups or the discrimination against his favourite jumpers. He didn't care about any of that because he had Sherlock. He could hold him, he could touch him and soothe him in a way nobody ever could.
“… Your room?” John asked, quite sensibly foregoing the option of the kitchen.
“Oh, you
"Might be," John said and leaned into him as Orion charged, a source of boundless energy.
“And how, precisely, is
!” John stressed, almost dropping a carton of eggs, not something the turkey would appreciate he was sure. He glanced at her, watching the bird move with a rustle of feathers, a of clicking talons, to stand near the coffee table, eyeing up biscuits that had been left out on a plate. “Just make sure you get rid of it. I don't fancy Mrs Hudson getting the fright of her life if she calls up to see us.”
say that,” John admonished, though his eyes were still so very soft and alluring. He pulled away with a squeeze to Sherlock’s shoulder after a moment and turned toward the kitchen. “I’ll see you in a bit.”
Greg hesitated, glancing upwards, eyeing the windows and puffing out his cheeks in thought, “I
the one on the light?--”
Chuckling at how angry Sherlock looked, John lifted his hands in defeat and pushed on Sherlock's slender wrist until he let him speak clearly, “Don't you like me serenading you?” he teased, his voice a bit breathy after the dizzying rush of being shoved against a wall because of some bad singing. John looked up at Sherlock, dropping his head back, and smirked with playful abandon, feeling his heartbeat kicking harder against his ribs. "Admit it, you love—"
I could be young forever. Imagine us both solving crimes for centuries...”
them. You have enough, I
“They aren’t that old, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock told her reaching across to take her arms in his hands, soothingly rubbing and stroking down to her elbows to give them a pat. “They’re fine. You’re fine.”
,” John laughed, “And secondly, why can't you seethe and sizzle over these petty things in your head, for once? Fill a room in that palace of yours with all the things wrong with all the things I like, then set it on fire and start again. Give you something to do! Is it
Greg pursed his mouth and grunted in aggravation, cutting Sherlock off, “This is a threesome, right? Not a twosome where the odd one out just watches at the side.”
“Right. Good. Glad we've come to an agreement,” John said, feeling his heartbeat being to race now that their conversation was coming to an end, now that the inevitable was coming. Sherlock was burning holes into him, seeing deep into him, reading every breath he took, every movement he made. “How the bloody hell did you get them up, anyway? Were you using that old, hazardous ladder of yours?--”
“No more coats or outfits or hats for a dog, please,” Sherlock told her, picking up his violin and bow, moving to stand beside her to give her shoulder a fond squeeze. He was thankful for her consideration of the puppy, no matter how silly it was. He was always thankful to her.
?” Suddenly unsure, John turned his full attention to Greg in apprehension, hoping he was right about him. “Because if it's too weird I can shut up?”
“It’s old. Falling apart from the inside,” Sherlock told him and waved a dismissive hand, turning away. “It needs replacing. I’ll do it. It detrimental for you and for me. Your blog, as romanticised and frankly lacklustre as it is, does bring in clients. Stupid people look at stupid things, I suppose. My site is obviously too intelligent.”
“Sherlock?” John blinked, eyebrows meeting in the middle and the hand around Sherlock's throat squeezing just a tiny fraction more. He was unsure whether to strangle the detective further or let go. “What the

“Good idea,” John said, getting a plate out of the cupboard so Sherlock could upend the pudding. “They’d probably provide one, but he should get used to what he’ll have on a daily basis.”

John scrutinised him but nodded a moment later, “I will accept this.”

John sighed and flushed, vibrating, put on the spot with an unhelpfully blank mind and a cowering confidence, “What… what we
“Sherlock, I have to…sorry…” John gave himself two swift strokes before he felt the warm touch of Sherlock’s hand around his and gasped, staring up into his eyes.
“Frustrated,” Sherlock intoned, eyes somehow dulling. “Hm. With me?”
“Plenty of time to decide,” John said, giving Sherlock’s shoulder a squeeze.
“I don’t have many photos of you, you know,” John said as the camera clicked a few more times.
,” John promised, cupping Sherlock's cheek tenderly pushing a gentle peck to the corner of his dubiously shifting mouth. “You're as vital to me as oxygen. Without you, I would wither.” He nudged their noses together, letting them breathe as one for a brief moment. “I'd die without you...”
,” John struggled with a stammer, trying to play it off and make it more believable with a flourish and a nod. “Yep. Homer Lock is his name.
“It's not something to be ashamed of,” John reassured him, pressing a few kisses to Sherlock's flushing cock, “You
Sherlock looked up at him through his lashes and then adjusted his position when John’s erection thickened and hardened further, dropping his head to John’s shoulder again, only with his face pressed into John’s jumper. John tried to control his breathing and stared out at the hammering rain and hail, watching it bounce and collide roughly with the grass, throwing up droplets of mud.
Sighing, Sherlock waved a dismissive hand, “
"Yes, and that's the
“Hi,” John replied, blinking sleep from his eyes also. “Lunch is ready.”
, no!” The exclamation was thunderous as he slammed his legs together to try and trap John’s hand in place. Greg tried to intercept, but Sherlock was swift and John was too lost in the humid fog of arousal to move as fast as he needed. The sudden clasp of thick, sweaty, hard thighs hurt. Hurt in the best way. “Don’t!”

are you doing this to me? Why must you irk me so?”
“Quite,” Sherlock told him, hating how much he quivered at their closeness, at his strong, pulsing heartbeat and trying to distract John from it by touching his knuckles, rubbing and pressing and patting. “I...thought about this often.”
“I suspect it might be about a certain someone in this room,” Mrs Hudson replied as John dropped the curled fish onto his palm.
Greg reached to hook a hand, almost instinctively, under Sherlock’s knee as John stepped towards them, bending the leg enticingly enough to lift Sherlock’s hips, “

“Oh, Jesus Christ, get over here. You’re freezing. I’m freezing. Come here,” John grumbled, waving Sherlock over and turning to look away when Sherlock glanced at him. “Body heat and…all that. Come on.”
Shaking his head, John let out a chuckle, surprised he even felt the need to jump to Sherlock’s defence given his attitude, “He's not. Not really. Not

Greg frowned in amused sympathy and nodded, shuffling around to slip onto the bed at Sherlock’s side, reaching to pet back his fringe, “Is it always like that between you two? Always that…
. Stop being such a baby.” Keeping one hand on the turkey, stroking her feathers and keeping her from walking or jumping off the table, Sherlock then lifted John’s fingers to drift lightly down her long neck. She blinked at them calmly, watching and clucking, and Sherlock moved John’s hand down her back. “There. See? It’s
,” he said again, clenched, wringing hands pressed against his reddened torso as he waited. He made quite the picture. As he regularly did. John had to take just a moment or two to enjoy it before he grabbed a condom packet and slipped behind him, tucking up and taking hold of Sherlock’s hips to angle him, knowing he liked the handling.

John looked down at the elbow with raised eyebrows, but he chuckled and slipped his arm through, “You’re a

John chuckled and, after a brief moment of hesitation, leaned in to press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, “Off we go then,” he said and headed out the door.

, you're both going to kill me,” John jokingly complained as he started up a slower rhythm, enough to keep Sherlock writhing as he took the two men in, soaked in the knowledge that it was happening, that he was allowed this. He had never thought of sharing himself with two, never mind them sharing themselves with him. “He loves his nipples being played with, by the way.” John nodded towards the hardened, pale pink nubs and quirked a brow, trying to convey just how much Sherlock liked being touched there with that small, fleeting movement. “Makes him all wiggly and pretty--”
“You let her get away with
Throwing the flannel to the floor after the last bit was swiped away, John shuffled closer and carefully sat Sherlock up, supporting his head and bringing the glass to his lips, “Sherlock. Sherlock wake up and take a few sips for me,” John said fondly as he held the glass to his lax mouth. “Come on, just a few.”
“Is... that a yes?” John asked quietly, heart beating so hard he feared it might explode from his chest. “Because... I will. I
“A minute or two more,” Sherlock asked, almost begged, stroking the jumper between his fingers. “
“Most people are,” Santa agreed reassuringly, giving John a pat on the back. “Neither naughty nor nice. Just average. Normal.
“Oh, good lord,” John breathed with a laugh, dizzy and hot from another overpowering spike of arousal, cock fully erect within the confines of his jeans, leaking at the way Greg stroked Sherlock’s bicep and cradled his elbow.

Sherlock’s neck and collarbones went rosy, “
Sherlock arched an eyebrow and then leaned down, a fluttering rush of sudden flirtatious mischievousness taking over his face, “Do
for that Mrs Hudson,” he said, hoping she wouldn't quite catch his sarcasm. “Right, I best go and try and lure him out then, shouldn’t I? With the promise of tea and biscuits.”
Sherlock looked at him blankly.
“… What is that supposed to mean? ‘One look at me?’ How does my appearance constitute us sleeping together? How does it have any significance at all?” he questioned with an animated flailing of his arms, altering his stance, chest heaving. Before John could scowl and counter, teeth still firmly gritted, blood on fire, and hands eager to shove and grasp again in gathering frustration, Sherlock frowned at him and shook his head somewhat helplessly. “
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock sat back trying to look bored, “Peter Pan now, are you?”

do,” John replied out the corner of his mouth, still looking at Greg and motioning for them to continue their conversation, undeterred by Sherlock, “You know you always have somewhere to stay here, yeah? Regardless of what's going on, you're welcome here. We have tea and sympathetic ears aplenty – Well,
, and you are in need of a work out,” Sherlock replied, taking his card back once the money was transferred and grabbing the bag, shoving it into John’s broad, lovely, solid, warm chest as he pushed them all toward the door. “But no. We shall share the burden.”
... fuck... oh..."
, not all,” Sherlock pointed out, resting into John with a smile and tugging his phone from his pocket. “Let’s see which, shall we?”
“I just want to eat and go to bed,” Greg informed him, opening the fridge to find his leftovers. “There is no ‘hang out with Sherlock’ on that list.” Ah good, it was still alright.
“And I

To put a barrier between them so he could think, so he could digest what was happening. The swirl of anger, now mixed with confused arousal, was still present. Still throbbing throughout him. "I thought you were '

It scorches the back of my eyes.” His length increased with a small twitching jolt and he shifted, hands now lifting to reach and rest atop of John’s head, to cup his jaw, to follow and examine where he lay within John’s mouth. Being used to the inspecting invading touch, John allowed his jaw to slacken and held his breath, making sure not to gag when Sherlock grew a few inches more. “I have never wanted something quite like it. I didn’t care for it. Yet I always grow hard at the mere idea. Something I have not done before...”
