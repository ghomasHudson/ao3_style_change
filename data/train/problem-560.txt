Sherlock nodded. It made sense. He had come to this place, expecting to find a secret lover. But what he had found instead was pure Mycroft. Mycroft had always told him not to get involved, and it seemed that he had been following his own advice, despite everything. In the end he had managed to keep the person he loved safe. And that was what true, selfless love was about, wasn't it? To ensure the other's well-being on top of everything else.
"I don't know."
Sherlock's chest constricted. "Me too."
He pulled Sherlock into his office and closed the door behind them.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, staring at the empty fireplace.
I felt delighted about my decision to give Sherlock access to the corpse in the middle of the night, until I looked over to John. What John was doing I can only describe as ogling. I think neither of us was paying attention to Sherlock's running commentary on his progress with the case. Just like me, John was simply staring at Sherlock's body.
Sherlock wanted nothing more. "Yes," he whispered.
"Alright. We'll need some supplies." He reached for his wallet. "I have a condom. Do you have lube?"
"Ready?" John asked, his voice strained.
to leave John out of the equation. Now it seemed that, after all this time, it was coming back at him again.
"Is it okay if I kiss you?"
"Sherlock, I..." John's voice was loud in the quiet room. Then he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly through his mouth. The way he always did when he was fighting to regain his composure. When he spoke his voice sounded calm. "They say one should not speak ill of that dead. But Sherlock, your brother was a selfish bastard. And a bloody idiot. And a coward."
It was still quite early. Only a little after ten, and Sherlock did not feel tired anymore. But now that he had brought doom upon himself, there was not really a point in delaying anything.
John complies and opens his dressing gown. His cock is leaking copiously onto his belly. Sherlock just stares in awe.
"Bloody hell, Sherlock. Do you have any idea how hot this is?" John was slightly out of breath. He reached for his own cock to give it a quick stroke and pull back the foreskin. This in turn further sparked Sherlock's arousal, and he pushed in a second finger.
I have been aware of my brother's affection for John Watson for a long time. Loyalty and friendship were there from the very beginning. As far as a more carnal side of their relationship was concerned, I simply considered it of no importance.
"More than okay." John grinned. "Just one thing before I drag you to the bedroom."
The deducing started after the amuse-bouche. A respected member of the House of Lords had the audacity refuse an alcoholic beverage, which Sherlock, correctly, diagnosed to be a result of the man's fear of excessive complications with his addiction to tranquillisers. One look by Sherlock was enough to communicate this to John, whose eyes were sparkling in admiration. Sherlock did not even try to contain his smug expression.
Sherlock was still catching his breath. "Agreed."
"Sorry, am I distracting you?"
"John, what did you mean when you said
Sherlock finally got a hold of himself. "Monumental."
"Until you began to meet in private," Sherlock interjected. That much was obvious.
"Brilliant!" Sherlock loved John's enthusiasm. "Then we need to prepare you. Do you ever use your fingers on yourself?"
John took it and studied it. Then he looked up at Sherlock. "Are you trying to tell me that this Thomas Alcott and your brother were..."
So much for a quiet day. It seems like some serious thinking is in order. He fills his cup with the leftover breakfast tea and moves to his chair in the sitting room. Staring at the empty chair facing him, he wonders what Sherlock meant by
I think it is fair to say that those two were the last to notice that they were meant for each other. To me at least, the only surprise was that they had finally managed to sort themselves out after all those years of ignoring the elephant in the room.
I had not expected that. "Yes, that would be great," I said, "but you won't injure him, will you?" There was a knife stuck in the mantelpiece. I was slightly worried.
"What?" Sherlock could not believe what he had just heard.
John's lips were on his immediately. Sherlock noticed that he was already kissing back. John opened his mouth and so did Sherlock. They both moaned when their tongues touched for the first time. There was no going back from there. Sherlock felt his body act of its own volition, which he was relieved about, because his brain seemed to be useless at the moment. His body only told Sherlock one thing: get closer to John.
Also, John always had girlfriends. On the other hand, he never had them for long. One could have thought of an obvious reason for this, but I didn't. I'm an idiot, I know.
"Answer my question, Miss Smith." I was starting to get annoyed about all the rudeness and looked at John for support.
Sherlock looked at their state of disarray and had an idea.
He made a half-heartened attempt to pull John towards his bedroom. It seemed that neither of them could muster enough control to walk the remaining few steps. Sherlock shot a helpless glance at John, who gave him the dirtiest look he had ever seen (not that Sherlock had a lot of experience in this area), and started to slide down against the wall.
"I am sorry I woke you." John's voice sounded slightly embarrassed. "Usually, I just sleep on my back and don't move all night. I don't know what happened."
Sherlock did not have to be told twice. He manhandled John into a sitting position and pulled the T-shirt over his head, then pushed him back onto the mattress to remove his shorts. Once he had pulled them off and thrown them across the room he stopped short. John was gorgeous. His cock in particular. Long and thick and leaking all over his belly. Sherlock knew instantly that he wanted to have it inside of him in every possible way. But maybe not this first time.
"Yes, it was quite a big funeral. My father died young, and he was a business man. Lots of friends and colleagues."
"Mr. Holmes." Thomas Alcott was facing him now. "I know it's not even noon, but would you mind having a drink? In view of what we are going to discuss I think we may need one."
Sherlock understood. He was glad that John was taking the lead. John had not asked about his history, but it seemed that he had come to the right conclusions.
how it's done."
Sherlock said nothing.
A loud "Ahh" coming from John got Sherlock's attention. Somehow, they had made it to the corridor, where Sherlock was not-so-gently pushing John against a wall. As far as he could tell, Sherlock was in the process of ravishing John Watson. What an unexpected turn of events. How had this escalated so quickly?
"John, are we still talking about Mycroft?" he asked. "Or is this about The Fall again?"
Sherlock understood. He was beginning to see that he himself knew very little about his brother. He had missed something essential. He had even chosen not to see it.
I could not be happier for my two boys and their little girl and I wish them a long and happy life together.
"Sure, if it's okay for you." John says. "What do you think about
"John..." Sherlock moans and arches into the touch. Then a pair of large hands is squeezing John's arse and, god, it feels amazing. John, who is painfully hard by now, cannot help but rock his hips against Sherlock's body a few times. Sherlock responds to this by countering John's movements with his own hips. John looks at Sherlock's face and sees some hesitance there. Sherlock's eyes are silently asking him if he is doing fine.
Sherlock was not okay. All this new information and what it did to him was too much to handle. The best course of action would be to end the conversation, to allow time to settle things, and to continue as ever. After all, this was what John wanted.
I still cannot believe that they were not aware of what was going on between them that evening. As for me, I ended up in the pub across the street, after John and Sherlock were done. In contrast to John and Sherlock, I did not sleep alone that night.
"Donovan? She won't do anything." Sherlock looked up form his phone.
"Oh hello Sherlock, what are you doing here?"
Right after he passed the bus stop, John appeared on his bicycle and followed us until I had reached my destination.
Five minutes to seven, a dapper young man with a cane appeared on the pavement, apparently waiting for someone. I deduced, as Sherlock would say, that this had be the flatmate. Something did not make sense, though. I certainly would not have associated this man with the contents of the flat. Now I know that John, despite his appearance, is quite capable of an eccentric lifestyle, but it turned out that I was right about the mess not being his.
Sherlock lifts his head and looks at John. "I think I like the shirt better this way."
"Sleeps like a baby," Sherlock said, relieved.
There was no way Sherlock could continue to give his soil sample the attention it deserved. Not with this in front of him. He got up and moved towards the kettle. Tea was always an option.
John breached him with two fingers at once and found his prostate straight away. Sherlock arched off the bed at the sensation. John stroked him with careful precision, mindful not to overstimulate. Every nerve in Sherlock's body seemed to be on fire. He pushed down onto John's fingers. John added a third and stretched him gently. It already felt better than anything he had ever done to himself.
"I should let you sleep. You look really tired."
"Sherlock, are you alright?" John looked worried. "Did I say too much? I did not want to shock you or anything. You asked, and it's no problem for me if you know these things."
Sherlock did not know what to say. John did.
"Yes, I think I was. At least I suspected. There was some evidence. Not only his frequent presence at my house. There were casual touches. There was laughter. When he was with me he was not the posh figure that he chose to be on the outside. But nothing more happened."
"Did you know of my brother's feelings for you?" he asked.
"Shit, indeed." Sherlock tried to hide his face in John's shoulder, as if this could offer any protection.
Sherlock was at a funeral. His brother's funeral. To his right stood his parents, their faces grief-stricken but composed. To his left stood John. There were a few other people: Greg Lestrade, Molly Hooper, two almost identical-looking dark-haired women, a few other people Sherlock recognized as members of Mycroft's household staff. Official England has expressed its condolences but stayed away. Mycroft was not the kind of public figure who got a pompous funeral. This was a family matter, organized by someone who was, officially, not family: John.
They were also closer physically. Touching each other seemed natural. But did that signify more than companionship? Did it warrant a permanent invitation into Sherlock's bedroom? Sherlock knew better, than to give in to wishful thinking. He kept reminding himself to stick to the facts, and the facts were inconclusive at best.
"Sherlock, I've had the whole night to think about this, and I don't want this to change anything. You know, I like sex and I did not get much of it lately. So there was the chance for this casual encounter, and I took it, and it was something I needed, and it was good. What I don't need at the moment is a girlfriend. Because, to be honest, I'm actually quite content with the way things are, and I don't want this to change. What I really want is for you to keep coming over to our place, because we like to have you there. So, please don't stop doing that because of what happened yesterday."
"Lovers? No, at least not in the traditional sense."
John planted himself in front of Sherlock.
John was fighting for control. Looking up, Sherlock saw that John's eyes were closed in concentration. He was panting, making an effort not to be too loud. John's whole body was tense as he tried to keep himself from pushing into Sherlock's mouth.
John got up and walked me to the door. "Thank you for coming to us." Sherlock had returned to ignoring me.
Hence, there was no sofa for Sherlock to sleep on. That in itself would not have been so much of a problem either. Sherlock was an expert in not sleeping for three days and more. The actual problem was that he was at forty-one hours without sleep, thanks to paintball-gun-case now successfully solved, with the sofa as the only casualty besides the victim.
"Okay."
What happens next is not exactly as John has planned. He finds his knees go weak at the realization of the events currently taking place. He is kissing Sherlock. Finally. After everything they have been through. John's world is spinning. He is about to faint from a kiss. How embarrassing. Luckily it does not come to that because a pair of strong arms has gone around his waist, holding him firmly in place, while Sherlock is kissing back with surprising enthusiasm. And he is making those amazing little noises. John is crushing Sherlock against him, deepening the kiss further.
"No you won't. I am not going to endure the mood you are in when you have a stiff neck." John's tone was on the verge of commanding, mixed with a dose of concern.
"Alright. Meaningful it is."
"Why did you have anal sex with her?" Sherlock blurted out.
I was relieved that this appointment finally took a normal course, and started to explain the details that I found should be most useful for a private detective: time and place, a description of the man, as far as I could give it (not much, he always kept his distance), my suspicion about the documents.
John reached for his pocket to retrieve his phone.
"Sherlock?" Had Sherlock done something wrong?
"What the...," John began.
"Not good?"
"That's Mycroft." he said. "I was expecting something like this." He gave the paper back to Sherlock.
"Is it because of that?" he asks. "Are we going too fast?"
Sherlock smiles and blushes slightly, then rolls his eyes in the back of his head when John slowly begins to stroke. What a sight.
It's 11 a.m. on a Friday and John is having his first breakfast of the week. After fourteen hours of undisturbed sleep he is looking forward to a quiet weekend. It had been a good case: a bit of chase, a bit of gore, a lot of praise for Sherlock and a pay cheque that would allow them to spend the rest of the year in sunny Tuscany. Not that this is a realistic option with Sherlock.
that were bubbling up inside his head back into a safe deposit box in the Mind Palace.
"I'm sorry, John." Sherlock sounds almost desperate. "You probably wanted to start slow. But I can't seem to get my reactions under control. This just happened so quickly. And I'm almost about to... Just from a kiss. I will not last, I think. Surely you are used to higher standards."
not being his fault. In their early days John certainly did blame Sherlock when he could not keep any of his girlfriends long enough to get a leg over. But, in hindsight, he should not even have blamed Sherlock back then. And really, this was ages ago. All this happened
*****
"Yes, we do." John looked at him, determined, and sighed. "Probably should have years ago."
"So what would you rather have her do?" John asked, meaning me.
Sherlock rolled to his side and took John with him without breaking the kiss. He hooked his left leg over John's hip. This brought their groins together. And there he felt it. That John was just as hard as he was.
What?! "Sherlock, what the hell is that supposed to mean?" John is confused. This was decidedly not the response he had expected from Sherlock.
"Beautiful." John says.
Dear friends,
"What?" I was more than confused, and glanced at John who had a fond look on his face.
I think I noticed quite early on, but perhaps not as early as I could have. You may not know, but I did have a little crush on Sherlock myself for a short while. For that reason, anything personal going on between Sherlock and John may have hit a blind spot.
Sherlock suddenly knew exactly what he wanted. He untied the robe and spread it open. John shrugged it off his shoulders and was now completely naked. Sherlock had deduced John's penis years ago, but a mental image was nothing compared to seeing it in its full glory. John was erect, foreskin halfway retracted, the head purple and moist. Sherlock felt his own erection fill up at the sight. He needed more, urgently.
"What is your opinion about a detour to the shower?"
"Yes." That was a lie. How could anyone be ready for sharing a bed with John Watson?
"Sherlock. We can do that. I've never thought you would...," John was shaking his head in disbelief. "God, we're two idiots."
"We can do that."
When Sherlock woke again the light of dawn was peeking through the half-closed curtains. Sherlock's right arm was stretched across the mattress. John's head was resting comfortably on his right shoulder. His right hand was touching Sherlock's neck as if it were feeling for his pulse. John was breathing quietly, obviously fast asleep. Sherlock tried to hold still in order not to wake John again, but then he could not resist the temptation and carefully bent his outstretched arm to place it on John's shoulder. John stirred but did not wake up. Sherlock turned his head slightly and smelled John's hair. If only he could wake up like this every day.
Sherlock did his best to look scandalised, which made John laugh out loud, his cock deliciously hitting Sherlock's again.
Sherlock felt exposed. He had never considered the possibility of someone being present while he was doing this to himself.
"Well, I am working here, and you prance through the kitchen, with that tiny bathrobe of yours, that barely leaves anything to the imagination."
When Sherlock arrived, John was already in the interrogation room, talking to the recruit. Sherlock and I watched through the semi-transparent window. The boy sat at the table facing us, John was in the chair across from him.
Sherlock opened his arms and tried to look as welcoming as possible. And then it all fell into place. John moved forward and Sherlock wrapped his arms around him. It felt better than Sherlock could ever have imagined. John's warm body fit against his own perfectly. Sherlock relaxed into the embrace. John's face had come to rest on Sherlock's shoulder again, and his lips moved along Sherlock's skin, almost as if he were kissing him. Sherlock desperately wanted to be kissed by John. He dropped his head into John's hair and began to move his lips the way John did.
"And what about you?"
Sherlock was increasingly confused. Time to come to the point. "Mr. Alcott, what exactly was your relation to my brother?"
"Alight." Sherlock says.
"I did, yes."
As John always says: amazing.
"Sherlock!!" both Mrs. Hudson and John stare at Sherlock in disbelief. John makes a mental note to stop staring in disbelief every time Sherlock exhibits typical behaviour.
Sherlock braced himself for impact. "Yes."
Sherlock walked over to bedside table to retrieve the bottle and threw it on the bed. "Do we need the condom?" he asked.
John laughed. "Yes, that's a good idea. Do you want to help?"
And then it happened. John, sounding almost as gone as Sherlock was, moaned Sherlock's name, and suddenly everything Sherlock had never even dared to imagine became reality. He came hard, come spraying over John's fist, while John kept pushing through the waves of Sherlock's orgasm. Sherlock felt John's cock get even thicker and harder. It only took a few more forceful strokes before John came too, clinging to Sherlock's body as he continued to push into him. Sherlock, reduced to a quivering mess, would have come again, if he'd had any energy left.
"Comfortable?" John asked.
At some point they both noticed that there was someone else in the room. Sherlock gave me a brief sideways glance. This made John stop mid-sentence. He turned towards me, looking slightly embarrassed.
That did not really lighten the mood. Quite the opposite, actually. John was shaking his head rather vigorously. "No Sherlock, this is a completely new dimension! He ruined this man's life!"
John had been a rock in the past few days, even more than usual. The news of Mycroft's death had come as a surprise but not completely unexpected. It was fairly obvious that Mycroft had been a moving target that was bound to get hit someday. Yet, it had seemed almost surreal when the day had finally come. John had been there when a government official had brought the news, and had immediately realized the gravity of the situation. He had not asked what Sherlock needed. Instead, he'd told him what to do.
Considering the fact that his palms were sweating, that his heart rate was dangerously elevated and that he had trouble keeping his breathing under control, Sherlock found he had done an acceptable job getting this out.
John smiled wickedly. "Do you want to give me something to look at, too?"
Mr. Alcott took a sip from his glass. "I saw that you noticed the ring."
The next morning Sherlock woke with a raging erection. Giving his cock an experimental squeeze, he concluded that there was no chance he could ignore it until it went away. He rolled his eyes and made his way to the bathroom to take care of it. As he walked past his bedside table, he noticed two more missed calls on his phone.
"Well, one of my best friends from school. She came to support..."
Surprisingly, I did get an answer: "Dear Ms. Smith, Sherlock Holmes is interested in your case. Please visit us at Baker Street on Thursday afternoon. Kind regards, John Watson."
"Well, what else can he say now? It's not like Mycroft left him an option." John was shaking his head again.
"I don't know. Will you be watching?"
"He probably would not be alive now if he had been given this option." Sherlock countered.
Sherlock locked himself in the bathroom and started to brush his teeth. Should he shave? And take a shower? Maybe a wank would not not be a bad idea either. But then, John would probably know what Sherlock was doing in there, so better not.  Sherlock went to fetch his pillow and blanket, which had been freshly washed and dried after being almost destroyed during the pipe incident, and went back to the living room.
"The situation is quite extraordinary, also for me." Mr. Alcott got up to get something from his desk. It was a hand-written note. "I have been wearing this ring only since yesterday. It's Mycroft's."
John smiled some more. "I think we have thoroughly established that talking is not really a strength of either of us. We could try for a more action-based approach..." He looked at Sherlock. "Come here."
"What case? I don't know of any case." He paused for a moment to think. "You don't mean Marilyn's thing, do you?" Sherlock walked faster.
Mrs. Hudson seems to be the first to find words. "How did you get this idea anyway?" Then she stops short, some kind of realization hitting her. "No, wait. Don't tell me. I am not in the mood for one of your deductions right now."
Sherlock smiled and leaned into John. Round two did sound intriguing.
"Brilliant," Sherlock heard himself say.
Sherlock grabbed his coat and hailed a cab. Half an hour later he was in Monroe's office. The young sergeant seemed surprised to see him. Sherlock took the case file from the desk and started to explain.
"It's alright. You are entitled to know." He took a generous sip from his drink. "We met over a decade ago. I had worked as a banquet manager at various luxury hotels all over the world before I was approached by the Foreign Office. Mycroft already was at the top of the hierarchy when I started to work there. He was only a few years older than me, and younger than most of those in the inner circle, but everyone seemed to take orders from him. I was impressed and intimidated at first, just like anyone else. Nobody seemed to want to tell me what his actual position at the Foreign Office was. By now I think that no one really knew. Everybody seems to know Mycroft Holmes as a different person."
Sherlock took off his coat which was immediately taken from his hands to be hung up on a cloth hook behind to living room door.
"Didn't you want to make tea?"
"Sherlock. I am officially going to make a pass at you now right now." John explains. "If you do not want this, you have five seconds to stop me."
Distraction finally came in the form Sherlock had feared. Downstairs, Mrs. Hudson welcomed John and Rosie. Two minutes later, John entered the flat - alone.
I looked at John, who still had a dreamy smile on his face. "What am I supposed to do now? Should I go to the police?"
"God, yes."
That hurt. It must have been written all over Sherlock's face because John's apology was immediate. "I am sorry, Sherlock, this was uncalled for." John was very good at reading people, but this also meant that he knew where to hit them.
Sherlock finished his tea and set the mug aside. He took a deep breath. Slightly over-dramatic, but the situation required it. And then he started to tell the story. All of it. Just the facts, as Thomas had told him.
"And now let us take a minute of silence to commemorate the role Mycroft Holmes has played in our lives." Sherlock knew that a minute was not enough to do this justice. He was still in the process of realizing the impact Mycroft had had on him, and the even greater impact of not having him in his life anymore. He knew it would take weeks, months even, to fully come to terms with the situation.
"Sherlock..." John tries in his most threatening voice. He guesses the effect falls flat, given that he feels his face turn crimson.
I stopped mid-sentence and looked at Sherlock, who was staring right at me.
"Oh, for god's sake," Sherlock muttered to himself.
John's penis twitched and grew even harder. Then Sherlock's mouth was flooded by a rush of fluid, accompanied by John crying out. Sherlock did his best to swallow, while taking in as many details as possible.
Oh Sherlock. John's heart breaks a little. He finds Sherlock's insecurity somewhat endearing but still ... a bit not good. "Sherlock, stop it. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. If you want to know, I am in a similar state right now. But if you are uncomfortable and want to stop it's fine. And if you want to continue, we can continue. It does not matter if it's over in thirty seconds or if you come in your pants. Hell, if I were wearing any, I would be at a risk myself." Sherlock smiles at this.
It was the day that Sherlock brought John to the flat at Baker Street. I had offered him to rent it after he had helped me with a somewhat delicate family issue. Sherlock, having just started his detective business, was a bit short on money. Even though I did not ask for anything near what is standard in central London, he said he would need to share the rent. I would have let him stay for whatever he was ready to pay, but he insisted and told me he would find a flatmate.
"Let's get you out of this." John helped him get his shirt out of the way and tossed it across the room. Sherlock yelped when John's mouth made contact with his nipple. John stopped and looked up.
At this time it was rare to have John and Sherlock on a case together. John was living with Mary, and on cases it was often the three of them or, even more often, Sherlock alone.

"If you let me, I'd love to. I won't be giving you marks. I'll just sit here and enjoy the view."
Sherlock could not quite believe it either. "You mean..."
Sherlock let John smear a generous amount of lube onto his right palm.
Sherlock nodded. "Goodbye."
"You have to tell your parents." John had said. And so, Sherlock had called. "Do you want help with organizing the funeral?" John had asked, and Sherlock had given a nod.
"Yes, of course. I wanted everything. I would have taken any risk. But I was not given this choice, and I knew that. Mycroft knew what he was doing and I understand his decision. I loved him for who he was and I accepted that we would not be a couple in the conventional sense. It was good the way it was. And now that I have the confirmation of his feelings for me, the memory of us will always be perfect in my mind."
Thomas offered Sherlock some more of the brandy before refilling his own glass. "This is hard to answer," he said. "I think, by normal standards, it would have been next to nothing. Some subtle flirting maybe. But you cannot measure Mycroft by normal standards. After a year of regular meetings, we were on a first-name basis. He asked me to call him Mycroft. This meant a lot to me. And yet, not many personal details were exchanged. We discussed about politics, the news, the guests of the events we organized. Sometimes, although very rarely, he mentioned details about his work schedule: when he was travelling, for instance. He always told me, as if he were apologizing for not being able to meet me for awhile."
Sherlock blushed some more and listened for any noise coming from the baby monitor at the kitchen table. All quiet.
Now, a week later, Sherlock found himself standing at the grave. John had taken care of everything, invited everyone. There was no priest. The idea of having a religious funeral was slightly ridiculous in Mycroft's case. True to form, Mycroft had not left any directions concerning funeral arrangements. This was only logical. After all, funerals were for the living, not for the dead. There was a speaker leading through the ceremony. He was ex-military. Someone John knew from his time before Sherlock. He spoke about commitment and sense of responsibility. It was oddly fitting, given that it came from someone who had never met Mycroft Holmes.
It took Sherlock an indefinite amount of time and a lot of energy to get up and finish his morning routine. Dressed in black trousers and a white shirt, he stepped into the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson had not brought up tea yet - it had to be very early. He moved to the kettle to make some himself.
"Sherlock, say something, please." John looked concerned.
"Sherlock, stop now, or I'll come down your throat."
Eventually, they ended up standing naked next to Sherlock's bed. Sherlock took a moment to take a closer look at John's more than half hard cock. John seemed pleased with this and gently stroked along Sherlock's side.
"Sit on the bed, will you?"
"Sherlock, I might get this wrong. But are you trying to flirt with me?"
"When we both were in kindergarten. We were friends. But then the family moved to South Africa, and I had not seen him since."
"Oh, nothing in particular." John replies somewhat too quickly. "It was a nice case, wasn't it? Just like old times."
John nodded. "Yes, you should. If you want I can give you the contact information of someone at New Scotland Yard who specialises on that."
Only in recent times, triggered by events that were traumatic for both of them, there was a shift in their relationship. After these events I had the impression, that they openly acknowledged how important they were for each other. Personally, I have no understanding why romantic entanglements are something to be desired. For a long time, I thought that my brother and I were alike in this respect. It appears that I have been mistaken.
"Yes indeed. It was quite satisfactory. Will you put it on the blog?"
Sherlock briefly looks away before continuing to stare him down. "Nothing. I just wanted to remark that it is hardly my fault that you are obviously sexually frustrated."
"More than alright." Sherlock was both relieved and afraid. Relieved because he had found to courage to say what he had meant to say for ages, afraid of John's reaction. He felt a sudden need to qualify his statement. "That is, only if you want to."
"Do you still want to do it this way?" John asked.
"How could you not? Sherlock, you notice
"Anyone your age? Someone you had not seen in a while?"
"Where is Rosie?'' Of all the things he could have said or done, this was what Sherlock's useless brain managed to come up with?
John appeared to be surprised at Sherlock's comment.
When John left the interrogation room to join us, Sherlock seemed like in a trance. It was the first and only time that I saw Sherlock Holmes lost for words. So I had to do all the praising. I patted John on the shoulder and thanked him, while Sherlock stood next to me, speechless.
John sinks back into his chair. This was an unexpected turn of events. John is not sure what has just happened. The front door clicks shut. Sherlock will not come back with biscuits anytime soon. John quickly reminds himself that it is a warm sunny day and that Sherlock was wearing trousers and a shirt and (hopefully) shoes. This means that at least he won't get a call from Greg about a man in pyjamas and a dressing gown running around barefoot in Regent's park. At least one complication avoided this morning.
"What do you want? Don't tell me my brother is meddling from beyond the grave now." Sherlock almost managed the annoyed tone of voice that he had reserved for his brother's entourage.
"Rosie and Mrs. Hudson are going to the zoo," he explained without greeting Sherlock.
"Are you alright?" he asked.
The lay side by side for some time. Sherlock's brain was slowly coming back online - and it had questions.
John and Sherlock arrived on time, impeccably dressed. The dinner took place at a round table accommodating twelve. We were all seated by the staff, but as soon as the waiters stepped away, John and Sherlock simultaneously moved their chairs closer to each other. The manoeuvre was barely noticeable, but they themselves acknowledged it, turning their heads and smiling at each other.
John is caught off-guard and goes into full deflection mode without thinking. "Well, Sherlock, you should not need to ask this question after having chased away every single girl I ever brought here."
"And before you say no." John lifted his index finger in an advance attempt to get Sherlock to shut up. "This is not the first time I have noticed this. And, well, I get the impression that you have been doing this more often lately."
John exhaled loudly and began to stroke Sherlock's chest. Sherlock could not suppress a moan when John brushed his left nipple through the T-shirt. He felt his cock twitch in his pyjama pants. John lifted his head and smiled at Sherlock.
"Bathroom's yours," John said and reached for his phone. Obviously he intended to wait for Sherlock. "And bring a pillow and a blanket."
"When did he die?"
"Well, this is hardly my fault, is it?" Sherlock all but shouts.

On the next morning, after a veritable feast in Sherlock's bedroom and a delicious breakfast at Mrs. Hudson's, John, while holding Sherlock's hand, called a real estate agent in order to get rid of his flat.
Sherlock was slightly confused, but did as he was told. John sat up too.
Sherlock nodded.
"Yeah, I suppose we should." John began to disentangle himself from Sherlock, stopping for another kiss.
Sherlock waited until John continued.
Sherlock opened his legs. John scooted forward, and wrapped his legs around Sherlock. Their cocks and testicles touched this way.
Lestrade was shaking his head in disbelief, when suddenly his expression changed to concern.
"Yeah, we'll see. As I said, I am not looking for anything at the moment." John smiled at Sherlock. "So, are we okay? Can be go back to normal?"
"You mean...
"God, I have to stop watching, or we won't get anywhere near where we want to get." John groaned. "Do you mind if I help a bit?"
Sherlock was about to rest his head on John's shoulder, when they both noticed footsteps on the stairs.
Oh yes, it could have, Sherlock thought. "John, I needed you to be alive." This sounded more like a confession than Sherlock had intended.
John leaned his forehead against Sherlock's and giggled uncontrollably.
"May I?"
John seemed to notice that Sherlock was distracted and stopped moving.
John was right. It was pretty ridiculous. But it made perfect sense. "Yes, let's do that."
Sherlock found his violin and started to play. When it got dark outside he moved to his chair, and just sat there, not really knowing what to do with himself.
Sherlock does not waste a moment and starts moving. John feels electricity run through his body the first time their cocks slide along each other.
"It's alright. I should be on my way." Sherlock felt like a coward. "Thank you for your time."
If only Sherlock had found out in a less explicit way. The whole scene kept replaying in his mind. And why in hell did they have to have anal sex? Didn't this woman have a vagina? If John liked this sort of thing, why did he have to do it with her and not...?
John immediately regrets the last remark. Sherlock's eyes flash up for a moment but he does not seem to want to dwell on the past either.
"Very." There was no point in denying it.
The boy looked up at John, alarmed, and sat up straight, as if facing a superior.
"Ah, this is good. Keep going." Sherlock did and John countered his movements, which made it even better. They were both panting now, urging each other on by soft grunts. It felt amazing, but it was not quite enough. Their cocks did not align properly, and it was a bit dry.
," as his brain supplied him with memories of numerous occasions where John had, in fact, flirted with him.
Oh no. What if Sherlock rolled over in his sleep and wrapped himself around John's deliciously warm body? Or worse, what if he got an erection? Sherlock cursed himself for his own courage.
"Do you you call this honour, cadet?" John did not shout. He merely raised his voice. John is never loud in such situations, but he does make it clear who is in charge.
John notices a slight upwards twitch of Sherlock's lips before he resumes his frozen expression. John makes himself count back from five. Then he takes a step forward. "Alright. I am going to kiss you now."
"That would be great. Thank you, Mrs. Hudson." Sherlock was grateful that John did all the talking.
"Can't."
Hope to see you all at the wedding!
"Sherlock." John's voice was calm and commanding now. "Unless you have serious doubts about this whole thing, could you please stop analysing and get the hell on with what you've been doing? Because it's bloody hot, you know."
Sherlock gathered his courage and reached for John's left shoulder. A faint touch. Soft. Warm. Calm. Sherlock tilted his head a little. He noticed that John did the same. And then they were kissing. It was an innocent kiss. Tender and chaste. No tongue, no teeth, just lips on lips. Sherlock knew he would treasure this moment for the rest of his life. What an idiot he had been to keep this from himself and from John for so long! Sherlock broke the kiss and crushed John in his arms. He noticed that he was shaking. He tightened his grip on John. John held him firmly.
He handed the phone to Sherlock.
"What?"
"It's alright, John." John had no idea how right it had been. Sherlock wanted to have John's arm back. He cursed himself for waking John up. How wonderful it would have been to spend the night with John in his arms. Sherlock closed his eyes and imagined hugging John tightly to himself.
Sherlock was yawning again. He cursed his exhausted transport. Sleeping was the last thing he wanted to do right now, but it seemed that his body did not give him a choice.
He pushes Sherlock towards the sofa and they sit down facing each other and kiss some more. John's hands start to explore Sherlock's back and torso. Sherlock seems to be too shy or too overwhelmed to reciprocate. It looks like he is completely lost in the sensation. John can barely believe his luck to be allowed to see this. After a while Sherlock slowly reclines on the sofa and pulls John on top of him. John very much approves of the change of position. He takes the opportunity to open the two top buttons of Sherlock's shirt and assaults his neck with his mouth.
Sherlock kept staring at the letter. He had always thought that his brother was above emotion. It was unreal and intimidating to see that he was a human being after all. Sherlock swallowed then looked over to the man beside him.
Sherlock was not stupid. He had expected this to happen sooner or later. John was a catch: physically attractive, middle-aged doctor, devoted father, and for all Sherlock could tell from the very recent first-hand, or rather second-hand, experience, a sex god. No wonder that every boring teacher, every sexually frustrated divorced house wife, every career woman with a ticking biological clock, every psychotic assassin-turned-nurse-turned-assassin was after John.
"This is fantastic," John moaned while he kissed along Sherlock's neck. "Let's get you out of these clothes."
"No, definitely not."
"To Mycroft," Thomas said. "To Mycroft," Sherlock replied. They drank.
"Why did you stop?" John sounded out of breath, and annoyed.
"Alright." Sherlock said and nodded.
"Are you sure?" John was grinning. Why was he grinning?
For some reason this made Sherlock extremely happy. He had to restrain himself from kissing John. Being in bed with him made this considerably harder.
That's when the boy broke down. He talked for an hour. Terrible things. John helped him through it, asking the right questions at the right time, reassuring him when necessary.
Sherlock leaned over to John's side (there was a "John's side" now) to do as he was told. John turned off the main light, which bathed the room in a soft yellow glow. Then he walked across the room and got into bed with Sherlock as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
John's reaction was vocal. "Fuck, Sherlock," he groaned.
After a week the stalking stopped. Much later, John confessed to me that Sherlock did not take my case because he found it exciting ("barely a three"). He rather was interested in my profession. I don't think it is a big secret that Sherlock has his eyes and ears all over London. He simply wanted to recruit me. Well, it worked and I am even happier about the friendship has that developed over the years.
"Your what?" John looked very confused. Little crinkles formed on the bridge of his nose.
Sherlock looked up. A client? That would be a welcome distraction. "Yes, Mrs. Hudson."
"My brother had this delivered to me this morning." The man looked at it and smiled fondly.
"Good." John said and got up from his chair. He pointed in the general direction of their (newly repaired) bathroom. "I'll just get ready."
"Fuck, you're hot." Sherlock felt himself blush.
"So, what have you been up to all day?" John finally asked, after he had finished eating his chilli chicken.
"I heard you." Sherlock remarks.  "Your living room is below my bedroom."
Sherlock did not know how to respond to that. Thomas noticed. "I am sorry. I made you uncomfortable."
"Yeah. I have to say, I was not really picky when it came to sex back in those days. I took every chance that presented itself. Got me quite a reputation. Girls do like soldiers. But the thing is, out in the desert, you won't find that many. But," John looked Sherlock straight in the eye, "there are other opportunities, and I found that I enjoyed them just as much as the girls."
John was still staring at him in disbelief. "I, ..., yes, of course. I did not know you..."
They climbed the stairs in silence. John's bedroom door was open. John stepped inside, but stopped right after crossing the threshold. Sherlock stood next to him, pillow and blanket in his hands. He did not know what the protocol was. Neither did John, it seemed. So they just stood there, staring at John's bed. The bed was a bit smaller than Sherlock's but looked comfortable enough. It was pushed into the far right corner of the small room, so one could only get in from the left side. There was a bedside table with two books, a box of tissues and a water bottle on it.
"Thank you for listening." Thomas' voice was filled with honest gratitude. "Nobody knew about this thing between us. Not friends, not family, not colleagues. I am not entitled to grieve for him, because officially there was no connection. You are probably the only person who will ever know. I am glad that somebody knows."
Sherlock only saw one option. In other circumstances he would have been appalled by his own lack of control. Now all he could do was to act on his base instincts. He opened his trousers, shoved them down around his knees, and reached into his pants to pull out his cock.
Twenty minutes later Sherlock found himself in a street that was lined with a string of identical-looking narrow houses. He rang the doorbell. After a few moments the man from the funeral opened the door. Sherlock's brain went into action. Personal grooming indicates meticulous attention to detail and manners. Not pets, at least no hairy ones. Frequent traveller. Married. Married? That did not make any sense. Everything in his appearance indicated that the man was unattached and living for whatever the Foreign Office employed him for. Where had this come from? Sherlock scanned the person in front of him again and found the origin of the deduction: a simple golden ring on the man's right hand. It looked like a wedding band. Actually, it looked exactly like the ring that Mycroft had been wearing for eight years. Until his death. Sherlock had been curious when he had first noticed the ring on Mycroft. It had been clear that Mycroft had expected him to ask about it. So, of course, Sherlock had not asked. Mycroft, however, had made sure that there hadn't been any clues from which Sherlock could have deduced the story behind the ring. A case unsolved. Until today.
"Can I move?" John asked.
"Sherlock, stop deducing my wanking habits while we are having sex."
John took hold of his softening penis to keep the condom from slipping off. He was preparing to collapse on the bed when he became aware of Sherlock's presence.
Sherlock had no objections.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Really? John. As if that was my fault -  and you know that very well. And, by the way, you have not been on a date for months."
They looked at each other in silence. John was exceptionally beautiful this way, all quiet and relaxed. There was a content smile on his lips. Sherlock could not help but smile back.
I think they had completely forgotten about my presence by then, so immersed were they in their conversation. They kept constant eye contact, while their smiles grew wider and wider. They also moved towards each other. Their knees almost touching.
How could John even get the idea that this could not be okay? "Yes, please."
Sherlock watched his parents' car leave. "Shall we go, Sherlock?" John asked.
"Good."
"Did you really just solve Monroe's case for him? He was supposed to do that himself! It was trivial! My whole department has given up on thinking. Instead, they contact Sherlock Holmes. What was it? A Four?"
"Does not matter," Sherlock said. "Was it a big funeral?"
John can't get himself to be embarrassed. He is actually rather proud of himself.
Sherlock looked straight at John. Another dramatic intake of breath. "I have come to understand that my brother was an idiot."
"No?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow. That was news to him.
"Yeah, I did. So did she. It was a pretty decent shag, I would say."
The corners of Sherlock's mouth moved upwards. I noticed that his breathing was slightly accelerated. At first I thought, that he was excited about John's approach to get the boy to talk. In hindsight, I would say he was just excited about John (yes, I know what I'm implying).
"You think you are defending some twisted concept of honour. Instead, you bring shame upon the armed forces. You, and your comrades, and the superiors that allow this to happen."
Sherlock smiled. "No, I did not. But that does not mean that I did not jump at the opportunity when it presented itself."
"Wait, I have an idea. Sit up."
John tries to convince himself that mulling over the issue won't be of any use for now. After all, Sherlock is the big unknown in the equation. Before he comes back, nothing can be done. John decides that it is best to go on with his relaxing day and runs himself a bath. No better way to shut off unpleasant thoughts and worries. Only today this does not work at all for John. He is soaking in the scented water and finds that he is downright nervous about the things to come.
Sherlock felt cornered. He was about to deny everything. However, John did not sound as if he was accusing Sherlock of anything. He merely seemed to state a fact. Sherlock had to admit to himself that John was not wrong. Perhaps it was time for a counter attack.
"Could you turn on the bedside lamp, please?"
"Shit," he said to himself.
Of course he did. "Of course I did."
"Yes, um, yeah, of course. If you don't mind. Sure."
Sherlock removed his fingers and waited to see what John had in mind. John sat up and knelt between Sherlock's legs. He lubed up his fingers.
John also seemed to be at a loss. He licked his lower lip and tentatively moved in Sherlock's direction.
"Sherlock, is something wrong?"
"Your father, when did he die?" Sherlock sounded impatient.
"In heat and desperate to mate," Sherlock supplied.
They left together, laughing and bumping against each other as soon as they were out on the street. John and my brother were not living together at that time, but I was under the impression that they had the same destination. It seems that I was slightly ahead with my assumptions. However, it was only a matter of weeks, until John and Rosamund became permanent residents at Baker Street.
-face. Sherlock reached for his jacket on the desk behind him and retrieved the sheet of paper he had been given this morning.
There was a knock at the door. "Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson peeked through the living room door. "Sherlock. There is someone who wants to see you. Can I let him in?"
Sherlock could not believe his luck. He scooted backwards and bent down. Wasting no time, he took John in his mouth.
"Don't worry," John added. "We're just going to scare him a little. You'll see."
The person responsible for the woman's state was there too. Only then Sherlock became fully aware of John. John, equally naked, was kneeling behind the woman, deeply involved in what looked like the final moments of sexual intercourse. The bright daylight coming from the window exposed every feature of John's face. His eyes were half-closed, his brows furrowed in concentration. His mouth was half open, and he was panting heavily with each push as he was driving into the woman from behind. John was slightly hunched over the woman's back, his hands gripping her hips to keep her in place. The muscles of his buttocks contracted rhythmically as he pushed into her in short, hard strokes. Sherlock could see John's penis, long and thick, slide in and out of the woman's body - in and out of a very specific part of her. Sherlock had to blink to confirm: John was having anal sex and obviously enjoyed it.
Mr. Alcott took a long moment to answer. "Yes, I suppose I did, but not at first. I do not need to tell you how hard to read your brother can be, even for those who are close to him. Whatever "close" means in connection with Mycroft Holmes. That's why this confession means to world to me. I just wish it had not come under these tragic circumstances."
Best wishes,
"He said he understood and accepted Mycroft's decision." Why was Sherlock defending his brother?
"Anything useful?" John stood next to the fridge, dressed in his old bathrobe, hair still wet.
John forced Sherlock to face him. He looked very serious. "Yes, Sherlock, that's probably true. So let me be very clear. This is what I want. This is what I have wanted for a long time. I would not want it any other way. No matter what will happen. You are not responsible for me." John grabbed his face and kissed him. Forcefully. Passionately. Sherlock's world was spinning.
When the port arrived, John and Sherlock had dropped most of the etiquette and were communicating in barely concealed snorts and giggles. Fortunately, smoking is out of fashion, even in these circles. If there had been cigars, John and Sherlock may have cost me my membership.
Sherlock was about to figure out the code, when I noticed a pattern myself -- not on the model's body but rather in Sherlock's motions. He seemed to position himself in such a way that, whenever he bent over the corpse, his behind was directed at John. John seemed to notice too. He was more careful after I had caught him staring, but he still managed to look up precisely at  the right moments to catch an eyeful.
"Yes." Actually, Sherlock was not sure if he was really ready.
"One of her most appreciated qualities." John's post-coital giggles were even more enticing than his usual ones.
All John can manage is a breathy "Oh, god, yes" before they are both reduced to grunts. John lets himself get carried away for several moments but then he gets an idea.
I was a bit curious about who Sherlock would bring. So I shamefully admit that I went upstairs and positioned myself at the sitting room window to get a first glance at this person. On this occasion I noticed that someone had made a mighty mess out of the flat: piles of books and papers everywhere, moving boxes all over the place. The kitchen looked as if it had been turned into a chemistry lab. And there was a skull sitting on the mantelpiece. A human skull, can you imagine? I have had my share of unconventional living arrangements, but I was slightly worried about what kind of people I had allowed into my house.
John was there too, of course, looking tired and grumpy. Back then he was still trying (and failing) to schedule his medical work around Sherlock. He did not seem to like the idea of spending the evening in the morgue. On the other hand, he could just have refused to come, but he did not. Well, to be honest, the same was true for me, too. It seems that neither of us can say no to Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson decides to make a hasty escape. "Well, I'd better go back downstairs. If you'd like some biscuits you know where to find me."
I noticed embarrassingly late. Sherlock would say it's because I'm an idiot. In this case, however, Sherlock is actually the bigger idiot, because he noticed even later than I did.
Sherlock grinned and sighed in relief. He realized that he was a bit clueless about what to do next.
Indeed, there is no stopping Sherlock now. "Really, Mrs. Hudson, at your age one might think you would appreciate the comfort of a bed. With your hip and..."
After Sherlock had stopped talking, John was staring at him in utter disbelief. Sherlock waited for him to say something. Nothing. Just more staring.
John gave him a slow, lingering kiss. "I'm glad you did. It took us long enough."
"Yes." Sherlock said and followed John's lead. Few words were exchanged as the small group of attendants bid their farewells. Lestrade said he would call next week. Molly just gave him a long look, which said enough. Mrs. Hudson announced that she would go back to Baker Street with Molly and Lestrade. A long hug from his mother and father. "Take care of him," his mother said to John, who just smiled in response.
For better or worse, John seemed to have enough courage for both of them.
"Just answer his question, please,'' John said in a soothing voice. "Trust me, he knows what he is doing." He seemed to have some experience in dealing with such situations.
They got up. Thomas went to fetch Sherlock's coat and accompanied him to the door. "Give my regards to Doctor Watson. We have never met, of course, but Mycroft seemed to think highly of him."
"We did not make it to the bedroom."
John was kissing his neck now. His hand was moving down do grab hold of both their cocks.
The next morning John is having breakfast. He hasn't felt so full of energy in a long time, which is surprising, given the fact that he has barely slept last night. They have spent the night in Sherlock's bed. There were kisses and declarations and tears and blow jobs and a few unspeakable things that John can hardly believe they did on their first night together. John does not even try to wipe the dopey grin off his face. Across from him, a slightly debauched Sherlock is wolfing down his breakfast, which, as usual, makes John ridiculously happy.
While he was waiting for the water to boil, he weighed his options. He knew that he would have to face John at some point. Sherlock did not find it realistic to act as if nothing had happened. He was a great actor, but in his current state he did not believe that he could pull this off. Also, John would not let him do this anyway, not after Sherlock had reacted the way he had.
John continued. "It is up to you to make it better. Not just for yourself, but also for those who come after you. You can make a difference if you help us now."
The height difference proved to be a nuisance. Sherlock wanted to press his whole body against John, but it either worked for the top half or the bottom half, not for both.
"I did." Mrs. Hudson says. "And look at me politely ignoring it."
John moved a step closer."Ready?".
"How far past?"
"Not physically." Sherlock said at the same time.
"Okay, time to shut you up. Give me the bottle. And hold out your hand."
After John had left, Sherlock moved to his chair. He was intent on doing some work, but his mind had decided to obsess about the funeral. This mysterious man standing in the distance. Who was he? Sherlock had never seen him before. His facial expression had been well-guarded but still he had looked like someone who had known Mycroft, and was affected by his death. A friend? Definitely not an enemy.
"John, this woman was clearly not a prostitute. Are telling me you just picked a random woman in the street and had sex with her?"
John just smiles and shakes his head. Sherlock is right. The pots certainly have seen worse. And Sherlock's idea to lure that cannibalistic lunatic into Baker Street was just too brilliant, abuse of kitchenware notwithstanding.
John fumbled with the buttons of Sherlock's shirt. As soon as he had pried the first two open, Sherlock pulled the shirt over his head and threw it on the floor.
And so it ends, Sherlock thought.
"Do you call this honour? To let yourself be abused and to abuse in turn. All, because it's tradition."
Stopping was the last thing on Sherlock's mind. All he wanted was for John to give up his last bit of control. He moaned around John's cock at this prospect.
"Could you get naked? Please?"
"Yes and no." Thomas said. "You are right in the sense that he had an army of people to work out the details for him. But he was always informed about everything. He knew what he wanted, and what he did not want. Mycroft had various teams working for him. I was the head of such a team. There were regular briefings with him. Usually, these happened at the Foreign Office, and the whole team had to be present."
It was a case, a gruesome one: initiation ritual in the military gone completely out of hand. A young recruit dead, everyone kept their mouths shut: the other recruits, their families, the superiors. We got hold of a young boy as a suspect. His body also showed clear signs of abuse. We wanted to get him to talk with the prospect of mitigating circumstances. He didn't cooperate.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock. I did not mean to assault you in your sleep. I swear, this has never happened before."
"Case," Sherlock muttered and kept walking. He was not in the mood to talk to Lestrade.
"It was actually a bit surreal. Molly had insisted on taking Rosie, said that I needed some time for myself. So I went to the coffee shop to get some breakfast, and well, there was this woman in the queue behind me. They had some technical problems, and we had to wait for quite some time. So we chatted a bit, and it was nice, and both or us seemed to be in the same mood..."
"I think I can take care of myself for the next eight hours. I'll go through some old case files or something."
Sherlock looked at John. "You wanted this to happen?"
"Barely a Two,'' Sherlock corrected. Only Lestrade could believe this sad excuse for a case was a Four.
I do confess that searched the internet for information on John and Sherlock being a couple right after the meeting. I found a lot of gossip. All wrong, as I found out later.
"High-rank diplomat. He was the one who arranged for the right people to meet. This is where I came in. I was in charge of organizing the actual events. Balls, official receptions, less official dinners, dinners that officially never took place." He smiled. "The latter ones in particular."
Thankfully, Sherlock's phone buzzed before he could finish the thought. It was an email from Sergeant Monroe (for some reason his nickname was Marilyn), a new member of Lestrade's team. He requested help on a case. Sherlock took a brief look through the file attached to the message and shook his head. Barely a Two, maybe even a One. It had become a recent fashion among London's criminals to report the crimes they had committed to the police in order be excluded as possible suspects. It worked remarkably well with the idiots from NSY.
Three days later, Sergeant Monroe got an email from Sherlock, suggesting a career in garbage disposal. Greg was relieved.
It was my responsibility to arrange a dinner in honour of John and Sherlock. The attendance more than illustrious. Sherlock is renowned for his inappropriate behaviour at such events. In such situations John sees his responsibility in damage control, doing his best to avert at least some of my brother's shenanigans. Since I was deeply indebted to John for the role he played in this delicate case, I wanted to make this evening as agreeable as possible for all of us.
Sherlock could relate. "Did you ask him about it?"
Thomas smiled again. "No it was not. At first, there were more excuses. But soon our meetings became his last appointment of the day. And they started to take longer than strictly necessary. By that time I was already in deep, concerning my feelings for him."
"You know very well, why." John replied, ignoring Sherlock's acerbic tone.
Sherlock reached over to look at his phone. It had been two hours. "I guess we should get up."
This sleeping arrangement was far from optimal, in particular for John's shoulder. Sherlock had a very clear idea on how to resolve the issue, but he was not sure if John was open to such a radical measure.
"No. But could you..." Sherlock hesitated.
"Okay, I think it would be best if you started with what you are used to. It will make it easier for you to relax."
It happened so quickly that Sherlock's brain needed a moment to catch up. Then a dam broke.
"Um, yes, but what does this have to do with..."
"Did you ever want it to be more?" Why did that matter to Sherlock?
The rest is well-known history. John did move in, just as Sherlock had predicted, and they became the detective and the blogger. I was optimistic that they would eventually figure out the rest, too. There were so many moments where I thought they already had, and it still hurts me to know what they to go through, before they finally got what they had wanted from the very beginning. How they managed in the end, is their story to tell, but I am quite certain that I was the first to know.
******
"Great." John smiled. "I think we're good to go."
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. "I have to admit that I had not anticipated that you would be so affected." Sherlock waited for John's anger to hit him with full force.
John is really good at these things. He has a calm authority about him. He said he understood the situation the boy was in, that it is understandable that he did not want to betray his comrades and that he did not question the authority of his superiors, but in this case a crime had happened and it was his duty to help with the investigation.
John chuckles. "Yeah we did. Sorry about your shirt."
"Thank you Mrs. Hudson," John shouted. "If you don't mind, that would be appreciated."
Sherlock turns and looks up at her. "You heard us." he states matter-of-factly.
John's mouth opened and closed for a few times while he was processing the information.
"Stay."
They held on to each other while they tried to get their breath back.
"Unexpected."
John's face lit up. He moved to the edge of his seat, eyebrows raised. "Go on," he said.
! How could you miss
There seemed to be a brief flash of regret on John's face. Sherlock did not know what to make of this. Perhaps he was beginning to hallucinate in his sleep-deprived state. What Sherlock's fatigued brain also noticed somewhat delayed was that John had just invited Sherlock into his bed. And that Sherlock's reply had clearly implied that Sherlock had not considered the idea of sharing.
John giggled. "Yeah, you do. I should make a blog entry dedicated to living weapons."
John is so happy he could cry. He can barely stop himself from throwing strings of romantic declarations at Sherlock. Oxytocin. From the way Sherlock is hiding his face, John suspects that he may be in a similar state. John thinks it might be a little too soon for such an outburst of emotion and contents himself with stroking Sherlock's back.
John smiled, a hint of sadness flashing across his face.
"Irrelevant. When did your father die?"
"Yes, a few people actually."
way. He tried to push all the images of
"I'm fine.'' Sherlock, to his embarrassment, yawned again. "I can sleep in my chair for a while."
"Ready?" John asked.
"What about me?" John raised an eyebrow.
After Mrs. Hudson has left the kitchen John takes a deep breath. Time for some damage control. He looks at Sherlock who seems to be slowly recovering from his stasis.
John blushed a little.
Sherlock put a new slide into the microscope. His collection was coming along nicely. He had not anticipated that the arrival of an infant in his life would actually benefit his research. The regular walks in Regent's park with Rosie and John had given him the idea. Five more months, and his chronology of soil samples would be complete. The seasonal changes in pollen, fungi and microbes were fascinating.
"And with that, we say our final good-bye to our beloved friend and family member." The word "beloved" brought Sherlock's focus back to the coffin that was disappearing into the ground in front of him. Was Mycroft a beloved person? Respected certainly. Needed for sure, by many people including Sherlock himself. Needed even by whole countries. These would have to do without him now, just like Sherlock.
"Mycroft." Sherlock said to the empty room, shaking his head. Leave it to his brother to present Sherlock with a mystery surrounding his own death. Before he could really think about it, Sherlock was out of the door, telling the cabbie to take him to the address in the file.
Mrs. Hudson stepped away from the kitchen door and moved upstairs to check on Rosie. Once she was out of hearing range, John turned on his side to give Sherlock a lingering kiss.
Recently, Sherlock had observed that these late afternoons tended to extend into early evenings, until Rosie demanded her dinner. After feeding her, John usually was reluctant to transport his sleepy daughter back to his flat, which meant that he would spend the night on Sherlock's sofa.
Sherlock had not been affected by the incident. He had been busy spotting criminals in the park. (Today's catch: under-worked border collie, suffering from a lack of sheep to herd, with a habit of stealing the son's plush toys and burying them in the garden.) He had only noticed when confronted with a pair of mud-covered Watsons, the elder being quite keen on returning to Baker Street, while he was recounting the events, trying hard to avoid all too graphic expletives.
I also could have noticed after Sherlock had died and John was so obviously heart-broken. But, for all I knew, Sherlock was dead, and any speculation was moot anyway. John never said anything, and I did not ask.
"A Two? And you came here for that? If anything, you should have told Marilyn that he's an idiot. Would have been well-deserved for once."
I decided to walk into the room to interfere. John had just discovered the skull. Sherlock was stumbling over his words. It was clear to me that they wanted to move in together, but did not quite know how to accomplish this. So I did my best to make John feel welcome. I asked if he liked the flat and pointed out the second bedroom.
"Sherlock, I believe that you are flirting with me. I believe that you have been doing so for quite some time. I may have been stupid for not noticing sooner. But Sherlock, you know what?"
Thomas smiled. "You should thank Mycroft. In case you feel like talking about your brother at some point, you know where to find me."
"Sherlock, please, one second..." he breathes.
It was John's typical mix of anger and sarcasm that brought Sherlock back to his senses. He turned on his heels and fled the scene. He was halfway through the flat when he noticed the tight feeling in his trousers.
The boy looked scared. John did not back off.
"Well, obviously, yes." Sherlock was aware that he had a penis and no breasts and that his voice was lower.
John sank down onto the floor, panting. He seemed barely conscious. Sherlock let him go, his own neglected arousal suddenly becoming painfully obvious. He was rock-hard in his pants, his penis straining against its confines an a rather unpleasant way.
John was the first to be capable of speech again. "God, this was amazing."
I met John and Sherlock as a client. A few years ago I had a problem with a stalker. I am a bicycle courier. My job is to transport documents between companies across town. I usually do not know any details about these documents, but when I urgently have to go back and forth between banks, government agencies and company headquarters, I can tell that I am not just transporting the canteen menu.
One of the most demanding ordeals of my profession is that, from time to time, people feel the need to thank me. On this particular occasion, also John and Sherlock's presence was required. They had played a key role in capturing one of the most dangerous criminals of our time, after she had managed to escape from a high-security facility.
"John, I think you are misunderstanding because you lack some information. What I saw yesterday or what you just told me did not shock me. It just made me realize that this is something I want for myself."
"Alright then. I'll bring some take-away for dinner."
The first course was accompanied by a deduction of a waiter's family life, based on a barely visible stain on his sleeve. With a raised eyebrow Sherlock directed John's attention to where he wanted to have it. When John gave Sherlock a questioning look, Sherlock mouthed the word "Rosie". John understood immediately. As a result, both of them were grinning like fools, the kind of smile you often see in young parents, who have the irritating ability to be proud of everything in connection with their offspring, even the excretions the child produces in abundance.
Sherlock was taken aback by the force of John's reaction. He did not know what to say. Sarcasm maybe? "Well, that's not exactly news."
"Sherlock, please. Please, let me." Sherlock let go of himself.
"Good night, John."
John hugged Sherlock tightly against his chest. "Then let's not stop."
John seemed to stare directly at Sherlock, who was rooted to the spot, motionless, mouth half open.
"Oh," John said with a sheepish grin, "but I don't have a girlfriend. If I had, you'd probably know before me."
John stroked over Sherlock's back and placed a gentle kiss on his coccyx.  He heard John fidget with the condom and the lube. He held on to Sherlock's hips and placed his cock between Sherlock's arse cheeks.
John reached over to switch off the lamp.
Sherlock complied, and John followed suit, grabbing the bottle of lube.
"Two months ago. Why?" John smiled.
We went upstairs. John acted as if he had not seen the flat before. I found that rather confusing. While Sherlock had clearly stated that John was his new flatmate, John was seemingly unaware of this.
John takes a close look at Sherlock and tries to find out what's wrong. His eyes search Sherlock's flushed face, then move lower, where he finds a possible explanation. Sherlock's bespoke trousers are very ...  revealing. There is a clearly visible bulge straining the front. It looks wonderfully obscene. John has to stop himself from falling down on his knees and burying his face there. John's already very interested cock threatens to make an appearance through the front of his dressing gown. However, in view of Sherlock's embarrassment, John rather decides to take a deep breath to calm himself. He looks Sherlock in the eye and waves his hand in the general direction of his crotch.
Sherlock was well aware that the problem was on his side. A year ago, he would have disappeared into his room for an epic sulk. But a lot had happened. John and Sherlock were different people now. They had been through some of the worst experiences of their lives, and they had survived. Together. Sherlock did not want to risk the new trust they had in one another by not being honest.
"Sherlock, you have not slept in two days. Since we have finished eating, you have been yawning every two minutes." Sherlock looked up and found John's raised eyebrows aimed at him.
Sherlock must have fallen asleep again. When he opened his eyes it was bright day outside and John was about to disentangle himself from Sherlock. Sherlock stretched his legs in order to let John know that he was awake.
He had always been showing off like that, in this very physical way. However, it was my impression that this behaviour had been intensifying with the appearance of John. And here comes the part that is embarrassing for me. I thought that Sherlock did it all for my benefit. I had been subtly communicating my interest for quite some time, and I actually believed that he was flirting with me.
In the end they somehow managed to pull their heads out of their respective arses without my help. We are all very happy about this, and it is an honour to be Sherlock's best man. (And damn you, Mike, for having this idea. What am I supposed to come up with now?)
Mr. Alcott laughed. A sad laugh. "You should call me Thomas."
Sherlock understood. He reached behind himself to retrieve a bottle of lube from the drawer in the nightstand.
Sherlock blinked. "The army?"
John reached between them with his left hand to align himself and pushed. Nothing could have prepared Sherlock for the feeling of John inside of him - full and hot and tight, every tiny motion sent shivers through his body. Sherlock's cock was throbbing and leaked copiously onto the sheets. Once John was all the way in, he reached around to grab Sherlock's cock. Sherlock instinctively pushed forward.
He reaches for the button of Sherlock's trousers.
"I don't understand," John said.
Sherlock knew that history would repeat itself, preferably without him being shot in the heart this time. John wanted to have a family and a stable home for Rosie. To be honest, Sherlock had hoped that it would not happen at all. He had hoped that John would be as content with their life as Sherlock had been up to this morning. Of course, Sherlock's rational mind knew that he was fooling himself. A new woman in John's life was to be expected, and now she was there. End of story.
There is a knock at the kitchen door. John actually has to say "Come in." before Mrs. Hudson dares to enter the flat with a tray of freshly baked scones in her hands.
"Good night, Sherlock."
"No, he did not." Sherlock still did not see why John was so upset. "He protected him."
John giggled. Sherlock loved John's giggles.
"Male, of course." Of course.
"No I have not. But you obviously masturbate in here on a regular basis, as I can tell from the strategically placed box of tissues. Knowing that you fully indulge in any of your pastimes it was obvious that there would be a bottle of high-grade lubricant in here."
"God, John." Sherlock moans.
Sherlock smiled. There had been a time when John had not been in the mood to quietly joke about the incident. "Yes, it's a bit more relaxed without the snake."
There was a brief flash of sadness and regret in the man's features. "To be honest, no. It did not occur to me. I thought I was special in the sense that I seemed to be the only one to meet him in a private setting. But I had no way of confirming this to be true. It was easy to discard any signs I thought I had received from him as wishful thinking." He took a deep breath before continuing. "And then he started to wear the ring. I was devastated when I first saw it."
It sounded like a challenge, something Sherlock normally would accept with enthusiasm. Now, his courage had disappeared without a trace.
John, on the other hand, seemed to insist on his heterosexuality. Despite his jealousy towards anyone who dared to approach Sherlock, he seemed unable to make the obvious connection.
He leaned forward and braced himself on his left arm, hovering above John's limp body, and stroked himself with his right hand. It would only be a matter of moments. Sherlock felt a tingling sensation throughout his body. He was so close. A few rough pulls was all it would take.
? And by the way, I do hope all the pots I used for making this breakfast have been disinfected by you as promised."
"I, ..., um, wouldn't that be a bit ridiculous? I mean, we have spent so many nights together. You know, when we were on stake-outs. And that was in places where there was much less space. And, well, if you don't mind, I mean, we would be asleep anyway..."
, and that this something felt amazing.
John thought for a moment, then started to laugh when he understood what Sherlock meant. "Yes, but that was not for sleeping. And, technically, it was not just the two of us."
After two weeks I got worried. I am not easily scared and physically fit. I would have dealt with him myself, if he had exhibited any threatening behaviour. However, he did not do anything other than follow me. I suspected that he was after the documents I was carrying.
"Shit. Mrs. Hudson!" John lifted his head to inspect the mess they were in.
"Yes, that's what I thought too, until I got this message from your brother yesterday night."
Sherlock was lying on his back, staring at the ceiling and waited for John to turn off the light. He was surprised as he felt John turn onto his side to face in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock hesitated for a moment and then turned towards John.
It was then that I realised that whatever happened between those two had to be more than friendship and mutual appreciation. It felt... complicated. In fact, it was more complicated that I could have imagined. Sadly, it had to get so much worse before it got better.
"Well, and this is the end of the story of Mycroft Holmes and Thomas Alcott." Thomas said with a half-smile.
The kiss lasted for a long glorious moment. John pulled away to face Sherlock once more. "I know it's a bit ridiculous," he said, "but let's go and visit Mycroft's grave tomorrow. I feel like I have to thank him in person."
John moves a step closer and runs his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "And by the way, Sherlock, this was not just a kiss. I am pretty sure the universe just came crashing down on us."
"I think we have to talk about what happened yesterday," John continued. He moved to sit down in his chair.
John froze. He turned his head to look directly at Sherlock. Sherlock held his gaze and tried hard not to give away his current state of panic.
John shook his head and laughed. "You may not believe it, but yes, this is pretty much what happened. And, for the record, she picked me."
"Well, instead of making tea, you are leaning up against the kitchen counter, posing like a bloody supermodel, with your bespoke trousers and your tight shirts and your neck, and..."
In case anyone is interested in how Sherlock knew about my father's death. He had noticed that I was wearing a necklace with a wedding ring. By its size and overall appearance he knew it was man's and that is was at least twenty years old. He correctly deduced that I wore it in memory of my recently deceased father.
Sherlock was relieved for about one second. Then the gravity of what had just happened hit him. He was going to share a bed with John Watson. John would be sleeping less than a metre away from him. Close enough to touch, close enough to smell.
"Thank you, John." Sherlock said, looking out of the window. He felt the brush of a hand along his sleeve. "Anytime."
"Yes, for a long time."
"No, we don't," John said, "but it would practical to use it, at least for the first time. It will be more comfortable for you, you know, after. Also, it might make me last a bit longer."
"Jesus." John breathed, and planted his mouth on Sherlock's right nipple. Sherlock saw stars. The sensation went straight to his groin. He had to bite on his lip to stifle a loud groan.
Stupid. Stupid! Sherlock was suddenly very awake. For years (literal years!) Sherlock's mind had been very creative in coming up with scenarios where they found themselves in some confined space, which, depending on the situation, ended in tearful love confessions. Or vigorous fucking. Or both. Real life, however, had not followed the cliche. It rather involved Sherlock making a mess of the sheets, or the shower. Tearful events may also have occurred, but Sherlock did not like to be reminded of that. An now the cliche had presented itself on a silver platter and Sherlock had reacted in the worst possible way.
"Yes. Why?"
It was during a case that John would later call "The Case of the Coded Tattoo Model". You can read about it on the blog. It was a really nice one, just what Sherlock likes. The victim was a twenty-two-year-old tattoo model. His whole body was covered with a spider web tattoo. It was extremely realistic: very symmetric at first sight, but if you looked closely, you would find irregularities. There were even tattooed insects that where "caught" in the spider web. Cause of death: poisoning by a rare radioactive substance.
"No."
John shot him an annoyed glance. "Yeah, I guess you could say so. Anyway, once we got our coffees, she asked if she could join me. And, well, you know how it ended."
"Now do what you did before." John whispers.
Mike Stamford
Over the past few months their relationship had grown in many respects. One aspect was Sherlock's involvement in Rosie's upbringing. Also, John seemed more open in general. He confided in Sherlock on personal issues more often. Sherlock did not hesitate to do the same. He was grateful, that he did not have to shoulder his complicated family situation all on his own.
They tried kissing first, but soon it became too much, and they were reduced to moans. Sherlock felt his orgasm build at an alarming speed. He grunted a warning to John.
The story I want to tell may be a little embarrassing for me. But this is for John and Sherlock, so I am happy to make a bit of a fool of myself.
"Alright, now spread your legs for me."
Sherlock was suddenly very aware of the fact that they were not in a presentable state, not to mention that Mrs. Hudson had probably heard everything. Weren't old people supposed to be deaf?
The situation became a bit complicated then. John, assuming that the mess belonged to a previous tenant, said something about cleaning out. At the same moment, Sherlock blurted out that he had already moved in. They both looked quite embarrassed after this awkward exchange. It was adorable how they tried to righten the situation. Sherlock (our Sherlock!) actually made a hastened attempt to get his mess under control. It was the first and last time for me to witness Sherlock Holmes make an effort to get this place in order. John just looked around, trying to ignore the situation.
"Baker Street," the cabbie said, turning around to face Sherlock.
"Mr. Holmes?"
Sherlock felt a sudden need to look anywhere but at John. His cheeks felt hot. Was he blushing? The silence was awkward. He was supposed to say something.
"Is it a bad idea?" John asked.
"My judgement may have been tainted,'' he said, hesitantly. "When it comes to deducing other people, a certain personal distance is essential. I have trouble maintaining that when it comes to you. Always had." There. It was out. Sort of, at least.
John raised his eyebrows in concern. "You know, this does not convince me. Is there anything else? It's okay if there is."
"Do you think rituals like this make you a better soldier? Do you think you will be able to trust these people in the battlefield? After what they've done to you?"
"No need to be alarmed, Sherlock." John tries his best to sound calm and reasonable, which turns out to be rather challenging. "I was not making a pass at you. I was merely commenting on the fact that the only person getting laid in this house is our 79-year-old landlady."
"Yes, for example. If you'd like that. It would be a bit different though."
Sherlock looked down at himself. Right. His pyjama pants. They were tented in quite an obscene manner. Sherlock stood up on John's bed and made a show of pulling them off. John giggled.
This did not make any sense. Sherlock's curiosity kicked in.
"I don't remember how this happened."
The dinner started without noteworthy incidents, and I was tempted to compliment myself on my choice of venue. However, I should have known better than to underestimate my brother's ability to cause trouble.
Sherlock nods eagerly. "Yes."
So we brought John in. We hoped that he, as a military man, could talk some sense into the boy. Sherlock was there, too, because Mycroft, being the head of bloody everything in this country, was interested in the case.
John does not let himself be put off. "I am beginning to think I am not. And it's fine. More than fine, really. For me at least."
A dramatic pause. Sherlock had taught him well.
He paused and looked straight at Sherlock. "I have been wondering all night why this upset you so much."
"Yes," Thomas said, a fond smile on his face. "I don't exactly know what happened. But he had missed an important meeting due to some unspecified emergency. We should have gotten the final directions for a conference banquet to take place the following day. I got a phone call from one of his PAs at 11pm, announcing his impending arrival at my home. Mycroft was there ten minutes later. We were sitting in this room, just like you and I are now, until long past midnight and discussed seating orders, breaks between meals, all the usual details."
"Well, he is not really my brother-in-law." John did not comment on this, but his expression changed to his familiar
"And you want to do what you saw yesterday?"
"Oh, sorry." John removed his arm quickly and moved away from Sherlock.
?" John did not sound angry. Desperate, rather. And scared. Not as scared as Sherlock felt, though. Was this really happening?
"Yes, exactly!" John's voice was getting loud again. "He'd rather be dead than alone and miserable. You just told me that he said he'd wanted everything with Mycroft. Well, what did he get? A dramatic declaration from beyond the grave and a stupid golden ring. And there's nothing he can do about it anymore. Mycroft did not even give him the chance to say it back. That he loved him. The poor bloke will never get closure."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Love makes stupid people more stupid. Saw you again. Got overwhelmed by hormones. Got himself a job at the insurance company. Found out your schedule. Classic stalking situation. No mystery."
"He better should have." Sherlock said with a vehemence that he had not quite expected from himself. "Thank you for helping me solve the mystery of the golden ring."
"Alright..." Sherlock says leaning forward and tentatively starts to rock against John.
"How, ahm..., personal were those meetings?" Sherlock cursed himself for his curiosity. He did not really want to know details, but he could not help asking.
Finally, after what seemed an eternity, John looked over at Sherlock, raised his eyebrows and then turned towards me.
"Oh god, Sherlock!"
Sherlock was laughing now, too. "Well, it seems that you like it, given that you currently are leaking an excessive amount of fluid on me."
Sherlock, now completely awake and well-rested, made an instantaneous decision.
"Thank you for telling me," Sherlock said. "And thank you for taking care of my brother, I suppose."
John paused to take a breath. Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but still did not know what to say.
Sherlock reached for the folder as soon as the man was out of the door. It only contained a single sheet of paper. On the top right corner there a portrait photograph of the man from the funeral. To the left of the photo there was a name: Thomas Alcott. Foreign Office. Below that, there was an address in London. Sherlock recognized it of course: a quiet residential area, upper middle class. In 1985 a gruesome murder had taken place in that street.
Sherlock loved John's fond sarcasm. He also loved that this bathrobe was ridiculously short. And he loved the legs underneath. The fact, that quite a lot of chest was at display, was not bad either.
"Ready?"
Sherlock was oddly touched by this. People deserved to know that they were loved. But what if this love was unwelcome? "Were you aware of Mycroft's feelings for you by then?" he asked.
John closed his eyes and smiled. It was one of these John-typical smiles that eclipsed everything. "Yes, so I've heard." He chuckled. "Good thing I ended up with the clever one."
They stared at each other. Could it really be that simple?
"What are you doing here in the dark?" John sounded slightly worried as he turned on the lights in the living room. "Is everything alright? I brought dinner." He held up two plastic bags. Indian.  "I'll make us some tea."
"Okay?" John asks.
as you all know, the big day is approaching. As John has made me his best man, it is my traditional responsibility to thoroughly embarrass our two grooms in the presence of their families and friends. For this I need your help.
And it did not get better. Inevitably, Sherlock reached his final insight.
Sherlock's mind was racing towards overdrive. He could not keep up with the events, and he had no idea what his body was doing. All he knew is that it was doing
What happened next was... nothing. Sherlock just sat there, avoiding my gaze. John also just sat there, completely at ease, as if three people facing each other in silence were the natural course of things. I wanted to say something, report on my case, but somehow this felt wrong. So I just stared at the skull on the mantelpiece and tried make sense of the people and the place. Very much in vain, I must say.
"Of course not," John said.
Sherlock took the paper. He recognized his brother's handwriting.
"Just tell me one thing, Sherlock,'' John said, after he had finished cleaning them up a bit. "Did you plan for this to happen? With the bed and everything?"
"Well, sharing a bed. We've been travelling so much for cases together. All those times we did not make it back and ended up in some tiny inn on the countryside. Somehow we always managed to get two separate beds."
John simply stared at him. Sherlock's heart was beating much too fast. John took a shuddering breath before asking "So, what do we do now?"
Sherlock hesitated for a moment. Maybe John could shed some light on the situation. "I went to see my brother-in-law."
"But why?" I felt that I was entitled to an explanation.
Anyway, back to John and Sherlock. The part of the case that concerns us was the evening when Sherlock figured out the code. The body had arrived from Dubai late at night, and Sherlock did not want to wait until the following day. So I had to cancel all my activities for the evening and meet him at the morgue at Bart's.
Sherlock let himself be led to his room. John closed the door behind them and faced him.
"Thank you." Sherlock said and followed the man into the house. He was led into a small study. The walls were covered with bookshelves, filled with books written in various languages. There was a large desk facing the wall to the right. To the left there was a fireplace. Two heavy leather armchairs separated by a small table were facing it. Mr Alcott indicated for Sherlock to take a seat in one of them.
The corners of John's mouth curved upwards for the briefest of moments. Then he began to nod in agreement. And kept nodding.
It was getting a little uncomfortable on the floor.
"Yes, let's do it." John looked up at Sherlock. "Do you want to turn over? We can also try face to face. It's more difficult, but it's an option."
"Yes." It seemed that Sherlock's eloquence had been reduced to just one word. They walked towards a cab to take them back to Baker Street.
The kid said nothing. Sherlock was staring at John, mouth half open.
John took a step towards the kitchen table. So did the bathrobe and the chest and the legs.
"Yes, I do." Sherlock wanted to pull John into his arms, but did not know if it was time yet.
"So?" John asked after a long pause.
Sherlock could not help but kiss him. It was addictive, like everything about John. Sherlock wanted more body contact, and unceremoniously dropped his full weight onto John. John's arms slid around his back and squeezed Sherlock's arse. Sherlock instinctively pushed his groin against John, which sent sparks of electricity through his whole body. John groaned.
The word "sexual" out of Sherlock's mouth does things to John. Time to end this charade. John suddenly feels very calm. Into battle. "Sherlock," he begins cautiously, "I don't think you meant that. Um. Did you actually want me to make a pass at you?"
"To get to my bedroom? Yes, we could try."
"As what did you know my brother then?" Sherlock asked.
On his way out Sherlock ran into Lestrade.
John was nodding again. "Okay. Great. Fantastic. Um, now?"
Sherlock was delighted to see that John's penis twitched at this suggestion. The rest of John seemed to agree, too. Sherlock let himself be pulled towards the bathroom. Perhaps the bedroom could wait a bit longer.
