“I am sorry to inform you” and she doesn't sound sorry at all “but the Egyptian to Byzantine art class is full, so you have to take either biology, mythology or twentieth century literature”
“You feel- God, Dean” he rumbles, hands coming up to rest at Dean’s sides. He looks at him as if Dean is this big, grant thing, good enough to worship and Dean cant take it, so he starts moving, rolling his hips.
“That it’s dangerous. Sorry” she responds embarrassed and comes down the last three steps slowly, glancing from Castiel to Dean. “Hello”
Dean did better than he thought he would, but he does have questions, because he was fairly certain what he wrote on the third question was correct but apparently not.  But he isn’t sure he can go to see Novak. Something curling in his stomach, causing something else to erupt in his chest at the thought. They finish the lecture with a note on next week’s work, the sound and the fury and Dean tries to think of a way to be able to afford buying the book, since he hasn't been able to find it in any second hand bookstore and online the postage costs the whole book from a bookstore.
There is a knock on his door and then Charlie comes in, looking a little breathless. He raises his eyebrows at her, that was fast.
“I have to go get Sam” he says climbing down the rest of the stairs and now they are standing opposite of each other. “I need to go” he repeats, pointing at the door over his shoulder with his thumb.
His hands are shaking and there is something wet in the corners of his eyes and he tries to fight them in vain. In the end he just lays there crying silently with the sound of his neighbour fucking in the background. Because he doesn't explode or deflate, he just feels something cracking further, somewhere in his chest.
knows the guy. But he knows he is pleasant, if not a little weird at times, and enjoys the silence. And if Dean has spent some nights and days thinking about him, who can blame him, the guy is hot. And well it’s just in his head and everything can happen in one’s head. So, he lets himself think, but not too much.
“Like twenty to thirty minutes,” Sam says apologetically “You can come wait here, you don't have to sit in the cold in Baby”
Castiel shifts in his seat taking his trench coat off, “Would you believe me if I said I just felt like it”
It’s weird to watch them. For one they are in the same body, two their relationship is something he can’t pin point, but it’s so tangible, so familiar in a strange way. There is a nudge in the back of his mind, but he cannot figure out what it is.
“You borrowing that?” Lily asks him, pen in her hand. He blinks at her and after a beat, he shakes his head.
One night, while he is showering he thinks about them and starts crying under the cold water. He knows he should get out, he is freezing, but he can’t bring himself to move. He just lets the teas fall and hopes to get the words out of his mind.
“Sorry” he apologises, he looks good, tired and a little tense, but good. Dean has never seen him wearing anything other than a suit, so seeing him in jeans and a shirt is a little weird, although grey brings out his eyes and Dean has the desperate need to kiss him.
“So, how many themes do you think they are in the book?” Novak asks and looks through them, his eyes land on Dean who tries to keep his face neutral, even if his heart is thumbing.
“Alright” he starts after a few seconds of waiting, and changes the slide where the definition of Absurdism is shown and starts explaining.
There is pause, where Cas freezes, but then he chuckles lightly and says with something like astonishment in his voice “You’ve noticed” Dean just shrugs in reply, even if Cas can’t see him and brings the mug to his lips taking another sip.
“I’m sorry” Castiel tells him, sincerely and like he means it. Perhaps he really means it, maybe that’s why Dean’s eyes water for a second before he blinks them away. Although, he doesn’t know what Castiel has to be sorry for. They both knew what they were doing, that they couldn’t-
He has never felt more alone, more abandoned, maybe the last time he did feel it so much was when he was hunting alone before he went to get Sam from Stanford.
He didn't see the redhead today, and even though he feels a little intimidated around her, he kind of missed her usual salute, with the “not loud noises in here” she always says, to everyone passing through the door.
Sam purses his lips and opens the door, getting in the back. They follow him in and Castiel pulls out of the parking lot.
“I’ll be fine” Dean offers him a big smile, trying to brush it off like it’s nothing. He hadn’t thought about it and his hand goes automatically to his pocket, where his pocket knife is. If Castiel notices the movement, it doesn't show on his face.
for some time now and a tremor goes through him. He wants to leave, but then he looks at Cas eyes, and can’t bring himself to move. So, he does the only thing he knows.
He grimaces, tears prickle his eyes. He thinks how unfair it is, how much they’ve lost. How much Dean and Cas have lost, how much they-
Only problem is they have nothing that ties the victims together, nothing they have in common and the local police is getting angsty believing it’s a serial killer and being afraid of what will happen when the people start thinking that too. Meaning they have a lot of research to do and little time to do it. Plus, they need to figure out where the hex bags are stashed.
. He nods and Castiel finally pushes in and Dean closes his eyes in bliss. It’s a wonderfully stretch and his whole body is on fire from the pleasure and he hears himself moan, when Castiel begins to move in a moderate pace. He feels lips against his, kissing him softly and he tries to respond, but he too far lost and Castiel stops, raising his face, just enough and whispers, “Open your eyes” and Dean responds, drowning in blue.
Someone makes a sound, could be him and he becomes aware that they are moving. They have left the kitchen, not that it matters. He doesn't know where they are going, he knows where he wants to go and he thinks Cas is going there too. And that alone ignites something in him and he wants, needs to touch more, hear more. Because, now he can hear Cas moaning and becomes painfully aware of his cock throbbing in his pants.
“Ok. Dean. Well his office is on the third floor, homicides. You’ll find it. Elevator is over there” She responds smiling at him. She still seems suspicious but Dean couldn't care less right now.
“Ugh” he groans. This is a bad idea and Novak is an asshole for planting it in his head in the first place. Ok, that’s lie. He is an asshole for making the idea seem so possible, for putting Dean in this position where he needs to make a choice like that.
Dean makes it two steps inside behind Sam and Michael and immediately wants to flee. He just plants his feet heavily on the ground, puts more weight on his heels until they hurt and shoves his hands in his pockets.
He turns his eyes back to Novak, who is watching him openly. He doesn't know what to say, what is he supposed to say, what do people say in these situations? So, he says the first think that comes to him, “Want to tell me about nature in Auden’s poetry?”
“So, Mr Entwistle, looks like you can go” she says with cheeriness in her voice that it’s a little off putting.
Dean glances at Gabriel, who frowns at him, and he just shrugs in response before following Castiel, who is already inside the cinema.
” And Castiel feels a lot more confused now. When Dean looks at him it’s like he thinks Castiel doesn't understand anything, and it makes him feel small. Then he sighs and says with irritation.
At this point he is just walking, not looking at the books. He walks until he reaches the one end of the library with the stairs that lead to the third floor. He turns around, ready to walk back, when in his peripheral vision he sees him. And he turns, rather abruptly, to make sure it really is him.
Things have been slow for a while. There has been a murder in the last fifteen days, which gave Castiel time to think and processes the case from different angles. He went over everything, trying to catalogue every detail, but it’s like he is making a puzzle with half the pieces. He doesn't have enough clues and so he has to wait, which means more people have to die. It keeps him up at night and Crowley comments on that making him do breathing exercises before he sleeps, but he just can’t get himself to relax.
In the end he leaves with a heavy emotion in his chest, an appointment for next Friday same time, and an instruction to write what he wants to accomplish here. He feels strangely similar to being satisfied.
“Castiel, no I don't-” he looks up at her and she stops. “I mean, I don't know what happened, but I am worried, we all are. I mean even Hannah asked me if you are ok, and you know how she is.” There is a bit of desperation in her voice, when she starts again, and Castiel smiles at her, a small smile that hurts something in him.
He takes a deep breath and then another and walks towards the clinic. He is clean, which came as a huge relief, but he still visits sometimes, he likes Rowena and Missouri and their free condoms.
He hears rustling coming from the bed and freezes. When he doesn't get any indication that Dean has waken, he spares him a glance and continues to search for something to wear.
“Is he alright?” he rushes out, loudly, stomach tightening. The last guy, that is leaving, stops, turning to look at him in mild disapproval and Dean just closes his eyes momentarily.
They get into the elevator and Cas presses the button for the parking lot. They finally reach the parking after being pulled up twice, smiling politely to other people and awkward small talk on Castiels’ part, which amuses Dean even more and earns him a glare.
At least he was in the station last night, the pressure decreases at the thought and he draws a breath turning to Anna.
“There is nothing wrong with that Dean” Bobby continues, and then huffs at his stunt expression “I’ve done it too, for three years”
On Thursday, he asks him to lunch and Dean gives him a half assed excuse. He is angry, at the world, at himself, at Cas who can’t seem to want to spend his free time with his wife.
Sam has come a long time ago. He has a house, with Eileen near the center of the little town they've built, close to mom and dad's. They ran a library, which Dean, when he first saw just laughed for five minutes straight. Clapped him in the shoulder and told him,
“She asked how I was” he remembers the way his heart stopped and how stressed he felt when he heard her voice, it had to be at least 2 years since the last time he talked with his mother. He thinks about how he cried after the barely one-minute call and how he felt yet again something break inside him.
“Here” Castiel says and offers him a glass filled with juice. Dean looks up at his face, startled maybe even a little alarmed. “You need to drink this” he tells him and Dean reaches and takes it from his hand. Then notices his other hand, as he places a glass of water at the night stand next to him.
He presses down at him and their cocks rub against each other, it’s dry but still causes sparks everywhere in Dean and he moans. He needs-
He sits on a table this time, by the window and stirs a pack of sugar in his coffee. He starts to eat his muffin slowly (it’s really fucking good) and his eyes stray to the station. He hates himself for it and he hates his mind for thinking about blue eyes.
“Ok” Sam says dragging the word and Dean knows he knows that something is up. “We’ll talk later. When you are ready, Dean” Dean can hear the smugness in his voice and scowls.
“I will tell Sam and- Wait, I think-” he reaches for his wallet and starts going through it, he really needs to get reed of all this useless cards and receipts, but “I think I might have her card”. He doesn't.
When he is satisfied and Dean is a mess, he gives him a peck on the lips, before he turns and opens the first drawer in the nightstand and retrieving a bottle of lube and a condom.
Clary, Jace, Isabelle and Alec were all around the same age in their early twenties but Magnus… Magnus was the odd one out.
Now it was Dean's turn to feel the impending weight of guilt crush him. Dean turned to find that Cas was already staring at him, troubled
"Are you two together or something?" John asked, pretending as though Cas didn't just call him out on all his shitty parenting decisions. His eyes went to Dean, and then to Cas, watching and observing all their small movements: the way Dean was naturally leaning into Cas, and how he had a firm hand on the angel as though he was holding him back, or the way Cas was now standing in front of Dean, like a protective human barrier.
"Dean just give him some space," Sam said watching the scene unfold. Dean was about to get back up when a hand grabbed his. Castiel was now looking up, "Dean are you okay?" Dean settled back down kneeling.
"Oh hey! Ella, this is my dad, Dean. Dean this is their forensic scientist, Ella," Jack introduced him with a smile.
Castiel made eye contact with the man as he strode right past them, sending a prickly shiver down Castiel's spine. The man frowned as though he was trying to figure out a puzzle, but quickly pulled his eyes and attention away.
"And you were king of hell," Jack smirked at him, trying to lighten the mood. Lucifer patted Jack's back lightly snickering and went over to the other couch.
Dean bit his lips, the tears about to snake out, "Shit, I can't lose you. I lost mom, I lost Jack, we lost Rowena, I can't lose you too."
"Oh thank you! I wasn't aware you knew your cars," Lucifer replied looking up from his menu, "what's yours?"
"Well thank you. You saved my life... again," said Dean staring down trying to seem suddenly interested in his shoes.
"This is the one thing Chuck can never take away from us," Cas muttered, feeling Dean hug him tighter, "do you remember what I said before? About how in this massive mess, we're real. We've always been real. Your feelings, my feelings- that's real. We always fight for each other, no matter what kind of shit Chuck puts us through." Dean nodded, burying his head deeper into Castiel's shoulder. Sometimes they didn't need to speak words to understand what the other was feeling.
Dean hugged Cas tighter and watched the sun rise above the horizon, painting the sky with pale exuberant morning colours. Cas was right, as he always was. He was going to be okay.
"I'll return in a few hours, okay? What happened last time- when the apocalypse started, it won't happen again. But this is different, Dean," Cas said.
Dean relaxed back into Cas. He kissed Cas's feathers some more and Cas felt like he was in Heaven all over again. Better than Heaven almost. Cas loved the feeling of Dean's lips on his feathers, and it was something he never thought would come to pass.
Dean nodded, as he placed a calm hand on Cas's shoulder, and Cas just very slowly began to relax under his touch. John looked from Dean to Cas and back, trying to fit the pieces together. Dean saw the judgement in his father's eyes and pulled his hand away. Cas sensed that Dean was feeling uneasy beside him, and his anger began to boil.
"Woah, easy tiger. It's in a few hours, don't worry," Dean replied, "Come on, let's go back to my room. You need to eat and uh- we can talk."
"I wish. It's a long story anyway. Lovely to meet you Maze," Dean said putting on his best charming smile.
A week passed by in a flash, Sam and Dean trying to help Rowena in whatever way they could. Most of the time it was Sam bickering with Rowena about some spell and ingredients, and Dean couldn't stand the both of them. Dean wanted to hunt. His fingers twitched and craved for a hunt, his mind wanted to return to work, his muscles wanted to get back into a fight. But of course, Sam wanted Dean to rest. It was a never-ending cycle.
"Your brother gave it to me. Anyway, Sam, I have this friend called Maze who's a demon- don't ask- but I told her about your situation. She told me to tell you to check out this book called,
"Yes, but this isn't our lives. I know it's easier here, with the money, the royalty, the clothes, the food. No apocalypse hanging over our heads. But this isn't our
Dean settled the food down on the small circular table in his room, Cas perched on the chair and began eating. Dean sat opposite Cas, silently waiting.
"And what about you?" Dean asked, "you were the dumbass that decided to bravely take on my shit. How are
"Oh, I'm dead serious," He said and turned to Cas, "Cas, is it possible to... maybe, extract the human soul? It sounds insane but I mean after everything we've been through lately, I wouldn't be surprised if we manage to pull this off."
Dean tried his best to ignore him and tried to march past him but David spoke up, "I'm surprised Castiel stuck around you for this long."
"I know what it's like. The pain you're feeling, I've felt it. I've lost Cas too many fucking times. He got ripped away from me when Michael set the world on fire and I thought everyone died. I'm truly sorry," Dean finished.
I recommend listening to "If your prayers don't get to heaven" by Brian Fallon while reading this chapter because the music really sets to tone and vibe for this chapter :)
"Dean?" Cas said holding Dean's face in his hands delicately. He made sure the hunter was alive and well. He felt a pulse at the side of Dean's neck.
Cas's eyes were burning with so much pain and anger, that it knocked Dean off his feet. Dean felt his blood boil under his skin.
"Sorry, but have I done something to offend you?" John asked, smugly. His tone was dark and dangerous. Dean knew it all too well. It was the same tone John used when he was gravely upset with Dean, and Dean immediately knew he was fucked.
"So, we're back?" Jack asked with uncertainty in his voice. Sam looked around not knowing exactly what he was looking for until he found it. He spotted an impala on the driveway ahead of them and smiled knowingly, "yes, we are."
evil." He tried to keep his answers short and simple. Dean was just pleased that neither of them had broken into a fight... yet.
Cas shifted his duffle bag to his other hand, "Well for one, she's stubborn and has a hot temper. But she's kind, and she cares a lot. She loves passionately and wholly. She sees the world in a way a lot of people don't, in a way adults don't. She's a fighter too. She broke her arm once and when I offered to heal her, she stopped me and she said "No. I want my body to heal on its own so I can become stronger." Her mother thought she was insane."
"I think the lore is a bit different in your world. You're Sam and Dean Winchester, right? You're hunters? You do what we do, except without the powers."
"Dean, we need to talk about what just happened," Cas said. Dean remained quiet, taking a sudden interest in his shoes.
The angel stared at Dean, who was now visibly starting to break down. Cas hated this. He hated seeing Dean hurt and upset, but it was even worse now because he knew it was his fault Dean was in this state.
"I think the worst one was on your birthday. You were so happy, Dean," Cas glanced up, meeting Dean's eyes, "You had this incredible bright smile on your face when Sam brought out the cake I made for you." Cas's eyes shifted as he looked back down again.
"Don't think too much, or your head will explode," Sam said coming up behind him. He sat next to Dean with his food.
regret this, mark my words." That was it. When Dean Winchester made a promise, he kept it. And now David's fate was sealed. David backed away a little, stunned at how quickly Dean snapped and turned to stand up for Cas. Cas, meanwhile, sighed, pulling Dean away.
The sunrise was always spectacular from Lucifer's balcony and Jack stood by the edge admiring the view ahead of him. Castiel was buried knee-deep in books, flipping through one page after another. Neither Sam nor Cas or even Jack had found a way to create the portal to go back home.
"He's alive but he's weak. His body is completely disorientated and mangled. I can help him kick start the healing process, but the rest is up to him," Cas said and started working his angel mojo to help heal Dean. After Cas did his bit, he retreated.
"They're maggots. We use insects to determine the time of death," Ella said showing Jack more pictures. Jack's eyes went wide as he went through the pictures he knew he probably wasn't allowed to see.
Dean softly smiled to himself, "Yeah, we thought the same thing but he inherited more of Cas's traits than our Lucifer- and thank god for that."
"Holy shit, Cas?" Dean put the angel blade back into his jacket, and sprinted over to Cas, wrapping his arms around the angel, "it's you."
"I got your flowers," Cas said. Dean dropped the spatula on the pan with a loud cling. Dean didn’t lookup.
"Yes, Sam is leading us well. We know exactly where Michael is located at. It's only a matter of time before we attack. How are you and Dean?" Inias asked. Cas shifted his weight around, biting his lower lip.
Cas tilted his head, "I didn't think you would want me around considering you are now warm and safe and in the hands of good people. Do you still want me to stay?"
The man shook his head furiously, "No, I doubt it. We've never met." He stuffed his wallet back into his pocket.
After a beat Dean began to circle Castiel, ducking under the wings and just admiring God's work. He went over to Castiel's left wing and his eyes scanned the feathers, some still covered in blood. Castiel's wings were as black as the night sky with a hint of a rainbow that you could only see if the light rays hit the feathers at the right angle. It was truly remarkable. Dean suddenly realized that not every person on the planet were as lucky as him to witness something so incredible and a rush of pride overcame him.
He looked down at his hand, the place where the cut should have been. Dean squeezed his hands, digging his fingernails into the palm of his hand, trying to feel any kind of physical pain that could distract him from the shithole his mind was twisting into. The pressure he exerting was almost enough to draw blood.
"You don't have to worry," Cas said, reassuringly as he noticed Dean's tense pose, "I've known about you and...
Cas composed himself, and stepped forward, "you have done more than enough, John Winchester. You mistreated your sons, but I won't let that happen again."
"Sammy would have loved to see and touch them. You know, being the nerd that he is," Dean laughed but Castiel didn't crack a smile, "What?"
"No, it's okay Sam is going out to get some food now, he needs the break... No Dean… Yes, just get something small for me… Okay, I'll see you soon," and he hung up.
"Cas, Jack, get Dean back to the motel and heal him. I'll stay with the kids until the police arrive," Sam ordered. Jack agreed and helped Cas move Dean into the Impala, and they drove off.
"But if Dean leaves, I leave with him," Cas finished, "You want to kick him out? Fine. I'll go as well."
, the next person who asks me that won't be leaving without a bloody nose and I ain't even kidding. Nothing is going on, Sam."
"Heh, you're welcome I guess," Dean stuttered, peaking a glance at the angel. Cas was smiling, and Dean's entire world suddenly became a whole lot brighter.
"I know I said this before, but seriously Cas, thank you for saving my life," Dean said in a light-hearted manner but the angel would see how Dean genuinely meant it.
"Alright, alright. Calm down. Sam's on the way. Get him and get something that belongs to Dean and meet me at the Wendy's near the bookstore," Magnus said, quickly cutting the call.
"Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt," Dean snapped back. Dean couldn't stay annoyed at Cas for too long, because the feeling of Cas's gentle fingers touching his rougher and already worn out ones, was sending heat and fire down his body.
Jody spoke with Cas, trying to figure out Dean but Cas didn't say much on the matter. When she tried to approach Dean on the matter, he made a lame excuse about being exhausted and brushed it off.
They knocked on the first house and the excited girls welcomed them in. Dean explained the situation and the girls volunteered to write the sentence out even though the brothers were clearly searching for a man. Sam just rolled his eyes, entertained by the entire thing, however, Dean gave Sam a troubled look knowing full well that this was all useless.
"I love you, Dean," Cas said. It was unexpected, but somehow still felt natural. Dean was, of course, taken aback.
Cas saw Sam and Dean talk casually with their father, as though the man hadn't been dead for the past 12 years or so. Dean saw Cas standing in the doorway from his peripheral vision, and paused. He called Cas over, and although Castiel was hesitant at first, he obliged. John Winchester stared at Cas, unable to figure out who Cas was.
"You guys can go ahead on your little adventure but I'm going to do more research," Cas said and Sam agreed out of nowhere. Jack asked if he could join Lucifer and Dean, much to Castiel's annoyance. Lucifer quickly and hurriedly got ready and they were ready to go, "come on chaps."
"Well that's a first," Dean murmured, "most people just say 'piss off'" Lucifer laughed and sat back into his chair. He kept his eyes firmly on Dean watching and analyzing all his movements, down to the way he continued to drink like he was about to face the end of reality (which nearly happened once… or maybe twice).
Sam grabbed Cas's phone, opened notes and typed out the book and author quickly before the information sprinted out of his short term memory slot. Cas snatched his phone back and looked at the note, tilting his head confused.
"This is your fault! She's dead because of you! Because you wanted to find him! You did this!" She yelled at Cas accusingly.
"She said we needed to find a large empty plain to perform this ritual. She needs energy and a lot of power to do this, and of course, we don't know the kind of hell that'll break loose when you and Cas meet. Call Cas and tell him to meet us at the field just outside the brewery downtown by 2 pm. Rowena needs time to collect the ingredients; some we have in the bunker, some we don't." Dean was already texting Cas by the time Sam finished.
"Oh right, sorry," Dean muttered. He watched the others pull a body out of the back. Dean's heart fell, as he realised that was probably Rosaline.
Jody looked so shocked at Dean's words, and even Donna had her mouth hanging open. They all knew Dean and Castiel's relationship was all sorts of complicated, but they knew Dean would never speak to Cas like that.
"Yes." Castiel locked his gaze with Dean and you could feel the electricity in the room. Dean gulped. All of this with Cas was too much. He ripped his eyes away from Castiel and looked down.
"Calm your horses, we're here to help," the man with the spiky red streaks in his hair spoke. Dean noticed the rings on his fingers.
Dean nodded watching his brother guide the scared woman away. Cas cleaned the angel blade and stuffed it back into his jacket. It was weird seeing Cas like this without his trenchcoat and suit. Cas was wearing normal clothes with a black jacket over his shirt. He looked so… human.
"Sam just told me what happened when I was under the spell. Cas, what did I say to you?" Dean asked. He needed to know. He HAD to know. He had to know how bad it was so that he could punish himself accordingly for hurting his angel, his best friend.
Dean really thought he was going to lose his fucking mind, as on the fifth night, he left purple lilacs. Love and passion.
Cas smiled warmly, "me too, Dean." Cas slowly put his hands on Dean's face and smiled. It was a single gesture but it was comforting. Everything with Cas was about to change, and although it made Dean nervous, he was excited. Dean pulled Cas into another hug because he loved the feeling of Castiel's arms around him. Dean felt another presence around him, something his human vision couldn't perceive which he assumed was Cas's wings wrapping around him.
Dean woke up first, got ready and entered the living area. He went over to Lucifer's coffee maker and brewed himself a cup because he simply couldn't function until he had his morning cup.
"Yeah, I remember. Do you know what else I remember? I remember holding you against me, watching you sleep peacefully, with your soft fingers muddled up in my wings." Cas's breath faltered, "I remember you calling out for me, even in your sleep. I remember you waking up, seeing my eyes and smiling brightly. I remember hugging you warmly. I remember kissing your cheek. I remember telling you about how I pulled you out of hell. I remember you smiling, and laughing with me. Do you remember that?"
"I think you forget, I know your entire life story, Dean," Cas smiled. It wasn't malicious or evil, it was kind and genuine.
"Were you worried?" Cas asked perplexed. He looked at Dean up and down, a smile formulating when he saw that Dean was wearing his spare clothes.
"Jack, Sam, can I talk to Cas alone?" Dean asked, after a moment of silent thinking. Sam and Jack nodded, and Jack wished him goodnight before leaving.
"It's not easy. It's more of an art than science and I need to make sure I do minimum damage," Cas sighed. He looked at Dean who pursed his lips, ready to shit his pants there and then.
"Dean, I enjoy what we have going on here. But we can't keep this up. I mean sooner or later you’ll run out of flowers,” Cas joked, “I understand what you're trying to tell me with the flowers, I do. But we need to
"This is his," Cas said. Alec took it from Cas and called Jace over. Everyone watched as Alec and Jace parabatai tracked using Dean's jacket. The golden shimmering light encircling their hands as Jace and Alec stared at each other, trying to pinpoint Dean's location. After a few seconds, Alec pulled away.
"And what about you, sweetheart?" she asked, clearly not noticing how close Dean and Cas were sitting together.
Dean stepped out into Lucifer's living room, and his question was answered. Lucifer and Castiel were out on the balcony- one with a glass of bourbon in his hand. He watched them both quietly. An angel and the devil himself- it was a strange sight to observe.
John moved to pat Dean's shoulder, and Cas reacted as fast as a cat. The angel grabbed John's wrist, growling, "you won't lay a finger on him." His voice was crisp and uninviting.
Cas nodded, "Inias, prepare a small team. We'll leave to find Rosaline, dead or alive, in 10 minutes. The rest of you will return to base as planned." Inias nodded and rushed off. Cas turned, almost bumping headfirst into Dean, before quickly rushing off to his tent. He gathered his maps, but Dean stopped him.
"Cas, hey," Dean said, right before Castiel collapsed and his knees buckled under him. The pain and trauma that Cas shifted onto him were taking a toll. Dean held Cas, muttering a small "you're okay," and carefully placed the angel down on the edge of his bed. Cas didn't say anything; he was too busy trying to keep his breathing at a normal rate.
Dean just nodded, bouncing his leg up and down restlessly as they waited for more news in the dining room.
"One of them yes," Jack replied, "what's in his brain?" Jack squirmed at the pictures from the crime scene. There was a dead body with insects slithering out of his brain.
After they sent away Maggie and covered up Rosaline's body, Dean stayed out of Cas's hair. Sam checked up on Dean, but Dean was silent. He was thinking. Dean had been terrified that they would bring back Castiel's body, but instead, it was someone else. He was spared this time. But now someone else was paying the price. How many lives did Cas have to risk to save Dean? Was he even worth all that? Dean sat at the dinner table mulling things over in his head.
"You kept me within your arm's reach back at your camp, made sure I was well fed and looked after, like a pig going into slaughter, and then the moment I'm willing to give myself up for this fight, you refuse to let me fight. You pushed me away, but you still refuse to let me go. You're a selfish bastard is what you are," Dean fired back.
Sam and Dean stumbled across a case, three dead teenagers and the attackers had no recollection of what happened to them, all of them had woken up with their hands drenched in blood. Sam thought it was demons, Dean thought it was witches but there were no traces of sulfur nor hex bags.
Magnus laughed, shaking his head, "No, but Dean speaks very highly of you. And I finally found someone who's been alive much longer than I have."
He quickly glanced at Dean who was giving Sam a playful punch on his arm, "We're going through a rough patch right now." Cas guided Inias along to the dining area where they caught up on everything over some food. After Dean and Castiel had left, Sam had immediately stepped up into his position. Inias praised Sam for pulling through as he remained unshaken and true to his heart. Cas asked about the children, Clarissa and her friends, as well Dorothea, who now felt little kicks from her unborn child. It warmed Cas's heart to hear these stories of the people he stood beside all this time.
"You heard right," Cas said, now smiling because of how insane it all sounded, "Dean was in hell, and I was asked to save him. A few other angels and I stormed in, and I managed to rescue him. But it was too late. Dean was already tormenting souls; I couldn't get to him fast enough."
"He's a real angel, ain't he?" Lucifer laughed. Dean couldn't stop himself from smiling widely. Dean moved his gaze from Lucifer to out to the open illuminated sky.
Dean shook his head, "I'm done. I'm done with you. I'm done with this. I'm done with everything. Fuck you, fuck everything."
Once Magnus was certain, he used his magic to rip Dean out of the shackles. There was a huge clatter as the chains broke free. Dean's eyes opened as he felt the magic pulling him. Once Dean was free, Magnus pulled Dean from the ground. He hovered in the air for a split second before Magnus sent Dean directly into Castiel's arms. Dean collapsed into Cas's body, even Alec was a little surprised. The ruckus caused Hecate to turn around, eyes flaring with so much rage as she realised her prisoner was free, and that Magnus Bane was standing before her.
"I want what Sam has with Eileen, I want that with- with you. Even if I can't have that, I want my friend back. I miss you, Cas. I miss what we used to be. I miss your weird lop-sided smile and that annoying head-tilt thing you do when you're confused. I miss hunting with you, I miss hanging out with you. Cas, I don't know if you're getting this, but please stay alive. I'll find a way back to purgatory and I'll get you back I promise. Just, please, stay alive. For me."
The hunter looked up, his eyes were scared and worried, "Thanks, Cas. I was just so angry and annoyed. But dad's gonna rip me to shreds tomorrow. He's the most homophobic piece of shit I have ever known."
Sam sighed, "Listen, Dean. I don't know what you're going through. But just take it slow, okay? Get some rest and some proper food in you for a change."
Cas entered his tent with a plate of food and a cup of coffee early in the morning. He saw Dean quickly pull down his shirt as he entered.
Dean took a deep breath in; it was inevitable. But after a pause, he nodded. It was the only way to end the story and go back home.
"We're not taking this risk," Sam said his voice shaking, only slightly but it was still enough for Dean to pick up on.
"Cas? Dean?" She muttered, eyes wide in confusion. She hurried forward, signalling the others to lower their weapons. A few men and women stepped out of their hiding places, staring at Claire worried.
"Most of it was on hunts. We would be on different hunts, just us, but some of them were really pleasant too. Thanksgiving dinner, Christmas, New Year's Eve, your birthday…" Cas droned on. Dean's eyes went wide in shock. He had no idea Cas had been tortured to this extent and his blood boiled at the mere thought of it.
"You're just fucking lying to yourself. Come on, you said it yourself before, you only got me back to use me as your weapon, right? So come on! Use me!"
"No, you misunderstand me. I like it. I like your touch. It's soothing, it's- I don't know how to describe it, Dean. You have a way of making people feel loved," Cas said, the words just slipping out of his mouth uncontrollably.
Dean wanted to scream. He wanted Cas to be angry at him because it would make all of this so much easier. But instead, Cas was here, calmly reassuring Dean the way he always does.
When the movie ended, Dean didn't want to wake Cas up. Sam offered him a blanket and Dean gently placed the blanket over Cas, careful not to disturb him. Dean returned to his room, with his shirt covered in Cas's scent.
He stood up, letting go of Clarissa, "Thank you all." He turned to Dean, then David, then Clarissa, and finally Sam. And he left.
"Seriously guys! I'm not putting other lives at risk like this! Not if there's something else we can do," Dean said, now standing up, his rage and fury taking over in a flash.
"Of course, your majesty," Cas said politely. Dean offered his hand again as he did at the ball, and Cas took it.
"So what I'm getting from this is that Castiel and yourself are Jack's parents?" Lucifer asked closing the menu. A waiter came by asking for their orders. Dean ordered his usual and while Lucifer was tempted to try one of their daily specials. The waiter scribbled their order down giving Lucifer an ominous look before leaving.
Ella muttered a small "I figured." She excused herself leaving Dean and Jack with Lucifer who suggested they should go out for lunch, again his treat and get some food for Sam and Cas back at his apartment. Dean was a little hesitant but agreed and they headed off in Lucifer's gorgeous black 1961 Corvette.
"You don't get to spend months hating me and wishing I was dead, and then suddenly show a spark of interest now," Cas said bitterly.
"I know. I feel it too. Ever since I took on your pain, I can feel it withering inside. Your soul is still trying to heal. You need to rest and give it some time," Cas said softly.
"What in the-" Dean muttered, putting his hands to find that it was feathers. Incredibly soft yet austere, black feathers.
"You're an angel aren't you? But you're not from around here…" Lucifer said observantly. Dean watched the exchange between the devil and the angel.
Magnus grinned but Alec was the one who spoke, "we were fighting this rogue Shadowhunter and I saved his ass."
"I was only training Dean to become the best hunter I always knew he could be," John said, defensively. He stepped forward, but Cas didn't flinch. Dean, however, did.
"It doesn't matter what happens to me, as long as you're okay. Please tell me you're okay," his voice was quiet.
Maggie bent over Rosaline's dead body, bawling her eyes out. Cas quickly looked at Dean, who was watching Maggie.
Lucifer grinned widely, knowing full well what he was doing to both Cas and Dean. Maze would really flat out burn him on a stake if she found out that this is how the devil spent his time nowadays- trying to set up a human and an angel- both too stupid to realize that they were in love with their best friend.
"Yeah, I can see that," Dean said sarcastically, "Look, remember when you healed me after that vampire case a few days ago? Yeah, well now it's my turn." Once Dean was sure Cas wasn't going to protest again, he diverted his attention to the stomach wound. The cut was a few inches deep. Dean reckons a stab by a sharp object.
"Yeah, but Cas seems a little more on edge these days. I don't think he likes how much you've been hanging out with Lucifer," Sam said very carefully, afraid he was stepping on a time bomb.
Dean and Sam talked some more with the Shadowhunters and the warlock who was getting on way too well with Dean until Cas knocked on the door. Dean went to answer it and almost started laughing at how Cas was holding paper bags filled with burgers, fries and drinks.
That's more than I can say for you." If one could send deathly arrows with their eyes, Dean would be a professional.
"No, I meant, I'm tired of fighting with you." Cas pulled away a little to look at Dean, "I hate fighting with you. I'm sorry for hurting you, can we just- go back to normal. I'm so tired, Dean." Cas fell back into Dean, head dropping weakly.
you underestimated your enemies. You could have gotten yourself killed you dumbass," Castiel said frowning.
"I'm so sorry. For all the pain you've endured and the loss. You can't keep bottling things up, Dean. It'll destroy you from the inside out," Cas said, his voice velvet soft. The angel drew small circles on the back of Dean's hand. He read online that this movement is supposed to calm a person down, it's a sign of reassuring them.
Sam waited until Cas brought his eyes up to meet Sam's. Cas also shut the book he was reading and sighed.
Sam indicated for the rest of them to sit down wherever they pleased. There weren't many chairs, just two, so Clary and Isabelle squeezed into one. Alec and Magnus fell into one of the beds, and Sam and Dean sat on the other bed. Jace just stayed standing, Alec grinned at him teasingly. Magnus used his magic to conjure up more drinks for everyone, but God knows they'll need it. Alec and Jace spoke for most of the time, well, mostly Alec, trying to explain their world, their demons, and their jobs. Sam and Dean nodded, trying to wrap their minds around this whole new world. According to Alec, there were different types of demons: Greater demons and Lesser demons, who had the ability to possess a human and leave, leaving the human with no memory of when they were possessed. Sam huffed, watching as their case slowly pieced together at last.
"I have no idea but… I mean if we're really in LA, may as well enjoy ourselves am I right?" Dean chirped checking out the women walking down the street with their expensive bags, skinny polished legs, and their shimmering jewellery.
"Rosaline and Maria didn't come back last night. Henry found Maria's corpse, but we don't know what happened to Rosaline," Inias said.
angel, and he's my other half. He always has been. We never stopped fighting for each other, even when the world went to hell. That's why Cas is special. He
Dean and Jack said their goodnights and took off to go to their rooms to clean up and crash for the night because they damn well deserved it.
"Alright, everyone ready?" Sam asked, lifting the bottle filled with a part of Dean's soul in his hand, ready to open it.
Cas rolled his eyes and snuggled close to Dean like he normally would. Every time their skin brushed, Dean felt the immense heat travel through his body and all along his nerves. Cas looked up, still perplexed.
“I can’t do this, anymore. Every time I look at you, I just- I end up puking my guts out,” Dean said quietly.
Meanwhile, Dean held his hands up as a form of surrender. Just then, Chloe Decker strutted over to Lucifer wearing her black coat over her white blouse, "Maze you ready?" to which Maze nodded.
Dean shifted and turned around in his bed, the perfect peaceful dream turning into one of his worst memories.
"What's going on here?" Dean asked, looking at the angel and the ladies who were huddled together bowing heads over a phone on the table in the middle.
"I am," But before Dean could open his mouth, Cas continued, "I know, I'll be careful. You should go."
try anything! I have you surrounded," and she was right. Out of the shadows, men stepped forward with shotguns in their hands. Dean wanted to laugh. This was
“Dean, it’s better if you didn’t know…” Sam said, fiddling with his thumbs, which was not helpful at all. If anything, this infuriated Dean even more.
"You're fucking awesome, Cas. I've missed you so much," Dean said, pulling Cas into another hug, the one place Dean felt fully safe and loved.
Cas stood there looking fresh and... incredible. Dean, by instinct, walked forward, and the crowd parted to make way. Cas stared at Dean, the crown on Dean's head glimmering in all the lights. Dean walked until he came face to face with Cas.
Cas remained silent, he looked down and saw a group of black flowers that looked very similar to black Hellebore flowers. Cas pursed his lips grimly recognising the flowers,
"You should head back to the motel Cas. Sammy and I will take care of this. You've already done enough," Dean said.
Cas walked up to Dean until he was standing right beside him. Cas took the spatula out of his hand and pushed him to the side, “You’re a hopeless case, Winchester. Scoot over so I can make you a real breakfast.”
"Please, continue," Dean said gently, nodding to Cas. Sam was really enjoying watching this scene unfold before him. Cas wrote the sentence on the paper and naturally, the handwriting matched to each line and dot.
Song recommendation for this chapter, because the whole meaning behind the song is about fighting back and pushing through the pain:
Dean gazed back down at his hands, his fingers fiddling together as if he didn't know what else to do with them.
"The first time he saw me, his eyes went wide, almost like he recognised me. It was really weird, Sam."
Dean didn't talk to Castiel for the next few days. Jody didn't understand why but she didn't press for answers either. She knew better than to pester Dean about it. The day after the boys had arrived, Jody and Donna spoke with Sam and Castiel trying to coordinate everything when Dean walked into the room abruptly. He stood there dumbfounded, in his newly washed clothes that smelled like lavender flowers in a summer evening.
"Thank you. For every fucking thing you do and have ever done for me," Dean said clutching Cas's coat in his hands.
Claire Novak stepped out of the shadows, wearing a dirty green jacket, boots and a shotgun posed in her arms. She lowered her shotgun as her eyes settled on Dean and Castiel staring at her in absolute shock.
"And I was, Cas. I know you don't trust him, I don't either, but let's give the guy a chance okay?" Dean replied calmly.
When Sam realised Dean wasn't going to speak, he did. He explained their world to the newcomers, about how their demons could not shapeshift and more about Heaven and Hell. This left even Magnus in shambles.
Castiel's wings were as black as the night sky with a hint of a rainbow that you could only see if the light rays hit the feathers at the right angle. It was truly remarkable.
When they arrived in Dean's room, Cas gently closed the door behind him because he was pretty sure this conversation would end in raised voices.
Dean laughed, relaxing his muscles again, "I know, Cas. Just leave me something behind so I can find you again."
"Oh, how rude of me. This is my incredible partner, detective Chloe Decker, the very best of her kind," Lucifer said to which Chloe Decker nodded in return.
Dean took a deep breath in, "That's none of your business." Sam who had been sitting beside Castiel surrounded by Inias, Jody and Donna, nudged Cas with his elbow. Cas turned to see Dean slowly losing his battle with his temper and immediately rushed over to defuse the tension.
"Um Dean, what happened?" Castiel and Jack who were admiring the view from the balcony turned to find Lucifer pouring them drinks.
"Nothing that's gonna put us, or our world, in danger, alright? Calm your panties, little brother," Dean snapped back.
"I wanted to work things out with you, I wanted to be your friend again. But you NEVER gave us a chance. You really still believe that our friendship was manipulated by Chuck? Do you still believe that?" Cas asked.
Dean didn't need to even look up to know it was the angel who walked towards him. He shifted his weight onto his right leg, leaning on the glass edge.
Cas turned to leave, but Dean spoke causing the angel to turn, "Thank you, Cas. For- for everything. I finally feel like I can breathe." And Dean, at last, got to exhale.
"I didn't think you would feel its presence, humans usually don't unless… unless they're bonded," Cas said, finishing his sentence quietly.
Inias dropped his act and apologised. This is how Cas remained as the commander. Castiel was fierce and absolute. He didn't take anyone's bullshit, and he played his cards right. Castiel ruled with his head and his heart, and that's why the men and women followed him into war.
what's going on?" Cas asked, his voice shaking with the nerves. People around them talked in hushed voices wondering who this mysterious man was. The music continued and people began to disperse around them but some still confused. Dean could hear the whispers. The ladies seemed jealous and baffled by this unexpected guest.
Dean went up to Castiel still lost for words. Castiel squirmed, closed his eyes and grabbed his right shoulder in pain.
"You won't quit, will you?" Dean asked. Cas glared at him, and Dean stopped trying. They had a small break and then continued their hike to the stream. They encountered more leviathan and other monsters, and they fought teeth and claw for their lives. When Cas couldn't save himself, Dean did and vice versa. They never spoke about Cas's outburst, but Dean was careful with his words. They worked well together and fought well beside each other but the tension was still there. Dean hated it as much as Castiel did.
you did." But he was smiling nonetheless. Dean pushed Cas away, pulling him back in, twisting him around in his arms. He half expected Cas to lose balance but this was
"We were thinking of having Sam's army join ours. Obviously, they will take a few days to arrive. We can train and coordinate an attack together," Jody said, "We're stronger in numbers."
The next time Dean saw Cas was at another meeting. Cas didn't talk to Dean and Dean pretended like Cas didn't exist. Sam agreed to bring in his army to their camp so they can discuss everything face to face, but of course, this would take a few days.
Cas turned around without waiting for Dean's reply and left. He kept walking and didn't look back. Dean watched Cas leave, for the 100th time now. He wasn't aware of how much Cas was hurting, and deep down he knew what Cas said was right. He followed the angel, through the bushes, and the leaves crunching beneath their feet. Dean wanted to talk to Cas, but he was afraid he would just make things worse. Because apparently, that what he does. Make things worse.
"Cas- I-" Dean stuttered because it was much harder for him to get those stupid little three words out than it had been for Cas.
After a moment of brutal silence, Cas murmured, "because I saw the good in you. I saw why my father had chosen you to be the
Dean asked Cas to bring some dinner for their new friends/guests and Cas just replied with a text going
"Sam, I want you to take over. I want you to carry on my mission, to train, fight and beat Michael. Dean and I will help where we can, but I need you to
Dean gulped, staring at his red knuckles, "Being in purgatory again, talking to Rowena, seeing Sam with Eileen, it was all just too much. I should have stopped you, I should have fought harder for you. Cas, I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix this, I don't know what I can say to make things right again. I broke you, you were
"Oh my god," Dean whispered into oblivion. He remembered it all, he remembered everything. And along with that came a throbbing headache.
“Dean, listen to me. What you did, it was the spell. I forgive you. Do you hear me? I forgive you, Dean. I can’t watch you rip yourself apart like this. Let me help,” Cas said.
Dean quickly shut up when the movie started. Cas joined him, moving closer and closer to Dean. They were 10 minutes into the movie and Dean had to admit, it wasn't as bad as he thought it was. Sam gave Dean another one of those looks and Dean made a mental note to kick his brother's ass later. Nevertheless, Dean yawned and cautiously placed his arm around the back of the couch. Cas yawned next, and moved closer to Dean, his eyes flickering in between sleep and wakefulness. Angels didn't need to sleep but because Cas was weaker than normal, he slept to recharge. Dean moved a bit closer, an invitation for Cas to lay his head on Dean's chest.
"Alright Sammy, you were right," Dean rolled his eyes, "No need to rub it in, no one likes a know-it-all." Jack laughed behind Sam, who smiled as he left the room shaking his head.
"Jody? Donna?" Dean asked, his voice breaking halfway. Donna, who was wearing her brown leather jacket with a shotgun in her hands, caught Cas in a tight warm hug, while Jody buried Dean in her arms.
Sam Dean, Castiel, and Jack entered the precinct. Sam and Jack had tracked down the detective's car to this building specifically. They found the same blonde-haired woman sitting at her desk buried knee-deep in stacks of paperwork.
Maggie stormed up to Dean, poking her index finger into his chest accusingly, "why should Castiel put your life before my girlfriend? What are you to him?"
“I helped you heal, but the rest of the healing is up to you, okay? I’ll leave you alone now,” Cas said. He squeezed Dean’s shoulder reassuringly and left.
Cas faced Dean, glaring at him in the eyes. He noticed that Dean didn't deny what he accused him for, "Goodbye Dean."
Dean remained quiet, watching Cas as he fidgeted with his food. Dean didn't know how to bring it up. He didn't want to push Cas away and ruin their long years of a solid friendship. He didn't want to make Cas feel unsafe or uncomfortable, and they had too much history to begin with. Dean really didn't know what to do.
"Yes, I do. But you're human after all. I had sworn I would never touch your soul after I put it back together when you were in hell. But I guess circumstances change," Cas said equally tired.
Sam sprinted into the face of danger as he always did. He grabbed the flare out of his jacket pocket, "hey ugly." He smirked at the wendigo, grabbing his attention.
"Yes, Dean." The trees swayed with the wind as if to say they agree. After a few quiet moments of hiking in the marsh, they came across a stream with stones protruding out of the water. Cas elegantly skipped on the stones, to the other side of the stream.
"Jesus," Cas moaned, placing his hands on Dean's waist desperately trying to get him off but with little success.
"A bit?" Cas asked, pretending to sound surprised. Dean slapped his arm playfully and Cas just went along with it.
Dean sighed, "we did and we may have gotten into a fight. But for a change, this one wasn’t my fault."
"As long as you don't make me watch your cowboy movies again," Cas laughed. He covered the waffles in case Sam or Jack wanted any food.
"Guilty," Lucifer chirped from the corner. Cas shook his head in disappointment and went over to Dean. He pressed two fingers onto Dean's forehead healing his cuts instantly.
It was late at night, around 10 pm when Sam and Dean got the news that the trucks were rolling in. Dean sprinted down the hallways to their garage, watching and waiting to see who would be left standing and walking on their two feet. Sam waited behind his brother tensely. Two men got off the first truck looking like they fought a hellhound, bloodied head to toe. The second truck came to a stop and out came a young girl with black curls, around Claire's age, and the angel in the trenchcoat.
"I only said that to Inias to settle their nerves. Dean, I got you back because I needed you back. Haven't the past few weeks proved that?"
“Yes, but” a guy starts next to the girl “being a professor is not just about research, right? What if you want to teach?”
He goes straight to the parking lot, finding Baby easily among the other cars. He throws his bag in the seat next to him and sighs, covering his face with his hands and breathing for minute. “You can do this, come on” he mutters to himself and starts the car.
The next morning is a repeat of yesterdays’ with the difference that Dean has to cook. He thinks of pasta with some pesto, he is certain they have a jar in the fridge, except he feels weird today and upon opening the cupboard, finds a pack of lasagna and decides that yes beef lasagna it is.
, isn’t on the top of his list. So, he stands up ready to leave, when Cas says the worst thing he could probably say right now.
He turns around pushes past Sam and speed walks to his room. He grabs his keys and goes straight to the garage, ignoring Sam’s and Jack’s calls.
“Oh, which part?” Castiel asks with excitement in his eyes, he loves that book. Albeit, it’s a bit difficult to read.
He laughs when the door closes and rests his head against the pillows for a moment and just breaths.
“Dude, no. It’s the movie, you know with Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz” Castiel continues to look at him with wide eyes. “You haven’t seen The Mummy? Who hasn't seen that movie?”
Dean listens Castiel’s deep baritone as he drones on about Virginia Woolf. His eyes staring at the book in front of him, opened at a random page, as he absently draws lines on the margins of the pages sticking out. The book was missing a few pages so he had to ask Alfie for a photocopy of those. He listens as he asks a question and then somebody’s answer and he thinks he needs to take Sam shopping this weekend, his jeans are getting short again. He sighs softly, drops his shoulders and stretches his legs as much as he can.
He sees Cas with Gabe and Anna, at a garden laughing at something, it’s such a rare expression on Cas face and Dean feels something, a kin to an insect, erupt in his stomach. He looks at another one with just Gabe and him, and another with him, Anna and a man he doesn't recognise. An old one, that is Cas and a woman at a beach, somewhere. There is another next to that, with a blonde guy who wears an obscene V shirt. One with Cas and, what assumes Dean is, Carmen laying on top off him, in an old couch (he realises it’s the one he saw before), that looks like it needs be thrown away yesterday, not that Dean can judge. They look comfortable and
He continues to gasp and let out small whimpers that for the life of him he cannot stop, not even when he is out in the hallway or at the safety of his room. It seems to be getting worse the moment he closes the door behind him. He stumbles and falls missing the edge of his bed and he lands on the floor his back against the side of it.
He pulls away, Dean immediate misses the warmth, “Come one” he tells him, moving to climb the stairs and Dean follows him.
“Sam has said a few stuff and I sort of read an entry of the diary and he talked to me about it- him” he trails off towards the end uncertain.
“April” his voice is neutral and so is his body language, but Dean can see just a hint of uneasiness, just a bit of tightness in his shoulders. He frowns slightly.
“The note was personal. Far too personal for something like this” She frowns and drums her fingers against her thigh. “Why would he send something like that to you?”
He goes back to the windmill three days later furious. He is so angry it fills him to the brim. It’s hot and so sweet in his tongue, fills his mouth and his head until all that he is, is anger. He shouts and curses at him and wants to hate him so much he convinces himself he does. A part of him really does for leaving him like this. Dean only allows it for a few seconds, just enough to let it happen, to go from his mind to his chest to his fingertips, until they tingle for one, two, three seconds and then vanish. Its place takes the hate for himself for feeling this way and then the dullness and fogginess that comes from the pain.
Dean tunes her out and checks a little bit of the room. On the counter there is a clear bowl and a sign above says “Don't leave without taking”, he realises it contains condoms. Maybe he should just take a few and leave. Yeah, that's what he should do, right about now, though he can’t seem to be able to move. Then, the door on the left of the counter opens and a woman comes out.
“I” his voice gives up after that, and he looks up at Castiel shrugging. “You don’t need to do this” he tells him and he means it, because really he doesn’t and it’s unnecessary.
Dean nods, tying his laces, “I’ll be back after five. I have to do the check up at the clinic and I need to stop at the store for food. Any requests?”
He hears a door close and exhales, puts his hands on the table, then on his legs and then crosses them again.
Donna has gone to Sioux Falls to stay with the girls for a little while. They need the time to stomach the situation with Chuck. Appearing and disappearing out of thin air, feeling as if they slept for a month and missed all the deadlines as Patience put it. But they are good for the most part, they are better together, Dean thinks.
He swallows, trying to stay calm. He can feel a headache forming and knows he needs coffee first and then, then he can think about everything else.
“Right” he says tightly, around a hurricane of emotions, it’s too early for this, it will always be too early for this.
She doesn’t immediately turn to look at them, only when Amanda says, in a tone that Dean recognizes from Sam and he cringes, that they have some questions for her. She tenses for a second and then turns to them, her lips are chapped, her nose is red, her eyes are swollen and there is an anguish and a vacancy in them. Dean swallows averting his eyes unable to look at her long.
Dean is in the kitchen with Miracle when he hears their voices. He is cooking dinner for the first time in more than two weeks, he even went into trouble to find something new to make and stumbled upon a Greek recipe called pastitsio that he knows Claire would like.
“Hello-” she freezes for a moment and Dean can see from the corner of his eyes Cas doing the same thing, but then she gives them a tight smile and walks to the end of the bed and stands there stiffly.
He wets his lips and listen as footsteps ascend the stairs, walking steadily towards him until they stop outside the door.
“I know what you mean” He tells him and as he turns to leave he adds “Whatever you need you know I’m here”
Novak has an aura around him that has Dean stand to attention, he is one of those people that’s imposing and authoritative without doing anything. Effortlessly. It makes something in Deans’ stomach curl and not in a bad way. Although his gaze does make him shift uncomfortably. Dean likes
When the lecture ends, he picks up his stuff, and leaves the room hastily without looking up and heads to the library; he needs to return the book he borrowed for statistics, and what was supposed to be a one hour study session turns into three of studying microeconomics, before he mans up enough to admit that he needs to confront the thing that is nudging the back of his mind.
He watches as Oli lays down too, from sitting up on the bed next to him. He always sleeps on the end of the bed, but now lays next to Dean, who reaches a hand and touches the soft fur and cries.
He sits down next to him, a person distance between them, as close as you can get to Dean these days.
, every time he touches a bottle. Joins them at board games with Eileen, even goes to the movies with them one night.
“Don't, don't go there” he can’t take it not today, he doesn't know if he will ever be able to take it. Besides, this thing between them it was bound to break, nothing like that lasts, not with Dean. And even if it did, he wouldn't know what to do with it.
He shrugs at Billie and suddenly feels the anger in his chest at his dad, that is always there and like always he drowns it. He waits for her to say something. To tell him what they accomplish just now with all these.
Dean swallows, at the tone and words, and turns his head to look at him. They just stare at each other and Dean nods – he doesn't know what for – just barely and leaves.
Besides the nightmares are not the worst. They are bad, but Dean knows what to do with them, had them all of his life. He knows what happens. The worst, the ones that paralyze him, that leave him trembling unable to get up, are the dreams.
“Look, Cas. I’m sorry” when he gets no response, he continues rubbing his neck “I shouldn't have reacted like that.”
They end up naked on the bed, Dean on top of him trailing kisses all over, trying to find spots that pull those sounds that Cas makes, that have his toes curl and make Dean want to devour him. There are moments where he looks up at Cas and finds him already looking at him as if he can’t believe that he is having this with Dean and Dean in answer, holds him tighter, better, tries to make him feel as much loved and wanted as Dean feels with him.
Dean watches him until he slips through the door and then continues to stare at the door for a minute or so. He feels lightheaded and confused and a little happy and he hates that. He sticks his hand in his pockets and walks towards the general direction of his apartment complex, maybe he will catch a bus or something.
Dean's vision swims and he fights to get the words out, "I still like girls," he blurts, tears escaping "I, I just- just sometimes it's not-"
“Yeah,” Jo starts and Dean already knows he isn’t going to like what she is going to say “he has people to see. Or them him. You know how he gets in debates or when he is passionate about something.”
“Hey,” Sam says with a tentative smile, his brows furrowing slightly glancing at Cas and back at Dean.
He always wondered if it was Cas, if had seen him, his true self, but Cas not to traumatize Dean, had locked it away from his awareness. He shivers at the thought, rolls on his side and tries to fall asleep.
“Chuck” Novak nods and walks to his desk. Dean glances at him and their eyes meet, and he loses a breath and a heartbeat.
He got him a little more than a year ago, well actually Eileen practically dumped him on Dean. Some asshole had left a box with eight of them behind Sam and Eileen’s’ building; Sam found them one day by chance. Oli and two girls where the only alive ones. They took them to the vet, who checked them, told them they weren’t more than three weeks old and gave them the appropriate care instructions. But they couldn't keep them, they already had a dog and despite being dog lovers, didn't really want any more, so they put an add. Unfortunately, one of the girls didn't make it past the third night, the other one was given within the second week, but Oli was still there after three weeks. He was a little shy and skittish, no one could blame him, but seemed to like Dean, who in return wasn't very fond of him. It wasn't anything personal, Dean just wasn't fond of dogs, he still isn’t by the way, Oli is an exception, as he told everyone countless of times.
“I don't care about the money Sam” he interjects, for the hundredth time, and stops pacing, looking at the half-eaten cereal on the table. And he can’t even begin to think of Sam in this
“I didn’t do anything” when Dean opens his mouth ready to retort, ha relents “Ok. You are welcome. It was the least I could do”
They take Deans’ car, that Castiel stares at for about a minute with both an appreciative and apprehensive look. Which is odd and Dean has no idea how he can manage both at once. But he does get inside, leaving his satchel in the space between his feet and looks like he is about to say something but, seems to think better of it and just puts his seatbelt on. Dean lets him choose the place and after some protest, Castiel directs him to a place, that according to him makes the best burgers in Washington, DC. When Dean looks at it, he is kind of reluctant to believe it. It is in a small street, shoved between a dry cleaners and a funeral home, and looks like it has been forgotten since the 1950s’, but takes Castiels’ word for it. That's how they end up in a booth, after having order two bacon cheeseburgers, one with fries and the other with a salad.
He opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling frowning, he tries to remember when his fantasies turned into Cas, and how it was hard to think of the exact expression on his face, but now it is so different. Because now Dean knows Cas’ face. Knows his expressions, he knows just how he tilts his head on the side and frowns when he is confused or doesn't know something, or when he scrunches his nose at a greasy food Dean is probably eating or that small smile he gets when he eats that stupid yogurt that Dean still doesn't remember what’s in it or that melancholy that pools in his eyes sometimes and yes basically Dean is screwed.
“I know you are doing this so we can be connected in a way. But, Dean we are connected, I know we drifted apart for a while, but now we are doing better, aren’t we? You are my brother and I care for you.
, says and starts to remove Dean’s jacket. Through the fog in his mind, Dean has half the mind to think, C. J. Novak, C for Castiel. Weird name. He kind of likes it.
Once he is dressed, he returns to the kitchen, puts the pizzas in the oven, sets the timer and goes to where Sam is.
Cas finger pushes against his rim and looks at him expectantly not believing him, so Dean repeats with a content sigh and a dopey smile, “Nothing.”
He nods his head in greeting, when he sees Lily in the reception talking to a man and she smiles back at him. He moves to the second floor where the literature books are and he starts to browse the shelves, not looking for anything in particular. He hasn't been in the library in a while. He sees a few people sitting at the tables by the windows and he sighs softly, overtaken by nostalgia. A memory of two men sitting at one of those tables, each reading a book the other had chosen, comes to his mind. He presses his lips together in a tight line and continues down the library.
Something moves in Dean’s stomach, and he scolds at himself, what did he expect anyways, an apartment like his? Novak is a sensible guy, he would live in sensible house.
. It’s just something that is his, entirely, he does by and for himself. He feels a little selfish, having that thought, but it doesn't bother him much. Besides he is going to tell Sam eventually.
Dean doesn’t really talk much. He doesn’t come out of his room much either, only to walk Miracle after Sam calls him out on it. He drinks a lot, eats when he cannot take the hunger any longer - although he has become good at ignoring it, like when he was a kid - or when Sam forces him to.
He doesn’t move, only takes half a breath, continues to stare down at his feet. He bites his lip, not hard enough to bleed, but just enough to feel the pain to remind himself to breathe.
“Professor” Novak raises his eyes and find hers, nodding in acknowledgement, “Next semester we are supposed to do poetry, right?” Novak gives her another nod, brows furrowing, head tilting just so.
Castiel moves towards them, feeling hypnotised and only when he stands in front of Dean does he break eye contact to look at Donna, who is looking at him in surprise and slightly suspicious.
“Trying to prove to me that lawyers can have fun? And we saw each other on Tuesday, and though I know you can’t live without me, that is too soon even for you”
Castiel closes the door softly and swallows thickly, closing his eyes for just a moment, just enough so he won’t bang his fist against the wood. He turns to Claire who is staring at the door and he takes a steading breath to calm himself and hopefully stop the trembling of his hands
Rather he takes a breath, then another one in hopes to appear more composed and walks out of his office, letter in his hand.
“You have a case” it wasn’t a question “Well, I just wanted to let you know that you are coming with Anna, Gadreel and me tomorrow, we are going to White Wendigo. Charlie is coming too”
He opens the car door and takes the paper bag Cas has left in his seat, before sitting down and closes the door with a bit more force than necessary. Cas starts driving and says “Whatever he told you please ignore it”
By the time Cas has a third a third finger in, Dean is a mess, his right nipple is still between Cas’ thumb and index finger because it is more sensitive than the left one and Cas apparently loves watching Dean pant and moan and generally be a mess.
Dean can’t help staring at him as he gets under the covers and after a moment, he follows him. It’s warm and soft and it smells like Cas. They turn on their sides, just staring at each other open, with no restrains, feet tangled.
When he is done, he takes a sheet of paper and writes down what they know about the two murders. They are both men, in their twenties, white, the time between the two murders is eleven days, they were found in a hotel room and both were sex workers. Castiel puts a question mark next to the last one, since they don’t really know about the second victim.
“But you and Castiel,” he flinches so hard on the name his hand knocks underneath the table causing it to rattle, the salt shaker falls and spills and Sam’s herbal tea splashes a little and the fork left on the side of the plate falls to the ground with a cluttering sound that hurts Dean’s body.
He lets out a breath, “Ok” he clicks his tongue and repeats, “Ok”. Then turns to Castiel, who is watching him waiting.
Dean will always remember the day he saw Claire in heaven. It was before Jody and Donna and Alex. Before Patience. Before Sam. She died at the age of 35. Drunk driver.
He suddenly feels the need to bolt, so Castiel won’t see him or worse talk to him. He has no idea why he feels this way, it’s not exactly shame but it is pretty close and he needs to leave. He doesn't like how he reacts when he is around Castiel, he is moving between comfort, which is ridiculous, shame and a sense like there is an abyss between them that, for whatever reason, Dean feels he can cross.
He watches him as he sets up the power point. He is wearing a dark suit and his blue tie is a little askew. When he is done and the first slide open on the screen, showing Albert Camus and underneath in smaller writing Dr C. J. Novak. Right the BA lead, perhaps he is sharing the course with Anna. He finally looks up, and Dean watches his eyes and thinks that the blue is familiar, but he can’t place it. Novaks’ expression is neutrally serious as he watches them, his eyes fall on Dean for a moment, just a second before looking at someone else. Then he starts to talk in a modulated deep rumble, that has Deans’ stomach flutter and he has to swallow.
He is interrupted by his phone ringing (which Dean is kind of glad about it he doesn't think he wants to know the end of that sentence), and he reaches for it, his face turning hard and his lips turning downwards reading the screen.
“That I can’t do whatever I want and get away with because you are not donating to the school and I’m on scholarship.”
“Since everything is good, and you don't need any adjustments, I’ll just pack it for you and you can take it” Benjamin says, and Castiel nods at them and walks back in the dressing room and Dean exhales in relief, shifting in his seat.
They reach the landing, and it’s one more flight of stairs. Dean sighs softly, feeling the buzz under his skin and swallows, fingers itching to touch. Cas turns around and Dean raises his eyes and meets his. His breath becomes more elevated and Cas surges forward and kisses him. It’s heady and Dean wants more now. Cas bites his lip and Dean makes a sound at the back of his throat and steps backwards, detaching himself from Cas.
When seconds pass with nothing happening but him looking at her as before, she starts to relaxes marginally. Her palms open and lay on top of the counter, next to the full cup of tea.
He makes a sandwich, just ham and cheese and eats it along with the coffee and when he is done, he brews another one, but uses a thermos instead of a mug. He makes his way back to the bedroom and changes into a pair of jeans, an undershirt and a long-sleeved shirt and grabs a pair of socks form the drawer on his way out.
He has been studying for almost two and a half hours when he stops to take a break, and it’s just his luck that when he looks around, he spots Castiel at the counter waiting for his coffee. He is dressed in slacks and that trench coat, with his black laptop bag hanging on his shoulder, like always. Dean stares at his profile, heart racing, throat tight. Then Castiel turns and he looks right at him. Startled for a moment before he seems to think something over and turns around saying something to the guy at the bar who glances at Dean and back at Castiel nodding.
He walks to class on Friday, and gets his pen out and his laptop, but doesn't turn it on, and doodles on his notebook, so his eyes don't stray to Novak. he doesn't succeed entirely.  But it’s fine because he only catches his gaze once and for barely a second. Still he feels hot all over and he wants all this to be over or for Novak to continue to look at him without that guard in his eyes. Perhaps Dean is self-destructive after all.
Dean looks at him, his -really soft- hair are sticking everywhere more so than usual, his coat is almost off from his left shoulder, and his eyes are glazed over, looking at Dean so heatedly and adoringly at the same time. Dean who is wearing a shirt that has seen better days and loose sweatpants from when he was like twenty five. He kind of wants to ask him how he is real. Instead he surges forward, they almost stumble and kisses him with all his might.
, Sam?” he tries not to make a voice at the words, remembering Billie’s advice, but judging at the look Castiel gives him, he fails.
“Do you think that maybe he just doesn't want me?” he says at last, looking at Crowley uncertainly, feeling small in a way he hasn't in a long time.
“Don't be baby.” he mocks her. “He caused an explosion last time. I can’t believe Ellen is going to let him be here”
“Dean” he says and the guy, Andy, smiles at him, teeth showing now and he mirrors it, before taking a sip of his beer for lack of anything else and holds back the grimace this time. Maybe he should order another one.
Dean rolls his eyes, and chews slightly on his lip. He seems like he wants to say something, but then stops himself.
Dean is the one that huffs a laugh now, honest this time “It’s not a shot”. Plus, certain beers are good in room temp, just not this one.
Dad had raised his eyes from his plate, studying, dark, the edges tightening before Dean looked down at his plate, swallowing thickly the canned beans in his mouth, his palms sweaty.
“and I talked with him and everything is taken care of. Can we go now?” he says and without waiting for a reply, starts to walk towards the exit. Dean watches him for a moment before following him outside.
He needs to go. He hears Castiel say something that is followed by a woman’s voice that is coming closer to the kitchen as the seconds go by and he has only a moment to collect himself before she enters the kitchen.
Cas makes a sound and then, then they are kissing. Cas cold hands coming to cup Deans’ face but he shudders for a completely different reason. Cas kisses him with certainty, his lips slightly chapped and it feels so good, so grounding and causes goosebumps to raise in Deans’ body and he wants more. Until Cas moans softly and then he remembers what he is doing, what they are doing and pulls back.
I'm sorry it took so long. Truthfully it was supposed to be longer, but I decided to break it into two chapters.
“I got the phone call at the end of his class and I was upset, so he offered” he says nonchalantly, shrugging, putting more food in his mouth, hoping that will stop Sam and whatever train of thought he has.
“That's a fine specimen” she says openly staring at Novak, who is now getting inside his car, and Dean splutters. “I’ve seen him a few times before on campus”
“Coming right up.” He says, the smile not leaving his face and there is something else in his eyes, that Dean can’t tell what it is. “That will be 4.10, please”
Dean can hear a ringing in his ears and he is aware he is staring and that his breathing is elevated. At some point he feels Oli press at his leg, then he tugs him softly towards the direction of the house. But Dean doesn't budge. He can’t move. He can’t think. It’s so foggy.
“Yes” he says shortly, frowning and going to the passengers’ seat. He sits down and can’t help but fidget. Gog it’s so fucking-
Dean considers him. “Ok, one, most dads compared to mine look like good dads and two, still not an excuse. I did what I did and it was wrong, it was- it was cruel and I’m sorry.”
“I don’t care.” She rolls her eyes at him and he ignores her, skimming through the list of ingredients of both spells. Pretty basic, they have almost everything in the Bunker.
“I’d marry you” his stupid brain says before he can stop himself and he goes to correct himself, but Castiel laughs.
On Saturday, he takes the day off. Tells Ellen he doesn't feel very well and she gives it to him far too easily; he must sound worse than he thought.
Cas came back his feelings would go away, as if they are an illusion that he experienced when Cas was gone. Now he sounds stupid and as Sam would say in denial.
“Right” Explains the lack of text message. Dean feels a rush of irrational irritation at Sam, even though he knows he can’t control those these things. “Well, then I’ll just”
“You wanted to be outside and you weren’t allowed,” he interjects “The alternative was looking out the stupid windows. And I have a feeling it wasn't just when you studied that windows or other things you liked were off limits.”
“Good evening to you too Dean” he gears Sams’ voice from the other side, and though the comment sarcastic it is overshadowed by his excitement.
and Amanda cuts in offering to show them. Sam moves with her and looks at Dean expecting him to follow, but he stays put nodding at Michael to go with him instead. He ignores Sam’s disapproving face and Michael’s frown and as if to drive the point home takes a seat on a stool bar across from Esme.
Cas turns to him and smiles, “Really good, although, I don't want to do it again. All those people that wanted to talk to me after, more so than usual” he frowns.
“No, well yes. I love art” he says and walks, so he is standing just a few steps in front of Dean and touches the book, smiling faintly. “I-” he looses his voice for a moment and tries again. “I studied art history at university”
“Where is the lube?” he asks, tongue coming out to wet his lips, and watches as Castiel heavy lidded tracks the movement.
“No, I’m watching The Mummy” he indicates with his head towards the theatre, behind Castiel, who looks at him quizzically.
“I’m offering” he says seriously, looking worried and dejected, like he has no right to be. “Besides you won’t be any good to, ugh, Sam, if you have an accident”
“So”, she starts placing the papers on a stuck on the side of the desk and turning to Dean expectantly, “do you have the forms?”
He parks the car in the garage and gets in the house, using the door that joins the garage with the rest of the house. He has yet to get used to living there and sometimes he misses his apartment, not that he considered it any more of a home than he does this one, but it was small and he didn't feel as lonely as he does in this one. He goes to the kitchen and drinks a glass of water, and then another half and heads upstairs to his bedroom.
So, after spending the entire week talking to Cas, moping, and spilling his guts to Benny on Thursday night (after shift, cause Jo), since when he came back he found Dean, eyeing his phone with a sad expression and unable to make a dissent drink, Dean finds himself Saturday night, in an overly busy bar opening beer bottles and trying not to think about what has happened in St Peters’ church two and a half hours ago. He doesn't succeed in his utter annoyance.
"Well, we-" Sam began but stopped when Lucifer held his hand up. His eyes were studying the angel. Castiel shifted uncomfortably.
They didn't have long until the rift would close. Cas followed Dean, as they made their way back retracing their steps. Cas was extremely quiet, and Dean sensed that something was wrong.
“I hurt you. I hurt you, and I can never take that back,” Dean said, the weird uneasy feeling coming back from his stomach up to his throat. Dean groaned as he threw up again.
Castiel was resting and was stirred awake by a shrilling scream that echoed into his room. He immediately recognized it as Dean's voice. His heart froze in place but he managed to scramble out of bed, sprinting down the hall.
The first thing Dean saw was the massive chandelier swinging from the ceiling looking like it's about to fall. Then he saw the table in front of the TV which was literally lined with gold. There was a massive spiral staircase leading to squeaky clean tiles covering the ground.
There was something about the way Dean said those words that Cas absolutely detested, "You don't mean that."
Dean looked at Cas, "You gave so much to these people, and they would just let you go? That's so shitty."
"I don't think you need stitches to your head, but this cut on your stomach is still pretty bad even though the bleeding has stopped. I'll have to stitch that up," Dean said slowly.
As Dean slept, Cas kept an eye out for any odd sounds and all his other senses were on high alert. He watched Dean sleep, as he sat nearby on a rock. His eyes wandered over Dean, up and down. The hunter looked peaceful when he slept, and Cas had always admired that about the man. Dean wasn't a monster, he was just complicated. Very complicated. Cas sighed. He didn't know how to fix everything with Dean. They were so broken, hurt, and their anger was pulling them apart. Every time Cas had tried to talk, Dean would raise his voice and start yelling, shoving nasty words and statements down Cas's throat. Cas hated it. He missed the way they were before. When they were hopeful and when they fought for each other with everything they had. Dean's faith in Castiel had never faltered. Until now.
Castiel burst open the door to Dean's room and found Dean gripping the sheets in his sleep, yelling "NO, DON'T DO THIS!" at the top of his lungs. His knuckles were going white and tears were crawling out. Anyone who knew Dean fucking Winchester knew that this man did not shed tears, even if Death herself asked him to.
"Yeah, me. Use me as bait. Lure Michael out from wherever the fuck he is, and we hit him when he's distracted," Dean said like it was so obvious.
The wound healed perfectly, good as new. Dean looked at his hand, forming a fist. He no longer felt any pain.
I know you hate his guts, but you're going to keep your trap shut. When you talk back to him, he's going to come after
"Alright! So I was thinking maybe you guys can join the detective and myself today. Solve a mystery and perhaps find the answer to your mystery as well. What do you say?" Lucifer asked smiling widely.
Dean pulled Cas into him, his stare burning into Cas's eyes, "Of course it fucking matters! You're all that matters!"
"It makes sense when you say it like that. Cas spent a whole year worried out of his mind about you. And he finally gets you back and he's probably scared you'll get taken away from him again. Think about it, Dean. He still wants you as a friend, I'm sure. He
After a heated argument between Sam and Dean, they decided to track down the Lucifer in this universe. If anyone were to know about alternative universes, it would be a supernatural being such as the devil himself. If he was the real deal.
The witch smirked, magically transforming a wooden stick on the ground into a glorious silver sword to match Sam's one. She used her magic, levitating the sword in the air pointing it at Sam. Sam dodged attacks by the bewitched sword smoothly but he was quickly losing ground as the witch stood there not moving a single muscle, making her magical sword do all the work. Dean cursed as he hurried to Sam's aid. Dean swung his sword maliciously, both brothers fighting side by side against a witch. That sounded more like Sam and Dean. Dean thrust his sword forward putting his weight into it, and Sam attacked from the side. But this was an
"But I felt something when he walked by me- like power was radiating off him and wait- you think he's
Dean now looked up at Cas's striking blue eyes, "Pretty good for someone who just had some of their soul ripped away from them and travelled across to a different reality." His sarcasm earned a soft smile from the angel.
Dean gulped, trying to keep the acids and the bile down in his stomach, "I remember you breaking my heart."
"Just friends," Both Dean and Cas answered simultaneously, and maybe a little too quickly. Magnus snickered, and Alec quickly nudged him to stop.
fucked up this time. So you know about how we got kicked out, right?" Claire nodded. "Well, while we were on the streets trying to make our way here, Cas and I got close. And I mean, like, really close. Days were fucking long, nights were too cold, and Cas kept me company. I've been on my own in those streets before, and it nearly drove me out of my god damn mind, Claire. But having Cas changed everything. He made sure I always had food, he made sure I was always warm. And then I went and wanted more and ruined everything."
One by one, the kids and teenagers stood up, cheering on Cas. Dean was so star-struck he didn't have it in him to be pissed anymore. Cas was touched. These are the kids he spoke to every day. He laughed with them, he looked after them like they were his own. Sam was beaming, his eyes quickly making contact with Cas.
"Jack, stay with the rest of the hostages, and call the police," Cas ordered as he strained his eyes away from Dean, and Jack obliged.
Cas rolled his eyes, "I don't know all the details, but generally, yes." Dean laughed. Cas probably knew all his dirty little secrets and regrets, and he knew it should make him uncomfortable, but this was
Cas squeezed Dean one final time and pulled away. When he withdrew himself, he very quickly placed a kiss on Dean's cheek. It was so fast that Dean was scared he imagined it. But Cas had that sneaky annoying sparkle in his eyes that said otherwise. Sam was smirking and smiling in the background while helping Rowena clean up the mess, and pretending like he didn't see his older brother turn a new shade of pink.
The door opened and a man in a dark maroon coat entered the room. A few heads turned and Dean almost choked on his food. The man looked nervous and uncomfortable as he stepped forward slowly.
Dean paced himself, "Cas, I'm sorry. I fucked up, big time. I was so blinded by my rage and grief, that I shut you out, and I became the last person I ever wanted to be. You gave me everything, you were always there for me, and you cared for me. I was stupid and big-headed, and I didn't realise how much I was hurting you. I know we can't fix this, but I just- I need you to know how fucking sorry I am."
"I don't need to eat. You do," said Cas. Dean shrugged and grabbed out a few packaged sandwiches, and a bottle of water. Dean chugged the water down, remembering to leave some for later, or for Cas. Once Cas was sure they were safe, he sat on the rock opposite Dean. Dean didn't look but continued to eat.
Dean gulped, "I can't take back what I did to you. How I hurt you, and what I said. But I want to make things right.”
The afternoon drew in. The maids got the brothers ready for the ball, fussing over Sam's hair, and Dean's suit. They talked about how Dean would find his perfect match from this ball and Dean wanted to scream. When the brothers walked into the ballroom, the room fell silent in respect.
Castiel rolled his eyes as if it were obvious, "Dean surely you figured it out by now? I am your guardian angel. I always have been. Why do you think the angels assigned me to drag your ass out of hell during our apocalypse days? Why do you think you were so closely bonded to me?"
"They're still there, you just can't see them," Castiel answered one of Dean's burning questions and finally found the strength to stand up, "you're an idiot you know that?"
"Damnit, Cas! I can't- won't leave you again," Dean said, desperately. Cas looked at Dean, seeing the past year's worth of pain and loss engraved onto his face.
Lucifer nodded in awe, remembering how he nearly took a bullet for Chloe or rather when Chloe put a bullet in HIM.
written in Cas's handwriting and Dean immediately knew where the story was going. Sam found him and pat his brother's back.
"So, are ya gonna finish these pancakes or what?" Dean asked, breaking the tension easily with his humour. Cas shrugged, pushing the plate towards Dean, who gratefully just ate the whole damn thing.
Dean bit his lips nervously, trying not to think about the possibility of Cas dying. He nodded and stitched the skin back together, earning a quiet hiss from Cas. Cas gripped Dean's shoulder tightly, teeth-gritting through the pain. Dean cleaned the rest of the blood and covered the area with some bandages.
Just then, the bell rang out and Lucifer stepped out from the elevator, "So, Maze decided to skip out on all the fun because all this interdimensional mystery-solving was too much for her- Oh, you seem happy." Lucifer smiled when he saw Dean grinning from ear to ear.
Dean watched. He put a hand to touch the delicate feathers and then paused. Cas said it was okay, so he continued. Castiel's wings felt like holding a velvet blanket. The feathers were crazy soft and Cas responded to Dean's touch by making a hmph noise. Dean entangled his fingers into the wings
Cas was grinning like an idiot, "I know. I know you love me. I know you care. I know you would never hurt me, and what happened between us, that's long gone, forgotten and forgiven. I don't want you to think about that spell, or what you did. It's in the past. Focus on us, now."
"I think first things first, I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry, do you hear me? I'm sorry for the way I treated you, for every single shitty thing I said. You were right. I'm a huge asshole. I just used you as my punching bag and god, Cas, you don't deserve it. But you were never just a tool or a weapon. You were my friend, the one person I knew I could trust no matter what, and now I just fucked it all up," Dean's voice broke.
A part of Dean wanted to scream, but he kept his composure, the sadness waving in, "Yeah, I figured. Sorry I brought it up."
"Thanks," Dean replied. Cas let go, gave a small smile, and wandered out of the room. Dean finally let out the breath he had been holding onto the entire time.
"Hmm… maybe we just have to play it out? Remember when Gabriel stuck us in that game show and Dr Sexy? Like that. We stay and act our parts until the end of the Cinderella story," Sam said.
When they got back, Dean and Castiel went separate ways immediately. Cas went to talk with Jody and Donna about their plans. They didn't have spare beds for their incoming guests so everyone was asked to bring blankets, pillows or sleeping bags. Food and security were provided by the camp. Jody and Donna were excited to see Sam again. They trusted Cas's input and instincts but they knew they could do better with Sam there too. The more the merrier, right?
stick with a Shadowhunter, as they aren't equipped to fight this demon, like we are. Sam will stay with Clary, Castiel with Alec going from the back. Jace and Isabelle will go from the front and try to distract the demon. I'll go from the back as well, and try to rescue Dean first. Once we know Dean is safe, then I'll gladly send her ass back to hell," Magnus said with a menacing smile at the end.
His brother held him close, "Let's find a motel and crash there for tonight, okay?" Dean looked at his brother, and suddenly he felt small. He was the one who was supposed to be looking after Sam. But at that moment, he nodded, letting Sam look after
Dean clenched his fists together, "You don't know what he's capable of, Cas. My dad can be a prick, I know, but he did his best when he raised me and Sam. And I know you disagree. And trust me, I'm touched that you even care, but please, stay out of it. If my dad figures out how to kill angels, you're going to be number 1 on his hit list, alright?" Dean saw uncertainty in Cas's eyes for the first time.
Dean tried talking to Cas but every time he did, Cas walked away and refused to look him in the eye, leaving the hunter very confused and lost. It got so bad that Cas couldn't even stand to be in the same
"Is that how you show your love, Dean? So, it was love at first sight, huh?" Lucifer pressed further, his smirk growing.
They stayed in a weird silence for a while. It wasn't awkward or uneasy, but it wasn't entirely comfortable either.
"Save your strength," was all Cas said in return. He placed his hand on Dean's bare chest, watching how Dean winced at his touch and prayed that Dean will pull through this.
Sam's little smirk made Cas smile, "Yes, I am aware. You and your brother really know how to keep me on my toes, huh?"
Dean looked at his brother, "She was right. Rosaline and so many others are dead because of me. Because Cas spent a whole fucking year looking for me. Why didn't you stop him?"
"Cas if it's okay with you, can I see your wings again?" Dean asked a bit hesitantly. Castiel looked up at him and stood up doing that little confused head tilt he does.
"Maybe I can shift the pain," the angel said, closing his eyes. Cas tried to use his angel mojo to absorb and shift Dean's pain onto himself and it was almost unbearable. The pain hit him like a shit-ton of bricks. It weighed him down both physically and mentally.
The dinner ended smoothly, with Dean remaining silent for most of it, and John went to the guest room to clean up and sleep. They would figure out how to send him back tomorrow. Sam threw away the Chinese take away boxes and chopsticks, while Dean, almost immediately, rushed into his bedroom. He closed the door and let out a massive breath. Did he just accidentally and unintentionally come out to his entire family? Or
The waitress arrived with Cas's glass of water, apologised again and departed, leaving Dean oddly satisfied.
Castiel stared out from the balcony, admiring the city below when he heard some footsteps following close behind.
Dean looked at her, speechless. But he saw it. The pain of losing your loved ones. It was written all over her face. He felt everyone's eyes drilling into him.
"I hurt him, Sam! Of course, he hates me! No wonder he can't even look me in the fucking eye. I was supposed to be his
"It's okay if you don't want to. I just thought you would feel safer and more comfortable with me, than on your own," Cas said, noticing Dean's hesitation.
The angel finally looked up and their eyes met. Dean felt like Cas was staring into his probably broken and fractured soul. There was a heat that travelled up Dean's spine and all over his body. It was always like this when he looked at Cas, or especially when he would catch Cas staring at
Everyone respected Castiel. Cas was kind, compassionate and open-minded to new ideas and opinions, however, he was brutal and stern when he had to be. He made difficult decisions with Sam's guidance. Cas had sent out small teams now and again in hopes of finding Dean. Something in his heart and gut told him Dean was still alive, so regardless of what everyone said, he didn't give up. He couldn't.
"Usually, the prince finds Cinderella and then they kiss. That's how the story ends. I mean they get married too but that’s like a fast forward skip you know?" Dean said quietly rambling into the night, avoiding Cas's eyes at all costs.
"During the last few moments of the spell, it got really nasty, Dean. You said some shit to Cas, but Cas still stood his ground. He tried to bring you back. And then- then- you punched him. And you didn't stop. When Cas was weak, you- you took his angel blade and you- cut him up, straight down the chest. I walked in time to stop you from doing anything worse, but Cas- Cas was broken."
Sam finally found the one they were looking for and almost cried with happiness and pain looking at the size of the book.
"Dean, I never imagined this would happen when I did what I did. I didn't think we would even become this close. Or that I would even still be alive," Cas said inaudibly.
Castiel sighed gazing back. He couldn't refuse Dean, "When you were in hell, I- well I repaired your soul and put you back together. I'm afraid that if I try to perform this procedure on you… that it will break you," Castiel said staring intensely at Dean.
"Oh hey! How did you get my number?" Sam asked walking around the table to get his muscles working again.
"Shut up, Castiel." That was what did it for Cas. Dean never called Cas by his full name unless he was serious unless it was the last straw.
After a pause, Dean looked up, "You remember a while ago when I had amnesia, I asked if you felt like there was someone you're supposed to look after? To love?"
"Dean, you were under a spell. Cas forgave you, but I think- I think it still pains to see you. I gave in and called Rowena, but Cas never gave up hope that you would come back to him. That you would fight the spell. But you didn't, hell, you
Dean found the strength to look at Cas, and honestly, Cas's smile was so stunning it took his breath away.
Dean found Cas in his room, going through some old lore books. Cas was surprised to find Dean standing by the door, looking pale as though he had seen… well not a ghost, Dean would be thrilled to see a ghost, but perhaps something even worse.
Dean quickly caught his arm, "Okay, sure. But I- uh- I was wondering… when you're done, maybe I can treat you with dinner? I can give you my number-"
"I feel extremely under-dressed," Dean said looking at the fancy restaurant they were about to dine in and then looking down as his worn-out boots, his old jacket and stained jeans. Lucifer held opened the door for him.
"You've got a good kid over there," Lucifer said eyes trailing Jack, "I would have thought he would be more menacing and well, devilish."
"Hey, come back to bed with me. Sam's passed out and Jack's having some Harry Potter movie marathon. Stay with me, we can have our own movie marathon," Dean said. He wasn't sure if he was pushing his luck this time, but Cas just shrugged and agreed.
Dean's heart stopped when he saw his little brother storm up to him, wrapping his massive muscular arms around the hunter almost suffocating him. Dean let go of Cas, so he could hug Sam back.
"Although I seem to be doing a pretty terrible job of keeping you safe lately. You can't be tamed Dean Winchester," Castiel continued with a stupid smirk as he began to walk away.
Dean rolled his eyes and sat down. He bit his lips as he did when he was nervous, and stared at the wooden table in sudden fascination, "I- uh- ok, so this is going to sound crazy, but I saw this guy at this coffee shop a few days ago. And then before that at a motel. He, uh, I dunno, he was very kind and I wanted to ask him out for dinner but he was so- he seemed so-"
"We're at war. We're bound to lose people, but we need to stand together. Thank you for bringing your concerns to me, you may leave," Cas said. Inias bowed a little and left hurriedly. Soon after, Sam and Dean followed into his tent.
"Dean, you know Sam and I fully support you, right? Although I can't speak for your father. But what you're feeling, it's valid. You're allowed to love whoever you want, as long as you're happy, and he/she or they, treat you right." It was the words that Dean needed to hear all his life.
"Tell me about it. Although I must say I prefer this version of Lucifer over our own," Cas replied thoughtfully.
"So, they got jumped by a few of Michael's monsters. Out of the first group we sent on the hunt, two out of five are dead. The second group is bringing everyone in. They'll be here by late evening."
When Dean woke up later the same day, he found that Cas was gone. On the other side of the bed, however, were a beautiful bouquet of vibrant red roses and a note.
"Oh, bloody hell you again. We've been through this Jacob! I will not do you any more favours, that's not how this works!" Lucifer yelled casually but received a bullet to the chest as a reply. He swore under his breath, taking note to cover Dean from danger and imminent death.
Dean inhaled, and nodded, "thank you, for literally everything." Dean fell into Cas's arms, finally letting the tears splurt out. Cas held him tightly.
"He used his grace, Cas has a few tricks up his sleeve," Dean said, careful not to mention the stuff with the wings. He wasn't sure if Cas would appreciate him telling their friends about all that. Claire didn't seem convinced but she dropped the topic, waving a goodnight before Dean went off to his room.
"These nightmares aren't just going to disappear. There's nothing anyone can do to fix this because I'm so fucking broken beyond repair. There's no point talking about this," Dean said, suddenly tired and exhausted.
"This is different. I know it's been around 10 years now, but the human soul is fragile and takes a long time to repair, especially after the suffering you went through in hell. I put your soul together using my grace but if I try to meddle with it again, I'm afraid it'll all collapse."
The man stood up, fixed his expensive suit and held out a hand, "I am, indeed. Lucifer Morningstar at your service. How may I help you dashing lads?" Lucifer's eyes landed on Dean. Sam awkwardly shook Lucifer's hand trying his best not to flinch. Sam has had some harrowing and traumatizing experiences with their Lucifer that he would not like to re-visit.
Cas brought his wings closer, "Of course." Dean was still too awestruck by Cas's massive wings to do anything. He just brought the wings closer and placed a soft kiss in the middle of the bush of feathers. Cas's feathers suddenly livened and puffed up.
Dean pulled away awkwardly, not knowing what else to say or do. Sam helped the others pull out the bodies and lay them on the ground. Dean didn't want to let go of Cas, but Cas was already walking towards the bodies. He knelt, touching two fingers to their foreheads and shaking his head. Jody left to call their deceased's friends and families and prepare a quick funeral, but Donna stayed behind. The very injured and bruised hunters left to their doctor to patch themselves back up but Cas remained. Cas stood back up, eyes fixated on Sam.
The little girl handed Cas a feather, his feather, "I found this in the corridor, the feather you gave Dean. You should have it back, it belongs to you." Cas could feel Dean was watching him intensely.
"But in every version, you would beg me not to kill you. I think that's where she went wrong. Because ultimately when it came down that day in that crypt, you didn't beg for your life, you asked me, the real me, to come back. That was something Naomi never took into consideration." Cas went silent. The thunder had died down a little but the rain was still hammering down.
"I'm not five, Cas-" Another boom. Dean ducked his head as if he was expecting something to fly out at him. Cas put his hand on Dean's back steadily.
," Dean cried out again and squeezed Sam's hand. Sam held his brother close, trying to ease the pain. Cas remained frozen to the floor. His eyes were shut. He remembered Dean in hell, begging, to make it all stop. It was like he was re-reading it all from a script.
"Of course, I was. Shit, Cas, I thought- I thought something happened to you," Dean said frantically.
"Come here, and sit on my lap, angel," Dean said. Cas did just as he was ordered, swinging his legs around Dean.
Cas looked up, "look after Jack and don't get into trouble. I say that for both of you. If anything happens to Jack, that's on you," Dean nodded firmly. Dean fucked around a lot and enjoyed having fun but when it came to their son or anything serious, he straight up just shut his mouth and did his work. He might seem unbothered half the time, but he was a father and he had a responsibility to look after Jack.
"I can't believe I agreed to this," Dean complained putting on his 2nd layer of clothing. Sam laughed behind him as he and Jack started rummaging through Lucifer's old book collection. Cas approached him worried and uneasy,
"I like you too," it was a simple phrase but it took everything in Dean to get it out, "and for your information, I like men
"Yeah, Sammy, Cas. You're both here, great. So we figured out the spell," Dean said. Sam and Cas stood side by side, Sam with his hands crossed across his chest.
"He said he felt like he was missing someone important in his life. Even though his mind doesn't remember you, I think his heart does. I don't know how long we can keep this up, Dean's not an idiot," Sam sighed, running his hand through his floppy tangled hair.
Cas waited patiently for Inias to gather his thoughts, "I overheard David and a few others talking. They don't like Dean, you know."
"I've hurt you enough, Dean. Please, let me go. Let all of this go, it'll hurt less then," Cas said gently.
"This is so shit, dude," Dean whined. As the roar of the storm became louder and louder, the rain continued to thump down on them at a tremendous force. Dean winced at every crack of thunder.
"I know you better than anyone in this world. I've watched over you, your entire life, whether you were aware of that or not- perks of being your dumb guardian angel, I guess. We only met when the apocalypse was hanging over our heads, but Dean, I've known you since the day you were born." This threw Dean off completely, and he stepped back, frowning.
The sun usually rose high and mighty in LA but today, it was gloomy and quiet, much like how Sam felt.
"Sam said that he wanted to speak with you and Cas. He wants to join our camps if I'm not wrong, but we need to plan everything properly. We can coordinate an attack together," Jody was rambling on but Dean was too tired to pay attention. Claire noticed the way Dean's hands moved slower as he ate, nodding absentmindedly.
Cas sighed and continued, "I know we've been beating around the bush for quite some time now. But I know you feel what I feel. Still, I would never pressure you into anything, Dean. Tell me what you want me to be to you." Cas was so gentle and delicate, Dean didn't quite expect that. He finally looked up and stared back.
just kick your leader out? Castiel has given you a home, a place to feel needed and loved, he gave you a sanctuary, he taught you how to fight, how to hunt! Castiel has treated you like family! And you're all just going to abandon him? After everything he has given up for you?"
"Hey there, champ. You're going to owe me big time," Magnus said, with a small smile. Dean didn't bother replying. He watched as Magnus muttered something no one understood, and purple sparks flew out of his hands and directly into Dean. It was odd. When Castiel healed him, he always felt a rush of something cool coursing through his body. But Magnus's magic was warm. It was warm, and delicate, a little fiery as it stung.
"Anyways man what's going on with you and the detective? You guys together?" Dean asked sipping his coffee slowly, careful not to burn his mouth.
Lucifer called upon his brother Amenadiel to travel using his wings and retrieve the fruit from the tree of life, Cas and Jack split up to search for the Seal of Solomon while Sam and Dean went to find the Most Holy Man.
"Where's Dean?" Sam asked, panicking. At the same time, there was a loud growl and a huge thump. Sam and Cas looked back at the wendigo wide-eyed. Dean was laying on the floor, blood gushing out of his chest and he was not moving. Cas's breath hitched as he watched Dean's blood settle on the floor.
"You know damn well I will never leave Dean. Not again. If they're going to kick him out, I'll go with him. I can keep him safe, keep him warm and fed and make sure he doesn't die on the streets. But that means I'll need someone to run things here…"
"You did good. And I think we just need to talk and work this out. Thank you for telling me how you feel through the flowers. Thank you for trying, Dean. I know this is way out of your comfort zone, but I appreciate you going out of your way to think about the flowers and their meanings and getting them for me," Cas smiled and stepped closer to Dean.
"Where's Castiel?" Michael asked. Dean stared at him speechless. He just left Cas in Purgatory… again.
Their Fridays continued like that, one movie after another, Sam and Eileen being cute and sharing kisses and Cas always sitting a little too close to Dean. But Dean never complained. Not once.
Cas pulled Dean into him, wrapping their legs together, and pushing their bodies together. Everything felt natural and easy. Being with Dean felt easy. Dean snuggled closer to Cas, laying his head on Cas's chest. Dean felt a weird presence around him, he turned to see if he was Cas's left hand or something, but Cas's hand was on Dean's shoulder. Dean frowned, now very confused and a bit scared.
2 days passed by since they found out how to open the portal using the human soul. Neither Sam nor Dean brought up the topic of who was going to risk their life this time but instead, the group set out to collect the rest of the ingredients: the Seal of Solomon, the fruit from the tree of life, and the blood of the Most Holy Man (this was the most difficult to find because nobody knew where to even start looking... up until Chloe Decker stormed into the room with a gigantic book).
Dean snarled back, "You don't get to talk, Cas. Don't pretend like you suddenly care about me. Don't pretend like you even want me around. We're
"Yeah, I just got a text from Dan saying he's going after this serial killer. I gotta go Sam, but good luck!" She said.
Dean pulled Cas closer to him by his belt and deepened the kiss. His tongue explored Cas as if he didn't know the ins and outs of Castiel's mouth already. Dean yanked Cas's trenchcoat off and started undoing his tie. Cas didn't protest one bit when Dean started to unbutton Cas's white shirt skillfully. Cas broke off the kiss as he moaned and fell into the other man.
Dean arrived at Lux with Jack and found Cas with a glass of whiskey in his hand. Cas looked up with drooping eyes, "finally."
Dean was going through a mix of emotions, both anger and sadness, "you are NOT our weapon. You are NOT a tool. You're an angel. You're- you're my friend. Fuck, Cas, where the fuck did we go wrong? Cas, I need you. Now more than ever. I need you fighting by my side. The last time I left you in this god awful place, you got mind controlled by Naomi, I am NOT leaving you again."
She laughs. “I remember you from the time we where suppose to go to the bar but he ditched us” For you, is left unsaid, but Dean can hear it plain as day. He smiles tightly at her.
, he thinks and leans against the door. A part of him, however small, hates himself for the way his heart is beating in his chest and the rush of excitement he feels at the thought of Dean. That part tells him he is doing something illicit, something that betrays-
When he opens them again, he finds Castiel looking at him, half fond half sad, and full of longing and Dean can’t keep looking into his eyes so he focuses on a spot over his shoulder, and let out a shuddering a breath. He shifts in his arms and rests his forehead on Castiel’s shoulder.
Castiel runs his hand through his hair, messing it more and gets up from his chair and out of his office. He sees Hannah typing something on her computer and Inias re-watching the video tapes.
“You are doing everything you can” Castiel says and Dean looks at him and that was a mistake. He is so earnest when he says it, eyes clear with a smile that’s just in them, expression open, head tilt a bit on the side and Dean can’t take it and looks away. It’s too much, it might swallow him whole, his stomach flipping and his chest is constructing and there is something in his throat that he is trying to work around.
“I-” Sam starts and turns to look at him and scowls at him, “Really Dean? How many times do I have to tell you not to walk around in your boxers?”
“Yeah you don't seem the type” Dean says not unkindly, then after a few seconds, because insecurity is eating him “We don't- we don’t have to”. Then Novaks eyes are back at him, looking in that way that makes Dean’s skin erupt in goosebumps, “Auden’s is pretty good anyways” he utters, distracted.
“Wha- Cats. No they are- I’m allergic” he says and shifts on his feet. He needs to relax, everything is going to be fine. He is just standing on a hallway in Cas’ house, no big deal.
be doing. You grieved and now, after, you need to live. That doesn't make you bad, it makes you human.”
He mechanically reaches with his left arm for his alarm clock, but all he feels is the wood of the bedside table. He frowns and searches blind for a few more seconds, mostly because there is nothing on the table which is strange, because there is always at least a stuck of books there, along with various other objects.
“Hi” he whispers, staring at blue eyes and a strange, almost eerie calm overtakes him, along with excitement. It’s a weird feeling and he doesn't know if he likes it or not.
“Any nightmares?” Crowley asks twirling the pen between his fingers. Today he is wearing a dark blue shirt and Castiel finds it odd for some reason. Perhaps because Crowley is always wearing black and never once has he, in the last two years, wore a single colour.
They leave in a haze, taking Dean’s car as Castiel explains how he walked to the bookshop, since he lives only four blocks away, which is a good thing because Dean has enough self-restrain for that amount of time. Ha parks the car on an empty spot across the street and they walk to Castiel’s house hurriedly. Dean’s hands are shaking and he almost can’t believe they are doing this, that he can have this again.
“I don't know, Winchester. For the heck of it” Dean raises his eyebrows at her in question, both at the name and her words. “I like to remember peoples’ names around here” she responds grinning, eyes twinkling.
“You don't think you are beautiful?” he knows it’s not what Dean wants to hear, or the most important thing in what he has said, but Castiel finds himself wanting him to know at least that.
“I don't- What do you want me to say?” he asks Dean, maybe a little exasperated and yes Dean has that effect on people.
Dean becomes aware – or he makes himself believe, he is not entirely sure on that, which makes him be in a nonstop circle of
“No,” he growls darkly and has to hold himself from getting up and sprinting out of there, putting as much distance between them as possible. “If you do someth-”
“Nothing.” Dean, narrows his eyes at him, but doesn't say anything. Cas doesn't look like he wants to say anything else either.
Castiel groans, but his eyes shine happily and there is softens in his feature that make him even more attractive, even if his next words contrast it. “It can’t come fast enough, and at the same time the closer it gets it’s filled with more stress”
He wakes up a couple of hours later to his alarm and he groans, shutting his eyes tightly and lets out a groan. He is already done with this day and he doesn’t want to see anyone, nor go to work. After lying there for a few minutes, in the blissful quiet, his mind only occupied with the smallest of thoughts, he finally wills himself to get up and shuffles to the kitchen for a cup of coffee or three.
“Good morning, everyone” he tells them finally after a minute, opening the power point, “I hope you had a good week. I know you got your essays back yesterday, and I just wanted to say one thing, it doesn't apply to all of you, but is the general theme. You need to use citations and references in the correct way, I know it is annoying, but it is a shame to lose points just for that. There is a pdf for how to write those on the course home page, make use of it. If you have any other question concerning the essay, you can ask me at the end or better during office hours; I do apologize for last week, something happened and I had to leave.”
He shudders at the cold wind, and sighs, he finished his coffee some time ago so there is nothing to keep him warm. He calls Oli over who is playing with a Bernese mountain dog – and ok maybe Dean likes dogs now or at least is interested in them – and smiles at the dog’s owner politely as they leave. Thankfully she didn't try to make small talk with him, because Dean is not in a mood.
“Right. Just tell Balthazar to answer his emails for once and that I need the program structure for next semester. Also, there is an emergency and I will leave as soon as I am able to, alright?” he says and she nods at him. He then turns to Dean, “Is it about the lecture?”
Sam sighs, sifting and Dean turns to look at him, only for the younger man to huff in response, looking out the window again.
“There is the Christmas festival.” Adam suggests taking a huge bite from his pizza. Dean doesn’t know where he finds the appetite.
“It’s not like he left forever. It’s just for five days,” he tells him, although he isn’t sure it is entirely directed to Oli, “He is coming back on Wednesday.”
His room is bright, only a thin curtain covering the window. Dean looks at the made bed with the grey bedding, and swallows thickly, trying to decrease the headiness, and pounding of his heart, but then Castiel’s hands are on him again.
“Was full. Anyways everything was good. Don't need to worry your little head about it,” he continues with a shrug.
Dean goes to psychotherapy for the first time on a Friday in the middle of September, an hour after work; he feels like he barely has enough time to go home, shower, and get there. But he arrives with something less than fifteen minutes to spare and waits in baby listening to Metallica, until it gets to five minutes before the appointment. He goes up the third floor of the building, and knocks on the door that reads “B. T. Clinical psychologist – psychotherapist” and comes face to face with a smiling, too happy, redhead.
He returns to the apartment a little after eight, with three bags of groceries and in a far better mood than he left. He is mentally making a list of the things he needs to do tomorrow as he walks in.
“Yeah well” he doesn't know what to say and he hates it. It wasn't supposed to be like that between them, so he utters “What about the honeymoon?”
“I’ve told you about him. Castiel Novak,” Sam says emphasizing the name and shooting him a disapproving look.
“I should thank you” Dean tells him after a pause, where they both drink their coffee and seem to be finding the cups more interesting than anything else. “About Friday”
He futilely tries to rid his mind of all thoughts. He counts to twenty twice. Focus to the sounds that come from outside. Gets rid of all the images that remind him of him, pushes them at the back of his mind.
“I should probably go” Dean says tersely as he gets up and Castiel notices that the jacket he is wearing is a little big on him. He also notices how tense he is and that he is still not looking at him.
The photo isn’t recent. If it was, the guy wouldn't be smiling like that. No one with that smile walks around those streets.
For a moment Castiel thinks he has no idea about what he is doing with Dean, he just knows he wants to see him, possibly every day, which makes him feel a bit selfish, but he can’t bring himself to feel bad about that. Dean is something indescribable. He makes Castiel feel things he hasn't felt in a while and things he has never felt before. He wants Dean, he realises, in any way he can have him. That thought unnerves him and he doesn't know what to do with it, he feels panic and fear rising in his head, so he stops thinking about it.
He places his bag on the trunk and then goes to the drivers’ side slipping in his seat and starting the car, pulling out of the parking lot.
The elevator is crowded as per usual and Dean is suffocating by the time he reaches his floor. It’s quitter than the other floors, since it is just the literature staff offices and Dean doesn't know if he is too nervous and he can’t tell how he feels anymore or he is just calm all of a sudden. Has no idea where to go either, but he sees a man walking  across the hall and after a thought stops him to asks where to find Novak’s office. He is British and speaks in a plummy voice, that Dean hates and points him towards where he needs to go.
“I can though” Castiel exclaims and then with a normal tone of voice, looking slightly sheepish, “Have lunch with you that is. If you don't mind”
“You can practice. Just find a topic you enjoy and write about it. See how it goes” Novak continues.
“Cas” he rasps. Cas stops and raises his head to look at him, well that much Dean can tell. “Lights” he just says, cause he isn’t doing this in the dark.
The first time they had done this, Tom had asked him if he got hard and Dean had said no, its not how this works, and they left it at that. But after a few weeks of doing this, he asked Dean if he could just for that time and after some coaxing and few extra bucks he agreed, just for that time. He had done it for one more, but that's when it ended, because then it didn't matter, it was before-
They choose a table next to a window and sit down, silently sipping their coffees and eating the cookies.
Her eyes water again and she brings her hand to wipe them. Dean gently pushes the packet of tissues towards her to stop himself for getting up and leaving.
He takes his laptop out of his bag, which he takes care of almost like Baby. Bobby and Sam bought for him when he got accepted into university. When they gave it to him, he just stood there looking at the box trying to breath and fit into his head that yes they did this for him. After a long conversation, that half way through turned to a fight between Sam and Dean, and Sam trying to convince the other to do things for himself, Dean agreed to accept the laptop. Not that he could say no, one look at Bobby told him he was going to take it whether he liked it or not. Dean knows they did it because they wanted him to have something nice now that he is here and all, but it left him with a weird unsettling feeling. It took him a week to open the box.
But then his entire posture locks up again when the bell rings. Dean jumps a little himself at the unexpected sound, which hurts his ears in a weird way. It’s not even that loud.
Dean walks faster after he leaves the store. He wants to be alone, all of a sudden, because the other thing he wants, he isn’t going to get it.
“No” he says, his shoulders dropping. “Other than the note, which doesn't exactly fit. And the woman which we haven’t identified.”
The door opens and Novak comes in, muttering something under his breath while walking at the desk and getting his laptop out, removing his trench coat and Dean tries not to stare too much. Especially when he runs his hand through his hair, that are a bit wet form the rain, sighing. He watches though as the man glances at the students in the front every few seconds, before going back to his laptop and frowning the power point. When they don't stop, he looks at them concerned and walks near the first row, control in his hand.
“I hate her voice.” Dean sighs in fake annoyance, feeling a little better since dawn. “I’m going to drive us to Sara’s house, ok? Quit worrying.”
“Oh, please it’s about damn time. You have been more than ready and Dean is well, we both know what he is to you. Even if you insist on not wording it”
He hears footsteps in the hallway and his heart jumps in his chest. He wills himself to stay calm. It’s just Dean. The thought though doesn't help at all and he really should have found a shirt to wear.
And they are kissing again, cocks rubbing together and Dean explores with his hands and mouth and god Cas feels so good on top of him. He feels warm and wanted and like he is worth- He pulls away just barely, “Lube”, he says, cause he needs to go back to his feet, to what he can handle. “Drawer” is Cas response, before starting kissing Deans’ neck again, as if Dean knows which drawer.
“Now, the thing that interests all of you and the question I am always being asked is work load. For every piece of literature that we do, you will have to answer typically one or two questions, in a form of essay, small essay with a word limit of a six hundred words each, and at the end of each work you will have to write one essay that has a word limit of two thousand words, you can find all these in the course notes.”
He moves in the front and comes face to face with a blonde guy and blue eyes, who gives him a lazy smile. His tag writes Benny.
“I know you don't want help, but it’s for emergencies. Or anything you might need” he continues looking a bit sheepish.
“How are we?” Dean asks sarcastically, an edge on his voice and he has to grip the coach to keep control of his hands.
"Cas," he croaks, and he doesn't care that his voice breaks or that he is almost crying or that this is the first time he said his name since-
Dean scowls at him and rolls his eyes, when he looks back at Novak, annoyed at all this – something at the back of his mind tells him he is being unreasonable but he ignores it – and tells him, challenging and with half a mind thinking that he is crossing a line “Really? And how would you know? Maybe that's all there is” he gestures towards the laptop, still in front of Novak, who presses his lips together displeasure in his face, but his eyes are sharp and determined when Dean looks into them.
Dean swallows and takes a step backwards and then another and another. He stares at Cas for a moment longer before turning around and heading towards the door. He stops by the entrance to put on his shoes and jacket and then he gets out, closing the door with a soft sound.
“You are.” Dean huffs, plopping himself down. “And you are going to believe me one day, even if I have to tell you for the rest of forever.” Dean grumbles, scrunches his nose and turns so he is not touching Cas at all.
He takes a step back and then another and Dean can’t help but follow him. It is warm inside and bright, the lights are on and Dean finds himself in a long corridor that leads to a stairway. There are doors, in both sides, but light comes only from the last room on the left. There are frames in the walls, and next to him there is a painting; Seaport with something, he can’t remember the full title. He stares at it, it’s the first one he-   He licks his lips and releases a small sigh, he always liked that one for a reason he can’t explain, even though sea paintings aren’t his favorite.
Instead he smiles, and gets inside the car without another word. He is the only one in her car and he is thankful for that. Once they reach the station, they go over the whole process quite fast and then he is inside a cell.
Dean can’t see their faces, but he guesses they can’t be too different to the ones he can see. Everyone is looking at Novak dumbfound.
“I saw him you know” she starts, after a second or ten minutes he doesn’t know, repeatedly taping her hand softly against the table, a movement she neither seems to be able to stop or be aware of doing. “He was in the-” she gestures where Sam and Michael have disappeared to through the door. “In the living room.”
On Friday Dean walks into the literature hall, with five minutes to spare, he sits in his usual seat on the third row and gets his things out. They finished Steppenwolf and they are starting the Stranger by Camus this week. He is kind of dreading it. He was able to find a second hand copy of the book and read a bit yesterday. He isn’t sure he likes Camus way of writing.
“She works at the senior high school, she is a, ugh, English teacher.” He says and looks up at Dean’s phone where the map is open. “You were supposed to take a left here.”
He looks at the coffee shop in the corner, and before he has a second thought, he throws his half-finished coffee on the bin and walks inside. It is Thursday, the day after he has that regular guy that pays pretty well, so he can indulge a little, even though Sams’ books seem to get more expensive as time passes.
“And I didn’t tell him.” Her voice breaks and she leans her head on his shoulder. She makes no movement to wipe her tears. “Dean” the way she says his name, lost, sad and small, he is reminded of how young she is.
Those words have been ringing in his head since Monday. He feels weird thinking about them and the whole thing with Dean. It’s like he is trying to put into words something that has no shape or form, or maybe it does and Castiel isn’t aware of it or can’t see it. Plus, it’s not like the feelings he gets when he thinks about Dean make any sense. Or maybe he just doesn't want to know what they mean. He is confused and scared about them and sometimes he feels like he is flying but can’t land. And then there is the whole change thing happening inside him, that he can’t even begin to describe.
On his way out of the Winchester manor, he grabbed a cup of coffee and a banana. He left as quick as he could, knowing that if Adam saw him leaving so late, he would tear him a new one. Smiling at the hilarious image of Adams face getting all red, he got into the car. As he drove toward the New York mercy hospital (NYMH), an unsettling feeling washed over him. It wasn’t a bad feeling, just strange and unfamiliar. He felt like something was about to change, something big, and the universe was holding its breath in anticipation. He almost laughed at that, it seemed very silly and as the feeling slowly dissipated, he felt his mind drift onto bigger things.
“Cas! You’re here early. Just can’t stay away from this place huh.” she said, flashing him that familiar smile of hers.
A dark-haired boy on a table across from him was laughing hard and failing miserably to cover it. Dean set down his coffee, hard, obviously spilling some onto himself in the process and that just caused the dark-haired boy to lose it even further.
All his fears were put to rest after a class with Professor Mills. She didn’t treat her students like she was meeting them for the first time, she treated them as though she knew them for a lifetime. She took care of each person in class no matter how capable or not they were. Film took a whole new meaning for dean with her as his teacher.
“Non, Juste parce que tu n'as pas de butin ne veut pas dire que je ne le fais pas non plus” came the snarky reply
Something caught his eye and he whipped out his phone to take a quick photo of a shaggy cat stretched out lazily across a car.
The second Cas looked into Deans eyes, his verdant and comforting eyes, a warm feeling washed over him. His hands started to tingle and his knees felt weak. A foreign feeling washed over him as dean still held his gaze and Cas clenched his jaw, trying to get a hold of himself.
Castiel woke up at 7:30 am that morning. An hour and half later than his usual time. Eileen had reassigned all his surgeries and demanded he sleep in, she needed him at full focus for today. It was a big day for the hospital and for him. They were signing the Neuraforte deal today, and Cas was ecstatic.
Finally, after what seemed like a decade, classes were finished for the day. So funny, how the day was a blur but also seemed to drag on forever.
He reached the university and strolled inside, acting all casual when he was literally one step away from throwing up from excitement.
“Where have you been all my life? it’s the most underrated show I’ve ever come across, it deserves everything.” Replied Dean, equalling the excitement.
9:37 am, his phone was blowing up with texts, ding-ding-ding, one after the other. He really should put his ringer off. Dean groaned into his pillow, he knew he was late, but hell, he’d just gotten back from climbing Denali a few days ago. The seven and half hour flight back was what really exhausted him, not the climbing. Climbing was like second nature for him, he was born for it. Shrugging the sleep off, he grabbed his phone from the nightstand.
Sammy was 17 and boy he was smart as fuck. He wanted to be a lawyer and the day he told Dean about it, Dean felt so proud his heart could burst. Sam was no longer the scared little boy who held on tightly to Dean’s hand as they left their childhood home for good. Thank fuck for the presence of mind of 12-year-old Dean Winchester to take Sam and leave. The second he’d heard that bottle crash and John yell at Sammy, Dean didn’t even think twice. He grabbed the already packed bags and headed out to Bobby’s place, with Sam in tow. now 9 years later, John was rotting behind bars because of the countless offences he had committed, and they were with their real ‘dad’, Bobby Singer.
Stopping right outside the door, he took out a scrap of paper with castiels number on it that he had handed him. while saving the name-
“He/they. This is ideally what our first interaction should’ve been, you know.” Castiel said with a laugh.
The second he laid eyes on the dark haired man, Dean froze. His breath hitched in his throat and everything seemed to move very slowly. His eyes grew wide. He was breathtaking. In a split second however, Dean regained his composure. But he noticed how a lock of hair fell down the man’s forehead, and the way his white coat fitted over his biceps. He also noticed how it made his stomach feel a very weird type of way. As the man walked forward, Deans eyes never left him. Who was he?
Castiel beamed, and Dean couldn’t help but smile too. there was just something about that boy. The way the blue in his eyes seemed to dance when he looked at dean, the way he looked when Dean made him laugh, the way his lips-
He remembered the first patient to have ever died on his table. Anna Milton. She’d come in when Cas was just a surgical intern at NYMH, complaining of a headache that wouldnt go away. Suspecting a benign tumour, he took her in for a scan that sure enough, revealed a tumour deep in her right cerebrum. His attending neurosurgeon, Michael Jones, asked him to scrub in on the surgery. It went smoother than expected; the main complications arose when Anna was in post op, when her health rapidly deteriorated. They’d taken all the precautions required for a neurosurgery post op, but they lost her. Her death was very hard on Cas. Not being able to focus, he took a monthlong break from surgery, and in that time he cleared his head. He came back with his goal clearly etched out. He was going to be the best damn neurosurgeon America had ever seen.
“Every person who checks out another person says that.” Came the reply. Castiel looked so proud of himself for doing that.
Stay calm you can freak out later stay calm you can freak out later stay calm you can freak out later went deans internal monologue
John died a few years ago in a car crash, and the multimillion dollar company fell into Deans hands. Dean was never interested in a boring life spent at board meetings and bossing other people around. He loved adventure and found climbing mountains his calling. However, Sammy was a lawyer at Hanscum-Mills, one of the most renowned firms in East America, and Adam was too young to handle the whole company on his own, so Dean signed on as CEO, sharing the workload with Adam, but Adam was more suited for the job. He always had a charm that made people like him instantly, and was the public face of the company, handling press conferences and well, mostly everything while Dean took a backseat and only interfered in major issues and was always there when Adam or anyone else needed his help. He was proud of Adam and Sammy. Proud of what fine young med they’d grown up to be. If Kate and Mary were around to see them, they would be just as proud as Dean. Sammy was rising through the ranks at the company and was set to be the youngest managing partner the firm had ever seen, and Adam was a boss at handling all the complexities the family business demanded. This more or less left Dean to do the one thing he really wanted to, climb.
"Do I know you? You look very familiar," Dean said, examining the man up and down a frown forming on his lips. The man was maybe an inch or two shorter than him but he was attractive. The man had a small stubble, kind eyes, and wore a coat over his suit and piercing blue tie that was the wrong way around.
Dean felt like his heart got crushed into a million pieces. He was so broken, confused and lost. What if Cas wasn't getting his prayer? What if Cas didn't want to hear his voice and turned it off? What if Cas is already dead? Dean's head was spinning and he was afraid. He had to convince Michael to open another rift. He had to get Cas back. No matter the cost.
