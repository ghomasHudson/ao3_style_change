“Jesus Christ, Cas, scare me half to death why don’t you? And what would you even know about hunting, you’re still a rookie.” He doesn’t know what he’s expecting Cas to do, but the once-angel just tilts his head, considering Dean’s words carefully before reacting. He’s unnaturally calm and still, as if he doesn’t feel the energy rolling off Dean in earthquake-like tremors.
They end up on the couch - it’s an old thing from Sammy’s childhood and it certainly wasn’t meant to hold two grown men at once, but they make do - Dean’s back to Cas’s chest. Cas has one hand in Dean’s hair, fingers gentle, scratching a bit behind the shell of his ear. His other arm is across Dean’s chest, keeping him held close. Dean cycles through waves of calmness, guilt, and self-hatred for breaking down in the first place; for even needing to be held like this – like a frightened child.
Cas catches his arm, twisting them around and walking him backwards into the siding of his own house. Dean’s back hits the uneven logs. His mind races, looking for a way to get away or go down fighting.
“Raccoons?”
“Well, you can start by taking your stuff up to the guest room. Unwind, I’ll take care of the little one for a while,” She sends Cas off, whisking Jack away to the kitchen.
Cas keeps fucking him even as he slumps against his chest like a ragdoll. Dean feels like he’s put his tongue to the tip of a nine-volt battery -- electric current running through his veins and cranking his senses up to eleven. Before too long, Cas’s hips stutter and he pulls out, finishing across both their chests. Dean groans, halfheartedly wiping them both off with his discarded shirt before finagling the sheets and blankets over their legs.
Cas lets go of Dean’s hands in favor of rubbing big circles onto his back instead. He’s quiet for a moment, then “May I help you sleep? Just for tonight?”

He stands and shoves at the nearest object – a lamp on the side table. It shatters to the ground but it isn’t
Cas nods, heading upstairs to pack a bag of his own.
Dean doesn’t know how to be a dad, but Ben doesn’t seem to mind. He’s content to listen to Dean’s stories about his job at the firearms company and go hunting with him on the weekends. It’s an easy routine, and one Dean quite enjoys.
start-”
“Of course, baby,” Tears start welling in his eyes, and he holds tighter to the child in his arms, “Kelly was radiant, one of the most beautiful, kindhearted people I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. Sometimes I think she was an angel, sent to give you to me – she’s up where she belongs now, free of pain and sorrow. Jack, when you see her,” Cas is sobbing now. He can feel Jack’s heartbeat weakening under his fingertips, “when you see her, tell her I miss her and that I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you. God, Jack, I love you so much, I’m so sorry.”
“Sheriff Winchester-”
Dean checks Jack’s room first, expecting to find him napping in bed. No luck; the room is empty save for his suitcase and a recently received letter from a school friend. The bed is unmade and his pajamas lay rumpled on the floor. He leaves the room as he’s found it.
“Did father –” she begins.
Kevin doesn’t survive the point-blank blast.
Really, Dean can’t be blamed for throwing the first punch. Fight or flight, and the answer will always be fight. In hindsight, maybe his flight response is rusted out and busted from disuse. It’s always fight; it’ll always be fight and one day it’ll be his last. Not today though. Today, he feels James’ jaw crack against his knuckles. Today, he smells the copper-sharp scent of blood as James reflexively bites into his own tongue. Today, he sees the sly smile and lit-up eyes of someone who has him figured out.
Cas clears his throat, “I’ve been living with Dean, and he’s wonderful – truly wonderful—we read and cook together, and his insight is marvelous; he’s taught me so much. However, he’s been strange since Jack arrived. Today, he hit him for playing with his mourning dolls – a misunderstanding, but it rattled me. Anna, you’re the only family I have left – tell me what I should do.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, there he is: the man too good for the rest of us. You’re not slick, sneaking about every night. Got something to hide, Dean-o?”
He shoves Cas again, harder this time, managing to break from his hold and rush inside – locking the door behind him. He needs to sleep. He needs to sleep. He needs to sleep.
“You’ve lost many, I can tell. Everyone has, but you… you rival the queen herself, and she’s still withdrawn in Windsor Castle. There’s a storm of death about you, Dean Winchester, and you’re standing in the eye of it.” He smiles, reaching for Dean’s gloved hands, “We live in the parsonage, if you wish to see me after services."
The veil settles against his skin, almost like Mary placing her hands on his shoulders. No, this would be honoring her.
Dean sighs, heading downstairs to the parlor, hoping Jack hasn’t run off – the sooner he can get back to reading with Cas, the better. Reading together is the only alone time they get nowadays, but of course the kid has to go and ruin every good thing Dean has going with Cas.
“Would you let me finish?” Cas stares through him again before flicking his gaze down to Dean’s mouth for the briefest of seconds, “As I was saying,
Dean shuts his eyes tight, clenches his fists tighter, chokes back the hope that dares to attempt to rise in his chest.
“You feel guilty – for many things. Your protective instincts are admirable, like a mother bear tending to her cubs.” Cas’s voice is soft, but it cuts through some of the chaos in his head. “You cannot cope by drinking yourself into a stupor and lashing out at me. It won’t change the fact that you cannot save everyone.”
“Dean…” Cas grabs Dean’s hands, running his fingers along the ugly mess of scar tissue, “your father put his obsession with revenge over the safety of his sons. You are a righteous man, Dean Winchester. You are guided by love, not obsession.”
“I’m heading to the cemetery to speak to my dear late husband.”
Cute. He’s never seen Cas blush before. He makes it a goal to make it happen again – as many times as Cas will allow.
“The hell do you know about my habits, James?” Cold sweat, hot sweat, cold sweat, hot sweat, an anxiety tremor that felt like earthquakes wracking his body, “’You this much of a scoundrel when it comes to everybody, or just me?”
“Actually,” Sam winces, “you’re going to be staying here.” At Dean’s shocked expression, he continues, “You’re my brother and I love you, but the last few years have been endless mourning to the point of obsession. When was the last time you took that veil off, Dean? Or the gloves? Why do you have a morbid little museum in our parlor?” He takes a breath, trying to calm down, “I just can’t take it anymore. You’re like a ghost in this home.”
Cas is, unsurprisingly, still on Dean’s porch in the morning. Dean supposes the porch swing is big enough to sleep on, comfort notwithstanding.
Dean startles. He stares back at Castiel, trying to discern the thought process going on behind those blue eyes.
“I’m going to go check on the kid,” he says, standing up. Cas glances up at him and smiles softly before returning back to the novel.
“You carry yourself with the weight of a man who knows loss deeply. Was she your wife?” This time, Castiel motions toward a thin gold chain, just barely peeking out over Dean’s shirt collar. It’s a locket, of course, one he’d gotten made to commemorate Mary. He keeps it safe against his collarbones, hidden under his layers of clothing.
He unbuttons the mourning dress and slips it on. His fingers – once so eager to touch the fabric – quake trying to fasten the buttons again.
“Ah, yes. Raccoons – pesky little thieves. Thank you.”
Cas catches him by the upper arm.
Dean nods, “Go ahead, Jack. The chocolate ones are all for you.”
Cas’s hand gentles into an almost-caress before dropping back to his side.
-.-.-
He needs desperately to be taken out of his head, needs a reprieve from the way his brain refuses to let him experience any scrap of happiness.
‘How long has he been back? How long have you been back?’ Dean interrupted.
Dean shrugged. Sure, he’d saved his life, and last time they’ve seen him he was dying to give them a change to protect the world, this time for real, but he’d still killed him on uncountable occasions.
Sam laughed, despite himself, and then realised they hadn’t hadn’t had the time to wash the writing off the walls in the room he’d previously occupied. Keeping this in mind, he’d lead him towards the room that’d been Jack’s.
‘What do you need?’
‘And you...’ He thought about it again, and turned to Castiel for support, who seemed to be on the fence, settling for a half hearted retort instead. ‘Have you noticed your hair fluffs up when you take control like that?’
‘As dead as we get, yes. Michael’s blade through the heart, out of body moment, the acclaimed Empty, the whole shebang.’ He yawned, for theatricality more than anything. ‘Does that lift a weight off your shoulders? Because now I couldn’t have helped even if I’d wanted?’ He halfheartedly kicked Dean’s seat.
‘Right. We’ll do it when we get back.’
‘What kind of brother would I be if i let Castiel’s main squeeze die on this dump?’ He glanced around, scrunching his nose.
‘Not on purpose, he’s a loud thinker. And you’re usually not.’
‘Hey, we’ll find him if he causes any trouble.’ He changed his tone to begrudgingly add. ‘Or if he is in trouble.’ He reached for Cas’ hand, sharing a look with him.
kind of short and weird //like me//. my job and classes are kicking my arse lol.
‘That’s a joke, kind of. Whoever was sick most recently gets the first turn, but angels don’t get sick, so that’s you anyway.’
‘And we could go out. Like couples do.’
‘I’m fantastic, or I’ll be soon enough.’ He rolled to face away from them, putting an end to the conversation.
‘Okay, my turn, when were you sick for the last time?’
have you been?’
A moment passed. Dean leaned in, cupping the angel’s face with his hand. It wasn’t uncomfortable, the atmosphere felt expectant, if anything. Castiel leaned into the touch, enjoying the hunter’s warmth and his relaxed expression, covering his hand with his own. It felt like some sort of convergence. Yes, they both wanted things they could not name, but they would find a way around it.
‘Oh, you know I’m an open book.’ He winked. Then, more seriously, added. ‘Does that mean I get to ask questions?’
‘Oh, if your brother’s vibes were any indication before he left, he’d disagree.’ He wiggled his eyebrows.
Sam was rather taken aback, he was not expecting Gabriel to want to ask anything, but he guessed it made sense to make it an exchange. He agreed and, for a moment, they just stared at the board between them.
‘We killed everyone, Sam.’ He chuckled, and then realised Sam had gotten up. ‘Right, we should get to unboxing more ancient artifacts.’
‘But you’re okay now, right?’ Sam cut in.
Sam examined the cards, realising they were cities from all over the world, while Gabriel set out the groups of colourful cubes. He tried talking himself out of it, but in the end he spoke:
‘I’m not spying on you, Samuel. I can’t blame you for not trusting me, though.’
‘I think I like it.’ He turned to look at him, his back facing the window.
Sam left the room, looking exasperated, which gave Cas a chance to follow Dean back to his room without having to answer questions, as soon as he finished his drink. He left himself be guided into bed and felt something in his chest flutter when he laid next to Dean. He waited until he was sure the hunter was sound asleep and only then allowed himself to thread his fingers through his short blond hair, half entranced by the contact. Yes, he could have. He just wasn’t sure as to which extent.
Possessed by some otherworldly force, he locks the door.
“I’m not the man you want me to be, Cas. Nobody’s gonna be happy getting locked up by the town orphan-turned-floozy. I’ve got too many wires crossed up here and the Winchester name isn’t honorable or intimidating or worth anything anymore. It’s a damn curse is what it is,” and now he’s on a roll, now he can’t stop the words pouring out of his mouth, “Do you know what it’s like to be a mother at age four? Do you know what it’s like to sacrifice everything and have it not be enough? To have your father call you by your dead mother’s name – a woman I barely remember but one I’ve had to become so I could keep the waters calm and keep Sammy from drowning with me? Do you understand how that completely fucks up my head? You don’t, so no, you can’t save me. We’re done here.”
“I love you. Please remember that,” Dean whispers.
And so Dean lets go, stares down the barrel of fight and flight and chooses neither. He chooses instead to trust-fall backwards.
“Are you
“Oh, you’re one to talk about family, Castiel.”
It’s hot, slick, sticky. The air between them is heavy and electric. Dean’s legs tremor with exertion before giving out entirely, leaving him frantically rolling his hips, shaking from just how fucked-out he feels. He doesn’t want to finish first; it was an unspoken rule at the saloon to always care for the customer first, always make sure the other person was completely satisfied before you thought about your own pleasure. Dean tries to hold out, but Cas’s hands are something magical and they have him coming to the sound of his own hitched moans.
“I want you. You’re wanted. You’re loved. I’m sorry you’ve been abandoned and neglected, but that cycle ends now. I saved you. I dragged you out of your personal hell – saw you through not only that night but the nights of withdrawal and agony. I
“Castiel!” She exclaims as she opens the door, “And my favorite little nephew. May I hold him?”
“I’m not; the company is permanently moving. The war in America is imminent, and our profits would be greater if we didn’t have to ship in steel from across the sea just to turn around and send our guns across the same sea.”
When Sam finds him, hours later, he’s still in Mary’s room, going through her belongings, veil still secured on his head.
Jack doesn’t respond.
“No shit I’m
“D-Dad said they were special dolls and I wanted to play with them! I want to play with you!” Jack wails, holding Emma’s doll even tighter. His little fingers tremble.
The house is eerily quiet for a Sunday afternoon. Suspiciously quiet, given the seven-year-old in their presence. Cas and Dean are in the study, reading though the latest Dostoyevsky novel, drinking coffee that has since gone ice cold in the early October chill. Cas is wrapped in a soft shawl that a widow down the street had given them in exchange for a wildberry pie made by Dean. Cas had, of course, helped to pick the berries. It had taken them quite some time to pick enough for a pie, given Cas’s tendency to eat most of what he picked right off the vines. Dean had made a note at the time to bring home a vine or two for Cas to transplant into their garden.
Castiel learns to mourn from the Widow of Regent Street himself.
“My dearest, you’re ill, let’s get you to bed.”
Jack whines at the movement, shivering. He’s so small and delicate in Cas’s arms, like an injured bird. He turns to Cas, barely opening his eyes. It reminds Cas of when Jack was a baby and hated naps. He’d always try to fight naptime until his eyes were too heavy to stay open.
She did her time – one year and a day, then another six months, then six months after that. A whole two years, and Dean still overhears their neighbors calling Mary a harlot when she takes him and Sammy out for a walk in a pale lavender dress. By that point, both boys had outgrown their mourning clothes, as expected. Sometimes Sam still carries around his black blanket, but he’d grown to like patterns and colors like the other boys in the neighborhood.
me to clean up your mess and be in charge. You can’t ask me to jump and expect me to ask how high. I already got two jobs, I don’t need a third. ‘Sides, you said it yourself – I’m a whore; a pin won’t make me righteous again.” He can feel himself getting close to snapping, close to lashing out at the man of the law in front of him. Anger, frustration, and shame are burning too hot to touch. Fight or flight, and the answer will always be fight. He shoves at Cas.
“My condolences,” Castiel offers, “Who else?”
“Nevermind, just sort what we’re keeping and what we’re selling. I’ll leave you to it.” The door slams behind Sam and the house falls as silent as a professional mourner.
Arms wind around him, and he finally shatters into big, ugly tears and heaving breaths. God, what a baby. What an absolute sniveling, whiny child. It doesn’t matter anyway because Cas is going to be leaving soon, walking out the door without looking back. Dean can allow himself this one weakness before he has to build his walls back up. Cas ain’t the type to spread rumors, so maybe he’ll even escape with a shred of his dignity intact.
Cas hums, bringing a spoonful of broth to Jack’s mouth. He manages a few spoonfuls before he turns away, burrowing his face into Cas’s chest above his heartbeat.
Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s arm, shaking him a bit to break the depressive spiral.
And in the back of Mary’s closet, he finally allows himself to weep.
still provide for your brother. I won’t let you fall, but you have to trust me.”
Together, he and Jack creep up the steps. Cas stops by Jack’s bedroom to tuck him in and give him a kiss goodnight before continuing on to his own room.
The shopkeeper places two bottles of white powder on the counter, “Rat problem, sir?”
“Hey momma,” he tells the mirror, “I miss you. I miss you so much. I feel like I can’t breathe without you here, momma.” He reaches into the pockets of the dress and pulls out a handkerchief – white with a black lace border and an embroidered MW in one corner – to dab at his eyes with.
-.-.-
“A friend? Castiel, you can’t fool me. Catarina and I have been lovers for years; she’s the very reason father disowned
“I want you.” Cas tells him.
The bunker is quiet; everyone coping in their own miserable little ways.
“I said no.” Dean shoulders past him, making a beeline for the shed he uses as a makeshift  forge.
-.-.-
Anna kisses his forehead.
Breakfast can wait, dean decides, luxuriating in the feeling of holding and being held. There are hot wet kisses against his throat, under his jaw, across to the corner of his mouth. Dean considers shifting to his back – thinks about letting Cas cover him in kisses and gentle touches.
“Breakfast?” Jack’s tiny feet slap against the stairs as he bounds down into the kitchen, “Dee, it smells amazing!” He runs up and joins their hug before standing in front of the muffins on the cooling tray, looking up at Dean as if to ask permission.
“Ain’t mine and ain’t nothing gentle about ‘em. Get off my damn porch, Cas.” Hot red shame rises up Dean’s chest like a violent wave of bile. It’s meant to be unspoken – the fact that Cas
“Aint been round here in months and now you think you can just be our sheriff? John must’a smacked you boys ‘round harder than I thought.”
“Good. I’m glad. If you accept my appointment, you’ll have more time to do so. You’ll be able to improve like you want to
When Dean is 19, Mary dies and is laid to rest beside John. Old age and natural causes, the doctor cites in the autopsy. He and Sam are left with the Campbell Firearms business and fortune – and given the talks of war in America, it’s a pretty sizeable fortune. Dean lets Sam take over the business, while he stays at home and mourns Mary.
Cas gasps again at that, “We’re leaving,” he sets Jack down and kneels beside him, “darling, go pack up, we’re going to go stay with Aunt Anna for a little while, ok?” With a kiss to his forehead, Jack runs upstairs to start packing.
The sound of the door creaking is the only warning Dean has before he’s being pummeled by Jack’s bony little knees and elbows as the kid crawls over him to reach Cas.
Dean jolts, black-gloved hands batting Sam away, “It feels right. I need to wear it. A year and a day, Sammy. Then six months, and another six after that.”
“Give it back!” Dean demands.
Cas never pushes or pulls like the faceless men at the saloon do. He pets, holds, and waits patiently for Dean to compose himself. Dean calms under Cas’s hands, pressing one more kiss to his upper thigh before giving into his base desires and swallowing Cas down.
A fever breaks out among the children, and Dean misses work to help Charlie care for the sick. There’s bedding to be washed and clothing to be washed and rags to be washed and sick pails to be emptied. Dean barely sees Charlie all day, for all the running around they’re both doing alongside the other caregivers. When he does see her, she’s alone in her own room, liquor bottle half-empty on her bedside table.
By the time Cas has carried him back into the house and up to his bedroom, Jack has slipped into a fitful, uneasy sleep. He whimpers when Cas sets him down and tucks him into bed. As soon as he quiets again, Cas kisses his forehead and rushes to the kitchen to find Dean.
Anna smiles, handing Jack a bowl and a wooden spoon, “Of course, treasure. I could use some help mixing.”
The movement catches Cas’s attention, and he moves one hand from Dean’s hip to his cock, stroking in long, elegant sweeps and thumbing at the leaking slit. Dean throws his head back and damn near bites through his tongue.
Charlie wails at that, reaching out to him in despair. He holds her.
“Dee!” Jack calls when Dean hits the last step, “Come play with me!” He’s seated on the floor, still wearing his church clothes. In his hands and all around him lay an array of dolls, which upon a closer look have all been taken from – oh.
Castiel shakes his head, “No, no. Oh, sister, I have so much to tell you. I’ve been disowned; I’m living with a… friend –”
With Cas, it’s so difficult to put into words. Dean’s tongue feels like cotton and his head is no better off. The situation is fragile and breakable in his calloused hands. Regardless of how gentle he is, the shattering is inevitable.
“I want to see you ride me,” It’s the filthiest thing Dean has ever heard out of son-of-a-preacher, Phoenix-deputy, you’ll-call-me-my-full-name Castiel’s mouth and it only sends him slipping further and further into the haze of lust. A long, breathy string of
Dean stares for a minute, awestruck, before cold realization pierces through. His hands shake when he tries to unfasten the bronze star. Nausea rolls, and he finds himself a little furious.
“We’ll take care of you, Mary dearest. The company is doing well; we’ll send you a weekly allowance to raise the kids on.” Grandfather always draws mom into a tight, reassuring embrace. The cousins always promise to write, but no letters ever get delivered.
“Will you. Will you. Show me how much you want me?” God, he sounds pathetic. This was a horrible idea. He tries to push Cas’s arm off of him; tries to slip the hold to no avail. He begins to scratch, clawing desperately as panic hits him square in the chest. Fight or flight and the answer is flight for the second time today – and Dean’s sure there’s some higher power somewhere marking today as some cosmic occurrence. If he’s lucky, he’ll be able to blame it on the full moon.
He sobs, caught helplessly between the violent past and the shameful present. There’s no way Cas could possibly understand the feeling of old scars being ripped open again – of self-hatred so strong it claws through his lungs until he can’t breathe properly. He’s hyperventilating, suddenly lightheaded.
“I told you to trust me. I told you I wouldn’t let you fall; I’ll catch you.”
“No, Dean, I’m leaving for America,” Sam sighs, preparing himself for the long and arduous conversation they’re about to have.
“Two bottles of cyanide.” Dean orders from the shopkeeper on the other side of the counter. The guilt he felt on the way to the general store is suddenly gone, replaced with a calm nothingness.
. Cas wants him and wants to settle down. The thought makes Dean’s stomach twist into knots of equal parts doubt and glee. He tries to focus back on the moment. The moment is something he can work with -- sex is a game he’s good at and has the positive reviews -- and tips -- to prove it. He catches Cas staring and rolls his hips in a filthy invitation.
is bubbling from his lips before his mind has fully wrapped around Cas’s words - his fingers have already joined Cas’s, twisting and crooking and stretching in ways that make Dean feel a bit floaty. He’s drowning, he’s drowning, he’s drowning and he doesn’t want to come up for air.
was off.
“Muffins, dearest. After my behavior earlier, I figured I should apologize to you and Jack. Chocolate almond for him and cranberry apple for us,” he makes a point to imply his apology; never saying the words aloud.
His eyes sweep lower, from his chest down to his arms to the vee of his hips to –
While Cas changes into pajamas, Dean rolls over to his own side, making room for Cas on the other side of the bed. Cas slides into the warm spot and pulls Dean close to him, “We need to talk in the morning.”
“Excuse me?”
Dean steps in to run the orphanage in Charlie’s stead. There are other caregivers that volunteer, but Dean makes sure to be there every night for bedtime, so he can read Charlie’s stories to the kids before bedtime every night from behind his veil.
Not going to lie, I cried writing this.
Wanted. Cas
Dean is quiet for a moment, then, “Alright, I’ll start packing then.” He picks up the book and sets it on the counter, turning to head upstairs.
“Hm. Something like that,” he hums.
Anger flickers, flickers again, then sputters out – he’s too tired to fight. The shame has morphed from a red flush against his cheekbones to a burn behind his eyes. Fuck. He needs to sleep.
On nights like tonight, the buzzing is the loudest – he ditches the glass and goes straight for the bottle. Tonight they’d been too late and Dean had held twin siblings as they bled out in his arms screaming for their parents. Tonight Dean had listened as they took their final breaths, as one of the twins reached up weakly and called him
Cas dabs his eyes, suddenly overwhelmed by the idea of having to decide for himself. Stay? Leave? The implications of both spin around his head until he feels dizzy and desperate, “I don’t know what to do,” he admits.
There’s a peace about mornings – a sticky slow molasses-like quality that makes everything all the sweeter. Dean isn’t a morning person, but he is a practical man who likes breakfast before a certain time. He can, however, be talked into lazy mornings every so often. Cas nestles into his arms like he belongs there, tucked right under Dean’s chin. His hair is a mess – it tickles at Dean’s nose until he frees a hand to finger-comb it down. Cas makes a displeased little huff, and Dean drops his hand back to where it was – slung improperly low across Cas’s hips, fingertips tracing little designs across the swell of his backside.
Dean draws a sharp, annoyed breath. He doesn’t have time for this; doesn’t have the patience to argue before a shift. It’s already put him in a bad mood, which is bad news for tonight’s tips. He’s barely making enough as is, with monsoon season hitting as hard as it has been. He’ll probably have to sell forge equipment to cover this month’s tuition payment-
And with that, she marches the kids down past the cemetery to the general store. She presses a two-pound coin and a grocery list into Dean’s palm.
“You’re distressed” The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere all at once. It’s barely a whisper but it clashes like an untuned saloon piano in his head, echoing off his skull over and over and over. It’s startling, sudden - overwhelming. Heat wells up behind Dean’s eyes. He’s going to cry. He’s going to cry. He doesn’t know why he doesn’t want Castiel to see him so weak - the man has seen him at his absolute worst; out of his mind with grief and whiskey, begging for…
Settling – now there’s a concept Dean’s past giving up on. He’d once had dreams of quitting the saloon; shifting his focus solely to blacksmithing. He’d even tried it once – in another life, it feels like – and the results had been abysmal. He’d sulked back to the saloon with his tail between his legs; hungry, broke, and begging for his old job back. Nobody had wanted to take a chance on some nobody blacksmith who hadn’t even apprenticed under anyone.
He takes several deep breaths, trying not to spiral back into self-hatred again.
When her father and cousins come over, she goes still as a statue, gloved hands periodically reaching for her handkerchief to dab at her wet eyes.
me, there’s a big damn difference. Congrats pal, you rescued a stray cat. There’s a reason someone else threw that cat to the street – there’s something wrong with the cat; there’s something wrong with me.” Dean’s never known how to stop his mouth from going, once he gets going, “You found me that night, drunk and delirious on my mother’s grave with my gun in my mouth. You think you did me such a damn favor – you think you rescued me – but it would have been a
Dean feels exposed, vulnerable and put on display in the best kind of way. He rocks up a bit, watching his own fever-red erection bob with the motion.
“’S not like I’m wearing her dresses, Sammy. It’s okay, it’s just some gloves and her mourning veil.” An uneasy feeling builds in Dean’s stomach. He suddenly feels nauseous. What if Sam was right? What if he was dishonoring Mary?
A week later, he receives a package from Lisa’s neighbors. Inside is one of Lisa’s embroidered handkerchiefs and the doll Ben had almost grown out of carrying around. Dean keeps them in a show box in the parlor, despite Sam’s complaints regarding the morbidity of it all.
“Zachariah is dead,” Castiel’s voice betrays no emotion, and anyone less familiar with him may have taken his indifference as an admission of guilt. Dean knows better – has become used to the steady tone, even in moments of crisis. He remembers when that voice…
“You- are those her gloves too? Do you have something you want to tell me? You can’t just wear mom’s clothes, that’s – that’s just wrong!”
Cas takes a shuddering breath and looks upward, willing himself not to cry. Death came hard and fast for children, especially children like Jack. He should have taken him for medical treatment when he was so feverish in the garden.
“Shut up, shut up no you don’t. Don’t you dare say that. Don’t you dare. You
“You’ve taught me a great deal, and I’ve read your father’s journal. I admit, the human interaction and lying is…intricate to say the least, but tonight was fairly cut-and-dry, by your standards.”
Dean closes his eyes as the petticoat goes on, over his calves and thighs, sliding up into place above his hips. The stays are next, cinching at his waist and drawing his chest in and up and – oh. He rushes to uncover the mirror so he can get a good look at himself.
Dean vaguely remembers his first drink. Somewhere around the ages of five or six, some demon had clawed him across the shoulder, deep enough that Dean could have sworn the nails scraped bone. He stumbled through the first line of an exorcism, distracted by the blood running down his arm. John saved him (always saved him) and had rushed him back to the motel, sat him down, and gave him something to bite down on before beginning the slow, methodical process of sewing the wound shut. The next thing he remembers is a bottle being pressed to his lips, with a quiet
Dean is vaguely aware of Cas’s hands moving into his hair again before he’s too tired to be aware of anything. He falls asleep without a gun under his pillow for the first time since his mother died.
Cas is at Dean’s side in a second, cool hands against his forehead like a blessing.
“It was a hard mourning, but I think I’m ready to talk to him again.”
“Shh, go back to sleep, beloved. I’m here now”
. It’s the same tone he used the night when he first found Dean; first
Three days later, Charlie comes down with the same fever. Despite Dean’s best efforts, she’s gone within the week.
“Look look it’s our own mystery man, out of hiding. We thought you were dead, mourning the loss of that freak of a brother of yours.”
“I’m here, darling, it’ll be okay,” He sits on the bed, propping Jack up against his chest. His breathing is shallow and quick, as if he can’t manage to take a full breath.
He could sit for hours and get lost in the way the blue embroidery in the shawl makes Cas’s eyes look like the exact shade of blue as the sky was on the day they picked berries together, but the eerie silence makes his skin crawl – something is wrong.
“Just wondering how we are ever gonna do anything like this with Liam in the house. We can’t always pawn him off on Sam when we want a weekend to have filthy sex.”
Dean shakes his head. “No, don’t wanna stop. Please. Just meant I’m really fucking close and I don’t wanna come yet, not until you’re in me, not — not until you say so,” he says in a rush, and Cas untenses, his breath leaving him. He drops wet kisses to Dean’s back before leaning up to nibble at his ear.
boyfriend,
Cas tugs at the fabric, letting it snap against his skin. “On or off?”
as he finally, finally comes hard, cock shooting hot inside his panties, lace rubbing rough as he grinds desperately into the mattress, gasping. It’s one of those good orgasms that seems to go on forever, making him tremble as tears finally fall to wet his cheeks, hands scrabbling at the headboard. “Oh, God, Cas,
“Please.”
Cas groans and lays fully on top of Dean, covering him, as he slides his hands up Dean’s arms to weave their fingers together, palms pressed to the back of Dean’s hands. Dean’s held fast, Cas’s chest and hands and hips and cock pinning him to the mattress as he fucks him, and Dean is burning up with it.
Dean’s cock is well on its way to being hard again already, and he’s breathing a little heavy, staring back at Cas.
” Cas says through gritted teeth, hands finding their way into Dean’s hair as his hip buck off the mattress. This isn’t going to last long, not with the way Dean is rubbing his tongue along the underside, maintaining a mind-bending suction as he moves, mouth hot and wet and fucking incredible.
Dean freezes, blushing hot. “Um.”
Cas makes quick work of getting the lube out of the nightstand and getting some on his fingers, the slick substance sliding down his palm in his haste. He circles Dean’s hole with wet fingertips until Dean arches and begs again, and then Cas finally sinks a finger in to the knuckle, Dean so relaxed from Cas’s tongue there’s no resistance.
Dean blushes. “I’m fine. Better than fine. They’re, uh — good tears. Promise.”
Dean blushes so pretty, and he’s quieter than he’s been in a long while when he says, “On.”
Dean opens his eyes when Cas touches his face with a gentle hand, but he still flinches away from the touch. Cas pulls his hand back. “What’s wrong?”
Cas groans and Dean reaches a shaking hand back to grip his thigh. “Come on, Cas, give it to me. Fuck me hard, baby, please, want it so bad,” Dean babbles, tongue even more loose now after coming so hard.
Dean smiles softly, taking Cas’s hands in his as he nods. “Yes, baby,” he says. “I’m okay. Feeling good with you — it — it helps. Takes my mind off of things, y’know?”
He moans as he slicks up his cock, so intense it feels like he’s never been touched before, and he makes quick work of it. He knows that looking down at Dean could be his undoing, but he does it anyways, and has to squeeze the base of his cock hard when he sees the lace of Dean’s panties still bunched up beneath his cheeks.
Dean nods, mouth open and panting against the pillow, and Cas can’t resist leaning in to kiss and nuzzle at his cheek.
“You’re such a good boy,” he murmurs, delighting in the way goosebumps rise all over Dean’s skin, his face and neck and ears going pink. “So good for me, gorgeous.”
“Sweet boy,” Cas murmurs, kissing Dean’s face, cheeks nose forehead lips, as he comes down, still stroking him gently. “I love you.”
Christ,” he growls, coming with a sound that’s damn near a shout, and Dean takes him deep again, moaning as his nose presses into finely-groomed hair. Dean swallows around him until he’s spent, then kisses around his shaft until Cas pulls him up to kiss him deep and hard, tasting himself on Dean’s tongue. Eventually he has to pull away to breathe, and Dean drops a kiss to Cas’s forehead with a smile before pulling them both to lay down, Dean laying across Cas’s chest with an arm slung around his waist.
It’s not long at all before Dean is demanding more, and Cas obliges him, two thick fingers pressing deep. He scissors them as he sucks a dark mark into Dean’s ass cheek, and when he crooks his fingers down —
“I love you,” he whispers.
“Fuck, Dean.”
It surprises Cas when Dean doesn’t pull away, instead running his fingers up Cas’s chest to hook around his neck as he kisses him again and again. What started as a gentle means of comfort quickly becomes hot and intense, Dean encouraging Cas’s mouth open so he can lick his way inside.
“Jesus —
“You can come whenever you want, darling,” Cas says. It’s only a handful of tight, slick strokes later that Dean is coming with a soft “
the last time they’d discussed it. “They’ll want some alone time, too.”
Dean meets his eyes, almost shy.
He halts his hand when Dean doesn’t answer him. “Sweetheart?”
“Mmm, fuck,” Dean murmurs. “Fuck, that’s good.”
“Dean? Are you okay?”
Dean laughs incredulously, shifting so his head rests on Cas’s chest, arms winding around him tight. “Feeling like I just got my brains fucked out,” he grins. “God, Cas, that was — fucking unreal.”
“Cas, baby — please, you gotta —
They had both been lost as soon as Cas had unzipped Dean and seen the lace resting at his hipbones, and now Dean was damn near crying listening to the dirty slick sounds of Cas’s tongue in him, overwhelmed and panting and not getting enough friction but still so close,
“You are good,” Cas says into his hair. “You’re so good. You’re perfect. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“That’s okay. Thank you for telling me. I’m going to get you a glass of water, okay? I’ll be back in less than a minute.”
Dean blushes and shoves at his chest, grumbling a good-natured “shut up”.
“What do you need? What can I do?”
“God, you’re gorgeous,” Cas whispers, watching the way Dean’s stomach jumps when he swipes his thumb under the head of Dean’s cock, watching his hand glide up and down his length, and Dean kisses him hot and needy, more tongue than anything but still so fucking
“Mmm,” Cas rumbled from his place between Dean’s ass cheeks, tongue laving against his hole. They’d been at this for awhile now, Dean splayed out on his stomach gripping the sheets and whining into the pillow as Cas took him apart.
Cas swallows hard before saying “I often feel the same way,” ignoring the crack in his voice. “I love you.”
When they finally break apart — both of them more affected than they should be, considering how they’d both just come hard enough to see stars — Dean says, “Camera?”
“I could tell,” Cas says, a little smug. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the neighbors heard you. I’m glad Liam’s staying with Sam for the weekend, otherwise that may have been traumatizing.”
“I know,” Dean says, shifting back to start kissing his way down Cas’s chest, “but I want to.”
That is, until after several long minutes of Cas grinding into him languid and slow, murmuring love and affection, he leans over Dean to press him down into the mattress, hands braced by his shoulders — which comes with the beautiful side effect of his cock nailing Dean’s prostate.
When he’s spent, they lay for several long moments, trying to catch their breath. Finally, Dean speaks.
Cas, for once, stumbles over his words. “I was mostly joking, but if you — we could try — are you...?”
“Love you,” Dean breathes. “Please, c’mon. Fuck me like you mean it.”
Dean chokes out a sob against Cas’s neck, and Cas asks, “Why do you think you aren’t?”
Dean sniffles again as a wry smile passes over his face. He finally looks up at Cas, green eyes still shining with leftover tears, and he cups Cas’s cheek gently in his hand. Cas turns and kisses his palm. “How’re you so smart, huh?” Dean asks softly. “I’ll never know what I did to deserve you loving me, but fuck if I’m not thankful for it.”
“Mhm,” Dean says against his mouth, rolling his hips again, cock rubbing along Cas’s tight stomach. “Will you touch me? Please?”
too far to go for sex as good as this?”
“You don’t have to,” Cas says.
that Cas is forced to close his eyes again in hopes of holding off just a little longer.
Cas,” Dean said, somewhat muffled into the pillow where he’s buried his face.
“There you go, gorgeous,” Cas rumbles. “So good for me.”
“Dean?” Cas asks, not moving, fingers still buried deep. “Dean, do you want to stop?”
, Dean, you feel so fucking good.”
” nails digging into Cas’s bicep as he shakes through it, come coating Cas’s fingers and belly.
,” Cas grits out, letting his head fall back and his eyes slip closed for a moment. “
“Hmm,” Cas hums, running a soothing hand up Dean’s spine, following the path with his mouth until he’s kissing across Dean’s neck and shoulders. “We’re still a ways from that, I think —“ Dean whimpers — “but I’ll give you what you want.”
“Maybe?”
” Dean says lowly, and Cas smiles where he has his face tucked into Dean’s neck.
Dean pants into the pillow, hands clenched tight.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas growls into his ear, slamming into him harder. “Gonna come on my cock, aren’t you, baby? You’re so desperate for it, you look so fucking gorgeous, c’mon, be a good boy and come in your panties for me. Let go, sweetheart, wanna see you fall apart.”
Dean moans as Cas starts to slide in and out, slow. Dean reaches his arms above his head, spine stretching as he rocks back onto Cas’s cock, sighing.
Dean looks up at him with his watery eyes and trembling lips and holds his hands out towards Cas tentatively, as if Cas would want anything more in the world than to hold him close, soft and warm against his chest, whispering all the reasons he loves him into his hair.
“I know. I’m sorry.”
I fucking hope so,” Dean groans, then goes quiet save for the sounds punched out of him as Cas builds up to a hard rhythm.
it makes Cas’s heart pound.
“You don’t have anything to apologize for, Dean,” Cas tells him again, and that’s when Dean’s tears really begin to fall. Cas drops a kiss to his temple and lets him cry on his shoulder, secretly fighting the sting of oncoming tears in his own eyes.
Dean’s still shaking minutely, and Cas wraps his arms around him before he asks, “You okay?”
“Come here, sweetheart,” Cas says, opening his arms, and Dean scrambles to get in his lap, shoving his face into Cas’s neck as he trembles. “Shh, Dean,” Cas strokes his fingers through Dean’s hair, trying to fight the uncomfortable clench in his own chest. He grabs the comforter and pulls it up around Dean’s shoulders in an attempt to calm the tremors running through him. “Talk to me. What’s going through your head right now?”
Dean’s fingers grip into Cas’s back as sobs rack him, and Cas just holds him as he cries. He gets the feeling that Dean has never let himself let go like this, and he’s willing to hold him all night if that’s what Dean needs. A few minutes pass of Cas rubbing his fingers through Dean’s hair and murmuring how much he loves him, how beautiful and strong and good he is, and Dean cries harder — so Cas switches to humming softly instead, some song that popped up on his Spotify shuffle sometime in the recent past.
Fuck, does Cas know. “Okay,” he says, swooping in to kiss Dean again, blood running hot when Dean bites his bottom lip gently. “If you’re sure.”
“Mmmhm,” Dean responds, “God. So good.” It’s the truth. This slow grind together feels fucking fantastic after the God-knows-how-long of desperation as Cas kept him wound tight and ready to burst. Dean’s still hard as a fucking rock and straining against the front of his panties, but some of the edge has been taken off, and he’s content to ride this gentle rhythm for awhile.
“Okay,” Dean breathes, and he reaches back to place his hand on top of Cas’s where it’s kneading now-pinkening skin, leans in for another hot and claiming kiss. “Okay, definitely round two. We’ll talk more about gags later — right now, we’re testing
“Ready, baby?” Cas asks, already breathing hard, and Dean finally looks over his shoulder to meet his eyes.
Dean has been quiet and distant all day, responding to Cas but not really talking to him, and Cas isn’t sure what’s caused it. He gives Dean his space, trusting — hoping — that Dean will come to him if he needs him.
He sits back on his knees and grips Dean’s hips, fucking him through it.
“You want that?” He asks, voice dipping back into the timbre it only reaches when he’s super turned on. “Want my fingers down your throat as I fuck you into the mattress? Want me to get you hard and desperate for me like you were tonight, then take your panties off and shove them in your mouth to keep you quiet?”
After several minutes of his steady breaths against his neck, Cas begins to wonder if Dean’s cried himself to sleep, but that’s when Dean sits back, sniffling and rubbing his puffy eyes. He wipes the tears off of Cas’s neck and his voice is gritty when he says, “This is pathetic, isn’t it? Crying over a guy that treated me like shit.”
“Jesus
***************
Dean chuckles, and his voice is raspy when he says “Anytime, baby.”
Cas freezes. “No?”
Dean nods, tears dripping down his nose, and Cas wants to kiss his forehead but refrains. He washes his hands and gets a glass for Dean, making it back from the kitchen in record time, smiling softly when Dean sits up to take the glass from him. He drinks it slowly, keeping his eyes down, and Cas doesn’t miss the way his hands shake as he passes the glass back to him. He sets it to the side without taking his eyes off of Dean.
When they wake the next morning, Dean feels a little less fragile. His eyes are sore and tired and his head is pounding but he kisses Cas, thinking what a lucky bastard he is to have someone that takes the broken shards of him and pieces them back together with care and gentleness, like Dean is something to be treasured. It hits him that Cas is really it for him, realizes that Cas has always been the one who sees Dean’s broken pieces and pours himself — his adoration, his love, his sweet words — into the cracks until Dean once again feels whole.
It’s quiet for so long that Cas is about to repeat himself, but then Dean starts saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” tears flowing down his temples — not oh-fuck-that’s-good tears, but something’s-wrong tears, and Cas pulls his fingers out, not liking the sound of Dean’s pained whimper.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Cas growls, biting at Dean’s chest. “Behave, or you’re not coming tonight.” The way Dean flinches hard doesn’t escape Cas’s notice, and it stuns him for a moment — that’s certainly not the filthy moan Dean usually responds with when Cas takes control. Cas looks up and frowns to see that Dean’s eyes are squeezed shut, his chest heaving.
“Cas,” Dean breathes, “Cas, ‘m so close, please — can I —“
Cas licks into him, slow and hot and wet, and Dean sobs.
Dean’s breath hitches in his throat as he stutters out, “I—I think I’m r-red.”
Dean buries his face in Cas’s chest and Cas squeezes him tighter. “Yeah. For right now — yeah.”
” Dean’s voice breaks on an honest-to-God
“You don’t have anything to apologize for,” Cas says, and Dean falls silent. “Dean, baby. Look at me, please.”
Cas kisses the top of Dean’s head, breath evening out. “Fuck, you're incredible. Thank you, sweetheart.”
Cas hums. “We’ll discuss that more later when our brains are back online, but I’m glad they’re good tears.”
“That was fucking unbelievable, but, uh. Kinda hard to breathe under here, babe.” He pats Cas’s hip and Cas chuckles as he finally pulls out and sits back on his knees — and groans at the picture Dean makes, sweaty and flushed, fucked-out and tear-stained. His thighs are still trembling. The panties are likely a lost cause, stretched out as they are, but the white still looks beautiful against Dean’s creamy skin. His spent cock twitches.
noises with each brutal thrust as Cas fucks him closer and closer to the edge. Cas’s fingers are squeezing Dean’s and the headboard is thunking against the wall with every thrust and Dean is so fucking desperate for it, having been on the precipice for what feels like hours. He fucking loves it.
Dean is silent for long minutes, and Cas waits him out, running fingertips up and down his spine. He’s about to ask again when Dean says quietly, “Dad died seven years ago today.”
Dean shakes his head, sniffling again. “I just wanted to ignore it. I wanted a day with you where I didn’t have to think about it.”
For Cas, growling and unable to keep his hands off, rough palms gripping and kneading skin harshly as he licked into Dean’s mouth and manhandled him onto the bed — or Dean, gasping at the feel of the lace pressing against his hard cock as he rutted against Cas’s hip, against the mattress, whining and spreading his legs when Cas rolled him to his stomach and yanked the panties beneath Dean’s cheeks and dove in to slick him up with his tongue.
Dean nods frantically, sounds taking on the sweet cadence of begging when he says “Yeah, please, Cas — fuck, please, give me more.”
Making everything even hotter is the way Dean’s moaning around his length, so fucking enthusiastic and

Cas has two fingers working in and out of Dean, rubbing hard at his prostate, watching him pant and writhe beneath him. “You like that?”
Cas rubs the fingers of his clean hand down Dean’s spine, and when Dean lifts his head Cas makes a show of sucking Dean’s come off his fingers.
Cas holds him through it all and listens, lets Dean get it all out. He’s proud that Dean trusts him enough with his heartache, proud that Dean is willing to be comforted when he’s so used to tamping down his emotions, but Cas’s heart still breaks. When Dean seemingly has no words left — just tears, soaking Cas’s neck and shoulder — Cas spends a long time murmuring soothingly to him. He tells Dean about his beauty and his intelligence, about the radiance he sees when he looks at Dean, about the joy and peace and belonging Dean brings into his life. He tells him he loves him over and over, tells him that he is enough, will always be enough, and that Cas will love him until his last breath, will spend his whole life telling him how perfect and sweet and good Dean is.
It had been a good day. Claire had pulled her own weight on the hunt, as expected, the werewolf incident seemingly behind her, though she seemed affected when she heard about Mick. He suspected having Kaia back helped take the edge off. Not that he was going to mention it. He was happy for them, but he could feel her eyes trailing on Cas and him, and even if she didn’t know for sure about their recent developments, he thought it better to carry on with some sort of truce regarding personal relationships. Thus, steering away from those matters, the conversation flowed comfortably. He found himself feeling reluctantly sorry to go back, but made a purpose to visit more often.
‘For whatever’s worth, I don’t think he did it on purpose. Bring us back, that is. And of course he prayed, didn’t we have a succession of Tuesdays because he wouldn’t let you go? Get with the program, would you?
‘So, Gabriel thinks… Cas, you’re here!’ As Sam walked into the room, his eyes did linger on their joined hands but they quickly focused on Castiel, as he made his way to give him a fast hug.
‘Well, you didn’t give me much time to come up with an answer.’ He let out an ironic laugh. ‘Cas, you cannot say you can’t have me. You have for a while, I just… I guess I’m not sure what goes next.’
‘I am, Dean, this was an easy hunt.’
‘I will help you look. You can stay in the meantime, don’t listen to Dean, we’ve reinforced the guards.’
‘How should I know? I haven’t precisely presented for rollcall in heaven. You could ask him, you know.’
That night, Dean made burgers and it almost felt like he stopped resenting Gabriel as they sat around the table. Sam humoured Dean’s facade of a supply run, asking if they’d run into any trouble. They didn’t, but Jody’d called about a pack of werewolves passing through South Dakota. Sam saw Gabriel avoid his eyes as he described the situation, and was relieved when Dean said he’d take them with Cas’ help, even if he knew it was his way of keeping Gabriel supervised.
‘It’s not a boardgame, it’s Pandemic, Sam.’ He paused. ‘Cataloguing and organising is all good, but you probably hadn’t had a day off since before I showed up.’
Gabriel snapped his fingers and materialised a boardgame in the table between them. It startled Sam, but he still noticed the way his face flinched like it took him more effort he’d thought.
‘A week or so? Things are still mushed up here.’ He rested a hand on his forehead. ‘The empty was supposed to be the eternal rest. It was just loud enough to jamble my sense of time.’
‘I prayed for anything, what was I supposed to do?’
‘Like Rowena wanted the Black Grimoire?’
He didn’t dwell on it, though, what with getting the time to chance to talk to Alex and try and help Patience navigate the whole Psychic thing. Not that she actually needed much, she was adapting just fine, but he did wish Sam would have tagged along, being that he was the one with premonition experience. Someone’s gotta keep an eye on Gabriel, he reminded himself. That’s the same thing he’d told Jody when she asked that afternoon over lunch.
‘What do you want?’
‘Let’s start off simple, how do we play this?’
‘How do you eat, by the way? Doesn’t it all taste like...’
‘Did Jack bring Cas back too?’
‘We’ve taken him before. You’ve taken him before.’ He corrected himself. ‘We’ve seen archangels die.’
‘Molecules? Yep. But I can deactivate the angel mouth, call it an archangel perk. Can’t imagine walking this wretched earth without maple and bacon donuts.’ He gave Sam a casual look and then leaned towards him, inspecting him. ‘You
They dropped off the kids in a precinct inside the city, and Gabriel proceeded to lie down on the backseat. Dean turned on the radio and opened his mouth to question him, but Sam beat him to it.
‘Kind of fully back. Glad I probably won’t be needing it to fight, though.’ He didn’t seem to want to talk about it, and vanished the symbols with a dismissive gesture.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Cas, if you are alive, if you can hear me… I get it if you don’t want to talk, or if you can’t right now. I would just like to see you.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘We’re talking about Gabriel, who would he even try to resurrect?’ Cas intervened, having heard the story.
‘What are you talking about? I’ll always want to see you, Cas. You are my best friend, you’re family. And, what you said...’ His words faltered. He’d thought it’d be easy once he was sure the angel was alive. It wasn’t.
It was around four when they heard the bunker’s door opening and stopped examining a Prognosticator that seemed in surprisingly good shape for something all the way from the XIV century. They entered the room as Dean was restocking their fridge with Castiel’s help. Sam was glad to see him more adjusted in the bunker. He’d feared the angel would go back to Heaven with Jack, but his worries were probably unjustified.
Sam carried a pile of books to the table, passing half of them to Gabriel. If they were looking for an enchantment, they’d have better luck starting with books, he reasoned. Not that he knew a lot about what he was looking for, or that there weren’t some spellbound objects, but it was a place to start. Gabriel had been flipping through some graphic novel and seemed surprised.
this isn't a filler chapter but kindof felt like one.
‘Usually.’
‘Come on, I’ll just give you the rules.’
‘You don’t have to explain yourself to me. I’ve lost hope before too.’
‘Don’t worry, vessel boy, I’m sure Raphael and Michael are making quick work of Lucifer as we speak, if they haven’t already.’
Something shifted, it was on his free arm raising to hold Dean closer, not so much as to prevent him from stepping away as it was to prove himself this was real. It was on the careful dam he’d built around his feelings that was now coming undone, on the way his approach became more demanding. He pressed forward looking for the pressure of the hunter’s body on his, personal space be damned, filling his senses with Dean; the warmth of his skin bleeding through his shirt, the scent of gunpowder and a vague taste of blood filling his nose, faint remains of grace… grace.
‘Sam, about what I said in that barn...’
They read in relative silence until lunch time rolled over and Castiel and Dean were still out, when Sam put down his book and went make himself a sandwich. He read Dean’s text telling him they’d be late and they were fine and shoved the phone back in his pocket. Supply run, he thought, sure. He knew Castiel disliked eating as an angel, but he’d seen Gabriel eat before, so he made him a sandwich too. The gesture seemed to surprise him, but he gladly stopped the research for a lunch break. When they were done, he squinted at the books left on the table.
‘They left early for a supply run.’
‘I’m an archangel, if I had to tell you everything I know or think I’d be better off killing the both of us. Here, why don’t you shuffle these cards?’
‘Well, you could tell me some.’ The archangel stopped fidgeting with a blue tile marked with some sort of spiral and raised his eyes to meet Sam’s, who shrugged. ‘It doesn’t have to be everything, it doesn’t have to be about this spell, it doesn’t have to be important.’
It’s not long before Cas is pounding into him, and Dean writhes and whimpers beneath him. He’s shifting his hips, shoving up into Cas as much as he can, gasping “
“Can I suck you?” Dean murmurs into his ear, and he feels Cas’s cock twitch in his hand, grip tightening around Dean’s hips. Dean grins.
Dean whines. “I need — need you to t-touch me, or put your fingers in me, or
“Cas,” he says as he feels it building, building, and he’s mortified to realize there are tears in his eyes, so overwhelmed and needing so bad. “Please, please, please — so close — can I please —“
Cas wasn’t expecting anything tonight given Dean’s mood, content to cuddle up to Dean until they both fall asleep — but then Dean grabs him by the throat and pulls him in to kiss him hot and hard, and well, Cas is easily convinced.
Cas laughs. “I could just gag you.”
Cas smiles. “Good, baby?”
When Dean sobs one final time and melts into the mattress, Cas leans over him to kiss his neck, nuzzling his cheek to get him to bring his face out from where it’s buried in the pillow. “Okay, sweetheart?”
Cas thumbs the tears away from Dean’s cheeks and shakes his head. “No. You’re allowed to feel and work through whatever emotions you feel.”
“You just did, but I’m thinking we could go for round two.” Dean grins, smug.
Later that night, after they wake up from their post-sex slumber, grief slams into Dean again. Cas finds him in the kitchen, hands shaking and tears streaming, and Cas takes him to bed and holds him as he cries. He tells Cas about how he feels like a failure, how easy it is to fall into a downward spiral when he thinks of his father and his expectations for Dean, how much it feels like he’s not enough, how he feels like a disgrace to his family name.
He scissors his fingers inside of Dean for a few more moments, watching Dean tremble and writhe, before he pulls them out. Dean whines at the loss, and Cas shushes him as he grabs for the lube again.
Cas grins. “Gonna fuck you hard, baby,” he promises, starting to roll his hips with purpose. “You’re gonna be a mess by the time I’m done with you.”
His brain plays the melody, “
“That’s understandable,” Cas says in a voice he hopes is soothing, “but ignoring it isn’t worth it if it leaves you like this. This isn’t good for you.”
“Yeah?” he asks, grinding in deep again. “Right there?”
“...maybe.”
Cas laughs and rubs a hand down his spine, leaving it to rest at the small of his back. “Really, though — you’re okay? You’ve never cried before.”
He spreads his thighs further apart — as much as the panties will allow — and Cas rewards him by picking up the pace, whispering
“Dean,” he says, hand on his chest to make sure Dean meets his eyes, “Is this a good idea right now?”
Dean turns wet eyes towards him. “More than okay,” he rasps. “Jesus fuck. C’mon, get yours. Come in me.”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, I’ll bet.” He scratches gently at Cas’s chest hair, contemplating. “We could look into soundproofing? Is that too far to go for sex? Is
Cas doesn’t say anything for a long minute, and Dean gathers the courage to look up at him again. His pupils are blown out, black dominating blue.
— so fucking gorgeous.” He thumbs at the tear tracks still on Dean’s cheek. He kisses him again, just a press of lips together, unable to resist. “It was just a thought. How are you feeling?”
Cas fucks down into him for another pitiful half-dozen thrusts before he’s coming so hard he’s actually dizzy with it, collapsing on top of Dean. He groans as he grinds into him, deep and slick, and Dean gasps.
‘I want you, Cas. I mean it, all the way.’
‘What I said, Dean, I don’t mean fraternal love.’
‘Dean, you’re not understanding this.’ He paused, trying to put it into words. ‘Angels aren’t supposed to want, aren’t supposed to ask for anything.’
Regardless, they found themselves in one of the storage rooms rummaging through the boxes. Sam took the chance to ask about Sigyn, and whatever reason she’d have to want Gabriel dead. Turns out, Norse widows can be vindictive. Gabriel changed the subject quickly when he found an old witches’ ladder he decided to wear as a garland around his neck, amusing Sam and making him apprehensive at the same time, as he tried to get it off the angel.
‘I don’t… We don’t really do ‘days off’’
‘I think you’ll have to thank my nephew and your brother, respectively.’ He sighed, at their confusion. ‘When Jack entered heaven, he brought us archangels back. And you,’ he turned to Sam, ‘you were praying so loudly, I thought it had to be something important.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I... I didn’t think. I mean, I didn’t know you felt this way.’ His voice was low and he finished the sentence almost like a question. It made something squirm inside of Dean’s chest. Sure, he wasn’t the best at expressing his feelings, or recognising them for that matter, but had Cas really thought their relationship was identical to the brotherhood he shared with Sam?
‘What do you say we change our approach? Maybe find some cursed objects or something. If I have to read another line in aramaic I’ll personally deliver myself to Sigyn, or any taker really.’
‘Gabriel’s here? He’s alive,
‘Yes.’ The angel drew a series of symbols in the air, on golden fire. ‘Writings as old as the angel tablet. If you see something like this you’ll know it.’
‘’Point is, you cannot make him leave tomorrow, not after he saved us in Apocalypse World.’
‘Rowena’ Sam lowered his gaze, then realised both items Gabriel had mentioned were weapons.or weaponisable, if nothing else. ‘Are you in trouble?’
‘Mimepire.’ He gave Cas an incredulous look. ‘Did you hear the part where i said the archangels are back? All of them?’
‘I’m fading pretty quickly...’ Sam couldn’t register another word. He couldn’t process the way a routine hunt had gone this wrong. He couldn’t believe Dean was asking him to leave him to die, and he found himself praying to every entity he could think of to do something about it. Not likely, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do. And his brother was pouring his heart out but he couldn't compute, it was all just wrong.
They stood there for a while, despite what Castiel had said, these were uncharted waters. He took a step forward, shifting his grip to the hunter’s elbow, and ever so slowly joined their mouths again with a gentleness that wasn’t surprising, but was close enough to doubt for Dean to want to erase any uncertainty in the angel’s mind. He held the back of his head close, his other hand finding its way to his waist. Cas’ lips were soft on his, and then they weren’t.
‘And yet, you’re here.’ Dean spat.
‘You mean, like...’ The angel thought about the words.
They ride home as the sun sets. Jack is glued to the window, making up little stories about every person they pass – giving them voices and grandiose accents. He tries an American accent, and it’s so terrible, it makes Cas smile until his jaw aches –
Dean finds the mourning box under his bed. As they’d only been courting, the rules were unclear. He’s a handsome young man, and nobody would really expect him to mourn at all, but he had truly loved them both.
As soon as the smile appeared, it vanished just as quickly as Dean read the next letter, folded up and crinkled.
"The cookies in the oven should be done, could you pull them out for me, Dean?" Castiel asks before tending to the rest of the dough he has in front of him. Dean nods and slips on oven mitts before pulling the oven door down and taking the cookies out, setting them on the stovetop before closing the oven door again. Just as Dean sets the cookies down and takes off the mitts, there's a knock at the door.
This wasn't a letter, Castiel had seemed to have more or less written down a dream he had had with Dean. Dean felt a harsh blush creep it's way up to his neck and paint his face as he drags his index finger along the side of the page as he reads the fantasy Cas had. "Jesus Christ, Castiel!" Dean groans as he gets to the end of the dream description Castiel had written.
"Hello?" Gabriel's voice cracks as it comes through the old speaker.
"Faggot"
to help Castiel. Dean promises himself that if he ever sees the blue-eyed, broken kid again, he'd hug, and maybe even kiss, the absolute shit out of him.
Dean set the letter aside and stood up, stretching, and hearing and feeling his bones click into place. He decided to go downstairs and grab some food before carrying on with letters from Castiel.
homosexual.
The letter was cut off there and Dean growled, annoyed. He was also kind of mad at Castiel's father for making an obviously false accusation that's so stupid it works.
Castiel's favorite room in the house is their large kitchen-dining-room. He spends most of his free time there, baking small pastries for Dean and himself. He's currently rolling out gingerbread dough for cookies for the Christmas party that's going to start soon. He takes a handful of flour and sprinkles some on the dough to prevent it from sticking to the rolling pin, putting the extra back into the bag. He smiles as he hears the front door open and heavy boots walking in the kitchen behind him. Dean wraps his arms around him and pulls him into his snowy chest, "What're you doing?" Dean mumbles into Cas's ear before kissing it.
Dean shakes his head. He was thoroughly disappointed in himself. With a hand running down his face, and a groaning sigh slipping through his lips, Dean moves on to the next letter.
The sun is just coming starting to come up as Dean finds the right apartment building. He hastily presses the button with the name
The more he read the letters, the more he fell for him, and the more he forgot about the Skype call he was going to do with Lisa that was supposed to be happening an hour or so ago. As his phone goes off, he ignores it and picks up the next letter.
There was a break in the letter and tears marked the next page up, painting it with their dried rings.
"Dean, I do not understa-"
With a happy and content sigh, he moves onto the next letter, blushing as he reads a few selected words as he skims over it.
"Gabe? Gabe! Let me in, please! Its Dean! From work!" Dean pleads, his voice wrecked and broken sounding. He waits impatiently for Gabriel to buz him in, bouncing in his toes.
Worrying his bottom lip between his teeth and ripping some of the chapped skin off of it, Dean reads over the letter in his hand and makes a face at the faint stale alcohol smell.
Dean holds his hand in the ambulance, shushing him and saying it's alright every time Castiel says he's sorry and how stupid is he is.
Dean sniffled and wiped his eyes. "Cas! Oh my God!" He chokes out. He wanted to track him down and hug the life out of him. Dean felt bad for Castiel, no teen, no child,
Dean smiled softly at the letter in his hand. It may not have meant something to Castiel, but it did mean something to him.
"Cas, its okay! I got you! I got you... I love you..." Dean's own tears mix with Castiel's and he bends over him to kiss him, "I got you..."
Dean smiled softly at the letter in his hand. It may not have meant something to Castiel, but it did mean something to him.
He smiles and picks up the next letter.
Castiel was released later the next night, sent home with a neck brace, and, the love of his life. They didn't do anything but cuddle and watch movies on Gabriel's couch while Gabriel worked at Bobby's. Dean dozed off and on throughout his stay at the Novak residence with Cas, Castiel laying on top of him and cuddled in the blanket they shared.
"Baking cookies... I don't think I added enough flour to the dough though... It is still sticky." Cas frowns as he grabs the rolling-pin and presses it into the dough. He sighs as Dean presses soft kisses to his neck, "Dean, we have guests coming over, and I have cookies in the oven!" Castiel laughs gently.
Dean gasped and his eyes quickly flicked back up to the top of the page.
He can tell how hurt and lost Castiel was when he wrote this. And it happened only a couple of months ago, so he would still be hurting, but, not as bad.
Dean smiled to himself. Castiel had admitted to liking him and he was alive and safe, for the most part. Dean was also more than glad that Castiel had chosen him for something to live for.
He wiped his tears away and shook his head, "Cas..." He breathed as he cried. He skimmed the note again, more tears rushing down his cheeks. He was a little afraid to go to the next letter, afraid it might be another or something like this.
A small whine escaped the back of Dean's throat and he shifted in his seat as he tried to fight the warm heat pooling in his lower abdomen. Instead, he decides to focus on the bold print and dominant state of the last name change. "Castiel Winchester... I could get used to that..." Dean chuckled to himself. With a quick hitch in his breath as he skims the letter again, he moves onto the next letter to take his mind off his quickly growing situation.
With a sharp inhale of breath, Dean grabs some tissues from his nightstand as the first drop presents itself. He groans softly and pants hard, catching almost every spurt of cum with the tissues.
"It's Cas! Mom, he-" Dean cuts himself off. Mary sets her mug of tea down and Dean falls into her arms.
Dean read the words with care, he smiled a little at the thought of having saved a life more than once. He set the note aside and picked up the stack of letters, thumbing through it. Each page had a ton of writing, the handwriting was very small and neat.
All Dean wants to do right now is hug Castiel, be there for him, comfort him... Cover him in kisses from head to toe. He wants to praise him for his courage and scold him a bit for his silly choices. He just wants to make him feel loved, wanted, safe, and happy. He flips to the next letter and shakes his head sadly.
Scribbled on it was a name, Castiel. Dean stared at the picture,
Dean prayed that the next letter would be about Castiel making some grand escape or somebody busting him out or something.
Was written in neat handwriting, none of which was Crowley's. He stared at it for a moment before opening it and finding tons of handwritten letters inside. He looked at the top one,
The more Dean thought about the weekends he worked at Bobby's, the more memories came back to him. Old feelings sparked back to life and flourished into something big.
Dean smiled and blushed. There was something about this letter that was so caring, so loving, he couldn't help but smile like a damn fool. Nobody beside his family had told him that he deserved to be happy, or be in a relationship that made him happy!
"I'm doing homework! I'm not even hungry anyway!" He hollers back. He picks up the next letter, noticing the old tear stains on it.
Yet another strikethrough. Dean bites his lip and worries that it might be another dark note.
It made his stomach flip?
He wished he could have read every letter Castiel had written, but this was fine. After all he had to go through a huge stack as is, and he could only imagine what it would have been if he had kept all of them.
Not really wanting to go on, but also curious, Dean sits up, dries his tears, and moves on to the next letter. This one has brown stains on it and burn marks, smelling of stale cigarettes and beer. He frowned at the writing that was all over the place, the spelling messed up and letters not properly written. It was almost illegible.
After Dean's thoughts clear of what possible scenarios would happen if he found the letters, he remembered one small detail. Castiel was never there in the summer. 'Jimmy' had stopped coming to work, and every time he asked Bobby where he was, he said he didn't know, or that he would tell him later. Dean gulps as he flips to the next letter, his mouth becoming dry as he spots the first drop of dried blood.
But there was one memory that he now held dear to him that came back at a fast pace. One that he couldn't even begin to justify himself for forgetting. One that made him smile and blush.
Dean runs a hand through his hair. The last sentences were smudged, wet stains that had dried made the ink run. Castiel needed help, he needed somebody to talk to, why didn't Dean see him and help him sooner? He sets it aside and moves on to the next.
"Queer".
Still speechless, and with tiredness gaining on him, Dean skims through the next letter, blushing at a few words he finds.
"Love you, too, Dean." Mary smiles and walks away, tucking her blond hair behind her ear.
Sleepy from the excitement and stomachs full of the food brought over, Castiel and Dean curl up under a blanket on the couch in front of the fireplace. Castiel sips on the red wine Sam had brought and left them and sighs contently. There's soft instrumental Christmas music playing in the background, mostly played by the piano, "Cas?" Dean looks at the man resting his head on his shoulder.
"Dean?" A voice croaks.
The paper was torn in half and crinkled which Dean could only imagine meant Castiel fought for it, but the other half was gone, forcing him onto the next letter, written in blue crayon.
i'm not quite sure what's going on with these chapters, but the refuse to be normal and keep over using spaces. it's annoying and I am yet again sorry for it. i don't know how to fix it
Dean took notice of the dried blood droplets and the new writing utensil and the small burn marks of a cigarette that got too close to the paper.
But before he did, he would have to end things with Lisa. Especially now since almost all his feelings for her had vanished and were pined on a shy, blue-eyed dork in a tan trenchcoat.
Dean quits the slow, teasing pace and picks up a much faster one. His mind wanders to how Castiel would look sitting on top of him, panting as he rides Dean. He focuses on how he would sound; would he be noisy or quiet? Would he use profanity or cut himself short when he is about to say it? Dean arches his back as he pictures Castiel being a noisy bottom in charge. The nerdy-looking dude who'd you swear up and down wouldn't ever use such foul language or do such a thing like this, cursing and mewling like a cat in heat as he angles himself to hit his prostate over and over, loving the way he's being stretched out. Dean runs a hand up his body, tweaking and teasing one of his nipples, fantasizing it was Castiel's plush lips and white teeth and soft tongue teasing it.
He laughed and giggled at the mindless flirting that made Castiel blush and turn away. Just a simple act of commenting on how cute he looked in the long tan coat he wears would turn him into a blushing mess. Even saying how cute he looked when he blushed, he would smile as Castiel's face would redden even further.
"Read it..." Dean says nervously. Castiel doesn't know what to expect and so he slowly drags his eyes across the paper.
Dean groans as he finds the letter unfinished. He has a feeling that he passed out drunk in the middle of writing it.
"We should get him an ambulance," Gabriel says calmly. Dean nods and lays Castiel in his lap, hoping with everything that he didn't ruin his chance of survival by his stupid and scared actions. Gabriel leaves the room as he pulls out his phone.
It's been almost four years since Dean read the letters. Its been almost four years since Dean and Castiel got together.
After Castiel is checked over, the doctors say how lucky he is to come out of this with just a major sprain. Castiel sleeps peacefully in Dean's strong arms, bundled up in a blanket they had shared for a while before Dean got overheated and gave it all to Castiel. The doctors come in every once in a while, wanting to keep Castiel overnight to keep an eye on him before he goes for counseling, and every time they do, they tell Dean to sleep. But he can't. Not after the trauma he's been through. Instead of arguing with them, he simply holds Castiel closer and rests his eyes until they leave the room.
Dean felt his face heat up as he set the letter down. He couldn't help but smile like an idiot. Castiel had just confessed his true feelings. A simple three-letter phrase that means a lot. He chuckles, unable to hide his pure happiness and picks up the next letter.
"Dean, who's Cas? I don't think you've ever mentioned them before!" Her voice is soothing as she rocks her sobbing son. Dean buries his face in the crook of her neck and sniffles.
Dean was utterly speechless as he stared down at the letter. He could vaguely remember the day he helped some dorky, crying kid to the office where they lead him to the school counselor. He thought it was just some simple thing like it didn't matter, but he was wrong. He was way wrong. It mattered a lot to Cas, and now it meant so much to Dean, knowing that it wasn't just a simple act of kindness.
"Jimmy?" Dean can sense the questions bubbling up within her and he pulls back.
"It's okay, Cas. I'm here now, you're going to be alright. I love you too. I always will! You don't creep me out! The letters made me fall in love with you, they brought back the crush I had on you! I love you!" Dean blabbers, his crying never seeming to stop, even when Castiel is brought out on a stretcher by paramedics.
"Dean, what's going on?" Gabriel asks as he rubs his eyes, letting Dean through the door. He should have covered up, but in his confusion and half-awake state, he couldn't find anything and now he's standing in his boxers at nearly five in the morning, letting his coworker into his apartment.
