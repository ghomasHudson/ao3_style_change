The Omega rubbed at his eyes as his vision blurred with exhaustion.

“You are delightfully old fashioned to wish that, Mr. Rogers.” Tony whispered. “But I didn’t need rescuing, I just needed some help.”
“...I didn’t mean to call you crying.” Tony whispered and Steve whispered back, “Baby, it isn’t
Tony clung to the Alpha tight, hooked his bare leg around Steve’s waist and rolled in the blankets until Steve’s bulk was above him again and they were touching forehead to forehead clear down to where their feet tangled.

“Oh hell.” Steve swallowed hard, straightening up to his full height when Tony came in close and staring down into the Omega’s honey shaded eyes. “Tony, I would love if you’d help me with a shower.”
, next time just knot me up full.”
He didn’t know the last time an Alpha other than Steve had done anything except verbally and sexually harass him, leer at him, dismiss him as not worth their time. But here Steve was not just
“Yeah.” The Omega managed a quiet chuckle. “I feel like I’d be okay with that, but Steve should we talk about--”
“Pucker up and kiss me right here.” Steve tapped at his forehead where the paint smear was. “It will make me feel better about running around looking foolish.”
“Don’t listen to them.” Hope bared her fangs at an increasingly huffy Natasha teasingly. “I would have thrown a decorative coaster at the TV if my team kept calling time outs too. I’m glad they let you back in the Saturday watch party sweetie, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you.”
There were three different forks, two knives, three different glasses for different drinks on the table. The napkins were embroidered linen, the table cloths pristine and crisply ironed, the wait staff dressed in all black complete with ties and dress shoes. When Tony used to visit places like this, they had greeted him as

they parted with shaky kisses and grasping touches unwilling to let go any sooner than absolutely necessary.

“Night kiddo.” Steve blew a raspberry on Peter’s little tummy and pretended like he didn’t hear Tony’s huff of disapproval when the baby immediately dissolved into giggles. “See you in the morning, kay?”

“Hi baby.” All of Tony’s worries melted right away when he stepped into the apartment and Peter turned round to squeal at him. The toddler raised tiny fists in excitement, grinned wide enough to scrunch his little cheeks up around his eyes and waddled just as fast as he could to greet his Daddy. “Aw c’mere Bubba. C’mere and hug me.”
“Now then.” Steve set his empty plate aside and clasped his hands between his knees. “What else do you need?”
“I’m actually here to see Steve?”
“I don’t see why not.” Clint caught the phone easily and pulled up a few profiles he’d already pre-scouted for his friend. “Someone needs to do
“Dirty.” Tony scrubbed at his nose and left a smear of black behind. “Oh! Did you come down here to drag me into the shower? Cos I’ve got this one spot real low on my back I’m having the hardest time washing and it is definitely the right size for you to fit in and…”
“That’s right.”
“Honestly?” Tony’s eyebrows raised almost imperceptibly when the waiter reappeared with a menu but only handed it to Steve, clearly assuming the Alpha would be ordering for the two of them. “I think my parameters for availability were so strict, I eliminated myself from most searches before anyone could find me.”
important all at the same time.
“I--” the Alpha closed his eyes briefly.
“Wake up all the way, sleepy bug.” Tony roused the toddler to full wake, and smiled hesitantly at Steve when Pete just burrowed into his chest and refused to look at Steve. “Sorry, he’s shy. All he knows is me, Peggy and Clint so he doesn’t do very well with new people. He might not even talk to you.”
“You’re not funny at all.” the Alpha informed him, but she finally smiled a little. “I’m glad no matter your previous experience that you are looking forward to tonight. Nervous but not scared, right?”

flow through him syrupy thick. “Me too.
Originally the apartment had been Steve’s escape from the modern world,   outfitted with WWII era furniture and an old style radio, thrift store curtains and outrageously expensive but authentic soaps and toiletries from the 1940’s. For a long time after the ice, the apartment had been something of a sanctuary from all the unknowns of the 21st century and went a long way towards keeping the fresh-from-the-freezer Captain sane.
“I’ll punch him if you want me to though.” Steve dropped a kiss on Tony’s head as he passed by on the way to the grill on the back deck. “Just say the word, sweetheart. I’ll lay his Bronco ass out.”
the usually overly conscientious Alpha was doing that-- the blond finally put himself together enough to head upstairs and find Tony and the

It was absolutely crossing at least a thousand different lines to step foot in that apartment, but Bucky couldn’t seem to stop himself and what the Alpha found inside made his insides swoop with what felt like suffocating
The questions weren’t cruel or even meant to put Tony on edge, nothing more than what most friend groups would ask the new person, but the Omega’s mouth was still dry as he tried to answer everything as truthfully as possible while not giving away anything important.
more sultry, this entire conversation would be out of either a cheap porno or one of those romance novels where the Alphas are full on nip nops out on the cover. You got good nip nops my man?”
“God, if I would have known a trip to the park was just an excuse for you to have a long conversation, I would have brought hot chocolate and snacks.” Tony huffed, faux irritated. “Alright Alpha, what else do you want to talk about?”
“Dada?” Peter asked sleepily. “Night night?”
“Whatever you want, Tony.” Steve kissed the palm of Tony’s hand and then the shine of that gorgeous ring. “Anything you want.”
“A stupid Alpha who learned everything about Omegas from porn.” Peggy finished, her lip curling in disgust over her blunted fangs. “My love, I am

his wants and wishes. “Thank you. This is incredible. A baby boy for us?”
After Peter was asleep on the side of the bed closest to the wall so he wouldn’t roll out, Tony sat on the cold floor and leaned against the bedframe with an exhausted sigh. He pulled a box of bills out from beneath the bed and what was left of his tips from the week from his pocket and spread the pages out to begin dutifully counting out dollars to pay each bill.
“Yeah see, I knew that was the wrong thing to say the second it left my mouth.” Steve groaned. “No Tony, you don’t look older and even if you did it’s not-- it’s not like it's a bad thing. When I said you were beautiful, I sure as hell meant it and Omegas like you don’t stand a chance at aging badly so--”
“So we can have it?” Steve lit up with a smile again and Tony--
“Mmmm.” Tony’s legs fell open when Steve spread his fingers to try and grasp at his bare thigh, he sighed when the big hand at his waist slipped down to knead at his ass and he turned as best he could to tilt his head up for an open mouthed kiss when Steve groaned his name, sucking at Steve’s tongue and grinding down blatantly
“Steve.” Tony sounded hoarse, and Steve’s mind went a hundred horrible directions as to why that might be before the Omega continued, “Hey, I’m sorry. Um, I got sick and have been sleeping most of the last few days. I’m sorry about missing our date.”
“Next year you can just go with me and we’ll do something special for it.” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple. “My parents have a bunch of land and the entire family stays for most of a week-- it will be fun.”
“I’ve got you.” Steve rested his hand hot over the blue garters at Tony’s thigh and spread his fingers steadying at the small of the Omega’s back, helping Tony with every motion. “C’mon baby, come on.”
“False.” Bucky countered. “I have suggested
“Really?” the Alpha poured a glass of wine and brought it into the living room for Tony and pressing it into the Omega’s small hand. “I’d let you win that bet.”
Steve carried the bag of leftovers the staff had
“Don’t worry about them.” Steve settled further into the couch with Tony as Bucky and Natasha wandered away to get more food and more than likely, to gossip. “Bucky’s my oldest friend and he and Tash hooked up on our first tour so she’s been around a long time too. They’re intense but good people. Once they get to know you they’ll love you. Promise.”
The third floor loft-turned-art-studio at Steve’s house caught the late afternoon sunlight from three different angles thanks to the windows he’d had installed the day after moving in. Morning sun tended to be too weak for natural light, midday sun too bright and often glaring, but the late afternoons and early evenings before the sun dipped behind the taller buildings in the distance was the perfect time for the Alpha to don his trusty painting apron and let his imagination and creativity out to run a little wild.
“Just for that, you're going to get the lowest tier ambiance available and have to eat spaghetti while watching a movie.” Steve pointed the pasta fork at the Omega faux threateningly. “Go on. Living room. Find a movie and get ready to try and look cute while balancing pasta on your lap and sipping wine without spilling it on my never used couch. Go on.”
I feel like what we do is one sided.”
“Mr. Carbonell.” She answered blandly, her smile almost condescending. “As a healthcare provider, it is my duty to establish if there are any particular circumstances or patterns of behavior that could lead to the child having any additional or future health issues. Unbonded Omegas are statistically very low income, it might be the cleanliness of the apartment or the walking to and from grocery stores in the cold weather, a lack of proper clothing-- any number of things could have contributed to this visit and we just have to make sure--”

right off the bat, Steve would ask questions and Tony didn’t want to have to provide those sort of answers.
. He didn’t know if Peter and Steve would ever actually meet and if they did, it certainly wouldn’t be right now so early in the relationship. The fastest way to alienate a new Alpha was to introduce him to a different Alpha’s progeny and god damnit, Tony needed the money from their arrangement too badly to risk it.
The place was tiny, no more than a few hundred square feet of living space altogether, smaller than Bucky’s master suite and only a bit bigger than his living room. The kitchen crammed into the corner had a two burner stove and an oven too small for even a full size cookie sheet, the microwave balanced precariously on the cracked counter would have been barely fit for a college dorm room, much less someone’s full time apartment. The fridge was short and squat but had at least a moderate amount of fresh groceries and the attached freezer was crammed with quick frozen meals, relieving a ball of

“You um--” Tony swallowed hard, clutching the envelope and what was clearly a stack of money inside. “You really want my biggest issues to be a crappy day at work and a tear in my favorite shirt?”
“It wouldn't be all that bad if I had someone to share it with.” Steve admitted, and before he could talk himself out of saying it or into saying something less awkward-- “You in the market for a roommate?”
“Tash, there ain’t a person alive who looks at you and thinks ‘yeah she seems like an Alpha who definitely

“If I have to take Pete back to Urgent Care cos he gets worse, it will take all of my extra money in my box.” Shoulders slumping defeated, Tony started walking in slow circles again, rubbing at Peter’s back and trying to hide weary tears in the toddlers thick hair. “I’ll be right back to not being sure if I’ll make rent and not being sure if I’ll have enough money to eat. I will never

The fourth box was accessories, two pair of sunglasses, a new wallet. There was a new watch in a practical, simple design, a new case for his phone, just one tie that matched each of the new button ups and a two belts, one in black and one in dark brown.
“Lots of non-typical Alphas become extremely traditional when it comes to families and mates.” Tony said softly, miserably. “And it’s not just me having a kid, it’s about me having Peter when I was so young, about my past and who my family is… there’s so much Steve doesn’t know and now I’m falling in love with him and I’m fucking
“Peggy?” Tony smiled when he heard the toddler playing in the background. “Hey, I’m sending an Uber for you and Pete. Pack an overnight bag and come spend the night with me.”

“I don’t know, love.” Peggy admitted. “But I think something has to give
“Thank you.” Everything about Tony was graceful, and Steve had a hard time looking away as the Omega sat and motioned with a smile for the waiter to fill his water glass. “So, Mr. Rogers--”
“Um.” Tony twisted his napkin anxiously in his lap, not sure where the conversation was going and very quickly seeing extra money for diapers flying out the window. “Please. Yes, be honest with me.”
The front door to his house closed and Steve hastily shoved his phone in his pocket, trying-- and failing-- to wipe the grin off his face before his guests walked through the door.
“Really?” the Omega frowned. “You want me to go back to college?”
“You’re so fucking beautiful.” Steve breathed in the last bits of perfume from the silky lingerie, then whispered hoarse, “Sorry for this baby, but I can’t help myself.”
thing to do-- admitting to being absolutely stupid when presented with a naked Omega, and Tony had to laugh a little bit.
. He shook his head as he sent one last text to check in. Steve knew damn well Tony wasn’t the sort to get an expensive gift and then disappear, hell the Omega had been trying to return the last expensive gift and exchange it for something more practical just last week. Tony wasn’t the kind of sugar baby or the kind of Omega to get something sparkly then move on to someone new so Steve pushed that thought away and focused on the other one--
“Tony?” Steve knocked tentatively on the spare bedroom door, breathing through his mouth so the bitter scent of

transportation meant to him. He could be driven to the grocery store instead of walking down the street with bags, he could take Pete to the park and not have to carry a heavy, sleeping toddler a mile back to their house, he could take Pete to the doctor and not have to stress about the money for a taxi or taking a sick baby on the subway.

“Okay then.” Steve fought against a smile, trying to look serious and stern as he pointed his fork at Tony. “I’m going to go get spoil-worthy towels.”

“The lottery, huh?” The Omega smiled, close enough that their mouths touched again. “So no one except Bucky and Natasha?”
“Tony?” Peggy came up the stairs to the apartment as soon as Tony texted to let her know they’d made it back home. “Tony, is Peter okay?”
“What do you mean?” Tony gave up on his curls and just fluffed them with his fingers, not caring whether or not they dried puffy. There were way more important things to worry about tonight than whether or not his hair was perfect. Besides, the bed head look was still in fashion… right?

“No, I don’t think you should wear white.” Steve had to work to keep his voice even, to keep from reacting when Tony visibly cringed from the words. “Partly because that’s an archaic, ridiculous and ultimately hurtful stereotype and also because with your skin tone, you should wear ivory instead. It would be softer and bring out the honey highlights in your eyes and if we get married in the summer, it would also bring out the way your hair lightens in the sun.”
Mr. Carbonell, I dunno how I feel about--”
Tony actually giggled to himself as the staff brought him a glass of champagne to go along with his lunch and leaned back into the comfortable chair wholly content with his day, perfectly spoiled and feeling as if he could melt right into the cushions and sleep for hours.
… Steve was still talking with Natasha and Bucky when Tony walked right back through the doors and into the living room.
but held himself back at the last second. He’d never heard of an Omega who hadn’t wanted settled but he’d never done a sugar daddy thing either so maybe this was… normal. “You still with me?”
“Extryy!” Peter chirped, bouncing his stuffed animal along the tile floor. “Extry extry!”
in those heartstoppingly blue eyes, but then–
“I’m sure you’ll be relieved to know that is exactly the sort of too traditional Alpha stuff that makes super modern Omega’s like me melt right into the floor.”  Tony squeaked just a little bit, more affected by the vulnerability from Steve than he was ready to admit and trying to pass it by with a bit of sass. “Would you like me to wear your tweed blazer, Mr. Rogers? Or perhaps that one sweater that looks like you swiped it from the wardrobe of a Dad on an 80’s family sitcom?”
This time the question wasn’t half as good natured, and Clint put the spatula away so he could grab at Tony’s wrist and pull him in close, looking the waiter over carefully to make sure one of the patrons hadn’t tried to get
“I feel like it’s not.” Clint bared his fangs in a wildly aggravating grin and followed Tony across the diner to deliver his plates as well. “You’re getting laid less now living in the same house than you were when you lived way over here in this shitty part of town. What gives?”
!” he stopped when Tony kissed him unexpectedly. “What was that for?”
“Yeah.” Tony said softly, sadly. “It really does.”
“So I was thinking about how to pay you for our dates--” the Alpha started then abruptly shut the hell up when Tony coughed water out of his nose in shock. “Oh damn, sorry do you need a napkin? I swear there’s no good ways to talk about this sort of thing without it sounding shocking and terrible!”
“You always do.” For the sake of the
“I might be an old woman now, but I spent more than my fair share of days in my younger years tying up my shirt to show off my belly button.” She informed him, smoothing out the collar so it showed a hint more of his collarbones and throat. “It’s all in how you roll the hemline-- tight enough to hold the tail ends trapped but smooth enough to look flush against your skin.”
Tony checked his phone quickly. Peggy had been happy to keep Peter until tonight since Tony had planned on returning the watch and then shopping for a couple of hours before the sale ended, and even with being detained and them calling Steve down to the store he still had some time so maybe….
“Aw hell, Omega I’m so glad to hear you say that.”
“Peggy’s all settled in the new place?” Steve tucked his gloves in his coat pocket so he could hold Tony’s hand properly, pressing at his mate’s palm when Tony stepped closer so their shoulders brushed as they walked. “How does she like it? Making any friends?”
“Well… thank you.”

“I was home this morning.” Tony’s tone sharpened. “And then I went to work. My babysitter texted that Peter was running a fever so I came right home and brought him in.”
“On sex night.”
Sheesh, if he was this smitten over a picture and a few messages maybe he really was as desperately lonely as Bucky said...
“...ugh, Clint.
"Steve.” Tony looped his arms around the Alpha’s neck and hugged him right back, propping up onto his toes to trill into Steve’s ear. “Thanks for inviting me.”

“If you can carry one, you can have one.” The Alpha promised, and before Tony could shout
The master suite was bigger than Tony’s entire studio apartment, the bedroom alone as big as his living space and the huge bathroom and walk in closet pushing the square footage well over six hundred, but Tony only had a second to gawk at it before he was practically tossed onto the king sized bed and sank into the plush mattress.
The idea that Tony apparently willingly worked at this place when it was real fuckin’ obvious that Steve would be happy to pay every single one of his bills was yet another mystery wrapped around the Omega, so Bucky filed that one away alongside the one about the kid, the old lady and why Tony only saw Steve once every two weeks.
“I’m fine.” he said again. “I’ll text you when I get home.”
“I’ll um--” he took a deep breath. “See you in a couple of hours?”
Steve swallowed, Tony could almost see the

Before Bucky could put together a full thought or even put words to the emotions-- sadness and sympathy and guilt-- crashing over him, a voice from behind him shouted, “Get away from my baby!” and in the next instant the Alpha was shoved hard enough to stumble back several steps as Tony raced forward in between them, popping his little fangs and snarling as he scooped the baby up into his arms and curled around him defensively.
Tony took a slow sip of wine, swirling the dark red liquid around thoughtfully before asking softly
….Ma Rogers’s No Fail Third Date Spaghetti was made with a sauce that simmered all day in a pot, fresh tomatoes and marsala wine, mushrooms that Steve always picked out afterwards, beef stock and a little chicken stock for flavoring, onion and chopped chilies for spice, maybe a dash or two of Tabasco for some heat, maybe a bit of sherry if the marsala wine didn’t cook down quite right. It was a tried and true recipe that never turned out exactly the same way twice but was

The jump wasn’t actually very high at all, and Peter bounced off the side of the mattress with a little
The Omega gasped quietly when Steve dipped his head and kissed him, the plates cumbersome between them and the Alpha leaning awkward over the dishes so the sauce wouldn't stain his shirt. He'd been waiting to kiss Tony since the moment the Omega had walked in with his stretchy pants and carefully tied up shirt and now he lingered over it, brushing the bow of Tony's lips and sweeping his tongue only softly at the corner of Tony's mouth.
“Here.” The recliner sat up enough to allow Steve to retrieve an envelope from the side table, and he pushed it into Tony’s hands. “This is for you and for Pete. There’s some more paperwork that needs to be signed and we’ll have to visit a brand office for that, but this is the start of it at least.”
traditional of an Alpha, I’d really like to see you in my clothes.”
Steve wet his lips anxiously before ordering for Tony, “-- my guest will have the sea bass with miso butter.”
“Tear them.” Tony whispered, gaze molten and lips red from being bitten. “Tear them babe, you don’t have to careful. We don’t have to keep them on, I’ll buy more. Tear these ones if you want to. You don’t have to be careful.”
even for you.”
and for Steve to suggest diamonds…
“Hey sweetheart, hey come here, I got you some water.” Strong arms and gentle hands gathered Tony up off the pillows, cradling him carefully before directing a water bottle to his lax lips, and Steve dotted sweet kisses all over his forehead before saying, “Drink a little bit so you don’t wake up all cotton mouthed.”
“Hey, you’re smiling.” Clint was off shift too, and the other Omega sandwiched himself in next to Tony, swiping one of the fries and drowning it in ketchup. “I like it. What’s up, did you finally match someone on that app?”
Tony was quiet, pale and withdrawn, arms folded tight to hide the way his hands were shaking, eyes wide as he watched the Alpha uncertainly.
“Doggie!” Peter was off in another direction, and this time Steve let go of Tony’s hand and

. “Tony, you gave me back my inspiration. You gave me a reason to smile and gave me back my joy of painting. We laugh together and I’m not lonely anymore, you challenge me and call me out on my bullshit, you aren’t afraid to poke fun at me and then not afraid to be honest with me…”

“Crap, no I don’t want you to

“Well--” Clint gestured helplessly. “I could’a told you that like a month ago. Why does that make you so sad? Falling in love with a rich Alpha is basically the dream, what’s the matter?”
“Good morning.” Despite being freshly showered and almost unfairly handsome for six in the morning, Steve’s voice was still slumber rough, rolling over a contented croon as Tony snuggled further into his arms. “I missed you when I was gone. Not to sound like a total creep of an Alpha, but I’m pretty sure I don’t ever want to be in different time zones from you ever again.”
“What do you mean?”
“What about something like this?” The Alpha pointed to a set of diamond ear climber earrings, the left side a line of gradually smaller diamonds and the right a simple stud. “You could wear them every day, hide them behind your hair while you’re working and then show them off when we’re out?”
“Um.” Bucky looked like he’d just walked into a brick wall and Natasha seemed just as confused. “What the hell just happened?”
after a month of missed dates and buying groceries on the Alpha’s card which definitely deserved the sort of thank you Tony couldn’t give in public.
“It’s way more tame than you’d think.” Tony tipped his head towards the roadster where it sat gleaming on a raised platform near the back of the garage. “I’ve spent the better part of the last twenty years restoring the Ford Flathead. Custom paint job, I built every piece of the engine, I learned how to upholster so if there’s ever a tear I can fix it myself. That thing is the closest I’ll ever get to having a child, and by
“Oh shit.” Steve dragged Peter out before Peter could get to him and wrapped both arms around his little frame, squeezing the toddler gratefully. “Oh my god, I was so sure you’d get hurt. You okay? Just bonked your head? You hurt?”
“This is Steve Rogers.” it was a number the Alpha didn’t recognize and he tried to keep his tone professional in case it was a future client instead of letting the disappointment over it not being
, up the cleanly neutral tone walls were toddler sized hand prints and what looked like feet prints in every color imaginable, slapped up about as high as Peter could reach and stomped low at the base boards and leaching onto the throw rug. One of the easels had the legs snapped off so it sat on the floor, what might have been a drop cloth was piled in a corner and dotted with still fresh paint and oh--
“Natasha!” Steve shut that question down and the redhead only smirked. “No running names through your wildly sketchy databases!”
“I’m a terrible parent, aren’t I?” Tony wasn’t just brittle, he was nearly
“I’ll tell you the whole story some other time.” the Omega said dismissively, and Steve took it as the hint it was and changed the subject.
The Omega met Peggy’s eyes steadily, and she smiled at him. “Everything’s going to be okay, Tony.”
“I can and I will.” Tony was practically floating, fuzzy around the edges and humming through the words, slightly sore between his legs but just about
“Come in.” Tony sounded as if he didn’t really want that at all. “Steve, come in.”
“I’ve got this.” Immediate regret made the words thick as Bucky scooped up the diaper box under one arm, put the messenger bag over his shoulder. “You just get Pete, alright? C’mon, we’re fine. Just-- just get going.”
“As ready as I’ll ever be.” The Omega surprised himself with just how reluctant he was to let go of Steve and meet everyone else. A stressful month apart had dulled Tony’s memory of how solid Steve was, how gorgeous those blue eyes and fanged smile and vibrating rumble was and the longer they held each other, the longer Tony thought maybe he

“It’s just us.” Tony cringed away from the disapproval the nurse tried and failed to hide. The stigma of a single parent or an unbonded Omega not being able to properly take care of their children was
In fact, out of all of their friends Bucky was usually the last one to rush into
He shuddered through a sigh. “Oh my god, Tony. I never imagined it would be like this. When you told me about getting on your hands and knees, I coudln’t believe it. And then the way you took all of me, let me empty everything into you– I mean, look at your

“It’s

The conversation switched from jewelry to sandwiches, whether or not Mayonnaise was even food, how sourdough was iffy because it was literally fermented dough…
when ticklish kisses turned sharp as Steve pushed the sweater down further and dragged his fangs along the jut of Tony’s collarbone, drawing red lines over the thin skin and sending
“Nope, not complaining though it would have been nice to come home with
“Heya babydoll.” Steve pulled Tony from Bucky’s side and gave him a quick kiss. “You okay?”
“Ohhhhh Steve....” Tony trickled
“I ordered the belts based on the pant size.” the Alpha clarified. “But if the waist needs taken in on the jeans, you’ll probably need different belts, too. Just let me know.”
!” Tony wheezed when the Alpha abruptly shoved him back onto the bed and covered him again, Tony’s back curved into an arc and Steve’s cock slotted into his center. “Fuck!”
“Steve.”
Most nights they watched a movie and went to bed early for some predictably, amazingly perfect sexy times, other nights they drank until Tony was tipsy and then danced in the living room until the stars came out, some mornings they lay in bed and shared an early breakfast, other mornings they slept late and went for brunch.
“Fiancée.” Howard’s gaze darted towards the baby again, but Steve purposefully turned enough that Peter would have to wiggle out of his arms completely for Howard to get a good look at him. “I see. Congratulations on the impending nuptials, I’m sure it's too far in advance to have sent out save the dates and invitations?”
“She can’t have kids.” Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist and tugged him across the couch cushion so the Omega could look at the apartment options for Peggy. “I’m not really sure and she doesn’t talk about it much, but we all know it bothers her. When Val and Diana had their kids, Tasha took an assignment that had her gone for almost four months trying to cope and of course, after work like that, she ends up scenting like blood and danger. Most Omegas won’t even come near her, kids tend to run the other way… the fact that Pete went right to her and decided he loved her is huge. The fact that you trusted her with Pete is huge. It means a lot to her.”
“Love you.”
, to spend the night but no overnighters was one of the Omega’s rules and he didn’t want to risk asking and wiping the smile from Tony’s gorgeous mouth.
Instead Tony moved onto the messages from Peggy and Clint, scrolled through the all-caps texts and repeated demands for a call and finally texted to the group:
“I love this.” Tony ran his hands gently over the messenger bag, peeking in all the compartments and imagining how it would so well for taking Peter along to the store-- space for a few diapers and wipes, some snackies for the baby and a water bottle and juice box. Steve didn’t know just how good of a gift a sturdy, dependable bag was for a single parent and the Omega clicked his tongue pleased over the design. “This is-- this might be my favorite thing. Thank you.”
“If Peter’s first swear word is
“Welcome home, Captain.” Tony’s smile was almost shy, mouth tilting up at the corners and movements hesitant as he plucked at the delicately thin strap of a satin slip and let it fall down to bare his shoulder. “I’ve been waiting on you.”
“Well I--”
He hung up the phone with Peggy, asked his Alpha, “Maybe we could help Peggy pay for a new apartment in a nicer part of the city? Somewhere closer to her friends and the senior activity center she goes to?” and when Steve immediately opened a new tab on his laptop to start searching for senior apartments with on staff nurses for just in case reasons, the Omega kissed him thankfully, then dialed another number.
Tony leaned over to wipe a bit of sauce from Steve’s chin and the Alpha turned his nose into Tony’s palm to kiss the Omega’s fingers gratefully. “But thanks to
“Nope.” the Omega’s voice wavered but he refused to look away. “Nope, you don’t get to break into my apartment and threaten my child and then not answer my questions. Absolutely not. What are you doing here?”

“You wanted to ask me something?” Tony squirmed in his seat and Steve’s gaze darkened another shade in sheer

relationship--” Tony flushed amused at the funny phrase. “-- because it has everything to do with what we turned that into, alright? Cos we sure turned it into something else, didn’t we? Way past sugary and into something at least a little bit real?”
with fear and apprehension. “How did you even find us? Have you been following me?”
“That’s not fair at all.” Tony grumbled, and the other Omega nodded, “Yeah well, it is what it is. I either gotta stay with Barney, figure out some way to afford to live by myself which I can’t since this place only lets me work part time, or I’ve gotta get mated up. Otherwise the state’ll want to put me in one of those Omega homes.”
situations the state might be inclined to decide Peter would be better off adopted into a bonded family pair instead of struggling through life alongside Tony.
“Grew up in Brooklyn.” Steve confirmed. “Did a couple years in the Midwest for football, but moved back here after I left the Army. I’m with you, New York is home, Brooklyn is home. Get me riled up enough and I still talk like the kids in the old neighborhood. Hey, how old are you really?”
He took a deep breath, Clint’s words about how Steve was maybe already in love with him ringing in his ears. “It doesn’t seem fair, is all. I’ve admitted to never doing the sugar baby thing before but even for an
“You’d be crying too hard at realizing just how smart I am and how hopeless the bet was to ever
“Well...yeah.” Steve waited until the Omega met his eyes hesitantly. “Are you planning on being here?”
“How are things going with you two? Your date last night must have been good if you’re still this happy.”
Steve planted one foot up on the bed so he could take Tony harder, reached up and wove his fingers into Tony’s hair to pull his head back and arch that beautiful body into a gorgeous bow. “Jesus fuck that’s so gorgeous, you are fucking beautiful, Tony!”
“Steve, I would like to see more of you too.” A whole truth. “And not just for the money.” Another whole truth and it

“Okay.” Tony bit his tongue hard so he wouldn’t laugh out loud at Steve being so offended by
… Tony was holding Peter and trying to coax the toddler into taking another bit of medicine when Peggy knocked on the door and then let herself into the apartment with her spare key.
He sighed, rubbing at his face tiredly. “I was seventeen, Steve. It was my first real heat, I was pretty certain I had the world figured out so when some hot bodied Alpha offered to spend my heat with me, I took him up on it without considering anything else. I couldn’t even tell you his last name and honestly, his first name doesn’t matter much either.”
Tony was still staring at the usually easy going Alpha in shock when Steve came back to put an arm around his waist and ask conversationally, “So. What are we buying today?”
Tony only smiled, sated and full, mewling and trilling as they shared another dozen kisses when Steve carefully carefully put him down on the plush bath rug.
“I think those are about two of the best words I’ve ever heard.” Steve rested his chin on Tony’s head and held his mate tight while Tony cried quietly, gratefully, against him. In the doorway, Peggy watched with tears in her own eyes and Steve smiled at her before dropping a kiss into the Omega’s hair and rumbling gently to hush him. “Both those things sound real good to me, sweetheart. Thank you.”
Another rock, another shriek of excitement and this time Steve called, “Looks great, Bug! You want to keep that one? I’ll put it in my pocket!”
“Uh yeah.” Tony sniffed, rubbing at his face. “Yeah Steve’s new personal project is a study in the way my eyes look at different times of the day.”
Tony clumsily pulled him down for one kiss and then another and Steve stayed hovering at the Omega’s side until Tony wasn’t trembling anymore, until the near brittle emotion in the Omega’s dark eyes had softened to open affection.
“Pete is only one kid.” Tony pointed out a little helplessly and Steve shot him a faux offended look, “Pete’s gonna have
“Oops. Uh Tony--” he gulped. “I uh--”

“I prefer to be called a Nosy Nancy.” Clint tugged Tony in again but this time the Omega
“I love your smile.” He admitted hoarsely. “I mean
“Instead of me just being boring and too busy for you?” Tony offered with a small smile, and the Alpha was quick to croon, “I never thought that, Tony. Just figured you were playing hard to get till you had me tripping all over the place trying to spoil you, wrapped around your finger and damn near begging for kisses.”
“Well.” Bucky grinned. “Yeah, definitely that. And don’t get me wrong, we’re all real excited you unclenched enough to host one of these things, but can confirm you’re gonna regret it. Scott’s never made it through one of these things without spilling a beer so…”
“Anything you want.” he repeated. “My mate, my Omega, whatever you need.”
“All my personal stuff is in my bedroom.”
“I’m so glad.” Tony chewed at his bottom lip distractedly for a moment. “You um-- you look like you could use a shower too?”

When I was pregnant or in those bad weeks post partum when I didn’t know if me or Pete would survive, I used to imagine all the things I’d scream at my Dad or if I wasn’t imagining screaming at him, I’d imagine all the ways I’d flaunt just how fine I was without him, how many ways I could embarrass him in public or call him out for disowning me…”

“You started walkin’ down the street in the dark and my first thought was to yank you into the car so Steve wouldn’t be mad I let ya walk alone in that place.” he admitted. “In retrospect, good thing I didn’t. Adding kidnapping to breaking into your apartment…”
“Kiss me.” he whispered and Steve bit off a quiet groan as he tipped Tony’s chin up and kissed him gently, sweetly, almost

Tony’s heart caught up in his chest when he finally spotted the culprit of all the mess asleep on the couch. There was Steve stretched out on the well worn cushions, paint on his face and over his knuckles and all over his once white button up, and cuddled on his chest snoring lightly and looking as sleepily content as he’d ever been was Peter with paint in his curls, on his cheekies and all over his little fingers.

“No, don't be sorry, no need to be sorry.” Steve rumbled possessive and pleased when Tony tried to inch closer. “I was willing to wait. Just happy you’re here now.”
Tony poked and prodded at Steve’s stomach until he found a comfortable place to snooze on. “Might even be on my kink list-- asphyxiation via American Icon.”

Tony had done to the apartment and
Steve would do something about that but for now he needed to tug the satin piece away from Tony’s cock to circle his fingers around the straining length, he needed to follow the thin strap at Tony’s ass down into the cleft between the Omega’s cheeks so he could feel at Tony’s entrance.
in your chonies, now can you?”
The next morning they showered together in the small apartment bathroom, and Steve braced Tony carefully at the walls before dropping to his knees and licking around Tony’s hole, slurping and lapping and open mouth kissing until the tight rim eased and he could work his fingers into grasp at the base of the plug.

It was a long few moments of just holding each other tight, rumbling and crooning at Peter to keep the baby calm as he tried to snuggle into Tony’s heart beat, murmured reassurance and nonsensical comfort as the Omega tried to pull himself back together.

“We?” Clint cracked a smile. “What, are you and Moneybags gonna adopt me? I’ll be the little orphan Annie to your guys’s Daddy Warbucks.”
“I wasn’t sure I was even staying until just a few minutes ago.” Tony confessed. “I wore this outfit cos I thought you’d like it. You-- you don’t like it?”

Tony wet his lips and when the Alpha’s gaze dropped predictably down to watch, he wet them again because he was suddenly parched. “Yes?”
Peggy had asked that morning when he’d called to check in and ask for her help, and Tony had looked over at where Peter was happily playing on plush carpet and where Steve was headed his way with a second cup of coffee, a bite of french toast and a smile, and answered, ‘

“Is that so hard to believe?” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s hair. “I had almost fifteen years overseas, Tony. What sort of people did you think I worked with?”

I’m glad we ended up together but it could have so easily gone the other way with a different Alpha... I wish I could change that for you.”
“I don’t like you talking about my Ma and nookie in the same sentence.” The Alpha winced. “And no, I’m not going to ask. I
The praise made Tony arch up and purr and Steve braced himself over the Omega’s frame so he could yank at his zipper and push his pants down his legs. Tony felt thinner than Steve’s remembered, the Alpha’s hands seeming too large at Tony’s rib cage and the give of his stomach and
Steve’s entire body surged, muscles straining and frame tense with the effort it took to obey his Omega without
A piece of his heart that Tony didn’t realize was wound tight suddenly loosened, and the Omega leaned in to kiss Steve as hard as he could, covering Steve’s mouth and shoving his tongue past the Alpha’s lips, not letting up until Steve was stumbling again and reaching for a wall to keep himself steady.
He pressed into Tony slow, and Tony hissed through clenched teeth and clutched hard at Steve’s shoulders as he opened steady around the Alpha’s size. He tossed his head back and gasped out loud, rim burning as the Alpha sank inch by inch into his core, the wider base filling him almost painfully full, the bulk of the already swelling knot at his rear making the part of Tony that echoed
“Jesus.” Tony kept rubbing slow circles at Clint’s nape until Clint’s breathing evened out and he was practically boneless there in the booth. Then he eased off little by little so the blond wouldn’t be left a drooling, barely coherent mess stuck unable to get home after his shift. “We’ll figure it out, Clint.”
“Yes sir.” Tony blushed as he not subtly showed off his ring since the silver at his neck was covered by a scarf. “Just a few months bonded.”
“And I promise you, she’s going to love you forever for it.” the Alpha scrolled to another page. “How about this one? Close enough we could pick her up for any reason, far enough away that it’s still not over the top expensive. They don’t have nurses on staff cos it's independent living, but they have a contract with the local clinic for in home visits as needed and a connection to the hospice too.”
when a steady hand at the small of his back coaxed him up and onto his toes to meet Steve halfway in a slow, thorough kiss. The Alpha molded their mouths together with a low groan, brought Tony into his chest with nothing but the barest pressure and when the Omega
“I am, but I wanted to talk to you first.” Steve cleared his throat and shuffled his feet, folded then unfolded his arms, put his hands in his pocket then took them back out to stand in parade rest. “Uh, Tony I wanted to ask you if you uh-- if you had anything. Like what you asked me the other day. In-- in bed.”

“Give me a minute?” Tony asked instead, and a flicker of worry was there and gone in Steve’s eyes before he nodded, “Yeah Tony, just come out whenever you’re ready.”
“Does she know you regularly compare her to a dinosaur from Jurassic World?”
“Good morning.” Tony tugged at his shirt self consciously, pulling the sleeves further down his wrists and patting awkwardly at his hair when he saw the Alpha already showered, dressed and ready for the day. “Um, is there any extra--
“I just felt like your friends were… intense.” Tony allowed himself to linger weightless against Steve, letting the Alpha hold him and making no effort to step forward or back until Steve indicated a decision either way. “Do they all know how we met?”
