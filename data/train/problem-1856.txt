“John?” he tried again.
“Right, yes,” Molly snapped back into business mode. “Well it seems that both this gentleman, and your victim, were wearing the same ring on their right hand.”
“What about John?” He asked nervously.
“Well then, if that’s true, I need to leave. I won’t let him do this. He is so much better than this.
“Sherlock?” he asked quietly, as he forgot about the photo, and the knives. “Sherlock?” he whispered louder, moving carefully out of the bedroom, but not getting any reply. He heard shuffling and groaning. “Sherlock is that you?” he tried again.
, and
Sherlock smiled slightly before leaning his head forward to rest on John’s, the relief clear.
“It’s ok, John. I know you may not want to, but you can stay here. For as long as you need...if that would help.” Sherlock said as sensibly as he could. Of course he knew he would need to get John back to Rosie, but right now, he would say whatever was needed to calm him down.
“No! What’s the point in that?” Sherlock pushed away and stood up, to start pacing again.
“God, Sherlock. You know we love you too? Rosie and me? And Mary did too,” John tried to navigate what felt suddenly very awkward.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s mouth pulls into a perfect ‘o’. “John, you are a conductor of light. That’s it!”
“They’re part of a special forces team for MI6”
Mycroft pressed play and continued to watch as Sherlock spoke to the camera, pleading for his life. They both could tell he was being coerced into this. Sherlock was not one to beg for his life, ever. But whatever they had threatened must have been good enough to have him follow their prompts. Mycroft watched it twice before closing down the laptop screen and shutting his eyes. His brother was unrecognisable. His curls were matted with sweat and blood, his face bruised beyond recognition, his skin dark from grime. His breathing and his words were laboured, suggesting internal injuries, probably broken ribs, possibly a chest infection of some kind. He was far too thin. Mycroft had seen his brother at his very worst – through drugs and countless injuries and illnesses, but nothing as bad as this. This was alarming and the sense of urgency that was building in his gut made it hard for him to think straight. He prided himself on calmly being able to handle any crisis. But when it came to Sherlock, his emotions were interfering.
“You called
“I know I seemed angry before. But that’s not it,” Sherlock began.
“John, relax. They’re just chatting,” Greg said – way too casually for John’s liking – and he sat down at the table to look through his case notes.
“I don’t know why you are trying to pretend to be something you’re not Sherlock. He doesn’t see you that way.”
“Does that change of pace involve… not performing anymore?”
Slipping into his shoes, Sherlock throws open the door, almost colliding with John Watson, who apparently was about to knock.
“I’m sorry? You’re… you’re unsure?!” John’s voice had leapt a decibel level as he looked in disbelief. “Mycroft!”
do. I’ll be here another week or so… and then… we’ll be gone.” The reality of it sat in the air between them and Sherlock stopped pacing.
“There is a word for that?!” John exclaimed. “Why?”
“Are you going to skip maths too?” He asked.
“John, I can’t let you out. Not this time. This is the fourth time in two months. Twice this week. They aren’t going to just release you on bail any more, I don’t think,” Greg appealed to him, pleading almost.
was so much more exciting. Whatever this was.
Greg put down his cutlery and grabbed it, opening the message. His eyes flicked to John’s in response. “Guess what?” he asked.
“Life is full of unfulfilled wishes and dreams Sherlock and you were never a dreamer,” John said.
Thursday 5:26pm
“When can I start?” John asked, boldly ignoring Mycroft’s obvious shut-down.
“John—”
“You don’t know that,” Sherlock replied.
call me back,” he begs before hanging up and shoving the phone at Mycroft.
“He’s a good captain,” Sherlock finally said, still looking ahead and not able to bring himself to look at John.
“I’m… fine… John,” he managed to get out, between harsh breaths, in a very strained voice.
“We wear the device at all times, on our arm. It syncs with the computers here. Anderson does the calculations, inputting the latitude and longitude of a location, along with the date and the time and then—”
Sherlock is startled, despite his efforts, and looks up at John, standing still briefly, but doesn’t reply. He goes back to pacing for a moment, before finally stopping again, and the look of desperation he fires back at John to help, gives a squeeze to his heart. It’s full of heat and fear and pleading.
“She’s allergic. She couldn’t even spend a few minutes close to Susi’s favourite blanket.” He takes the scarf off with a grin, putting it back into his pocket.
John’s face darkens for a moment before he takes a breath. “Three weeks? That’s good, I suppose?” Sherlock watches him straighten in his chair. “Thanks for telling me. That helps.”
“Lean in. Jacket pocket,” Sherlock directed between heavy breaths. John did as he was told and leaned closer, to rummage in his pocket.
As they walked out of the shed and towards the carpark, talking happily together, John didn’t notice the familiar car in the parking lot, until the driver’s door opened and his father stepped out.
Sherlock’s heart dropped. He had been worried that maybe John had found him lacking in some way - it was his greatest fear. And the last couple of days had made him incredibly nervous. They had been to classes together, sat together at lunch, but something wasn’t right. There wasn’t a lot of opportunities to hold hands when John had crutches to contend with, and John had clearly been distracted. It had taken so much of his energy, to persuade himself that he was imagining things. That John wasn’t pulling away, regretting his decision to be with him. Maybe James was right - maybe he really
“Just take some time to think about it properly. I’ll be here when you’ve decided.”

“Thanks
John put his hand to Sherlock’s shoulder in support and then turned to walk out to the hall way. The mystery man was pulling himself up, using the wall for support, grunting from the pain, the blood from his wound smearing onto the wallpaper. John walked to him slowly, watching.
“Hmmm, is it?” Mycroft asked, smirking knowingly.
Of course, Sherlock never answered back. At least he knew he wasn’t
“Pfft, yeah sure. As ‘okay’ as it’s going to be when your drug-infested boyfriend gets accused of murdering some woman he apparently tried to pick up, after a night on the town,” John barked at the glass as he looked out the window, his arms crossed angrily against his chest.
this “no” phase she was going through. He took a breath, to refocus.
“It’s fine,” he shrugged it off, “I can do it.” He walked to the kitchen, avoiding eye contact.
John’s eyes flicked across to him. His shoulders were slightly hunched. He looked defeated and Sherlock didn’t know what to do. He tried to signal for him to come over, but John wouldn’t move. He didn’t smile. They walked towards the office and Sherlock’s heart started racing.
Whatever state he had been in before, there was little doubt about his state now. He was stumbling more than he had before, and instead of moving out of the club, he went straight into the middle of the crowd – right onto the dancefloor.
“Then you are aware, too, that there are only three weeks until the second leg of the tour. The U.S. is an important fan base, we can’t disappoint them.”
“Molly called me,” he finally said. His voice a low growl.
“And yet, here we are. The universe hasn’t imploded yet,” John said, crossing his arms angrily.
“Susi wasn’t taken because someone hates her. They took her because they
“He didn’t even have to be here this afternoon, John. He’s only here for you. I can’t believe you even have to stop and
“That’s right,” he said, fidgeting with the edge of the table.
John just stares, looking between them both, unable to speak.
John dug out his stethoscope from the drawer in the bedside cabinet. What he could hear as he shifted it from one lung sector to the next was nothing new. The remains of the pneumonia still lingered in rasps and crackles, but the lung situation was definitely improving, and Sherlock's breathing didn’t seem to have become more laboured. His oxygen saturation was normal, and he’d been off supplemental oxygen for a full day, now.
“Sherlock I’m here, okay. Just hang in there. We just need to get your fever back down and see where this thing’s brewing. You’re going to be okay,” John kept reassuring him.
me. That you didn’t want to be here. I was feeling guilty for keeping you here, but now… well now I know differently,” Sherlock said with a smile.
“Oh John.
“Watched some telly for a bit. Then found a fascinating book.”
“God, I wish I was good enough at maths to just skip it,” John sighed.
I didn’t get to give you back your scarf
. Just for a moment.
Sherlock yawns. It takes a moment for John to realize what the sound is and he moves back a bit to find Sherlock covering his mouth. Not having expected that reaction, John chuckles.
“No, you’re not. You’re a stubborn git.” He kisses Sherlock’s lips. “How about we find a better spot for a break? Eat our snacks. Enjoy the view.”  He cleans his hands against his trousers, then gets everything back into the backpack.
“I haven’t spoken to Mycroft Holmes since that day. Since we had an ambulance come and take his brother off to rehab. He’s not a man of many words, but he uses them well,” Greg commented.
Sherlock gets to his feet, in an attempt to brush the thoughts off, standing in the middle of the room without any purpose. Outside, the sun has already dawned. Another night without sleep.
“Your…friend…he’s away?” questioned Sherlock.
John, without turning, gulped and bit out a desperate laugh, “No, Sherlock, I’m beyond help! I think we can both see that!”
Before their marriage he and Sherlock had discussed having children, after-all John adored children and would have been happy to raise at least a half-dozen of them. But his beloved wasn't as confident. Sherlock, who John knew to be a deeply nurturing man, despite all protestations to the contrary, was as insecure and unsure of himself with children as he was with people in general and had declared that he was certain he'd make a terrible father. However, his expression had been sad when he said it and John, whose instincts where Sherlock was concerned never failed him, had sensed an underlying longing.
It was seven am when Sherlock awoke again, not peacefully as he had the previous night but this time with a violent start and audible choking gasps. John moved to the couch beside him to lay a soothing hand on his forehead, “It’s alright, relax, it’s normal; it will take a while for your nervous system to settle down after the overdose. You can expect something similar to PTSD for a short while, but it won’t last.”
John said nothing, just gave Sherlock another squeeze to encourage him.
It was then to their surprise that the child said in a clearer voice than John had heard so far, "He's not
John, hearing this, resisted the strong urge to round the pallet he was standing behind and fire a bullet through the other alpha’s head. Instead he waited for Moran to stride past him in the darkness.  Unfortunately it was better for Moran to remain alive, for now.  If John couldn’t find Sherlock immediately he’d need information − information that could be extracted from Moran… It did not cross John’s mind to follow the man, for he was certain that Moran, in the absence of other evidence, was going to the Sergeant’s quarters to see if Sherlock was there. Moran wasn’t as sure as he that the major hadn’t hidden Sherlock somewhere.
Sherlock Holmes was no quitter though and the next day, while John was sitting unassumingly on the sofa, Sherlock set his mobile down on the arm next to John and went to sit at the opposite end. Then, since it was much easier than getting up again or asking John to pass it to him, he leaned over John to grasp it. But, inexplicably, it slipped from his fingers and fell, sliding under the sofa. With the full length of his powerful body pressed against John, he reached down with a long arm to pick it up, murmuring a husky, “John,” in John’s ear as he did so. John’s eyes slid shut; he trembled and went slack under Sherlock’s weight but he said nothing. Sherlock however, at John’s reaction, experienced such a powerful urge to dominate that he had to clench his fists in the effort to force himself to back off.
John eased himself on top of Sherlock, holding Sherlock’s hands still with his own and locking their mouths together.  He offered deep, slow kisses while he gradually introduced his, by now, fully erect cock to Sherlock’s body. A touch of it against Sherlock’s side and his eyes flew open and he involuntarily winced away.
Sherlock obeyed John’s instructions and groaned, throwing back his head and sucking in air with a gasp. “John! Oh God, John, touch me, please!” His eyes flew open and he sought John’s for the first time since the bath. John, unprepared for his gaze and the bolt of blue lightning that burned through every defense he had erected, answered Sherlock’s call by gathering him close and beginning to roughly kiss his open mouth. He held and kissed Sherlock firmly, breathing in the deep groan of Sherlock’s climax and capturing his writhing body as he came.
“The bastard!” John’s exclamation was followed by a fierce growl.
John looked up at Sherlock and stroked his cheek. "Then I met you and everything changed – I caught myself dreaming again, Sherlock. I didn't do it on purpose, I didn't even want to because I thought it was impossible but I couldn't stop myself. I began having the same dream as when I was a child; the dream of a mate and children to love and nurture. The only difference was that now my mate had a face." John looked into Sherlock's eyes, a dreamy expression in his own. "Your face, Sherlock."
“No John! Please don’t. Please stay a−” Sherlock’s words were cut off by and agonized groan and the sound of gagging.
"'The child' is a Watson too Mycroft! And don't preach to me about parenting as if you know anything about it!"
Sherlock's hold tightened in distress. "John. No. I'm not mocking you. I'm sincere. Please! I just don't say things the right way sometimes, I'm sorry!"
A significant pause ensued before Sherlock said, "You've never heard of me before, have you John?"
Back on steadier ground now, dealing with a recalcitrant patient, John replied, “Well, you need to eat something anyway and so do I.  So, I’m going to go down to the kitchen for some food. Don’t attempt to rise; you will be unable to stand for at least the next ten hours or so.”
"Christ, Sherlock, it's a child!"
Finally Sherlock said, “You can come in if you want.”
“You are a liar! Tell me where his is and I won’t cut your balls off before I kill you!”
æfterfylgian – to follow after, pursue
John went rigid, his hostile expression giving way to one of horror. “Oh God. Sherlock. What you just said about Wilkes was all nonsense wasn't it? You said it deliberately, didn’t you? Just to see if I’d be jealous.” When Sherlock nodded, John loosened his grip and dropped his forehead to Sherlock’s, stricken. “I’m sorry Sherlock, I’m so sorry!” he whispered, his voice full of agonized regret, “I shouldn’t have said or done what I did just now! You must know I would never leave you! Will you forgive me? Please!”
“I …I don’t think I can, John.”
“I… I’m fine, John. Just a bit light headed…dizzy...”
"Harvey?"
Sherlock was going home to Baker Street. Once there he mounted the stairs two at a time and when he reached the landing he flung open the door of the flat. God, if anything had happened to John…he was truly frightened. But John was there, sitting on the sofa with his book. How attractive he is in the brown check shirt and the blue cardigan−the same deep-blue as his eyes−like autumn woods and quiet streams, thought Sherlock, momentarily distracted, I knew those were the right colours...
Sherlock mentally kicked himself. Was he that obvious? “John, sorry to wake you.”
“Sherlock?” he prompted quietly.
"How dare you question me in front of doctors?! You think you can make me look stupid?!"
“Yep, sure does. ‘Cause then I know you aren’t out planning to throw yourself off a roof or some daft thing.” John winked.
Sherlock’s blush deepened.
At John’s order, the sergeant smirked and dropped his catch to the floor, then, before John could prevent him, kicked the small figure across the tent.  With a gasp, the omega landed at John’s feet where it curled up and lay still.  At John’s furious exclamation, the soldier laughed and turned on his heel, departing the tent.
“Stop being nice. I can’t concentrate when you look at me like that,” John said absently as he continued looking about the room.
. So you
“What?”
Lestrade turned around to look at him. The boy opposite also looking him up and down again. Sherlock could feel John’s eyebrow crooked in question at him, even without looking. He gave Lestrade an apologetic look, which he accepted and turned back to begin the interview with all the usual procedures: introducing them all on tape; stating the time; asking the usual required ‘name, age, address, what’s your relation to the victim’ questions. He had come to make a statement. No lawyer, no circus. He had brought himself in to the station to confess. Guilt getting the better of him when his girlfriend returned home.
“You could grow a goatee and put on a dress uniform, though. Then they would probably let us in for free for one of the tours, with you as a Ludwig look-alike.” John expects a snarky remark to his stupid joke. Instead, Sherlock is on him within a second, and he gets tickled until he is crying, the other people at the church looking at them as if they are crazy. When Sherlock lets go, and John manages to catch his breath, he glances over at him. Sherlock seems to be happy, enjoying their closeness and the light-hearted fun between them.
“And I’ve always wanted to do it… for you too. I’ve always been a bit… in awe of you.” Greg’s eyes blew wide as he realised the alcohol had definitely lowered his inhibitions in a way that was not good. Mycroft said nothing in return, just stared into his glass, quietly, the silence becoming awkward, making Greg squirm. It was clearly a polite rejection. “Right, well on that note, I need to use the facilities. Back in a moment,” he said brightly, before Mycroft had to say anything.
Greg’s face dropped a little at the insult, but he couldn’t think of another retort, so he just sat awkwardly waiting, watching Sherlock read the paper, until John leapt up from the sofa.
“Goodbye John,” Mycroft tries, more forcefully, knowing full well it will rub him the wrong way.
“No. Not dumped.
John let out a loud gush of air and steadied himself on the table edge with both hands, trying to stop his head spinning, which was far from clear. So many memories, so much baggage, so much history that he had put to the side and not dealt with. And now here he was, back at Baker Street, with Sherlock Holmes. How was this real? How was this happening?
“Fine,” John agreed excitedly. “Deal.”
you again. After… all that. And then you came back. So, I am completely fine with it. With
“No, no. Please. It was—” John tries before he is interrupted.
Obviously.
“True. I think the fact they both have the same Celtic designed rings as well, though, links them a bit more, wouldn’t you say?” she looked to Greg for support.
“God I can’t take any more of this,” John let out. “Please tell me you don’t think Sherlock did both of these Greg?”
“Well it’s a key.” Sherlock doesn’t want to make this easy.
“Shut up, James. Let’s just get this done, shall we?” Sherlock snapped.
call him that,” Greg retorted under his breath.
Sally said nothing, but John could tell she was grinding her teeth beneath her closed jaw.
, he mused to himself for a moment, remembering the palace. But now he seemed peaceful and relaxed, reading something and actually humming a melody to himself. He didn’t acknowledge John though – he would have known it was John from the way he moved the key in the door already, or some such nonsense.
“We can talk about that later. Let’s go,” he said firmly, getting back in the car.
“If I am guilty, if they
“There’s no time for that now!” John moaned.
Sherlock lets go of John and walks to the table. “Yes Mycroft,” he answers with a sigh and when he turns back, John is already gone again.
His mind kept tracking back to Sherlock, to the look in Sherlock’s eyes before John was pulled back through time. Had they almost…? John was probably imagining it. Sherlock had been angry, frustrated, skeptical. Understandably so. And now John couldn’t even explain to him properly what had happened. There was no way Mycroft was letting him near the device again. Would they really look into the neighbouring business and see if the owner had caused the blast? Or had Mycroft just been humouring him?
“Oh, Sherlock, you can’t possibly! That can’t be good for you. You need to book in for some proper massages,” he chastises.
, exactly?” John demanded boldly, given it was too late to feign subservience now.
been keeping track, for as long as he could. The last known day was a Tuesday. He could see the marks on the wall, painfully etched into the stone with a fingernail – his finger, now bruised and stained with dried blood as proof that it really happened. But that had been hours, or even days ago and he had no idea now. He thought it wouldn’t matter, but it had started to mock him. The fact that he didn’t know what day it was had been like a blessing in the beginning – a relief from the constant cataloguing of days and injuries. Now it was insulting. The reality that his mind was slipping away had sent him into a more depressed state than he had ever known before. If he was going to die here, in this cell, he couldn’t bear the realisation that it was without his mind. It was slowly being lost to him.
“Yes,” John laughs. “And we wouldn’t want you having to postpone another tour. The world needs William Holmes in it.”
hurts,” he admitted, sucking in another breath and grabbing at his thigh. There was blood all around him in a pool now.
“Sherlock…” John began.
“Undoubtedly, yes. I’m only on a short hiatus. I will have to return back to it soon enough.”
“Are you at least going to let me
Jumping into a cab, he headed to the first place he could think of - Mary’s grave. Surely John would go there when Mary’s death was on his mind. His deductions were usually so accurate, that as he leapt out of the cab he expected to see the look of surprise on John’s face. But John was not there.
"Darling," John whispers, when it is all done, and those words from his lips are a weapon, weakening Sherlock’s knees. With soft tugs to his hair, Sherlock is pulled back into a kiss. "Magnificent man. You drive me mad."
,” Sherlock reassured him, and John’s eyes flicked up to get the promise from Sherlock’s.
“Sherlock. You really
“I know.” His voice was resigned. Now she understood.
make me feel alive,” Sherlock says.
“The ring? Around your neck,” he said, nodding towards her.
“God, I’m sorry,” John looked at Sherlock and the look on Sherlock’s face made John feel awful. “That’s my Dad. He’s…well there’s no excuse for him, really. I’m so sorry.”
John thought to himself. He had to admit, he had really missed hearing the brothers at each other like that. He stood there a little longer, clenching and unclenching his fists. He was nervous, to be honest. Nervous to be back, nervous to see how Sherlock was going to receive his being here. God help him, he wasn’t sure it was the right decision to have come. But how could he not?
“I’ve wanted you since that day John. I will never
be nice to Mary,” John directed sternly.
. John remembers Sherlock talking to him about that one night.
“So what now?” Greg asked, hopeful that at least one of them had a plan.
John looked over at Mycroft, with a face full of guilt and apology. He was not handling the stress well at all. The last thing Sherlock needed right now, was for the one person who was supposed to love and support him no matter what, to be crumbling, to be angry.
“John, I
They held eye contact for a moment, Sherlock deciding how much to say.
“Sorry?” Sherlock had asked, confused.
“How long’s it been?” Sherlock asked, looking down into his teacup.
“Sure.” John puts his wine glass down, a little rougher than he should, and grabs his jacket from the back of the sofa.
Mycroft was seated on stage, and Sherlock laughed under his breath. “See? He went for the dark suit,” he said quietly to John, who couldn't help giggling in response. Even from a distance, John noticed Mycroft levelling a stern look in their direction at their tardiness, and probably guessing what was amusing his brother.
“No, I just want a quiet night in, and some time to catch up with you,” he says, a little tentatively, suddenly feeling bad for imposing.
__________________________
“Brother, you need to focus on getting better. We can talk about John when we are back in London. I can assure you, that will be… handled as well. In fact, I have a call I need to make. If you’re really feeling all right, I will excuse myself and continue with my work. You should rest,” he said calmly, standing and patting Sherlock’s thigh gently.
“What the hell am I supposed to say to him now?” John said, ignoring the directive. “How is he supposed to explain this to us Greg?”
John let out a sigh. He knew. Where did that anger come from? It had surprised even himself. He was behaving like… like his
, he mused to himself.
he heard Sherlock’s voice in his head.
The lake is frozen. John tests the ice with his foot, raising a questioning eyebrow at Sherlock.
“Hang on, the last file is still loading,” Mycroft said as he waited. “Could be one of our black ops people, deep MI-6? We keep those off the main system, which is why they won’t have come up in the initial searches.”
“More urgent than
“I’m not ready to go either,” John answered.
“I believe he was given this as a means of directing him here. Didn’t you say the lady in the other club handed him something?” Anderson checked.
“Point taken.” Sherlock decided not to argue anymore. It was always better to just let him do what needed to be done, so he felt useful.
The pair had both been put on bed-rest, much to Sherlock’s frustration. Mycroft had set about being a caring older brother, which only caused Sherlock more pain. John seemed to find it amusing, to watch Sherlock suffer through his brother’s awkward attempts to be helpful. He told them he knew the petty feuding between them was almost entirely an act – something about bonding with Mycroft in the lead up to the extraction, as his evidence. Sherlock hadn’t listened after that, unwilling to accept any of it. Although apparently, Mycroft had not only been terrified for Sherlock’s safety, but also blamed himself entirely for allowing Mary access to him. It had happened on
, when you’re ready,” John said pointedly, “we can get you out on some good ones.”
“Tell me,” he managed to get out, unable to look at the pompous arse hovering in his doorway. The waft of Mycroft’s fancy aftershave, as it invaded his nostrils, only threatened to make John regurgitate his stomach contents more quickly.
“Long enough. I was happy to wait. Didn’t want to disturb.”
“John, for the moment, I hope you understand that I can’t tell you that.”
“Can’t afford London on an army pension,” John scoffed back, a little annoyed at himself for not covering the bitter sound in his voice more carefully.
Friday 7:15pm
“Well I understand. I can see it now. And that’s why I need to leave.”
“That’s better,” Mike said, as the students settled their clapping to allow him to speak. “We’d like to thank our coach, who put in the hard work to drill us and of course our awesome principal for bringing football back to the school and sticking with us through our bad years. I think it was worth it,” Mike said with excitement, to more cheers from the students. The principal blushed and swatted at the air in embarrassment. “Our scholarship recipient and star player, John Watson, who has helped us lift our playing game – even if he missed half the season. You got us there in the end Watson,” Mike turned to flash him a smile. “And Holmes here, for pushing us to improve. And to the rest of this amazing team: you guys are family. And hey boys – we did it!” he yelled, holding his medal up, and the team let out another cheer, which was taken over by the school body, which spontaneously broke out into a loud rendition of the school song followed by more cheers.
John waited for a breath – just long enough to close his eyes and picture Sherlock’s beaten body one more time. Then, he dropped his hand and ran into the cave, the team following close on his heel.
“But I am, Sherlock. I’m so terribly sorry,” John was finally starting to sound sad.
John smarts at the impertinence of this stranger. He’s only ever felt obligated to answer to his superiors in the military or when working in a hospital – where chain of command is essential. Perhaps, occasionally, he would be forthcoming to an officer with a police badge that has the right to ask him something. This man looks important, but could be anyone at this point.
“Sherlock is your brother?” John still couldn’t believe it.
,” he says diplomatically.
“I’m getting good at that, it seems,” Sherlock smiled sheepishly.
, his mouth formed the shape, but no sound came out and Sherlock panicked. “How? When? Sorry I…” John was suddenly lost for words.
“I think it’s Sherlock. Who can possibly know?” he replied, raising his eyebrows, in fear almost.
his brain unhelpfully provides.
“Wait,” Sherlock interrupted finally, his eyes still closed.
“You could say thank you,” John said coldly. “But I wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself,” he let out, instantly regretting it. The silence that followed was a clear indication that his taunt had hit hard.
“You can
“Jesus!” John yelled, simultaneously dropping the beer and leaping from his chair, tripping over it unceremoniously as he flew backwards away from the table; the beer falling, spilling liquid everywhere. A leg of the chair caught his cane and knocked that to the floor with a loud clatter as well. He managed to catch himself before falling and paused for a moment, staring at the screen in shock. The video stuttered for a moment as a giant cloud of smoke invaded the view, with flames apparent behind the dust cloud until the footage finally dropped to static. It was so bizarre to watch it happen in silence, without any sound to accompany the violence of the event. He stood for a moment, taking it in, before scrambling to wipe up the beer with his sensible oversupply of serviettes. Cursing under his breath a few times to himself, he hit the spacebar to stop the video, moving the laptop to the side, ensuring it was clear of the spilt liquid. His limp and his cane were a distant memory as he stepped away again and began pacing the living room, unable to contain the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He rubbed his hands through his hair a few times as if that would help remove the complete shockwave the footage had sent through him.
“Yeah, you go on. I’ll meet you there,” he said gently.
“No,” he said firmly in response. “I want you to stop because you’re coming off a high and you’ll regret this later. And John’s done nothing to deserve it.”
“John there’s no one there. It’s just you and me here.”
Weaving through the corridors of the theatre to find his way out, Sherlock finally pushes the stage door open frantically, looking sideways to the front of the theatre, hoping to find John.  A sudden movement catches his eye and he turns his head. He can see John’s figure walking away swiftly in the distance.
this? “Sure, I guess so. I don’t know what that’s going to achieve, but sure.”
Sherlock looked him up and down, taking in his appearance. He was scruffier than usual, definitely seemed flustered. More than just a surprising moment in a bathroom would allow for. Something was going on.
Mycroft watched him closely, not speaking, his eyes examining John’s features with a scrutiny that was suddenly uncomfortable, unnerving.
good,” he huffed, putting his arm around Sherlock.
“Sorry,” Greg said. John could tell he really meant it too. They had all been pinning their hopes on this find neatly closing off the case for them all.
“No!” she said defiantly.
“No thanks I –” John tried to say, but somehow, he knew it was not up for discussion.
him to be there. He couldn’t wrap his head around that. Given Sherlock’s many signals that seemed to confirm for John that he was an inconvenience, this was a strange turn of events. In any case, Sherlock was clearly flustered after a nightmare, and on copious amounts of medication. His cheeks had even looked a bit flushed earlier, but John was tempted to brush it off as the result of anything but his proximity.
John forces himself to stop, forces his fist open. It would be so easy, just to go to London with him, to leave this behind and become a functioning part of society again. Find a flat, find a job, find a therapist. It’s only rational. And he would have to wait for Sherlock there, too. Wait for him to get home from his tours. Alone. At least, here in the mountains, he feels safe. London – the place he thought he could never leave for long – has become a threat in his mind, loud and busy and grey. Beautiful, but intimidating. John is not ready. He knows that Sherlock
Sherlock paused to reflect. “Or perhaps Mike−” he began.
As he entered the bedroom John, who had been sitting on the side of the bed, rose with a smile to greet him, turned white and fainted, banging his head on the nightstand as he fell to the floor.
The expression of fascination was returning to Sherlock’s face, “You are large and strong Ælfric, and yet soft in your ways.”
"But that's not so John, in fact −" Sherlock paused but before he could begin again, John interrupted.
“John!”
“I’m sorry, Liz! I really am! We’ll go out. To the pub! Liz, wait!” John rose to follow her but his pleadings were punctuated only by a vigorous slamming of the door and the rapid tread of footsteps going down the stairs.
“If you object leifling, please do so now.” John’s expression was sober. “But before you answer me, know this; if you do not want as I do, of course you have the freedom to go anywhere you wish to; I will escort you to wherever that may be, to ensure your safety, ic ámundae þē, if you will allow me to do so.”
The night wore on into day and then day into another night. Sherlock remained at the hospital for he was unable to proceed with his investigation without speaking to John; let the police think what they might, he knew this case was at a standstill until he could interview John. And he was not about to risk someone else getting to John first, so he stayed. He was counting on the doctors allowing him access to John when he was well enough to speak; his chances were good for there were no family and friends who could object.
Where was Sherlock? Suddenly, John wanted to see him, to touch him, if Sherlock would let him. He was anxious to tell Sherlock that he loved him too, just as much as Sherlock loved him and for just as long…
He was reaching out with a soothing hand to a matted tangle of dark curls when a second soldier lurched through his tent door. At a glance John could see the Alpha was grossly sexually aroused, drunk with it, eyelids half lowered over unfocused eyes, his mouth slack and his hands restlessly grasping at his crotch.
The corners of John’s eyes crinkled, he said, “Sometimes not, but always with you, heartsweet, always.” He reached to draw Sherlock’s quilted bag snugly around him to ward off the chill of the night and asked, “You are wide awake again, Ælfscíene?”
When he did, Sherlock’s voice was low and husky in his ear. “But John, I’ve already thought about all of those things. I do love you and trust you unreservedly, I thought you knew that.” He was staring at John, puzzled and added almost to himself. “I thought it was obvious, so obvious…and that you had recognized it as I did…”
He swung around to lock the door before kneeling beside the tub. The injured omega had gone limp again, eyes closed, his blood and dirt-streaked cheek pale against the dark khaki of John's T-shirt. John pressed a hasty finger to the pulse at his neck but to his relief he found it improved; steadier and slower than it had been earlier.
“John, please look at me.” John didn’t move, so Sherlock very slowly reached out a hand to his. “John, please.”
Still feeling tired, he selected a book from the bookshelf and carried his tea to the sofa. He sat with the book unopened on his lap however, thinking back to the night and wondering at the extraordinary compassion Sherlock had shown him in the wake of his nightmare. His thoughts were wistful. What an amazing man his host was! He had never met an Alpha like Sherlock. How fortunate the Omega that Sherlock finally chose as a mate would be…John had no doubt he or she would be fiercely protected and loved with a tender passion. He only hoped that Sherlock would be loved equally in return; he might be commanding and every inch a fearless Alpha but he had vulnerabilities too; John had seen them and he suddenly wished very much for Sherlock to be nurtured and protected by a caring mate in return. Sherlock deserved that above all else. John knew his own chances for love were over but he very much wished lasting happiness and fulfillment for Sherlock.
But Sherlock, confused, was uncomforted.  He continued to tremble and whimper, frightened beyond all reason.
It was more of a struggle for John than he had thought it would be, to hide his almost over-powering desire for Sherlock. But he had managed it. Sherlock himself had been quietly agreeable and had not brought up the subject of their relationship since the discussion in the kitchen two weeks previously−although John had caught Sherlock looking at him speculatively several times. This however, he put down to Sherlock simply adjusting to Alpha/Omega interpersonal dynamics, which were new to him.
"Listen to me carefully, John." Sherlock purposefully sought John's eyes for confirmation. "First, it is not kindness, nor is it pity that I feel toward you and I certainly do not feel the least bit noble right now. Second, you are not leaving Baker Street. You are not going anywhere. You can move out of your room if you want to, but to nowhere other than my bed and third, you will need to start getting used to the idea that I think of you in that way, John Watson." And with that, apparently the time for listening was over because Sherlock's mouth came down on John's in a plundering kiss that drove thoughts of any sort from John's mind; but his body seemed to know what to do, even if he didn't, and he found himself melting into Sherlock with another blissful moan, wrapping his legs around Sherlock and clinging to him tightly.
They rested against each other for a long moment, savouring the loving intimacy of this first experience as a couple.  Then John stirred.  He could feel Sherlock against his lower back, hard and throbbing so he turned in Sherlock’s arms and raised his face.  “Your turn?” he questioned, his hands caressing Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock moved to the living room to take up his violin. He began to play softly while watching a peach and rose-pink sunrise steal over the city. He had always had the sense that there was something more for him in the universe than his work, but he hadn’t known where to look for it and so had given up hope of ever attaining it. He knew now it was love that he had been seeking, of course. And love had unexpectedly revealed itself in John and the intense joy of caring for, protecting and nurturing another. John was the difference between a world of dull grey and a world of flowing colour. And now Sherlock had had a glimpse of colour he would always yearn for it. Yearn for John.
"A what?" Sherlock asked.
Still holding the boy with one arm, John examined his body for open wounds, he had done so quickly before but wanted to be certain he had none other than a small cut above one delicately arched eyebrow; infection from an uncleansed wound, even a small one, could kill him in his present condition. Also, John had done a cursory physical examination of the omega for evidence of a sexual assault earlier, he had found none but he wanted to do a further check to reassure himself that the soldiers who had captured the boy hadn't abused him in that manner.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” John sounded anxious.
Sherlock nodded reluctantly.  “And I do not know why I need you.  I should not.” He sounded miserably confused.
“Yes, yes,” John soothed, “It’s alright. Calm down. Martha will be alright.”
John said nothing further and Blackburn remained silent as John put the vehicle into gear and drove ahead into the cold darkness of a rainy London night.
At least Lestrade was; he gave a sharp exclamation of surprise as he was grappled from behind and John could hear scuffling as the combatants sought for solid purchase on the church's marble floor. John heard grunts of exertion from the figures and he strained to see into the darkness. At last he was able to make out the outline of Lestrade struggling to loosen the choke-hold that his assailant had around his neck. As John focused, he saw Lestrade succeed in breaking his attacker's grip and draw his weapon from his holster to defend himself. As bad luck would have it though, his assailant, flailing in rage and panic, knocked the gun from his hand and it fell to the floor with a clatter.
John thought about it.  It wasn’t too late.  There was still time to salvage the job.
The next several days proceeded in a similar fashion to the first. John slept a great deal during the day as well as at night and showed no interest in descending the stairs. Sherlock heard his quiet movements between the loo and bedroom; the doctors had been confident that he could manage his own care during his recovery so Sherlock didn't interfere with his privacy in that regard. He checked on him regularly though, taking him cups of tea and water between meals. Other than politely thanking him, John said nothing.
Both Lestrade and his attacker dived to retrieve the gun. The two landed on it at the same time and in the ensuing struggle, the gun discharged with an echoing crack and Lestrade gave a sickening gasp as he was struck in the arm by the bullet. He fought on though, continuing to try to subdue the suspect.
The silence dragged out as John waited.

John drew a gulping gasp of air and squeezed his eyes shut as if to block out the memory. "I felt him, Sherlock, I felt Geoffrey!"
Again, quietly, “What?”
The outcome of his assessment was no less alarming than his previous examination. In addition to his persistent cough, Blackburn was short of breath and his heart beat irregular. He was muttering incoherently and appeared to be hallucinating. The man needed immediate care. There was no help for it, John would have to leave Blackburn alone for a minute or two and make a dash back to the car to collect his medical bag and duffle.
"John, please reconsider." Sherlock's voice was urgent. "You may know more than you realize that could help to solve these crimes. I think you do and if I think so, there is a murderer out there who may think so as well. That puts you in danger John."
John blotted Sherlock’s skin dry with a towel and fashioned, out of a small single sheet, an approximation of the robe Sherlock had been wearing when he was first captured and brought to John’s quarters.  He draped it Grecian style around Sherlock, marveling again at his youthful beauty as he did so.  Sherlock’s hair was forming a halo of loose curls around his head as it dried and his skin, hydrated once more, had regained its pearl-like sheen.  John found it impossible to resist touching him as he dressed him; Sherlock’s silken skin and soft locks were in such sharp contrast to John’s own weathered complexion and serviceable haircut.
Opening the folder John began to study the black and white photos it contained. Other than a one page profile of Blackburn, the only other content of the folder was a secured USB flash drive which John knew would contain the detailed information he would need to apprehend the subject.
His anger spent, John's eyes were filling with treacherous tears and he turned and bolted up the stairs to his room. Sherlock stared after him but did not move to follow. John had stubborn pride. He might be regretting his outburst, not that he should do, for he was right and it was useful for Sherlock to hear what he had said. Nevertheless, it was clear that John would rather be alone for a while.
John turned to Sherlock.  “Alright?” he asked with concern.  “Yes,” said Sherlock and then grinned weakly, “Quite alright, actually.”
Sherlock, in the midst of arching his neck to meet John’s lips, nodded quickly.
“That’s not what I…” Whatever he’d been going to say was lost as a blinding light lit up the night around them and the unmistakable hissing whine of a jet turbo engine could be heard from above, “Bloody hell, a helicopter now!?" John exclaimed, "What the…? Is the whole bloody country after us?”
To his astonishment, Sherlock struck back at him just as furiously, “I saved you from a diseased whore, John! And you know it! And what’s more I don’t want you bringing any more of her type around here again! She stinks, and I don’t want her or anyone like her contaminating our home!”
Sherlock nodded once in confirmation.
Sherlock was sincere in his declaration to John. He meant what he had said whole-heartedly; relieved, in fact, that John trusted him enough to stay. Having said that…something was not adding-up. Not that Sherlock was an expert on sex, by any stretch of the imagination, but he was sure that John was physically responsive to him…he thought back to their first kiss in the church and smiled. Yes, John had definitely been sexually aroused then. So Sherlock resolved to give the matter serious thought.
Sherlock was surprised at his reaction, although he supposed upon reflection that he shouldn't have been. No matter what his character, Harvey had been John's husband and John was an impossibly loving man… "John, I'm sorry. I didn't think. Of course you're upset. He was your husband…"
“No! I don’t want that, John! I want, I want… you! Not safety, not security, not… not… this! I want you; us, John!”
“I see.  What would you change, Sherlock? And why? Will you tell me?”
By mid-morning John, looking pale and tired once more, returned upstairs. Sherlock took him a cup of tea in the early afternoon and found him soundly sleeping atop the bed. He didn't stir when Sherlock pulled the duvet up around his shoulders so Sherlock set the tea on the nightstand and quietly left.
He saw Sherlock almost shiver in delight at his order. He chuckled and began to push Sherlock gently down the hall and into the bedroom where he followed and closed the door behind them.
He rounded a corner between two unused portables and saw ahead, as he’d guessed there might be, a large bunker, some distance away, backed by the barbed wire fence that encircled the base.  It was on the other side of a broad expanse of dry grass which might once have served as an air strip. John paused only for a second before deciding to sprint over it.  It was unlikely that Moran would suspect that John would follow them so quickly, if at all.  He would assume John was on medical duty likely for several hours at least.
John opened his eyes wide in amusement.  “Oh…?”
Sherlock still would not look at him but started to rise from the bath tub so John helped him out. He wrapped him in towels, forcing away thoughts of what Sherlock’s clean, warm skin might feel like under his own eager hands…what Sherlock would taste like on his tongue... Dear Lord, how he wanted to find out! He could smell and almost taste Sherlock's hot scent, he was so close. It would be so easy to close the small distance between them and have what was his. Sherlock would not protest if John were to bend him over his bed now and take him; in his present state he’d welcome John in. John wouldn’t be rough, of course, but he would make sure that no one, especially Sherlock, would ever be able to question who Sherlock belonged to. God, John was a fool to be so noble!
“There, there…calm down please. I’m not going to harm you.”  John urged Blackburn to settle again with soothing hands.
John’s eyes filled and he hugged Sherlock close. He whispered down to him, “It’s alright, sweetheart. This is very difficult for you, I know. And I love you too; more than anything, Sherlock.”
“C’mon sweetheart, let’s get you upstairs where I can check your injuries and patch you up if you need it, alright?”
John patted the sofa beside him. “C’mere Sherlock. Sit beside me. Bring your book and we’ll just sit together. It makes me happy when you’re near me.”
Silence. If possible the form shrank even more.
Sherlock’s health was excellent, he had healed quickly and appeared to have adapted well to the physical changes in his body. In fact, as a now mature Omega, he was magnificent with his glossy curls, glowing skin and lithe body. Just looking at him made John start to shake with desire. John was so affected by his nearness that he had to be constantly vigilant to keep his distance for fear of saying or doing something that would ruin his efforts to respect Sherlock’s space. But given the obvious improvements in Sherlock’s wellbeing, John considered the effort worthwhile.
"I’d like to shower John, before.”
Aloud all he said was, "Alright, but you must take it easy, your balance will come and go without warning over the next several days and you risk a serious fall if you aren’t careful, alright?”
“What is it?” he asked, his voice thick, “What do you need Sherlock?”
Blackburn turned his face and raised a mocking eyebrow at John. “Your concern for my health is touching. Truly it is.” There was an unflattering emphasis on the last phrase.
Now however, contrary to anyone’s knowledge, it was clear that there had been at least one survivor of the terrible event…
John did not let go of him, but sank back on his heels. He said in wonderment, "You are Simarine."
As he did so he heard a sharp exclamation from Molly who was staring at John.
(See the end of the chapter for
Although seconds were critical, John took the time to arm himself with more than his pistol before he set out after his targets.  Once he had prepared himself for a full fight, should it come to that, he emerged from his tent into what was still an early morning although daylight was increasing rapidly.
“Molly just called, John.”
Sherlock remained silent.  John sensed an inner battle occurring, he could feel the tension in Sherlock’s body.
The boy slowed as he drew near the unresponsive Sherlock, not as certain of himself as he had been a moment earlier. He stopped, and suddenly, before John could say anything, his small face crumpled and he sobbed, "They were right! Batman doesn't like 'chickens' and he doesn't like me!"
“If you would like to use a condom we will, of course. But my tests are up-to-date, Sherlock, so we don’t need to.  I’m alright either way.” He stroked Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock may actually have heard John's silent order for once because after several seconds of what appeared to be deep thought, during which time he bent his free arm to study his cuticles in apparent absorption, he fixed a cold stare somewhere in the middle-distance over Doris's left shoulder and said in a deceptively expressionless tone, "No. I won’t."
“Well, I don’t think you need any first-aid, so why don’t I help you to your bed? Being in heat is nothing shameful, in fact, you are very, very beautiful right now, Sherlock but I understand that it’s upsetting you. Your bed room is private and I think you’ll feel more comfortable there. I’ll get you the cold cloths.”
Sherlock opened the door of John's room and entered. It was quiet and dark apart from the indicator lights on the medical equipment monitoring John's vital signs. But there was enough light coming from the city through the open blinds for Sherlock to make out John's still form lying on his side facing the window.
Later when they were cuddling under their duvet, John tracing the outline of one of Sherlock's well-defined pectoral muscles and Sherlock stroking the soft rounding of John's belly, John spoke. "Sherlock, I want to confide something in you."
John ventured tentatively, "Then Sherlock, my boots have better grip  than your shoes, perhaps I should carry December…"
He hated to break the spell, but to ease Sherlock’s self-consciousness, John said, “I think your soup is ready.  Would you eat some now?”
The bath was accomplished with minimum awkwardness on John’s part, with no help from Sherlock, it should be said, who seemed not to have a modest bone in his body; dropping his trousers and pants where he stood and stretching languidly as John tried to steer him toward the bath tub.
Mycroft smirked again. “As much as I’d like to stay, and see how
“I’m just looking at some… other options.”
John couldn’t help the light laugh that came out, but once Mycroft had left the room, his smile dropped and the two of them were left in silence again. A thick silence that filled the room, swallowing up every thought John tried to form. The only sound was the faint hum from the monitors surrounding Sherlock’s bed and the faint hiss from the regular oxygen cannula in his nostrils.
“It’s too dangerous,” Donovan replied.
“Who are you?” John demanded, his eyes steely and cold.
“Inconclusive,” Lestrade added, his eyes raking over John, waiting for the next question. While Sherlock was the genius, and always saw what others didn’t, there was something about the way John processed a scene that Greg seemed to respect. John had a quieter, more focussed and considered approach.
“You and James have a good night,” John interrupted. He couldn’t resist the barb. He knew it was childish. He had no right to treat Sherlock like this. They weren’t a couple. Sherlock had done nothing wrong. But his pride had been hurt. His fantasy had been ruined a little tonight. “Thanks for letting me know, though.”
“I’m okay. I’ll be okay. I’m worried about
“You…you’re…” Sherlock couldn’t even finish his own sentence, but John knew what he was asking.
“Yes, I heard,” Mycroft replied, eyes pointing towards the stairs to indicate he had been sitting long enough to hear the nightmare for himself. “Nice that you found time for a nap. Need I remind you, the fate of my brother is resting in your hands right now, Dr Watson?” he added, without making eye contact, the accusation a little insensitive even for Mycroft’s taste.
“… I don’t come all the time, I’m with the agency. But Mycroft wanted someone to help for a few days. Given he’s relapsed with the drugs, and seems to be struggling right now, he thought… well while John’s focussing on investigating with you…” she trailed off, looking towards John nervously.
Sherlock returns his eyes to the nail, without a word, and gently taps the hammer.
Sherlock stood there looking at John, his heart hurting. No wonder John had stayed away from school looking like that.
“You’re my friend. Of course I care,” John says, reaching out to intertwine their fingers in the middle of the table. “I do actually
Mycroft glanced him over. “I suspect it won’t be a problem.” He liked John’s no nonsense attitude and how completely unfazed he seemed.
Maybe a book then. He could light a fire, snuggle up under a blanket, then take a walk later, to pick up the car at the Wirtshaus. It makes it easier, now that he can borrow the car from an elderly neighbour on a regular basis, helping out with his shopping in return. He’s been here almost a year now, and despite his initial misgivings, he’s already integrated into the community a bit. Yes, he’s still more of a loner, enjoying the quiet, working a lot, but they seem to have accepted him as part of the village now. People stop by his house for a chat sometimes or wave at him from across the street. John feels almost at home here, more than he had in London when he came back after the war. Here, things are better now. He’s found a routine, found a purpose. He doesn’t allow himself to think about what – or who – he misses, how life isn’t as exciting right now, instead distracting himself by cleaning his mug and placing it back on the counter.
Sherlock’s pardon had been approved with no issues, and they had finally been able to let people know that he was back at Baker Street. Greg had hugged him too hard and caused a small panic when Sherlock couldn’t get his breath back. Admittedly, their relationship had hit a small hiccup when Molly’s acting skills had not been up to the task of pretending to be surprised. The fact that she had been in on everything, as Sherlock’s medical expert, instead of John, had upset him for a couple of days. But Sherlock and Molly had both managed to bring him back around.
“Back off, Mycroft,” John spat angrily from the kitchen, relieved when Mycroft listened and actually shut his mouth.
“Well there is that,” John smiled at them both, grateful to have friends in that moment.
“John… I’m sorry.”
“Are they a special design? The rings? Or can they be picked up from any old jeweller? I mean, he was shot point blank and she was stabbed. Surely we need something stronger? To link them?” John asked, starting to pace back and forth, the adrenaline finally too much for him. “Do you have the weapon here?”
“I’ll wait till Sherlock
“Oh, it’s not Catholic. In the Pagan religion, the Celtic Cross symbolizes the four directions – the elements, the meeting place for all energies. Like representing the four directions of the earth – north, south, east, and west? Or four elements – Earth, fire, water and air.”
“You’re really… you… you’re…” Sherlock swallowed hard.
The doctor in him needed to turn his emotions off, flick that switch, and focus on Sherlock first. Sherlock was in no state to bear the brunt of John’s anger right now. He needed care and attention, and time to rest and heal. John knew he could keep his emotions out of it; doctors were well trained in that skill. He would treat Sherlock like a patient,
He always knew that James was willing to exchange a quick fix of one kind for another. And Sherlock needed his fix, or he couldn’t concentrate. He could stop at any point, but a part of him had only survived school this long because of this, so he wasn’t ready to test the theory of what stopping would be like.
“I only wanted to check…I made soup, so I’m just dropping some off, before I go out…to make sure you’ll eat something.” She said it so tenderly. She always looked after him.
“Oh right,” he said, intrigued. “Have you done it? Time jumping?” he asked.
“They’re okay. I feel guilty sitting here watching,” John admitted, looking very serious.
“It’s fine Sherlock. If I can patch someone up on a battle field, I can look at your little cut with a hangover,” John scolded him with a click of his tongue.
“I don’t know, you have some twisted ideas! Maybe it was fun for you,” John said, crossing his arms stubbornly.
He replied with an eyeroll of impatience. “Just trying to be efficient.”
But no. She gave him a sad look, unable to think of anything useful to say.
I know that. You might think I’m an idiot but I’m not – not where he’s concerned. Not anymore. Sherlock could never—”
Sherlock stopped and grabbed at John’s arm to stop him walking further.
“Consider it done,” Mycroft replies, the façade of his manager role firmly back in his tone as he hangs up the call. He never stays on long enough for brotherly affections or interactions.
With that, John Watson makes a movement forward, and then disappears into the depths, coming up just where Sherlock is swimming. His hair is all slicked back when he resurfaces, and Sherlock reaches out his hand to brush his palm along the shape of John’s scalp, as his legs kick to keep him afloat.
Before Sherlock could say anything, Rosie cried restlessly in the monitor.
“You knew he was never going to take it well.”
“A debt-collector?” Greg asked, confused.
Sherlock was frustrated that his attempts to make conversation were falling flat. “
. You said you would trust my judgement… no he’s resting now… he can’t talk now… actually, he’s been sleeping for…” John looked at the clock and realised Sherlock was having a nap of epic proportions.
“Sorry,” John said with a forced smile.
“Surely if you can go back in time, you would just get everyone out of there before the explosion? At least, that would seem the easiest route,” John argued.
“Hmmm? Oh, nothing important,” John said vaguely, moving to his corresponding chair. “Do you have any idea who did this, Sherlock?”
,” he leered, opening the door and walking out to the basins.
play without you. They will be fine. Besides, they have me now.”
. Go away!” He dismissed Sherlock cruelly, closing the screen door.
“Uh…yeah, it’s not the ideal,” John said awkwardly, fishing some food out of his bag to stop his stomach from embarrassing him with an unnecessary loud growl.
Without warning, or response, Sherlock changed from the stoic composed statue, to something sinister. He let out something resembling an animal growl as his face changed and he leapt across the table, clawing at the young man.
John’s eyes widened and he tried not to look around at everyone who was staring right at him.
,” he said quietly, his brow furrowed, sucking in a few breaths before continuing. “I lost John… when I jumped. I know I did. He… is never… going to forgive me. You will just… have to do, Imaginary John,” he managed to get out before moaning.
“We have enough background information. It’s time to act,” Donovan explained.
“He looked unstable already. Don’t you think he looked unstable already?” John asked, hopefully.
“Well he’s under the impression that
“It was found on him?” Molly sounded disappointed. John understood that emotion – the desire to have the weapon as far away from Sherlock as possible. It was never good when they could tie the weapon directly to someone, even if it was planted.
He didn’t know how long he read for, but at some point, he must have dozed off in the chair, as he wakes again yelling out, tossing the book unceremoniously from his lap across the room in fright. He sits for a moment, sucking in fast breaths, trying to steady himself. Taking in the unfamiliar surroundings, completely confused, he slowly remembers that he is in the cottage in Germany: the memories of his nightmares already slipping away like tendrils of smoke, unable to be grasped. He stands up slowly and his knee buckles under him for a moment, so he leans against the edge of the sturdy armchair, crying out in shock. The embers from the fireplace are still glowing and the lamp beside his chair is still on but glancing at the clock he knows it’s the early hours of the morning – far too early to be awake. He gives his back a bit of a twist and stretch. The armchair is actually more comfortable than he expected it to be, but he decides it’s best to head to bed and sleep properly. His night terrors have not subsided, and while he had hoped the new surroundings might interrupt them, it seems the change of scenery has only made them more present. He picks up the book and turns out the light, before heading to the bedroom to try and get some more sleep.
“A wreath.” Sherlock blurted. “People like having wreaths around the holidays, don’t they?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled on his shirt, silently willing his erection away. “Yes, John, ok.”
John wanted answers, and Sherlock could understand that. He had spent hours poring over his mind palace, mentally flipping over chairs and tables to find the fragments of what had actually led him to be in this situation. He didn’t like not knowing how all the pieces fit together either. It was unsettling, to say the least.
All Sherlock can manage in response, is to kiss him, and John, for another night, is allowed to forget. To just feel, to love.
. Carefully.
“Siings!” she cried out.
“What do you want, Mycroft?” Sherlock exclaims in loud frustration. “I just left you!”
John stared at the screen for a moment, his brow furrowed in confusion and mistrust before responding:
“John…” Greg sympathised. He felt bad for John and how much he was clearly suffering.
“I was hoping after… after
“Sherlock, I can’t stay out here… I have to get back into class. You should be coming in too. You were doing so well at it before. Come in and just…”
Sherlock didn’t push any further. He just bent a bit and put his head on John’s shoulder, snuggling against him for the rest of the trip, their fingers intertwined and gripping on. And just for a moment, Sherlock pretended that nothing was wrong, that there wasn’t a dark cloud hanging over their heads. The stopwatch keeping time, counting down the days, the hours, before it would all be over.
oblivious aren’t you?” John teased. “Everyone has been assuming we were a couple since the day we met – your brother included! I’ve clearly favoured
“Right,” John replied.
Sherlock reached the skip finally and glanced in before putting his hands on the edge, bending his knees and leaping agilely over the edge to the inside.
“Yes, take it outside you two. Make it quick, Watson,” the teacher said, as he turned back to the board, frantically glancing between his textbook in hand and the board, to correct the equation Sherlock had pointed out while this distraction kept the class amused, and unaware.
“Well, you promised him,” John argued.
“Why don’t you just keep your nose out of my business?
Their relationship was unique. Best friends who lived and breathed for each other and had been in exciting, life threatening situations together. Sherlock had been surprised how happily John had followed him into the fire, time and time again. He had been steadfast and loyal. He put up with every bad mood and messy experiment and Sherlock’s blunt cruel jibes. He had always expected John to leave at some point but somehow, despite everything, John had not. Sherlock had constantly felt guilty about letting John believe he was dead for so long. But even then, John had forgiven him and come back to their friendship, albeit with Mary in tow then.
“Sorry,” Sherlock replied again.
you. I
Sherlock didn’t know what to say, so they both sat silently for a moment, looking at the players on the field, not making eye contact. Sherlock needed to think for a minute. He could feel the frustrated heat rising off John for every minute he waited.
Sherlock knows that Mycroft is worried, with good reason. Sherlock has never done relationships. Neither of them have. His career has been their entire single focus for years. This is a new problem they are both going to have to face.
like that or had any interest in that.
me I do. This is my fault. I should never have started something. I
“What?”
“Yes well, never mind about that,” John interrupts awkwardly, putting his glass down and starting on the stew. “I’m sure you would have found your way eventually.”
“Someone has been tampering with his medication, Mycroft. I don’t know if he’s doing it to himself somehow, or if it’s been tampered with at the hospital or en route
half-read on the side table. For a moment, he feels the need to hug his brother, although it’s something they never do. The relief courses through his veins, the adrenaline making his fingertips tingle with the shock.
“John, I don’t know if I can do it,” Sherlock confessed.
“That would be great, thanks,” Greg accepted, hiding a slight smirk that was not lost on John, who was now watching them both a little closer too. But Sherlock had faded into the distance, staring blankly, looking very peaked. John was worried.
“Sherlock? I don’t even understand how…” Lestrade was trying to get his head to process what he was seeing.
“Oh! Nur wenn es kein Problem ist?” he replies tentatively, hoping he has phrased his reply correctly. His accent still leaves a lot to be desired.
. I just have a lot going on at the moment. It’s really complicated, I don’t want to get into it. I’m just trying to get settled first. It’s not that I haven’t thought about it. Because I
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It will be fine.” John was not going to discuss it.
“Thank you,” Mycroft says quietly, his face open and shocked at John’s understanding of the situation.
“Oh, I’ll check that for you. Be a love, get those jams up there for me, I’ll be right back.” She scutters away, and Sherlock finds himself sorting raspberry jam into the highest shelf until she returns with a small parcel.
a problem.”
“Oh I have no doubt about that. Meanwhile, I forgot all about the sunscreen, because you started complaining right after I suggested this hike.” John rummages through their stuff and finds the tube, applying some to his fingers. “I’m afraid I can’t help your nose, much. It’s already burned a bit.” Carefully, John spreads the liquid over Sherlock’s pale skin: the back of his neck to the line of his eyebrows, happy to find freckles around the other man’s eyes.
“No.” Sherlock was genuinely surprised that he and Molly had that in common. “Not at all. In fact, I completely agree.” He gave her a half smile, in appreciation for their shared understanding. For a moment he took Molly in. Her pony tail dripping down her back, which was so neatly created and yet, she always had fly-away hairs around her face.
"Dehydration and malnutrition alone shouldn't push it this far. If it could, then it should have happened before. You've done this for years, haven't you, stopped eating and drinking when you're working? I hate to ask you again, but have you—"
“You coming back home with us?” John asked, not taking it.
Sherlock was more frustrated, clearly, than even John had anticipated. He listened via the monitor as Sherlock entered the room. Rosie wasn’t really awake, she sniffed and cooed a little bit, confused by the noise that woke her.
“Right so…” John waited for him to explain.
“Why would he think I don’t—”
John turned his head and stared at Sherlock with lost searching eyes and Sherlock gently pried his fingers off the box, maintaining their eye contact as he did it. John let out a heavy sigh which ended in a choked sob and he put his hand over his face. Only the shaking of his shoulders betrayed that he was beginning to cry.
“Yes… that,” Sherlock said, annoyed, trying to shake his head but lacking the strength. “Stop it. You’re not… really here. John would never… really…”
“I… sorry… I… uh…” John can’t make words form into sentences and he blushes at how incoherent he is, before realising his arm is still raised in what could look like an attack. He clears his throat, bringing his arm back down to his side.
“Hey, hey,” John got up from his chair. “What are you doing up?” he scolded. “You should have shouted out. I’m happy to bring you anything. You shouldn’t be using those crutches so much yet.” John walked up to Sherlock, giving him a peck on the lips without even thinking about it.
Sherlock gave him a brief lift of his lips, the edge of a smile, the recognition of the old familiar. The pure effort of the gesture seemed to take a toll on him and his face dropped again.
Lestrade had come through; the evidence he had sent over had been very useful. A garbage bag found in the other skip contained a small pink jacket, covered in blood; a rainbow scarf, also covered in blood; and a large collection of what appeared to be landscaping bark of some kind, also clumped together with dried blood. All matching the little girl. It hadn’t taken Sherlock long to pinpoint the probability of what had happened. He didn’t understand
The kiss remains slow and tender, as they learn the shape and feel of each other, hands never still, exploring, pulling closer. John feels exhausted, after being woken up in the middle of the night, subjected to so many emotions, but this is heaven and John wouldn’t give it up for any amount of sleep.
“We’re looking into it thoroughly before we report anything. Mycroft is even helping.” John’s voice sounded sturdy, confident. It gave Sherlock a small moment of relief. Maybe it wasn’t over just yet.
“Not for long. I’m coming to you instead. It seems only fair. I imagine you were mighty pissed off when you thought you were joining me and I wasn’t there,” Sherlock chuckled to himself at the image of a cranky John realising his mistake. If there even was an afterlife. Not that he believed in that. The joke falling flat into the empty apartment. But he couldn’t stay here, not when John was gone. Not when he had been the cause.
“Well John, don’t worry,” she continued to reassure him. “He has been through a traumatic couple of years. It’s going to take him a while to get back to normal.”
in fact. Oh didn’t you know? I had dinner with him on Friday. He’s actually here at the school today. I could give him a quick call…” he offered, pulling his phone awkwardly out of his pocket in threat. “I believe he already knows all about you, James. Isn’t that right? And he was very interested to hear you were back. I understand that he had already warned you what would happen if you ever set foot near his brother again... and I have to tell you, he’s not happy about
“Talk us through it,” Mycroft continued, not acknowledging the embarrassment. His focus was solely on Sherlock now, “the case you had been working on, I mean.”
“He got me a record deal, supported me on my first world tour. After that, there was no other option than to keep doing this, to make my passion my career.”
? Do you manage all his dates too?” John asks, the words coming out more angrily than he intends them to.
John couldn’t resist any longer and slid down onto the bed properly. Sherlock put his arms around John’s waist, pulling him closer. Their lips knew how to find each other, and they wasted no time. It had become like torture having to say goodbye in the afternoons and waiting until the next morning to be near each other again. Every opportunity they had to be close like this, was important to them both. Sherlock had gone from a virtual recluse to an overly affectionate puppy – ready for any attention he could get, and constantly glued to John’s side. He was even attending all the maths classes now just to have more time together.
“Wait, Mycroft knew?” John leapt on that information.
“Yes, thanks. I reckon another week, maybe two and I’ll be back on field with you all. Couldn’t come soon enough either,” John said, slapping Mike on the shoulder.
“Writing?” Sherlock smiles, watching John’s nervous behaviour. “What about?”
“Yes, why?” Sherlock replied. He sounded a bit nervous, if that was possible. It gave John a moment’s pause.
Sherlock heard John let out a loud sigh from the kitchen, and his heart sank with guilt. John didn’t want to be here, that was clear enough. And Sherlock certainly didn’t want John, after everything he had been through, to also be responsible for his recovery now. He didn’t deserve to have to carry that burden on top of the old wounds from their forced separation. Sherlock would have a lot to make up for, without adding this to his side of the ledger. But he didn’t want to say as much to Mycroft with John standing there, so he had stayed silent. It didn’t help that Sherlock was feeling particularly prickly already – what with the pain and the frustration of having to just lie here, useless. His mind was in a bad place to begin with. He realised he would have to try to temper his behaviour a bit if he was going to get through this and have any hope of making amends with John.
John hugged him and nuzzled his neck in comfort, “But you have me now, Ælfscíene, and so you are safe.” He stroked Sherlock’s smooth cheek.  “I think you should eat something, my heartsweet.  Warm soup will calm you, help you to sleep.  Will you have some?”
“No! God no!” John leaned forward to grip his hands, “That isn’t what I meant at all! I love you very much Sherlock, more than ever, and make no mistake, I want you, badly!” He explained urgently, “It’s just that I think you need some time to figure things out, to get used to how things are different for you now. People often change their minds about important things during a personal crisis−”
“Nō, Ælfric.”
"That is what you think isn't it, Sherlock?! That's what everyone thinks about abusive relationships?! Why doesn't he just leave? I know if I was him I'd leave. He must be getting something out of it. Staying is just asking for it. No Sherlock! I was trapped; I had nowhere to go and no one to ask for help! I have almost no rights or legal protection; the few laws there are, Sherlock, are not enforced. There is nowhere to go!"
(See the end of the chapter for
He pulled John fiercely to him, wrapping him in a strong hug as if he could force the memories away and wash John’s wounds clean with his love alone. He knew this wasn’t possible but that realization did not stop him from trying. He said, “I’m sorry John. I’m sorry that you were forced to endure such despicable acts. What Harvey did to you was sadistic and cruel. What you’ve just told me−as well as all the others things he did to you that I’m aware you haven’t told me−should never have happened to you.”
"And don't try to turn away! You'll listen to everything I have to say to you unless you want me to break your sodding neck!"
His coaxing was met with no response.
A short time later, Robert Trenholm was seated in Mycroft’s office alongside Neilson.  He was saying, his expression grim, “I can assure you, Sir, that I’m doing everything possible to locate and bring in our rogue agent. Along with er… your brother?” Here his voice rose in cautious question.
This wasn't in the least true, of course, but that was what microwaves were for, wasn't it? Sherlock smiled at John and closed the bedroom door gently. He then vaulted down the stairs to put two frozen meals to heat before John could arrive in the kitchen and catch him out in his fib.
He replaced his pistol behind his back. "Now, we must get out of here."
“Yes, but−”
He spoke, "My marriage was arranged, Sherlock, by my father. He was in the army and Harvey was the son of his commanding officer. I would have liked to fall in love and choose my own husband but I had to accept my father's choice. Even so I was looking forward to having a mate and children..." his voice shook and Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but John continued determinedly. "I wanted to be happy Sherlock; I wanted to love Harvey but…"
He climbed out of bed and, not stopping to put his T shirt on, he went straight to the kitchen. He almost wilted with relief to see Sherlock making tea. He had had an irrational fear that he wouldn't be, that fate would once again tear them apart just as they were on the verge of finding each other, as it had once before...
“I’m sorry, John.  I…I guess I do need help…” Sherlock’s expression wasn’t visible as he stared down at the broken bits of pink and blue china, but his tone was meek. “Would you… John?”
He mentally shook himself and continued. "I'm sure that DI Lestrade will vouch for my partner's and my character." Here he looked hopefully at Lestrade. "Is there any possibility that we could look after the child in the short-term? Only temporarily, of course."
John, clutching Sherlock to him, brought the beam of his torch up to Sherlock’s face to assess his condition. His pallor was frightening but in the glare of the torch John was able to detect the slight movement of his lips as he formed silent words.
He assisted Sherlock to stand and guided him to the loo. Sherlock seemed steady enough to be left alone so John shut the door to give him some privacy. Sherlock emerged a short time later, looking pale and strained and he leaned heavily on John as he was assisted into bed.
What did stop him was Sherlock himself; instead of cringing away in fear as John might have expected at his assault, Sherlock did the opposite. It had taken a few seconds but the sensation of John’s firm hands, the sound of his snarling vocalizations and his uniquely powerful alpha scent brought recognition back Sherlock. He sighed, relaxed and offered himself up to John; for although he was still only half conscious, he knew that his alpha had come for him and he welcomed John’s attentions in whatever form they may take.
When he was still awake several minutes later, John, acting on intuition alone because he was now well past the limits of his rudimentary counselling skills, urged, “Tell him I’d like to meet him, Sherlock. Tell him I already know him and I love him; that I think he’s sweet and innocent and fun. Ask him to come out and play, Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded and began to rise to his feet. John settled him in the covered corner and jogged to where bags full of the day’s rubbish from the shops were stacked on the pavement. He pulled one from the stack and emptied its contents into a cardboard box. Turning, he jogged back to where the taller Alpha he’d shot lay slumped on the tracks. He rolled him and pulled his trousers off. His motions were clinical and precise; for John the situation was no different from the battle field. He had accomplished the mission and now his priority was the safe extraction of the innocent from the war zone. He would do whatever was required to ensure that happened.
He makes a promise to himself to visit the house tomorrow and introduce himself.
Still, he can’t quite believe it, and has to reassure himself by looking down at the dark mop of curls resting against his chest, pressing his lips against the pale forehead, listening for the man’s calm, deep breaths as he sleeps.
“Oh, sorry. I uh…Mrs Watson?” He checked to be sure.
Thursday 5:40pm
“I know,” Sherlock admitted with a smile, before reaching forward and grabbing John’s face with both hands and pulling him closer for another kiss.
Sherlock ran up the stairs, tripping clumsily in his haste on the way up, tearing the knee of his pants. He didn’t stop to investigate, he continued up and burst through the door. When he took in the scene in front of him he let out a gasp, and froze.
“Doctor Watson, this is Mister Holmes,” Greg said formally, gesturing to the tall man beside him to make the introduction.
“Have they?”
And as if to punctuate the point, Mycroft opened the door to the room and stood waiting at the open doorway. Lestrade stood slightly behind, craning his neck to see what was happening.
As he walks out along the path, his shoes begin to crunch on the gravel, the sound of his cane crunching in echo suddenly irritating. Soon the path gives way to smooth grass, littered with sticks and dried fallen needles beneath his feet: the crunching and crackling giving him little tingles of delight on the back of his neck. So many years in the desert and the city, he hasn’t been amid pure greenery like this for so long. Aside from the birds that call across the forest to one another, there is no other sound. Just his soft crackling footfalls, and he can’t decide if he feels satisfaction or sadness, to realize he is the only person for miles. John stops for a moment, under the shade of some lush pine trees that hide his house from the world, and sucks in another big breath to take in the fresh mountain air, his lungs excited by the slight chill and sweetness of the clean oxygen. He holds it in for a moment, just letting his lungs envelope it happily, before releasing a loud cleansing breath to the quiet around him. A small animal scurries past, almost unseen, into the protection of a low-lying shrub nearby and John smiles for a moment. The back of his mind briefly transmits an echo of Harry’s delighted giggles – “Johnjohn! Look!” – before it vanishes, and his face once again drops into firm, serious lines.  So much pent-up anger, hurt and mistrust. So much confusion about his place in the world.
, Lestrade,” Sherlock let out, before returning to his blank expression.
“No—” Sherlock said quickly, putting a hand on John’s back, avoiding the shoulder this time but still catching John by surprise. “Would you… stay here? Beside me?” he asked, and his voice had dropped to the gentlest version John had ever heard – like a child after a nightmare, wanting their parent to protect them from the monster under the bed.
Donovan stepped closer and flicked the switch for him, a little rougher than necessary, giving him a stern look. “Focus, Watson.”
“I like it because you wrote it, obviously. Because you have a way with words. I enjoy the way you paint the characters, the anatomical correctness of the stab wounds. Redbeard is my favourite. That dog is cleverer than any of the police officers.”
“I know it’s a lot to take in,” he conceded.
“Sherlock?” he managed to let out on a breath as his hand left Sherlock’s face to come down and grip the knife firmly planted in him. For a moment, their hands touched at the knife site, and Sherlock caressed John’s hand with his bloodied fingers for a moment, before letting them glide off to return their grip to the bars between them, John’s blood standing out on his beautiful white skin.
Sherlock was pacing on the far side of the room beside the window, wearing a hole in the floor from the repetitive movement. He bit at his thumbnail nervously, supporting his elbow with the other hand, his arm crossing his body protectively, his eyes unfocussed on the people around him.
“They need a good kick! Aren’t you in charge of the water?” he directed at John.
“Hang on a minute…” he said, sitting a little straighter, as an article caught his eye.
“Let me go and just sit in the café. I’ll stick to the eight minutes. For now. I won’t go on the day of the explosion. Just let me spend time there. A
“No, of course not.” Sherlock feels like a scolded child. Only Mycroft knows how to do that to him.
“I don’t want you to go,” John whispers back.
“John, it’s ok,” Sherlock wasn’t sure what John was about to be upset about, there were so many reasons he might completely snap.
They sank back into another kiss. John was sure he was never going to get sick of kissing this boy.
he always did. That way John didn’t like. Suddenly his blood was boiling and all of the joy he had felt was gone. He was angry.
“Oh sorry, no. They just travel a lot. We hardly see them.”
“Oh my, I hope I’m not causing problems… by asking?” Vassily checks, looking to John for an indication.
“Sally,” he tried again. “Come on. You’ve seen my work. You know I’m invested in this.”
“PTSD? Psychosomatic limp?” Mycroft guessed.
“Hi,” Greg responded, his voice smoother, more relaxed than Mycroft had even remembered it being, as he placed his phone back in his pocket.
The man eyed him up and down again. He clearly wasn’t buying whatever John was saying.
“We will be going in and apprehending the suspect directly on the street after the explosion. Watson, you will be staying here with Anderson,” Mycroft sneered.
… and yet…
right now. Just relax. Just breathe. Have a soak under the water. If you think of anything, just yell out and I’ll come and jot it down and we can let Lestrade know. But you don’t have to do anything. Nothing at all.”
“Because I thought we could handle it without you,” he said simply.
He had needed to come back to Baker Street. There was a couple of books and his tools that would be useful for this case, particularly if he wanted to stay away from the flat for a bit. He would need those things with him, but he had desperately not wanted to face John. He knew Rosie would probably be down for her morning nap after their lively play time earlier. There was no way he would have attempted coming into the flat if Rosie would be awake. Not in the state he was in. He couldn’t look into those eyes. Not now. But there was still John as well. John of course, had been peacefully reading a book in his chair. The scratchy sounds of the baby monitor the only noise, as it sat beside John on the coffee table - notifying them as Rosie shuffled restlessly in her cot, or sucked loudly on her thumb. Sherlock entered the flat, tentative and uncertain. He already felt guilty and unprepared for this. John closed his book, with great patience, taking in Sherlock’s mood, controlling his own very well.
They left the kitchen a mess, refilling their wine glasses instead. He remembers John trying to convince him of how great his music taste is, by playing him different variations of noise. He remembers giggling and that, at some point, he gave John German words he found online to try to pronounce, which gave them more cause to giggle, the wine spurring them on.
this already. This is why you have given up everything to give him that life, isn’t it?”
like that. My therapist has been trying to get me to say it for the longest time and it’s the last thing that always just seems to get stuck in my throat. And now, you need to know that. I’m here… to help you and make sure you get better. Because, I’m in love with you, Sherlock.” John felt so much better now that he had let that final admission go. But he knew it would likely be the final nail in the coffin of their friendship, now that it was out. Because he couldn't be sure Sherlock would accept it or know what to do with it. Sherlock, who rejected the very notion of emotional attachment.
“John. You’re soaked! You should have taken a cab!” Sherlock exclaims as he rushes forward to help grab at the groceries and get John inside.
, he thought,
"I brought you chips…" Sherlock stopped, confused. That had not been what he had meant to say. But John seemed to think nothing of it, for he simply smiled and responded that he liked chips and what a good idea they were for lunch which eased Sherlock's confusion and somehow made everything alright.
“NO, IT ISN’T! Get back in the car, Sherlock! Damn it! Don’t do this!” John was desperate.
Sherlock pulled a blanket and pillow from the bed and made John as comfortable as possible. Mobile in one hand, he then started to clean John's face with a damp flannel in the other. By the time he had finished with the flannel Mrs. Hudson was arriving at the bedroom door with a solemn looking man who was accompanied by a very obvious body guard.
“Can you stand?” John went to Sherlock’s side to assist him up. Sherlock rose unsteadily but once he was upright, he was able to stay that way.
Not the long chapter I promised.  But next week's is the longer one.  To be posted on Tuesday Dec 27.
When they were both dry and dressed, John moved them to an unused operating theatre where he could seat Sherlock on a gurney and re-bandage the cut over his eye and his injured ankle. Sherlock followed John’s practised movements with clearly absorbed fascination.
He was still sitting in the chair hours later when Blackburn woke again. John didn’t move as he watched Blackburn open his eyes and turn his head to look for John.  Their eyes met and held. Neither of them blinked.
John looked up in surprise, "Oh! I'm not, not him," he said, "I'm glad I knew what to do. I would kill anyone to save you Sherlock. I feel no regret." Then, by way of an explanation he added, "Greg has the same pistol that my father had; it's a standard, service-issue Glock 17."
There was silence for a long moment before John said softly, “And he did bring me luck, Sherlock.  He brought me you.”  The expression in his eyes was soft and adoring.
Sherlock, in fact, was not hungry, he had too much on his mind, but he would have sooner cut off his right arm than refuse John's meal, so he ate with every indication of enjoyment. And it was delicious. He found to his surprise that despite his lack of appetite he did enjoy it.
He gave his head a small shake, shrugged his shoulders and turned from the window.  He’d wait for Blackburn to wake and then persuade him to eat and drink.  Something told him it wouldn’t be an easy task.
He took a step toward the small cowering figure, wanting instinctively to comfort and protect. But the child was terrified, covering its head with its arms, trying to make itself a small as possible. John stopped, knowing any movement on either of their parts would only terrify it further. He couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl, it was too young, or too small, he wasn't sure which, and very dirty.
John reviewed their circumstances as he sat with closed eyes and the back of his head resting against the chair. He should have checked in with Graves long before now, should have provided him with a status update.  So why hadn’t he?
John had met Captain Moran briefly only once.  Speculation about the man’s atrocious activities had been confirmed for John by a medical colleague who had inadvertently found herself treating a prisoner who, it turned out, had been in the custody of Moran before he had come into her care. John’s colleague had done the best she could for the severely abused patient and succeeded in securing his protected status going forward, but, even the hardened battle surgeon that she was, she had been deeply disturbed by the victim’s condition.
“If that’s your way of saying you want me naked and in bed, John, then I accept.” He smirked at John.
Greg advanced in a friendly manner, but cautiously. Sherlock was right, the man looked frail and haunted and he had no wish to frighten him any more than he already was, although he obviously had an enthusiastic protector in Sherlock. Lestrade shot an assessing glance in Sherlock's direction.
He focused on Sherlock, whose light sweet scent was faint, but as bright as a beacon for John in his already semi-bonded state.  Once he had established the direction in which the party had taken, he assessed possible locations where Moran might be headed with Sherlock. Bunkers were the most obvious possibility; they were heavily fortified structures and almost sound-proof. Used to store ammunition, they were not frequented by base personnel on a regular basis. Some were even abandoned altogether when fighting moved on to different fronts.
They rested for a while, holding each other, calming down and reconnecting. Then John murmured, “So, did you like it, Sherlock?”
John watched him for a long moment as he slept. Then, when he’d drunk his fill, he bent to press his lips lightly to Sherlock’s hair before turning off the light and stretching out himself.  He drew Sherlock close and rested, listening to the night sounds of the camp, alert for anything that might indicate a threat.
“Yes, alright then.  First, hand me the shirt.”
“Alright, alright Sherlock!”
Lying down, he expected to feel some of his previous exhaustion return, but to his surprise he found that he was no longer tired, rather, he felt alert and invigorated.  He was considering how this could be when he heard a rustling beside him. He turned his head to smile into the darkness as he felt Sherlock in the sleeping bag press up against him with a small sigh.
Mycroft rose from his desk abruptly to pace before the window. The creeping shadows of late afternoon kept his expression hidden from the two men still seated.  Neilson and Trenholm glanced at one another, knowing they had been dismissed.
This admission was music to John’s ears but he didn’t say so.
They were close to the cathedral's great west entrance when a dark shape detached itself from the wall and Lestrade joined them. Upon seeing John he aimed a frown of concern at Sherlock, who ignored it. Instead, Sherlock raised a questioning eyebrow at Lestrade and a silent conversation of hand gestures ensued.
John continued weeping for some time but he appeared to be more oriented than when Sherlock had first arrived so he said nothing more, just held John, trying to control the churning of his own emotions which were threatening to overwhelm him now that they had been cut loose.
In addition, with no one to advocate for John it was unlikely that the hospital would keep him once his immediate health crisis was over and if discharged alone, in his present mental state, his outcome was uncertain. So to Sherlock, never one to worry about social norms, this seemed a reasonable solution. There was the unused bedroom upstairs in his flat that John could occupy, at least in the short term (Sherlock's search for an agreeable flatmate was ever ongoing) and perhaps John's family of origin could be located with a bit of research…not that Sherlock held out much hope for that. Abandoned Omegas, especially childless ones, were an embarrassment to family. No longer a youth, John's chances of social recovery were low.
Once he had John undressed, Sherlock removed his own robe and pyjamas and lowered his head to kiss John, slowly and lovingly.  The kiss seemed to wake John up and he began to kiss Sherlock back eagerly.  Sherlock smiled as he lifted his mouth from John’s, picked up one of the bottles from where he had set it, and drew John into the shower.
Once on the main road, despite the late hour, Sherlock was able to hail a cab to carry them the remaining distance to the cathedral. In the back seat of the cab, they didn't speak. Twice, Sherlock cast a quick look at John but John looked ahead or out the window, his expression unreadable.
"Hi," John repeated, "I'm Dr. Watson." He thought it best to use an authority figure approach to build trust with the child. "What is your name?"
“Ælfric?”
John, wincing as he struggled to his feet, smiled back at him. Far away across the river, the pealing of church bells began to sound.
A multitude of expressions were chasing each other across Sherlock’s face as he stared at John; amazement, embarrassment, fear, longing, love and, although John was certain Sherlock had no idea of it; to John’s astonishment, sexual desire. And wasn’t that interesting?!
“Yes, I want to change very much John, very much.”
Sherlock shook his head weakly, docile now and trusting John to take care of him.
But he said nothing just then. Instead he soothed a now sleepy John, drying him carefully with his T-shirt, urging him to close his eyes and covering him with his duvet.
Sherlock groaned in frustration and turned away, bringing his knees to his chest in a tight clench. “Why not, John?!” he begged, “What is wrong with now?!”
"But Sherlock, why risk delivering the letter with so many people around, why not just do it later?"
His suggestion came when it appeared that December could accommodate no more toast or milk.
He laid John out on his back in the bed and was within seconds of starting resuscitation when the door swung open and a medical team flooded into the room, shoving him aside and descending on the limp figure on the bed.
The kitchen appeared cleaner than it had last night; in fact, the entire flat was looking very clean. And were their books, all four shelves, now organised in alphabetic order? Yes, they were. They hadn't been last night…
Sherlock's hand moved perceptibly closer to John's again as he continued. "After you were assaulted and pushed to the floor, you said you searched for your dropped mobile, again you would have found the letter had it been in the nave or the foyer but you saw nothing. My certain conclusion? There was nothing to find because the letter was not yet there."
Thank you God! Thank you, Eallwealdend and my beloved ealdmóder, thank you.
“What, John? What is it? Just tell me and I’ll fix it for you.”
“Just a cuddle, Sherlock? Of course.” John winked. “But if you start snoring…”
After a long silence Sherlock asked carefully, “And my body tells you something, John?”
"Caught you at a bad time?" Lestrade quipped, trying to diffuse the tension in the room. It didn't work.
Mycroft lifted his chin in annoyance at this accusation.  “I admit that events did not unfold quite as I intended,” his speculative gaze swept over John once more. “I was trying to teach my little brother a lesson.  He cannot always rely upon me to rescue him from his ill-advised adventures.  He needs to become more circumspect in his behaviour.” He sniffed and drew himself up to his full height, “I can see I have failed spectacularly in this latest endeavour, perhaps not surprisingly.”
