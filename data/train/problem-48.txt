“Both of you might have been there; Watson was caught, but you could have escaped,” Lestrade said. “While we were taking Watson in and interrogating him, you might have come home and put the guns in their places.”
Mrs Hudson brings up his mail. Nothing interesting, of course, just bills. A fund-raising letter from his old school. He motions that she should just leave them on the table.
There is no tomato soup, so he has a roast beef sandwich and a bag of crisps. Though he hasn’t seen Holmes for a couple weeks, he still expects that coat to come swooshing through the door any moment. It isn’t exactly disappointment that he hasn’t seen his nemesis; maybe he’s just bored.
But the mood of the evening has fizzled. More than that, the silence between them is weighted with something Sherlock must say. He will wait until they’re home. Maybe John will explain before it comes to that.
“Irene, let me be honest with you. There was nothing between John and me. We worked together. Why does this interest you?”
made me. Every choice I made has created the man you see. Good choices, bad choices. I am what I am, and I accept the blame for that.”
He doesn’t remember the house they lived in until he turned three. It was spacious, Harry used to say, though he thinks that’s probably an exaggeration. What does a nine year old know about
Daniel is a chef. “I never get weekends off,” he complains. “That’s why we started doing Wednesdays.”
“You’re my partner, as we have agreed. The job description is somewhat flexible, and includes personal assistant, valet, butler, messenger, clerk…
“Some of the things you said were true,” Molly continued. “I should have shared the script and asked for you all to collaborate. I didn’t because… Well, it’s just this. You’re brilliant, and you don’t mind pointing out the flaws of every script, every performance— and you’re not polite about it. It’s a bit intimidating for someone like me. I try to put my heart into each part I play, even Gastro Girl.” She smiled. “Just a silly advert, but I like to think people trust me. I help people, you know, with an embarrassing problem. I make it something they can talk about.”
They stand in the vestibule of 221B. It’s late; Mrs Hudson is in bed. John is leaning against the closed door, looking up at him. He is hesitant, but not timid. His eyes are soft. His tongue touches his upper lip, a signal. The way he’s looking at Sherlock makes it clear what he wants.
He glances at Sherlock, who is pulling back, looking like he wishes he hadn’t just asked for a kiss. Maybe he’ll make a joke about their game, move them towards goodnight, goodbye, see you at the wedding.
I might have saved you a lot of space there in my drawer, a repository of mundane information: how to make tea, when the bills are due, how to talk to people without getting them angry. You didn’t have to remember those things because they were my responsibility. I didn’t mind.
I examine the wounds. Only a couple are deep enough to be worrisome, but he’s avoided infection, which would have made it so much worse. He cringes a bit when I touch them, applying the salve he was prescribed. I cover them with a layer of gauze and pull a clean cotton t-shirt over it all.
“Well, I’m sure that will be more interesting than treating rashes and runny noses. You will continue working with Mr Holmes, then?”
“No idea. I was in a classy restaurant with my girlfriend sitting across from me, and I was trying to tell her I wanted to marry her. The waiter kept interrupting and when I looked up—“ He covers his face with his hands. “I didn’t know what to do.”
“Did you read the medical report? What Henry did to himself was not cutting. It was a suicide attempt, albeit a poorly executed one. There were no signs that he’d cut himself before.”
Watson is bleeding out. Holmes lies to Lestrade, tells him the bullet grazed Watson’s belly, and that he’d better take him home and see to it. Watson is fading, his eyes dimming as he allows Holmes to lift him into the cab. The quantity of blood left behind on the floor of the old man’s house ought to tell Lestrade that it’s more than a scratch, but he’s too distracted to notice.
He sat up in bed, his heart pounding. For a moment he couldn’t figure out where he was or what had happened. As his eyes gradually adapted to the darkness, he saw that he was in his bedroom. His legs were twisted in the sheets, thrashed free from the mattress as he was dreaming. The glowing dial of the ancient alarm clock read
If that was what it meant to be a proper child, I thought I would rather be a demon. This I did not say, but I felt something within me shift. I could never be what my aunt thought I should be, and would henceforth stop trying to please anyone who demanded that I be other than what I was.
says it all. You talked to him, and if you don’t know, there is little chance I can answer your question. But I’m hoping you’ll be able to tell me something about him. I can work with small clues; I have trained myself to see the relevance of what appears insignificant to you. You, however, have an unfortunate tendency to ignore the obvious, the self-evident, and even the blatant attempts to
mind,” he says softly. “That night you went out to meet Lestrade? He said there was no case. Why did you lie to me?”
The door opens, and John is standing there, looking embarrassed for some reason. He’s holding a bag of takeaway from the Chinese place down the street.
was a good reason to celebrate. Ever since the tenth anniversary, she’d been rounding them up each year to relive the past. He’d stayed away last year, believing he’d burned that bridge thoroughly the year before by arriving high, telling everyone they were no-talent amateurs who would be doing adverts for loo roll or dandruff shampoo for the rest of their lives. Foolishly, he had forgotten that all hearts are broken, all shows eventually cancelled, and all actors ultimately lining up for auditions along with the amateurs.
He was keeping his composure fairly well, he thought. He would not give this woman the satisfaction of flustering him.
It wasn’t a normal dream. It felt real in a way my dreams never are. When I dream, it’s either sudden-terror-screaming in my veins, or vague, forgettable greyness, slipping away as I wake and try to recall what it was. This one was different. The airport felt real, smelled like airports smell— coffee, fried food, and whatever that
. That part of his education had been scuttled to make room for more practical things. I did not need an assistant who could quote poetry.
“I haven’t forgiven you,” Watson says. “Hurling yourself into that cataclysm— and what for? You’re mad, you know.”
The evening is like every other night in London between November and May, chilly and damp, no sign of stars. They walk in silence for a while. He’s getting re-acclimated to the city, she imagines, cataloguing the things that have changed. She remembers returning home after her first term at university, marvelling at how all the familiar things seemed both less and more than what she had remembered. To a man with an eidetic memory, this London must be bewildering, what with all the small changes she hardly notices from day to day. He looks unsettled, she thinks, even a bit daunted. Still getting used to it all.
The best thing, though, was his violin. He played sometimes after supper, when students were still in the great room, talking and finishing their lessons. I would always sit where I could watch his fingers, see the bow moving up and down, and thought about how wonderful it would be to know how to make such music.
Sherlock nodded. “I think there’s a diamond one, isn’t there? Is that sixty years? Maybe they’ll have a hotel on the moon by then.”
London has not changed. The gas lights shed their halos on the pavement, the carriages splash through puddles, hoofs on cobblestones. Cold, wet, and foggy, as always.
But Mike is persistent. He’s not really a friend, just a bloke who sat next to him in class one year. They’re both the type of people who always arrive anywhere ten minutes early, and used to chat while waiting for class to begin— about the assignments and the exams, the instructor (and his affair with his teaching assistant), and the other people in the class. John doesn’t have many attachments from those days, and he’d rather not be on the receiving end of anyone’s sympathy.
He limped along with me. “I suppose you’ve already reserved a room, ordered dinner, and bought tickets.”
After they’ve had some breakfast, they walk the halls of the school, past the hushed classrooms where boys bend over some reading task while thinking about what they were told an hour ago. He imagines the halls full of noisy boys, jostling each other and hurrying to class, laughing and taunting one another. He remembers walking to class in that throng, watching his back to make sure no one snuck up on him, pushing his books out of his arms or tripping him. Always alert, expecting trouble.
“You’re fourteen, and soon you’ll be making decisions about what you want to do with your life. When I was your age, I had two dreams: to be a doctor, and to join the army. I wanted to help people, save lives, and it seemed worth sacrificing time and money to do that. I joined the army because…” He pauses, not at all sure how to explain. “I joined because I wasn’t ready to have an easy life. I wanted adventure, to see other places and people, to do something that mattered. The war had been going on for years. I wanted to be part of that, to put myself in danger, to save lives…”
He nods. “At those moments… it was nice. An escape. I imagined that you were with me, that I’d brought you along. You took care of me, comforted me.”
He smiled and wagged a finger. “No fan forums, Mike. Irene decreed it. I’m shocked that you would disobey.”
Even Mycroft might be worried. He calls a couple times; I don’t answer. Finally he stops by. I make him tea, and he sits there studying me, almost the way Sherlock used to do, as if he could read my mind. He reminds me it wasn’t my fault, and that Sherlock wouldn’t want me grieving so long.
If it had been the other way around, if Sherlock had witnessed me killing myself— which I never would have done— but if I had, I know she would have visited Sherlock. At least the first week. He probably would have forgotten me by now. He might have cared about me, but he would have deleted me by the time I’d been dead for six months. He would move on with the Work, reminding himself that caring wasn’t an advantage where flatmates were concerned. I’d like to think he wouldn’t look for another flatmate.
He has something in his pocket, which he fishes out now. “I know how you feel about drugs.” He remembers how I was after Afghanistan, how I’d gotten myself a bit hooked on sleeping pills, which didn’t help much and made it all the worse when I gave them up. I never told you about that, though maybe you deduced it. You knew about the nightmares. Every night, waking in a sweat, still in the nightmare that haunted me by day. It’s not so different now, just a new nightmare.
“Why not? No, better question: why did you want everyone to think you were dead? And why did you come back to London, where you might be recognised?”
For Mike’s benefit, they act out a little drama, plan to meet the following day, but when he returns to Baker Street, Watson is already sitting in his chair, waiting for him.
. Sleeping and waking together, their bodies touching under the bedding. Sometimes he feels like a person who’s been starving and is now having real food for the first time in years. It startles him when John plants a kiss on his forehead or the back of his neck in passing, but he looks forward to it, and begins to plant a few kisses of his own. The first time John slipped his hand into Sherlock’s as they were leaving a crime scene, his heart began to beat faster. He expected to hear jeers from Lestrade’s team, but no one remarked. It’s normal, he decides. For once,
I used to think Molly was jealous of me. She was in love with Sherlock and he barely noticed her, unless he needed something she could supply. Maybe she thought there was something between me and Sherlock, that we were lovers. We weren’t, but we were close, and we spent most of our time together. I guess a person could envy that. But love? No, Sherlock Holmes didn’t do love. He used me, too.
She handed me one of the books my two older cousins were to read. I opened it, wondering what sort of stories there might be inside. At that time I was a great lover of adventures and strange tales. The first page looked promising, with an illustration of an island in the middle of the sea.
“You would do well to read this book,” he scolded, “Or you yourselves will be the ones cast out of the kingdom of God. This verse describes the Day of Judgment, when God will not recognise sinners, but will turn them away. That is why they will weep and gnash their teeth.”
Forgetting wasn’t easy, however. When he heard about John’s suicide, he’d been devastated, and had spiralled into his worst drug binge ever. It wouldn’t have occurred to him then to ask questions about the death. He was just trying to numb the pain.
John startles, physically jumps off the sofa, turns and glares at him. “How do you—? I know I’m an open book, but it’s not funny.”
Sometimes I was with Lestrade, at the crime scenes where I’d met ghosts. That was the best part of my life, solving mysteries, John hovering nearby. I walked the streets of London, climbed the stairs to my old rooms at 221B Baker Street.
Miss Chadwick was discussing watercolours with a serious-looking Watson. The sad little art works hanging on the wall were apparently her creations. She no doubt spoke a little French badly and played piano tolerably well. This was the fate of most nouveau riche, that they sought to recreate a society that no longer existed. They affected manners that were old-fashioned, and dressed expensively, but inelegantly. Watson, though of humble roots, looked suave by comparison.
“People change. I’m not trying to be anyone other than who I am. It’s just… I left home and never went back.”
“Well, it was a rough day for Molly, no lie.” Lestrade frowned at him, a question on his face. “You okay, Sherlock? You seem… preoccupied.”
But there are other ways to kill yourself. Less violent ways. Even paracetamol can kill you, if you take too much.
The retrospective ended and the audience applauded. He could feel anticipation coming off of them in waves, an almost palpable force. There were children in the audience, but most of the seats were filled with women in their thirties, waiting to see their fantasies come to life. He hoped they would not be too disappointed.
“I took my degree for your sake, and to prove that I could do it. I will always be grateful to you for that. But I still don’t give a fig for anyone’s opinion of me, and I don’t intend to start a practice. I am your partner, and as long as you think well of me, I am content. Even so, I’m glad he won’t be blackmailing more people.”
“He told us a great deal,” Holmes said. “We have a name, for one: Adam. The fact that he gave us a name means that he does know something, but he’s afraid, and only realised after saying it that it might not be good for Adam if we start asking him questions. In a school the size of Priory, there can’t be many boys by that name. We’ll see if there are any in Henry’s year. We’ll have to question a number of boys so we don’t draw attention to either Henry or Adam.”
The barista turned and began to rummage around behind the bar. John studied his perfect arse with fascination. He imagined his hands around those twin mounds of luscious—
“True.” Holmes fiddles with the strap of his bag. “You didn’t choose to be shot. But you did join the army, knowing the odds of being shot were better than if you’d taken a job at a surgery in Westminster.”
“I think we have enough tea and toast to stay in hiding for a few days. You’ll need some clothes, though.”
“No, you’re not.” I said this because it had taken me a few years to build up a practice as consulting detective, and even more years to find John. We had a perfect life, and I was not about to abandon that. “These girls are not going to change our entire life, John. They’ll get bored of us after a while and find a new obsession. That’s what teens do.”
It’s frightening how fast John has started to think of this as permanent, the two of them living in the flat, sleeping together, chuckling over bad telly and dashing off to crime scenes.
He wakes in the morgue. A day, at least, has gone by, judging by the state of his healing body. It’s too soon to be moving; he needs to go into stasis, but it can’t be here. That would raise too many questions. At times like this, it’s handy to have an accomplice.
Sitting up, he looks around. He can hear Molly in the office, talking on the phone with someone, maybe Lestrade. It will be interesting to see what Scotland Yard makes of their deaths, his and Moriarty’s. A crime has been committed, but is it murder? Suicide? A revenge killing?
love his parents and his brother, just by virtue of who they are. That doesn’t mean he actually likes them, or that he would choose to spend time with them if that were not expected. Friends are people who have worn down the edges of his natural wariness, becoming so familiar that they no longer grate on him. He tolerates them. Friendship is just familiarity brought to a conscious level. It’s a choice to maintain familiarity.
Maybe John stayed with me because he first realised he was a ghost when he met me. Maybe he had no family, and he saw me as a friend. But I believe that he just wanted to grow up, vicariously. He could only live a shadow life, and had chosen my life to experience second-hand.
“You mean… you’ve never…” John has raised his head, and is looking down at him. “I guess that makes us both virgins, then.”
I stood by the desk. “You said the body was discovered lying thus, the feet towards the veranda door, the head towards the hallway. If the shot was fired by Watson, who was over there, by the safe, then why did the body fall in that manner? The shot that killed him must have come from the veranda door. Was that door locked?” I asked.
She takes his hand. “It’s all right. I must not be very good at attracting all those dozens of men.”
We’d told Mrs Hudson, of course, and sworn her to secrecy. She may seem like a foolish old woman, but she is fiercely protective of Sherlock, and doesn't let a single word slip from her lips, or a single visitor come to our door. Not even Mycroft could get through her security.
On the third evening, I came back late, as had been my habit. I lingered a bit on the street, but was not met by any dangerous men wanting to have their way with me. Disappointed, I headed up the stairs and entered the flat.
When he returns to the flat that evening, Sherlock has made dinner for him. It’s a huge relief, a confirmation that he was right not to press him to talk. Without a word, they embrace. Holding on, they sway, rocking to comfort each other.
so he’d at least passed his A-levels. No reunions there. “It’s depressing to see what’s happened to us all.”
“Yeah, I guess you haven’t changed. I saw the interview the other day. You getting ready to out yourself?”
Now that she’d grown out the awkwardness of adolescence, he could see the resemblance to her brother more clearly. She had the same build, short and compact, and her features were a softer echo of his. The eyes that were glaring at him were her mother’s eyes, though. Her hair was darker than Johns, cut short like a boy’s. Though she had no artistic talent of her own, she had enough sense to wear clothes that suited her, a tailored jacket over trim jeans, dark-framed glasses, unimposing jewellery.
“Ridiculous.” I stopped. We had reached a level place in the path where I could catch my breath again. Composing myself, I looked out over the valley.
Sherlock holds him at arm’s length, studying him. “You’re doing that thing. The thing I always do to you, where I confuse you into agreeing with me.”
This made him laugh again. “Oh, I suppose I am responsible for corrupting you, hm? Well, I will not cease to do so. It is not a vice, but healthy for us both, much better than tobacco and other things. So, you will not quit smoking? Then you must take me on a holiday if I win the wager. Somewhere exotic and romantic, for at least a week. And the entire time you must do nothing but eat, sleep, and let me corrupt you.”
The detective is regarding him with the palest eyes John has ever seen. His dark curls fashionably tousled, he is wearing a suit that probably cost more than John’s entire army pension, a fitted shirt, dark purple (not that someone this posh would call it purple;
“Yes, we did.” I laughed. “People say life is short, but it isn’t. I never intended to live so long.”
“I’m calling an ambulance,” the cop says. “You look like you need medical attention. So does this guy,” he says, fastening the cuffs on Michael.
I waited until the blancmange was served to ask her. We had been chatting amiably over our entrees, and though I do not generally find female company interesting, she was tolerable. I did not dislike her.
might describe it, he thinks. “My wife and I are divorcing, and that’s a bit of tension. But Sherlock’s been wonderful. Amazing.”
John’s tongue was exploring his neck, moving down his chest, then lingering just above his crotch, teasing him.
, and a few stations have banned it, but the DVDs are selling out. You have to realise that fans are a diverse group, and you’re never going to please them all. Alex and Jason were young when it started, and the scripts were focused on their growth, as adolescents discovering who they are. These two characters clearly loved each other; I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that they fell in love. Why can’t they be gay? That’s the age when many kids first begin figuring it out.”
It’s Friday evening. Just as he’s about to let himself into the house with his key, Mary opens the door. She’s wearing a taupe silk dress, rather low cut, embroidered with black, sequinned leaves. No necklace, just a pair of silver art-deco earrings. She’s always loved vintage dresses and jewellery, and he supposes that she can afford them now.
I dim the lights, leaving him just enough so he won’t be too confused if he wakes in the dark. For a moment I stand at the door watching him, marvelling at the fact that he’s here.
“Oh.” She looks truly distraught, shakes her head. “No, John. He loved you. I’m sure he had a reason—“
“Actually, I’ve written— if you don’t mind, I mean… Sometimes I write stories about Alex. Just for my own entertainment, of course.” She pulled a crumpled pile of paper from her bag. “They’re not really suitable for work. I mean, with Jason and Alex, I’d always thought—“
He waited for me to continue. When I did not, he said, “If you have a plan, you should at least share it with me. If you want me to break into the house, I am willing, as you already know. I am always willing, Holmes. You need not ask. But if we are partners, plans must be discussed before you sneak out of the house in some terrible disguise.”
“He’s a good agent.” Sherlock ate another few chips, licked the salt off his fingers. “I’m lucky to have him.”
Sherlock shrugged. Whatever John might have thought, doing a reunion without him felt horrible. It couldn’t be over soon enough.
You see? Just one little twist of fate and nobody would have heard of you. You’re ordinary, replaceable. Someone else would have made those films that got you noticed, let people see your talent. Someone else would be Baz Culpepper, consulting detective. Somebody like me, for example.”
John sidled up and slipped an arm around his waist. “An historic moment,” he said. “First gay kiss before the watershed.”
“Is this cooking wine?” John takes another swallow and squints into his glass. “For dinner I was going to make that thing.”
Watson hums, nods. “The Seminar, they called it. I suppose that sounded innocuous to anyone who overheard.”
And yet, when Sherlock tossed out an ad-libbed line, he fell in step without a pause. He was adaptable, reliable, and had already been a bit typecast, always the adorably shy boy who gives his heart without hesitation. He liked to fit in, hated the attention he drew, modestly pointing out how the cast and crew had worked together.
He climbs the stairs. Rosie’s door is closed, but he doesn’t hear anything, which probably means she has her earbud in, listening to music. Teenagers in the age of MP3 and earbuds are much quieter than they were in his day, and maybe that’s not such a good thing. At least a blasting stereo might give him a clue as to her mood.
On the last page (at last) there was a heart, not a cartoon Valentine heart, but an anatomically correct heart, meticulously drawn. The caption read:
Ignoring the obvious lie, I slide in beside him and close the door. “One question.” The car begins to move. I don’t care where we’re going, and I’m not getting out until I have an answer. “I need to know, and if you won’t tell me…”
At this point, a constable entered and reported that Milverton’s pistol had been taken as evidence, but no second weapon had been found, in spite of a thorough search of the grounds, made easier by the lack of dense foliage. It was an unusually clear and bright day, and the constables made quick work of their task.
Holmes: I have deduced that. And it is not a fallacy if you have deduced the same about me. You stimulate more than my mind.
“How can you bear listening to him?” I asked him later that evening as we sat warming our feet before the fire. “I despise him.”
Tonight nothing will help. I want to be close to the loo, so I lie down on the sofa, propping myself up with extra pillows so I can breathe.
Lestrade shrugged. “So have I. We have good chemistry, I think. I can suggest you to some people, if you like.”
when they enter the lab. A tall fellow with dark, curly hair is using a pipette to drop some liquid into a Petri dish. Hearing John’s voice, he looks up.
“With all the media attention, I believe they did. They didn’t like the scrutiny; when a body was found, they decided it was John Watson. They needed to close the case and did what seemed logical without wasting a lot of man-hours on a case that was self-evident.”
“Yes, you did. Back there, about twenty minutes ago. In a shrub that looked like it was already dead, so no worries.”
She leans forward a bit. “Did you date them because you wanted to, or because you thought you were supposed to?”
Even though he has only a few conclusions, he works on an article recounting his longevity research. Eventually it becomes a book. He will not publish it yet, not until he’s ready to move on again. Already, he’s begun posing as William Vernet’s son, and soon he’ll have to become someone else.
Greg shrugged. “I ran into one of the writers, Ron Sweet. He said they’ve hired someone to write it. Wouldn’t tell me anything else.”
My aunt had not changed in essentials, but she did seem a bit less arrogant, perhaps chastened by the failed lives of her children. Even so, it was obvious that she still resented me. This was no surprise, and I found that I did not care. I had done well at Cambridge, and I had learned to be content with my own interests, however small my income. The lesson she was learning, to her sorrow, was that in the end, money could not buy happiness.
“I know, I know, Sherlock. You had a bad experience with what’s-his-name. John is not rejecting you. You’re not an easy person to know, but he loves you, and he’s been loyal.”
The priest is saying a prayer now. The music is soft, nothing I recognise. You were always particular about music. Sometimes you indulged me, like at Christmas, playing carols on your violin. But you didn’t know much contemporary music. And you never went to church. You liked classical music, Bach and Mozart and Tchaikovsky. The ones you used to play when you were thinking I can recognise, but I don’t know names, composers. What the organ is playing now is generic funeral music.
“That’s precisely what I want to know,” says Holmes. “I intend to dig up any shreds of memory lingering in that tragically unused brain of yours.”
okay.” He doesn’t want to talk about it. “Hey, I was wondering. Do you know… whatever happened to Mum and Dad’s old LPs? Do you have them?”
His mother died suddenly in the final year of the series. John said it was cancer, but Sherlock had seen her often enough to know that she was an alcoholic.
She holds his arm as they walk out of the hospital, nods goodbye to the woman at the desk and the guard standing near the door.
The laser focus of those eyes is unnerving. Seeking to divert the attention away from himself, Waston asks, “Who do you blame?”
“Good morning.” John is standing at the kitchen door, scratching his belly and ruffling a hand through his hair. He looks sleep-tousled, sated, beautiful. He leans down, kisses Sherlock lightly on the lips, and flicks on the kettle. “Anything on today?”
“Then it was just bad luck getting shot? Shoulder, obviously. So what the devil is wrong with your leg?”
Tonight he will push, he decides. John will probably be more comfortable inside Sherlock than vice versa, and that’s fine. Sherlock doesn’t have any preference, but he doesn’t have much experience, either. He doesn’t see them falling into defined roles, top and bottom. This first time it will be easier this way.
“You have cleaned in here,” I said, irritated that she felt it necessary to tidy up when there was no one to create a mess. Even with Mycroft paying her to keep the flat ready, she ought to have simply closed the door and left everything in place, dust, spiders webs, and all. I suppose it is the Housekeeper’s Creed to keep the place in a constant state of readiness for unexpected guests. And though
“I don’t know. It just came to me. It was a cold night, so he must have been wearing a coat if I went outside with him, right? Well… never mind.” He closes his eyes again.
It’s normal to hate the way time changes everything. Most of Sherlock’s past life is best forgotten, but there are moments that make him tear up with nostalgia, just because he can never live them again. Most of them involve John.
Obviously he doesn’t need an extra brain to solve anything, especially an inferior brain like Watson’s. He takes every opportunity to explain to John why he’s an idiot. The fact that they’re on a train together, planning to solve a mystery, is madness. It’s a terrible idea.
The boys at that school were privileged, for sure, and malicious in ways he hadn’t experienced before. In his old school he’d been pranked, and he’d survived many a fight on the streets, but he’d never really been humiliated before. No one in the neighbourhood could make him feel less, because they were all the same. You didn’t stab someone in the back or undercut them because even if you hated their guts, you were all scuffing along the same uncertain life, just trying not to get jumped on your way home.
“And yet, he knows of boys who are cutting themselves,” counters Watson. “It’s a sign of unhappiness, a way to control emotional pain by inflicting physical pain.”
“John.” She waits until he raises his head and looks at her. “Let’s say you never do get up the courage to tell him. Will you stop regretting it? I mean, you have a choice. The ring is still in your pocket. Ignore what people are expecting you to do. What I would be asking myself is this: Will I regret it more if I say it and he doesn’t want that? If I don’t say it, can I live with that?”
We were having tea in the sitting room at Baker Street. My brother had taken the chair opposite mine and was regarding me with a sour look. Watson was hovering deferentially with the teapot because he knows that irritates Mycroft.
If this is a date, it’s the strangest one John has ever been on. He doesn’t know the rules for this situation. Is he supposed to text Sherlock, go looking for him, or just go home? He doesn’t have his address, his phone number, or any other way of finding him.
It was indeed a picture of John Watson, looking doctor-sexy in his scrubs. It was from the website of the surgery where he did locum work.
“We appreciate your help,” Watson says. No sense in antagonising him. Being polite won’t cost him anything except a small piece of his pride.
And he would weep to see what had become of me. He would beg my forgiveness for leaving me, abandoning me for a woman, promise that he would nurse me back to health…
If only, I thought, all of them would together protest the harshness, the meagre meals and the cold beds. There were more of us, and if we rebelled, there were not enough of them to punish us all. Some of the biggest boys were nearly as tall as the teachers.
“Our mother is a very strong woman, as you know. She notices only what she wishes to notice, and does it with unwavering intensity. What she does not wish to notice does not exist.”
Please note: There is some more discussion of John's "suicide" in this chapter, if that bothers you.
What struck me suddenly was that such a large number of spirit children could only mean one thing. All of these children had died here, maybe in an epidemic, or perhaps over the years. Children die every day, of course, but as a child myself, I had not thought much about my own death until I met John.
The knights in the stories he read didn’t get married and nag their children to do their lessons. A knight rode around and had adventures, and if he met a woman who deserved it, he gave her his loyalty, his protection, and his adoration. Her job was to be beautiful and to admire his bravery. This was an ideal love, he decided.
He was wearing glasses, another typical element of disguise. The Clark Kent ploy. It was amazing that trick even worked, it was so obvious.
, had been cast in the role of Gavin Hawke, the DI, and suggested Sherlock for the part. Ironically his character, Baz Culpeper, also had a drug problem. In the pilot episode, his character met his mentor when he stumbled onto a crime scene high as a kite and offered his deductions to the detective.
I developed a reputation for my interactions with ghosts, and this was how I began to earn a living from my unusual talent. People whose homes were haunted wrote to me, asking if I would come and see their ghost, find out what might make it go away. Others had questions for their dear departed, sometimes mundane (where is the will?) and more often personal (are you happy?) My ability to answer these questions gained me new clients. In time, I was able to pay my rent without my brother’s assistance.
Inside, we visit Molly. She’s so happy to see him that she hugs him and can’t let go. He’s embarrassed, but also realises how much he owes her, so he lets her hang on and thanks her. Then she turns to me and gives me a hug too, whispering in my ear as she does:
Holmes sighs. “It would be irresponsible to form a conclusion without complete evidence, but I believe you are right to suspect foul play.”
is more like it), and no tie. He rises when John arrives at the table. A tall man, with the lanky grace of a model. The entire effect, the clothes and the man, is elegance.
The whip flies through me and this time it stings. “I’m real, Sherlock. You’re real. That man is not real. He can’t hurt you.”
Not the reaction he was expecting; he feels his heart pounding and his stomach clench as he tries to figure out how to make this right. He doesn’t understand John’s reaction, so how can he reply? He needs more information, but if John doesn’t want to talk about it, and he can’t deduce it— “I’m not laughing, John. I didn’t mean— I was just thinking, this is a big change for her, and I’m sure—“
John looks a bit deranged, his hair standing on end as if he’s combed his fingers through it repeatedly. He keeps running his hand over the little moustache that Sherlock hates, as if he wants to wipe it off. There’s no smell of liquor on him, though.
He stops looking at his email; Lestrade knows not to bother him with cases. No client can pull him away from 221B. He gives his full attention to watching John. On a spreadsheet, he catalogues how many cups of tea he drinks, how often he falls asleep and for how long. He asks John questions several times a day, just to check his memory, and he makes off-hand remarks to check his reactions. All this data he records for analysis. When he brings John back for his checkup, he will know exactly what he needs to ask.
Mike sighed. “Let’s say what you believe is true, that he is alive, somewhere. Let’s say he’s driving a cab in London. That he’s grown a beard and is using an alias—“
I’d wanted to kiss John Watson from the moment he limped into the path lab at Barts and shared his phone with me. It wasn’t that offering me his phone was a romantic gesture, or that he seemed flirtatious in the way he handed it to me. Kissing him simply seemed like the logical response to meeting him. He was short and compact, neatly dressed, with a polite wariness that concealed a sort of a perplexed fury. A man who’d been moving towards things for so long— army, career, meaning— that deprived of these things, he couldn’t figure out how to stop marching across the Iraqi desert. Or Afghanistan, perhaps.
I assume Mycroft made all the arrangements. Maybe he had a reason for lilies. Or maybe he just had Anthea choose.
But even then, while Holmes was doing his experiments, trying to avoid being burned at the stake for witchcraft, he knew that Watson was somewhere in the world, doing things. He’d never been one to sit around and speculate; he liked to be in the thick of Life. He’d been a healer, so perhaps he was patching people up somewhere. Maybe he was fighting a war. Or he might be traveling. He imagined him crossing the steppes of Asia, sailing across the Atlantic, talking to indigenous people in Africa, or trekking towards the South Pole.
It’s a puzzle, why they should even feel lust. Love must not be enough to ensure procreation of the species, so nature has provided Lust. But neither of them have ever fathered a child. He suspects they are sterile, which actually makes sense. If a creature does not die, why would it need to reproduce?
Rising from his chair, John follows him, stands at the kitchen door watching him run water, rinse the cups, and place them on the drainboard. He turns and faces John, still shirtless.
someone rang the bell downstairs. Any interruption would be welcome, I thought, even if it was a crime lord that Mrs Hudson had forgotten to frisk.
And all at once he sees the flat through Sherlock’s eyes. It truly is awful. Depressing. Soul-killing. He sees the cracks in the ceiling that have never been patched, the stained carpet, the baseboard falling off in the kitchen, revealing mould. The walls haven’t been painted since 1969, he guesses. And whoever chose the colour palette back then, well, maybe it looked more pleasing when it was freshly done.
“I think we should stay together from now on,” he tells Watson. “Just to be sure we don’t lose each other.”
John assumed his Captain Watson Stance: back straight, arms folded across his chest, gaze level. “You need to tell us your name.”
I want to ask him these things. He cares about his brother enough to interfere in his life, but I’m not sure I trust him to bring Sherlock home safely. Faking his death was Sherlock’s idea, I think, but Mycroft seems to have been ready and willing to go along with it. Is he using his brother for his own agenda, hunting down MI6 targets in Eastern Europe? Whose mission is this? I never really understood Mycroft’s involvement in the Moriarty problem; he gave the man information in return for— what?
“Queer,” Holmes pronounced. “Desperately trying to prove he’s straight. Keep an eye on him in the showers, gentlemen.”
I turned from the mirror and looked at him. He was wearing his grey suit, the one that made his eyes appear almost cerulean, and his fair hair shone like burnished gold. Handsome, as always. He is not a vain man excepting where his moustache is concerned. That was freshly waxed, the ends artfully twirled.
“I have an errand for you,” I said with deliberate indifference. “I’d like you to take something back to London, to my brother.”
Mycroft, of course. Sherlock hasn’t said a word about the blind date or anything else about John, but his insufferable brother has no doubt deduced it all. He will have looked up John’s service record, his credentials, and all the details of his marriage. He’s probably surveilling John right now as he walks the few blocks to Tesco.
“I will keep your secret on one condition,” she says. “Stay in touch with me. I’d like to see you from time to time.”
“Every man wants an heir, does he not?” I replied. “It would please my mother to see the family name carried on. I confess that I had not thought about marriage before meeting you, but now, having considered it more thoroughly, I admit that it is a sensible move for a bachelor such as myself. As a woman, you have many natural talents that I lack. You will be the angel who smooths over chaos of my existence, providing an orderly environment for the important work I do. We will, of course, have people to do the laundry and the cooking. My mother will insist. And the children must have a tutor, I suppose. Hm. How many children would you be willing to have? I would not like us to extend ourselves, but if you wish—“
The evening will be awkward if he doesn’t get past this. “I was wounded. Still doing physio. Not sure I can do surgery anymore.” He smiles. “But I’m about ready to consider other options.”
My observations about Edwin, however, were more accurate. He was fat, and apparently was allowed to stuff himself with sweetmeats and biscuits whenever he wanted them. He was also stupid, I learned. I had been reading since the age of three and doing sums since I was four. He was nearly eight, and stumbled through reading the most elementary texts.
She shrugs. “It’s in the second bedroom closet. Help yourself. I’m going to work, so I’ll lock the door behind me. Just make sure it’s closed when you leave.”
And why does a baby care if it’s blue or pink? It’s not as if wearing a pink onesie is going to make a boy gay. He remembers his grandmother telling him how in the Victorian era boys wore dresses until they were “breeched” and started wearing trousers. They even had their hair long, like girls. All babies were basically girls until the father decided they weren’t. It seems a strange thing that now women wear trousers as often as skirts, and nobody says this is crossing the gender line. Meanwhile, men have no choice. A man in a dress is something very different from a woman in trousers.
Afterwards, they pick up some Greek food. At the flat, they serve it onto plates— dolmades and pastitsio— and sit down to eat.
Before he was kicked out of Cambridge, he used to box. He’d enjoyed it, not only because hitting another person can sometimes be satisfying, but because boxing was a metaphor for interactions like this. Difficult conversations. Unpleasant negotiations. The one who strikes first isn’t necessarily the winner. Striking first exposes you, gives your opponent an opening.
Holmes nods. “I solve them. When the police are out of their depth, they come to me.” His eyes flick over Watson. “And you’re my best lead now.”
He made a non-committal sound, unwilling to say just how much he was afraid Greg was right. “Irene’s got her eye on him. If he wants a career, he had better do as she says.” Sherlock glanced at his phone. “It’s about time to head back.”
By now he has realised that few people are worthy of the love he’s been saving for a hypothetical person. It doesn’t matter. He is married to his Work— solving crimes, removing dangerous people from society, making the world a safer, more just place.
“War is futile. I’m sorry it took me so long to learn that lesson. But I only ever killed to save another life.”
“Being able to pick a lock does not necessarily lead to burglary. I’ll take your answer as an affirmative. And I have no problem admitting that I
They eat, making occasional comments about the food. John doesn’t particularly like the salmon, which is dry, but eats every bite on his plate, then looks up and sees that Sherlock has eaten some of the risotto and about half of the fish. He wonders if there was something else on the menu he preferred, but decided to order the same as John to put him at ease. Maybe neither of them really enjoyed the food, which will undoubtedly cost as much as John receives weekly from the government.
Another day, we go to Scotland Yard and see Lestrade. He mentions a weird case, a corpse found in a bathtub wearing only a pair of spectacles. Sherlock smiles. “Tell me your theory.”
Spending time in hospital is something John ought to be used to, but it’s not the kind of experience you can ever just relax and enjoy. In the first place, he doesn’t feel good enough to enjoy the experience. He has a massive bruise on his forehead that explains why his head feels like a tiny man with a pickaxe is trying to mine his way through his skull. Secondly, though he has no job other than sleeping and letting people wake him up to check his vitals and ask him how he’s feeling, it’s both boring and fucking annoying.
If I were going to see a ghost, it would most likely be the ghost of my mother or father, appearing to make sure that I was behaving myself. They hadn’t haunted me though, or even checked on me to see how I was adjusting to Greenwood Hall. If they had, I would have asked them to haunt my cousins. But my parents had never appeared to me from the beyond.
He’s surprised when it’s Watson who faces him. Even more surprising, he’s wearing a vest filled with explosives.
As the newlyweds walk down the aisle, accepting the congratulations of their guests, he stands off to the side, fixing this moment in his mind palace, the moment when John leaves him. He won’t leave entirely, or all at once. There will still be cases, and maybe John will come over sometimes and watch a movie. He will accept these crumbs from John’s table, cede John’s admiration to Mary and the baby.
This time, though, I must be the one to save him. If it meant I must die so that he could live, I would willingly sacrifice myself. This one gift must tell him all the love I could not speak aloud.
I indicated the alcove, concealed by curtains. “The burglar, whose identity we do not know, might have hidden here when he heard someone enter. If he was—“
How is he going to find a boyfriend, have a relationship with a man if he’s too stupidly shy to say what he wants? Maybe he can develop an alter-ego, like a superhero. At night he’ll cruise as a gay man; during the day he’ll be straight. Well, no. That might work for anonymous encounters in the loo, but if he wants
It breaks John’s heart a little to hear Sherlock so hesitant, so unwilling to believe that John is willing to accept him, scars and all. “I don’t hate you.”
Realising that he was about to leave me, I cried, “Victor! You must come back, tell me what you see there! Promise you will!”
The fact that Watson wasn’t willing to ask his brother (okay, it turned out to be a sister) for help only meant that he didn’t want to get dragged into a slough of troubles when he had his own bog to wade through. That, I thought, was sensible.
“Gang stuff, in Dublin. He gave evidence against some pretty big players, and they let him out early. A model prisoner, by all accounts, but definitely psycho. He’s spent the last ten years in and out of psychiatric institutions for stalking various people, including a member of the royal family.”
I think about calling Mike, having lunch or something. He might want to meet me at Barts, though, and I’m not ready to go back there.
Watson shakes his head. “Why wouldn’t I want to eat? Maybe you like to starve yourself when you’re on a case, but—“
Taking my silence as agreement, she continued. “I have in mind several women who would be suitable. You are a passably good-looking man, though no one would call you handsome. And you are my son. If you are bringing in upper class clients, there are families who would find you a suitable son-in-law. Do not call yourself a
“Yes, Watson, I do. At least some of them knew. It has been said that all that is required for evil to flourish is for good people to look the other way.”
It’s easier for John to understand that kind of apathy now. The line between carrying on and giving up is surprisingly thin. Though he hasn’t given up yet, he can see himself waking up one day and knowing in his gut that he’s become his father.
I stood up quickly and pulled away, knocking over the writing table. Taking a step towards the door, I pulled it open and said, “Out.”
The barista used a waxed paper to grab the chocolate thing and placed it on a small plate. “And a cup of…?”
His eyes are fully open now. He doesn’t remember lying down, but he must have fallen asleep on the sofa. Blinking, he tries to sit up. Someone is leaning over him.
The door opened and a dark-haired woman came in carrying a script and a tablet computer, a phone held between her shoulder and ear. “Sorry,” she said, grappling her armful to the table and sliding the phone into the bodice of her dress.
“To be honest, I can’t. Nothing in that picture is consistent with the John Watson I knew. He must have been depressed. That’s all I can…” He huffed a sigh. “To survive, actors learn to play a role even when we’re not filming, to wear a mask in public. John was a trouper, always giving his best. We were both famous before we grew up; we lacked the understanding to cope with the things we were forced to deal with. It’s lonely, suppressing what you really feel, and it’s miserable being told what to do and say all the time, having no privacy. For a sensitive child, an introverted child, it can be torture. He must have suffered.” He looked away. “I’m sure you know my history.”
There was one search he could easily set in motion. He hated calling in favours, but Victor did owe him, and could do the job with much more efficiency than he could do it himself.
He remembers his relief at passing the class, his shame at receiving the lowest possible passing mark. And he did learn a lesson from it all. But he certainly had never considered what he might have learned if he had just accepted Holmes’s offer.
as she generally referred to my moods, my clutter, my odd hours, but at some point, she actually began to develop some fondness for me. I attribute that to Watson’s influence.
“That must be interesting,” Miss Wickham said, turning to inspect her companion, who had found a different spot on the carpet to study. “Have you dissected cadavers, Mr Watson?”
“Mr Holmes, you seem to know a great deal about this business,” said Gregson. “And your boy, I’m sure, must know how to stage a murder properly by now. Working with you, he’d have learned all about that. What I’m wondering is, why did you put him up to it? He’s not your average, innocent young man, is he? He’s got a record, prior arrests. He’ll end up on in line for the hangman. And how will you feel about that? Your favourite, a noose around his neck, the bottom about to drop out—”
Eventually, John does require rescue, and Sherlock berates himself for not noticing that he’d gone missing. If John hadn’t stomped out of the flat, angry because Sherlock wasn’t as concerned about people who had died as he was about the ones he could save, he might have noticed John being abducted by Moriarty.
My life took on a different colour after that adventure. I write these words as an adult, but experienced the events as a child; that is how I remember them. To me, a child, it seemed that life was easier after this; I felt less hunted.
“How did you know her?” It’s one of Molly’s grandchildren asking. She’s not young, probably in her forties, and looks a bit like Molly.
Somehow he hadn’t deduced this, and wasn’t sure what to make of it. There was a line, however blurry, between what a character can feel and what an actor can make people believe. He’d always believed that good actor doesn’t need to feel things in order to make emotions believable. He and John were on stage, they were just acting…John kissed him, held his hand… but it was all part of the emotional climax of the play.
“I haven’t. I’ve been busy with family… stuff this week, and it’s preoccupying me, but I have no wish to go back to Mary. I still have obligations to her and Rosie, though, and always will. Is that what’s bothering you?”
. Watson goes shopping for a new mattress. Holmes makes deductions. Of course they won’t be needing two beds.
“All right,” she said. “Ready?“ The door opened, revealing an average-looking blond bloke wearing a shapeless jumper. “Here’s Richard!”
He remembers grief. The intense pain of the days after he saw Sherlock die on the sidewalk in front of Barts. There are few details he can recall after that moment. It was as if the pain had receded just enough to let him breathe, and a kind of grey fog had descended. Pain, then sorrow.
Holmes looks at his naked body, glistening in the early morning sun. He’s beautiful, like the sun rising. He’s everything. “I’ll make you some tea. You must be hungry too.”
“If you want to see it, I can give you the info,” Anderson said. “I only saw a few parts, ones he showed me. Maybe that’s all that exists. The animation is impressive. You can tell it’s John, though. It was shot when he was seventeen. I don’t know why his manager let him do it. Maybe Magnussen was blackmailing him. Jesus, John was just a kid. He must have reached a point where he couldn’t do it anymore.”
I could see his resolve wavering. For a long minute he stood, staring at the veil of water. Then, nodding, he took his leave and set out down the path. After a few steps, he suddenly turned back, threw his arms around my neck and kissed me. “Be safe, Holmes.”
Sherlock sits back, a bitter little smile on his face. “First, I blamed my parents, who didn’t understand me at all, and my brother for being perfect where I was clearly a disaster. I blamed the people who introduced me to drugs. I blamed myself because… well. I am who I am. The drugs were… the wrong solution. Temporary escape, and they drove my brother mad as well. Those were the benefits. The disadvantages were many.” Turning, he stares out the window. His face, reflected in the window, is solemn, even melancholy.
Feeling at loose ends, he hailed a cab and gave the driver his address. Home wasn’t where he wanted to be, but he hadn’t any better ideas. Greg and Mike had both taken off after the rehearsal, each of them with plans for the evening. Though Sherlock rarely accepted social invitations, he almost wished he had somewhere else to go.
“True,” Holmes replies. “But I would guess that in any group of adolescents, you will find self-harmers. Boys were doing it when we—“ He stops, lets out an impatient sigh. “But you’re right, we should look at any signs of stress in the boys.”
You’re a doctor. It must be embarrassing for a man who has dedicated his life to saving people to feel so ready to put a bullet in his brain.
Not all of them are named Rosamund, of course, but that’s who they are. They’re growing up, changing their names, reconciling with their Mums, going to university and choosing careers. Mycroft set up a scholarship fund for them. He enjoys being an uncle more than either of us expected. And I enjoy being a dad. John, of course, is a wonderful father.
“Do control yourself, Sherlock. I’m merely suggesting that it’s not a good practice to have clients living here.”
She stopped attacking my hair with the comb and looked into my face. “You must not talk so. And do not mention ghosts. Not unless you want to be sent away.”
“That would be unfortunate, and reflect badly on you for letting the real murderer go. Even more unfortunate because my client would have to be named in your report, and that would ruin her reputation, the very thing we are all trying to avoid. And you have not enough evidence to arrest anyone. No, Lestrade, there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. Let it go.”
“Not yet. Just dating a bit. Had a crisis when I learned the wife was having an affair with the kids’ P.E. teacher. Yeah, it was Sherlock who told me. Deduced it, I guess.” He shakes his head. “The way I combed my hair or something.”
“Terrible!” I stopped walking, turned to face him. “Did my clergyman costume not fool you? I recall a moment of doubt on your face that time— do not deny it!”
He gives Watson a stupid grin. “Well, it worked last time. Apparently this ward has different rules.”
“Don’t overdo the sociopath thing,” Lestrade said, lowering his voice. “And we don’t talk about the reunion. They haven’t released anything on it yet, and with the state it’s in now, that might not happen soon. Or ever.”
She nodded. “I think his mother pushed him too much. A lot of people in the business pushed him, once they saw that he could make them money. They would have taken everything from him and dropped him as soon as he was too old to play those roles. I bet he hated all those stupid teen movies.”
Boys didn’t much like him, though. He had his growth spurt while most of his classmates were still small and coordinated. While he tripped over his own feet and walked into things, boys scoffed at him and girls giggled. He was a freak, they decided.
He makes himself a cup of tea in Harry’s kitchen. It’s very neat, no dishes in the sink, no rotting food in the fridge. The small table is wiped clean, no clutter of unpaid bills or unwashed dishes.
). If he were honest with himself, though, it had much more to do with that nosy, meddling wizard, Sherlock.
“Oh, John,” I groaned. “Don’t go.” I sat up and glared down at him. “I refuse to accept your resignation.”
But the pain was still there, a tender spot in his memory, and most days he still felt defeated. Mary helped, though, and he thought that if she stayed, everything would be easier. He didn’t need to explain; she understood. He could keep the memories at bay when she was around.
“It’s all right, Watson,” I said. “No need for threats. Mr Milverton is leaving now. Please assist him with his coat.”
Doctor Gurung is still talking. “These are all typical behaviours, not necessarily permanent. His brain has experienced trauma, and that may take some time to heal. The frontal lobe…”
“We both know that’s not true. You do in fact have a heart, which I intend to burn out of you. Obviously you’ll still be alive, but imagine what it will be like.”
Mycroft is waiting for me. That’s his patient face, I suppose. Time to go. I nod and get to my feet. Guess I got lost in my thoughts there, for just a moment, thinking about you, trying to remember everything we did together, everything you ever said to me. If I had a Mind Palace, I’d make a room for each day we had together, from breakfast toast to midnight violin.
He could do it, while they’re standing here on the tarmac. He could lean over and kiss John. He’s always wanted to do that. Yes, he does want John that way.
, but when he explained to her that he couldn’t be in love with a woman because he was gay, she stopped making sad eyes at him. Now they’re friends.
One could set a clock by Watson’s habits, I thought as I heard the feet pause at the door, a sudden intake of breath.
Once, many years earlier, we had talked about sailing to New York, seeing America. Then there was the war, and Watson’s last wife died, and I had not yet solved the puzzle. The crime, as Mycroft had called it.
“I couldn’t, John. You’re my pressure point. If I had told you, I have no doubt that you’d be dead now.”
What he feels for Sherlock is completely different. He’s flattered, of course, to be wanted. But he has a choice, and that makes all the difference. With Mary, he felt trapped and tried to tell himself it was all fine. He’s not trapped now; he wants Sherlock, and will do whatever it takes to make their relationship stronger.
“It’s nobody else’s business,” John says. “I’m sorry you were offended, but frankly, I didn’t want to talk to her at all, let alone inform her that I’m sleeping with my flatmate.”
I gave a careless shrug. Wherever we went, it might not be the holiday he was imagining. “Name the place. We can take a train in the morning and catch the ferry at Newhaven.”
He was never malicious, but quickly took a dislike to my cousins, especially when he saw them abuse me. After one such incident, where Edwin overturned my porridge onto the floor and I was punished for clumsiness by being sent to my room hungry, John came to me that night and bade me follow him. He entered Edwin’s room and glowered over the bed, making his spectre larger and more grotesque, and moaning in a breathy voice.
I don’t know if I can stand it. Having that one pill means that I have a momentary escape. One night of Sherlock, alive and real.
When exhaustion finally claims him, he’s standing in front of his brother’s house in Pall Mall. Though Mycroft is the last person he wants to see, he rings the bell.
“Lestrade is investigating. If we’re gone for a few days, well— there are these things called phones—“
There is no Belstaff hanging by the door. A blue scarf is folded neatly over the back of his chair. (How many of those did you have?) I can’t bear to think what is in the bedroom. Socks neatly indexed, shirts dropped on the floor. Clothing that smells of expensive cologne and stolen cigarettes. A bed I never slept in.
He met Victor Trevor at Cambridge. Victor was tall, good-looking, athletic, and very social. Everyone liked him. Sherlock had always avoided popular people because they usually weren’t very nice people. But Victor was friendly, and didn’t seem to care if other people thought Sherlock peculiar. They were lab partners in chemistry, and Victor, not having a very scientific mind, was always appreciative of Sherlock’s explanations. They began to spend time together. Sometimes Victor would come over for help with his assignments. Afterwards, they might go get something to eat, or just talk.
“It isn’t that simple, Harry. This isn’t a phase, something I’m going to grow out of. I can’t just—“
My problem was, in fact, a lack of problems to solve. Lestrade’s cases were all dull, tedious people killing other tedious people by ordinary means, for obvious reasons. At least, it was obvious to me. I preferred the unusual, the fantastic, the indecipherable, and (when my pocketbook allowed) worked only cases that stimulated my brain.
It was ten years since we’d met. I was surprised to feel sentimental about it, and a bit disappointed that he did not. “No occasion. I just felt like an evening out.”
, and Miss Ashton-Farbridge was obliged to play piano accompaniment to my violin. I played some gypsy airs, knowing that my mother hates them.
It was a perpetual mystery why females flocked to me with their problems. I had never provided a comfortable shoulder to cry on, as Watson did. I cast a glance at him; though he was short, he had manly shoulders and a handsome profile. Perhaps the ladies came for his shoulder, not mine. His stories in
was of documents relating to our client, to protect her from blackmail. Perhaps that is a crime, technically, but Milverton’s many crimes have gone unpunished for years. Is it any surprise that one of his victims struck back, taking the revenge that the law denied her?”
Over the next few days, he thought about what she’d said. It didn’t really surprise him that Martha Hudson had seen his affection for John, but Molly always seemed oblivious. He hated being so transparent that even she could see his feelings, not when he had worked so hard at being impervious to sentiment. Actors needed to be able to believably counterfeit all sorts of feelings. He didn’t identify with Alex Tribble, never had, but he was just a kid then, and nobody expects kids to be great actors.
Matt pushes the cup aside. “Oh, he wasn’t a friend. None of us had never seen him before, but I didn’t think anything of it. There’s always people I don’t know on Wednesdays. When I saw you talking to him, I thought,
He’d always accepted that loving your parents (and even your brother) was necessary, if only because you had to share a house with them, and saying you didn’t love them would have been awkward, and might have meant fewer biscuits and less cake, things he liked very much.
, though, and it takes about fifteen minutes to convince her that I had a wonderful time, yes, I’m going to be seeing him again, and no, I don’t need any tea.
He remembers fixing it in his mind, the moment when he was John Watson’s best friend, when that was all he ever thought he could be. He loved John, and didn’t ask for anything more. He always meant to save John, to keep him and Rosie safe. Protecting them, loving them, was all he wanted.
Now, though, he’s curled on his side, breathing shallowly, and I picture him in that awful hotel, ill and afraid, ready to jump up and run at the slightest threat. I’ll have to be careful not to startle him.
“We’re talking dates now, so don’t go and commit yourself to anything over the next month,” she said.
“I realise that.” She frowns. “But we’re still a family, two parents raising a child, and we need to work on that. We might get some advice on dealing with her, and maybe coax her into coming with us eventually. I think if you suggested it, she might agree.”
But now, seeing it with the eyes of someone who doesn’t live here, he realises. Not a single person has visited him here besides Sherlock. It’s not a home. It’s just a place to eat and sleep and keep his stuff. He’s never felt glad coming into these rooms. He’s never looked forward to arriving home, the comfort of a familiar place. Sherlock is right. It’s dystopian. It’s awful.
“This time, almost dying was different. I was lying in that alley, hoping you would find me, and I realised that I was about to lose my chance to tell you how I felt. I’d been thinking about it, but had always assumed you weren’t interested. I knew I was dying because I could tell where I’d been hit. I didn’t have much time. I remember hearing feet running towards me, and saw you kneeling down beside me, felt that you were putting pressure on the wound. I couldn’t feel much of anything by then, but that didn’t terrify me as much as not being able to say it. But I was just too far gone. I couldn’t get the words out.
But I had trouble deducing him. There are people, like my brother, who are able to spot a gay person at a hundred yards. This is called gay-dar. For all my observational skill, I do not possess this ability. While I could spot Afghanistan and the alcoholic sibling and the psychosomatic limp, I could not tell whether he fancied men or women. He looked at both with equal interest. Bisexual, perhaps. He did tell Mrs Hudson that
In many ways, Watson sees the Priory School as a rougher neighbourhood than the one where he grew up. Privileged boys vying for power, encouraged to be ruthless; adults looking the other way, accepting it as part of adolescence. Outside of the playing field, the rules are unclear. How far can one go to gain that power?
feeling he’d had all afternoon. “I think she’s one of those child stars who will always look back on
Holmes gave a sigh and sank into his chair. “Watson, I don’t know if I have any more deductions in me.”
The applause was deafening. They held one another, oblivious to the chaos around them. The curtain finally went down, then came back up. Hands were grabbed, and they all stepped forward for the bow. Irene came on stage, taking a bow with Molly, then Anderson and Sally, Mike and Greg, Mrs Hudson by herself, and finally, he and John stepped forward. He didn’t let go of John’s hand, and as they acknowledged the bedlam in the theater, they caught each other’s eyes and smiled again.
“Why?” I whisper this because I’m afraid. Whatever he says might be the last words I ever hear him say. He will say them and walk away. I have no idea how to stop that from happening.
When he finally took acting lessons, he learned that actors were encouraged to identify a character’s inner motivations, to live those emotions through the character. It was all rubbish. He made people believe his characters without involving his own feelings because he was good. He knew what expressions to put on, what movements his character should make because he paid attention. He observed. He’d done it since he was a small child, trying to figure out other children, who seemed more like aliens to him (ironic, now that he thought about it). People might have called him a mimic, but it didn’t matter, did it, if they believed what he showed them?
“Holmes!” cried the man, seizing my hand. “It’s been years! I see you are making a name for yourself, quite deservedly.”
“People marry for reasons other than—“ Sherlock stops, appearing to realise he is going in a direction that can only lead to bad feelings. “Sorry, not a fair question. Better: When did you know that you loved her?”
Watson’s gaze travels over the clutter again, fasten on the empty eyes of a skull looking down from the mantelpiece.
“Lost.” He sank down into his chair. “Poor thing, I think she was counting on it. She’s never had much, but to be teased with the possibility of wealth, only to have it vanish, was a great disappointment. When she saw the box was empty, she was stunned. I told her she was no worse off than she’d been when she first learned of it, but that did not console her. That is why I’m so late; I stayed until she was less distraught.”
“That’s fortunate. We must hope that she does indeed forget you. Women sometimes carry grudges, you know.”
Nobody bothered much with me after my mother died. I was fed and bathed and dressed and put into bed at night, but no one sat and read to me, or took me for walks, or answered my questions.
Giving him a severe look, Molly continued. “The studio has approved the script, provided we can find an actor—”
He laughed. “You are hard-headed, Will, and quite ridiculous. I hope you will keep your word, and not forget me while you are sailing around, plundering and looting.”
Snorting in exasperation, he slid his phone back into his pocket. No sooner had he returned his attention to hailing a cab when another alert sounded.
But if Mary moves and takes her away, he might. Can she do that? He has legal rights— maybe it’s time to get an attorney. He can see why Rosie is upset, too. To move away from what she knows, to a new school, a new country— for a kid, that’s hard. He’ll have to confront Mary about it, see what she’s thinking. It won’t be an easy conversation to have, but if he’s about to be blind-sided, he wants to know.
“Molly is the least observant person I know.” Remembering what she revealed on her recent visit, he might reconsider this assessment. Perhaps Brook was just another sad charity case she’d adopted. “She dates psychopaths on a regular basis.”
“No. It has chicken and… you know… things. Parsnips. Or carrots. Vegetable things. And you cook it in wine.”
, reassuring her that he would marry, and then blithely stepped around all the women she put in his path. I also am quite sure he suggested that I would be a much better candidate than he, and she saw both the futility of marrying him off and the possibility that I, being younger, might more easily be influenced. Our mother is hard-headed, but she respects diplomacy. She enjoys the challenge of bending people to her will.
I snatched it from her hand, annoyed that in my agitation, I had missed something so obvious. “Where did you find it?”
She smiles mildly, without judgment. “You seem preoccupied.” Maybe they could program robots to do this job, giving encouraging nods, saying things that probe with a smile, timing the silence and breaking in with another question when it’s been long enough. Somebody could do that, he thinks.
“And I need you, John. Always.” He draws the bow across the strings, a long, sweet note. “It’s why I married you.”
“Were we?” Until rehab, he’d never spent much time with people who weren’t involved in television. He didn’t know what he would have become if he’d led a normal life, away from public scrutiny. That was why he still came to Molly’s reunions, he realised. It was why he’d agreed to do this for her— not because he could extend his contract for
Back upstairs, I find Sherlock asleep. He doesn’t lie sprawled out across the bed, as he used to. Not that I’ve ever slept with him, but flatmates learn these things about one another. He’s a sprawler, by nature.
Watson’s breath catches. “That’s him. I remember now. Michael was his name, or that’s what he called himself.”
There are things that Sherlock does which he knows make people angry. He’s been careful not to do too many of these things— especially regarding the kitchen and bathroom. He’s tried to be thoughtful of his flatmate, sensitive to anything that might make him change his mind about living with Sherlock.
“For all that I am twenty-six and single, I do have some standards. You are clearly seeking a convenient wife to provide you with the appearance of a respectable life. I will not marry for convenience, sir. Your mother has demanded that you propose to me. Very well, you have fulfilled that obligation.”
Watson looked up from his novel and frowned. “I thought you were done with that case,” he said, smiling. “I’ve taken the liberty of writing it up in a little brochure I’ve given the somewhat fantastical title,
Molly, passing out the revised script, frowned. “This is just a read-through. I’m sure we’ll make some adjustments.” She took her place and smiled at the group. “I want to thank you all for your willingness to do this. It means a lot to our fans. Mike, I know you haven’t been in front of a camera for a while, and I appreciate you stepping back into the spotlight.”
They’re still holding onto each other, and John leans in, lays his head against Sherlock’s chest. “But I’m not confused. Or concussed, or delirious. I just finally realised.”
I suppose that explains my initial attraction to him. He had grown into a handsome man, with the kind of face women trusted. Women always flirted with Watson. I was used to it.
Closing my eyes, I leaned into him. “A year ago I was in Tibet, thinking of when I might see you again. I imagined you here, at Baker Street, with a querulous wife, one child and another on the way.”
Watson had reached the fence and thrown himself at it. Being a half foot shorter than me, he struggled to reach the horizontal rail.
The affair, which (as he discovered) hadn’t ended, was what sent John out the door. Anything was better than accepting her infidelity. He’d been faithful to her while he was overseas, even in the face of temptation. He returned to a wife who resented him and a daughter who had grown into an adolescent without him.
As he watched the two of them, tears gathered in his eyes. Embarrassing, to be nostalgic about something he had been so eager to leave behind. He’d never had a friend before, and didn’t know how to act. When he realised with horror that he had a
His fist coming at my jaw was one moment in time. Lying on my back, looking up at the sky was another. I do not remember the moment in between. Reaching up, I felt the side of my face. He had not hit my jaw, but further up, near the temple. I assumed this was why I felt dizzy.
Sherlock grumbles, but accepts this. He reminds John that they need milk. And chocolate biscuits. And he should stop at Barts, pick up a goodie bag from Molly.
I wrapped my own dressing gown closer. A bit more harshly than I’d intended, I replied, “What do you want?”
John pulls him into the room. “This is the man,” he says to the guests. “Mike Stamford. He’s responsible for me and Sherlock.”
Lady Eva Blackwell was one such unfortunate. She was engaged to be married, only to have a past love affair, documented in letters best characterised as “sprightly,” come into a blackmailer’s hands. Her intended, the Earl of Dovercourt, would break their engagement if he were to to learn of these letters. And she might forestall this event merely by paying a sum of money. Instead, she came to me for help.
Perhaps he and Watson are the lucky ones, the ones who will never need enlightenment. There may have been others like them who went into stasis and never returned. Stasis is nothingness, not enlightenment. It’s a process, not a destination, a cycle that repeats, pulling him from the edge of Death.
“Not silly. You’ve never met me. Don’t you want to spend time with me?” She turned, smiling at me. “What’s your name?”
The incident stays with him for a few days, but gradually he resumes his daily pattern, if it can be called that.
“Not at all. Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade that at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking. He went to prison for two years, but avoided the death penalty. He’s grateful, hence the free food.”
, he thinks. He’s been waiting for something to happen, something that will change him. Harry’s right.
“Why do you stay, John?” I had wondered this since I brought his bones to my flat. “Not all ghosts remain among the living. My father and mother died, and Victor died, but I never see their ghosts. Have you no family to haunt?”
“I saw your performance last night. You looked… happy. I couldn’t recall the last time I saw you like that. It’s a good look on you. And I thought that maybe your happiness should be more important to me.”
“John.” The relief he felt was dizzying. For a moment all he could do was hold on to John, making small, embarrassing whimpers. But there was more he needed to understand, things he need to tell John. “You came back here, to London. I thought I was imagining things that night I got into your cab. I couldn’t figure out why you seemed familiar.”
John has put on his obstinate face. “I’m not going to introduce you to anyone, especially my ex-wife, as my
“It’s all a battlefield, you bloody fool. Try seeing it through the eyes of someone who wants to rape, murder, or otherwise harm his fellow humans. I’ve stood at too many crime scenes to see it as anything else. Nobody expects to be attacked. You might’ve been—“ He breaks off, clearly angry.
“No, he was terrible. But you— you are impressive.” There is awe in Sherlock’s voice. And affection. “I’m not sure it’s poetic to head-butt a murderer, but it’s… something. Justice, for sure. Absolutely idiotic and extremely lucky— and undeniably heroic. For that, you deserve an epic, my hard-headed hero. A paean in dactylic hexameter.
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. It was October, a wet day when even inside the house with a fire burning brightly in the hearth, a bone-deep chill took me, driving me into my favourite hiding-place, the window-seat of the library.
Once we arrived, I demanded to see Watson alone. This brought protests from Gregson, the other Inspector involved. “He’ll tell him what to say.”
The light hurts, but he opens his eyes, sees another set of eyes, opalescent, studying him. He’s leaning over John, his mouth just a bit too close to Watson’s ear.
Holmes follows him inside and up to his flat. John thinks about getting ahead and shutting the door in his face, but he is still a bit pissed and isn’t sure he can outstep the git.
remember, wouldn’t you, Watson? You used to be at the butt end of his many deductions.” He gives an unpleasant laugh. “I see that he was right about you as well.”
I saw Victor, too. He was not a ghost, but as I remembered him, sitting by the fire at Milford, warming his feet and asking me about pirates.
, the people who did all the things behind the scenes so that when viewers turned on the telly on Friday night, they would see their favourite alien and all his friends having another adventure. If all he could have was a few hours a week, a few weeks out of the year where John pretended to be his best friend, he would take that. The show would end, eventually, and they would both move on.
. It was the Argument from Ignorance. All Sherlock had was handful of clues that might look suspicious, but could have perfectly reasonable explanations.
She’s shaking her head. “I’m not. Think about it this way: if that boy had identified you as something else— if he’d said you were stupid or uncoordinated— those things might have rankled you, but you wouldn’t accept them as destiny, would you?”
At first I just stared. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see lights outside the house now. “Watson, I can’t leave you! They’ll try you for murder!“
But this. This is something new, and he can’t quite grasp its dimensions. It feels huge, and yet he can almost hold it in his hand. He wants it in a way he hasn’t ever experienced. Before, with other people, it was always one-sided, like a fantasy he kept playing in his mind. There was never an outlet for such feelings, so they remained as pure desire, never evolving into love.
I hung my coat next to John’s, thinking about how to make this happen. I’d planned several possible scenarios. Talking about feelings is something I do only awkwardly and with extreme reluctance. It made sense to be strategic about important conversations, but all the openings I’d imagined now seemed silly and doomed to fail.
is poetry— in its most elemental form. This is beauty and poetry and romance and every bit of philosophy I need.”
Once in their own space, a slightly larger, nicer dormitory room with its own ensuite, Holmes paces around restlessly, ignoring Watson, who is hanging up his trousers in the small wardrobe.
I smirked. “The case we are currently working on is for one of the royal houses of Europe. I cannot reveal the client’s identity, but I will be paid well when I have fulfilled his charge to me.”
“I have never been to a school,” I replied calmly. “May I not learn something about this school? I will be happy to study, and only ask what subjects are taught there.”
John looks at his watch. “I’ll be back in about an hour, and then we can talk about... everything. Is that all right?”
They are lucky that forensic science was still in a primitive state. The ability to match a bullet to a particular gun depended on the improvement of magnification, and did not come into forensic use until the early 20th century. The use of fingerprints in criminal investigations was beginning at this time, but it wasn’t until 1901 that Scotland Yard established its first Fingerprint Bureau. Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon, had published a paper on it in 1880, but when he tried to sell Scotland Yard on the idea, he was rejected.
Finally I let Mrs Hudson change the sheets on his bed and open the windows, airing the room out. All his things are in boxes now. It’s been over a year, after all. She suggests that I could take his bedroom, that she could call Mycroft about removing the boxes. When I say no, she just smiles sadly and pats my hand. “I understand, dear.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Still, you’re asking me to believe the word of a person I don’t know. Eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable, likely to imagine details that never happened. Three years is a long time to keep a secret. No doubt your friend’s memories were enhanced by his guilt. He made assumptions, was told to forget what he’d seen, but couldn’t. The suicide made him reconsider what he saw, see it through a new lens. It provided an answer for the questions he couldn’t ask. Now it’s his word against Magnussen’s. Since I don’t know either of them—“
He pictures the man who limped towards him across the restaurant wearing an ill-fitting suit, obviously his best. He remembers how he’d held his head high, his posture straight in spite of needing to lean on the cane. Only his eyes betrayed his distress.
“I doubt that. You’re drunk, though not nearly as disgusting as the last time I walked you home, and you’re wearing tight jeans and a leather vest that says,
Watson doesn’t respond. What can he say? It’s true that he has blamed Holmes. He still hasn’t forgiven him for what he did, and even though it was his own choice to stoically ignore him instead of punching out his lights, there might have been other things he could have done. But he was sixteen. It might have felt good to hit that smug face, but he couldn’t afford to get kicked out of school; it would have meant giving up.
Loving John has never been a choice for Sherlock, but if a time machine were to drop him back in the lab at Barts again on the 29
He tells her about Watson, how badly misses him. More accurately, he grieves him. The story of how they met, oh so long ago now, makes her smile. It’s good to talk about it, but it doesn’t ease the pain of his heart. She understands that kind of pain. It’s what Life is made of, love and loss.
Sherlock sighs and looks out the window. It’s starting to get dark, the street lights coming on. “I haven’t much experience in this… this kind of thing. Dating. Romance. But I’m willing to try.”
He says goodbye. “Thank you. You were more than a friend to me. You mattered.” He remembers her that day in the morgue, the days he spent in her flat, recovering. She didn’t have to do any of that for him. She must have loved him, though it’s hard to understand why.
“Very well,” I began. “As you are aware, being police officers and all that entails, Charles Augustus Milverton was a notorious blackmailer. He made outrageous demands upon those unfortunate enough to be caught in his web, and those who could not pay became examples, inspiring other victims to borrow money from any sources possible, in order to pay rather than be exposed. We can regard as fools those people who might leave evidence for this predator to find, but the truth is that the blackmailer’s ammunition doesn’t have to be credible to be believed. There is no standard for the evidence he uses to extort money; I suspect that much of Milverton’s was fabricated. There is no court that can help these victims.”
My cough is better after a few days, and I walk to the shops to get some milk for my tea. Mrs Hudson would do it, but she’s visiting her sister. I wonder why her sister never comes to London. At any rate, Mrs H is not my housekeeper. She only picks up milk from the shop if she’s going there anyway. Or if she feels sorry for me. I know she does feel sorry most of the time, but I don’t like to take advantage of that.
“Henry,” says Holmes. “If you tell us what you know, you can help us protect your friends. No one will hurt you for telling.”
dying. Hence my imagination, supplying the cross wife and fretful babies. Instead, you went away. I’m glad I didn’t know. My work wasn’t yet done, and you are such a stubborn idiot that you wouldn’t have stayed here even if my ghost had risen up and begged you.”
Two weeks. His sense of time is certainly off. Another side effect of sentiment. It stretches time and it deletes it. Well, thank god he’s past all that.
Sherlock responded, remarking that their first kiss happened when they were twelve, in the infirmary at school after John was hurt playing rugby.
Sherlock makes a scoffing sound. “No. You might say I’m married to my work. No time for—“ He seems to realise what his words are suggesting. “My habits are rather retiring.”
“They did not care for me. The Bible says we are to love our enemies; they took me in, but did not love me, though I am their nephew. They resented me.”
“I’m trying.” You’re crying too, the tears leaving tracks in the grime on your face. “I didn’t think it would take so long. I’m so tired, John. I couldn’t bring you with me, but every night I imagine you, and sometimes you’re here, like this, talking to me. These are the dreams that keep me going, that let me pretend I can come back to you someday, that you’ll open your arms and take me back. I want this to be real. I’ve loved you so long, John. But sometimes it’s so hard, I just want to lie down and not get up.”
His voice is almost a whisper as he looks down and replies, “Very good.” It’s as if he’s ashamed to boast. Ashamed of the man he’s become. Afraid that no one will ever believe who he used to be.
“We’re working on a history of the place, a series of commemorative essays. You know, one of those anniversary things. You’re writing it, and I’m helping you do research. Part of our project will be to interview boys about their experiences. We can expand the parameters of our research as we uncover new clues. For example, we might say we’re looking at some of the clubs and societies that have existed there. We can suggest that secret societies have been part of the school’s history.”
“I just want the audience to see that Holly is still pining for Alex,” she said somewhat stiffly. “It’s a shorthand way of saying it without
“How did I learn English?” he’d asked the director. “If I’ve just arrived on Earth, how would I know anything about its culture or languages? And wouldn’t it have taken me hundreds of years to reach this planet, considering that the nearest star with potentially habitable planets—“
They’re graduate students, they explain. Matt’s studying film-making and Christopher is in medical school, training at Barts. He seems a bit older than Matt, but it might just be that he’s more serious.
She frowned. “You misunderstand me, Mr Holmes. There is nothing you can do to woo me. I will not change my mind, not in a month, not in a year. I do not wish to marry you.”
The rest of the evening went well. I managed to talk John onto the sofa and into a James Bond movie. And gay stuff.
“So… will you? Move in with me, I mean. Or if you don’t like Baker Street, perhaps we can find something bigger, more private.”
My parents died when I was young, but not too young to remember them. My mother, always a frail woman, drew her last breath when I was four. Diphtheria, they said. I was not allowed to see her until she lay in her coffin. Her eyes were closed then, the eyes that were so similar to my own, her dark, curly hair shorn because of the fever. They had put an embroidered cap on her head, which seemed odd to my childish self. I reached for it, wanting her to take it off, since she had never before worn such a cap. She was my mother, but not.
“I was only thinking of you.” Mycroft is not looking at Sherlock. He takes a biscuit and nibbles at it as if that were the thing he’s focused on. He doesn’t do apologies; those are for the losing side, and Mycroft will never admit that he’s lost. But he is feeling something. It shows in his studied avoidance. He raises his cup to his lips and takes a sip before speaking. “Emotions are not your area, and I did not want to see you relive things that we’d all rather forget.”
“I’ve got a few guest spots lined up. Cop shows, mainly.” He grinned. “Don’t look at me like that. I don’t mind being typecast if it means having a job. Crime dramas always do well, at least for a few years.”
“I see your point. But I do rather hope that you’ll move a few of your things over. In fact, I hope you’ll stay, even when the tea and toast are gone and we have to start going to the shops or starve. I’ve never had a flatmate, so I can’t give you testimonials, and I do have some vices you should know about.”
Miss Chadwick smiled vacantly at Watson. “Mr Hughes knows all about the poets, and yet has never written me a poem. Can you imagine?”
He nodded. “I went once a week for my entire first year at uni. After that I got a job as a lab assistant, but I still sometimes went if I was short of funds.” He shook his head. “I just never thought about there being someone out there who might call me
” My hand trembled; I did not dare read what the note said until I was alone. “Leave me now. I’ll bring the tray down when I’m done.”
“Ten years,” she said. “Four years later, I read an advertisement in the Times, asking for my address, and on the advice of Mrs Forrester, I responded. That same day I received a large pearl; a similar pearl has been sent to me each year since then.” She opened a small box, revealing six fine, lustrous pearls of great size. “Today I received a letter asking me to meet the sender at the Lyceum Theatre tonight.”
“You were an addict?” It’s hard to picture the man sitting opposite him, a man with so many advantages, as a junkie. He has money, family, intelligence. He’s good-looking in an odd, striking way. He’s interesting, even compelling. Brilliant at many things. The kind of person you might meet once in your life. “How did that happen?”
What the pants conceal— well, barely conceal— is what Sherlock had deduced from his walk. John is not a small man.
.” She took a step towards him, hands clenched at her sides. “It’s not a script you can rewrite. Some of us have to live it every day.” Her smile was bitter. “Lucky you. You can just work out how you’re going to play it, and once that’s sorted, you can move on to the next script, the next role.”
It wasn’t the kind of role he actually wanted, but it was the means to an end. Mike had gone to some trouble to get him the audition, so he felt he needed to behave.
. I hoped to see him again, but knew that as long as his bones lay among the trees at Greenwood, he would not roam far from that earthly place
was that unexpected guest, her meticulous tidying did nothing to help my investigation. The flat presented me with no evidence, no epiphanies, no deductions.
Another nod. Suddenly he raises his face, his eyes meeting Watson’s. “You won’t tell anyone, will you?”
Sherlock went to Cambridge; John went to make movies— teen romances. Four silly meet-cutes, all popular with their target audience, none of them worth anything. He played Romeo in a touring production, guest-starred on popular series, appeared on talk telly to promote his latest projects.
“You’ve killed people. Or have you forgotten that, Captain Watson? You carried a gun, and you used it.”
Anderson sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know how much any of the actors knew. They must have been aware that the film was going to push boundaries. The rogue version that’s still floating around is supposedly from a private copy Magnussen made for himself. Maybe he was going to tone it down before releasing it. In any case, his legal trouble eventually forced him to abandon the whole project. He’s still in the business, thanks to all the dirt he has on people who might otherwise out him.”
John had done all right on the rugby fields, though already too small at sixteen to be a power player. He wishes sometimes that he’d been a late bloomer and put on a few inches at uni. He wishes he didn’t have a limp and a shoulder that sometimes makes him hunch over in pain.
That’s the moment where the final problem begins, the game you were so eager to win. If I keep going, it will end with you dead on the sidewalk, and I can’t go there. I rewind, go back to a day without phones buzzing. The two of us, sitting in comfortable silence, just before everything begins to fall apart.
Sherlock is so shocked that he doesn’t even register the tears that are coursing down his cheeks. He blinks, and John is there, looking at him.
You’re wearing a tattered jacket, a knit hat pulled down over your forehead. A few dark curls peak out at your neckline and a patchy beard is just beginning to fill in. You look thin and tired.
“You are mistaken. She is indeed at home. Or at least I hope so. Her presence is necessary to the success of my plan.”
Recording his own reflection had been harder for Sherlock than he expected. He had been asked to talk about the friendship of Alex and Jason.
“You see that pretty face,” Donovan says. “You see that gorgeous arse, and you’re amazed that he’s even interested in you. He knows how to get what he wants.”
The decision is easy. He stands on the ledge for a moment, surveying the city where he has lived so long, the familiar skyline he loves. It will be years before he comes back. Closing his eyes, he tips over the edge. This fall is swift. He does not remember the landing.
He liked Martha, who had treated all of her young costars like adults, never lording her experience over them or giving them advice. She might play grandmothers now, but she was still razor-sharp and a complete pro. Her career took off when she was cast in
. Quite an upstanding citizen, as most believe, but with a rather risky habit of visiting male brothels. His written description of their encounters— yes, it was more than once— might sell well. I’m sure I could find a few buyers if they don’t interest you.” He laughed again. “ Are you truly surprised? Perhaps you don’t know your doctor as well as you think. At any rate, in exchange for writing up his adventures with your boy, I will allow this person to pursue his political career without fear of exposure. You can purchase these documents for the price I have stated and pursue your own career, such as it is, keeping your own secrets safe. It is always satisfying to kill two birds with one stone.”
“Here’s what I think, John. You need to communicate better with Sherlock— talk more often, even if you have to make appointments to do that. Tell him what you want, how you feel. If you’re not sure how to do this, we can work on it.”
The nurse appears in the doorway. “Time to give your husband a goodnight kiss, Mr Holmes!” she says cheerfully.
“You are lacking your usual energy.” I whacked the crop on the arm of my chair, just to see him startle. “Come here, Watson.”
Maybe he’d made Alex vulnerable because that was part of him, too. He was a solitary boy, often feeling himself as different from other people. Over the years, that had not changed, even if he’d become a better actor, able to put on different personas. Revisiting Alex Tribble felt like resurrecting something from his past, something he’d tried hard to bury. He might be a better actor, but inside, he was still an awkward alien surrounded by people who didn’t have to act.
Watson tightened his grip on my waist. “When you went over the falls, is that what you were thinking? Did you know that I would miss you, that I wouldn’t be able to stand a world without you?”
It’s not a good idea, I realise. I still think of Sherlock every day. Sometimes I run through my fantasy when I lie down to sleep, picturing us in our chairs, comfortable in our silence. I imagine there are no text messages asking him to
It was a side of himself that he’d always known was there, but it wasn’t something he had ever brought out into the light and examined. He liked women, so he dated them. But he looked at men. Was that normal?
when it came out, used to watch. Sherlock is so good in that— it made me homesick to watch him.” He nudged Sherlock. “Yeah, I had a big crush on you. Sometime during the second season I started thinking about returning. I didn’t know if we could even be friends, but I wanted to see him. So I moved to London under an assumed name. I was driving a cab to make money, and one night he hopped into my cab.”
He was quiet then. The only reason I hadn’t shared my plan with him was that I didn’t yet have one. In the silence, I was aware of him tidying up, preparing for our visitor. Though I had initially rejected the idea of burgling Milverton’s house, Watsons’ suggestion, combined with his lock-picking skills, had made me reconsider.
“No. And I never stayed in one place for long after I left. If I stayed, people decided I was an evil spirit. For a long time, I believed it too.”
“He might have some problems with short-term memory,” she says. “Usually people with a moderate injury like this won’t remember the accident or what led up to it. That’s normal. Watch for behavioural changes—“
John’s face did that thing, a hundred micro-expressions flitting across his features. Anger, sorrow, resolution. “Okay,” he said at last. “I’ll testify.”
“A year ago,” he said, “I was lying in a rondavel**, feverish, thinking I’d die. I hoped that I would see you once more, when that happened.” Putting his arms around me, he looked up, smiling. “And here I am, holding you as I never thought I would again.”
He feels John arch towards him, his mouth opening to Sherlock’s tongue. He places his hand behind John’s head, bringing them closer. Soon their bodies are pressing against one another, and Sherlock can feel the answer to his question. He wants to be every romantic cliche for John, to invent entirely new ways to love him.
By the time they’d made it through the final scene, Sherlock felt as if he’d spent six hours being quacked at and pecked by ducks. Everyone wanted to make suggestions; Irene had patiently taken notes and promised that when they had their next rehearsal it would be much smoother. Sherlock just wanted it over, done, sorted.
“The letters are not indecent. They merely reflect the innocent sentiments of a young girl. If she should confess to her intended husband—”
With these cryptic words, he stumped down the stairway. When the front door had closed, Watson turned to me, his eyebrows raised.
Watson shrugs. “I didn’t think he was. Maybe there are others like us, but with seven billion people filling the planet, we might never meet one. Though the world was a lot smaller then, it’s a quite a coincidence that the two of us ever met.”
. He had no reason or desire to share his sexual preferences or identity with the world. The idea of
“You know I’m not good at things like that.” He can hear how defensive he sounds, and feels sorry that he can’t deliver better news. “I suppose he told Mike all about it.”
Mycroft was the one who had taught him about the Mind Palace. At first it was a way to compartmentalise his roles, to store useful information that he might need at some point. After John died, Mycroft had explained to him how things could be forgotten, events and people completely deleted. Emotion was what kept memories vivid, so the way to forget was to manage one’s emotions. For Mycroft this may have been easy; for Sherlock is was nearly impossible. He learned to put aside roles he’d played once they were over, but it was hard to completely forget, even when the emotions were feigned.
“I have letters,” he began. “They were written some years ago by your client. The beau, alas, was unworthy of her. A sad story, and a common one.” He sighed. “Seven thousand pounds by the fourteenth, if there is to be a marriage on the eighteenth.”
He hasn’t forgotten his responsibilities, though. He has a daughter, and it’s been too long since he’s seen her. He’s called the house and Mary’s mobile, leaving messages which are never answered.
“That’s the point of sperm donation. Women aren’t your area, and you certainly couldn’t expect me to provide you with offspring. Best of both worlds. When you get tired of fatherhood, you can send them home and have gay sex with your boyfriend.” This was a hint.
Before I could answer, a constable came to the door. “We have taken Watson’s statement. Would you like to interview him now?”
But it’s seven o’clock and John isn’t home from work, which is odd because ordinarily Sherlock could set a clock by his habits. He’s always home by six, without fail.
The man scrambles to his feet and runs off. Watson stands for a moment, one hand against the wall, supporting himself. After a few seconds he collapses and lies still.
He gives a small huff of incredulity. She knows that he’s not doubting her. It’s that he can’t believe himself, that he didn’t see this coming. He’s in love with John, as any fool can see. But for all his observational skills, Sherlock has no idea how much John cares for him, never expected him to grieve so deeply.
In my wanderings I’d discovered the small graveyard where family were buried. All of those graves were much older, though, except for three small graves, the master’s children. I wondered where the other diphtheria victims had been buried.
“Yes, I think they slipped,” I lied. “It will be convenient for us if they continue to make mistakes, but we must remain cautious.”
“I’m sure Irene can come up with something that might pass for a plot. The writing though.” Sherlock gave a shudder. “Well, the writing was never the show’s strong point. I’m not sure why I expected the concept to grow up, just because we all did. But it’s going to be idiotic if we all read lines sounding like they were written by a fifteen year old.”
The lights were out. He expected the occupant of the flat to be gone, driving his cab, so he wasn’t very worried. The lights from the street were bright enough to show him the layout of the room. He flicked on the small torch he’d brought with him and began to examinethe data before him.
There’s nothing he can say to that. Maybe it was a selfish choice, but it was one he’d made early, before he met Mary, and he’d been honest about. He always wanted to serve in the army, had planned on doing it once he had his medical license. It wasn’t something he could put off until the time was right. Waiting would mean giving it up, and he knew that could kill something inside him. He was not made for a quiet life. He craved that adventure. Having a baby and getting married had complicated things, but he had held fast; it was something he had to do. Three years, then he would come back, start a practice, and they would be happy.
“He’ll be fine,” I said, lighting my pipe. I drew on it, filling the shared space with smoke. “I’m surprised that you find it necessary to waste a moment’s thought on him.” I smiled. “God, you were jealous. It was positively delicious to see you fuming.” At Watson’s frown I continued. “Not that I will ever do that again. You are quite precious to me, John.”
Maybe she did see it during those appointments. Maybe she wrote it down on that pad she always took notes on. He remembers reading
The entire story reeked of confabulation, a false trail leading to a fake story. Could John have pulled this off by himself?
“Gavin’s attracted to women that aren’t very good for him,” Lestrade said. “I think from the beginning it was the plan that he would have a lot of failed relationships. He’s too focused on his work to be a good husband and father, too jaded by so much of what he’s seen. I would say he’s finally realised that about himself, when his last relationship ended. But he won’t say no to the next one.”
She shrugs. “Well, you’ll have another chance to spend time with her the week after next. I’m flying to LA with David to meet the people who are going to produce the movie.” She smiles broadly. “You can stay here with Rosamund.”
I took my place beside him, looking over his shoulder. “Oscillation on the pavement. That would indicate an
As the cool fingers gently press on the scar, John understands that he may have lost things, but there are so many more things he has gained, if he’ll only accept them. Evenings of quiet companionship, nights at crime scenes, days trailing after this brilliant, amazing, and always frustrating man. A grey-eyed gaze that sees inside of him, a heart that is opening to him, letting him see in return.
The brother is seated in one of the kitchen chairs, one long leg crossed over the other. He doesn’t have the Byronic appeal that Sherlock has, no dark curls artfully arranged to suggest nonchalance. His hair, ginger, is receding; a pair of intelligent eyes, steely grey rather than the arresting blue-green of Sherlock’s. Both brothers wear identical expressions of loathing, however, aimed at each other.
“I’m having trouble thinking of her as my daughter,” he said. “I didn’t even know of her existence until an hour ago.”
Rich Brook arrived, sweeping in with apologies and doughnuts for everyone. In return, he received strained smiles. He giggled. “Gosh, I just can’t believe I’m here! I’m really going to play Jason Bradford!”
John Watson is putting on his best suit and regretting that he agreed to this. The suit hangs loose on him, and he’s not used to wearing a tie.
“Thank you,” he said, because he couldn’t think of anything else to say. He wasn’t grateful for Alex, but he should be. It was the role that gave him his start. If he hadn’t been picked to play Alex Tribble, he would probably have a graduate degree in chemistry. He might work for a drug company, or as a pathologist, or a tech at crime scenes. His life would be more anonymous, certainly. Maybe he’d have someone, a cute boyfriend, blond, muscular—
“Kill me,” he said. “Let me see the other side.” If this holy man knew so much about Death and Life, perhaps he could show Holmes the way between them.
John is wearing an explosive vest and looking grimly stoic. Sherlock has no idea how to save him, but if he doesn’t— well, it’s not useful to think about that.
“Nice.” It was a bad taste in his mouth. “Lestrade seems to think I’m such a gifted actor that I could convincingly fake niceness and make people like me.”
On the other hand, it seems like exhibitionism to sit alone in a pub, getting pissed, on display for everyone to see how fucked up his life is. Well, at least he has a life.
Watson’s face falls. Sniffing, he looks away. “I suppose you’ll never change,” he says. “I’ve been a fool to think you might.”
“The bar is closed, in case you were thinking we’d be interrupted,” Michael says, wrapping something around Watson’s feet.. “Nobody’s going to save you.”
She has seen his broken body, observed his regeneration. As a scientist, she must admit this evidence. “There are people who would like to study you.”
“From you, yourself. Do you remember how I read you at our first encounter? I have known you for nearly five years now, Watson, and have much more evidence than I did on New Year’s Day, 1881. I notice the way you look at people, how you respond to different types. And I though I complain about your stories, I do read them. In spite of your shady past and your questionable choices, you have a strong moral sense. I knew you wouldn’t simply give yourself up to Lestrade and Gregson.”
On the other hand, Molly was as close to being a friend as anyone he’d known. Lestrade was right. They’d all grown up together, and even though he sometimes wanted nothing to do with the others, they were bound by experiences that had shaped them into the adults they were now. Except for John, all of them had been new to acting. Molly was one of the few people he knew who might understand him. That didn’t mean he was going to bare his soul to her, but he might owe her a bit of honesty.
. Something else, as well, something new. I’ve forgotten. It all sounded sufficiently romantic for your taste.”
He rolled his eyes, then turned his attention to his phone. “Thank you.” He smiled and rang off. “I was right. They wouldn’t give me his cab number, but they confirmed the name.”
Certainly I was an odd child, but I saw no danger in that. I had a friend now, a boy who was a ghost, and I did not mind the limitations of our relationship. Nor did I introduce him to my cousins, but it was clear to everyone that something was different at Greenwood Hall. My aunt chided me less, and sometimes viewed me with alarm. My cousins obeyed her when she told them to avoid me. She gave this order with a shade of her old scorn; I did not notice that she seemed afraid. Only when I met her alone did she give me a look of fear.
. But a blind date is not a crime. He’s just looking for a pleasant evening, maybe another date if the chemistry is good.”
