Nana pulls her hands back and begins clearing the table. “Protecting you.”
“But how can you be sure?”
She blinks, but the tears still don’t fall. “Ever?”
What the
“What if she doesn’t like me?” he asks, finally voicing the uncertainty that’s been plaguing him since he saw her in the back seat of his brother’s nondescript sedan.
“You first, dear,” she whispers. Then she pulls away and holds out the gold band once more, pocketing the diamond engagement ring. “Shame it won’t fit him.”
Purgatory it is, then.
!” Lestrade yells and Mycroft spares a glance for the stairs and a thought for the people above.
Sherlock never would have accepted it anyway.
A not altogether terrible development so far, but more evidence is needed.
His brother appears in the doorway a moment later, pausing for all of a second before striding over to Rosamund who launches herself at him. He hauls her up into his arms without a hitch, supporting her weight as if she were nothing but air.
Mrs. Hudson nods and cups his cheek. He sees determination in her eyes, yes, but also faith. It’s been so long since someone’s had faith in him. He misses seeing it in John’s eyes every day. He watches Mrs. Hudson go back downstairs, and Mycroft at least has the forethought to wait until she’s reached the bottom before he opens his insufferable mouth.
A look of wonder ever so briefly crosses her face, before she schools her features into indifference once more. She’s been trained well. It breaks his heart a bit.
“Well, this isn’t last time, is it? You saw to that,” he snapped and Mycroft’s jaw tightened.
Sherlock remains silent.
She shovels more into her mouth than she thought was possible but then she remembers that the last thing she ate was toast at Sherlock’s earlier that day, so she supposes an appetite isn’t all that surprising. The knot is still there though, the anxiety and worry and fear. Couple all of that up with a helping of spaghetti and Rosie finds her eyelids fighting with gravity.
“I assure you, he did,” Mycroft replies.
So clearly there’s a plan. Even if the endgame of said plan is his imminent demise.
“Do you know what was there?”
so, the Boots where John would routinely stock up on first aid items that he couldn’t pilfer from the surgery for the kit beneath the sink, Angelo’s -
Mycroft knows it’s bad when a retired DI is forced to play minder.
“I do not know.” Greg can tell the words are practically clawing their way out of Mycroft’s throat. “He’s been abducted.”
For the first time since her father came bursting into her room, there is silence.
Mycroft watches as Lestrade slowly makes his way to the door, arriving in time for Sherlock to go collapsing into his arms. They’re both moving carefully, gently, like neither can believe the other is actually there. It is a hug between brothers, an overture Mycroft never could quite get himself to make.
“Don’t you know him?”
He almost expects another punch, but she merely leans forward and brushes her lips on the shell of his ear.
She lets herself shake and shake and cry and cry because this was a mistake and Daddy is gone and all she wanted was the book he gave her. Noise is coming from somewhere and she’s a little worried it might be from her. The fabric beneath her face is soaked and her fingers clutch at the back of the collar of the person whose arms she’s in.
John heard that. He heard that and felt a pain like someone had taken a dull, rusty fork and slowly ate away at his heart. But he just blew out a breath and looked away because it was easier than having to see the forced nonchalance on Sherlock’s face.
He watches his cottage disappear into the distance, his sanctuary, and he feels a flutter of fear for the first time in years. And so he does what he always does when he feels cornered. Out of place. Frightened.
It’s only when Mrs. Hudson herself starts to show a crack in her iron veneer, tearing up and glancing at Mycroft with a look that seems to say
But the pain doesn’t lessen; it ebbs and flows with all the subtlety of a hurricane, throbbing in time with every thump of his rabbiting heart.
Greg nods at Sherlock. “Ask him.” He watches Sherlock carefully set Rosie back on the ground and murmur something only they can hear. “What happened?”
“He’s mine, too, you know,” he said as he reached the door, turning back one last time.
He’s nearly affronted. “I have talked to her.”
“She’s here. With us. John had given her instructions to call me before it happened. We got to her in time.”
Greg smirks. “Nice to know some things never change.”
Mycroft holds out the mobile. “Don’t you want to see him?” He ignores Lestrade’s glare because it’s true: Sherlock has heard John, but he hasn’t actually watched the video. And sometimes his brother needs to be pushed out of his comfort zone. Emotion, sentiment, proper fear for the people he loves - it’s not exactly his milieu.
Lestrade shifts, shoving his hands in his pockets. “You think she’s bluffing?”
“No,” he manages.
“Where is he?”
Eventually her need for the toilet is the driving force that gets her trembling fingers to reach for the door. She pops it from its frame and winces as it crashes down to the carpeted floor. Pulling herself from the crawl space with strength she does not have, her wobbly legs find purchase on the shelf and she clings on until she can lower herself enough to land semi-gracefully on the floor. The mobile falls and she promptly picks it up, entering her father’s password and telling her heart not to hurt when she sees the home screen - a photo of them at the park this past summer.
The little girl has Mary’s ears and nose and John’s everything else. His heart cleaves in two as he stares, thoroughly unable to look away. She is wearing jeans and a jumper which John purchased for her and her hair has been tied back in a sloppy ponytail. He has a feeling that this is also a task that usually falls to John, and John (through YouTube) has gotten rather good at it. The girl is on her own now, though, and not about to ask Mycroft Holmes for help. Not that he’d know the first thing to do anyway.
“You know, your Daddy is one of the bravest men I’ve ever met,” she says simply. Like it’s just any other Tuesday.
But they can’t be because they just came from home. What she doesn’t realize is that Sherlock is bringing her to the next best thing:
She distinctly doesn’t pout because only babies do that, though Daddy catches her at it occasionally. Instead, she merely frowns and stares out of the window, playing with the chain around her neck her father gave her for her last birthday.
Mrs. Hudson returns and the noise she makes is enough to pull Sherlock from his Mind Palace. He’s wary of going too deep without an Ariadne to guide him out once again. Blinking in a flat that’s gotten much darker since he first closed his eyes, he realizes Rosamund is nowhere to be seen, and he panics for a second before hearing her tiny tread on the steps that her father had worn smooth. Right. He glances at the clock. He supposes it is nearly bedtime for someone so small.
“Cuppa?” She hesitates so instead he offers: “Sherry?”
Jumping out of a cake wasn’t on his list upon that return. He’d been beyond fake moustaches and bad accents - he’d gotten too good at disguises while away. Anything less than his utmost dedication would feel… mocking. A slap in the face to those that didn’t make it back.
“You’re getting greedy,” she murmurs, eyes narrowing.
“What for?” he asks, even as his stomach drops. Even as he takes in the lines on his brother’s face and the wrinkles in his suit. Even as he finally glances at the car and realizes that his brother has not come alone.
“Much,” she states, settling into the pillow as he heads towards the door.
He tries to draw in breath while it feels like he’s taking a knife to the side. It’s fine, he doesn’t have a spleen to puncture anyway.
A quick glance around the hall tells him that the struggle didn’t extend beyond this area. The intruders, three of them, opened the door and moved immediately into the living room, waiting for John to descend the stairs before they began their assault.
Sherlock, however, doesn’t follow.
He heads for the stairs and disappears, leaving Mycroft and Sherlock alone. He studies his brother then, since his gaze is still studiously fixed on the phone in his hand, and catalogues the changes. As he’s done so often since he showed up outside a Sussex cottage and dragged him from the dark and into the light.
Mycroft drops the persona he’s spent decades perfecting for one brief, real moment, staring at one of only two men who’ve achieved the impossible. Who met Sherlock Holmes and didn’t do what everyone, Mycroft included, did. Who encountered that glorious mind and didn’t underestimate him. “Do a better job than I did, won’t you?”
He holds the car door open for Rosamund Watson to slide in and he enters after her, taking pride in the fact that his driver doesn’t shift gears until the child’s seat-belt is firmly buckled.
“Uh huh,” she replies, lower lip already wobbling because she doesn’t like this. She doesn’t like this one bit.
“Mary’s doing,” Sherlock interrupts.
It’s not a theory Mycroft has dismissed. Still. “I know we’re doing this for John, but I do believe the video might bring Ms. Morstan some measure of comfort as well. I don’t believe she wants to hurt the child.”
on one hand. In fact, it might have taken the Serbian interrogation team to pull the admission past his lips. The fact that John Watson was able to when he isn’t even
The day has finally come, though, for him to respond in kind.
He takes the stairs slowly, using the breathing techniques that his therapist taught him when panic would come up and tap him on the shoulder. He appears in the doorway all too soon, eyeing the little girl in a bed that’s far too large for her like she might have a weapon hidden under the comforter. But then she scoots over, darting her gaze to the newly empty space beside her, and the barricade he had put up around his already-fragile heart cracks a bit. He sits down and shifts on the mattress, ignoring the memories of waking John in the middle of the night for a case that he would complain about, but ultimately get up for.
Greg crosses his socked feet on the coffee table and remains silent because why on God’s green bloody earth would the British Government need the help of a pensioned DI?
“So, so much,” he whispers, before he secures the door in place, plunging her into darkness once more. She’s shaking, and she knows it’s not just from the cold. Panic claws at her throat, like it did on the first day of school and the day of the talent show and the night she woke up to hear Mum and Daddy screaming downstairs.
“Come on then,” he says, holding out his hand, and Sherlock places the necklace into it, chain coiling against his skin. “You’re needed elsewhere, yeah?”
The jumper slowly lowers to his side, but he doesn’t relinquish his hold on it. “The memory stick containing Mary’s past that John supposedly burned on Christmas Day. The night that everything changed.”
But he can’t because the mobile feels ten stone in his hand, weighing down his palm as John’s bloodied, smug face stares back. How well suited they he and Sherlock were - are - to each other.
The sound of Sherlock crying.
. She fell off the monkey bars last year and broke her arm. Her father pulled out the old book from when he was in school and showed her exactly which bones she had broken. She was fascinated.
He manages to make it to his chair before he collapses like a marionette whose strings have been cut, breath uneven as he presses trembling palms to wet cheeks.
“He gave it to you.” It’s both realization and accusation all in one.
Raising his gaze to the ceiling, he listens to the gentle rise and fall of murmured voices through the floorboards. Sherlock and Rosamund seem to be getting along all right so far. At least no one’s burst into tears yet.
The following five minutes are a blur. Is it even five minutes? He honestly can’t tell. It feels like both a second and a century, saying goodbye to his daughter.
“Right,” he murmurs. “And is he  - ”
in my life!”
He knew Mary knew what he was doing, but he just didn’t care. He was playing his part the only way he knew how. At that point, the goal was merely survival, especially when Mycroft stopped answering his texts asking about Sherlock. That was when John truly felt like he was losing his goddamn mind.
Two years had passed since he missed the only opportunity he had to be true to himself for the first time in his life. Since he put Sherlock Holmes on a plane and pretended he’d be back in no time at all, popping up at Rosie’s daycare or something equally ludicrous.
“Excuse me?”
“Does Daddy love him too?”
“What happened between the two of you?” Sherlock suddenly asks, and Greg blinks, caught off guard.
“Guess John wasn’t getting a leg over,” he manages. At Sherlock’s confused frown, he points to the top of the box. “They expired two years ago.”
She swallows, but her throat has gone tight again. “I know you will,” she whispers, biting her lower lip to keep it from wobbling. “That’s what you do.”
), was just that. A lashing out. An attempt to hurt Mycroft because he himself was hurting.
time. She stands huffing in the doorway for all of a moment, briefly assessing the situation, before bustling over to the bed and quickly gathering the girl in her arms. Mycroft just stands to the side, part of a wallpaper for all the help he’s contributing.
“Did I what?” Sherlock snaps.
They’ve hooked him up to an IV, which is nice. Shame it’s just saline solution and not the good stuff, though. Everything hurts, down to the last hair follicle on his head.
“Daddy came into my room. He said bad people were coming. He had me hide in the crawl space, even though it was dark, and he told me to call you - to wait one hour after it got quiet and to call Mycroft Holmes. I heard - ” she trails off and bites her lip, showing vulnerability for the first time since she stumbled into his care.
He’s pulling on his wellies, because the garden does get rather muddy, when he hears the squeak of a brake outside. He pauses, hackles up, because he’s not listed and he orders things online under a pseudonym. And even when his packages are delivered, the mailman comes on foot down the narrow lane. No cars should be stopping outside of his house save for his own.
“You sent armed men into our home while our daughter
He cocks his gun and creeps down the stairs, throwing himself backwards when he gets to the bottom and a fist nearly catches his nose.
She fiddles with a chain around her neck and stares at the back of the leather seat in front of her, but her voice is steady when she begins to recount her story.
“Mrs. Hudson,” he replies, stopping just beside her in the doorway to place a fervent kiss on her cheek. She’s been crying but putting up a good show anyway.
He raises an eyebrow. “Then fucking enlighten me.”
“He’s at the park. St. James’s. You’ll find him by the lake. They’ll be feeding the pelicans around this time.”
“Ah.” He’s heard the term, certainly, but he’s not entirely sure what it entails. He pulls the covers up to her chin and stands back. “Like that?”
The thought of being carried by Sherlock again is nice, but she’s six. Just because her world is falling apart doesn’t mean she can’t handle a set of stairs. She lets go of Nana, but takes hold of her proffered hand instead.
“No!” Rosamund yells, and Mycroft glances up in time to see Sherlock scoop her up again, murmuring against her ear as he presses her face into his neck. She settles, but only just, teary eyes never quite leaving the mobile in Mycroft’s hand, as if her father would emerge from it fully formed at any moment.
“Rosamund, this is my brother, Sherlock Holmes.”
His limp is more pronounced but his spine is straight as he tosses his bag in the boot and slides into the back seat of the car, pulling his long-stored Belstaff around him like the armor it is. Rosie climbs in after him and Mycroft sits in the front beside the driver. Unfortunately, there’s no divider so Sherlock deals with this unbearable situation by staring petulantly out the window and watching his breath fog up the glass.
She knows this neighborhood. They’re nearly home.
Loneliness.
He used to look at Sherlock like that.
“Daddy talks about you a lot,” she murmurs. “He’s been teaching me football and he said your team is crap.”
It hurts more than he expects it to, and he expected a lot. He scrolls through riding crops and lipstick and Angelo’s. Through walking sticks and cabbies and pills. Through shock blankets and ‘nice shot’ and the bottom third of the door handle. He flips through the Black Lotus and the pool and The Woman. He nearly buckles when he gets to Baskerville. To ‘is yours a snorer’ and ‘that’s an order, corporal’ and ‘I don’t have friends, I’ve just got one.’
They exit into the night sky, and he remembers to shut the door behind himself, though he assumes there’s an agent somewhere watching their every move; making sure everything is locked up and cared for and watched over, because John Watson deserves no less.
“There’s a car waiting for you downstairs. I will email you what we know. Do have a look on your way over.”
Mycroft visibly swallows which only stokes Sherlock’s anger. His brother does not get to be contrite now. “Yes.”
“In depth,” is Mycroft’s reply and Sherlock nearly scoffs, yet the sound gets stuck in his throat, as if someone’s fingers are slowly but thoroughly squeezing his airway shut.
He’s nearly halfway up the staircase when a shriek pierces the night, a broken “Daddy!” shattering the sheer veil of calm that had settled over the flat.
“He’s been taken.” It’s blunt. Direct. But it does the job. She inhales sharply and Mycroft almost feels the echo of it behind his ribs.
“She’s been through enough,” Mycroft clips.
Sherlock swallows but it does nothing to ease the tightness in his throat.
“All right?”
He hears a seagull and smells salt on the air. He’s on the coast.
John’s voice says.
“As I said, I knew him before you were born. I don’t know him as a…”
There are more bangs and she flinches with every single one. There’s a shout and the sound of scuffling. Then a noise that makes her blood run cold. She’s seen enough James Bonds to know what a gunshot sounds like.
“How?”
The ellipses indicating her follow up appear a moment later:
“Miss Watson is here. Ms. Morstan is AWOL.”
“Hey,” he begins, coming into the living room and kneeling down in front of his daughter. “Let’s build a blanket fort with the fancy quilts Mummy never lets us use, shall we?” He doesn’t mean to be the favorite; more often than not, he’s just trying to distract her from the fact that her mother isn’t here, but he dotes on her because how could he not?
“I don’t doubt it.” He inhales deeply and holds his breath for a moment before slowly letting it out. “Listen, Rosamund - ”
“What?” Greg watches in confusion as determination etches itself in Sherlock’s features, carving resolute lines on his face. “What memory stick?”
“Beg your pardon?” Sherlock asks, gaze catching his own for the briefest of seconds.
“She did murder him, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said, rattling it off as if it were the morning weather report. “He died on the table.”
Everyone underestimates you.
When he’s content that his bees are content, he does any manner of chores. A bit of cleaning, a bit of laundry, perhaps a trip to the shops if he’s running low on milk or eggs. If only John could see him now.
“And who do I have to blame for this stupidity?” is the sarcastic reply, and Mycroft turns, chest constricting at what the answer must be:
“I don’t blame myself,” he says quietly, turning to him with a quiet fury in his eyes. “I blame you.”
Still, there was no French waiter routine. Upon his return, he’d spent two months in physical therapy, trying to regain the motor function he’d lost due to his haphazard attempts at healing while away. He spent a further six months meeting with a trauma specialist twice a week.
By the time Greg hands the keys over to the agent and gets through the door and up the stairs, Sherlock is in the living room, lifting a teary Rosie with a grunt, letting her tiny legs wrap around his waist as she buries her head in his neck.
She reaches out so quickly, he doesn’t even have time to register the punch until her fist has already split his lip. He’ll blame his slow reflexes on the concussion and the pint of his blood currently staining the floor.
Then Sherlock made a joke and John knew he was deflecting, but he let him get away with it anyway. Because he was a fucking coward. And it certainly wasn’t the first time:
Oh. She knows that name.
He stumbles forward and wraps his arms around Greg’s neck, burying his face in his shoulder as he weeps. Greg grunts as he absorbs the man’s impact, seeing that kid from so long through the new lines around his eyes. Through the grey just starting to streak his hair.
Somehow his hand finds his gun and he fires off a round into someone’s knee, but it’s the bullet he takes to the abdomen in return that really tilts the scales. And not in his favor.
He bypasses the roof and ‘leave a note’ and ‘you could.’ He’s replayed that conversation so many times in his head, he couldn’t delete it even if he wanted to. Finally, he gets to Mary Morstan and ‘not dead’ and ‘you let me grieve.’ His eyes are pricking but he pushes onward, forcing himself to witness the utter trainwreck that was their reunion. He examines abandoned train cars and skip codes and chip shops. He wants to skip wedding planning and all that that entails, but he can’t because it’s John’s wedding to Mary and she’s the reason he’s enduring this godforsaken exercise. He forces himself to remember the folds of the napkins and the taste of the wine and the discovery of one more deduction than he was expecting:
It’s a mistake he won’t be making twice.
Sherlock nods again and Greg cups the back of his neck, bringing their foreheads together. “I missed you, you bastard.”
Lestrade leans into the phone, ear close to the speaker. “What’s that sound?”
Her little arm hugs him around his middle and he flounders as she tucks herself into his side. It’s muscle memory to pull her in tighter, an indulgence he allowed himself when John would fall asleep on his shoulder in the back of a cab, under the cover of night with only a stranger as a potential eyewitness. He kept his hands to himself when it would happen in the hall of the Met.
“You won't have a problem,” Mycroft clips, turning away from his brother’s damning gaze and staring into the empty fire grate once more.
His stomach gives a traitorous growl, reminding him none too gently of Mrs. Hudson’s leftovers. He makes a meager meal, resolving to save the rest for Sherlock even if he has to tie his brother to the table and spoon feed him himself.
Rosamund scrambles for it, but Mycroft is faster, snatching up the device and swiping open the message conveniently sent from Mary’s phone. He can tell from the video’s thumbnail alone that he’s not going to like whatever comes when he hits ‘play.’
“Here?” she squeaks, because this is home. It’s the safest place in the world.
can do what you do. This,” he says, pointing a rigid finger to the middle of Sherlock’s forehead, “is a goddamn gift. I don’t know exactly what you did while you were away, but none of that matters because you’re Sherlock fucking Holmes. And John Watson is missing. Now what are you gonna do about it?”
Because the second Sherlock turns to leave, something on the bureau catches his eye. Greg watches him inch closer, long, pale fingers reaching out for a necklace hanging from a brass jewelry stand.
“I’m fine,” he clips. And he does seem to be, if no one deigned to dig deeper. If no one witnessed him fall so uncharacteristically to pieces not an hour ago.
It had been a… trying afternoon for all involved, particularly his brother and Rosamund. They’re all feeling a bit raw.
“Yes, Dr. Watson.”
“She’s carrying my
“Dear me, it must be an occasion. To what do I owe the honor?” she clips and he ignores the slight sting her admonishment brings. He loves her because she loves Sherlock and that’s enough reason as any.
“I’m bloody retired,” he all but growls, rolling his eyes as the man opens the back door for him but climbing in all the same.
“Ugh, that was tedious,” his brother says with a groan, wiping his face and carefully avoiding looking at either of them.
He hasn’t allowed himself to really think of the possibility since he asked Mycroft in the car that morning. His sudden outburst just a few minutes ago, that Rosamund most definitely heard (
He lets the curtain fall back into place, listening to the car peel away from the kerb, and turns back towards the empty flat. Well, not entirely empty. He glances towards the stairs and listens again, but he’s met with silence. Sleep must have finally come for Rosamund Watson.
He holds her trembling body, a shoddy placeholder for the person she really wants, and carries her down the steps, leaning down to place her on the sofa as Mrs. Hudson settles in beside her, gathering her into her embrace once more.
Mycroft looks away and Sherlock feels a crumb fall from his numb lip to the plate in front of him.
It took John longer than it should have to realize it was the git’s way of asking for information.
John had said, standing next to a plane that would summarily alter Sherlock’s life.
Oh God,
She hesitates, because normally she’d say off, but she doesn’t want to be in the dark very much right now. At home, there’s a small light in the hallway that stays on so she can find her way to the toilet if need be, but this is a strange flat and these are strange people. Not as strange as they used to be, but still.
“Doing what?”
“Rosie,” he offers, raising an arched brow.  “That’s interesting.”
The drive back to 221B is quiet but loaded. Greg doesn’t dare comment on the treasure trove they accumulated: a book, a jumper, a necklace, a photo. Sherlock seems lost in his own thoughts, staring out the window, breath fogging up the glass, so Greg leaves him to it.
“Well, he’s not wrong,” he agrees. “But don’t tell him I said that.”
“Right… um, I’ll just change,” he eventually mutters, glancing down at himself and realizing he’s still wearing pajamas and wellies, hardly city (or rescue) attire.
“You won't have a problem,” Mycroft clips, turning away from his brother, whose gaze still seems to prick him with a thousand accusations, and staring into the empty fire grate once more.
Mycroft’s eyebrows raise but he gives a little headnod in concession.
“You let Rosie sneak back in and see the spot where her father bled out on the carpet.”
“Retired,” he interrupts, just to be a shite.
He had hoped that the woman known as ‘Nana’ to Rosamund would be a comfort, but the child only cries harder, working herself into a right state. He’s sent prisoners to padded rooms for less.
It’s the last thing he remembers murmuring before it all goes black.
Sherlock tries for indifference, but his lower lip betrays him. “She’s making do.”
“Brother mine, we have a situation.” He remains silent, letting Miss Watson’s cries through the open door do the talking for him, but there’s a pressing sentiment he must express. One he needs to make absolutely clear: “She’s asking for you.”
Sherlock shakes his head, before frowning and opening John’s bedside drawer again, rooting through bits and bobs before pulling out a small black frame. He must have been so flummoxed by the condoms, he completely missed the rest. He flips the frame and Greg huffs out a breath as a photo of John and Sherlock stares back at him. In fact, it’s a photo he took. The final case they all worked on together, before John got married and Sherlock left on an MI6-sanctioned holiday, when they were all so delirious, running on nothing but PG Tips, maltesers, and crap coffee. John had been laughing so hard, his forehead was pressed to Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock - well, Greg had never seen him so carefree: giggling, leaning against a wall to support John’s weight as his head tilted towards the ceiling. Greg can’t even remember what they all found so funny.
He smiles sadly. “Except John.”
“Long enough. Your biscuits are shit, by the way. Rosie hates them. C’mon, let’s get this over with.” He nods at the phone, and Mary’s face hardens, but she lifts it up and hits record all the same. “Sherlock. You dead bastard.”
He scrubs a hand over his face just as the door opens and Mrs. Hudson stands there in all her formidable glory. She looks frail now though, winded, weak. Like someone has given her the greatest gift imaginable only to take it away a moment later.
“Love you.”
The memory stick. The pool. He owes a call to Elizabeth Smallwood.
“Sussex.”
And in that moment, John hated nothing more than he hated the woman known as Mary Morstan.
Greg should have known his evening was about to go tits up the second he saw the blocked number on his mobile screen. Nothing good ever comes from a blocked number.
“Not really sure what I’m s’posed to say,” John continues, raising an eyebrow at whomever is holding the phone. “Spent enough time talking to your ghost. Took me a long time to break that habit, if I’m honest.” He shifts in his seat (in his bed?) and winces. Mycroft finds himself leaning in, as if silently willing him to hang on. And as if he heard him, John says, “If this makes it into your brother’s sticky fingers - ” Mycroft huffs and John’s eyes narrow, like he can actually hear the sound, “tell him…” he licks his cracked lips, “tell him I hope he got my message.” He smiles softly. “My messenger.”
Mary started spending more and more time with her friends and John was past caring. Sure, he put up a brave face when she was around - they made trips to the park and the zoo like any happy, nuclear family - but he could only be grateful that Rosie was too young to pick up on tension.
“Sorry?”
“I’ve seen all I need to.” His tone brooks no argument, but he hasn’t - not really.
She had been so independent, so composed, so…
“Rosamund, stay here please,” Mr. Holmes instructs before heading for the door himself with a final look back at the lady from last night who’s magically appeared at Rosie’s side.
- WOW it's hard to write from the POV of a 6-(almost 7)-year-old. This will likely be the only chapter told from Rosie's POV, in case that turns you off. Don't worry. Our favorite detective is up next.
“I want to go home,” she murmurs, voice muffled.
Adrenaline shoots up his spine like an electric current. “Beg your pardon?” He doesn’t need to ask which pool Sherlock’s talking about. He and John didn’t even argue when Greg wrapped them both in shock blankets. The cloying stench of chlorine didn’t leave his nose for a week.
“You’ve got to be very quiet, Rosie,” he says, soft but firm, and she nods against his palm, clammy from her breath. Her eyes are wide and her heart is pounding, but Daddy cups her cheek and tucks her hair behind her ears.
He gives her jam and toast and declares he’s going to get her Daddy back in a tone that gives her no choice but to believe it. While he goes to pack and Mr. Holmes goes outside, she slides off the bench at the kitchen table and wanders into the living room, gravitating toward the bookcase next to the still burning fire. Most of the names she can’t pronounce, but she recognizes one:
“Holmes!” the voice calls. It’s unfamiliar and just a little bit frantic.
But until then, it’s blanket forts, biscuits, Indian takeaway, and a movie she’s probably too young to see.
“You put them in the Chokey,” Rosamund pipes up from the sofa.
“It makes sense that she was at the pool, though we never had any concrete evidence to tie her there.”
“Rosie? Mary?” He strips out of his joggers and pulls on a pair of khakis.
would know,” is the simple response, but it’s enough to leech the fight from him.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything (
The sun briefly blinds him as he steps outside, mocking their petty problems with its beauty. The garden is in better shape than he expected, but Sherlock always did have a way with weeds. With a sigh he uses to cover up his trepidation, he pulls out his mobile and selects one of the few contacts in his Favorites list.
, he should have known.
“Don’t do that. Don’t play nice,” Sherlock admonishes over the roof before sliding into the passenger seat with a huff.
He steps onto the landing and pulls his mobile out of his pocket, hitting the only name in his list of Favourites and listening to it ring.
His brave, beautiful, darling girl.
He stands with a wince (didn’t try hard enough at this morning’s PT) and limps to the curtain, pulling it back fractionally and feeling a swoop in his stomach at the nondescript, yet familiar black sedan.
She nods and looks down, tracing the faded pattern on the bedspread with her finger. “Me too.”
“Oh, John,” she says. It’s pitying. “We’ve been at war since before you were medically discharged.”
“It wasn’t my decision to make - ”
“Don’t worry, dear,” she drawls, “ I’ve filled out more medical forms for you than I care to count.”
“Yes,” she hums. “You would.” She holds up the phone again and gives him an exaggerated pout, the same kind she used to employ when Rosie was throwing a tantrum. “I really do think he’d prefer to hear from you.”
Lestrade pulls out his phone to do just that as Mycroft hits play on the video again, watching his brother instead of the man his brother loves. Sherlock nearly sags when John starts speaking again, and Mycroft wonders if Sherlock truly thought he’d never hear that voice again.
The front door bangs open below and he’ll never admit to the
The years have not exactly been kind to Sherlock. Though, upon further inspection, perhaps they have. His hair is longer and his chin darker, but the purple half moons under his eyes have disappeared. There’s a lightness in his irises and an ease of the tension in his shoulders that Mycroft can’t deny wasn’t there before.
“Anything?”
“Yes, sir,” he murmurs, before tossing the keys at Greg who barely catches them.
“Ever,” he replies, knowing it’s the truth he speaks.
“Fine,” Sherlock relents. “But just the two of us.” His gaze is on Lestrade, but Mycroft knows those words were meant for him.
"Do you really think I'm the Holmes John Watson wants his daughter with? Perhaps I should procure a copy of her birth certificate to be sure.”
Despite the restraints, his spine straightens, and he grunts through the pain as if facing a wanted serial killer instead of the woman who bore his child.
“Yes. So you knew all of this?” Mycroft began, steepling his fingers in a way that was so… Holmesian, John’s breath stuttered in his chest, “Yet you went
“He was never happy, you know,” Mycroft calls and Sherlock halts, hands balling into fists in his pockets as he slowly turns.
His senses are a little sluggish, gaze taking a delayed second to catch up with the movement of his head. He tries to focus but wherever he is is dark, save for the fluorescent fixture hanging above, casting a small circle of light of which he is the epicenter. His bare toes are still cold on the concrete floor, and he’s lost feeling entirely in his hands. Probably for the best.
"Greg," he breathes. Not Gerald. Not Glenn.
Lestrade’s jaw drops as Mycroft’s brows meet his hairline. “You’re going to give Ms. Morstan what she wants?”
Sherlock stepped off a roof and just over a year later, the woman known as Mary Morstan stepped into his surgery. She slotted into his life like a missing puzzle piece, filling the hole that carved its way into his most tender places in the ambulance bay at Barts Hospital.
He can’t even imagine how she must be feeling.
“Rosie,” Mycroft drawls, latching onto the nickname for some reason. “That’s interesting.”
He eventually appears in the doorway looking unsure and nervous for the first time since they met. They eye each other for a moment before Rosie slowly scoots over and flicks her gaze to the space next to her on the bed. Sherlock takes it for the invitation it is and slowly sits down next to her.
His knees buckle and the breath rushes out of him like someone is sitting on his lungs. He clasps at his right side only to realize that his hands are ineffectual at stopping the blood seeping out through his fingers.
“Then what was it?”
. He’d never let him live it down. He manages a tight smile for her, and she must see the emotion in his eyes because she pats his cheek and turns, holding Rosamund’s hand as she leads them up the stairs.
“Really?” she manages and Nana nods.
“A call to arms?” Lestrade asks in the middle of their fourth pass. “What the hell does that mean?”
“Oh well, my mistake,” he says, even as he digs the covers around her body nice and tight, just how she likes it. “Better?”
His inhalation is sharp, but his voice firm when he clips, “I’m on my way” in return. The line goes dead and Mycroft sighs, gathering himself as he steps once more into the breach.
“What did you expect?” he replied, tone laced with - not blame per se - but something close. It pierced John to his core.
Is this it? The definitive word he’s been waiting for for what seems like decades, telling him once and for all that Sherlock Holmes is dead?
Sherlock leans back. “What does that mean?”
This. This was a mistake. She thought she could be big. She thought she could handle it just like Daddy would, but she can’t. She can’t, she can’t, and tears are starting to well and her breath is short and sharp, tunneling her vision and causing her ears to buzz.
She should put it back - Mycroft (Mr. Holmes The Sterner, in her mind) and Sherlock (Mr. Holmes, the Stranger) will return soon and she doesn’t want to be caught snooping (
His arrival lacked pomp and circumstance and it would have been a wasted effort anyway. After all, it didn’t take long to find them.
Sherlock swallows hard. “I do.”
With a sigh, he texts Anthea to send off the encrypted files to Lestrade and makes his way downstairs to 221A. He knocks softly on the door and waits with his hands clasped behind his back until he hears a warbled, “Come in.”
“Don’t do that! Don’t play nice!”
If any of them believed in such things. Too damn old. Too damn cynical. Too damn… damned.
“Dr. Watson was taken from his house by force at approximately 12:35 this morning.” Sherlock is smart enough to read between the lines of what Mycroft really means when he says, ‘by force.’
She knows they’re trying to protect her by shielding her, and considering what happened last time she was here, it makes sense. But that’s the thing about being tiny.
The violin protests as Lestrade asks the obvious question, which Sherlock answers as the screen light dies on the text banner.
It's longer than normal. Honestly, the insufferable man just wouldn't shut up. 😉
He’s missed something.
would have made a copy!” Sherlock yells. “I taught him better than that!”
Mycroft sighs, watching Sherlock set Rosamund back on the ground. “Nightmare. Calming her down was apparently a task only her Detective could accomplish. Trust me, we tried.” He gestures to Mrs. Hudson who looks like she needs a stiff drink and watches as Lestrade moves over to her, placing a kiss on her cheek and speaking to her in low tones.
The ride to Baker Street is suffocatingly silent and steeped in memories he wishes he’d been better prepared for: the fish and chip shop where he and John spent many a late night (or early morning, depending on which of them you asked), the coffee shop that ground its beans
He hasn’t been prepared for half the things that have happened to him today, but he’s muddled through on instinct and drive alone.
“Okay.” He can do that. He can do many things, like try to offer her comfort. He’s no one’s first choice for it, surely, but at the moment, it’s either him or Mycroft - and as Mycroft so cryptically said,
“Excuse me?”
Leaning against the wall by the door, he crosses his arms over his chest and just watches, taking in a sight he hasn’t seen in far too long.
“Gone? Gone where?”
Evidence of just how happy John was - or wasn’t - without him.
Which brings him back to John Watson and the whole reason for his calling.
He was one of the few. The lucky, he might say, if he believed in such things.
“He’s not.”
He watches himself get shot and fall backwards in a careful arc that has neither grace nor glory. He wishes he could see John discover him - to know what went through his mind - but the rest of the data is corrupted. He shivers at ‘you don’t tell John’ and he reaches for John’s jumper as medics try to restart his heart and he hates Christmas for the overblown sentimentality it tries to force-feed the masses and not at all for anything else.
“So what now, genius?” Lestrade asks, and Mycroft watches as the switch is flipped, as adrenaline courses through Sherlock’s veins, making his limbs bounce and his mouth twitch.
Everyone is being unusually quiet and she realizes it’s because they don’t want to talk in front of her. She can tell when adults need to have adult conversations. Perhaps she can pretend to sleep, but exhaustion is catching up with her. Her eyelids feel heavy and the leather of the seat is nice and Sherlock’s shampoo smells good. Sure enough, Sherlock snaps a minute later, making her jump.
“Daddy isn’t here, love,” Mrs. Hudson murmurs, rocking her gently back and forth as the child sobs into her dress.
Maybe it was all a lie.
Sherlock swallows hard but nods. Mycroft can’t help but notice the trinkets he’s returned with, but for once in his life, he doesn’t prod the bruise. Instead, he watches Sherlock carefully fold the jumper and place it on the desk, setting the framed photo down on top of it. The carefreeness captured on his brother’s face is mesmerizing and, not for the first time, Mycroft marvels at John Watson’s ability to put it there.
His eyes had cut to Mycroft, waiting for him to orchestrate some last minute deus ex machina, but it never came. Mycroft watched the plane nearly as long as John did, before turning and making his way back to his car.
Sherlock goes utterly still where he stands, holding up a jumper of John’s he probably would have tried to burn back in 221B. His fingers clutch the fabric much like Greg imagines Rosie clutches that stuffed bunny, like it’s the last modicum of comfort in a dark, sad world.
“No you’re not.” It’s firm. Final.
“No, my dear. I do not believe he is.” The endearment falls from his lips without thought and he finds he does not mind the taste of it on his tongue. Perhaps sentiment can make an exception for Rosamund Watson. “Your father is one of the strongest and bravest men I’ve ever met.”
He nearly smiles. “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. We’ll be by later this evening.”
“Good,” she replies. “It’s not right for the two of you to be doing this all on your own.” She seems to look at him then, and he truly does wonder what she sees. If she notices how the past 24 hours have aged him. He feels old aches in new places. Or is it new aches in old places?
With reluctance, she returns to the kitchen and finishes her toast, but her mind is still on the photo in the book. Daddy stared at Sherlock the way he sometimes stares at her.
“Sherlock, you dead bastard,” John’s voice says, and Lestrade inhales sharply. “Did you miss me?”
His inspection of the Watson house had not been as fruitful as any of them would have liked. There’s a lack of evidence to be sure, but the gears in Sherlock’s brain have not been forced to whir as quickly as he needs them to in a very long while. Mycroft knows it’s only a matter of time, but time is not on their side. And Sherlock knows it.
He continues on down the hall to the toilet, through whose window John probably spotted the assailants before they could make it to the door. Given the evidence and Rosamund’s testimony, it seems he had a warning, perhaps the closing of a car door - just long enough to get his daughter to relative safety.
It’s three against one, but he gives as good as he gets. His gun gets knocked from his hand at some point, and he takes a brutal punch to the temple which dazes him, but he surrenders to reflex and muscle memory, taking down one guy swiftly and efficiently before moving onto the next. They have both height and weight on him, but he’s scrappy, dropping low and going for pressure points -
“Oh.”
“Everything alright?”
“I have not had the pleasure,” Sherlock replies. Lestrade looks dumbfounded.
“He’s back.”
would know.”
“I want you to stay in here.” He gestures to the door of the crawl space just above the shelf where they keep the spare linens. She’s always hated it, it’s drafty and scary, but too much is happening at once and she doesn’t even remember to remind him that she doesn’t like the dark. He pushes his mobile into her hand and the glow of the screen briefly lights up her face. “Stay here until it’s quiet for a whole hour. Then I want you to find that name and call that number, okay?”
“No one likes you, Sherlock.”
“What’s the plan?” he demanded, but Mycroft didn’t even bother looking up from his paperwork.
Made Greg wonder what he could have done differently to keep it from happening in the first place.
is wrong with you?” he explodes, standing with so much momentum, the chair topples over behind him with the loud clang of wood on stone, making Rosamund jump.
Rosamund Watson is standing in the doorway, staring at the puddle of her father’s blood, looking like she’s lost a pint of it herself.
Mycroft does not ask him what he found there.
before letting them fall to his sides.
The flat is painfully quiet and, finally, Rosie asks the question that’s been beating at her heart ever since she heard two gunshots and not much else.
“Where’s the kid?” a voice says and she inhales.
“Where’s Sherlock?” she asks, and even Lestrade seems intrigued at the answer.
Mycroft sighs. “Nightmare. Calming her down was apparently a task only her Detective could accomplish. Trust me, we tried.” He gestures to Mrs. Hudson who still looks a mess, so Greg goes over and bends down, placing a kiss on her cheek.
that this is one area he will not tolerate his opinions on.
After all, the deja vu is beautiful and visceral, watching Sherlock tear apart a crime scene. But he doesn’t tear it apart - he breaks it down, bends it to his will; he catalogues it into labels and facts and theories only he can see.
Lestrade thrums like a live wire, tension tightening his jaw. “What is it?”
“Yeah, I’m not as dumb as I look,” Lestrade replies, before pointedly looking at Mycroft. “I had my suspicions at the time, but the amount of shit redacted in Mary’s file sort of drove the point home.”
“Is my Daddy dead?” She looks up at him as her eyes swim and something in his chest twists. He refuses to acknowledge it’s his heart.
“We stitched you up, by the way,” she calls over her shoulder. “Can’t have you dying yet.”
“This was a mistake,” Sherlock says and his voice rumbles in his chest, louder than the noises that still escape her body, whimpers and sniffles that she doesn’t recall ever making. Even when she broke her arm.
“Sherlock - ” he began, pitying and hateful, and Sherlock’s anger had spiked.
“Because
Right turn, honking horn, thumping bass beat, motorway. The van is going too fast now to be able to track the distance with any certainty. He’s lost too much blood to try and estimate it anyway.
“Greg - ” he breathes.
Greg gives a cursory search about the room, but Sherlock isn’t here. “And who do I have to blame for this stupidity?”
After all, he doesn’t think his current blood pressure couldn’t take it.
She’s not sure that this is what Daddy had in mind when he said that, but she goes for it anyway. (
“Yes, please.”
“Love what you’ve done to the place,” Mycroft drawls because he can’t help himself and Sherlock flicks his ear, hard and at the sensitive part.
in my life!”
“My pressure point.” John wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans and swallowed down the bile threatening to rise. “You’ll let me know? If something happens to Sher -" he stopped and swallowed, licked his lips, willing the words to come.  “Just - you’ll let me know?”
“Mycroft,” and it’s her hesitation that has him guessing her question just before it leaves her lips: “Does John know?”
“Bastard,” he mutters, moving towards the door and throwing it open before his brother can make it up the walk. “I had one rule!” he bellows, sending the redpolls on his bird feeder scattering to the sky.
“Strawberry,” she states. “Please,” she then adds as an afterthought.
“Right you are.”
“No,” John whispered, voice hoarse, trying to keep up with the onslaught of Mycroft’s truth.
And his brother had stared at him for a moment, something passing across his face that Sherlock would never admit looked like heartbreak, before returning his gaze to his paperwork.
When she finally lights it up, the mobile reads 01:03, but she remains where she is with only her own uneven breathing for company until the digital numbers creep by to 02:04. It’s been quiet for a while now. Well over the designated hour.
She audibly gasps and claps a hand over her mouth, tears springing up again because they never seem to be far today. Blood is rushing in her ears and she blinks, feeling the hot splash of water on her cheek.
She hasn’t said a whole lot, murmuring only that his coffee smelled like the kind her father made, before continuing to look out the window. She’s small for her age, but that’s to be expected given her parentage.
His brother meets his eyes briefly in the rearview mirror before flicking his gaze over to Rosamund. “In a bit.”
His bare feet are cold, and the wind bites through the thin cotton of his threadbare pajamas. Rope cuts into the tender skin of his wrists, and he grunts as he’s tossed into the back of a van. The pain that flares in his side is enough to steal his vision for a moment.
But he doesn’t move.
“Did Mary do this?”
“He was
He finally allows himself to look around the room where John spent his days (his happiest days, Sherlock would like to believe). He didn’t have much when he moved in, yet he still seemed to manage to take up so much space. In Sherlock’s flat, his mind, and yes, his heart. And when he left, he took what little possessions he had with him, and Sherlock was left with just the ghosts of memories of the time they shared together.
John has a feeling he knows what it was, but the knowledge that he’ll never hear it said aloud in the voice he’d know at the end of the earth irreparably shatters his already broken heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
He runs a hand through his thinning hair and heads for the kitchen because tea seems appropriate. Or at least necessary. He goes about setting the kettle to boil, feeling like he’s just going through the motions because no one is in any fit state to consume it. Sure enough, he sets a cup down in front of Rosamund a minute later, but she doesn’t notice, buried as she is in Mrs. Hudson’s dress.
He doesn’t have a watch, but he waits long enough for his bum to go numb and his leg to stiffen with disuse. The room beyond has been silent for quite some time, so he suffers to standing, limping through the door and to the bed, listening to the steady breaths puffing in and out of Rosie’s chest. She looks younger now, absent of the perpetually furrowed brow that being the child of John Watson requires.
“Sherlock?”
Suddenly, a mobile chimes on the coffee table, and the bow of the violin scratches across the strings as the four other occupants in the room stare at the offensive device.
would know.”
He honestly doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. He hasn’t allowed himself to hope for so long, but only Mary would be that cruel. To make him beg for a dead man’s help. A dead man whom John still loves more than he ever loved the woman beside him.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft says, glancing meaningfully through the window at Rosamund before greeting his brother’s gaze over the roof of the car. “Are you ready for this?”
Sherlock smooths down his shirt front to give his trembling hands something to do. He’s faced megalomaniacs and psychopaths, but who knew it would be a six-year-old that would be his undoing?
“Gunshots.”
English.”
Sherlock’s lips part, astonished, and he sucks in a breath before letting it out slowly.
Mycroft swallows, but the words still stick in his mouth. After all, it’s not often he utters them. “I don’t know.”
Pressing a fist to his mouth, he swallows the first sob as he runs his thumb over
Mycroft clears his throat. “Quite. She got close to him, closer than even she expected or intended to, I believe. I suppose she was satisfied by what she saw.”
He gives a cheeky grin and feels his lip split further.
Nana wipes her mouth with a damp napkin, something she hasn’t done since Rosie became able to do it herself, and gently pushes her hair away from her face, cupping her cheeks in her hands across the table.
When he uncurls his fingers, a memory stick rests in the center of his palm.
“Okay.” He shifts on the bed so he can face her more fully. “Rosie,” he begins again, looking very serious. “I want you to know that I’m going to do everything in my power to get your father back. I know I said it before, but I’ll say it as many times as you need to hear it.”
Sherlock turns so Rosamund faces away and meets Mycroft’s gaze for a brief moment before flicking it down to the mobile. Mycroft can see the struggle in every line of his body - rescue John or tend to his daughter. He knows which answer John would prefer, never one for self-preservation.
.” At least she inherited his sarcasm.
Lady Smallwood doesn’t reply, most likely distracted by more pressing matters, which is for the best because it allows Mycroft to hear the squeak of the springs in the bed above as the tiny body cocooned in it tosses and turns, caught in the throws of whatever’s tormenting that fragile mind.
If Greg closes his eyes, he can almost imagine John in his chair, Rosie curled up on his lap, as Sherlock plays silhouetted by the window, as he’s doing now. He’d look at him as if he’d hung the moon, because that’s just how John Watson looks at Sherlock Holmes.
“Doing what?” He can’t imagine Sherlock in the country, wearing cardigans, pruning gardens, and solving stolen bicycle cases. Then again, he couldn’t imagine him in a dungeon either, but he knows that’s what happened in Serbia. He remembers every word John told him drunkenly and devastatingly one evening while Chelsea thrashed Tottenham.
“No?”
She stands and makes her way to the refrigerator, opening the door and pulling out a tupperware.
He’s not sure he’s ready for the John Watson wing yet, though. He’s not sure he’ll ever be, but he can’t solve the case without it. He’s not sure he can solve his case without
his mind growls.
He pulls on his jacket and grabs his keys, hustling down the steps of his flat before bursting into the cool night air. Sure enough, there’s a black sedan idling on the kerb, driver in an expensive black suit Greg’s pretty sure they measure you for on your first day of spy training.
or just
John will always remember the way that accusation felt. “Me?”
“Why?”
He turns slowly, haltingly, and offers a small smile as Rosie climbs back onto the sofa, huddling in next to Mrs. Hudson, fitting perfectly in the crook of her arm. It’s been ages since Greg’s seen her. She’s gotten so big, John shining through her every feature.
And in that moment, something he remembered reading in a file comes to him. A tidbit he had glossed over in the initial adrenaline spike of John’s taking: Rosamund calls her ‘Nana.’
She blinks up at him. “Really? He used to live here?”
He nods, a gesture Sherlock returns, another silent acknowledgment of gratitude, before he leads their sorry party to the stairs and out of sight.
Dame Martha, if there was any justice in the world.
Sherlock sighs. “Gavin - ”
And before she knows it, she’s drifting off, feeling safe for the first time in 24 hours. He’s not her Dad, but he’s her detective, and frankly, for the moment, that’s the next best thing.
The scuffling stops after that.
“I watched it well before John did. He handed the memory stick over to me and stayed at the hospital with you. He didn’t watch it for months.”
… “What?”
“Likewise.” He wonders if any of the information he put down was right and promptly decides it doesn’t matter. Not anymore. “What’s that for?” he asks instead, nodding at the phone.
“Productive?” Mycroft asks, startling him.
The batteries of any bugs leftover would be long dead by now, but he passes a precious few moments looking for them for old time’s sake. He finds one behind the mirror and another behind one of John’s old medical textbooks that never made the move. He’s sure there’s one hiding in the Union Jack throw pillow, but Sherlock might never forgive him if he took a knife to it to check.
His toes scrape the concrete as he stumbles between the two men holding him up, dragging him from his home.
“I think she’s gambling. Something has forced her hand. And if -
“Go ahead,” she murmurs and Rosie reaches out, clutching it to her chest, automatically rubbing the worn, floppy ear between her thumb and forefinger - a long-practised habit. Sherlock then places the copy of Matilda on the coffee table, and Rosie’s face lights up so much, you’d think Father Christmas himself came.
“Except John.” One of his few faults.
“Sherlock is dead, Mary.” His throat is tight, his voice thick. “You of all people should know that.”
“That afternoon, five years ago. You said, ‘He’s happy.’ It was why you left.”
“Sherlock. She’s a child. She’s lost both of her parents, she has no one.”
Sure enough, they hear the pitter patter of little feet hurrying back into the bedroom and Sherlock can’t help but smile briefly before swallowing thickly. The look of worry on his face is uncharacteristic, but then again, many things are about this older version of his brother.
blood - Well.
The stairs give and groan under his weight as he makes the careful climb, steps slow but sure. The living room is - well, much the same as it was. Cleaner, definitely, than when he last stepped foot in her, but theirs. Sherlock and John’s.
Ah. He had wanted to leave that particular portion of the conversation until they could speak in person. After all, how does one tell a woman that she’s getting one son back only to lose another?
Lestrade glances between the two brothers. “Be helpful to have that memory stick right about now.”
She rolls her eyes and, in that moment, she looks so much like John, he nearly gasps. “The point of tucking someone in is that you’re supposed to
“Did you ever love us?”
“And if there’s anyone who loves your Daddy as much as you and I do, it’s Sherlock Holmes.”
“Mycroft Holmes.”
“I didn’t realize we were at war.”
“Go get to know your goddaughter. If she’s anything like her parents, I’m sure she’s been listening at the top of the stairs for the last five minutes,” Mycroft reasons and Sherlock smiles as they hear her scurry back to bed.
“Every second of every day.”
“When was John taken?”
- Sherlock is still alive, hurting John is the ironclad way to drag him out of the shadows. It is the only certain thing in life.” Death, taxes, and Sherlock Holmes’ drive when John Watson needs saving.
Sherlock stands, nearly losing his balance and needing to steady himself on Greg before limping over to the door and pulling his Belstaff off the hook. “Try not to traumatize her while I’m gone?”
that runs through his head at the sound.
Mycroft finally looked up then and carefully placed his pen down. To an outsider, he might read as vaguely annoyed but John knew better. Mycroft was furious.
It isn’t until she hears the pop of the car door with the wind biting at her cheeks, slapping her into focus again, that she realizes the person carrying her has a limp.
“I’m hearing that a lot these days,” Mycroft clips.
“A little help?” Sherlock snaps and Greg barks out a laugh.
). She was in the middle of reading Matilda, another gift for her last birthday, and she desperately wants it. She wants the comforting presence of a fictional Miss Honey if she can’t have her very real father.
John’s laugh carried across the lake and each beat of it poked a hole in Sherlock’s already fragile heart. Its cadence battered at his gates and the way John threw his head back, sunlight catching the strands of his silver hair, tore down his parapets. His wedding ring winked at him, coding out a message Sherlock knew only all too well.
It’s small to be sure, but not claustrophobic. If he were the type to use those sort of words, he might even call it quaint. They pull to a stop in front of the cottage and he opens the door with, not quite a huff, but it’s close. He’d rather be anywhere but here, truth be told.
He does.
It’s raining harder now, the din almost deafening in the empty warehouse, which is why he doesn’t hear someone approach until a door at the far end is thrown open and a familiar silhouette steps into its frame.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” he murmurs. “We can’t disappoint Dr. Watson.”
Bastard.
“I want to lie down,” she murmurs.
“Bullshit,” he whispers. It comes out choked.
“There you are. I was worried we’d lost you for good.”
As it is, he has just enough time to clock the indentation of John’s head still on the pillow before a shout from downstairs draws his attention.
“Don’t do that,” he snaps, shaking his head. “Nope. Not even for old time’s sake.” He steps closer still, until he can see the carefully veiled uncertainty hiding behind the arrogant front in Sherlock’s eyes. “I don’t care how much time has passed. You’re not rusty. No one, and I mean
“Hope you got the type right,” he mutters, because he’s a little shit and when he’s cornered, his filter is the first thing to go.
“Well,” Lestrade grumbles, “it’s not exactly narrowing down our options.” He glances out the window as rain gently pelts the panes, proving his point.
“I love you too, Daddy.”
“Yes,” he replies. He’s already halfway out the door. “But not for you.”
“John never would have burned the memory stick.”
“Right,” he murmurs. “And is he  - ”
Sherlock remains silent, because he knows the truth.
“Sussex.”
“Yes, with me.”
He didn’t ask about John Watson until he ran out of things to occupy his mind and body with.
“There you are,” Mycroft murmurs, leaning back and looking nearly pleased. “I was worried we’d lost you for good.”
“He is. There are changes, of course. He had a long road to recovery when he returned and that journey is not over.”
“How long are you waiting?” he prompts.
She continues sobbing but manages a nod, letting go of Mrs. Hudson and reaching out for him, which is -
He jumps and whirls around to face Sherlock, hiding the plush toy behind his back.
He’ll make it a priority upon his return.
John put up a hell of a fight.
“But… if he burned it at Christmas, like you said, he had it in his possession for
“Mrs. Hudson, this may come as a bit of a shock, but Sherlock’s returned.”
He forgets, sometimes, just how long Sherlock and Moriarty were in each other’s orbit. How many years they played chess, chasing a white rabbit and running a long con that ended on a roof.
“Rosie.”
And oh that sets him right off again. “The one time you don’t meddle! You meddle in everything!”
Sherlock shrugs. “She’s a Watson.”
Her detective sighs. “Because my brother was right.
He licks his lips and swallows, ignoring the way his heart lurches in his chest. “What about him?”
“Don’t scratch her.”
Greg isn’t exactly sure what they’re looking for - he supposes Sherlock will know it when he sees it - but he clocks the hole in the drywall and the chipped wood on the bannister. The scuff marks on the baseboard and the splatter of blood on the opposite wall.
“We’re wasting time,” he nearly growls as he bangs the kettle around the sink, but Mycroft very nearly ignores him.
And Mycroft can’t explain the feeling he gets in the middle of his chest - like someone has poured hot tea into his veins and it’s spreading throughout his circulatory system - but it’s not entirely unpleasant.
Mycroft was right earlier, when he said he’d been avoiding her. He sees John in her every feature and he finds himself both wanting to sway towards her and keep her at arm’s length, a futile effort at self-preservation.
He rolls his eyes but opens the car door, glancing back up at the window to find Mycroft looking through the curtains. He raises his fist with the keys and nods, receiving one in reply.
The door was not damaged so the intruders had a very good lock-picking tool (or a key. Sherlock hasn’t ruled that out yet). But a turned over flower pot outside accounts for the initial bangs Mycroft said Rosamund heard when John was still with her.
But it’s a seed. It’s a seed of a doubt that is already starting to grow, so Sherlock gathers his coat around him and turns on his heel, heading into a house just waiting for him to discover its memories, its stories. Its secrets.
But Mycroft knows that look. Yes, Sherlock is wrecked and most definitely emotionally compromised but he’s also thinking, planning.
“Yes.”
Lestrade honestly looks like he’d love nothing more than to wrap his hands around Mycroft’s neck, and to be frank, Mycroft wouldn’t blame him. But before he can offer whatever passes for a meager modicum of comfort (because he feels a strange pull to he can’t quite explain), a noise he hasn’t heard in far too long comes from the stairwell - a sob that can’t be smothered.
Lestrade barks out a laugh, a surprising but not unwelcome sound that unwinds something within them all.
He pats Billy the Skull on the head before pressing his fingertips to his temples and blowing the dust off the door behind which his old life now lives. It’s been ages since he’s thrown it open. There have been the occasional peeks to remember a recipe or a fact about gardening or beekeeping, but he’s never gone for a walk, like he’s about to. He’s never actively sought those halls out.
“Sherlock, you can’t blame yourself.”
He regrets those words. Right now, he regrets them immensely.
She doesn’t realize it’s exactly what she needed to hear until he says it, and she feels all warm inside, watching him watch her. “Okay,” she whispers. “That would be good.”
Sherlock nods, a pathetic thing. “I thought he was happy here.” His voice is small; the assumption painful.
The footsteps on the stairs are slow. And uneven - Sherlock then. Maybe his limbs also feel like they weigh two stone each.
wants. He wants to know she’s okay.”
Mycroft procures a handkerchief because he’s a tosser who still carries one and, though Sherlock has never been anyone’s first choice for comfort, he finds himself crossing the living room in two strides and gathering her in his arms.
his mind taunts.
“Not exactly, sweetheart,” Lestrade murmurs, placing her on the sofa. “We’re going to send him a message, but you won’t actually be able to talk directly to him.” He levels a loaded look at Mycroft, as if daring him to contradict.
“Why did you let me believe he was?! Why didn’t you tell me?” he yells, the words tearing themselves from his throat on a wave of missed chances and wasted opportunities. So much of this may have been prevented. Had Sherlock thought to fight a little harder.
The car turns onto Baker Street and he holds his breath until it pulls to a stop outside the only real home he’s ever known. Before the cottage, at least. But that’s more sanctuary than home. More fortress of solitude. He scoops Rosamund up onto his lap so he can slide them both out of the car. She is simultaneously too large to account for how much time has passed since he left and too small to weather the circumstances they find themselves in. But he hoists her onto his hip again, his knee protesting as they make their way up the sidewalk in time for the door to open.
“Oh yes,” she replies and he winks, about to head into the kitchen when he feels a tiny gaze like an anvil landing on his shoulders.
Christ, he forgot how much it hurts to get shot.
“Would you immediately have hung up?”
Sherlock walks over to the bed, staring at the indention on the pillow, his hand hovering over where a head once rested before being abruptly and brutally shoved in his pocket. “Of John.”
He bends down and sets her down on the seat, but she doesn’t unwind her arms from around his neck, so he shifts her over and slides in next to her, pulling her tight to his body. She lets go only so she can burrow into his side and wrap an arm across his waist, thinking that she’ll stop shaking if she just holds on tight enough.
“Yes,” Lestrade clips. “And let me tell you how long it took me to wrap my head around
It’s her turn to laugh, though the smile contorts her face into something harsh and ugly. “Trust me, John Watson,” she says as she grabs a wooden chair and drags it opposite him, “It wasn’t your money I was after.”
Try as he might, hope sparks in his chest like a struck match.
“Just a little message. A call to arms, so to speak.”
“He also said something about a memory stick…”
He knows which spaces to avoid now. Which hallways are under lock and key (while others are in a bank vault worthy of Coutts). It’s not all a horror show, though. Some memories are quite… pleasant.
What happens when both players die? The game is over, right?
“Christ, Sherlock,” the DI replies, reaching for him as if to ascertain he’s real, and Sherlock is moving forward before he can recall doing so, all but collapsing into the arms of the man who, instead of kicking a kid high off his tits from his crime scene, took him to a hole in the wall and got him a cup of coffee and a hot meal.
He’s honestly not sure he’d forgive himself, either.
Why the hell is it in a drawer?
“That’s it?” he had called and Mycroft stopped and turned, eyes narrowed and hard.
He sighs and watches a bead of condensation drip down the bottle of his beer, already pinching the bridge of his nose. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten, Mr. Holmes. I’m retired.”
Greg can only stare at it for so long.
He smiles and tastes copper. “Choke on them, darling.”
“He was. In a way. He had Rosie and Christ knows he’d do anything for that child. But beyond that?” He inhales deeply and slowly blows it out. “No, he wasn’t very happy. But he became a far better actor than you ever gave him credit for.” He smiles ruefully, hoping to soften the blow, but Sherlock flinches as the words land all the same. “C’mon now. You’re doing him no good having a pity party out here.”
That smarts, it really does.
She hears the door open and she turns her head just enough to catch sight of Nana in the entryway looking older than she ever has. And she was pretty old to begin with.
She’s no Watson.
Mycroft smiles.
His eyebrows fly up before he can help it and he shares an equally incredulous glance with his brother. “The very same,” he says carefully. What did John tell her?
“To find your father.”
“And where was I?” Sherlock snaps.
He watched her enter the world holding Mary’s knee instead of her hand. She was a screaming, red mess and quite possibly the most beautiful thing John had ever laid eyes on.
And with that, all of the fight seeps out of Sherlock and he collapses into his chair, dropping his head into his hands. His breaths are ragged and wet, and Mycroft closes his eyes, every noise striking him like the lash of a whip. Releasing a heavy sigh, he runs a hand through his hair and adjusts his tie before going over and placing a hesitant hand on Sherlock’s shaking shoulder. His chest warms when Sherlock doesn’t immediately shake it off.
“What?” He tries to lace the question with disdain, but it comes out small and weak instead.
“Got one back only to lose another. Quite typical, isn’t it.” She laughs self-deprecatingly and dabs at her eyes with Mycroft’s handkerchief. “Sometimes I do wonder if 221B will ever be full again.”
“No!” the girl yells. “Is it Daddy?” If there were a way for someone to look both manic and mutinous, she achieves it - an impressive feat for someone so small.
He lashes out.
“What is it?” he asks.
But it’s not all of them. Not really. John Watson leaves quite a void; a gaping wound not even the finest doctors can heal. And he’s read Sherlock’s medical file, so he knows.
Lestrade retreats to the kitchen, and Mrs. Hudson opens the book, letting Rosamund show her which chapter she and John had gotten to.
She scrolls to H and her finger hovers over ‘Mycroft Holmes’ but before she can press the name she was forced to memorize almost as soon as she learned her letters, the phone slips from her grasp as a gloved hand clamps down over mouth, muffling her scream.
“Maybe she’s bored,” Lestrade offers. “Got tired of playing happy family.”
Greg can feel his eyebrows climbing, but he’s honestly not surprised. He’s seen Sherlock with kids at crime scenes. He’s honestly one of the few people he’d trust to do a good job with them.
him, at the very least. He itches to know what John’s said and whether he occupies a place of importance in her life the way John does in his.
of us knew he was alive. Save you.”
Lestrade lets out a heavy sigh, weary with the task at hand. Or perhaps just exasperated by them both. “Yeah.”
“And?”
A bang sounds from downstairs and he turns into the hall closet and puts her down, taking hold of her shoulders and forcing her to look at him. “Remember what I told you, sweetheart? The name I told you to remember?”
“Okay, darling,” Nana whispers, fire gone, before tapping her nose and holding her hands out to pull Rosie up.
“Don’t mind me,” she mutters, dabbing at her eyes with the handkerchief Mycroft hands her.
“Thank you,” he managed, before making his exit and walking the thirty minutes or so to one of his favorite places in London that could very well turn out to be his heaven or his hell.
She doesn’t want to get back into the car, but the car will take her to London and London is where Daddy is. At least she hopes that’s where she is. She’s seen enough James Bonds to know that bad guys can get places far away quickly.
He hears a heavy sigh gust over the line and then Mycroft again knee-caps him with two fucking words:
“I was trying to respect your wishes!” Mycroft finally yells. “For
“Time to come out of retirement, baby brother,” Mycroft murmurs, looking like he hates every word that comes out of his mouth.
“Is this purgatory?” the child asks and he can’t help it - he snorts. He honestly didn’t expect her to remember that conversation.
Silence descends, broken only by Sherlock’s panting breath, a crack in the lens.
Sherlock finally looks up solely so he can roll his eyes. “No, I’m going to give John what
Top marks for the Detective Inspector, then.
“What does it matter what shape he’s in? As long as he lives, right?” another voice says.
“No,” she hums. “I suppose not.” Then she takes her rings off and holds them out in her palm, though he’s unclear what she’d like him to do with them given the fact that his hands are still bound. “Shall I give these back?”
Rosie realizes it’s the first time she’s been alone with someone she knows since Daddy left her the night before (
“Light on or off?” He watches her deliberate and he sees the fear in the way she nibbles on her lower lip. “Tell you what, how about I turn it off, but I stay out here, just until you fall asleep.”
Then his daughter was born a few weeks later and John finally had a new sun to orbit.
“Do you think you can do that?” Mycroft prompted and John met his eye once more.
“Well,” Greg starts, leaning back and putting his hands on his knees to push himself to standing, “there’s no way I’m letting you go to the house of the woman who shot you on your own, so lead on.”
Mycroft stops his advance, but remains steadfastly on the path. He looks different yet the same. It’s an impressive feat considering Sherlock hasn’t laid eyes on him in five years.
The bow grates against the bridge for a moment, a jarring screech of self-consciousness as it tries to get reacquainted. As Sherlock tries to remember a past life he never thought he’d revisit. Eventually the noise becomes a melody, and the melody becomes a concerto. Of course Mycroft knows it. It’s Beethoven’s Romance Number 1 in G Major and he wants to roll his eyes -
The handle of John’s front door is cool beneath his touch and he takes a moment to center himself, inhaling deeply and ignoring the fact that his brother’s gaze bores into his back. He’d really rather not have an audience for this, but he so rarely gets what he wants these days. Luckily Mycroft’s minions are giving him a wide berth as he pushes the door open and slowly makes his way inside.
Not when Sherlock is conveying with music all of the words he cannot get himself to say.
She is quiet, but by no means a wilting flower. Surely the offspring of John Watson and Mary Morstan would be anything but. He looks forward to seeing the unstoppable force that is Sherlock Holmes meet the immovable object Rosamund Watson is shaping up to be.
“Yeah,” he replies, voice a bit hoarse. “I didn’t think you remembered me.”
He’s washed, impeccably dressed, and judiciously packed in the span of 20 minutes, enough time for sodding Mycroft to enjoy his sodding tea and Rosamund to help herself to another piece of toast.
“I had one rule!”
“No one likes you, Sherlock,” Mycroft replies, and he’s grateful for the joke (accurate though it may be).
“Yes, I can do it,” she replies, sounding much more sure than she feels.
but he loses the battle as he reads his rank, service number, and blood type.
He takes a moment to ponder if he’s being overly cautious or just paranoid and, deciding the line is too fine to determine, he rolls out of bed and opens his pants drawer, popping open the fake back and pulling out the gun stashed there.
“All of them,” she replies.
They eventually make their way down the dirt lane, greenery coddling them on either side. He’d seen satellite photos of his brother’s home, but somehow, he expected it to be… more.
” he roars, and he can’t regret it, even as his vision swims.
“Indeed,” Mr. Holmes somberly replies from the front seat.
It kind of makes her want to cry again too. She’s not sure why.
She nearly tuts. “Oh I think you know.”
Well, in for a penny -
Well. He can’t say he exactly
“How many?”
She heard a gunshot. And the bad people are still here.
“Is my Daddy dead?” she whispers after a loaded moment and the thought winds him.
“Like the detective?”
Lestrade cups the back of Sherlock’s neck and brings their foreheads together. Mycroft hears, “I missed you, you bastard,” and he has to swallow hard.
Considering he hasn’t slept a wink all night, Mycroft will not begrudge himself a travel mug full of strong coffee for the ride to Sussex. London traffic will be a nightmare as it is, leaving at the hour they are, but needs must and his need is unimpeachable.
Mycroft listens to the heavy thud of his steps and waits until the front door closes before moving towards the window. On the street, Lestrade catches the keys Agent Mullens tosses at him, before looking up at the window and raising his fist. Mycroft nods, watching as his brother berates the Inspector for fraternizing with the enemy. His words are loud enough to seep the through the pane:
When he next wakes, he’s lying down on a gurney, there’s a blood bag hooked up to his arm, and his not-wife is sitting beside him, fiddling with a mobile between steady hands.
“Take me to the crime,” he whispers, shaking his head to dislodge unwanted ghosts and phantom pains.
He scoffs. It gets caught in his throat. “How do you know?”
She knows there’s no way to still smell her father on the sheets, but she tries anyway, finding comfort in the gesture regardless.
he had said to him that day in hospital so long ago. And John did. But when he tried to right his wife’s wrongs, when he stormed into Mycroft’s office and asked what the plan was, Mycroft let him down.

Mycroft shifts and holds his umbrella in a white-knuckled grip.
If Lestrade is surprised by that information, he doesn’t show it. He merely shoves his hands into his pockets and rocks back on his heels, and Mycroft wonders what it must be like to have a friend resurrected twice over.
He stumbles from the room, preferring his brother witness this very human moment than wake the child who’s been through enough today with his hysterics. By some miracle, he manages to make it down the stairs without falling, still ricocheting off the door frame as he tries to make it to the living room before the sounds he’s withholding escape in earnest. He stops dead, though, at the sight before him.
Oh hi. Remember me?
Sherlock’s harsh voice snaps him back to the present. “You said he wasn’t happy!"
“Rosie,” she interrupts.
Greg is surprised to find Sherlock’s gaze on him, the two in ‘the two of us.’ Mycroft looks like he wants to argue, but there’s a obstinance in Sherlock’s expression that goes beyond brotherly bickering.

It was hardly ever a battle of wits with them, but rather wills. Who could cave first? But Sherlock, who had just spent two years trying to hold out as long as possible was simply… tired.
It’s always
He’s hurtling towards the inevitable conclusion he doesn’t want to face. He doesn’t want to see the tarmac or watch a goodbye that he’s spent
“You look like you’ve got it covered. Besides, you used to spend half your time telling me
He clears his throat to get her attention and folds his hands demurely in his lap.
By the time he gets down the stairs, Sherlock is already striding as well as he can over to the car. “Your services won’t be needed,” he barks to the agent that drove Greg. Said agent doesn’t move at first, but then he lifts his hand to his ear and nods.
But that was then and this is now.
Sherlock shrugs, an unsure and unsettling gesture for someone who’s taken down multiple foreign governments. “Maybe they were trying for another child.”
“Sherlock, you can’t blame yourself.”
The road is quiet and the cars parked on it are non-descript. No doubt, countless government agents are watching his every movement at this very moment.
He stands to open the door and his t-shirt rides up, showing the gun he has tucked into the waistband of his pajamas. She gasps and promptly clamps a hand over her mouth, but Daddy doesn’t seem to hear.
“Yes, love, and I need to get you somewhere safe.” He throws the covers back and scoops her in his arms. The air is cool on her unprotected legs.
“And we will,” Lestrade says, looking at Mycroft for backup. “As soon as we know what we want to say.”
“Okay,” he murmurs. “It’s okay, now.”
His phone pings a moment later, an encrypted email sitting unread at the top of his inbox. He loses himself to a timeline broken down by the minute (when it can be), to images of John, Rosie, and Mary looking like they belong in an advert for happy families, to images of just John and Rosie looking far happier than they ever did with the third member of their little troupe. There’s a bit of information on Mary, but most of it is vague at best and fucking terrifying at worst. The final attachment is a truncated medical report for W.S.S. Holmes. The majority of it has been redacted, but what he can gather has Greg nearly asking the driver to pull over so he can vomit in the middle of Marylebone.
that he knows the time for desperate measures is imminent.
Greg pushes his need to reconcile the woman he watched pledge her life to one of his best mates with the cold-blooded killer whose crimes were laid out in black ink on pale paper.
The plane ride out, with the ghost of John Watson’s palm print pressed to his mouth, was disgustingly simple. Turbulence free, even. If he was going to his death, he’d rather it be on his own terms, preferably with a crash over a deserted island where he could have truly lived out his pirate fantasies.
And so that’s how it went. John texting Mycroft every week and Mycroft assuring him Sherlock was still alive. It wasn’t much, but it was something, and each of those one-word responses was like a shot of adrenaline to his heart.
He tries not to listen to the murmured conversation he has no right to on the other side of the room, but it’s hard when it’s the only sound to break the silence.
It’s a Monday when Rosie drops her rucksack on the living room floor as John drops his keys into the dish on the table next to the front door.
Footsteps, soft and light on the carpet, ascend the stairs. They check her parents’ room first before passing by the closet and heading into hers. An innocent part of her hopes they don’t mess up her blanket fort and the other part hopes they step on the mousetrap behind the door.
Sherlock looks up then, sharp retort delivered by an even sharper tongue nocked and drawn at the ready, but it’s never loosed. Instead, he presses the mobile to his chest, just over his heart and begins to head towards his room.
Staring once more at the place where John Watson took his last stand, Sherlock holds his breath and begins his ascent. Rosamund’s room is at the top of the stairs, but he moves past it, sticking his head in the closet and eyeing the crawl space that John, in his quick thinking, hid his daughter in. Despite not having much experience with children, even he can ascertain that Rosamund Watson is a cut above the rest. Keeping a level head while hiding in the dark, surrounded by people who want to kill you is not easy.
“Of course, because why would she then threaten him again while he lay in hospital? Say to him, ‘You don’t tell John.’ Why would she do that if she was
The final, sharp turn onto Baker Street has him putting his head between his knees regardless to quell his roiling stomach, and he’s grateful for the fresh air that’s like a slap across the face when he steps onto the pavement once more.
The footsteps move away and the light is switched off. Air rushes from her lungs with a whoosh, leaving her lightheaded and nauseous. There’s a bit more banging before the front door is opened and then shut once more.
“Sherlock - ”
She hears voices rise and fall and so she tiptoes over to the edge of the landing, slowly getting down on her tummy and resting her chin on her folded arms to see what she can hear. She’s been at the top of her own steps listening to Mum and Daddy many times like this.
“Rosamund, it’s okay - ”
“Long before you were born.” And before he can help it, he finds himself asking her what he’s like. Sherlock, who used to know John the best out of everyone, is asking his six-year-old daughter how he has changed. He knows she won’t have the information he truly wants - does he still take his tea with milk but no sugar? Does he still arrange his pants in the drawer by color? Does he still watch old episodes of Doctor Who on rainy Saturdays? - but he’ll take what he can get.
Another car door shuts outside and he hurries to the window in the loo in the hall that overlooks the street, being careful not to rustle the curtains as he glances out. Three men are making their way towards the house, dressed in black, and that’s all the evidence he needs. He curses under his breath, shoves the gun in the back of his pajama trousers, and sprints down the hall, practically shoulder-checking Rosie’s door as he flies through it.
“Right, well. Do you have everything you need?"
But Sherlock paces the room, hands steepled beneath his nose as he mutters against his fingers. “He wouldn’t have burned it. At least not without looking at it first.”
at home. But right now, in this moment, as she stands in the doorway of the safest place on earth, she doesn’t account for the bullet holes in the walls or the puddle of dried blood staining the cream-colored carpet brown.
With the need for a brave front currently changing into pajamas, Mrs. Hudson crumbles like a house of cards, hands coming to her mouth as her frail frame shakes with barely contained sobs.
He busies himself with his tablet, reading the latest update from Lady Smallwood and waiting until the city disappears in the rearview mirror before turning his attention once more to the girl beside him.
Sherlock gives a sharp, singular nod and takes off down the hall. Much like the Roald Dahl book, Greg shoves the bunny in the pocket of his coat, its floppy ears sticking out, and follows.
Sherlock stalks over to the fireplace and pulls the knife from the mantle, digging it into a seam on the back of the frame and dislodging a piece of wood.
He watches it again. And then again, trying to glean any clues he can, but the video is framed tightly. There’s not much in the way of background detail beyond the tableau Mary has left on John’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You went into hypovolemic shock,” she says, gesturing to the blood bag. As if that’s the only reason for transfusing him - the shock factor. Not because her lackey shot a hole into her husband’s gut. Not because, if he dies, their child will essentially be orphaned.
So Sherlock stews in his worry, in his impatience, in his utter dread, until Rosamund’s tiny head lolls against the back of the seat, lips parted in sleep. It would have been so much faster had he drugged the jam, but he hears John’s voice in the back of his head:
“Now?” he harshly whispers and Mycroft turns in his seat enough to make sure Rosamund is in fact asleep. He hums noncommittally and returns his gaze to the road ahead.
But Rosie frowns because she’s only known him through stories. She didn’t think he existed at all. “Where’s he been?”
Two years had passed and, deep down, John honestly assumed Sherlock was dead. But he didn’t say it. He tried not to think it. Because if he did, he would lose the battle that, every day, was slowly gaining ground.
“There was an… incident,” Mycroft allows, and Sherlock’s resulting eyeroll is practically audible.
“Not yet,” he murmurs. He looks exhausted, the adrenaline from the previous conversation waning.
Oh. Yeah, well, it has been some time. He supposes.
It doesn’t matter that he’s a man on the far side of 40. For the first time in far too long, he lets himself be held.
Something.
“He was never happy.”
“I’m needed elsewhere.”
Mycroft sighs. How to reply when he doesn’t even have the answer?
“I wasn’t kidding when I said I was retired,” Lestrade says carefully, like he knows it’s a minefield he’s wading into and he isn’t sure where to place his first step.
He’d cheated Death so many times before, perhaps He had finally come to collect His due. And in that moment, those many soul-shattering, gut-wrenching moments, he could only think of one thing:
“Shouldn’t we wait for him?” Lestrade asks, nodding at the mobile and then back towards the stairs, and Mycroft pauses, acknowledging the risk of Sherlock’s wrath and weighing it against his need to save his John Watson.
Anger flashes hot and vicious in his chest, but he won’t give her the satisfaction of reacting outwardly. She smirks anyway and turns.
Mycroft is just as surprised as anyone that Rosamund seems to know who Sherlock is, or at least that he’s a detective, but it still doesn’t shake whatever film has settled over Sherlock’s existence. Mycroft wants to wipe it away like steam on a mirror but he has a sneaking suspicion it’s decidedly more stubborn than that. Which is why he needles and needles until his brother cracks (
Mycroft tilts his head in concession and Sherlock hums, but remains silent. It’s possibly the only thing they’ll agree on tonight.
"She has you. Clearly,” he spits and Mycroft sighs again, but when he speaks, his tone is laced with annoyance.
Sherlock expects him to launch into an incident report about John’s abduction, but instead he says:
John knew.
Until he realizes whose mobile it actually is.
“Not entirely,” Mycroft replies and Sherlock stills, hands dropping down by his sides.
The master bedroom is all that’s left on the floor and, as much as Sherlock doesn’t want to enter it, he knows that the importance of the information it might give him far outweighs his discomfort.
She blinks her eyes wide. “Really?” She did
“Do you have anything appropriate for a child to eat?” he asks instead as he leads Rosamund over to the table in the corner. “Breakfast was rather early this morning.”
Mycroft isn’t familiar with it, but clearly the little girl is as she gasps and leans forward, getting permission from Mrs. Hudson before clutching it to her chest. Sherlock then steps forward and places a clearly well-worn copy of a Roald Dahl book on the table, and finally, the spark of life that Mycroft hasn’t seen on Rosamund’s face since she stood in the middle of Sherlock’s kitchen and defiantly muttered,
that won’t, even under these circumstances, ever leave his lips. The fact that Sherlock is willingly leaving John’s fate in Mycroft’s hands is quite possibly the most difficult sacrifice he’s ever had to make. And he’s faced down death on more than one occasion. It’s also the most stunning act of trust Mycroft has ever witnessed from his brother.
She slides out of her seat and follows the man through the living room, past the bookshelf with the newspaper clipping, past the spot in front of the fireplace that looks like it’s waiting for a dog, into the sunlight that seems way too cheery on such a sad day.
He shoves his hands in his pockets and rocks back on his heels. “Where’s he been?”
It’s not far - she knows where she left it: on the side table in the living room. She and Daddy had read a chapter before watching a film (he does a great Miss Trunchbull). She’d ask Sherlock, but he’s already disappeared inside. His brother, too. Perhaps Anthea can help, but she doesn’t know her and she’s wary of strangers at the moment. At least strangers without the last name ‘Holmes.’
was bollocksing up
The statement is so surprising, he barks out a laugh that finally brings a smile to her face as the rest of them join in.
“Sherlock. He needs you.”
“Did you miss me?”
“There are some bad people coming.”
Mycroft hears Sherlock’s sharp inhale, because there’s nothing they’d all love more than to have the chance to tell John that, but Mycroft resists the urge to comfort him. Though their fangs have been filed back in the wake of Dr. Watson’s abduction, there’s only so far the amnesty extends. Mycroft knows any sort of gesture wouldn’t be welcome, even if it is in the spirit of breaking the melancholy that’s settled over the room. Thankfully, Lestrade rises to the occasion instead.
Mycroft tampers down his exasperation. If the situation weren’t quite so dire, Sherlock would most definitely be pouting. “Why does Dr. Watson do anything? Perhaps he didn’t want to involve you given the fact that his wife had just tried to murder you.”
He finds himself thinking of the photograph missing from the wall; the one he noticed just as he was drifting off. He should have known then - he’d seen Mary direct more than a few dirty looks in its direction - but he had let sleep carry him, comforted by the notion that he’d look for the picture in the morning.
She must clock the confusion on his face because she smiles. “Oh, I’ll miss seeing that expression. It always was one of my favorites: dubious perplexity. John Watson, always a step behind.” She flicks the wedding band and it bounces off his knee before hitting the concrete with a tinny skitter. “Should be a view you’re used to.”
Life has moved on without him and the proof of it is playing out right in front of his eyes.
Funny, considering how his relationship with John began, that Sherlock is the one limping now. Funny in a way that’s not really funny at all.
he hears. It sounds like his favorite madman.
A mobile chimes on the coffee table and Mycroft glares at it for breaking the precariously peaceful concentration that had formed on his brother’s face -
"Living," Mycroft replies.
Sherlock looks back and rolls his eyes, but Greg can practically see his body vibrating with the itch to know
Then Sherlock came back and Mary said yes and John didn’t know who he was anymore.
When Mycroft looks over his shoulder, his brother is clad in his Belstaff and any traces of vulnerability from the last few minutes are gone from his face. “We made it eight hours together without you and she the six years before that.” The tone is lazy but the words are sharp. “I think we’ll survive.”
And boy did he ever.
“Tell you what,” Sherlock says, “how about I turn it off, but I stay out here, just until you fall asleep.”
“Okay,” she whispers. “That would be good.”
And finally, the thing Mycroft has been waiting for all day, ever since Sherlock walked into John Watson’s home with hope and walked out with none, comes to pass.
Martha Hudson is not the first to ask that question nor does Mycroft believe she’ll be the last. He doesn’t know what John has told her about Mary Morstan, but she’s no fool. Perhaps he is, though, if he didn’t realize they all seemed to have been waiting for this particular house of cards to fall. John was the only one who was prepared for it.
God, Greg’s missed this. Missed
Lestrade steps closer to Sherlock and places a comforting hand on his shoulder. “You said he never would have burned it.”
She shakes in the cold and holds her breath until she physically can’t. Then she gasps and starts all over again. She can still hear people in the house. They must be the bad people because there’s more than one so it can’t be Daddy.
Mycroft just nods and attempts what he hopes is a reassuring smile.
“Mary was wearing this at Leinster Gardens,” Sherlock replies. His palm cups the red flower with what looks like a pearl center. He leans in closer and studies it. Greg pretends not to notice his hand trembling.
The look Sherlock gives him is a pick to Mycroft’s purportedly icy heart, and Lestrade lifts his arms in an effort to convey,
“Rosamund said she heard gunshots,” Mycroft murmurs and Sherlock’s world upends itself.
“Swords down, boys,” Lestrade mutters. “Same team, yeah?”
“Wait,” Sherlock blurts suddenly, finally stepping into the room. “Rewind.”
Her chest hurts so much she gasps for breath.
“I know he has,” Mycroft replies as he stares at a tablet that seems to have magically appeared in his hand. “Puddle of blood found at the scene was just confirmed to belong to one John H. Watson.”
Like last time.
Greg’s lips quirk in a half-smile and he shrugs. “Grew apart. Pub nights became more and more infrequent. John was needed more and more at home - ”
“Long before you were born,” he murmurs, looking sad again.
he remembered thinking, watching him climb the steps to that plane.
“We are,” Sherlock murmurs, tugging her tighter to his side.
Must be the child.
“It was dark, but the light caught it. I thought it was a misaimed sniper laser.” He runs his thumb over the necklace, before pulling it from the stand. “I didn’t recognize it the last time she wore it. Granted, I was dying at the time, but…” He looks up and Greg inhales at the sight of tears in his eyes.
Mycroft nods.
The mobile in his inside jacket pocket vibrates against his chest and he pulls it out to see a text from Lady Smallwood.
His thumb hovers over the video, but something halts his hand. There’s something inherently wrong about being the Holmes that hears John Watson’s words first.
“He’s… actually been back for some time, but living in the country. I apologize for the nature of this reveal, but circumstances beyond my control have intervened. I fear he’ll have to come back to Baker Street for a stretch of time.”
“Daddy!” Her hair is matted to her forehead and she’s working herself up into full-on hyperventilation.
Mycroft offers a hand and Sherlock stares at it for a moment, wondering if this is now how they exist. If the time for playful disdain is over and real emotions take over. The world may implode, but he takes it anyway and allows himself to be hauled to unsteady feet. His knee loudly protests as he makes his way over to the door, smoothing down his shirt and running a hand through his hair, which is more than he did when he met the Queen.
Sherlock licks his lips as he lowers the instrument from his shoulder. Greg knows the answer the second before it comes:
He tries to set her down on the seat, but she won’t release the hold her arms have around his neck. He’s leaving with her it seems. He had hoped to put her in the car and continue his exploration, but John would never forgive him if he left his daughter alone in such a state.
John gestured to him, murmuring, “Dispassionate brother,” before pointing at himself and spitting out, “Doting husband. Did you really expect me to stay with the woman who tried to murder my best friend?”
“Yes, she’s good,” he murmurs, eyes flicking up, burning something fierce. “But he’s better.” He levers the wood away from the frame and shakes something from a hidden compartment into his hand.
He had watched the plane until it was barely a dot in the sky, and he felt Mary’s arm looped through his like a cement block dragging him under the water that lapped at his chin.
He should have called sooner.
He’s not sure how long he ruminates, cataloguing memories of being in the exact same spot, usually after a particularly nasty row with John, wondering if this was it, if this was the breaking point that pushed John out of his life forever.
Sherlock stomps upstairs to pack, as Mycroft knew he would, so he leaves Rosamund to her toast while he steps outside to make a call, inspecting every surface as he goes. What he finds surprises him. There are wildflowers in a mason jar on the windowsill, carefully fluffed throw pillows on the sofa, and, for god’s sake,
John’s message winds down with no real information, at least not on the surface. Nothing apparent. Nothing overt. Nothing obvious. Ms. Morstan would have it no other way.
Greg pushes off the door frame and steps closer, still too far away to see whatever message lit up the screen. “Whose is that?”
“I was trying to respect your wishes!” Mycroft finally yells. “For
He clears his throat. “Mrs. Hudson, if you would be so kind as to take Rosamund upstairs - ”
“Daddy calls me ‘Rosie.”
“Okay,” he murmurs in her ear. “It’s okay, now.” He gently sways with her, listening as her cries become whimpers which settle into the occasional sniffle.
“Why did you let me believe he was?! Why didn’t you tell me?”
Mycroft squares his shoulders. “Would you have listened?”
Perhaps.
But Rosamund simply grabs hold, hooking her little arms around his neck and wrapping her legs around his torso, confident that he will take her weight and carry her to whatever her intended destination. He doesn’t care about the tears or mucous she’s getting on his waistcoat or the fact that her continued cries are loud and piercing in his ear. He cares that she feels comfortable enough to do this, to cling to him, because no one has bothered to put that kind of blind faith in him since Sherlock was her size and holding onto him just as tightly.
“Nothing is out of your hands,” John snapped. “You have your fingers in everything.”
“Rosie. Rosie should send a message.”
“Jesus,” he mutters, eyeing the dried puddle of blood on the carpet. He’s seen his fair share of crime scenes, the majority of which have been far grislier than this, but knowing that’s
And he doesn’t just mean the task at hand. He means the work in general, John Watson in particular, and all that that entails.
fucking knew. And he didn’t say anything. He didn’t stop it.
He’s hit first by how it smells - vanilla (a candle that was lit the night before), cinnamon (biscuits on the counter), and a metallic tang, the source of which Sherlock notices a moment later.
“What are you looking for?”
“It’s John’s.”
“Chin up, Hudders,” he murmurs after a moment. “I’ll get him back.”
He actually sleeps worse when Mary isn’t in bed than he does when she is. Her body next to him is routine by now. The norm. When she’s gone, the bed is a bit too big, the sheets a bit too cold, the room a bit too silent.
“Good girl,” he whispers, pressing a hard kiss to her forehead, before gathering her in his arms. “I love you so much.”
“ - lock.
“Look, I know what I was told. She’s not here.”
But the fact that something was clearly going on, despite the fact that he was being purposefully kept out of the loop, fueled a fire that had started to badly wane. He hated when Sherlock left him out, but he didn’t mind so much when it was Mycroft. After all, he had his work and his daughter. The routine got him through those days that didn’t seem to end, when he was haunted by memories of foot chases and late night takeaway and high cheekbones hidden by dark collars.
They walk back up to 221B hand-in-hand and Nana leaves her on the landing so she can head up to the bedroom upstairs to change. The bag that she packed the night before is already waiting for her on the neatly made bed and she pulls out her pajamas and slowly changes, feeling like every one of her limbs suddenly weighs two stone. She pulls the covers back and pauses, remembering that she didn’t brush her teeth, but Daddy isn’t here to force her to, and she thinks it’s okay to let it slide for one night.
, he thinks, crouching down as well as he can, fingers hovering over the nearly dried puddle.
“You heard what, Rosamund?” He uses his most gentle tone to coax the words from her mouth.
“How?” he nearly snarls. “She’s six. Not Mossad.”
How ignorant he is.
Sherlock never replied, though. His fingers ghosted over the key in the envelope hidden away in his pocket and he turned without another word.
She stares at him for a moment that stretches, kneading a second into an hour and a response into an indictment. As it is, the almighty slam of the door answers for her.
He looks at little confused at that, but doesn’t argue. Instead he stands and wipes his hands on his trousers.
Not ‘us.’
“To watch him grieve,” Lestrade spits, and Mycroft nods. “Oh that cunt.”
“And who are you calling?” He turns around, forcing her to meet his gaze once more.
Sherlock scoffs. “How do you know?”
His throat has gone tight, and he daren’t try to say a word because he knows his voice will break and Mycroft, the insufferable git, is
“Sherlock wouldn’t want you to throw away all he’s sacrificed for.”
John was sitting on the grass with the child toddling between his legs, running to pick up a stick or a rock and show him as if it was the first stick or rock that John Watson had ever laid eyes on. And because he was a good father, he acted as if it was, gracing the child with a look of utter amazement.
“You don’t look like you climb over rooftops,” she says, nearly accusingly because Daddy never lies, but the so-called detective merely replies, “No, not for some time.” He wears a smile but she can see the hurt in his eyes and she feels bad. She saw him limp across the room. Maybe he did once climbs buildings.
Daddy can’t be dead. He’s all she has. He just can’t.
Mycroft hands him the mobile. “In your own time then,” he says softly, watching Sherlock’s trembling fingers take it.
“Shit,” he mutters, hurrying down the stairs as fast as he can, hand clumsy on the railing, but sure enough to keep him upright.
Granted, if anyone was going to pull off a miraculous return from the dead - twice - it would be Sherlock sodding Holmes. Always had to one up everyone. Even Christ.
“She’s stronger than she looks,” Sherlock replies through clenched teeth.
But needs must.
Mycroft hears the click of the door, just as Lestrade returns to the living room, Rosamund in his arms with a slightly more composed Mrs. Hudson in his wake. She’s been dressed in John’s jumper, the one that was commandeered from the Watson flat along with the other spoils. The stuffed bunny is under one arm and Mrs. Hudson holds the copy of Matilda in her frail grasp.
He claws at consciousness, but the pain is making it hard to concentrate; the blood loss difficult to keep his eyes open.
He shakes his head again. “Mary did. Before she left.”
He smiles faintly. “Yes, I believe you would.”
“Yes,” Mycroft succinctly replies, and he probably does, the git. Goddamn CCTV cameras everywhere. “Detective Inspector - ”
What would Sherlock do? Who knows.
“He’s happy,” he had said to Mycroft upon his return not an hour later.
He didn’t say anything for a while, too busy trying to tame his rage, too overwhelmed trying to calm his fear. Too busy trying to assure his heart.
“Yes, Daddy,” she whispers. She doesn’t like it when he’s upset.
Sherlock breaks.
But she weeps like - well, like she’s had her father taken from her.
Mrs. Hudson.
“You let Rosie sneak back in and see the spot where her father bled out on the carpet.”
She doesn’t hear much but she hears that, so she hops up and hurries back into the bedroom, throwing herself on the mattress and tugging the covers up to her chin, wiping her face clean with the sheet. There’s no way either of them will believe she’s been there the whole time - her exit was nowhere near James Bond-levels of stealth - but Daddy frequently says she’s lucky she’s adorable so maybe that will work in her favor this time.
He doesn’t know why, but he remembers the tarmac. Remembers the breeze on his face and the pain in his heart. He remembers Sherlock’s words, clipped and official but laced with something else. A melancholy neither of them could truly voice.
Sherlock’s expression hardens. “For you, maybe.”
). She finds her lower lip wobbling and her throat closing, and she doesn’t want to cry, she’s six after all, but Nana seems to know that and merely tilts her head and runs her thumb across Rosie’s face, catching her tears with the pad of her finger.
“Oh,” he says, blinking rapidly. “Would you... like me to do that, too?”
He moves away then, leaving Mycroft standing thunderstruck in the middle of the living room. He wouldn’t need a single finger to count the amount of times his brother has uttered the words,
“A more vicious motivator,” he murmurs, almost to himself. “Green was never her color. Neither was red, come to think of it.” He lets the photo fall to his right side as his mobile rings in the ensuing silence.
He hears her exhale harshly and wonders if she’s been holding her breath all this time.
She’s not sure what she expected, but it’s not him. Daddy had once tried to explain what he looked like but she didn’t understand why his cheekbones were so important at the time. She kinda gets it now. He’s missing the coat that her father once said was like a superhero cape, but the hair is the same. Messy and curly and just a bit wild. She loves it. It makes her think of when she was small enough to ride on her father’s shoulders (she still is, though she claims not to be) and used to run her fingers through his hair and make it stick up straight. He never minded.
She shoos him off with a promise to listen for the door and he trudges back up the stairs, taking a detour to the kitchen to place the leftovers in the refrigerator. He knows he needs to eat, but Sherlock first. Speaking of - he listens by the doorway again, but there are still no sounds; no crying or crashing from the floor above.
“One hour of quiet,” she dutifully responds, but her eyes remain on the weapon strapped to her father’s back.
“It wasn’t my decision to make - ”
Yes, up until that point, life was pretty good. She liked school and enjoyed reading. She had a best friend named Naomi and her eye on a puppy at a local shelter that she met on a field trip. Negotiations to adopt him had stalled, but she hadn’t lost hope. She had a Nana that snuck her treats and a Dad she utterly adored and a Mum that was gone more than she was there, so she made do. She liked porridge for breakfast and turkey and cheese sandwiches for lunch. She liked Indian for dinner and pudding for dessert, which she only got when she’d been very, very good.
Greg startles at the question but nods at Sherlock. “Ask him.” Then he glances around the room. “What happened?”
Sherlock stops fidgeting, the second of calm between lightning and thunder. “Never underestimate John Watson.” He holds up the photo. “He put this up on purpose. The poke of a pin every time she laid eyes on it. But, much like the man himself, there was something deeper. Something more than what was just on the surface.”
He looks away and gives them their moment, ignoring the pedestrian pang of jealousy he feels in his gut. And not for the first time, he’s reminded that when James Moriarty held a gun to the three people Sherlock cared for most, Mycroft was not on the list.
Greg suddenly understands why Mycroft insists on using her maiden name.
His home feels far colder than it did just ten minutes ago, but he leads them into the sitting room and makes a move to stoke the fire. He can practically feel his brother’s gaze on his back and, steeling himself, he inhales a breath and turns around once more.
“What. Happened,” he bites out.
“All of us, I’m afraid.”
“Rosamund, did your father ever tell you why he wanted you to call me?”
“Detective Inspector,” the agent greets.
on the shelf. Sherlock is going soft in his old age.
He smiles faintly. “Yes, I believe you would.” He glances around the room for a moment, eyes flitting on things here and there, taking everything in. Storing it in his Mind Palace. “Your father used to sleep here.”
Mycroft grips his umbrella tighter and looks down. “I don’t know.”
A flash of something in his peripheral vision begs his attention, but it takes him a moment to recognize it for what it is - a window high up in the right corner of the room, only visible because the newspaper covering it over has been peeled back. The ceiling is high, and John guesses that if he shouted, his voice would echo quite spectacularly. A light rain has begun to fall, pattering on the corrugated metal roof.
“Hospital,” Mycroft quietly replies. “Your heart had given out for the third time that day.”
“Rosamund?” a voice asks, and she jumps, dropping her toast to the plate as the man himself stands in the doorway. “Let’s be off.”
“John didn’t take it down,” he replies, running a thumb over the glass. Over John’s head.
And yet.
“Trust me,” Greg says, turning away and inspecting a nail in the wall where a picture obviously once hung. “They weren’t.”
“Your one caveat, regrettably, has come to pass.”
Mycroft nods down the hall. “He had to take care of something, but he’ll be out soon.”
“Oh.” So… “Would you… like me to do that, too?” Is that what’s happening here?
Lestrade nods, jaw tight. “Where is he?”
She finds her nose scrunching sympathetically as she watches him pace the length of the living room, pausing here and there, but not really seeing anything. He finally looks like a detective, like
“How?”
Mycroft clears his throat. “Early this morning.” If he had time for guilt, he might feel it at the hurt look that crosses Lestrade’s face.
“Brother, you’ve been back for nearly a year. Last time, you were back barely an hour before - ”
“What. Happened,” he bites out.
“Yes.”
“Here,” he murmurs, pressing the tips of his fingers to the center of his chest. “I’d feel it here.”
Rosamund’s eyes droop, given the emotional toll of the day and the lateness of the hour. Frankly, Mycroft’s impressed that the child is still conscious at all. Mrs. Hudson settles in next to her, beginning to quietly read again as Lestrade wanders over to where Mycroft stands at the window. Their eyes meet in the reflection of the glass, an uneasy look passing between them.
“Go get to know your goddaughter. If she’s anything like her parents, I’m sure she’s been listening at the top of the stairs for the last five minutes.”
Greg leaves them to it, heading to the kitchen to finally get Mrs. Hudson her sherry as Mycroft and Sherlock converse lowly. When he returns, Sherlock has magicked his violin from somewhere and is adjusting the shoulder rest and weighing the bow, reuniting with an old friend.
“Yes, well. Then I don’t hold out hope for you attempting to cope with this.” He follows the IV in the video down to John’s hand, where his wedding ring digs into his swollen finger. “Mary Morstan was born Sophia Moran, the right hand woman to the man known as James Moriarty.” He watches that revelation wash over Lestrade’s face, parting his lips as he looks at the video again and then back at Mycroft. “After Sherlock jumped, she placed herself in Dr. Watson’s surgery, to keep an eye on him. To make sure Sherlock really was dead.”
Taking him away from his daughter.
The bedroom door opens with a squeak of the hinge and both Mycroft and Lestrade turn to the kitchen in time to see Sherlock appear. It’s obvious he’s been crying, and Mycroft clears his throat and averts his eyes, admittedly (and shamefully) overwhelmed in the face of such devotion.
She didn’t get long to pack and being so close yet so far from the things that remind her of her father feels like it’s pulling her apart. She wants to behave, because she’s good at that (relatively) but she is a Watson through and through and Watsons are brave (
“Rain,” a voice says from the doorway, and both Mycroft and Lestrade look up to see Sherlock standing there, pale and gaunt, a specter floating in his own home. “Look up where it’s rained in the last hour.”
What? Fit who?
He stares up at the edifice of 221 for a moment, dark against a remarkably clear night sky. It’s been entirely too long since he’s been here. Since just after someone put a bullet in Sherlock and left John to pick up the pieces. Greg came armed with a couple of ready-made meals to watch crap telly and provide distraction by way of mundane conversation, but mainly to make sure John held together. To make sure he didn’t fall apart.
“Would you immediately have hung up?”
“It would be a location that Mary knows. One she’s been to before, a possible safehouse. She’d take him somewhere familiar.”
He hasn’t been in touch with her much - nothing beyond the monthly rental payments and even those are handled by Anthea.
He always did wonder if Mary getting pregnant was a mistake or all part of the plan. It would tie her to John indefinitely, ensuring her cover, but that’s just it: it would tie her to John indefinitely. Assassins for hire aren’t known for putting down roots.
“He’s not back by his own volition, if it makes you feel any better,” Mycroft offers and Greg scoffs.
“Don’t,” Sherlock snaps, and Mycroft’s mouth clips shut. How easy it is for them to fall into their old ways. It’s default, habit. A comfort. But nothing about this is comfortable. And easy won’t bring John Watson back.
“Miss him?”
Sherlock looks like he wants to curl up in a ball in the corner - displays of emotion always did frighten him - but he walks over and gently takes her in his arms, murmuring something in her ear that’s only for the two of them to hear. Whatever it is, it has Mrs. Hudson nodding and cupping his cheek once more before heading back downstairs to cry in peace.
The car pulls to a stop and Sherlock opens the door, scooping Rosie into his lap once more so he can slide them both out of the car together. She’s too big to be carried (or so she’s argued many times), but in this moment, she doesn’t mind. In this moment, it’s necessary.
“You son of a bitch,” he hisses. “Do you know how many times I had to pull him from a pub when he could barely stand in the early days?”
“Detective Inspector,” she murmurs, stepping aside and gesturing to the warm glow emanating from the hallway. He wants to wrap himself in it.
She stills. “What?”
Mycroft nods and quickly types a note to Lady Smallwood. They’re still waiting for the ballistics report, but it’s helpful to know how many bullets they’re looking for.
Mycroft wasn’t, but Gregory Lestrade was.
Mycroft looked exhausted and he leaned back against his chair and stared at the man across from him. For the first time, John finally saw the full weight of the British Government and all that entailed pressing on his shoulders.
Sherlock briefly looks like he’s in pain, before he slowly shakes his head. “No.”
It connects after two rings.
“We both know that’s not true.”
William. Sherlock. Scott. Holmes. The whole of it, for John to wonder about in the middle of the night and try to parse out
He should have known.
“Then
“It’s out of my hands.”
Mycroft’s always wondered why he didn’t take it to Sussex with him, though by his own admission and a doctor’s confirmation, his fingers are not as nimble. Mycroft suspects, though, that it had rather something more to do with the fact that he no longer had an audience.
He rocks back on his heels, unsure in the face of so much sentiment. “Well. If you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye out for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I would be most appreciative. He should be here momentarily.”
Sherlock continues staring at the car and the child within, inexplicably drawn to her and yet fighting the desire to run in the other direction as fast as he possibly can.
“She was at the pool.”
“Rosamund, can you tell me what happened last night? Anything you can recall.”
Dirty window, street light, brick building, left turn. A burlap hood yanked over his head. Darkness.
“I beg your pardon?” Mycroft asks but Sherlock points at her.
Well. Mycroft didn’t expect that.
Until his dying day, he’ll never tell his brother the comfort he derives from that hand on his shoulder as, “Courage, dear heart,” falls from his lips. “Courage.”
“Where’s he been?”
“There is no plan, Dr. Watson. Sherlock murdered a man. He’s serving his sentence.”
“Detective Inspector, it’s Mycroft Holmes. I believe I need your help.”
“And she’s John’s, so what does that tell you?” He offers a hand and Sherlock stares at it for a moment before taking it and allowing himself to be hauled on unsteady feet. His limp is more pronounced after the day’s emotionally draining activities and Mycroft makes a mental note to force his brother see his old physical therapist while he’s back in town. John won’t appreciate Sherlock neglecting himself, even if it is in the spirit of saving him.
He leans against the door jamb to the kitchen and glances around. If he closes his eyes, it’s like the last five years haven’t happened. Like Molly is getting blottoed on the sofa with Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft is pretending to disdainfully work on his mobile, but he’s really chuffed at actually being invited.
he had replied, naively. Pretentiously. Omnisciently. And he hadn’t been wrong. He just didn’t feel like playing anymore.
So he started to tell his daughter stories about a brilliant detective, and she listened wide-eyed and slack-jawed as he recounted their old adventures (heavily edited, of course). And when she was old enough, old enough to know there are some secrets you share with no one but each other, the brilliant detective got a name.
Which is why he’s able to hear the closing of a car door by someone who’s deliberately trying not to make a sound. Those skills and reflexes he honed during night patrols in the Army haven’t dulled in the intervening years. Stakeouts with Sherlock certainly helped.
“Good,” he echos, reaching up, flicking the switch, and casting the room into darkness. He leaves the door open though, and true to his word, she hears him limp to the top step and slowly lower himself down.
Then Mycroft says two words Greg honestly stopped hoping he’d ever hear again:
“I guess we’ll find out,” he says, shutting the car door and sweeping up the path.
“Daddy talks about you a lot,” she murmurs. “He’s been teaching me football and he said your team is crap.”
No, the second conversation comes after they’ve returned to Baker Street, after Mrs. Hudson has opened the door and not (shockingly) burst into tears. After she’s gathered Rosie into her arms and pressed lipsticked kisses on her temple. After she’s straightened once more and run a hand through Sherlock’s longer hair, letting her palm rest on his cheek with a look that seems to say
“No, indeed. If Rosamund is safe and sound, John will know I got to her. It makes sense I’d take her here, to Mrs. Hudson. A place she knows. I don’t think he’d suspect Sherlock’s presence. You saw the video. He doesn’t believe he’s alive.”
He slows for a second, just a second, and breathes out, feeling the thunderous thud of his heart against his sternum. “Mycroft, did John know Sherlock was alive?”
“We need to reply,” he murmurs.
“Yes.”
Another voice calls to him as well, a voice in a timbre of a decidedly lower register, but John Watson has been whispering to him in the back of his mind for the last ten years whether Sherlock chooses to acknowledge it or not.
He’d been so in his head that he didn’t even hear the front door open.
And then her breath catches in her chest, hitching for an unbearable moment, before a wail that’s probably been bottled up for the past 24 hours tears out of her throat.
But perhaps not as devastating as the answer:
“Serving his sentence?” he repeated, utterly at a loss.
Weaving around legs much longer than hers, she keeps her head down and her feet marching, all but barrelling through the front door that someone helpfully left open.
221B is both an old friend and a stranger wearing a friend’s familiar clothes. It looks the same and yet -
“Where’s Mummy?” she asks, as she’s been doing all too frequently these days.
“He’s not.”
“What’s going on?”
He doesn’t think, he’s not sure he even breathes, he just bends down and pulls her into his arms, hugging her small body against his own as he walks out the door with her. She’s light and he thanks genetics for her father’s short stature. Her limbs are trembling and every sob that leaves her throat chips away at the mask of confidence he’s put up ever since Mycroft showed up at his sanctuary that very morning.
“It was this,” he finishes.
He pokes his head back in, leaning his arm on the open door. “Hey. You alright?”
John never mentioned a memory stick. Then again, John hardly mentioned Mary at all.
He made it out by the grace of a higher power he still claims not to believe in, but like the apostles before him, he’s having doubts. He finished his mission and found himself on another plane, this time heading home with the ghost of more than just John Watson’s palm. John will never know it, but he’d been with Sherlock through every step of that journey.
“What’s with the bullshit about the initials?”
Mycroft hits play again and watches the pain in John’s face. The determination in his eyes. The sarcastic hope in the curve of his mouth that the person he’s speaking to will actually hear what he has to say.
They all go up to 221B and it’s been almost two years since she was last up here. It looks exactly the same - crazy wallpaper, microscope on the table, skull on the mantle. Sadly the cigar has fallen out of his mouth. Nana ushers her over to the sofa, which she sinks into, cuddling into Nana’s side and watching as Sherlock and Mr. Holmes look about the flat once more.
“A.G.R.A.” He shifts on the gurney but doesn’t break her gaze. “You said they were your initials.” And then a slow smile spreads across his beaten face. “But we both know that’s not true, Ms. Moran.”
“You will have to talk to her eventually, you know.”
“As a daddy?”
“Evidence,” Sherlock mutters as he elbows the door open - and then stops dead in the entrance so brusquely, Greg almost runs into his back.
“Us. All of us. He’s very good at that.”
- but he finds he can’t.
“We,” Lestrade repeats, the question inherent in his tone.
But instead of answering, Sherlock gets down on his good knee with a grunt and inspects Mary’s untouched side of the bed, sniffing the sheets before moving on to the bedside table. He scoffs at the bottle of Claire de la Lune before opening the drawers and rummaging around, muttering to himself. Slamming them shut, he heads back around the bed to John’s side and does the same to his table. Something he finds makes his ears go red so Greg steps closer and peers over his shoulder. Sherlock is holding an opened box of condoms, looking for all the world like he has no idea what to do with them. It takes every ounce of Greg’s formidable willpower not to laugh.
“Ah,” he says, looking a little lost before pulling the covers up to her chin. “Like that?”

He sucked in a breath and held it, just watching the tableau before him. Hell it is then.
