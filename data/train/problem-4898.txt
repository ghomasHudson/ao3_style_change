Generally speaking, Captain America was not one for reading tabloids. His team members could all attest to his very strong feelings on journalistic ethics and respect for the private lives of public figures.
They landed in a part of the mall’s parking lot that had been cleared out by SHIELD, setting down next to an ambulance. Across from Steve in the Quinjet, Janet tapped on Bruce’s shoulder, alerting him to their landing.
“And I'm trying to be respectful of that, Steve, I really am,” Pepper said wearily. “I don't like to meddle in people’s personal lives— it's condescending and ridiculous. But you two are both crazy about each other, and both big scaredy cats when it comes to initiating a romance, apparently.”
He hears a strange, soft sound, and shifts his hold on the cat, and suddenly—he can feel the cat purring against him, soft rumbly warmth cuddled up against his shoulder, and feels unaccountably honored.
“Android babies can go through decontamination every day,” Tony says. “Android babies won’t come home from school and give their fathers their colds.”
Steve had gone very still beside him, but Tony could feel the edge of his chin against his forehead. He was pretty sure that Steve was staring at him.
“Applied? Oh no,” said Kate, Hawkeye’s protegé. “I told Barton he could take the name back if he wanted, but the bow was mine and I intended to use it. He said if I came here I could learn to fight from the Black Widow. I’d be dumb to turn that down, and I’m not.”
They’d ended up on a detour of their detour, Steve insisting laughingly that they just had to see the 20-foot-tall statues of the heads of American presidents.
Steve shows up as he’s shrugging out of his business clothes, looking sympathetic and warm in a t-shirt and red Iron Man sweatpants. He whistles lowly.
Stark’s smile faded a little—dimmer, a little lopsided, but more genuine. “Sorry. I’m a terrible flirt. I’ve been told I don’t mean anything by it.”
He skimmed the article, searching for any hint of logic. The gist of it all seemed to be that Iron Man was secretly a woman, the incontrovertible evidence for that being a quote from someone identified only as an “armor expert,” saying that boob plates are ineffective as armor.
When Steve was securely inextricable from Tony’s branches, he put out a few pale green buds of his own: pointed, tear-shaped things that were tightly closed. Tony couldn’t have been more excited if they were his own, and when Steve’s buds started to open next to his, Tony nearly burst with pride and pleasure.
“Oh, you know,” Tony grumbled. “A couple centuries. I never realized how stressful baking is– my feet are killing me.”
“My mom,” she said, thinking. “My mom, she held garden parties. She played the piano. She dressed me up in adorable outfits that I completely ruined. Dad loved her, but he wasn't very good at it.”
“The traditional bridge between our worlds, the Bifrost, is broken. My father summoned a great deal of power to transport me to halt Loki’s transgressions in this realm, but the Tesseract was needed to bring me back.”
“It might have been,” Tony hedges, and flushes a little. “It wasn’t brain cancer, anyway. So you’re really not getting married until after the federal government recognizes same-sex marriage?”
“Diagnostics on the reactor say it was just a misaligned switch that came out of place — sent me into cardiac dysrhythmia. A very dramatic distraction if you can do it on command.”
Steve put a finger on the top of the tablet and pushed it down, gently, until he could see Tony’s unimpressed face.
“I’m going to put out my own feelers on this,” Natasha said. “Not that I don’t have faith in JARVIS, but… If someone’s recruiting within SHIELD, they have to have a pattern, and if I can find it, I can infiltrate it.” Her fingers tapped rhythmically against the side of her tablet. “In the meantime, let’s see what other anomalies were hanging around earlier.”
Jan shrank down to her normal height. “Hold on a hot second,” she said. “Are you saying you two aren’t dating?”
“I should have talked to him about it before I bought the ring, right?” Tony blurts. "At least then I wouldn’t feel so—“
“Yeah, it’s a nice change for me, too,” Pepper says dryly, and leans back in her chair. “Now what did you want?”
do that. I don’t—no, don’t interrupt me—I know it would make your life easier. I don’t care. You should have been on this a week ago. Either fix it yourself or hand it over to Atwal.” And she hangs up.
Steve flipped to a new page, sketching quickly. He drew the bot as he first remembered seeing it, leaning over one of the Iron Man boots ready to assist. Then he added its creator, resting an elbow on the counter as he pointed a tool at his boot.
He nudged Banner’s knee as he spoke, and Banner came awake with a start. Stark leaned over, peering at his face. “Hey big guy, stay pasty, OK? We’re gonna feed you.”
“I can’t believe you put up with my crazy,” Tony admits, watching Steve watch the cat and fairly bursting with happiness.
Steve smiled wryly. “Thanks, Shellhead.” He tapped at the tablet, pulling up a new image on the holoprojector. “The mist from earlier has dissipated, but there’s an opaque and apparently impenetrable barrier blocking the view from above.”
Tony held his hands up. “Okay, look — Hydra, whatever this is — there has to be some record of it in SHIELD somewhere, and I just had JARVIS neck deep in every SHIELD secret that could be accessed from the Helicarrier. Let me modify the trace and send JARVIS code-crawling some more.”
Tony waved a hand dismissively. “Yes, yes, who do you take me for? Of course I did. It’s fine, it’s great, except for the fact that I cannot decorate these cookies and I need your help, Steve.”
“Well you’re sure as hell not me,” Steve snarled, and bent to pick up the scepter. It seemed to whir coldly in his hand.
“I can get a hold of the big two if you wanna text the Wonder Twins,” Tony offered, already pulling out his own phone.
“More importantly, where did you get a Norn Stone?” Cap asked sternly, giving the teenager his patented “you-have-disappointed-America” face.
Tony’s stopped touching him. He leans into Steve’s touches as readily as he always does, will still cuddle him, still kiss him, but only if Steve is the one who initiates. Steve even notices him, a few times, reach out to snag Steve’s hand in his, or begin to sway into Steve’s side— but then, inexplicably, he pulls back.
“I’ll see if I can get an ID on him from SHIELD, but the damn place was swarming,” Natasha scowled fiercely. “I can’t believe this — Pierce should never have intercepted the ongoing transport of two such volatile objects. There were civilians all over that lobby, police, private security. Anything could have happened — anything did happen.”
“What on earth did you want to do all this for anyway, huh?” Logan demanded, leading the kid out in heavy-duty SHIELD cuffs.
Steve is mostly drifting back to sleep at this point. He can’t help it? He’s got Tony half-sprawled over him and talking lowly into the pillow near Steve’s ear, and a warm thick cocoon of blankets all around them both. It’s so comfortable.
Tony strokes his back, slowly. Soothing. “Just breathe, baby,” he murmurs, and pulls Steve back to lie down with him, settling him with his head over Tony’s heartbeat.
“I hope not,” Steve said fervently, collapsing onto the chair next to her. “I’ve been crazy about you since I found out you and Iron Man were the same person, and it’s not because you came out of that thing in skimpy red lace.”
“We Hulked through the floor,” he replied. “And then Hulk hulked his breakfast. Whoever built this thing sent us on a spinny ride.”
Everyone did a quick comm check, answering one by one in the affirmative. “Are you picking up any interference with the comms, Iron Man?”
“Who the hell is that guy?” Natasha frowned, her eyes tracking the man in SHIELD gear who had scooped up the case and was headed for the stairs and, coincidentally, the fire exit.
He wants—he wants to relax, to forget for a while. To let Steve work the tension out of his muscles, and fall asleep with Steve breathing warm and deep beside him. But, well, that was the problem, wasn’t it?
“Look, I need to tell you why I’m here,” the other Rogers said. “I need to make sure what happened in my world doesn’t happen here.”
Tony stepped closer and didn’t even joke about stripping Steve, gingerly maneuvering the fabric around his shoulder and over his head.
“Fury’s been wanting me to pick up missions for SHIELD,” Steve said instead, turning to stare out the windows at the city below, buzzing with emergency workers and faintly smoking. “I guess I’ll take him up on that. Get back in the game.“
He really does have to work— none of that was a lie. But normally, after a day like he’s had, he takes the evening off to spend with Steve, or in his workshop, tinkering.
The warning was shouted so quickly that Steve only processed it as separate words several seconds after a gust of wind shooting around him nearly yanked his portfolio out of his hand. The presumed culprit was gone before Steve could even catch a glance.
It’s not like Steve isn’t going to notice him getting sicker, eventually; he’ll see Tony’s meds or his symptoms and he’ll freak out and Tony can’t let him find out like that, he can’t, he has to tell him before that.
Tony sighed. “At least this time–” he started, then cut off. “No, you know what? I know better. I’m not finishing that sentence.”
“Nah. You know what they say: cold hands, warm heart,” Tony shrugged. He shot Steve a considering look. “Hey, have you tried any 21st century cuisine?”
Steve watched her slice through the crowd, all elegance and towering heels. Then he looked toward Tasha. She was gesticulating wildly as she spoke now, irritably brushing at the smoky dark curls some exorbitant stylist had deliberately left in her line of sight, and he felt a smile take over his lips. His heart beat crookedly in his chest.
It’s gone in short order, however, and the cat is looking up at him with the saddest, neediest blue eyes Tony has ever seen. It knows he has more. It can probably smell it, dammit. Tony wavers.
Steve blinked, knowing he was making what Iron Man had dubbed his “man out of time” face. Sure enough, Iron Man caught his expression and nodded to get his attention. “It’s from a movie called The Labryinth,” he said. “We’ll catch you up, Cap, don’t worry.”
“Iron Man has an identity to protect,” Bruce said. “And it’s not like they don’t know about your powers. Maybe they’ve taken precautions against your… sniffer.”
The elevator doors slid closed, and Steve pulled out his phone with the vague idea of texting Tony to see if he wanted to go out for breakfast. It was a second before he realized the elevator wasn’t moving.
“I officially forbid these words in this exact order,” Tony said, rubbing a hand over his face. “I’m
, Steve gathered from the pensive expression on Natasha’s face. There was something in her expression, like she wanted to decrypt an enigma and only one puzzle piece was missing.
At this point, every cell in his body screamed with want, and on the next nudge, Tony's head fell back, meeting Steve's shoulder. He leaned sideways, brushing their cheeks against one another. "Don't tease me," he breathed, and—putting one hand on Steve's hips—he moved back a little, taking in the first inch. Each breath came in rapid pants now, each movement punctuated by a long moan.
Bucky sighed next to him as he let his gaze wander over the walls of the dark corridors. Steve had no idea what kinds of memories were going through his head right now, but they surely weren’t nice ones.
Tony cleared his throat uneasily. “She left. Said she needed some sleep, but I figure she wants a bit more time.”
A crooked smile rose to Steve’s lips. “We always got along best when there was an apocalypse at hand, didn’t we?”
“God, I want you,” he murmured, his mouth licking down Tony’s chest, sucking at the hollow of his pelvis, first one side then the other, biting him just below his navel, so that his whole body bucked. Then, Steve’s hand pressed down on his groin, feeling the hardness beneath.
To his left, Sam, Bucky and Natasha sat, their expression thoughtful and just a little sad. Bucky’s arms, both the metal and the human one, were restrained with very large shackles.
"Why him specifically then? Why not any one else?" Now Pepper was just having fun looking at Tony's face as he tried to calculate a response.
Steve turned and Tony thought 'fuck it' and jumped in, splashing Steve in the process. Peter laughed loudly, thinking he victoriously was devious. When Tony resurfaced, he splashed Steve some more, who tried to shield himself with his arms. Peter, finding joy in it, joined along, albeit with adorably small splashes as his arms couldn't quite reach the water from over the floaties and the tube around him.
Tony looked over himself and then to the ball and noticed both the ball and his shirt were the same shade of blue. How about that?
"I know. And I'm so glad for that." The kiss was continued and Tony just did not want to let Steve go. Never.
Tony was feeling like he was in the seventh heaven last night, it was absolutely amazing. Just like he had always expected. Surely, Steve hadn't let him down. But come to think of it, had Steve even let him down there, he didn't think he'd have minded. Steve radiated that positive energy that Tony desperately had needed all his life, and now that he had it he was not going to let anything take it away from him without a fight.
He felt Steve's hand placed on his back, just there, not pulling him. Just there. Just holding him. Just touching.
Steve rolled his eyes. "You trusted a three year old with a secret. I'm not sure your mind is actually shrewd."
Tony didn't have anything to say but he opened his mouth to let something out of it. Nothing did. Except a squeak.
Tony's eyebrows raised and his gazed flashed up the Steven, whose eyes widen as he glanced at Tony then back at the child. This time in a scolding manner. Tony chewed hastily.
"You thank me one more time and I might lose it." Tony threatened, but in good nature. Steve chuckled, his shoulders not letting go of tension they had gathered ever since the call. "Now give me a kiss goodbye."
He smiled at first which then turned into a frown and gave JARVIS more instructions. The list had loads of names and he didn't have time for all of them.
"Tony, I..." Steve sighed in relief. "Thank you, you have no idea how big of a pressure you just raised off me. I- thank you." He pulled Tony into a tight hug.
"No. No, no, no, no. Do not put this all on me. This is completely your fault. And you let him, JARVIS?"
"Can we?" This time his hopeful eyes targeted Tony, who was pretty sure by now that this face was a Rogers-family weapon. He had seen Steve make it once or twice, or maybe five times, so far. And the genius happened to be completely helpless against it, whether it was the father or the son who made it.
Dum-E nudged Peter's head for attention. Tony snorted, knowing full well about the bot's attention seeking acts.
Upon reaching the park, he thought of something that he hadn't thought of in the entirety of last week. Him and Steve had not decided where in this huge fucking park to meet. That was the genius in him.
The elevator started moving and soon enough the doors opened. Pepper pulled Tony to his room and pushed him into the bathroom. "Get clean, now. I'm taking your clothes to wear out."
He remembered Steve's smile, where else would he find something as mesmerizing. He's pretty sure Steve himself does not fully knew the power he possessed. He had Tony completely transfixed, all by doing a small and innocent act.
One thing his father forgot to mention to Tony, while being the wonderful mentor that he was, was that money wouldn't buy him happiness. In fact, what he taught him was the exact opposite. He was taught to wear, use, buy the most expensive things as it would impress others, and thus be able to assert the silent dominance. One of his father's craves.
Some voice inside him told him was he was doing was wrong but that was a voice he rarely listened to.
Steve grabbed his face, a hand on each side of it, and brought it closer, smile never leaving his face. Even sitting on a bed and having Tony standing in front of them, Tony didn't hover with a significant difference, much to Steve's amusement. He pressed both of their lips together. The kiss was sweet.
He was thinking of doing the next date the typical, traditional style. A classy dinner to impress. He just wasn't sure if Steve would like that, though. So far, all that he had concluded of Steve was that he was extremely uncomfortable and edgy when surrounded by riches. That would potentially become a problem considering Tony is one of the foremost names of the richest people on the planet but he'll come around to handle that with Steve. Or if they do start getting serious, they will, of course, have a talk.
Tony looked at his tie and saw that he had worn the orange one with little blue spots. "Why, thank you, good sir."
Tony sighed, acting defeated. "Fine." He grumbled and picked up his fork to continue with his dinner, making Peter chuckle.
"And I think it's stupid to order in when you can make breakfast yourself. You wouldn't wanna deprive Peter of some pancakes, would you?"
"I think I said something about ordering in." Tony walked directly to the coffeemaker and started to the brew the well-needed morning coffee.
"Thanks." Steve looked at Peter with so much tender love in his eyes. Tony could've sworn he was a goner right there and then.
But Tony had thought their relationship was solid after that. Tony bit back on his gifts with outrageous numbers on the receipts, and Steve seemed pleased by that. But now he was doubting that strategy.
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony deeply, cupping his cheeks, practically covering his whole face with his hands. Tony wrapped his arms around his neck, holding him close. When they parted, JARVIS had already brought the elevator up to the floor, waiting for Steve.
"If I can't get back in time." He looked back at Tony who nodded. "You can finish your movie but promise me you won't give Tony any trouble."
Now, when he met Steve, he felt something different exuding from Steve. That man, who hopelessly failed to keep his emotions off his face, who was such a doting father, who was extremely sincere and, if Tony's asked, uncommonly pure.
"Don't suppose I'll see you around, then?" If Steve had a tiny ounce of brain, and wasn't a cheating pig, which Tony desperately was praying for, he should've picked up Tony's approach by now.
Tony got out of the car while Steve still stared out in confusion, and ran across to Steve's door, opening it for the man, who kind of jumped at the sudden movement on his side. Very confused.
"Not that I mind the view or anything but shouldn't you be wearing a shirt or something while cooking? I mean, even I know that."
"Sure. Where's my kiss?" Steve gladly gave him one and went for Peter. Tony did as told, thankfully Steve had already chosen the pan for this so Tony wasn't left to ask JARVIS which pan is suitable for the pancake cooking. Tony was shit at cooking, for the lack of better terms. All the years in and out of science laboratories made him know how to deal with burners and matches. After that, he was as clueless as a one year old.
Peter went all cartoon-style wide eye over all the flavors displayed before him. The different colors were all getting a few second of a glance from the kid before he moved his eyes to the next one.
"You wore a dress?" Peter asked, all curious and innocent. God, this kid was too adorable for his own good.
Tony felt like a teenage girl, thinking about Steve in such a manner. But he couldn't help it. Steve deserved to be cherished. In only two meetings, Tony had decided that Steve was a great guy. And he was the best of god's creations.
A while later, Steve came carrying Peter in his arms, Peter still sleepy. "Weren't you the one who worked all night? Or am I confusing the Rogers family now?" Tony said, as Steve sat Peter on counter. "I'll look after him. You promised pancakes, not me." Steve kissed his forehead affectionately and went to do as such. Tony looked at Peter and continued, "Huh? Am I confusing the Rogers with the other one? Did you work all night?"
Peter squealed and clapped his hand and reached for the water to splash it. "His first time in the water." Steve said, with a soft smile on his face, already recording on his phone.
"Why, Pepper, I would never." He brought his hand to his chest, in an exaggerated manner. "When have I ever done anything of the sort to make you expect such from me?"
He saw Steve close his mouth, his eyes finally moving to look at his own lap. His cheek was now cold, the contact was lost. Steve had pulled his hand back. At that moment, Tony felt like he was confined to a small, empty room that had the walls closing in on him.
Tony opened Peter's door and unbuckled him. Picking him in his arms, careful not to drop Dino, he asked the kid. "Wanna tell your daddy where we are, buddy?"
Tony cupped the side of Steve's face and joined their mouths together. Tony wasn't sure if he had ever felt like this before, but he was certainly feeling sparks in his stomach. He felt Steve grab the back of his head, bringing him closer. Steve kissed so tenderly, he could feel the passion and still felt like glass, like Steve was scared of breaking him.
The movie started and Steve eased into Tony's space, Tony had no problem with that. No problem at all. Except for the fact that his anxiety was tensing him up.
Tony locked his phone and placed it back on the night stand and soon enough dozed off. The knot in his stomach was definitely due to sleep deprivation. Definitely.
"No, it's not okay. I tried to tell them but they wouldn't listen. And no one else is available for them either so-"
There were pictures taken, of course. He didn't have to fake a million-dollar-smile for them either. He smiled brightly for the camera with the kids, them smiling big enough to blind a person. And that's what Tony loved. These kids might not have a lot to smile about, but if a subtraction from his bank account was going to help be a cause of it then so be it. Not that he was counting every dollar he had. It would take years. And he's got other things to do.
Tony blinked a couple of times, making sure it wasn't a dream. When Steve wouldn't budge, it seemed to be the reality.
"Hey, ready for bed, bud?" He caressed Peter's cheeks softly. When Peter cuddled further into Tony, the man picked him up and went to the bathroom. He made sure Peter did everything Steve's orders concerning the bathroom had asked of him. Then he carried the sleepy body to his bedroom where he had brought in Peter's bag. He pulled out his pj's, a cute light green onesie with small turtles all over it. It was a struggle to get it on Peter after having to remove the clothes he already had on when Peter wasn't doing much to help.
They were more than halfway through the movie when Steve's phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket and saw the contact name. He huffed and excused himself to walk a few steps away and answer. Peter was clearly disturbed and looking at Steve sadly. Tony patted his head and brought his attention back to the screen. Thankfully, the toddler attention span didn't take long for Peter to be immersed in the Pixar world again.
When they reached Steve's apartment, Steve turned to Tony. "I had a great time, Tony. And I wanted to apologize for being a bit too... stuck up. I didn't mean to, it's just happened and I was overwhelmed-"
Steve's face slowly broke and tears poured out of his eyes, lowering head to hold it in his hands. Tony didn't waste time in coming closer and wrapping his arms around Steve's trembling body as his boyfriend wept. He brought Steve's head to rest his shoulder. He rubbed Steve's back, pressed kisses on Steve's head.
It was discovered earlier on that Tony clearly felt something strong for Steve and it only grew the more he spent time with the guy. He was willingly looking after the guy's kid, for god's sake. Tony Stark did not just offer people to look after their kids. Sure, he'd pay someone to do it, but never himself.
He brushed his fingers over Steve's blond hair. Then ran the tips of his fingers across the side of his forehead, then the cheekbone, and down the cheek. The skin was really soft under his own. He pulled his hand back and got comfortable. He then reached his hand to tangle with Steve's hair, unable to stop brushing through those soft strands.
"And I know we haven't known each other very long. But I want to change that. I want to know you. And little Peter. And that nameless uncle you guys keep bringing up. And I want to show you that even after such a little time, I don't find myself thinking that this might not have a future. That is completely up to you, by the way. What I want is to make sure you know that I know that you're not someone after my name or money or fame or any of that bullshit. I know that. Which is exactly why we are even here in the first place. And Pepper seems to like you."
Tony could see Steve's expressions turning confused by the minute in the passenger seat while Tony drove.
Their eyes met again and if Tony had said this before he will say it again, he could and would drown in those mesmerising eyes. Any day, any moment.
"I don't know, sir. I was asking the same question considering yourself during the 90's and you were quite young at the time."
Steve just shrugged and they went to the room with the giant screen and Peter ran to a bean bag and threw his body on it.
"We weren't ever together but she was my best friend. Y'know?" No, Tony didn't know but he wasn't self-centered enough to say that. "She was all I had. Apart from Bucky."
"Good luck finding a new babysitter." Pepper cheerfully said. Tony hung up the phone and shoved it in his pocket.
The dinner was amazing. The sauce was incredible, Tony could kiss Steve's hands for making it. And he would. The compliments did not cease throughout dinner and Steve was proud of it. Peter mentioned how his uncle Bucky loved his daddy's pasta too.
"Of course." Tony tried covering up his shock at being asked. If he wasn't ever able to do so with his own father, he wasn't going to let the kid down.
"Yes, we are!" Peter nodded, Tony doubted he knew the meaning of lovable but whatever, reaching his arms for Steve to hold him. Steve did so without hesitation and kissed his son's cheeks. "Thank you, honey."
Steve smiled at him, eyes were still sad, but Tony could see he appreciated Tony lightening up the mood. Surely he was incapable of it himself. "Rain check?"
"Well, I'll... I'll see you next week then?" Steve had sounded so nervous and so damn afraid of rejection that Tony had
"What can I say, I was really pretty as a teenager." Tony said, prideful. Half mocking and half actual pride.
Okay, so a misjudgment could easily be made about him. He loved the kids. Absolutely loved them. They were adorable and so, so lovely. Definitely didn't deserve to be in some orphanage. But Tony was determined to do what he could.
He was so close to staying put in his lab, maybe create a new element, just to have an excuse to not go. It wasn't helping that Pepper kept pestering him about it. She claimed it as giving his word and thus it would be odious of him to turn back now. Curse her. Like Tony wasn't kicking himself for showing interest in the first place and now planning on not going.
He laid next to him when Peter pushed the empty bottle away, Tony took it and placed it on the nightstand. "Would you like a story, dear?"
Steve turned his head to Tony and looked at him, amused but not saying anything about the matter. "Chinese is fine, love."
Tony was taken aback by that. "Steve, you have me... You know that right? I mean... It's not an issue for me."
After Steve's continuous guarantee to everything Tony had offered, the man was totally lost. Steve didn't object to anything.
Tony did, in fact, stared at the blush that spread across Steve's face at the the nickname and he just loved it. He decided that the nicknames are going to stay.
Sometime around the whole week, Tony was busy in his workshop. Inventing was what he did. He was in the process of perfecting the new software he had been working on when JARVIS interrupted.
"What? No. No, no, no. Absolutely not. Steve. I would never think like that of you. C'mon- okay, I get it that it might seem that way but it's not. You have my word. I am interested in getting to know you above everything else."
Tony sighed heavily. "I thought... You seemed so tense... Since you got here. I didn't know why. I didn't know what to think of. And my fucked up brain led me to think that you wanted out. I'm sorry. I ruined tonight, I'm sorry. But I was so scared. I don't- I don't wanna lose you. You're the best thing that's happened to me in forever, I don't wanna lose that."
"Yeah, I'm sorry. Daddy said you don't wear suits for fun time. Park is fun time." Wow, the Peter kid was adorable. Tony could actually see the contrite look in his wide, brown eyes.
“Alright, we’re set up and good to go. Fury’s going to release the helicarrier footage to us at a later date, so for right now it’s just what JARVIS has been able to compile from OTS footage and the Tower’s own surveillance systems,” Stark explained, walking in from the kitchen and gesturing one-handed at the screen array in front of them. “And I brought popcorn.”
The days got slowly warmer. Pepper began to bloom, eager and glowing orange around the edges. When Tony smelled her perfume he thought longingly of the spring before and curled his leaves tighter, determined to repress the new growth on his branches.
“It seems that whoever was behind this didn’t have the brains to come up with riddles for us, tragically.”
He was hot. Really, instantly hot, in a way that ran the chill out of his bones, lit him up inside with the warm, gentle slide of Steve’s lips on his. Tony just kissed back insistently, carried again by that strange need to bury himself in Steve’s chest. He couldn’t do that, but he could suck on Steve’s lower lip, he could lick his way into Steve’s mouth and do his best to tangle their limbs together inextricably.
Maybe he hadn’t upset him. Maybe he was imagining it. Steve quickened his steps a little so that he was walking next to Iron Man instead of behind him, and turned to give his Shellhead a friendly smile.
The human came outside and took pictures of Tony, its weird fleshy face gleaming with pleasure. Rhodey and Pepper both agreed it was the most spectacular bloom they’d ever seen from Tony.
“Not even a little bit, no.” Banner pulled a jacket over his face. “Just wake me up again when the food gets here, I don’t care what it is.”
“Really? I can’t,” Steve grinned, and oof’d as Tony got him in the solar plexus with a bony elbow. Laughing, he kissed Tony’s still-damp hair, the skin above his ear, the edge of his eyelid. Grudgingly Tony snuggled against him for warmth.
Steve restrained the urge to scowl. On the one hand, he hated being out of the loop. On the other, Iron Man had shown him so many bizarre, alarming, and outright disturbing things in the name of a cultural education that Steve was inclined to trust his word when he said something was too extreme.
He was only slightly more helpful regarding dating in the 21st century than the online articles he’d warned Steve away from, but no one was perfect.
She responded voraciously when he ducked his head to kiss her again, putting both hands on the back of his head and pulling him close and surging up against his mouth.
Tony pulls the blanket back over his shoulders, leaning back against the couch and staring at the far wall.
“Relaxing stuff. It has lots of options: beaches, waterfalls, hot springs,” Iron Man responded, straight-backed in the Quinjet’s co-pilot seat. “I think Bruce favors the fly-fishing program.”
“Great!” Tony stood, then leaned over and tapped on the sketchbook. “Think about that art club. I know some of the kids would go for it.”
“Okay, let’s slow down a second. If that entire STRIKE team is compromised, plus Sitwell — and they’re taking orders from someone —”
“No worries. It just means I’m a little less pretty for you,” Stark winked. “It’s an honor to have you onboard.”
“You know the only way you’re getting me to rest is if you do, too,” Steve said, leaning against the kitchen counter.
“You’re not,” Tony said, bumping their shoulders together. “That guy doesn’t have me around to keep him humble.”
“I don't want to make her jealous,” Steve said without thinking, staring out over the crowd to where Tasha was chatting with a wild-haired elderly man. “I want to make her happy.”
Pepper blinked at him. “I may swoon,” she said. “That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. Forget the dance— after that, I need a drink. And Steve?” She raised an eyebrow at him, and gave a pointed look at Tasha’s corner of the room. “Please go talk to her.”
Tony’s free hand is up at his chest, tapping nervously. He has maybe eight months—at least five of them good, optimistically, and he wonders how long he should try to push it.
There’s a little curl of fear in Steve over that, because what if— what if Tony is sick? What if it’s something bad? Certainly Tony would tell him if it was something… well, if it was serious.
“Steve,” she said. He couldn't hear her, but he recognized the shape of his name in her mouth. He cut through the crowd to her side.
It didn’t even shudder. Iron Man made a wordless sound that might have been a snarl under the suit’s vocal filter and fired missiles at the wall instead.
“Definitely always. Ultron, Loki, Morgan le Fay, that second thing with Loki… whatever the heck your ‘Paris adventure’ was.” Giant Girl counted off on her fingers. “I mean, Paris. How was anyone supposed to think that wasn’t romantic?”
“You can expect the tentacles to be triggered 200 feet from the entrance. That’s as far as we’ve gotten.” She nodded at the labyrinth. “Good luck, Avengers.”
“Me neither, but that thing nearly got us heading the other way,” Storm said. “We were slowed down by the walls trying to crush us; it wasn’t.”
Timestamps appeared in the bottom right corner of the footage, frozen on a shot of them all cornering Loki from the viewpoint of the elevator. Tony ducked out of the room again and returned with two more bowls of popcorn, handing one of them off to Natasha, who promptly stole a piece from Tony’s.
Steve blinked at the kitchen. Every conceivable surface was covered in trays of cookies, and the smell of warm sugar was heavy and sweet in the air.
“Hey,” Tony says lowly, pushing the door closed with his foot and approaching the bed. “How are you feeling?” He sets the bowl on the bedside table.
“Well,” he said slowly, thinking a little. “A sandwich, first off. Want one?” He opened the fridge, pulling out ingredients.
“I’m just running some scans right now, trying to see if I can trace magical energy. It’s not working.”
Tony got a hand around his waist and hauled him in closer, so Steve could grip onto the armor with one arm. “A little warning would have been nice. Just a thought.”
“Baudelaire and Franklin? The deal that we were supposed to close today? At the meeting that you didn’t show up to?”
“There’s this stray cat I’ve been feeding on my lunch breaks. Really pretty, very sweet, entirely too demanding—you’d get along great,” Tony says hopefully.
“Tony, do what?” Steve asks, his heart going too-fast in his chest. “Do you not want to be with me anymore? Because I have never wanted to be anywhere else when I’m with you, I—“ Steve’s face is flaming, ears red hot, but he has to say this. He can’t let Tony think he’s anything less than sincere. “Tony, I am so in love with you. When I’m at your side, I feel like the person I was meant to be. Together, me and you— we’re something more than what we were built to be.”
Before his comrade so much as reached the car wreck, the woman leaped forward, trying to throw him off the steep slope next to the stairs with the force of her body. And then, she plunged the knife in her hand neatly into his heart. There was no wasted movement in her kill, and not a moment’s hesitation.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t do this because of you. You’re a factor, sure, but… I’m doing this because it’ll make everyone’s lives a little easier. It’ll give people a sense of security. That way, we can stay strong and prepare for Thanos’ arrival.”
“I really am sorry I didn’t help you sooner,” Steve murmured and drew Tony back in. Their legs entwined, not an inch between them, and it was so good he finally felt like he could just relax a little.
Steve lowered his hand slowly when Stane finally relinquished it. That Stane never even bothered to supply his own name showed how little respect he had for Steve, and Steve's smile only grew sharper. That'd make things a little easier for Steve if things deteriorated.
He'd kissed Tony, more than once, but… he couldn't remember much past the point they'd gotten into his apartment. He sent a nervous glance in Tony's direction. Tony was wearing a plain t-shirt and boxers, which amped Steve's suspicion higher.
Tony's eyes bore into Steve's, the blue eyes shining even in the night. The stars were doing wonders on the golden boy, light brilliantly glistening the man all over, the twilight reflecting on his pale skin and golden hair.
Steve looked down to see Tony already looking up at him, a small, delicate smile on his face, his eyes shining. "It's so..."
Tony didn't think much of Steve's statement at first, but then lying on his bed that night, while reminiscing the evening, a thought crawled into his mind. What if Steve was cautious about it because he felt inferior? What if Tony's assurance had not been enough to change that track of thoughts? Sure enough, Tony was never someone to back down. And he will not now either. He still hadn't asked Steve about what he did for a living. He'll get around to it. They still had a second date the coming Saturday.
So Tony sat back on his chair, watching Peter treat Dum-E like a pet dog, throwing the ball Tony had kept there for him, and Dum-E happily obliging. He had to stop Peter from climbing the bot a few times, Dum-E had to grab the child from the back of his shirt and lifting him away and to the floor after Tony's order of 'no climbing'. Good bot.
"And I can only assume this is Peter?" Tony looked at the kid, who nodded enthusiastically. Real cute.
Once he was clean, he looked at his reflection. He didn't require a shave, he thought. He checked his breath and brushed his teeth just to be on the safe side. Thinking he was good to go, he exited the bathroom.
Steve pulled out a mason jar from a cabinet. "Even a mason jar filled with raisin?" He raised his brow.
Every single time the man was asked, the answer was always a welcoming and a sweet, sweet affirmation.
Tony huffed out a laugh. "Yeah, well. I saw you too. Kinda hard to miss a guy with beauty like that."
"It's better now than it was in the beginning. Bucky got me a better job, well it pays better so. He was there through everything, he knew how hard it all was for me. He had my back."
Tony came back with two bowls of pop corn, one smaller than the other and drinks for all three. Steve saw him coming and went to him to help with the stuff. He took the bigger bowl and both of their drinks to the recliner while Tony stuck the straw into Peter's juice box. Tony gave Peter the smaller bowl and his juice and settled next to Steve on the couch and Steve draped his arm around his shoulder and kissed his temple.
Steve smiled widely and bent down to squat in front of Peter. "They do match! Oh, you're such a clever boy, aren't you?" He ruffled his son's brown hair.
The door soon opened to the bathroom and the kid rushed out, ignoring his father's call behind him in an urgent whisper. "Peter, wait, no."
The next day, Peter demanded they bake a cake because he wanted one. Steve always did have a sweet tooth, and Tony wouldn't ever say no to cake. They got the ingredients out, laying them all on the counter.
"Your blood pressure seems to be normal, sir. Although your heart is beating faster than regular. Should I sugge-?"
He entered the park and looked around. Nothing caught his attention. He kept walking, keeping his pace steady and his eyes wandering everywhere his line of vision could reach.
"Just because you can give me all of this, doesn't mean you should every time. It's not right. I can't give you all this back, and you- you know it."
"Oh, honey, you take that back. You take that back." Tony climbed over Steve who fell back on the floor trying to get away, now chuckling. "You take it back. You look beautiful."
"That's okay. We have floaties. Just for your tiny little size." Tony grabbed Peter from around his waist and tickled his stomach. Peter shrieked out a laugh and tried to get away from Tony. Tony let go of him and turned to Steve. "If it's okay with the pops."
It seemed like Tony was not the only one who's nerves were getting to him. "He got anymore questions about business? I got plenty of answers." Tony joked. Which seemed to have worked because Steve let out a chuckle, turning around, probably to keep an eye on his kid. The tension on his shoulder had let go a bit.
Tony fell back on his butt, right in front of Steve, sighing deeply. He looked around. "Where's Peter?"
While Pepper approached Tony, she tried following his line of gaze to see what had caught his attention that he seemed to have ignored all her calls for him. There she saw a blond man.
Tony sprung straight. His eyes open wide. He had to thank JARVIS later for knowing Tony's priorities. Maybe an upgrade was due. Maybe.
"Hi!" Peter waved a hand at him, which made him drop the ball and roll away from him. "No!" He got up and ran the few steps to get to the ball, picking it up with the help of both the hands, turning to face his dad with a large toothy smile. "I got it."
"I can't thank you enough for everything you are for me and for Peter. I don't think I have the right words, or enough words to even begin to explain what you are to us, to me. You matter so much to me. And I know there have been some... Some insecurities that made me think- made me suspect something different of you intentions but, Tony... I have never felt so sure about anyone, ever. And in such a short amount of time.
Tony didn't really know how to explain it but the man had never seen something so beautiful. Someone so beautiful.
Peter nodded and Steve took a deep breath. "Are you sure, Tony? I mean, this place is- hell, this entire area is-"
He jerked up with the support of his hands, looking at the other side of the bed, with wide eyes. He could hear sirens ringing in his head because where the fuck is Peter?
"No." Steve leaned in, bringing their lips closer. Tony put away the rest of the distance and kissed the man. Their faces all wet, lips slipping, but it was wonderful.
Tony looked at Steve who bit his lip and then gave in. "Whatever you want, honey. Maybe Tony can help you choose."
He saw Steve move his gaze from his eyes to his lips, his breath caught in his throat. Steve swallowed. Before Steve made a move to exit the car, Tony had to do something.
"No problem." No problem indeed. The more the main problem got delayed Tony had no objections to anything. The aliens could invade, for all he cared. The thought scared him, but here he was.
Having to see Steve like that had been terrifying and Tony was not at all a fan of that, in any way. That moment he
Tony shook his head. "I keep looking at you and keep thinking of all these words that are all over the place and I don't know if you know that. Like, yes, I've said stuff. It's quite hard to resist complimenting you. But, like, have I ever told you, like really told you-"
There on his closet door handle hung his outfit for the date. Pissed as he was about Pepper not taking his side, he could still appreciate the woman's sense of clothing. She picked out a casual blue T-shirt with dark gray jeans. She did not forget his signature jacket. He paired it all up with his blue sunglasses, another one of his signature looks. He pulled on his shoes and looked himself in the mirror, while styling his hair. His hair is not a tragedy, Pepper. And never will Steve think so.
Steve nodded again and Tony leaned in and joined their lips. Steve's lips were chapped from all the crying. But that didn't matter. He could feel Steve's breathing was still unsteady so he kept it chaste and simple. The least he could do before overwhelming Steve.
They stayed in the pool, splashing around, exchanging Peter, playing peek-a-boo with him by emerging from under water every now and then. They even left peter on his own, swimming by really, really close, just to give Peter the illusion that he's doing good on his own.
It started out great. Normal for any occasion like this. He stepped out his car, stomach finally filled with his sandwich. Glasses covered his eyes because he never leaves his tower without them. He was met with people in charge. Like always, he beamed when he saw the kids.
"You can come out whenever you feel scared, okay, darling? No need to be ashamed. Okay?" Steve asked, a small frown never leaving his face. Tony noticed but didn't comment on it.
Tony shifted his body closer, and pressed in deeply and he felt Steve let out a deep breath through his nose, never breaking their contact. When they parted, Tony rested their foreheads together as they both tried to gather their breathing.
Steve nodded and they pulled out things they wanted in theirs. Tony got the bread out and placed it on the table with all the other ingredients. They made the sandwiches, exchanging a few jokes and few kisses. A lot of kisses.
Peter turned to look at Tony and the innocent and confused look on his face had Tony rambling about each flavor while pointing at them.
"Oh..." Steve dipped his face down but Tony wasn't going to have any of that. He brought a finger under Steve's chin and tilted it back up to meet those beautiful baby blues. "Sweetheart, it's not a problem. We can do this any way you want, whatever you want. And you don't even have to either if you're that nervous-"
Tony knew he was selling himself out, big time, but he just couldn't seem to stop himself. Restraint did not exist anymore for him, it seemed.
Despite Tony's offer, Steve looked nervous and lost. Tony ended up ordering for both of them when Steve claimed to not know what any of the dishes were and asked Tony to do so. Tony, now, followed his own words and went crazy. Literally. Soon enough, their table was lined with different dishes, leaving Steve to just stare at the man with an open mouth.
Pepper would never let him back off. And he now no longer could quietly do so without having someone cross their arms at him and shake their head disappointed.
"I..." Steve stopped to think, looking all over the table, obviously still overwhelmed. "I don't know where to start, if I'm honest."
"Yeah. No one comes here unless I get them here. And that means only me and Pepper have ever been here. She claimed she needed time away from me because I was too much. Can you believe her? Ridiculous. Anyway, so I need my buddy here."
"Tony." Steve was chuckling at him. Of course, he was. "I can have him stay with his uncle for a few hours. It's not a big deal."
Tony frowned his brows, smile still on his face, shook his head. "No," he whispered. "Every sight has it's own merits. That was beautiful because you had your mom with you."
The tall, blond, and handsome had a toddler in his arms who was saying something that obviously was the best thing the guy had ever heard if his concentration and reactions were anything to go by.
"I am hurt. I'm truly hurt, Pepper. First, you disrupt my beauty sleep and now you attack me with such words. I am hurt."
"You too, Tony. Good night." Steve had quickly leaned in and kissed Tony's cheek that immediately turned bright pink. The heat swam through his entire body and he was left spluttering for a reply but Steve had already exited the car and was walking to the front door of his apartment building.
The sheets were all wrapped around him, like a cocoon. He blinked open his eyes, everything hazy. He closed them and felt around the bed but found nothing but sheets and pillows. He frowned and opened up his eyes again. The bed wasn't as warm has he had wanted.
Working numbers was what he was the best at. People called him gifted. He could look at any equation and solve it with time to spare. Biggest problems were little to him. He could make better any tech presented to him. He had revolutionized the world with his clean energy plant. So yeah, he was pretty smart, you could say.
Steve made sure the boy was comfortably tucked in and safe from rolling over and onto the floor. When he came back outside, Tony was resting his chin on his folded arm, resting it on the floor.
Before Tony could get a word in, the kid had already moved his gaze to The Incredibles poster. "Incredles! Dad, Incredles is here!", he pointed eagerly at the poster.
"And I thought I had missed you until I saw you in the park again. Believe me, I thanked all the gods and stars that existed when you agreed to meet me again."
Knowing the name made it a bit weirder. Steven. Steve. The guy looked like a Steven. He looked like a Steve. He wasn't sure which one he went by.
The door closed and Tony started tapping his fingers, trying to calm himself down. "Tell Happy to bring the car around too, would ya, buddy."
Steve shook his head. "I've been. This morning. Early. Bucky was here for Pete while I... yeah. He had to leave for work so..."
"Often enough." Tony made a mental note of that as Steve sat beside his son and told JARVIS to pause the movie. "Petey, I have to go to work." He saw Peter's face becoming sad. "I know it's really unfair because it was our night, right? But I promise I'll make it up to you later. Okay, honey? Will you be okay staying here with Tony?"
"But common sense, Steve! Common sense." Tony barely managed to stop laughing and speak. "He was three times your size! What even?"
Steve looked alarmed. "Is that why you think I accepted your offer? Or is that why you're even here with us. We're not a charity case, Tony."
Pepper's amused expression made Tony almost drop the act. But who was he kidding? Pepper knew him front, back, left and right. There was no hiding.
Tony took off his suit and changed into the T-shirt and trouser he had in the lab. "Have someone collect the suit later, JARVIS."
When Peter nodded, they started discussing what they wanted and what they could get that wouldn't be unacceptable by a three year old. Peter ran off to play with his toys that had found their permanent place now in Tony's home when Tony told JARVIS to call in for the orders. Steve had miraculously agreed on ordering from two different places so Peter's demands could be met without them having to comprise, or maybe he was too tired to disagree.
"Nonsense. He was an angel and he demands a little more snooze time. And so do I. And I bet so do you. Don't you?"
He guided Steve out of the restaurant and walked to the car waiting for them right outside. He opened the door for Steve, ushering him in, climbing in behind him. The car started and Steve took out his phone, tapping the screen repeatedly.
"I'll keep that in mind." Tony said, softly smiling. Steve looked away before he blushed again and looked at Peter, running his fingers through the child's hair.
"Um..." Steve looked torn and his hand went to touch his front pocket and it suddenly hit Tony. Steve was a single parent, he gathered, from the lack of the mentioning of Peter's other parent from either of the two. He probably wasn't well off considering him having to send Peter to that daycare. Steve was probably worried about the bill for the treats that hadn't even arrived yet through out the ride. Maybe that's why he was so silent. Tony had to make it right.
All of a sudden, Peter sneezed loudly, making Tony look away from Steve's pink face. Steve, too, looked at Peter who stared at his father and then started laughing loudly. "I made a big sneeze!"
Steve walked to the bed and dropped them both onto it, himself landing on top of Tony who let out a heavy puff of breath. They joined their lips once again. And as the night continued, their breaths only got heavier and heavier, mixed with moans and each other's names.
Tony kept sitting, breathing in relief. Now their deal was solid again, as was their business relation. Things whits men demand to emend business relationships, ugh. Tony would never do this outdoors again, no matter who says what. Outdoors were loud, and had people. And bugs. And weird smells.
"Not that bad? You stalked him? You pulled out his personal information. That's violation of privacy, Tony." Yeah, Pepper was disappointed.
He had to clear his throat first. "Yeah. Fine." He managed a smile. Years of training for the tabloids coming in handy once again. Steve seemed to not buy it though but didn't say anything either and leaned back towards Tony, facing the screen.
Steve nipped at Tony's chin and Tony laughed, trying to pull away unsuccessfully as Steve just wouldn't let go. Steve twirled with Tony in his arms and Tony moved along with him, floating. The smile just wouldn't leave Tony's face.
They ate the cake once it was made, spent more time in the pool, lazed around on the lounge chairs, watched another movie as per the kid's liking. Good thing both the adults were huge Disney fans themselves, they would never object to watching The Jungle Book.
"One at a time." Steve said, unamused, putting one on Peter's plate. Tony brought Steve his coffee and sat down.
"Hey!" Steve grabbed Peter from his armpits and raised him above his head. "How's my baby? Did you have fun?" It was like all the exhaustion Tony could witness a second ago was gone. He brought Peter down and sat him on his lap.
"We were here for the weekend. It's not like it's a lot of stuff. Just stuff I thought we might need."
"No, he didn't." Tony agreed. "But I was really curious. I closed it as soon as I opened it. I swear! Just ask JARVIS."
He didn't recognize his own voice. But that was not his concern. What he focused on was Steve's immediate change of expressions. Crestfallen to hopeful.
"Pinky promise." The toddler raised his tiny pinky finger. Steve wrapped his larger one around it and raised the hand to kiss it.
"Yeah... I uh..." Steve looked down, frowning, the prominent indent between his eye brows formed. "No, actually, I uh... I got a call from work. And they uh... Need to me to fill for a coworker."
He had a massive truck full of toys, clothes, and shoes be delivered to them. Every child got their things according to their own size and their own liking, Tony made sure of it. No one was to have something that didn't fit them, like some hand-me-down. These were brand new things. Tony never mentioned the price of any of it, always shrugged it off whenever questions about his charity donations came up. This all wasn't for him, it was for the kids.
"Yes, please. I love ice cream. Daddy loves ice cream too. A lot. Daddy says sweet things are the best."
Tony wasn't stupid enough to think of the threat empty so he got up and headed straight for the bathroom. A quick shower would help him feel better and more awake.
"Sorry." Peter came to him and offered his hand to Tony, palm up. Tony smiled softly and took the hand and shook it lightly.
"So you have to be at the orphan house by 11:30. I've made sure the delivery for all the donations will reach there on time. You have to bond with the children, Tony. Remember that." Pepper spoke, not once looking up from her tablet.
Tony nodded. "A very trustworthy source, if you ask me. But you're a guest, Steve. You're not making breakfast." He moved to go to the bathroom.
"Yeah, I saw that. And it's been driving me insane. So why don't you please just tell me and get it over with and save me from my misery. Please."
Tony had introduced them both to JARVIS a few dates ago so it was much more calming than the last time. Peter wouldn't stop bawling when he couldn't join a face to the loud voice seeming to come from nowhere. Steve had profusely apologized to Tony and JARVIS, which they both considered unnecessary. Although he didn't get who or what JARVIS was, Peter had grown familiar to the voice, enough to not get scared every time the AI spoke.
"I was never able to take care of a kid. She had a good enough job to do so. She told me I didn't have any responsibilities towards Peter, that I didn't have to worry about him, since she knew well enough that I could barely keep my own stomach full at the time and I didn't want a kid. But I was also the one she said would look after Peter after she..." He sighed heavily. "Made sense. I was the biological father. So I got two jobs, rented an apartment with a friendlier neighborhood, Bucky helped a lot, he really did. We both just tried to make ends meet.
Peter was just too adorable. Tony wanted to buy the kid as much ice cream and candies he would wish for. He wouldn't back down from buying him the toys he wanted either. And to think Tony didn't want to come here in the first place and now he was completely smitten over Steve's kid.
'Could use the exercise'. Tony shook his head and went to a bench to sit down waiting for the jackass he had to pretend to like for the next hour. And just as he thought so, the man in question approached him. And, of course, a Rottweiler was on a leash with him.
Steve nodded, eye flooding again but not a drop fell. "She was. She really was." His voice so thick. "She was brilliant too. Very confident. Knew her worth. Helped me a lot through my weak childhood, when I was skinny and small."
So here they were, sitting across each other, Steve looking exceptionally handsome in his suit, that he kept saying was making him feel out of place. Tony had called beforehand and told Steve to wear a suit. He didn't disclose the location though.
Tony nodded. "I understand. Believe it or not, I plan on giving you whatever you want, so if all you want is a kiss in the bed, you're gonna get it with no complains from me."
"What happens if we don't work out?" Steve lips were in a firm line but his eyes were vulnerable. "What happens then? I can't give him that car even if I save up for his birthday, which I do. I can't give him anything close to whatever you can. What happens if we don't work out and I can't provide to him what you've made him habitual of? I can't let him down like that, Tony. I can't let him have something and then take it away from him like that."
Time was approaching and soon enough the redhead was going to march into his lab and pull him out to get him ready. He wished he would've invented an invisible ray, he could really put that into great use right now.
"Very well, sir." Came a very amused voice. Tony couldn't help but grin. JARVIS may be a sassy little shit some times, most of the times, but that's how Tony wanted him to be, that's why Tony loved him. Not that he'd ever let the artificial cheeky bastard know that.
"Well, here you have a real live one!" Tony patted Dum-E's surface. "Go on, he's friendly, and incredibly useless."
Tony thought it was probably a good sign. A scary sign, but a good one nonetheless. And Tony didn't find himself complaining once about it on his way back to the tower. Neither did he fight the smile that just would not leave his face alone.
Eventually, when Tony had guided Peter's hand and slid it across the projection, the toddler let out a squeal of delight and clapped his hands excitedly, proceeding to repeat the action himself this time.
When Steve got out, he gave the place around him a glance. His face turned sour, though he managed to conceal it. Too bad for him that Tony had already picked up on his displeasure. Tony wasn't sure why.
"Petey, lets just sleep without one now. It's-." Steve spoke, a bit of the timid exterior escaping him.
Steve turned to look at Peter, his face super close to his son's, respecting his wish to keep this discussion private. "Why don't you tell him yourself?"
"Whatever you want. You wanna play it?" Peter nodded enthusiastically. Then Tony grabbed his chubby hand and brought it closer to the respected poster. "Now touch it like this."
Peter was an ardent soul. Always jumping, always running, always full of life. And expressive. Very expressive. Whenever he saw Peter, he would remember himself as a child his age, having glimpses from here and there. Never would he ever remember his parents being there in those memories. He tried to tell himself that human memories can be flawed, but who was he kidding?
"Tony." Steve's soft, soothing voice brought him out of his breathing pattern. "Sweetheart." Steve's hand came to run knuckles slowly across his cheek. Then the hand settled to cup his cheek, delicately but firm at the same time. Like Tony was a fragile petal, not wanting to tear it but also wanting to hold it between the fingers, not wanting it to get blown away.
Steve let out a huff. "Yes, Tony, I know who you are and I've told you I'm not taking advantage of you."
This is what Tony had never thought he would get. Unconditional love and affection from people. Now, he would never frown upon Jarvis' grave, or doubt Pepper's loyalty, never, but this new little family that he somehow miraculously made and was a part of just boggled his otherwise very perceptive mind.
Steve looked at Tony to see the other guy already looking at him. Their eyes met and one and the only thing they both were sure about in the entire world was about each other. They could see the love the other had for them, they could feel it radiating off them.
Steve smirked at him and when Tony turned to walk to the bathroom, he tapped his butt, making Tony yelp. Tony raised a finger to say something but changed his mind and just spoke the truth. "I really like you." And then continued along the way.
Tony leaned in to kiss but Steve quickly pulled away. Before Tony could even think of anything, Steve spoke. "I'm all snotty right now." He wiped his face with his hands.
"I don't know." Tony mumbled. Now that he knew the man's name, Steven Grant Rogers, he didn't know what to do with the information. The name wasn't the only bit of information he now had on the guy, there was a whole file on him, and suddenly Tony felt guilt pinching his heart.
his small frame fitting perfectly against Steve's own, so warm and precious. The memory was so sudden, so potent that it had Steve gasping.
Needing something to do with his hands, Tony stood up, walked around the small hospital bed, and grabbed for his Stark tablet. There were already dozens of appointments scheduled for the next week; with the new Department of Defense committee, the Congress, the military and a handful of other organizations he hadn’t even known existed. He filtered through his calendar, copying a few meetings to Maria Hill’s device, before mailing Pepper to meet up soon.
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitched. “So you’ll take me to one of your former hook-up establishments? Sneak out in the night when I don’t notice?”
“Harder,” Tony pleaded in a strained voice, repeating it over and over again, breathing heavily. His fingers dug into Steve’s neck as his hips moved back and forth, his back arched, trying to keep Steve’s length inside. He was drowning in sensation, lost in the feel of him, and it went on and on until his hands clawed mindlessly on whatever part of Steve he could find. Every nerve in him was so sensitized that the climax came as an unbelievable rapture.
Now, Tony had always taken pride in the fact that the suit had about zero loopholes. Of course, being a scientist, he knew that, by law of physics, everything had a weak spot, but over the years he’d taken great efforts to make Iron Man as safe as possible. And thus, it came as a bit of a surprise when Barnes simply slid his knife between the suit’s ab-plates, and drove it straight into Tony’s abdomen.
“Like we did back then,” Steve added. “I mean… if you’re up for it. With your wounds, I’m not sure—We could take it easy.”
“Bucky. You’ve known me your whole life,” Steve said, knowing before it happened that Bucky’d lash out and accepting it. The punch threw him backwards, making him fall hard on the glass floor. “Your name… is James Buchanan Barnes. We’ve been friends since kindergarten for God’s sake!”
“What is it?” Steve asked, and once more, Tony felt his hand on him, resting on his shoulder where his fingertips were ever so lightly brushing the skin at Tony’s neck.
He took a step closer, then, pressing his own erection against Steve’s and opening his hand so he could align them both. “This enough?” he asked softly, while his fingers began a slow exploration up and down, getting a feel of the movement. A long hum left Steve’s mouth at that, his eyes glued to the both of them and soaking in the view.
“I think it certainly means she didn’t kill herself,” Stane sneered. “She wanted to speak with me about something
Anyway. The bed was a 2-man standard, and everything was kept in light colors. There were sketchbooks and post-its, a notebook, various mission folders, and even a few silly Avengers merch products on the window sills.
Steve curled himself into a ball, wishing, maybe for the first time, to be small again so he wouldn’t feel so horribly misplaced in this tiny bed.
the control. "Yeah, this will do," he breathed, now pulling off of Steve for real, and sinking back slowly while releasing a long groan into the air.
Which was why Steve spent a good ten minutes with staring into Tony’s blackened out phone-display, trying to put himself together as much as possible. He made a series of practiced ‘unsatisfied faces’, to Tony’s infinite amusement, before they eventually decided they looked as good as could be suspected under the circumstances.
Tony immediately reached behind himself, placing his hand on Steve’s cock. Turning his head, he glared at him with impatience. “Not getting any younger here, damn it, come
Tony swallowed. He glanced at Bucky, whose expression was unreadable at best. Without looking at Steve, he shook his head. “No.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed. Apparently, he’d hit a nerve, but so had Steve. “It’s still better than yours!” he snapped, pointing a finger at him. “Serum or not, this would’ve gotten you killed, one-hundred-fucking-percent, Steve. I was looking out for you, why are you so goddamn angry?”
“Yeah, no,” Rhodes replied and put a hand on Steve’s chest to stop him. The expression on his face allowed no discussion. “I’ll go bring him back and
Tony nodded, mindless with need now that he knew where this was going, before he hissed and threw his head back. Above him, Steve was still stroking his erection, his eyes dark with lust. God, Steve knew him as he’d always dreamed someone would know him. As one of his hands occupied itself with Tony’s cock, fingertips skimming its underside, the other was dropping to explore his balls with leisure. That was, until Steve moved downwards and drew the swollen head of his cock between his lips and sucked hard.
responded once. Wanting to try the manual approach, Tony opened the chat panel, when Steve suddenly dropped into the chair next to him. He reached for Tony’s phone, pointedly putting it down on the table before slumping forward, his head now pillowed on Tony’s left shoulder.
At that, Steve smiled at him—still loving him, despite it all, still happy, still wanting that future with him—and that simple gesture, it was the reason Tony’d come here. It was all of their million choices, the good and the bad ones, coming to one beautiful conclusion.
When Tony risked a glance upwards, Steve’s eyes were shut tight. Both of his hands were twisted in the bed sheets, and the sight alone had Tony’s bones shivering in awe-laced ecstasy. A moment later, however, his eyes flew open again, and Steve stared down at him, his hands falling to Tony’s shoulders. “Up,” he demanded. “Need you up here.”
The day after Tony had kissed Steve, the kid had all but exploded over the mass media with his breakthrough A.I. code. For a whole week, Tony was about everywhere, in the newspapers, as well as on television. Steve had been a little apprehensive at first, worried that Tony might seek revenge, now that he had his fame to lean on, but the blow never came. He kept his mouth shut, and Steve would have liked to say he was relieved but…
Tony would buy Peter something, like that one time he was to meet them at that park again and on his way there he had bought a toy car. It had a remote to control it, looked like a model for a really posh car, something Tony would own, and it was blue. How could he have not bought it? And Peter had expressed his love for it by hopping up and down and hugging Tony furiously and repeating his thanks.
"I'll be in the lab. So don't disturb me." Tony said, leaving the car and already making his way to the elevator.
Steve seemed to be on edge the whole time they were together that day. It had barely been an hour since he had arrived. Tony had wanted to ask but Steve would then ask something unrelated, completely changing the subject. So he thought a movie would help, though it hadn't been helpful at all. Tony didn't know what was going on.
"I'm Tony, by the way." He brought his hand up for a shake, putting on a charming smile that he had perfected over the years.
Tony nodded, moving to the trunk, opening it. "Mhmm. We're on a getaway. We wanted to surprise you and Peter was such a good boy keeping it a secret that I might just make him that rocket ship he asked for."
"Tony, tell me yourself what you think this was. Was it right? Did he deserve this?" Pepper looked at Tony, exhausted.
Saturday came sooner than Tony anticipated. He would be wrong if he said he wasn't dreading it. He was ecstatic, but his nerves were fighting to get the best of him every second of the days that brought him closer to the weekend.
"No, you can't. You're gonna bond. Talk to them. Ask them stuff. Interact. So the kids know who their Summer Santa is."
Tony rested his head back on the wall, breathing steadily. Steve hadn't moved in about ten minutes. He wanted to move and see if the guy was asleep or not but he didn't want move and ruin the peace Steve had finally found.
"Yeah." Steve said, with an unyielding belief. His eyes locked with Tony's, the other man smiling at him. "Like a family."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Just call the investor and leave the tower. Go home, go shopping, go to Africa. I don't care. Just take a break."
Tony's jaw dropped and he could not believe his ears. "You," he pointed an accusing finger at him. "You play really dirty. Really dirty. And in front of a three year old. Your
Tony smiled warmly, propping himself up onto his elbow to see Steve clearly, his other hand never leaving Steve's hair and the other man never moving his head from Tony's stomach.
"I- okay, Tony." Steve didn't sound so assured but Tony decided to let this slide. He had to remind himself, this was the beginning of whatever they had or will ever have. He cannot put all of himself out there on a platter for Steve only to later discover that there's nothing else left of the man.
Steve adjusted Peter, making sure the pretzel didn't fall. "I don't know. If you're here next Saturday around the same time, maybe."
"But why? What did I do to let you believe that? I just don't... I don't understand." Steve looked so lost, Tony wanted to punch himself.
"Sorry! Sorry!" Peter managed to scream out, between his loud chortles. Tony ceased his torture and saw the baby completely red and coming down from his laughing fit, collecting his breaths.
Steve seemed to be calculating his next move when Peter tugged his arm. "Are we not getting ice cream, daddy?" His voice was so shy and scared of rejection, it was painful to hear. Tony wanted to give the kid every bit of everything he needed and wanted.
A still air settled between them, daring them to break the solace their phone calls had given them. What they’d had in those last weeks—that had been safe. They’d refrained from the harder issues that would only hurt once deciphered.
It wasn’t out of the question that Tony might have heard of Captain America before, his face was on posters all over the country at this point, but Steve had no idea why it made him so angry.
They wandered the dark streets in silence. The girl seemed disinterested in him and in her surroundings. She seemed to have retreated inward, and the only telltale sign that she was agitated at all were her hands ever so often drawing into fists next to her thighs.
With that, Rhodes left, and Steve buried his face in both hands. He would just tell Tony, and make him understand that he needed some time to think about all of this. That was better than not talking to Tony at all. He shouldn’t let Tony guessing. It was stupid. It was beyond adolescent. He would tell Tony that he was attracted to him but needed more time to work through his feelings.
After that, it was a series of hugs and awkward first handshakes. Steve even went so far and pressed a rather sloppy kiss on Natasha’s cheek, when she approached him.
He cupped him then, eyes set on Tony's face, chasing any type of reaction he might get. He didn't want to be the only one to enjoy a good orgasm, but a lot of what came next depended on what Tony wanted. "Need anything?" he asked, leaning in for another kiss.
Tony shrugged as he leaned against Steve. “We could take the Northern route. I hear Lake Michigan is nice this time of the year.”
Steve’s brows perked, obligatorily slowing down the RV as the wheels hit gravel. “I didn’t think there were so many visitors.” He sounded terribly disappointed.
"Thanks, but I'm actually here for Dr. Banner," he said with an easy smile. He peered around the door but couldn't spot the man anywhere in direct line of sight. "This
He started to move past her, but she shoved him back, pressing his body against the wall of the building behind him. His head throbbed as it cracked into the rough brick, his mouth watering at the unexpected pain.
Tony’s eyes drifted shut and shot open when he whispered Steve’s name. It was breathtaking—the clarity behind those brown eyes that had been empty just a second ago, the knowledge and the wonder that was marred only with comprehension. Tony shifted, his hand constricted around Steve’s until he realized that he was likely gripping a little too hard. “Fury was right,” he said without prompting, as if they’d been in the middle of a conversation. “About the ship. Somebody’s trying to hide something and seeing how well it’s protected, it sure must be ugly. The drive is protected by some sort of AI. It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands. I haven’t… I don’t think I’ve ever seen something like this before from, well, anyone who’s not me.”
With a deep breath, he raised himself to his feet, putting on his old clothes with fast movements. She was right, of course, he’d have to face Stark eventually.
“What about yours?” Steve shot back and already wanted to swallow his words down the next instant. It wasn’t fair, none of it. He stared off, then, not looking at any of them.
“What happens now?” he asked, resting a hand over Tony’s chest where the arc reactor hummed steadily. He’d seen it going dark today, and even before he’d known what it meant, he’d known that losing the light meant losing Tony.
“Tell me,” Stane said as he twirled his cane again, the small orb on its top shining in the moonlight, “did you really think you could be happy here? You had to know that he could never love you as he loved her. You had to know he only wanted someone to distract him from his grief. Did you really think someone like you could be enough?”
Really, it had seemed like a wonderful idea at the time: Hooking up with Steve just a few days before New Year’s Eve, spending one of the best nights of Tony’s life with the guy, and another just-as-great morning, before parting ways and deciding to ‘meet up later’ again when they both ‘had the time to spare’.
Tony’s eyes met Steve’s briefly, and they were red and swollen, his eyelashes wet and his cheeks streaked with blood. He looked as lost as Steve felt—and Steve yearned to hold him, to comfort him the way Tony had once allowed him to do. He would have done anything—
“What about the Gauntlet?” Natasha asked as she stepped up next to them. She nodded down at Thanos’ body. The Gauntlet was still on his left hand, glowing slightly. “If we destroy it—”
“Yes,” Vision confirmed, and rose to his feet. He put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, squeezing it for a moment. “I will.”
At that, all the fight left Tony. And he knew that Strange was playing him by mentioning Steve, but that didn’t matter in the long run.
It seemed impossible to grasp it all at once. That Ian was here now, after all the struggle, all the sleepless nights. But taking one look at him, at his rosy cheeks, his soft skin, and his tiny—
Steve glanced after Tony, before turning to collect the empty plates, carrying them over to the counter.
“Through the altered projection, people will be able to revisit an altered version of their past experience,” Tony explained. “It’ll allow them to overcome whatever traumas they have. At least… that’s what I hope will happen.”
He hoped that would be explanation enough as he came to a stop at the stairs. "Now, floor and room number, please, or I'll start knocking on every door."
Barnes snorted. “God, how did I not notice that?” he asked quietly. His head rested next to Natasha’s, who was asleep on his chest. “You two couldn’t be more cliché if you tried.”
Tony snorted, as he opened his faceplate, leaning a bit against Thor. “Whatever else happens, it’s always comforting to see you guys smashing things.”
He took both of Steve’s hands in his own and led them to his upper body. The underarmor was a complicated mix of fabric and plastic impregnated molecular chains that was both smooth and flexible, and hard and impenetrable. The openings were at both sides of the upper part of the armor, and Tony surrounded Steve’s finger, guiding them until he got the drift and opened the fabric.
Tony, as usual, seemed to read his thoughts and said, his voice very soft, “Can we keep him in here with us tonight?”
Steve snorted, and he was probably grinning like a loon now. He only schooled his expression when he noticed Bucky and Sam staring from the couch in front of him. They were lounging there in sweatpants with a bowl of cereals each, and the only reminder that something was severely not right in this scenario was Bucky’s missing arm.
home to wreck,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. He could remember that moment so vividly. Tony lying on the couch beneath him, looking at him with those adoring eyes, breath on his skin, lips tingling from his kisses.
Strange had denied it--Why should he have searched for a timeline he hadn’t even known of?--but there had been a glimmer in his eyes, some kind of deep self-satisfaction for having been right all along. And Tony had a feeling he remembered all of it perfectly.
“There you go,” Tony said with a low smile, leaning in and dropping soft kisses across Steve’s chest. Gently, he pulled out and added a bit more lube before pressing two fingers against Steve’s opening. He gave him a second to comprehend, then slowly pushed forward. It went in easier than expected—he
“Then drop your shield,” Tony said, knowing full well that he wouldn’t. “It’s the only way to end this.”
“Which might as well be tomorrow,” Steve said, and despite the gravity of the situation, it still sounded somewhat amused.
He thrust into Tony, holding him close with one hand. Steve built up speed slowly, keeping a steady, fast pace. Tony was close, Steve could tell. He flexed around him, riding out the storm he’d initiated, gasping for air as a gut-wrenching climax started sweeping through him. Steve pressed his mouth against Tony’s shoulder, holding him still as he thrust deep and deeper still—his body almost pinning Tony to the bed now.
The steps were coming closer, and when they came to a stop right behind him, Tony noticed a scent in the air, and it grew with identity and made his heart pause.
Hours later, Tony jolted awake as he heard Steve’s tread on the stairs. Immediately, he noticed how his footfalls were slower than usual, heavier, as if he was very tired or very deep in thought. Tony glanced at the clock. It was well past midnight.
Tony’s lips quirked up in a tired smile. “‘s all okay, Steve.” His eyes were locked on Steve’s, pleading with him. “Trust me, ‘s probably better that way…”
Putting a phone inside the letter’s envelope had been a last minute’s decision. He’d only meant to apologize for everything he’d put Tony through, at first—to give the both of them some sort of temporary closure. But as soon as he’d closed the envelope, he couldn’t bear the thought of this being the end.
Steve smiled against his neck. “But I have to admit, I never imagined Tony Stark would say my name like that.” He kissed his exposed throat, then kept an eye on Tony’s face.
Bucky ran his metal hand through his hair, agitation clear in his stance. Then he caught Steve’s eyes in a firm stare. “Look. Steve. Back then, when we were children? I couldn’t always protect you like I wanted. Couldn’t save you from landing in the hospital every other week, and not for lack of trying. I hated that, I really did, but in the end, I wasn’t responsible for you being a stubborn little shit.” He paused, inhaling lowly. “And neither were you for me falling off that train. When I agreed to follow you into war, I knew what I was getting into and there are things that are out of your hands. What happened to me is one of those things.” At that, he cast him a tentative smile. It was the first real smile he had given Steve since he’d gotten to the tower. “You did your best, and it’s all I could ask for.”
“—what I can say and what I can’t, if I knew all the things I shouldn’t do, then maybe I can start to live with the fact that he’ll never love me as he loved her.”
He couldn’t say more, because Steve was already ramming his shield against Thanos’ chest. The battle that followed was hard but short-lived, because while actually beating Thanos proved to be very good for the soul, it was ultimately Stephen Strange who put the warlord in some kind of stasis. His pupils were still flickering, angry shallow breaths leaving his large nose and mouth, but otherwise, he wasn’t moving any longer.
“Has to stay here, yes,” Tony said. He sighed. “I mean, the good thing is that our Steve brought his own shield with him, right? So you’ll still have that one.”
“Rogers, Steven Grant,” it echoed across the room. “Born 1918.” The camera next to the monitor scanned the surroundings, landing on Natasha next. “Romanov, Natalia Alianovna. Born 1984.”
Steve shook his head and frowned. “I… we don’t need to stop there. I just… I’ve never seen it before and I had always planned to go there sometimes. That doesn’t have to be now, it’s fine.”
Slowly, almost against his own will, his feet carried him back, and once he stood on top of the stairs, he couldn’t help but glance down.
“Yes, all of us,” Steve confirmed. “They do get along well. And they make a great team. I mean … we do. Or will do. Hopefully.”
It was—it was basically an arm on wheels, Steve thought, but with the way it bumped into Tony as if wanting to hug him, Steve knew it was so much more. Its movements were sluggish, uncoordinated and loud—very
Steve hummed noncommittally, firmly fighting down the heat rising to his cheeks. “Are you still in the meeting?”
Steve drew a shaky breath. “I’m Steve,” he said. “Just not… your Steve, I think. Half an hour ago I fought Thanos in Manhattan. I only just turned up here, but I’m… I’m Steve Rogers, I promise.”
He leaned back to look into Steve’s eyes, framing his face with both hands. Unbidden, a smile rose to his face, probably way too giddy and way too much in love, because Steve was right there with him and that was probably the greatest thing that had ever happened to Tony. “But I, uh, guess we have to up our communication skills, discuss things openly, and all that.”
He leaned back, looking at Steve squarely when he glanced up. “You know I’m just teasing you, right?” he asked, even more quiet, although he wasn’t deluding himself. If Romanov wanted to know what he was saying, she would.
Barnes raised his hand to nudge the shoulder where the metal arm was sewn into his body, his eyebrows knit in confusion. “I’m still expecting to wake up,” he said after a long moment, not quite meeting Tony’s eyes. “Sometimes I’m just drifting off and I’m back in the basement where they kept me…”
He sat in the bar for a whole long while that night. Bucky’s death kept him shell-shocked, and he lay awake long. Only by the time the moonlit sky faded into morning, Steve’s heavy eyes conceded the battle to fatigue, and he fell into a troubled sleep.
“Getting close to 11:15,” Steve replied, shaking his head as if to clear it. “We… I guess I was sleepier than I… thought. And the others… well, I guess we were all tired.”
The fact that he didn’t answer any of Tony’s encrypted messages was simply because he was busy getting his stubborn ass out of danger.
Tony wiped his mouth with his fingers, before licking his thumb clean. His cheeks were beautifully flushed and his eyes blown wide with—
Shivers spread across Tony’s skin. He paused, glanced to Steve’s face again, then raised his knees a little and repositioned his rear to give Steve better access.
Before he could fully grasp what she was doing—what he was doing—he found himself back in her arms. She was cradling her body against his, and her head was on his shoulder. She was crying, he realized after a moment, and it was the first time he had seen her do that. He could tell by the tension in her body that it made her uneasy. The openness—the way her arms trembled around him. When he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend he could keep her.
Tony nodded, then leaned down and kissed Steve, his arms curled around his shoulders. As they kissed, Tony started to move above him, gently rolling his hips back and forth. He slipped a hand between their heaving bellies and combed through Steve’s pubic hair, lightly tugging on his cock.
His hands wandered into his hair, roughing up the already messy black locks. “I can’t believe myself. I haven’t thought about you in years, and now you’re haunting my every night. Why didn’t I see this, you look
“Pretty nice set up,” Steve said as they made their way through the hallway. The entrance hall was gigantic, with four huge chandelier and a live orchestra playing Sinatra in the background. Tony instantly felt the stares of all those gathered in the giant ballroom. All eyes were on them and it only had him grip Steve’s hand a little tighter.
Steve burst out laughing and with that, curiosity got the better of Bucky. He opened the door slightly to take a look. Steve and Tony were standing in the middle of the room, with Steve taking Tony by the shoulders while the smaller man looked, as he’d said himself, to be a second from freaking out. His forehead was sweaty, his shirt stained with various substances. He looked thinner than Bucky remembered, his lips pale, dark streaks under his eyes as though he hadn’t been sleeping. Behind the two, a large turkey sat on the kitchen counter, circled by dozens of half-filled bowls and pans and plates.
Tony took a fortifying deep breath, willing the next words out of his mouth, “You need to look at the plans of the Helicarrier again? I’m sure they’ll send Barnes right to Commando Bridge.”
His train of thought derailed when Tony came into the living room. Thankfully, he was wearing a fresh pair of jeans and a new shirt. He dropped down on the couch right next to Steve in a way that had him lying with his head in Steve’s lap. He smiled, a real genuine smile, not the carefully guarded one Steve usually saw on his face. There was even a long dimple slashing down his cheek, his eyes lighting up. Brown eyes, vivid and adoring.
Agent Romanoff considered him, and whatever she found in his expression seemed to convince her. “It was a boat,” she said. “We sent a diver down to inspect the bottom of the ship. See if we could keep it afloat. He came across the hull of another boat… a little sailboat.”
“And where exactly is it that you can’t sleep?” Tony asked and cringed a little. He hadn’t meant to outright ask, but this was unknown territory, something he wasn’t used to, and all witty tactics had flown out of the window the second he’d heard Steve speak again.
“When I get there. Sometime around noon, I don’t know. Ross will just have to wait for me.” Tony’s head found its way to the crook of Steve’s neck and he settled further into his arms. “I’m so tired of this. Feels like I’ve been sitting in courtrooms for a year straight…”
“Well, we’ve got to go,” Nat exclaimed, then stepped up to Tony. To Steve’s wonder, she caught his face in her hands and pecked him on the corner of his mouth, being careful to curve her body so that she didn’t touch him anywhere else where the slime might have landed.
So he listened as Jarvis recited the day’s activities and together, they walked down the many corridors, chatting amiably. Throughout the last days, he felt he’d really grown close to Jarvis, not just because he talked to Steve as though he was genuinely interested in what he had to say, but also because he obviously cared a lot for his master. Walking by his side, the mansion suddenly seemed a lot less intimidating.
“You know…” Clint started, clearing his throat. “I lied to Laura a lot, in the beginning. Figured she didn’t need to know all the nasty details of the job. Made her hella angry. Took us a long time to figure out how to be honest with each other.”
He had that calming way about him—how he’d ask Steve a few little questions here and there, like where they were right now, if it was cold outside, how his team was doing. He still wasn’t sharing much information about himself, at least not any specifics, but Steve figured Tony simply needed a bit more time to fully trust him. In any case, Tony’s presence helped calm Steve’s mind a lot, and whenever he woke up, he did it with a bit of newfound strength to face yet another day.
involve breaking into a castle and thus breaking about twenty international laws. It was about the last thing they needed right now. After they’d defeated Thanos, they had regained some of the respect they’d lost during the Sokovia fiasco. And yet—one wrong move and they’d be back to square one. And really, Tony couldn’t go through that again.
For the first time, Bucky realized how close Nat and Steve seemed to be. He hadn’t paid much attention to their interactions before, but it was very clear now. She wasn’t even paying his movements any attention, simply leaning against his side and trusting him to fix those wounds properly. They were comfortable around each other, and he found himself craving that casual closeness.
Tony frowned in that ‘I see you want something from me but I have no idea what it is’ kind of way he often did, and said, “You alright there, buddy?“
He heard her let out a short breath, whether in acknowledgment or exasperation he couldn’t tell. “Hang on,” she finally answered.
Steve stared at him blankly, then he seemed to realize what Tony was talking about and cast him a soft smile. “Technically, I didn’t fall.”
“We’re all night owls, Stark,” Bucky replied good-naturedly, raising his voice for the first time. “
“No,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. Some part of him wished that he could re-lose his virginity to Steve. That Steve could be his first everything. That they could be each other’s, how it was meant to be. But then again, it didn’t really matter. Everything else had just brought them here, to this moment, so it was okay. “You’re with me now, right?”
“Of course.” Tony chuckled as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. “They know you belong to me now. That makes you one of the most important persons in the whole mansion.”
Bucky hummed and leaned forward. “Yeah… looked like it. You know, from where Stark’s tongue were busy licking your whole face.”
He gathered his bearings, and looking up at Steve, he even managed a smile that hopefully looked suggestive and not seasick.
Tony had never tried to kiss him, never even wanted to hold his hand. And Steve tried to think of it very little. Of Tony’s words when he’d made his proposal. That they’d be lovers, that he wanted Steve in every way he would want a husband.
strong. Stronger than any man he’d ever faced. Heck, Steve was halfway convinced he could take it on with a whole dozen of enemies right now, and still come out alive on the other side. His muscles vibrated with power, his heart was going a mile per minute, and he felt the urge to run, to move, to
Tony sighed. “It doesn’t make you anything. It wasn’t you. It was a skewed vision, and its whole purpose was to mess with you.”
“Not so bad for an old man,” Tony teased, his thumbs skimming the waistline of the pajama pants, dipping inside a little, brushing through the coarse hair underneath.
, Tony had never imagined it could be like this. He knew it would be amazing. How could it not be amazing? But this, right here and now, was truly mind-blowing. It was light and dark and violence and heat. And Steve was glorious like this, in complete control over him—and they were truly glorious together.
“Just get inside me,” Steve said, grunting irritably when Tony moved his fingers languidly from side to side to spread him wider. “I can take it.”
Steve took a deep breath, and with a voice that was far calmer than he felt, he said, “We talked about this, Tony. Never this.
curious about the infamous workshop. After they’d talked about it, Tony had never mentioned it again… but maybe, once he’d set foot in there again, he’d find a few of the parts he’d lost of himself after Indries’ death.
"Yeah," Steve said, letting himself finally relax fully. He still felt terrible about assaulting Tony, but then, he wasn't used to being woken up in the middle of the action. Usually he woke himself up, much closer to the early morning, although a glance to the watch next to the bed indicated it wasn't really the middle of the night anymore.
Steve was instantly drunk on sensation, the taste of Tony, the feel of him, the long slides of that sinful, experienced tongue against his own.
He could almost envision Indries simply standing behind the next corner, waiting for him with a confident smile and a perfectly elegant dress.
“Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell,” Zemo answered gravely. “No. I’m here because I made a promise.”
“Mr. Rogers,” he said warmly. “I’m Edwin Jarvis, head of the household. It’s a real pleasure to meet you. For all of us.”
“I hate that mask,” Tony whispered, even as his tablet on the table far away from them started beeping. “It’s weird not to see you.”
, he really felt like a sixteen year old teenager again, making those stuttered declarations. “And I want to get serious, too. With you. I don’t regret a single second. God knows how we got here from not even talking to each other for weeks, but I’m so glad we did. I admit I was sort of an asshole to you most of the time, but it’s just the way I react to people who constantly shove me out of my comfort-zone and you really took the cake in that department, and I…” He forced himself to take a breath and not get carried away too far.
Clint and Thor were munching on a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup, Natasha was rigidly staring out of the window, and Bruce—now wearing one of Sam’s pants and a shirt—was inspecting the gunshot wound beneath Tony’s left armpit while he was waiting for his cup of tea to steep. The graze was healing over quickly and with no signs of inflammation. It wasn’t that deep really, and they all knew that Extremis would fix it in no time, but both Bruce and Steve had insisted that it’d be cleaned to keep it from getting infected.
he was kind of acting the part. That was, apparently, what being near Steve did to him. Having him lose all last strands of control.
“We did,” Tony agreed and smiled. He didn’t know why, didn’t understand the mechanics of it, but in the long run, Tony figured it didn’t matter. His eyes searched Steve’s as if seeking something he couldn’t name—a hidden catch in his words, maybe. There was none. He had fallen in love with Steve all those centuries ago, and he’d fallen in love with him now. The visions had just linked those lives together.
Tony huffed. “Are we back to being passive-aggressive? I thought we had a talk-beats-bullshit rule.”
“Please… ‘m close,” Tony whined, eventually overcome with the need for release. He shoved both feet against Steve’s ass, his knees drawn up as far as they would go, pressing Steve harder against him on each thrust. He gave his own movements more momentum, slapping his hips against each downward stroke, and groaning whenever Steve hit his sweet spot.
They were back, Steve realized. He stumbled a little, before sitting down on the floor. Tony did the same a few feet away from him, and when he caught his gaze—a carefully shielded, composed gaze—Steve knew that everything was going to change now.
"Doesn't look like a failure from where I'm standing," Steve admitted, still watching the arm pull back and turn towards him. "This is… really amazing," he said, smiling at Tony. "It's hearing us, isn't it?"
“It was my fault,” Steve mumbled without even looking up. “I convinced him to come up here. Wanted too much too soon.”
The overall arrival in the galley was anticlimactic, but he had to admit, Batroc was a bit of a surprise. He came out of nowhere, flinging his whole weight against the shield and instantly knocking Steve off his feet. He blocked his first blows, then delivered a punch to his gut and a hopping front snap kick to his jaw. Steve stepped back, amused.
“If ever we came to a point where saving the world was no longer imperative, it would be because we had failed.” Steve smiled wanly. “We’re very good at what we do.”
He never should’ve agreed to sign it while Steve still had his doubts. He should’ve talked to him sooner, should’ve made a compromise before Ross gave them a deadline.
“Because I don’t get it. Why you haven’t laughed in my face at some point, telling everyone that I like to suck dick, I—I just don’t get.” He shook his head, ignoring Steve’s grimace at his choice of words. “You’re not like other people. You don’t get upset with me. You get annoyed. You get frustrated. You get pissed. But you never… drop me. Not even after I… well, did that thing. And I… I would’ve deserved you being angry. I deserved for you to drop me.”
As the sun wandered across the sky, it gradually went behind a thin veil of clouds, letting them see the crescent with almost naked eyes. The sun was almost half eclipsed by now. It was like looking at the moon only a few times bigger and many times brighter.
“What choice do we have?” Wanda asked, looking shell-shocked even as she tightened the guard railing’s hold further and further. Ultron was trashing, his eyes black once more, but from one moment to the other, it seemed as though an electroshock had burst through his innards. Ultron slumped against his prison, a strained sound reaching the air.
Tony rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything. Because a truthful answer would’ve been that… that the prospect sounded less scary by the second.
Bucky tried to whirl around, break out of Steve’s grasp around his body, when a muffled moan from the bed caught his attention. Natasha was shaking in her sleep, her limbs twitching and one hand clutching at her arm, and—oh God. There were raising welts on her exposed skin, and in some spots dribbles of blood.
“So even if this is real…” Steve started weakly, the gears in his mind twisting and turning with realization.
,” Steve said vehemently. “I agreed, remember? We get information, talk about it some more, then we’ll see where it goes.”
In the background, the crowds broke out in frantic cheering as Steve made yet another touchdown. Next to him a couple of girls were offering to have Steve’s many beautiful babies.
It took something close to an eternity, but eventually, Steve released a soft breath. “Just promise me one thing.”
Steve still had a hold on Tony’s hand, his other arm wrapped around his waist, and even though Steve could obviously barely contain his amusement, Tony found himself slumping against him fully.
Tony chuckled. "Like I said, no biggie. And you can call me whenever you want to, y'know? For whatever."
One of the worst things he did was to ask Pepper for help, if he was honest. At first Pepper had seemed to be repulsed by his method of approach, albeit he would agree that it was rather foul play. But along the week, Pepper had taken over getting him to dress up for Saturday, just as Tony's initial request. He cursed the moment he made it.
He suddenly stopped his stride towards his car and couldn't blink. Pepper unknowingly kept walking. Upon reaching the car, she noticed Tony's absence beside her. She turned around to see the man, standing like a damn statue in the middle of the sidewalk.
Pepper was an amazing PA. The best. Tony was willing to bet his entire company on the fact. He's pretty sure she was his mother in the previous life, getting him up for school and pestering him about homework and dishes. He didn't know where he would be if not for her. Remembering his indescribably messy twenties, no one stuck around the way she did. And he was really, really thankful. He wasn't the best at showing his feelings, but he was glad Pepper could see right through him, and knew exactly how he felt, should his words help her understand or not. She always knew. Above all, she was a terrific friend.
"And I know this might scare you off, I don't want it to, and I hope it doesn't, but I am..." Steve sighed deeply, steadying himself and his voice that had begin to quiver. His solid gaze never wavering from Tony's, not even for a moment. "I might love you."
He picked Peter up and brought him to the kitchen, the bottle from his bag in his hand. He got the milk from the fridge and somehow managed to open the bottle and pour milk in it while Peter had slumped his head on top of his shoulder, seeming completely out of power of his own. He closed the bottle and put it the microwave.
Tony pulled a fraction backwards to look into Steve's eyes. "What a perfect way to end the night." He whispered, rubbing his thumb over Steve's cheekbone.
"I'm regretting that now." Tony murmured, closing the door behind him. He turned on the shower, getting the water to be just the right temperature. He scrubbed his hair with a little more determination than normal, he couldn't shake Pepper's earlier comment about it and in no way was he meeting up with a man like Steve with anything about him looking anything less than classy.
Steve was going to break up with him. He was sure. Oh god, Steve had been so good for him. He had made him such a better person, even in the limited time they had spent together. Steve had made him want to be a better man, the best man. Steve was good for him. The very thought of losing him frightened him to death.
"Of course. Does he know what today is?" Steve sadly shook his head. "It's okay. He's three. On his own time." Steve didn't look like he agreed but he nodded anyway. "You need someone to be with you when you go to the cemetery?"
He looked at Peter who was sleeping with lips parted, turned on his side, hands clutching the sheets. Then he looked at Steve, who was exactly the same. Lips parted, body turned to his side, both facing Tony. Peter's brunette hair and brown eyes would misguide people but his actions and small habits and expressions were so akin with Steve's, to a point it was scary. But Tony found himself loving it.
But he didn't say it. Not yet. Insecurity was a very close and old friend of his. Always tugging at his sleeve, always a step ahead of his guts, always looming at every corner of his brain. He could not risk what he had with Steve by saying that word.
"It's just... I'm nothing special." Steve's voice was shy and hesitant. He also kept it low so Peter won't hear. "I'm a single father who doesn't have much to offer."
"I would suggest closing the file if you're done, sir, but I would be happy to place an order for a shrine to be made as well."
Tony walked him to the elevator, not before telling Peter where he was going and ordering JARVIS to tell him immediately if Peter needed anything or seemed the least bit of distressed.
Steve rolled his eyes, went closer to Tony and kissed his lips. He then kissed Peter's head. "You like it, honey?"
Tony had taken Steve on multiple dates since the first. And it is fair to say that Steve had enjoyed every single one of them, which meant Tony was really proud to have pulled it off and incredibly pleased with Steve's worthwhile reactions.
Tony shook himself and got into action. He decided to take a stroll and if he didn't find Steve and Peter, he'll just go back. At least then he'll be able to say that he did go, he just wasn't able to find them and had no means of contact without his conscience beating him down. Perfect. Absolutely perfect.
And it did. Once out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, he went into his closet. Sure enough, a nice suit awaited him, pressed and hanging. He was big enough to admit that pinstripes looked good on him.
"That's good, huh?" Tony said and sat next to Steve on the two-seater recliners. "JARVIS, get the pop corn ready. So which one will it be, bud? JARVIS, show the kid movies to pick from." A list of movies came on the screen. "Pick away, kid."
Tony did not know what to do. They didn't have each others number so Tony could call the whole thing off. He could get the number, like he did the name, but he had sworn off that tactic.
"That's right! It's a fancy boat. You intelligent little boy!" Tony praised, knowing very well that he himself had taught him that.
The car ride to the park was really quiet. Tony didn't wish for the radio or music to be playing. He was tapping his fingers on his knees, making a point by not biting his bottom lip. He hadn't been this nervous about anything in so long that this was now a new feeling for him.
Steve looked up at Tony who was now sitting beside him. "Hey." Steve leaned in to kiss his boyfriend on the lips. "He wasn't much trouble, was he?"
"You know you're just spoiling me with all these kisses, right?" Tony said, getting his plate layered with bacon. Not the eggs. Steve noticed. Which then led to Steve putting some there himself, much to Tony's silent disapproval. "Before you know it I'm gonna be asking for kisses at the most inappropriate times and won't shut up my whining till you give them."
The next time Tony woke up, he had a tiny leg over his chest. It took a moment for him to register the reason behind it. He cracked his eyes open, still squinting, thank JARVIS who had made sure to dim the intensity of the sunlight seeping inside. He made sure to make his movements be as subtle as possible, not to wake up the toddler. When he turned his face to his other side, he faced by an already awake Steve, smiling softly.
"And you should know." Steve whispered. "There's nothing I want from you other than you." He shifted closer to Tony, bringing their faces near. "Not your money, not your name. Just you."
Tony bend down to pick Peter up in his arms and the toddler wrapped his arms around Tony's neck and hid his face in the hollow. "Now, come on. Don't be like that, Petey. Dum-E is really friendly. He won't do anything to hurt you." Tony said, rubbing Peter's back. "I'm not gonna leave you alone with him, y'know? I thought you would like him. Your daddy thought so too."
"Fuck the movie. Lets go to the bed." Steve laughed and got up and on the floor. Tony stood on the sofa, bringing their lips together again. Steve hummed and grabbed Tony under his thighs as the other man jumped and wrapped his legs around Steve's waist. Steve only managed a slight stumble before walking his way to Tony's bedroom. He did bump into the wall beside the door while entering, hitting Tony's back, making him groan.
, those eyes. They could hold the ocean in them. Those pulp lips, pink and full. So, so kissable. Always kissable for Tony.
And another thing. To the public, Tony Stark was a billionaire. He was a playboy. He was heartless. He was worthless. People would imagine him to be just like his previous self. To hell with whatever Tony had done to better himself, those acts didn't matter, they didn't hold much weight. And one of Tony's countless flaws (ask him and he'll tell you they're countless) was his massive insecurity. It was colossal.
"Yes, it is matching. Good eye, Peter." Tony encouraged. To which Peter gave a cute little giggle and looked at his dad.
"Look, Pepper, I know what I did was wrong and I shut it down as soon as I opened and I feel guilty about it. I really do. Believe me."
And he would've easily continued to stay stationary between the silk sheets had it not been for the human embodiment of one of mother nature's offspring knocking at his bedroom door, demanding an answer. He groaned, scrunching his face. Pepper would break down the entire wall if it meant she would get Tony off the bed and ready for the day, no questions asked.
"I'm not." Whoever claimed that Tony was suave was probably pulling their hair out because Tony shook his head so heartily that Steve had to suppress a grin.
"It's not fucked up." Tony gave him a confused look. "Your brain. It's not fucked." Tony blinked at him, words lost to him. He felt like he had never learned how to talk, ever. "It's actually really beautiful."
When the batter was mixed, Steve looked at the time. "I gotta wake Peter. Can you turn the stove on low and heat up the pan?"
"Yes!" Tony brought Peter to the couch and put him on it, immediately tickling the little kid. Peter, like his father, was sometimes very stubborn and just would not give up. But Peter, also like his father, had a huge weakness. And that happened to be him being ticklish.
Tony ruffled his hair, chuckling softly. "Of course, you do. I know you do. But you better keep it up."
"That's right! Aren't you the smartest one!" Tony nudged Peter's cheek with this knuckle, who seemed really happy with himself and picked up the slice to take a bite.
Him and Steve had gotten closer since that first dinner date. They met a few more times, sometimes Peter would join them. Steve had expressed his relief concerning Peter's transparent and undemanding amiability towards Tony.
Tony discovered that Steve had moved after his mother had passed away nine years ago. About how Bucky was one of his only support in life. About how Steve and Bucky had been inseparable since childhood. He found it hard to believe when Steve had said he was a bony, little weakling when he was younger and how he would always be on the other side of the punch in every fight he'd ever been in. Which was a lot.
Now here he was, lying on bed, thinking about his date, about the man who had so easily spellbound him without even knowing or trying. Steve's obliviousness to his beauty was quite charming. But, as amusing as it was to watch the man walk around without knowing, he was willing to go on a mission to make Steve believe through and through of what he possessed. Or at least of what Tony thought of him. And that was only if Steve gave him a chance.
He couldn't stop himself from thinking of all the what if's. What if Steve had later thought about it and was choosing not to come? What if Steve was faking the smiles and sweetness just to humor Tony but was secretly laughing behind his back? What if Steve realized that Tony wasn't worth the effort? What if Steve didn't want to put Peter under such an influence? Tony wouldn't object to the last. He would rather encourage it.
"We have a line of people wanting to make money, Peps. Screw this guy and call the next one on the top of the list and arrange a meeting for after I come back. And didn't I tell you to take a few days off? Disobeying your boss's orders is not held cherishable in anyone's eyes."
"I suppose." Steve said, trying to not show his displeasure at the thought of the cost he was expecting. "We'll see."
After a while, they abandoned the pool and dried themselves off with the towels, wrapping them around their waists. They went inside and Steve picked up Peter's sleeping body up as Tony guided his to their bedroom.
"Ferociously. Vigorously." That got Steve to laugh. Tony smiled at the man, pulling back just enough to be able to see his whole face. He moved his hand to brush the fingers through the blond hair. "Passionately." He whispered. "I love you. I know some might consider it being too early for that but I do. Very much."
"Can we get ice cream now? Please?" Eager little kid. Tony didn't mind. In fact, it reminded him of himself when he was young.
Tony brought him in for a kiss. He kissed his cheek, nose, eye lids and the lips again. "You are a gorgeous man. The most irresistible. The most stunning. The most beautiful man I have ever laid eyes on."
"You didn't tell me you were coming." Steve sniffed. His voice was rough and deep, his nose and cheeks red, his eyes swollen and his hair a mess. Oh god.
Steve glared at Peter all the while Tony just smirked. "Or are you just trying to hurt my feelings here?"
He pulled out his phone as he made for a different exit than where Steve was headed. He typed in for JARVIS to remind him next Saturday about this and to keep his schedule clear.
"Steve, sweetheart, breathe." Tony interjected Steve's nervous rant, making the other stop. "You know, I know your kid is your first priority, right?" When Steve didn't say anything, Tony continued. "Well you should know that. Okay? Peter comes first, it's a given fact. I was thinking about Saturday, around seven. But if that doesn't suit you, we can reschedule. It's no biggie."
Steve was quiet for a couple of seconds. "Um, I was wondering... well, I wanted to confirm actually. About the date. Um... I have to make sure that Peter's uncle is free to, y'know, look after him. And so it wouldn't mess with your planning. 'Cause, like, I don't really have a, y'know, a sitter and it'll be a problem for me and-"
Before Steve could interject, Tony continued. "I got your work to give you the well earned weekend break, without pay cuts. We have everything we will need in the trunk. Petey here helped me pack, didn't you?" Peter proudly nodded, making Steve ease out a small smile. "And if we need anything else, or if you feel like we forgot something of yours, we'll call Happy and he'll get it here. No problem, whatsoever. So... This was the surprise. So..." Tony indicated that he was finished and was awaiting Steve's response.
"...I brought another one?" Tony said, more like testing his statement to be enough to be believed or not.
"Thank you." He said, before taking a sip of his drink and putting it back in the cup holder because of course there was cup holder.
Peter jutted his jaw up, in a total Rogers way, and said, "I am your number one buddy." It wasn't a question, he stated it. Tony did not get a say in this as far as Peter was concerned. And Tony wasn't going to argue with the kid.
When he came out, Steve wasn't in the room. Peter was still sleeping, the sheets tucking him in. He walked out the room, keeping the door open. He heard some noise from the kitchen and went there. Sure enough, there Steve was measuring the flour.
Tony was glad he planned this. When he saw that huge smile spread over Steve's face, he knew he did something right by the man. He just knew he wanted to make this man as happy as he could so he could forget about his problems. And just be happy. Content.
"It comes with the name. It's not your fault." Tony raised their joined hands and pressed a kind, tender kiss on Steve's knuckles, never leaving eye contact. He saw Steve take in a deep breath, his eyes soft, looking into Tony's. He felt like time had stopped for them.
Steve, on the other hand, hadn't been as appreciative of the gesture. He had smiled for the boy, ruffled his hair, told him he can play with it when he's home and Peter, being the most rule-abiding three year old in town, had agreed. Though there was a tiny frown on his face which was soon enough removed when he went to the sand box.
"Yes, boss." He could hear the amusement in her voice, along with affection. Pepper was an amazing PA. Really.
Tony's phone started to ring and he groaned. When he made no move to leave the pool, Steve told him to do so. Grumbling, he went out of the pool and grabbed his phone. Looking at the caller, he mumbled, "I told her to take time off." He turned to the boys in the pool. "I'll be right back."
"Yeah, but... I thought- I thought... y'know... it's good to see you." Steve as a stuttering mess and a tint of blush spreading over his cheeks was a sight for sore eyes.
Tony licked his lips slowly, swallowing to prepare himself to speak. He blinked, his eyes stinging a tad bit. He sighed deeply. "Do you know what you mean to me?"
"It is." Steve nodded, holding Tony's wrists while his hands still held his face. "It's mesmerising to watch it work. Never seen anything as brilliant."
"Yeah." Tony whispered. "We're away enough from the city. No light pollution here. Just the clear, beautiful night sky." When Steve didn't say anything, Tony continued. "Wanna stargaze?"
Both Tony and Peter had the same expression of glee on their face as Tony led them in. Tony waved at the girl on the counter who greeted them. "Hey, Cindy. How're you doing?"
Though Peter, being a toddler and sleepy, being a very sleepy toddler, didn't manage to grasp much of what Tony was saying and fell asleep less than half way through the demanded story. But Tony didn't stop there. He continued the story telling till he reached the end of how he was thrown out of the place, his friend following him while laughing his ass off.
"Tony, I swear to god, you better be getting ready!" She knocked the door some more. Tony decided that him and his bed just weren't meant to be. Or maybe it was just the timing of life, yeah, something like that.
They lounged on the same chairs Peter had slept on not long ago, Steve made sure to keep the baby monitor near. After their snack, they just lazed there, not wanting to do anything.
Tony made sure to have asked for Steve's number when asking for a second date. Steve seemed eager enough to accept, that built up Tony's confidence in the matter even more firmly. If Steve really wanted this like it seemed so, then everything in the world was just spectacular. Tony had decided to not have any seconds thoughts this next time around.
"Yes. Please." His voice had sounded uneven. But thankfully, he needn't speak the rest of the ride home.
"I...uh, I think we should be heading back." Steve said picking Peter off the ground and into his arms. Tony saw the muscles there flex. Those were some massive arms. Tony had to resist the temptation of running his fingers across the skin. It looked so soft.
Steve still wasn't sure who JARVIS was but he didn't reject the offer. He stayed quiet for a while and so did Tony. He gave him time, Tony didn't mind.
He brought the cups to the table. He sat while Steve got the eggs from god knows where, they weren't there before the coffee. Steve sat beside Tony, not before kissing his head.
They pulled apart, laboriously panting. Steve looked at Tony's eyes. "You wanna finish the movie or...?"
"He's a boy?" Tony raised his brow at the question but decided to nod, not wanting to give anything away. "We can be friends?"
Peter laughed loudly at the compliments he was receiving and threw the ball away, as far away as he could, which was only a few feet away from where they were standing. He then proceeded by running after it and grabbing the ball before running back to his dad, giggling excitedly.
"It's nothing." Smart guy that he was, Steve saw right through his bullshit. Tony squeezed his hand. "I mean it, honey. It's nothing. Everything's fine."
"Why not?" When Steve hadn't answer, Tony continued. "I mean unless you were okay with him staying with a babysitter. I mean, he's you're kid. I'm not gonna tell you how to do it but like... If you want him there with us, I'd not mind. I'd not mind if he wasn't either. I mean as long as he's safe of course-"
Saturday seemed to work out well for Steve that now Tony was sat in front of him in a restaurant, after questions after questions determined to find the best cuisine to Steve's liking.
"Uh, yeah. He probably would, if we remind him of it. But he's curious about anything and everything so..."
Surprisingly, and also not so, a blush crept on Steve's face. "I've actually... Not... Since Peter..."
They made their way to the kitchen and Tony opened up the fridge. Steve looked in and whistled. "That thing's loaded."
I really enjoyed getting back to writing and then choosing these guys to write about. They were really fun to play around with.
They played around the pool some more until Peter started to grow tired and Steve decided it was time for the boy's nap. He got Peter out of the pool and dried him off, having him change into some clothes. "I don't wanna sleep alone."
Steve, albeit with a little hesitation, climbed onto the bed, perching the pillows at the head of the bed. Tony went to his side of the bed, settling in comfortably. He could feel the tension in Steve's body, could practically feel it knocking him out of the bed.
When they pulled apart, Steve still grabbing Tony face from the sides, resting their foreheads together, both of them breathing heavily.
Tony nodded. "Have you eaten today?" Steve met Tony's eyes and looked away. Tony sighed. "That just won't do. We're ordering Chinese."
He collected his phone and wallet and exited the room, ignoring Pepper in the living room and headed straight for the elevator.
"Okay." Steve had said. Very sweetly. That was the thing about Steve. He was very sweet, incredibly so. His face wasn't where his beauty ended. It seeped deep into him, through his soul.
When Steve came back, he had a little frown on his face while rubbing his forehead. Tony saw him coming in and saw the state he was in across the room. He questioned with a hand gesture and Steve hesitated before gesturing him over. Tony glanced at Peter, who was lost to the world, so engrossed in the explosions in the movie to even notice Tony slipping away.
Tony understood just fine and he coaxed Steve into it. "C'mon. I gave you my word. It's no a problem for me. Tell him, Peter."
It's not like Tony didn't want to go, he was an orphan kid once too. Not as young as the kids at the house but still an orphan kid.
"I can't say I'm sorry." The smug smile of Steve's face made Tony kiss him once more. When they pulled apart, Steve asked, "You were going somewhere, I believe?"
Tony snorted lightly. "You think that's gonna stop me." He made exaggerated kissy faces and got closer to Steve.
Steve moved smoothly from the stove to the side to grab the plate and gave Tony the view of the pan that had the delicious smelling bacon sizzling on it. Steve picked the pieces up and put them on the plate and lowered the flame intensity of the other stove that had a waiting pan on top of it. Since when did Tony have so many pans, he would never know.
Steve face grew soft, smile leaving his face though. "That was really cheesy of you," and he swallowed. "I love you. A lot."
"I don't know what you're talking about." Steve snorted at that. "Let's go to the kitchen, I'm hungry."
"How often does this happen exactly?" Tony followed Steve to where Peter was still watching the movie.
Steve was sat back on the sofa, clearly really pleased with the view. He had a smile on his face that was radiating with affection.
Peter nodded like before and Tony opened the book to the first page. Peter rolled to be snuggled into Tony and who was he to say anything against that. Tony made sure to secure the other end and the foot of the bed with pillows, to guard Peter from rolling over while sleeping, before he pulled him into his arms and started reading slowly and in a very hushed voice.
"There are a million things I don't need to see but this isn't one of them. Do I like seeing you like this? It's breaking me. Do I not want to be here? Absolutely wrong. I'm your boyfriend, I love you. And I'm not gonna leave until you're alright."
Tony then proceeded by kissing Steve's neck as the other man walked as quickly as he could without bumping Tony into anything or tripping. Once they reached their room, Tony pushed the door close with his hand, never moving his lips away from Steve's skin.
"You staying the night?" Tony asked during the movie, take away boxes littering the coffee table in front of them, Peter sitting between them.
Steve looked at him then like Tony held the universe in his hands. Like he had every answer to every one of his queries. Like he could protect Steve from everything. Tony's heart burst a thousand times in that one moment. But, damn all, he will do anything Steve wants him to do.
"What do you need?" Tony rubbed his hands, walking towards Steve. Steve laughed and told Tony to get out the eggs.
"So I was thinking," Tony spoke up, both watching Peter grab the ball. "That after the park, maybe we could go somewhere. Like get ice cream or something. If it doesn't mess up your schedule or anything. I know little kids and their schedules and how important it is to stick to it. I wouldn't want to mess with that. I was just hoping that maybe you'd wanna go. It doesn't even have to be ice cream, it could be anything-"
Steve nodded. "Just you." He joined their lips together and kissed the other man, deeply, as if trying to show what he felt right through the kiss.
Peter waved his hand at Dum-E. "Bye, Dum-E." The bot rolled his claw at the kid and Tony patted his surface.
. He hoped to god there wasn't going to be any pain but he also found himself agreeing with the voice. This beautiful, beautiful man was worth it all and more. Much, much more.
you are tired so we don't have to go out tonight. We'll order in. Sound good?" Steve struggled to do so but nodded eventually. Tony turned to Peter. "You hungry?"
Steve came from around the corner, his phone now in his hand. "It was Bucky. Calling to update on Peter."
"Tony." Steve interrupted, making Tony stop mid sentence, mouth open like fish. "Sure. Ice cream sounds great. We love ice cream."
Yet here he was. A child so comfortably relying on him, resting peacefully on him. And he did not mind it one bit. He looked down at Peter, who had his eyes closed, and gently kissed his forehead. The microwave started beeping and he pressed to the button to take out the bottle.
Tony took the biggest sigh he had ever taken. Bigger than that time when he handed in the project blueprint to his dad when he was seventeen exactly two minutes before the old man had declared his deadline. And things were never fine when father dear wasn't given what he wanted, specially for Tony.
Peter looked at his dad, who just shook his head at Tony. "No one's getting a hundred scoops. You can't eat that much, you'll get sick. Do you wanna get sick?"
When Steve nodded, he went inside to receive Pepper's call. She had something to say about an investor wanting to pull out of a project and thought Tony should know before it's too late. Tony, already not liking being pulled away from Steve and Peter, just cursed at the investor and told Pepper to do the same.
Every other sound seemed to be blocked from Tony's ears. His eyes went out of focus. He was pretty sure his brain exploded too. Like that one scene from the animated movie Peter loved to watched about the birds. Storks, was it? Anyway, when he blinked and found Steve still sitting there, he guessed his previous assumption was wrong.
After Peter was tucked in for bed, Tony had wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and kissed the man furiously. Steve kissed back with just as much passion, pushing Tony's back onto the wall of the corridor.
"Hey, sleepy pie, your milk's ready. You want it, don't you?" His voice ever so tender. The boy nodded his head lazily and Tony tested the warmth of the milk on his wrist, as he'd seen Steve do numerous times. When he was sure the milk wouldn't burn the kid, he guided the tip of the bottle to Peter's mouth, who instinctively took it and started drinking.
Steve patted his pocket where his wallet was instinctively when Tony spoke up. "Well, Peter, we were just deciding if you'd be up for some ice cream."
"C'mon, now, I don't wanna hear it. Time for some shut eye for you too." Tony laid Peter on the bed and covered him with the sheet, tucking him in. Then turned to the father. "I could sleep on the couch if you're uncomfortable in the same bed, I don't mind-"
Steve looked at his boys again, a smile finally breaking onto his face, full toothy and all. "You guys are something else."
"I'm sorry about that, Steve. I wanted to treat you. And I know how you feel, believe me, I hate pity. But this isn't that. I really wanted to do this for you."
"We're at Tony's mason! For the get stay!" Peter exclaimed, excitedly, not knowing he made no sense at all. Steve looked at Tony, questioning.
He ran his fingers through Steve's hair, settling them down a bit. "Were you planning on spending the whole day like that?"
"Is that so?" The elevator door opened and Tony pulled the kid out of it into his lab. He had already made sure to hide or keep out of a three year old's reach anything and everything dangerous.
He looked at Peter's carefree and beaming face and would sit back content. This child, this beautiful child, was getting a childhood. And he was helping in it some way. Eating what he was given, playing with what toys he had, the toddler never seemed to thrown a tantrum. It wouldn't be wrong for him to do so, it was to be expected from him. But he never did it. Okay, maybe occasionally, but still. Tony didn't get why but what did he know about kids.
Peter's eyes swam over all the familiar covers before they landed on the Finding Nemo poster and exclaimed, "Nemo! Nemo!"
When he reached them, Peter looked up to his dad from his position. "Are we really gonna live with Tony now, daddy?" His eyes shining bright with hope and excitement.
They drove for a while more in silence, except for the occasional babbling coming from the toddler. Tony took a turn and stopped a few miles into the road. Steve looked at him confused. "Where are we and why are we here?"
"Worth it." Tony joined their lips together and poking his tongue out to lick Steve's lips. Steve let out a breath and opened his mouth, pressing his lips further into Tony's.
"I want you." Steve became quiet. "If you'll let me have you. I know you saw me at the daycare the other day-"
"I'm glad." Tony grinned, kissing him once more. "I'm so glad." He kissed him again. "So very glad." He kissed him again. Steve pulled him closer, wrapping his arms around him.
Peter stared at the movie posters before going to Steve and climbing onto his lap, with Steve's help, and brought his mouth to Steve's ear who leaned in. The toddler cupped his mouth so only his father could hear, although he hadn't quite mastered the art of whispering as of yet. But Tony wasn't going to comment on that.
Steve smiled at Tony and all Tony could do was stare at him. He was pretty sure his eyes were showing exactly what he was feeling, and hoped to whatever celestial being listening in on them to make sure Steve didn't find him a creep.
