“Aren’t you kind?” John replied. “You keep it, though. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on your favourites.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows, but in the end he was probably relieved not to have to give up even one of the candies. Daddy rubbed his hands together and offered, “Shall we look at what else we’ve got?”
Sherlock’s voice when his reply came was softer, too—different enough that anyone would notice, which is why only John ever got to hear it. He tapped each of several test tubes in their stand in its turn, with one finger. “These all have different reagents in them and I wait to see if the colour changes,” he reported. “And how long it takes and how much different it gets.”
“If you’ll be ready for a break in about a half hour, I’m going to run out and pick up a few things, then when I come back—”
“Oh, what’s wrong, darling boy?” John soothed, though of course he knew exactly what was wrong, had anticipated his reiteration of their rules might provoke Sherlock to a display of emotion. “Sweetheart, you’re fine, Daddy’s got you.”
From the bedroom, his boy Locky’s voice, “In here!” around his thumb, which he was meant to be giving up, but Daddy John wouldn’t say a word against it—not today. Today was for making his boy feel how very much his Daddy loved him. No scolding. No punishments.
Locky will have to ask about this later though, because now Daddy puts another of his fingers inside, and twists, and presses onto that spot inside that makes Locky’s whole body light up and sing, and he shivers again, this time very hard, and he can’t help but gasp, “Daddy!” and Daddy makes a growly sound that means he is very pleased, and very excited, and Locky wants what he wants and he wants it right away, so he says it, right out loud, not shy.
“All right.” Daddy turns his face a little and Locky digs his head into the pillow to get close to his ear. He whispers very quiet but he spills the words right out.
“It’s not. . .” God this was hard. John hated talking like this, these negotiations. He’d been so relieved when the bulk of it was clearly behind them, after the initial few awkward discussions about Sherlock wanting them to sometimes enact these scenarios, play these roles. “That’s not our. . .thing. Vibe.
“Because that would be fun for you, I know—and for me, too—but I can’t let you do anything that could put us in jail.”
Sherlock sniffed hard, let John arrange the dressing gown over his back, tie it shut at his waist. John touched his face.
John nuzzled into the dank-smelling heat of him, in the fold between belly and thigh, pubic hair rough against one cheek, tongue digging in to taste body salts and the musk of Sherlock’s pleasure. Sherlock’s hand stroked his hair a few times, then down the back of his neck. John kissed and nuzzled his way up Sherlock’s body, there in the curve of his hip, up over the crest of the bone, down again into the soft bellyskin at the side of his waist. He steadied himself with an arm half-around Sherlock’s back, kissed his way up the belly, dragged the tip of his nose up his sternum, inhaling the different, more open scent of light perspiration between his pectoral muscles, there over his heart. Ultimately, he pressed kisses in the hollow between Sherlock’s collarbones, and all the while Sherlock made happy little puppy-whimpering noises through closed lips, and ran the long, bony fingers of one hand along the back of John’s neck and shoulders, his triceps, biceps, sounding so pleased to feel his daddy’s strong arms.
John opened his lips and sank down on Sherlock’s prick, then sucked as he pulled back. Sherlock let go a tremulous moan, partway between pleasure and distress. John hummed approval and sank down again, mouth full of spit, tongue rolling though there was little room for it to move. He sucked harder on the way back, and Sherlock groaned. As John’s head moved forward again, he relaxed his throat to take Sherlock as deeply as he could manage, and slid his hand down along Sherlock’s buttock until his fingers sank into the cleft, and he squeezed, pulling Sherlock closer, barely tickling the perspiring skin between his arse cheeks with probing fingertips. He sucked hard as he pulled back, rocking his head on his neck, drawing a yelping cry from Sherlock. He pulled off and swallowed a mouthful of gathered saliva.
. . .?” Locky makes a sound like he is thinking it over even though he knows what he wants. “Can I whisper it in your ear, Daddy?”
“That’s fine,” John told him, and two fingers rode up the side of Sherlock’s neck into his hair, nails against his scalp, gently twisting curls around his knuckles. He tugged gently, persuading, and Sherlock lifted his face to meet John’s gaze, then quickly looked away again in his embarrassment at having been caught. John told him, “It’s fine to get excited and want to touch yourself. So, then. . .we know you’re a big boy. No need to be embarrassed.”
“What would you like?” John asks, and already he is rampant, his cock thick and unyielding where it brushes Sherlock’s low belly. Sherlock needs, just today, right now, what he needs is. . .
. . .coming up,” John started. “I wanted to say some things I normally would never.” He looked at Sherlock, whose expression was placid, attentive, and open. “Cruel things.”
—then grinned his charming, boyish grin, and it seemed they were both sufficiently reassured, because after a quick, crooked kiss on John’s chin, Sherlock was leaning back and away, toward the bags on the table again. “Is it. . .?” he began, then seemed to remember himself, recognize he might sound greedy, and some of the eagerness went out of his voice. “I like my presents but are there any more?”
“We’ll talk about it in the morning,” Sherlock said quietly, agreeably, as if hearing John’s own thoughts. “Let’s get ready for bed.” He kissed John’s forehead again, and his closed eye.
Daddy’s hands loosen from around Locky’s hips, and Locky sinks down because his thighs are tired and shaking, but Daddy’s cock is so deep in him and feels so good. . .Locky starts to rock forward and back, his belly and shoulders following along, snaky, and he sucks and sucks his thumb—all of it, not just the tip like he sometimes does--and Daddy moves under him and his voice is very rocky and rough.
“You’re very welcome. I told you I was going to spoil you.” Sherlock held Goggie up against his neck, just under his chin. “And now you get to choose what else you might like,” John prompted, “to make you feel good.”
John sucked twice, three times, drew back just long enough to say, “My sweet, good boy. I love making you feel good,” then quick-licked his lips and pressed forward again, taking more of Sherlock’s cock in his mouth and sucking just a bit more firmly before releasing—a quiet, appreciative groan around his boy’s prick—then sucking again. Sherlock’s cock twitched, and he thrust slightly harder, with longer strokes as his hips rolled more urgently, and Sherlock’s fingers raked backwards through his daddy’s hair. John changed the tempo and pressure of his finger against Sherlock’s opening, tightly puckered and slick with sweat, dragging down, and down, and down over it, pausing at the top of each pass.
John kept his nose and mouth tucked into the deep heat of Sherlock’s pubic hair, and let his hand slide up the length of his prick, drawing a low whimper from Sherlock. John circled his palm over the crown, gathering pre-cum to ease his way back down to the base. His dragging thumb gently tugged Sherlock’s foreskin back as he went, and Sherlock hummed. John let his chin dip, leading the way, wet his lips and brushed them soft and wet against Sherlock’s bollocks, closing gently  to suck, then immediately curling his tongue around beneath. He slid his hand again, squeezing softly the way he knew Sherlock liked, and ducked his head low, his tongue stroking flat and wide and wet—but soft, slow, sweet—up between Sherlock’s balls, then continuing along the underside of his prick, feeling the ridge of vein, tasting the stale, faintly sour taste of his own left-behind saliva until he reached the crown and slowly, oh-so-slowly, circled his tongue around it, flicking gently against the sensitive spot beneath.
, and starts to sigh out the breath. He goes heavy and limp onto his daddy’s chest, and the cold slimy feeling pushes
Sherlock drew a hard breath in through his nose, and John could feel him consciously relaxing, his jaw softening, turning his head to adjust the angle.
! But when daddy says he’s naughty, Locky has to watch out because usually what comes next is that Daddy makes him get the hairbrush and gives him loud, hurting spankings. Locky’s bum is already sore from all the grabbing and pinching; he does not want heavy smacks on top of it.
“Use my mouth, sweetheart. You’ve been waiting a long time. Give Daddy’s throat a good fucking, my big boy. I want you to feel so g—”
.” The reply was languid and soft. John had reached the opposite edge of his chest by then, so smoothed his palm back the way he’d just come, as if erasing what he’d just drawn. He used the tips of three fingers, dragging downward, then again, and again, working his way back across Sherlock’s chest. He littered soft kisses down the side of Locky’s face, starting beside his eye, down toward his jaw.
“Of course,” John told him, and began to stroke his hand down from the top of Sherlock’s head, down the long side of his neck, down his chest.
. . .” his daddy groans then, and Locky looks at his face to make sure he’s all right. Daddy grabs Locky in the fold where his thigh and belly meet, and starts to drag him up and pull him down, harder and deeper and faster. It feels so good and Locky’s willy is so hot and throbby, so hard.
“You’re not petting,” Sherlock accused, bordering on fresh in a way that made John think he was testing the boundaries, to see if John would scold him, or punish him.
They blew over the surfaces of their tea, sipped at it. John could feel the creases in his face from frowning.
John was quick and efficient in rising to stand, getting a solid grip on Sherlock’s jaw, and guiding the head of his prick into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s facial muscles flexed beneath his fingers and thumb, trying to close his mouth or pull away, but John held him, thrusting the crown of his cock in and back, not too far. Sherlock gagged nonetheless.
John caught precisely what Sherlock was trying to remind him of, and he cut a quick glance around the fluorescent-lit kitchen. Their love nest
very pretty,” John assured, and placed another kiss—this time with parted lips—at the very crest of Sherlock’s hip, moved a bit, kissed again. “Every bit of you is just perfect.” Another kiss, with a swipe of John’s tongue tip. “Spare a pillow for your old daddy?” John asked, and Sherlock passed him one, which John arranged under his neck. “I want to take my time making you feel good, and being so sweet to you, my pretty boy.”
Daddy’s fingers are a little cold and very slimy when they touch Locky’s bottom, and he pulls Locky’s cheek away with his other hand, making everything go tight and stretched. “Take a breath,” Daddy tells him, “and when you blow it out, go slow and try to go all soft and melted everywhere, like a floppy soft toy.”
“And nothing violent; no punishment. I can’t mix up physical violence with these dark feelings. It’s too. . .I can’t look into that abyss. I’m afraid of where that could go.”
“I’ll clean you up a bit—very warm and gentle, I promise—and we’ll have a little nap together? There’s still the whole evening ahead with nothing to do, but we probably shouldn’t sleep it away.”
”—but he ventures to lick Daddy’s lips a bit, and even presses the very tip of his tongue right between Daddy’s closed lips until they open, and there is the tip of his Daddy’s tongue, flickering back at him, and Locky shivers again.
“Open your mouth, pretty boy,” Daddy says then, and his voice is a little growly and he grabs hard at Locky’s bottom, rubbing and grabbing all over. Locky lets his eyes close a little, and lets his mouth open a little, and Daddy kisses him in that very grown-up way, with his thick tongue pressed in and sweeping, licking Locky’s tongue, then catching Locky’s wet bottom lip between his teeth, sucking it, shoving in his tongue again. Daddy’s hand behind Locky’s head holds him still so he can’t pull away even though the kisses are very wet and Locky is losing his breath. Daddy’s hand on his bum is grabbing hard, pinching, and Locky knows he will have marks there later to remind him that he is his Daddy’s boy; even though it hurts a bit—just a bit, nothing like a spanking with Daddy’s hairbrush or the wooden spoon—Locky likes it because it feels good, and because he knows Daddy will be pleased to see the marks he’s left there, later on, long after they’ve finished playing.
Sherlock’s voice was full of muck and he kept his head turned toward the wall so John couldn’t see his face. “It comes out,” he whispered, and sniffed. “Jizz comes out.”
“Is your pretty cock hard there under the bedclothes? Tell me the truth now. I’ll know if you if you’re lying.”
“I didn’t like it,” Sherlock sobbed out around his thumb, his forehead pressed tight into the divot below John’s collarbone. “He made me say dirty words. He looked at me. . .”
John pressed his fingertips against a headache taking root between his eyebrows. “Maybe we should—I’ll take care of your welts and tuck you into bed—but maybe we should call it a night.”
More than his own stuff—of which there certainly was some; John knew he was not actually an abuser and never would be, but he was still working through the intellectual part of all that emotion he’d processed—John was really hanging onto to the fact that Sherlock had looked at him with wide, terrified eyes; Sherlock had wept and turned away from him; Sherlock had sounded small and ashamed and afraid; Sherlock had said
Sherlock was over John’s knee, trousers around his thighs, open shirt rumpled up around his shoulder blades, and he sniveled and sobbed against the duvet. It was the sniveling that had made John move from smacking his arse with his bare hand (thirty smacks; Daddy John was at his wit’s end with his boy Locky and his seemingly willful refusal to obey Daddy’s scold about not sucking his thumb)—Sherlock had rubbed his snotty nose and upper lip against the coverlet during the spanking and it had only made John crosser. So out came the brush (Sherlock hated it, had even tried to hide it once after a spanking). Now he was crying in earnest, lurching forward with a loud whimper after each blow landed, trying to wriggle away.
“No, of course not. You’re not really like that, John. I know you’re not; you’re good. You’re a good man.”
“I’m home, sweetheart,” he called, and started unpacking one of the bags onto the table. The other he folded shut for the time being.
“Not anymore,” Sherlock said into John’s shirt, and there was a wet spot gathering there from the bit of saliva escaping the corner of his mouth, around his thumb. “Dirty,” Sherlock spit out, and his shoulders heaved.
“So these things you were feeling just now, really it’s the same as what we do—playing a role. It’s just another way to process emotion. Maybe saying those things aloud, or enacting whatever you might want to, can help you get rid of it.” Sherlock’s voice was so kind, and the fact he was using his big brain to analyze John’s emotional needs was touching. John felt partially unburdened just knowing Sherlock was accepting of him, wanted to help him through this muck.
“Eyes on me, sweetheart,” John crooned, and stroked one hand up Sherlock’s forearm. “Something wrong?”
Sherlock did a slow-motion wriggle beneath the blankets, as if uncomfortable. John ran fingers through his hair, down the back of his neck, then again.
— “You know you’re meant to settle down and take your punishment. You oughtn’t be thinking about. . .”
John’s throat thickened and his heart ached. He smiled softly up at his darling boy, and said, “If that’s what you want, I’d love to be sweet to you. You’ll feel so good, I know. Just softly. Softly.” John’s voice had faded to a whisper by the time he finished, and he shifted himself down the bed so that he was leaning on his elbow by Sherlock’s hip. He ducked to plant a kiss on the crest of bone there, then let his hand stroke down Sherlock’s pyjama-clad thigh, the crown of Sherlock’s erection already making itself known, pushing out through the fly, leaking clear fluid from the slit.
“I was just thinking,” Sherlock picked up his earlier thread. “It’s unfair you’re still carrying the burden he gave you; maybe you could give it up to me a bit. I can carry some of it for you.”
Since then, it had been life as usual—no case on, Sherlock in the kitchen with the beakers and test tubes and Bunsen burner; John doing some consulting for a surgeon he knew, about an injury that resembled one John had frequently repaired during the war—and they hadn’t talked about it again. Sherlock had assured John he was fine and they’d vaguely agreed they might reassure themselves all was well, the next time they took up their Daddy and boy roles. But that was the total of the discussion, and they’d set it aside. They both knew it was there, but neither had an urgent need to look at it until he was—or more to the point, John was—ready.
Daddy moves up on the bed and kisses him, even around his thumb, his tongue slipping and sliding over and around it to find Locky’s tongue. Daddy’s mouth tastes salty-sour because of Locky’s jizz. Locky likes it even though it’s nasty.
“The things he did. The way he must have manipulated those boys, warped them into accepting that all those things he did were somehow their own fault, or made them think it was normal, or terrorized them to keep them quiet. . .” John shook his head. “I guess it’s just not out of my system yet. The disgust.”
“I like it,” Locky says, because even though he doesn’t like it at the moment, he knows he will soon be feeling his daddy’s big cock in his bottom and that feels so good—hurts and feels good all at the same time—and Daddy makes lovely noises and says lovely things when Locky rocks his bum, or slides, or bounces. Only big brave boys can take a big cock inside them, and Locky is very brave and big. Sometimes.
“Fingers,” is all Locky can say at first, because it’s hard to be brave about dirty talk sometimes, even with his Daddy, who says it’s all right and that big boys can use dirty words. Locky never gets in trouble for saying bad words, not even
“God, you dirty boy,” John muttered, and dragged his hand down onto Sherlock’s jaw. He forced his thumb into Sherlock’s mouth, felt Sherlock’s tongue retreat from it. “You were thinking about some other boy’s cock just now when I came in, weren’t you?” He pressed down and Sherlock couldn’t get away from it, his tongue hot and velvety against the pad of John’s probing thumb. “Pulling your hard little prick. . .and thinking about
Locky’s willy is so hard and burning, and Daddy takes it right down his mouth, all hot and wet, and Locky pushes, pushes, pushes, and Daddy holds his thighs, and his hips, digs his fingers into Locky’s bottom—he will have bruises on bruises for days to come—and then Daddy hauls back and smacks his bum, and it
“I don’t want to say,” Sherlock said, and he dragged the stuffed dog from where it was tucked between neck and shoulder, up onto his tipped-back face, covering it.
“Sure you’re OK?” he asked quietly, searching Sherlock’s face for any sign of lingering emotional trauma. He looked normal, strong and sure and kind, and John felt safer with each passing moment.
“Well, a few nice things,” John told him, and took Sherlock’s hand to guide him to the sofa. They both sat, and Sherlock tucked his legs up under him, bare feet tucked in beside his daddy’s thigh. “First, there are these.” He raised the plastic bag already in his hand, of strawberry-flavoured hard candies with soft, flowing centers. “I know you like them.”
He slept easy that night after they’d indulged his dark impulse to roleplay his childhood abuse, in order that he might work through some feelings. The catharsis that followed had left John wracked with sobs: the sort of unguarded, shameless crying he couldn’t recall having done in adulthood—perhaps never in his life—and had wrung him out completely. They’d showered together, not talking much, then fell into bed.  Sherlock had tucked John against his chest, holding him close and safe in the arc of one long, muscular arm, and John had slept the night through, deeply and soundly. As they often did for each other, Sherlock had checked in with John the next morning as they puttered over coffee and toast in the kitchen.
John shook his head, not wanting to admit that Sherlock’s suggestion sounded like an immense relief. An urge to say aloud, or even act on, the dark things he’d been feeling—was still feeling, still thinking, couldn’t seem to shake—was frightening. He didn’t like what it might mean about him and who he was, even in some small way, deep down.
—Daddy’s fingers—more than one—and it’s so, so much, and it burns, and Locky’s body wants to push Daddy’s fingers away but he keeps breathing out forever,
Sherlock’s voice was croaky, thick with sleepiness and something else that John’s deep gut reacted to. “Yes. Feels good.”
“I don’t want to say those things, like he said to me. I don’t want to bring that into what we share when you’re my boy and I’m your daddy. I feel like it makes me a sick pervert.”
“I’m sorry,” John said, lip quivering childishly. He could feel the snot on his upper lip and he hated it.
“Pretty boy. Does it feel good?” he asked softly, and drew enough of Sherlock’s crown back between his lips to gently suck, matching the quiet motion of Sherlock’s hips.
“How do you know you’re finished?” John asked, and found Sherlock’s wrist once more, digging beneath the sheets for it. Sherlock resisted his pull but John was insistent, and he held Sherlock’s palm steady so he could rock his prick up against it a bit, rolling his hips as he talked.
“Love you too, Daddy” he said quickly. The wet way his voice sounded as he sucked on the candy made John have to shift a bit in his seat, but Sherlock only looked with curiosity at the carrier bags on the coffee table, craning his neck a bit.
John kept up with his worship of Sherlock’s sensitive nipples, feeling how they had become swollen from the attention, were probably headed toward oversensitivity, maybe even a bit sore. He made a questioning noise and Sherlock’s body shivered as John’s voice vibrated through his chest.
Sherlock nodded his understanding. “Uh-huh,” he said around his thumb, then went back to sucking on it. Not just the tip of his thumb, John noticed, but the whole thing, which he only did when he was very aroused, or feeling in great need of comfort. Since clearly the former was not the case at the moment, John could only assume something was upsetting him.
It looked red! The spot on the shaft was flushed crimson, and the rest of him was bright pink as if it had been furiously rubbed or something. John forced himself to not comment on it and instead put more hydrocortisone on his finger.
“Yeah, I know. It’s bit inapprobiate—uh,” John halted as if sensing something was wrong with the word. “I mean, y’know.” He flailed his hands before cupping himself through his jeans again, groaning as his eyes rolled to the back of his head.
He had to admit that Sherlock was more often than not the center of his attention, so he supposed this was perhaps bound to happen. Maybe John’s sub consciousness simply wanted to let him know that the detective was still safe and sound. But wasn’t this a tad extreme?
What had happened last night wasn’t supposed to happen. None of it was supposed to happen like this.
Sherlock felt a sudden wave of heat surge into his face as he frantically held back another spasm of his bladder. He snapped his eyes up to John, gasping as his bladder tensed.  “John! I'm going to have to urinate!”
Holmes, appearing eager for more, pressed himself against the fingers, rolling his hips up and trying to stroke himself against the fingers. His breath hitched as Watson withdrew his hand.
And of course Sherlock had left without having had any kind of breakfast. Knowing him, he probably hadn’t even had a single sip this morning, damn it. Damn it all.
Closing the wardrobe again, John sighed. There would be enough time to move his things, but today was not the day.
“Holmes, I think it best you hold this against you. It ought to ease the pain and prevent any further swellings."
Sherlock's pubic hairs were dark, neatly groomed, his soft penis rested prettily between his thighs, lovely and small, and still so very rosy from the incident.
As more things got registered in his head, John realised that his other hand was holding something very warm and soft, something that John seemed to have held on to for the whole night long, if the stiffness in his arm was anything to go by.
Moments after Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, seemingly and hopefully not noticing anything unusual about John.
John breathed heavily. “Acceptable? Bloody hell, Sherlock. You- god. What does that even mean?” Sweeping a hand through his hair, John shook his head unbelieving. Acceptable was the same as tolerable, usually it meant it was just on the abyss of bearable. And bearable was a horrid word, people used it in sentences like ‘the pain was just bearable’; it meant they had to endure something usually unpleasant.
“Everything. The press of your touch, the movement of your fingertips, it’s all essential information to how you touch your own penis.”
The sound of the toilet lid being lifted was heard; John stared transfixed at his black keyboard, barely breathing. He thought for a split moment that he could make out the snap of a waistband, but it seemed an impossible thing to hear, after all, the walls weren’t that thin.
After a breathless moment the detective continued again, looking flustered, “-not a request! I’m not begging for this!”
The doctor raised his eyebrows at Holmes' uncharacteristically red face, and licked his lips daringly. "It is not? Pray tell, whatever do you mean, old boy? Surely, the great Mister Sherlock Holmes can tell that he's got a small stiff pricklet on display, yes?"
“Nothing,” Sherlock shrugged, eyes flittering away sheepishly as he twisted his body towards the opened door to his bedroom.
Watson counted in a soft tone while massaging Holmes' back with his thumb. The detective had his gaze intently fixed on the ground; his face was a mask of pained concentration until he seemed to gradually gain control of his breathing again.
Sherlock's deep voice pulls him from his stupor, making him blink. There’s a frown plastered across Sherlock's face. "Yeah I'll just ... get on with it, I guess."
Then John had a mop of curls pressed under him, sighing and nuzzling around his neck and John simply melted.
“You know, I wondered what you meant when you said ‘would be amenable for it’.” John said, hoping he won’t regret his decision of broaching the topic. Twirling the shoelaces between his fingers, he glanced up at Sherlock, seeing a furrow between his brows.
The great detective held onto him, gripping and leaning on his shoulder as he moved, he had his legs a bit more parted than usual, indicating that his bollocks must have received the majority of the trauma. His member didn't show any off putting redness or swelling from the incident itself.
Sherlock pants, “God, John, please – let me, oh!” his hips jerk desperately as he tries to buck up into John’s mouth, moaning. The doctor pulls slightly away, flicking the tip of his tongue against the glans and swallows the fluids gathered there, vigorously rubbing at the weeping slit, tasting it and eliciting another gasp.
Sherlock seemed to struggle to reply properly when he suddenly gasped out and shut his eyes in an effort to hold his bladder back. He rocked his hips forward, voice strangled, "God John, don't be an idiot, you must -
- Sherlock had really needed to   p i s s , he could feel the force behind it, feel and see how it just sprayed everywhere.
"Watson," Holmes said anxiously, his face was flushed dark with humiliation at the state of his prick.
Throwing a glance to his side and then down Sherlock’s crotch, John felt a sudden tension grow between them.
“Open my trousers, John,” Sherlock demanded impatiently, angling his hips forward to draw attention to his bulge. “
John felt weak at the sight, hands slowly drifting away as Sherlock finished, cock starting to soften as the spray of water washed the mess one by one away.
John’s laugh instantly died from his lips as he realised something went very wrong just now. Confused, John thought their conversation was going rather well, until now.
Pulling himself together, John realised that he needed to turn the water off at some point as there was barely any soap left. Well. If John stood up and, oh so accidentally let the last shower stream rain down all over Sherlock’s pointy little cock, so he be damned.
His sensitive prick slapped against his belly, and Watson only gaped in silent fascination. He looked at Holmes who had his hands covered over his flushed face, and the doctor was overcome with a sudden feeling of wonder.
And so they spent half their evening pleasantly snogging one another, with John sitting on the couch and Sherlock planted on his lap with his legs wrapped around John’s waist. Despite the gypsum covered arms between them, they managed to find a comfortable position to kiss.
He often wondered what Sherlock was packing, and was not overly surprised to note that his penis was on the small side, flushed pink with a foreskin stretched over the head, Sherlock's cock felt rather dainty in his hand. It was actually quite lovely, John thought.
“Sherlock, you ‘kay? Wait, let me,” John half carried him, half dragged him from the bathroom to his bedroom, swaying and swearing as he stumbled with Sherlock into the bed. “So bloody hot, Sher-lock. I need, ah god. Need a wank.”
"Sherlock, did you think that I....that I wouldn't help you through the day? That I don't care enough? Because I do, you idiot," John said, "Besides you'd make all the assistants cry."
Sherlock stood under the shower stream, facing the white tiled wall with his eyes closed and head thrown back. The water ran down his slender body, down his back and down his-
Shifting on the couch, Sherlock’s foot accidentally bumped John’s shoulder as he moved somewhat ungracefully in his seat. For some reason it took him longer than usual to throw out a reply, making John fleetingly wonder if his question had been simply ignored. Not willing to give up yet, John was about to repeat himself when the detective interrupted him.
"Watson! Watson, I must spend myself," he rasped, desperately moving his long pale fingers down to touch himself. "Let me spend."
Against his better judgement, John held his breath as he tugged him out of his trousers, exposing it to the air. Feeling his heart rate spike up at the sight, he pulled Sherlock towards the urinal, carefully aiming his pink cock down the porcelain as he eagerly waited for him to start pissing.
With a ragged breath, Sherlock buckled his hips frantically, his trail of piss coming in spurts when John slipped his fingers away and trailed them down to his bollocks instead, patting them and feeling their fullness before cupping them tenderly in his palm.
“There you are, dear. Thought I’d take a look at that fridge of yours in case you needed anything. But, oh my dear heavens John,” she trailed off; her brows knitting suddenly as she warily looked at him. “Is everything alright? The both of you just look out of this world.”
"Poor little thing", Watson said in playful sympathy when Holmes' member stiffened further, showing and spending its first essence.
“I think a few? I suppose, er,” steps faltering, John blinked for a moment, eyes set down Sherlock’s waist as his dazed mind seemed to catch on to something. “You--,
Regardless, a numb feeling spread in his chest as he walked into Sherlock’s bedroom, opening the closet while being instructed what to pick out from the vast collection of fine fabrics. With goosebumps on his skin, John cursed the cold air in the room, shivering as he grabbed a meticulously rolled pair of socks and pants.
A tousled mess of curls were standing up on all ends, half of them smashed against the union jack pillow. John silently approached the couch and peered down, confirming after a moment that Sherlock really was sound asleep.
And quickly, it appeared to overwhelm Holmes. Mouth agape, he struggled to gasp out the words, breath stuttering. "W-Watson! Too much, too much," he cried, flailing his hands helplessly.
The words rang in his head, and John licked his dry lips, taking a moment to gather his thoughts, distracted at feeling Sherlock’s penis jerk in his hand. Absent-mindedly, he gave it a gentle squeeze, aware that Sherlock was still not done peeing.
At that point John’s whole world starts to spin, he is sure that he must have misheard, misunderstood Sherlock. Because this sounds like – like –
It must be Saturday, one of those special days where John did not have to go out to work and do his dull job.
With his mouth half open, he takes the tip of Sherlock’s prick between his lips, pressing the flat of his tongue against him, rubbing him shamelessly. He does so for a few brief seconds, trying to gauge a taste. Above him he again hears something drop on the table, feels Sherlock squirm in his chair as John suddenly pulls away with his head spinning slightly.
"A miscalculation on my part. Won't happen again," Sherlock tried brightly, hoping for John to return to his happy mood.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed after a moment, mouth agape to let out a barely audible pant between his lips. “Don’t stop.”
Hearing abrupt movements behind him, John turned around only to come face to face with his towering flatmate.
The lanky git wasn't one bit affected by what had happened, acting as if nothing was out of sorts. He probably had deleted the whole incident or something. Though thinking of it now, he wondered, was that how Sherlock dealt with such things? John gathered that Sherlock must have been somewhat embarrassed, especially when John had caught him …wanking?
Groaning around the ruddy head in his mouth, John shuts his eyes as he spills into his own hand, vision blurred for a moment. Blinking, he listens to the heavy panting above.
The last incident was a miscalculation, an error of his transport. What occured was inconvienient, though not entirely suboptimal. The image of John holding his penis was not at all unwelcome, Sherlock had it carefully filed up in his mind palace before he had moved on to delete the more undignified part in which he had displayed a significant lack of control.
Adding a noise for dramatics, John sighed in obvious relief when his gushing stream slowed down, letting the last drops drip into the toilet bowl, before giving himself a little squeeze and flushing the toilet. He quickly tucked himself away and turned to look at his frozen flatmate.
“Look at you, you can’t even control that prick of yours.” He said, looking at it intently, he couldn’t help but add, “And it's so small and lovely.”
The doctor returned with his medical bag in his hand and a bowl with water. He pushed a chair towards the bed and sat down, telling Holmes in an assuring voice, "Alright, Holmes. You must part your legs, so I can have a proper look. It will make this much easier for the both of us."
The detective huffed suddenly, rolling his eyes. “Yes. I do know what ‘sexual’ entails, John. And as I have just said, I didn’t mind yesterday. It was good, nice, acceptable.”
He sounded so confused that John almost regretted his joke. “Well, no. I just wondered when that, er,
He wondered if he didn’t stop now, the level of perversity he was moving on to would rise up to such a level that sooner or later it’d be written all over his face. And people would undoubtedly notice.
“You enjoy it, John, I enjoy it. It’s mutual. Previous to your drunken slip, you’ve called my penis small before. It’s fine, I don’t mind. I appreciate it.”
Alarmed, Sherlock remembered his bladder, but he was 490 milliseconds too late. Despite his immediate effort to hold the light trail of urine back, it still escaped his urethra and dribbled down to land on John's foot.
“Different variations for ‘small penis’. Your drunken mind has helpfully supplied me with words such as ‘wee-wee’ and ‘little one’. I don’t mind.”
Hastily throwing a glance at the cab driver, John hoped he didn’t hear anything. He scarcely could believe Sherlock was still in a state; surely he was just trying to get back at John.
Thinking about Sherlock’s penis, John couldn’t come up with any other words besides lovely and small.
John's fingers twitched at the sight. He wanted to hold it again, feel its softness and girth, pull the foreskin back and gaze at its bare tip. He quickly darted his eyes away and swallowed heavily, feeling far too aroused in his pants. Christ, he needed to scold himself.
Well, being quite fair, neither of them had really taken a piss while the other was still in the bathroom, blatantly watching.
Letting out a breath, he admitted, “Look, I’ve got a libido, Sherlock. Just, the sight of having you naked, seeing you… it does things to me.”
“You berk. And you proposed I should suck your cock for some ludicrous experiment. Why the hell didn’t you ask me this bloody thing sooner?”
John swallowed, his own cock aching in his pants when Sherlock started to stiffen in his grip, feeling him quiver as he continued to piss with some difficulty. The detective seemed flustered at how responsive he was, occasionally muttering to John with a warning undertone, “Don’t squeeze.”
John left Sherlock behind, entering the bedroom. His hands were fisted so tightly his fingernails cut into his palms. He cursed himself as he felt his weak shoulder start to ache.
Seemingly startled at the sudden filthy words, Sherlock appeared a bit taken aback, though a lovely flush tinted the detective’s cheek.
Sherlock’s pale face flushed ever so slightly when John looked at him, the brilliant eyes quickly darting away at the question, looking somewhat unsure. John rushed in for reassurance, not certain what the detective was thinking, he continued, “Because this is important to know, Sherlock. I don’t want to do anything that you don’t enjoy and like, yeah? And I’m sorry we’re only talking about this now, we should have done this a bit earlier.” John chuckled nervously, suddenly aware how much they yet had to talk about and figure out in their relationship.
“Apologies, old boy. Here now, let me,” he said as he settled his body next to Holmes’, leaning his head down to come face to face with the man.
“You alright?” John abruptly asks because fuck. He needs a little break.Mainly he needs a break because his own cock throbs in his too tight jeans and desperately needs some relief. He practically has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep quiet while yanking down his zipper, staring at the detective’s stiffening, pretty-pink- -
Sherlock had lowered his eyes down his gypsum covered arms as he quietly murmured a word that John didn’t quite catch.
He blinked the memory away as he heard a gasp above him. John felt a racing heartbeat underneath his fingers and instantly woke from his daydream, realising what his hands were doing. Staring stock still embarrassed, he had the palm of his hands plastered all over the detective's chest, feeling the warm and smooth texture of the warm skin. The treacherous tips of his fingers were drawing little circles over the ribs and John cursed himself as he quickly withdrew his hands, slightly distracted at the two nipples he was seeing.
Feeling encouraged, he added, “Or if I held your lovely little prick? Watching how you make wee-wee?”
For some reason he felt overly curious to hear any sounds coming from said room, and so John remained in his frozen pose, fingers resting over the keyboard, quietly hoping to gauge what Sherlock was doing.
Sherlock would be pissing helplessly as John walked in, he’d be unable to stop urinating midstream, and John would have the perfect opportunity to stand next to him, have a little glance of his lovely penis between his fingers, and see how the urine escaped the tip.
Looking down, John did the same to the glans: eagerly dragging the edge of his crown right against Sherlock’s overly sensitive, exposed flesh, circling him in little lines, teasing him and paying special attention to the little slit, rubbing it until Sherlock cried out in ecstasy, hips rocking forwards as he ejaculated in thick spurts; his semen landing on John’s cock and shirt.
He also took himself in hand and immediately noted the considerable difference between his and Holmes’ flesh. Holmes was so much smaller than him, all dainty and short, penis much more compacter than his. The thought proved to be so arousing to him that he felt himself jerk in his grip. He saw no other reason but to give in and join Holmes’ forbidden behavior.
That’s when John furrowed his eyebrows, feeling even more confused. “Nice? No one uses that word together with acceptable, Sherlock.”
John hurried to the kitchen and refilled the cup again, wanting to ensure himself that his patient drank enough, he felt guilty for neglecting his duties like that. Sherlock must drink more.
Nodding satisfied, John’s eyes flickered over Sherlock’s figure. He was sure the morgue would improve his mood, especially the samples that Molly had put aside for him. Whatever happened, John was determined to drag the detective there whatever he wanted to or not.
Watson licked his frozen lips, and puffed out a hot breath, watching it swirl in the cold air. The freezing weather had numbed his fingers and he fiercely tried to rub them together, turning to his friend with a red nose.
“Alright, first let’s get you out of those bloody trousers,” he said pulling the material down Sherlock’s legs and tossing it to the side before leaning down to wipe at his groin.
“Right, okay.” John was not sure what he should make of the information, so he let it go for now. Staring at Sherlock for a moment, he couldn’t believe they were having this conversation in the first place.
"John, I need the plastic bags!" Sherlock stalked right into John's personal space, demanding immediate attention.
Sherlock’s words drowned in a strangled hiss as John tightened his hand around him, carefully allowing the cock in his hand some stimulation. The detective immediately responded by thrusting slightly, letting his hard prick slide in and out of the tight circle that John’s hot hand made.
Blinking rapidly, the detective looked more than just flustered that John had caught his reaction, as he stumbled over his words.
Breaking apart with a wide breathless smile, John slid a hand through Sherlock’s dark curls, musing them up ever so slightly.
, and scruffily he wondered how that came to be. Something in the pit of his stomach told him that he was forgetting something. Blinking, John massaged his temples as he attempted to rid himself from the ache in his head. He never got this type of headache, the sort that also made some people a bit nauseous. Dimly he wondered if it was perhaps caused by Sherlock’s mattress, John wasn’t exactly used to sleeping on such soft surfaces but he normally didn't have too much trouble to getting used to that.
"No,” Watson said decidedly, catching the hands and pushing them against the bed sheets. Holding him there, he shifted to kneel between the long legs, peering at the stiff cockstand before leaning down to give the shaft a kiss. "Patience, Holmes."
“Not what I- alright, never mind. Listen, I want you to urinate so-,” instantly, as though John gave any sort of permission, Sherlock started pissing vigorously, sighing dramatically as his stream rushed out of his swollen length, hitting and spraying the bottom of the tub with more force than he expected.
Feeling panic rise in his chest, Sherlock angled his front towards the wall, away from John, trying to subtly pinch himself between his thighs. The water streamed down his face, making him sputter.
"Alright, Sherlock. I heard you the first time, if you have to take a piss then just...well, just bloody go!" John said heatedly, hoping he sounded somewhat composed.
I hope you liked this chapter as well! I promise, I'll do my best to not keep you waiting for too long!
John bit the inside of his cheek, feeling more than self-conscious when Sherlock stared at him for a moment, eventually giving him one of his body scan looks before frowning once more. “John, while I’m not used to having anyone want to watch me urinate, I don’t object to you observing me. As for the unlocked door, I don’t find any necessity to lock it since I had never done so before, which apparently you have failed to observe.”
“John,” Sherlock protests unimpressed, though a high flush on his cheekbones betrays him and John can’t help but smile like a Cheshire cat.
John half expects him to start wanking himself off, but it’s quite clear after a moment that the detective isn’t after that at all.
’, John realised what his hand had done. Without having been aware of it, he had started squeezing the length in his hand, breaking the graduate flow of urine that was rushing out of Sherlock’s tight little urethra.
The detective had lovely, smooth, rounded testicles, and John had to restrain himself from squeezing them. They looked so full and heavy, when he subtlety weighted them with his fingers.
Blinking, John turned his head, seeing Sherlock standing a few feet away from his chair with a nervous expression on his pale face.
“John, you’re not drunk enough to sleep through this. My penis is cold and my shirt is soaked in urine. I’d appreciate if you –“
It was obvious to John that Sherlock tried to frantically hold himself between his thighs, but blatantly failed to do so. He must be so desperate that his cock was either flopping anywhere but around his thighs, or it was just difficult to reach it, John mused. Well, he's never seen much of Sherlock's penis, so he couldn't say for sure. Though he wouldn't mind having just a bit of a glance of it.
Holmes' member was limp, nestled between the thin legs, looking altogether soft-pink and vulnerable. His bollocks were hanging low, resting against the mattress.
“But you’re such a prat, Sh’lock,” the hand that was squeezing and rubbing turned an angry shade of red as it pressed down the bulge, John jerked into it, “Can’t even let me have any off time from your demands. It’s constantly ‘bored, bored, bored’ or ‘entertain me, John’, but then I go out of m’way and you’re still being a git.”
“No, I don’t mean…it’s not that kind of touching. I just… I’m curious how it, ah, feels. In my hand.” John quickly shut his mouth, hoping he didn’t just horribly embarrass Sherlock.
Standing up with a groan, he grimaced at the blazing morning light that hit his eyes. Despite the ache in his leg and shoulder, he forced himself to move, bending down to make his bed, tucking the sheets back into their place. Straightening his pillow, John angrily tossed it back on top, cursing his aching limps. He was sure Sherlock was going to notice this and make a stupid remark on it; John practically could hear it in his head already, `
“Sorry, but what…what we are by definition? I’m the blogger and you’re the detective, that’s us by definition, I’d say. Or do you mean, ah, the doctor and the genius? I don’t know what else there’d be.” Looking at Sherlock’s openly disappointed face; John scrambled to think of some more words.
Sherlock seemed reluctant to open his legs as he let out distressed, "The zipper. Open the zipper of my trousers first, John! Make it quick! Oh god, I need to,--
Licking his lips, John instead eased the skin back, Sherlock jerked at the sensation, letting out a strangled noise as John slowly revealed the blunt head of his cock.
Holmes felt himself tingling under his companion's observant gaze, and quickly sat up to unwrap the offensive towel around him. His hands were shaking and he was mortified that the cold excited his phallus in such a peculiar way.
John straightened his shoulders, turning around to watch the fidgeting detective. He swiftly flickered his gaze down at him, but couldn't see anything, the legs artfully covered Sherlock's penis.
Holmes made a grimace as he held one of his hands silently up for Watson to place the wrapped snow in. Watson noticed that the detective still wouldn’t look at him, and fleetingly wondered if he was perhaps embarrassed to be in this situation with him.
“For yesterday. As you’re perfectly aware, my body is merely transport. Nothing sentimental. What you did was,” Sherlock paused, eyes rapidly dancing as if searching for something. “It was . . . acceptable.”
Captain John Watson's voice was lower than Doctor John Watson's. Approximately 4,2 Hz lower. A generous drop from 141 Hz to 136,8 Hz. His mind palace was a turmoil, vibrating at its utmost attention and focus. John.
Once it did, he made sure that Holmes was able to get inside the carriage and make himself comfortable on the seat. Watson quickly went out to fetch some snow and carefully put it into a tissue; he hoped it might soothe Holmes.
It was a fresh winter morning, and it started snowing when Holmes and Watson finished a case in the park.
. A lot of piss must be rushing out of Sherlock’s cock that John was sure of. His curiousity was piqued when he kept hearing a brief stutter in the strong stream, wondering exactly just what on earth Sherlock was doing while he was having a wee. A picture formed in his mind. Was his detective playing with himself while he urinated? Was Sherlock playing with himself - his despreate little cock? Was he squezzing and teasing himself until he couldn't piss anymore? Until it was too much for him?
. It was the kind of not good that elicited a dawning regret, and all John wanted to do was to curl up in his bed and clutch his pillow to hide his face.
"Sherlock? What the hell are you --" John turned off the tv and went to the kitchen with his cup in his hand, trying to see what his flatmate was up to.  "Just
John sighed and gestured for Sherlock to sit down so he could feed him. This was, if anything, going to be interesting. It was soup that first came to mind when he thought about dinner, and for good reasons too; he hoped the stubborn prat would eat some of it so there was at least a tinkle of fluid in his body. It was worth a try anyway, John wanted to surpass Sherlock’s ridiculous fuss of not needing to drink much. He sneakily figured, he would make him 'eat' the double liquid portion.
“You’re right, I’ve been out of sorts. And all that we learned about that—” the roll of his hand through the air made it obvious to Sherlock who John was talking about.
“Kisses, please, Daddy.” His voice was hoarse with something like sleep that probably wasn’t sleep. John raised his face and wet his lips, and in the end it was Sherlock who kissed him, his breath still sugary-sweet from the strawberry candies, and John was pleased at his ferocity, licking his tongue into John’s mouth and making a quiet, high noise in his throat.
Sherlock didn’t make a sound in reply, but his hand went to the waistband and he hooked his thumb in, tugging down. John helped, gently pulling at the back so that his hand traced the curve of Sherlock’s bottom as he went, and Sherlock lifted his hip off the mattress until the pyjamas were down around his knees.
“I love you so much, my sweet boy,” John whispered against the soft divot behind his earlobe. “You’re so precious to me.”
They paused for breath and John said, “You needy little thing,” in a tone that conveyed his delight over it, “Kissing Daddy hard.”
John let out a little laugh and went back into the first bag, the open one. “Well, let’s see what else is here for you, sweetheart.  You know I love to make you smile.” He reached into the bag and pulled out a large, flat, square book. “I hope this you’ll like this one,” John said, and passed the book over to Sherlock, who accepted it eagerly, slurping audibly at his strawberry candy. John could hear him click it against the edges of his teeth, waiting for it to be sucked thin enough to bite so the liquid filling would run out onto his tongue, mixing with what was left, turning it chewy.
“If you want to,” John added. “I just thought. . .since we’ve got a few quiet hours to ourselves. . .plenty of time before dinner.”
for kissing.” John kissed him again, sucking Sherlock’s bottom lip hard between his own lips, catching it between his teeth before letting go. As John withdrew, Sherlock swiped the back of his hand across his mouth, then again. His eyes were red when he opened them. John reached into the fly of his boxers and easily freed his own cock, heavy, flushed, running at the crown. “Watch here, see how a man does it. Make sure you’re doing it properly or you’ll make yourself sick, did you know that?”
Daddy’s hands grab Locky’s bum cheeks again and press him up and away, and he holds tight and shoves and pulls, and slides down the bed until his shoulders are between Lockys’ thighs. Locky falls forward to brace himself up on his hands.
John sucked his teeth. “Mine, too. We’re all right. You know how to make it feel good right? You were tugging on it when I came in.”
“Oh, my precious boy,” John murmured against his hair, and kissed him there. “I am so sorry that happened to you. I’m so terribly sorry it was scary and made you feel bad.” John rocked him a bit. He knew well that Sherlock liked to be rocked; it soothed him. “I’m so very, very sorry. Nothing like that should ever happen to a perfect, sweet boy like you.”
John sighs a light groan. “Oh, sweetheart,” he breathes, and catches Sherlock’s chin and kisses him with heat, wide open, agreeing, a kiss to seal it. “Sit up and let’s have a look at you, my lovely boy,” John urges, slipping easily and without hesitation into his Daddy John role, and his boy Locky gives him a shy smile as he rearranges himself on the bed, knees and ankles pretzel-bent with one leg propped up so he can wrap his arms around and hug it, hiding himself a bit, resting his chin on his knee. “Lovely good boy,” Daddy says in his kindest voice, and he reaches for Locky’s ankle and strokes it a bit.
John tried to wave this away, too, but it wasn’t as easy. “Been through it in therapy. Years back. But every now and then things come up that poke at old wounds. Few and far between, but clearly this was one of those things. I don’t want to take out any of my dark mood on you, though, especially not. . .” he let it trail. He looked straight at Sherlock’s raindrop-shaped eyes. “What I love about this thing of ours is that even though it gets a bit rough now and again—“ he motioned at Sherlock’s awkward posture “what it’s really about is this absolutely precious
It had been an awful week. John couldn’t remember when he’d last seen the sun; the weather was wet and raw and sharp. The case they’d worked on was hideous: the disciplinary head of an elite boarding school had turned up dead in spectacular fashion, sawn in eight pieces with his own hacked-off prick jammed in his mouth, and in the course of the investigation it came clear he’d been raping a parade of dozens, if not hundreds, of schoolboys for nearly thirty years. John had been simmering on a low boil of barely-suppressed rage for days, and every one of Sherlock’s social
Sherlock half-smiled and he squeezed John’s hand. “Some would say our game makes us sick perverts, regardless. It’s only because they don’t live in our heads. It doesn’t feel that way to me.”
Sherlock smiled and didn’t hesitate to unwrap another of the glassy-looking pink sweets and suck it between his lips, fiddling it between his front teeth a bit before he guided it inside once and for all with his tongue.
Sherlock didn’t seem to know what to do with two handfuls of sweets, and looked around him, eventually sliding them out of his hands onto the coffee table in a little pile. He took one up and unwrapped it, popped it onto his tongue, and closed his eyes as he began to suck.
“Good boy,” John huffed, and even as he slid his cock around inside Sherlock’s running mouth, he closed the root in the circle of his fingers to keep himself from coming. “That’s a good boy,” he crooned, voice much softer. “I knew you were a good boy. Go on and suck, or lick it like a lolly, do as you like.” Sherlock gave a couple of weak sucks, his cheeks hollowing a bit, then opened wide to swirl his tongue around John’s crown, then sucked again, a bit harder and longer. “That’s lovely. Lovely good boy, sucking a big man’s prick. Very good.” John slid his hand through Sherlock’s hair, clutched the back of his head and pulled him forward a bit. “Relax. . .” he groaned. “Relax. . .open your throat, lovely boy. You can do it. Be brave, now.” He shoved in much deeper, and Sherlock’s eyes went wide and spilled fat tears, but he tolerated it.
Sherlock’s hand quickly flicked up to his face and he swiped away a tear from his cheek. He sniffed. “OK.”
“Well thanks for that,” Daddy says, and laughs a little. “I do my best.” Daddy’s hand moves up and down Locky’s calf a bit, just petting him; Locky loves to be petted and his eyes close for a second even though he isn’t tired. “What are you thinking of, sweetheart?” Daddy asks him, and his hand slides down Locky’s thigh from his knee to his hip, then up again. Locky wriggles a little to unbend his legs and make room. Daddy’s touches are so nice, and he touches everywhere.
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s cheek, soft and lingering. Sherlock inhaled sharply but otherwise was still and silent, safe and sweet, and precious beyond words.
Sherlock’s only response was to remove his thumb from his mouth just long enough to grab his daddy’s hand and place it atop the middle of his own chest. John let out a quiet laugh and settled against the pillows at a more comfortable angle, then began tracing a spiraling pattern across Sherlock’s upper chest, slow and lazy, lightly but not tickling. Once again sucking the tip of his thumb, Sherlock let out a contented hum, and nodded his head on his neck so the fur of the stuffed dog stroked his face.
John offered his hand, Sherlock took it, and they moved to the kitchen. John sank heavily into his usual chair. Sherlock, with his sore backside, did not sit, instead went into the cupboard for mugs and tea sachets, started fixing them each a cup.
Sherlock’s hand moved to stroke his back, his shoulder, down his arm, while the other held him firm and tight, close to Sherlock’s chest.
“You are the most beautiful boy,” Daddy tells him, and kisses Locky’s neck. “You’re so eager. Rocking against me, naughty thing.”
“Right, and if I ever do anything that you don’t like, you can tell me right away. You remember that? That’s one of our rules.”
“Understandable,” Sherlock said quietly. “I only suggested this—” he motioned toward the bedroom “—because I thought it might help us connect a bit. I was caught up in the details of the case.” His voice softened. “I saw you were struggling, John, and I apologise that I didn’t take time to—“
Sherlock rushed his own hand in a wavy path down his own chest and belly. John knew what this meant,
John squeezed his shoulder a bit, leaned over to get a better look. “This one’s already gone a bit green, I see.”
John laid his hand on Sherlock’s cheek, pulled him in for a kiss, then bumped his forehead against Sherlock’s temple, stroked his nose up Sherlock’s cheekbone, and finally kissed him again beside the corner of his closed eye. Against Sherlock’s eyelashes he whispered, “I would never, ever harm you.”
Sherlock was still looking at him expectantly, fingers swirling slowly through the pile of cellophane-wrapped sweets, not only because he wanted another, but because he liked the noise the crinkling wrappers made as he shifted them gently against each other.
“What word do you use when you talk about your private parts?” John asked, trying to sound merely curious but aware that he was failing, and shifted his attentions to Sherlock’s other nipple, pinching and tugging through the t-shirt, rougher now as his own excitement began to flare. He worked to steady his voice around shortening breath. “You know the grown-up words?”
he could live with, as to why he would have such dark urges. Something occurred to him, that he’d never even thought of in therapy, or if he had, he’d stuffed it back down because—like the feelings of physical pleasure he’d often experienced during his abuse, despite the shame and helplessness—it was too frightening to confront. “It was the dad of one of my mates. The mum knew how bad it was for me at home so I was at theirs all the time and she spoiled me. She was lovely; she can’t have known what her husband really was, she’d never have allowed it. God. . .” John paused; he’d had an epiphany even as he was speaking. “She’s another one whose life he made into a lie, isn’t she?” John shook his head, feeling sad for his friend’s mum who really had been a lovely, kind lady who saw John was in need of a safe place and some peace and quiet. After a moment thinking this over, he went on.
He sat down on the edge of the bed—Sherlock’s side, closest to the door—and picked up the hair brush he’d been spanking Sherlock with when his darkest thoughts started boiling up, violently breaking the surface of his consciousness so he couldn’t ignore them, couldn’t force them back down. He patted the palm of his hand repeatedly with the smooth, wooden back of the brush, and closed his eyes. After a moment collecting himself, John decided to be unafraid, to let Sherlock do him the kindness of accepting some of his burden. Then he went upstairs.
“Lovely,” John murmured, and leaned to press a kiss in the crease of hip and thigh, just a light kiss, chaste except for where it was placed. He leaned up on his elbow, propping his head in his hand, and let the other hand stroke down the length of Sherlock’s thigh once more, slowly, then up along the back so that his palm and fingertips slid up over the curve of one buttock, then down again. Sherlock hummed.
“Oh, my darling, precious boy,” Daddy coos, and he slides his fingertips over the hot skin of Locky’s beaten bottom. “You are so good for your daddy, Locky, sweetheart. Do you know how good you make me feel?”
“That’s a good idea, actually. If not right away, then next time.” John took a long breath and checked in with himself. “So. . .what does this look like?”
“I love you so much, sweetheart. So very much. All I want to do is make you feel good and keep you safe. You know you’re a good boy, don’t you? You know you’re not dirty.”
. . .He’d cried, and even though John had elicited tears from Sherlock in the past, by spanking or otherwise punishing him, it had felt very different, probably because John had not comforted him afterward, hadn’t dried the tears or reassured Sherlock that he was loved. In the aftermath, Sherlock had assured John more than once that he’d wept from empathy for John as a child in a similar situation—though not of adults playing defined roles in a safe space, but  rather real and terrifying and awful—and John believed him. But even still. When Sherlock played his boy role, he was always utterly safe in John’s care (even when they played rough, even when John punished him); to have seen his sweet boy crying, frightened, truly sad. . .well, it just wasn’t on. It felt
Sherlock was whining, high and needy, and John relished the way Sherlock surrendered his need, surrendered all self-consciousness, all shame, trusted John, sank so easily and willingly into the pleasure John was more than willing to provide. More than merely willing, John was
“No, of course not,” Sherlock said. “That’s common with abused children. The brain will do whatever it can to preserve sanity in an insane situation. That’s perfectly normal. Your reactions were normal.”
.” It was true. He’d always had age-appropriate attractions, and if anything, his having been victimized had only made him fiercely protective of children. He was full of righteous anger, hyper-vigilant.
John’s throat thickened with gratitude. He nodded and got up from his chair, feeling so much heavier than usual, and opened his arms. Sherlock moved into John’s space, pressed close and wrapped his sinewy, forever-long arms tight around John’s back, kissed his temple. After a few long, pregnant moments in which neither of them spoke, only held on, they broke apart. This time both of them sat, though Sherlock winced a bit as his backside met the seat of the chair.
“I’m gonna come on you now, fuck boy,” John growled against Sherlock’s neck, breath hot against his flexing jaw. “I don’t want to be sick, now, do I?” He rocked forward hard, then back. “I don’t want to be sick,” he muttered, and his orgasm shook him, but he kept thrusting through it, “I don’t want to be sick.” His cum jetted hot over his fingers, painting Sherlock’s hole, “I don’t. . .” he choked. “I don’t want to be
Sherlock drew back, smiled gently, and said, “I know. I’ll see you upstairs in a few minutes.” He seemed reluctant to leave John behind, and his fingertips were the last to go, breaking contact with John’s only when there was nothing else for it but to let go. After a quick detour into their bedroom, Sherlock took the steps two at a time, and John heard the door click nearly-shut.
“Anything,” John replied, then tilted his chin up as Sherlock’s lips found his again, and they sucked and tugged at each other, and Sherlock pressed his tongue inside his daddy’s mouth boldly, and whined a bit, but it wasn’t an unhappy whine. John’s hand had come to rest in the center of Sherlock’s abdomen, just below the level of his heart.
Sherlock’s voice was barely a whisper. He moved to snuggle up closer against John’s chest and his head dropped, nuzzling his face into John’s shirtfront. After a moment, his whole body shuddered and he sniffled.
Sherlock’s teeth crunched down on the candy then, and he started to reach for another even as he chewed the remainder of the first.
“Yes. Then after. . .” Locky gets very shy and his thumb finds its way to his mouth, just a bit, just at the corner.
John was already beginning to calm; the worst of his weeping already passing away, his shuddering had stopped though now he was shivering a bit—he might have been cold—and the hideous, dark feeling that had filled him like pollution and made him want to run away from himself was evaporating up and out of him. He was left feeling hollowed out and sorry.
“Daddy, I want your big cock in me,” he complains, and starts to press himself up off his daddy’s chest. “Now,” he adds.
“That’s right. That’s the proper word. Most boys your age still use kid words. What did you call it when you were littler?”
John spit into his palm, gave himself a few long, slow, tight strokes, gathering pre-cum on the way back. His voice was hollow with breath. “See that? Is that how you do it?”
“Clever you,” John told him, and ducked to feed his tongue to the circling thumb, leaving behind plenty of saliva. Sherlock sucked a loud breath and his hips jutted up hard once before settling back into gentler rocking. John moved to settle against Sherlock’s chest at the near side, licked his lips, and closed them around the tiny, hard bead of the nipple. Sherlock’s whole torso thrummed, his back bowing up to meet John’s kiss.
John was on the verge, could barely keep himself coming, but there was so much more he wanted to do. He drew back, pulled out, and rose to his full height. Sherlock turned his head, muffling the sound of gagging by burying his face in the pillow.
“You’re such a fine-looking boy. So handsome. . .” John’s fingers slipped down between Sherlock’s collarbones, over the worn-thin fabric of the old t-shirt he wore, and he dragged a flat hand across Sherlock’s chest. “Oh, what’s this?” he grinned, and licked his lips, going back for another pass over Sherlock’s hardened nipple. “You really
“Don’t be shy now, you’re doing fine,” John reassured, though his tone was anything but comforting. “When you’re stroking it—stroking your cock—do you do it all the way to the finish?”
“Is your little prick hard?” John demanded, and before Sherlock could answer, John was reaching down to take him in hand. “Oh, that’s gorgeous,” John gruffed, tugging roughly down the length of Sherlock’s erection. “You love sucking a big cock. You did it so well. Next time I’ll come right down your throat, will I?”
Daddy smacks him again, three hard spanks all in the same place, and Locky cries out at the shock of pain, and his willy comes out from between Daddy’s lips for a second. Daddy licks him with a swirling tongue, moaning and humming as if Locky is just the yummiest thing, and now that Locky’s found his tongue and lips again, he fucks down fast into Daddy’s mouth because he feels so hot, so hot, and he wants it all to come out, right into his daddy’s hot mouth, right all over his face and chin, all sticking in his scratchy whiskers. . .
John moved his hand in a gentle, lazy meandering swirl across and over Sherlock’s bottom, just caressing, and after quickly licking his palm, he wrapped the other hand around the base of Sherlock’s cock and steadied it, then placed a trail of open-mouthed kisses down one side until he reached the circle of his fingers, skipped over them to nuzzle the tip of his nose into the patch of wiry hair—surprisingly, delightfully, more coppery-auburn than the hair on his head—and took in the smell of him: clean from the bath faintly scented with sandalwood soap; and the rising, deepening scent of his desire, low and hot.
“I love your precious kisses,” Daddy tells him, and his fingers are grippy again, near the middle of Locky’s bum, and when he squeezes Locky feels a tight pulling in his most private place, and Locky makes a little whiney sound behind his nose, then everything  goes soft again as Daddy lets go of his bottom and moves to touch a new spot. “Big boy, kissing Daddy with your tongue.”
“Goggie the doggy?” John sought confirmation, and Sherlock nodded, then held Goggie up beside his face and nuzzled his cheek and nose against it, turning to inhale.
“So what are we about, then?” John asked, quiet, smiling. Sherlock patted the bed beside his own hip, and John sat beside him, leaning down to plant a kiss on his bare shoulder. “Tell Daddy what you want, sweetheart.”
John let out a low groan through closed lips. “Which of those is dirtiest, do you think?” He tugged Sherlock’s hair again, slow and long, in a different spot. “Which one feels dirtiest in your mouth?”
“If you say stop, we stop, and we don’t worry about me. If it’s too much for you, it’s too much. I’ve lived with it this long, but you’ve never had to.”
Daddy makes a big groan at this and grabs his bum and shakes it like he can tear off a chunk to take away and keep. Locky squirms because it hurts and feels good all at once. His willy is hard and very drippy and he wants to rub it up against Daddy’s big cock, or feel Daddy’s hand or mouth on it, anything at all.
Stopping by the door, he found it was open just a crack, and the room was dark. He listened, and within a moment heard a gusty grunt, muffled by the pillow, then a sucking breath. A beat or two of silence, and another needy noise—
Sherlock made a loud whine of distress, tried to pull his face away, tried to shut his lips. John drew back, whispered, “Oh, hush now, you dirty boy. I know you like that. Your mouth was
“Probably quite a lot, actually,” John admitted, and planted a kiss in Sherlock’s waves of dark hair, there at this temple. “We’ll have a wonderful time together.” He straightened up and his voice went back to normal, then, as he patted his pockets checking for wallet and keys. “Sounds all right?”
,” Sherlock hummed, and grinned his soft sweet grin, looking up under his eyelashes as he moved into John’s embrace. John held him close, and kissed his cheek.
There was a story that caught his eye, about the Pope having made the first public apology to victims of childhood sexual abuse by priests, and he only read the first two paragraphs before he drifted into memory, not of his own abuse by the father of a boyhood friend (the mother saw John was a bit neglected because of his parents’ drinking and made a big fuss over him, though in the end his overnights in their home had cost him a great deal more than he’d gained; at least no one at home shoved his cock in John’s mouth when he was only nine years old) but of the scene he and Sherlock had roleplayed, which had set John’s gut roiling black and hot as tar, coating his insides with a slimy, poisonous ooze he worried might never fully wash away.
Having completed another crossways journey with his hand on Sherlock’s chest, he swept his palm back again to the start, then skidded downward, and petted him slowly across and back, across and back, over his belly, softly rising and falling in time with his breath. “So sweet,” John crooned to him. “You’re the most perfect boy.”
Locky feels the tips of his daddy’s fingers right against him, pressing and prodding at his most private place, and already he starts to think,
“Needy little thing,” Daddy says, and even though it sounds nice the way he says it, that is not an answer. Daddy holds him up a bit. “Stay,” he says, and then he starts rocking hard up into Locky’s bottom, and Locky’s legs start to shake, and his tummy muscles are burning from holding himself that way, but he does it because his daddy said so.
“All right if I get undressed, too?” John asked, and Sherlock hummed his assent, so John quickly shed all but his boxers and vest. Standing by the foot of the bed, he lay one hand on Sherlock’s ankle. “Warm enough? Can I cover you up so you’re nice and snuggly warm?”
John huffed a quick little laugh at this. “Feels silly, now, doesn’t? You, such a big boy, even saying a word like that.”
John thought a minute; Sherlock waited patiently. The only sound was the skin of Sherlock’s thumb scraping vaguely against the back of John’s wrist as he stroked it back and forth, soothing, encouraging. Sherlock had stumbled straight onto the perfect phrase, that he loved all of John. John frequently lingered over the idea that he loved and wanted Sherlock in every way—stroppy, fidgety, stonily silent, publicly brilliant and made entirely of angles and edges, privately soft and needy and sweetly adoring. He would do this very same thing for Sherlock, if the tables were turned, he knew, in a heartbeat—John would take any scabby, horrid part of Sherlock’s heart and tuck into his own just to give Sherlock some relief. He could trust that Sherlock wasn’t just talking; he meant to do just that for John. And it really might help.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “I love him. Ned won’t mind; he’s always wanted company in the back of the wardrobe.”
“No toys,” Locky says, and he unwinds himself to lie on his side, and Daddy turns to face him. “I meant, no toys please. No thank you.”
“I don’t want to,” Sherlock whispered, looking nervously down at John’s hand as he slowly pulled his prick, slick with his spit and sticky with Sherlock’s cum.
Sherlock’s face lit up and he rearranged himself a bit, squaring their bodies to each other. John tipped his face, and their mouths came together, soft and just wet enough, and there was a clicking sound as they released each other, but John went back for more, and Sherlock opened his mouth—trusting, inviting—and John dipped his tongue in to taste the coating of sugary imitation strawberry sweetness in Sherlock’s mouth. They both hummed a bit, enjoying each other’s lips and tongues, until John drew back, smiling.
Sherlock whimpered. John let out a derisive, grunting laugh, released Sherlock from his grip and patted his naked hip.
“You’ve been hard a long time now,” John said, reverting to a more or less normal tone of voice, instructive rather than predatory. “We should make sure you get to finish off soon; don’t want you to be sick.”
“I think I know,” John replied, saving his boy the embarrassment. “Would you like Daddy to use his mouth on your prick, sweetheart? Would you like me to kiss and lick you there?”
“At that age, I was just starting to recognize my attraction to other boys. And because it was new to me, and he was male, I think it got tangled up in my head somehow. . .like that I shouldn’t feel frightened or ashamed, because if I wanted boys—men—but
. . .” a delicious, low hum from his darling boy, then an open-mouthed moan as John stopped sucking to circle his tongue around again, flick bittersweet fluid from the slit with the tip of his tongue. “
“Can I go asleep?” Sherlock whispered. His eyes were closed, and every muscle was soft with satisfied exhaustion.
,” Sherlock half-answered. “Can’t sleep.” All the edge had gone out of his voice, and he lisped a little around the “s”.
Sherlock rolled his head on the pillow, looked up at John with an expression halfway between curious and horrified.
He circled both of Sherlock’s nipples, then—one with this thumb and one with his tongue—slowly at first, but gradually increasing the pace. Sherlock bit down hard on his strawberry sweetie and John heard it crack apart, and applied more pressure with thumb and tongue, and hummed encouragement. Sherlock crunched the rest of the candy, then swallowed noisily. His hand landed on the back of John’s head, and the other caught his forearm, wrapping around his wrist and squeezing urgently. He whined out loud, a needy, high sound from the top of his throat, and John could sense that his hips were rocking up harder now.
you.” John shuddered, felt flayed open and oozing; it was repulsive, and yet, there it was, that ugly urge—inside
. .” Daddy gives Locky’s burning-hot bottom a rapid-fire flurry of smacks, loud and heavy, and Locky’s willy goes so thick and hard, and he jizzes over his Daddy’s tongue and lips, moaning and whining and with his arms getting weak and wobbly beneath him. When Locky feels the hot waves draining away, he slumps heavily onto his side on the bed, and he finds his thumb even though he’s breathing so hard he can’t really close his mouth around it to suck.
As soon as John released his wrist, Sherlock jammed his hand under the covers at his side. John shoved Sherlock’s t-shirt up high under his armpits to see more of his smooth chest, dragged his hand across and around, then ducked his head to close his mouth around Sherlock’s nipple, wet lips sealing an O, tongue lapping hard, up and up and up, until he felt the tightening of the furled flesh. He sucked hard, thinking of the mark he could leave in a perfect, purple circle around Sherlock’s little nipple, how sore it would be in the morning—for days to come—a reminder of him for Sherlock to keep. Sherlock wriggled and shifted beneath him, and John caught both his wrists easily, pinned him flat on his back against the mattress with his forearms against Sherlock’s biceps. He sucked and sucked, drawing up so hard he felt the flesh of Sherlock’s nipple shift from tight and wrinkly to soft and swollen against his tongue.
“Oh, Daddy! This is the best present ever!” Sherlock exclaimed, and his face was bright and wide-open. The present was a floppy-limbed cuddly toy in the shape of a dog, with lovely soft red-brown fur, and a smile sewn with black thread. Its plastic eyes were several shades of bronze and copper, and it had a dark green, woven-canvas collar around its neck, dangling a silvery round tag. Sherlock buried his face in its belly, holding it by the front legs, which he pressed against his cheeks. He hummed his delight into the soft fur.
Sherlock took a quick visual inventory of his experiment; John saw his eyes darting, could almost hear the gears ratcheting in his head.
“Oh, just perfect,” John assured him, and stroked his thigh, let his hand rest there above Sherlock’s knee. “Can we tug down your jim-jams so I can make you feel good, sweet boy? Only if you want to.”
