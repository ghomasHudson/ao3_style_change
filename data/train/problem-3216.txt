Dean could have thunked himself in the head for not figuring it out sooner. Of course, Cas hadn’t just changed his mind about Dean, if he’d been possessed, they were lucky he didn’t have his psychotic break earlier. He remembered the hat he had in his pocket, the last remaining bit of Oswald, and likely the only thing tethering Oswald to this plane… and to Cas.
Oswald shrieked and Cas’s face pulled into a strange and pained expression. Dean reached out and gripped the collar of Cas’s shirt, pulling him back over the catwalk and grabbing the hat before Oswald could work out what was happening. He chanted louder. The spirit choked again, and flailed in Dean’s grip, Cas’s long fingers closing around nothing but air. He stuffed the hat back in his pocket, safe from any wily spirits trying to take it again.
"Suit yourself." Dean said, propping his foot up on the desk. Cas thought as far as feet went, Dean had pretty nice ones. Dean flexed his toes, making Cas chuckle. He grabbed Dean's foot and glanced back at his book.
“Right,” Dean said quickly. “So it’s not a big deal.” He turned, towel slung around his hips and stepped out of the bathroom into the bedroom. He crossed to the dresser and pulled open a drawer, fishing out sweatpants and t-shirts for the both of them. He handed both of these, along with some clean boxers, to Castiel, keeping his back turned through this interaction. He stepped into the boxers, and quickly pulled the sweats and t-shirt on, shielding himself from view and from the tension Castiel felt creeping around.
Dean huffed for a solid thirty seconds. “Fine,” Dean always did break down too easily. “But only for the boring stuff, and you’re staying out of me way after that,
When Dean opened his mouth a few times, without words coming out, Castiel reached out and took his hand. He smiled reassuringly when Dean looked up. Dean took a breath. “When you told me you were a virgin… that no one had ever had their hands on you, I was kinda…” He looked like he was searching for the right word. “…taken aback, I guess. You’re a good looking guy and I thought maybe you were just lying to reel me in. But…” Dean shook his head and huffed. “The way you responded to me that first time—in my living room, you remember?”
“Why didn’t you give it to me that day then? Why stick it in the glove box where I wasn’t going to find it?”
Trevor responded immediately, hands coming to Castiel’s waist. He didn’t press too quickly—ever the respectful gentleman—but made a grunt of approval when Castiel pulled him closer. He opened his mouth under Castiel’s ministrations, tasting faintly of the beer he’d been drinking. After a moment, they broke apart.
“What the fuck? You’re gonna say that to me right now?” Cas threw the book to the side and stood. He started advancing on Dean. “You know what the fuck, Dean. Don’t play dumb.”
He saw a flash of a pretty female face with wispy brown hair behind his eyelids, and he felt all the air leave the room.
“I didn’t invite you.” Castiel saw no need to mince words. He took a sick sort of satisfaction when Balthazar’s face dropped minutely.
"Better than a questionable hickey. Besides, it’ll wash off.” Cas said, diligently keeping his head down so his voice wouldn't shake. He reached up and grabbed a black marker off his desk. He pulled the cap off with his teeth. He marked each of Dean's toes with their proper name, making Dean twitch.
Dean nodded cordially. “Oh, we’re considering a few places, few small towns like this. Seems like a good place to start a franchise, you know? How long have you lived here?”
An hour in, Dean really had no idea what was happening in this show. The kids weren’t very animated on their lines, and had a tendency to stand completely still when they weren’t actively talking, so Dean’s grip on the story and conflict was tenuous at best. The parents on either side of him seemed to be about as engaged as he was, though. One father had be prodded awake every so often by his grumpy looking wife, and by the expression of the other couple, they were regretting allowing their child to be part of this production. He couldn’t say he was paying the best attention to the show, though. He kept his eyes out for Cas, scanned the audience and the wings, but it was too dark to see much. He tried to remember where Cas said he’d be standing, but that was a while ago, before their fight. It hadn’t seemed important at the time.
Even with little to no traffic on the streets of Central City, it felt like the trip down the road—ten minute commute, Cas had told him—took three times longer than it should. He parked haphazardly by a beat up blue pickup when he finally got to the school grounds and dashed inside. He also had his sawed-off in hand, but tucked safely into his jacket. He definitely couldn’t go running into a full auditorium with a gun.
Castiel sighed and came to stand on the other side of the island, giving Dean all the space he could. “I wasn’t planning on it, no.” He leaned his elbows against the counter. “Do you want to be yelled at?”
It really was. The bedroom was as simple as the hallway. The bedding was plain white and the bed frame and headboard were black. The entire west wall was made of glass, leading out onto a small balcony, and into that picturesque view. Black and white prints hung on the walls, far enough apart to look like a gallery. A door stood partially ajar against another wall that led to what Castiel assumed was a bathroom, as a large wardrobe served as a closet.
Castiel snatched his hand back. He was angry and confused, and more than a little frustrated with how cryptic Dean was being. “Why do you keep trying? It was a business transaction, we knew that. A contract.”
They had their reservation—Winchester for two—and were shown a table near the back. Photographers were everywhere, snapping pictures of the guests, the staff, the food, anything they could bring back to their editors to prove they’d been to the hottest opening in town. The maitre’d looked haggard by seven pm. Their server was friendly, though clearly ready for a break that wouldn't come anytime soon. The food was excellent. Castiel didn’t think twice when Dean leaned across the table and planted a kiss on his lips before taking another bite.
“Fuck—!” Dean could only watch in horror as the ladder jilted and fell to the stage below with Cas still on it. He gripped the side of the catwalk as it swung back and forth. He chanced a glance down just as Cas hit the ground with a sickening crunch. It was only about six or seven feet from the stage, but enough that Dean could hear Cas groan. Dean forced himself to look away. Now that the spirit was safely out of Cas, he could burn this fucker out of existence. He searched in his pocket for his lighter. He pulled the Zippo and the bowler hat—squashed beyond recognition now—from his jacket and held them up like deliverance.
What most people also don’t know about Dean Winchester is that he genuinely enjoyed his earlier days of his company more than his current ones. Sure, it sounds a little strange, who wouldn’t love the power, the prestige, the fine clothes, everything that comes with being one of the richest men in the bustling city of Chicago at the relatively tender age of 30? But the truth is that he misses the days when he and his secretary, Charlie, were operating their business out of a washed out storefront on the south side of the city. Most people wouldn’t even have believed that man, the one who had given up his parents’ fortune, made in the arms industry, to start this company with only his two hands (four including Charlie’s) and the $15,000 he’d saved from his own accounts since leaving college.
They came down slowly, sliding together like liquid and melting in a messy pile on the chair. It creaked and settled, protesting the weight of two grown men carelessly frotting each other, but held as they sat back. Dean stroked his fingers up and down Castiel’s spine, his touch whisper soft after the hectic pace they’d set earlier. They stayed there as their skin cooled and turned sticky. They stayed there and listened to the door down many hallways opened and closed repeatedly as guests entered the house and had loud conversations with each other amongst the colorful walls of artwork.
Sam calls at least once a week, sometimes leaving a message, sometimes not. Each time, he asks Dean to call him back, just to see how he’s doing. He doesn’t know much of the specifics, but he knows his older brother is hurting and it has everything to do with the frankly ridiculous news story that held the media’s attention for a few days before the local government caused another uproar. Sam is lucky enough to drag Dean out to dinner once or twice a month. They mostly go the Roadhouse, letting Ellen fuss over them for a while. Dean still doesn’t say much. Not to anyone. Sam tries not to take it personally.
Castiel held his hand out like a Boy Scout, which was the most ironic thing, maybe in the history of the world, “I promise, Dean. Honest.”
“It’s not messing around if I fully intend to take care of you.” Dean said, a patient expression on his face. “But I also don't want you to feel pressured into doing this if you don't want to. It’s very important that you’re able to choose this of your own free will.” He leaned forward, assessing Castiel with his eyes.
“Cas! Thank God you called. Are you okay?" At the sound of her voice, Castiel found himself heaving for air. The familiarity was too much. He remembered when he’d come home from school after a bad day, and try to hold things together in the kitchen while he putzed around, waiting to be excused upstairs to his room. Everything would crash and burn when his mother would ask in her concerned tone, ‘what’s wrong?’ He hated that it was a similar effect with his best friend.
“Nah,” Dean waved his hand. “Just askin’.” He immediately drained his glass and cursed that the waitress was too far away to immediately ask for another.
Castiel thrust upwards into where Dean’s body was slung across his. “I want to see you. Please, can we take the blindfold off? I have to see your face.”
Castiel yawned. “So where have you been all evening? You weren’t home when I left.” Castiel and Anna shared a dingy studio apartment. Usually the two were able to keep constant tabs on each other, for safety reasons, but their schedules sometimes lured them out from the other’s watch.
. He had a whole auto steel enterprise that he’d inherited from his father and then built up to encompass half of America’s GDP. He was practically royalty in the business world. Even Dean knew that.
Castiel could hear her frown over the phone. “'A course I came to get you, stupid. You’re my best friend.” Silence then. “Do you think you’re going to come home?”
Cas looked up. He smirked, making Dean frown harder. “She is pretty. Melody was one of the first people I met when I moved here.”
Cas continued to advance, pointing a finger at his chest now. “You still don’t know what the problem is? Let’s count, shall we? You blow into town, injure my boss, make me lose my job, and then act like
on the back of the chair, and he would have tipped the whole thing over backwards if Dean hadn’t caught his ankle and yanked him back down, his head going with the motion enough so as to not gag himself. Castiel was pretty sure he was already seeing stars, but the way Dean started sucking nearly made the galaxies behind his eyelids explode in a new Creation. Universes were born, stars burst into life, only to be sucked back into death just as quickly. Castiel keened under the attention, pressed his thighs to the solid weight of Dean between them. He kept a hand pressed at Dean’s shoulder, either to urge him on or slow him down, he didn’t know.
Kevin squinted at the picture for a second before his eyes went wide. “I swung at him when I felt like I was falling, and that’s when he flickered out. His face—it looked like that.” He jammed his finger at the picture. “Older, maybe. Or… fuzzier? I dunno. But that was him. He had a weird hat though.”
As soon as the door closed behind the man, Dean hit the lights for the main stage, plunging the theater into near pitch blackness. He took his flashlight and started towards the wings, where the papers had reported the strange figure the student saw.
Castiel pursed his lips. He thought after everything, he might consider Dean a friend at least. “No, Dean and I met… not that long ago.” Truly, he hadn’t even intended to be in the same part of the house when Gabriel showed up. He just… appeared.
Dean finally got a grip on him, and pinned him to a wall near the stage with an arm over Cas’s chest. “Hey, gonna have to ask you leave my friend.”
Dean grinned. “Sammy-boy’s a lawyer and everything. Won’t shut up about it.” Dean’s expression told Castiel that maybe it wasn't Sam that bragged about it to everyone.
He chanced it by hanging a right towards the storage room, emboldened when he heard a rustling sound behind it. He pushed and it didn’t budge, but like it was being held closed by something. Dean prayed Cas wasn’t trying to hold the door shut with his own body weight, and threw his shoulder into the door, shoving it open. A stack of boxes crashed to the floor, evident of someone pushing them together in lieu of a proper barricade.
“Right, don’t wanna... I don’t want to give you the wrong idea or anything.” Always better to go with blasé disaffection.
They had spent the rest of the day packing the rest of Cas’s belongings that he didn’t want to keep into neatly labelled boxes, to be taken down the street to the thrift shop later. All that was left in Cas’s apartment was the big furniture he would leave for the next renter, including the sofa that Dean still found his eyes drawn to now and then. In such a short time, this whole apartment really had had its influence on Dean’s life and understanding of his own wants and desires. It felt bittersweet to leave it all behind, even if he was taking the most important feature of the apartment with him. For good, if he had anything to say about it.
The pair at the table snorted and turned back to their conversation as Andy geared up for the tale, clearly thrilled to have someone listen to him. “That hotel has been rumored to house the spirit of not one, but
“Would it help to go over the facts again? Review what we know?” Cas asked when they were safely in the parking lot on the south side. A few kids were on the playground outside. A glance at the clock told them it was after lunchtime; surely more kids would be out soon.
“But something changed,” Winchester—Dean finished. “I know, believe me. It was only a job for maybe twenty minutes. An hour tops. I knew he was different right away.”
- she and Jo are having the time of their lives in small-town Kansas. They’re well on their way to graduation and have tentative plans to buy out the studio with Trevor.
“Fuck, Cas. Do whatever you want. I don’t even fucking care anymore, just touch me.” Cas chuckled and sucked a kiss to Dean’s hip. He didn’t know what had gotten into him, but he didn’t care. This was obviously doing it for Dean and watching him unravel was getting dangerously addicting.
Dean swung around so he was facing Castiel again. Cas snorted. “You don’t have to do that, you know.”
Castiel could feel his own cock jump at the permission. He quickly scooted down, throwing aside the blanket that Dean still had tucked up around him. He was bare underneath. Dean’s cock was already half-hard, and it was easily convinced to get to full mast very quickly as Castiel slipped his tongue in a dirty circle around the tip of his cock. Dean gasped, fingers tightening once before letting go deliberately.
Castiel added it under his “Interested” column. He cleared his throat and addressed the next item on the list.
The tiny smile threatening to cross Dean’s face told Sam that he wasn’t nearly as pissed as he pretended to be. The two brothers hadn’t seen each other in a few weeks, between Sam’s court schedule and Dean’s apparent new… hobby.
Dean dropped the rag he was holding on the side of the car, the grease smearing on the shiny red paint. Not that he paid it any mind. “Are you trying to get me into your pants, Cas?” He advanced, backing Castiel up to the gray sectional sofa behind them, attached to a small kitchenette with a fridge and sink. When Castiel’s knees hit the sofa, he sank down, brushing catalogs for car parts out of the way. Dean clambered up with him, knees settling on either side of his lap.
Dean only just managed to snag the folder from Castiel’s hands and slip it inside his jacket alongside the other one before the office door opened and the two of them sprang apart.
While sitting in his seat on the now-moving subway, Castiel pulled up his ongoing chat with Dean. He attached the picture from Vegas.
“Don’t want to be seen with me in public?” Castiel knew that was a low blow, especially after all this time and the detached persona he was going for.
“This isn’t fair.” Dean’s voice was several octaves higher than usual. His fingers were twisted in the comforter. Castiel walked his fingers up Dean’s arms, chuckling when the muscles jumped. He traced up to Dean’s collarbone, and up the column of his throat, ticking over the contours of his lovely face.
"Kinky." If possible, Cas felt himself blush harder. Dean got up and dropped to the floor. He stretched out like a giant cat. Cas found himself staring and his mouth ran a little dry.
“You mean he didn’t think you were a janitor?” Cas glanced at him, and raised his eyebrow, teasing him. Now that they weren’t dead or dying, maybe Dean could convince him to have a drink. The bars were likely still open, and Dean was desperate to see what kind of drunk Castiel was. They could torch the body, scatter the ashes, and probably still make last call.
Dean did as he was told, and when the catwalk was on level with the stage, there was nothing spooky about the metal beam. Dean ran his reader over the pipes, and nodded to himself as it lit up.
“I—wow.” Cas smiled and nodded. Wow, indeed. Cas glanced at the clock sitting on his desk and cursed to himself. Much as he’d like to lay here all night with Dean, perhaps in a bed though, he still had a test in the morning. He sighed and made to get up.
Castiel bid her farewell, and pocketed his phone. Scrounging through his pockets, he pulled out three dollars in change and bills. He glanced over at the glove compartment. Curiosity got the better of him and he leaned over to pop the latch. Inside was a number of items: a sealed envelope, a stack of hundreds bundled together, a flashlight, a new tire pressure gauge with instruction manual, and two packages of HotHands. All were items one might need if they were leaving on a long road trip to places unknown.
Dean’s rhythm started slow, “Can’t get you all worked up for nothing, right?” he said. He pulled all the way out, and started his process of splitting Castiel open all over again. All through it, Castiel keened and whined, begging him to go faster. Dean kept himself carefully distanced that his thighs never hit Castiel’s ass, but at this point, Castiel was pleased to take what he could get. And what a getting it was.
“Should I be worried?” A frantic knocking on the door rattled the hinges slightly. Dean glanced between the doorknob and Castiel like he actually wanted an answer. His tousled appearance made him a bit better fitting into the makeshift shelter the apartment had turned into, but his face still made Castiel wish for better lighting and softer linens.
“Oh, I loved the spring collection last year—or was it two years…” she stopped babbling. “I’m so sorry, I’ll get you that menu.”
Castiel pushed past the both of them into the living room. He tugged Anna’s arm until she followed him to the couch where he sat down, pulling her with him. Winchester sat a reasonably safe distance away from the pair on one of the armchairs. Anna kept her eyes on the familiar stranger in her apartment the whole time.
Dean slapped him on the back and sent him into the kitchen, where Castiel heard him greet Missouri with raucous affection. Missouri returned in kind. Dean turned to Castiel. “I forgot he was coming over today. You good doing your own thing, or do you want me to drive you home for a bit? It won’t take long.”
Dean froze. “No. Course not.” He pasted a smile on his face that Castiel could see through even in the dim light. “It’s late, and… yeah. I get it. You’re tired and-and… yeah, we can talk tomorrow or…? Some other time?”
He was still panting when he fell back against the bed, his hair plastered to his forehead with sweat. Dean ripped off the fingertip vibrator and let it hit the wall before he surged up again to slot their mouths together. Castiel was still restrained in the arms, so he couldn't scoop himself closer to Dean the way he so desperately wanted. Dean sprawled across him, running his hands over every inch of exposed skin.
“Did you always want to hunt monsters?” Dean could feel Castiel looking at him fully now, ignoring his book. He tilted his head and peered at Dean through his dorky black-framed Buddy Holly glasses like he really cared what Dean wanted to be when he grew up.
Cas hoisted himself up a more comfortable sitting position, only wincing slightly as stitches were pulled here and there. “I know you don’t feel the same, but I really enjoyed our time together, and I don’t want you to leave thinking that I don’t—appreciate what you did for me and the school.”
Dean clapped him on the shoulder. “Bet you’re glad I didn’t get too far away, huh?” He chuckled at Novak’s glare and took the opportunity to pull out his EMF reader. The pings it sent out were far more subdued this time. The ghost wasn’t gone, but it was hiding for now. Waiting.
Castiel took a sip of his water glass, no alcohol on the job, thanks. Plus, he had to go to his real job in the morning. The bookstore on the other side of the Institute’s campus had a musty sort of feel to it, with an even mustier owner, who did not appreciate any sort of impairment on the job.
Balthazar had set the paper down. “Well, I… certainly hope you can meet the two week deadline, Mr. Novak. We wouldn’t want to bar you from entering this institution.”
“Probably the Romans. Maybe the Greeks. Definitely not the Germans.” Dean laughed and Cas smiled. Dean offered his left hand next like he was showing off a ring.
“You’re my dom, after all. That’s what's in the contract, right? You’re over here playing sexy mechanic and I. Am. Suffering.” He punctuated each word with a direct thrust into the dip of Dean’s spine, causing another full body shudder from the man underneath him. “Push me around or something.”
Castiel turned away from the mirror, stepping in close to Dean’s personal space. He felt comfortable here. Welcome. “Thanks. You look nice too.” He paused for a moment. “What if this doesn’t work? I mean—what if nobody... nobody shows up or even...?”
Sweat was pouring off both of them. Castiel wasn’t convinced they’d have to burn both their suits after this just because of the sheer amount of bodily fluids on them now. They ground against each other, pressing and pulling, fitting their mouths together when they weren’t gasping for air. Castiel kept one hand soldered to Dean’s chest, just where his heart sat, feeling how it pounded and echoed the beat of his own heart, their bodies synced up in every way. They were just grinding, they both knew it. They weren’t trying to move forward, try to move into something that needed two times more room and ten times more prep, but they chased after each other. Castiel felt Dean’s hand creep up between his shoulder blades, hooking him a little more down while the rest of Dean pressed up. He felt utterly safe and possessed here in their private corner of Dean’s bedroom. Castiel pulled Dean’s hand from where it was plastered to his neck and held it in his. He brought it to his lips and kissed each digit, slipping his lips around the middle finger. He delighted in the way the green of Dean’s iris disappeared just a little impossible bit more as his nostrils flared and the arousal kicked up another notch.
“Alright, my place it is. If that’s okay with you? It’s your choice of course.” Castiel nodded furiously. “Let’s roll, Kato.”
He moved and propped up his head on Dean’s chest, taking a liberty he wasn’t quite sure he was allowed. Still, Dean didn’t stop him, and readjusted to make himself more comfortable to lie on. Castiel laid on his folded hands. “Sometimes I wonder.” Castiel smiled to take the heat out of his words, making them into a playful jab. He didn’t want Dean to be mad at him for wanting to hurry.
Dean had a sinking feeling that any time with the man underneath him and wrapped around him still would be pretty memorable, and that it might be a memory he’d soon have to leave in his rear view mirror.
Castiel scrambled out of bed and over to where he had dropped off his pile of clothes last night. His phone sat quietly in his pants pocket, right where he had left it… quietly—because it was dead. Castiel brought the phone back over to the unmade bed and dug in the drawers of the modular side table. This man kept a fully stocked bar in all three of his living rooms, surely he would have thought to stock his guest rooms with the same sense of preparedness?
Cas stood as well and took one last look around to make sure he hadn’t left anything important. Dean took the last box under one arm and followed Cas out, locking the door and sliding the key under the rug for the landlord to find. They were almost out the front of the building when Cas stopped and looked around. “Maybe those books won’t go to the thrift shop.”
Cas shrugged, throwing his keys on a small table to the side of the door. “One of the other teachers lives through that hallway.” Castiel gestured to a door set near the stairs. “She’s pretty nice. The guy across the hall works nights, I think.” He took off his coat and tossed it over the chair by the window. As he carried his stack of papers from Adler’s office to the kitchen table, Dean looked around the space.
“Just havin’ a conversation, is all. So come on, spill the sob story. You’re getting a cheeseburger out of the deal.” Mr. Winchester said, leaning over to steal a fry off Castiel’s plate
From there, it was quick work getting Castiel out of his pants and onto his front on the couch. Dean crouched behind him, one foot on the floor to balance himself, and the other tucked up underneath. He had produced lube from somewhere Castiel couldn't bring himself to care about and was now running his hands over Castiel’s ass. Even in his wildest masturbatory fantasies, he had never gotten so far as to stick a finger or anything up his own ass. Clients sometimes liked to offer to do it to him, but he had never taken them up on it.
Castiel shook himself, pushing himself to his feet to grab his own coat. He left the door propped open just a crack as they left, so he didn’t have to take his keys. Dimly, he wondered when Anna would be back and if he should text her, letting her know that her absence, while appreciated, was no longer necessary. Then again, he could just use the alone time to think.
“That’s not always the case.” Cas went on, working himself up into a full rage. “Do you know what I had to do to get this job? It’s not that easy for me to just walk into a school and get a job.
“Hey, come on. It’s got newspaper articles, obituaries... hell, I’d even take a deed if it’s got a name on it. I gotta start somewhere, and right now I got a fat pile of nothing to go on.” Dean picked up the first book in his own pile of reading and got busy. They were looking for anything relating to the school—how old it was, staff members, anything. The school’s website wasn’t helpful at all, but instead gave Dean an excuse to pull up Castiel’s staff page to tease him for the dumbass quote he had chosen.
Castiel could tell that Dean was getting close, because his thrusts were getting faster and shallower. “Gonna come for me?” He egged Dean on. “Gonna come in your underwear? Yeah, you’re so close, aren’t you? Want me to come with you? Make a mess all over your pretty car?”
“Dean—! I’m gonna—oh, you’re gonna make me—“ Castiel cried, gasping for breath. He pulled back from Dean’s mouth to pant against his throat, using the opportunity to bite along the thin skin there, press his lips to Dean’s Adam’s Apple. He felt more than heard when Dean’s groan answered his actions.
Castiel chuckled humorlessly. The amount of times he was pushed into something he wasn’t quite ready for was far too high for his liking. “For what it’s worth, I really wanted it to work with you and me. You’re… you’re great.”
Her gentle smirk grew into a vicious smile, one that tore down corporations and left other fashion houses in ruin. “To never let anyone get in the way of what makes you happy.” With a final flourish, she turned and left to where a long black limousine must have been waiting for her the entire time just in front of the gates. Castiel watched her speed away, feeling mostly awestruck.
to get down, you can’t stay up here.” Dean pleaded with him. Cas nodded blearily and hoisted himself towards the side using the metal caging on either side of the catwalk. Dean helped him as best as he could, but the crackling static in the air told him the spirit was re-materializing.
“Are you talking to yourself again, Castiel?” Sr. Guerrero said from the desk, quiet voice carrying over the various creaks of the shop, smile evident in his voice.
Dean saw a pile of clothing and props on a table near the door. “Yeah, what kinda show are you doing, anyway? I couldn’t really—uh… tell, during rehearsal.”
Castiel pushed forward, landing his mouth uncomfortably against Dean’s. He tasted like spearmint gum, which Castiel instantly hated the flavor of. He pressed in closer, trying to find the flavor of Dean underneath. Dean’s hands came up to his biceps, holding, but not quite pushing him away. His fingers swept slowly up and down the skin exposed by Castiel’s t-shirt, trying to soothe him. Castiel’s hands grabbed for Dean’s belt, pulling his dress shirt roughly out of where it was tucked. Dean grunted in surprise. Fumbling with the zipper, Castiel got his hand down Dean’s pants, where he found Dean disappointingly soft. Well, not for long. He started stroking gently, how he knew Dean liked. There was a haze forming in Castiel’s mind. He knew he wasn’t doing this right, but he couldn't bring himself to care. He had to have Dean, had to be had by Dean right now. Dean’s hands increased their pressure on his biceps, pushing him away now. He struggled briefly, but Dean was much stronger than he was.
Dean rested his head against Castiel’s stomach and he snickered. Castiel raked his hands through Dean’s hair, making it stand on end. Dean looked up through his lashes, “Deal.”
“I’m going to take a shower.” Cas pulled away suddenly, and Dean blinked back to the reality of lying under Castiel, both of them still naked and touching a million different places.
“It’ll be fine, Cas. Just don’t act suspicious. He doesn’t have anything and he knows it. He probably just wants to scare you.”
Cas pulled back after a second. Dean was sure he looked as shell-shocked as he felt. He waited for Cas to laugh or something, but Cas’s eyes didn’t open. “I’m sorry, I—“
Castiel leaned down and fished around for his clothes. This felt like a Shirts-On™ kind of conversation.
Balthazar had steepled his fingers and smiled pityingly at Castiel over the mahogany desk that was clearly too large for the tiny office encompassing it. “That’s all fine and good, Mr. Novak, but you have a—a history, shall we say, of cutting it rather close to meeting deadlines with the financial aid department.” He leaned back in his oxblood leather office chair. “We’re just concerned that it will be too much for you with this extra coursework.”
“Someone really did miss me.” Dean huffed a laugh, eyeing up the impressive bulge in Castiel’s sweats. He walked his fingers up Castiel’s thighs to the waistband of his pants, stroking softly over the skin. Castiel was positive that even his teeth were sweating with need and anticipation. Achingly slowly, Dean inched the sweats down Castiel’s legs, eyes roving over every inch of exposed skin as it was revealed, as if they had been separated for years, rather than just days. When Dean finally got the sweats down over Castiel’s cock, it popped up rather comically to it’s full standing position. “
. The buzzing under his skin that started in the bedroom was causing his heart to jackhammer against his ribcage and his cheeks to flush crimson. It didn’t seem to die down with his proximity to Cas.
Well that stung. It was like Cas had found that part of Dean’s brain that had been screaming the same thing at him since they’d kissed.
With his phone charger and a few changes of clothes in a bag, Castiel started south towards the subway station. Nicole was her usual grumpy self when he entered her office, but she brightened up considerably when she noticed the name at the top of the check that was handed to her for the full amount of the month’s rent.
The intact rooms were still, dust nearly as thick here as it was downstairs. He tread lightly, so as not to be given away by any loose floorboards. Only one room was locked, easily bypassed with Dean’s picks, but even that room was a disappointment. A brass bedframe stood in the center, with an assortment of old boxes surrounding it. Dean poked through the top box half-interestedly.
“Ready?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded violently. He wanted Dean to get on with it and stop this infuriating teasing. Instead of a vibrating sensation, the wet heat of Dean’s tongue washed over his cock. Castiel whimpered. Dean slicked his tongue over the head and down the side and back up and over. Castiel could feel the bastard smile as he pressed his lips over the sensitive skin.
When they finally made it inside the Roadhouse, Ellen was standing right inside the door, rolled up newspaper in hand. She smacked them both—“Ellen, what the
He’d been there for three years already, though. Most of the people in his program when he’d started had graduated already, able to pay for the intensive schedule the Institute required.
Dean reached up to meet him halfway, but Castiel kept his mouth out of reach. “Yeah, yeah—promise. Just, get down here.”
“Gotta stop or this’ll be over before it’s even started.” Dean said, smacking one last kiss on Castiel’s cheek before pulling away. Castiel’s body felt cold without his heat.
He jumped when Dean pushed himself out of the brush to greet him. He dusted the twigs and leaves off his expensive suit as he looked where Castiel was gazing.
Dean put his hands up to stop Cas from babbling. “Dude, I figured it wasn’t you. Not your fault.” He smiled kindly, hoping to reassure the man. The apology was nice, and he didn’t want to leave Cas wallowing in his own guilt, but he really did have to go and the longer he let Cas talk, the harder it would be to walk away.
“Enemy to the arts!” The spirit screamed, hooking a long finger in their direction. It’s form was unclear from this distance, but it was clearly unhappy with their presence. Dean leveled his shotgun and took a shot near the booth. The spirit disappeared, but not before letting the salt round shatter into the glass of the booth, littering the ground below with thousands of shards.
he just wanted to feel Cas’s skin against his again. He leaned in, feeling how Cas’s breath hitched against his lips.
Castiel’s eyes widened almost comically. “A car—! No no no no no, I can’t accept a car. I don’t even have a place to park it at my shitty apartment.”
Sam glanced over at Sarah. This was at least a start to talking through the issue like an adult. “Did you say anything else?” He pitched his voice to be soothing, like he was calming a victim of an accident or a screaming toddler.
After a moment of swearing, Dean got the door open. In the dark, without Cas, the apartment seemed eerie and unnaturally still. Everything looked the same as it had this morning. Papers were still strewn across the dining room table. Two mugs rested in the sink, joined by a new plate Cas must have used for dinner. Dean quickly shut the front door behind him, and drew the blinds before turning on a lamp. The yellow light cast weird shadows over the furniture, throwing everything into unfriendly angles. The hearth in front of the fireplace no longer looked warm and inviting, but instead like a yawning maw, intent on swallowing him. The couch where they had spent that evening drinking and fooling around now seemed foreign and judgmental.
“Just arrived actually. Real looker of a guy, messy dark hair, big blue eyes, you’re a dead ringer for him.” The man gestured for him to sit down.
What most people don’t know about Dean Winchester is that he grew up around art. His mother was an artist. Now, to most four-year olds, anyone with the full 64 pack of Crayola crayons is an artist, but Dean knew his mother was pretty talented, even at such a young age. She specialized in paintings of angels. Big, huge canvases that could cover a wall, done almost entirely in watercolors. Dean’s favorite piece was an angel done entirely in shades of blue. Periwinkle tones for the wings, too floaty for their appearance; a cobalt gown dotted with lighter shades that made the fabric glisten; deep sapphire for the eyes, staring out at the viewer and following them from room to room. Dean remembers how long it took her to get the shading on the wings just right. He spent hours in her studio with her, pretending to be an art critic and telling his mom that her paintings were too pretty for the museum so they had to build her a new building, but that Daddy would build it for her. He remembered feeling scandalized when Mary would “accidentally” drip paint on him, causing her to laugh like a bell ringing while he swiped at his face, grinning up at her. The birth of the blue angel was a monumental experience for Dean to witness. He cheered when Mary announced that she was finally finished, and swooped down to scoop Dean up in her arms, spinning him around the studio. The blue angel seemed as much a part of their family as new baby Sammy, who was, in Dean’s opinion, a bit too small and stinky to really be considered a brother just yet.
“You have a lot of bones in your hips,” Cas whipped Dean’s pants behind himself. “And your legs,” He laid himself somewhat akwardly between Dean’s legs so that his face was level with Dean’s cock. “And basically all over, Dean.” Dean’s eyes seemed to get wider and wider with every passing second. He let his head drop back against the chair.
“Sounds like a crush more than a mark.” Castiel could hear the smile in her voice. Even when she was pissed, she could hassle him.
After a while, Castiel put his phone down and just sat in silence with Anna for a moment. This was his favorite part of their friendship. They never judged each other for doing what they had to, and having that kind of unconditional support was better than any tipping customer.
“And how else am I supposed to get better at giving head?” Dean was panting at the feel of Cas’s hands in his hair by now. He would promise all sorts of things to keep that tingly feeling running over his skin, and the feel of Cas’s breath in his ear.
Something else that people might not know about Dean Winchester, is that it doesn’t matter what kind of punishment people might inflict on him, because he will always be able to hate himself more.
The brothers fell into silence again. Dean turned to the television above the bar, apparently trying to lose himself in the rugby match on the screen. Sam wasn’t sure Dean even knew how rugby was played. “So he’s going to art school?” Sam could be supportive. Clearly this was important to Dean, and he could be a good brother and not make this worse for Dean than he was already making it for himself.
“We always value dedication to the theater, as it is the most noble art there is,” the man said. Dean boggled. If he hadn’t been looking right at him, he wouldn’t have guessed it was Cas in front of him. He looked like Cas, stood like Cas, and from this distance, even gestured a bit like him, but the voice was about three pegs off normal to be him. “It’s hard to find students who are as willing to put in the work as I am, and these kids,” he gestured to the students. “These kids are the
“Oh my god. I don’t fuck the guys I meet. I just blow them.” Just as Castiel said this, the waitress came over to refill Mr. Winchester’s water glass, and flirt with him presumably. She almost knocked the glass over when she placed it back on the table and scurried away without a word. She had definitely heard them.
On his way into town, Dean had stopped at the solitary blue historical marker on the outskirts of the main area. Lone Tree was the name of the local history buff draw, and the statue that stood as a memorial was just
Cas took the book, flipping through it quickly before dumping it in the box on the table marked for give-away. “The kids like being able to spend time with the teachers, too. It’s a rite of passage for them.” He folded the flaps shut and taped up the box with efficiency that Dean absolutely did
The rest of their day was a bit of a blur of hands and lips and heat. When they dragged each other out of the shower, they’d made breakfast, practically hanging off each other in the kitchen. Then they’d taken a trip to the grocery store next door, Cas citing a desperate need for food besides toast and eggs. Cas had kept touching him throughout the trip—grabbing his sleeve for his attention, nudging him this way and that—until Dean gave up and held Cas’s dumb hand like he had wanted to all along. He definitely didn’t do this with one night stands, even less frequently did this with friends-with-benefits, but it felt nice. The fact that it would be over the minute he left town also had Dean wanting to treat this like it was special. He dutifully ignored the glances of the townspeople, Cas’s neighbors, as they picked their way through the store. He was happy for a while, and he wanted to keep it greedily for himself.
“Castiel, are you sure you’re okay? You were off when you got home and now you’re going out again?” Anna clung to his arm on the platform, almost trying to keep him from getting on the train.
“I’ll stay.” Cas whispered. Dean’s face broke into a huge grin. He reached over and clicked off the desk lamp and settled down with Cas against his chest. Dean’s breath ghosted over his forehead.
Castiel stopped, his hand on the doorknob, unsure of what he just heard. How on earth could Dean ever think that he was something Dean didn’t deserve? He knew he played that card all the time, trying to make his time seem worth the price to Dean, but he knew. He wasn’t anything special. And Dean was so special. So special that the words Dean was saying didn’t even make sense.
“Will I see you tomorrow?” Cas asked, squeezing Dean’s hand tightly. “Are you gonna sneak away while I’m out?” He sounded suspicious, like he didn’t fully trust Dean to stay.
“You ain’t goin’ anywhere until you’re screaming my name, sweetheart. We’re nowhere near finished.” He said, pinning Cas in place with a devastating smirk. Cas froze, and felt his cock twitch against Dean’s thigh. He was still fully clothed, but his pants were still uncomfortable tight. He was pressed all the way to the floor by Dean’s strong hands. Dean palmed Cas’s chest and ducked to push Cas’s shirt up his torso. He pressed kisses around Cas’s navel, breathing hotly against his skin and Cas was torn between laughing at the ticklish sensations or combusting because of the heat that was rushing to his groin. Dean kissed right to the edge of Cas’s pants and then he pulled the pants down Cas’s legs, boxers close behind. Cas felt Dean’s breath on his cock and moaned when the flat of Dean’s tongue replaced it. He couldn’t bear to look at Dean. If he did, this would all be over far too soon and Cas wanted this for as long as possible. Maybe forever if he could get away with it. He had to convince Dean to do this again. There was no way they couldn’t, it was too fucking good.
“I know, it’s hard to tell when the guy isn’t outright waving his dick in your face, but yeah.” Anna said, flatly, “Typically, normal people try to strike up normal conversation with the person they’re trying to hit on… in a really normal fashion.”
“Not what I meant. Okay, you know how sugar daddy arrangements work, right? I can pay your tuition, your rent, whatever. Money isn't an issue. In exchange, I just want your company. Hang out with me, maybe go to dinner,” Mr. Winchester smiled. “Buy you stuff, that sort of deal.”
Electives certainly fit the MO Dean was looking for. “You’re talking drama teachers, like Castiel.” He hooked just thumb over his shoulder like he had just come from talking with Castiel, which he kind of had.
Dean struggled to roll over until Castiel got up and helped him. When he was on his back, Castiel settled back above the impressive, but obscene bulge tenting Dean’s jeans. “What do you want me to order you to do?” he asked.
Clucking in sympathy, Anna patted his arm. “He’s pretty, isn’t he? It’s okay, I was a mess around him the first few weeks too. ‘Course, it was different for me, because he wasn’t even batting for my team.”
“Should give ol’ Harvey at Mustard Autos a run for his money then. Sure, let’s chat in the bar.” Kaiser jammed a thumb over his shoulder towards the saloon doors. “Should be plenty empty until after dinner.”
"Come onnnnnn." Dean whined. Cas sighed. If Dean was willing to help, he'd just have to do his best to keep his touches clinical and brief. Or maybe just not ever actually touch him. He pulled his glasses off and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
“Oh come on, busting out of gates in a car, cruising around town with a billionaire you’re secretly banging. Isn’t this every teenage fantasy you’ve ever had?”
Cas waved cheerfully. “Just checking in on Kevin. Nice to see you, Melody.” He stopped at Melody’s desk, placing his elbows on the countertop. Dean stepped up awkwardly behind him, not sure where to look or what to do with his hands. He was usually the one with the plan to get past security. It didn’t look like they’d need to, here.
“Well, the last show is Saturday night, that’s four days from now. We have until then to figure out where the last piece of this guy is.” Cas ticked off the days on his fingers. “After that, I’m liable to get arrested—for real this time—if I set foot on school property.”
Castiel’s family was off-limits for conversation pretty much always. He didn’t like to talk about his home life, and didn’t like others to ask about it. All he said was that he had a mother and sister in Pontiac, and that they didn’t see much of each other anymore. No father, no school friends. Anna was the first person he met off the bus to Chicago, and the only friend he kept in contact with. Apart from her, Castiel had no one to tell where he was, no one to marvel over and laugh at the ridiculous but understated opulence of his current surroundings. He wasn’t expected at the bookstore until Monday afternoon, and the Institute was on break for summer term.
Dean considered. The other obit they had found was too grainy to make anything out. If this was the only legible record of Oswald’s life, they could be in deep trouble.
Definitely blushing now. “Well, thanks Cas, but this business isn’t really one you have to try hard to break into.”
As always, I thank you all so whole-heartedly for reading. When I started this piece, it was only about four chapters, and I thought maybe fifteen people would read it. I am astounded by the amount of comments this has gotten, and I love each and every one of them. Thank you for sticking with it, my friends. It is truly a privilege to see this story through to the end.
Dean shook his head. “It’s pretty uncommon. He seemed to know who I was though. At least what I do.”
The librarian looked up when he entered, and immediately went back to her book cart. Fine by Dean, the less he had to actually interact with the staff, the better. He wandered over to a poorly-stocked periodicals shelf in the front, away from the front desk and the windows looking into the hallway.
Now that he was in the car and closer to the smell of Dean’s cologne and the sight of his strong hands on the steering wheel, Castiel could feel it. He wasn’t quite sure what “it” was yet, be it attraction or something else, but there was something so magnetic about the man in front of him that he couldn't wait to get started. “No, they weren’t—“ He leaned over and put his hand on Dean’s knee, brushing upwards to get to his crotch. He’d seen Dean’s cock once before, but suddenly it wasn’t enough. Dean’s fingers curled around his and stopped his motion, holding his hand now. His thumb stroked over Castiel’s hand. It felt nice, but it wasn’t what he wanted.
The town was nice enough, clean streets and plenty of trees. It even had a library with a well-stocked mystery section. They hunkered down in a small motel for a few weeks, working odd jobs here and there, before they could put down a security deposit on a two-bedroom in the nicer part of the business district.
“What are we going to do?” Castiel asked quietly, as Dean let the curtain fall, bathing the room in darkness.
Two ghosts could be indicative of a bigger problem at hand, Dean mused. “I mean, what are we talking? Vengeful brides? Miserly owners?”
The two lapsed back into silence as they worked. Dean kept the radio at an acceptable volume and refrained from dancing around too much as he worked, as per Castiel’s request to actually get work done.
Castiel clenched his hands in the fabric of Dean’s over shirt. “Bullshit. Why’d you let me drive out of that garage?”
Castiel didn’t particularly like the thought of a girl, or anyone, making Dean feel like he couldn't shake apart anyone’s world with minimal effort. “I would,” he said, breathless. “If I had a clit and you were touching me like this, I’d never let you leave this position.”
“The femoral head continues to the greater trochanter, via the femoral neck, which in turn, continues to the rest of the femur in your thigh.” Cas blew hotly on the head of Dean’s erection, pleased when it elicited a whine from Dean.
“No, once it’s there, it’s all I can think about.” Cas’s gaze tripped between Dean’s mouth and his eyes. Everything was buzzing now. He still wasn’t entirely sure what was happening, but he knew things weren’t like this with Patrick. Or Nate. Or anyone else he had been on a date with.
“Did I tell you what Professor Harrow said last week about my pointe routine? He said he wants me to teach it to the intermediate class!” Anna was at the Art Institute of Chicago for their dance program. According to Anna it was the stuff of legends, but Castiel spent his time in the painting lab, he rarely saw anything that constituted as legendary.
“I saw one of your student’s... erm—masterpieces up by the light booth yesterday, dude. Someone out there is not your biggest fan.”
Sam watched Dean clench around his fork so hard his knuckles turned white. He felt bad about being so blunt, but his brother was hurting and he had to do what he could.
“Missed you every single day. Missed this—want you every day, just like this—you 'n me, Cas.” Dean’s hand squeezed him lightly, ramping up the pressure on his cock into something positively incendiary. Castiel felt his mouth open in a gasp, but heard no sound come out. He reached his arms up and stroked over Dean’s biceps, relishing how the water made his skin slippery and warmer than usual. He could feel Dean’s cock pressing insistently into his ass, not asking for entrance, but always making its presence known.
. Knew how he felt and encouraged it. Dean shifted to press down the butterflies he felt in his stomach and coughed. “I thought we were going to be professional about it.” He looked down the neck of his beer, feeling himself get red.
When Castiel first met Dean, he wouldn't have bet anyone that the handsome billionaire would be one for curling up in a blanket burrito on the couch, eating straight out of a carton of Ben and Jerry’s. Sure, the man liked to be comfortable, that much was obvious in the thickly padded carpet, the overly fluffy comforters on every bed, the state of the art entertainment system that Castiel still didn’t even want to think about learning to use. Still, seeing Dean buried up to his chin in a thickly-knitted blanket-tortilla put a smile on Castiel’s face that he didn’t want to examine too closely.
Smacking a wet kiss to Castiel’s cheek, Dean pulled away. “I used to hate it—getting all fussy over clothes. It does make a difference though. You look great. Delectable, I might even say.”
And it didn’t have to be a problem. Dean could pay for the entire tuition. He’d dropped several hundred dollars at the art store without batting an eye, even called the salary that he paid Castiel “pocket change.” If Castiel asked, there was no doubt in his mind that Dean would pay the tuition and shut up Balthazar and the rest of the financial aid department. But that wasn’t the real reason Castiel was pissed. He hated that this whole arrangement was so fucking necessary for Castiel’s survival. He didn’t like being so dependent on Dean, either for money or this weird pull Castiel felt to be near the man. He hated how much he needed the paycheck from Dean to live out what he wanted to do. Sure, it wasn’t strictly necessary to graduate from the Institute, but having a degree that told the world he was at least qualified to draw and paint opened a hell of a lot more doors than a freelancer with an inch-thick sketchbook, knocking on the door of every design firm in the city.
“I’m glad. I just wanted to thank you for taking such good care of me all the time, and I missed you.”
“Like what?” Castiel huffed. “I’m fine. I told you, I want to make a deal with y—“ He fell silent when Dean raised a hand.
They wove between partygoers out on the concrete patio, some recognizing Castiel and reaching out to offer congratulations. The woman pressed on, and he had to offer his most polite  avoidances to get away so he didn’t lose her in the crowd.
“Yes? He wants to what?” Castiel guided Dean to lay down across the couch, clambering around the couch to sit astride his waist when he was horizontal. He leaned down to brush his mouth over Dean’s spine, practically feeling the electricity zip up and down. Castiel decided that he liked Dean like this, underneath him with nowhere else to be, and nothing else to do. He ran his hands all over Dean’s back, not even pretending to be giving a massage anymore, just making Dean feel good.
Castiel sat bolt up in bed. Dean grunted from his side, stretching against Castiel’s thigh. “W’as goin’ on?” He asked sleepily.
He didn't say anything, but his eyes got a bit of a twinkle in them. The waitress brought their food and left her hand on Mr. Winchester's shoulder while she asked if there was anything else they needed. Castiel replied rather curtly, couldn't she see they were talking? When she left, Mr. Winchester watched her walk away for a moment with a tilted head before turning back to his companion. "Now, Not-James, you wanna tell me why you’re trolling for suckers out here in the middle of the night? Don’t you have school or something?”
Castiel swallowed and worked his jaw for a few seconds before speaking. “Do… do they—Bobby and Missouri— know why I’m here?”
Dean worked lower and lower on his body, the tension ramping up every inch closer he got to the place Castiel wanted him so desperately. Dean sank down on Castiel’s cock, his tongue laving over the slit and down, down, down. He pulled off, only to suck one of his own fingers in his mouth, getting it wet enough that it shone in the pale moonlight coming from the wide windows.
He sighed in relief when she scurried out of the room, probably to go gossip about him with Bobby. He didn’t know if he could speak, but he also didn’t want to hurt her feelings.
Except maybe his mouth. Or his hands, slowly coming up. Shit, this was going exactly where he thought it was. Right here in their shared kitchen.
Anna, best friend that she was, answered with a comically low-pitched mockery of his voice, with her face scrunched up like she'd just smelled something unpleasant.
Castiel smiled, but still felt the frustration. How would he ever get past this mental block if he was never given the chance?
Mr. Winchester continued eating his pie, completely unfazed, if not a bit amused at Castiel’s outburst. His eyes twinkled as he smirked around his fork. Castiel lowered his voice. “I’ve hit a… a snag at home, financially speaking, and I either have to take on three more minimum wage jobs to pay for both a place to live and school, or I go back to working on my uncle’s farm for the rest of my life.”
“Gonna turn it on now, lemme know if you need me to stop.” Dean whispered into his ear, nipping at the lobe,
But it was the way Cas said it that got Dean so bad. They had been fine! They both knew what was happening, both agreed that they would ride it out while he was in town, maybe even part as friends. Sure, Dean would be more than a little sad to see him go, but he had his job. And who knew? Maybe Dean would have even blown into town again to see him? Just a quick pop in to say
“—and they’ve included a note on your registration for this year. If the entire amount for the year isn’t paid up front, I can’t enroll you for this semester.” He finished and looked at Castiel expectantly. A long moment passed between them.
“I just… don’t know if I can be what he wants me to be for him.” He was aware he was making this overcomplicated, making this harder than it had to be, but he couldn’t stop himself.
Nodding vigorously, Cas unlatched himself and threw back the last of his beer. They scrambled out of the booth and pushed each other out the door, running into a scandalized man with a fedora at least old enough to be Dean’s grandfather. Dean took Cas’s hand, steadily ignoring the fact that he hadn’t held another man’s hand in his life, maybe ever. He tugged Cas out of the bar, around the corner of the building, and practically dragged him to the dark corner he had left the Impala in. He pressed Castiel up against the side door, pushing in close between his feet. Every direction he could possibly go, there was Cas. Pulling away to breathe, only to get dragged back in by his shirt. Pushing forward to get another hit off of whatever cologne Cas had clinging to his neck, to get tugged gently back up to his lips. Dean didn’t know where to put his hands to get the most access. He couldn’t get close enough, and yet he was wrapped all around the man in front of him. Dean felt like a live wire was zipping through his veins, and yet there was no brain activity to tell him to slow down or take it easy.
“I graduated, and I wanted far away from Illinois.” Cas shrugged. Dean could relate to that. Half the jobs he took nowadays were because they were in states far away from his father.
Andy nodded. “He’s been the youngest we’ve had in a while. In fact,” He called over to the pair of men. “Hank, how many drama teachers we have so far?”
“What do you want me to be into?” Castiel watched the man’s tongue flick out to wet his lips, without feeling any real heat behind the action. Since his experience with Dean, he was beginning to notice exactly where actual attraction fit into his job… and the many places it did not.
He pushed against Dean’s hard body to get some space to think. “Don’t. Don’t do this if you’re just going to leave me again.”
Dean covered his eyes with his hand, scrubbing over his face. “Good fucking question. There’s gotta be something else that’s holding his—essence or whatever it is. Something that has his DNA.”
“Please, Cas. Finish me off.” Dean groaned into Castiel’s skin, punctuating with a sharp press of teeth. Castiel kept going, greedy to make Dean come, eager to see him fall apart. It didn't take too long, a few more strokes saw Dean stuttering into Castiel’s fist and tensing up, his body a long line of taut perfection. He groaned into Castiel’s shoulder before biting down again on the skin there, causing Castiel’s hips to jerk mindlessly. More white joined Castiel’s release on his stomach as Dean thrust against him, riding it out.
Castiel reached down and took hold of Dean’s wrists, where his hands were still clamped around Castiel’s hips. He pressed Dean’s wrists into the leather seat, pinning him in place, totally at Castiel’s mercy.
Dean didn’t respond, but held her tight for a few seconds longer before stepping away, mysteriously swiping at his eyes and loudly going on a search for the beer. Sam was suddenly overcome by how weakly Dean had been holding himself together. He shared a worried glance with Sarah before following Dean into the kitchen/dining area.
“I don’t know. I have to talk to Charlie and my advisory team. See how much of the damage we can control.” Dean let his fingers stroke along Castiel’s arm as he walked back to the bed. He pulled on his jeans from the previous day, forgoing his underwear. He turned around to face Castiel. “And they know your name,” he looked stricken. “I’m sorry you got dragged into this shit too. I never meant for anyone to find—“ Castiel crossed the room and pressed a hand over Dean’s mouth. Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and moved it to his cheek.
The finger vanished and reappeared, slicker this time. Castiel wondered when Dean would add another finger. And then another. And then his cock perhaps. Would he tell Castiel when he was ready? What if he wasn’t stretched enough? Castiel felt his breath catch when Dean started thrusting lightly into him, but he couldn't find the same pleasure in the act that he had. He screwed his eyes shut and thrust back onto Dean’s fingers, gasping when a particularly hard jab caught his insides uncomfortably. He could do this. He could totally do this. People did it all the time, especially sex workers. What if he wasn’t any good at this? Would Dean throw him out? Gabriel’s words started low in the back of his head again. He was right, Castiel was there for one purpose only, to make Dean feel good. And Castiel would do anything for Dean. He couldn't  hear Dean whispering to him anymore, it was drowned out by the rushing sound in his ears. He became aware that he wasn’t hard anymore and he redoubled his focus, trying to just feel Dean’s hands on him, soothing. But no, the hands were restricting. Pulling. Shoving. Castiel grit his teeth and tried to find that pleasure again.
he thought bitterly. He felt a cool drip running down the corner of his mouth. His finger came away bloody when he swiped at it.
As it turned out, the theater owned no fewer than seven bowler hats, all of various colors and fabric qualities. Dean dutifully collected each one Cas threw down from where he was precariously perched with one foot on a low shelf and the other on the light board that took up the front of the room by the window looking down into the theater. Dean tried very hard not to notice what the angle did for his ass. Geez, now that he’d had a taste for Cas, it was hard to button it back up for the job.
The man chuckled, but it just sounded tired. “Nah, but I could be in an hour or so? You wanna go back to my place? Maybe have a drink?”
“Yeah.” Dean got up and turned towards the bookcase, picking up titles and setting them down. “And you date.” He said without turning around. He doesn’t sound angry or upset. He’s just stating a fact.
“Like you’re something to eat?” Cas leaned in and smiled with all his teeth, earning a bark of a laugh from Dean.
“It’s not a big deal.” Dean huffed. “You’re right—it’d be easier to get around if I know someone with keys, anyway.” As much as he’d hate to admit it to Castiel, he didn’t exactly mind the company either. Novak might not be experienced, but it was nice to be able to work with someone else.
Castiel didn’t know why, but he expected Dean to move a bit faster than the glacial pace he had chosen. He took a dry finger and just rubbed over Castiel’s hole. It felt a bit strange, but Castiel decided he liked it. Dean pressed a kiss to each of the dimples in Castiel’s spine, which made him smile.
“Castiel! I was right behind you, actually!” Amelia was the teacher Adler chose to chaperone the cast party. Dean leaned against Cas’s door, holding his extra crutch. Cas offered her the box, which she took gratefully. “It’ll be nice to have some extra reading material for break,” she said.
“Oh, you met Dr. Reynolds, then?” Anna asked, grinning. She could only imagine how that conversation must have gone.
“What the fuck?” The guy yelled. Dean clapped a hand across his mouth, really hoping there wasn’t anyone else in the building.
He vaguely registered turning south on I-57, heading out of the city. The radio was not on, and Castiel did not try to fill the silence. The car itself was well-built. The suspension was solid and did not pick up any of the roughness of the road. Built by strong hands. Castiel forced his train of thought away, so as not to lose control this close to the city. He had to go.
Sam looked out the windshield a moment. There was silence between them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. Finally, he said. “Sarah and I are trying for a baby." He kept his gaze firmly on the blinking sign advertising keno on the big window of the bar.
Cas thought about it in silence for several seconds. Finally, he said, “Are you going to laugh at me for being a lightweight?”
He was currently eyeing Castiel up and down like he was a dessert tray. His tongue peeked out, a shade of pink Castiel could see over here, and wet his full bottom lip and disappeared again. Castiel cleared his throat and pulled his attention back to his phone, as it buzzed.
He shouldn’t hold a grudge against the entire city. It’s only crime was being the meeting place for Castiel and the man he thought he loved. No reason to discredit the entire place. Still, he wasn’t lying. Chicago would be a hard place to live, even without the bad memories. It didn’t have one of the highest crime rates for nothing.
The nurse frowned. “We didn’t have him on anything that would put him to sleep. Must’ve been his good company.” Her frown turned to a knowing smirk.
The light was starting to come in from the window, dimmed only slightly by the curtains that were drawn haphazardly over the glass. The slight noise from the highway just outside was already starting to come through with the rising of the morning. Dean sighed. They probably had to get up and get moving, didn’t they? Had a whole bag of hats to burn, ghosts to expel, messes to clean up.
He sat back on the couch and tried to distract himself with the show. Even though he had slept quite comfortably the night before, he let his head drop against the armrest of the sofa and drift off with the show playing mindlessly in the background.
Castiel watched the punch-drunk look clear out of Dean’s eyes, and it was replaced by a hard look that had Castiel’s abdomen tightening up and his cock jerk.
When Castiel woke up the next morning, it was to the bright light spilling from the picture window in his own room. That is, the room that was considered his in Dean’s enormous lakeside mansion. Castiel wondered if Dean ever considered how very Batman-esque his abode made him seem. He sat up and stretched, scratching absently at a hickey on his throat. Though the marking of skin was not technically on the “allowed” list of acts between Dean and himself, he couldn't find it within himself to care very much.
“Nah. Ted’s all but kicking me out ‘for my own good’ as he says.” Cas’s mouth slanted. “I think he suspected the theater was haunted long before we knew.”
Cas turned towards him and squeezed back. “No, not sad. Just feels strange to be leaving it behind like this.”
“Jo at work owes me a favor—don’t look at me like that, keep driving!” She added, receiver muffled like she was talking to the person in the car next to her.  Castiel had to smile through the tears, still coming down. Trust Anna to have his back, even when he hadn’t been around to have hers the past few weeks.
The numbers ran through Castiel’s head until a man who clearly met all Castiel’s requirements slid into the seat next to him, hurriedly tucking a small object—wedding ring, Castiel’s experience told him—into his back pocket. Sandy hair, with deep-set laugh lines, this man looked like he just got off at the local Radio Shack. A completely normal, forgettable face. Perfect.
The decision was made for him, some twenty minutes later. Dean was pacing in his living room, trying to puzzle out what was the best course of action. He tried to slow himself down when his phone notified him of a new text, but fumbled for his phone as fast as he could.
“It’s not that, it’s just that you give me so much—it’s hard to reciprocate and—“ He cut himself off. He didn’t want Dean to think that he didn’t value himself and his time.
“I know. Tell me the bonessssss.” Dean wiggled his fingers and drew out the words like a stuffy old lady. Cas laughed, despite himself.
Castiel finished his sketch and recapped the pen, admiring his work, allowing Anna her arm back. “Well, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re a stripper, and I suck dick for money, and together we’re just trying to get through art school. Alright, go ahead, guess the artist.”
Cas accepted the crutch that Dean handed him gratefully. He could see Cas’s leg was bothering him just using the one. “I certainly won’t be needing them,” Cas said. “We’re off on a cross-country road trip.”
Somewhere not Chicago. Somewhere far away from Dean and all the trouble he’d caused, both intentionally and accidentally. It hurt like hell to think about, but Dean knew it was the best course of action for Castiel to get a clean break. He could start over. A new art school, new job.
“It’s okay,” Castiel said, grabbing Dean’s hand with his own. When Dean loosened his grip enough, Castiel moved his hand just a bit downwards, right over his throat. “Can we do this for a bit more though? Before I go? I’ll leave you to your cars—just choke me for a bit.”
The nurse smiled. “We’ve got the bones in his leg set, and he’s been given a mild sedative for the pain.”
Anna paused at the sudden dismissal. “Vanilla if they have it. I’ll see you in ten minutes, Castiel. Promise.”
“Why don’t you just go ahead and fuck off out of him and I won’t have to.” Even as Oswald-in-Cas’s-body came towards him, he didn’t lower his pistol.
“I hate landscapes but big huge abstract pieces and lots of color and lines, that’s what I paint. Eyes too.”
Oh no, the tears were coming back again. And this time, there was very little time for Castiel to stop them. Castiel stood up shakily. “So you don’t want to fuck me, is that it?”
When Dean looked up, he was stricken, a haunted expression laying heavy in his eyes. “No. Sammy, he thinks I kicked him out because of the news story.”
“This must be where all the cool kids drink.” Dean gestured around to the dozens of older men crowded around tables and the wide oak bar at the front. Like thousands of others bars, The Independent Club had that unique smell of spilled beer and stale sweat practically pounded into the wooden planks that made up the floor and walls. Also like thousands of other bars, it had the same kind of clientele. Over 50, graying hair and beard, potbellies hanging over large belt buckles. Perfect for catching a game of pool or cards.
Dean looked up when he heard footsteps enter the main living room, needing a couple tries to get the blankets out of his face so he could see. His arm, holding the half-empty ice cream container, appeared from the depths of the burrito, offering his treat to Castiel. Plopping down next to Dean, Castiel took the ice cream and the spoon, sitting a safe distance away from Dean on the couch.
“What are you gonna tell the school about the window?” Dean asked. He didn’t really like the idea of getting thrown out of the school before he’d really gotten a chance to start. It wouldn’t stop him, but it wouldn’t make anything any easier. “Play practice gone rogue?”
Shrugging, Dean let his head loll back for a second. “I know what your mouth tastes like.” Couldn’t get the taste of it out of his head actually. He kept replaying the first moment his lips touched Cas’s, and that brilliant electric shock that had coursed through him. He’d felt the sparks come back earlier this afternoon, and he was fighting the urge to see if that same voltage could be attained now.
“Keep going, you’re really close, aren’t you?” Castiel asked with a smile. Dean nodded furiously in the crook of his neck. “Come for me and we can go again. I really wanna get your cock inside me tonight.”
“I can do that too, if you show me what you like.” He was really laying it on thick here, but he didn’t lie. He
“What did you think? Not too bad, eh?” Dean asked breathlessly. Castiel laughed, just as out of breath.
“I’m gonna put this on and if you need me to take it off, just call out your safeword, alright?” Castiel’s vision was blocked out. Dean’s big hands smoothed fabric over the sides of his head and seemed to tie something behind him. A blindfold.
“What the fuck, man? Are you… mad at me or something? We knew I had to leave.” Dean was quickly switching gears from angry to outright bewildered.
“Castiel!” A voice interrupted from the door. Castiel turned, half grateful, and saw a flash of red hair before he was attacked around the middle by Anna launching herself at him. Randy hurriedly gave him his change and scooted the sodas a bit closer to the edge of the counter, standing back.
“As long as you come with me.” Castiel was really laying it on thick, but Dean was fun. Flirting was fun with him.
“Dean!” Castiel exclaimed, halfway between a laugh and a rebuff. A hand on his arm caught his attention. He looked up and saw the dark-haired woman from before smiling and beckoning him away from the conversation.
“He works in a bookstore, for your information.” Dean still sounded snippy. Sam figured he better tone it down if he wanted any juicy details. The contract hadn’t actually been all that telling of the dynamic of their relationship. All Sam knew was that Dean had a guy tucked away somewhere that he (apparently regularly) showered with gifts, in exchange for blow jobs. “What are we thinking for tonight? The Camaro or the Impala?”
Cas smiled at Dean’s lack of coherency. He slid his hands slowly around Dean’s middle, and hugged him in tight. Pressed a smooch there against Dean’s neck. Dean’s head lolled to the side when Cas started nipping at the skin there. Another zing of electricity started somewhere near the base of Dean’s skull and spread everywhere, warming his fingertips and making him press his hips in closer. Cas whispered in his ear, “I know what I’m doing. Let me take care of you. Please.”
A waitress with a blindingly pink uniform wandered over and unleashed her megawatt smile on the both of them. Castiel was sure he had only ever seen that particular shade of pink in medicine bottles.
Shaking his head, Kevin slumped back against his pillows again. “He grabbed me. It was weird though. When he touched me, I felt cold. Like I’d never be happy again, and like… I dunno, like it wanted… inside of me. That sounds bad.” He grimaced and laughed uncomfortably.
Dean piped up with his mouth full. “So, like, what—are you just gonna chalk it up as a loss and move on or what?”
Castiel smelled an easy victory. He pressed his chest close to Dean’s, reveling in the warmth coming off his skin. “I just want to make you feel good, Dean. You always take such good care of me, and I just want to make sure you get taken care of too. Please?” He looked up at Dean from under his lashes, knowing he was laying it on thick but also knowing it was working wonders on Dean’s self-control.
“It’s unfortunate, yes. We really feel that we have no other choice. I’m terribly sorry, Mr. Novak. Of course, you will be refunded whatever portion of this upcoming semester’s tuition you have already paid—“ The voice on the end of the phone faded into a buzz as Castiel zoned out. He must have ended the call and put the phone down in his lap. The next thing he was aware of was how he jumped when Dean brushed his fingers over his arm, silently asking permission to touch him.
Bela waved her hand dismissively. “Always a pleasure to check up on Dean Winchester and company. He certainly does keep a low profile out here, doesn’t he?”
ignored the heat he could feel coming off of the man. “It looks like despite a few football injuries... the majority of them.”
“My parents both died when I was really young, too.” Castiel said after a moment of silence. He didn't like to talk about it much, not to Anna, not to his uncle, not to anyone. He didn't even really know why he said it now. Perhaps he and Dean had more in common than he originally thought. Dean glanced over at him, and took his hand, smiling softly. Castiel was sure his hands must be cold from the ice cream, but Dean’s were very warm. Castiel found his cheeks getting warm when Dean squeezed his hand, pulling it to his mouth to lay a soft kiss on his knuckles.
“Come for me, Castiel.” Dean whispered. And how could Castiel deny him anything? Although Castiel felt strung out and messy, Dean didn’t lose a drop out of his mouth. Castiel felt that his abdomen was never going to loosen up. When he finally calmed down, he felt Dean’s hand petting over his still-jumping stomach muscles. Dean still looked wrecked, but he smiled at Castiel. “Better?” Castiel nodded, and Dean stood up, rolling his shoulders and popping his jaw. He bent down to scoop his shirt off the ground, and walked over to the sink, turning it on to wash his hands.
Sam fell silent again. He’d have to rework through this issue. Dean in love was not a happy man. If anything, being self-aware of how he felt was paralyzing Dean in a way Sam was not used to seeing.
Castiel couldn't wait to get this man back on him, and made grabby hands at Dean, fully aware how ridiculous he must look. Dean, though, with his rumpled hair and feral expression, didn’t smile, didn’t react at all, aside from his heaving chest, staring down at Castiel.
Cas looked steadily at him. Dean licked his lips. Eyes fell to lips, and back up. Dean opened his mouth to tell Cas to stop staring, but he only noticed because he himself was staring. And suddenly, Cas had his lips pressed to Dean’s.
“Oh, cool.” Castiel stuffed his hands in his pockets and rocked back and forth on his heels, looking around the empty parking lot.
Dean rolled his eyes. He remembered being a snotty teenager, but that didn’t mean he liked dealing with them in his adult years. He sighed and sat down in the chair for the booth. He really couldn’t get where he needed to be with civilians in the room, he might as well be comfortable while he waited. From here, he couldn’t really tell what the play they were reenacting was supposed to
Dean didn’t think Cas’s eyes could go any wider, or his irises any blacker, but he was dead wrong. “You want to give me a blow job?” Cas gritted out, his fingers clenching around nothing.
“Guess so.” Dean sauntered closer, wrapping an arm around Castiel’s hips and peering over his shoulder while he mixed paint.
“I’ll help you. I can pay for everything, that’s fine. I’ll still hold up my end of the bargain, and… there’s a car you can use.”
It took a few seconds for Castiel’s gaze to wander back up to Dean’s face, but he saw that smirk again before it was quickly schooled into an expectant, but patient expression. Dean was waiting to be told what to do next. Dean would do whatever Castiel told him to do. He could order this man to suck him off and he would. Probably with a smile on his face. Castiel sat up straight in the chair. “And your underwear.” He was proud that he mostly kept the tremor out of his voice.
Castiel’s eyes opened, and while they were bloodshot, Dean was happy that they were able to focus on him. His head lolled in Dean’s direction and a smile cracked across his bloodied face like a chip in a windshield. “Deeeaan—! Didn’t think I’d see you again!” He slurred like he’d been drinking.
“Better than giving out blowjobs for fifty bucks on the street corner, huh?” The easy ribbing was a mark at how far they had come. Castiel wasn’t as ashamed of his past anymore. He knew who he was, and what he was good at. He was good at loving others, being loved in return, and creating art out of love. He felt good.
Castiel huffed. “Well, I guess I’ll go get a soda or something. Call me when you’re… done or whatever.” He paused by the chair where Winchester still sat, smiling gently when Winchester ran his fingers over his knuckles. They shared a look, clearly communicating in some unspoken thing inaudible to anyone outside their tense little bubble. Anna rolled her eyes and looked away. That wasn’t meant for her eyes. Castiel grabbed his shoes and coat from beside the door and left, gently closing the door behind him and starting down the stairs. Anna was left with Winchester all alone in her apartment.
sound and clutched at Castiel’s shoulder so hard that Castiel would have smiled if his mouth wasn’t full.
The man smiled and it felt like being trapped in snake’s sights. His voice was smooth as whiskey, lowered a few notches to an intimate volume above a whisper. “Just take it easy. Right now, I want you to be the dominant. Just for a bit. See if you wanna give this a whirl for real. Is that alright?” Dean knelt in front of Castiel’s chair, just in front of his knees. Dean’s proximity made the room feel a hundred times hotter. He looked up at Castiel from underneath his lashes. “What would you like me to do, Castiel?”
Castiel chuckled. “Well, in terms of the ghost, we’re running out of options.” He ran a hand through his already-messy black hair, further ruffling it up. Dean forced his attention across the street to the hardware store where its elderly shopkeeper was setting out a display of lawnmowers.
This wasn't working. He couldn't do this. The room’s fluorescent lights buzzed all the louder in Castiel’s ear, and combined with the hum from the bar beyond the door that Castiel could still here. Was the door even locked? What if someone came in? Was this man even clean? Were they going to use a condom? The jabbing at his hole suddenly felt eleven times more uncomfortable as the feelings mounted like a wave, high above Castiel’s head. It wasn't like this with Dean, this was bad.
dancer.” She squinted at the ink on her arm. "Um... you already did Monet, and the face looks too normal to be Picasso... he's the one who paints the weirdo alien faces, right?"
Dean got a slight EMF blip near the cafeteria. He held his position and swept over the white-tiled room that had probably been a combo auditorium before a rich alumnus coughed up the money for something nicer. The reader didn’t pick up anything stronger than background noise, not unusual for this part of the state. There were a lot of Native American burial grounds and final resting places of pioneers out West. People were sometimes surprised by the amount of spirits out on dark country roads, but Dean was no fool. A woman in white was as common as a coyote out here, if you knew where to look.
“Come on, Cas...” Dean begged, starting the chant over. The spirit bucked and pulled, but Dean hung on for dear life, the catwalk starting to sway gently with their motion. Suddenly, a cosmic ripping sound tore through the air and Dean was pushed back, holding Cas while a gray wisp of smoke fell to the other side of the catwalk. Dean scrambled back with Cas in his arms as the smoke solidified and straightened up.
“Sometimes.” Cas murmured, ducking slightly to meet Dean’s eyes, probing his gaze with a slight frown, like he was worried about Dean or something. “Sometimes, his hands grab your face and they’re rougher than a woman’s. They sometimes even hold you down.”
“A broken heart…” Castiel stopped walking. “Dean, did you ever get the staff records from the office?”
“Okay,” Cas whispered, “I’ll show you how.” He fit his other hand to the curve of Dean’s jaw, and when Dean thought he was going to get pushed down, Cas tilted his head up to look at him again. Dean unscrewed his eyes just in time to get tugged back up to kiss Cas. It must have been an awkward angle, with Cas leaning down, and Dean straining upward, but he couldn’t care less. Frankly, any time spent away from kissing Cas was time wasted, in Dean’s opinion. There was a new hunger to the kiss now, like Cas was doing his very best to worm his way inside Dean’s skin. Cas pulled away. “You have to relax,” he whispered. “I promise not to choke you, but if you’re tense like that, it won’t be good for either of us.” He kissed Dean again. “Relax for me, baby.”
Castiel felt himself getting angry. He was tired of pretending he meant something to Dean besides an easy lay. “No, I don’t. Why should I be any different? Just some whore you messed around with—“
Dean had gotten a look at that ceiling as well, and would’ve believed it easily. “They won’t question you because your group was the last in there?”
Right as Castiel started getting drowsy, settled on the couch, Dean shifted, pulling the blanket off of himself. As Castiel glanced up at him, he realized their hands were still intertwined.
Castiel didn’t remember his mattress being this comfortable when they picked it up at a secondhand store, much to Anna’s dismay.
“You didn’t fuck me. You promised.” Castiel couldn't help but feel petulant, even if most of it was for show.
“Well, whoever it is that has your heart… he’s a lucky bastard.” Trevor gave him one last peck on the cheek and started back towards his car, glancing over his shoulder a few times.
Castiel pressed all of himself against Trevor as they met. He wanted so badly to be able to be okay, to be normal, after Chicago. He apologized with the way his tongue danced with Trevor’s, pulling a soft grunt of appreciation out of him. When they parted, Trevor licked his lips and smiled.
Castiel liked when his job was easy like this. Easy to laugh and joke with Dean, easy to just be with him in the same space, easy talking about things that he loved.
Apparently Dean did want this. At least, it certainly seemed that way when an arm was slung around Cas’s waist and he was pulled down fully against Dean, every inch of them connecting in heat. Dean whimpered as Cas drew his tongue across Dean’s bottom lip, silently requesting that Dean open his mouth right the fuck now. Dean rolled his hips up towards Cas, grinding shamelessly into him. This was a little high-school, but Cas couldn’t be fucked to care. Cas gasped into Dean’s mouth when Dean’s very noticeable erection ground against his. He shifted his weight to his right hand as his left worked down between the two of them and ghosted his fingers over Dean’s cock. A shudder ran through the man beneath him and he smiled into their next kiss. He painstakingly dragged the zipper down, closing his mouth over Dean’s. He pulled away then, placing a hand on Dean’s chest when he tried to follow, forcing him to stay back. He sat up and quickly unbuttoned Dean’s jeans, pulling them and his boxers down around his ankles, Dean lifting up helpfully. Dean was left bare, his cock standing up proudly. Dean spread his legs invitingly and fixed Cas with a smirk that would have been more effective if Dean hadn’t looked so desperate and wanton.
Castiel suddenly flew across the practice field, hitting a poorly-placed oak tree that was likely older than the field itself. He crumpled to the ground and didn’t move immediately. Dean took a step back to go to him, but Adler zipped across the field to appear right in front of Dean. He found himself hoisted into the air by his jacket, staring down into the lined and furious face of the principal. The man’s eyes looked funny, not that they were significant in any way before, but now they looked—empty… washed out.
Dean rolled his eyes, pushing himself onto his back. “I didn’t know it was such a priority.” He glanced over at Castiel.
Castiel smiled without looking up from his sketch pad. He’d sat in on Anna’s primary class a few times. A group of kindergartners trying to keep up with the Macarena would never be unfunny. Trevor dismissed the dancers and everyone stood up to leave. The girls went to pack up their kits, rolling up tights, slipping on street shoes, and shrugging into their parkas—winter in Kansas was not known for its balminess. Castiel reached for his bag as well, glancing around for his pencil case. Where was his smudger?
“I just think it sounds a bit… impersonal is all. Kinda like I just—I dunno—picked you up right off the street.” Dean shuffled his foot, kicking up a bit of water that had puddled under their feet as they dripped.
“We thank him for his hard work and dedication to the show, even after being gravely injured.” The voice continued until a dark-haired man stepped out from behind the curtain on the left side of the stage. The kids shuffled around as their director came to stand in the middle of the stage.
“—but not as many circles as the turquoise one… Anna, there’s only so much I can talk about, it’s a gas station mural. Why am I doing this?”
Castiel pulled back as best as he could. “Dean—Dean, are you going to fuck me now? You said you were going to take me.You gotta fuck me.” He could feel the desperation that must be painting his features, desperation to get this beautiful man inside him as fast as he could. He didn’t care that he was still technically a virgin. He was going to change that right the fuck now. Dean moaned against his shoulder and pulled up. His eyes were wild and dark. He didn’t let up thrusting against Castiel’s hip, and if Castiel hadn’t come so soon, he would have been deeply aroused by the unbridled desire in front of him.
Dean’s broken in to a lot of places. He’s broken out of more, but that’s usually the easier part of his gig anyway. The school itself didn’t look like it had the cutting edge of security, but the old busybodies with their craning necks and suspicious squinting at newcomers down at the grocery store on the next block could complicate Dean’s life a lot more than any hackable security camera. Even so, Dean knows what he’s doing. Pick a vulnerable spot—a propped open dock door, open window, anywhere that’s not the
“Yes, Dean.” Castiel tried to put some force behind his words. He could feel himself getting hard again from Dean’s threats. He was going to do it this time.
Dean grinned. “Definitely one of the more perplexing cases. The company’s not bad this time around, though.” He nudged Cas again.
After descending the stairs, Castiel followed the sound of blaring AC/DC further down the hallway. As he got closer, he heard a man’s voice he thought might be Dean singing—trying to sing along, in a way that was rather off-key. Castiel chuckled as he pushed open the heavy door with his arm that led into an expansive vehicle bay with concrete walls and flooring.
“Mustard won’t like it, but he doesn’t deal much in muscle.” Kaiser leaned in like he was telling a secret.
