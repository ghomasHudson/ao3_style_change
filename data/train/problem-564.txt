“I couldn’t believe you wanted me sad and lonely instead of accepting me for whom I am. If only you could have seen your face when I told you James and I broke up and then I told you about Mary” John rubbed his forehead, trying to erase the memory with his fingertips “heaven opened for all of you that day…” John looked away and took a deep breath “I’ll call you as soon as we’re settled Mum. I promise” John approached her and gave her a hug “I’ll have Rosie, you can bring Dad if you want, but I have one condition” Julia nodded “My house, my rules” She nodded again “One word against Sherlock…” John let out a breath and Julia simply nodded again, closing her eyes and accepting everything John was saying.
“I also know that you know how important it is for me to finish medical school; that I somehow managed to get a scholarship and that most my time, for the next five years will be spent studying, having long shifts at the hospital, playing rugby and keeping high scores to keep the scholarship; coming home late and having just the right amount of time to be with Rosie and bring her up” John licked his lips once again and tried to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s the entire time, it wasn’t really worth it starting something that could end even before it truly began.
He closed his eyes and relished on John’s warm body next to his and took a deep breath, at the same time, John moved closer, putting his arm over Sherlock’s stomach and pulling him close, inhaling deeply and sighing happily, fast asleep. Sherlock couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face, he put his arm around John and kissed his temple, relishing in the smile that appeared on John’s lips and the soft mumble of his name.
Suddenly, John’s hands were on him, fingers running down with feather light touches from his throat to his navel, touching Sherlock’s body reverentially, scorching touches that outlined Sherlock’s newly formed pectorals and abdominals -all the boxing and running-; John looked up, not a question, not asking, just looking, and Sherlock nodded, imperceptibly, a slight movement, a bounce of his raven like curls, and John’s mouth was on his, greedy, hungry, incessant, asking for entrance, which Sherlock readily granted. Then there was a little push as they walked to their bedroom, never breaking the kiss, John’s hands reaching for Sherlock’s body while Sherlock fumbled with John’s shirt buttons.
“You already are” John smiled “Mum’s pissed, but she’ll come around” John tried to reassure Sherlock “Told her about you, though”
and spikes it with some hemlock, that effectively takes away the sadness. The last thing he sees is the man from the beach running away from him.
The “kidnapping” happened on moving day. John headed to the Holmes’ manor, leaving Sherlock with his friends to unload and unpack; he wanted to enter his new home with Rosie in his arms, together, with Sherlock by his side; he wanted to decided where to place the cot with Rosie in his arms -ever the romantic- John went in search of his -their?- daughter.
He left the hospital after a staff meeting with his father and sister, one of his colleagues, Mike, invited him to see a show “I know a few of the performers” He said, and convinced a very tired, very reluctant John to go with him to see Sweet Charity. He sat and waited for the show to start, a brunette waitress tried to flirt with him and he gave her a polite smile and flirted back a little.
“With Sherlock’s parents for the day” John continued loading the car and clearly heard his mother’s sharp breath intake.
They both had three words in their minds, in the tip of their tongues, but it was too soon to voice them, at least it was what they thought. Sherlock had asked John to move in with him; John agreed, but he knew it was too soon, he just hoped that when it happened they’ll be ready, Sherlock on the other hand, was anxious for time to fly by so he could be with the man he loved.
A hoax, such was written, to kill me, yet, I was asked back. A hoax, an awful hoax. To save our love.
He went to the Yard to pester Lestrade for a little while. He’d been receiving cold cases every week and Greg was very fond of the little rascal he had met five years ago, a boy he had saved from drugs during a night his brother called “a danger night”. He’d escaped his home after Redbeard was put down, a young constable, that had recently joined the force found him wondering around a bad neighbourhood and had watched as Billy Wiggings, one of the many, Baker Street irregulars offered the boy the solution for his problems and handed him a bag of cocaine in exchange for some of the money he had in his wallet.
The world stopped again the second John entered the coffee shop; there he was, the man he had dreamt about for the last month, not knowing what to do, if going to him or stand there and wait for the world to move again. The moment Sherlock looked up, the world started spinning and all John could do was to hold Rosie close as a lifeline. Greg was standing right behind him and he beckoned him to the table where Sherlock was waiting. John eyes Greg suspiciously and Greg smirked; once he was sitting right in front of Sherlock, Greg excused himself with a phone call and left them to their own devices.
“You’re a single parent, John” Sherlock rolled his eyes “You’re stablishing timetables and schedules; you need them to function properly. Going out today to your mother’s has clearly tired you, your left eye twitches when you haven’t had enough sleep. Going by Rosie’s age she still feeds every five hours, and you’ve glanced to the right side of the screen almost eighteen times since the call started, clearly checking the time and calculating” John blushed furiously “You look tired, John” Sherlock gave him a small smile “Get some sleep. I’ll call you at ten to chat some more while you feed Rosie”
Hello all!!! So, I'm in my free week so I'm updating all I have of this story... and then maybe... have you wait for about a month, unless I finish it the next couple of days.  Thank you for reading!!! Happy Sherlock!
Sherlock put Rosie on the ground and fetched water for all of them; he looked at John, not knowing what else to do. Thankfully, Rosie broke the ice by calling John loudly “Daddy” she screeched and then giggled, showing John her latest great deed, taking off her socks and wiggling her toes. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and the conversation started flowing around Rosie and what she’d been doing.
“John…” Sherlock sighed and looked out the window, trying to steady his voice “I can’t do this anymore, John… I’m sorry” Sherlock took a deep breath and spoke before John did “I’ve tried to make you happy, but it’s noticeable I can’t… You don’t trust me enough to tell me what is going on with you, you blame me for everything, even though I’ve apologised repeatedly...” He tried to take a steadying breath but his lungs were on fire “I know you met someone” He felt the blood rush to his ears and his stomach plummeting down “I’ve known it since before…” He let out a shuddering sigh… he still couldn’t say Mary’s name “I’ll give you a week to move your things out of the flat… Please, be prompt” Sherlock used his best -I’m a machine voice- at the next stop he climbed out of the cab and ran, getting lost in the dark corners of the city
So sorry for the delay... Been catching up with my english lit readings. Hope you enjoy this couple of chapters, will resume writting as soon as I finish with Brontë...
John just blinked several times, trying to catch with everything Sherlock was saying. He was supposed to be finishing his third year, not University, he’s just eighteen! And going to college for three years already… John sighed… he needed to remember he was dating a freaking genius that solved a crime in less than a minute…
Sherlock left the stage and ran to his dressing room, to his surprise another bouquet was waiting for him and his heart swelled at the prospect of this JW sending him more red roses. It had been almost three weeks since the show started and since the first night he'd laid eyes on JW he was smitten. Flirting back and forth for the last couple of weeks was filling him with raw need.
. John couldn’t help the smile. He felt lightheaded, his stomach was fluttering and his heart was thrumming restlessly in his chest. He took a deep breath and tried to concentrate, but all he could think about was Sherlock minding his baby daughter.
Certain behaviours his brother presented made him hit the nail in the head and conclude that his brother had an addictive personality. He would get interested in something and act all OCD for a while until he got bored; it had happened with his piracy aspirations -obviously related to Redbeard’s death- his experiments with plants, which soon died as soon as winter came -though he would have wanted he would’ve forgotten his experiments with poisonous plants- and the insane need to have honey all the time, with everything he ate, even though the results were, most of the times, as disgusting as one could imagine -from fish and chips with honey to potpie with honey- his addictive personality bordered in the insane, he would get addicted to something and would work on it for hours at the time; the only thing sticking -the honey, the violin, the dance and chemistry- becoming more important than eating or sleeping, which is why, at some point, Mycroft suspected of some sort of OCD.
Sherlock couldn’t look away from the man standing right in front of him, less than a metre away. A short, sturdy, strong teenager, eyes as blue as a summer sky, with little flecks of gold that made those eyes shine under the light. Thin lipped and a tongue that made Sherlock’s stomach twist with desire and his heart beat like a wild bird trying to escape its prison. Broad shoulders, tanned skin, strong hands holding a baby that didn’t look like him at all. Sherlock’s mind filled with information.
“Sure you didn’t deduce him?” John chuckled and Sherlock furrowed his brow, looking up at his boyfriend with an offended expression “Sorry, love.” John looked contrite.
“The constable was very nice” Mary smiled and looked up at John, John simply rolled his eyes “None of that, he’s too old for me” She chuckled and made John chuckle “Maybe Molly will fancy him” John shook his head and held her again, feeling less sad somehow “We have to tell your parents” She took a deep breath and broke apart the hug before holding his hand.
“Sherlock” the man said and patted his back repeatedly “Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and your date”
Sure, the kisses were heated, the touches felt like fire whenever a hand ran over a leg  or an arm, every single touch and kiss leaving a tingling sensation at the base of their spines, but they waited, patiently, lovingly, happily. John was sure that if he waited, when it came it will be the best experience ever, Sherlock was certain of the same, even though the wait was becoming less pleasant and uncomfortable, and a few times quite embarrassing, because of certain dreams Sherlock was having, opening your eyes in the middle of the night and finding yourself sticky, wasn’t something he found as pleasurable as the lasting sensation of a fulfilling orgasm.
“John” Sherlock made the name sound like music to John’s ears “I wanted to write to you, but I wasn’t quite sure about what to say” He admitted shyly and John practically beamed at him.
And then, it happened, Christmas Eve, nine months and six days after they got together. They’d just put Rosie to bed and were about to share dinner when a drinking accident happened, Sherlock spilled his wine over his shirt because he got distracted by John’s question about their plans for Christmas day. He pulled his white shirt over his head and went to the kitchen to soak it. John was looking at him with a hungry expression that left Sherlock breathless.
“Yes…” John licked his lips again, feeling his nerves crash and burn “Actually…” He looked down at Rosie and tried to gather the courage that was leaving him with every breath.
“I’m sorry, John” Sherlock was almost pleading and John felt his heart break “I had no idea… When Mamie summons us, it’s quite difficult to say no” he tried to chuckle but it sounded more like a sob.
"Always the writer." Sherlock chuckles and I feel it in my chest. I blush and he rubs my knee, encouraging me to keep talking.
“I could never leave you” He whispered the words to John’s head, kissing his forehead softly and running his hands over John’s back
When Mary met John, she was supposed to be tutored by him. She had problems with science and John was to help her, but it took ninety seconds for them to become something more than just tutor and tutored. In ninety seconds John smiled fondly at her, patted her shoulder and told her she was brilliant, and in ninety seconds, he broke her heart and mentioned James six times. In the first ninety seconds of their meeting, Mary felt attracted to the strong, tanned, ash blonde, blue eyed, rugby captain. John was flattered, to say the least, but his heart was elsewhere, as he explained in the next ninety seconds after meeting her. Yes, Mary was the girl every girl wanted to be like and every boy wanted to be with, that is except John Watson.
"Oh, love!" John touches my face softly and I feel everything melt away. Now, in this life, he's the only one.
When the music started, Mary was supposed to be walking down the aisle, her father was waiting for her outside the room she was changing in. after five minutes of music and no signal of his daughter coming out, he knocked on the door only to receive no answer. He tried to open the door but it was locked from the inside. He knocked again, harder this time, and all he heard was a small thud from the inside and nothing more.
“Mister Watson, Mrs. Watson, it’s a pleasure to see you again” Sherlock smiled and was as polite as his education provided, shaking hands with Mr. Watson and kissing Mrs. Watson cheek.
John gaped at the man and Sherlock smiled, pleased “I’m not his date” John managed to say and Sherlock frowned; he meant to say “I’m his boyfriend, but the man kept on smiling and talking.
They talked for hours, both minding Rosie and sharing some food and tea instead of coffee. The waitress came with their check at closing time and John invited Sherlock to come over to his flat. Sherlock accepted gladly, but to John’s dismay Bill and Mike were home so Sherlock offered to visit the next day and take John for coffee. Reluctantly, even though happily, John accepted and walked into his flat, wishing he had kissed Sherlock instead of giving him such a lame goodbye.
“Afraid I didn’t notice in the heat of the moment and afterwards…” The heat of the moment, he knew all about the heat of the moment
“I don’t need distractions” Sherlock blushed the cutest shade of pink and John couldn’t help but feel swooned “I have you” He muttered lowly but John heard him.
The happy ending I promised. Long live Mofftiss and that wonderful ending. It was so open and it let so many opportunities in! From now on, now that I know what trully happened, I can keep writting them as I love them, happy and together, forever!!!
John couldn’t believe the way Sherlock was, this sweet, amazing, soft creature, unknown to others, he was sure he was the first to witness the real Sherlock. Most people that had met him described him as cold, detached, and one of Victor’s friends had even said the reason behind their breakup was Sherlock not “putting out” to Victor; thanks to Mike, John didn’t punch the arsehole that called Sherlock “the virgin freak, a frigid bitch”. After a wonderful week, John fell more in love with Sherlock that he thought possible.
“You listen to me, and listen clear” John pulled him closer “You so much as look in his direction and you’ll find, in the worst possible way, who will end up being the frigid bitch” He whispered close to Anderson’s face “Be warned, Phillip Anderson, fuck up once more and you’ll wish you never met him” He let go of Anderson and walked to Sherlock, standing next to him  before addressing Donovan “And you” She looked at him “Call him freak again…” he huffed, closed his eyes and turned to Sherlock “You okay, love?” Sherlock nodded “You’re not a freak, my love” John crushed him in a tight hug; Sherlock was trembling from arousal, unable to control his body any longer “Sure you’re okay?” Sherlock nodded again.
“Of course we’ll be needing two” John beamed at her and looked down at Rosie; he had shared his bedroom with the little girl since she was born, having a room just for her was a must at this point.  They went to the upstairs bedroom and looked at the space, it was well lit and clean; Mrs. Hudson had painted the room with a light yellow and had one wall decorated with a big pale pink rose. John smiled at the sight and held Rosie up “This, young lady” He had her facing the room “Will be your room” He blew a raspberry on her neck and the little girl giggled “Shall we fix it?” He looked and Sherlock and Sherlock nodded.
“Would you ever tell me what happened?” John asked as he grabbed Sherlock’s waist and pulled him impossibly closer
“Well” John took a deep breath “Thanks for the cheating” He stood “And the coffee” he left some money on the table, but before he could leave, James stood and pulled him by the arm; John imagined it would feel like a shiver running down his spine, but it felt normal and he remembered the way the brief touch of Sherlock’s arm had felt over his entire body, he turned to looked at James and suddenly, not like in the movies, but pretty close, he felt… nothing. Yeah, this was the man he had, let’s say, loved, for over two years, they’d been together for almost two years, “made love”, had frantic sex, fought, laughed, cried, but he no longer had that spell over him.
He arrived to his flat and was greeted by Mike and Bill, they both had been waiting for John to arrive to share a few beers, celebrate the end of their second year and compare notes from the exams, also to gossip about John’s love life and how Sherlock was.
Mrs Hudson looked up and patted Sherlock’s shoulder, brushing some non-existent dust from his suit jacket “ready” she gave him a little smile “You look…” She grabbed his hand “ready” Sherlock nodded and hugged her softly, placing a soft kiss on her cheek “Shall we?” She pulled his hand and Sherlock followed
“Mister Watson” Irene greeted, with her honeyed voice “So nice to meet the man that has my Sherlock captured” She smirked and Sherlock wanted to kill her
When their minds finally reconnected with their bodies, Sherlock helped John clean up and kissed him chastely on the cheek “Nice to meet you, Mister?” Sherlock smirked.
They arrived to Angelo’s and the greeting was nothing John could’ve expected. A man practically launched himself to Sherlock and the young man simply smiled and tried, quite awkwardly to return the hug, though was more graceful when he returned the handshake.
“I can wait” Sherlock said, his eyes sad but understanding “I know we’ve just met, that we’re getting to know each other, but this” he waved his hand between them “Feels… right” His eyes brightened at John’s smile “I’ll understand if you say no, but you’re the only one that know all about me” Sherlock’s eyes turned sad once again, John nodded.
“I would have found you” John beamed at Sherlock and kissed his chin, just a brief touch of lips that electrified them both and left them breathless, staring at each other with want, need, lust and love.
Sherlock is the middle child “which explains everything” the doctor that tested them said. “Mycroft, your eldest, is a genius” The doctor smiled at Violet and Siger “At twelve, he has enough social skills to convince an Eskimo to buy an ice maker, or to run his own country” the doctor chuckled. “Your daughter” His eyes looked at little four year old Eurus and took a deep shaky breath “Is a genius too, and much like Mycroft, she has enough social skills to, well” the doctor scratched the back of his neck “have anyone do anything she might want to” His smile was a bit frightened and he actually shuddered when Eurus winked at him. “Sherlock, on the other hand…” The doctor said a bit… enraged. “Well, though a genius, he has the social skills of a rabid cat” The doctor almost snarled and received a glare from four of the five family members, Sherlock simply stared in the direction of the wall, counting how many breaths his father had taken, how many times his mother’s hand twitched, and just enjoying the memory of the doctor’s face when he had told him all about the nurse he had an affair with, a former male that had him convinced he was a good woman…
"Callistus" waits, perhaps the man will come, today he'll show his face, Hours go by, and "Callistus" heart fills with sorrow, a sudden rush of sadness, memories of a beach and a blond man in a garden come to his mind, yesterday's happiness has evaporated. Phares enters the room and announces he's been sold to the rich man that came last night, He will move to
Harry, on the other hand, wasn’t as pleased with what he called “my little bro’s antics”. He married shortly after John came out and simply shut John away from his life “I don’t want a fag close to my offspring” He had said to John after breaking his nose. His parents defended him, but it was too late, the only real Watson, the perfect one left him a little more shattered and broken, his back against the coffee table in the middle of the living room, a bleeding broken nose, several bruised ribs and his pride turned into something non-existent.
I feel it, once again, my chest aching, left shoulder, always the left shoulder. Which time is it this one? The tenth? The twelfth? But something is different now, he's still alive!
… They rocked together, the world making sense again. John moved, slowly at first, his mouth hungry for Sherlock’s skin, Sherlock’s hand finding solace in every inch of John’s skin he could reach…
He hid in his brother’s flat and walked to his brother’s room, the still lingering smell of Mycroft comforting him somewhat… He reached for the little box he had in his bag and took out the syringe… “It’s over” he said to the darkness and felt his throat close up tight… He was about to push the needle in his arm when he felt a soft breeze, a “don’t” whispered to the wind… the voice sounded like Mary, Mycroft, his parents, John, all at the same time… He threw the syringe away and crushed the ampoule down with his shoe
“Don’t worry, love” John pulled him to his lap and held him close “You just keep on being brilliant and we’ll show him who the freak is” John winked at him and kissed him softly.
“As soon as I arrive to London you and Rosie move in with me” John gaped and looked up at Sherlock, feeling like a fish out of the water, trying to catch a breath and reconnect his brain to his mouth.
Their little army of friends entered the flat after a sort text message from Sherlock. He wanted to share the moment with John and nobody else, which is why they’d been waiting for the text message down at Speedy’s. As soon as they entered, they made teams of two and chose a room. Molly and Greg helped with the kitchen, Bill and Mike helped with the living room, while Eurus and her new boyfriend Jim -James Moriarty- got to work on their bedroom. John and Sherlock took care of Rosie’s room, deciding where the cot should go, placing the rocking chair near a table with a pink and yellow lamp, the small book case close to the cot and a white settee on the wall near the door. Sherlock had made an intelligent purchase, instead of buying several pieces of furniture, he managed to get a cot that became a changing table and could become a bed when needed. It also had enough storage space for her baby supplies and toiletries.
“But I do have to work” John countered, even though all he wanted was take the first plane to France and be with Sherlock.
“I should have known” John huffed but smiled fondly at her “Here” He handed Rosie. “Be back at four. Thanks” He hugged her briefly and ran down the stairs to go to class.
“It was nice watching you sleep” Sherlock smiled fondly at John “You look really relaxed” He bit his lower lip, eyes downcast “But I think I should let you rest after this feeding” Sherlock looked at John as if hoping he would say no.
Barely able to walk, raging erections tenting their trousers, they ended up in a little hostel near the train station, clothes went flying around, shoes followed trousers, pants followed shirts…. A quick hump to relieve the tension, a quick orgasm followed by apologetic kisses and caresses, the build-up, the want, the need…
Since that night, and thereafter, Greg became one of Sherlock’s biggest supporters and even offered to off Victor after what he had done, the young man smiled and shook his head softly before going back to his usual scowl and saying “Stop talking nonsense, Lestrade, and get me a cold case”, before turning his back to the soon to be sergeant and running up the stairs to his bedroom.
John looked down for a moment and then back at Rosie “I don’t know… Maybe I’ll be moving in with Sherlock. Mary and I talked about it, we were going to stay married for a year and then divorce, get the chance to fall in love, to move on. We were pretty clear that the wedding was a sham, just to get her parents of her case. I never imagined…” John rubbed his temple.
Once she calmed down enough John made her look up “How?” He asked and she understood the whole meaning of the question. She would tell her parents that John was the father; after much consideration she couldn’t think of a better father for her baby, he was sweet, loving, caring, and she knew, somehow, he’ll be there for them, as a father figure for the baby and as a loving and caring friend for her. Mary knew John Watson was the perfect guy-to-go, the one to “blame” for the “little bundle of joy” that was currently growing and residing in her belly.
He was also glad that because of Mary’s death -not that he was glad she died- he was able to meet John. After the interview, he couldn’t help but admire his bravery and his sense of duty; he was baffled by the story and even more so when John asked not to tell Rosie’s grandparents that the baby wasn’t his. With Mycroft’s help, Greg had managed to avoid any unpleasant requests from the baby’s father.
“Sherlock” John licked his lips again and met his eyes and stared for a long moment before looking down again to Rosie when she moved “I’m John” He said.
Once alone, Sherlock pulled John in a tight hug and kissed his cheek “Welcome home” he murmured against John’s ear and felt him shiver, but John was too jealous and angry to accept Sherlock’s demonstrations of affection. He didn’t want to ruin their first night, but at the same time he couldn’t let jealousy build up.
“Why didn't you tell me?” Sherlock snarled, trying to keep his voice low, minding his daughter asleep on the sofa
As they walked along the garden to get to the house, John was marvelled -more astonished- with the size of the grounds; when the house came to view, his astonishment turned into curiosity, because the size of the house was nothing compared to the sumptuous gardens. The house was relatively small, two stories, large windows, not a grandiose entrance. When they entered, John found the house comfortable, cosy, he felt as if he had arrived home.
Promptly, at one o’clock, the doorbell rang and John could hear his mother’s muffled voice from downstairs when Mrs. Hudson opened the door and introduced herself as their landlady. His heart jumped in his chest and he glanced nervously at Sherlock.
John hit send and put the phone in his pocket and felt for the paper he had there. He wondered how Sherlock would react if he were to write to him now. He looked for him on the internet and found and interesting blog “The science of deduction”. He read it by bits and snippets while feeding Rosie and laughed at the prospect of finding 243 different types of ash interesting and exciting.
Catastrophe struck the peaceful soul-haven. A new being evolved and changed the face of the earth. At first, the changes went unnoticed, a few souls wandering alone, then together once again, then... Then, taking forms, making thoughts, being alone longer, longer than longer.
Lunch time came and went and they shared some food in a café near the park and walked some more, Rosie was ready for her nap and they walked back to Baker Street, planning the meeting with the Watsons. They took advantage of Rosie´s nap to make dinner, clean the bathroom and doing the laundry, putting up some more books, catching up on cold cases, with Sherlock calling workers to start on C and John reading some of his medical material.
Not having his baby around came both as a blessing and as a curse. John was moody and nobody wanted to be close to him. His flatmates, Mike and Bill avoided him the entire week, Molly walked on eggshells and Sarah, his earliest and latest admirer, finally -hopefully- understood he didn’t want to be with her in any fashion. He lashed out to several people, was rude to a couple of lecturers and by Friday afternoon he snapped and was almost thrown out of the lecture.
“Let us get settled. I’ll get Rosie from his parents and we can plan something; I’ve to ask him first, but I think we could do lunch in a couple of days, you can come and see the flat, make sure Rosie has her own room and maybe help me taking care of her again?” John offered, hoping his mother would say yes.
Molly pretended to receive a visit from Sherlock while babysitting Rosie and having John picking her up at the same time.
Hey there!  I just had some free time, yay! Sorry for the delay, work is crazy. To my few, faithful readers, I thank you for following my silly fics. Happy Sherlock!
Life was busy, raising a baby, studying, going to university, working part time jobs and having a healthy relationship. In spite of barely having time to eat or sleep, they managed to have a date day every week, going for Chinese, to Angelo’s, sharing a night out, for the sake of their relationship.
“Too thin” John mumbled against his lips, running a hand over his bare back before kissing him heatedly again
“You endanger her every chance you have, John” Julia replied, not caring the face her son made “You took her to visit some strangers, to France nonetheless, without telling us, you claim you have a boyfriend, which we haven’t met, not to mention you lied to us, telling us that she was your baby” Julia was in the brim of tears but John couldn’t care less.
"We were very close to meeting each other." He smiles, oh how I love that smile. "I didn't know you, yet somehow, I knew you were somewhere, out there, waiting for me." I brush a curl away and look into those ocean like eyes, "loving me as much as I love you."
“Holmes” Sherlock could help but laugh “Sherlock Holmes” he kissed John passionately again “Hungry?” Sherlock panted.
As for Mycroft, Sherlock had avoided John meeting big brother since they first got acquainted. Mycroft had teased him the day of the wedding about his “lust at first sight” to which Sherlock had rebutted with a snarky comment of Mycroft being off his diet and how Alicia felt about a flabby stomach, Mycroft sneered something nasty in his direction about Victor dumping him for his frigidness, which Sherlock had returned with the reasons behind Anthea’s refusal to Mycroft’s marriage proposal.
“She did?” Sherlock opened his eyes and grabbed his tea cup, downing the lukewarm beverage in one go.
In his mind, Sherlock felt guilty of everything, even inviting John into his life… If only he hadn’t accepted the phone that first day, none of this would have happened, he wouldn’t have spent two years of his life fighting to keep John alive, he wouldn’t have endured lack of sleep, torture, hunger…
“Not yet” Sherlock shook his head again and held her hand, closing the gap between them and planting a kiss on her cheek “If you need to, lease it” He sighed and she shook her head. John was silent witness to the exchange and couldn’t help but smile and look dazed and pleased when Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson or when she acted lovingly towards him. By nine, Sherlock hailed a cab and helped John with Rosie’s stuff.
"Callistus" feels, for the first time in many years, he feels, even the cold leaves his body. Every inch of his skin tingles, his mouth still savours the man he had this afternoon, he usually performs one act, never two or three, not even if they pay him to. The deed usually takes 40 minutes, between preparations and the mandatory cleaning; he then rests for 20 minutes and receives the next one. But today, he stayed with the same man for hours -not even getting paid, he returned the money to the stranger- and he enjoyed it. He wanted more.
I'm a day late... I know... No excuses except procrastination to post. I've been down the slope (as English native speakers say... I hope). This month is quite hard for me and I've been trying to use my writing as a coping mechanism but nothing is working... I would like to say that loosing a father figure is easy to put behind, but it actually sucks, much more when that figure wasn't exactly the man that procreated you, but the one that choose you as a daughter... (Which is why the John and Sherlock in this story are so in love with little Rosie) He was my best friend, the hand I held when I was scared, sick, when I felt alone, when I cried of a broken heart or a scraped knee. He thaught me that my ideas were worth exploring, that my writing was worth writing, that I could do whatever I put my mind to. Sorry for the unexpected gush of emotions, but I haven't found the strenght to continue writing and I had to tell you why... I can't even pick the pen because I find myself lost in the emptyness of not having him reading whatever stupid thing I write... or admiring whatever stupid thing I paint or printing whatever stupid thing I photograph... I'm committing to the story, I'm going to finsih it, but the updates might be a bit... disorganized and random... until I get the muse back. Thank you all, and sorry fot this note. Love you all. Happy Sherlock!
Molly was James’ friend too, they had met at party in James’ house and he had kissed her in his basement, once, during a “seven minutes in heaven” game. She wanted to kiss John, but Sarah had asked for that honour first so she had to kiss James. She saw the opportunity to get to know John when Mary came to study in their school and became friends with John instantly; to her dismay, John was dating James, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be her friend.
So... I had a bit of time in my hectic day. Working twenty one days in a row is killing me!!! But I do hope you enjoy this chapter and forgive my many mistakes. Thank you for reading and Happy Sherlock!
John on the other hand, was adamant on teaching her to be well behaved, polite, caring, loving. She would say “pease” and “thanks” whenever she asked for something or received something, she would say “hi” and “bye”, she would be quiet when told so and would listen to her grandparents, the most amorous little girl ever; the only person she would misbehave with will be Sherlock, who would allow her to do whatever she wanted, especially when she would call him “my daddy”
John was ready for everything; he prepared himself mentally to accept whatever may come his way. He walked slowly, taking deep breaths, thinking of Mary’s smile, of her face when he accepted to help her, how relieved she looked when John held her and told her he’ll be there to tell her parents together. What John didn’t know was that Mary’s parents, Rosamund and Alex Morstan would be so -pissed off was a mild term for what they were- angry, baffled, irate, livid… Alex Morstan even threatened to kill him but John managed to talk him down with just a few words.
Just in case you’re a bit lost, I followed canon for the birthdays and some dates. Sherlock’s birthday is January 6th, John’s July 7th. John is two years older than Sherlock, unlike canon where John is the same age as Mycroft. Molly is in an advance class where she met Mary. Molly is a year younger than Mary and a year older than Eurus. Since Eurus is a genius too, she’s ahead at school and shares classes with Molly. Molly is the same age as Sherlock. Also, John is starting his second year in med school and Sherlock his third year of Chemistry in Oxford. John started university in October right after his 18th birthday before Mary got pregnant and is now in his second year, which started before his wedding.
“That can be arranged” Sherlock smirked “The weekend after next” He grinned “Did you checked your timetable?”
“John?” Mycroft lifted his head when he heard John walking down the stairs, the baby in his arms and three bags over his shoulders. John looked at him and waited “Need a lift?” Mycroft asked; his voice uncharacteristically small and insecure.
Mycroft sighed, relieved, not because his brother wasn’t having sex, though in a way he was glad he hadn’t rushed to it, but because John loved his brother enough to not force or rush him; he was willing to wait, as long as needed, for Sherlock to be ready and take that step in their relationship.
In the meantime, Sherlock and John raised Rosie, created a routine that worked for them as a little family that was growing together. Being so young they didn’t have much rush to live their lives, they wanted to grow together. Their routine consisted on Rosie waking them up early in the morning, they both getting her ready, whenever time gave them the opportunity; that is when John didn’t have a night shift or Sherlock hadn’t been working on a case. Having breakfast together, no matter how tired they were or how much John wanted to sleep or Sherlock to keep working, they’ll have breakfast with Rosie. After breakfast a quick clean up, followed by Sherlock filling charts about her progress and John taking photos for the baby album.
and stood there with his hand on the fake veranda.   He knew the song by heart now and he knew when to sway and when to bend, but today, even though he tried to focus and “act his part” as requested, he couldn’t, his mind was elsewhere. Sure he moved and swayed, he sang and danced but his mind was definitely elsewhere, his mind was in the stranger that had come to see him perform the last couple of weeks…
He groans inwardly, not wanting to wake his bed mate and tries to roll -but all he can roll without feeling it in his entire body- are his eyes, as he realizes how flowery he’s just been. Thinking like a swooned maiden that has been kissed for the first time by the chivalrous gentleman she has been in love for the last 29 chapters… He wants to berate himself for being so sappy, but he can’t help the giddy sensation run down his entire body whenever he closes his eyes and feels -simply feels- what John has done to his body.
, his aunt Livia is waiting for them with fruit tarts for his birthday, He eats as much as he's able, thanks aunt Livia and leaves to his room, his lute his sole companion.
“Am I supposed to be okay with what you did?” He kept his voice low, he didn’t want his mother finding about what happened yesterday.
My John sighs and looks at me, a small smile on his beautiful lips. He licks them and I'm lost, it's so hard to concentrate when he does that. He reaches for my hand and squeezes it softly. I think we're done, but he starts to talk.
“What?” Even in the position he was Sherlock maintained his cool demeanour, even though he was trembling “Tell you the truth?” He chuckled darkly “You’ve never been good at handling the truth; everything has to be sugar-coated for you. You’re always the victim, the one that suffers, that never gets a chance to be happy… Your happiness always depends on others, never on you… Nice thing never being responsible for your own actions” He grabbed John’s trembling wrists and removed them from his collar “Lucky you to always have somebody to blame for whatever goes wrong with your life” Sherlock pushed him away
“Oh” Julia Watson gaped at her son. The silence that fell between them was deafening. John looked at Sherlock, begging with his eyes for him to do something
. He looked at the blond and his mind would wander to all the things he’d like to be done to him by that tongue currently travelling over those thin lips.
“You don’t exhaust yourself, you eat, you sleep and you keep playing your violin and continue with your dance lessons” John kissed Sherlock’s hands, trying to keep his touches as chaste as possible, they’d been dating for two weeks!
The tummy ache -which soon escalated to full vomiting and fever- was diagnosed as rotavirus. They stayed with her in hospital for a few hours until the doctors had calmed her down; after that, they each took turns to stay up with her while the other rested for the next four days. No cases, no studying, no working, just Rosie. Their entire life is wrapped in hers.
“I’m sorry” John thought of a fast excuse, “I’ve been busy” He lied and berated himself for not admitting he was hurt.
“I saw you at the wedding” Victor said, responding the question he thought he saw in Sherlock’s eyes, before he could say anything Victor continued “I didn’t know you knew John” He shrugged and Sherlock inhaled a deep breath at John’s name “I wanted to talk to you that day but with the murder…” He rubbed a hand on the back of his neck and kept his eyes downcast, unable to look at Sherlock.
The way the lovers find themselves breathless with longing and desire, and somehow find heaven in their release, must be part of fantasies created by writers that long for a memorable night of pure and undiluted lust and love. They have to be, because right now, Sherlock feels as if he’s escaped from a romantic, salacious and lascivious novel, because his first time with John -amazing, beautiful, wonderful… not enough adjectives to describe him- Watson, belong in a romantic novel, to be guarded, saved for posterity in the history of humankind, as the most wonderful, most amazing, most incredible, simply the most… -not enough adjectives to describe it- first time in history, written or otherwise.
Sherlock turned, sensing him and gave him a smile, John approached them and could see Rosie fighting sleep, lost in Sherlock’s eyes; she tried to grab John but she was too tired to even move her arms. “She misses you, you know?” John smiled a bit sadly.
“And he started harassing you before or after?” John had to check his facts before he punched the lights out of Anderson.
Marcus is walking to the window, but an ill placed stool makes him trip. Paulla runs to him and helps him up. They share an awkward smile, Marcus delivers the parcel, collects his money and leaves.
John looked at the stage, a bit disinterested; he nodded and stifled another yawn, covering it behind his drink. John tried not to be bored, he pretended he was interested in what was happening, but watching a bunch of men doing what he considered the straightest play in the world wasn’t exactly his cup of tea. The stage filled with several characters and he browsed the playbill, pretending to be interested.
John picked her up, still astonished by her actions, Sherlock following close, eyes dazed and looking at the little girl as if he was looking at a miracle unravel in front of his eyes. “I guess we’re going out” John said, still dazed and Sherlock just nodded.
“Yes” Sherlock nodded and kept his eyes on the people walking outside the window, his mind providing information relentlessly “She said I could have the flat” He mumbled.
At fifteen, Sherlock confessed his attraction towards Victor to his sister; Eurus just shrugged and said, as nonchalantly as she was able “Already knew it”. Sherlock looked at her wide eyed and gaped several times “Don’t worry Bee” She whispered close to his ear “Secret’s safe with me” and she winked in his direction before leaving him alone. At sixteen, he couldn’t control his attraction anymore, but he was rewarded with the best of news when Victor kissed him for the first time in Mummy’s greenhouse. The kiss smelled like mummy’s roses and gardenias and it sounded like the buzzing bees that flew around the flowers. Sherlock was ecstatic, a huge smile on his lips. He told Eurus all about it and she warranted she’ll keep the secret until he was ready to tell Mummy and Papa.
I know... Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Procrastination and second chackra blockage... Two chapter today... Love you all and happy Sherlock!
John left the interrogation room and followed Lestrade to his office; he was tired and all he wanted was a hot bath, climb to bed with Rosie and sleep for a week; but at the same time, all he wanted was to find the force of nature that had infested his dreams -in the best possible way- for the past three days, he wanted to see Sherlock Holmes again. To his dismay, the boy was nowhere to be seen and the Sergeant explained to a disappointed John that the boy, well, man, he was referring to had to go back to school, in Oxford. The news crashed in his ears and crushed his body like a lorry. Lestrade eyed him curiously and as John blushed, Lestrade smirked and handed him a phone number “Just in case you need any help” he said, and winked at the man.
“One last kiss and I have to go…” John tried to pry his body from the octopus-like embrace he was being held by
“What?” He looked at him and thanked the heavens that they started with seemingly small talk “Being a single parent, losing my best friend, or having to take care of a little baby?”
I feel relaxed, that's a first, watching Rosie too, concentrating on her helps with the sudden flashbacks. John sighs and I know he's thinking about the dreams. Ever since we "opened" our eyes -with a memorable first kiss- we've been sharing dreams.
“I already told you, I’ve talked to my professors, I’ll just have to present my project, deliver a compelling paper for each lecture and I could be done before next Michaelmas, including lab hours” He frowned “I might have to work over Summer break and I’ll be out of University by September” He looked at John as if willing him to say yes.
… He was in the tub, in dire need of a bath, a shave, some food and rest. His joints ached and for once, he wanted to sleep… He heard the door open and John’s familiar thread going up the stairs, carrying Rosie and a bag, it seemed. He enjoyed the hot water for another second and remembered his clothing wasn’t exactly clean. He was about to leave the tub when John entered the bathroom…
Seventeen, perhaps younger, two kids for the count and a third on the way -not you- not yet anyway-. The minute I saw her I felt... love... such a deep love, and fear, so much fear... I lost you that day without knowing who you were, or why I felt the way I felt. I had no idea of you...
A clear of the throat later, Sherlock was pulled out of his reverie and his mother was grinning at him, he rolled his eyes and covered the baby again, even though the flat was warm, he didn’t want her catching a cold in the early days of spring. “Mummy, this is Rosie” He put the baby’s back to his chest and held her close, like a little treasure “Rosie, this is my mum” He said to the now very awake baby.
That Friday, he gave his last exam and left University feeling the happiest he had ever felt since he started dating John. It had taken him less than four months to finish University and he felt quite proud of himself, mostly because it meant he had managed to finish something as utterly boring as University. He arrived to London four hours after his last exam, having packed everything he needed and after giving notice to his landlord he left his Oxford flat for the last time. The first person he contacted was Mrs. Hudson -he had already given Baker Street as his address to the moving team- and she was expecting him.
John was tired; he had an argument with one of the nurses during his last surgery and he almost made a mistake; fortunately for him, he was able to clamp the artery and do and emergency intervention, saving the patient’s life and his kidney. The nurse had handed him, a bit forcefully, the wrong instrument, and he hadn’t checked what he had in his hand until it was almost too late and he almost nicked the artery instead of clamping it.
“Mum just left” John rubbed his eyes with both his hands “She cleaned my room, said I should find a place of my own” He took a deep breath “She even proposed taking Rosie away from me” He ran a hand over his hair tiredly “Said I should find a nice girl to share the responsibility” He put his hands to either side of his face and looked up, shaking his head and trying to calm down “When I told her about you she threatened me with taking Rosie away, so I had to tell her the truth”
They were having so much fun, the celebrated as if today was the last day of their lives. Bill had suggested they left London, for something different to do, instead of visiting the same usual places.
“See what happens when you follow your prick?” John was furious, pacing around in the smallest room he’d been since he was a teenager.
Sherlock occupied his time studying and doing some time in the lab, thinking about John and all the missed opportunities for kissing the man he had dreamt about the last month. He wanted to be with him, but at the same time, managing a long distance relationship meant not being there all the time. He had already experienced what it was to be apart when he dated Victor.
They walked hand in hand back to John’s shared flat. To Sherlock’s surprise, John had packed most of his and Rosie’s things; the thought of John deciding to move in with him before the whole money, houses and titles had Sherlock’s heart bursting out of his chest and his stomach flipping and turning wildly.
“Sherlock’s sister” Molly clarified “She knows about you” She giggled but after a huff from John contained herself.
John pulled the hair, he needed to kiss that neck again… the moan that escaped that sensuous mouth was sinful, the dancer… Sherlock, was down on his knees, eyes wide open, lustful, mouth wet, angry red, almost purple, kissed and kissable…. John pulled him up and continued kissing and caressing…
“You’re not a freak, love.” John was running his fingers on Sherlock’s curls as they sat together on the sofa sharing Chinese
“Would you like to have breakfast? Sherlock asked before he closed the door. John nodded and waved a goodbye, looking back at the man he so wanted to kiss.
“I’ll be waiting” The card read and was signed “John”. Sherlock smiled and held the card to his lips, it smelled manly and all he could think about was the look in John’s eyes. He changed and cleaned the glitter and the oil from his body, he ran a hand over his curls, trying to tame them and put on his bespoke suit. He was about to walk out of the dressing room when a few knocks startled him “Not going with you tonight, Victor” He said as he opened the door, and there he was, the man himself.
He knew he shouldn’t do it over the phone, he knew it wasn’t the correct thing to do, but he also knew that if he faced John he would accept everything and will stay in a loveless relationship with the only man he had ever loved. With trembling hands he composed a text, a reply to John’s excuse…
“WHAT?” John was enraged; one thing is hate him for what he did and another having Mary arrested for trying to talk to him.
It was a sweet surrender, and they both were more than willing to fall apart together. Sleep found them in a tangled mess of limbs, arms and legs, fingers, mouths, dark curls and sandy hair. Food forgotten; nothing needed more than each other and what had just happened between them; that sensation of fullness and completeness filling their veins and making their hearts beat as one.
“Don’t be crass, Sherlock” Mycroft scolded “And no. You know I’m not like that” He picked on some invisible lint from his jacket sleeve.
“Yes…” Sherlock bit his lower lip and tried to look at John but couldn’t and looked shyly to the side.
BTW, sorry if this chapter offends anybody, I don't mean any disrespect to religious beliefs or faith, I just write with a certain historic accuracy... I love history...
There was a talk to be had, obviously, discuss terms of entanglement, expectations, times and places, trains schedules, travels, Rosie and living arrangements. No sacrifices to be made, no hearts to be broken; clear words had to be spoken to avoid either. Dinner was in order; a little café would be the perfect setting, candle light, good food, great conversation and the two of them in the perfect mood to discuss what might be coming.
“Oh, I will” She laughed a bit wickedly and Sherlock just shook his head. “Have you told him you’re out of university?”
Sherlock startled, back to reality and focusing on the heat John’s hand produced in his body and how the warmth spread from his chest instead of his arm. “Sherlock, please” He managed to answer in a sigh.
Sherlock had visited a few times and had spent a few hours with Mike and Bill, they liked him and found him hilarious; Bill none the wiser to accept his lack of social skills as what they were, lack of knowledge, and Mike grinning at whatever Sherlock said because to him the man was just an amusing, outgrown toddler.
Sherlock stoically accepted the news, Irene was there to watch him crumble, after that, he focused on his classes and focused on forgetting the love he once had felt for a man that promised to be with him forever, but that had left him the moment he denied sex to him. Molly convinced Sherlock to come to the wedding, miss a couple of days from his Hilary and accompany her to Mary’s wedding. As an act of good faith, and because he was already ahead on his work for his third year, and probably advancing early to his fourth; Sherlock agreed.
As soon as they arrived to Orleans, a beautiful woman -looking like an older version of Eurus- greeted them.
“No” John shook his head “We already agreed” John wanted to say yes, but at the same time, he didn’t want to pressure Sherlock.
“Well…” John shrugged and made an annoyed face “It’s not a ride in the park for me either” Sherlock just glared at him and rolled his eyes “I’m here because Mrs. Hudson has gone mad and she locked us in here. If I could choose, I’ll be out of here already” John checked his phone and wasn’t surprised it had no signal… He let out an annoyed huff and threw it on the coffee table
As soulmates go, sometimes we're separated for longer periods of time than first planned; ever since humans became "sapiens"... as if "just thinking" has anything to do with "feeling"...
We part ways and then return to each other, we always find each other, but at times, more often now than ever, it takes many lifetimes for us to find each other...
“So is Donovan” Sherlock took another deep breath and tried to hide his smile behind a huff of disgust at the smell, taking great joy in their befuddled expressions.
A man beating down corpses; Me? I'm just waiting for my own turn to be beat down. And then, eyes the colour of the ocean look down at me; and I could feel, with my soul, how he mourns for my loss.
We souls share a particularity, or peculiarity? We... become... as soon as we're acknowledged as something, we become. We become... something... sometimes we're written, others, just imagined, and more often than not, we're born.
Mary finished with honours and sent a letter to the Cambridge Admissions Committee thanking them for her acceptance letter and basically pleading for a chance to hold the scholarship until the baby was at least a year old. The Committee agreed to wait for her under one condition; she’ll have to work to keep the scholarship.
“Rosie” John pursed his lips “She’s fine. Misses her mum but she’s fine. We manage” John rubbed her little back.
Sherlock just nodded; his eyes on Rosie all the time. Molly eyed him wickedly and before he knew it, she thrusted the baby in his arms and ran to the door. Baffled, completely out of his mind, he rushed after her and all Molly did was wave goodbye. “See you at three” She shouted and ran down the street.
"Feels like centuries have passed," he tries to smirk but I see the weariness in his eyes. Pulling him close, I run my fingers on his hair and he shivers, he's still sensitive from our afternoon tryst. I yawn and he looks down at me, with his smile that's just for me.
“Move in with him” Mike answered nonchalantly “You’ve been pinning over him since you met, almost six months ago” He continued “Rosie loves him, his parents are helping you with her, his sister managed to get your phone and she calls you regularly” Mike listed
They had also been exploring their relationship, talking about the future, about Rosie, about where their relationship is going. They talked about Sherlock finishing his doctorate and where to send Rosie for day care, her schooling and schedules. They also talked about John’s career, his work, and most importantly, his military career. This still was a sore subject and it usually went undiscussed, but since Mycroft proposed to Alicia, they’d been talking about marriage.
A few days later, Anderson was invited to work with the Police at the Yard, to his surprise; Sherlock was invited to work on the case too and he thought he might have an opportunity to show off, and while at it, to show the “little frigid bitch” who was boss. Suffice to say, his plan backfired and John got what he wanted, he punched the lights out of Anderson.
He scrambled out of the bed and looked at John “No” He snarled “Not like that” He rested his head on the bathroom door but didn’t dare to leave the room “You can’t just come in here and try to make me feel good, or needed, only to leave again when you think it convenient” He closed his eyes “I’m done with this, with you” Sherlock’s voice broke “I don’t want to be a replacement for…” He still couldn’t say her name “I don’t want to be just a body to warm you… or to satisfy your need” He was trembling “I don’t want this flat to be just a place for you to stay when convenient, or me becoming a sitter to your daughter while you… gallivant around” Sherlock finished with a shudder and he felt his knees about to give but held the door behind him
His mother, on the other hand, blamed television, video games, music, friends, even the air “that has changed so much since we were young, Henry” Julia Watson, unlike her husband, wanted to keep her son close “We can keep an eye on him, make sure no soldier gets his way with him” She had covered her mouth and John had to roll his eyes “You know how those soldiers are, all alone in those tents” She sighed sadly and Henry relented in his heart burning desire of making him a real Watson.
“I know” Sherlock scowled “I…” He blushed but remembered what Eurus said “I wanted to see you” He looked away, biting his lip, unable to face John.
He had to go pick up Rosie from her grandparents, Molly had offered to help and so had done Mike. He was walking to his parents’ house when he heard someone call his name. When John turned he saw James, but instead of his heart jumping in his chest, his stomach churned and he felt a wave of something akin of disgust. He invited John for a coffee; he wanted to talk, “after what happened with Mary…” He bit his lower lip and John felt compelled to comply. “I was just thinking we could, reconnect” He said, looking down.
“I’m already done with my lab hours for the term” Sherlock said “If I take advantage of the Saturdays you have lectures I could finish my graduation project in less than a month” He argued, not heatedly but strongly “Besides, most of my lectures are boring” He jutted his lower lip and looked like a five year old having a strop.
"Like sleep, it also involves a bed," his voice melts my insides, my breath hitches and he smirks. "Bastard." I whisper and he just gives me a lopsided smile. I rub his scalp soothingly as a long and faded memory tries to emerge. Sherlock, my genius, senses it and effectively distracts me, kissing that spot on my neck that renders me senseless to everything but him. I'm lost in him, in me, in the kiss, in the need for more, in the now...
Usually, more often than not, the phrase refers to an action, generally involving sex between two (sometimes more than, but who am I to judge?) people. But when you're a being, without a defined form or a determined sex, do you make love?
. Beautiful city, incredible fishing spots, amazing beaches. Two souls that find each other, without knowing their journey together, in this world, has just started.
Once they left Tesco, John hoped for Sherlock to be more relaxed, he could see his jaw tightening as time went by, resolving it was the last time he would put Sherlock to the tiring and trying aisles of Tesco -as Sherlock so eloquently put it- although he knew it was about lunch with his family. In the walk back home, Sherlock’s mood went further south and he complained about the weather, hour of the day, the brightness -or lack thereof- of the sun. John simply shook his head and rolled his eyes, concentrating on his own nervousness.
“Marry me.” John said and watched as Sherlock’s face went through a myriad of emotions at the same time, from joy to utter disbelief, followed by shock and then realisation, all within a few seconds. Sherlock stood quietly, not saying a word, looking like a deer in headlights, John worried; it seemed that he wasn’t even breathing.
Mycroft had said he had fallen in lust at first sight, but Sherlock had figured -after a quite thorough wank- that it was more than just lust, because John consumed his every thought even more than Victor had done at the time; although,
“I have business to attend here in London” Sherlock continued talking as they made their way out of the house “After all I’m just here for the weekend” He said and felt his stomach drop.
Rosie’s room was done in a short time; they settled the little girl in her cot with a few plush toys, including a ladybug, a bumblebee and a honeybee that Sherlock had purchased for her, while they fixed her clothes, toys, pictures, books and baby proofed he room, placing outlet covers and hiding electrical cords, the also placed safety gates at the top of the stairs and the always needed doorstops, not before they secured all the furniture, to avoid anything falling on her.
We "first" met a long time ago. He was already dead and I carried bodies. I didn't recognise him at first. I was blind with rage. Rage to find that he's died from an arrow to the left shoulder. Very well placed the damn thing was... nicked an artery in an artful way.
John called Mike to see if he was free that afternoon to help him with Rosie, when the call went to voice mail, John cursed his luck and called Greg.
John looked at the time and all he wanted was to sleep but still had the 10 pm feeding and nappy change.
“Tomorrow?” Sherlock looked down at the table. The moment turned a bit awkward, but before Sherlock could ask, Billy, the waiter came with their food.
Sherlock resented the situation but was able to provide comfort in the form of his parents. Violet and Siger Holmes had fallen utterly in love with the little girl and had offered to take care of her whenever John were out of his depth, which was almost every day. John accepted gladly, of course he did, because that meant Rosie would be well cared for and kept safe for as long as needed.
“Are you ready?” Greg asked. He no longer looked as sad as he did a few months ago, he was dating Molly now; she had managed to take care of him, to bring him back to life after… John nodded and smiled at his friend “He’s waiting” Greg nodded to the door and John took a deep breath and fixed his tie for the last time
“So…” Mike was looking at John with serious eyes “Has he popped your cherry yet?” He barely managed not to laugh. John blushed and bit his lower lip, looking away from his friends. Mycroft knew that John told them everything about his one night stands.
I had to give you something, brief as it was; after all, you've waited for so long. As the writer, I can give them a brief respite.
“I can’t do it like this anymore…” John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles; taking the opportunity life was giving him “I was so afraid to tell you…” He sighed and looked at Sherlock’s blueish-greenish eyes and got lost in them “I was so afraid that if you knew I was… failing… you’ll leave me again…” John confessed and Sherlock pulled him into a hug
"Truly old scores and resentments." John bites his lower lip trying not to laugh, but I can see the mirth in his eyes.
John grabbed him by his lapels and shook him violently, he wanted to punch him “Don’t you ever” He snarled
“Sherlock” the man said and patted his back repeatedly “Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and your date”
Molly had another friend, Eurus Holmes, the gracious little sister of Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes. They met at nursery school and had been friends for the best part of fifteen years. Yes, Eurus is a genius, but the kind of genius that’s able to convince anyone to do anything, really, so Molly was convinced to be Eurus’ best friend for life. When Molly was fourteen, she was love struck, she fell immediately for the lanky, thin and gracious, raven curly headed boy. She loved his scowl, his newly developed baritone voice, the way he walked, talked and mocked everyone he met. That crush saved her from the heartache caused by John’s confession that he was in love with James.
"I thought you might like it..." I chuckle, but he frowns, "being the only Consulting Detective and all..." I try as a joke, but I can see the despair in his eyes. "Sorry, love..." I mutter, mortified. He reaches for my hand, pulling me to sit on his lap.
Not for the first time, morning found them at the hospital, whether it was because Sherlock ran into a knife, a fist, a knee or a foot, or because John had a night shift and Sherlock would pick a sleeping Rosie and took her to get John back from work; but this night was different, Rosie was ill, nothing truly worrisome, but something that kept them on their toes for long hours.
John listened to the advice, said goodbye to Sherlock and he slept, soundly, for over two hours, Rosie on his chest. At 10 pm, at the clock, Rosie woke up and demanded attention; and as promised, Sherlock was there to accompany John while he feed his daughter. They chatted until both Rosie and John fell asleep. Sherlock didn’t want to close the screen and watched them sleep until tiredness overtook him and he slept soundly until Rosie’s cries woke him up at three in the morning.
James walked out of John’s room throwing the door and stomping down the stairs. John sat on his bed, head in his hands, trying to stop the tears that were falling from his eyes; he tried to breath deep but it hurt in impossible ways, his lungs felt as if they were on fire, but at the same time it felt like breathing icy wind. Mary arrived twenty minutes after John texted her and she simply held her friend close and heard him cry.
“She needs attention twenty four seven” Sherlock continued “Mummy and Father had offered to take care of her while we study and so has Mrs. Hudson. I assume your Mum will want to meet me properly before we take another step and she will be right” John nodded again, his smile faltering “I assume your family might not be that happy, but…” Sherlock had to shrug, he didn’t care “They might say we’re too young, but they were willing to marry you to a girl they thought you had impregnated” Sherlock looked at John apologetically; Mary was a sore point still.
I sit comfortably on my chair, we're done with the repairs and my John has moved back with me. We're still settling at home, at Baker Street, and now we're talking more than ever, I have decided to tell him all about my memories. It's time, and I know he'll understand. I'm sure he will.
After a month of coward distance, Sherlock was summoned to London by Lestrade, something to do with a cold case he had helped solve; Sherlock texted back a simple “fine”. That Friday, after his last lecture of the morning, he boarded the 1:11 pm to Marylebone; yes, he hated having to travel twenty more minutes to the Yard, but he had to go to Baker Street; he had a client there and was imperative he interviewed Martha Hudson. The minute he arrived to London, another text from Lestrade took him out of his reverie
"Lost chances," I mutter, just to say something. Sherlock looks at me and I can see all he wants to say. I make myself nod again and he stands, takes his violin and plays that tune he played when we almost met.
Silas is to marry tomorrow. He received father's blessing this morning, and now he's supposed to be getting ready for bed, but sleep is the last thing on his mind. He clings to his tunic and inhales deeply, it still smells of jasmine, it still smells of him... And yet, even though he feels... deeply... tomorrow he's to become a husband. Silas' night goes slowly, he closes his eyes and sees the lines of the body he's had a few hours earlier and for a few hours. The deep baritone ringing in his ears, the silky raven curls making his fingertips tingle, that sinful mouth, all he could see from the man's face.
They finally opened the door only to find Mary laying on a pool of blood, her wedding gown torn to pieces, her shoes missing, hair in disarray, hands over her head, no signs of struggle, except for the chair that fell with the weight of her body as she fell to the floor. Alex put his hand to his mouth and fell to his knew, his baby girl was lying dead on the floor. Rosamund fainted and Henry could barely hold her before John caught Rosie in his arms, Julia was stunned and nailed to the floor, unable to move or speak.
“I don’t want to interrupt” John’s voice was clipped, his breathing short “I’ll call you when I can” He said but Sherlock stopped him.
Used real names and timetables from Oxford and Queen and timetables for trains, departures, arrivals and platforms.
“Yes” Violet worried at her son calling her and most of all asking if she was in London. “Sherlock, dear. Are you okay?” She tried to keep the panic at bay but fearing the worst.
"Callistus'" real name was Nathan. Was, because he died the day his mother died and his uncle sold him as a slave, ending up in a clandestine brothel, his body for food and housing. His new name was given to him by the owner, he had
He was also aware that they lacked time, that John had shifts, Sherlock had cases, Rosie was their priority, and they also made time for school, work, friends, family… life… Between cases, shifts and nappy changes, they were on the wait.
He was ready for a new relationship, after all, Victor had ended things with him almost a year ago, and he wasn’t exactly interested in anybody.
… His name in John’s voice filled with need and lust was all Sherlock needed to come like he had never done in his life, a second later he could feel John's warmth fill him from the inside... he closed his eyes and let his bliss-filled brain turn off for a moment. When he opened them again, John was smiling down at him, one kiss to his forehead and Rosie’s giggles invading the room…
“You were at the lab for four hours?” John was baffled; he couldn’t remember the last time he was in a lab for so long.
Sherlock was done. He packed a bag, went down the stairs and walked out the flat, not looking back. As he climbed in the cab he received a text, it was him, with the same excuse ‘late because of work’, but Sherlock knew better… John had been receiving texts at odd hours, coming back late from work and had picked a new annoying way to get rid of Sherlock, blaming him for Mary’s death…
“Boring” Sherlock shrugged and stopped, making John halt and turn to look at him questioningly. “I have to tell you something” Sherlock looked at John in that intense way that made John squirm. John closed his eyes, preparing for the worst when he felt Sherlock’s hand on his cheek, caressing softly, urging him, silently, to open his eyes again “Nothing too bad, don’t worry” Sherlock smiled softly and John took a deep breath.
John simply huffed and left the room, leaving Bill and the gang laughing their hearts out; he’d had to endure a whole day of jokes at his expense, because the young lady he had spent the night with was a screamer… he had barely touched her and she was already moaning like she was about to orgasm… Bloody teenagers…
“Remember I told you he asked me to live with him when he finished University?” John let out a huff and drank half the lager in one long pull.
My "horse"... the horse. How many years does it have now? Thousands, I think... That was the first time I made an attempt to "write" about him and what he had done to the horse... "Experiment" ha called it... Suffice to say it ended up a wonderful red...
A lazy Sunday. Rosie is playing on the new rug with the bee I gave her for her first birthday. She giggles every time the bee buzzes and lightly vibrates in her tiny hands.
Eurus was sent to France too. Vivienne Holmes, Father’s Mother had demanded the presence of her grandchildren at her house as soon as school was over; even Mycroft was “gently” asked to visit -more like forced to attend Mamie’s call- his grandmother and ask for a few days out work. Siger and Violet accompanied their children, they were summoned as well.
He lowered his violin and bow and looked at his sister. He had managed, or at least he hoped, to deceive her, successfully changing the subject. ‘The game is on’ He thought as he tried to concentrate in what was to come.
“This was staged” Sherlock rapid-fired and walked past John, brushing his shoulder with his arm and feeling how his body tingled at the small contact, he heard John’s breath hitch and felt a little victorious at noticing the boy was interested in him. He could barely breath, he felt his heart beat fast in his chest, a caged animal trying to run free, a shiver down his spine and the want to kiss those lips, to have his hands travel all over the body in front of him.
“And I love you, John Watson, my husband” Sherlock surrendered to the kiss and before John made him moan and whimper he whispered one last word “Forever”
The amount of cigarettes consumed by Sherlock the weeks after Victor, had Mycroft biting his nails, he was desperate to find a way to help his brother, but thankfully for him, it appeared in the form of Irene Adler, which became, unknowingly -and probably unwillingly- the anchor that kept his brother afloat. They had met during Sherlock’s first year and she was the only constant his brother had during his early Oxford years.
Once they overcame the shock and Greg left them alone under false pretences, Sherlock made the first move and asked him if he wanted some coffee. John nodded and Sherlock brought back the perfect cup of black coffee, no sugar and just a hint of milk. He wondered how Sherlock knew, but after hearing him solve Mary’s case in less than a minute, he knew he shouldn’t be surprised with his insight about him.
“I haven’t captured anyone” John said, annoyed with the woman and the conversation “Look” He took a deep breath “I have things to do…” He started but Irene cut him off.
Afternoon for John was almost unbearable. He couldn’t believe all the opportunities he had of kissing Sherlock and he had taken none. His mother noticed he was distracted but chose not to ask. His good mood and smiles made up for his distraction. He managed, somehow, to survive the afternoon with his family and plan the best schedule to be with Rosie. His mum fussed around him, asking how he’d been, where he’d been, how was his Saturday, why he didn’t call or came by.
John realised that Sherlock was right, that he wasn’t worthy of such a man, such a caring human being, a man that had sacrificed his life for him many times in many ways and not once had asked for anything in return, not even the love he more than deserved. John felt ashamed and decided right there and then that he wouldn’t look for Sherlock Holmes again, that Sherlock deserved to be loved, cherished and cared for and that he wasn’t ready to give him what he deserved
“Love, I accept it’s over, I understand why now… I’m really sorry I couldn’t be the man you deserve, the man you need, the man you want… I’m really sorry…” his voice broke and he let the dam crumble “I’m not man enough to love you… I never was…” He choked on the last word “I’ll never be” he sobbed and tried to breathe “I love you, Sherlock, forever… Even if I don’t know how” He ended the call and walked back to Baker Street, packed all his belongings and called Anthea
The kiss didn’t let him sleep that night, he felt wrong, not because he had hated Sarah’s hands, or lips, or her taste, but because he had seen James right before he entered the closet and all he could think about while holding still for Sarah’s lips was him. The thought startled him at first, thinking about a boy while kissing a girl, was it normal? Was it right? Was he a good Watson? Harry had a girlfriend by now, a fellow university student called Clara; the eight years difference even more noticeable now with Harry about to become a lawyer and engaged to be married with “beautiful, sweet Clara”, which made him “the perfect Watson”. Oh how John wanted to be the perfect Watson…
They made some small talk on the way, John telling Sherlock how his lecture went, about the military, the letter he’d received and how the people at the RAMC told him they would wait. Sherlock let out a relieved sigh when he heard John wasn’t joining the military, at least not yet. Sherlock told John that he’ll be done with school in a year, that he was thinking on going into full detective work as soon as he finished, but that he was interested in studying a bit of forensic sciences before definitely dedicating his time to Detective work.
The day of the wedding John was there, holding HIS baby girl and waiting for Mary, his friends, including Victor and his new boyfriend, James -that was one awkward and quite hurtful encounter in their six degrees of separation- were waiting inside the church. Molly was there, her date was smoking a cigarette and he couldn’t see him quite clearly, he smiled at her and Molly returned the smile.
John watched crap telly while Sherlock worked on more cold cases, made some tea and by ten he was too exhausted to keep his eyes open; Sherlock helped him to bed and they lay together for a few minutes, kissing and holding hands before sleep was to strong and took John first. Sherlock left him to sleep and went back to the living room to send Lestrade his notes on a few cases; by midnight he was ready for bed.
A couple of weeks later, of going back and forth with their flirtation, he was there again, like every night. Today, he ran a bit late, with surgery and all, but he needed to see Sherlock.
“I’ll miss you too” Sherlock heard John’s voice break and wanted to hold him until the sensation of pain and void faded away, not even when Victor had broken up with him he had felt this way, the feeling of absence, of loneliness that filled his heart was another thing, he wanted to curl up and never move again, but he knew that soon they’ll be together.
He was also thankful to John because he had met Molly one day while taking care of Rosie, the young woman had him fascinated with her shyness, her sweetness and her overall attitude and way of simply… being… Yes, he is five years older than her, she’d just turned 18 a few days ago, but now he can fully woo her. What Greg didn’t know and had just found about, is how close to Mary and Sherlock Molly truly is -six degrees of separation- and now he was about to pull the gears of the world in motion to have his two friends meet and overcome the shyness.
“Oh” John smirked “Greg” He chuckled “Yeah, we should kill him” He rubbed Rosie’s back to hide his trembling hands, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and decided to be brave, once again “The truth is” he moved Rosie a little “I’m very thankful to him for… deceiving us” He blushed hard.
He finally managed to check his assignments and realised he’ll have to pull an all-nighter for his Friday lectures -the disadvantages of returning on Thursday instead of the same Sunday after the wedding, but he got to solve a murder, even though it meant he’d missed a week of lectures- he checked the basics of the assignments and outlined them, after all, he still had forty minutes to go. He could always skip lab time before going to Structural Methods with Professor Clarke in the afternoon, and work during the lecture the rest of the assignment; he’ll read Robertson and Edward’s pages that night…
John gaped at the man and Sherlock smiled, pleased “I’m not his date” John managed to say and Sherlock frowned; he meant to say “I’m his boyfriend, but the man kept on smiling and talking.
They became friends quite quickly; they were attached at the hip. Mary would go to every game and cheer for him, she would go to parties with John and John would take Mary to the cinema. Eventually, they met each other’s parents, whom, at some point, thought there was something there, that is, until Mary brought David to her home and introduced him as her boyfriend, and John brought James home and introduced him as his boyfriend.
Mary decided to keep a secret from John, or well, several. She never told her parents he is gay, or that the “nice chap that’s always with John” -as her father referred to James- was John’s boyfriend, or the fact that she got pregnant after ninety stupid seconds with David during her first time. For all John knew, she’d “done the nasty” with David a few weeks after John had done it with James.
“Oh, my boy” She cooed and smiled at him “Your plans were to ask him…” She bit her lip in that Holmesian way that identified them “And I interrupted and now he’s not answering” She tried not to laugh “He’s hurt because he planned your stay” She patted Sherlock’s cheek softly and Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes but he hadn’t the energy “When is he free?” She asked and Sherlock looked at her questioningly.
“Of course I was. I just decided to move out yesterday. I was going to call you as soon as we settled” John looked at her for the first time, she looked tired, she’d been crying and the news about Rosie affected her more than she let on.
Sherlock’s world stopped once more, he had no idea what to say. He knew John was attracted to him but wasn’t sure it would last, considering what his brother had said about his parent “lust at first sight”
As always, thank you for reading my rambling and sometimes boring and idiotic ideas... Love you all and Happy Sherlock!
“What?” John needed Sherlock to repeat what he had said, he needed to make sure. Sherlock had asked him to move in together but they’d been together for two months, should he move in with him?
“Italian. There’s new place over Northumberland Street” He smirked and John looked at him suspiciously.
"...if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody’s best friend. Certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing... I am a ridiculous man... redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship."
“After just two months you moved in with him. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” Mycroft mocked.
“He said it sounded like a plan” Sherlock scowled at the memory, John was feeding Rosie and barely listening “But I fear he wasn’t really listening, Rosie was acting out” He let out a biscuit muffled sigh.
Back in Baker Street, they danced until dawn, sharing kisses and caresses, holding each other close, taking their time, not turning the other on. The first few weeks after they made up they kept at it like rabbits (excuse the pun…) every single touch was fire, every single look was lust, every chance they had they’ll be at each other, kissing, fondling… etcetera… With time, they created their own routine and after four months of being back together, John proposed and Sherlock proposed at the same time, they both chuckled and said yes. They planned a small ceremony and got married a month later.
“Hey!” John practically ran to Sherlock the second he saw him standing outside Bart’s “What’re you doing here?” He asked and planted several kissed on Sherlock’s lips.
The crowd started applauding, whistling, catcalling… all around one body that was moving like it was the last day on earth… the movements were mesmerising, John was entranced. The dancer was precise; calculated, yet natural moves, sensual, sexy, hot as hell… he was dancing his heart out, like nobody else was there, he was one with the music, his hips swayed back and forth, his hands and arms moved gracefully around him, his legs lifted and bent, and bounced and ran up to heaven, up to… up to an arse to die for, round, firm, strong, biteable… he was so sensual, so sexy… so… he was a he!
He thought they were past that, but it clearly was a mistake… He had also picked on the signals of John doing something he shouldn’t have while with Mary, but he let it pass… There was no need to blame John of cheating, much less when his wife had just died and they weren’t exactly on speaking terms…
“I’m sorry” Sherlock grabbed John’s face and looked at him. “I’m so sorry” Sherlock breathed close to John’s lips
"It's been a long day." I sigh, exhausted, Sherlock is in the kitchen finishing the dishes, for once. I watch him close the tap and reach for the tea towel, turning to face me.
We get lost in the sound, even though it's a happy tune, the sad undertones are there, loves lost in time.
What year is it? I open my eyes and find myself in hospital. It smells clean enough to assume a couple decades have passed since I last died, or well, since I last was born.
“I’ll get a candle for the table. It’s more romantic” Angelo left them to choose. When he returned with the candle John looked up, trying not to laugh at the smiling man that was sending Sherlock knowing looks and concentrated on the menu.
The seven minutes seemed like seven hours and John couldn’t shake the sensation that all this was wrong. They left the closet, Sarah with a dazed gaze and a smile that made her face look like a clown had thrown up all his jokes on her mouth; John on the other hand, looked annoyed and wanted to leave the party only to avoid the looks they were giving him, the girls went to Sarah and took her away, squealing, the boys whistled and cheered him, he just nodded and pretended to care.
"We lived long lives," my John resurfaces from the memory and reaches for my hand, kissing every finger reverentially. I know he can see the disgust on my face.
“But if that were true” Violet continued “He would hang up the second Rosie falls asleep instead of chatting with us for at least half an hour” She leaned closer and hugged John “Thank you” She gave him a kiss on the cheek “have a nice trip, son” She patted his arm softly before practically pushing him in to the train.
Marcus arrives to Salernum four days after father's death. Uncle Claudius hands him a bucket and asks him to feed the pigs. That night, extremely exhausted, he goes to bed before cena is served.
His mind was swirling with information while Molly chatted what he considered nonsense “John offered to help Mary and pretended to be the father of the baby she was expecting, the arsehole left her when she broke the news to him” Sherlock nodded in acknowledgement “And John was so sweet…” She sighed and smiled like a love sick puppy “But he found himself engaged to Mary, unable to stop the wedding because Mr. Morstan asked him to marry Mary” Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes and nodded again. Molly continued the incessant chatter and Sherlock just hummed, nodded, smiled and occasionally would comment about the story with “oh, really?”, “no way” and “mmm, I see”. Sherlock let her talk for another half hour before excusing himself and promising Molly he’ll be at her house by eleven, an hour before the wedding.
“Nice girlfriend” John answered shortly, his face blushed as he tried to contain his anger and jealousy.
At first, before coming out to his parents, John had met Mary, the young girl, a year younger than him, was sweet and beautiful, every boy wanted her, every girl wanted to be her, well, except John Watson. They became good friends rather quickly; he was tutoring her in science. At some point they seemed attached to the hip, even his parents thought there was something there, but they were just good friends, actually, the best. He had come out to her before telling anyone; she kept his secrets, he kept hers. He told her he was gay, she told him she was in love with David. He told her he loved James, even before telling James, she told him she was ready to have sex with David, even before telling David. He told her all about his first time with James, on James seventeenth birthday, it had been loving, slow, a bit painful, but quite pleasurable. If only she had told John about hers…
Not knowing exactly where he was, he ended up in a little pub; the music was nice and it wasn’t too crowded; he could have a beer, drink it at his own pace, not having to compete with seven other men on who was the fastest drinker, or who could hold better their liqueur, or who though was the funniest drunk… no, he could have a pint by himself, calm down, leave at a decent time, and be back in London before midnight… he really didn’t want to go back drunk and have on hell of a headache and an even more disgusting and annoying hangover on the way back to hell…
Mycroft felt calmer after the visit, a big weight lifted from his chest. His biggest worry was that Sherlock might find domestic life boring; he had seen him at his best and at his worst, and quite frankly, he couldn’t help but worry and think about the time his brother might do something stupid, put at risk the life he had created and blow things with John, harming them in the way. He had to admit to himself that he was wrong, that Sherlock had found what he needed, even though he complained of being bored when a week passed and he didn’t have a case, or when John’s wasn’t around and Rosie was at her grandparents.
Still broken up... Let's see how the Final Problem goes and we'll talk... Still a bit pissed with John, but I might think of forgiving him... Let's wait and see
Eurus didn’t want to interfere in their relationship; all she wanted was for Sherlock to be happy. She had witnessed her brother’s decay after Victor fucking Trevor, she was aware of his wrong doing, she had several friends, and Jim had told her all about James and Victor… She was pissed and wanted to kill him, but out of respect to Sherlock she had stopped Jim from beating the shit out of both of them with his best friend Sebastian Moran. If it were for them… But no, she wouldn’t interfere, John was a keeper.
How was he going to tell James? He was supposed to help her, nothing more. James had told him to apologise, accept the blame, claim to be the father, assure the family he’ll help Mary in every way possible, promise to be there for her, even give the baby his name and nothing more; marriage was not in the cards, he had just… up the ante… John couldn’t even breathe properly, but he had made his bed and now he had to lay in it.  He scrubbed his face with his hands and when Alex patted his shoulder and said “Welcome to the family, son” all he could do was nod and shake his head, completely lost for words or even a proper reaction.
Mycroft opened the door and greeted him; one look over the young man gave all the information Mycroft was able to gather, much like Sherlock did, though he was better at reading emotions. The file was more explicit about John’s life; one steady boyfriend for over two years -James Sholto (UK special forces (check current file of conflict and check for security) unit to be assigned, going as INT CORPS); currently engaged to be married to Sherlock’s ex-boyfriend, Victor Trevor; wedding programed for July;
"He used to say... that if I showed my face they'll never leave. Only the ones that paid top money and asked for me daily had that privilege, he... he sometimes charged them for just seeing my face..." I grimace and my John kisses my cheeks.
The crowd grew larger, the music grew higher, and John was ready to make his way out… he had to leave to make it to London before midnight, with time enough to take a shower, get his shit together and be there for last call…
The kiss lasted a long while, lips coming together and never coming apart. No oxygen was needed when all the air the bodies demanded was the one the other provided. The romantic side of John was flipping and turning, doing somersaults and dancing to the drums by the fire. Sherlock discovered he had a romantic side and couldn’t find a better scenario for a first kiss than the sunset, at the top of the Eiffel tower, right in Paris. When the kiss was over, when they finally broke apart, the light in Sherlock’s eyes could illuminate the entire world, much like the smile on John’s lips. Neither could believe they had waited so long to kiss.
“Actually, yes” John pursed his lips and fixed his eyes on Sherlock’s. He could see the Detective trying to school his features into the cold mask of arrogance, but his eyes said it all. Betrayal, pain, anger, sorrow and fear went over his icy eyes, before they settled in resignation and a blank stare that betrayed nothing. “With my therapist” John clarified and Sherlock took a short breath before steepling his fingers over his lips to hide the trembling. “I’ve been seeing her for the past ten months” John continued, breaking the uncomfortable silence “But instead of going to her office” He scratched the back of his neck trying to figure out how Sherlock hadn’t found out about it “She’s been going to mine” He took a deep breath “She’s scheduled appointments after five, three times a week and she’s been helping me with texts and calls…” he blushed and looked away “Whenever I had a nightmare or couldn’t cope with all that has happened the past year”
After they put Rosie for her afternoon nap, they finished with the rest of the flat, placing books on the bookcase, finishing the kitchen and babyproofing the entire flat. One by one their friends left them, the last ones to leave Eurus and Jim. Sherlock was intrigued by the man, he found it hard to like or dislike him, but he had to admit his sister seemed happy; he just hoped he was a good man. They shared a few words and Sherlock noticed he was quite clever, his dark humour made him even more interesting. Sherlock tried to read him, the real him, but there were too many signals that he was pretending for the sake of being accepted.
"Your brother once told me you had the mind of a philosopher." John whispers, Rosie is asleep in his arms and he doesn't want to move.
His eyes landed on a tall brunette, his curls were wild and… perfect… his body, sinful… he wiggled and swayed, he said something in French and then started singing, and John’s world stopped, because those maddening eyes were looking at him, singing to him, enticing him… He went the entire week to see him, but whenever he wanted to approach him, he was being seduced by another man and John would leave without a word.
A few months later, John talked to Harry and they finally made up when his older brother understood that John wasn’t different, wasn’t less, wasn’t damaged; he just was… in love… he explained to his older brother that he felt the same way he did when he looked at Clara every time he looked at James, his heart would beat fast, his stomach would flutter, he would feel a rush of adrenaline and love travel through his body. He was in love, just as much as his brother was, the only difference was that he was in love with another man.
“Yes” Sherlock cleared his throat and looked out the window, then closed his eyes for a few seconds and focused again on John “I’ve a few news” He bit his lower lip and looked at the candle in the middle of the table “Remember a week ago, I came to visit and I told you about Oxford?” John nodded and the shook his head, as if trying to clear his memories. Sherlock took a deep breath “Remember I told you I was basically done with University?” Sherlock tapped his fingers on the table. John shook his head again “I told you that I’ve managed to complete the entire programme, including my research. I’ve talked to my professors and…” He hoped John wouldn’t be angry “I’ve finished University, graduation could be in July” He gave John an awkward smile and waited.
Sherlock felt his heart stop and start beating fast, running like a wild horse inside his chest and his stomach wildly competing with the best swimmers for a perfect 10.0 somersault. The world went silent around him and he couldn’t keep his eyes off of John; his entire world suddenly brighter just because the man he had dreamt for the last month was standing right there in front of him.
I was a scribbler and had just heard of King Amyrtaeus' death; a couple of days later I was called to write about his successor, Nepherites... I mean... Nefaarud The First. Something happened on my way to him and I couldn't make it to Mendes, that day I heard about Socrates... The last I remember is a voice, asking me to wait. Next time I opened my eyes I was twenty five, half a century had passed since I last died, 344 B.C. The day of my twenty fifth birthday I sort of had my first memory of you, your voice asking me to wait.
