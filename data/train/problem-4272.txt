Sam rolled his eyes and shook his head, finally allowing the subject to drop but Dean knew that his brother was still thinking about it. Pondering what his strange older brother was on about this time. It seemed that no matter how much time passed or many times he caught glimpses of the private life inside Dean’s head, Sam could never truly understand him. Not all of him, anyway.
Cas shook his head, sure now that he probably shouldn’t have brought it up. He must sound so foolish. “Well, no… but I think I remember some of the lyrics.”
Dean hesitated and looked at his feet in shame. “I think I just don’t care as much as I probably should.”
Castiel opened his mouth to speak. To say ‘I love you’, or something of that regard, but then his head was abruptly struck with the most piercing of sounds. He sat up immediately and clutched at his head, crushing in his temples hard with the palms of his hands. The inside of his skull felt as though it had suddenly swelled and the bone was crushing from the inside out. The noise burrowed deeper into his brain and he felt his wild pulse in his hands and his neck and his ears. His throat constricted and he clenched his jaw so hard he could taste blood from where his teeth had bit down into his cheek. Every muscle tensed like all the air had been ripped from his lungs. A heat burned his eyes and momentarily suffocated his sight with bright and impenetrable white. Castiel couldn’t see or hear or speak until voices erupted in every crevice of his mind. There were so many of them, all talking at once, each distinctive octave overlaying the other, illegible cries of pain and confusion.
“Jesus Christ, what are you two like best friends now?” Dean looked incredulous at the fact that his name apparently appeared frequently in the conversations his brother and Cas have with each other.
Cas turned, somewhat uncomfortably, onto his side and gently placed his hand on Dean’s exposed skin, moving it gradually to his waist. He considered saying something. Admitting what he had overheard and just asking the questions that he’d unsuccessfully tried to suppress. Like: where did they go from here? What if Cas couldn’t escape this unscathed? Could Dean still love him despite it? Despite the days spent bound to his bed? Despite the odour he exuded whenever he couldn’t muster the energy to shower? Despite his guilty and untameable tears?
“I don’t need to put up with this shit,” Dean snarled and turned his back.
“Okay?”
Castiel paused, fully expecting Dean’s face to flare up or for his tongue to swell three sizes in his mouth. When nothing of the sort occurred, he allowed himself to turn back to the kitchen counter and resumed melding the flour and butter into a crust. He had lost all faith in the recipe and failed to regard it with the same diligence he had at the start of this ridiculous endeavour. But why was it so dry? Cautiously, he added more water and watched in dismay as it trickled off the counter onto his feet. He masked a shudder and swallowed hard against the sudden burn in his throat.
“Are we ever going to talk about that kiss, Dean?” Sam asked finally.
Oof, so that was... a wait. Again, I apologise. In any case, I thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed this chapter! If you like, you can follow me on Tumblr where I usually try to post whenever I upload a new chapter. http://gemminycricket4.tumblr.com/
There was a war waiting for them on both sides of the portal, and it was with trepidation that Dean stepped back into the portal with a hand latching onto Sam and Castiel to draw them back with him. He had to favour their chances here and hope Castiel’s angels weren’t quite so thirsty for blood as the angels Cas had left behind.
“I am well aware of the difference, and I know pity when I see it. You pity him. And that makes you soft.”
“When have we ever been rational thinkers?” Dean pointed out.
“Look, we were surrounded, okay? Some freak jumped Cas. Obviously, he kicked its ass, right?” Dean waited for Cas to back his story, but the faint fear he’d repressed came to the surface when the confirmation never came.
“Jeez. Everything is because of me then, huh?” Dean’s foot subtly pressed harder on the accelerator.
“But she was eating a burger and there was a distinct focus on her breasts. It has to mean something,” Castiel insisted and glanced up as the hunter stood leaning in the doorway.
Because it was true to an extent: he really hadn’t known that Metatron wasn’t
“You should be taking better care of yourself,” Castiel lectured. He pulled at Dean’s arm and gestured for the hunter to follow him. He needed to clean the crusted blood away so he could get a proper look.
Clearly, Dean now believed that a magazine could never truly suffice for the real thing.
“The Winchesters. Always the Winchesters,” the angel scoffed, “also obvious. I should never have asked… but I wanted to make sure you’d cooperate. And I wanted to have a little fun.”
He needed Dean to rewrite reality into something Cas could justly live in. He needed Dean to make him feel wanted in this world where Cas so often felt unwelcome.
“I couldn’t understand them,” Cas told Dean once he sat behind the wheel. He omitted the sound of his name from the truth. “They were so loud. There were so many voices crying at once…”
“Okay… okay,” Dean murmured, smiling at first with a wet shine to his eyes of threatening tears, then his face fell. “Alright…”
He couldn’t dispute the hope that struck him dumb and sent nerves spiralling up his spine to the back of his neck. His skin broke out in goosebumps and his heart thrummed violently in his ears. A second knock followed, still patient. Cas finally gathered himself and opened the door.
If it weren’t for that, then Dean may have considered battling on alone. In the time between kill or be killed, Benny felt the need to ask questions. Questions that Dean had no desire to answer. And it certainly started innocently enough: What’s it like on Earth now? What has changed? What has stayed the same?
“But you’re not playing any part in it?” Sam finished for him, “I’ve heard you before Dean.”
“It’s going to be okay, Cas,” Dean promised. His knuckles turned white on the steering wheel. His eyes were focused on the road, but Cas saw the fear glistening inside them, ready to escape in the form of tears. Dean was petrified. He already sensed what this could mean for them, and Cas knew it too.
“Oh, I’m sure,” Dean scoffed, “doing what?”
I hoped you liked this story. And if not, then I hope you'll like my next one better. (I have another project under works, but it may be some time before it sees the light of day... but stay tuned!)
How could Dean so easily act as if nothing had happened? How could he pretend that his fingers hadn’t been in Castiel’s waistband? That his hands hadn’t trailed along the ex-angels hipbones? Did it not occur to Dean the way it did to Castiel that the hunter could have easily pulled the pyjama pants down instead of up? Cas shivered at the thought and he turned up the volume of the television in an attempt to force the idea out of his mind.
“Right, well now that that’s cleared up. I didn’t know how you’d like your coffee now that your tastebuds are functional so I just got it black, the way you used to drink it. But I’ve got some sachets of sugar in my pocket if you wanna sweeten it up.”
Carving out the shadow of Castiel didn’t make the image any less beautiful.
“So are you always going to put your hands in my underwear and just take whatever you want?”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel whispered, locking eyes with Dean.
But now, with Dean drawing attention to himself, Castiel again started to picture the contours or Dean’s body. This wasn’t difficult as Dean was wearing so little as it was, compared to his usual jeans and multiple layers of flannel and/or leather. Cas imagined tracing Dean’s naked hip and the inside of his thighs and kissing at those damn collarbones. He contemplated what it would be like to taste the inside of Dean’s mouth, to bite at his bottom lip, and to feel the heat of his skin flush against his own.
“Okay,” he said quietly and slowly sat upright. His muscles were tense, and the pain worsened still as he shuffled his legs over the edge of the bed and stood. As he considered it, he realised he couldn’t remember how long it had been since he last got out of bed.
Castiel furrowed his brow and remained motionless at the very edge.
When Castiel awoke, he immediately recognised the stiff, sterile feel of hospital sheets. He had been in a hospital bed only a few times before, but often enough to be familiar with their distinct weight and texture that was unlike sheets found anywhere else. It wasn’t a comfort to be here again, though he supposed it was better than the alternative—which was a shocking revelation after months of existing only in a state of constant duress where suicide seemed imminent and inescapable and sometimes the most horrid, terrifying kind of welcome.
And finally Castiel had come to realise that it was important, even if he didn’t understand it.
The brief silence was deafening. Castiel’s heart was racing inside his chest, each beat pounding louder in his ears. He actually felt a little dizzy—unstable on his feet. He couldn’t trust his legs to keep him upright anymore, but he felt it would be inappropriate to sit down on Dean’s bed. Cas assumed it was probably best to avoid touching anything at all. Instinct told him to remain still like stone, as if in the hope that Dean would forget he was there entirely. It was irrational, but it felt safe, so Cas stood silently before Dean with his shoulders stiffly pushed back.
His skin was quickly swept with heat and it travelled into his face, reddening his skin; with rage, but also shame too. Shame because he got to feel the same way Sam had when days earlier he had used the very same words: Abandoned. Left to carry a heavy burden upon his own weak shoulders, with the weight of every decision buckling his knees. Like he were walking on thin ice, with one wrong step bound to send him into the pit of freezing cold to drown.
Cas looked up at Dean. A small smile played at the edges of his lips as he watched the pink of Dean’s cheeks darken into a flush red; the silly schoolboy grin he once adorned now closely resembled something awkward and shy.
“Anything,” Cas assured him.
In a way, despite knowing the truth, he still felt like he had gotten his angel back.
His mind was elsewhere now, thinking that if fiery wasn’t his type, then what was?
“Look, you’ve always gotta expect some nasty surprises.”
Castiel nodded slightly, each and every one of his movements tainted with heartache—his mind obviously torn between what he should do and what felt right. Dean recognised that look. He had seen it in Cas all those years ago, and he had chosen to do the right thing.
He even felt that same sense of fear like he was trapped with a feral and malicious animal.
In a way, Dean almost envied him. Sometimes he had to try so much harder to get the same level of interest.
“We’re still alive, aren’t we?” Dean pointed out.
The same way he no longer bothered to watch the news, as he had done immediately upon Sam and Dean leaving on their hunt.
“There’s always another choice,” Castiel argued.
“Waking up in a new skin, I get it,” Dean said.
Too much rode on Sam’s reply. There was only so far Dean could push him before his influence was rendered entirely useless. Sam could think for himself, and he could put his foot down wherever it so pleased him.
“Absolutely not,” Cas said, firm in his resolve. He was positive that his voice would not appeal to anyone’s ears, certainly not to Dean’s, and he was sure to get the words wrong.
“Every day,” Dean divulged finally.
Dean eased off the accelerator. Sam let out a faint sigh of relief and visibly relaxed, his long legs loosening and taking up even more of the front seat. Looking again in the rear-view mirror, Castiel seemed totally oblivious to the changing speeds. He was still enthralled by the view from his window rather than the happenings of the front seat. Dean shook his head minutely and tried to remain attentive to the road this time, listening now as Sam began to give directions.
“Thanks, but no thanks,” Dean got up and went to the fridge for a beer though they were bound to still be a little warm. “I don’t read that stuff.”
“Castiel,” Sam said sternly. He cleared his throat and cast a wary look at Dean.
It was nice to think even for just one blissful moment that his intentions were nothing more than the innocent gesture Dean believed it to be rather than the guilt-laden one it actually was. He let the joke fill him briefly and basked in it, memorizing the sensation. After a few seconds, he reluctantly let it go. Cas appraised Dean, searching prematurely for forgiveness he hadn’t yet earned. He couldn’t help but implore with another intimate press of his fingers against Dean’s warm palm. Dean confused the desperation for something else and leaned in to kiss him. Cas flinched and turned away, snatching his hand back like the embrace had scorched him.
Cas fell quiet and cut into his steak; sawing at the meat with more ferocity than it required. This didn’t escape Dean’s notice.
“You know;
Castiel looked at him. The flat emptiness of his eyes startled Dean, and he heard the shuffle of his brother’s feet as he took yet another instinctual step backwards.
He took a large swig from his beer and set the empty bottle down. Castiel moved in closer to Dean, leaning over more to get a better look at the carved letters of their initials. His coat brushed against Dean’s arm. The hairs on Dean’s arms stood on end and he shivered.
Castiel peered up at him, his expression forlorn. He was burdened with the fear of what Dean would say or do. After all, he had completely violated Dean’s privacy and drawn attention to something Dean obviously hadn’t wanted to share.
“I ran away,” Castiel locked eyes with Dean but there a quiet grief lingering in that intense blue gaze. His confession came from a heavy heart.
But Purgatory wasn’t the place. This wasn’t the time. It was a boundary he had never crossed. And Benny was watching.
When Dean didn’t say anything, instead just averting his gaze yet again, Castiel leaned into him and whispered so soft that Sam surely couldn’t hear.
“I’ll be here,” Cas said, hanging up after Dean did.
“It could be nothing,” Dean murmured, surprisingly hesitant as he looked Cas up and down before fixing his eyes purposely on the road.
Dean realised that he had hit a nerve. He watched as Cas tried to hold himself together and reel in the pain he had accidentally let out and Dean recognised the struggle. It hurt him to see Cas like this, and he was reminded of how the angel had pushed Dean’s hand away at the portal, wishing to stay, suffer, and die, the way he thought he deserved. Dean would never believe that Castiel could earn such a severe punishment, and he wasn’t about to let Cas leave him again.
But then Cas was startled at what came to the table. It was a burger but the size of it was just baffling and there are so many fillings that he couldn’t recognise from just looking at them. He couldn’t understand how Dean could eat so much, and usually in such a short amount of time. Already Dean had dug into his own burger, squashing it down a little between his hands so he could bite into it.
Cas could hardly comprehend what was happening. All he knew was that it hurt to be moved. It hurt to be touched. Instinct told him to flinch at the feel of their hands. Their grasps were too tight and the texture of their skin too rough, together fighting under the weight of Castiel’s limp body as they heaved him onwards. It was so dark outside, everything encapsulated by shadow except for the two steady streams of lights ahead that called to them. Castiel blinked against them. His heart battled inside his chest, beating rapid and loud. Fear had snared him. Even saviour felt dangerous.
But, tonight nothing hurt. The dark corners of his mind were loose with intoxication and the negative thoughts simply refused to stick. It was much easier to believe he belonged there like another piece of the architecture—a permanent fixture that kept the whole place from crumbling down.
“For someone that hates to remind me, you were hardly hesitant to remind me,” Cas pointed out, “but if you must know, I don’t have any reservations about illegally obtaining a vehicle.”
Cas sniffled and wiped his nose on the back of his hand. He noticed that the redness in his face was already starting to soften. Some of the tension in his muscles had begun to ease and he nodded his head appreciatively, giving the candle a delicate sniff.
Would he still be in the bunker?
“No, you’ve always got a choice,” Dean corrected him, “and I think maybe you just made the choice you really wanted to.”
The image drifted out onto the street, casting over its location once before his mind was returned to him.
Dean covertly wished he’d had more time to have Castiel to himself; time to say everything that had been eating at him since escaping Purgatory. He wanted Cas to know that it had never been his intention to leave him behind. He wanted to ask why Cas couldn’t fight just that little bit harder when he needed to. Dean needed to know that Cas didn’t resent him for everything that had happened.
He knew where to go. But with a location in mind, there was nowhere else he wanted to be more than here.
Sophia crossed her arms and turned her back once more, standing stiff and straight—clearly uncomfortable in a human’s skin. Cas reached out to touch her shoulder but quickly withdrew his hand. He knew it wouldn’t be wise to touch her. His touch wouldn’t be a comfort. She would likely shudder beneath his hand or pull away in disgust. And Cas wouldn’t blame her.
Perhaps Cas could keep it that way.
“I didn’t want to be found, Dean. I thought it best that you didn’t follow. I didn’t think—I didn’t want—I couldn’t have that risk fall on you or Sam and I just…” Cas tried to explain but the words came out jumbled and wrong. It was more than that. So much more. Tentatively, he put his hand out for Dean’s arm but Dean subtly withdrew with a timid flinch, keeping him just out of reach. With his fist still pressed to his lips, his eyes darted despairingly towards Sam and back to Cas.
And he hadn’t believed it each and every time.
He understood. He felt the same way about leaving Dean, too.
Dean paused and looked him up and down. His shirt sleeves were still rolled up, his coat left messily folded on one of the cars, and his collar a little loose without his tie around it. Even though he was an angel with all kinds of inhuman strength and fast healing abilities—and even though Dean trusted he wouldn’t actually crash the bike to begin with—it still didn’t seem like appropriate motorcycle attire.
“For everything. And I know you said that apologising is just air better spent on breathing… but I’m fighting for it right now. All of the amends I need to make and all of the breaths I need to take, they’re all better spent on you.”
Dean shivered.
“Biff Tannen. He was the bully in… you know what? Never mind. It’s a movie reference,” Dan said dismissively. “Anyway. So this guy decided to make my acquaintance on my first day by shoving me in the hall.”
Castiel caressed Dean’s face and forced him to look at him. “But I promise to come home.”
Now that he was settled on his preferred liquor, he stood up to get another despite Dean suggesting he wait, and insisted he had no need to stop. Though the hunter made no effort to stop him when he came back with more, allowing him to drink quickly without much pause for breath.
Benny held up his hands in surrender. “You’re the boss. I just think you gotta face facts here, Dean…”
“Where?” Castiel asked and stood up. His tone was laced with trepidation.
Still, he suspected new ones were waiting for him just over the horizon.
“Why should I?” Castiel asked smoothly. Innocently. Naively.
Cas nodded again. “Yes. The coffee is too hot,” he claimed.
Dean believed he was already on this path… so far down, in fact, he couldn’t possibly find the way he had come. But Sam wasn’t there yet. There was hope for him. There was a chance he could stop himself before he became lost and blind to the good life he had yet to live.
Cas leaned against the edge of the car with his palms pressed against the hood. He hung his head low and took a few broken breaths. His arms very barely shook; a mere unperceivable tremor, but a tremor all the same. Castiel was afraid. Very afraid. Afraid of what he must do, and that he may be too weak to do it. He was afraid of dying slow. He was afraid of what would become of him after.
And Dean made it feel so easy.
Dean blinked again and winced at the pain in his shoulder as Castiel grabbed it. And then he was being dragged—near lifted and carried actually. He couldn’t fight even if he wanted to. Dean allowed Castiel to take him wherever he wanted, and then he felt the swift sensation of passing from one world through to the next.
“Just tell me what to do, Cas,” Dean said breathlessly; wanting to experience Castiel in control.
“Don’t need the bathroom again already, do you?” Dean asked, “Speak now or forever hold your peace because I’m not stopping again.”
But again he didn’t remember feeling the moment he actually passed.
“All?” Dean repeated in disbelief, “You don’t mean—”
A car pulled out of the lot and cast its headlights past the Impala which gave Castiel just enough time to see Dean’s face in the light. His eyes were shut and his mouth agape in an overwhelmed desire, and Cas was intrigued by the swelling of Dean’s lips where his kisses had left their mark; claiming them as his.
“It doesn’t work like that,” Cas shook his head dejectedly, “if only it were that simple.”
“What the hell are you doing, Dean?” Sam asked, exasperated.
Maybe then Dean would have spent a lot less time looking for a dead man.
“Well, I’m not here to play into any ‘good cop, bad cop’ routine,” Dean interjected. He was there for the sake of Sam and Cas, and out of basic human decency. He had no intention of befriending Castiel. He honestly didn’t believe friendship was an option, even if he desired it.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said finally, “I don’t mean to pester you all the time. I dunno, I just… I think I’m so used to taking care of Sam, you know? Growing up, it was my job to make sure he ate and I had to look after him when he was sick. I was taught to take a bullet for him. It’s instinctual now to look after the people I care about.”
“Forgive me if I’m wrong, but I believe it has to actually be lit to be of any use to you,” Castiel challenged him.
Then Castiel stopped at the one thing in the room that didn’t belong. Even though it was outdated when considering that everything now was contained in portable devices and Bluetooth speakers, the stereo was new enough to stand out from all the other contraptions littered around the room. Castiel peered at it curiously and tentatively touched one of the buttons, causing the cassette slot to open. He closed it and then opened it again, trying to understand its function.
Dean always knew that the end would come for him long before his time; that his soul would pass and leave behind a body still in its prime. He knew that there would never come a day when he could sit on his porch and stare out across his lawn, his hair grey and his bones tired and weak with age. He wouldn’t have the chance to have a life outside this one where he and his brother journeyed the country to save the world from monsters.
“Woah, woah, woah… let’s not go there,” Dean interjected quickly, laughing quietly despite himself. “I keep forgetting it’s back to square one with you.”
His face was suddenly violently plunged back into the water and held there for a longer time. His broken nose hit the bottom and, with his eyes faintly open, he saw the water cloud red with his own blood. After that, he saw spots and the creeping dark edges as he began losing consciousness. His mouth, that had once refused to open, parted and flooded. As he tried to breathe, his throat and lungs filled. He felt heavy so quickly. His whole body was turning limp and the dead weight was heavy inside the confines of his vessel. It was suddenly a relief that his grace was gone, there couldn’t have possibly been room for it and death all at once. Castiel was breathing; drinking in the contents of bloody water and killing himself.
“Mmmm,” Dean hummed noncommittedly and turned his attention back to his laptop. He’d spent days searching for any suspicious news articles that could lead them to a hunt, but so far nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and no new sightings of interdimensional portals had been reported. Dean swore that all things that went bump in the night withdrew right when he was most eager to hunt them. And slowly this lack of distraction had turned him more to the drink—there was nothing else to pass the time.
“Cas… it’s okay. It’s just a hangover,” Dean soothed.
Cas didn’t belong here. He didn’t belong
These words had sat barren on their tongues and caught in their throats and heavy in their hearts ever since. Cas swore that when they kissed he could almost taste it on Dean’s lips; startling bitter and near impossible to cleanse afterward. He knew Dean was burdened by it, and that it grew more torturous day after day to just sit and ponder and wait for the inevitable. He had questions to ask and allegations to make and accusations to throw that Cas couldn’t honestly refute. It was an argument neither was yet willing to have. Neither wanted to taint what they had, both afraid that there would be no getting it back.
“I just want to get rid of him, understand? I don’t want to see him, I don’t want to talk to him—”
But Castiel couldn’t be moved.
And they had worked like that for the entire evening until Cas got up to get a glass of water. Dean approached him in the kitchen and without needing to ask if he wanted it, Cas poured an extra glass and held it out towards the hunter who didn’t take it straight away.
“Hola,” Benny, however, did notice Castiel’s body language and he wondered if the angel would actually dare zap away again, leaving Dean. Benny was wary of Cas and was carefully sizing him up, trying to find what made this angel worthy of saviour.
“For being a burden.”
“Come home,” Dean said.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Dean replied smoothly and gestured for Cas to follow him to their room. “What a nice girl,” Dean muttered under his breath once they were out of earshot.
It was in their nature to be cruel. No matter who to, and no matter what for. Heaven’s soldiers were expected to bleed but not to feel the pain. And they weren’t expected to love either, but they were ingrained to hate.
“Sam said that you watch trash TV,” Castiel said though he didn’t fully understand what that entailed.
“There’s an article here about the cast. I thought you might be interested.”
“How bout we take this slow, okay? I don’t want to confuse you,” Dean offered.
difference between me sleeping with random guys and me sleeping with
He had a point, but Dean just shrugged nonetheless, “Real enough. But hey, eventually this will have to be kicked up a notch. It’ll have to get violent. And I don’t want that… do you?”
Castiel’s eyes flashed an astonishing blue that was so bright that Dean started to turn and look away, one trembling hand rising to cover his eyes. He could only just see Sam as he emerged from behind Castiel’s shoulder and hastily forced the second cuff around Castiel’s other wrist. Instantly, the light burnt out from Castiel’s eyes as his powers diminished; stripped away from him by the Enochian sigils etched into the metal. Cas stared at his hands, startled at the sudden loss of control and the unfamiliar feeling of vulnerability. Dean clumsily rose and forced the blade free from Castiel’s hand and then withdrew from him to Sam’s side.
Dean arched his back more, seemingly shaking on his forearms with his head drooping forward. “Holy fuck,” Dean agreed, trying to peer back at Cas. “Fuck me raw,” he urged Castiel, “I want you to fuck me so fucking raw.”
“No. Sam’s staying here,” Dean responded plainly, digging the keys from his pocket. “This trip is about you.”
He went back to picking at his food and inspected a small green herb from the top of his steak. He held and grinded it between his thumb and forefinger, and gave it a curious sniff. Whatever it was, he couldn’t identify it and couldn’t recognise the faint scent either though his first thought was that it appeared fresh. Cautiously, he put the herb into his mouth and chewed; instantly regretting it when it got stuck in his teeth and felt dry on his tongue. Though only mildly bitter, Cas found it to be assault on his senses and his face wrinkled up in distaste.
Dean settled himself in the driver’s seat and waited for Sam to force Castiel into the backseat before joining him at his side. He glanced into the rear-view mirror, his green eyes locking with blue. Castiel’s glare was filled with torment and rage, like there had never been any love or compassion behind those eyes before. Dean swiftly looked away. Sam pulled his door shut with a little more force than was necessary and switched the radio on. The station crackled and whirred as the signal faded in and out the further they drove down the winding road toward the highway. The sound put Dean on edge.
Cas hummed again but he couldn’t open his eyes anymore. Dean’s story was the distraction he needed. Or rather, Dean’s voice was. It wouldn’t have mattered what Dean decided to talk about, because it wasn’t so much the words but rather the fact Dean was there to say them that made all the difference. Like having Dean there in the next bed the night before. Just having Dean nearby allowed him to forget his troubles.
“And if leviathan want to take a shot at us, let them. We ganked those bitches once before, we can do it again.”
“Yes, and if I had, you could very well be dead. You can lecture me later if you still feel so strongly about it.”
“Wait here,” Sam instructed and retrieved the demon blade from his belt. He hesitated only briefly before stepping through the portal, the edges glowing brightly for the seconds it took for him to travel between worlds.
Cas turned properly and crossed his legs on the bed, now facing Dean with all the curiosity and confusion he hadn’t anticipated he’d feel. Of everything he had expected, something as simple as that hadn’t crossed his mind. And he wondered why Dean thought the question would distress him.
Dean looked at him. “Good,” he said, almost shy. He smiled. It was a warm and honest smile that reached his eyes, and for once Castiel knew the cause. Cas’ heart started to hammer what felt like a few beats too fast and too many, but in the best way possible, and he found himself needing to be the first to look away.
“Sorry,” he sighed dejectedly.
Cas did as he said, gazing out the window to the forest passing them in a blur. After a few minutes he found that it did help settle his stomach a little, but his face retained that pale quality it had before and Dean decided to pull over for a while, claiming that he needed to stretch his legs.
Sam made a face and near shuddered at the sight of Dean’s coffee stained dribble hanging off his chin. Clearly he found Dean disgusting. He tossed the slightly damp cloth to him and continued as Dean wiped his face. “Well, I think until then we’ll just have to keep him here,” Sam decided finally. He didn’t look or sound thrilled by the idea.
Still, Castiel was uneasy.
Dean gestured to the ill-treated ingredients. “Aren’t you making an apple pie?”
“Thought I didn’t see you?” Dean asked from behind him.
“What more can I do?” He asked dismally. It wasn’t enough just to speak to Dean. Castiel’s tongue already felt swollen with regrets.
Again, he was struck at the head, this time a fist uppercutting at his chin. Dean fell back into the dirt. Desperately, he tightened his grip on the angel blade and swung blindly with it, somehow cutting into flesh. There was a furious cry and the sound of feet shuffling and a weight falling to one knee. Distantly, Dean could hear Sam suffering under what he assumed was a similar torment.
Castiel fell silent, focusing his attention instead on sweeping the last of the broken plate from the floor into his hand. Dean reached forward at the same time to help and their hands touched. It was only brief, their fingers barely grazing each other, but Dean withdrew like he had been burned. He cleared his throat and quickly strode over to the bin to dispose of bits of the plate. He held the lid open as Castiel followed and emptied his hands and brushed the miniscule pieces of ceramic from his skin.
Though he knew Dean wouldn’t actually leave without him, he took no time in changing into a pair of Dean’s jeans and one of his many plaid shirts before shoving everything else into his bag and following Dean out the door. He nodded once at the same receptionist that had checked them in the day before but she didn’t return the gesture, instead rolling her eyes and placing a set of headphones over her ears.
“I begged for it,” Purah recalled. And Cas knew exactly what she meant. He knew what it was to call to it like a terrifying saviour.
“Was a bit hard to try and juggle a stereo and coffee.”
Cas took his time to splash his face with cold water, hoping it would refresh him, but instead it made everything seem worse and his foul mood only amplified. There was no way he would allow this to happen again tomorrow; he was going to put his foot down on the matter and be firm in his resolve.
“You think I’m pretending to be happy?” Cas averted his gaze, suddenly very interested in his drink.
The accusation stung.
Cas eagerly took a swig and smiled at the flavour that was gentler on his tastebuds. It had a strong punch to it that he really started to feel not long after his second sip. But the cranberry gave it a tart taste that eased him into an accelerated pace of drinking until he emptied his glass before Dean had gotten even halfway through his.
“It seemed like the right thing to do…” Castiel murmured.
“Okay… just let me know if you change your mind. I can get you whatever you want,” Cas offered gently. He finally closed his eyes, his brow furrowing.
It always seemed to be Sam reminding him that there was still hope. It was always Sam trying to guide him back to his feet each and every time he fell. For Dean, he more often than not believed in the worst possible outcome. He was entirely convinced that he would always do wrong and bring harm and death to those that loved him. But he kept it all inside. He hid it beneath layers of liquor and hunting and long drives to nowhere. And he stoically told Sam to pull himself up by the bootstraps, and to power through the way they always did—to fight and keep the monsters from defeating them.
“Naww, you’re worried about me?”
“You tell me. Is it too cold, Cas?” Dean asked with a crooked smile and gently thumped the roof of the Impala with his hand.
Castiel realised that Dean’s life on the road made his love life fleeting.
Maybe Cas somehow knew in death that Dean still loved him and always would.
Cas came around to his side of the table and stood just beyond Dean’s shoulder. He leaned forward and touched the carved
Dean blinked, refusing to accept what he was hearing. “What the hell are you talking about?”
Castiel gnawed gently at his bottom lip and sat up in his bed. He listened briefly for the sound of footsteps that he already knew weren’t there. Despite all his previous fears about Dean’s absence having been proven false, Cas still found himself expecting the worst. The distress felt warranted this time; very real and deserved, in a way it never had before. This was the latest Dean had ever been, and all signs seemed to suggest that the wait was going to be endless this time. Cas likely wouldn’t see Dean until breakfast. He imagined them returning to their old routine: making coffee that only Sam would dare drink, burning the toast while Sam made them a proper meal, Dean then remaking the coffee, and the three of them sitting together in a tired silence. As far as routines go, it was a good one. Cas had been perfectly content with it for all those weeks since they had returned from their hunt. But ever since he and Dean had allocated those few, secretive hours alone together, something in the old pattern had changed. It was a small shift in the familiar, so miniscule in fact, that Cas often wondered if he had imagined it, but at the kitchen table it became impossible to deny it.
“It’s better than being dead,” Sam points out.
The spit isn’t enough: he wants to glide into Dean seamlessly. Like he belongs. He conjures lube on his fingers and circles them against Dean’s pucker while he licks up the base of Dean’s cock. Dean shudders, rocking forward and back between Cas’ hand and his mouth.
Cas didn’t say anything for a while, just looked the tree up and down, from the thick, burly roots to the canopy that threw dappled light on their faces. “I want to reclaim it,” he said.
“So,” Dean said softly, “Do you like Guns ‘n’ Roses?”
It’s some time before Dean’s breathing calms enough for him to whisper, “But you heard.”
“Always.”
“Yeah, well, I know you. Come on, get up and help me look for Cas. Unless you’re stuck.” Sam pulled himself free of the bath tub with minimal struggle and stood.
This human form is... Confusing. But I know, Dean. The least you could do is have the courtesy to admit the truth."
“Well, as I lay on the floor bleeding and cursing myself, I happened to notice this book. Just out of reach. And I thought, I wonder what’s inside it. I dragged myself up, because there was something strange about it, something that made me want to read it. And the first page I flipped to said this-” Cas cleared his throat and Dean watched him, heart beating a strange rhythm, “
Dean watched him laugh with that sort of steady adoration that people who have fallen in love only begin to show after they realize how deeply they’ve fallen. It said,
“Christ, yes, do you need to rub salt in it like that?” Dean groans.
“It’s like ten miles!” Dean protested as Sam poked his head back inside.
“Inside me,” he muttered incoherently against Dean’s neck. “Love you. Fuck. Need you. Show me how you love me. With your hands. Yes, Dean.”
Cas bit his lip, hard, and heat was coiling in Dean’s gut, begging to be released. He squeezed himself tighter and let himself go to the push and pull of his hand, the sound of he and Cas’ breathing, and the steady blue eyes on him.
Dean closed his eyes as he recognized the song. “Perfect,” he told Cas, when the angel reappeared, fumbling around in the pocket of his trench coat before drawing out a joint. Dean still couldn’t quite believe they were doing this. He reached for his lighter, and lit up the end of the joint barely, letting it smolder to a cherry red glow. Cas watched with intrigue as Dean brought it to his lips and inhaled, fighting the tickling urge to cough. Dean reached up and tilted Cas’ chin up to him, marveling at how easily the angel surrendered to his touch. He leaned down, Cas parting his lips obligingly, and blew a sweet puff of smoke into Cas’ mouth. Cas inhaled and held it for a moment before blowing it out.
“That’s all of them,” Sam announced somewhat unnecessarily, clutching his shoulder.
Dean chewed on that for a moment. He ran a finger through the water, watching the waves it created in its wake. “Penny for your thoughts?”
“This is Gordon Lightfoot, by the way. Played a twelve string guitar. I thought you might like him, cause you’re into that whole manly yet sensitive music.” Dean quirked a smile.
They were sitting in the Impala, driving slowly through the street. The windows were rolled down, night air gently gracing their cheeks. Dean tapped his fingers against the smooth steering wheel in time with the rock oozing out of the car speakers.
“I know.” Cas ran a hand down his back.
Cas frowned for a second, and then his face split into a smile. He cupped both sides of Dean’s face and kissed him long and hard. Dean panted when they split apart. “That was… that was…” he floundered for words. “Damnit, Cas,” he finally breathed out.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas moaned, loud and unashamed. Dean did what he could to thrust into Cas, and Cas fucked himself down onto Dean’s thick cock. The fact that they were literally in midair, that Cas was holding him up with his grace, that they had both totally lost control –
“Okay. Yeah.” So Dean leads him, half-asleep and with a side of the shakes from whiskey withdrawal, up to the roof of the bunker. It’s worth it for the way Cas’ eyes go wide when he sees the moon. Dean sits against the wall and watches Cas spread out his arms and spin around. “Sure am a goner,” he muttered with a heavy awareness this would all be less easy in the morning. It was already less easy. It had started the second he let go of Cas, because he didn’t know how to ask how to touch him again. How did one even begin to ask those things?
Cas said with a blissed out smile, “As you wish.”
"...And?" I wasn't entirely sure what he was talking about. Had I once had marbles? Had I lost them?
Dean crushed his lips to Cas, and it was sweet and his head spun, before he said simply, “No.” Cas let out a desperate breath and nodded once. Dean kissed him again, sloppy and too hard. Then he was coming, hammering into Cas with everything he had, their bodies desperately fucking together as he shouted Cas’ name. He spurted his hot release on Cas’ velvety inner walls, and the second he did, he could feel Cas’ body jerking helplessly against him. For a moment, he thought Cas had started coming, but when he looked down, Cas’ dick was still hard and weeping precome between their stomachs. He stayed buried in Cas for a moment and wrapped him in his arms. He waited for the haze of his own orgasm to fade and held Cas as the angel twitched and gasped, hands trembling on Dean’s back. “Cas?” he asked. “You OK?”
Desolation stole over him, icy and relentless. That wasn’t… it couldn’t… no. He stared up at the window, searching the blue desperately for anything, for any shred of hope hidden in the ribbons of cloud.
“I’ll see you in the car. You’ve got two minutes and fifteen seconds,” Dean beamed and ruffled Castiel’s already messy hair before disappearing out the door.
He couldn’t decide why this distressed him as much as it did… whether it was because he didn’t understand the method or because it possibly meant that he didn’t truly understand Dean. Not in the way he once thought he did.
Castiel always seemed to understand.
Cas took a quick look at himself, suddenly growing concerned that perhaps the pants had slid down further than he was used to; but no, they were still settled low on his hips. Any time he would feel them slip he would tug them up again without ever giving it much thought.
Cas scooted up onto it with his back half leaning against the windshield and was careful not to damage the paint with the heels of his shoes. Dean settled himself at his side and offered him a beer. Castiel doubted that the alcohol would do him much good but took it anyway and opened it without taking a sip. Dean however, took a large swig and leaned back against the windshield, closing his eyes. Cas tried to mimic him but ended up staring at the hunter instead; appraising the look of contentedness on the hunter’s face. He observed the length of Dean’s eyelashes and the faint spattering of freckles on his nose, and gazed at Dean’s lips for a few moments longer than he probably should. He looked away only when Dean opened his eyes.
“What?” Dean’s head was swimming. Distantly, he could hear Sam crying out in pain.
“You act as though the world’s ending… again,” Dean chuckled darkly and stepped in after him. He cursed under his breath and mimicked Cas’ tense stance, but purposely stood and took the brunt of the cold so Cas didn’t have to.
But things weren’t the same anymore. Since losing Cas, it had become all the more clear to him just how precarious it all was. Dean wasn’t sure he could survive it this time. Not again. He was worn by loss and heartache, and mourning was an act he knew intimately. Death, too, was a familiarity, but not one he was at all comforted by. And, these days, it was far too easy to imagine the worst. Even for Castiel who was stronger and more infallible than most. Being an angel hadn’t done Cas any favours in the end, and it was sure not to do any for Castiel either if it came to that.
They were making sure of it.
Dean chuckled darkly and nudged Cas’ leg with his knee. “Hey, Cas… vodka and gin,” he teased.
From what he could understand, the lyrics described a journey, not unlike the one they had just embarked on together where there wasn’t an end in sight—ultimately the destination didn’t matter. It was a voyage into the unknown with assured pain and glory, a life loose from any restraints. Cas suddenly understood the appeal it held for Dean; after all, it was just like the only life Dean really knew: just himself, Sam, the Impala, and the road.
“Of course not. Both of us must be subjected to it,” Dean corrected him. “Now come on! Live a little, Cas.”
“Ugh. Please… don’t say vodka or gin.”
Cas distinctly felt ridiculous standing there naked and shivering despite the definite heat radiating all over his skin. There wasn’t any way he could look any worse, and he knew his breath smelled of alcohol and bile, and his face—as he saw himself in the mirror—was both red and blotchy and covered in sweat and tears.
He should have known not to waste his breath on asking such a reasonable question of Dean. It was typical of him and his brother to be careless with their wellbeing. They had both grown accustomed to these impractical methods and saw no need to change. It hadn’t been such a concern in the past when Cas could heal them in an instant, but now he realised just how irresponsible it really was. In his mind, he made a point for later reference to force them to change their ways.
“I’d call you an idiot but I think you already know that,” Sam said strictly. He sat down across from Dean and tossed the cloth aside.
Like before, Castiel’s gut began to churn at the memory. But this time the disgust stemmed not from the water’s resemblance to the two liquors, but rather the other way round. Water confronted him the way a blood test would a person afraid of needles. He still shrivelled under its touch. The subtle taste of it evoked the immediate need to regurgitate. Slowly, he’d forced more than a mouthful at a time past his lips, trying fretfully to remind himself of the threat it lacked. But mostly he was resigned to drinking the cups of coffee Sam left outside his door a couple of times a day; its dark hue and bitter palate allowed him to drink it with little more strain than the occasional cough. When he relied on coffee, it was only the literal heat of it that would make his throat burn. But he knew it couldn’t remain this way forever. Coffee could only sustain him for so long. And he was due for another shower. Cas touched his unkempt hair gingerly and felt the grease between his fingers. The beginnings of panic began to brew in his chest. His silence lay stark in the room for both he and Dean to perceive and resent.
Dean took the bag of salts and the candle from him and nodded with a kind smile. “You do that, and I’ll run you a bath.”
“Maybe he will,” Sam agreed and stood up. He picked up the two mugs of coffee and carried them out through the door. His stride was far too confident for Dean’s liking.
“Not enough,” Dean argued. Much to Cas’ surprise, Dean ran his hands up along his sides—starting just above his hips and stopping at his armpits. “You’re skinnier already. You keep going on that way, you’ll be nothing but skin and bones.”
A hand clasped around his throat and squeezed tight. Cas fought for air. His hands pulled against the cuffs, rattling the chains. The sound echoed throughout the room, encasing them in it. His body was fighting of its own accord, his lungs contracting and mouth opening. His legs kicked and his feet scuffed the floor. But, inside, he had already given up. There was no real fight left in him. He didn’t expect to get out of this alive. And maybe he didn’t really want to.
So... it has been a long time since I last updated. I wish I could say that I was too busy to write more often, but that simply isn't true. It's true I was never in a proper lockdown and have been working throughout this entire panini, but I could definitely write more often if I tried harder. I can't guarantee the next chapter will be posted anytime soon, but I promise to try harder. However, I will be working on a chapter for my other unfinished Destiel fic before coming back to this one. I hope you enjoyed this chapter-- I admit I deleted and started it over numerous times haha. Until next time xoxo :)
And, god, was he glad to feel it go.
“I don’t know, Sam. Alright?” Dean muttered, shrugging again, “It’s…” He swallowed hard before trying again, “Cas.”
“Well maybe you should,” Dean said, his hope deflating, “it’s Earth. This is the bunker. This room—”
“Cause it’s such a good home to go back to,” Dean scoffed. He closed his laptop with a little more force than he had intended and pushed it aside. He shook his head in frustration. The more he thought about it, the more he hated the idea of sending Castiel back to that shithole of a world.
Without the answers he wanted to hear, Dean was obviously distraught, storming onward with a rage fuelled determination that quickly wavered and then he walked like an empty shell, hope abandoned. It was evident mostly in his shoulders that slumped forward, and in his hands that he compulsively clenched and unclenched, and Benny was starting to see the signs more and more often. He started to worry that maybe Dean would simply give up. After all, Dean had clearly said countless times that he wasn’t leaving without Castiel, and he obviously meant it. Which could only mean one thing: Dean would die here.
Before Dean could reply, Cas clambered into the passenger seat and shut his door. Dean hesitated to follow, testing the doorhandle warily twice before finally opening the door and settling down in the seat beside him. He cleared his throat uncomfortably and fumbled with the keys, suddenly at a loss as to which key was which. Cas watched him, mildly bemused, unsure as to how Dean’s bitterness could so closely resemble the sadness Cas so often felt.
“I’m just not ready yet, Dean,” Cas explained gently, opening his eyes again to peer out the windshield where Dean had once again reached out to clear the fog from the glass.
Dean finally emerged from his room with numerous empty bottles from many previous drunken nights—last night included—clasped in each hand. He hadn’t realised how much had built up over time, the surface area of his desk and bedside tables cluttered with the remnants of multiple evenings spent intoxicated to some degree. He stepped into the kitchen and bypassed Sam to dispose of them, dropping them into the bin. They landed with a sharp clatter that made him wince. Dean rubbed his temples firmly and briefly shut his tired eyes, grimacing again when Sam began haphazardly washing dishes in the sink; cups hitting plates, and cutlery grinding against the metal basin.
Dean hesitated. He couldn’t run from this forever. Sam was bound to ask every day for the rest of time until Dean answered. And the longer he delayed, the worse this tension between him and Sam would become—to the point of being utterly unbearable. Each day he refused to deny his feelings for Castiel, the more space Sam would force between him and the angel.
“You can. Benny, tell him.”
“Oh so now
“Because if I see what Heaven’s become, what I… what I made of it… I’m afraid I might kill myself.”
Thanks for reading, guys! Sorry it took so long to update! I honestly got in a writer's block on this one, but I do intend to keep going (though I can't promise that I'll upload on a regular basis) Also, as I started writing this before Season 13 started, I intend to stick with something akin to my original plan, so very little will actually be influenced by the new episodes. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and let me know what you thought in the comments! :)
“I like it cooked,” Cas stabbed at it with his fork.
“Oh yeah, that’s all,” Dean scoffed, “give me a real challenge. Like… blow up the moon or hook up with Scarlett Johansson.”
“So… what’s up, Martha Stewart?” Dean asked curiously. Cas could hear him turning off the heat and stirring the apples. The sizzling completely died down.
old.”
Castiel automatically walked close to Dean’s side, his cuffed hand brushing against Dean’s unrestrained one. Dean carefully reached with his fingers to touch the back of Castiel’s hand, brushing against the skin of his knuckles and then feeling the warmth of his palm. Castiel gently squeezed his fingers before letting go, somehow anticipating Sam turning around just in time.
Suddenly, the door at the top of stairs closed with a loud clang and Dean and Castiel quickly parted from one another, but Sam had already seen. Castiel, still stunned by what had happened, slowly adjusted his askew tie and fixed some of the buttons on his shirt that had become undone from Dean’s desperate hands tugging at his clothes. His hair was now a dishevelled mess. Dean brought his fist to his lips and rubbed them, knowing they probably looked swollen from the kissing, and his eyes were littered with guilt and embarrassment.
Cas submitted to Dean immediately. For once, he wanted the hunter to be in control. Cas wanted to give into someone else’s sense of belonging. He needed to know for sure he was wanted.
Dean stepped into the bar and was immediately hit in the face with the strong scent of alcohol. It was everywhere: bottled, tapped, poured, and spilled into every crevice of the place. It had become part of the building itself over the years. Were it ever to close and sit abandoned for decades, the scent would diminish but never fade entirely. Much like his sharp edges.
“There was nothing to watch,” he explained between kisses; his breath warm now between Dean’s nipples.
you expect them to.”
Castiel waited for Dean to answer him—to explain all that couldn’t be explained. He either didn’t know that Dean was the wrong person to ask, or he had become so desperate that he would accept answers from whoever was willing to give them—no matter if they were right or wrong.
“Long drives alone don’t get me the way they used to. It used to be freeing, all that open road and good music and the thrum of Baby’s engine just for me. Couldn’t ask for more. But I guess after so long hunting with Sam and… and after so long… with you, it just doesn’t feel the same anymore.”
Dean couldn’t bear to be that person again; someone able to look into the eyes of someone he loved—even if they weren’t who they used to be—and to kill them.
Castiel hadn’t known, but he felt like he should have.
Dean described them as the daytime giants, and informed Castiel that the same people were much rowdier at night when they switched their beer out for much harder liquor. This was the only reason why Castiel remained cautious and purposely avoided making eye contact—as both Sam and Dean had told him that most strangers might not take kindly to being stared at. He thought it was best not to set them off. It was hard to say whether he could hold up in a fight anymore; not since his reflexes had slowed considerably and all his power had been stripped from him. As it turned out, skill couldn’t always combat strength. And he wasn’t about to test it anytime soon. But he sometimes thought he seemed foolish sitting there beside the hunter with nothing to offer him, not even the protection he was once able to provide.
“Maybe not,” Sam granted, “but he doesn’t blame you. I think he just doesn’t always understand you.”
If he understood the reason, then he could at the very least try to justify it. If there was a cause to this ache in his chest and to the repetitive hateful thoughts pounding inside his head, then he could rightly say that he was okay. That it was yet another human thing he had yet to fully comprehend.
Cas always cherished those moments.
“It’s all good,” Dean interjected quickly. The label on his bottle came off in one large piece. Dean crumpled it into a ball and dropped it in the trash before leaning back against the counter.
kind of love. Deep down maybe… Or maybe not so deep after all.
Dean blinked. Something felt passive aggressive about it. But Dean couldn’t for the life of him detect what it was exactly or why. As far as he knew, Castiel had always been on board to return to his own world, to resume the war the angels had been waging for however many years. He had seemed insistent on saving as many of God Squad as possible—a soldier never abandoning his troops.
“Look, I can make the girls swoon when I’m on my game. I’m just rusty at the moment,” Dean attested, kicking Cas’ leg again. This time his foot lingered against Castiel’s shin, the toe of his boot almost creeping under the hem of his jeans at the ankle. Castiel rubbed the back of his neck roughly and swallowed firmly.
“Cas—” he started, his voice stern.
He looked at Dean with anxiety evident in his eyes and Dean clapped him once on the shoulder and gave his arm a gentle squeeze, assuring him with a smile that there was nothing to worry about. Supposedly, or at least according to Dean, this was something all travellers did at least once, and none of them would ever regret it even if they did wake up on the curb without their wallet and keys or if they found out later that they had been thrown out for being too intoxicated and making a scene. Despite saying that the positives outweighed those negative outcomes, Dean failed to convince him, and so he went in feeling just as nervous as before.
Perhaps that was enough to calm Dean’s fear. It was certainly enough to keep him reasonable for a number of years. And that was all he could have asked for in this life—a father figure who didn’t have to be perfect, just perfect enough.
secret from Sam, but what if that secret, in the few hours between falling asleep and waking, had vanished?
“So you didn’t initiate a poor attempt at flirtation just now? Such a nice smile?”
“The signal might be poor here, now that I think about it,” Cas murmured.
They didn’t even need to say a single word to each other now, instead just sitting together in silence and sipping their beers and feeling the cool Fall breeze on their faces. The sun was starting to set and the light slowly dimmed until they were settled in a pale orange glow with the darkness of nightfall creeping in steadily from above.
Sam considered it and gestured to the cluttered table of open books and papers, “This is too important… we’ve got to find mum. We’ve got to take Castiel back—”
He always protested against the heat in Castiel’s room, claiming he was sweating enough as it was just being there, but Cas had always suspected that there may have been something more to it. Something Dean didn’t wish to voice, and Cas wouldn’t dare pressure him to explain. Now, all previously unspoken aversions disappeared. Dean got comfortable and Cas was highly aware of the skin of Dean’s thighs against his own, and Dean’s arm pressed flush against his, and Dean’s breath hot against his neck. Now that Dean was closer, Cas could more distinctly smell the beer on his breath, though it was mixed with a definite tang of mint toothpaste. Even brushing his teeth hadn’t been enough to mask his night of drinking, so Castiel suspected that Dean had most definitely had enough to get suitably drunk.
“We’re going,” he said and cleared his throat awkwardly.
“We’re never gonna make it to the next motel if you keep needing to stop every five minutes.”
“I’ll be fine,” Castiel assured him. Removing thread from his wounds couldn’t be any more painful than receiving the cuts in the first place.
“I never nag,” Dean mocked offence.
But then, alone without Dean’s eyes on him, Cas couldn’t sleep. His eyelids felt heavy and his attention was sparse, but still he couldn’t let himself go. His mortality was suddenly so real and physical in his chest and he couldn’t think beyond his missing grace and wings. He shouldn’t feel cramped or tired or cold. He shouldn’t have needed to stop twice for bathroom breaks since going back on the road. But nevertheless, he felt and needed all of those things, and he didn’t have anyone to blame aside from himself. And he imagined how the angels must feel with their own wings torn and useless, their way home sealed and their lives as they knew them, gone. This, too, was something he was held responsible for.
“You done?” Dean asked and gestured to Castiel’s plate.
Everything was a complete disaster. It was probably an abysmal plan to begin with, but he never expected for it to fall apart quite so tremendously. Cas was up to his elbows in flour—which was a place he had never once found himself in before and hoped never to be again. The apple mixture on the stove appeared to be fast bubbling over; he didn’t think it was supposed to
he kept telling himself.
“You’re getting your sleeves wet,” Dean said and stepped around the car. He took the lapels of Castiel’s coat into his hands and eased the material off his shoulders and slung it over his arm. “Try rolling your shirt sleeves up.”
“I don’t know either,” Sam admitted. “And this isn’t something that’s just gonna pass on its own. The only thing we can do is keep looking for a way to send the angels back to Heaven.”
“Humanity isn’t without its perks, Dean. There’s much to consider—even hypothetically,” Cas responded carefully. The words felt like lies on his tongue because Dean had this air about him that so often made Cas vulnerable to telling the truth—but now there was something in his watchful eyes that made honesty feel dangerous. He tried to sidestep the whole truth to how humanity settled uncomfortably in his chest.  Instead of admitting how mortality felt burdensome and cruel to him, or how the stolen grace had left him in the void, he sought out whatever words he thought Dean needed to hear.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” Castiel retorted and grabbed Dean’s arm and wrapped it around the back of his neck and slid his own arm around Dean’s waist to help him stand. Dean grunted in protest but didn’t push Cas away now and instead leant into him; the blood loss making all the colour drain from his face.
This Castiel either didn’t notice, or, more likely, simply didn’t care.
Castiel knew what was coming, and there was nothing he could do but keep whispering Dean’s name and shut his eyes to the bright light of Sophia’s dying grace as a blade pierced through her heart from the front. Purah urged the blade in deeper and held Sophia’s chin in her hands, bathing herself in the same flash of white that momentarily robbed Castiel of sight.
“I don’t know what you mean.”
When it came to Dean, you had to talk fast or not talk at all—and for Cas, even after all was said and done and everything had already slipped into the realms of the past, that sense of guilt wouldn’t leave him. And somehow, someway, he always found himself shattering Dean’s hope and loyalty. And for that, Castiel could never be sorry enough.
“Look, Cas, we can still make this work. I was bugging you… coming into your room all the time. I can give you your space, alright?” Dean said, still trying to reason with him.
, and their ‘
He, too, found more appreciation for coffee. His usual black coffee was now doused with milk and sugar—two sugars to be exact—which was another preference Dean had come to learn within the first couple days of Cas taking residence in the bunker. Each morning before they had left, Cas had woken up and gone to the kitchen to find a fresh cup of coffee waiting for him, and it was always just right.
The small part of him that didn’t want to die just wanted to be held, to be caressed and comforted and healed by time and attention. He wanted to rest in the warmth of Dean’s bed and fall into the first truly peaceful, dreamless sleep he ever had. That’s all he needed to survive, and perhaps it was enough to
He eased the car forward alongside the gas pump and got out to fill up the tank. Misty rain dusted his skin and settled on his hair, making him shiver and desire the comfort of Dean’s warm bed. The rain had come and washed away the sludgy snow from the road, but the air was still crisp and it bit through his coat. Cas tried his best to ignore it and focused his attention on the task at hand. It did no good to dwell on what he couldn’t have; a warm bed and a roof over his head. He had no right to take the unfortunate weather as an omen—he knew exactly what it meant when he left.
He watched as Sam set a steady pace sterilizing, snipping, and pulling the stitches from the wounds. He made it look like easy work, his fingers focused but his mind free to drift from the task at hand to things perhaps more trivial. Cas could see the distraction behind his eyes and thought it comforting that Sam didn’t consider this particularly demanding. There was nothing to fear here; Castiel was healing. The danger had passed. There was reassurance in this long and contented silence.
“I’ve been meaning to, but I never found the time.”
Castiel couldn’t bring himself to ask which.
Suddenly, a hand appeared by his head with a glass of water held out in offering. He wordlessly took it and investigated the contents of the glass, wondering why something so pure was making him feel all the more sick. He wrinkled his nose in mild disgust and went to set the glass down beside him on the floor.
“I know,” Castiel granted.
“You aren’t going it alone, Castiel,” Sam said and placed a hand on his shoulder, pushing him back toward the portal.
“This is stupid,” Dean said, but from just those words, they both knew he’d agreed.
“Oh.” Dean said finally.
“Dean,” The angel said after a time. “I’d like you to fuck me now.”
“Dean,” he said warmly, and the sound of his voice ignited something deep inside of Dean.
Because I'm too nice to let you wait in suspense and also because I wanna know what you guys thinks of this: the next chapter! You shouldn't need too many tissues.
Dean ran a hand through his hair. “OK,” he said finally.
“Hey.” The hunter said, pausing by Castiel’s shoulder.
While Sam let out a happily tired, “Yeah,” Cas answered, “I believe so.”
Dean held onto Cas tightly, every thought and care about being gentle gone with the wind. He stroked Cas’ cock in time with his thrusts, and could tell by the clenching of Cas’ muscles he was nearly gone. Cas was breathing a litany of broken praise and prayers in his ear, but as it broke off into a loud moan, Dean lost it. They came apart together, Dean shooting hot cum into Cas, Cas coming across their stomachs. He cried out, and his world shrank in that moment to Cas. Only Cas. It took quite a while for it to return to normal, and when it did, it seemed somehow different.
Cas cocks his head to one side, body suddenly still. His blue eyes are oceans Dean wants to lose himself in. "Let me show you," Cas says, like it's a question he already knows the answer to. "Trust me. Dean?" He asks.
Cas stopped without warning, and the smile slowly faded from Dean’s face. Cas was staring down at him contemplatively, seeming to have forgotten that they were hard and straining for each other in their jeans. Cas said in satisfaction. “I think I know how to start know.”
Cas could barely sit still, running his hands over the buttons and peering through the viewfinder, while Sam handed Dean another immaculately wrapped present. Dean tore it open with no regrets, and grinned when he saw what was inside. “Sammy,” he laughed.
I don't know what it was that prompted me to say it. Perhaps my sanity had been the last barrier to the words, or maybe it was the smell of flowers mixing with the scent of sweat. "I love you, you know."
“Yeah. I’m seeing her in February.” Sam said nervously. “I don’t know, Dean. She’s always so serious about us, but I know she has her boundaries, and for good reasons. I think she wants to be more, but she thinks maybe we shouldn’t, for my sake even. God, I don’t know. Maybe I should have tried dating men.” One side of his mouth turned up, and Dean rolled his eyes.
“Smoke,” Dean corrected him. “You smoke weed. Not ‘do’ it.”
“They’re not fall-” a leaf rudely interrupted Cas’ sentence by drifting in front of his face. His blue eyes widened almost comically, and he snatched the leaf out of the air. He studied it, turning it between his finger tips, before blowing it up and letting it settle to the ground. He grinned up at Dean, and all of a sudden the figure in the trench coat seemed human again, not some celestial being who needed love explained to them. Dean could feel it again; the breaking, inside him.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean said, breaking away for air. “What are you-”
He reached out, and handed me what appeared to be cooking oil. I cocked my head to one side, and he let out a throaty groan before squeezing some onto my fingers. He guided them between his thighs, between his butt cheeks, and pushed them inside. My eyes went wide. Precum dribbled down my dick, and I started thrusting my finger in and out of him. He closed his eyes, and I growled at the loss of that absynth green, that rough shine. He whispered instructions to me through gritted teeth, telling me what to do.
“Good?” Cas asked, with one eyebrow arched.
“Yeah.” Dean tapped his fingers against the table. “You wanna hear the rest of the album?”
Can't Help Falling In Love With You, by Elvis Presley
“No. I wish to understand the altered state of consciousness which many humans tapped into by using chemical substances. I want to explore the experience.” Cas stared at him for a long moment.
Surrender tastes sweet.
“Outside.” Cas pulled a book out of the shelf and held it in his palm reverently.
Dean sighed, running a hand through his hair. It was barely eleven o’clock, and a summer rainstorm had taken him by surprise. Sam was running errands, picking up beer and whatever girly essentials he needed. Dean paused. Where was Cas this time?
“You banged yet?”
Cas didn’t say anything for a long time. Dean wasn’t even sure he’d heard the question, until the response came, harsh and blunt. “I want you.”
him. Really, truly, begging.
the human stuff.” When Cas didn’t say anything, he whispered into Cas’ ear huskily, “I want to show you all the ways you can feel.”
“Uh. Maybe. Maybe it worked.” Sam sat down cross-legged next to Dean, who stayed kneeling. The silence closed in around them.
The fifth song on the mix-tape was Led Zeppelin. Of course. Dean stood in The Greenhouse, and his breath had been swept away.
“Dean,” Cas said quietly, later, when he was lying in Dean’s arms and Dean was just about to drift off.
“Still… I… I shouldn’t have made you stay. Just because I wanted you to. Just because I thought it’d help. You’re not like me, man. You’re an angel and I guess I
In the way you can't look away from me.
“I didn’t bring you here to make you cry,” Cas said helplessly, eyes searching Dean’s face. “I wanted to show you our start. However bloody, and I can scarcely imagine what digging your way out of your own grave feels like - however strange our start was, it led to something…” Cas hesitated. “Beautiful. That’s what I wanted to show you. That’s all.”
“I want you right here,” Dean whispered, his breath hot on Cas’ ear. “In the light. We’ll watch the rain fall and the storm will come in. I want you, Cas. Right here.”
Cas picked up his guitar, and sat there, looking small next to the giant tree. He wasn’t good yet, but he was better. Dean loved watching how he pulled the guitar smoothly onto his lap and fit around it, maybe because that was how they were together, too, fitting together. It was good to see Cas at ease with something, even if it was a beatup guitar and a broken hunter. He started to play, and Dean’s mouth fell open into a soft ‘O’ shape. Cas was playing Dean’s song. He’d muttered it into Cas’ one neck, when their after sex sweat was still cooling, that if how Cas felt was Annie’s song, how he felt was Nothing Else Matters. Cas hated Metallica, but Dean knew he didn’t hate that song. Couldn’t. Cas sang, low and twisting and sweet.
Cas nodded against Dean's hand. "When you're finished making the chair, we'll talk."
everything. It’s just whether I chose to let it affect my vessel or not.” Cas stated off-handedly.
SO. I have plotted out my ideas and chapters and... don't shoot... according to my calculations, there are about seven chapters remaining, including this one. As much as it will pain me to leave this fic and you, it's lovely readers, I promise you they are a good seven chapters in which things will be wrapped up, resolved and started, angst and fluff with a genuine romantic bow on top. I'm excited, I hope you like it!
Cas collapsed to his knees in front of Dean, and before Dean knew what was happening, Cas’ hands were everywhere, skimming over him, holding him. “Dean,” Cas growled. “Are you all right? Dean.” He looked down. “I couldn’t control it, not towards the end. I think I started to appear in some aspect of my true form, I started pouring more of myself into you… Dean, are you all right?”
“So. I haven’t really thought this part through. We can pretend this never happened if you’d like, and go back to how things were. Or we can… see what happens and fuck the consequences.” Dean let out a startled laugh and Cas smiled sheepishly. The tension in the air was gone.
It felt like he’d confessed something just then, like he’d laid everything bare and opened himself up to a world of hurt far beyond the words ‘I’m cold’ implied.
"There'll be bees in the garden soon. Spring coming and everything," Sam said offhandedly, before walking away.
"Dean," Castiel panted. "Dean." Again and again, until Dean couldn't hold back any more.
Cas smiled, and with a relative amount of grace carried Dean to the Impala and set him on the edge of the back seat. Dean scooted backwards, grabbing at Cas’ hands and pulling the angel with him. The music was louder in here, thrumming through his bones, and Dean glanced around the car fondly. “Made some pretty good memories in here, huh?” Dean said.

“After I found the angel tablet… after I nearly killed you, and I left, I ended up on a bus going down this exact highway. And it was the first time,” Cas laughed, ducking his head, “I realized that maybe the idea of heartbreak could apply to me too.” Dean closed his eyes. “You said you needed me, but I – I couldn’t stay. The finer intricacies of human emotion: wanting, loving, wishing, those take longer to comprehend. But
So I looked over at him, and I think he saw the storm gathering in my eyes. I leaned closer. Our lips collided, and I pulled him to me, pinning him up against the house walls. He moaned into our kissing, and I licked my way hungrily into his mouth. It felt good, to use this muscle and flesh and bone which was made for fighting wars to love him. We were soldiers, but in that moment, we were only fighting for air.
“If you’re inquiring about our ‘relationship status’-” Cas made his infamous airquotes and continued, “Then I believe there aren’t quite descriptive terms.”
“I know you didn’t want me like that. But I – I can’t help it. You know, at first, I was scared of you. You pulled me out of hell, told me you could throw me back in. You were so much bigger than anything we’d ever faced, but kinda...electric. Like I wanted to be close to you even though it was dangerous. But then we fought together. Two piss-poor soldiers with deadbeat dads. That was okay, that was good. It was when you turned on us, when the Leviathan got your ass, that I realized how bad it hurt. I kept your coat ‘cos I didn’t know what else to do. And then you came back, but you kept on
“Dean, I…” Cas ran his hands along it, exploring every inch oddly tenderly. Dean refused to let his breath hitch, drawing in air steadily. He couldn’t be imagining what it would feel like if Cas touched him like that. Thing was, Cas did touch him like that. Whenever they hugged each other close, or sat without talking, their shoulders touching, or when their fingertips touched – that was exactly how Cas touched him. Fuck, that breaking feeling was back.
“With any luck,” the hunter muttered, “It’ll still be here.”
“I-” I didn’t know what to say.
That was when Cas started to swear.
As he ran a thumb up the center of Cas’ spine, he started talking. “You know, I like to think none of the rules apply when it comes to us. Seems like everything I love burns. But you stuck around. Keep coming back, actually.” Dean was so caught up in the gentle guitar and the feel of Cas’ skin and the soft sighs he made and trying to get the words across that it never occurred to him that he’d just told Cas he loved him. He could swear as he talked, he could see the faintest shadow of wings appearing across the floor. It wasn’t like when Cas had done the same thing to intimidate him the first time they’d met. If you could call it ‘meeting’, exactly. He was pretty sure Cas didn’t even know it was happening.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he thinks that should be funny. Cas, the nearly virgin angel, asking to show him. He doesn't think about that. For no other reason than that he trusts Cas more than he trusts himself, Dean nods sharply, and Cas surges up against him, claiming Dean's lips, his tongue, as his own. His free hand skims up Dean's chest before coming to rest on his handprint, fingers perfectly filling it. Dean gasps. All the times he'd imagined this, it'd never felt that good. Cas nudges his chin back, and Dean lets his eyelids flutter closed as Cas licks along his throat, sucking dark bruises there. Ordinarily, Dean would never let anyone claim him like that. Sure, he'd let girls give him hickeys, and he'd wear them for days afterwards, proclaiming to the street, 'hey, I got laid.' This was different. This felt like a sign of possession, and Dean couldn't bring himself to hate it. He wanted to lose himself in it, in Cas.
Cas grudgingly zipped up his coat and nestled his chin into the flipped up collar. The wind bit at him through every single layer and eventually slowed him into a shivering mass. By now he was weak with hunger and thirst, the pangs of his stomach and the cracks in his lips burdening him with human needs that demanded to be met. With a numb hand, he felt for the remaining cash in his pocket and decided to use it on what he figured would likely be his last meal. He ducked around the next two blocks before stepping into a quiet coffee shop. It was mostly empty this time of morning. Most of the civilians had already come and gone on their way to work. There were plenty of seats to choose from and so he sat in the furthest corner of the room, away from the window where he was sure the cold would seep through the glass. He rubbed his chilled hands together and watched as a waitress came to his table.
“Tabbris, you’re being excessive,” Sophia scolded.
“Well thank god for small mercies,” Dean coughed. He tentatively stepped further into the room and approached Castiel with the same wariness he would normally reserve for a rotting corpse. “Have you showered? Eaten?”
It was amazing, even to him, how quickly one awful experience could change everything.
The brothers had, on occasion, found portals before their eventual close, and they’d fearlessly—or perhaps foolishly—entered them in an attempt to free their mother from the alternate universe and from Lucifer’s clutches. Dean knew that they both, deep down, were starting to believe that Mary was long gone—that Lucifer would have ripped her apart upon the portal closing.
Like Dean had said:
Dean grinned at his naivety. “Come on, surely you’ve heard that one by now,” he said and sidled in a little closer. He continued to look Cas up and down but was now taking his time, his focus shifting slowly. Cas swallowed hard, suddenly self-conscious with Dean staring at his crotch.
“Yeah?”
At night, his thoughts would run rampant, somehow shaking him out of his exhaustion so he had no choice but to worry over them. Eventually the very early hours of the morning would guide him into slumber, but his dreams were often corrupted with nightmares that he no longer woke from. His body was too worn down to wake from them anymore, but then the whole process would begin again the next night which didn’t seem any better. He knew they were spurred on not by awful imaginings, but by his memories. His history would play out in his head like a horror movie set to repeat. All he wanted was just one night of uninterrupted rest, but he didn’t hold much hope of ever getting it.
They fucked hard and deep, rocking the desk back with every thrust. Dean savored the dull ache and stretch of being full. Cas held his hips tightly and bit at his neck, but it felt good. It felt like they were claiming each other back. He listened to the silence, the slap of their skin together, Cas’ soft sighs. He could just make out the shadow of wings flickering in time with Cas’ eyelids fluttering shut. It occurred to him then, albeit in a garbled and sex-hazed way, that part of what he loved about Cas is this very angelic power, how strange and beautiful and -
An electric shock went through his whole body, starting at his fingers. Followed by a single squeeze of his hand.
They didn’t stay like that, though. Eventually Cas let his gaze fall, and he put on the old shirt, and fumbled with the buttons. Human clothing still seemed a little confounding to him. When he’d buttoned it most of the way up, Dean took one step forward, and straightened his collar. And that was all.
I let my eyelids flutter shut, drinking in the feeling of his hot breath on the bare skin of my neck. This would be the last time I would feel it, I thought sadly. I wouldn't kiss him, not if he didn't want me to. "It's all right, Dean," I said. "But I'd like it if you just explained-" The feeling of Dean's soft, warm lips on my skin silenced me. I let out a quiet moan, y
He made a funny little noise, then. It was after about five minutes of silence that I realized it had been a stifled sob.
“No. Naomi, she was controlling my mind, calling my consciousness back to heaven under her command while sometimes leaving my body.”
He bit his lip, before finally turning to Cas. “Say something, damnit! Don’t just sit there.” Cas’ eyes widened at his harsh tone, and he drew back an inch or two. Dean turned his back to Cas, angry at the sudden silence. His hands shook. Stupid, stupid. Of course this wasn’t going to be all perfect, with Dean telling Cas he only wanted Cas for the rest of his idjit life, and Cas confessing his love all over again in turn. Maybe Cas didn’t even want that. “Fuck, of course you don’t feel that. You can’t even feel that,” he added bitterly.
“You told me you had utter control of your vessel once,” he whispers, low and harsh in Cas’ ears. He wrapped his hand around Cas’ softening cock, circling his thumb around the head. “Can you come again for me?”
Cas cocked his head to one side. “I watched you.” With that, he was gone.
When Cas finally speaks again, he asks, “Is that...okay?” Cas looked at his hands.
A thought sparked in the back of his mind. Cas was singing I Can’t Help Falling In Love With You. Because he liked the song, or because during their shared dream last night, he had somehow come across that certain recurring dream? Did Cas know Dean had (frankly, ridiculous) dreams about getting them hitched in Vegas? If he did, why hadn’t he said anything?
Maybe if Cas had had a little more beginner’s luck playing guitar, and Dean hadn’t zoned out into his own thoughts of Cas, the hunter might have made out the garbled strains of Buffalo Springfield’s Sit Down, I Think I Love You. Cas didn’t, though, and Dean had. He was thinking about Free Bird. He’d listened to it so many mornings, pulling away from a sleazy motel, cold air caressing the hot red hickeys on his neck. Another girl who’s name he’d never known in the first place left behind. The song should make him sad, by all rights, if it made him feel anything. Riding in the Impala with Cas, knowing that Sammy was safe and they could go anywhere they wanted; it made him feel the song harder than he had before. Dean Winchester couldn’t change. He’d always be stuck in the hunting life, slightly bruised, protecting his brother and with his angel by his side. If Dean had been fully awake, he would have been kicking himself for all the cheesy chickflick crap his brain was throwing out. As it was, he was mostly good with this life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahixQ4upE5s
Dean couldn’t help it. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to Cas being here and them being all right and together. It was a fucking miracle. Consequently, he marveled at Cas and couldn’t resist touching him, drawing him close just to gaze wide-eyed, realizing that Cas was still here. Cas understood. For a chronic womanizer, Dean had meant it when he said he wanted Cas for the rest of his life. They were a miracle that would never wear out, just like the electricity that tingled his fingertips as he ran them along Cas’ skin would never stop.
Cas laughed, like he knew exactly where Dean’s thoughts were going. “I think that says Dean Winchester and Castiel were here quite clearly, don’t you?” When Dean rocked against his back in response, Cas’ voice dropped and he said, “One last stop.” The world disappeared in a rush.
Dean feels a hand on his shoulder.
Dean thought about it for a moment. “You know where she is?”
Cas took a moment to steady himself, and then he leaned ever closer to Dean. When they were mere centimeters apart, Dean parted his lips, thinking Cas was about to kiss him. The side of Cas’ mouth quirked up into a smile, but before he could ask why, Cas pressed their lips gently together. They were barely touching, just the slightest graze of flesh on flesh, and then Dean saw something glowing bright white. Cas’ breath was warm, but something cold and shining was whispering its way between his open lips, making them tingle with electricity.
“Are you sure?” Dean asked then. He licked his lips. They were cold and tingling at the same time. “That you love me, I mean.”
And then I did kiss him, and the swell of his lips, the taste of his tongue, it was glory.
Castiel leaned against the wall, sunlight falling across his face and chest. Dean pressed play and waited as the sound of strings being softly strummed filled the room.
I'd love it if y'all let me know what you think, this fic is my new baby :)
“It’s barely 10, Dean,” Sam said in unison with Cas’ response of, “If you don’t mind.”
Dean frowned and pushed the eject button, muttering “
Dean swallowed. The buzzing wasn’t exactly pleasant, like excitement or lovey-dovey crap. It felt like that ache to be on the road, or that question that just keeps popping up even when you try to shove it down. And so he asked what he’d been wanting to ask for days, heart thumping in his chest. The question sounded loud in the darkness, and harsh in comparison with the gentle touch of Cas’ skin. “What did you mean when you said I’d remember some day?”
“So?” Dean asked as he switched off the cassette player. “Don’t compare it to religion somehow, you already ruined Wile E. Coyote.”
“You don’t remember. You’re not meant to,” Cas told him gently.
And –
He could get into the Impala right now and put his foot on the gas until he got to the nearest 24 hour department store and buy all the regular shit. Show Cas Valentine's Day, the 'traditional' way. Pretend he hadn't forgotten.
than breakable or beautiful. And loved it, for that and everything else. Loved it despite all logic. Imagine that, and you will have imagined how I love you.”
He pulled his fingers out, and he heard Cas trying to quiet his whimper of loss. The angel knew what Dean was about to do to him. Dean gripped his cock at the base and lined himself up, hunkering over so the branches of the tree didn't hit him in the face. He slid in too fast, and Cas groaned in a mixture of pain and pleasure, but Dean couldn't stop. Cas felt too good. They were crammed together with forced intimacy, kneeling on Cas' trench coat and low to the ground. Branches and needles pressed against Dean's back as he thrust in and out, loving Cas' cries of pleasure. He took the time to make sure he was hitting Cas' sweet spot with every thrust; neither of them were going to last long.
“Okay. But you have to take your shirt off.” Dean winced at the way the words had come across. “Trust me.” He hoped that conveyed what he wanted to say.
Dean spun Cas around, startling a laugh from him. He landed squarely in Dean’s arms, like an old time movie. An idea blossomed in his mind. “Cas,” he said breathlessly between kisses.
"No, Dean. I like it." Cas said firmly. "Maybe it's odd. It's scraped together, out of anything that would work, but that doesn't make it inferior. I think it makes it better."
Dean found himself rolling in a wave of thought which was rather inescapable. It started with Castiel rescuing him from hell, had Cas rebelling
Dean's lips hung gently parted as he stared down at his angel. Cas got to his feet, legs shaking, before he collapsed onto Dean's lap once more. They stay like that for quite some time, in silence, their foreheads pressed together and sweat cooling on their necks. "Happy Valentine's Day," is all Dean could think to say. Cas half-frowned and half-smiled, that expression which said,
Dean knelt with his back to Cas, letting Cas suck a trail of red marks down his back. Cas sure was fond of hickeys, and fuck if it didn’t feel good. “You gotta open me up,” he said, remembering Cas didn’t know how to do this. “There’s, ah, lube in the drawer,” he gestured, distracted by Cas cupping a hand under his balls. He waited, wishing he could see what the angel was doing, while he heard the pop of the bottle cap. A second later, he felt the cool, slick press of Cas’ finger as his entrance. He moaned, surprised at how good it felt. Cas went slow, and Dean knew he must be wearing that pondering expression. The thought twisted his lips into a smile.
He gasps once more and they’re back in Dean’s bedroom. Dean jerks upright to where Cas stood over him, tangling his arms immediately around the angel. Cas falls to the bed with him and lets Dean fist his hands in his shirt collar, in the lapels of the trench coat, in the knots at the back of his shoulders.
“After I rescued you, your soul, it was – well. Tormented. Taken to the edge of shattering. Partially dissolving into black smoke. I reconstructed you. I couldn’t take away the memories, or the pain, but I took away what it did to you. Some of it, anyway. I never really thought there was a chance you remembered, but I always wondered.” Cas said, his voice softer now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. Some of them make us happy,” Dean admitted. “I don’t know why. It just depends, I guess. Maybe on how you feel when you hear the song the first time, maybe what it makes you remember, maybe it just sounds happy. I dunno, man.”
At least so he thought, because when he squeezed some onto his fingers, it became evident the entire world was conspiring against him. Rose-scented.
Cas fell silent. His eyes were starting to shine.
We kissed for what felt like hours, the glide of my tongue between his lips mesmerizing me. I mapped out every inch of his mouth. I wanted to remember the simple
Before the light or the word, there was a void. A shadow.
“But you don’t need to do that with me.”
“It’s by Lynyrd Skynyrd,” Dean shrugged. “Most of their original members died in a plane crash. They’re from Alabama. This song,” he laughed slightly, “Is basically what I’ve had to tell every girl I’ve ever slept with.” He winced then, realizing that you probably shouldn’t mention that sort of thing to the guy you’d fallen in love with. But it wasn’t just some guy. It was Cas.
Dean trailed off, thinking maybe he'd said too much.
Cas tilted his head to one side. “I’m curious.”
Dean started, because, well, that seemed logical. He’d jogged up and down the hallway to his room, fumbling for the present he hadn’t thought he’d give Sam for ages to come, and the one he’d secreted away for Cas. Now he tossed Sam the mediocrely wrapped package, and watched impatiently as Sam opened it much too neatly, tearing in straight lines and peeling the tape away. A box fell out of the wrapping paper, and Sam’s face colored. “You’re kidding me, right Dean?”
I remember when it all started. When we came here, I was still an angel. I didn't need to sleep. I spent the days on patrols, healing the sick, and walking in the forests. The nights, I spent watching over him. Memorizing the curve of his back, so much more peaceful in sleep than in waking. Sometimes he would cry out, nightmares of fire raking through his mind, and I would go to him. Clasp his hand firmly and whisper words in Enochian until he calmed. Other times, he would wake, look at me, and blink. Once he muttered something hoarsely about taking my damn coat off and sitting down. I'd never thought of that before.
Every time, he woke to the tune of the damn Grand Funk Railroad song. It circled round his head, and around, and around.
“Interesting,” he remarked.
He's staring at Cas' lips again, he knows. He does it too often. They're standing in a skeevy motel room, Sam gone on some nerd camping trip in the mountains. The aching in Dean's shoulder, that hollow feeling where Cas' fingers should curl over his skin, it was worse than it'd ever been. He'd even wondered, Fuck, is this loneliness? Then he'd shrugged and grabbed another beer. Cas had appeared out of nowhere, and was standing too close. Like he always does.
I will try and work in some of your lovely song suggestions from the last chapter at some point :)
“Oh.” Color spread along Cas’ cheekbones.
Dean circled his tongue all around the pink flesh, making it glisten with moisture, before he thrust it inside Cas. Cas moaned loudly, the sound velvety and filled with desire. “Dean…” he said, as if only just remembering he was meant to be talking. “You know you break me apart when you do this.” Dean’s eyes came wide open. “Make me come undone, and Dean – oh, Dean,” Cas breathed as Dean circled his tongue inside him. “I love it,” he gasped quietly. “Love you. Fuck.” He should’ve known Cas talking dirty would be something unexpected, but this – well, fuck.
“To me, physical forms aren’t necessarily impediments to intimacy. It’s only a different way of experiencing the same thing.” He admitted in a low rumble, “It’s a way I’ve grown rather enchanted by.”
Cas regarded him steadily. “I suppose they thought that was… ironic.” Dean almost laughed. “And yes. Dean, I don’t regret anything I did today. I was judged by my brothers and sisters and some spoke in my defense. I was granted a far better punishment than I could have hoped for, and at the end of everything, I will find you waiting. Not even dying an aeon of deaths could turn me away from that.” Cas didn’t meet Dean’s eye when he said that last part.
“That doesn’t surprise me.” Sam’s eyebrows had made his forehead wrinkle like a Hopi maze.
“Dean,” Cas growled in answer. He could see the shadows of Cas’ wings again, folding out in the air underneath him.
“All right then.” Dean stood, offering Cas a hand up. Once he’d pulled Cas to his feet, he coughed. Cas was staring at him with his head cocked to one side, hand still clasped in Dean’s. Dean laughed lightly before extracting his hand from the angel’s grip. Cas probably wasn’t familiar with being helped up or something. “What say we get you inside, huh?” Dean asked, absent mindedly picking leaves out of Cas’ hair. He ran a thumb along Cas’ cheekbone, erasing the tear that had sat there a moment before. “Come on,” he said suddenly. Cas followed him down the hill slowly.
"I'll show you," Dean breathed out.
“That’s loneliness, Cas.” Dean wasn’t sure he ever wanted to stop touching Cas, even if it was innocent, comforting touches like this one.
Cas looked over at him, eyes flashing, and said unequivocally, “
“Yeah?” Dean blinked, jerked out of his thoughts.
“You gonna fish, Cas?” Sam asked, reclining in the largest of the chairs.
“You want me to
I realized belatedly his hand was still in mine, and I stroked it. "Do you like how the flowers smell, Dean?"
and finally fell silent. He hadn't thought about how
“And probably sleep,” Sam says.
He sank down on Cas, flattening out his tongue and tilting his head back. He felt Cas’ dick slide into the back of his throat and he worked at it until his nose was brushing against Cas’ pubes. He let out a hum of satisfaction. Cas’ eyes were wide, his lips frozen in a silent cry. He swallowed once, letting the sides of his throat massage Cas’ cock. “Oh, Dean,” Cas murmured reverently. Dean bobbed up and down, sometimes taking Cas all the way into his throat, sometimes hollowing out his cheeks and swirling his tongue. Jesus. He never thought he’d need to be this good at giving head, but he wasn’t complaining. And neither was Cas. The angel’s hands were clenching tightly at the blankets, nearly ripping them apart. Cas bit his lip, and Dean could tell he was already working to stop himself from coming. Dean’s own dick was begging for friction, and he did all he could to stop from thrusting against his own thigh.
Cas silenced him with a stony glare. “Dean. You may not understand now, but what I did – it was the right thing. I have finally paid for the death and destruction I caused. I have been judged by my brethren and I – I have not been found wanting. The punishment was not an injust one.”
“Tell me what to do.” The words were an invitation, hanging in the inch between their lips, that Dean accepted. Dean wondered if he should tell the angel he was just as new to all this as Cas was. Last night had been improv and logic and listening to Cas’ moans for direction. He’d never slept with guys before, and he supposed strictly speaking, Cas wasn’t a guy.
. He walked through the water until he was nearly side by side with Cas, and then brought his hand up sharply, sending a wave of water crashing into Cas’ face and chest.
and Cas took his breath away.
Cas must have carried him inside, because he woke in his bed, the smell of ozone and chamomile lingering round the sleeves of his shirt.
"I'll still come and go, and you'll still hunt with Sam, and the world will still attempt to end catastrophically, so why does something so unimportant feel so-"
will be decided by a further Tribunal – heaven, hell, perhaps even Purgatory. They thought that was a punishment,” Cas laughed, tilting his head up  to gaze at the ceiling. “They thought that having my grace spread through the earth, the trees, the flowers, that that would be a waste of a seraph. And to reduce my essence to a human soul, instead of the vast, expansive, celestial scope – they thought they were shedding dishonor on me.” Dean blinked. “I suppose, from their point of view, they are.”
Oh, oh, have a!
all of Cas, just what slivers of skin the dim light revealed. And he was already hard in his jeans. Fuck. He opened the duffel bag carefully, too carefully, and starts pulling items out. He could feel Cas’ eyes on his back, but he didn’t stop. Not until he’d pulled his lighter out of his pocket, fumbled, even struck out trying to light it the first time, and then lit the first candle. He heard Cas exhale sharply as the tiny light danced, casting shadows all across the walls. Dean smiled. Romance – that stuff was hard, though he tried. But romantic sex? That, he could do.
“I fucking love you,” Dean cut him short and once again closed the distance between them, seeking the cool, full press of Cas’ lips. Cas gave in easily and sighed, winding his fingers through Dean’s hair.
"You were unconscious. You didn't see it." Dean answered, taken aback.
I had to. I just had to.
“Oh.” Dean swallowed. Poetry was not, perhaps, his strong suit. “Do you… like it?”
Together we shall go until we die, oh my my
Cas’ eyes flickered over Dean’s bare chest, and when they met his own, the angel’s expression was mild. “I don’t see why not.”
So, he makes the gardens grow. He adds the bees. The birds, too. He lets the souls of long-lost friends reunite in brand-new forests they remember from Earth. He and Jack work side by side. Sometimes, he visits Earth. He doesn’t go to Dean. He goes to new places, and watches like he did when he was stationed there. He watches the people and feels the wind on his skin. He comes to love the ocean.
“Yes,” Cas grunted, and Dean wasn’t sure whether it was an answer to what he’d said or an exclamation. They made love deep and slow, sweat running down Dean’s neck as he trembled, trembled at the waves of sensation the heady slide of Cas’ cock into him cause, and Cas held him tight. They came at the same time, Cas’ erection pulsing inside of Dean, filling him with hot cum, and Dean groaned, bucking his hips wildly, pleasure flying through him.
“Yes, fuck, yes,” he stuttered out.
"I don't love you just because you know how to be human, or feel like one," Dean managed, grinding up against Cas' pelvis. "I love you for everything you are." It's funny, how much easier it's gotten to say that. He slipped his hand under the waistband of Cas' sweatpants and wrapped his fingers around Cas' cock, before starting to stroke him.
“It is not of import.” Cas paused. “You think of flowers as being weak. Fragile. Effeminate. That’s a human construct, a way of perceiving reality which is different to mine. I could snap your spine as easily as picking a flower, watch you die as quickly as a rose out of water wilts.” Dean stared up into Cas’ blue eyes, and he was spinning, spinning into them. Cas was right. Cas was eternal, unyielding, and yet, so – he squeezed Cas’ hand, to make sure that blood still pumped there, that the skin was still soft. That Cas was not entirely a warrior, removed from Dean’s mortal existence. “So?” Cas asked wonderingly, eyes flitting away from Dean’s to scan the sky as if for an answer. “If I was the storm, you sprung up in my path, brave and defiant, brilliant and blazing. I could have plucked you up and tossed you aside. As could any of my brethren. You are something more than impermanence, fleeting beauty and frailty, though.” Cas mused.
“Gender is irrelevant,” Cas said, flipping his hands wide open. “Humans are fascinating. Why would I only want to explore one kind of them?”
“Good book?” He fished into his jean pockets, drawing out a scuffed cassette he’d picked up from a box on the side of the road on the way home. Just ‘cause Cas would like it. No other reason.
He bent down to lick Cas’ shaft, but Cas pulled him up.
Cas gave a single nod, and Dean took the volume from him with a little more care than he would have ordinarily. He held it between his hands for a moment, looking at the slightly scuffed cover, and wondering what it was that had so enraptured Cas. “All right,” he said, and sauntered off to the cashier.
I wanted to say. My lips did not cooperate. "Broke you," he slurred. "Fuck, Cas. I'm so sorry." He fell off the chair where he was sitting, to his knees. He took both of my hands in his and looking at him then, I was more reminded of what his soul had looked like when I dragged it out of Hell than I was of the man I had grown to love. "You shouldn't even be here. With me. Did I - did I break your wings?" he asked quietly. "Human," he laughed. I was steadily starting to hate those shuddering laughs, and so I laid a finger to his lips to stop him from speaking.
Cas laid a finger to his lips. “Dean,” he growled. He paused, possibly regretting the use of so many metaphors. “You realize that everything you just asks also applies to how you could possibly love me. Something you didn’t even believe in until a few years ago. Something completely outside of your conception and so very alien and strange. If you can’t see that loving me is the same as-” he gestured into the air wildly. “Loving an avalanche whose path you are in, then see this. I will never lie to you. And when I told you I loved you, I was not lying.” Cas’ eyes blazed. “Dean, we are bonded in every possible way, and I…” Cas trailed off, the fire in his eyes fading slightly.

It’d snowed for days straight, and finally the rain had come. Cas stood, nose pressed to the window, watching the rain pour down. Black clouds were on the horizon, and Dean could see distant flashes of lightning. The storm would be here tomorrow. Dean strode up to his lover and circled his arms around his middle, kissed his shoulder and then let his head rest there. He missed Sam, and worried about him too. But a small part of him sure was happy they were alone. Cas melted into Dean’s touch, and they stayed that way for a time in silence.
Dean smiled, but it felt like his face was cracking in two. He wasn’t sure what the emotions roiling in the pit of his stomach were, but they felt an awful lot like guilt and happiness and sadness and the strangest disappointment all in one.
“You’re gonna need it where we’re going. Come here.” He cleared his throat, and Cas walked around the corner, eyebrows raising when he saw it. It was a glossy black motorcycle, ready to rev to life. Dean had spent all of yesterday fixing her up, and was pretty sure she had protection symbols etched into her. “Hop on,” he said handing Cas a helmet.
“Of course I do, now get outta there.” Dean rolled his eyes, extending a hand.
"Do you want to be alone?" Dean asked in a low voice.
Dean didn’t think Cas was going to speak, he was so engrossed in watching the landscape slide by. Small towns, mostly, with some flat countryside inbetween. Nothing special. There was something special, though, about watching Cas looking out the window, one hand resting on faded blue jeans that used to be Dean’s, white collar messy. Dean swallowed.
Dean shuts up, sensing an argument he can’t win.
“I don’t need to sleep. I could have… gone somewhere else. Wouldn’t that have been better?”
They dreamt of flying.
Second circle outside the bullseye. Now they were getting somewhere.
“I enjoy sharing experiences with you,” Cas answered, much too quickly. Sam’s coffee dribbled down his lip before he swiftly wiped it off, staring at the two of them.
Cas picked up a Christmas bauble and lifted it over his head, peering through it curiously. Dean crossed his arms, trying to stop his heart from exploding with how much he fucking loved that idiot. The whole room smelled like pine, because they’d stopped off at the Christmas Tree farm and bought the biggest tree there. Dean didn’t think they could get to the top of it. The guy working there had given them the most impressive eyebrow-raise Dean had ever seen, before breaking into a grin when Cas had muttered something about how the trees were ‘green like his eyes’ or some other awfully sappy sentiment.
It was almost as if he knew Cas was going to leave, and he was doing everything in his power to make him stay—even if it meant holding him there on the floor of Sam’s bedroom forever.
Dean placed his hand on Castiel’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze, gazing into his eyes, “Thank you. For everything.”
“There are too many risks, Dean.”
Maybe that worked for him. After all, Dean was still up and kicking despite all the odds. But the same could not be said for Sam. Sam needed to believe there was some good still left in this world. And that they were fighting for more than just the sake of it.
love kind. And it had gotten him here to this state of indescribable pain. It had given him nothing more than an endless agony.
Dean waited, anticipating some kind of snarky, and probably rational, response, but it never came. He expected Sam to straighten up and broaden his shoulders, to stand tall over Dean and tell him plainly what was what and to end the discussion as he so saw fit. After all, Sam had taken the reins since that dreadful day—he had to. Dean wasn’t in the right mind to take charge, and they both knew it, though Dean stubbornly pretended otherwise whenever he was feeling particularly enraged or beat down. His younger brother had taken all the same steps forward that Dean had taken backward.
Maybe it was exactly what he wanted too.
“I don’t remember,” Dean said finally. Sternly.
Sam was speechless. He stood at the top of the stairs and stared down in horror at what he had just witnessed. When Dean finally met his eyes, something in Sam’s expression turned pitiful, like he had always known that Dean was this weak and broken thing. Dean couldn’t stand to have his brother look at him that way. His jaw tensed and he brusquely grabbed another beer and opened it, drinking quickly and consuming a quarter of the bottle in one go.
“Yeah,” Sam got up again and came back a minute later with a bottle of aspirin and a glass of water. “Drink that instead. You’re dehydrated.”
Heaven; that the Scribe was actually
Castiel’s soul was tainted by shame. Dean was trying to explain so coolly and keep his tone so steady, but Cas could see the legitimate agony the recollection caused him. The search had made him restless and even now Dean felt like he was still looking—Cas was here but he wasn’t whole; a part of him remained in the cracks of those broken cobblestones and caught in those suffocating cuffs.
There Dean cradled Cas with his chest pressed to the former angel’s back. Dean encompassed Castiel so entirely and whispered empty words to him, trying to lull him to sleep. Cas listened to him, focusing ever so carefully on each and every word. And he tried to dispel the loneliness. He told himself that the arms around him were too solid and warm not to be real. And he told himself that those arms would not be around him if they didn’t mean it.
He’d known the concept of masturbation for a long time but hadn’t ever practiced it before since as an angel his sex drive had been limited and fairly repressed. But when he started, he realised it was actually rather simple, and it felt better than he had expected it to.
“Dean? Are you okay?” He asked, his hand itching to reach over and shake Dean’s shoulder or to settle on his knee or thigh. He just needed to touch Dean and feel the lingering warmth of his skin or even just the shallow movements of his body as his chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. He needed any reassurance he could get that Dean was safe.
As he trudged through the rain between the cover over his car and the safety of the gas station, every part of him cried to turn back. He could feel it in the weakness of his legs and the hollowness of his stomach and the weight in his chest and the burning behind his eyes. But he kept going. He kept going all the way up to the cashier and fumbled with his money to pay.
“Castiel,” the angel corrected gently.
Cas had never seen someone quite so beautiful before Dean.
“I can’t get through to him,” Sam sighed dejectedly.
They left the mess untouched in the kitchen; their clothes scattered amongst the pots and pans.
Castiel hummed softly and could hear Dean climbing into the backseat before actually seeing him or feeling him. The hunter struggled to get his legs over the seat and Castiel helped pull him in until Dean settled down beside the ex-angel. Dean leaned into Cas’ side, near nuzzling into the crook of his arm and they both sought out each other’s warmth.
Thanks so much for reading, guys! I really hope you enjoyed this chapter! Please let me know what you thought in the comments. I always love reading your feedback :)
He kept trying, minutes trickling by without any hope or success. Eventually, time lost all meaning. He suspected he may have been crouched there for an hour. At least that’s what the cramping in his legs suggested. But he refused to adjust. He blamed himself, sure now that this failure was entirely his doing. He gave up for air too quickly, he unclenched his jaw too frequently; he eased his pain when he ought to suffer.
“Is there?” Cas sounded empty, even to his own ears.
Cas finished the song, his darkly deep voice twisting on the final note. He stared at Dean for a moment and then pressed his palm to the ringing guitar strings, silencing them. Sam let out a whistle of appreciation, but all Dean could do was dumbly stare. In that moment, Elvis Presley seemed like he had read into Dean’s soul.
“I’m not going to let you come until you’ve hit the target dead-center while your cock’s down my throat,” Dean said in a matter-of-fact voice. He was rather surprised by how easily the words came, given that he’d had no conscious plan of the sort before this moment and that he’d never really done dirty talk with Cas.
“I love them,” Dean said, reaching out to touch one of them and then pausing, hand hanging in midair. “They’ve got Winchester charm,” he said jokingly, and then looked up at Cas. “You know, you don’t have a last name.”
They pull up outside a ramshackle bookstore in Lebanon, half second hand and half new books. Some of the shelves are neatly stacked with alphabetized volumes, but in the rest of the store books towered up in high piles that Dean was amazed didn’t fall over. Dean held the door open for him with a shy smile, and watched Cas’ face light up.
fighting for. And we fought again, and again. The world's... relatively safe, not that I can really claim credit for that. I've been human. I ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I had sex, I got stabbed. Maybe that's when I realized I had no clue what it's really about. Humanity. I've been observing for millenia, fighting with you and your brother for the last few years, and I'm not any closer to understanding what we fight for. I'm not a human, Dean. I don't feel things like a human does." Cas' intense stare made Dean swallow his objections.
Not in the things you said, but in the ones you left unspoken.
“OK.” The two syllables were an invitation, and they both knew that.
Cas glanced back at him, a flash of steely blue, and Dean felt his pulse ricochet through the roof.
Sam smiled. “You really gotta thank Cas for that one.” Cas materialized on the arm of the sofa, nearly making Sam jump out of his skin. Dean smirked. “Anyway,” Sam coughed, “He just showed up on the ship and said you’d mope all day if I didn’t come home.”
The Doors - Light My Fire
Cas didn’t reply, just stared up at him with those open blue eyes. Dean’s breath came shakily, wondering what the feeling whirling in Cas’ eyes was. Slowly, ever so slowly, Cas lifted his head up until his eyes were just below Dean’s. His pink lips were softly parted, and he wore that thoughtful expression Dean had grown too fond of. Every muscle in the hunter’s body was tense, his brain screaming that he ought to move away, before he did something stupid, but he didn’t want to -
Dean stood alone while the wistfully groaning guitar solo started up. Man, this song must have repeated like fifteen times by now. Slaying werewolves to Bob Seger. He could get used to that. Cas was gone longer than he expected. He drained another bottle of beer and watched the sky. Life was mostly good.
Oh, they were good dreams. But they always left him gasping for air, sweaty and desperate and thinking of Cas. He knew it should feel wrong – waking up in the middle of the night, sheets bunched around his waist, with his best friend’s name on his lips. The dreams, though, they were always so… beautiful. He could see Cas’ wings in them, black and majestic. The dreams were never the same, either. Sometimes he and Cas were strangers, meeting on a dusty road. Sometimes they were in Purgatory. Tonight, he’d been hunting, and Cas had been the man he’d saved. Cas had worn a black suit and tie – that is, until he’d pulled it off hurriedly, pushing Dean back against the wall. Dean had moaned in his sleep at the feel of his lips, his tongue, even if it wasn’t real. The dream had been going perfectly, Cas stripping off his clothes and sinking down to his knees, dragging Dean’s pants down and licking a lazy circle around the head of his cock – when he startled awake. “Fuck,” he muttered, mind still hazy and swimming with pictures of Cas. He couldn’t say for sure what had woken him.
