"Ellie and Samuel wouldn't even look at me."
Castiel opened his door, and they went in. “Pretty sure your limited wardrobe is half the appeal at least.”
Cas just stood there and stared at him for a moment. This time when Cas reached out to him, he didn’t pull away. His hand cupped Dean’s cheek, and his thumb ran a lazy arch. He pulled Dean’s head to his, and held him like that, foreheads pressed together. “I’ll be home to you soon.” He pressed a kiss to Dean’s cheek and let him go. He made his way to his side of the truck. Dean watched him drive away.
None of what he thought conveyed enough, so he let the sentence just end as it did.
Sam tossed himself into the plush couch, long legs hanging over the arm of one end while his head was perched on the other. Ruby shoved his legs aside and sat too. “Easy when the security guard is a fan. Plus, he saw you come up with Cas last night.”
Dean said, “I want this, you.” Then he kissed Castiel hard and desperate.
“Looks like it’s glowing,” Sam offered up. “Is that coming from the flowers?”
“Our breakfast is coming. Gonna hang up and let you deal with that.” They both laughed, said their goodbyes, and then Dean hung up the phone. The waitress slid their plates to them. “Cas?” Dean asked after getting a few bites in.
And because I was a little shit, who didn't know what’s good for him, I said, “If it’s not too cold, maybe that kilt.” I winked again. Still got it. And then I went out the door.
“Maybe.” Sam looked from Phobos to Deimos. He turned away from Rebekah, but she didn't leave. “You okay?” He set a hand on Deimos’ shoulder.
“How is this for Sam?”
Castiel breathed in deep lungfuls of air. He didn’t expect Dean to ask after him. He’d thrown his name on the list in some sort of moment born out of vain fantasy. He didn’t date closeted men. Frankly he didn’t date anyone. Who had time for that anyway. He felt reckless though. And he thought that Dean was something worthy of a little recklessness.
The doorbell rang.
Sam waved them to the table and they all sat down. Dean felt his muscles tighten and rebel a little against sitting again. The spirit had thrown him around a little, and the few extra hours in the car didn't exactly do wonders for his body. Cas reached out to the back of his seat and let his arm linger there a moment before he grazed his fingers over the back of Dean’s neck. A gentle wave of grace rolled down his neck and eased his aches.
A larger collection of creatures came to her on the next night. These ones did not seem keen on talking. They spread out around her house as she was preparing for bed. She stepped out her front door, having already sensed them. There were two on the far side of the house, one in the barn, one in the woods, two in front of her. She was pleased to see that one of them was a female. She was beginning to think that all creatures viewed women as weaker vessels.
“The cowboy benedict.” He grinned across at Dean.
“I like it.” Dean smiled, and it was warm, genuine. “Maybe we should work on that one together, get some lyrics together.”
"Doing things like what?" Dean asked.
Castiel came back to him. He curled into his side and sounded like he’d fall asleep in an instant. “I really needed this, Cas.” Castiel just hummed something that sounded like
“Why are you here?”
Castiel licked his lips and thought about how a drink would really help him at the moment. He took the notebook from Bobby and looked at the address. It wasn't far from the studio. There was a word under the address.
“That article didn’t really cover the hallucinations, but my source did. The article contained some speculations. I had a second short article my source sent from the small newspaper he works for. It’s been mostly rather vague.” Sam came closer as he spoke as well. “I really think we’ll learn more there.”
“A cover song. Weezer just did that whole cover album thing. Figured maybe we could throw in a cover or two on our album.”
“Are you inviting me to your Christmas dinner, Dean?”
“I’ll move back to the table in just a second. The bed just seemed more comfortable after being in the car so much today.” Cas’ fingers weren't flying over the keys now. He seemed to just be reading.
Cas swiped the flashing button to answer then set it to speaker. “Hello, Sheriff Mills,” Cas said.
“Okay. My name’s Clark. Thought you might be looking for someone named Jack.” Clark’s eyes swooped over Cas’ body. “You and he have a similar style.”
. Cas had laid next to Dean for hours just staring at his peaceful, sleeping face before he chose to leave Gwen's body. He'd let her have the pleasure of watching Dean wake up.
Dean waved his hand in a circle saying, “And the babies came along…”
“Did he now. Seems I won’t have any secrets left.” Dean laughed. He leaned down to check on Samuel who was now falling asleep in his carseat. Dean was feeling pretty happy with Sam’s choice in carseats. Having the thing act as a makeshift bed right now was a good thing.
He glanced back at the tee and jeans combo.
“Well, I’m not so sure I’m the same size as I was last time I was in here. I haven’t exactly been eating right unless you count alcohol as a major food group.” Dean started to moved off with his first outfit, but Cas got up and strode back to him, blocking his path.
“You think they’d beat us?” Dean asked.
“I thought you co-wrote with him?”
It could have been a question for Dean or even just to himself.
Dean committed to the room and came down to a crouch near them. The babies were still flexing and flailing a little on the floor. “What’re you doing with them?” Dean reached out and gave Ellie’s back a gentle rub.
He could touch Dean’s body anywhere and send healing to the injured bone. Healing Dean was never something he did quickly though. He let the touches linger. Dean’s body stilled beneath him as he dragged his fingers toward Dean’s shoulder, then his chest. He stared steadily into Dean’s eyes, counted his breaths, his heartbeats, the blinking of his eyes. He could lean down to him, kiss him, taste him again. He wanted to. His fingers grazed over Dean’s ribs. He felt Dean’s skin shiver beneath him.
Gabriel had allowed the video to silently play out behind him as he explained. He jumped ahead a little to the event. Cas noticed that the probes were still extended and likely broadcasting the details of what was about to happen to the Calliope. Black swirls stretched out from the phenomenon and began wrapping around the Impala just as they had before with Sam’s pod. The light grew bright, and then the whole ship was gone. Cas focused on the light this time though. And through it he saw what Dean saw. There was a planet, maybe. It was too fast, too obscured by the light.
“Me too. I'm also glad that we became friends. I don't exactly socialize much outside of the band.” Cas took another chip and ate it.
"I always try to get you gifts you'll appreciate." Gabriel turned the slightest attention to the children and said, "Protect the humans." Then there was the chaos of battle.
“I’m not so sure. We haven’t really talked about things. I mean, he and I, it’s complicated.”
"Your friends settling up the tab. You got a way home?"
“It's a party. ‘Spose to be happy.”
“He had too many beers.”
“Welcome home, buddy.” Cas was sputtering just a little when Dean greeted him.
“I just asked you if you wanted to drive.”
“Every choice...every single choice was difficult. In the end, I thought it all for the best. We saved more than ourselves today. We saved heaven. We can recall the angels that we need from their sleep. We can make sure that heaven is a place of safety for the human souls within it. We have restored balance, or we will just as soon as I can get up there and start fixing things.” Gabriel looked from one to the next. He saw a lot of resistance on the faces around him.
“You were barely gone.” Cas smiled at him though. “What's in the bag?”
“I think so. Certainly not how I thought this all would go.”
Dean cast a worried glance around the area. No one was there. He could hear a distant bird call out, and a little breeze that picked up some leaves near his feet. There was nothing else though, at least not that he could tell. The baby whimpered again, it’s little face looking like it was gearing up for a good cry. Dean reached down and picked up the bassinet. “You’ll be okay. You got a mom somewhere out here, buddy?” His voice was low and comforting. He carried the baby into the bunker and set the whole bassinet, on the table. “Sammy!” He called out.
He found the video and hovered over it before clicking.
“Something new. I don’t have lyrics yet, not really anyway.” Castiel played to the end, and Dean listened.
Cas just came back though. It hadn’t even been twenty-four hours, but damn if Dean didn’t feel like a million bucks. His heart was hammering away, and he was smiling at the damn wall right now just thinking about this whole turn of events, the win that he had so desperately needed.
“I can imagine. Privacy is probably pretty hard to come by for all of you.” She was typing on the computer. “Maybe they added you to their list of acceptables.”
“I think he just might find me convenient. I mean, what other options does he really have out here?”
Dean stepped up to his side and set a hand on him. “Now?” He could feel his heart rate picking up. He wasn’t sure if Cas could feel his hand shaking, but it was, and he couldn’t stop it. “Why now?”
If Cas were here he'd fix this, things might make sense. "How am I supposed to do this?" He was tapping the wall with his forehead now. The motion repeating, faster and more frustrated. Dean realized he was praying to Cas, and that the prayer would never reach him. More tears came.
Dean did turn around then. “I'm outta here.” He stormed out, slamming the door in his wake.
“What did you need?” Dean sat up a little more and the vinyl headboard squeaked a bit with the move. He felt Cas’ hand at his back.
The apartment was clean and sparsely decorated. Cas didn’t touch him, didn’t make any further advances all the way to the place. He unlocked the door and put her key back into her purse. He could hear Dean on his heels. He set the purse down and turned to him, ready to say something, but he wasn’t sure what.
“You can submit a list of people that are allowed access to you via your room or a phone call. For instance, your manager is on your list, and so is someone named Ellen Harvelle.”
Cas looked at him for a second more and then slid over to the driver’s seat. Dean got in, and they were back on the road. Dean felt weird in the passenger’s seat. He moved his foot as if he were controlling the accelerator. “You’re nervous.”
Bobby came to sit beside her, and Cas passed him a bottle too. “So, you all have room for us tonight?” Bobby asked.
Dean took over. “You carved your name into my skin…” Dean held the note just like Castiel would have if he'd been on stage. It was a quieter rendition though.
Dean took it and said, “I will always accept beer. Thanks.” He drank down a bit, and felt a little refreshed. “Thanks again for the guitar. You really saved me today.”
“Yes.” Castiel nodded at the guitar. “Can I hear it again with the vocals?”
He prayed for sleep to claim him.
Dean swam over to join him. “You don’t need to worry about him. Not like he’s going to take advantage of me or something. We’re in the same band, and…” Dean paused for effect before adding, “I’m not interested in him.”
Kaia stood in the middle of Claire’s room waiting and wasn’t the least bit startled when she felt arms wrapping around her waist. “I hoped you’d find me.”
“I’ve passed just fine. Ah, well. It is good that I have shown myself then. The rumors can die out, and I can stop seeming like a ghost to you lot.” She drank down another gulp of her beverage and stood. She fished out a coin to toss onto the bar.
Cas said, “Funny that she’d be so offended. I thought that teenagers were use to late nights.”
Dean fed the babies and the twins. He planned to head to Sam's room to get him to have breakfast. Rebekah darted into the room just ahead of him and bounced up into Sam's lap.
So when the opportunity to take a red-eye home came up, Cas took it. It got him home way earlier than he'd planned, but the thought of getting to see Dean before the long week sucked up their time held more appeal than sleep on Saturday night.
“Of course, Dean.”
Dean looked away and said, “When we get back,” he swallowed then continued, “I’d like you to stay.” He ate another bite, then another. “At least while the babies are there. I could really use the help.” He glanced back at Cas.
“You're very worried about her. When I came here, he told me that you were a very good man and that you'd take care of me. When I took your hand, I could tell that what he said was true.”
Dean looked at the speedometer and saw that it was just hovering over 40 mph. They were on a broad straightaway. He really could go way faster. He pressed his foot down heavily on the accelerator. The car sucked them back into the seat, and they sped onward toward Hastings.
Sam hugged her back and said, “I’m only helping your dad get back to his vessel. This will be a temporary situation.” Sam patted his chest. “I haven't lied to you yet, and I don't intend to start now.” Phobos shook Sam's sleeve. “Yeah.”
“Pretty sure we’re a team.”
He’d have pursued that line of thinking, but Sam interrupted his thoughts. “What?” It was a question delivered with a bit of dripping confusion.
In the morning, the babies and Cas were out of the room. Dean stretched out slowly, feeling his body crackle in a satisfying way. He got up and wandered toward the smell of coffee in the kitchen. Rebekah was eating a very full bowl of cereal. Jack had a baby strapped to his chest in a funny little backpack looking thing. Cas came in next with another baby and the same funny backpack.
“But you can tune into angel radio.” Dean nodded as if to encourage him.
“I sometimes wish I could have words with your father.” Dean glanced at Cas. “I suppose that he didn’t realize just how much you needed from him.”
"You'll have to accept that I'm not quite ready to forgive and forget your little groundhog day number," Dean said.
“Maybe that one with the dome.” Cas pointed to their left. “I read a bit about the campus last night while you slept.”
“I think you might be right there.” Dean got up and walked a few steps away from the rock. He looked out over the other side of the hill, to the long stretch of red land between them and town. He couldn’t even see a hint of the buildings from this far off, but it was enough to just know it was there. “I think I want to stay here.”
“Sit.” Castiel pointed at the chair across from him. He breathed in the steam of the coffee. It was full of cream. Someone with a heavy hand did this coffee up. He took a sip, and it was exactly the way he liked it. “Perfect.”
“Lucky for me Uriel went off wandering to get away from my brooding. And the rest as they say is history.”
Strangely enough, opening the portal and retrieving Gabriel's body was easy. Easy didn't equal pleasant though. The vessel had gone through months of decomposition. Rowena, along with her coven, worked a spell to encase the body and keep it from tainting the air in the bunker anymore than it had initially.
“I believe that it will not be sunny at all. They’ve been getting some rather intense snow storms in that region for weeks now.” Cas took him too seriously for the millionth time. Dean pushed down the little laugh that was just about to run free.
Dean was leaning against the building, waiting for him like he had all the time in the world. The sun would be coming up soon. Dean walked very close to him. Cas glanced at him every couple of steps to see if he was okay.
“Bobby Singer,” Cas said.
One baby is a handful. More than that and one might need a few reinforcements. The Winchesters would be needing reinforcements soon enough, for the blessing that was this one child, was just a sign of the bountiful blessings to come.
Cas was trying to figure out if this was one of those questions that had layers. Instead of coming to a conclusion, he just said, “Yes.”
Sam’s head tipped back against his seat in what was clearly frustration. They were all a hair’s breath away from an argument over nothing. Tensions were high. “Get a room somewhere, so I can get away from you both,” Sam said.
“What's this?”
Cas moved Dean’s hand again. Dean could feel the wiriness of hair. His fingers raked over the warm skin around Cas’ cock. He didn’t grab him though. Cas didn’t move him there. He let Dean’s hand go. He moved his hand to Dean’s hip and moved his own body a little closer. Dean didn’t close his hand around him even then. He waited.
"I really am an angel, and I have an odd request."
“You saw the articles. This is our sort of thing. Just because Silas didn’t think we should doesn’t mean a thing. We always do things that seem crazy to other people.”
“I came back to the kitchen after setting up the room with Bobby. You and your mom were talking about…” He turned away and finished with, “relationships.”
“Pretty sure Bobby would prefer that you not refer to him as a possession in this case.”
Dean interrupted, "So you didn't want those things?"
“Yeah, Crowley is a producer, not a band.”
Dean tossed him a smile and moved past him into the somewhat dark restaurant. He spotted Uriel and Anna right away in the middle of the place and made his way over to them. “Hey there,” Dean said, all casual and calm. Cas wasn’t with them.
“Do you believe there are angels among us?” Rowena began reading and only half listened for his answer.
“I’m looking for an angel that has been noted in these woods. He’s been hiding here.” The demon looked around like he thought the angel would just materialize at any moment.
Sam and Ruby got off the couch together. Ruby reached down and pulled something out of the cushion. She held them up, a little gleam in her eyes. “Don't forget your underwear Dean.” She flung them at him, and they hit him in the face.
Castiel became concerned. He didn't like Michael, but he couldn't put his finger on a good reason why.
“You said, ‘I love you.’” Dean held tightly to Cas’ arms which were around him.
“Sam had some theories he said he’d share when you got up. You got up so…”
Dean shook his head. This wasn't making sense. He did walk to his liquor cabinet though. “I would have gone for the whiskey or the bourbon. Either of those appeal to you?”
“You okay, Dean?” Old Mo’s wrinkled face was all concerned.
Dean let his eyes drift up to Cas’ own. There was so much sincerity there.
Their relationship was still just theirs, and sometimes Cas struggled with that. Telling Sam had been a step in the right direction, but it had been one of the only steps. Kevin knew, but that was only because he walked in on them kissing at the studio when they thought that he'd left for the day.
Sam came back to his side. “Maybe we should be careful. You shouldn’t have been able to hear a baby whimpering that far away and past all the walls.”
“I’ll help.” Bobby got up. “Hey, Cas, you want to take little Brie. We could get them both situated while we’re in there. It’s quite a bit past their bedtimes.”
Cas tapped the edges of the bowl with the knife and then set it back down. He reached out his hands on either side of the bowl, palms up. “Take my hands.” It was the second time Dean had held Cas’ hand that day. He’d gripped Cas’ hand before to help him up after a fall, or for some other justifiable reason. This moment was easily explained and justified, but there was something about the way Cas looked at him as he held Dean’s hands that made Dean feel like the world was dropping out from under him.
Cas looked off toward the far wall. "It isn't about me. It's going to be about your children. They feel betrayed, abandoned, and possibly a little afraid of what your return will mean for them."
"I wanted heaven to take me out of the rotation. After all, they had tried to do that before when Kaia was born. I didn't want to be part of the plan anymore. I thought that if I broke the rules, I'd catch a break. In the end I thought that maybe I could just dive deeper into my role, become Loki. If you gain worshipers, believers, it changes things. If I could become him, really him, then heaven wouldn't have a hold on me and I wouldn't have to experience the fate that I'd been shown."
Even the unspoken commands were being followed.
“Cas.” Dean let his thumb brush an arc over Castiel's cheek. Castiel mirrored the move on Dean. “What now?”
#2 Thanks A**hole by Winchester
“Well, this guy has exactly nothing. I thought maybe he was just transferring them and deleting the originals, but nope.”
He turned to leave and Old Mo’s caught him. “You want us to move your car for you?”
am meeting you where you are, because
“Five minutes, Mr. Winchester.” The voice came through the door.
Dean stepped back. He looked away from Cas. "Yeah. I need to work out more. I'm getting older. I don't look like I use to. Don't even feel as strong as I use to."
“It is.” Cas leaned into the touch. “I don’t think that it will be more than a week, but it could be.”
“This didn’t happen, Jack. I don’t remember this,” Dean said as the kiss progressed in front of them.
Sorry that this recent update took so long to post. I got way busy with real life. It might be a week or two for the next chapter too, just so you know. Hope all is well in your world.
“Change is inevitable, Dean. Don’t ask her not to change.”
“Look at them, Cassie,” his tone low and a little forceful.
Dean looked down at the hat with the Stampede Motel band and thought, well no. “Yeah.” He slid money across the counter though, since everyone was waiting. It was an ugly hat.
When he emerged from the bathroom, Cas was pulling on a shirt. “Throw something on in case the food gets here while I'm in the bathroom.” Cas moved past him into the bathroom and closed the door. Dean found his clothes scattered here and there but not his underwear. He carefully zipped up his jeans, not liking the commando business.
“I wouldn’t. Trust me on this. I know. I did the whole Casless existence thing. It pretty much sucked. Jack brought you back though, and we are all better off for it. So, yeah, I wouldn’t be fine. I’d be the opposite of fine, and I’d like it very much if you stopped disagreeing with me on that score.” Dean shifted a bit and threaded their fingers together. Apparently they were now the kind of buddies that held hands. He was fine with that. He was more than fine with that. He was actually comfortable with completely owning this and claiming this on a near regular basis.
The night sky was something to be appreciated. There were so many stars out. They walked up the driveway with no destination in mind. The babies started whimpering. “This isn’t helping.”
Dean didn’t let go. “You’re going because you’re mad at me.”
“About you and driving and choosing to hit a tree over letting me drive. You would choose this over a much more reasonable and safe option.”
Even Sam’s wife, Eileen, was in on the plan to continually humiliate me. She was signing things that I absolutely recognized, and Sam was cracking up. And, also, no Eileen, I didn’t need a good holiday stuffing. Geesh! There were impressionable minors present.
Dean almost fell off the floaty. “You're home!” Dean paddled over to the edge, just beneath Cas’ feet.
He barreled back into the courtyard, leaving Cas alone again in the dark.
“Pretty sure you’re full of shit.” Dean reached toward the trackpad and scrolled the article up.
She walked the path from her home, past the pasture full of wooly sheep, toward the trees. In them she’d find the tools of her trade, plants and tree bark, key items for spells. She waved her arms out at her sides, the sun high in the sky warming her bare arms. She stepped off the path into the woods. She stooped and plucked up a couple of mushrooms from the base of a tree that stood tall in a slight clearing. The mushrooms would go into tonight’s soup.
“It isn’t that, per se. It’s more that I know you have duties in heaven. I don’t want to stand in the way of that.”
Everyone took up residence around the table. Charlie asked, “So, did Rowena make it back yet? She said she’d call me when she got in, but I haven’t heard from her yet.”
A week passed before she encountered another supernatural creature. This time it was a werewolf. He too was looking for an angel. It was different this time. He didn’t threaten her or even seem interested in her until he sensed her power. “You’re a witch.” He said it in a matter of fact tone.
Uriel laughed. “Not in a million years.”
Even in Dean's thoughts his teeth were chattering.
“You’ve got two. You could spare one.” E’brem clearly didn’t know the danger that he was stepping into with that comment, but neither did Dean or Cas. Samuel started crying then too. E’brem was a mystery.
“I don’t know how to stay.” It was an admission that didn’t promise anything. Dean let him go a little. He moved so that they faced each other, with Dean’s arms still loosely around him.
This was how the band came to be. Castiel had a bit of a moment in their shared orchestra class. “We need a break. All work and no play is going to kill us.” Looking back it was funny that it was Cas that said any of that. They all started meeting at Uriel’s garage a couple of nights a week.
Cas took a deep breath and seemed to hold it. He started moving the folded clothes back into the bag. “You have enough help now.”
"Hello," he had to focus to remember her name, "Gwen."
He turned his attention back to Cas. Dean reached out to him and brushed his fingers over his temple and back into his hair. Cas tipped his head into the touch. Dean pulled him a little closer and pressed his forehead back to him. They stayed like that for a time, breathing the same air, and settling into a new type of peace.
Dean began singing. It was a song about salvation, about the moments when one finds themselves not so wholly alone. Every thought that Dean had while he was writing it was of Cas, how he saved him from a life that was really only half lived.
“Pretty sure Castiel views it that way.” Uriel looked at Anna then back at Dean; the squint deepened. “Sure hope you don’t end up being an asshole.”
“All of the ways that you left…” His voice rolled like a bit of thunder, gravely, just this shy of wrong. It did something to him. Castiel found himself leaning forward in his seat.
“Guess this means even your brother doesn't get to know you like the occasional dick?” There was something in Castiel's tone. Dean wasn't sure if it was disappointment or irritation.
In all that time though, they never established a clear cut end plan. It seemed to be assumed that they’d all leave for Earth together just as soon as Dean was deemed well enough. He and Cas were still working on the whole ‘what are we to each other’ thing. Of course they didn’t talk about it directly, which was working out not at all. In their defense they never really had much in the way of privacy. Dean was set up on a makeshift bed in the main room of the Impala. His usual room was up a small ladder past a hatch, but he wasn’t deemed well enough to go back to climbing ladders to his room all the time.
“Well, okay then,” Sam said, and they all got out.
“You mean because she’s here?”
“Fine.” Sam walked out the door and closed it behind him. He made his way to Jack’s door. There was a faint glow coming from the bottom. Jack didn’t sleep much. Sam pushed the door open with a little knock. Jack glanced up. “Not bugging you am I?”
"Of course," Dean said. He fell into step beside Cas and let his hand fall on his elbow. Cas hazarded a glance at him as they walked. It was getting harder, the shift from intimate to whatever was their new normal. It should have been okay. This was only the second time and just a relieving of tensions, a physical fix, but Cas loved him. He knew even from the start that it had always been more than that where he was concerned.
The night of the Grammys included far more than one would assume even from all of the glitz and glamour seen on the television screens. There were interviews in the morning, fittings in the early afternoon, dress rehearsals, performance rehearsals. And if that wasn't enough to wear one out there were a whole stream of after parties to plan for too.
Dean swung his legs out of the cot and got up. “Won’t turn that down.”
Ruby was in the mix too.
Kevin joined them in the hall. They were all bouncing with the energy of what was to come. Dean cracked his neck and shook out his limbs. The crowd was cheering with anticipation. The three of them took to the stage.
“I was jealous, and I’m pretty confused about what this all is.” Cas leaned in and kissed him just below his jaw. He gradually moved his lips down to his neck where he nuzzled in a bit.
“I’ve just grown use to having it without.” Dean picked his mug back up and started drinking it.
“Oh, Cassie, I'm just foolin’” Luc turned to Ruby and added, “I'm the band's resident joker. Don't take me too seriously.” He pointed at the studio windows above them and said, “We'll be in there. Best view in town.”
“I know, but you implied it.” Dean turned his head a little to face Cas. “There are other possibilities. She wasn’t monogamous. She even propositioned me once,” Cas said.
Dean would say western attire, just to sound respectful. Sam would say cowboy clothes in the way that showed how he thought of the whole thing, like it was maybe a little silly. He’d called it Dean’s fetish a few times, maybe fairly.
And they did try. Each man who came onto her land was turned away, and each relinquished all claims, saying, as they rushed back to their old lives, that the land belonged to Rowena alone. In time, no one questioned it anymore. She did a lot for her community, so it was in their best interests to accept her.
“Maybe. Anyway, when Sam gets out, he's gonna wanna join up with me again, get the band back up and running. Bobby made it clear that he can't be in the life, too many temptations. He needs to really break away.”
“Luc, know your audience,” Castiel said, a level of harshness rolled out in his tone that silenced them all.
“He looks like he’s gotten a little bigger,” Dean said.
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is that he’s watching, and now I’ll draw him out.” He rushed her, and she sidestepped. She dropped the basket and pulled her knife out in front of her. He came at her again, and she sidestepped again, cutting him as he passed. It was a slight wound, and all that she intended. She knew that the demons could heal themselves despite never having met one in person.
Crowley tried again. “You’ve heard him play. There isn’t an instrument he hasn’t mastered.”
“What sort of miracle are you after?” Michael asked.
Cas leaned his head up on the back of the seat between them to look down at the laptop that Sam had open. “Maybe you don’t actually have service.”
Dean let the advice sink in. “Thanks for talking me down.”
“No.”
Castiel laughed again. “This isn't even your good stuff. The good whiskey is tucked in the back of that second shelf.”
A moment passed, then another. Dean heard them making their way to the garage. He turned and dashed after them. He caught them at the truck that Cas was opening up. He tossed the duffle bag into the back, and Jack was getting in the passenger seat. “Cas!” Dean called from the doorway. Cas turned to him. Dean went to him. “I didn’t mean what I said to my mom. I should have said yes, when she asked.”
“I did try to get us a dog. You all gotta work on Dean a little more.” Sam smiled and Jack smiled back. “So what about this image was important to you?”
“So jealous, Dean,” Ruby purred. She pulled at Sam until he followed her into the room. “Have fun, Dean,” she called out as the door closed.
“Don't suppose you want to share your father's name while we're on the subject?” Dean asked.
“The one and only.” Dean took a giant bite of his steak. Table manners be damned. Sam was always ragging on him for the way he ate. Castiel seemed to be unfazed. “Bobby got into the whole agent thing by accident.”
“What are you talking about?” Crowley was all smiles.
“Rude.” Dean smiled and got in his car. “See ya.” He gave Michael a little wave.
“Oh, branching out into film? You should have told me. I've got all of the connections.” And she really did. She'd been in two films that premiered this year alone, and both were getting a lot of buzz.
He drifted back to the Impala, his body, and his reality. He still felt Dean's lips, his gentle hands. He longed to go back, extend the night into this new day. He didn't though. He could wait for Dean to come back to the car. He'd need his rest after all.
Dean just stared at the letter. It was harsh, and it didn't sound like Cas. Dean carefully folded it back up and slipped it into the envelope. He tucked it into his pants pocket. He considered texting. A brief thank you, an apology, something, but he couldn't think of where to begin. He was angry too. The end was rough. Not seeing Cas, not talking with him after spending so much time with him had been every kind of terrible.
Dean paused before signing. “What if we just don't click?”
“Sorry. I’m tired, but I don’t feel like I can sleep yet.”
“Then pick a person. We’ll start there.” Crowley got up, picked up the laptop, and opened it. He logged in and set it on Castiel’s lap. “The folder on the desktop has all the audition videos.”
And then another voice that said,
“Wait until you know what you’re consenting to first,” Cas admonished. “If we’re ever separated again, I want you to be able to hear me, to feel that I’m still yours.”
There were embers still in the middle of the ashes. They seemed to throb with an amber glow as the first light wash of air brushed over them, then another breeze would do the same a few moments later. One might look at them and see them as heartbeats in the space where everything was consumed. One might even find hope in there if one chose to look.
Cas got him settled back into the motel bed. Dean felt so tired he was barely functioning, yet at the same time, he was not so tired as to forego attempts at something with Cas. When Cas was about to steal away from him, Dean reached out and caught his hand. “I saved a spot for you.” He patted the bed on the other side. He glanced over at the other bed, at Sam so invested in his sleep that his mouth was wide open toward the ceiling.
"Well hello yourself," Dean said. He bought her and the other women drinks, but it was clear where his attention settled. He even tried to push Cas into conversations, called him his friend, his buddy, but Cas was uninterested in the progress that would come from that.
“You didn’t have to do that.” Dean still smiled and donned a look of gratitude.
Dean let his hand stay right where Cas had placed it. Cas’ own hand was warm on top of his. Dean flexed his fingers just a little, feeling Cas’ body a bit more beneath that shirt. Dean swallowed a little, and it sounded loud to him in the quiet room.
Jack’s brows came together. “I don’t know. I don’t think so. I should try again.”
“I understand.” She took up his other hand now. “You really like him though.”
“Funny thing, they seem to miss you. I tried to move them to my room to sleep, and they did not want that one bit. I brought them back to your room and they were fine. Don’t be surprised when you find Claire, Jack, and I all over your space when you get home.”
“And they would survive,” he paused and added, “Sam and Jack, I mean. They’d survive. The babies are not as delicate as they seem.” Cas smiled and reached down a finger that he let Samuel grip. Samuel squeezed and gurgled a little.
“I’m saying, that if I want to describe my experiences in getting back to you in,” Cas raised his hands at this point and made air quotes before continuing, “romantic language, than I think I’ve earned that right.”
“You can say that again.” Dean leaned into Cas then and added, “What if we go home now and unpackage all of this tomorrow though?”
Dean looked confused, eyebrow jutting up toward his hairline. “Thought we were getting a change of scenery.”
They were on the road, heading west. Castiel leaned his head against the window and watched the flat lands zip by. It all felt dull and lifeless.
“Thanks. Got to hear a little bit from you all too, before I was getting rushed out. Sounded great.”
"This brings us to where we are now." One of the generals, a tall, imposing man, stood and walked to Gabriel's side. "When Gabriel contacted me with information on what had happened, I knew that this needed to be investigated and not solely by the private sector." Over the past couple of decades space travel had largely become big business and not solely the product of government work.
“Sure. You comfortable?”
That old nickname. Castiel looked away. Dean's gaze was intense. “I didn't know you were there.”
Ruby came over and sat on Sam’s lap, kissing him luxuriously. “Get use to it Deany. We famous!” she said after she pulled off Sam’s mouth with a pop. “Let’s have all the sex tonight, babe.” She was staring down into Sam’s eyes. The boy was gone on her.
She laughed. “You’re funny.”
The words were back in his head. The familiar rough voice called out to him. “Do you remember an accident?” Dean asked.
Forgetting for a moment how he looked, Cas said, “No one here could pose any sort of danger for me. I would easily smite them.” Dean looked at him funny. “Well, incapacitate. Smiting might be a bit extreme.”
“Where’d you meet? Do I know her?” Dean was already a little worried. Sam's track record was not so great.
“Yeah, bought it at auction. Paid through the nose for it. Makes sense though. No regrets.”
“They don’t count. Besides, they’re not available anyway.” Crowley set a hand on Castiel's knee, until he glared fire at the spot. “Sorry, too soon.”
“Of course.” He kissed the same spot again, then added. “Wanted this since the first moment I saw you.” Cas had a moment where he wasn’t sure if Dean meant him or Gwen. He thought,
Rebekah spent time with him, quietly playing with some toys on the rug. Her gaze though, often lingered on Sam, and the playing seemed like it was just part of a facade designed to make her presence in the room feel normal.
So this one is rather long, but I couldn't see a good place to break it really, so that's what you get. There is the tiniest bit of angst, but this is still a lot of fluffy stuff. Hope you all are enjoying it.
"Yeah." Cas reached across and squeezed Jack's hand.
“I’ve seen you change before. It’s weird talking to you with a flimsy barrier between us.” He waved at the outfit. “You ready to parade around yet?”
Each song from the new album was met with screams and enthusiasm. Given the number of hits that album had generated in the past year, it was no wonder.
Dean felt the tell tale flutter in his stomach again. Cas just kept setting off one tempest after another within Dean. “I'm sure glad this worked out.”
“Okay.”
“They said you’d take care of me.”
“They punched the punching ball, and bounced around on the trampolines. Rebekah and Phobos are rather acrobatic. Deimos liked the jump rope.”
“I was kinda shocked by the pay for this to be quite honest.”
The words pounded at his temples. Then a face and more words.
“The beauty of it is seen in the little details,” Old Mo said.
“Then the crash.” Crowley finished for him. “That wasn’t your fault. And no one knew about the breakup. No one ever needs to know about the breakup.”
He sent his grace to him, mending the bone. He didn’t let Dean go just yet. He felt Dean beneath him, growing hard. Their position was clearly not so upsetting. Cas wondered about that. He’d thought they’d need a different vessel for this. Dean’s face fell a little. He moved and pushed Cas off. Cas let him.
“You could've just told him you didn't want to work with him. You didn't have to tie yourself up to me.”
“That doesn’t make sense. You’ve driven her.” Dean shot a glance at Cas.
“You can sleep here, since your bed is taken,” Jack offered.
Slowly Dean released him and wiped his hand off on the sheets behind him. Cas reached out to him, seemingly planning to reciprocate. Dean smiled at him.
They were together, and from that union, a child came to be. From the moment she began, she could hear her father’s stories. She could hear affection in his voice and in her mother’s too. The first things she learned of were of love, and because of that the shadow girl grew happily.
“You’re not overstepping. I just wonder if the kids will make it awkward.” He glanced out the window like he could see across town to where they were.
Castiel pulled out his phone. He typed a bit then pocketed the phone again. He walked toward the door. “I'm heading out. I'll see you at the studio tomorrow, 8:00 am. Bring your guitar, the black one.”
“Who's gonna tell Crowley?” Cas raised a brow and looked like he was actually considering it.
They pulled into the parking lot in the dry old west town. “You want me to take care of getting the room?” Sam asked.
“You’ll like him. Gavin is a character.”
“Hm, I wonder why.” Cas rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
“Bad,” Castiel interrupted. Dean nodded. “Yeah, I couldn't see it. Picking you made sense. Crowley told me not to. I hate being told what to do. I'm not a fucking tool.”
“I've only ever heard of it happening to Castiel,” Rowena said. Then she added, “And Lucifer, I guess.”
Before he fell asleep, his hand drifted to her and settled on her stomach. It did not ease his worry.
“I bet she’s been waiting for you. You two were good for each other. I didn’t know you were thinking of getting hitched though.” Dean reached across the table. He set a hand on Sam’s. “Congratulations.”
“No offence to Claire, Jody, but she didn’t ever strike me as a baby loving gal.” Dean pulled over feeling the need to really focus on this plan or maybe turn around.
“I didn’t,” Dean stammered. “I mean, I didn’t realize I had. I was just spitballing some stuff.”
“Seriously, are they doing okay?”
"It feels cruel. He did this to her before he was tortured. It feels much more wrong because of that. Why would he do that to her?"
“You’re up.” Sam turned a little and gave Dean a smile. “Figured I’d cook up the bacon and eggs that Robert brought us the other day.
“Wait, you know my music?” Dean's voice was high with shock.
And all Castiel could do now was shut off that thinking part of himself or end this. He didn't want to end this. Dean's tongue was velvety smooth and performing miracles.
Cas considered poking at Dean’s thoughts, but didn’t. “I don’t think that finding a place to pass the time in like Ramiel did would suit me. I’m not interested in fishing, or taking up pointless hobbies. I like doing what you do. It is more fulfilling.”
"I'm sorry," Sam started. "I guess we hoped that you could just fix his vessel. We didn't know if it was possible, but we hoped."
“What, done with me already?” Dean asked as he turned down the stereo. Eight hours of hard classic rock and Cas was grateful for the near quiet.
Dean was pacing back and forth in the hall by his door.
“Why are you here?” Cas asked.
Dean pulled over a chair from the nearby desk and took a seat facing him.
“Follow me,” Uriel said as he started snaking his way past the throngs of people pulling out gear and setting up five million things at once. Dean could hear Jo crooning through her most popular song, ‘Slam Another One Down.’ The crowd was eating it up.
“My pleasure. Seems as though she worked well for you. Your set sounded great.” Cas seemed different, less confident than he was earlier. His whole frame seemed to hunch into the table a little, like the day had been too long.
“We could talk now.” Dean edged closer to him.
“Got any Christmas plans with your kids?” Good, Dean. This was a safe path.
and went on. “Holding out on me like always.”
Dean remembered the way the prayers had shifted as the days wore on. He said a lot in those prayers. “You don’t say.” His words made no real sense. He watched the way they shifted Cas. He looked disappointed, somehow. So Dean leaned in and kissed him. Cas for his part, did not move away. In fact, Dean thought that he felt his head tip just a little to get a better angle. Dean leaned back into his own space. “You’re everything too, just in case that wasn’t clear. You said that we all matter and stuff, but you matter too. A lot.”
Cas rolled to the side. Everything was sticky and uncomfortable now. “I still want you to stay.”
“I went to the police with Sam in tow. They said there had been an accident. It was quick at least. Sam and I got shuffled off into a group home, Sonny’s place. It was strangely stable.”
Cas settled back into place by minute degrees, as if he was testing Dean to be sure this was okay. They could hear rattling around in the bathroom, and it was only a matter of time before Sam would emerge. In a way, they were playing a game with each other. Would they each stay this close even if Sam emerged? Who would slip away first? Who would fumble an explanation to Sam for what they were doing.
“The two on the end thought that you were good looking.”
“You really don’t need me for this one. I could work on some of the archiving stuff. Besides, Cas is gonna make this a cakewalk. He’ll likely be able to sense who’s buried where.” Sam made a convincing point. Still, Dean was in one of those phases where thoughts on Cas were shifted away from the
“Oh.” Cas said, “You’re my man?”
“What do you mean? Of course we'll meet her,” Dean said.
Their voices faded off, and Cas brought the bottle to Dean. “Never a dull moment around these parts it seems,” Mary said.
Castiel waited for the chorus and joined Dean’s playing. He didn’t sing. He just worked through the accompaniment. They sounded good together. Castiel wondered if it’d be the same if he took over the lead part, let Dean fall into playing the backup rhythm. Without warning Castiel just started playing the lead. Dean went with it. Castiel didn’t expect what happened next. Dean began singing.
“Oh, I’m just having a little fun with you. If I wanted to kill you, you’d be dead already.”
“Of course you will,” Cas mumbled.
“Huh?” Dean perked up a little. “What’s that?”
“Can I go to your bathroom to clean up.” Dean dipped in and kissed Cas’ head.
“Nephilim don't communicate with each other in that way. Years of being hunted and killed for just being what they are taught them caution. I imagine that our nephilim have been taught the same caution.” With that he got up suddenly and said, “I'm going to check on Jack.” Then he left the room.
Dean sat across from him, and Cas pulled up a seat at Gabriel's side. "No quick fixes here, Gabe. It'll take at least as much time to fix it all as it took to break it." Cas took a deep breath and held it a moment. "You had to know, a little, that this is how it'd be." There was almost a question in his words.
Each city was like the last. By the time they got to San Francisco, Cas wasn’t even the grumpiest one on the bus. That prize went to Uriel. He yelled at Crowley over the phone and trashed a perfectly good hotel room. Luc may have helped with that.
They all walked out together. Sam clapped him on the back. “Nice hat.”
“For now. Be glad we're going early. It'll be different for tomorrow's performers.” They got to a long black bus with the band's name written in flowing, purple script along the side. “Home sweet home.” Uriel opened the bus door and looked back at Dean over his shoulder. “Mind waiting here a sec? Anna might be changing in the back where the guitars are.”
Dean returned his gaze to the ceiling. “Does it now?” He smirked.
“Good, don’t feel like you have to rush. The kids are fine.” Sam laughed.
Dean leaned in. He wanted to taste love on Cas’ lips. It was something like coming home. And how he had been going so long without this, was one of life’s great mysteries. Cas deepened the kiss, pulled Dean closer, but not close enough. The items for the spell were still laid out between them. Dean held onto him though, let his fingers cling to the folds of seemingly endless trench coat. Cas lifted him up from the floor. Dean’s body seemed willing to do whatever Cas wanted.
Cas pushed away from the table and said, “I think I need to be getting back home. You mind?”
“You said you hadn’t,” Dean replied as he walked into the room with a heaping bowl of popcorn. Dean sat down right next to Cas and started munching. “You gonna hit play?”
Castiel snapped out of his shock and shook Bobby's hand. “I've heard a lot about you.”
Dean’s hold on him tightened. “You’re not.” Then silence settled into the moment. Dean just kept holding him. “Sam ever tell you what it was like for me when you were gone?” Cas turned a little to him, but their faces were so close he couldn’t really get a good look at him. “I bet he didn’t. Probably thought it was my story to share or something. Well, we both know I’m not the king of communication.”
Dean laid out a dark tee and some jeans.
Cas rounded the bed and got in next to Dean. “You need to sleep if you’re going to drive tomorrow. We should arrive while it’s still daylight.”
“Ah, you’re in luck,” Becky interrupted. “Looks like Castiel has you on his list.” She tipped her head to the side and said as if to herself, “Just you though, no Sam.”
Dean let his head fall to his chest. He let out a little gasp of a laugh. “This,” he waved his free hand up in the space between them, “this is why I love you.”
Dean stood there for a full minute, feeling dumb. Finally he turned to Meg and said, “You can go. No sense in both of us waiting forever.”
“And I just can't, Dean.” One small tear escaped Castiel's eye. He swiped at his cheek with the back of his hand.
Sam was doing his best to be his usually sunny self, but he was tired. She was explaining the keys and the hotel’s amenities to him now, and Sam was unfocused. Dean reached out and slid the keys to Sam, out of the girl’s reach. “Here, Sammy. Why don’t you guys go on up and get some sleep. I’ll be up in a minute.” Dean smiled. “He turned to the girl and asked, “They putting me up in the same room as them?”
“No all time, all band, all songs considered. It is the best. It’s…” Dean struggled for the right word and settled on, “Pure.”
Dean interrupted, “I doubt that, Cas.”
“The donkey song?” Dean asked.
Clark laughed, “Sure, dude.” He started to go. “You got a name?”
Dean’s brows came together. “Then what are we doing?”
She seemed to gain control of her balance then and said, "You don't make sense."
“You mind answering that and throwing it on speaker?” Dean asked Cas.
“It's complicated. She did a lot of bad things, but she thought that she had good reasons.” Sam's gaze slid to Rowena. “She lost someone that meant a lot to her, and she suffered at the hands of someone that was very cruel. This changed her.”
“So what sorts of stuff did you have them do?” Sam asked.
“Are you fu…” Claire stopped when her eyes caught Rebekah’s. “I mean, seriously?”
In these quiet moments, Dean knew what it was he wanted, needed. He wanted this to be real. He wanted to have this and know that it wasn’t going anywhere. It was damn near impossible to make it a reality though. After all, the union of an angel and a human was an abomination. He heard it in the tone that Cas used. Dean didn’t need that though. He just needed to be close, to be able to freely have the small moments. He wondered if it would be too much to ask for more of that. He wondered if it would be too much to ask for maybe a little more.
“Castiel.”
Dean was at every party. There was no escaping him. After all, they had planned their schedules together. As the evening progressed it was becoming increasingly clear that Dean was more than a little drunk.
“Despite what you think, I'm really entertaining this idea of yours. I feel like I haven't slept in months.”
“I shouldn’t need to.” He turned back to Dean. “The babies were fed before I put them to bed. They’ll likely wake up around 1:30 though. You should get some sleep before then.” He walked past Dean out into the hall and toward Jack’s room. He didn’t grab the duffle bag though. Dean picked it up and went into the hall. He waited.
“And cowboys.” Cas was just watching the movie as he said it.
Bobby let go of his hand and asked, “So, you mind explaining what's going on here?”
They went out the back door of the house to Cas’ pride and joy, his extensive backyard. “I spend as much time out here as possible.” Cas said as he waved a hand out at the stretch of land. There was a pool and some very tall trees lining the whole fence. There were wild flowers and benches here and there. In the distance were some beehives. Dean reached out to him and curled their fingers together.
A throat cleared at his back. He turned and saw Cas just standing in the doorway watching him. “Sam said he’d help Jack pack for the trip. They’re also going out to pick up some extra clothes for him. Sam didn’t seem to think that this room would have his size.” Cas looked around the space with a raised brow that said that maybe he kind of doubted that statement.
Castiel walked past Dean into the living room. All of the shades were drawn, except for the one in the corner. The view of the high buildings and the distant street below would have been a selling point to most. Dean didn't like heights though, and he almost chose a less convenient location that was closer to ground level. Bobby was convincing, and now Dean lived in a place that gave him vertigo when he stepped too close to the windows.
When he finished they fell back onto the bed together. Dean nuzzled up into Cas’ side. “You're my best friend.”
Cas didn’t take them off, and even leaned into her half hug as she dragged him out of the hotel to their waiting car.
Cas took a deep breath and said, “I told you it would only be a week.”
In the end he found distractions. He went back to the audition videos that he’d gotten ahold of. He watched Dean’s video again.
“It does look nice.” Cas reached out and settled a hand on Dean’s hip. You might need a back up suit though. After all, the trip might last more than one day.”
Bobby hummed and came to the seat next to his. “And you told Dean all that?”
“Thanks,” Dean muttered. “Where's Cas?”
“He literally died in front of you,” Castiel sounded appalled as he said it.
“I'm trying.” He kindly stepped back though. “As luck would have it, I do have my own room. Come back with me.”
Dean felt Cas’ fingers tighten on him a little, then Cas angled Dean’s hand just a bit lower. Dean’s fingers were grazing the top of Cas’ boxers. Dean licked his lips again, and this time Cas mirrored him. Dean flexed his fingers and let them slide just under the top part of Cas’ waistband. Cas sucked in a shaky breath and seemed to hold it.
“Rowena,” Sam started. Then quietly he said, “You know what it’s like to be possessed. I’m a little overwhelmed. Also, how can this be? How can I be his vessel? I’m in Lucifer’s line.”
She was somewhat surprised when a man stepped out of the woods. His suit was finely tailored, and not the sort of thing that one would wear in the woods or frankly anywhere near this region. They were all country folk here. “Well, you are not what I was looking for.” His words purred out over thin pink lips.
It wasn't the first time he'd asked. Dean had avoided the answers though.
They walked together, but didn’t seem to be heading for the motel exactly. “Where to?” Dean asked as they continued their walk. Cas really had no destination in mind. Neither did Joan. He’d assumed they’d go back to the motel, but they just didn’t.
The air between them was thick and warm. Dean could feel the quick drumming of Cas’ pulse just from where his hand was sitting. Everything between them was electric in that moment.
Opening it, reading it, all of that seemed like the worst possible thing to do. Life was full of bad choices, so of course he opened the envelope.
“I think so, but at the time, my attentions were elsewhere. Anna said they did.” Castiel kicked off the wall that they had been leaning on in order to float on his back for a few minutes. Dean splashed him. Clearly, this was not going to be a relaxing visit to his pool.
The gift shop was a cluttered thing, full of rows on rows of every western souvenir one could imagine. There were cowboy salt and pepper shakers, children’s cowboy costumes, complete with tiny chaps, and a row of hats for the adults in the group.
“You got your phone on you?”
Cas had been meaning to just give it to him. “Sure.” Cas took a bite. “God this is good,” he said around a bite.
Castiel looked away. “I don't think I'd be any good for him. I'm not any good for myself.”
“They’re nephilim babies, Jody.” Dean’s voice was the picture of exasperation. “Why is nobody concerned about any of this?”
“Yeah, or not.” Dean kept sliding his key card in and out of the slot, but the red light kept blinking.
I just had to remember to be confident. I just had to remember how he looked at me like I was a dish he’d like to sink his teeth into. He was into this. He had to be. I just had to breathe.
Dean committed. There were two rooms on this floor. Castiel's room was on the left. He wondered if Castiel had the same schedule they did, arrive at 5 for hair and make-up. Perform at 7 and 9. Their performance times would be different but maybe not the prep times. He also wondered if Cas was sharing a room with his band or if he had some privacy.
They talked of a bunch of things, Sam getting out, their album, the eventual tour. Time passed them by all slow and steady. It was easy taking with Sam. Cas liked the way they'd go from serious to silly in an instant. They bickered about the past. They talked pop culture like it was their second language, and Castiel had trouble following some of it.
“Can we get on with this?” Dean asked, not masking his frustration.
Well, there were a couple of times all involving Winchester deaths, but this was different.
“You love it.” Dean hung off the edge of the big yellow float. Cas swam over to the opposite side. They stared at each other across the space. Castiel’s heart was hammering in his chest from the playing before. Occasionally, he would feel the brush of Dean’s leg under the water. “Do you have an early morning tomorrow?”
Dean felt encouraged. “You know, you’re right. He pulled another outfit from the rack. “Sit, I’ll give this one a go. And no getting up and peeking. Spoils things.”
“I’m going because I’ve put it off long enough.” He pulled away from Dean’s grasp. “You don’t need me here right now. You’ll survive.”
Now that he was alone Castiel didn't want to leave, didn't want to face anyone.
“You knew I was coming to the studio today. You knew about the contracts being signed.” Dean looked confused, his forehead wrinkling up a little.
“Too many temperature changes.” Castiel ran his hands up Dean’s thighs. “You enjoying this at all?”
Cas was way better at this than me. I thought maybe he really felt the irritation that was on display in his squinty eyed glare. We each took a synchronized bite of pie. The girls looked a little concerned. Alex started to reach for one of the extra pie plates, like this was going to be an eating event for her. I reached out and slid the plate back to our side of the counter and made sure that it was in front of Cas.
where he felt so free.
There was peace until Father Thomas came to her door for his semi-annual talk of faith and her seeming lack of it. She did not go to church or contribute a tithing. It seemed pointless to her. He stood at her door waiting for an invitation to enter. She considered closing the door in his smug face. She sensed interest from him that was less than chaste. It was also dark out. He had no business visiting an unmarried woman at night. It would increase the rumors about her that were already plentiful enough.
“Then why do you wish to read about them?”
Ruby got up and hovered over him. “No, he is not a singer. You are. Your brother is,” she said as she turned to him with a smirk. “Even I can belt it, but Michael is not a singer. Let’s not ruin the good thing we got going here boys.”
“I'm sorry, I,” Dean started then moved forward and held out his hand. “I'm Dean Winchester.”
Cas asked, "Why did you sire them? They were conceived at least several years ago. You didn't know anything about heaven falling or any of this at the time."
“That late?” Dean lifted his phone and checked the time. “Seriously?”
“I’m sorry.”
“You don't know what I was doing. Do you always just barge into people's recording time?” This wasn’t how Castiel thought their reconnection would go. Actually he didn't think there would be a reconnection at all, but seeing Dean again did something to him. It stirred up past frustrations. Feelings that never got their release suddenly became petty irritants that drifted from his lips into the space between them.
He felt guilt wash over him.
“You’ve got no business being mad at me.” Bobby was following him from room to room in his penthouse. Dean wondered if he’d stop following him if he locked himself in the bathroom. He turned on his heels and headed that way. Bobby seemed to see the path and blocked him. “You need this.”
“Didn't know that was necessary,” Sam said.
Dean walked to the piano. He sat and wedged his coffee cup between his legs. Castiel appreciated how he didn’t just set it on the beautifully polished lid. Others would have. Dean began playing something soft. It was familiar.
He didn't know what was right anymore. There seemed to be no point, no light at the end of the darkness, no reward or even peace. "I don't have any love left in me. You took it with you, you goddamn sonofabitch." Dean was losing it more and more. His face was a mess of tears now. His breathing came in rough gaps.
Now Dean reached out and took Castiel's face in his hands, angling him so he had to meet Dean's gaze. “Ten years is a long time to wait.”
Dean held the guitar gently at first. “Reminds me of my Baby.”
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean laughed a little, and Cas could feel the gentle rumble of it up his back. “It tore me up though. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t think straight. Everything was just you. I hated everyone and everything. I was horrible to Jack, but you already knew about that.”
Dean reached in and pulled out a shirt. He started folding it. “I understand. It just felt sudden. Did something happen? Is Jack okay?” Dean kept pulling out clothes and folding them. Cas had his hands settled on the sides of the bag, but he didn’t help with the folding.
“Okay.”
She considered letting it be. Rowena was a practical woman, and the rabbit would provide sustenance for at least three days. She gave it a swift death, scooped it up by its back legs, and carried it home.
The silence dragged out. He’d drowned before in the dream world that Michael made for him. Who could have known how prophetic it all would be. Cas leaned back. “I’m going with you then.”
Dean just stood there, mouth agape, before saying, “Well okay then. Go big or go home.”
They both spoke simultaneously, “We are Phobos and Deimos, though not the first of those names.”
“Sounds good. I’ll get these to you all in two shakes.” She moved off to the order window and put the tag up.
Dean stepped back a moment, a bit of shock on his face. He just stared but didn’t say anything for a moment, like he had to figure it all out, put the pieces together. “Uh,” Dean started.
“I'm currently parked in front of some old burger joint called Hanks.”
“Mess up?”
“He’s a mess. I only included him as a favor to an old friend.”
“You heard me praying when I was in there didn’t you?” Dean had wondered, but he hadn’t asked before.
“I could show you a ball drop,” Luc said with a wink.
“Cas.” She sounded annoyed. “Please.”
“So she's deaf as well?” Cas asked.
“So was there anything I could help you with, Mr. Winchester?” The receptionist asked.
Dean said, "They stayed in infancy until very recently. I think it's been a very confusing time for them."
It was a secret they never acknowledged even with each other. It would change everything, end everything if either of them ever dropped the act. So they became very good at acting, at keeping up the lie that gave them what they wanted.
“Yes, there’s that,” Cas said with a sigh. “It’s funny.”
“It is,” Gabriel responded. “We’ve only been able to determine that the orange part of the phenomenon is putting out some considerable energy. The Impala gathered some data before the event. You can see that here.” Cas watched the probes emerge from the side of the vessel. They’d have sent the data back to Calliope immediately, and Calliope would have sent the data onward as well, just as quickly. Gabriel added, “I’m going to fast-forward a bit.” The video jumped ahead by twenty minutes. Apparently, they decided to send one of the crew out in a small pod to get a closer look.
“What do you mean?”
Cas wasn’t really eating his sandwich, so Dean said, “Eat.” Dean folded his hands in front of him. “Sam’s gonna ask Eileen to marry him when he gets home.”
Bobby was still fixing him with a squinty eyed stare fit to pin Castiel to the floor. Then he moved away from the door and to the chairs. Next to Castiel's chair was his notebook and pen. He used it to jot down lyrics or ideas. Bobby started flipping through it. Finding a blank page he stopped and picked up a pen. He was writing something.
A small girl approached them from the parade with a flower in her hand and beckoned to Sam. He stooped down to her level. “Well, hello there little Missy.”
“Yeah, well, tell that to the band that doesn’t have a lead singer anymore.”
“You are, and ever shall be the most unusual of all the humans.” Cas sat.
“You don’t have to. It’s your song.”
“Thank you.” Rowena smiled and slipped out of the bar and back into the world. It seemed that her wards had done more than just bar the local demons from her land; they had also made things seem unpassable. And the demon that she exorcised had spread rumors, believable ones, apparently.
“You actually think Sam’s the…”
“Do we have any stills of what is behind the light?” Cas asked.
Crowley laughed. “Just keeping you on your toes, love.”
Bobby added, “Thought Dean had figured it all out when he stormed out of the studio. Luckily my talk with Cas worked.”
“Maybe you should go. I can call you a car” Dean reached for his phone.
“You aren’t making a whole lot of sense,” Dean huffed out. “When do I get my brother back?”
“He’s expecting you on Friday at the studio.”
Dean got up, walked to the other room, picked up the tarp, and returned. In a few deft moves, he shook out the tarp and laid it carefully over Cas. He smoothed out the edges, and stalked out the door to Sam. He didn’t look back. He couldn’t look back. Now was not the time for him to break.
“Are you saying that you won’t take care of the angry spirit, Dean?”
Cas glanced at him, and some sort of silent communication seemed to pass between them. Cas set his hand back on Rebekah again, and Jack set his hand on Cas’ shoulder. Cas was wearing a pair of Dean’s old plaid pajama pants and a tight black t-shirt.
As always thank you for any kudos you feel like leaving and any kind words. You can also find me on Tumblr under the name
Castiel looked at his hands, folded, clenched really.
“Maybe you should try new things. You might like them.” Cas finished his coffee and set the mug on the counter. “Get dressed. I think I know where we need to go today.”
“So awesome.” Cas was devouring the burger. Being around Dean had killed some of his table manners, but who cared. “This is amazingly good. You can have the guitar by the way.” It was all delivered around several bites of burger.
“Pies are easy to make. I make them every year. You just have to follow the recipe for the crust. There’s no room for improvisation.” He licked his lips like the mere thought of pie was getting him all hungry.
Dean watched him for a moment. He looked almost peaceful. He licked his lips a little and left a little sheen on them. Cas wanted to move closer, press his own lips to him. “Do you ever poke at my thoughts like you did with those guys?”
“So you might be able to open up a hole between here and wherever angels go when they die. And you might be able to pull Cas out of there and back to us?” The last was definitely a question.
“I am, but only a little.” They fell into silence for a time, and Rowena read. She noted the hidden symbols in the illumination, the sigil that the artist painted into the margin. She copied some things from the book onto a thin piece of hide that she had brought with her. The hide in her possession was not of the same quality as the hides used for this book. Her father would have been impressed. He made the thin hides used for books nearly as often as he tanned the hides for clothing and other things.
“That doesn’t make sense,” she said as she pointed to one part of Cas’ calculations. “If you go with this number, you’re assuming more gravitational pull in this region than there actually is.”
“I would. Their thoughts are pure. It’s refreshing to see such thoughts.” Cas was smiling, all soft as he stared out the window.
“Well, it sounds like you had something you wanted to tell me?” Sam asked.
The parade would be starting soon. It was meant to celebrate the homecoming game. There were two high schools in Cora. There was Downtown Cora High, and there was Rural Cora High. Old Mo said that some years RCH had some very strong players, but that this year the DCH kids would likely win. Regardless, everyone was in high spirits about the game.
“Oh,” Dean muttered as he started to pull his hand away. Cas held on though. “Guess the sex was…”
Castiel slowed down. He watched Dean’s hands as he went through the chords. He let his eyes drift to Dean’s face as he sang the familiar song.
He set the gun back into the holster under the table. There was a note peeking out from the edge of the bedding in the bassinet. Dean pulled it out as Sam slowly shuffled into the room, rubbing his eye with the back of his fist. When he focused on the table, the sleep rushed away from him. “What the hell is that?”
Michael came over and clapped Dean on the back. “Ya wanna go get a drink, celebrate our triumphant return?”
“If I thought that would get you to sleep, I’d have offered.” Cas smiled and added. “Go to sleep.” He opened his laptop back up and went back to work. Dean kept staring at him, processing all of that.
The distant missions that Cas flew were not to places that the pleasure trips and medical trips flew. In time maybe that too would change, but for now, seven to eight months of space travel was too much for most civilians. Cas may have flown numerous missions but even he had only done the trip to Calliope four times. Each trip held a special place in his heart, because the Calliope was the space station located near Mars, the planet that Cas hoped to call home in the future.
Cas grabbed his arm and said, "Or maybe you stick around, do the hard thing, try to face this. Don't run away. Don't abandon them again." Gabriel let his head drop a little. Then he nodded. Cas got up and headed for the hall. "I'll see you in the morning. Try working on your vessel for a bit. Fixing that seems like a good start. You can work on the bigger fixing later."
“I need to know that everyone is plenty okay with this,” Dean replied.
“You act like you didn’t have any hand in helping.” Mary laughed. She clapped a hand on Charlie’s shoulder. “This one is quite the hunter. Could have taken them all out single handedly.”
“We got kinda busy with these two.” Bobby came down the stairs first and threw one arm around Dean in a half hug. “By the way, this here is little Zeke and Mary’s holding little Brie. They came with letters, just in case you lot think I’d name a baby after a cheese.” Bobby turned his attention to Zeke and started making faces at him.
“The didgeridoo?”
“The articles that just got deleted. All the pieces you had came from the one source.” Cas looked up from the laptop at Sam. Dean followed this from the mirror.
Cas eased down into the bed and tucked his sock-covered feet into the sheets, apparently making himself quite at home.
A few weeks passed and they were back in the bunker. Sam was finally worn out. And as luck would have it, a case came up. Sam wanted to stay behind, pleading exhaustion as reason enough for a break. Dean said that he and Cas could handle it.
“Do I need to say anything?” Dean asked.
“No,” Dean said. He went right up to the little girl. He got down into a crouch. “You okay?”
“No!” Dean set a palm on the side of the Impala and said, “He didn’t mean it Baby. He just doesn’t think sometimes.”
Cas didn't let him finish. “It was perfect. I've never come so fast.” Cas looked away, a shyness taking over his features. “I can be your friend.”
“What’d I do?” Dean sat up and in doing so, brought them closer together. He made a pretense of shoving the pillows up behind him. Still his arm was pressed solidly against Cas’ own.
“Please, call me Gabriel.”
“You do, if you like the person well enough. I like you well enough, Dean. Take the guitar.”
And no, Dean most certainly did not know that. He was still operating on the assumption that this was a quicky, and no, not that kind of quicky. “Why’d he do that?”
Old Mo said, “Suit yourself.” He smiled, and started heading back toward Sam. Dean watched him a moment then followed him.
“You could have picked someone else though or not picked anyone.” Dean was feeling the warmth of his drink spreading through him.
“Maybe.” Cas kissed him again, just shy of his lips. “If it seemed like I needed to pique your interest, keep it from going elsewhere.”
He told himself for the hundredth time.
Cas picked up a stray pencil from the table and rewrote her equation. Joan’s face went through several changes. “This should show you what you’ve been looking for.”
“It was.” Claire laid back down. “Now let me sleep.” She waved at the door.
Dean struggled with that, the careful image he put out there of himself.
He was wrong. Rebekah just stood there saying nothing. They all waited for a bit too long for something to happen. It didn’t. Thankfully, Jack helped break the silence. He took her other hand and  said, “You want to pick out a bedroom?” She nodded and let go of Sam’s hand and allowed Jack to lead the way.
“Cas, let’s check out the seats. I don’t trust this one with the installation.” Dean hooked a thumb over his shoulder at Sam as he rushed up and out the door, leaving his half-eaten breakfast on the table.
As soon as they came into the bunker she walked right up to Sam and took his hand. “Another one,” Sam had said. He stood awkwardly staring between them and the girl. The bassinets were on the table behind him. Dean immediately went to them to see how they were. Finding them sleeping, he returned his attention to Sam and the others.
