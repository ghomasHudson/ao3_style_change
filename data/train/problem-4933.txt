benefit. What about Crowley, and Balthazar and… and Castiel,” Dean choked.  “I’m supposed to just accept they are all collateral damage? Fuck that.”
So he tried not to beg and plead as Castiel continued to torture him, his phenomenally strong arms never seeming to tire as he continued to dangle Dean helplessly in front of his face, twisting and turning him enough to nibble and nip at the inside of his thighs, licking and sucking on his balls, swiping his tongue over the shiny red angry flesh of Dean’s painfully aroused cock.
Too fucking late, you assholes, he decided.
The guy’s eyes went wide, the color drained from his cheeks and he scurried out of the door without protest, only to yelp in terror as he crashed into Viktor who was standing outside with his shoulder holster in clear view like a hulking movie goon.

Dean sighed and his expression softened. “Of course you helped, Sam. You got me to
“They just delay the inevitable, father. What’s the point? It’s been two weeks. They’re already more than halfway to Nova. If Dean had taken the truth well, he would have sent a sub-space transmission and I would have received it by now. He knows we bonded.  He knows the consequences to me of us breaking that bond. He is, however, under no obligation to take responsibility for my own foolishness.”
"Well, I don't think anyone wanted to involve the Russians at all if they could help it. I'm pretty sure Bobby was planning on negotiating directly with Castiel," Sam said, looking confused.
“Oh, that’s useful,” he groaned. “Let’s apply a spell that makes my arm light up like a beacon just in case any monsters haven’t already noticed me arrive.”
“It’s priceless to me,” he insisted.
No more than the occasional moments of softness between them over the last two weeks - or the undeniable mutual sexual attraction - was indicative of anything other than ‘attraction’.
Dean shrugged indifferently. “Well, yeah, sure, of course,” he said, “ but that’s hardly relevant is it?”

Boy, was I wrong. Well, maybe not in Emmett’s particular case. Don’t really think his brain capacity would have brought much to the party but, still, that’s possibly unfairly judgemental. I shouldn’t assume his intelligence level based on his choice of career, should I?  I mean that’s the same mistake as I made with Sam.”
His tone was matter of fact, a mere statement of fact. He had been only eleven months old at the time. Twenty three years after an event he didn’t even remember, he spoke without particular emotion about a happening he had been told about but didn’t recall experiencing. It was hurtful knowledge, rather than painful remembrance.
mental disassociation was exactly the same as Richard’s.”
Eileen, Castiel reminded himself urgently. Don’t forget the existence of Eileen.
They were too loud, too talkative, too… well… cheerful for Castiel’s tastes.
Sam chewed his lower lip, his face blotchy with dried tears, his eyes somehow  looking both hurt and relieved.  “First time I looked in a mirror, I did the same thing,” he admitted, quietly. “Looked at me and saw

He turned tail and ran, his cat instincts taking over completely as he dropped to four legs and scarpered.
Gabriel whistled under his breath. “What are the odds, huh? Has an actual human being ever had this effect on you before?”
For the first time in his life, instead of feeling powerful and commanding in his Suit, Castiel felt like a bland, faceless accountant standing in the shadow of a rock star.
Cas smiled beatifically. Then he clenched his buttocks and flicked his pelvis upwards, driving a deep groan of satisfaction from his mate.  Conversation was forgotten entirely for a few minutes as Dean continued his experiment of whether  ‘Rode hard and put away wet’ was just a saying or a physical possibility.  So far the experiment was proving highly successful, although Cas was not the only one of them whose skin was glistening with sweat.
Jimmy rolled his eyes.  “So why don’t you just

-human features that made them so terrifyingly alien.
Which fully explained why Cas wanted to know where Dexter Cain was, Sam decided. He checked the time and winced. “Probably too late for you to catch him today. The market will be closing up before you get there. It opens at six and shuts well before lunch because the stalls always sell out early.”
“Incoming,” Ash yelped, an instant before the door blew off its hinges in an explosion of wood and a small army of demons began to pour through the door.
Dean chewed a piece of toast, swallowed it, then said, “Nuh huh. No objections here.” Then he winced as his abused cock twitched its enthusiastic agreement.
. In the meantime, at our suggestion, he has deposited the substantial and surprisingly generous amount of 2000 credits into your account as he accepts that your time between now and then is chargeable. That concludes our legal obligations to both of you in this matter. I suggest in future that you negotiate your own fees, Polilla. The City Guard does not exist to act as your Patron.”
“And his reaction to the information?”
” Dean asked.
“I apologize for my late arrival,” Jimmy said, seating himself in an empty chair and, though he was speaking to all of them, his attention was fully on Dean. “I have given the matter a great deal of consideration and have decided I would like to assist you all in your endeavor.”
He didn’t even want to play the damned game.
“Really?” Dean demanded, torn between being awed and thrilled. They really wanted him that much?  He was welcomed enough that the other colonists had actually paid his settlement fee on his behalf?
Dean squirmed awkwardly in his arms. “Um, I might have done something,” he admitted quietly. “It wasn’t on purpose.”
Ash wasn’t happy but he was out of options unless he was willing to risk kidney damage.
”My leg over what?” Castiel asked stupidly, his brain still ringing with alert sirens.
”Fuck that,” Dean announced succinctly, reaching down to pull his boots off and then unfastening his jeans and shimmying them down his hips. “I’d rather do this in fur than ruin my jacket.”
Dean offered him a wide shit-eating grin.  “Nah, it’s all cool,’ he said. His scent was satisfied. Triumphant. Smug.

have got a hell of a lot to gain.”
“Holy shit, you’re right,” Dean exclaimed.  “If I’m not bothered about trying to win SP, using a different weapon will be fine. It will still win me XP and keep me alive. I won’t be able to use any combat skill points to advance the weapon, since those are tied to my dagger, but as long as I am a high enough character level and my weapon is advanced enough, it won’t be a huge disadvantage. Well, not against other normal Player characters, anyway.”
Despite his intent to spend
He heard a roar that sounded primal, animalistic, a sound that ripped through the night like the rumbling thunder of an avalanche. Or a wild beast, perhaps.  Whatever the source of the noise, it caused his eardrums to feel like they might literally burst; it caused every hair on his body to stand proud from his flesh and goosebumps to raise on his arms and legs.
Still, he shrugged his supposed disappointment off easily enough because he immediately invited Castiel to accompany him to Trianolis so his wounds could be treated. The Mer City was in an Easterly direction anyway, he assured Castiel. “So perhaps I am not going to be lucky myself but, who knows? It might be that your true mate is one of my people. At the least, you should come check out our royalty for yourself. Most of them are a little too interbred if you know what I mean. Not to the point they have two tails or three eyes but, sheesh, they’re dumb. Couple of them are real pretty though. I mean I wouldn’t say ‘no’ to them myself. Just don’t expect any scintillating conversation.”
Where Rafe had stood, the street was now empty.
The remaining Volkrod wanted him to drive right through those gates.  He wasn’t sure how they were hiding their spoor.  But the fact he couldn’t smell or hear them meant wherever they had concealed themselves, they weren’t going to be able to easily surprise him if he was on foot.
“I am so fucked,” he repeated, staring at himself in the mirror of his own bathroom. Even clothed, his face and hands would still reveal the peculiar (if fortunately very faint) hue to his skin.  It wouldn’t even matter in his case because he could either conceal it with a faint dust of concealing powder - and Gabriel was vain enough to use such products and had left several of them scattered in the Annex’s various bathrooms - or he could just pretend he was wearing make-up himself if anyone noticed. Though, realistically, would anyone even care? Hell, he was already known to be a Praevalen. Most people probably expected them to look ‘blueish’ anyway. If anyone had the nerve to ask he could claim he had always had this faint blue sheen and had simply decided to stop concealing it.
Though that was a puzzling thought. Why would Dean have travelled directly south, then moved east to here, only to then turn tail and return the way he had come? Had he been alone? Had he met with Wildlings here and then traveled with them back in a westerly direction? Was that why there were no other Mer here? No other anything here? Not even a single, solitary fish as far as Castiel’s eyes could see?
“That’s perfectly reasonable,”Cain agreed. “Eileen said you told her that you never deliberately intended to ignore Dean. That he simply always chose the wrong moment to knock on your door,” he said, his tone questioning.
As he neared the vessel he realized, with some relief, that its hull was still intact. Despite the odd angle at which it was slumped in the water, it was not in danger of actually sinking unless the waves on the surface were stirred into violence by a storm. Since the weather was calm and the sky was cloudless above, with the moon and stars clearly visible, the occupants had hours, if not days, for another Land monster vessel to come to their aid. And he could hear voices shouting from the deck, proving the humans had survived.

more serious than that,” Charlie whispered, her expression stricken. “The reason Amara’s coding sometimes kills players is, when faced with situations that threaten their avatar’s lives, some people can’t deal with the pain and terror of facing a virtual death. They experience real-life heart failure and Amara’s coding also affects the safety mechanisms of their tanks so they fail to operate correctly to alert the authorities they need medical assistance.  Obviously, very few people have inherent health issues that would cause such an extreme response to such a situation so people aren’t just dropping like flies, which is why no one has really noticed yet.”

“Keep the faith, Cassie. I already have a lead on a possible suitable planet.  Won’t say more than that right now, ‘Cos it’s a delicate negotiation, but I’ve put some cautious feelers out and I have a meeting with someone today who genuinely seems able and willing to help.”

“You, on the other hand, becoming so publicly aware of the mistaken identity would inevitably, and totally understandably, have reacted... badly, I believe,” Cain suggested carefully.
And, so, he told her everything of his last three years. Of his secret life outside of the palace.
“You’d actually help your own Subplex to escape you? Taking all of your Praevalen powers with him?” Gabriel demanded.
“But you said…”
“Of course,” Dean agreed. “You didn’t need to ask.”
“You’d be surprised,” Loki snickered.
He did sleep, but not well. He was restless, not only because of the unfamiliar surroundings, though they alone caused him to startle every time he heard a noise or smelt the tang of unfamiliar creatures in the water that wafted through his hiding place, but also because every time he closed his eyes and tried to clear his thoughts, his mind filled with his last sight of Dean, with the shattered look on Dean’s face, with the wry lack of disappointment on Dean’s face.
The sound shook him out of his panic. He hadn’t even moved into the kitchen - or started eating and drinking from the larder - until the day after he’d examined and photographed the first floor, he suddenly remembered.
“She was working for Microsoft then and they had just moved their Head office to Redmond so it made sense for us to move closer anyway. Dad didn’t take that lying down, though, and there were fights and legal shit and it was all pretty fucked up for a while. Thing is, on paper my Dad was the good guy, war hero and all that and my mom… well, let’s just say she’d done a few questionable things when she was younger, done a lot of anti-war protesting and gotten herself arrested a few times, and Dad found a sympathetic judge, one of those misogynistic bastards who believed a man’s right to his son and heir trumped everything.

words at all. Gan being offended would be more than enough justification for Sam Winchester to come storming here, guns blazing,” Gabriel pointed out worriedly. “Sam could probably call Castiel out in an old-fashioned duel over it and there isn’t a pack in the world who would condemn him for doing so.”
“Why? Like you said, there’s only going to be one point between them. Dean wins, Cain bites the bullet, Amara’s codes get reset. We all go home. Easy peasy.”
”And, most importantly, since the bad-ass Alpha is an

But he was Dean Winchester, he reminded himself, so he put his game face on. Politely thanked Ellen for her drinks and ‘hospitality’, and then, his expression fixed into a deliberately careless smile, he sauntered out of the bar into the cool, darkness of the desert night.
Sam flinched slightly at Dean’s chilly tone. “Look, before we speak, can you do something for me?” he asked.
The storm didn’t let up.
It whimpered pathetically.
“But a POWER company is a beast of a different color, isn’t it? Owning 25% of an independent utility supplier is a whole different ballgame.”
Or perhaps not, because that was the moment someone hammered on the front door of the boarding house with the news that both Dean and Hortlan had gone missing.
Having only two demons to deal with outside of the building meant it was fast and easy for them to despatch them and reach the front door of the Keep.  What he wasn’t happy about was the idea of leaving Sam outside on his own whilst they entered and he wasn’t cocky enough to believe he and Benny could handle 14 demons
The End.
So, it turned out that inner thigh friction burn was a ‘thing’.
“Hence your long hours and problem with staffing,” Castiel pointed out bluntly.
“I don’t know,” Castiel admitted. “It would have been a more logical approach.”
Oh he was beautiful. He was irresistibly beautiful. He had the kind of beauty that forced anyone who saw him to covet it. Possess it. Own it.
“I know,” Sam agreed, some of his own temper waning a little.
But now, sitting next to the Omega,

The god looked stymied.  “Oh,” he said, apologetically. “This is my usual personally preferred human form. I can devise another more to your specific liking if you prefer.”
Castiel looked to where the crevice had lain like a black scar across the landscape of Sam’s back and saw nothing more than a healthy field of orange and rust-colored corn swaying in a light breeze.
Castiel was promising Sam was safe from the Volkrod.
Waking up the next morning, Castiel still felt so embarrassed about the events at Hunter’s Mountain that, left to his own devices, he would have happily crawled under a big rock and never emerged again.
Returning to Wolfsbane would lay bare their souls to each other.
“So, um, why’s that a bad thing… because I can tell from your faces that it
“No,” Castiel said, as he finally noticed what was holding Sam’s attention. “I intend to consume those myself.”
To: Bitch
“No wonder you hardly drink in the club,” Dey’n laughed, as he slipped slightly on one of the steps and was only saved from falling by his strong grip on the handrail. “I’d hate having to climb this thing drunk.”
Castiel winced as he considered Gabriel’s email. The date of Gabriel’s email.
Even so, his heart was thudding with panic as he turned back and proffered his wrist for them to scan.  He sighed with relief when it blazed green.
He tried not to flinch as she ran her fingers caressingly up his wrists, then ran them slowly over his arms, pausing to feel his biceps. Then she trailed her fingers all over his chest until she reached his neck, where she paused to knead slightly around his collar bones, before cupping his face in her slender fingers, regarding him solemnly and then, without warning, she suddenly leaned forward and kissed him.
“How do you know? Maybe it’s Cain AND Roman together. Maybe they’ve bled into each other like you and Mortimer Blake?” Sam suggested.
“I wouldn’t say that out loud around here, pup,” the gruff voice advised. “Folks in the clans don’t take kindly to the term. That’s what folks like you call folks like us. Not what we call ourselves.”
way.”
Castiel flinched and took a step backward, his eyes wide and wounded. Jimmy immediately moved supportively to stand by his side.  Dean shot both of them a look that was a mix of angry disappointment and hurt betrayal.
“There isn’t enough money in the world to make Sam voluntarily play a digital game,” Dean replied, with a genuinely amused chuckle. “It would probably take someone’s life literally being on the line for him to even consider it. But the very fact the guy wearing Sam’s face is a homicidal maniac throws that option out of the window anyway. It wasn’t him. He isn’t capable of that kind of crap.”

Which seemed completely contrary to the game plan Charlie had described for both the Knights AND the Demons.
Dean’s face fell.
Of course, the S.I. had immediately pointed out that the alert was a ‘good thing’.  Crowley’s next level up would be to 50.  On the surface that was a huge bonus, jumping from a pathetic 15 to a strong 50 in one fell swoop. Particularly if he still retained the 'doubling up' ratio of his HP. He would effectively become the equivalent of a level 100 player,  which would literally immediately make him the strongest player currently in Moondoor. The problem was that the level up required a vast amount of XP and the best and fastest way to gather XP in that kind of quantity wasn’t by fighting

“Oh, yes,” Crowley agreed. “Because no one had ever bothered to explain to the ex-mariposa that he couldn’t marry. That this was nothing more than a masterful trap that had been set specifically to capture him. And then, perhaps because it was too late, because the proposal had been accepted and the boy now had no way to escape his trap, the Dom made the mistake of admitting the truth, mocking the butterfly, laughing at him, telling him that he was now nothing more than property again, a slave again.

She only had one remaining idea, a total long shot, of how to help her… her… okay, damnit, her friend.
“Is this what you two were arguing about earlier?” Sam asked, with an arched brow.
“What?”
Rationality seemed to have gone out of the window for the whole pack.  Despite the fact the Volkrod had first arrived in America sixteen years before Dean had even been born, the Faelchu were no longer only claiming that Samuel’s failure to identify Dean’s designation had caused the

The Destiny stone immediately flared to life.
Dexter’s had a riot of brightly coloured dahlias in pots and he could imagine their cheerful heads bobbing happily outside the study window. Maybe he’d just start with a few of those. But then it occurred to him he didn’t even have tools yet. He’d need a spade and a fork and a trowel and… well, probably more than that but those were the only tools that immediately came to mind. Although, since this was a hardware store, he imagined Dexter would be able to sell him whatever basics he needed until he could go to a proper plant nursery.
”Such as sight, huh?” Gan asked, looking slightly pensive.
for someone to buy a bespoke avatar so completely alien to their genuine appearance. Because, apparently, bespoke avatars were designed to be so complex and lifelike they had to be, of necessity, based on a real person.  Bespoke avatars were built over the framework of genuine biometric scans. Sure, once created they could be
“What circumstances?”
Dean wondered if the Volkrod prisoner was getting as tired of living here as he was.
“They’re just supposed to be his retirement hobby. If I’d known he’d just swap this business for creating another one, I would never have agreed to take the store off his hands.”
Arms outstretched widely, clawed hands squeezing in grabby motions,  he excitedly bound towards Sam, howling “PuttyTAAAAAT.”
“Know why I know that?” Rafe said, his own right hand darting forward to grab Dean around the neck. “Because you might have a surprisingly high resistance to the external effects of Dominant pheromones but it’s irrelevant because you’re not a mere Submissive. You’re Polilla. That means you’re a Subplex.  Once my pheromones are inside you, you’ll literally be addicted to me. It’s like the worst type of drug addiction. Only takes one dose and you’re fucked. Literally in your case. So I hope you enjoyed this moment of defiance, Cunnus, because it will be your last. You will spend the rest of your life crawling after me and begging me to give you your daily ‘fix’.”
O’Toole looked confused.
Obviously, Dean was shortly about to find out why Meg hadn’t been at the club when he’d looked for her. She and Gabriel were already secreted within one of the ship’s passenger berths.
Gan sighed. “So why did you let me unknot it and iron it?”

“You’re fully merged now?”
“It doesn’t have to be,” Castiel replied quietly. “If Moondoor survives, then the concept of ‘lifetimes’ will no longer be valid for anyone. If you will accept nothing else from me, will you accept this? That I promise when Jimmy no longer has a need for me, I will return to Moondoor and, if you still want me, we can reunite here.”
Maybe he could get the irritating but undeniably useful V.I. to investigate the company records for details of exactly what had happened 15 years earlier.  Dean wasn’t yet ready to face the bombshell of his Mother’s involvement with Roman Enterprises. His feelings were too raw on the matter and it stood to reason that finding out the details of exactly how she’d died was going to not only open up old wounds but probably stick a knife in them for good measure. But at the same time he knew it was something he was going to have to deal with sooner or later. Inconvenient truths rarely stayed buried forever. They had a nasty way of crawling out of their graves like zombies, ready to jump out and bite you when you least expected them. So maybe it would be best to just rip the band aid off and get it over and done with.

Dean was toting enough firepower to be a one-man army.
He had found himself bemoaning the situation to Donald one evening, as they shared a bottle of scotch after a long week of work, and then he had apologised profusely after several more glasses and a long, rambling and often incoherent explanation of his problem.  Donald, however, had waived away his apology because, unexpectedly, it had turned out that Donald was privately a great believer in the concept of an impending digital revolution.  Apparently he already held a number of shares in IBM and Sun Microsoft and believed the fledgling personal computer industry was poised to become the next 'gold rush' investment.

Rejecting the Federation entirely for the sake of people who make up a tiny fraction of less than one percent of the population makes no sense whatsoever.

The advances in medicine alone justify our inclusion.”
He looked charmed by the prospect, though if he were not Omega she might have sworn his glance at her was more one of attraction than interest in her as a ‘friend’.
“Neither I, nor Castiel have complained about the situation. We both understood the necessity and we fully appreciate your efforts in turning the tide of public opinion in favor of Moondoor and its people. We both accepted this was the price we had to pay to support your campaign. But enough is enough. Now that the President of France is hosting her own V.I. and media attention has, fortunately, turned firmly in her direction, I have the opportunity to bow out gracefully from the spotlight of public interest.

Because it wasn’t all bad.  The Aga had barely put up a fight when he had used the stacked cords of wood to bring its blazing heart back to life.  It was remarkable how quickly the kitchen had warmed up, as the range had heated the water in the attached piping and sent it gurgling and clanging throughout the house in an antiquated form of central heating.  He’d found candles and oil lamps in the kitchen cabinets, then had found a large store of oil in the Dutch Barn and, glory of glories, a wind up transistor radio.

The Mount would be offering its rider a shit-load of XP but that wouldn’t work if the rider was dismounted.  In his goblin avatar, what Dean did next wouldn’t have worked but he was in a bespoke Avatar now, one that reflected his real-life size and height (well, if in RL he could stand up), and so instead of running away from the charging Anakorn he ran
Dean just blinked, swaying woozily, not even sure if this was a dream.

His mouth felt parched and dry, his throat scratchy, as he realized he had been talking to the rabbit all along, telling it god-only-knew what kind of personal crap just to hear the sound of his own voice, or something.
They were in the parking lot, where Dean was divesting himself of various weapons and stashing them inside a carefully constructed hidden compartment in the trunk of his car.
“Oops,” Ash said, as his silver-plated sword skewered one of the small wolves with a critical hit and it collapsed to the floor, dead, before shimmering out of existence, leaving nothing behind except a pelt. “Too late.”
Sink plugs sat next to dog chews, batteries sat next to candles. Knitting wool was stacked next to rolls of tar paper. A box marked padlocks was next to a box stating ‘worming tablets’. There was an old coffee tin with a label on it marked Roof Tacks sitting alongside stacked tins of actual coffee. Beside them, there was a plastic crate marked Tennis Balls. There was a whole shelf filled with what looked like cold remedies, headache tablets and antacids, although in the middle of those items there was a cardboard box labelled Shotgun Cartridges.

Charlie was completely confused. None of this added up. “So why did Samuel Campbell believe it was okay to kill Henry? Had the Faelchu lost so much knowledge of Wolfkin history that they had forgotten that Omega-kin were due almost as much honor as Omegas themselves?”
Not helped by the fact that Sam had a whole hipster ‘man-bun’ thing going on. It was all part of Sam enthusiastically embracing his new planned ‘student’ persona, which was such an improvement on the emo sulky bitch of his earlier teens that Dean carefully refrained from commenting on how much he thought Sam looked ridiculous.  He was doing his best to support
judged Mariposa. Someone whose tiny, almost imperceptible, genetic imperfection disqualified them from entrance into a Courtesan Academy. Denied the ‘opportunity’ to become Courtesans, they inevitably became trained concubines instead.  Nobody felt the need to be polite to a Polilla, but otherwise they were perceived in roughly the same way as Mariposa by people who were ignorant of the difference. Which apparently encompassed most people.
“I changed to Anafranil months ago,” Castiel replied coolly.
“I apologize.”
After a moment of consideration, Castiel concurred. “I believe that I would prefer you to perish in Moondoor should the regrettable situation occur. The prospect of it occurring in this world would be unwelcome to me.”
“Salted Caramel and Sour Apple. A personable blonde lady just assured me this ‘wackadoo’ flavor is a town favorite.”
Cas growled. Benny turned the same puce color as Viktor. Dean whistled in happy victory and led his three companions to their inevitable fate.
Who hell thought it was FUN to feel actual, physical, sickening pain just to play a goddamned game? No salary was worth this kind of shit.
Castiel smelled him approaching before he heard him.
He got no respect at all, these days.

Fine. He would cut the whelp’s leg off himself.  After he’d done that, his pack would have no choice except to support his decision to mate with Dean because there would be no going back.
“The fact the owner is insisting that the winning contractor lives permanently in the house, alone, until the project’s completion can’t be much of a selling point to the average Joe,” Dean pointed out, pressing his advantage.
“Huh?” the V.I. responded.
The file said something different. It painted the truth a totally different color.

Which very quickly put an end to the celebration, although it inspired Crowley to summon another bottle of scotch from one of his minions.
Except for Dean.

He had barely been parked an hour before there had been a light but insistent tapping on his window by the town Sheriff, followed by an amiable interrogation as to why he was just sitting there in his car. Fortunately he’d anticipated such an event. He’d stiffly announced his prepared story that he was a writer and required some background characters for fleshing out his latest novel, so he simply planned to take notes regarding the various town visitors that day.

Jimmy didn’t.
He had tuna to purchase and a Pizza restaurant to track down.
Sam groaned as he remembered that the security for the building had been ‘helpfully’ provided by RRE.  He’d always thought the access system was completely over-the-top for a Law Firm but when he’d questioned it he’d been told it had been given for free in exchange for the Firm agreeing to ‘Beta-test’ its effectiveness. What if the entire system had actually been provided by RRE just so
By the time he had tracked down a firm in Bangor who promised to deliver several extra units by early afternoon, it was gone noon. The primary consequence of which was that he missed Stephen King entirely. The writer had graciously stayed and signed autographs for a couple of hours after opening the festival, but left long before Dean managed to solve the toilet issue.
Nigel never really understood Donald. He didn't share his passionate desire for wealth and success. He wasn't particularly motivated by worldly rewards. He was perfectly content with achieving his small detatched house, his plump but pretty wife, his 2.2 kids, his golden retriever and two matching station wagons. Nigel Roman's boring, but happy, existence was rocked on its axis only by one single grain of contention that constantly grated against his otherwise perfectly ordered life.

Conversing with whales, it turned out, was exhausting. A conversation that would take minutes between Mer took literal hours when one of the speakers was a whale. It seemed no word was ever uttered without careful consideration and whilst that was helpful in avoiding misunderstandings, it was immensely time-consuming.

“I have stage three cancer,” he replied. “I’m not ashamed of that, either, but it’s often considered a taboo subject by other people.”
She turned to Sam and Gabriel as they too emerged from the black behemoth. “You two get inside and distract James.  Dean, come with me. We need to talk.”
Not just because the stakes were far higher but because the fear of stripping himself down to raw, naked vulnerability was real. The wounds he might suffer would be more potentially dangerous to him than those any bullet or knife might inflict.
“Fuck that,” Dean spat.
He was so conscious of his guilt, all of his guilt; of the loud banging of his heart in his chest; of the slow drip of perspiration down his spine, that he found himself outside of the building before he even realized he had made it past security unchallenged.

“And I know Castiel doesn’t want you to leave,” Kali added. “Which is the only reason that I bothered preventing your premature escape. Well, that and the tuna. I have a surprisingly soft spot for the little leveret. He’s still young enough to naively dream of happy endings.”
“He’s a level 64 player,” Dean replied steadily, hoping the blood rushing to his cheeks wasn’t obvious. “It would be stupid to ignore that kind of asset. That’s all.”
Flashing some flesh definitely seemed a move in the right direction though.
“I don’t believe ‘army’ is the correct collective noun for Demons,” Jimmy interjected helpfully.

Yes, Dean was a charmer. Was the charmer. The one Mer whose soul somehow shone so brightly that none could withstand the power of its righteousness. He could see how, one by one, the leaders of all the clans would fall beneath the spell of Castiel’s truemate.
puke now?”
Something crackled in the air, something dark and wild like the ozone of a storm. An electric, charged sensation like the instant before lightning struck. And some instinct caused him to drop his head, squeezing his sore eyes tightly shut even as the unnatural blackness was abruptly painted with an explosion of light so brightly white that it was almost blue. It was as though an atomic bomb exploded around him. Even with his eyes shut, the light still seemed to sear into him. He felt it ripping through his body like a fireball and, for a moment, believed he was being immolated.
“There are tunnels under the City, paths carved eons ago by the volcanoes that formed this region. I found them marked on a map in the cave of the Sea-witch. No one else seems to remember they exist,” Castiel explained carefully.
“You sure about that?” Ash asked quietly, nodding at the short sword in Dean’s hand.
A scared part.
“I knew it,” Dean breathed.

Ash crossed the square to where a larger structure displayed the sign of an Inn. It only took him a moment to confirm that the Inn, too, was deserted.
The matriarch turned to aid the fallen cow, but found herself face to face with the snarling face of the huge black Alpha wolf. She charged it once, using her head to impact it, to bowl it off its feet, but even as it was knocked aside, whimpering at the pain of its shattered rib cage, its fangs sank into her cheek, ripping flesh, and now she was bleeding from two places and, in the distance, she could hear the lowing moans of her herd, could see the helpless thrashing of the old cow under the savage attack of the white wolf.

It was none of his business, he told himself, as he set off towards the Festival grounds a little after 5am.
There had to be something she could do other than simply warn Dey’hahn to be careful. Even that would be pointless, anyway. Dey’hahn, leaving Infernum alone, would automatically be careful. He’d rush as quickly as possible to the safety of the boarding house whether she told him to or not. But it had been hours since the Dominant had left the club. Enough time for him to lay any number of traps in the narrow alleys behind Infernum.

“What do you call three?” Charlie asked soberly.
And, sometimes, if he performed it
“What is?”
The last few weeks of her life were the first time in three years that Castiel did not sneak out of the palace every day to meet with Dean. Instead, he spent every spare minute at Naomi’s side. He was still too young to fully comprehend what death meant, but he knew his time with his mother was limited and understood the need to create whatever memories of her he could before she was stolen away.
“I am not collaring the damned cat.”
Which was, apparently, the drug that made witches believe they could ‘fly’.
"No it isn't. It's a game reversion," Dean told her, grimly. "This isn't something new, it's something fifteen years old and it's come back by itself. I

Though hadn’t his mother claimed that homosexuality was a perversion precisely because of the supposed inability of gay men to commit to monogamous relationships? He had believed her comment had been a fiction born of ignorance but, if it was true, perhaps Castiel would be better suited to become a monk after all.
Arterial blood spurted out, drenching both him and Cain, but that wasn’t what caused Dean to stumble backward in panic.  It was the two hundred levels of power surging out of Abaddon’s body and into Cain’s that made him run backward, reaching out mentally to snatch up Benny and Meg and stuff them in his inventory, to yell “Poughkeepsie” at the top of his voice.
His balls felt so tight they might rip, burst like fruit under the weight of Cas and the pressure of his need, and he could feel his cock beginning to weep salty, sticky tears onto the side of Cas’s larger shaft, could smell his own arousal. Hot, sharp, musky,

, yadda, yadda," Dean began to get a picture of what awaited them. He eventually realized they were going to be staying in a vacation cabin, rather than an actual hotel; that it was near a place called Defiance, well out of St Louis itself and nowhere near the Mississippi river (because Cas was a lying liar who lied) but that the cabin had nearly fifty acres of private woods and fields

And fortunately Dean understood what he meant, because his eyes sparked gold with acceptance rather than rage. He didn’t misunderstand the statement as a denial. He accepted it as a benediction.
And he no more believed that the aggressive Dom had simply given up and gone home than he believed Michael had simply woken up, shrugged, and gotten on with his life without him eighteen months earlier.
“We all worked together,” Dean protested. “That was the whole point. We worked as a team, Sam.”
“I really, really hate myself for saying what I’m about to say,” Charlie groaned. “But maybe you should cut your leave short after all. The sooner Dean leaves Tsaluna the better. Or at least let’s get Dean onboard your ship. It’s considered sovereign Novian territory, isn’t it?  Federal Law stops applying to him the minute he enters your bulkhead.”

“Sit back down and I’ll tell you,” Charlie replied, not even flinching at being face to face with a scared, angry rank 2 demonic boss.  “Spell the door, Ash,” she added over her shoulder. “This is going to take some time and I don’t want anyone walking in on us.”
“Suits are better for concealing weapons,” Cas argued.
“With damned good reason,” Castiel said staunchly. “His self-protective camouflage is understandable and justifiable. I will never condemn him for his deception. If anything, I applaud him for his ability to so ably conceal himself. His minor deceits are totally necessary for his own survival.”
Charlie grinned unrepentantly. “You’ll find Heron’s Cove is a place where you’ll acquire what you need, rather than what you think you want. It’s a thing. We don’t question it. Stay here long enough and I guarantee we’ll peel you like an overripe banana.”
And it was red, red, red, like volcanic fire, blasting, burning, blazing as it enveloped him with eager, greedy hunger. Searing into him with a howling scream of need, of want, of love and loss, of heartbreak and forgiveness. Forgiveness. So much forgiveness.
“You undoubtedly already know you can’t log out,” Crowley continued, with a self-satisfied smirk, “but if you’re thinking of porting… well, remember that moment just before you blink out of one place to another? That little fraction of time when your whole body, well,

He stormed out of the room, not even looking to see whether Jimmy followed.
And he sat there, chewing toast, drinking coffee, eating the breakfast made for him by an actual god, as a blue-eyed, chocolate brown rabbit joined the lazy fur pile on the bottom of the bed, and he wondered what the fuck he’d ever done to deserve feeling so damned happy.
He could do this.
Dean, honestly, had no issue whatsoever with the
Castiel’s eyes remained icily unimpressed.
“We’re picking up a long-range distress call,” the comms officer said. Considering the crew were effectively just mercenaries for hire these days, Castiel appreciated the fact they still performed with the same efficient discipline as they had before they had been made redundant when the planet that Bantaegan had been at war with for several centuries had accidentally immolated itself whilst testing a new form of nuclear weapon.
Dean always forgave him.  It was just the way Dean was. Sometimes Sam wondered whether it was Dean’s willingness to forgive that lay at the heart of Sam’s continued transgressions. Maybe he would be better at learning not to put his foot in his mouth if Dean was less willing to forgive him for it.
anything.”
.  Which said it all, didn’t it?
So he turned, without warning, and made a sudden break for it. He ran towards the tree line, heading for the path, heading for the way back to the cove, not looking back, refusing to look back even though, in his imagination, he envisaged some huge, dark malevolent shadow rising up from the house in pursuit of him.
But the Destiny Stone was not driving him to the Wildlings, it was leading him to Dean.

Winchesters were total eye-candy who could make a small fortune as cover-models - she was gay, not blind - she was vaguely disappointed to personally think Sam was the ‘prettier’ of the two, for all his Alpha muscle.
"It has occurred to me that the converse is true too," Cas said.
Before adding, “And you owe me new lingerie, you fucker.”
“An internment camp?” Dean demanded incredulously. “I’m a Federal Citizen. I have a perfect right to live freely on any Alliance Planet and I have sufficient credits to procure legitimate food and accommodation while I seek work, however long it takes.”

For a long moment, the god continued to stare at him, his blue gaze seeming to bore inside Dean’s head and eviscerate his every thought.  Then slowly, as though the expression was totally unfamiliar, his lips twisted into a genuine smile.
“Not ‘reset’, exactly,” Loki corrected. “They simply will not share the same equivalence as post darkness characters such as yourself.”

He had never, in his entire life, experienced anything as addictively satisfying as fulfilling the needs of his Subplex. It had been astonishing how Dean’s pheromones had guided him to a flawless performance. It had been close to ‘mind-reading’, considering how graphically Dey’n’s pheromones had signposted his mercurial mood. With the faint buffer of the blockers assuring Castiel he wouldn’t actually lose control if he gave in to his instincts, he had followed the lead of Dey’n’s ever-changing pheromonal emissions. He had allowed each fractional change of ‘scent’ to let him know when Dey’n needed more or less, when Dey’n was close to losing control, when Dey’n would explode with frustration if forced to wait even a second longer. When, despite Dey’n’s verbal protests to the contrary, the Mariposa was
But truthfully, he’s only one rank higher than Dean at the moment. We can still pull this one back.”
“You’re saying it’s too small to take him over?” Jimmy queried.
Bobby harrumphed, his nose wrinkling into a sneer. “That’s all you’ve got? And there I was thinkin’ you Russkie wolves were supposed to be shit-hot at trackin’ down information.”
And that was when he realized the tiny girl pup was not on the deck of the ship. Only three humans remained of the original four and, from their behavior and their cries, it was obvious that the pup had, somehow, fallen from the vessel and been lost to the sea.
”Exactly,” Cas agreed. “Being isolationists  who are rumoured to be ‘mafia’ or ‘drug barons’ draws attention of the authorities - who are controllable - but the general human population are fearful, respectful and stay out of our business,” he said.  “It’s another reason we find it easier to be seen as ‘criminals’. Fear fosters privacy.  By attempting legitimacy, Voji lost that protection and inadvertently cast a spotlight on the pack just by

It began with the arrival of an unfamiliar mature biological Dominant to the club a couple of hours after it opened.  Meg had been left in no doubt whatsoever about his designation because he had prowled into the bar as though he owned it, sweeping through the groups of students with a cocky, dangerous stride.  She had seen several of the younger Qui hastily step out of his way, their eyes dropping in either fear or respect as he strutted through their midst with an arrogance so ingrained that she instantly realized the new arrival was not only designate but was also High Qui.
“Because you need to be a level ten Boss to fight the Darkness,” Loki whispered.
walking away. This is me, stopping the crazy-train, climbing off and saying sayonara and goodnight.”
Perhaps Dean had no memory of being sacrificed at eleven months old but the pack’s memory of that event was fresh and often vocalized.  As was Samuel’s second attempt when he was six.
Castiel didn’t want to meet Sam to show
Had he realized the performance of ‘paintball’ required the donning of ‘fancy dress’ he would never have consented to the idea.

Gabriel shrugged sadly. “He might choose not to come,” he agreed. “He might not believe you really want him to. Or the post-bond depression he’s suffering might make him incapable of responding positively anyway. But that’s on him too. Breaking the bond was
Of course you don’t, Castiel thought. But that was the point. Logistically, by the time Dey’n learned the truth, it would be too late. There would be no physical way for he and Dey’n to reunite in time to prevent the rejected bond from killing Castiel.
“And do you consider Umami bad?” Castiel demanded suspiciously, unsure whether he’d just been insulted.
He wasn’t even sure that the Wolfkin truly understood he was not Creiche when they were so lost to their wolves.  Even his mother had little time or patience for him then, as liable to greet him with a snarl as any of the other pack members, so he spent almost all day, every day, with his tiny brother.
This, Castiel decided, was why living in a town with only four hundred people was a bad thing. Because he could walk into a store to buy a simple pie and be given a lecture on how it would be a good idea to offer his virginity to the local lothario who just happened to be his next door neighbor, apparently.
as her older ‘brother’.
then I sure as hell would stand as a witness that he demonstrates completely human characteristics. Not necessarily all ‘good’ characteristics but so what? We don’t say people only have the right to life if they act like Mother Teresa, do we? I'm all for supporting the idea that any 'person' with demonstrable self-awareness should attain legal protections.
Jimmy pondered that, worrying at his lower lip at the unspoken implications inside Castiel’s words. “
“It’s an old mine shaft, I think,” Charlie told him, as he turned to face her. “Quartzite probably, given the region, rather than gold.”
”Poor Deanna,” Bobby sighed. “She had no idea. And Henry... oh my God. This means if Henry had run to the Volkrod, to your Daddy, in 1980, then both he and John would have been protected.”
Sadly, she was beginning to believe that Frank Devereaux was possibly better.
Dean shrugged. “I just can’t figure him out. As you’ve already pointed out, every Wednesday he brings a pie to the store, eats it with me, and leaves. Since the first time, when he mentioned Atticat, we don’t even discuss anything remotely personal. We eat pie, then he tells me about a book he’s read, or his plans for his garden, or, more usually, he just sits and listens to me bawling people out on the phone for a while like he’s totally fascinated, and then he goes home, disappears into his house and that’s it until the next Wednesday.”
healthy.
Such a terrible business.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “He’s talking to you?”
“If we can survive long enough to reach her,” Ash pointed out, as the rest of the pack closed in around them.
Dean woke with the memory of shifting. With the memory of fur white as snow. With the understanding that ‘Omega’ had not been meant as an insult. With the totally improbable, impossible realization that the reason Samuel was under attack was that he had allowed
They probably would have been equally confused by his physical appearance in the game.
She scowled at him. “You’re cheating,” she declared. “You’re having assistance from other players. You’re even in a Guild. I’ll report you. Get you kicked out of the game. You can’t
But if the Razer sales guy was right, RRE was presumably locking the majority of people who played Moondoor into long-term utility contracts even if they only played the game once and decided it wasn’t their ‘thing’. Because the power was off-grid and the broadband was cable, both required totally new connections to be laid so the ‘ten-year’ was a complete misnomer anyway. The odds of anyone ever leaving RRE Power to return to standard grid-connection was highly improbable.
“Whilst Dean is easily aroused to anger, I do not believe his actions stemmed from rage,” Castiel replied coolly.
Bobby sighed and rolled his eyes at Garth. “I just finished tellin’ Dean he was allowed to punch anyone he liked. Try not to be the first one he gets tempted to test the theory on.” As Garth flinched away, looking alarmed, Bobby turned his attention fully on Dean. “Despite the way that sounded, we ain’t looking to use you as some kind of guinea pig. But there’s no arguing the fact that if a ‘normal’ biological sub/dom connection resonates at a similar frequency as that of the Novian crystals, an actual sub/Prae bond might be even more effective.”
Gabriel’s presence inside Sam’s head didn’t offer Dean much comfort. Whatever goddamned level ‘Sabriel’ was, courtesy of the onboard Angel, he was still just 9lbs of cat facing a dozen Hell Hounds the size of mastiffs, which was a recipe for disaster that Dean was certain would inevitably end in Sam getting ripped to shreds by the beasts.
“Yeah, let’s try to avoid the whole Evil Twink scenario if we can help it,” Crowley said. “Vibe is bad enough around here already without you going all Chucky on our asses.”
Because a ‘shootout’ was simply the term for booking a self-driving experience of fifteen laps of the Bethel Motor Speedway track.
“Too much,” Gabriel complained. “That’s my point. You have a habit of locking your front door and literally disappearing for weeks at a time. It’s not healthy. Most kids aspire to be firemen or astronauts. You clearly decided you wanted to grow up to be Richard Neville.”
Which possibly seemed counter-intuitive except that in the fiery sea of electric fields that formed the game engine of Moondoor, Castiel, like all Angels, surfed through the tempestuous waters as a narrow wave, cutting through like a shark’s fin, his shape and size perfectly designed to limit velocity drift so that he could move, literally, at the speed of light.
“Dunno, Man,” Ash replied thoughtfully. “It’s a chicken and egg thing, maybe. I mean we all come across real assholes in the game and just assume they are dicks in Moondoor because they are dicks in RL.  Maybe, well, maybe it works both ways. Maybe being a dick in Moondoor makes you more dickish in RL?  I mean, unless you’re Bi-polar, there has to be bleed over in both directions. Dunno. Either way, it makes it all the more important that you get your ass out of there ASAP.
He’d once watched Watership Down, after all.

Gabriel couldn’t imagine
Somehow, satisfying his peculiar cravings eased his terrible aches briefly. Maybe, he thought, just because a stomach filled with soil or ice was still better than an

The Reaper shrugged. “All that is now required is for both Cain and Amara to leave Moondoor and return

, but he knew exactly when to push his luck and when to err on the side of caution.
“That sucks,” Dean commiserated. “So spending lots of time in Purgatory, huh?”
“Maybe he doesn’t expect you to call his bluff,” Castiel suggested.
Castiel shrugged. “I did not have the necessary context to translate love into sexual desire. Now I am residing within Jimmy’s flesh, I have been suddenly educated.” He deliberately ground Jimmy’s groin against Dean’s. “See?” He said, with satisfaction. “I now know how it
“Sneer all you like. Whether you have a problem with my morals or not, ‘Hell’ is perfectly legal.”

When Dean was born nobody had given a damn what
He sniffed the air. Even in human form, all Wolfkin had senses far beyond those of the Dobycha but, as an Alpha, Castiel’s abilities far exceeded those of any Beta wolves.  “There is only one Dobycha here. Inside the house itself. His heartbeat indicates he is aware of our arrival. He is alarmed by our presence, but not so much that he is mindless with panic,” he told his bodyguards.
”But it still involves water. Becoming ‘drenched’,” Cas scowled.

“So why are you still using the wheelchair?” Sam demanded.
