“Then you have to--”
“Dean.”
It brought him to the stars with Cas in his arms, and for that, he will always be indebted to the cosmos.
They part as the music fades, and Dean pulls Cas with him as he lays back, settling on the windshield. He settles a hand behind his head and keeps an arm around Cas.
Castiel.
“What are we doing here?” Cas asks.
Dean looks down at the jacket in his hand, folded neatly.  His tear-filled eyes are fixed on the bloody handprint wrapped around the left shoulder, and he nearly chokes on a sob as he remembers that moment.  Remembers the look in Cas’s eyes.  Remembers the feeling of Cas telling him he loved Dean.
Cas looks down at himself, his fingers trailing the lapel of the coat.  He hesitates a moment before shrugging out of it, and the suit jacket.  He drapes them carefully over the back of Dean’s chair, then bends to pick up Dean’s, giving it the same treatment.  Watching it makes Dean’s heart ache.
With a huff, Dean’s eyes widen. “You’re kidding me, right? That’s not what I’m saying. I’m just saying, situations like you and me ain’t that common and it’s not all that welcome sometimes.”
Dean swallows, and Cas leans in. “You, Dean. You are my other half. And we will always find our way back to one another.”
Fuck, he misses him.  He misses everything about him.  He misses telling Cas jokes that land like a fucking brick in front of him.  He misses the tie that’s always askew.  He misses that mess of hair.  He misses those eyes Dean can, and often has, get lost in.  He misses that trench coat.  He misses Cas, plain and simple.  And while he feels calm and peaceful here… it does feel like a piece of him is missing.  It’s probably not supposed to.  Not here.  But it does.
“I do.”  Dean takes a step forward, and inhales sharply.  “God, Cas, I do fucking care!”
Cas tilts his head, and Dean feels that ache of affection.  “What?”
”  His voice grows louder, and he’s out of key, but Cas doesn’t seem to mind.  In fact, he’s smiling.  And anything that makes Cas smile is a win in Dean’s book.  He turns the Impala down a dirt road and glances at Cas, singing louder.  “
“Yes, Dean, I got that.”
“What?”
Dean persists, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth.  “Been a long time since we were alone.”  He casts his eyes upward for a moment, as if trying to do the math in his head.  “Matter of fact, I can’t even remember the last time.”
Dean had felt sick.  “Don’t do this, Cas.”  Behind him, he heard the Empty, and he had wanted nothing more than to throw up.  To grab Cas, drag him somewhere safe, and figure this shit out.  Tears filled his eyes when he’d realized it was the end.  When he realized there was no way out of this.  “Cas--”
Cas lifts his eyes to the ceiling of the porch, as if the answer to Dean’s outburst is written there.  “I still don’t underst--”
Dean has half a mind to let it go, let Cas walk right on by, but as their shoulders nearly brush each other, Dean scrubs a hand over his mouth and swears to himself.  He stops a few paces away and closes his eyes. “Cas.”  He’s not even sure Cas hears him until Dean hears the quiet clacking of his soles on the tile stop.  Dean drops his hand and turns, finding Cas watching him, one eyebrow raised expectantly.
“Are real,” Dean finishes with another kiss.  Closing his eyes, he rests his forehead against Cas’s and tilts his mouth away.  “If this ain’t, Cas, I--”  He presses his lips together and huffs.  “I can’t.  I can’t do it.  I can’t lose you, too.  I can’t let--”
, he tells himself when Cas brushes back his sweat-damp hair and presses a kiss to his forehead.
He wrangles his other hand out of his pocket and grasps the back of Cas’s head, pressing their foreheads together when he’s close enough.  He doesn’t give Cas to speak first.  “Just-- shut up.”  These moments are usually reserved for complete solitude -- Sam snoozing away down the hall or in the other motel room; nights in the Impala when Sam’s off doing research.  Moments just for each other, under the cover of secrecy.  Not in the hallway of a highschool with a whole town worth of people a coupla hundred feet away.
“Dean…”
God, Dean’s missed that sense of humor. Hell, he’s missed Cas, plain and simple. “Shut up and get over here.” As he stands, Cas smirks, and Dean doesn’t even bother hiding his smile. A smile of any degree from Cas is almost as good as a hot cup of coffee. It makes him feel warm. Comfortable.
“Together,” Dean repeats.  He wants to believe so badly.  He wants so many things.  He just
He spends the night alone with little sleep. The sun rises, and with it dawns the realization that if Dean doesn’t figure his shit out and change his ways, he could lose Cas for good. Not to peril or death. But to a choice — one that, Dean knows — will hurt worse than death.
… This is something else.  This is what he’s been searching for his whole life.  Kill after kill, conquest after conquest… it’s never made him feel like this.
.  He doesn’t want to think about that. He doesn’t want to think of blinding blue lights or scorched wings. He
…”  He licks his lips, his eyes searching Dean’s, and Dean wants to cry.
Waking to Cas in his bed is, undoubtedly, the best thing that’s ever happened to him in his whole miserable existence. Forty goddamn years of misery and pain, and Dean finally has what he wants.  In quiet, private moments, he doesn’t hold himself back. He kisses Cas like there won’t be a tomorrow. He worships Cas — every inch of him. Like Dean was man stranded in a desert, Cas is an oasis quenching a longstanding thirst.
He sees it then, the hurt in Cas’s eyes. Dean’s struck a nerve. “So you’d prefer if my vessel were female?”
“Your…” Cas pauses and looks away when he licks his lips.  Dean’s eyes follow the movement, and he silently kicks himself for it.  His gaze snaps up to Cas’s when Cas turns to look at him again.  “Crisis of faith.”
Dean has to believe they’ll find their way back to each other. As if the cosmos paved the road just for them, they always find their way back.
“Dean…” The chair is relieved when Dean sits upright. Cas stands up straighter and squares his shoulders in defiance. “There’s no need to be like that—“
Sam mentioned the tension only once, and when met with Dean’s angry response, he says nothing on the subject again.
is.  I believed it years ago, and I believe it now.”
Dean narrows his eyes and pushes off the bed. He’s pacing, scrubbing a hand over his face. “So you’re pissed because, what? I don’t hold your hand in public? Throw myself at you? In case you missed the memo, Cas, we’re both dudes.”
Dean leans in, his forehead bumping against Cas’s.  He closes his eyes and they just breathe for a moment.  Savoring each other.  Breathing each other in.  “Damn it, Cas,” he whispers.  He draws a cleansing breath and exhales, forcing himself to pull away.  He brought Cas here for a reason, and if he doesn’t pull back now, they’re never going to make it out of the car.  “C’mon.”  He doesn’t wait for a response before he climbs out, the door squeaking in quiet night.  Cas joins him, following Dean’s lead as they round the front end.
Closing his eyes for a moment, tears slip down his temples.  “Fuck,” Dean whispers.  Swiping at the tears, he pulls Cas in, their lips crashing together.  Shifting, he flips them over and haphazardly works a hand between them to get Cas’s pants open.  He’s still tipsy and sloppy but he doesn’t care.  He’s got Cas.  He’s kissing Cas.  He’s got his hands on Cas, and he’s going to take all he can get.  He’s harder than he’s ever been, the thinks, and aching to be freed from his boxer briefs, but he focuses on Cas.  On his need to make it up to him.  Dean’s never been good at words or apologies, but sex… sex he could do; even in this new territory.
“Okay,” Sam says.  “Okay.  But, uh, I’m beat.  So…”
Cas doesn’t seem to bristle at Dean’s attitude.  He’s used to it by now.  Instead, he pushes forward and settles on the empty cot opposite Dean.  Sam’s taking watch, so it’ll be abandoned for a few more hours, at least.  Cas seems to know this when he shrugs out of his trench coat.  He’s still watching Dean, but he doesn’t speak.
Dean falls asleep that night with his chest pressed flush to Cas’s back, his arm wrapped firmly around the angel.  He knows Cas doesn’t need to sleep, but he’s grateful for the pretense.  Because he craves the intimacy, the normalcy, the pure elation he feels in getting to hold Cas in his arms after… well,
Sam’s mouth thins out, and he huffs through his nose.  Dean has half a mind to poke the festering bullet wound in Sam’s shoulder as payback for this conversation.  “You think Cas wanted any of this to happen?  You think Cas thought--”
Cas’s lips press against the side of his head, and Dean breathes in deep.  “It’s a start.”
Dean sets his cup down and exhales slowly. Cas is watching him, waiting patiently. Always waiting, that one. Always. Licking his lips, he nods to the empty cushions beside him on the couch. “I don’t bite.”
But he’s struck with the sudden realization:  it’s not there.  All he feels is calm and peace.  Something he’s never really known.
’ He sits up, returning his hand to Cas’s hair. He can’t get enough of it. “When I first met you, you were here for a purpose. You were… guiding me, or whatever, toward the endgame. You were the quarterback and I was your running back.”
And so, in lieu of sleep, he pushes Cas back against the door and sets about on his mission to feel.  To feel like this is real.  To feel like Cas is real.  To just fucking feel something other than rage and hatred and exhaustion.
Swallowing as he heaves a breath to calm himself, Dean closes his eyes and leans in to press his forehead to Cas’s.  He lifts his hands, pushing his fingers into Cas’s hair.  “Had a dream you were still gone.  Fuckin’ nightmare.  Sam ‘n’ I just… didn’t care.  Didn’t try to bring you back.”  He doesn’t realize he’s crying until Cas wipes away his tears.  “I’m so sorry.”
Happiness… he had kept talking about happiness.  Not in the
The buzzing is incessant, but Dean can’t focus.  He can hardly hear anything but his pounding heart and the sounds of his own sobs.
He stops when Cas’s hand settles on his jaw. “Dean,” he says, and it’s low and gravelly. The voice that always sends chills down Dean’s spine. “I’m fine because I’m here. I’m with you.”
Sam barely looks up, and shakes his head. “Not really. A few possible leads, but this is turning into one of those ‘could be anything’ cases.”
Because life without Cas is Hell, but he knows the only Heaven he’ll be sent to; the only one he wants is one in which he’s with his angel.  Until then, he’ll hold on for dear life yo the time he has with him now… to the life they’ve finally been afforded together.
“Yeah,” Dean huffs, his eyes dragging over Cas’s face.  “Me, neither.”
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice.  He’s spent years denying it.  He’s spent years beating himself up over it.  But he’s done.  He’s lost Cas too many times, but he finally has him, and he’s not gonna fucking let go.
“At all of it.  At Jack, at Chuck, at--”
Dean gasps, trying to catch the wind that’s been knocked out of him, and those stubborn tears spill down his cheeks.  Cas wipes them away with his thumbs.  He wants, so fucking desperately to believe that.  That this, Cas, these feelings, are real.  But after everything… he doesn’t know-- “How?”
“We’re here. We’re queer. Get used to it,” Cas snaps back good naturedly.
“Yeah, fine, whatever, the only angel’s opinion that matters to me is yours.”
“Yeah, I mean a good chunk of the ones here think of me as the slut that corrupted you, or they’re, you know, dead,” he says with a shrug.
Castiel smirks. He’s yet to see anyone succeed in such a venture, but maybe, this human will manage it. He’ll enjoy the show no matter the outcome. Crowley watches him watch Aziraphale and smirks himself.
Cas shoots him a suspicious glance, sensing the insincerity of his words. Fortunately, unlike him, his angel is good at letting things go. He shrugs it off and hopes for the best.
“I told you his brain was scrambled so I unscrambled it. Salvaged the important bits and wiped the rest clean. Voila, good as new,” Lucifer says right in front of Cas who barely blinks in acknowledgement as if this is old news to him, like he doesn’t care.
“I can’t trust anything you say right now.”
“Lucifer no, he already has an alcohol problem. I don’t want him developing another dependency.”
He offers his hand to the devil to make a deal of sorts. Lucifer’s eyes widen, catching the significance of the gesture. He takes the offer, and the contract is sealed.
“Shouldn’t you be singing to a bunch of drunk people right about now, Casanova?”
“Let’s have a few sessions with Linda before you meet my brother. I worried you’ll end up spiraling and as much as he dislikes you, not even Lucifer would wish that upon you.”
“Of course, Dean. I love you.”
“Let’s just hope he’s not evil there,” he mutters.
“There’s my Righteous Man,” he says as he opens the portal to the devil’s playground.
Lucifer looks just as thrown as he feels. He raises his hands up in surrender, especially when Sam gives him a disapproving look.
“Good, I’ll need some time to prepare mine.”
“And you didn’t think to get us a room?” he bites back sarcastically.
Charlie starts fussing, and he hands the kid over to Amenadiel. He instantly shushes, but Dean stubbornly refuses to read into it.
That’s all it takes for the damn to break, and tears start spilling from his eyes like he’s the overly-emotional romantic lead in a love story from those rom-coms he would always make fun of but secretly enjoyed. In those stories, you get a guaranteed happy ending, and your communication issues with your future partner are solved before the hour and a half movie is over after you break it off with your conveniently terrible fiancé.
“You seem to be under the false impression that this universe revolves around you. It does not. If you’re so desperate to be the center of attention again, go back home,” the devil says, jabbing a finger into his chest. The red eyed monster is inches from his face and practically breathes on him in disgust.
"That’s the spirit. Go get your pie loving simpleton, and if he decides to give Earth another spin, tell him to get a tetanus shot for Dad’s sake.”
“Hey Lucy, quick question, how long does it take for a human’s celestial brain rot to wear off?”
Too close, too close, always too close to him. Why did the goddamn liar have to prove the angel dicks right about that?
Cas doesn’t try to explain. In fact, he gets kind of broody like he’s wondering the same thing. Dean wrings his hands, working up the nerve to say something. He can’t put off explaining himself any longer. His angel deserves to know he was way out of Dean’s league in every way.
It’s clear whose side he’s on, but it’s also clear that Crowley is speaking from experience. With that in mind, Castiel decides to heed his advice. He nods solemnly and takes another sip of tea. It’s gone cold. Aziraphale instantly warms it up for him.
Cas packs so much meaning into his name. It oozes with frustration, worry, and utter devotion, and Dean can’t take it. He needs the angel to understand that he’s not father material.
“So, what’s for dinner?”
Cas smiles as he looks into Crowley’s gorgeous reptilian eyes, familiar enough with the subtle signals Dean tended to use to know the significance of the gesture. He decides then and there to spend a few weeks with his brother and life partner before returning home. It’s been a while since he’s spent more than a few hours with them, not since . . . Jack.
“I can control myself, Cas. Believe me.”
“I don’t think I would have hated a baby,” he murmurs.
Lucifer smiles at him for the first time, and he becomes uncomfortably aware the devil is attractive.
"You monster."
“I wanted to see you again,” Cas murmurs.
Cas hugs him, and yeah, he’s definitely not used to unrestrained displays of affection yet.
“Lucy, he meant it as a compliment,” Cas says tiredly.
“I can handle the Empty if I encounter it again.” He doesn’t expect to.
“Their twins.”
Cas slices at Michael again, but the blow doesn’t land, and the archangel’s divine strength allows him to easily overpower his mysteriously depowered angel. He wrestles the angel blade out of Cas’s hand and plunges it into his abdomen.
Lucifer’s mood immediately drops, but surprisingly, he’s simply resigned instead of livid.
“Thank you Lucy,” Cas says, practically beaming.
Dean suddenly feels inadequate and insanely jealous, but his brain helpfully reminds him that he has a title of his own.
Dean desperately wants to be wrong about this. So, he ends up asking a question he probably doesn’t want the answer to.
Castiel cuts through time and space without even thinking about it. For once in his life, he wants to be as far away from Dean as possible. The man is impossibly stubborn and refuses to be happy. This is starting to frustrate him. Of course, he has no illusions about Dean. He’s always known that the man isn’t perfect. The moment he’d touched his soul he’d learned everything there is to know about Dean Winchester, flaws and all. He’d still fallen for him hard, metaphorically and literally. Even so, now that there is nothing in their way, his reluctance to compromise even a little is testing his already frayed patience.
“Close your eyes and keep your hands around my neck,” Cas says.
Lucifer's expression becomes unbelievably soft, and he raises his glass to make a toast.
“Fair, but hypothetically, when would you like to get married? Like a date?” Dean says because if Cas thinks he’s not giving Sam a heads up about this just in case he has another thing coming.
“Castiel, I say this with love. You can’t keep stealing children, willy nilly.”
He’s rewarded with a kiss.
Cas jumps when he tries to touch them. Okay, so, he can’t feel them this way, but his angel sure can, interesting. He likes the way wings work here, less burny, more fluffy. Getting a rise out of Cas is also a nice bonus. Emboldened, he invades Cas’s personal space and lightly strokes his invisible wings, quietly assessing where he’s most sensitive.
“This man didn’t think you were capable of love. I don’t understand your devotion to him.”
Dean is not sure if the bone chilling deep eldritch voice that comes out of Cas’s mouth is real or if the angel mojo is making him insane. Michael surprisingly isn’t shaking in his boots despite his initial hesitation. No, instead, he seems worryingly gleeful like Cas has just fed him more ammunition.
“It pains me how little you believe in yourself.”
“You’re not saying yes right away? Why? I thought you loved me. ”
“You never tried very hard,” he says dismissively.
He pats him on the back and leaves him to his affairs. Cas has a sneaking suspicion he’ll end up breaking into the poor detective’s home tonight to discuss the details of Cas’s love life in person. He shakes his head, silently chuckling to himself. Some people have no sense of personal space.
He guesses that mostly has to do with the fact this isn’t the devil he knows.
Some of the fog in his head dissipates, and he recognizes that was the wrong thing to say. Cas looks guilty as sin, reminded of Michael’s words. So, yeah, having no filter has its downsides, he should probably drop it for now. Maybe, when they get home, they can give it another try. Dean clears his throat.
“I’m sorry, Aziraphale. I did come here because of Dean. He’s being difficult, and I find this world very comforting. I like you two,” he admits shyly.
“Not exactly, I’ve fallen in love . . . with a human. I heard the same had happened to you,” Castiel admits, deciding to leave out the fact that he wouldn’t have bothered to come if he’d know it was Lucifer of all his brothers who had fallen in love with a human.
“Nothing’s wrong with you Dean, but you could benefit with individual visits with Linda. You harbor an absurd amount of hatred for yourself and your crippling abandonment issues could overtime put a strain on our relationship.”
“You,” Michael says, ridiculously pleased at how easy he is to pick apart. This dude might as well be a cartoon super villain come to life with how little he gives a damn about anyone other than himself.
As soon as he steps out of the portal, he kicks himself for having no real plan. This is a terrible idea in every sense of the word. He knows nothing of this world’s rules or the possible evil lurking within. Hell, he’s not even sure which sibling he is looking for. All he really knows is that one of his brother’s is in love with a human and that human loves him back, and he has a vested interest in finding out how it’s going. He licks his lips, thinking of Dean . . . if it’s worth it.
Lucifer grits his teeth. Fist clenched like he’s actively restraining himself from punching back.
“I was less aware of the subtleties of language at the time and thought he was trying to insult me. So I turned back and said ‘What do you want, human? He never tried to use it again.”
He doesn’t stick around after that, disappearing from sight in seconds, traveling much faster on his own now that he doesn’t have to worry about Dean. Cas places a steady hand on his shoulder, and he lets himself relax a little. His angel won’t let him go back to Hell, literally or figuratively.
“He’s an impossibly stubborn, unpredictable pain in my chassis, but-”
“I’m perfectly capable of protecting my little brother, unlike some people. Now, if you excuse me, I have to figure out how to kill a cursed immortal man,” he says as the elevator doors start to close. Dean forces the doors open.
They’re all the same in his book. All he has to do is figure out what sort of fuckery this one is up to and what any of it has to do with Cas. No way the angel he saw on stage is the same one he left in the psych ward. The devil has to have messed with his head somehow. He remembers himself broken and bloody as a cold Castiel holds up a gleaming knife. Dean swallows down his sudden anxiety.
“I love you too.”
“He’ll likely be busy with a case that against all odds will end up being extremely relevant to whatever problem my brother is facing that week and provide him insight that would otherwise go over his head or take years of therapy to work through.”
“I will,” Cas says, giving him a peck on the cheek like it's nothing.
“Uh, Cas, this is the part where you tell me I’m wrong.”
“I want to hear it from you.”
Cas blinks, face carefully neutral.
He wasn’t really expecting a reply as his grumblings weren’t meant for Cas’s ears, but his angel gives a thoughtful answer that he must have had rolling in his head for a while.
“You proposed.”
"And' I'll have the Beef Wellington."
Honestly, his angel didn't start out picky. He could have put an apple and a can of spam in front of him, and Cas would have loved it, simply because he had nothing to compare it too. Dean didn't want to do him dirty like that and introduced him all his favorite foods before . . . well, he didn't like to think about what Cas ate when he was homeless.
“I’m sorry, what?” he asks, only half paying attention. His eyes want to go back to Cas, to his wings. The hunter part of him realizes something's off, but he really can’t help himself.
“By the way, if you want to give the wings a spin in the bedroom, Dean seems to recover faster from angel brain rot than the average joe. He should be fine and dandy for your appointment with Linda tomorrow if you decided to go for it.”
Dean decides this isn’t a battle worth fighting. An angel grace engagement ring is admittedly awesome, and he’s going to be a greedy bastard and accept it.
Dean swallows nervously. He can't deny the angel anything, not anymore, not when he's lost so much for his sake. And you'll never catch him saying it in his universe, but these angels are actually nice if a little strange.
Again, the devil suppresses his worst instincts, biting his tongue for Cas’s sake. He adjusts his cufflinks so he can have a reason to ignore him and collect himself. When he does look up, he gives Dean a tight lipped smile. Super, somehow implying Lucifer deserves better than the whole devil shtick is what sends the dude over the edge. He probably would have been better off punching him again.
Lucifer gives up on procuring alcohol and joins Castiel on the couch, feeling a pinprick of guilt. He’d assumed that the angel would either get over his crush or tell the guy before he was buried six feet under. Leave it to Cassie to take his word as law. The little one was always too serious for his own good.
“Great more competition,” he grumbles.
Cas narrows his eyes, more wing flicks. He vaguely wonders if it’s the bird equivalent of flipping him off.
Dean freezes. It's painfully clear that Cas has omitted some of the things he did during their twelve year slow burn.
“What?”
“I understand your reservations Dean, but Jack deserves a chance to have a childhood.”
“What? No! You’ve gotta come home. You think I’d hop universes for just anyone.”
Dean starts sobbing too, clutching the angel like a lifeline. He didn’t expect to get this emotionally wrecked today, and he regrets not having coffee this morning.
Lucifer’s wings flare up defensively. He studies them, feeling nothing but passive appreciation. They’re pristine and subtly glow with miraculous holy light, but Cas’s wings blow them out of the water in every way, not that he’s biased or anything.
Since his angel up and left him without warning, he feels he should get to go first.
“Why would I want to?”
For once, Lucifer is speechless. He looks down at his empty glass, frowning as if debating whether or not to tell him something. Castiel stays silent, waiting him out. His patience is rewarded.
“Lovely to meet you Dean, ” he adds as an afterthought.
“He doesn’t want to go back to Earth. He wants to stay in Heaven with me. I suggested temporarily removing my grace and joining him but-”
He ends up making out with an angel on the roof. When things start getting hot and heavy, the wings come out unexpectedly, and Dean nearly falls off the building, successfully killing the mood. Cas hides his wings almost immediately after he pulls Dean to safety, and he lets out a strangled frustrated noise. He wants to touch them so badly.
Cas lowered the list and looked at Dean very serious. “I promise I’ll listen to them thoroughly and contemplatively.”
sounded way to fucking personal for a guy he just met. The longer he looked at the outgoing message the more he regretted sending it. Cas was working and he was sending them pictures having fun probably felt like he was just rubbing it in his face. He started a message, tapping out some words before hitting the delete button, trying again only to erase it again. He closed his eyes for a second with a sigh before finally settling on "
That answer on the other hand, was a surprise. Chuck stared at him stunned for a long moment as Dean, too drunk to notice, grabbed his beer and took a few long pulls that would leave it empty.
Just then Meg came up behind Dean as she looked only at Cas, and asked, “ready to go?”
He tapped on the door lightly at first, louder when there was no answer to make sure he could be heard over the music.  “Come in,” he heard a voice call from within before pushing the door open. Inside, Castiel was standing over a desk, looking at a computer monitor and playing with a machine that was making all of the beats he was hearing.  He was surprised to find him in a regular pair of jeans and a plain grey t-shirt.  It made sense that he had on the suit and tie if he was dressing up for the show, but they had looked so good on him that Dean kind of missed them.  He shook his head slightly wondering why that thought penetrated his mind so suddenly.  He didn’t even realize he had been staring openly until Cas finally glanced up, doing a double take as he was so into what he was doing he had already forgotten that he had told someone to enter.  He swatted at the machine making the beat change on accident before finding the right button and turning it off as he had intended to the first time.  After all of the noise, the room and house were suddenly deathly quiet.  “Oh, Dean,” his voice still had that rough edge that was surprising and almost made Dean shiver. “I thought you were Gabe. I’m not sure why though; he still hasn’t learned to knock.”
Christmas. Whatever the hell that meant. “Not everyone is Christian, Dean.” Sam had told him defensively. Dean just couldn’t wrap his head around it. Even people that didn’t celebrate showed up and did family stuff. He gave Sam a break though. There were certainly some sensitive things in his own life that he avoided that reminded him too much of his parents and life before the fire. Who knew what this girls story was that made her so damaged that she couldn't enjoy the best holiday ever.
And that's when he saw him.  The angel that was simply laying on his back staring up at the ceiling, not having even bothered to look Dean's way. Dean got closer for a better look.  With his hands behind his head he looked like he was better fit for lazily lying in the grass in a park, staring up at the clouds.  Relaxed. Not broken. Bored perhaps.  He didn't address the angel, but instead talked directly to the guide as he kept his eyes locked on him. "What can you tell me about this one?"
And that’s how the next days played out.  Sam’s grand tours of the city and hitting his favorite locations were dying down since Dean had seen almost everything. Cas was staying at home working on his music more than leaving the house, and even Gabe was home more now that he only had to be at the club to choreograph and prepare next weeks show and not put together a Cas song from scratch in a few days time. They were almost like regular roommates coming and going as they needed and meeting up for dinners before arguing over what movie they were going to watch.  Luckily no more accidental bathroom walk ins happened and so far Gabriel hadn’t brought up hearing him sing again.  Everything was peaceful in the house.
“The car’s in na bag.” Cas looked up to see that Dean had the pie box open and a huge piece was missing from the slice. He chuckled some as Dean barely swallowed the first piece before taking another bite.
Dean picked up his own beer, but before he could take a drink, movement at the entrance caught his attention. A hot brunette in a leather jacket and zip up boots entered looking around the room, almost scanning it. Something about her gaze was a bit fierce and held Dean’s attention. After a moment she seemed to find who she was looking for and an almost sinister smile formed as she headed toward the bar. Dean’s attention went back to his beer and he took a drink as Gabe and Sam found their natural rhythm in conversation. Not even a minute later they were abruptly interrupted.
“Hey, you okay?” Cas’ eyes darted around the room avoiding eye contact and this made Balthazar’s eyebrows knit together slightly. “You’re not going to leave are you?”
Today he did not have on his best suit or even a suit for that matter. He was dressed in his regular blue jeans, black boots, black undershirt and charcoal grey button button up shirt which he had left unbuttoned. The same thing he would wear any other day unless there was some formal event he were attending. "I'll bring him in," Dean answered forcing his voice to sound cool, calm, and collected.  He wanted to show the angel right away that he wasn't scared to do the handling. He followed the man outside where he saw Castiel standing in shackles barefoot in the drive. He took a deep breathe before heading to the truck to retrieve him.
Dean nodded. He respected that Gabe was letting his brother crash while he figured stuff out. Family was important to Dean and that bit of information was enough to make him want to give the guy a chance... at least more than his original impression of “weirdo eccentric rich guy who runs a gay club.”
Cas moved from behind the equipment into center stage, jumping and dancing as he sang the chorus. The energy around Dean was electric, even Sam next to him let out a chuckle and couldn’t help grin at him. Dean was chewing his lip, unable to keep his eyes off of him. The simple act of raising the mic to his mouth caused his shirt to lift exposing his hips perfectly. Dean swallowed hard.
Castiel looked over at Dean's table. For some reason he thought about the girl at the bookstore. Even though he was jealous of the girl at the counter, he knew Dean had done nothing wrong. And unlike Balthazar, when sex was brought up, Dean booked it out of there not making such a public display of affection the way Balthazar always had. He looked back up at the stage then with new realization. This was Balthazar's way of telling him what he couldn't the night that he took off. Well, he had tried to tell him but he wasn't in a place to listen to it.
Wow, he really is just some guy the cute monster fell in love with because they have no frame of reference when it comes to these kinds of things and therefore, developed an emotional attachment to an undeserving schmuck.
“I detect traces of Michael’s grace in this room. He may be aware of our presence. We should be careful. I suspect he may try to target you.”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“You could always adopt. Jack was a special case, and while you two love Claire like a daughter, you didn’t get to raise her either. It’s understandable to want another,” Linda says, well meaning but more than likely unaware of just how painful their last baby adventure was.
“Odds are he’s jumped universes by now. Oh well, his loss. Right Cassie? ”
Just like that, the wedding starts feeling too real. Does he want a Scooby Doo wedding? Would a cowboy wedding fly? How did the devil catch wind of what they were doing anyway? He feels a sudden stab of betrayal the likes of which he hasn’t felt in years.
"Mr. Fell, Mr. Crowley! So good to see you two again. I was worried something had happened."
“Take it from someone who knows, sometimes you just have to say what you mean and let the chips fall where they may. Your angels is far too literal to read between the lines otherwise.”
Dean rubs his neck, concentrating on the fancy tiles under his feet. This part is kind of hard to admit to. Even if Sam insists they’ve been acting like a married couple for a while, and the kid didn’t even realize they weren’t together-together this whole time, everything feels super new. Things haven’t been that different, but they’ve been dancing around each other so long. He’s kind of off his game.
Cas nods, and Dean changes the subject, but the angel finds himself forming a plan.
“It’s definitely working. And as much as I would love it if my little brother fell in love with literally anyone else, seems like I’m stuck with you as a brother in law, ” Lucifer says, letting out a resigned sigh. The bartender helpfully hands Lucifer his favorite drink.
“Anything you wish,” Cas says. And it sounds suspiciously close to a Princess Bride’s reference. He curses Metatron again for making him fluent in Dean’s language of choice.
Cas sighs and banishes his wings.
“Dammit, you’re right. I’m being stupid. I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” he says wearily.
“I suppose Jack might come to get him again if Castiel stays with us too long. He always checks in with us first, then Lucy,” Aziraphale reminds him before abandoning his favorite chair so he can sit by Crowley.
Lucifer tries not to snicker.
“Dean.”
“Are you alright? You’ve been staring at that elevator for a while now,” Lucifer says.
“Yeah but-”
“I see. He really is determined to ruin everything. I’ll inform Amenadiel of the situation personally. I’d sooner go back to Hell than see my nephew baby napped for the second time this decade.”
Dean's gotten some of his bravado back thanks to the angel's reassurances and easily fights back.
Castiel tries his best not to look crestfallen. Maybe, the man in front of him is simply a terrible flirt. Of course, he’s found someone better by now. Hell, maybe, Castiel was never in the running, and he’s deluding himself.
Castiel doesn’t remember what he was feeling then. He only remembers dropping the knife and becoming Cas once more because he knew exactly what those words meant coming from Dean.
His little brother takes a deep shuddering breath and proceeds to spill his guts for the next two hours. Even though he’s told an extremely condensed version of events, he’s amazed that his brother is still in one piece, although admittedly, he’d died a worrying amount of times. That’s not why Castiel is here though, and he realizes rather quickly that situation is not what he thought. No, if anything, Castiel wants to vent, and he was the easiest target for his anger, well, after the vampires that have definitely been vaporized with holy light by now.
“You’re going to shamelessly flirt with me the entire time, aren’t you?” he says, already resigned to his fate. Even so, he holds onto him more tightly.
“I want to see the baby. You promised.”
Cas has a sickening feeling that he shouldn’t be. He’s had his chance and ruined it.
Yes, that’s right, your favorite angel. He comically falls over himself to get to Cas quicker. He gently touches his neck, and Hell is replaced with Heaven. He’s missed the electric feelings coursing through him. Dean hasn’t had a serious injury in a while.
Dean refuses to connect the dots.
“Whatever Raphael,” he says, choosing that moment to dash into the bookstore, grinning wickedly.
“You sure he’s actually nice and not just full of shit?”
Cas laughs and wraps his arms around his waist again.
“Actually, we’ve been talking, and we’ve decided to wait a while before having a big wedding,” Cas says, not sounding particularly bothered by this new development. That irks him a little, even though he’s getting exactly what he wanted.
Cas tilts his head, a curious look in his eyes.
“Glad to see you two in one piece. I’m dreadfully sorry about your run in with Michael. He’d been keeping a low profile before your visit. I didn’t think he’d be a problem.”
“My family is getting along. It’s a miracle. And, here I thought, I was going to have to break up a fight and start hiding all the demon blades.”
“Dean tried to use Angel as a pet name once, I think,” he muses, not sure why he feels compelled to tell them this story. He thinks maybe Aziraphale will get a chuckle out of it.
He shakes his head, still doubtful. Wings dragging on the cement forlornly as they casually walk to Lux.
“Dean.” The words are pleading. He’s more worried for him than himself.
“Your fork knowledge?”
“Are we friends?”
It must have been an intentional omission because Amenadiel flips.
There’s an agonizing sixty seconds where neither of them talk. Dean breaks first.
Cas seems to get that Dean doesn’t want to have a big romantic moment here and backs off, but he can’t completely hide his disappointment. He sits back down on the loveseat and doesn’t bother pulling Dean down with him. He joins him anyway.
“You’re seeing a therapist? Seriously?” He can’t help but sound bitter. Dean finally thought he and Cas were in sync.
Dean’s life for once is pretty damn near perfect. The old Dean wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it. He’d keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, probably forever if he didn’t sabotage himself first. New Dean is secure in the knowledge that Cas loves him, and Jack isn’t interested in micromanaging his life like Chuck would. His life is his own. So, it’s kind of stupid of him to go poking the hornet's nest, but this has been bugging him for a while now.
And yeah, if anyone gives off bad vibes in this universe, it’s Michael.
“Why am I early? We were planning to visit Linda and Amenadiel beforehand to see Charlie.”
Uh, Dean’s not really sure how he’s supposed to salvage this. Wasn’t the guy trying to turn his reputation around? You’d think he’d be happy that he comes across as the good twin.
Being wholeheartedly showered with unconditional love gets kind of overwhelming. So, he clears his throat and makes an excuse to pry himself free from the angel’s grip.
“Dammit.”
It’s not the same devil, but like Hell, he’s going to trust his word after what they’ve been through with their own Lucifer.
“See you tomorrow, bright and early,” Linda says, avoiding the subject all together.
Some of the light leaves Dean’s eyes as he goes back to sulking.
"It's therapeutic for him," Aziraphale explains.
Castiel waits for him to elaborate, but the demon refuses to say another word. Cas does what he does best and stares him down. Crowley’s dark shades easily shield him from the angel’s penetrating gaze. Despite this, the fallen angel instinctively tenses, disliking the sudden scrutiny. He knows he’s being rude, but if Crowley can help him, he's not above intimidating a demon, even one he’s quite fond of. Aziraphale can’t stand the tense silence and intervenes again.
“Bullshit,” Dean says. Sam shoots him a look telling him not to piss the guy off, but he’s not about to go easy on the devil. It doesn’t matter who’s face he’s wearing.
Okay, not a bad strategy, Sam’s taking advantage of the fact that Lucifer actually seems fond of his baby brother here. Lucifer scowls and pushes past them, heading for the elevator.
“Good news, right Honeybee?” he asks sweetly.
Cas knows he’s serious, but he’s also known him long enough to realize that Dean won’t go through with it if he doesn’t want him to.
Last time nearly destroyed him. He’s not going through that again. He tries to walk away, but the angel is in front of him before he can even blink. Dean scowls. He did not miss Cas being able to sneak up on him at the drop of a dime.
“Look, if you could just butt out, we could-”
“You’ve been in hell all this time?”
“We start by impressing Amenadiel and Linda got it. Once the devil hears that I’m actually a decent guy from people he trusts, he has to come around,” he says, regaining some of his initial optimism.
Dean sits up abruptly, nearly falling off his chair as he scrambles to face him. His eyes are puffy, and the man is still a little misty eyed, but Cas can’t help the warmth that fills him at the spark of hope in his eyes. He must want this too.
“Shit, sorry about my language,” he says because he’s super good at putting his foot in his mouth.
“It’s your lucky day. He’s turned in early.”
Cas nods, rubbing his neck sheepishly. Something he’s picked up from him.
He should have guessed.
Lucifer steps away from the piano and pours himself a drink. He silently offers them each a glass. Cas shakes his head, grabbing Dean’s arm before he can accept, basically saying no for the both of them. Lucifer raises an eyebrow, surprised when Dean doesn’t kick up a fuss. He shouldn’t be. Now that he’s punched the devil in the face and ruined his chance of making a good face to face impression, his one remaining goal for this visit is to not make a damn scene in front of his in-laws. He’s actively ignoring the fact he blurted out a proposal at Linda’s.
What’s with Cas and making unilateral decisions designed to break his heart into a million pieces? He doesn’t want this. Why would he do this? Why can’t they be a normal couple who talks about things first? Dammit!
“And now, introducing Hell’s most beloved angel, Castiel to the stage! ”
How the fuck was he not able to meet the devil’s standards?
“I see. That’s disappointing but not unexpected, considering your partner.”
Crowley scowls at him, but the other angel seems immune, still happily holding his hand. The demon keeps sulking.
Dean looks down thoughtfully at his empty drink instead of saying something sarcastic. When he finally looks up, he’s rubbing his neck, looking a touch embarrassed.
He manages to sound light hearted, but Dean is more than willing to throw hands if Lucifer oversteps. The devil’s expression hardens as if reminded why he doesn’t like him in the first place.
It doesn't seem like he's lying, but Dean understandable trust issues flare up, and he can't accept Cas's answer as is.
The smarmy angel has the gall to salute him. It makes his skin crawl.
He realizes a second too late the minefield he’s entered by phrasing it that way, even Cas looks shocked. He hasn’t exactly advertised his doubts to anyone other than Sam.
Amenadiel pulls him in for another hug, catching Cas off guard.
Cas practically tackles him and gives him a bone crushing hug as invisible wings wrap around them.
“Mazikeen actually, she can be quite the snoop when she wants to be. We’ll chat later assuming Dean doesn’t get cold feet. I hear he can be quite the heartbreaker.”
“He’s going to be the death of you. Oh wait, it was the other way around, wasn’t it brother?”
"Very well, Mr. Winchester, and what about you angel?"
Cas hums, taking a few seconds to think about his dad or uh, step dad before saying anything.
Dean instinctively gets up and places himself in a fighting stance. He’s still in fight or flight mode, and he’s not ready to trust the devil to help them. Lucifer’s stupid grin falters when he sees Cas covered in blood, and Dean holding an angel blade. Dean freezes as the devil’s eyes turn hellish. He knows exactly what this looks like.
“Yeah, I’m sorry I put you through that. I-I thought you were gone and-”
“Hello Dean,” Cas says as soon as he enters the room, eyes never leaving the book he’s reading, a small smile on his lips.
Dean nods, deciding not to say a peep until they're out of the house.
“I missed you.”
It’s a warning, but he ignores it. He needs answers.
“Yikes, yeah, I guess I either see Linda or I’m doomed forever, huh?”
"Winchester," he offers.
“What the Hell are you talking about?”
Cas sighs as if this is something he knows but only accepts begrudgingly. Dean wants to argue, but it’s taking all his concentration to keep from falling over.
“Her loss, unlike my brother, I wouldn’t take a gift from God for granted.”
“I still want to help you, Cassie. Tell me about them,” he says, gesturing for him to sit.
Of course, Cas doesn’t get it. Sam loved him from the start simply because he was an angel even though he treated him like crap in the beginning for being Lucifer’s future vessel. Not only is Dean starting with negative points, he’s reasonably sure that if this devil had gotten a hold of Cas while they were on a break that his angel would be getting hitched to someone else by now, probably a saint, you know, someone actually worthy of him.
Dean’s brain short circuits as Cas confidently struts onto the stage with dazzling prismatic wings. He suddenly has the urge to fall to his knees and comb his fingers through Cas’s feathers and never ever let the angel go. It only gets worse when the angel starts to sing ‘Somebody to Love.’ His angel is about half way through the song when Sam shakes him lightly to snap him out of it.
It’s not Aziraphale who reacts. Crowley lets out a sharp laugh that almost sounds like a hiss. He finally removes his shades and sets them on the coffee table, shaking his head fondly.
“I would prefer that you not get into the mindset that you have to impress our therapist and win therapy.”
“Of course, you are, your Cas.”
“If you like hanging out with Crowleys so much, why don’t you just marry this one? He’s practically a better version of me,” he huffs.
“We were going to foster,” Cas says weakly.
“But he has faith in you,” Amenadiel says seriously like he should have known better.
“Care to share with the class, dear?”
“Dean.”
“Timeline’s different here from what Castiel’s told me. It’s actually been a few decades since he’s popped in. I’d assumed Naomi had got to him again, and he’d find time to drop in when he finally snapped out of it. I do wish he’d just stay here, but he’s always been a stubborn one. ”
"Ah yes, sorry, that was unprofessional of me, and you sir?"
They don't leave with Gabriel in the morning. Cas is more than capable of bringing the Winchester's home at their leisure. He practically has to shoo his brother out of this universe before he causes untold havoc on the populace. He introduces them to Amenadiel and a few of his friends, including Chloe. After helping solve a bizarre case, that coincidentally involved ancient magical artifacts instead of the usual homicidal maniac, Dean pulls him aside.
“What did he do this time?” Crowley asks, immediately seeing through him.
"What did you feed him while he was human?" Aziraphale asks accusingly. It's the closest to mad he's ever seen him.
“Lucy!”
Angels are stupidly good at turning one of their own into something they’re not. Lucifer’s preferences are simply different from Naomi’s if he had to guess.
He tries to withdraw, half remembering the man is big on personal space, and he’s held onto him longer than what is probably appropriate. Dean grips his arm and keeps him in place.
Castiel decides to ignore the tall, moose like stranger and address his half drunk friend.
Apparently, his angel didn’t fully absorb the temporary voluntary aspect of the gig. Kids aren’t stray dogs they can just pick off the street.
And yeah, he’s getting a semi-sympathetic look so he definitely made the right call keeping it short. Cas meanwhile has nabbed his hand in a, ‘No, I’m the lucky one’ kind of way he doesn’t have the energy to argue about right this minute.
Turns out the angel is already bored of him and living a double life, and they’ve only been an official couple for a few weeks. He’s lived with Crowley longer than that.
Cas turns pale with an expression that says he left the stove on and now the house is on fire. It goes away quickly, and he hums noncommittally as he suspiciously moves away from him. There’s something there, and Cas is the definition of the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. He’s not going to let this go, especially if Charlie’s involved somehow.
“Wait, Cas, you don’t remember us? ” Sam asks.
Cas can’t help himself and decide it’s worth the risk to tease Dean a little.
“I don’t care.”
“Okay, I think it’s time for you two to go,” Linda says, not unreasonably.
“And your home now?” he asked before taking a bite. Castiel could see an obscene amount of marshmallow creme and couldn’t stop himself from making a face. Gabriel ignored it as he swallowed. “Or did you come back to tell me you’re moving in with Meg…” He raised his eyebrows at him suggestively and Cas rolled his eyes even though he was happy to hear him joking again.
As if it didn’t happen all the cast including Gabriel all skipped back to the stage to finish the number leaving Dean a little dazed and very much pissed at Sammy for leaving him.
“It's cool,” Dean managed to get out as he attempted to meet the Cas’ gaze. It was intense and made him fidget some. When he broke his eyes away they lowered to rough looking lips before Dean forced them to the floor.  He berated himself internally for having such a weird reaction, though luckily it didn’t seem as if Cas had noticed. “I mean I said you could talk to me as a friend or whatever. That hasn't changed or anything.” Even as he said it his eyes stayed focused on the floor. They did seem to be more comfortable there as Dean was never good about talking about feelings and all that kind of mumbo jumbo.
“Well, shit, Dean. I mean really, what did you expect?” Sam asked his brother who had chosen to walk home from the dance without telling anyone he went with or giving any kind of explanations. His phone was lighting up again, Cas calling for the tenth time and Dean groaning and pulling the pillow over his head.
Dean had his eyes closed on the way home which helped the world stop spinning a little bit… but that didn’t keep him from chastising Sam with every bump or turn he thought he took too sharp as he drove him home. “Maybe we should have left the Impala at the club,” he mumbled.
The silence between them as they stared at each other, her with her annoying smirk and him with his jaw set like at any minute he would take aim and shoot, made the two observers squirm uncomfortably until one finally took Jane by the arm and pulled her toward the door. "See you tonight then?" she called back looking over her shoulder at Dean.
break into a locked bathroom. Dean scoffed some feeling his personal space completely invaded with nothing but the flimsy shower curtain between them.  He opened his mouth to tell him off but the Novak spoke first. “You can sing.” The statement sounded more like an accusation.
“That’s true,” Balthazar chimed in. “I could easily go to a hotel and be out of everyone’s way.”
When Dean got home it was just past six o’clock. Still early though he was surprised that Sam was nowhere to be found. He sent him a text and flipped on the TV channel surfing as the minutes ticked on. After a bit he sent another text.
Of course Gabe had turned around to watch almost giving an eye roll as Meg tortured his little brother, touching on him flirtatiously as she sang. But if it were a regular Friday night and she walked up to an audience member to sing to one of the girls in the crowd he was pretty sure they’d go wild. Another plus for Meg.
Dean nodded letting him know that he heard him and looked around after throwing a couple of bills down for the drink with a tip. He took his phone back out and opened a message to send to Castiel.
Dean had just found a show to settle on when he got a message back.
She set down the glasses for them and passed the bottle off to Balthazar with a polite smile before giving them space again.
It was only after she brought Cas home and he passed out that she was able to talk to Gabe and get a clearer picture of his past and everything that had lead up to the kiss. The two didn’t like each other much, but it was clear that they both had a common interest in keeping Cas safe and healthy. Something she thought they had agreed on until Gabe went and pulled this. “All I’m saying,” She tore her eyes from the closed door and bore them into Gabriel unapologetically, “is this seems like a step backwards. You got him to sing. Good for you. Now leave him the fuck alone.”
After long nights and more than a couple of dangerous journeys into the world of finding these rare relics, he was finally in a place where he was more than comfortable spending the money needed. Tomorrow morning he would see the creatures in the flesh at the viewing room. The whole ordeal was very high brow and appointment only. He would be shown the best looking angel’s that been captured and sold into captivity and get to pick straight from the show room floor. He went to bed a little nervous but mostly excited that he would be not only obtaining, but owning the most expensive supernatural creature in the world come this time tomorrow.
Castiel straightened some, his brothers lyrics hitting him differently after shivering some from the strong taste of the drink he had downed. He tilted his head some listening and it became clearer then what the song was about. Not about God not coming to someone’s rescue, but rather God allowing two people to be together as it is His plan, despite a person not understanding why He has set them on that path.
Castiel thought to himself not sure why Meg didn’t want him to hear her performance.  She had never been shy before. After a couple of his head cocked to one side while he watched his friend perform trying to put his finger on it.
Gabe had hurried in after what sounded like a crash and now stood in the doorway taking in the sight before him.  His younger brother was still wearing the slacks and dress shirt that Gabe had cut into a crop top and would have looked even better with long black jacket over it that would pay homage to the dumb trench coat that he loved so dearly, if Gabe could have gotten that far.  After Cas changed earlier he had caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and he was triggered into a panic that came with rambling self hatred, curses about himself.  Gabe was shocked at first but was finally able to piece together the things Cas had been saying to be the fucked up things that their father had told him around the time he kicked him out of the house and his life.
“Thanks.” Dean mumbled and tipped the second glass back just as easily. He wanted it to bother him that Gabe was picking up the tab like he couldn’t do it himself or something, but truth be told he was annoyed and looking to rack the tab up. So if the guy was offering then that was just
Cas nodded once as if he completely understood and moved out from behind the desk as he walked passed Dean to the kitchen, leading the way.  “Samuel went to the grocery store. He said he was afraid you wouldn’t eat any of the food in the house,” he explained simply and started moving around the kitchen with grace, knowing where everything was.
Now he was here and his days were constantly filled with human interaction. Of course he was all hopped up on endorphins and extra energy. He sighed softly, calming some as he closed his eyes and figured he just needed to have some time to explore the city on his own or maybe even have a few meaningless flings while he was out here, especially if it would mean he wouldn’t lose any more sleep at night. Feeling certain that was the problem, he felt his eyes growing tired like he could finally doze off.
“Performance therapy. Yeah, Gabriel told me all about it. Seems like you’ve got a lot of groupies. There were a lot of people pressed up against that stage tonight all looking at you.” Castiel blushed, making Balthazar’s smile deepen. “Girls and boys…”
Cas nodded and looked at the three he was sitting with before telling them sincerely, “thank you for coming tonight. I appreciate your support.”
Dean’s heart ached as he put his hand on Cas’ back trying to calm him, putting the puzzle pieces together that he was very drunk and not likely to remember this in the morning. He wasn’t a drinker. Dean knew that. And from the looks of the bar, Cas might have had as much liquor as Dean did the previous night.  At the thought Dean turned to Chuck who looked somewhat injured himself as he watched them.  Dean opened his mouth to lay into him about serving him so much but his thoughts were interrupted when Gabriel brushed passed him and moved to tend to his brother.
In the
“I didn’t say anything.”  Cas’s free hand palms Dean’s hip.
Cas smiles, and Dean’s heart melts. The way his eyes crinkle at the corners. The way the blue of his eyes seems to sparkle. “Yes. I did.”
Dean shoves Cas back, stubborn tears welling in his eyes. “You think I don’t respect you, Cas?”
The deep line between his brows smoothes out just a little, and he licks his lips as he leans back against the lockers, pulling Cas closer.  “C’mere.”  The halls are still deserted, and he wants to take advantage of the brief moment they have alone.  He thinks,
Dean’s smug as he leans back in his chair, the ancient thing creaking with the movement and the weight of its occupant. “Oh, so now we’re playing concerned guardian angel?” Dean watches the muscle working in Cas’s jaw, and feels his own do the same.  He’s tipsy and pissed -- never a good combination with a Winchester.
“Yeah, sure, Dean,” Sam says, glancing up with a knowing smile.  “Take your time.”
“You need him, I know.”
“What’s wrong?”
Dean’s never seen anything so stunning.
. We will find a way.
Dean leans forward, draping an arm over his bent knee. “‘Course, Cas. Why?”
Dean takes his time, running his fingers over the banister of the porch.  The white paint is chipping and worn down, but the wood, he can tell, is quality.  No splinters, no cracking, no warping.  It’s nice.  He drags in a deep breath, his senses flooding with the scent of pine trees as the warm early-autumn air blows through them.  The sky is clear, save for a couple little puffs of cloud here and there.  And as his eyes scan the sky, he waits for it -- that impending sense of doom and dread.  Even when he’s trying to relax, it’s always there, bubbling beneath the surface.  There’s a reason he’s slept with a gun under his pillow for three decades.
Cas stops, closing his mouth.  His brows draw together, and he tips his head.
Huffing, Dean pushes off the chair and heads for the hallway. It was a mistake going to Sam. It was a mistake trying to convince him of something despite it making Dean sound paranoid and overbearing. It was a mistake to open that floodgate.
That’s the lie he tells himself when he downs another fifth of whiskey and cries himself to sleep clutching that old, worn photo of Cas, Sam, Jo, Ellen, himself, and Bobby.
“How’d’you figure?”  Dean drops his hands to his hips and shakes his head.  “The things I feel, Cas--” his words catch in his throat.  His gaze falls to the floor, and he drags a shaky breath.  “You told me you loved me,” he squeezes his eyes shut, “and there ain’t know way that’s real.”  Though his voice is hushed, it seems so loud in that little classroom.  He doesn’t mean to say it, he doesn’t think.  Or maybe he does.  If now’s not the fucking time to talk about it, then when?
“Team Free Will,” Dean huffs.
“What?”  Sam sounds shocked, if a little incredulous.
“I can’t.”
He’s downing the neck of his fourth beer when Cas finds him. His door’s ajar, and he knows Cas can hear a lot better than humans, so he’s heard Dean rustling around; heard the clinking of the empties on the desk.
he’d thought.
They walk together to Dean’s room, their footsteps too loud and echoing in the silent, still bunker.  Cas steps through the door first, and Dean follows, closing it behind them.  With Cas’s back to him still, Dean scrubs his hands over his face, trying hard to calm his nerves.  He shrugs out of his jacket and tosses it to the desk chair.  It misses and flops to the floor, but he doesn’t bother to pick it up.  “D’you-- you wanna make yourself comfortable?” He asks.
“Dean…”
An emcee — a young guy with a massive beard and a man bun — ushers the performer offstage and takes the mic. “Welcome any newcomers to Zeppelin and Wharf. Tonight, as you can see, is acoustic open mic, and we’ve got a decent roster. Sign ups are at the bar if anyone’s interested. Uhhh, Okay. Next up, we have, uh…” The guy stops to squint at his paper. “Dean Winchester. We got a Dean anywhere?”
-- without Cas.  Each and every time feels so final.  So devastating.  Each and every time, it feels worse.  Harder to deal with.  He can’t, he decides.  He can’t do that again.  Never again.  He needs to swallow his pride.  If he doesn’t, he’s losing Cas for good.  He’s losing Cas by choice, and that’s not something he can stomach.  So, with a gust of resolve, he grabs Cas’s face between both hands and draws him in.  “I don’t wanna know the other side of a world without you, Cas.  Not again.”
“So, the waitress gave me a name and a general neighborhood, but no address.” Sam turns his collar up against the chill in the wind as he joins Dean and Cas, leaning back against the Impala. “Figured it won’t be too hard to track this guy down.”
“It’s late,” Cas says with no preamble as he steps into the room, closing the door behind himself.  “You should be resting.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes, and it pulls Dean from his thoughts.
Dean scoffs, incredulous.  Didn’t think there was anything for him to say?  “What show have you been watching, huh?”
Scoffing, Sam presses his tongue against the inside of his cheek.  “That’s funny coming from you.”
“Well you’re dead wrong.”
“I’ve given everything for you, Dean. To you.  And for what?  To be insulted.  Rejected.  Heartbroken.”  He shoves himself off with a huff, looking like he’s made up his mind about something.  And the finality of it terrifies Dean.  So much so that he’s reaching out as Cas steps back.  “I would take a page from your book and call you a son of a bitch, but I won’t insult your mother.”
“Yeah, yeah.  Good to have you back, Cas.”
Again, Dean scoffs.  “Never had much faith to begin with, Cas.  Can’t have a crisis if it ain’t there.”
Dean’s wrong, and they wipe out the werewolf culprit two days later. They make the thirteen-hour haul back to the bunker in one push, all of them exhausted and ready to be home in the comfort of their own beds.
“Never gonna stop.”  He kisses him slow and tilts his mouth away to press their foreheads together.  “Never gonna stop showin’ you, either.”
Pushing himself up on his hand, Dean cradles Cas’s jaw with the other.  “Cas,” he whispers, shaking his head.  “I mean it.  I meant it.  Without you… I don’t wanna do it.  I can’t do it.  Any of this.”
Dean licks his lips, tasting Cas and the salt of his own sweat.  He’s silent for a moment, and he shifts to settle a hand behind his head.  “That I’m worth it.  That you’re better off with me.  I’m like a pit, Cas.  And lovin’ me… it just swallows people whole and drags ‘em down.”  He sniffs as tears well in his eyes again, and he can’t bring himself to look away from Cas’s beautiful face, illuminated only by the soft light of the lamp on Dean’s desk.
Though Cas’s face is mere millimeters from his own, Dean can hardly see through his tears. His heart aches, and his stomach is in knots. He simultaneously wants to end it all and wants to hold Cas in his arms and never let go. He settles for kissing him. It’s hard and heated and sloppy, but it’s everything he wants in the moment.
, Dean thinks,
Sam elected to take Eileen to breakfast, leaving Cas and Dean to handle the grocery run on their own. Not that Dean minds spending any amount of time with Cas. It’s nice, just the two of them.
elicited that sound from him.  “Dean,” Cas breathes against the shell of his ear.
“That’s not— it’s—“ Dean huffs, exasperated with his brother. Why can’t he see? “You don’t know him like I do, okay?”
With a huff of exasperation, Dean whirls around on his heel to look at Cas directly.  “I’m sorry,” he sais, more forceful than intended.  Cas looks taken aback, and Dean’s face softens.  “I-- The kid…”  He heaves a breath, pushing his hands in the pockets of his FBI windbreaker as he looks down at his feet.  He toes at a scuff mark and tries to collect his thoughts; tries his best to rearrange the Scrabble pieces in his mind into a coherent statement.  “I know,” he starts slowly, his gaze still fixed on his shoes.  Why are apologies so goddamn hard?  “I know you’re havin’ a rough time with the kid.  ‘N’ I’m sorry.”
“Dean, wait! Hey! Stop!”
“Cas, I’m sorry.”  His voice is strained and soft in the quiet solitude of his bedroom.   Cas doesn’t speak, nor does Dean turn around.  He hears rustling behind him, and feels Cas as he moves closer.
“What are you talking about, man?”  He had tried so hard to understand.  They should have been finding a way out.  A way out from under Billie’s wrath.
Dean’s face flushes immediately, and Sam and Cas turn to stare at him, both open-mouthed and shocked. Eileen, not having heard most of what the emcee said, looks rightfully confused. Sam quickly explains, and she, too, turns to stare at Dean.
“I wasn’t in the Netherworld, I was--”
,” he says, and his elated grin matches Dean’s. “Less dumb. Less ass.”
Cas seems to consider it a moment, like he’s rearranging the Scrabble squares to find the right words. “I’ve spent a great deal of time around humans over the years. And, admittedly, my experience with being a ‘couple’ is limited, I feel like there are preconceived notions I’m not able to shake.”
.  This is real,” Cas whispers.
Cas advances on him, and Dean stumbles back against his dresser.  “You and I both have blood on our hands. Often we spill each other’s. We have both done unspeakable things. But Hester was wrong, Dean. The moment my hand touched you, I was not lost. I was found.”
There is nothing in the entirety of existence that Dean wouldn’t give for this to not be the end; to see the crinkles at the corners of Cas’s eyes when he smiled -- a beautiful, but rare sight almost always reserved for Dean; to feel his hand on his shoulder again… But most of all, There’s nothing in all of the cosmos he wouldn’t give to hear those two simple words again; a soundtrack to Dean’s small respite of happiness:
“With my entire being,” Cas says, with no hesitation.
Those were the two words he had never wanted to hear.  Not from Cas.  Never from Cas.
“Don’t you mean we?” Cas huffs, kissing across Dean’s collarbone to show the other side of his neck the same attention.
“I know.  I know.”  Dean licks his lips and swallows hard.  “Whatever it takes.”  He kisses Cas again and rolls to his side, his hand curved firmly around the hinge of Cas’s jaw.  “Stay,” he whispers as he closes his eyes, finally feeling the exhaustion -- the adrenaline and the alcohol wearing off.  “Please.”
“What?”  Dean shifts to settle beside Cas, laying on his side.  He props his head against his hand, his free hand smoothing over Cas’s chest before it stills.
“Dean, you can tell me anything…”
The one person who’s stood beside him through everything is an Angel who saw fit to lay siege to Hell and rescue him. An Angel who’s chosen him over and over again, put him above all else; above Heaven itself. An Angel who, before Dean, knew nothing of love but knew he loved Dean. And this is how Dean repays him.
“When this is over,” Cas turns to Dean as they step away from the abomination and head for the gymnasium together, “I will make him pay.”
“Hey.  Dean, what… What’s wrong?”
to be sent to – is when he’s alone with Cas.  Cas, especially in this state –  breathless, flushed, and aroused, is his religion.  His everything.  Dean will worship on his knees until the day he dies.
“Yeah. And?”
When Cas lifts his hips to allow Dean to pull his pants down, his thigh brushes Dean’s cock, and he hisses at the friction.  He rolls his own hips, chasing the sensation, groaning when he finds it. And he finds he’s desperate for more.  He hears Cas’s shoes hit the floor, and after a moment of shimmying and shifting, they’re equally unclothed.  “Fuck, Cas,” he says, breathless.  His tongue swipes Cas’s bottom lip and his hand closes around them both.  They groan, the sound drowning on each other’s lips, their tongues sliding together.
Cas gets Dean’s t-shirt over his head, and his hands smooth down Dean’s back.  Dean watches those blue eyes drink him in, and he smirks -- feeling cocky from the drinks and the effect he has on Cas.  He can’t help it.  Sinking to the edge of the bed, Cas pulls Dean in by the waist, and his fingers bury in the angel’s mess of dark hair.  Dropping his head, he presses a kiss there and breathes in deep.  Breathes in Cas.  He smells so good.  Earthy, clean.  Like the smell of trees on the wind on a warm spring day.  It’s his favorite smell, Dean decides.  And he never wants to forget it.  “I’m sorry, Cas,” he murmurs.  The angel’s fingers are warm and firm as the drag over his skin, popping the button of his jeans; working the zipper down.  “I’m so fucking sorry.”
, Cas!  Everyone I’ve ever fuckin’ loved… I destroy them.”  He jabbed a hand in Cas’s direction. “That—that angel, whatever the fuck her name was, she was right! The moment you laid your fuckin’ hand on me, Cas, you were lost! I’ve never been good for you!” He drops his head, practically sobbing.
Dean smiles and looks to Cas. He nudges him gently. “Whaddya say, Cas?”
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Are you sure about that?”
Sam thinks on it a moment, then nods with a tight-lipped smile.  Dean can see the sadness and fear etched into the tired lines of his face, and he feels the weight of sadness.  He wishes he could take that away.  He wishes his little brother hadn’t been dealt such a shit hand in life.  But this is it.  This is their life, and there’s no way around it.
Cas told him once he always comes when Dean calls.  Dean’s never needed that to be more true than right now.  So he prays.  He prays and he prays and he prays.  “C’mon, Cas.  Please.
Cas’s thumb brushes the space below Dean’s ear and he leans closer.  “We’ll figure it out, Dean.  We will find a way.  We always do.  All of us.  Me, you, Sam--”
“Dean, look at me.”
“But only when we’re alone.”
“Awesome. There’s a bar over in Smith Center I’ve been wanting to check out. Sound good?”  When they’re all in agreement, Dean knocks back the last of his coffee and grins happily. “Awesome.”
Cas laughs softly, pulling Dean in closer. “I prefer
Dean’s eyes well with tears, and he inhales shakily as Cas continues.  “If ever there is tomorrow when we’re not together…there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart…I’ll always be with you.”
“Me--”
Cas stops and heaves a breath, turning toward Dean.  “Don’t what?”
.  Cas certainly notices.
He’s exhausted, and can’t remember the last time he slept.  He needs just a coupla hours, and then he’ll be good to go -- if he can even manage to fall asleep.
To Dean’s outburst, Sam sighs and Eileen nods. “A good idea,” she says, signing to Sam.
Dean sinks to his knees, lips pressed to Cas’s stomach.  They follow his hands as they unfasten his belt and his pants.  They kiss along the waistband of his boxers, and he moans, low and animalistic, as his cheek brushes Cas’s erection.  “Fuck,” he breathes.  He glances up and grips Cas’s thighs to balance himself.  The only Heaven Dean will ever be sent to – ever
He doesn’t wait for a response.  Instead, he kisses him with a bruising intensity and works his hands under that suit jacket to push it from Cas’s shoulders.  It falls unceremoniously to the floor, and it’s kicked aside as Dean edges him toward the bed.  That blue tie follows, and his fingers are shaking as they work at the buttons of Cas’s shirt.  He gets it open and almost gasps.  He’s seen Cas shirtless before, but somehow it’s different.  So close, with the liberty to touch him, it makes him that much more… beautiful.  The expanse of tan skin across firm muscle… it’s almost too much, and they haven’t even begun.
“Yeah,” Dean says, his eyes still fixed on Cas.  “Night, Sammy.  Eileen.”  Sam waits a beat, then takes Eileen’s hand and finally leaves, and Dean drags in a breath.  His heart is racing, and he wonders if Cas can hear it.  Suddenly, the panic room makes him feel too vulnerable, remembering what happened here.  “Can we--”  He stops and clears his throat.  “Can we talk in my room?”
He does, just outside his door. Scrubbing a hand over his face, he turns to face Sam, though he wishes he was facing the bottle of Jim Beam in his dresser drawer. “What, Sam?”
When he pulls away, his hand slips down Cas’s arm to his hand, his thumb brushing the inside of Cas’s wrist.  He heaves a breath, the line between his brows deepening.  “You’re a dick, you know that?” He says suddenly.
He’s spent the better part of this past week doing everything in his power to gain back Cas’s good graces. Cas, to his credit, is outwardly taking it in stride. But Dean wakes each morning to an empty bed, and each morning, he’s faced with his own glaring stupidity.
not quite right.  But here, he has Cas.  He feels calm.  He has no feeling of cosmic obligation or the feeling that he’s running the clock.  He has everything he’s ever wanted.
“Dean.”  Cas’s voice is rougher than usual.  Dean can hear it. Hell, he can practically feel it. It’s wavering and full of emotion. And Christ, it breaks Dean’s heart. “I’ve been in a pit.
so badly.
All thought goes out the window when his fingers slip beneath Dean’s shirt. “I need a shower. Come with me,” Dean breathes as they part. He grins deviously and takes Cas’s hand, leading him to the bathroom, and takes his time worshiping Cas beneath the cascade of hot water.
Sam doesn’t make him repeat himself, and Dean’s thankful for that. “A vow?” Dean doesn’t even have to be looking at him to know the face he’s making. “What kind of vow?” Sam scoffs. “A vow of silence? Chastity?” Dean can hear the smirk in his voice. “Marriage?”
Sam remains and clears his throat, watching his brother, who can’t take his eyes off of Cas.  Eileen is at his elbow, and tugs at his sleeve.  He looks down at her, and they exchange a look.
“What?”  The line between Dean’s brow is deeper than ever as he snaps his head in Sam’s direction.  He finds his brother watching him intently as he steps off the curb.  “The hell are you talkin’ about?”
“Home,” Dean amends.
long fuckin’ time ago.  I’m sorry.  I just--I--I didn't--”
Dean nods, silent and solemn.
“I look forward to that.”
We’ll figure it out.  But I can’t-- I can’t lose you again.  Please, Cas.  Please.
Dean purses his lips and shakes his head.  “You drop somethin’ like that on me and then just fuck off to the netherworld?”
He’s waited his whole life to feel like this.  He tried, with Lisa and Ben, but that piece of the puzzle just wasn’t there.  He tried with the Bunker, and while he loved that place… there was always just
Clearing his throat, Dean swallows against the sudden dryness.  He glances away, focusing on a spot on the wall like it’ll give him the strength he needs to say what he’s gotta say.  “Look, Cas,” his gaze drops to his shoes briefly before he finally forces his eyes up again.  Cas, of course, is watching him patiently and intently.  Dean moves closer and clenches his fists.
This deep, disgusting, filthy shame and pain Dean feels is better than any fake happiness that can be ripped away from him at any moment.  And he knows, if he had asked Cas to stay… he knows if he had just fucking said something, he knows the pain at the end of that road will be so much worse than this.  This, he can convince himself, is his choice.
He sucks in a breath and grunts to himself, like he’s working up to something before he heads up the steps toward the school doors. Everything is a goddamn clusterfuck, and he can’t tell which way is up.
“We won’t let Him win.”  Cas’s hand settles at the hinge of Dean’s jaw, his fingertips dipping into Dean’s hair.  “When the dust settles, we will still be standing.  Together.”
“When you came back to me, looking so beautiful, I don't deserve this, darling, you are perfect to me.
“How? Dean, it’s Cas. This isn’t exactly unusual behavior for him.”
Cas’s hand settles on his shoulder, and Dean swallows.  Finally, he turns to meet Cas’s eyes.  The angel’s jackets are draped over the back of Dean’s desk chair, and that perpetually crooked blue tie hangs loose against the bright white shirt.  It’s moments like this; moments of casual intimacy that makes Dean’s heart ache with love.  Cas doesn’t let his guard down like this for anyone but Dean.  It’s too much, and Dean breaks, sinking to the edge of his bed with his head in his hands. “I don’t know what to do, Cas. I don’t… I promised Sammy. I promised you—“
Fearing condescension, Dean scoffs and pushes through his door. “Go away, Sam.” He tries to close the door, but Sam stops it.
Cas shifts, his coat rustling against the weaved material of the couch. His forehead bumps Dean’s, and Dean closes his eyes. “I’m not leaving.”
“Dean…”  When Dean looks up, Cas shakes his head slowly, and those piercing blue eyes are filled with tears.  It hits Dean like a punch to the gut.  Cas moves closer, and Dean lets him.  Cas reaches for his face, and damn it, Dean lets him.  “There is nothing, nor has there ever been anything, in the entirety of this -- or any other -- world’s existence, more real than my love for you.”
It’s Cas who breaks first -- his kiss is hard, painful, desperate, and heated.  Dean’s back slams against the door, and he’s grabbing at fistfuls of Cas’s hair, groaning at the taste of Cas’s tongue against his.  He doesn’t let himself second-guess or think to much.  He just lets Cas have this.  He lets himself have it.  “I’m tired of you playing this game, Dean,” he says as they part, Dean gasping for air.  “I’m tired of giving myself to you and getting nothing in return.  It ends now.  You make your choice.  Here and now.”
“Shit,” Dean mutters.  He looks around, shifting his weight, and finally tilts his head toward the empty hallway to his left.  “Can we talk?”
“Love you,” Cas finishes for him.  “Yes.”
“I haven’t been watching television.”
“Darling, just hold my hand. Be my guy, I'll be your man. I see my future in your eyes. Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to my favorite song.
Cas’s hands are on his waist, slipping upward beneath the black t-shirt. “Promise what, Dean?”
… Cas had told him how much he loved him.  “Cas…”
“The, uh,” Dean gestures to Cas’s coat.  “The coat.  You wanna-- you can-- if you want.”
“Great,” Dean grunts, shrugging off his jacket. He sets the beer on the table and runs his hand over Cas’s shoulder and kisses the angel’s head before loosening his tie. “Same for me, really. Body is mutilated, so I was thinking werewolf, but the timing ain’t right.” He doesn’t notice the way Cas is watching him curiously as he rambles on.
right? Mine meant little to you in the grand scheme of things.”
Dean kisses him, desperate to anchor himself in Cas.  In his words, his kiss, his touch, in this.  The dream had terrified him; the idea that there could be a world without Cas in which Dean wouldn't care.  It couldn’t be further from the truth.  Every time… every single time he’d lost Cas over the years, he was broken.  Every time, he’d wanted to welcome death, himself.  Because the pain was nearly unbearable.  Life without Cas was Hell on earth for Dean, and he’s been to Hell a few too many times.  He never wants to go back.  The next time Dean dies; the next time Cas dies, it better be together, only to find each other in the afterlife.
Well, fuck.  Cas is in one of those moods.  The stubborn kind.  The kind that reminds Dean of when they first met, and it settles an ache in his chest, weighing heavy on his heart.  “You-- about--”  He huffs, clears his throat, and wipes a hand over his mouth.  Beyond the double doors behind Cas, he hears the squeaking of shoes on the gym’s linoleum floor; the quiet hum of voices engaged in various conversations, no doubt lobbing questions at Sam, the sheriff, and his staff.  With a grunt, his eyes shift back to Cas’s irritated face, and he tries again.  “Can we just talk?”
Before he can take the plunge, Cas gives him a chaste kiss on the lips. He’s more than ready to derail the conversation and turn this into a full on makeout session, but his angel retreats too quickly for Dean to even try to deepen it. He then takes Dean’s captured hands and tenderly presses his lips to each one, a signal for him to be patient and let Cas talk.
"He has a strange preoccupation with bullying plants."
“You really want my extended family to like you.”
“I must admit that my advice may have been colored by recent events I was experiencing at the time, but you’re the one that decided that God wanted you apart. I was merely suggesting that Father was literally dropping the righteous man at your feet for a cosmic hook up,” he explains, more than happy to clear things up even if it was twelve years too late to make much of a difference.
Cas frowns into this neck and slowly pulls away from him.
“Just this once,” he says.
He wants so badly to plunge the angel blade into that damn sucker and prove him wrong but Michael has Cas within easy reach. By proxy, he’s at Michael’s mercy. There isn’t anything he wouldn’t do to keep the angel safe at this point. Besides, he’s afraid the angel might do something stupid if Dean endangers himself. Cas is in too rough of shape to go for a Hail Mary if things go sideways. So, he keeps the borrowed angel blade trained on Michael, hoping it’ll be enough to protect them both.
Lucifer looks at him in disbelief like he’s not sure what to say to that.
Nope, he definitely doesn’t want him hanging out with Crowley any more than necessary. So, he agrees a little too quickly. Dean only hopes he doesn’t regret it later. There’s only so many times he can watch his angel die on him.
“Was it something I said?”
He blushes and willingly initiates the hand holding. Okay, maybe, he doesn’t mind starring in a romantic comedy.
Dean can’t possibly want him. He certainly doesn’t look happy to see him in the memory.
Cas pulls his chin up so the man will have to meet his eyes. He wants to dispense some serious wisdom that the man seems to have forgotten despite the fact that he’s the one with amnesia.
“Last I checked, you left him on the floor of your apartment while he was bleeding out.”
In a few decades, he thinks to himself silently. There’s no need to guilt trip the man.
“Hey, it’s been a while. I hope you weren’t avoiding us.”
Crowley subtly relaxes and leans into Aziraphale, taking his angel’s hand without a hint of hesitation. Aziraphale responds by giving him a quick chaste peck on the cheek. Crowley blushes, but otherwise keeps his cool and doesn’t outwardly react. He’s a little jealous at how easily they show affection in others company. Dean is not quite there yet though he’s trying. At least, he doesn’t seem to mind if Sam sees anymore.
Dean’s hand found its way to Cas’s hip, and the other dragged up along his neck until it was carding through his hair. He gripped as tightly as he could, like he was terrified to let go.
Charlie:
“I think one breakfast and a treat after is more than enough,” Dean heard Cas tell Jacob, a bright smile filling his face. Then he caught sight of Dean and his face drained of blood. He offered Dean a small and uncomfortable smile, then went back to talking with Jacob.
Jacob rolled his eyes at the adults, looking back and forth between them. Charlie, though still breathless, had just managed to sit upright on the floor instead of being curled up and face down on it. Cas was bright red in the face from the strain of not laughing. Shaking his head at them as though they were being absolutely ridiculous (which, okay, maybe they were a little, but dammit that kid was so funny sometimes!), he declared that he was going to go get ready for bed and promptly left the room.
The greatest sensation coursing through Cas was a feeling of love and home.
With all the dignity he could muster, Castiel turned on his foot and fled through the back door into the cold of the night.
Cas looked down at his hands and started picking at a piece of skin on his index finger, the truth evident on his face.
Dean ate his food, but every so often his eyes were drawn back to Cas and the way he was caring for Jacob. He couldn’t help but admire the way he was with the teen, and he could feel the ice in his heart thawing the more he watched them together. Cas’s eyes went soft every time he looked at Jacob. The way he communicated with him, listening so intently to everything that Jacob had to say was so far beyond sweet that Dean didn’t even have a word for it.
“That’s really mature of you, Dean. It can’t be easy having to relive what’s caused you so much pain.”
The line went silent for so long that Dean thought Charlie had hung up. He checked the phone and saw the minutes still ticking over.
Dean:
“I don’t know, Charlie. I don’t want to be shoving myself into Cas’s space, and I don’t want to feel like I can’t relax in case I bump into him again, or like- cause him to run off again…” he trails off, his face turning serious. “I will do it, but only if Cas isn’t going to be there. I know that’s a dick move because it’s his place of work, but it’s the only way I’ll feel comfortable enough to perform. I was really not at my best last night and regardless of whatever feedback you got, I know my performance was shit.” He took a deep breath. “That’s my only condition though. If Cas isn’t going to be there, I will stick around for another week and come play for you again on Friday.”
“You wanna try that one again, buddy?”
He figured that it was a good time to go to sleep, you know, before any other buried feelings and wants decided to make themselves known through prose.
“You know, you could be less of an ass to him. He’s young, he wants to learn, and he really is trying. He’s only just turned 21 so this is his first job in a bar, and look at him! How could I say no to that adorable little face? He’s like a baby deer trying to walk for the first time or something.”
At his touch, Cas let out a soft moan, one that Dean recognized from so many shared moments in their past. Hearing the sound and feeling it’s familiarity was like being drenched in a bucket of ice water. He pulled away and raised his hands in front of him to protect and shield himself.
“I know, I know, and thank you for not shoving at it any further,” she laughed back. “Are you at least feeling better?”
Dean resigned himself to finishing his set and hauling ass out of town at the first available opportunity.
Dean puttered around his hotel room delaying getting into bed because he had decided that that’s when he was going to text Cas back. And he was a whole damn bundle of nerves over it. Anything that would keep his hands or his mind busy, it was getting done. Despite the fact that the hotel had a maid service, he used some napkins to wipe down the desk in the room, and made sure that all the trash was in the garbage can. He picked up any of his clothes that he found around the room and in the bathroom, and put them in his duffel bag. Deciding that wasn’t quite good enough, he then unpacked his duffel bag and separated out his laundry to put in a plastic bag ready to be washed. Of course, then he opened the drawers of the small dresser in the room and actually put the clean clothes away.
“My cat appears to have eaten his way through the window screen and gone on an adventure outside. He’s an indoor cat so I want to find him quickly. I’m okay though, I’m sure he’ll turn up soon.”
handsome!”
“Speaking of live music acts… Dean is going to be playing at the bar again on Friday night.” She eyed him cautiously as she spoke. “I think it’s probably best if you take the night off.”
Charlie:
“Must it always be this way?” Cas asked, smiling softly back at Jacob.
“Jacob lives with him? Where’s Inias?” Dean asked, his curiosity piqued.
Cas kinda melted a little, holding one arm out to wrap around the teen. He kissed Jacob on the top of his head, and his eyes went soft when Jacob hummed in response.
“You two make a good team. Do you have any plans for after dinner?” Cas asked.
Take care of each other. Be kind.
“Okay, enough out of you,” Dean said with an eye roll. “I need to get off the phone so I can go do some work.”
“I don’t even know where to start, dude. Shit’s been wild.”
His phone vibrated with an incoming text, so he figured this was a good time to take a break and went to go check it.
They had gradually moved closer together, drawn towards each other like they always had been before.
“Who’s there?” Cas asked him.
“Dean, I’m going to say something right now that you’re not going to want to hear but I want you to just humor me for a second.” She widens her eyes in question and waits for Dean to nod before continuing. “There are things that you don’t know. Things that I can’t be the one to tell you. I know Cas really wants a chance to talk to you and explain things, and I really want you to consider letting him. Do you think you could do that? You could get the answers you’ve been craving at least as long as you’ve been back in town, and you might gain even more than that out of it. I don’t know for sure, but it’s gotta be better than what’s going on right now, right?”
“I have heard his songs before. It’s not like I’ve never listened to his music.”
“I mean, it might not be the worst thing in the world. It means you’ll both be in an open emotional state and the feelings you express will be more honest?” Judging by her face, she didn’t really believe her own words.
Castiel’s heart sinks lower and tears prick the corners of his eyes. He knows that pain all too well. Of course he does, he’s the one who caused it. He’s the one that ended the best thing that ever happened to him, and knowing he did it for a damn good reason will never ease the pain from that fact.
