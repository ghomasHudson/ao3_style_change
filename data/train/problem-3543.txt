“So your soulmate’s name could be Cookie Monster?” Dean stopped to think for a second, almost laughing.
Dean cut him off.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, going to the kitchen. Dean could hear Bobby sigh from far away and sit down on the bed. Dean went back out with a piece of bread and a cup of cold water.
“Call me if you need anything, okay?” He had given Dean his phone number, praying that Dean would call. Dean nodded into Cas’s chest, closing his eyes. “I would also like to meet Sam. At your pace, though. I don’t want to rush anything. I want you to decide when you feel comfortable, for anything. Seriously.”
“You are no help!”
Saturday morning came around and Dean grabbed Sammy and went immediately to the library. He grabbed everything he could about angels, angel folklore, biblical folklore, anything. He even grabbed a copy of the bible. He almost went as far as buying a crucifix, just to have it. The thought of angels scared him.
Cas hesitantly climbed into bed next to Dean and faced him. Dean scooched a bit closer, silently telling Cas that it was okay and he wanted it. Cas smiled gently and reached his hand forward to grab Dean’s.
Tonight he was hoping it would be different though. He would sleep through the night because he was finally away from that apartment, from that house, from his bad father, and finally somewhere safe.
It was a mistake, according to Dean. He knew he shouldn’t have been kissing him, he knew it, but he couldn’t help it. His eyes fluttered shut and left Cas almost shocked. However, it was practically a fraction of a second before Cas melted into the kiss. Cas’s arms almost immediately fell down to Dean’s waist and pulled him as close as he could; he could actually feel the tension leaving Dean’s body as he kneaded his hands into his lower back.
Cas knew that it was weird, even downright creepy and knew that it could be a violation of privacy, but Dean was very hurt. He was particularly worried about the broken rib, and he knew that Dean was in pain. He would watch him flinch whenever he sat down or turned his body the wrong way, and Cas just wanted to help him.
“Mr. Novak is your soulmate!” She yelled, and Dean lunged forward and covered her mouth.
“What’ya doing?” Jo asked, thinking back to his schedule and being pretty sure that he wasn’t on tonight.
“I tried very hard to not have this happen. He must have snuck out of the kitchen.” Dean nervously laughed, pressing his thumb into the palm of his other hand. Castiel leaned forward and grabbed Dean’s hand, making him stop his nervous tick.
He let out a shaky breath and considered sleeping in his car. Where could he park so that John wouldn’t find them and they wouldn’t be interrupted? Nowhere that Dean could think of in that second. The fear and panic that gripped his body was beyond something he’d felt in awhile. John would have beat the shit out of him tonight. He’d been really drunk, Dean could hear that in his voice.
Cas smiled a little bit. “Yeah. People call me Jimmy because it’s my middle name. Castiel is my first name.”
The attention was dizzying. Cas only had him on his mind, only Dean, and nobody else. “I-I-I-” Dean stuttered, but he couldn’t stop himself. He couldn’t talk. He wanted to say thank you, to thank his soul mate, but he couldn’t get it out.
“Now that you’ve had your cookie you can go brush your teeth and get your jammies on. Yell for me when you’re ready to get into bed.” Sam reluctantly followed Dean’s orders and ran off to the bathroom. Cas turned to Dean with a smile on his face. “Now that we’re alone for a little while-” Dean cut him off by grabbing his neck and pulling his lips to his.
“Yeah it really is. I’m pretty sure Ellen didn’t even try to make this homey, it just happened.” Dean said and started walking over to a table. Dean sat them, which was weird because he wasn’t working, but he was sure that Jo would be okay with serving them.
“Dean.” Cas pulled back for a second to say his name, but Dean did not care and their lips met again. Cas moaned into his mouth, reaching up to feel his face. His face was burning hot, and when he pulled back again, Dean’s whole face was flushed. Dean’s eyes fluttered open and Cas could barely handle seeing him with his lips all swollen and his pupils dilated. Dean had taken in all of the grace he could give him.
Two o’clock came around quick enough, and Castiel took a deep breath, readying himself. He hadn’t teleported in awhile, not since Michael and him had gone looking for Lucifer. He clenched his jaw, closed his eyes, and he felt his feet land on the ground. He opened his eyes and recognized the room as Dean’s apartment.
“I don’t know, sweetheart.” Charlie rubbed his back, laughing a little bit. “Life really has it out for you.” And she didn’t even know the half of it. Just the Sam was his brother but Sam thought Dean was his father. She didn’t know about John or the hunting.
Dean kept his head on his desk all class just listening to Cas’s voice. He just couldn’t bare to look up. He was scared. When class was over, he lifted his head up and found Cas standing behind him, carefully looking. He took a deep breath.
Dean snapped him out of his thoughts. “I actually got these the other night. I fell pretty hard into some gravel.” Dean reached his arms out, showing off more of his bandages. Castiel didn’t know how he fell but he could deduce who had caused it.
“Shit man, you look terrible.” Dean made a face and Bobby’s hand came up and flipped him off.
“My letter’s are C and N, bud. Monster starts with M.” Sam gave him a pensive look and then finally came to his epiphany. “Cookie Nonster?”
“Dean, I understand that you’re taking in a lot of information right now, but if you have any questions or anything I just want to be here to support you-”
This was risky, because if Dean caught him they would have to have a very awkward conversation about boundaries. Cas really, really didn’t want to do that and he knew that the whole “watching you while you sleep” thing is definitely better than the whole “I’m a nephilim” thing. Cas knew that Dean would freak out, so he’d have to handle the situation very delicately.
He settled down at a desk, his backpack sprawled on the floor and his phone handy in his pocket just in case. Dean set his head down on the desk for what seemed like a millisecond, but when he picked his head back up Mr. Novak was looming right above him. Dean almost choked at how close he was, and Dean picked up his head all the way and sat up straight.
After all of the dust had settled, Dean made it back home to his apartment in one piece with Cas’s phone number calling him every night. School went by easy, and it was comforting to be in Cas’s class even. They saw each other once or twice a week outside of school, and things seemed to get a little easier day by day. Every once in a while he would go on a hunt and leave Sam with Charlie. Cas always joined, no matter who initiated the hunt. They’d gone on two with Bobby, three with Garth, and one with Ellen and Jo. All minor things, though. Hauntings, vampires, wendigos, and nothing on the demon front came up.
“I… need to pick up Sam’s at Charlie’s. It’s a little too late right now and I already feel bad…” Dean trailed off, unsure of what he even wanted in this situation. He wanted to stay with Cas, and talk about everything that just happened, but he had an obligation to get Sam.
“Dean.” He kept saying, voice soft, just feeling Dean’s warmth. He kneeled down and grabbed the bottom of Dean’s shirt, lifting it up. It revealed the new scar from the knife that his father had left on him and Cas ran his fingertips over it.
“I’m nervous.” Dean blurted out, and Cas couldn’t do anything but reach his hand out. There was nothing more he could say to help console Dean. He had said everything he could. They squeezed hands as Cas pulled into a parking spot.
Dean was lucky this was a good day. On bad days, Sam would cry and scream and cling to Dean with abandon. Some days Dean couldn’t even leave Sam. He would have to sit with him for hours and console him.
“Stay, Dean?” Cas’s eyes were full of hope as Dean looked hesitant, but ultimately nodded his head, setting down his backpack, and listening to what Mr. Novak had to say.
“Can I get you guys something to drink?” He pulled out his notepad and his pen, biting his lip. Mr. Novak uncertainly asked for a water, and the short, brown-haired man he was with asked for a beer. Dean nodded graciously, practically gnawing his bottom lip with anxiety. Dean got the order immediately, just wanting to get the awkward confrontations over with. Dean shook himself off, knowing that he needed the tips so he had to suck up. He grabbed the tray with the water and the beer, getting into a different frame of mind.
“Is the angel blade in a safe place?” Cas asked, trying to tread lightly around the entire topic because he knew the more he associated himself with the blade, the more Dean would associate him with it.
“Sammy,” Dean whispered gently, forcing Sam to calm down so he could hear the quiet words coming out of his mouth. “You know I have to go to school, and so do you. It’ll only be a couple hours, buddy-” More like eight hours, but the less Sam knew, the better. “-You can be a big boy for Daddy, right?” Sam pulled his face out of Dean’s shoulder and looked up at him with these big crocodile tears and blotchy cheeks. He nodded tearfully, big green eyes showing the internal conflict within him- being a big boy and staying with Daddy. He paused.
Castiel thought for a second and knew that he was happy with Dean’s knowledge of the unnatural, and that it would leave out a major source of guilt that Michael had to experience.
“A feeling? That’s weird, Bobby, I don’t like it…” Dean was suspicious now, but Bobby simply shrugged.
“It can kill anything. It is also one of the only things that can kill an angel or a nephilim. It is imperative you keep it safe.” Dean was deep in thought as he listened to the answer.
“I know you haven’t. We’ll make anything you want. Pancakes, bacon, waffles, sausage, eggs, hash browns-” Dean grabbed the sides of Cas’s face and their lips met in the middle. Cas made a surprised noise as Dean’s soft lips chastely pressed against his, but he quickly regained composure. He watched Dean’s soft face and closed eyes
“Dean, Dean-” The urgency in her voice sent an indescribably fear into his body. “Your father just walked in. You need to leave now.” Ellen looked over at Dean and the panic in her eyes frightened Dean even more. Jo grabbed his jacket and gave Dean a hug. “I’m gonna go stall him so he won’t come back.”
“I don’t know what to say. How can we even be soulmates if we aren’t even the same species? That makes no sense to me. It’s like some cosmic joke that you’ll live longer than me and I’ll probably die young due to some stupid hunting accident and how could you, a literal angel, be paired with me? I have a son and so much fucking baggage that I can barely even do anything for myself, let alone some I’m supposed to be a partner with!” Dean was getting visibly upset now and Cas’s heart physically  ached.
“You okay?” Cas asked, noticing Dean’s sudden change in demeanor. Dean cleared his throat and looked over at him.
“Finding your soulmate has made you a lot happier, you know that? At least you won’t be grumpy anymore.” A blush rose from his neck and settled onto his cheeks and he frowned playfully at her.
Bobby lunged forward and Dean started.
“It’s okay, Dean.” Gabe came down the stairs, and Dean’s eyes went to him. “Want me to get Sam and put him into bed?” Dean looked like he thought for a moment, and nodded. Gabe went over and grabbed Sam as carefully as he could. Gabe went back into the house, and Cas held out his arms to Dean. Dean looked at him, scared, for a second, but Cas reached his grace out to him. Dean stepped forward, and put his head on Cas’s chest.
“I’m sorry, Cas. I’m sorry for everything.” Dean spoke softly, and Cas was happy he was finally not crying.
“Dean, let’s get one thing straight.” Dean pulled his face out to look at Cas, and Cas’s heart broke at his teary eyes and blotchy face. “You are not a burden. You are not a financial burden. Your worries are my worries. Your happiness is my happiness. And your tears, are my tears. I need you to know that.” Dean nodded, his lip wobbling again.
“What does it do?” Dean asked, looking up at Cas and Cas sighed.
“Ellen, it’s okay. I need you to calm down. I’m going to explain it all to you guys tonight at the diner, okay? I called Bobby and he is going to meet us at the Diner tonight. I promise I’m okay.” Ellen let out a breath she had been holding the whole time, and Dean smiled a little bit. It was nice to have someone like this.
Dean breathed out, pulling back. “We’ll see. I’ll talk to him… do you, uh,” Dean uncomfortably shifted, blushing again. He cursed his stupid red cheeks. “Want to do something tonight? Maybe dinner?”
“This isn't the time.” Cas whispered back, and Dean groaned.
Cas snuck over, and looked over at Dean’s face. Without a single thought, his hand stretched out and gently rested on Dean’s forehead. He could feel the nightmares playing through him but he was extremely reluctant to look in.
Gabe sighed. “You’re so dramatic. Just touch him. Touch his neck, touch his hand, touch his-” “That’s enough, Gabriel. Get to the point.”
“C’mon Sammy,” He called out for Sam who was trailing behind him at the grocery store. Sam toddled over and grabbed onto Dean’s leg, and Dean leaned down and picked him up to put him into the cart. Dean settled down, trying to relax because he knew he had enough money for both rent and groceries this month. He half listened to Sam’s babbling, trying to plan dinners for the week.
“I think I would like to go to sleep right now or relax for a little bit. All my questions can be answered in the morning or later. Just… right now, I think I just want to pretend everything is normal and that nothing weird is happening.”
Bobby dropped off all the books he had that even mentioned the bible. Ellen, Jo, and Garth went through everything they had and dropped that off too. So Dean spent about seven hours researching angels, but he didn’t learn much. He simply found a set of wards that prevented angels from being able to locate or touch something. So he got out a cloth and painted the signs and then wrapped the blade up.
Gabriel reached out a hand. “I’m sure we can figure something out. As for now, just spend time with him. Heal him when he’s asleep, one injury at a time. Don’t touch the angel blade. If he thinks someone has taken it, he’ll probably really freak out. I think you should just lay low.”
There was a crash from upstairs, and they all looked at each other. They lifted their arms again, all pushing up the stairs. The house was eerily quiet, and absolutely abandoned. There hadn’t been people in this house for years. It felt dark, too. He could feel all of it.
“Thank you so much,” Dean sucked up as much as he could, hoping that this would both avoid questioning later on and maybe have a nice tip. Mr. Novak shook his head, smiling up at Dean. “No no, thank you Dean.” Dean hopped off, asking Sam what was wrong and going to put in the order.
“An… angel blade? I haven’t even seen one of those in real life. Just know what we’ve read about them.” Gabe asked, almost as dumbfounded as poor Castiel was.
“Dean, what happened to your arms?!” Mr. Novak sounded worried and Dean was temporarily taken aback. He wracked his mind for an excuse good enough to believe.
Mr. Novak flipped through his book, just looking through it. Dean watched him closely though and wanted to cry at the gentle look on his face. Everything about Mr. Novak was gentle. Dean would also literally kill for his voice.
“C-could I just sit here f-for a couple of m-minutes?” He gestured to a desk, and Mr. Novak nodded like it was an insane question. “Go-go ahead.” Dean slunk into a desk and put his head on the table, and he finally let the tears go now that no one would be able to see them. He cried into his arms, trying to keep the shaking at a minimum, and Cas watched him closely. No matter how hard Dean tried to hide it, Cas could clearly see the shaking of his entire body, and the general discomfort.
Castiel and Dean left the restaurant and drove back to the school, and they were soon at Dean’s car.
“Where are-” Cas cut him off before he could even ask.
“Can I call you Cas?” Dean’s voice was little, and Dean hadn’t felt this tiny in a long time. He was not timid, but when it came to this, he could barely even work up enough courage to touch his soulmate. Castiel looked over at Dean, relishing the moment.
Dean, coming back to his senses, realized where he was and what type of trouble this could get him into. He immediately pulled back, looking around the room, and deciding that running was the best idea. “I- Dean muttered, pulling all the way out of Mr. Novak’s arms. “-have to go.” And with that, Dean was out of Cas’s office, leaving a more than worried Cas making plans on what his next move was going to be.
“What’s the next move?” Gabriel sighed over the phone and there was some shuffling on his side.
Dean couldn’t do anything but stand there, dumbfounded.
Cas pulled out of Dean’s head, shaking himself off. He had never been in somebody else’s mind before, let alone his soul mates. The whole experience itself was moving, and he felt gratified at the peaceful look on Dean’s face.
Cas gasped as dark purple and blue colors were laid out like fireworks on Dean’s lower back and he sat back, astonished. “Why did you go back?” Dean winced as Cas’s voice sounded like he had been betrayed. Dean shook his head. “I needed a baby pictures of Sam for his class. So I went and I grabbed all the pictures and I thought I was in the clear but he caught me at the last second and fucking beat me senseless.” Dean was becoming angry and Cas set his arms on his shoulders.
He thought for a second, for one single second, that his soul mate shouldn’t care about his past. Maybe, just maybe, this would be a good thing. Dean made a split second decision in the second he was thinking that everything was going to be alright. No impulse control was always one of his problems, but he didn’t know that it was this bad. Maybe he should go talk to someone.
“Are you sure you’re okay? You look pale.” Cas commented, and Dean’s heart jumped into his throat.
“Are you working tonight?” Dean went to respond but suddenly a shorter man with dark brown hair appeared in front of them. Dean scrunched his eyebrows.
“Don’t be nervous.” Castiel squeezed his hand, and Dean’s heart fluttered. “O-okay.” Dean stuttered out, a red blush climbing his cheeks.
“Dean.” Cas cooed, and Dean went over to him and wrapped his arms around his neck. Cas lowered them to the bed, and Dean gripped on like his life depended on it. Cas left some words unspoken, letting Dean think all the things he needed to think.
Dean played with his fingers, nervously counting the numbers of bumps they went past. He couldn’t even really think of anything else other than the fact that his soulmate, someone whose whole life he was supposed to see, was not really a human and had been hiding it the whole time they knew each other.
“Daddy!” Sam exclaimed, as Dean reached the chair. Cas turned around and brightened when he saw Dean, but a frown quickly found his face when he noticed that Dean was in pain. Dean picked Sam up and put him on the ground, and grabbed the books off the chair and slid on. Sam followed suit and climbed up onto his lap, clinging onto his shoulders. Dean leaned forward a bit to help with the sharp pain that accompanied being up, and Cas found his way over to them.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean cooed, as he stirred in his arms. “We’re at the diner, okay? You can go back to sleep. I just need to talk to Uncle Bobby. I’ll put you in the back.” Sam snuggled his head back into Dean’s shoulder, and Dean took a big, deep breath before going in.
“I stumbled across something. Something big. Come in.” Dean walked in and saw at least twenty devil’s traps, every kind of sigil he knew plus some extra, and salt all around the room. Dean was a little freaked out because Bobby didn’t normally go to this extreme.
“What do you think about going to school tomorrow?” Cas tried to change the subject to something normal, something that will hopefully make Dean feel comfortable, but Dean heaved a big sigh. Cas stole a quick glance, and caught Dean looking at him.
Dean suddenly remembered that Sam was at Charlie’s house, and it was becoming increasingly late. He shifted in his seat, knowing that his phone was back at the diner and he couldn’t even call Charlie to tell her that he would be there soon to pick him up.
“We’re supposed to go to dinner tonight. What do you think I should wear?”
“Dean, so nice to finally meet you.” Lucifer smirked, and Dean’s face contorted in a confused, scared sort of way. The rest of the group stood behind him, unsure of what to do. Castiel stepped in between Lucifer and Dean, enraged that Lucifer even had the audacity to look at Dean.
Dean woke up about twenty minutes later, head pressed against the table and his eyes aching. His stomach churned, and he immediately knew that he was going to get sick. He quickly stood up, placing the sleepy Sam on the chair, and running to the trash can before getting sick. This grabbed the attention of Cas as his head swung over and looked at the hunched Dean over the trashcan, gripping his stomach. Before he could run over, Jo ran over and put both hands around Dean and helped him to the table.
“You’re dreaming of me leaving you?” Cas’s voice sounded almost betrayed and Dean felt guilt settle in his stomach.
A good month had passed since Dean had found out he and his brothers were nephilim, and it had settled very nicely in his opinion. They were taking things slow, too. As much as Cas wanted more, he knew that Dean needed his space to figure things out. However, Cas always insisted on going hunting with Dean. After all, Cas was powerful and a good addition to the team. He even liked going with him. It always surprised Cas how knowledgeable his soulmate was, and it was great to see him in his element.  It helped Dean’s closest friends get more comfortable with Cas, too.
Cas woke up with a start. It took a minute to have the fog clear up, but once it did, he understood exactly why he woke up. Dean was tossing and turning, shaking the bed to the point where he couldn’t go back to sleep.. Cas reached up and rubbed his eyes for a second, and then sat up in bed.
to have these feelings, you need to tell me. I am so…” Castiel looked for the right word. “That stings. I need to know these things. You caught me so completely off guard. Please, Dean, never do that again. Tell me. Show me. I don’t care how you do it, but you need to let me know.”
Dean sat in his desk, doodling pictures on his paper while he listened to Cas talk. It had been a couple weeks since the whole kiss and apparently, Cas decided that he was going to take Dean under his wing. As much as Dean loved it, he felt like a burden every time Cas checked up on him. At first it was weird going from Mr. Novak to Cas, but the more he says it, the more he loves the feeling it gives him.
“There are many nephilims living among humans. Angels, however, rarely live among humans and really only come to Earth to create nephilims. My father was an angel, but he lived here. One of the only ones to ever do that.” Cas tried to be as open with Dean as he possibly could be.
“We should get you someplace warmer first before we get into all of that. That’s gonna take awhile.”
“I’m so scared of John, Daddy.” Dean flinched, knowing that this was coming. Dean squeezed his eyes shut as tight as he could, and he wanted to let out a sad, frustrated sob. “You’re okay, buddy, you are. I would never let John touch you, ever.” Sammy trusted Dean more than anything in his life, but he had seen John lay hands on Dean so many times that he just couldn’t believe it. Sam had seen the bruises on Dean to know that he should be afraid of John.
Dean cut him off.
“Nothing John could ever tell me would make me leave you. Nothing you could ever say about your past could make me leave you. I’m really committed to you Dean, to us, to Sam, and I need you to know that. This is us now. It’s not just you, and it’s not just Sam. This is us.”
“You can play with your friends, and you can go out to recess and have fun and everything like that, right?” Sam nodded again, and Dean finally let the tension roll out of his body. Sam still clutched to Dean’s shirt, but Dean was now able to start moving towards the entrance to the daycare without Sam screaming bloody murder. “We’ll get ice cream after school today, okay?” Sam immediately perked up and smiled at Dean. “Really Daddy?” Sam reached his hand up and set it on Dean’s cheek, messily rubbing a hand through his hair.
“Sorry.” Dean mumbled into his hands, and Cas grabbed them.
Dean cleared his throat. “Maybe there have been some troubles in the family.”
“Dean, they know he’s my brother. They saw the white flash. They know this is not normal.” Dean cursed under his breath, as Cas brought up that point.
He turned his car off, and went to grab Sammy and his blanket. As he approached the front of Cas’s house, he could see that his lights were on and that there was a car he didn’t recognize outside of the house. Dean’s breath hitched in his mouth, and he stood at the stairs up to the door. He wracked his mind. It was way too dangerous to go back to the apartment or to Jo and Ellen’s. Bobby’s motel was close to the apartment building, and there’s a possibility John would see the Impala.
“Well- a little bit-” “How can you not trust me? Dean, I would never do that to you. Ever. I know you’re scared, but you have to trust me. We’re living together. Sam is practically my son. I just want to be with you, but you have this fear of me leaving you and it will freak you out so much and make problems. We need to get over this.”
Bobby started chanting Latin and Dean took a deep breath. He went through the words of an exorcism in his head, ensuring that he had it all down. Once Bobby finished, everything got eerily silent.
“That sounds great. You know where it is?” Dean asked, and Cas gave him a look. “Of course I do, Dean, I just saw a great deal of your life.”
“That’s exactly what I want.”
“Well, Bobby called and said he’s been tracking a demon.” He couldn’t help but smile at Sam’s giggles. But he continued. “So he’s picking me up here and we’re gonna eat some dinner. You mind watching Sam? He’ll probably fall asleep early, he had school toda-”
Dean’s face suddenly paled and he knew he was going to get sick again. “Pull over, quick!” He shouted, and Cas quickly pulled over and Dean hopped out of the car, getting sick on the sidewalk. He felt guilty, but he couldn’t help it; he wasn’t going to puke in his car, or in front of Mr. Novak.
Cas and Dean drove in silence. Dean, not knowing what to say, sat uncomfortably in the passenger seat and thought long and hard about his life. Cas sat next to him, worried that Dean was going to get a little lost in his own head.
Dean nodded, his bright, green eyes not moving from Cas’s.
He put it in the side of his car, which was covered in wards, sigils, anasazi signs, everything, so nobody could touch the blade except humans. He also grabbed a book on the language of angels, hoping that if something else came up that could aid him.
“Get back here, Dean!” John screamed, running after him. Dean flinched, planning his escape plan. He had just dropped Sammy off at school, and he knew that he couldn’t afford new clothes for Sam, so he’d have to go grab his old clothes for him. “I’m leaving, John-” Dean couldn’t even call him Dad anymore. “-leave me alone.” John blocked his way from leaving, and Dean internally screamed. “Boy,” John’s voice was slurred, and Dean couldn’t even begin to comprehend why he might have thought his dad had changed.
“I know you aren’t.” Cas’s voice was cool, to the point where Dean knew that Cas did not take that joke well. Dean straightened up, but Castiel soon recovered.
“Dean! Good to hear your voice. I’m in town- Market Street, right now, and I’m tracking a demon named Crowley. Heard he’s been causing trouble around here, making a ton of deals. At least six in the last month. Have you heard anything?”
“Shit,” Dean cursed, knowing that he had to be somewhere in the store. “Sam!” Dean tried again, hoping to get a response. In the adjacent aisle, Castiel had come to grab some rice for dinner with Anna and Gabriel, when a frightened, lost Sam ran into Cas’s leg and Cas picked him up. “Hi buddy,” Cas recognized him, but he couldn’t quite place where he knew the little boy from- probably from the preschool that he lived by, so he shrugged it off. “Are you lost?” Sam nodded, and Cas started to look around. “I lost my daddy.” Sam got quiet and shy, and Cas started looking. “What’s your dad look like?” Sam just shrugged, and Cas laughed a little bit.
“Who’s that?” Sammy pointed at Cas, and Dean sighed. He just had to get it over with.
Inside, Cas had a feeling he hadn’t felt. He felt… wrong. He felt like something was wrong, that something wasn’t right and he was worried. He checked his phone, and saw no texts or calls from Bobby or Dean, which meant he was probably safe.
thank you so so much for all your kind comments, seriously!!!
It had been a slow night, right until the point that they were hanging out in the kitchen and they heard the bell go off. Dean went to stand up, but Ellen waved him down to give him a break.
Dean woke up pressed against something warm and soft and when his eyes fluttered open, he was greeted by Cas’s sleeping body. Dean’s face was nuzzled into Cas’s torso and his arms were wrapped firmly around him. Dean couldn’t remember a lot from last night because the panic had settled in and he was just so worked up it was hard for him to remember. He did remembering coming to Cas’s, though, and how scared he was. He also remembers how safe Cas makes him feel.
“We can both lay in your bed. Maybe… talk, or watch a movie.” Dean shyly recommended and Cas’s eyes lit up like the fourth of July.
“Do you have any brothers?” Ellen asked, out of the blue, and Dean was somewhat taken aback. He’d never seen Ellen act like this before. Cas nodded, a bit confused about why she would ask a question like that.
Bobby looked for him, but eventually knew he just had to get out so he could get weapons more suited to fight it. Ellen and Jo searched but he could not use his voice to help them. He could not move, either. He was hit by wave after wave of nausea and everything was so overwhelming he couldn’t tell if he needed to throw up or not.
“Yes of course, right away.” Dean tried his hardest to sound cheerful, and was actually quite successful because he always got good tips… or maybe it was because he’s cute. Didn’t matter to Dean as long as he was getting the money.
Sam had finally begun to start calming down, tears only running down his face. “What’s wrong, buddy?” Dean asked softly, and Sam shook his head. “I had a bad dream.” Sam sniffled, pressing his face into Dean’s chest. Dean clicked his tongue and heaved a deep sigh. “Same thing?” Dean talked with a soft voice, and Sam simply nodded without a word. “Daddy can you go get my blanket?” Dean nodded, turning around and setting Sam on the couch. “I’ll grab your pillow too. Why don’t you talk to Mr. Novak?” Dean gestured to Cas who sat on the couch, and Sam shyly looked up at him.
“That does not sound pleasant. Are you taking care of them?” Cas asked, and Dean nodded in response. “As much as I can.” Dean shrugged.
He shivered thinking about the memory of his father lunging at him with a knife. He was just lucky it hadn’t gone deeper. He stitched himself up in his apartment bathroom, then went straight back to work. And that was the type of thing that he didn’t want his soulmate to see. As well as the vampires, the ghosts, the wendigos, the werewolves… he was getting off track, though.
Dean shook his head, going to grab his close to get dressed. He knew he had a long day ahead of him.
“Dean, you don’t deserve this.” Dean shook his head, raising his hands to his eyes and pressing down. Sam shifted and Dean suddenly turned his attention to him and sighed deeply. “That’s questionable.” Dean muttered, picking Sam up and bringing him into his own room. He tucked him into bed and gave the child one last glance before he sighed and looked back towards the door. He opened the door and locked eyes with a, now standing and frankly towering over Dean, Cas. “What do you mean ‘questionable’?” Cas’s voice was deep and a little threatening, making Dean pull back. Cas reached forward and closed Sam’s door, expectantly looking at Dean.
Little Sam’s arms were wrapped tightly around Dean’s neck, not letting go. “Daddy,” Dean cringed at the wail and rocked him back and forth. “I don’t wanna go, please.” The begs were heartbreaking and Dean almost got back in his car and drove both of them back to the apartment, but Dean knew he couldn’t do that.
“Hi Bobby.” Dean answered the phone.
“Lucifer…?” Dean asked reluctantly, really hoping that he heard it wrong.
“I could see myself eating here in the future.” Cas examined the menu, and then looked up at Dean. Dean could feel the warmth from Cas’s hand.
He practically hopped over to their table, smiling cutely. “Here’s your drinks,” He hummed sweetly, placing the stuff on the table and serving them. “Do you need a couple more minutes?” They both shook their heads, and Dean smiled. “Alright! What can I get yo-” He was cut off by a tug on his jeans, and he looked down to see Sam standing there and holding up his hands. Dean sighed and swooped down, picking up Sam and holding him close as Sam nuzzled his neck.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Of course I’ve looked. I just haven’t been able to get a good look at his wrist. But I’m telling you, he’s it. My initials are DW and his name is Dean Winchester. I just need to see his wrist. Or touch him. I’ve definitely never touched him. I would have remembered.”
“Jimmy… Novak?” Dean asked tentatively, and Charlie turned around, realization crossing her face. “Shit! I’m the worst. He doesn’t even go by Castiel here. Yes. Jimmy Novak.” If Dean were this man, he would be flustered, but he seemed to handle it with no problem at all.
“Your… English teacher…” Jo trailed off, but Ellen went into mom mode. “How old is he?” Dean shrugged, trying to think.
“We need to leave.” Dean practically ordered, pushing everybody out the door and down the stairs. “We are not supposed to be here.” They all ran towards the front of the house when black smoke burst through the door and started to surround the room.
“Sammy’s gonna like you.” Dean mumbled in his moment of happiness, but almost immediately regretted it. He looked over at Cas to gauge his reaction. Cas felt the change in Dean’s emotions almost directly after. He looked over at Dean, and gave him a sad smile.
“I promise I’ll leave after tonight.” Dean spoke with a small voice, and he could hear the sharp breath Cas took in.
“Pancakes. I have chocolate chips and blueberries, what would you like? Also, sausage or bacon?” Dean’s eyes found their way back to Cas, and Cas couldn’t take in the look on his face. He looked so grateful, so cared for, and Cas’s felt like he’d been punched in the stomach.
Dean breathed heavily, not even so much from the running. He was just overwhelmed. He was maybe gonna go to Bobby’s or to Ellen’s for the night. Just to get away. Castiel had to know where he lived now. He’d seen Dean drive, both legally and illegally, there a million times from his memories.
They picked Sam up at Charlie’s at around eleven p.m., and got to Cas’s about ten minutes later. Sam had fallen asleep at Charlie’s so Dean carried him to the car and then carried him into Cas’s house. It was just as Dean had seen in Cas’s memories. It was a fair size, all modern and painted white.
“Dean Winchester, correct?” Mr. Novak didn’t have to ask that, since he had already thought Dean’s name so many times. Dean dumbly nodded, looking down at his hands in his lap. Mr. Novak stood there for a second, before circling around to Dean’s back. “How are you doing?” Mr. Novak asked gently, his eyes scraping over the faint bruise on the back of Dean’s neck and the slightly noticeable scratch that started at the hem of his shirt. Dean shrugged, trying to open his mouth to say something but freezing up. Mr. Novak desperately wished to ghost his fingers over the bruise, but knew that that would not only violate his code of conduct, but it would scare the poor boy.
Dean sighed and looked in the mirror, cringing when he saw the forming bruise on his face. There was going to be a huge, nasty black bruise there if he didn’t get any ice on it. He thought for about a minute, deciding that his best bet was running to the teacher’s lounge and grabbing an ice pack from the freezer. Dean was invisible enough, and if he walked the hallway with a bunch of people, he would be fine. Dean begrudgingly got out of the car, knowing that even though he really didn’t want to do this, it was for the better. His bruise wouldn’t be nearly as bad, which means less questions will be asked. Dean slipped into the school, knowing it was in between periods, meaning everyone was in class.
Dean leaned down to get the shotgun, but that was soon thrown all the way across the street. The demon sighed.
Cas sympathetically reached forward and set his hand on Dean’s back, pulling him back into the car with a heave. “You okay?” Cas asked, and Dean abruptly nodded without a word. Cas sighed and leaned forward and put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s okay.” He rubbed up and down, and Dean almost teared up. That is, almost. He couldn’t take another hit by crying in front of Mr. Novak.
The door swung open and Bobby stood there, red, bloodshot eyes, with dark bags underneath.
“Your, um,” Dean blushed a dark red even with his strongest efforts not to as he looked at Castiel. “Piano playing is beautiful. I saw a lot of that in your memories.” Cas almost died at how cute Dean was, sitting across the table from him.
“Castiel?” Dean asked, reaching up and rubbing his eyes. Cas decided that he should just get away as quick as possible and hope that Dean thought it was a dream. But before he could get away, Dean leaned forward and set his head on Cas’s shoulder.
Cas couldn’t help but smile widely. He was almost astounded that Dean asked him to do something. “Of course I would, Dean.” Dean beamed, putting his hands together. “Great! What should we do?” Dean replied, and Cas put his hand on Dean’s cheek.
The fear was gnawing on the back of his mind for the whole fifteen minute ride, and he couldn’t even turn the radio on to drown out his thoughts due to the fear of waking Sam up. When he could finally see Cas’s apartment building he felt a little better.
“Dean, don’t be scared. Please. It would kill me.” Dean’s heart was beating out of his chest. Cas took a cautious step towards Dean, but when he saw Dean’s face he stopped immediately. That’s when a crashing noise from the house caught their attention, and they both turned towards it.
Cas’s hand slid up to Dean’s bare neck to the bare skin, so he could feel Dean. Dean was a wreck. He saw Dean sobbing in his car, so distressed, right outside of his house. That was the feeling. He was feeling Dean, right outside, so upset that he couldn’t breathe. He was so scared to come in, but why? Before Cas could get further into the night, Gabe slid by.
“No Dean, I’m sorry I raised my voice. Can I come in?” Dean nodded, and Cas allowed his grace to reach out and sooth his ailments. He relieved Dean again, another feat because he was so upset, but once Dean was calm in his arms, Cas let his grace stay. He shouldn’t have pulled it out in the first place, but he was shocked about Dean’s day.
“Because if you look that cute in your uniform every time you work, I definitely wouldn’t mind being here.” Dean couldn’t help but laugh, not only trying to keep the butterflies away but also trying to stop himself from blushing.
“That’s so cute,” Cas kissed Dean’s forehead. “I know, I’m a hopeless romantic.”
“You should get some more sleep, Dean. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“Dean,” Cas sounded pained, and Dean’s eyes filled with tears again. “What… why-” Cas cut himself off, trying to clear his throat. Cas had never been this confused, and upset. He had no clue where to even go after this. Dean was shaking in his arms, scared that he was going to leave him, break up with him, after showing him how much love he could have in his life.
Dean grabbed Sam’s school bag and turned around to get him an apple juice. Sam was sitting on his booster chair at the table, happily eating his breakfast talking about some friend named Lucy. Dean hummed in acknowledgement, prompting Sam to continue babbling.
“I’m nervous.” Dean admitted, finally feeling a little bit of it lift off his chest as he told Cas. “I… don’t know how they’re going to react. With what we do, I know they’re going to be really skeptical because… well, they didn’t see your life like I did.” Dean disclosed, with a little bit of heat on his cheeks.
“He’s outside. He came. I just wanted to explain some things first-”
“Stay out here.” Dean mumbled, and as he walked inside, he was met with four very angry looking people.
Dean stood up quickly, smiling. “Hi!” Dean ignored his nerves at all costs, and the smile that spread onto Cas’s face helped.
“Yeah, I promise. You ready?” Sam nodded and wiggled out of Dean’s arms, settling for the warmth of just the hand-holding. Dean dropped him off at his classroom with minimal tears, and sighed in relief as he got out of there with just enough time to get to his first period class... Of course, the teachers always had his number to call, but Dean would hope and pray that they wouldn’t. But that was only on the lucky days.
“What if I just don’t tell them? Say you’re a hunter and you were calle-” Dean started, but Cas had to cut him off.
“Don’t apologize. Not now and not ever. Are you tired?” Cas spoke with a kind voice, and Dean gently shut his eyes while he nodded.
Dean finished moving the last of his things into Cas’s apartment. He was not freaked out at all, surprisingly. Everything seemed normal, and Cas was off with Sammy in the kitchen singing some stupid song that he learned at Daycare. This was where he wanted to be. There was literally not where on the whole entire Earth where Dean would rather be.
“I know you have baggage. I’m not stupid. I saw your memories, I lived parts of your life that I never hope to see again. But I’m here for you, that’s exactly what this means. I’m here to be with you and to carry your baggage and fight your demons with you. That’s why I was put on this Earth, to be with you. I won’t ever let you think like that again. And the mere thought of you dying early on some
“Hi Cassie!” Gabe wrapped his arms around him and held him tight. “How are you? It’s been forever!” Cas smiled. “It’s been good! Nothing as exciting as you’ve been doing, I’m sure, Gabriel, but still good!”
“You have to go to Cas’s. He knows where we live, he’ll drive by later to make sure you’re not there with us. Cas is the only one who’s house has that private parking. You need to go there.” Dean nodded, going over the couch to grab Sam. He grabbed his little body quickly, and clutched it to his chest.
“You aren’t gonna get out of this.” Dean smiled into Cas’s neck, shaking his head.
He felt a sharp intake of breath from the person, and then they slowly let the air out.
Dean bit his lip a little bit, thinking about Cas’s father. He hadn’t seen much of him, glimpses and pieces, but Dean got the feeling that he was a big part of Cas’s life. Unlike Dean’s.
Dean grabbed his face and pulled it closer and Cas smiled into the kiss. He pulled back, and reached up to give Dean a kiss on his forehead.
“Angels? Not real.” The demon shrugged.
Dean woke up as the sun blared in his eyes, and he felt an emptiness next to him that made him sit up and look around the room. Cas’s room was empty, and he could hear some commotion outside the door. He rubbed his eyes and stretched his back, feeling a wave of nausea that was easy enough to ignore.
Dean could not bare to face Cas after that. Cas had such a nice life, and Dean was worth nothing. He had nothing except for baggage and a son. Nothing to offer. So he ran, and was hoping that he could run from this like he ran from everything else.
“May I… touch you?” Cas asked and Dean took a step back. “I-I don’t know.” He started, and the look of betrayal on Cas’s face made him hurt a little bit. “I’m sorry I-I-”
“I would be happy to do anything with you.” Dean shyly smiled, putting his head down.
They still made sure he was okay.
“He actually stabbed Dean with a knife. And Dean just went back to his apartment, stitched himself up, and went on.” Gabe sat there with an appalled look on his face.
Dean made it to school only two periods late. He had, however, missed Castiel’s class and he was worried that Cas had noticed. Dean got out of his door and slung his backpack onto his shoulder when it suddenly hit him like a ton of bricks: he didn’t hurt. At all. Literally nothing hurt on his body.
Dean was curled up and asleep, blanket after blanket piled up on him because he didn’t have enough money to pay for the heat. “Daddy,” A small voice woke him up and Dean’s fatherly instincts kicked in and his eyes snapped open.
“Are you sleepy?” Cas asked, knowing that he was willing it to happen. Dean nodded, his eyes shutting, and he snuggled into Cas’s body.
Gabe shrugged. “I asked him if he knew where your classroom was outside and he was very surprised to learn that your first name was Castiel. He thought it was Jimmy. But when I told him he got really pale. He even looked… scared. I dunno. Just thought it was weird.”
“Are you okay?” Castiel spoke, and Dean nodded fervently. He kept his eyes glued out the window, looking at the passing scenery. Dean anxiously pressed his thumb into the palm of his other hand.
“Absolutely.” Cas grabbed Dean’s hand. “Let’s go.”
A bright light at the top of the hill got their attentions very quickly. It became so bright that they could no longer look at that. They all shielded their eyes, walking carefully towards the light. A shrill noise accompanied the light.
“That’s okay,” Castiel wanted to go home too, but he wanted Dean to come with him. Dean didn’t seem as into the idea as much as Cas did, so he didn’t press. “You should go home. Maybe sleep. You seem tired.”
Dean looked down and realized how close Cas had gotten as they were talking and a shiver climbed up Dean’s back. Dean could feel Cas’s breath on his lips, and all of Dean’s fears and worries practically flew out of his body. His thoughts halted and froze and all he could pay attention to were Cas’s lips. “Dean you’re just- you deserve so much and you don’t have it,” Cas was rambling but that was fine because Dean’s sole focus was on the way Cas’s lips moved.
“Like… like what?” Dean looked down at Sammy. “Just…” He could barely even talk; his mind was screaming at him to stop, to stop talking right this instant and run because that’s all he’s ever known, but something willed him to stay. “My mom died about a month after Sam was born, and my father-” He shuttered to call that man his own family. “-didn’t take it well.” Cas grabbed Dean’s wrist and dragged him down on the couch with him. “Dean has your father ever hurt you?” Dean looked the other way towards Sam, not opening his mouth.
where is this story going? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ thanks for sticking along!!!
With that, they talked until the late hours of the night, and it only stopped because they’d fallen asleep, together, pressed up on the couch.
“I-it was John… and I mean, you can pretty much get it from there.” Dean did not want to mention that Cas was there too. It was too much right now. “Just the usual? Nothing else?” When Dean had nightmares, it usually wasn’t like this. This time seemed worse.
Bobby answered, obviously out of it.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas looked around, studying the surroundings. “This is a very… comfortable place.” Dean laughed, understanding exactly what he meant.
“I met my soulmate.” Dean reiterated, and Jo’s face lost all of it’s color.
“Nothing about your life will burden me, Dean. Don’t ever worry about that.” Cas whispered in his ear as they walked into the restaurant and Dean couldn’t help the shy smile that lifted his lips.
He saw the love that Dean had for Sam. He saw every inch of their apartment, every time the first aid kit had to be used. He felt all the physical pain Dean had been through, and he shuddered to think about all the mental pain. He saw so many demons. He saw the fire on his baby brother’s ceiling. He saw his mother burn. Even before that, though, he could feel pain. However, he wasn’t sure where it came from.
Dean agreed, rubbing his eyes.
“Do you feel odd?” Cas asked Gabe, who was sitting next to him, doing research on the ancient Enochian spell book they had gotten their hands on earlier that week. Gabe looked up at him, with an inquisitive look.
“There’ve been some electrical disturbances about twenty minutes away. We’re thinking about going just to see what happens. Just a recon mission. Hopefully we’ll catch one and be able to interrogate it.” Ellen was so practical and Dean admired her so much.
Castiel carefully pushed the bandages down and he almost cried out. His initials, his own initials were on Dean Winchester’s body for the rest of eternity.
Dean and Bobby nodded, at the will of Ellen.
Dean saw light from underneath the door and he hissed at his partners, and they all turned back. Dean kicked the bottom of the door, lifting his own gun and getting ready to shoot. The door swung open, smashing into the back of the door, and left Dean looking at something that shocked him.
“He’s-He’s not human-” Ellen cut Dean off. “Well no shit, Sherlock. What the hell is he?!” Another demand.
Granted, it had only been about a week and a half since they had actually found out they were soulmates, but it almost felt like a lot longer. Dean knew that feeling betrayed was a little too much, but he couldn’t help feeling it.
(See the end of the chapter for
The ride to the Diner was short, and Ellen was surprised when Dean walked through the door. “Hi Sugar!” Ellen greeted, shaking her head. “You aren’t supposed to work today! What brings you in?”
“No fucking way.” Bobby stretched his back and let out a laugh. “He just healed my back! My damn back! Been hurtin’ me for twenty years!” Dean couldn’t help but laugh at it, and the atmosphere in the room immediately changed. There was a lighter feeling, and Dean could tell it wasn’t going to be as bad as he thought. Cas sent him a look that said
“Sam!” Cas exclaimed, kneeling down to pick the boy up as he ran to him. “Hi Cas.” Sam muttered into his shoulder and Dean laughed. “I made some lasagna and a salad.” Cas walked over to Dean and pecked his cheek, setting Sam down on the ground so he could get dinner set up.
“You’re such a good kid, Dean. Your grades are tip top, you’re a great father… and brother, and god, your personality is just great and-and I want to help you. I really want to help you.” That struck Dean in an odd way- was he there just to help Dean? Did he want to take Dean up as a charity case? He tried not to look at it that way, because honestly, this meant so much to him. He couldn’t believe that he had someone like this. Dean’s eyes filled up with tears and he angrily lifted his hand and wiped at them.
“How are you feeling?” Cas eyed Dean, but Dean simply shook his head.
“You don’t remember that?” Dean shook his head and turned to look back at the house. Cas worriedly examined Dean’s face, looking for any lacerations. Dean just looked at Cas, noticing how his face was so distressed.
Dean seemed to get the hint: he knew something bigger was at play. He knew that they shouldn’t be there.
“You owe me one, Dean-y!” She called after him, and he laughed.
It was hard for Cas to get through because he just desperately wanted to feel Dean’s skin. He wanted to share the bond that only him and Dean could have. He knew that there could be doubt that Dean was even his soulmate, but Cas felt it. He knew that Dean was his. He was sure of it.
“Why?” Dean asked curiously, wondering if it was the food or the atmosphere, or maybe even both.
Dean was in the passenger seat of his English teacher AND soulmate’s car. He wanted to say it wasn’t awkward, that he and his soulmate just clicked so well that they were already close, but it was awkward. Dean didn’t know what to say, and his throat was so uncomfortably tight he didn’t even know if he could say anything.
“What’s wrong with Lucifer?” Cas was dreading this question, and he wasn’t quite sure how to answer it.
He was so lucky he started parking in the back when Ellen noticed John had been driving by the restaurant. He left his lights off, slowly moved the car, and took the right out of the restaurant lot. He still couldn’t breathe, still couldn’t move. His heart had to be beating a million miles a minute. His head throbbed and he was so
Cas stood up and stretched his back, going to get a glass of water for Dean when he wakes up. He puttered around for a bit, silently hoping that Dean would be finished with his nightmare and he could go back to sleep. When he went back to bed though, it was apparent that was not the case.
“Can you guys tell me where Castiel’s room is?” Dean blinked his eyes and looked over to Charlie. She shrugged, giving him just as a confused look.
Dean slid into a desk, taking a deep, soothing breath. He grabbed his research book out of his backpack, and flipped to the page he left off on. He was supposed to be looking for a special way to kill them, but he hadn’t had any luck so far.
“Hey, hey,” Cas started with a small, gentle voice but when Dean didn’t respond, it clicked. He was having a nightmare. Cas knew he wasn’t supposed to wake somebody up during a bad dream, and the looks of Dean face made it pretty clear that he was indeed having a bad dream.
Every memory was accompanied with a feeling that Dean had never felt. It felt almost… inhuman. Like Castiel felt things differently, saw things differently. Dean tried to probe into the memories, to see more of something that looked like a bright light, something special about Castiel’s father, but it was almost like something was controlling what he saw. It just kept going without Dean being able to see.
“He’s in bed, Dean. I hope you feel better. Call me if you two need anything.” Gabe said his goodbye, and Dean listened to his footsteps to the car, then the door close, then the car turn on and leave. Cas went back to Dean’s mind, to figure out what happened, but he was met with a barrier.
Dean was getting too much information. He was confused and scared and just overwhelmed.
“I’m trying to do something nice. You’ll need this.” Dean snatched the weapon, moving back again. Dean started. “What is this and why are you giving this to me?” Dean suspiciously examined the knife. It was unlike anything he had ever seen; it was long, silver, triple sided and heavy.
“You would not believe what I’ve been up to. But, something else first. You know a guy named Dean?” Castiel’s heart sped up. “Yes, if you’re speaking of the same I am thinking of. If so, he’s one of my students. Why?”
Cas was driving insufferably slow and careful, one because he didn’t want to jostle Sam around in the back, two, because this wasn’t his car, and three, the most important reason, he wanted to have as much time with Dean as he could possibly get. Cas hopes with every encounter, he is one step closer to helping Dean.
“I guess wake him up. He’s been napping for a little bit. I can go get him.”
He was in the living room. Everything was quiet and dark, and Castiel could see all of the precautions against the world. There were sigils and wards and Castiel was just lucky that he didn’t put any against angels, like the angel blade. There was salt all around the corners and Castiel knew how scared he was against a surprise attack.
All eyes fell on him and Cas had to swallow the lump in his throat.
Cas showed Dean the guest room, where he set Sam down and tucked him in. He was fast asleep and barely even noticed that he was in a different home with different people. Dean gave him a kiss on the forehead, took a deep breath, got his priorities straight with Sam and his safety directly at the top, and then he headed back to where Cas was.
Sam started kindergarten this year and Dean was so relieved that he didn’t have to pay for daycare anymore. It also gave Sam the chance to meet so many more kids and to be mentally stimulated, which Dean suspected was not really happening at daycare. Dean realized that Sam was so smart, too.
“Trying to exorcise a team player? I thought you were smarter, Dean! You were smart enough to get lead here by this other hunter, but stupid enough to challenge me?!” Dean pulled back, gasping in a breath. “How do you know his name?!” Bobby demanded, and the demon simply shrugged.
“Please.” Dean pleaded, full of Cas’s grace, full of all of this love, and want. Cas simply leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Dean and pulled him into his chest. Dean’s cheek leaned on the bare skin, and his eyes fluttered shut, suddenly sleepy.
“Where did he get it?” Gabe demanded an answer, and Castiel shook his head. “I don’t know. I didn’t see that at all. He doesn’t believe angels exist, but someone, or something, told him they did. I couldn’t see who or what. But he knows they’re powerful. He’s been… researching angels, and he painted wards on a cloth and surround the angel blade. It makes it so angels, nephilims, and even prophets can’t touch it.”
“So hurt.” Cas breathed, and Dean grabbed his hand firmly and pressed it to the scar. It was like he didn’t even have control of his actions.
sorry i suck omg
“Let’s go get dressed for school buddy, come on. We have some clothes in your new room.”
Dean paled as Charlie made all the connections in her head. He looked like a deer in headlights.
“Feel what?” Bobby asked, and Dean grabbed his stomach and kneeled to the ground. Pain swirled around his body and blackness started to invade his vision. Everyone turned back towards him.
“Do you feel better?” Cas, although he didn’t want to, made Dean as sleepy as possible so he wouldn’t remember this in the morning. Dean hummed, reaching forward and grazing Cas’s neck.
“Can we try it this time and see how you like it? I can feel your discomfort. I think it is anxiety, not the remnants of the smiting sickness. I do not wish for you to feel this way.” Cas’s voice was genuine, and Dean swallowed the lump that was forming in his throat. He looked up at Cas, with some uncertainty, and Cas’s eyes softened. “Trust me.”
“I took a big hit back there. I don’t even know what happened.” Dean nodded, closing his eyes tight. He was thankful the headache had faded away with the poor vision. He thought about trying to get up for a second but decided it would be better if he stayed down on the ground, with Cas. Cas knew exactly what was ailing him, a particularly bad case of smiting sickness. Cas was unsure of why Dean had gotten it so badly, though.
“I touched Dean.” Gabe’s face lit up but it got considerably more concerned when Cas’s tone of voice registered. “And…?” Gabe prodded. “You don’t like him?”
“He’s not the biological father, it’s his five year old brother. A demon killed their mother in a fire, and their father had not taken it well. His father kicked them out of the house when the little one was just a baby. Dean was only fourteen.” Gabriel looked horrified, and Cas continued.
He shot off all the questions, and Dean rolled over and pressed his face into the pillow.
Castiel froze and his fingers ghosted over the letters he knew he was on his wrist. “I think Dean is my… soulmate.” Castiel whispered the word soulmate as if it were a taboo word. “WHAT?!” Gabe roared, a happy look on his face. “He is so hot! Like, Cas, ruggedly hot. Like seriously. And young too! Oh my god, is he even legal?!”
“Weird dream.” Dean mumbled, raising his hands and feeling Cas’s body under him. Castiel did not dare to move a single muscle as Dean’s fingers wrapped around his arm. Although he feared Dean’s reaction, he enjoyed the surprise contact between the two of them.
“But things are finally looking up.” And Dean couldn’t help but think it was probably because of Cas.
“Well, he’s just been doing some pretty weird stuff recently. I’m not even really sure what he’s been up to, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it were bad. I’m sorry that Ellen knew him before she got to know me.” Cas was pretty straight to the point, with only one lie in there. He knew that Lucifer was consorting with demons, but that was about it. Lucifer was MIA too, so he and his brothers couldn’t even figure out what was happening.
“It wasn’t always like this.” This startled Cas out of his thoughts, and he looked to the right of him at a sick, pale Dean. “I wasn’t always this quiet. I would have made conversation with you, but now I’m just scared.” Cas was shocked at how Dean’s words just kept flowing from his mouth, like he was going to tell Cas his whole life story. Happiness struck Cas deep in his core.
“Yes. I have vigils around it so nothing can touch it.” Cas nodded, gently rubbing Dean’s face with his thumb.
They made it to the door and they all pulled out their guns, except for Dean. Dean had his knife, carved with sigils in one hand and his flask of holy water in the other hand. He sure hoped that it was demons behind that door.
“Why are you scared? Are you scared of me?” Dean shook his head immediately. “Of course not. Just… scared of talking.” This was really the first time Dean had talked to anyone about what was on his mind in years. “You can always talk to me.” Dean gestured to the apartment building right across the street, and Cas turned in. “I know.” It ended with that, and Cas could have screamed at how happy he was to have Dean open up, even if it were only a little bit.
“You better not be laughing at my shower curtains,” Dean coughed out, but Cas could hear the smile in his voice. He sighed gently and opened the mirror, noticing all of the gauze and antibacterial cream he had. He would have most definitely cringed if he knew exactly what those were for. He grabbed the thermometer and brought it to Dean, urging him to open his mouth.
“Then what are you?” Dean asked cautiously, gritting his teeth. Dean took a hot second to categorize everything in his mind. When the boxes soul mate and non-human crossed in his mind he got the sudden urge to scream as loud as he possibly could. He must have been a really shitty person in his past life to deserve something like this.
After that brief second though he was brought back down to Earth with the thought of Lucifer.
“I…” Cas trailed off but he decided that he was just gonna tell nothing but the truth. He thought for a second that maybe he should lie, but he just couldn’t bare to lose Dean’s trust if he ever found out. “I did. You were just so hurt, and I couldn’t bare to feel it anymore! Dean you had so many broken ribs and cuts and bruises on your bones, I had to do something! Thinking about you in pain is bad, but imagine being able to
“This is Castiel, one of my friends. Can you say hi?” Sam shyly put his head into Dean’s shoulder, waving over to Cas.
“Well it’s pretty much the same things, like Sammy getting hurt or John hurting me but now it’s more about John getting to you and making you leave me because he tells you how terrible I am or what if he even hurts you? I dream about that a lot too, like I come back and you’re gone and I don’t know if it’s because John hurt you or John told you about all of this shit I’m dealing with or-” Cas cut his long-winded confession off.
“I saw your childhood house, which is beautiful. I saw your father and your brothers. I saw so much piano it isn’t even funny.” Cas still laughed, though. “I saw your roommate in college, Meg.” Dean thought about the demons he saw and whether or not to bring that up, but he decided not to, at least now.
“Dean, I will not say it again. You are welcome at my house anytime. You can show up at any time of the night, and I will be there for you. You don’t even need to call.” Dean felt his stomach flutter with nervousness and hopefulness. Anytime was a word Dean didn’t take lightly. Anytime means Dean has the beginnings of a home, with his soulmate.
“It’s chicken noodle soup. Are you hungry? I can take it back if you aren’t-” Dean cut him off. “I’m fine, don’t.. trouble yourself anymore.” Dean couldn’t eat; at this point he felt too sick to even move. Cas swallowed the lump in his throat, digging his nails into his own palm to try to keep himself from falling apart. Cas went over and closely examined the bruise on Dean’s face. Dean took in a deep breath as Mr. Novak’s fingers trailed along the edge of his face at his hairline, and he almost screamed when he traced his fingers across the black and blue.
