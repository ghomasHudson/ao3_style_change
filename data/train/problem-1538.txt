“Yeah,” John says leaning against him, “What do you say we don’t tell your mum? We just suddenly have another kid around the house, and just never explain to her why or how that happened.”
“Convenient free babysitting,” Sherlock says with a nod of his head.
“Right then,” John says giving him a smile, and then leaning forward and giving him a peck on the lips, “I’m going back to work, you should probably stop in and let Mrs. Hudson know you haven’t been murdered pretty soon.”
“Sherlock, that’s all okay, she’s fine,” John says handing Rosie the milk. She drinks it like her life depends on it, which only makes Sherlock feel worse.
“I’m really sorry that happened to you,” John says seriously. “I promise you, I will not do that to you. You are not the first bloke I’ve been with, and you are not an experiment. I can just as easily see me ending up with a bloke as I can with a woman. I promise.”
Then she had a proper meltdown-at a park, in front of a very judgmental mommy and me group full of parents who had kids far younger than Rosie. Sherlock plopped down on the Earth next to her in one of his dramatic moods, and she moves over to snuggle him.
“No Night! Tea!” Rosie says.
Sherlock stands up, and hands her over to John, working hard to make sure that his face doesn’t show how crushed he feels at the idea of not being good enough for Rosie.
“I understand,” Sherlock says.
It’s better when there is a child in between them, and all they are doing is PG cuddling. It’s comfortable, and it’s made him the happiest that he’s ever been.
“Careful, with an offer like that I just might stay forever,” John teases.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says not looking at him.
John smiles as he comes up the stairs. Sherlock is asleep on the couch with Rosie spread eagle on his chest. John isn’t exactly sure how she can sleep rising up and down with Sherlock’s breath. The room looks worse than the various times that it’s been bombed apart from the fact that instead of debris it’s Rosie’s toys. John turns the flash off on his phone, and snaps a quick picture, and then, because he can’t resist, he snaps a few more. Then he grabs a box off the floor and puts some toys into it.
“What?” Sherlock asks in surprise.
Sherlock licks his lips nervously and then stands up. John takes a step forward, and their lips meet. It’s chase and sweet, and Sherlock finds himself wanting a lot more when John pulls away. John smiles at him for a couple seconds and then leans forward to give him another kiss, which lasts a lot longer and leaves Sherlock feeling much more fulfilled when they actually pull away.
When John comes home Rosie nabs the book out of Sherlock’s arms, and runs toward John, “Tango! Me Tango!”
Sherlock stares uncertainly at Rosie, who is now popping some of the food which survived being thrown earlier into her mouth. “I would like to keep trying, at least if you don’t think I’m doing her harm. I enjoy spending time with her, I do, John, I just don’t know anything about taking care of a kid.”
“Yeah, I’ll bet. It’s a form of neglect,” John says seriously.
“It’s damp down there, and I don’t want Rosie to be around that,” Sherlock says with a shake of his head.
She nodded seriously, “Daddy, and daddy.”
Sherlock shakes his head.
“Thank you Mrs. Hudson, and I’m so sorry that we put you out.”
“Rosie really likes to socialize with her friends,” Sherlock says with his face falling as he feels like his plan is falling apart.
“Listen, Sherlock, we don’t have to have a ceremony if you really don’t want to, but honestly I think it would be pretty adorable to see Rosie walk down the aisle as a little flower girl. The thing that really matters to me is that we are going to have a marriage together.”
“Oh,” Sherlock looks alarmed at what he is working on. “I’m going to need five minutes to stop the reaction and clean up enough to be safe. You don’t have to entertain than though. Just tell them you need to change Rosie’s diaper and disappear into the bedroom.”
“To be fair, you had already told Angelo that you weren’t my date before I said that. I’d already felt quite exposed, and didn’t want to continue to feel like that.”
“Shut up!” John explains.
“I don’t want to date anyone else. I’m interested in you.”
“You don’t have to clean up after her,” Sherlock says from the couch.
Rosie and John have been at Baker’s Street for just under a month and even though Rosie’s things have taken over the room, the bed is still there. Sherlock sits down on it, pulling Rosie to his chest.
John was right to be leery about the fact that he could do this. He brushes a bit of hair from her sleep sweat soaked face, and wonders if John’s hair was so light it was almost white when he was her age. Was it that thin, too?
“Rosie, come on, Sherlock is going to take you home now,” the worker says, and this time a small whimper comes out of the girl.
John smiles. “Yeah, there are lots of Tangos. Maybe we are going to have to find one for you to play with!”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “You’ve moved Rosie recently, and if I were the one to move out, then you could have continued access to Mrs. Hudson for babysitting. I am sorry that I asked you to move in here under false pretenses.”
“I’m so sorry, baby girl. I feel asleep, and didn’t remember to pick you up.”
“I’m really not mad at you, Sherlock, but I am concerned. Sleeping a lot can be a sign of depression, and I think that might be true for you.”
“We say who when we are talking about people,” he corrects.
“Actually,” John says, looking around, “Lately it really has been.” Even if that was only because Sherlock had moved all of his experiments up to John’s old room, that didn’t mean that they couldn’t figure something out if he was to move back here. “Is this just something you are saying, because she was just dripping cuteness all over you or are you serious?”
Rosie grins at her and gives her leg another hug. John puts the bags in the tea only a few seconds before the kettle flips to off. He pours a full cup into all but his daughter’s cup, and for her he gives only a fourth a cup.
“And we’re not having the wedding in a church. In fact, I would prefer if we just kept the ceremony between the two of us, although I would be willing to endure a party with our friends after if it’s important to you.”
She bolts out of the tent and latches herself onto Sherlock’s legs. He scoops her up and leaves without looking at the worker’s eyes, which he is sure is judging.
“And the sex holiday. You had a sex holiday with Mary, don’t think you are going to get away not having one with me as well,” Sherlock warns him.
“We could have been if someone hadn’t been so eager to tell me he wasn’t interested in dating the first night that we met.”
“No,” John says, shaking his head, “And it makes perfect sense that your childhood was not exactly easy with the way that you interact with people. You expect people to be mean to you, and no one reaches that point unless many people have been mean to them over time.” John reaches out his hand to touch Sherlock’s hair.
“Oh shit,” John flinches, “Please tell me I didn’t just out you?”
“You mean like getting called a freak?” John asks softly.
Sherlock nods. “When I was a little kid, I always felt like she didn’t hear me, didn’t see me. She was interacting with some imaginary son that she wished I was or something. It made me feel terrible.”
“No,” Sherlock says sadly, “I might have like John, but he did not return the favor. He was loyal to his wife. She died a year a half ago, and our moving into a more romantic relationship is quite recent.”
He puts her down in her highchair and gets her a banana. “Do you want some tea?”
“Well, I don’t plan on leaving you for someone else,” John says with a face of concern.
Sherlock looks alarmed when he pulls away. “I wasn’t really planning on telling my parents about our relationship,” he says.
“Not really, I just made her cry, because I forgot toddlers don’t understand time besides things like ‘later’ or ‘after this that’.”
“You want to tell me about what happened in the dream, baby girl?” Sherlock coos.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock assures him.
“Do you want us to move out?” John asks.
“It’s mostly just that I don’t want our child to spend their whole life getting ‘treated’ for being autistic, so they never get to do anything that would actually result in them enjoying themselves.”
Sherlock chuckles at that. He can’t believe John is so understanding about his strange relationship with his mom, particularly since Sherlock cannot define what the relationship between him and his mom actually is.
“Okay,” John said, not sounding angry at all.
“I’ve reached the point in my life that I am no longer sure that being a freak is so terrible. I know I would not want to be like them,” Sherlock says.
“Huddes?” Rosie asks.
“Oh my God! I’ll go her right now!” Sherlock says, heading toward the door.
Rosie’s head pokes out from a small tent in the corner, and then it pokes back in. Sherlock’s heart clenches within him. She doesn’t want him, she’d rather stay here. And who was he to take her away from what she wanted?
“Daddy!” Rosie exclaimed, pointing at part of a muffin which was on the floor.
“That doesn’t entitle her to being treated nicely every single time she shows up in my flat.”
Sherlock creeps up the stairs and crawls into John’s bed. It’s something that he has started doing far more often, although he still feels like he is going to be rejected every day.
“Oh,” John says seriously, “You thought we were on a date?”
“Yes? Did you learn about them in school?”
“Because I love you.”
John gives his hand a reassuring squeeze before withdrawing his hand in order to go back to eating his dinner. “Maybe we can help some kid get to that point in their life without having to go through all the other stuff first.”
“Okay,” Sherlock says so honestly that John is staggered by it.
John chuckles at that. “Is it okay if I give you a kiss?”
“Daddy,” Rosie sniffs.
Sherlock nods, feelings as if his entire body is on fire as he never has before. John’s kisses are sweet and deep, and he is hovering over Sherlock for only a couple of minutes before he is down on top of him. Sherlock lets out a shuttering sound. John pulls back and runs his hand over Sherlock’s hair.
“It’s not the right speed for you?” John asks softly.
“It’s fine,” John says, giving him a smile.
Mrs. Holmes touches Rosie’s head.
“I would be honored to co-parent with you, John,” Sherlock says with seriousness in his voice.
“Tango!” Rosie says.
Sherlock memorized the book three readings ago. He enjoys the book far more than most of the children’s books that he’s ever read in his entire life, but Rosie has still worn him out.
John bites his lip, and looks at Sherlock in confusion. “I don’t understand then. You were so uncomfortable the other night.” Then John’s face falls, “Oh, I see, that had to do with how close you were to me, and nothing else.”
John looks at Sherlock.
“Yeah, I’m not sure how much help this would be at a crime scene, actually,” John says with a chuckle.
“I’m not excited by Rosie’s accomplishments because she is gifted. I’m excited, because I enjoy her. I would be just as excited if her accomplishments came months or years later than they are coming.”
“If you’re opposed, it’s fine. It is certainly the type of thing that both partners would have to be interested in.”
“Yes!” Rosie says.
“Ice ceam?” Rosie asks.
“Okay, yeah,” John says, putting his things down. He reads the book once with a smile on his face. That makes the coil of nerves in Sherlock’s stomach unleash quite a bit (although not completely).
“Fucking amazing,” Sherlock mutters, drawing a chuckle from John. “I want to do that forever,” Sherlock says.
“Thank you for looking after her,” John says sincerely as he shifts her body, almost waking her up.
Sherlock is wearing his googles at his should-be-a-kitchen-but-is-really a-chemistry lab. “Your parents are upstairs,” John tells him.
“You don’t want me to do this?” Sherlock asks insecurely.
Rosie responds to the touch of attention by holding up her tea and saying, “Locky, tea! Rosie tea!”
“Locky is here!” Rosie says cheerfully, and whatever sadness she might have felt about not being picked up when she was supposed to is gone.
“Your kid is cute,” one of the other men (Sherlock has not bothered to remember his name).
“No, we’ve not even been dating a month, and we’re not really living together. I am in the flat downstairs if you didn’t notice, and we actually were roommates for years without being romantically involved, so even if we were living together it might not mean nearly as much as you seem to think that it does.”
No, it was really best that Sherlock didn’t get too attached, because inevitably, John was going to leave him again. It was best to start preparing right now so that his heart would break less when the separation actually happened later on.
John smiles. She hadn’t exactly answered the question in words, but she had answered the question’s spirit. “Okay, well Rosie, there are a lot of families that have a Mummy and a Daddy, but not all families.”
“I won’t do it anymore since it is risking missing the time to take care of Rosie,” Sherlock says.
“Yes, no night time, you get to stay up.”
“Oh,” John says, “It’s called penguin, actually.”
John found another gay couple who had a child about Rosie’s age, and he set up a play date with them in the park. Usually, John handled this sort of thing, but he thought it would be important to Rosie that both of them would be there so he drug himself along.
“Oh, I’d never considered that.”
“No problem,” Mrs. Holmes says, smiling the little girl who is building with blocks on the floor.
“No,” John says with his shoulders slumping, “She’s a toddler, and they scream. I shouldn’t have let you do this. I knew it would be too much for you.”
John lets out a long breath. “It’s not that I don’t think that you know what you are getting into, but can we start small? I can switch her day care to just mornings, and you’ll have her all afternoon. If you don’t get sick of her, we can switch it all over.” John looks at him in confusion for a bit longer. “Are you serious about giving up cases?”
“Okay,” John says with a smile. “Then I think we’ll put the nursery in your old room after all, it’s a bit larger, and then we’ll be better able to hear her when she wakes up from a nap or when we put her down at night.”
Sherlock pokes some food around his plate and wants to avoid the conversation so much that he actually puts some of it in his mouth. When he is done chewing he says, “I relate to many of the things which are shared in online communities relating to autism spectrum disorders.”
Sherlock clears his throat, “That emotion, it’s returned you know.”
The man smiles at him vaguely, and then turns back to look at their children, which aren’t exactly playing with each other so much as playing near one another.
“Dot!” the girl says, touching her leg again.
Sherlock grins. “The idea of being a family with you and Rosie, it fills my heart until I feel like it is going to overflow. I... might have researched whether I was having a heart attack a couple of times.”
The sugar hits Rosie at four pm, which is only a bit before John comes home. Sherlock is frantic to cover up how poorly he did, and so he walks her down to the park. It ends with him expending far more energy than she does, and he’s dead on his feet by the time he carries her back up the stairs of Baker’s Street.
Rosie claps her hands in joy.
The man raises his eyebrows in surprise. “So you broke up a marriage then?”
Sherlock wants to do all the things that dating usually includes. He also knows that he is going to have to do those things if he is going to keep John long term. He just can’t get past the awkwardness of arms being everywhere, and not knowing what to do with them.
“God yes,” Sherlock responds.
“The later,” Sherlock mutters.
“It’s okay, Rosie,” he whispers to her, and then on impulse he tickles her, and she giggles against his neck he believes his own words. It is going to be okay.
They should move the bed out of Rosie’s room. It’s not like she couldn’t do with the play space, and as it is, the bed is covered with toys more often than it is not. Things between Sherlock and John are still quite new. They went on a date one time, even though they spend far more time just being together at home. They still haven’t spent the night in a bed with each other, without a little girl between them.
“Really?” John groans. “I thought you would just sort of take care of it like you did last time.”
“It’s not okay! I left her at day care! I neglected your daughter, and you can’t accept that!”
He puts her on his shoulder and paces the room as her head gets heavier, and then he moves into his old room. The only sign that this room is going to become a nursery one day is the crib against the wall. He tries to put her down in it, but when she fusses his heart breaks for her, and he picks her up and lays down with her in the bed.
As soon as they enter the room, they know that she’s just had a nightmare, although John still looks around the corners of the room and in the wardrobe as a precaution while Sherlock pulls her out of the crib and holds her to his chest. She stops crying almost instantly when she is in his arms, even though his heart rate doesn’t slow down even as he rocks her back and forth.
“Please, a bit of damp is far from the most dangerous thing in my life,” Sherlock says, “Besides, I’ve got some experiments down there already that I really don’t want to move.”
John puts the book down and cuddles Rosie to his side for a moment. She seems satiated on the story for the first time and runs her finger along tango’s face on the cover slowly.
“She found a book about a baby penwig, that has...” Sherlock clears his throat, “Two fathers.”
“Daddy is a pegwig?” Sherlock asks.
John is almost asleep when he hears a knock at the door. It’s Sherlock, looking painfully uncertain. John pulls the blanket back for him.
“Penguins,” John says with a chuckle. And then he steps forward to hug his two favorite people all at once.
All too often when Rosie snuggles against him, or turns to make sure he’s still on the bench while she plays at the park, or waddles across the room to show him some toy that he has for sure seen many times before, he feels as if she is family.
“Yeah, Sherlock, you probably spend more time with Rosie than I do. You’re parenting her.” Then his face falls when Sherlock’s face continues to look shocked. “I’m sorry I shouldn’t have assumed that you’d want that word applied to you. It was not what we agreed to and...”
“Your methods are fucking impeccable,” Sherlock whispers.
“Oh yes, very nice, Pigwigs,” Sherlock says picking her up and setting her on his hip and taking the phone to look at it.
“You can’t just go off running and follow a case, your entire life is going to be nappies and blocks.”
John opens to a knocking at the door, and for a second he can’t quite place the older couple that is standing there. Then he remembers, “Oh yes, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, Sherlock is downstairs right now running an experiment. I’ll just go run and get him if you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye on the little one for just a moment or two. I am pretty sure that whatever Sherlock is up to isn’t something that would be safe for her to be around.”
“No dear, we’re gong to be in town for a couple of days. I left messages on your phone, if you ever looked at the thing you wouldn’t be so surprised.”
“I’m not opposed, Sherlock, I’m just surprised.”
“Yeah,” John says with a smile. “Not quite sure how you’re thinking about making that happen, but I would go with either a biological child or adoption.”
“It’s not your fault,” Sherlock said, “These things can’t be forced, and so it is what it is.”
John runs down the stairs and opens the door to the flat.
“Serious,” Sherlock says, looking vulnerable.
“Yes dear?” Dot says as if she were talking to an adult.
“I’m a bit surprised that you’d bring this up on a day when I forgot to pick up Rosie from day care.”
“Watch me Sherlock. You fucked up. Parents fuck up all the time, and while I don’t want you to make a habit of it, but you can stop being hard on yourself now. Are you too tired to take care of her? Because I am going to go back to work, but we can leave her with Mrs. Hudson if we need to.”
“Oh, thank God!” John breaths out. “I was certain you’d been murdered or kidnapped. What’s wrong, are you sick?” he asks, pressing a hand to Sherlock’s forehead.
“Oh?” John says, “I think that makes a great deal of sense, and you know those communities are very open to the idea of self diagnosis. So it would be perfectly all right for you to say that you just though that fit you.”
“Yeah, I think it’s amazing that you want to spend all day taking care of you. I think that Rosie and I are really lucky.”
“I guess this is the part where I ask you on a date?” John asks.
“You didn’t, and I don’t want you to go. I don’t want to go,” John says.
“I’m not at all interested in that. I don’t like my relatives enough to create more of them. I’ve done well with my found family. Besides, I think if we were to pick a child who was autistic it would be far more likely to be like me than if I were to have one which was genetically related to me.”
“For some people it is a natural state, dear, not something that they put on in order to get information from a victim of a crime,” his mother scolds. “How are you, dear?”
“I really hope so,” Sherlock says.
Rosie’s eyes light up, and he goes to make her a cup.
John returns upstairs, and Rosie runs toward him with alarm. He knows that this attachment thing is just a manifestation of her age, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t still love it. It makes him feel like she really needs him. He swings her up into his arms. “Sherlock is going to take a bit to shut down his experiment, but I’ll fix you all up a cup of tea while you are waiting.”
He and John solve cases sometimes, with Rosie being watched by Mrs. Hudson downstairs, or when she is at her mornings of day on a day that John has off work. Most of the time though, when John is not working or sleeping (both activities he does with alarming frequency as far as Sherlock is concerned) they just spend time in the living room together. It feels like they are family, and Sherlock has to remind himself that they are not a family. John and Rosie are a family, and he is just their roommate.
“Yeah,” John says.
“Right, Mrs. Hudson is part of our family too,” John says with a smile. “How do you feel about the fact that Sherlock is part of our family now?”
Sherlock grins at him. “Yeah, I would like that. Maybe three kids in all?”
“Although, for the record, Rosie is a bit short on grandparents. She’s just got Mrs. Hudson downstairs, so if you wanted to act that role, at least for the time being, I wouldn’t object.”
John gives him a smile. “About that. I’ve noticed that you tend to nap in the mornings.”
“Why were you worried about that?” John asks.
Sherlock seamed really surprised by the answer, and John leaves Sherlock grinning as John walks out of the flat.
“Right,” John says with a smile, “Then maybe we should think about pulling Rosie out of day care.”
Sherlock stares at him, confused. “You like women. You... can always find someone to date. Why would you want to date me?”
“Locky! Look!” Rosie says, showing him the YouTube video on John’s phone.
“I couldn’t love Rosie more,” Sherlock interrupts, “and I want to keep taking care of her.”
“That’s true, but Sherlock, I don’t want you to dive into this just because you think it’s the best way for us to get a child faster. You expect Rosie to be gifted in everything that she does, and it would break my heart if you were just disappointed by a baby. It... wouldn’t be fair to it.”
“Oy! Sherlock, be nice to your mother!” John commands.
“You don’t want to live with a toddler,” John says looking at Sherlock carefully.
“You have mostly been with women before. I am sure that you are going to miss it before too long.”
Sherlock blinks and wraps the dressing gown around himself while he walks down the stairs.
Sherlock holds Rosie on his hip as he walks into the children’s room at the library. “I’m wondering if you can help me. Rosie here read a book in school, and I’m afraid we don’t know the name.” His stomach suddenly sinks thinking that Rosie might have misunderstood the story, she might have just been projecting her own story onto the book that was read to her, “She said it had two daddy pegwigs?”
“She was lovely to me,” John says, at Sherlock’s falling face he adds, “That doesn’t make anything that you said less valid Sherlock. It’s painfully common for someone to treat their kids differently than they treat other people. And we get to set out own pace for things. It doesn’t matter how fast your mum thinks our relationship should move, all that matters is the pace that we need to be moving at.”
“We could have sex in Lestrade’s car, and then I would be polite at crime scenes.”
“I was talking it slow, because I thought that’s what you wanted. So, just tell me how far you want this to go?”
Sherlock nods his head, but his face is still formed in a kind of flinch. John runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, “Is there a reason you find that really hard to believe?”
Sherlock tries to object but John shakes his head, “You take care of her all the time Sherlock you can take one night off don’t you think?”
“Tank who!” Rosie says, lightly smacking Mrs. Holmes’s leg.
“No,” John chuckles, “That’s not her name. She’s called Mrs. Holmes.”
“No,” Sherlock says in confusion, “Did something happen at work? Why re you here in the middle of the day?”
“Deal, as long as you stop calling it that. Honeymoon sounds more romantic,” John chuckles.
“Yes,” John says, moving into the kitchen to make the tea. The kettle needs filling, and so he puts his daughter down in order to do it. She clings to his foot.
“No,” Sherlock repeats.
She’s used to sleeping practically on top of Sherlock when she was at Baker’s Street, and that worked out all right when she was only there once every week or so, and he found himself completely unable to get his fill of her, but he doesn’t exactly want to take an afternoon nap with a toddler every afternoon for the perceivable future.
“Why should I?” Sherlock snipes back.
“More tangos?” Rosie asked, bouncing up and down on the couch.
“No,” Sherlock says looking down at his hands. It doesn’t much matter what he wants or doesn’t want though. John’s going to move out, and he’s going to take Rosie out of Sherlock’s life.
“I figured,” John says, grinning at him.
“You can’t blame him, can you? You are living together, after all. Have you thought about marriage? Or about the possibility of having more children?” his mother asks.
“You’re not you know. They are wrong.”
Sherlock nods his head and pulls John closer to him.
Sherlock looks at Rosie holding the book close to her chest, and says, “I don’t suppose there is more than one children’s book about someone with same-sex parents.”
“Hudders is playing bridge right now, you can go see her after bath time to say goodnight.”
“Right, you can recommend things for me to read,” John says, “And we can discuss parenting methods, because I would never want to do anything that could be considered that to our kids.”
John reaches over to take his fiancé’s hand. “Yes, I can see that with your family. I think it’s a good plan, but you’re going to have to give me time to do some research before we start that process.”
“Than you for that, but it wasn’t exactly planned.”
“We’ll work something out, John,” Sherlock assures him. John sits next to him and extends his hand to his partner. Sherlock takes it, pleased that John will show signs of affection with him in public. This just goes to show how different John was than Victor.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, smiling at her.
“And Sherlock lives here too? Or has he moved into the downstairs flat all together? It looks a great deal cleaner up here.”
John and the other man come and sit down next to them. “We haven’t started looking into preschools, apparently we are very behind.”
“Oh,” John says, “I don’t know. When I was with Mary, of course Rosie was too young to think about such things, and afterwards, God, I was way too overwhelmed to think about more children. But now? With you helping me? Yeah, I think that’s something I can see a few years down the road.”
“You won’t... mind me coming up to your lounge, will you? Because I could leave you alone more often, we could pretend that we were too separate apartments if you wanted.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” she says softly. “I was just trying to express my excitement for you. I in no way wanted to apply pressure or make you uncomfortable.”
Mary stops short of following him outside and curls her fingers around the doorjam. “You could stay. If you-- if you wanted to.”
John.
“Come along, John. I can hear your stomach growling from here.”
This time Sherlock met him in the middle. He let one hand flutter to John’s lapel and the other fell to John’s waist. He prided himself on being a quick learner, but in this he felt woefully overwhelmed. It was so basic, just skin against skin, and John’s lips fit perfectly against his own. But that perfection was confounding.  Kissing John was like solving a triple murder while high. His entire body felt too warm, too cold, too everything and he was barely kissing John at all. If there were less clothes, he might very well explode. It was impossible to be calm. Normal people in their normal, boring lives did this regularly, yet here he was about to cling to John in his urgency.
“You could always bring it to dinner. Maybe shoot the roast duck.”
“Because you’ve lied to me continually since we met two days ago.”
“Which involves my cock being sucked?”
John licked his lips. “Right.”
Overhead, the tinny and forcefully cheerful sound of holiday music piped through the PA system, occasionally punctuated by announcements for clean ups and additional help on registers. God, John hated this time of year.
“Goliath?”
John really, really hated his flat. Flat was an overstatement; shoebox, maybe closet-- on a good day-- would be a more accurate description. He was lucky to have it, though. Too many soldiers came back home and simply fell between the cracks. Even he felt, right now, a bit like he was clinging to the edge with both fingers. Sherlock had rattled him; no one should be able to tell that much about someone with just a glance, not to even mention the stalking. Despite his better judgment, John also found him intriguing. Bit like a puzzle. Obviously, he had no common sense to speak of, but John supposed that was true of most genius types: all talk and bluster, but couldn’t tell their arsehole from a hole in the ground.
He trembled against her. Rage and sorrow laid claim to his limbs and his breath caught as he buried it once more against her neck. Neither of them were made for cradling or coddling, but she offered herself as an anchor, tying him to the here and now. He clung to her.
“Okay, first things first, if I am going to be taking this from you, we need to figure out what I am doing in exchange. And a name wouldn’t hurt.”
Sherlock opened his mouth only to be told to shut up again. Another thing he was learning about John: he was much more demanding in person, which was considerably different from his flirtatious online demeanor. This new, demanding John brought to mind John in military garb, uniform crisp and boots shined just so. He briefly considered if there was a version of John that was both capable of flirting and giving orders. Sherlock stared down at his lap.
John shines a light along the walls. Cold cinderblock lines the entire room; a sad layer of blue paint does little to brighten it. A cheap Ikea cupboard, with its doors misaligned, and an equally broken table are the only furniture in the entire room. An ancient radiator sits sadly along one wall. He shivers and pulls his coat tighter.
And he follows, a warmness filling his chest at the wonder of this man.
Mrs. Lancaster limped over to inspect her flowers, her cane digging into the newly dug earth. She gave a wobbly nod in approval. “Think that’s enough, young man. You’ll come back Thursday and start on the other side, of course.”
James nodded, though his shoulders slumped in defeat.
Sherlock stands over him and begins to disrobe. He takes his time, occasionally pausing in unbuttoning his shirt to pinch John’s nipple or fondle John’s testicles. When he spies Sherlock’s hard cock pressing against the line of his silk underwear, John feels a roar of satisfaction build in his chest. He swallows it. Sherlock notices it anyway. There is no denying that they both enjoy this, but Sherlock still likes to play at being unaffected. When Sherlock tugs off his pants, he wads them into a ball.
“John, can you hear me? Love, the ambulance is on its way.” Mary drops to the ground next to John, tossing her mobile aside. Her fingers lightly brush his forehead, cautiously seeking out the source of the blood that is smeared along his hairline. The tips of her fingers come away red. She hums in sympathy when John gives a little groan that sounds a bit like ‘Mary.’
“Stop moving.” Sherlock’s fingers relent and blood flows back into the abused bit of flesh on John’s thigh. The pain is sharp and grounding, a bolt of sharp electricity that travels right to John’s cock. He obviously doesn’t trust John to stay still; shortly thereafter he yanks John down toward the edge of the bed, straining John’s arms, and ties his ankles to the feet of the bed. Like this, John feels flayed open. The position leaves his arms just this shy of painful. Even when between bouts of striking John, Sherlock is always aware of the limits of John’s shoulder. Still before long, John’s arms will begin to ache.
“Right. So.” John cleared his throat. “Right, so that was spot on. Not the bit about the leg.” He held up a finger when Sherlock’s mouth opened again to speak. “No talking. My turn. That was brilliant, in a way, and also absolutely terrifying. I have no idea how much of it you figured out or how long you’ve been doing this stalking business. So, you can just bugger off.” John quickly turned once more and walked away, not giving himself the chance to linger on the way Sherlock’s eyes looked in the weak winter sunlight or the way his face had fallen.
“That’s impressive.”
“Well, it wasn’t to me.” John said, a little annoyed, but he was probably just hungry. The toast and tea hadn't really been sufficient as a meal and the bloody crime scene had left him exhausted. “Can we stop somewhere and eat?”
“You were hoping for me to be what? A companion? An equal?”
“Hands,” John whispered when he pulled back again, and Sherlock held up his hands to him. Because they had been soaking for some time now, they were almost clean already, but John took his time with them too, brushing the sponge over each finger and his palms and wrists, again and again until he dropped the sponge and just held his hands in his.
“You have some nerve!”
“Says the man who didn’t share my bed in a week.”
The city was still covered in snow and all was quiet and - mostly thanks to the very early hour -  peaceful. Sherlock walked towards his home and entered quietly, in hopes of not waking Mrs Hudson.
“The sooty footprints, the eaten cookies. I see.”
“You have a better idea? Because I’m fresh out.”
“Maybe,” John shrugged. “Where is the body.”
This is a one-chapter-per-day story for the Advent Calendar 2019 Challenge.
Sherlock sighed and scrunched up his nose. “I don’t want to think about that right now. I need to see the other two crime scenes.”
So I wrote a little fic, using all the titles in the right order. The album is -of course- called 'More than you think you are'.
“Okay," he whispered and kissed Sherlock gently. "Let’s go back.”
Sherlock chuckled and with a flourish of his coat, left the shop. When John joined him outside, the lights were switched off behind him, leaving only the colourful fairy lights in the shop window to illuminate them from behind. He stepped close to Sherlock and leaned against him for a moment. When something cold settled on his face, he opened his eyes which he hadn’t quite realised had fallen closed. Sherlock’s breath curled through the air above his head and all around them, the air was glistening with the first snow of the year.
Sherlock for not taking his bloody phone.
“No. I want to have sex with you, period. I just never brought it up because you seemed not interested.”
The man smiled.
They sat in silence in front of the fireplace, staring at each other. John could tell that Sherlock was incredibly touched and had no idea what to do with his emotions. John finished his punch and got up, holding out his hand to Sherlock. “Come on, Sherlock. Let’s go to bed.”
Sherlock sighed deeply before he got up. “I’ll get dressed.”
“Sherlock!”
“Did you just shush me? I thought the objective was to be loud?”
They said being with you would be my
Yet he couldn’t quite grasp the connection between the snowflake murderer and his own childhood library. “Oh for Christ’s sake,” he chided himself when he realised he had given the murderer a nickname. John must never know.
“That really is not helping.”
“There really is no reason to get loud.”
John was the first to break.
, but they were oh so wrong. When you came along my
Then you suddenly pull me into your arms and your voice reaches me just before sleep takes over.
“What about the man with the chimney?” John asked once they sat in a cab to Hampstead Heath.
“Please, call the police!” he said urgently as he slowly walked away from her. Apparently, he looked desperate enough for her to just stare at him with wide eyes. "Do it quickly. Make sure DI Greg Lestrade knows that Sherlock Holmes is here. DI Lestrade. Insist on that. This is important. Now keep running. Don't look to your left! Pretend that nothing's happened!” He continued to back away and the woman immediately took off at what Sherlock assumed was a normal pace for an early morning run. He could see her pull out her phone from it’s sleeve and dial a number before she was too far away.
“Well, I know that you aren’t defenseless.”
“A terrible, horrible man!” Sherlock complained and John chuckled.
How can you love someone like me, with all the scars, the visible and the invisible? How did you even notice me with my limp and my
“Same thing,” John shook his head with a grin. “I guess you’ll have to apologise to him. He was right for once.”
John hugged him tightly. “Say it as often as you need to. And you’re a good man, you know?”
John blinked and rubbed his eyes, thinking that maybe his tired mind was playing tricks on him, but the figure remained standing there, eerily still and tinged in orange, just like the snow, making John believe that the long dress must have been snow white, too. The head was covered in what he guessed were blond curls and what must have been closed wings were visible behind them.
“Bastard!”
He had no idea why it suddenly felt important that it was just the two of them in the small bathroom, completely detached from anything else that was happening. But for a moment, John found it hard to breathe and Sherlock seemed to notice and sat up a little to be able to wrap his arms around John’s waist and press his face against his stomach.
John saw how Sherlock lowered his mug and placed it on the arm of his chair. His hand was shaking lightly and John wondered what Sherlock already knew.
“You won’t.”

“Windows can be unlocked, and locked again before detectives arrive, can’t they?”
“I don’t think he cut anything important. I can still feel my fingers and move everything.”
“Oh, I did ask! And I did want. God, have I wanted you.”
“It’s really not.”
Around midnight John was ready to kill all three of them
When the librarian approached him again, looking thunderous now, Sherlock stepped right into his path. “Thank you for offering to help,” he started. Politeness would lead to success, John sometimes said. He wasn’t sure why the man turned a little white around the nose at his words.
“You know where every CCTV cam is in the City of London but you don’t know about dinosaurs?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock caught him stopping and had the decency to look a little bashful before he poked his finger into the melting cheese on John’s pizza slice and scooped some of it into his mouth.
“So you did not bring me here to give a long speech justifying your actions?”
“So you killed them because they were offering to help others?”
Sherlock stood up again and then pulled a chair close to the edge of the stain and climbed onto it. He looked at the blood as if it were a map. John came to stand next to the chair and followed his eyes.
“Night, John,” Sherlock said without turning around. And despite the cold sheets, John was a little bit smug that Sherlock had reacted after all. He closed his eyes to the memory of the strange figure standing outside across from their flat.
Sherlock jumped to his feet, kicked the blade out of the man’s hand (the way he handled the blade, he was an expert knife thrower) and turned towards the door. Then he remembered the locked door, grabbed the nearest chair and smashed a window in.
Sherlock looked up at him with a smile. “Oh, interesting. Maybe the murderer’s?”
You’re so real, you’re warmth and companionship and you are here. That makes all
“I’m sorry. The case… and… the letter…  I didn’t think.”
Molly was not happy.
John shrugged. “Molly gave it to me after …”
“Where is John? He was here moments ago. Wasn’t he?”
“The…um… the window is bolted shut. My wife is scared of burglars. And yes, I know that sounds ridiculous given the reason we are standing here.”
“Possibly also imitating traditions. Remember the missing cookies? Sooty footprints?”
“Oh no, I am not going to climb up that chimney. Not even in December.”
Another stare-off.
being mean (well, except to Anderson), he just misses a lot of social clues. He didn’t know how to deal with the enigma that are kids until he decided to pretend they were a tiny version of John.
He dragged himself to the bathroom and then, wrapping his bathrobe around himself tightly, he made his way into the living room. Sherlock sat at the desk, typing away on John's laptop.
Sherlock couldn’t help but snort. The knife was trembling, just a little bit.
Oh, now things were finally getting interesting! Sherlock sat back down, again ignoring the blade that was now in the man’s hand.
“The window was bolted shut.”
Sherlock stared dumbfounded at the cut in his coat. Without him making the conscious decision the fingers of his left undid the button on his shirt cuff and he pulled the sleeves of his coat, jacket and shirt up. Blood was seeping out of a small cut in his arm. The knife must have been very sharp.
He watched Sherlock settle into the bubble bath and for a moment, he couldn’t hold back his laughter when all the sooty bits were still above water while the clean body parts were underwater.
Sherlock smiled and dropped his head forward, rubbing his forehead against John’s shoulder as if he were a cat. John chuckled and ruffled his hair, leading to Sherlock intensifying his playfulness. He growled quietly and then bit at his neck before his tongue darted out to lick at the skin between his teeth. John felt a spark of heat run down his spine and he sighed deeply.
The woman screamed again. He listened. Some form of martial arts
Sherlock sighed the sigh of a tortured soul and began rushing through a series of murders in the early 1980s during which someone had left cards with “Make a Wish” printed on them in scarlet letters. It had turned out to be an out of work actor who earned a little money posing as Santa in shopping centres in the outskirts of London. He had finally been caught when he was hit by a car and a handful of the printed cards fluttered out of his costume pockets. “I would have found him after the first murder, but I was … not allowed to pursue the case.”
“Maybe you will be my last?”
“Excuse me?” He clearly was not. Nothing to do but to forge ahead! It was a reasonable idea. Wasn’t it?
And he wore a coat that looked wrong, even though it was similarly cut to the other one. “Not a word!” said Sherlock and left the flat. John sighed. “Take your phone, Sherlock!” He picked it up after all and handed it to him on the curb where Sherlock had just managed to stop another cab. John would never understood how Sherlock did it.
“Never mind!” Sherlock shook his head. “I know they will be on the list!” He tipped his imaginary hat and left the library, feeling quite accomplished, even though he wasn’t yet sure why. The tattoos were the link after all, but for a different reason than he had believed. If he had held the entire leaflet in his hand, he was fairly sure that it would have featured a print of “Make a Wish.” All victims were linked to … well, George, or body number 4.
Happy holidays to all of you from me, Anarion! Enjoy the last chapter from Days of Storm tomorrow and thank you for reading and leaving all those lovely comments! <3
John took the steps two at a time, elated that he and Lestrade had found an important piece of their current puzzle.
Sherlock stood by the window, appearing to stare outside, but his eyes were moving back and forth quickly. “An angel,” Sherlock muttered quietly. “An angel.”
When he woke up again, it was still dark outside. For a moment, John wondered once more whether he had just dreamt of Sherlock joining him in bed, but when he reached out, he found the solid, warm body next to him. Sherlock was breathing deeply and regularly and John was glad that he hadn’t woken him up. After all, Sherlock’s brain work was exhausting, no matter what he said.
“Shut up, Anderson.”
She took her tea and her crossword puzzle into the living room, which was the furthest away from the bathroom. She’d been living with her tenants long enough to know what things bathtimes led to.
“I proved that the murderer couldn’t have come through the chimney. The footprints were too clean, all things considered.”
Sherlock shook his head. There were so many rebuttals on the tip of his tongue, but he knew it would be better for his survival chances to not speak up then.
“He climbed out the window, you idiot.”
The blade gleamed in the light.
“Hey,” Sherlock had, once more, silently crept into the room without John noticing. John started and turned around to chide him, but Sherlock was gloriously naked and John forgot all about telling him off. “Come back to bed?”
“I have complete control!” The knife appeared between them and Sherlock hoped dearly that nobody would train their gun on him now. As they stood, it wouldn’t be safe to shoot. He also did not want the man to die.
“Yes, that's my text. That... oh. BEAR with me, Sherlock! Why would I ask you to get naked with me via text?”
“John! You’re a genius!”
“Good,” John stood up and walked over to him. He was naked now, but his hands and his entire face and parts of his neck were covered in greasy black stains.
“Is this really the only room we can use? It smells.”
But for now, it wasn’t yet, it was still softly encasing the flat. The case had been solved the day before, Sherlock passed out on the sofa since then and John had used the time to catch up on some sleep and deal with the usual mess that was their flat after a case.
“It had the notary’s stamp and all …” John kissed him again. “Come on. Bed.”
“So you solved the case already?” John was ready to be impressed, but he couldn’t see how Sherlock could already know who had committed the murders and why. “Do you think someone who hates Christmas themed stationery killed those people?”
It was barely past five when they arrived home. Sherlock moved towards the standard lamp to turn on the lights, when John said, “Leave it. We both barely slept last night. Want to come to bed with me straight away?”
“She also had the tattoo?” John asked, wondering how three completely unrelated people from all over London were murdered by a man whose only connection appeared to be the snowflake tattoo. “Do we have any idea who the tattoo artist is?”
I want to be close to you now, sleep in the safety of your embrace, but I fear to disturb you. The clock downstairs chimes
“You’re mine.”
better than you! I solved the case.”
“Were any of your doors unlocked this morning?”
“Let me get this straight. You think I don’t want to have sex with you in general, but I might be angry enough now to have sex with you nevertheless to get back at our noisy neighbours?”
He got up and walked to the fireplace where the same pictures hung that he had got in the mail. He looked at the ones he hadn’t seen before.
A few moments later, Sherlock stopped what he was doing, straightened up and looked him straight in the eye.
“I was moved to France by my parents. They thought a change of scenery would help.”
Sherlock gave him a look of disdain. “If you did, you would drop your weapon now and let them arrest you. The game is over. You’ve played your hand and you did not win.”
John smiles and gestures towards the toy, “You like dinosaurs?”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just took in all the little details of the man’s appearance. The man looked back and Sherlock couldn’t shake the feeling that he saw nearly as much as he himself did. After a few seconds the man turned and walked towards the now empty playground, not even checking if Sherlock followed. Of course he did.
“It’s just Sally and me, Sherlock.”
“I did no such thing!”
“...”
John was amazed by how much he had missed being this close to Sherlock and his plans for Christmas Day began taking on a slightly different shape. And Boxing Day. And the day after.
“How can you live with yourself?” Were those tears in the man’s eyes? Sherlock swallowed, wondering how close to having the blade run straight into his chest he was. “How can you waste your mind, your brilliance?”
John grinned and Sherlock opened his mouth to explain that he of course knew that gullible people believed that Santa came down the chimney (he only knew because it was relevant to a case, of course), a statement that was to be followed by a lengthy explanation of why John was so much better suited to climb up that chimney, but all of that was cut short by Anderson shouting, “He must have taken off his shoes to go back to the chimney! How else did he not leave footprints?”
“So much wasted potential.”
“Yes. I'm glad you finally decided to acknowledge your attraction to me.”
coming home to find John sleeping in their bed, an open book next to him and his watch neatly placed on the bedside table next to a glass of water and his alarm clock.
“I really don’t need to be here, how am I supposed to think with all you people in the room.”
“Hm? No.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Erm,” the librarian looked a little lost and then surprise blossomed on his face. “No, but I know that George offered to do them for people as a way to practice. He was …”
? No. Someone giving birth? No. What then? Oh. OH!
“The one with the snowflake looks promising. Maybe a new case?”
on this bed, every
“I’m telling you…”
“You asked me to get naked with you.”
“Just as you did the Christmas murderer?”
“You’re the one who should be justifying his actions!”
“Who is the Christmas murderer?” John asked and Sherlock made a face as if he were in severe pain. “Not you, too, John! Please!”
Unable to hold back any longer, John leaned down to kiss him gently and Sherlock deepened the kiss immediately, opening his mouth and moaning quietly.
The scream rolled through the room again.
“No.”
A few minutes later, John was running a bath while cramming Sherlock’s clothes into an even larger bag. Sherlock would have to get them cleaned professionally anyway, so he wouldn’t mind if they creased now.
“Something tells me that the blood is neither the victim’s, not the murderer’s.”
“Do it then,” he murmured. “Kill me and know you kept me from my true potential, just like my parents did.”
“John. I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you. I will try to do better.”
“I think there’s a creature stirring after all,” he said before he started giggling.
Sherlock pondered that for a while, then his face took on a tense expression.
5 minutes later John returned with the coffee and Anderson in tow.
“Jesus,” he finally said again, trying to regain control. “I’m sorry, but you just … you look like …”
The next morning started with a phone call, which resulted in rushed tea, no toast, and banging doors. 48 minutes later they had gathered in a flat in Chiswick.
Sherlock nodded. Better not to touch on that dark part of their lives again. He inhaled deeply and then let his breath out in a shuddering sigh. “Thank you!”
“I guess we need an expert,” John cuts in before this argument gets out of hand.
I gently lie down on the bed next to you and you instantly turn towards me, a sleep-heavy hand reaching aimlessly.
John shuddered. He was too tired and cold for this.
knew where every CCTV cam is in the City of London. Or possibly because he wishes
“I am dizzy, nauseous and -hicc- hiccuping. And my HAIR is itching. My hair! It can't be anything but your fault!” John shouted and ran into the lamp.
I am also not sure if this chapter makes much sense. *hands the whole shebang to Days of storm with a shrug and a helpless smile*
“What are you doing?”
There was no need to shout back anymore, and although John was going to shout himself hoarse more than once in the coming nights, the first time was quiet and gentle, I guess you could almost call it reverent.
Christmas Eve. Lestrade and Molly had left (Rosie was spending Christmas with Sherlock’s parents), Mrs Hudson had helped them put the leftovers into the fridge, poured the last punch into two mugs and made them sit down in their respective armchairs by the dying fire. The flat was lit by a multitude of fairy lights which Molly had not only brought along, but simply hung up, despite Sherlock’s grumbling. Once she was done, she had stood in front of him, her hands on her hips and her chin raised and simply said “Sherlock, have you noticed how lovely John’s eyes and hair look in this light?” and raised her right eyebrow in a challenging manner.
witten on them.
“That was Anderson’s theory,” John pointed out, gently running his hands across Sherlock’s clean chest.
The little boy frowns at his toy for a few seconds, then looks back at John and says triumphantly, “Dino-Rex!”
The rare quiet atmosphere that filled 221b Baker Street was about to be destroyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The thread,” Sherlock looked at him with wide eyes. “Is it …”
Sherlock gave an exhausted sigh and grabbed John's arm to stop him from falling.
“You don’t want to be stopped.”
“It would be a shame, though, wouldn’t it? I don’t even have a snowflake tattoo.”
AN (back in 2012): Yeah, no idea where that came from. I was putting new music on my player and while typing the titles of a Matchbox 20 album I noticed that they are almost a fic in itself.
“So how
[Should I mention that the first word combination that caught my eye was 'Bent' and 'Push'?]
She smiled as she put it on top of the pile and went back to her crossword puzzle.
But Mrs Hudson proceeded to stand there and look down on the two of them with a smile on her face. Finally, she sighed and shook her head. “Remember when you told me you would need the second bedroom?” she asked John, who had, in fact, forgotten about it. “I always knew you wouldn’t, eventually.”
“Why not.”
Sherlock felt his blood run cold a little. “You wanted me to kill my family so I could find another killer?”
do that!” Within the span of a few seconds John had gone from fed up to utterly angry. Sherlock wondered if maybe knowing how much it upset John was worth the cut. But then he remembered how his stomach had twisted painfully at the realisation and he nodded. “He did.” His voice sounded strangely choked. When John very carefully pulled the coat off his shoulders and gently laid it aside, Sherlock was more than surprised when John turned his attention back to him and his arm and not the coat. The jacket followed and then John was unbuttoning his shirt, pushing it over his shoulders, too, before he very carefully freed first his good arm and then peeled the cotton off the arm with the cut. While the wound had closed against the sleeve, the removal of the cloth opened it again.
“It’s pathetic,” he shook his head. “Offering to tattoo people for free? How could they not expect to be hurt in the process?”
“Posters? Jute bags? Notebooks?”
Neither John nor Lestrade can immediately answer because they are busy biting back a smile. John sees Sherlock open his mouth and fears for the worst.
“I never saw. You hid it well.”
“Don’t call him that!”
“They did not fit your pattern,” Sherlock sighed. “If they had offered to help or accepted help, they would be dead in that white, white house.”
The prince fell hard, arms bound behind his back. A dark bruise marred his face; his right eye was swollen shut. Dried blood left a gruesome trail from his nose and down his chin. Despite his injuries, his one good eye shone bright with defiance.
John shook off the unwanted thoughts and scooped up his laptop. If Sherlock could do a bit of snooping, then John could too. It was only fair. It didn’t take long for him to find what he was looking for; after all Sherlock Holmes was an odd name. A quick scroll and John found himself falling further down the rabbit hole. Sherlock’s life was something out of pulp fiction. His website was dull (surprising given how over-the-top he had been in person), but there were a lot of interesting comments on his various articles. Stolen paintings, kidnappings, lost loves-- ninjas? Good lord, what kind of life did this man lead? In the right circles, Sherlock seemed to have made quite the name for himself, and yet there was barely any mention of him at all in the papers. If he was as good at solving cases as these people boasted, there was almost no evidence of it.
The boy hummed in interest and leaned over the bin for a look. “I wouldn’t bother with Scarberry’s bins. Unlikely for them to have anything you could actually use. He’s a dentist. Doesn’t believe in sugar. Might I recommend three houses down? Family full of absolutely terrible children. Probably ripe for the picking.”
He pulls up into the gravel next to Sherlock’s house and waits. He stares at the wheel in front of him and plans his method of attack. Part of him wants to reverse his car out of there and chalk this all up to bad thinking. The other, much larger and louder, part begs for him to pluck up his courage and go knock on the door already. He swallows down that impulse. Sherlock had left his mark on John’s life, for good and bad. He is not angry at Sherlock, not anymore, but he also needs to be sure he is doing this for himself and not for anyone else. Not for Rosie. Not even for Sherlock.
Satisfied, Sherlock unbuttons John’s shirt, gladly sacrificing buttons in the need to get John undressed. The cold air of the bedroom cause John’s nipples to pebble and the hair on his arms to raise. He shivers.
I always do.
John laughed. “That’s not going to happen. Besides, think about all the places I could see. And we could write to each other and I’d tell you things that I learned. Might actually be useful for once.” He nudged Sherlock.
She ran a hand along the wall. The castle offered them protection only because the royal family extended it to them. There was ancient magic at work here; a gargoyle needed a place to protect, but humans often feared what they did not understand. Still, this was the best place for her young to hatch, deep within the dungeons.
Sherlock unzipped the garment bag on the bed. “We are supposed to be a couple. Besides, I rarely sleep and the bed is big enough for five people.”
His foster parents didn’t care about his reasons. He woke the next day to find all of his things shoved into the plastic bag he had come with and another stern adult waiting to take him away. He hadn’t cried then, nor when he was taken to the boys’ home. It wouldn’t do to show weakness, especially not here with so many other boys who had snakes peering out of their eyes, too. He bundled up the hurt, the loneliness, and swallowed it, imagined the snake devouring it in one sickening gulp. He couldn’t afford to mess up again. Next time it wouldn’t be a home he ended up at.
“Ah. I see the army did little to help with the temper.” Sherlock looked down at him, aloof and cool. It made John want to box his ears.
Sherlock pushed past the two men blocking the sidewalk and tugged his hood down further to protect his eyes.
Sherlock kicked a shard of pottery. “Shame. It would have been nice to find something in here.”
you have mastered so many things.
“But we do not dream.” James looked at him once more. He stilled his face and straightened his spine, as if ready for battle. “Am I mad, John?”
Mary found him hunkered down in the branches of a tree. In the dark, he looked like the monster the humans believed them to be. His face twisted into a mask of anger and hurt. He growled, a terrible rumble echoed by the storm. His growl grew in pitch the closer she drew to him. She answered with her own.
Sherlock blurted the next thing to come to his mind. “There was a giraffe.”
“Right. But you need a fake boyfriend for a case? Didn’t have anyone to ask except a stranger?” John shook his head. “Not fooling anyone there.” He held up his hand when Sherlock bristled once more. “I’m not saying I won’t help you. Just expect a bit more honesty. If this is something dangerous, I need to know I can trust you to have my back.”
Sherlock squeezes his eyes tight and concentrates on feeling John’s heart thumping away under his hand. He envisions oxygen and blood pumping through atrium and ventricle and back again. Just eleven ounces of John, carrying so much weight, so easily crushed and snuffed out. Sherlock’s next breath chokes him.
“Whoa, what are you doing?” John held up his hands.
“Not even notice I’m gone. You know she sleeps like a rock these days. Thank Christ.”
The waiting, though, is its own sort of torture.  When Sherlock shuts the door to Mrs. Hudson’s flat, John groans in frustration, finally giving voice to the need to come. John splays his legs wide and ruts into the air. A part of him used to hate that he needed this, used to balk at the very idea that sometimes he needed an overly firm hand, to be used, to be fucked relentlessly until he is left gasping and shaking. Now though, he can only think of the next moment, the next slap of Sherlock’s hand or the rough pull of his hair.
John flinched. “Not as badly as she does.”
John blinked. Faintly, Sherlock thought it was entirely unfair John was dressed when Sherlock felt incredibly naked. They stared at each other.
Sherlock’s mother was a bit of a whirlwind, John discovered. She talked with barely a pause, all the while escorting him through the house and offering him a sandwich because she thought he looked peckish. John liked her immensely. It was easy to see where Sherlock’s excitement came from, though it manifested a bit differently. Sherlock didn’t have the same generalized need to talk, but ask him about something he loved, and he never stopped talking.
“Oh!” Sherlock blushed. “Sorry. John sometimes gets a little eager.” He didn’t pull away from John, but he made a go of trying to appear appropriately chastened. “Um, was there something you needed?”
John gave a sloppy nod then crawled on top of Sherlock. With a humph, Sherlock fell back onto the bed and threw out his arms to keep John from falling off. Undeterred, John shoved a knee between Sherlock’s legs, reached over and turned on the bedside lamp, then promptly fell back asleep.
Anytime John actually found a job, Sherlock would moan dramatically, proclaiming that John’s time was being wasted and that there were more important things to do. It did not, however, stop him from tagging along. It was...comforting. John hadn’t had a friend in a while, though he wasn’t entirely sure if that was what he and Sherlock were. He couldn’t deny that he looked forward to seeing Sherlock, even when he was being a giant prat.
“Yeah.” John moves then, both hands hot against his face. He hesitates for a heartbeat, a millennia, before finally letting his lips rest on Sherlock’s. He moves like Sherlock is precious and fragile, a broken wing in need of delicate mending.
“But not you?”
“He said you were absolutely mad, terrifyingly brilliant, and a downright tosser.”
“Fuck!” John pulls away from the pain, but Sherlock refuses to let go. It will leave a dark bruise, but it won’t be the only one. Bruises are the norm, painting his skin in purples and greens days after one of these sessions. He attempts to kick out at Sherlock, but Sherlock dances out of reach. Damn his impossibly long arms and legs. They both know how this works. John will lash out, but Sherlock will win every time.
James ducked his head and pulled his wings in close to his body. “We slept?”
“Hush.” John tilted his head up, cupped Sherlock’s jaw, and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s.
“Yeah.” He kept his eyes on Sherlock’s toes and the delicate line of his ankle. Everything about Sherlock screamed fragile, light as a bird bone, and just as sad. In the early morning, John liked to watch the birds before anyone else was awake at the home. He huddled under his blanket, head just outside, and watched the world slowly come alive. Sherlock reminded him of those birds he spied every morning through his small bedroom window. One of those that sat motionless for hours on a branch, observing, waiting, only to take flight in a sudden burst of energy; there then suddenly gone in the foggy morning light.
“And careful I was. This is nothing more than the evidence of a small scuffle.” William eased into a stance, his body loose and ready to strike. “Come on then. Show me how to avoid getting bruised.”
Sherlock slipped his hand into John’s. “I believe we’ve covered this one.”
“Come, James. Dawn will be upon us in short order and I wish to report this to Tremaine.” He leapt and spread his wings, trusting that James would follow. There was enough time to make the captain of the guard aware of the issue, but it would be close. He snapped his wings, urging the wind to catch and carry him faster. He did not like to be gone this long from the castle. It made his skin itch.
Lestrade smacked the side of the car and took off at a sprint. The damn fool was going to get himself killed and where exactly would that leave Lestrade, eh? With a mountain of paperwork. He flashed his badge at one of the officers urging people away and made a beeline toward Sherlock. Bent over inspecting a large piece of masonry, Sherlock ignored his shouts and continued to run a gloved hand over it. He wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s bicep and tugged him none too gently to his feet. Sherlock grunted his annoyance.
“Stop this. Stop it now.” John’s violence cloaks his fear, wraps it up with a strike against Sherlock’s face. The next hit follows soon after, a torrent. Unstoppable. Inescapable. They are being swept away in the flood.
“Ah well, that’s good. That you aren’t going anywhere.” John thrust the plastic bag into the space between them. His tongue felt clumsy in his mouth and he swallowed the urge to babble. “Hungry?”
“You were awake?” John blanched. A thousand years awake, but unable to move would break the mind of anyone, even someone as strong as James.
The lift doors opened as Fantomas nodded. “I’m afraid that is partially my fault. I keep both copies of my work here at home, under twenty-four hour surveillance. It had become the worst kept secret that I had hired more security for my home. The attack you heard was only a distraction, something to keep my men busy. The true force slipped in during the chaos and made off with my prototypes. I can show you footage of the attack, though it is heavily obscured by a smoke grenade.”
“Welcome to London, Goliath. We have a lot to talk about.”
“— it. Fuck, Sherlock. I’m here.”
Submarine plans—
“Terrifying.”
“C’mon. Just like I’m doing it. Deep breath, Sherlock.” Under Sherlock’s hands, he feels John take a deliberate breath. Another one. Sherlock attempts to mimic the calm way John’s breath eases in and out. His pulse slows its jackhammer tempo in his neck. John loosens Sherlock’s death grip and guides Sherlock’s hand down to his chest.
He quickly makes his way toward the door, tightening his coat around him and readjusting his scarf. Mary follows quick on his heels, though he makes no move to slow down. He steps out into the cool evening air and breathes slowly.
He didn’t go out for a few days. Instead, he lingered like a ghost in the hallways of the home, darting away from the other boys. Mr. Carter, the man in charge of the home, hated idleness and quickly enlisted him in cleaning the toilets, dusting the windowsills, and sweeping the floors. When he finished one thing, he asked for another chore, not daring to pause in between activities or else he would think of the bruise he’d probably left on Sherlock’s throat.
“I can’t hear you. There seems to be a fly buzzing about my ear.”
“No. I was just about to step out for a bit. Needed some air. Mrs Hudson has been on and on about something. Haven’t the faintest idea what.” He patted his pockets for a moment before victoriously pulling out a much abused pack of cigarettes. He frowned when his tapping provided nothing from the pack and in retribution, he crushed it in his fist.
“Why haven’t you got your shoes on? You do know it’s December, right?”
John dove one hand into Sherlock hair. He had longed for the feel of it; the way Sherlock's curls, stiffened by product, would slowly relax under John's fingers until they entwined. His other hand landed on Sherlock’s hip and squeezed, pulling him closer and closer still. With staggering steps, John pulled them both back towards the living room, before spinning around and slamming Sherlock into the wall. He yanked on Sherlock’s belt and pulled it loose, roughly shoving his trousers and pants out of the way.
“It’s a figure of speech, Sherlock.” John rolled his eyes.
Lestrade turned to Sherlock and mouthed the word 'partner', a mixture of disbelief and amusement warring on his face. Sherlock rolled his eyes and followed Fantomas towards the lift. Once the door closed, Fantomas spoke again.
“Right. Well.” John stared at her hand. Good lord, she didn’t waste any time. Shouldn’t Sherlock be jumping in? He darted a glance at him. Sherlock was paying attention, but he seemed more interested in the dog than the fact that Ms Simmons was laying her charm on a bit thick. “Sherlock and I need to get going. We have a few errands to run, don’t we?”
He shifted his weight and his foot kicked a bit of metal. It pinged against the wall running along the parapet. Running his fingers along the dark space, he finally found the culprit: a sizeable bullet casing, possibly from a semi-automatic rifle. Fantomas certainly had his fingers in far more pies than he let on. Military grade weaponry to steal a computer program? Unlikely.
“We are not them.” She twisted her hand and arched into him. “We are made of something much stronger.”
Which he had seen in very thin pyjamas just a few hours ago.
“Oh yes, Ms Simmons’s second husband. He had a temper on him. Always shouting and slamming doors. If it hadn’t been for Daniel, I think Mr Humphrey would have taken to throwing things at us.”

“Sherlock! Goddamnit.” Lestrade wrenched the keys out of the ignition and took off after him.
John sniffed. His smile flattened.
Sherlock froze, hand still buried in clothes. “Oh.” His hand closed over something and his face brightened. “Oh, John, really?”
“Fuck you and your shock.” A hysterical laugh bubbles in John’s throat. “Oh, fuck, Sherlock. You’re supposed to be dead. I held your hand, oh Christ.” He wipes a shaking hand across his mouth, as if to scrub away the words tumbling from his mouth. His eyes screw shut in pain.
“Relax.”
His screams are nothing more than whispers now, barely flitting past his chapped lips. But the first scream, oh the first, had ripped out of him in surprise and shock. After being whipped and beaten until his body was numb with pain, they had let him rest. His body had fallen uselessly to the ground; the chains cut into his wrists as they attempted to hold him upright.
John snorted. “You are just disappointed that you will not get my portions tonight.”
“Lovely pooch.” Sherlock sneered.
“Why? So you can play at being poor for a bit? Gonna put on some wrinkled clothes and round out your accent? It’s not another one of your goddamn experiments.”
It wasn’t until he was sitting in the waiting room after Sherlock had been taken back to be examined, that John realized he was still holding an angry cat and that he had completely forgotten about the errand he was supposed to be running. He drummed his leg up and down and stared out the window.
Sherlock’s cock, already half-hard, fit perfectly in John’s hand. It was familiar yet unfamiliar, gorgeous in way that he had forgotten. John stroked him fast. There was no time for lingering, he needed to see Sherlock spent and undone under his hands. Too much time wasted unraveled between them. He dropped to his knees and pressed his face into Sherlock’s groin, panting and shaking with need.
