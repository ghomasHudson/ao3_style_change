“Sam, come here, it's urgent.” His brother turned to look at him, rolling his eyes before getting out of the booth.
“Yeah.” Dean answered, quietly laughing. “That's the one. She’s probably right, too.”
“Lizzo.”
Dean nodded. “I’ll be there in a minute. Let me get some stuff together.”
“I love your silly little tie, and your head tilt, and I love the way you sniff all the candles when we go grocery shopping, even if I pretend to be annoyed. I love how much you care about your family. How you were raised to be a warrior, to have hands covered in nothing but blood, yet you still manage to be the most loving person
The knock echoed through the bunker, bouncing off the walls.
The figure wasn't anywhere to be seen, and Dean stood in the center of Cas’s room, the sinking feeling of loneliness crept into his bones again.
“What would you like?” Cas asked him, eyes still filled with a sparkle that only comes from gaining something you thought you lost.
“I know.” He resigned.
Cas paused, and Dean heard a different voice in the background. He realized it was his own.
You don't really know what a picture is going to be until it's done.
“Ah. That makes sense.” She spoke the words.
Sam slid him a worried glance.
Jack didn’t move. “I think… I think I’ve got to take care of a few things first.”
Not that he was going to enjoy this trip. In fact, he was currently doing the opposite of enjoying, and they hadn’t even gotten into the car yet. Starbucks.
“Yeah, except she's a convicted criminal.” Sam attempted to snark back.
“Or, we could leave Starbucks to the fourteen year old girls.”
“Does that face mean you like it?”
The ride back was more manageable, Dean allowing them one song choice each, complete with a warning to pick wisely.
He couldn't unwrap the fuzz from around him, so he didn't know what Cas was saying, ears seemingly filled with cotton. It was just the knowledge alone that he was there. That he was holding him and whispering comforting words into his ear. That even as a human he could heal Dean at his lowest points, and still see him as the brightest, strongest, soul.
Cas had changed him too.
“Uh.” Dean cleared his throat. “What-what do you have?” He indicated Cas’s coffee by angling his head towards where it sat on the nightstand.
“Where are you?”
“Are you going to come back with us to the bunker?” Sam asked Jack.
“Wait a second… Dean?” He looked at his brother, before turning to face his best friend. “Cas?”
He turned over, pulling himself upwards until he was just inches from Cas. Cradling the angel-turned-Winchester’s head in his hands, Dean placed his lips on Cas’s, melting into the touch as he felt the other man’s arms wrap around his torso.
Sam turned to face him, and his gaze softened. “We'll get him back, Dean. I promise.”
“I want to try all the human things that I didn't get to try last time.” He said offhandedly.
“Just for a weekend.” Sam said quickly. “This weekend. We wanted to go on vacation together.”
“Yes I know you’re boring Dean, but you can still help me not be.”
He enjoyed the small touch of Cas’s hands on his back, moving him forwards to the line, but was grateful Cas was careful not to let them linger there too long.
Cas just continued to give him that look.
“I'm sorry, Dean. I'll go.” He turned around quietly, before walking up the stairs again and into the crisp air outside.
Dean smiled.  “And I met Cas.”  He set the last hamburger patty on the plate and moved to wash his hands.  “And when dad found out I was dating a boy, he beat the shit out of me.”  He could hear Matt’s intake of breath.  “So Ellen took Sammy and I in, got custody, and adopted us.”  Dean gave a little shrug.  “It was a sucky way for it to happen, but it worked out for the best.  I’ve got an amazing family, an awesome husband and great kids.”  He turned, smiling at Matt.  “See?  Sometimes good things do happen.”  And it came back to him in a flash, Cas saying those very same words to him the day Ellen was taking him to Family Services.  It had turned out to be true.  It would be true for Matt, too, Dean would make damn sure of that.
Then Cas was smacking at Dean’s shoulder.  “Dean….Dean, stop.”  Cas’ voice was barely audible, so breathless, but Dean still heard him. Even so, the words didn’t register at first.  “Dean, stop!”
“I know.”
Castiel looked up at the sound of his husband’s voice, guilt on his face at being caught swearing.  Dean couldn’t completely cover up a laugh.  He moved to join them, looking down at the cards.  “Mary kick your butt?”
Benny grinned at the enthusiasm.  “Just some jambalaya.”
That tiny voice immediately pierced through his book fueled haze and his head whipped around.  Another librarian, a man this time, was standing beside Charlemagne, glowering.  Immediately Matt was at the boy’s side.  “What are you doing?”
Dean laughed.  “I agree 100%.”
“Me too.”  Suddenly, Dean started laughing.  Cas looked at him in surprise, but Dean didn’t answer, couldn’t answer.  Cas turned to see what had made him laugh so much and…..
it was sexy.  He ran his free hand along Dean’s spine, the smooth skin, and over the soft, spiky hair at the base of his scalp.  “God.”  There was wonder in his voice.  “You are so gorgeous.”
“You’re spoiled rotten, you know that, right?”
Cas simply blushed.  “Shut up and get in the boat.”  Laughing, Dean obeyed, and Cas followed suit.  Neither had ever been in this sort of boat before, and it took a bit before they managed to figure out how to row it, but quickly they fell into a smooth rhythm and were gliding down the river.
Matt nodded and some of the tenseness in his shoulders relaxed ever so slightly.  He was always nervous when meeting new people and understandably so, what with the situation he was in.  Dean had made sure to tell him a bit about both Cindy and Benny during lunch.  He was careful to mention the way Benny had stood up for him multiple times, going so far as to defend him on the field and in the locker room when he was attacked for being with another boy.  Matt hadn’t said much but it was clear from the look in his eyes that the words meant something to him….meant a great deal.  Dean would wager that Matt hadn’t had many real friends in his life.  He wanted Matt to know what kind of man Benny was, to know that if Matt trusted Dean, he could trust Benny.  The message seemed to have gotten through.
“I know,” he murmured.  He wrapped a hand around Dean’s shaft, feeling the precum there and knowing Dean was close, so close.  He began to jerk Dean in time with his thrusts.  “I know, baby.  Come on.  Come with me.”  And just like that, he was lost, burying himself deep inside Dean as he came.  Dean cried out at the feeling of his husband spending himself even as that hand continued to work his cock.  It wasn’t long before he followed, spilling all over Castiel’s hand.
Dean eagerly accepted the dish.  “What is it?”
Dean nodded.  “Good.”
Dean made a noise that could only be described as a whimper, and he struggled out of his pants so fast that he stumbled as he kicked both pants and underwear aside.  Cas chuckled.  “
Dean’s eyes flew open.  “I’m up, I’m up.”
There was the sound of scrambling as Matt no doubt straightened things up, and Dean couldn’t suppress his smile.  “Yeah.”
“I have no idea to what you are referring.”  But Dean was struggling to suppress a smile.
You mean you’re staying for good?”
“I’m glad you like it.”  Glancing over his shoulder, Cas saw Dean struggling.  He smiled, moving to his husband and brushing his hands aside.  “Let me do that.”
Mary scarfed down her burger at top speed.  Were it anyone else, he might be worried they would be sick, but Mary could take it like one of those food eating champions…..Most Hot Dogs in One Sitting.  Matt almost looked in awe as she finished two burgers before he had even finished one.  Points for him for not being grossed out that a girl did something considered so clichéd “manly”.
Matt nodded, face aglow, and Dean could feel his eyes burning as he forced the tears back.  Cas clearly knew how he was feeling for suddenly Cas’ hand was taking his and giving it a gentle squeeze. Dean shook his head to clear it.  “Ah….Matt, this is Charlie.”
Dean burst into laughter, rolling to a sitting position.  “Coming, we’re coming!”
A look of recognition came over Matt’s face (they had told him all about the contest the first night they had watched the film), followed by one of trepidation.  “I….I really don’t dance.”
Mary looked up from where she was pouring copious amounts of ketchup onto her hash browns (something else she had inherited from Dean).  “Yeah?”
Mary’s eyes lit up when she saw her cousin inside.  “Jared!”
Dean looked to his majka with a smile on his face.  “Yea.  He is.”
“I promised to love you and honor you, comfort and keep you.”  Castiel was smiling, those blue eyes soft.  “I pledged to be by your side in sickness and in health, for better or worse, for the rest of our lives.  Well, we’ve had all of those things, and you’ve been by my side as we created a family, a home, and a life together.  Every single day with you brings yet another blessing for me.  Today, in the presence of God and…” Castiel finally seemed to notice how many people had gathered and surprise registered on his face; quickly, it turned into a smile.  “….all these people….I renew my vows to you.  I pledge my eternal love to you.  Above all,” his smile softened, face filled with all that love that Dean saw there every day of their lives, that love he knew was reflected in his own face.  “I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you, and to whatever else that life may bring us.”
“Nothing.  Everything.  All of this.”  Dean pulled Cas in for another kiss.  “Hurry up and make love to me.”
how happy I am!”
Cas tried his best to scowl. He wasn't very successful. "You're never going to let me live that down, are you."
“You doing okay?”
“I….” Matt was fishing for words.  “….your dad said it’s your birthday today.”
Dean grabbed Sam’s beer, ignoring the indignant objection, and took a long pull as he figured out how to begin, exactly how much he should tell.  “He was homeless,” he said at last.  “I ran into him late at night the day before Mary’s birthday.”  He looked to his brother.  “I couldn’t leave him there, Sammy.”
But now that I've gotten this done, I'm going to do my best to keep updating regularly like I used to.  I promise I'm going to try my hardest.  I love you guys.  <3
Mary withered beneath that gaze, laughing nervously.  “Heh….oops?”
For something was definitely wrong.  The blonde was rigid, hands clutching the arms of his chair, despite the fact that the plane hadn’t left the tarmac yet.
“We don’t,” Castiel agreed.  He grinned.  “Maybe we should.”
“I know.”  Cas stroked Dean’s hair softly, soothingly.  Then:  “…..does this mean we might have another kid?”
“Um…” Matt looked from Cas to Dean.  “Yes.”
“Charlemagne!”  He raced to his son’s side, but the damage was done.  He began replacing them as best he could, as carefully as he could.  “We don’t mess with daddy’s art supplies.”
“What about him?”
As always, dancing made Dean feel as if he was flying.  With Cindy in his arms, he felt happier than any other time than one: when he was with Cas, with his family.
Cas smiled, reaching back to brush his fingers through that short, soft hair.  “No.  I just love you.”
Matt glanced at his mostly empty plate.  “Alright.”  Sinking into his chair, he sat and resumed eating.  Dean sat down across from him, trying hard as possible to keep his eyes on his computer and off of Matt, not wanting to freak the boy out with his attention and smiles.  It was looking more and more like he was succeeding in getting Matt off the street.  If anything, he was at least helping him.  And that was everything.
Dean looked to Cas, triumphant.  His husband just glared at him.  “Shut up.”
Dean shook his head as he watched Cas opening the envelope.  “No occasion.  Just something I should’ve done a long time ago.”
“No.”  The lower lip was trembling now.  “I don’t want you to go.”
Mary joined them a few minutes later and flopped into her chair, still looking a bit grumpy.  Dean arched an eyebrow.  “They’re washed and hanging up to dry,” she grumbled.
Mary glared at the two men for a moment before grabbing the shoes from Dean and flouncing off to her room in a huff.  Dean just shook his head.  Cas smiled at him.  “She’ll get over it.”
Dean nodded.  “Really.  I mean it. And Cindy is dying to work with you.”
“So.”  Cas looked at Dean as he changed into his pajamas.  “Anything big happen today?”
Castiel laughed.  “Of course!  We can see all the sights!  When are we going?”  He glanced at the tickets in his hand.  “A month from now?”
“You doing okay?”
Cas nodded.  By this point, he knew a handful of ballets nearly by heart, after so many years of playing for Dean.  He placed his hands above the piano keys.  “Ready when you are.”
I….you want to teach
Cas could clearly sense Dean’s emotions; his charcoal-stained fingers slipped into Dean’s, squeezing gently.  Dean smiled at his husband.  “I love your new piece.”
Dean laughed and took Cas’ hand, dragging him down the hall to the bedroom.  Cas decided his husband was wearing far too many clothes.  Before Dean even had time to turn around, Cas was rucking the t-shirt up around his armpits.  Dean let out a little yelp of surprise.
Dean nodded rapidly.  “Yea I’m okay.  Fuck.  Don’t stop.”  Cas couldn’t help but smile at the desperation in his husband’s voice.
“Guess not.”  Cas leaned in for a soft, lingering kiss that went all the way to Dean’s toes.  “Now…..how about you get in that shower so I can scrub you down?”
“No, I like yours.  I like a week in London.”  He smiled.  “We can go see the Globe.”
The next morning, they woke up a little later than they had the rest of their days in England.  They wouldn’t be doing much today.  Their flight left in the late afternoon, so they were going to spend an easy morning and then head to the airport.  They had a nice breakfast, Dean enjoying his last pot of British tea (seriously, how did they make it so perfect every time?) before heading out to Portobello Road.
Cas laughed, a squirming Charlemagne in his arms.  In all honesty, the eight year old was too big to be held for long, but Cas was refusing to give up on it until it was absolutely necessary.  It would be, soon enough.  “Happy birthday, Mary.”
Cas arched a brow in that way that Dean loved….. the dombrow, he called it.  It always showed that Cas knew he was in control and wanted to know why anyone would question that fact, and it almost always spoke of delicious fun ahead.  “Are you telling me what to do, Dean Winchester?”
The girl turned to face them, cheeks red at being caught, but her face was all defiance as she replied.  “I called you a poophead.”
“Dean?”  The voice was hesitant but both men looked up.  Matt was standing behind the bar, looking at them awkwardly.  “Your dinner is ready.”
“Tear down the house?”
Cas laughed.  “Oh, don’t even give me that.”  He bumped their shoulders together, jostling Dean off balance.  The blonde just laughed.  Cas was right.  He knew exactly what Cas was referring to.
Dean followed Castiel’s gaze to where a man was busking on the sidewalk.  But he wasn’t playing a guitar or the drums as was most commonly seen among buskers back in the States.  No, this man was playing the bagpipes.  He looked at Cas with surprised delight in his eyes.  The brunette laughed when he saw the expression and, kissing Dean, took his hand and tugged him along.  They each tossed a few pounds into the basket at the buscker’s feet before hurrying on their way to the museum.
“If you’d like, you can pay now and pick them up later.”
If anything, the confusion only grew.  Matt looked to Mary, who had an expression of amusement on her face.
“You’re not making money off of jambalaya!”
Dean was in his glory.
That evening they went to the Sherlock Holmes Museum.  Cas was examining the waxwork figures depicting scenes from the books when he suddenly felt a weight on his head.  He removed it and found the traditional deerstalker hat that Holmes always wore in the books.  Dean smiled at him.
“Oh, hey, Matt.”  Dean tossed aside yet another book, managing to hit Cas in the head, ignoring the indignant “hey!” that resulted.  “You didn’t happen to see a permission slip anywhere while we were gaming yesterday, did you?”
The forced smile faltered.  “….are you interested?”
Cas was laughing.  Dean grinned.  “Grandpa Bobby found it for me.  It was a complete junk heap.  I’ve been working to restore it for almost a year now.”
Dean shook his head.  “Not at all.  Maybe we can even convince Cas to come and play the piano for us.”
Dean heaved a sigh of relief once they touched down.  Cas chuckled, stroking the soft blonde hair.  “Feel better?”
Sam nodded to him.  “Hey.”
Cas laughed.  “Oh my God, he’d look so cute.”
“Aww.  You mean I’m not allowed to put the fear of God into him?”
Despite the nerves clearly running through him, Matt managed a smile, gesturing.  “Right this way.”
“Those….are those men’s slippers?”
….then again, maybe not.
“I have to sew the elastics.”  And Matt saw now that it was true, the elastics that should have criss-crossed the foot were only attached on one end each.  Dean was carefully marking the place where each one would need to be sewn down.  This really was all incredibly fascinating and Matt didn’t know why.
“Hmm…”  Dean pretended to give the matter great thought, mulling it over.  At last, he smiled.  "Pretty sure I can think of a way.”
Matt hesitated. "…..would I have to wear tights?" he asked.
“Classy, Mary.”
“Hey, it’s not like it’s a ridiculous question, after not taking care of this pair.”  Dean shoved a plate at her.  “Now hurry up and eat, or you’ll miss dance practice.”
Dean nodded, still a bit nervous.  “Not just London.  We’re going abroad for two weeks.”  If possible, Castiel’s eyes got even wider.  “Charlie and Bela agreed they would move into our place with Lauryn so that the kids won’t be alone.  I thought we’d do one week in London and then the split the second between Paris and Italy.”
“Okay!”
“Hey!”  Mary smacked her father’s arm, but he just laughed.  She returned her attention to Matt, smiling.  “Thanks.  I’d give you a hug, but I probably smell.”
It was from a book he had read about bridal customs of Elizabethan times.  The men would wear broom flowers tied about their arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was completely unexpected,” he commented when he was done.
The boy looked away, obviously embarrassed. "No," he mumbled. “But you're badass."
“Pizza!”  Charlemagne jumped up and down.  Dean arched a brow at him.
Cas’ hand flew to his mouth to stifle his gasp as that wet heat enveloped his cock.  He had to be quiet; the kids may be busy, but they were still there, and it wouldn’t do to let them hear.
“You didn’t think I would take care of you?”
Castiel laughed.  “We do.”  Tilting his face up, he brushed his lips against Dean’s in a gentle kiss.  “I love you.”
Dean gasped, hands clutching Cas’ hair.  “
Matt looked unsure, clearly unused to this sort of attention, but he accepted the handshake.  “Nice to meet you.”
“Well you’re gonna scar ME.”
“Oh, you--!”  Laughing, he swatted her shoulder.  “You are such a brat!”
“We just left the diner before we got here,” Cas answered, apologetically.
“I'm just going to miss you so much. I can't thank you enough for helping me move.”
“Oh, you most certainly do.” Cas smiled. “You went on a ten minute spiel when that guy tried getting you to use your employee discount on him at work, remember?”
“It went well. No problems. Just a very long drive… No, tomorrow's the same... We're going the same way again, so we'll be in Colorado by tomorrow night. We'll be staying the night in Grand Junction…” He laughed at his mother’s groan, easily picturing the expression on her face. “I know it's long. I'm feeling it… I know... We do stop, Mom… Yes, as much as either of us need… I have to go. Dean's coming back… Yes, I'll call before we leave… I love you, too… I'll let him know. Bye, Mom.” He hung up with a sigh, getting out of the van as Dean returned.
Desperation rang clear throughout Dean's voice as he begged. Cas kept teasing him, moving down to kitten lick on his left ball as he slowly stroked Dean, the change causing Dean to arch off the bed again.
“Please don't go speeding away. I don't want to get separated.”
Dean still thought of Cas’ numerous resurrections as miracles, not sure what he would do if the time came when he truly lost Cas. That wasn’t something he wanted to think about, but this life was full of surprises and plenty of death. He was prepared to go down swinging at any time. Hell, he had done just that. But the minute Cas became his, Dean wanted as much time with Cas as he could eke out. He’d had a taste of what domestic life was like, unsure if it was something he would be able to have again. But he wanted to give Cas that too if he could.
“Yes, I'm sure calling their cook a ‘worthless hack’ absolutely endeared you to them.”
He got Cas a cup of water as Cas groaned from having to move. Opening the box, Dean opened the bottle and shook out two capsules and handed them to Cas. “I want you to take your shirt off.”
“Do you want to lead then? You're better at scoping them out than me.”
“You can have both.”
Then he had just suddenly been standing all alone, surrounded by that damn smoke. Neither Sam, the Impala, nor the woman had been in sight. He had then realized it didn’t matter if she hadn’t revealed herself. He knew who she was. The Darkness. The troubling question he couldn’t figure out was why. Why had she saved him? What did she want with him?
“Yes,” Cas answered quickly. “I love when you do that.”
Well, no sense thinking about something until he was actually ready for it.
“It was like I was… inside a blender,” Cas started. “That was set to puree for a tomato salsa.”
“Technically that's two words. And in my defense I never drove to California before then,” he said, noting Dean was slowly walking towards him. “Wait. What are you doing?”
“I’m sure I will, Dean. I just can't eat mass quantities like you.”
“Yeah, sure.”
Cas just watched him in stunned silence, unmoving.
Dean simply laughed, commenting fondly, “You're so easy to get,” but didn’t try tickling him again.
“So would I… just a little quicker.” Dean smirked, glancing up at Cas before looking back down at the page.
…” Dean pleaded again.
“Yeah, I'm just hungry.”
“We’re twenty-five. No one’s worried about clogged arteries at twenty-five.”
“I am not holding us up, Dean. That would be you by refusing to give me the check.”
Grabbing the van’s keys from the counter, Dean grabbed the closest box from the living room and made his way outside. The van was just a simple white Econoline, decorated with U-Haul decals. It was already decided Cas would drive the van and Dean would follow behind in Cas’ golden monstrosity. He tried convincing himself it was normal to be worried about Cas driving his car across country; if some kind of problem arose, it would go unnoticed by Cas. As a mechanic, Dean would pick up any potential problems quicker. It was better he drove Cas’ car. And it wasn't like he truly hated the car… No, he truly hated the car. What was it he’d told Cas when his friend seemed genuinely surprised to find out Dean’s true feelings about the car? Oh, right. ‘Eye of the beholder’. It seemed to calm him down, at least.
His back arched off the bed, eyes squeezed closed as Cas started stroking him. He grabbed at the blankets, his fists twisted the blankets tightly as he moaned. The sound was heavy, ripped from his very soul. God, who knew being touched by Cas could feel so…
Confident Cas would start to move, Dean headed in the direction of the bathroom to shower. Castiel sat up slowly, his eyes half closed as he waited to see how his body would feel. Surprisingly, his back felt fine. He slipped off the edge of the bed and dug through his own bag on the dresser, trying not to think about the massage Dean gave him the night before.
God, Cas wanted to touch him,
“Got it,” Dean winked.
“Do you have the address? I'll need it for the GPS.”
“You got to. Breakfast is only for another hour. I'm gonna shower real quick, so get your lazy ass up, dude.”
Cas looked at him with confusion as he swallowed the pills down.
. I want...”
“Yes! Like that! Please… don't stop!
“We've had green Christmases before. It felt like Christmas then.”
Dean smiled to himself, glad any awkwardness was gone.
“ Why not?” After a few minutes, Cas was unable to keep his straight face and started giggling.
“Yeah, give
“What makes you say that?” Dean asked, getting up to retrieve a couple beers from the mini fridge in the library. Sam had initially scoffed at the idea, jokingly questioning Dean’s need to be within easy reach of alcohol at all times, refusing to admit in the end that the idea hadn’t been that crazy.
“No, I don't believe so. Just missing home a little.”
Cas sighed, wiggling around on his stomach to free the covers from beneath him and get them over his shoulders. “Are we even getting closer to California?” He was too tired to try thinking about where they were in regard to a map of the country.
“Good. I'm gonna hit the head and we can go.”
“Last time you didn't have that GPS and I didn't know you couldn't read the Atlas.”
“What? No, come on.” Dean turned his stool so he was now facing him, laying a hand on Cas' shoulder, squeezing gently. “You got this, Cas. I know it's scary moving away, but I believe in you, man.
. Not vice versa. Watching Cas, Dean saw him keeping shooting glances at him, as if he was waiting for something. Dean suddenly wished she'd just stop crowding him, feeling uncomfortable.
“Are you done?” he asked Dean, stepping to his side of the pumps.
“Fine,” he sighed looking at his menu again.
“I am, yes. I think the soup helped.”
“Why don't we go out?”
“That I'll miss them,” Cas said with a slight shrug.
“Oh, you're back,” Dean noticed him instantly, tipping his head in the woman’s direction. “This here's Cindy. She's going to... where was it again?” He looked at her with a grin.
They finally reached the hotel around six-thirty. Pulling into a parking space, Cas decided to call his parents, letting them know they made it safely. He looked up, seeing Dean's reflection in side mirror approaching, and Cas opened the door as he held the phone up to his ear.
“Cas!” he practically shouted, his back arching again, pushing him further into the deep heat of Cas’ mouth.
“Huge. Jubba the Hut fat.”
Cas started giggling nervously as he kept backing away. Dean’s grin turned more into a mischievous smile. Cas knew what that usually meant for him. Dean kept slowly advancing, finally grabbing Cas around the waist and spun him in a circle, both laughing as they stopped at the side of the bar, Cas’ back against the brick building, bathing both in soft yellow light from the floodlight above their heads. Dean practically was pressed against him, Cas’ hands trapped between them. Cas looked at Dean with a small smile, the playfulness from a few seconds ago now felt charged. Cas wasn't sure what to expect but Dean leaning closer towards him, kissing him wasn't it. Cas moaned softly, kissing him back. Just as suddenly as it began it ended. Dean took a couple steps back and wiped the corners of his mouth with his hand and cleared his throat.
Dean gently massaged Cas’ back, trying not to enjoy the feel of Cas underneath him or of his body under his fingertips. God, Cas was muscular, no doubt from all that running. Dean remembered how Cas felt between his legs, his hot, wet mouth sucking him off. Fuck, he hoped he wasn't getting hard, or at least so Cas wouldn't notice if he did.
. He’d always loved writing and it was his sophomore year of high school when he decided to submit articles for the student paper. For a shy child such as himself, all he had to do was quietly listen to schoolmates as they easily talked about the latest trends, gossiped about who was dating who. He been practically invisible to his peers and they never seemed hesitant to talk while he was in earshot. It made easy work out of writing pieces about the going-ons at Lawrence High.
“Well, don’t worry, okay? Sam’s got her shackled in the dungeon. So, we’re gonna question her and get her to undo all this. So, just hang tight, okay?” Dean told him, stroking Cas’ hair again.
“No dessert? I’m sure they have pie.”
Dean sighed as he practically bounced on the bed in a supine position, grabbing the remote, getting comfortable as he watched TV.
call this a late lunch. But I know
“Move ahead,” Dean agreed, ignoring the pang of sadness.
A few minutes later Cas came out, surprised to find Dean gone. Putting his clothes away, Cas saw the note in Dean’s neat scrawl saying he went out. He looked towards the door in confusion as if he would suddenly appear. Did something happen to make Dean leave so abruptly? A fight with Sam or his dad? Cas knew Dean’s relationship often bordered on tumultuous with John. Nothing abusive, of course. But he was just hard on both Dean and Sam. Now Sam was in California, Dean got the brunt of it now. Maybe something else had set him off and just needed time for himself. Cas could understand that. There were times he needed personal time as well. If Dean needed that, he wasn't going to disturb him. So, he laid down on the full sized bed with his book he had packed but hadn't started reading.
Cas knew exactly what was wrong. Dean was what was wrong. Cas was still struggling with his feelings. Nights in the hotel rooms only made things worse. He desperately wanted to touch Dean again but knew it wouldn't be welcomed. The man was everything Cas wanted. Dean was smart, and funny, and kind hearted, and so damn hot. He wasn't even sure what Dean’s best quality was. Maybe his green eyes which sparkled whenever he was being playful or laughed. Or maybe his dimples. Or maybe the way he threw his whole body into the way he laughed at something.
“You know, uh, Sam,” Dean started saying.
. But I don't know about love.”
“Somewhere close.”
“Hey, I shop,” Dean told him, holding his arms out to the side to show he had to get clothes somehow.
“It's not Siberia, Mom. I'll be back to visit, I promise,” Cas tried reassuring her, embarrassed by his mother’s display.
a snack?” he asked, looking down at their empty plates.
“Yeah, I got it in the car,” Dean reassured him.
“My what?” Dean asked, glancing around him.
Their food arrived a short time later, Cas glanced at Dean's plate with a laugh. “There's your favorite; green beans.”
Dean watched Cas, seeing different emotions sweeping over his face before disappearing, none of which he was able to decipher quick enough before the emotion was gone. He hated feeling as if he was missing something, something just outside his grasp.
Trust
“Cause, Cas. It's a couple hours before we’ll stop for lunch, maybe stop to get gas, then we’ll go for another two, three hours. Dad said there's a place called Burlington in Colorado, and it sounds like as good of a place as any.”
“You know you'll get the steak. You raved about it for ten minutes last time.”
“Why not?”
Neither one moved for a few minutes, just watching the other, chests heaving in tandem. They broke eye contact, both getting their fill of their other one before them. Then, unable to stand it any more, Cas practically lunged at Dean. He grabbed Dean’s hips and yanked him in, moving backwards towards the bed before turning them and pushing Dean down onto his back. Dean gasped as he fell, but his legs fell open in invitation. Cas quickly joined him, lying between Dean's legs and smiling down at him. They started kissing again, just as desperate and deeply as before.
He had to learn to control his own body. To be fair, he hadn’t been expecting the hug, however nice it was to hold Cas. Forcing himself back in control, Dean made his way to the moving van.
Dean handed him the check. “Cheater.”
Cas came out a few minutes later, seeing Dean was asleep. He scoffed softly as he packed his clothes. Coming to the foot of the bed, Cas lightly smacked his boot. “Wake up!”
. Panting, his head fell forward as he squeezed his eyes shut. He just came to the image of his best friend, and it had been one of the best orgasms to date. Other than that morning. What the hell was wrong with him? Cleaning himself again quickly, he got out and dried himself. A sudden moment of panic washed over him. Had Cas heard him? Had he known he was in the starring role of Dean’s thoughts?
He truly was going to miss his best friend, but it wasn't as if Cas was leaving him behind. A week after helping him move, Dean would be starting his own new path. Instead of L.A., his friend would be moving to Lebanon, three hours from Lawrence. The auto shop Dean worked at since high school was closing business as the owner, Walt, wanted to retire and spend time with his daughter and grandson. No one could fault Walt for his decision, but it
Cas hesitated for only a moment, then moved to the middle of the bed on his stomach. He felt the dip of the mattress as Dean moved on it, then his weight as he straddled his legs. Cas closed his eyes, ready to accept a massage; not only would it make his back feel better, but if this was the only way Dean would touch him? He was selfish and needy and he would take it.
“Hey, I'm following
boyfriend now. Rather than risk any problems between him and Dean, Cas simply kept quiet. When Dean finally did end things with Meg, Cas barely was able to contain his relief.
Cas just smiled. “I admire your restraint.” He picked up a couple pink sugars, shaking them before opening them and dumping them in his iced tea.
“Do you want my number? You know, in case you ever find yourself in San Francisco,” Cindy quickly asked, hopeful.
“Would you look at me?” Dean whispered as a waitress came over. He smiled politely at her, but Cas kept his gaze downwards, taking it upon himself to order the drinks for the both of them. “So, um, Cas,” Dean started once the waitress left them to look over their menus. “Look. I don’t know what happened. I mean, I
“You! I want you! Please. Please.”
Dean watched Cas as he walked towards the Continental, releasing his breath when Cas was out of sight and seated in the front seat. He still felt Cas’ body heat on him, and it made his heart race. Damn it.
“Good. I mean thanks. For understanding, I mean,” Dean said, sounding relieved as he returned Cas’ smile.
“Goodland? That's a hell of a drive,” Chuck said, then chuckled nervously.
“That's their fault. They shoulda invested in soundproof rooms.”
“Jesus, dude. I can hear you overthinking from here.”
Cas followed him, trying unsuccessfully to grab for his bag. Each time, Dean’s grip would tighten on the handle not allowing Cas to take it and chuckling at Cas’ apparent frustration. Cas won by yet another strategically placed poke to Dean’s side. Naturally, he called foul.
Walking down the last flight of stairs, Dean squinted in the bright sunlight as it reflected off every vehicle, catching off the side mirrors and damn near blinding him. Setting the box on the sidewalk, he went to the Impala to retrieve his sunglasses. He unlocked van’s side door before retrieving the box and loading. As he turned around, he saw Cas coming down the stairs carrying two boxes. He nodded and moved to unroll the passenger window.
“Stop glaring at my cereal,” Cas said without looking at him as he fixed his cereal and toast.
The room was fairly big, the walls a light beige color, the carpet a standard blue. A double bed was to the immediate right against the wall and to the left was a queen-sized bed next to a small round table with two chairs. A wooden dresser sat opposite the ends of the beds, a television hung on the corner of the wall. The bathroom was small but thankfully there was a tub. Setting his bag on one of the double beds closest to him, Cas opened it, starting to dig for his pajamas. “Do you mind if I go first?” he asked, trying not to beg.
“Right. Between breakfast and our moms, we'll be lucky to leave around eleven.”
? But now, he couldn't look away from their reflection, Dean’s eyes locked with his as he massaged Cas’ back.
“Yeah, yeah. You ready to go?”
The clerk returned save him from his self-loathing and Dean quickly signed the copy of the credit card receipt. Heading out to the vehicles, he decided he had to talk to Cas, uncomfortableness be damned.
“Well, grab your bag from the car, Grandpa, and let's go to the room.”
“I do all right taking care of myself. I don't smoke and I don’t do drugs.”
“What’d I tell you about getting lippy?”
The room was what Cas expected; clean but nothing exciting. Would it be too much for
For a few minutes nothing happened. Then be felt Dean’s fingers against his sides and he flinched, hard, pinned to the mattress.
He’d been lucky; his peers had never hassled him as badly as other kids had to face daily. His sexuality was something he was never made to feel shameful about. Obviously, that had been more due to the fact Dean wouldn't have hesitated to punch whoever touched him... his own personal bodyguard, if you would. But Cas never really gave any reason to be picked on. He knew he was gay while in middle school, remembered being so fearful to tell Dean. He’d heard the horror stories some gay kids faced after they came out. Friends and family turning their backs on them, parents even going so far as actually kicking out their gay child. It was that fear which caused Cas the most anguish; Dean no longer being his friend and kicked out by his own parents.
“You guys make a cute couple,” the cashier told him. “Seems like you really enjoy each other.”
“So where to?” Dean asked, taking the keys out of his pocket.
“That’s just like saying it,” Dean sniped at him, refusing to even acknowledge the idea.
“Out?” Cas repeated.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly, feeling himself blushing. What the hell? Sam was getting Cas squared away on his laptop, not Dean’s. And how did Cas even get it? His chains didn’t reach that far. Sam had to have given it to him. Fucking great. Now he was forced to try to get himself out of this fresh hell of Cas’ curiosity. “Uh, I’ll… I’ll explain it later, okay? But r-right now I can’t. I..uh… have to-to go. Now,” Dean stammered, still blushing, as he quickly left the library.
“We only left yesterday. We got another couple days, then we'll be in L.A..”
God, he was a fucking dork.
Perhaps once there was distance between them, Cas’ feelings would start to fade. Maybe he would be able to find someone who he could talk with, share his life with. Just someone who would help him get over his crush.
The next morning, Cas was the first one awake. He looked at the blanket draped over him in confusion, not remembering when he grabbed it. Dean was still sleeping, his arms hugging his pillow. Cas just sat up and studied him, hoping things were less awkward between them, lost in his thoughts when Dean woke up. The sound of him snorting softly brought Cas out of his thoughts . Dean’s eyes slowly opened, blinking a few times to remove the cobwebs. For a few long minutes, neither one said anything, just looked at each other. Cas was the first one to smile, Dean returning it easily. Maybe they were okay now.
Confusion washes over him again. A mile? He had somehow been transported a mile away? Was it the smoke? The woman? Both?The last thing he remembers is sitting in the Impala, watching in silent horror as rolling smoke barreled towards them. He had told Sam to hold on, already sensing they were in for a rocky ride. Then the smoke and that now familiar roaring had swallowed them up, and there she was, the woman. She had been standing right in front of them, calmly watching them. He had leaned closer to the windshield, trying to get a better look.
“That isn't exactly the recommended amount, Dean.” He rolled his eyes, smiling. “Your diet consists mainly of bacon, junk food, and pie.”
“Because driving's so tough?” Dean snorted.
Cas watched sympathetically as Dean reached for the ice pack, once again sitting at an angle in his chair. Cas sat back down heavily, pondering Dean’s words. It hadn’t been disgust with him Dean was feeling, but embarrassment at the reminder of when it had been Caswith the bruises when Dean still bore the Mark. Despite how readily he had forgiven Dean for that, it seemed Dean hadn’t yet forgiven himself.
“Uh, sure,” Dean said cautiously, glancing in Cas’ direction while he was putting the hose back.
to you?” Dean taunted.
“I want you guys to stay in touch. Call me when you stop, okay?” Mary told Dean firmly. “I don't want to worry about you guys getting hit by a semi.”
Cas got up and went to the dresser to dig out fresh clothes. “I'm thinking I'll grab more clothes from the van.”
“I thought you said you weren't going to insult my car anymore?”
Before either of them could say anything else, their waitress came over with waters and to take their order. Cas surprised Dean by ordering the ‘Sunrise Special’ instead of his usual oats and toast, while Dean ordered another breakfast platter that offered hotcakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Their waitress wrote the order down before walking away.
His heart stopped momentarily. Was the spell returning? Did Rowena trick them into believing the spell had been removed. “What are you asking?”
“Sounds good. I’ll get that right in for you boys.” She grabbed their menus and left them alone.
miss me. You're honestly
“Well, take a couple more pills and get dressed. We'll check out after we eat.”
As Dean hit a particularly sensitive spot, Cas couldn’t stop the moan from escaping. Dean’s fingers played along the bumps of Cas’ spine causing him to moan again. Dean didn’t say anything, continuing to move his hands as he gently rubbed Cas’ back, and Cas’ breathing came in quicker. He felt himself growing harder in his jeans, his erection pressing this side of uncomfortable against the zipper, and he turned, unable to stand it anymore. They stood nearly nose to nose, the air between them seemed to crackle with sexual tension.
Pacing as he dialed the number, he prepared himself for Crowley’s usual snark in lieu of a greeting. Instead, the phone just rang continuously, frustrating Dean more with every unanswered ring. “Come on, Crowley, pick up!” He demanded as if Crowley would be able to hear him, although he wasn’t putting it out of the realm of possibilities. “I’ve left you a dozen messages.” Sighing, he hung up, glancing down at his phone. “Why isn’t he answering the phone?” He asked, not really expecting an answer.
Cas looked down at himself, feeling crumpled. But he must not be if Dean said he was okay. They made their way back out, Dean drove as they stopped at the nearest bar. It wasn’t too bad inside nor too crowded. They sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers. Cas glanced around, noting a jukebox in the corner, sliding off his barstool and made his way over. Dean watched him go, looking at the other patrons out of habit to scope for trouble. But no one was giving Cas a second look. Well, no one except for Dean that was.
Cas ignored his pleas, rolling each of Dean's balls while kitten licking the tip of his cock.
“You okay?” Dean asked, his voice deeper from sleep.
She individually tossed each one to Cas. “Use these, it will taste like a pumpkin spice latte.”
They didn’t whisper to hide, and it wasn't because he was ashamed. It was because that exchange was just for them.
When they got to the bottom of the stairs, they stood on opposite sides of the room, neither one of them willing to move any closer.
Cas’s hand on his shoulder pulled Dean out of his thoughts. “Hey.” He said softly.
“Good.” Sam said, and Dean breathed a sigh of relief.
“I did not.” He said, discontentedly crossing his arms. “I only drink coffee that's as black as my soul. Darker than the night sky. Hotter than the bunker’s computer when it overheats. As manly as-”
Dean smiled at him, setting his own mug down and moving Cas’s out of the way to pull him into a kiss. He could smell the nutmeg almost as much as he could taste the cinnamon on his lips.
“I love you.”
Dean smiled at his attempts of regular human interaction, before over-the-top winking himself.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew he should have been wary, but that concern was pushed away quickly.
He heard a sniffle come from the phone.
Dean cleared his throat, swallowing the lump just beginning to form. “S-sorry little guy. I've got…” He sucked in a shaky breath, looking up towards the sky. “I’ve got someone, right here, who would like to rest with you.”
“Yeah-h.” He said shakily. Before he could figure out who he was apologizing to, a voice from behind the counter called.
Cas was telling him some random fact about a bird he saw, but Dean could only think about his reputation that was about to shatter like a vase dropping on tile floor.
He took a shaky breath.
Hope he knew would just hurt him more.
He thought about it for a moment, before giving a light chuckle, realising something.
Dean couldn't help but think of himself as a small, living-room window, from an old, dilapidated house. Stained yellow with age. Cracking from wear.
“Ow. That hurt.” Sam muttered, before turning to watch Cas, which Dean was already doing.
so close, only for him to slip through his fingers like silk.
The feeling of having something powerful enough to kill an angel shoved through his abdomen. Black liquid flowing out in globs of polluted grace, or his own soul shattering at the hands of another, lighting up the sky in bright blue, face becoming a Jack-o-lantern as it shone through his eyes and his mouth.
“Oh you can put ‘John Bonham’ on mine.” Dean replied.
Dean might actually have to put sugar on the grocery list after he was finished.
Dean glared at her before trying his own coffee, and well, it was coffee. The point of buying expensive caffeine still went straight over his head.
“I mean it's… okay.” He lied.
“I would like that.” Cas answered. “All four of us could make pie. According to the “mom blogs,” as you call them, it would be a good family bonding exercise.”
The colour of sticky, red blood as it flowed from open, gaping wounds. His own hands were stained with it.
“Oh just, give it here.” Dean said. He took a long sip from the disposable cup. He could taste a vague hint of whipped cream mixed in with the coffee, its light fluffy texture sticking to the last swallow of smooth liquid in the bottom of the cup. The chocolate and espresso rested on his tongue, and the peppermint was strong and refreshing. He took another sip.
He remembered the first solo case John sent him on.
Dean whispered something in Cas’s ear. “I'll drink the coffee, but I won't budge on this one.”
“Sure thing…” Cas had to think before finishing his sentence. “...buckaroo.”
“But what if I want you to try it?” Dean glared at him. “Don't make me do Sam’s ‘puppy dog eyes’ again.”
He realized Cas had been doing that long before the Empty stole his grace.
“You're afraid they're going to break open the Empty, aren't you?”
He felt sick, guilt gnawing at him from a pit in his stomach.
“What?” Dean asked, question genuine and free of all malice.
Cas looked very pleased with the thought of getting to try more coffee.
“No…” Sam started, trying to find a way to defend them. “Sometimes we…”
Sam and Eileen went to look for a place where they could all sit again, playfully bickering the entire way.
The Shadow was growing paranoid, like it could sense the turmoil in the world above.
The screen remained blank, almost tauntingly, but the memories that flashed in his mind threatened to choke him.
He pulled the sleeve of his flannel over his palm, and  pushed away the brambles and crawling bushes covered in thorns. This small movement unearthed what the average person would miss, as the overgrown greenery gave way to a small wooden gate underneath. He pushed it open with ease, time and weathering making it swing on its hinges with little force.
He hesitated a moment, hovering next to his brother like he had something to say. “You know, Cas… Jack is working on it, and-”
He watched her silently laugh before turning back to look at Cas.
Okay no.
The four of them went over to their thankfully-still-available booth and sat down. Dean and Cas sat on one side, both instinctively choosing the side that faced the door, with Sam and Eileen sliding into the seats directly across from them. They sat there, talking about nothing in particular, and certainly nothing of importance, before falling into the natural art of storytelling.
He held his yellow and black striped, bee-themed ceramic mug Eileen had bought him in one hand, and the entire five-pound bag of cane sugar in the other. And there he stood, happy as can be, pouring it directly into his mug.
Because Matt was their kid.  There was no questioning it anymore.  God.  How great was that?
“Great!”  Jared pulled away to smile at his uncle.  That smile was all Sam, but the eyes were Sarah’s.  He was a gorgeous kid.
As expected, Dean had complete freaked out at the Globe theatre.  There had been a display on one wall that was a timeline of Shakespeare’s life and showed when each play was written, and after their adventure at the theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, Dean had insisted on a photo of himself pointing to when
“Have you ever tried it?”
“You idiot.  That’s no reason for you to starve.  We’ve got all night.  Plenty of time to see everything.”
“I know, baby.” Cas slipped his fingers out slowly, teasingly, loving the whine of desperation that the action wrung out of Dean.  “I know.”  He slicked up his cock and positioned himself, stroking Dean’s hip as he pressed forward, burying himself to the hilt in one smooth thrust.
“Yes,” Cas whispered.  “Oh, yes.”
“Are you sure this is okay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean locked the studio up and the two tromped down to the house.  Cas was sitting in the living room with the other children.  Charlemagne was completely oblivious to his father and sister, happily coloring away in a book that Cas had handmade for him.  Cas and Mary were playing Whist.  By the looks of things, Mary was winning.
Dean’s eyes lit up at the thought of seeing Shakespeare’s theatre.  “Yea?”
Collecting their keycard at the front desk, Castiel turned expectantly to his husband.  “Ready to check out our room?”
“Yea.”  The words were tossed over his shoulder as Dean headed off in search of one.  “On old ships they were what was used to secure ropes and rigging, but you always see them used in books and films as an improvised weapon.”
That earned him a little laugh.  “Guess so.”
Matt tousled the boy’s hair.  “You all set, Chaz?”  Charlemagne nodded.  “Okay.”  He gestured to the nearest shelves of books.  “I’ll be right over here then, alright?”  They weren’t far from the computers, with a clear sight line, and well within hearing distance.  He’d be able to keep a close eye on Charlemagne.
“Yea.  Good.”  Dean shifted, trying to get closer, and Cas obliged, tugging Dean into his customary position with his head tucked up under Cas’ chin.  “Hey….do you think Matt wants to dance?”  But he didn’t give Cas a chance to answer, barreling on.  “I mean he always wants to sit in and watch, and not just Mary and the other girls.  Me and Cindy, too, and even just me on occasion.  I mean he claims to just want some company but I’ve caught him watching when he thinks I’m not looking, and I see him checking out my shoes.”
Ellen laughed, turning to Matt.  “Sorry.  No offense meant.”
Sorry it took so long, guys!  Hope it was worth the wait!  I love you all!  Mwah!  Kisses!
THAT got Dean’s full attention, back going ramrod straight in remembrance.  “Shit!”
Cas had sketched Matt and Chaz as they currently were.  Chaz sat snuggled up against Matt’s chest, his small hands held in Matt’s larger ones as they clapped as one.  His head was tilted back as he looked up at Matt, the older boy meeting his gaze with affectionate eyes as they laughed happily together.   Castiel had captured all of it in exquisite detail.  Dean felt his heart melt.
Matt’s smile was soft and grateful.  “Thanks, Dean.”
“…I…”  He fiddled with the bottom of his shirt.  “…I’m sorry.  I don’t have a gift for you.”
, Cas!”  A low chuckle was the only response, and Dean gave a tug at the messy brown locks, pouting.  “Bastard.”
Dean shook his head.  “Don’t worry.  It’s not dancing.  Just hand motions.”  Matt still looked nervous but he nodded and stood beside Dean, waiting for instructions.
Chris
Dean caught that hand in his and brought it to his lips for a kiss.  “Shut your face.  And fuck me.”
"You were mad then. I was worried." Dean sidled closer, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist and leaning into him. "I laughed shortly afterwards, if you remember."
After reading
you’ve promised to clean your shoes and haven’t done it.  Time to take responsibility for yourself.”
Claire grinned.  “No guarantees there.”  She glanced over her shoulder.  “I think your waiter may be ready to seat you.”
“You’re happy?”
“Shut up, Sandra Dee.  And eat your pizza.”
Matt managed a small smile.  “Yeah.”  There was hope in his eyes, yet it was overcome by something else, a resignation to never having that something good.  Dean would wipe away that sadness if it was the last thing he did.
Sam turned to look at her. “How would you know? Most of the time you get hot chocolate and spike it with bourbon.”
Cas had known a lot of ugly in his life.
(They all very cheekily chose the songs they knew would bother Dean the most.)
“What happened to him?” Eileen asked innocently.
And it was that inability to speak that led Cas to think he was nothing more than a tool for the Winchester’s to use.
It seems he was doomed from the start to have a life dripping in the crimson and viscous liquid that is blood, and stained from the faint burn marks of the wings belonging to a fallen sibling.
“Hey, Jack. Now, now that you’re God, do you think you could… Can you save him?” The desperation in his words was palpable.
Icy fear ran through his bloodstream as he looked back at Cas.
“What do you mean, of course he is, Sam. Come on.” Dean spoke with more force than necessary, but he couldn't lose any more of his family.
Cas set down the bag of sugar and picked up the pot, the glass making a small clink as it hit the top of the coffee maker. “Goodmorning Dean. Would you like any coffee?” He greeted cheerfully, turning around like he hadn't just put enough sugar to make a pound cake in his coffee.
“Wait, wait. Shut up. Quiet.” He hit Sam on the shoulder in a childish attempt at getting him to stop talking so he could listen.
So he sat still, willing himself to keep his eyes open, afraid of what falling asleep would do.
“Do your lungs hurt?” He asked in a voicemail, not expecting a response. He sat in the darkness of his room, holding the phone like his life depended on it.
It gripped his heart so tightly, that even sitting in his home, Dean thought he could die at any moment.
He was only thinking that maybe, just maybe,
“I don't know, man. It was something sickly looking. Cold? Green? Possibly tea?”
Dean fell to his knees, staining the rough fabric of his jeans with the soft, brown dirt from below.
Dean’s favourite story to tell, aside from the fact that he killed Hitler, was the time he got to solve a mystery with everyone’s favorite talking dog. And yeah, all three of the people that sat at the table had heard both many times before, but that didn't matter, it was still enrapturing to hear them again.
“Sam.” He sounded like he was trying to whisper, but his volume raised far higher than that. The patron closest to Dean gave him a look before turning back to their work.
There wasn't even a body left for him to burn.
“I know this one isn't coffee, but it's really good.”
Fake Cas appeared inside the bunker when he walked in, and the black sludge in his chest felt like it was ripping apart his organs.
It’s not even that his Dad was particularly religious. He wasn’t told that it was a sin, or that he was going to Hell.
They had been two nuns, their fate a product of hate crime. Put to death for simply being themselves.
be there again, and it
“That's fair.” Cas agreed. “It's probably not very healthy.”
“I remember once, Dean went on a hunt with Dad.” Sam started. “Nasty vampire, it got a hit or two on Dean. I think you guys went with another hunter. Young. About your age, actually. Uh…”
“They really knew
Jack started to close the door again. “Jack… wait.”
“Did anyone happen to get the salted caramel macchiato?” Dean whispered.
(And the pumpkin spice-life Dean had secretly been longing for since they were little kids.)
By that time the following day, Dean thought they were both going to die. The bloody and uneven sigil on the wall, Cas no more than ten feet away. Not quite within a comforting reach. The room was spinning from the blow to his head, and he could barely make out the words being spat from Ishim’s mouth.
“Give me ten minutes.” Cas spoke quickly, before hanging up.
“Mmm we should bake pumpkin pie tonight.” He said, pulling away just enough so he could talk.
Footsteps echoed throughout the bunker, and Sam walked into the room.
Eileen gave a little wave from across the room.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas’s voice softened, barely louder than a whisper. His words were effortless, as if they came out as easy as breathing.
“That I don’t like flavoured coffee?” He said with a snort.
“Let's hope Sam doesn't have too many shots of espresso.” Eileen said, faking concern. “I would hate for your baby to pay the price.”
“And what are the other two drinks and names?”
“And don't forget the milk.” Sam added.
Dean smiled back at him, relaxed. Like taking in a deep breath after being under murky water for forty years. He brushed a loose strand of soft, brown hair into its place, before falling back into his spot and closing his eyes. “Crowley would be proud.” He whispered with a soft laugh, smile deepening as Cas joined him.
“I didn't either.” Dean whispered, tears streaming out of his eyes.
He heard Cas’s voice in his head. Telling him what kind of bee it was. “Megalopta. Their eyes are twenty-seven times more sensitive to light, so they’re nocturnal.” He desperately grasped at the memory of Cas’s voice, eyes beginning to sting as he failed to keep hold of the clarity.
“Hey, it's okay Dean. You know I'm perfectly fine with public displays of affection, and no one else even saw us. There's no need to apologize.”
Cas let out a laugh. “Right. Because I’m a good example of an angel.” The sarcasm was masking something else in his voice.
The phone rang four times before Cas's voice broke out, and Dean smiled as his confused tone was perforated with lightheartedness.
The flame pushed against the wind, fire burning bright with fury and need.
His warmth spread throughout Dean, and he felt whole again.
Cas scrambled to catch the spices, successfully grabbing two of them out of the air, the third one intercepted by Dean.
Dean thought. It would honestly be more believable if it wasn’t sugar at all, and instead was in fact Cas’s secret stash of cocaine.
Dean rubbed his eyes again.
“It's a famous drink you can get at Starbucks.” Sam answered.
He crouched beside the small body of running water, watching the tiny fish dance among the rocks. He felt the damp and brilliantly green moss below his fingers, thinking of nothing and everything all at once.
“We didn't get coffee either.” Eileen said. “So don't worry, Dean's the odd man out here.”
He gently spread them throughout the small garden, comprised mainly of beautiful weeds.
Dean thought, struggling to hide a smile.
Every word Fake Cas uttered made his heart ache even more. Dean wanted to reach out and touch him, but Cas wouldn't even look at him.
“That's the one.”
“The one Claire says is for ‘basic bitches’?” He lifted his hands, forming air quotes as he spoke.
“I love you too.” He whispered back.
Dean gave up on letting them choose the music after snickering and requesting “Friday” by Rebecca Black for the third time in a row.
“I’m… not sure. God never had control over the Empty, but I’ll try.”
He shot up, not used to hearing that voice anywhere other than the same few words on the phone. If he could
“Do we have nutmeg?” Eileen said, breaking away from Sam’s grip to check one of the cabinets. He walked to the other side of the kitchen, intending to look through the spice rack, knowing exactly what his girlfriend was getting at.
Beyond the gate was a garden. One clearly left to care for itself, as the blooming flowers were crossed with rose bushes which wrapped around anything it could hold on to.
“Oh shut up. What are you, seven?”
His already flickering smile faded as he realized that Jody and Donna had turned to dust like every other person in their god-forsaken universe.
“I'm sorry.” He whispered. “I just can't keep losing you.”
His eyes revealed nothing but pure devotion for the man he was staring at. A silent promise, one without pressure, that he would be standing there, and Dean could take the leap anytime he wanted.
The figure of Dean melted into a puddle of black, before taking on the form Cas was used to calling his own.
The room was untouched, air stale. The only indication that someone ever lived there was the one rumpled pillow and a single book that rested on the bedside table.
, in public.
“You better not mess up my damn kitchen.” He said quickly. “Or you're organising them all next time.”
“Yes, Sam told me.“
They left shortly after, the drive over painful for everyone except Dean, who listened to the same four songs on repeat the entire hour.
Dean debated calling him again, before giving in to the pointless desire.
“Ooh. The peppermint mocha looks good.” Cas was reading the limited edition drinks on the drive-thru menu as they traveled across the parking lot.
“Since when do you need to use the front door?” He asked, before clumsily walking down the stairs.
Cas sighed, but the corner of his mouth upturned in a grin. “John Henry Bohnham, affectionately referred to as ‘Bonzo’, born in 1948 and was most well known for being the drummer of the rock band ‘Led Zeppelin’.”
(He wasn’t about to have any black-eyed minions reporting his Starbucks order to a very judgmental Queen of Hell.)
.” He stressed his partner’s name. “Who’s John Bonham?”
Or them.
“I want to try Starbucks.” Cas said the next morning, both of them still in bed.
“A win-win situation, really.” Cas smiled before tugging Dean close so their lips met again.
“Thank you.” She said with a smile, grabbing the plastic spice jars.
“Don’t, Sam.” Dean closed his eyes. “Please.” The words felt like swallowing shards of broken glass.
Dean sat on the bed carefully, making sure not to disrupt the silence.
“Did you two go to Starbucks?”
But Dean didn't whisper back.
Cas took a sip from his pumpkin spice latte, gleefully smiling. “As much as I like trying different drinks, I think I might start just getting this one. It's my favourite.”
man. Not because of your wings, or your mojo, and I was so damn lucky to have you ‘round, and I know I didn't tell you enough. There's this hole inside me without you, Cas. I miss you so damn much, and I just want you to come home."
“Well you two are a real Martha Stewart, aren't you?”
It was Dean’s own copy of Slaughterhouse-Five, and the bookmark sat about 50 pages in.
They saved the entire universe, and yet he still felt like a piece of him was missing.
“At a motel in Lebanon. I couldn't go very far.”
“What’s a pumpkin spice latte?” He looked at Eileen before snatching the bottle of cinnamon from Dean.
While the thoughts in his head were screaming mercilessly, the drive home was in a simple silence. The only noise being Cas’s occasional sip, and the sound of soft fabric rubbing against skin as Cas moved his hand in small, comforting motions against Dean's back.
“I'm sorry.” He pulled Cas into a hug, gripping his trenchcoat as tightly as he could.
His thoughts traveled back to Ishim doing the same thing with his coffee, in the tiny little diner Cas had set up as a meeting place. Dean had barged in that day, not thinking of his brother mocking him, or the possibility of danger inside. His vision was as tunneled as his thoughts  focused only on Cas, not caring about anything else.
“I think I'll just drink my water.”
Cas, meanwhile, turned to a random page of the lore book resting on the table and started reading in an attempt to pass the time.
“But you will come back, right?”
“I'll take just a black coffee.”
He heard himself bark in laughter, struggling to keep quiet.
He looked into Cas’s bright blue eyes, and reached out to grab his hand.
With a pang of guilt from the memory, Dean pulled himself closer to Cas and rested his head on the other man’s chest. He wrapped his arms around him, trying to preserve as much warmth and comfort as he could until they had to inevitably get out of bed. “Only if you let me sleep like this for thirty more minutes.”
He turned slightly, until he was face to face with someone he never thought he would see again.
Cas rested his head on the crook of Dean’s neck and whispered. “You know you don't have to pretend.”
It led him to Cas’s bedroom, which he noted was hauntingly empty.
He remembered something Cas had told him once: “Hatred isn’t a natural trait, Dean, it’s a learned one. A baby isn’t born with the ability to hate, it’s passed on from one broken soul to another. Love, love however. That’s something different altogether.”
Dean watched the fire lick at the tarp covering Cas, sitting atop a pyre made from wood. Face expressionless yet reeking of loss. Reflection of embers the only light in his glossed over eyes. He moved almost robotically, gathering the ashes after the fire burnt out, heading for the only place he knew he could turn to.
“Is Cas your gay thing?”
He thought with a bitter laugh.
“I'm going to kill Sam for teaching you that.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, trying to replace the image of Cas being pulled into the depths of tangible darkness with stars.
He registered the slam of Baby’s door, realizing it was his own hand that caused it. He turned to look at the meadow, breeze gently blowing against his face, and ever so slightly taking the dew drops from blades of grass with it.
Dean cleared his throat. “Mornin’ Sunshine.”
Cas, at least, since apparently Sam couldn't see him.
“Dean?” Cas whispered.
But that wasn't where Cas was.
“What are you two arguing about this time?” Eileen asked from the library.
“Well, I would hope not.” It smiled gleefully. “Because not only is he not coming, but he's actually
(Dean didn’t care.)
“Hm?” Dean turned his head to look at him, eyes not failing to glow with their unusually bright, green pigment. He took a deep breath, the lids of his eyes already started to slowly fall back down again.
“Oh and Dean?”
Cas had stopped looking at him.
“We might as well just live here.” He said, tone dripping with sarcasm.
Cas had millenniums to choose from, but always found the most interesting hunts to be the ones with the Winchesters. He also had many hilarious stories about his adventures with Crowley, but he was less fond of those.
When they got out of bed and ventured into the rest of the bunker, they found Sam and Eileen in the library.
“I'm a human, you ass.” Cas responded, a smile tugging at his lips. “Besides, I know you liked mine yesterday.”
Cas laughed at him.
He heard Cas get out, his feet making a crunching noise as they hit the gravel, and watched from across the top of the car as he started towards the coffee shop. Dean looked at the building warily, reluctance painted on his face.
Nothing at all like apple pie, but still delicious.
“We're not gossiping.” Sam said indignantly.
“I know.” The words barely came out as a whisper, hot tears betraying Dean’s eyes as they silently leaked out and ran down his cheeks.
“Let me say that again, in case you weren’t listening. It's an hour away. For coffee. That isn't even that good.”
“You know what?” He reached out and grasped Cas’s hand firmly. “I was thinking about being less boring. What ingredients do you suggest I try?”
about angels.” He muttered.
Dean carefully grabbed the hot mug from Cas and took a sip. He was right, it did taste kinda like pumpkin pie. He took another sip, letting the pleasant flavor sit on his tongue. The different spices mixed perfectly together.
“Uh, hello?”
Dean couldn’t believe those words were coming from the same man who drinks exactly a hundred and one ounces of water a day. (Which, according to Sam, is the recommended amount for males, as stated by the Institute of Medicine.)
He was finally starting to understand why life seemed to lose all meaning when Cas was gone, and from there he could slowly start to rebuild both of them.
“Nothing.” Cas answered, smile not faltering.
Dean sat in the library, pouring over stacks of lore books and journals. Searching for anything that could help him break open and kick the Empty’s angel-stealing ass.
Jack looked startled.
“It's an hour away.”
Cas walked out from behind one of the bookshelves, and Dean inhaled quickly, immediately forgetting his helpless state.
They hadn't even finished parking before Sam had jumped out of the Impala and ran towards the bunker’s garage to get his own car.
