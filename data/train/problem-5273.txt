Jimmy turned to Castiel and gave him a look that made him want the ground to just open up underneath him and swallow him up whole. "I'm ready to fight for Heavan," Jimmy announced, reaching for the scroll in the soldier's hand.
Castiel inhaled deeply for a moment-
"And so are humans and angels," Jimmy answered. There was that metaphor that Castiel was looking for.
When Castiel woke up, he found that his throat was parched and that his entire left arm was aching from being slept on the entire night.
That was the final straw that broke the camel's back. In that one moment, Castiel's world came crashing down. No matter what, his brother was always there for him and he looked up to Jimmy. So when those three words came out, Castiel barely held in a sob.
was shoved right in his face.
Dean was about to accept immediately when Sam spoke up. "Sorry, we have to wait for our Dad first. He's planning to have a talk with us first then-"
He looked alert and vigilant, which was never a good sign for a soldier.
The angel crashed violently against the ground and continued to tumble down the slope of the cliff until he rolled to a stop.
Jimmy sighed from the opposite side.
Literally.
For a moment, none of them moved.
A very deep and steep cliff.
When they were done picking out the items, Dean left Sam with several crumpled up wads of bills (cue bitchface #28), he walked away from the front and pulled out his phone. Sure, it was outdated compared to what he saw on the cashier (how the actual hell do you operate those things without any buttons, the future
Of course, he couldn't do it without Sam as his best man, his future-wife-to-be or pie being at the table but who else was there? Maybe some hunter friends and a band but that's all he could rack his brain for. He didn't even know whether or not his own father would show. And his mother? He didn't know how long his mother was back for. A few months? A year? A few years? What about a whole decade? It terrified him to know how much has changed in the future and how many people he could have lost.
For that reason alone, he was named after Cassiel, the Angel of Thursday, for it was the day that he was born in. While the people of Pontiac weren't so easy to accept the extra appendages, his mother accepted him gleefully.
Castiel stopped running and stared in mortification as he watched the events unfold right in front of him.
Castiel's blade was knocked out of his hand and soared over the ledge and down to the base of the cliff. Ramiel reached out and gripped the angel's chest, squeezing it painfully.
"Jack? I told you to not run off like that!"
"Y'know, you could've at least cleaned yourself up before we head out." Dean swung his hands back and forth before heading to the door. "You stink worse than leftover shifter skin." He left the motel and looked around. Sam gave him an exasperated bitchface #29 as he followed after him.
"You know what I mean." Mary gave him a look that read 'You can't lie to me'.
He shouldn't be alive. The Yellow-Eyed Demon practically tore him apart.
They were mostly wiped before they were forty, unless they retired, which made Bobby rarer than he seemed. Then again, he mainly just answered calls and assisted on hunts but still dangerous nevertheless. Hunters usually died on the job and that's how Dean figured how his own life would end. Or not, as it seemed.
But as he raced towards the statue and slipped past the sides, the grandmaster, instead of tripping like he planned,
But instead of resentment from his brother-
Maybe if he were to...
A few demons had attempted to follow after him but he was certain that he had shaken most of them away.
need to fight. And where would I even go? There's nowhere else to go!"
Castiel shed away from his brother, feeling shame fill him head to toe. He wanted Jimmy's support but he was messing up already.
"So, who's the lady?" Younger Sam spoke up after they were a safe distance away from the kitchen. His eyes were cast down on the floor, his face expressionless. "And don't you dare say 'who are you talking about'?"
Younger Sam hated that the older version of himself was right but he just couldn't imagine it. For him, losing and gaining Jessica was everything to him. He was going to marry her but, of course, the Winchester luck just had to strike anyone who was near them and it struck right on par. Losing her was his fuel engine. His fury. His motivation. It helped that Dean was by his side too but the only reason he didn't return to the college was that he knew he had to get revenge.
The ground erupted from below.
It seemed that he wasn't the only one who heard the sound. Ketch and the rest of the soldiers glanced up at the sky as well.
When Bobby was done, Castiel couldn't breathe. The armor was weighing him down so much and was severely uncomfortable, he'd be better in a skunk dress. It ached the most where the plates of the armor were pressed right up against his wings the most.
"I can't see the wing, can you see the wing?"
"...Perhaps."
. A child who had to grow up knowing how to hunt, how to kill. Did Dean end up like his own father? What if he did? What in the world was he thinking when he taught her? Did her mother protest when he handed her the gun? Or scold him when she showed up covered in bruises and scars?
Dazed, he sat up and rubbed at his eyes but regretted moving when his arm lit aflame with numbing sensations.
There was only one way they could achieve such transportation and that was through their wings. With a flight that extensive, it would strain him greatly but he would recover.
No, he wasn't going to let Jimmy's life come to an end like this. He was going to do something about it once and for all.
Castiel couldn't be that
Samuel seemed to sense his discomfort because the next thing the horse did was poke his huge long face in and nudged Castiel so that his body was more balanced on the bench than leaning off the plank.
Older Sam frowned at the younger version of himself. "I know you're upset and I would be to-" Younger Sam lifted his head up from the floor and shot him a look. "Then why did you forget her?"
Fuck.
Somewhere in the clouds, a hundredth eye blinked open.
He lunged at Ramiel again and the two traded blows, but in the midst of their battle, they didn't notice that they were getting closer and closer to the edge of a cliff.
Dinner was quiet.
Castiel sighed. It wasn't like him to think of the future much. He never put much thought about his future, in fears of getting over his head.
But after what seemed like an hour or two, he noticed something.
Castiel crawled up to the 1967 Chevy impala, closed his eyes, and allowed his essence to be contained inside of the car.
It was a bloody wonder how the man managed to score a wife who put up with his bullshit. If only she hadn't been wasted by an angel during the first ever human-angel war and spurred John on to a blind rage of proclaimed "justice".
He was trapped.
Castiel strapped the saddle to Samuel's back, using what he remembered from watching Jimmy's own setup to apply it successfully. Eventually, he got it through and the saddle stayed on securely. Castiel lit up with success and a surge of adrenaline shot through him.
Lucifer unraveled his wings with an almighty roar and sped to the front of the line. The dark energy that swarmed around him was unmatched. The energy worsened when Lucifer's eyes rose from the ground and was met by Michael's own unwavering stare.
going to get zealous?
Relationships were looked down on in the hunting community. You never stick around with a civilian unless you're preparing to train them for hunting as well or they're way in too deep and no one wants that on their conscience. If a hunter wanted something, it would usually be sex and nothing else. No relationships. No strings tied.
Quiet if you dismiss the constant grunting and movement of 22-year old Castiel. He danced back and forth in his living room, training last minute for the hardship ceremony, using a wooden stick to beat a rice bag that was suspended from the ceiling. It swayed back and forth with each hard whack of the stick.
That, he wasn't too eager about.
make it to the ceremony on time.
When the man called out his name, Castiel stood up in a hurry, raising his hand to the sky but knocking his sword over, causing it to clatter to the floor loudly.
And explode it did.
"Actually," Jimmy protested. "I was going to say that the 'lesson' or moral was that even with all of those hateful comments about you, you're still going to emerge out beautiful and amazing as ever." He leans back.
Castiel shuffled sheepishly in the middle of the forge. "About that..."
A beam of pure energy shot out of the shape, barely giving them a chance to duck. Castiel was thrown back from the blast site, crashing through several trees before hitting a large rock, splitting it right in half.
THIS IS NOT BETA'D
Castiel swung his legs up sharply and kicked the demon in the chest, putting as much force he could fester.
She continued.
But even with that promise in mind, he would never imagine himself married. He wondered briefly what the wedding ceremony was like.
Sam was confused, the hell was his father on about until he realized that the older man was pointing at the doorways and windows.
Castiel had landed inside of a militia. And even worse, his wings were out of commission so he couldn't even fly away.
Earth looked just as lovely as the last time he came there, if not a little dry.
"Don't bother, he's long gone by now." Bobby waved his hand. "Crowley saw him charging outside on Sammy and your armor on him."
The Grandmaster was right. He
Shit.
"Earth."
Castiel looked from side to side, attempting to find a route out before turning around.
For the briefest moment, Castiel dared to let out a sigh of relief, glad that the moment was over.
Castiel lifted his head and locked eyes with Jimmy. His chest constricted. He didn't want to be met with shame and disappointment, something that he already sunk himself deep into.
Jimmy's mouth swung agape. "Castiel is- what? That can't be." He closed the door behind him and rushed upstairs. "Castiel?" He called out but no response came back to him. Jimmy stepped into his brother's room and froze. The room was untouched.
An uneasy feeling filled his chest as he slept but it was quickly wiped away as he passed out.
The scene was calm and collected. Castiel didn't belong at all. He was a hurricane of calamity that would soon need to be released. He was a splatter of violent red in a sea of blue.
Castiel grunted as he stumbled forward before spinning around to face Ramiel. "You're a disappointment, Castiel," He sneered. "Oh great Seraph, I expected more of a fight."
Wait.
He watched as the dark-haired man from earlier- Ketch stepped out of his vehicle and held his rifle carefully in his hand, as if Castiel was in any shape to do any harm.
Castiel dropped onto his feet then took a running start before leaping and rammed the spear straight through Ramiel's chest, right where the heart would be.
It would be a miracle if he was to survive such a transformation, especially to an immobile vessel that was as broken down as this.
Ramiel descended beside him with a loud thud. He strolled up to the fallen angel and picked up the unconscious body.
"You should have been at the forge already! Bobby's been waiting for you for five minutes now." Jimmy continued to scold him, looking more stressed the more the seconds pass. "Do you have your ceremonial blade?"
They weren't salted.
Cas unstrapped his heavy armor (
He had already begun to form a plan in his head. He swerved towards the medium-sized statues in the hopes of getting the grandmaster to trip and knock himself down onto his back where Castiel could easily disarm him and make a speedy getaway.
The list of names went on and on.
There was a sound, a peculiar sound of blankets flapping before green eyes met blue and everything went black.
Jimmy took off, dashing for the armory. He stopped at the doorway when he saw the sliced feathers on the floor. His chest seized and he fell to the floor, just barely faceplanting onto the floor, thanks to Bobby catching the man.
I WILL UPDATE IT THE NEXT DAY FOR ANY GRAMMAR MISTAKES ETC
"Then call him and we'll make plans." Mary filled in, crossing her arms. "John's... complicated. I know, Dean and Sam shared their troubles with me." She sighed. "I'll talk to him if you don't want to." She suggested.
When Dean questioned his mom about it, however, she simply looking over at Jack and gave him a smile only a mother could give to her children. "Jack is... special. He's truly one of a kind." Mary said softly. "He's been through a lot. But you always make it so much better for him."
mites), all sorts of small animals (squirrels were the worst)
It was like balancing anvils on his body and as extreme as that sounded, it was exactly how Castiel felt. Maybe it wouldn't hurt if he took off his helmet or boots. Would that be too much of a problem? Surely not, right?
"Sammy!" Dean barked, snapping his fingers painfully. "You gotta stay awake, man. Can't expect me to move
"Hell yeah, Cas."
Castiel reluctantly agreed.
Hell, he even tried dialing some of the very few hunters that they had teamed up before. Nothing.
Castiel

"Jimmy-" Castiel protested but Jimmy cut him off sharply.
awesome after all), but it worked handily.
As Castiel has discovered in the past, it wasn't exactly a good idea to shave his feathers. He had once accidentally sliced a blood feather while trying to shorten his wings, and not only did it take nearly a month to recover, he was advised to never do it again. But it was the necessary thing to do. Otherwise, he would be executed upon arrival at the camp.
Roy didn't spare another second before taking several steps back then racing towards the nearest watchtower, where he knew there would be a sigil. Already, in the distance, he could see other sigils being lit up as well, creating beacons into the dark sky. They had been attacked as well.
The living room was empty. The kitchen had no sight of Jimmy either but there was evidence that he had been there earlier.
Sam frowns. That's exactly how he felt as well. He checked his own body over, his frown darkening as he found that every single wound had been cleaned and wiped over like it had never existed in the first place. It was so very disorienting, especially when they had just been minutes away from death earlier.
Blue-Eyes, presumably Cas (what the hell kind of name was that?), smiled back at other Dean, almost childishly before leaning in and planting a kiss- Dean widened his eyes at the realization that the two were probably a couple.
like a furnace in the suit)
Castiel winced.
At last, he made it out of the forest and onto a clearing. But he slowed to a stopped when he realized that on the other side was a line of soldiers, their carriages used as barracks and rifles aimed at him.
"Mhm." Dean hummed before standing up. "Alright but let me get cleaned up first." He turned around and headed to the bathroom. He walked over to the sink and splashed some cold water on himself, blinking away the drops of water. When he looked back up at the mirror, flashes of last night's dream floated to his head.
Nobody knew how it happened but when he was born, there were two identical fleshy nubs on his back, right below where his shoulder blades were.
Why didn't Jimmy come after him? Did Castiel really not matter that much to him? Jimmy was the older brother, he was supposed to look after him.
Imperial messengers.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows and focused on the year. What's the hell's wrong with-
There, on the cold hard floor, he curled up tightly, shaking as he wept. It has been a long time since he had felt this way. He was overwhelmed. He wasn't ready for his brother to go off into another war and sacrifice himself.
Dean frowned. How could John just ignore them at a time like this? It was ridiculous how he treated his sons. Sam seemed to have a similar thought because he ended the call without leaving a voicemail and slid his phone into his pocket, knowing that it didn't matter whether or not he left a voicemail and that John will be pissed at them anyways.
"Then go!"
Ketch's mouth curved into a slight frown as he raised his hand, signaling for his soldiers to stand down. "Hold your fire." He ordered. Castiel calmed down a little but remained defensive. At last, a chance for negotiation-
"The Novak family!"
Castiel gasped as a large and sharp object pierce through his wing and dug into his back, causing him to fall down. He cried out in pain, for the wing was the most vulnerable part of an angel.
The wind roared and rain thundered around him as he ran to the family shrine. He climbed up the ancient statue of the great Archangel of the Lord and wept at its feet, his wings bending to form a roof above his head.
"You lost it, haven't you?"
Loud was never a good thing for Castiel.
A slightly elder man stepped up to the soldier holding the scroll and took it from his awaiting hands, exchanging a brief nod. The soldier reached into his bag and pulled out another scroll.
But he wouldn't use silence as a solution. To him, that was the worst way to resolve an issue.
"Dean! Look at the year!" Sam shouted in panic.
The man frowned deeply and marked the board with an 'X'.
When the older man failed to comply, Dean cursed. He focused on trying to stand up instead, dragging himself to a tree. He glanced at Sam, who looked like he was seconds away from passing out.
And as of now? The angels were being backed up against the center of Heaven, surrounded by demons.
Shivering.
He lifted Castiel up to the sky and took a step forward, holding him right above the deep edge and dared to drop him.
He bent down and scooped his father up, panting heavily as he did. By all means, Dean dragged his dad along with him. "Come on, Sam, help me." He pleaded, feeling large drops of sweat dripping off of his face. Dean looked around and spotted a motel nearby.
Woah.
As they made it past the Pontiac gates, a man in black and red robes sat up on the roof of his house and frowned deeply. "Oh feathers, what have you gotten yourself into this time?"
Dean's dreams were plagued by yellow glowing eyes and a bright white light filling his visions as a loud horn blared right in front of him. He felt the collision but he wasn't dead.
For a moment, everything was silent. It was just two lost siblings staring at each other.
Castiel frowned as he gave it a few more tugs. It was still stuck.
Soon enough, he'll forget about it. Surely.
Every hallway, every corridor, every walkway was littered with bodies, all of which were a combination of the corpses of angels and demons.
Roy's eyes lingered on the standing dark figure before slamming his fist on the sigil, causing an explosion of light that caused Roy to shield his eyes and he was even sure he saw Lucifer squint his eyes a little.
"And do you..." Dean hoped that she didn't. Claire didn't exactly hold that wide blue eyes innocent look but she didn't have to be traumatized by hunting. The girl in question gave him a confused look.
There must surely be a catch somewhere, right?
He reaches back down to the sack of grain and loosely tosses a handful of seeds out onto the floor. The chickens sped over to them in a flurry of feathers and beaks.
He had only seen glimpses of this place when Jimmy had his own turn with the ceremony and he peered in through the doors when they opened. So to see the place in its full glory and being able to admire it was transfixing. It's still as incredible as he last recalled.
Castiel nodded before standing up, reaching down and scooping his blade back into his holster before racing after the grandmaster. He clicked the door shut behind them as he walked inside, looking around the estate.
But before he could go back from the path that he came from, the truck that was chasing him pulled up, also blocking the other side of the site.
Sam sighed heavily as he looked back from Dean to back the door that John left from, switching between the two.
Would it be worth it if he sliced off his own wings? He had definitely thought about it in the past but he could never truly go through with it. But as his future seemed more and more bleak, the option of self-destruction looked wasn't that bad.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean heaved his brother back onto the asphalt pavement and turned to his father.
"The Rayne family!"
One guard thought it was foolish. Who would think to penetrate a wall this thick and tall? And lined with guards that stayed up nearly all day and night, ready to fight for their lives?
"It's my role in life to serve and protect my home!"
Roy gasped as he lifted his head up high and stared at the top of the watchtower, the source of the shadow.
"There's plenty of other people to fight in the war! Why do
As much as he had confidence in himself, he knew that his chances weren't going to be high regardless.
"My armor?" Jimmy froze. No, this can't be.
It was so peculiar how Lucifer always accompanied his angels' raids, how he was so susceptible to offenses. Of course, that was exactly what he was counting on. The troops would always fall for the parlor trick. They always underestimated him right until the last second where he would unravel his wings and expose them with all of his glory. There wasn't a single survivor who could the others about this strategy until the Last Battle of The Silver City.
Suddenly, a rumbling sound came from both Dean and Sam's stomach. Dean felt his cheeks light up with a vibrant red as he remembered that he hadn't eaten since this morning and he had been doing work all day (Sam would protest to that however).
And as expected, Roy was the first amongst many to expire that night.
But it also pained Dean, knowing that Sam still had the wound of Jess fresh in his mind and now coming across a version of himself that had already gotten past her death and found someone new to love. It was unfair and Dean still wished that Sam had married Jess and Dean could attend their wedding.
Castiel's hand clenched the twig in his hand tighter.
He leaped down and positioned the bag up so that no more grains would spill out but by then, nearly half of its mass had gone out to the floor. This was going to be an absolute
"Dean?" He asked, his voice raspy. Dean nodded quickly as he reached out to him. "Sam. Can you move?" Sam mumbled something but Dean couldn't quite pick it up. He let out a frustrated hiss and tried to move his leg underneath his father, using his arms to flip him onto his back. "Dad! Wake up!" Dean shouted in his face, shaking his shoulders.
Because they were so big and Heaven knows that the winds were strong in Pontiac, his wings would get caught up on the updraft, catapulting him across the street. Sure, it might be humorous for a small bit but after the seventh time? It's. Humiliating. And. Grating.
"Dean," Sam sighs before shaking his head. "Look, if we really are in the future then what if we mess something up major? Like- Like what if we stumble into something or someone we're not supposed to know or do something wrong? What if we end the univer-"
"So, you're my... step-daughter?" Dean stares down at the illuminated screen in shock. Claire shrugged offhandedly. She didn't seem too troubled by the fact that the younger version of her step... dad was right in front of her. Almost like she had been used to unnatural things happening. The bottom of his stomach twisted.
As they arrived in front of Castiel's house, he slid off of Samuel's back and trudged inside of the house, too tired to do anything else. He spotted the messily placed away rice bag from that morning as well as the wooden stick that Castiel had used as a brief sword.
With shaky hands, he pushed himself onto his feet, staggering as he got up then took off. Just mere seconds later, the vehicle tore through the trees and chased after him
"Is that James or the halo?"
He hoped that he didn't fail this task at least. Slowly he drew his broadsword from his holster, but before he could pull out all the way, something got caught on the edge, preventing a swift removal.
"Castiel," Jimmy warned.
swan. And he's much more beautiful than all the other grown-up ducks in his nest." Jimmy raises his hand in emphasis, a certain light in his eyes that Castiel has only seen on rare occasions.
Dean couldn't help but feel immensely jealous at this. He expected Sam to be more careful and when he got closer to Mary, Dean cursed himself at being too paranoid to take the chance for himself. Yes, they had a deep conversation with each other but it didn't make up for the decade's worth of lost time and that hurt him even more because every time he parted away from his mother, he always came up with more things to say.
He stiffened before he made his way out of the house, stepping down the porched stairs. Castiel walked up to Jimmy and slumped down beside him, or rather, as far away from him as possible, for he was sitting so close to the edge that it would only take a light shove for him to fall off.
Castiel didn't know how long he was flying for. By the time he had reached Earth's atmosphere and felt his body burn up, his wings were already numb from the flight.
His childhood instincts kicked in as he got up quickly and scrambled onto his feet.
He could hear the other townspeople around them started to laugh. Embarrassed and mortified, he ran back inside his house. He barely heard Metatron's mocking shouts chasing after him over the static in his head.
Castiel ducks his head and pressed his face into Samuel's mane as he rode the steed.
He gave himself a mental note to not shape his hair like that before leaving the bathroom and joining up with Sam, who was standing by the door, waiting patiently for him.
Castiel reached behind him and tore out the harpoon stick, regretting it as some of his skin got caught on the jagged tip and tore messily from the wing.
"Then let's ensure that."
He had to get his morning tasks done as fast as possible if he had any hopes of making it early to the hardship ceremony, after all, punctuality was one of the most important tests.
through the entrance, his clothes in shambles and face panicked. He crash-landed right at Bobby's feet then got up quickly, brushing himself off.
For a second, Dean thought Blue-Eyes was talking to him, only for the other man to lean his head back and chuckle loosely. He picked up a beer and popped it open, licking his lips.
Castiel wasn't ungrateful for his brother's commitment to their homes, however. He was proud that Jimmy was brave enough to go to war and head to head with the terrifying angels that terrorized the nearby villages, but the damage that was dealt to Jimmy after the war was a sight to behold.
He looked extremely irritated to have to be met with the sudden crowd outside his house at this time of the day, judging by his stern eyebrows and that dark look in his eyes.
He was no way prepared when the older Sam smiled softly in response and shook his head almost in disbelief before looking Dean straight in the eye
" The grandmaster grabbed his own sword from his waist, pulling it out effortlessly. Castiel got onto his feet with a panicked shriek, scrambling for his weapon. He managed to duck just in time as the elder swung the blade over his head.
Shrill screams and desperate flapping came from the angel's side.
, when he’d come to accept that he didn’t want one.
“Cas?” His head jerks up, and then he pulls himself off the floor, sits on the edge of the bed so he can lean over him, so he can watch his eyes blink slowly open and focus in on him. “Holy shit, Cas, I-- Hey, I didn’t…
“Dean… the reason we got him back… He doesn’t belong to the Empty now.”
“Oh, no, it’s going to be a natural birth.” Cas shakes his head. “Rowena has everything planed out.”
After lunch, Castiel presents Dean with a pair of gardening shears, before walking with him to the roses along the right side fence.
“What do you feel like?”
He strips out of his jacket and his flannel shirt, and Cas gently folds both and places them on a nearby folding chair.
“Feels kind of like it might be. If I pushed you into too much, the other day--”
“Hey, gotta be fond of something, right?” Dean winks, and Cas nearly blurts out ‘I’m fond of you’, but stops himself.
“This is some real Jane Austen shit, you know that? We don’t even get to first base and I’m… you know.” He folds his arms again, looks away. “When we actually lock lips, I don’t know what’s gonna happen, but I hope it happens behind closed doors, that’s all I’m saying.”
“When are you leaving?”
“I’m not against dogs. I prefer cats.” He shrugs.
“Yeah.” Sam flashes her a smile, unsteady but grateful. “Yeah, he’ll love that. I just… I don’t  know how he’ll be after this. When we were kids… I know he struggled with his early heats, even before I understood much about what he was going through. And our father didn’t exactly help… didn’t cut Dean any slack just because he was suffering. I know this is different, and he’s safe, and it’s great, but… I just worry about him. After he was taken, after everything he went through while I was growing up in an actual home… Ever since you guys gave him back to me, we’ve seen each other every day. When we’re not both here, you know… he goes to the center with me when I’m in the office, or I pick him up from Jody’s place so we can go out to dinner or just so we can hang. This is the first time since that picnic that I’m not going to see him for days, and I totally get why, it was mortifying enough being stuck on opposite sides of a bathroom door before I presented, pretty sure we’d be gagging on each other’s scent if we had to be in the same room now, and beyond embarrassed, just…”
He does, Cas supporting him with a firm hand when his legs wobble. From the front, he’s a prettier sight than he’d been before, when he’d been admiring himself on his own. His eyes are wide and dark, his lips are flushed, and so are his cheeks. His nipples had been cute before, sure, but now they could cut glass. He’s not really
“Well… here.” And then Dean’s phone is playing music, tinny over the speakers, sitting on Cas’ nightstand. “Better than nothing. I got the balm Rowena told me to, do you need help with it?”
“And vice-versa.” He snorts. “Alphas win, at any cost. Alphas
“She’ll be here a little later, she’ll be glad to hear.” Cas nods.
“Thank you, Dean. Your faith is… it’s much appreciated. More than I can say. As for what I am…”
There’s Cas’ handprint, yes. In the little blank at the center of his palm, a C in brilliant blue, a D in forest green, their elaborate flourishes intertwined. In tiny tawny gold script in the space between palm and fingers, symbols in Enochian that Cas must have shown her. Another line runs in black beneath the heel of his hand, like a bracelet.
“Beloved…” Cas strokes his face. “What troubles you now?”
“Have I had a haircut in the last ten
“You’re not thrilled.”
He’d leashed him just in case, but he’s happy to see Tybalt settle on the cushion of the white wicker footrest, calm once more.
Friendship, Family, and moving Forward...
“No.” A grin breaks out across his face. “Not at all.”
“Like a scar.” He breathes the words out and squeezes back, his hand all lotion-soft, even with the familiar calluses. “It’s always a part of me… and sometimes I can feel proud to have survived it, and sometimes I will feel ‘gross’ because it happened.”
it fills him with! “Dean… come here.”
Cas has never touched his bare back before today, he realizes dimly-- he’s rubbed his shoulders through his shirt, he does that every time Dean’s done any physical training, even when it’s just a normal day in the gym and not running the obstacle course over and over for a weekend. But he hadn’t even thought twice about not wearing a shirt this time, and he doesn’t second-guess that as he lies down on the bed, snuggling Cas’ pillow in his arms and feeling the bed dip under Cas’ knees.
“I’m fine, Dean. Fatigued, but uninjured.” And his voice is soft, and his smile is soft, and the pressure of his hand is soft as it rests on Dean’s arm, and this… this is what being happy is, even with the end of the world hanging over their heads. “I would like to be appraised of our next steps.”
Sam lets out a humorless laugh, tucking the photo away again as he gets to his feet.
“I’m in touch with Dean’s brother-- or, he got in touch with me. About working with the center. I thought I should talk to Dean before I said anything, but… this isn’t one of those cases where Dean needs protecting from a relative, it’s just… How to handle it should be his choice, ultimately. And… and Dean will decide what he needs to, but first, he’d like you to meet Sam, too.”
And then Dean’s got to keep his legs spread without Cas’ help, because Cas’ other hand is on him now, his fingers gently exploring labia Dean barely pays attention to himself, when he’s getting off solo. It’s a whole other thing, to have the man he loves, the man he’s invited, touching him this way, electric sparks running up his spine and the hungry, wet
“He just left you there for good?” Dean asks-- it’s the rising of his voice that catches Cas’ ear, and he knows he shouldn’t eavesdrop but once he’s tuned into Dean, it’s impossible not to hear him, and if he can’t help listening to Dean, it seems to make less difference, whether or not he also winds up hearing Sam.
, Dean, it’s only ever been you, you always…”
BEYOND THE STEREOTYPE, it reads. OUR DESIGNATIONS, OURSELVES. And then, beneath that, smaller letters in Garth’s handwriting, EXPLORING HEALTHY SOCIAL DYNAMICS AND HAPPY FUTURES. So it’s that time again… Garth runs two workshop days a year, a couple of people speak but it’s largely a mixer, the chance for omegas in need to make connections… and the chance to talk to omegas who are in stable careers, about serious steady employment in safe work environments. For some, it’s the first time in a long time, if not the first time ever, that they let themselves
“Well. Yes. You’ve put on good weight… you’ve gotten sun-- at least, your face and your forearms have. You look
Castiel puts out the little rack that holds programs and business cards for the center, getting it stocked before settling down to wait for shoppers to start trickling through. A portion of their farmers’ market proceeds always go towards the center, whatever aspect needs funding, and the market is as good a place as any to raise awareness. Plenty of omegas in comfortable lives drop a little change in the tip jar, out of natural sympathy or superstition, a little ‘there but for the grace of God’. They’ve also gotten volunteers just by having pamphlets out on the table, and donations of clothes, shoes, toilet paper… as far as putting forward a public face for the center, to ordinary people in the local community, making the information available while also selling soaps and candies and vegetable starters isn’t a bad tactic.
“Cas is gone.”
“Wondering how you were doing, I mean, not-- Yes?”
The frown turns into something very like a pout, and his eyes rake over Dean’s body, eliciting a completely useless twitch of interest where the spirit is willing and the flesh needs twenty minutes-- give or take. He pushes Dean’s shirt up, palm flat on his bare stomach.
“I’m fucking thinking about it!” He roars, chair clattering backwards as he rockets to his feet. “You don’t have any idea what you’re doing, you’re just offering Cas up as a sacrificial lion-- again!”
“Right. Thanks.” The man nods, folding himself down into the chair, and for all that Cas hates being in charge of interviews, he’s glad he’d taken this batch. Mostly because of the last interview, because he doesn’t like the thought of his pregnant brother dealing with a creep just looking to be around a bunch of vulnerable omegas, but also because the man in front of him is six foot five of complete unmasked alpha.
“I’m here.”
, a thing he can say without hyperbole, but he doesn’t know… he doesn’t know he couldn’t love him back, the way he’s loved.
, Sam.”
“I don’t think I was ever that.” He chuckles. If anything, his blush burns even brighter. “I… I had someone express interest in me
He’s Cas, and Dean owes him an answer.
It’s the rear view, though, that’s special, that he wants. He turns when Cas urges him, looks back over his shoulder to see the deep pink handprint just so on one cheek. It might not be the permanent mark a piece of him craves, but he still loves to see it.
“He’s a good kid. I think he’s probably a lot like me, underneath it all. Not exactly your ‘ideal omega’.” Gabriel snorts, adjusting the signage on the tables marking out prices. “You can see it in him sometimes, but he’s still shutting it down… You busted me out before I’d been gone twenty-four hours, no one ever broke me. Dean didn’t get that lucky.”
“I think it would be good… Sam could meet the people who’ve been helping you recover… people who can reassure him about how okay you are.”
, just
“I appreciate that, but I have weighed my options.”
He cheers Garth on, from his seat on the ledge at the top, braces himself carefully before offering a hand to help haul him the last little way up. Garth is skinny, but wiry, tenacious… he’ll be sore when it’s over, but the good kind, the kind Cas misses. He’ll be proud of himself.
His throat is burning with unshed tears, and he can’t do this, how is he supposed to do this? How is he supposed to carry on now, in the face of all this, knowing Cas had loved him, and knowing he’s gone. Gone, the one place Dean can’t follow him…
“Are you nervous?”
“Hello?”
“Sam.” Jody steps forward, her demeanor too soft to set off any kind of dominance display, but too firm to ignore. She lays a hand on his arm, gentle. “We have protocols. And it would have been crushing, to be told you were going to be reunited with him, and then to hear it was all a mistake. Cas showed up at the house, and talked it out with Dean until he felt ready to see you… I know it feels like you were messed around back there, and I get that that hurts, but he put a rush on making this reunion happen. I promise.”
It’s all sweetness, warmth, only the gentlest sparks beginning to ignite where they touch. He’s not sure who moans first, it feels simultaneous. It’s pulled out of him when Dean’s hands tighten in his coat, when he presses closer, closer…
They’d be the only pack with three alphas, but… maybe that would work. They’d tackle things democratically.
For a day, for an hour even, if he could have him back, he would spend whatever time he got making up for every moment Cas thought Dean could never love him. And that kind of thing, he knows it’s not his forte. He doesn’t know how to say this shit, it never feels quite right when he tries. It’s not that he regrets it when he manages to open up, it’s just that he knows he’s bad at it and he doesn’t know how you get good at it. He knows he doesn’t have the words, but he knows now, too, that he if he couldn’t say it, he could show it. That if the universe could give him just one hour more, just one hour more…
"We can go to Jody's house without him," Jack spoke up, one of his first words since he came into the kitchen (Dean assumed Jody was the friend) and when he spoke, the younger version of Sam jumped nearly a foot into the air while the older Sam just nodded in response to Jack. "And if he calls, we can just tell him that we're there." Mary smiled and nodded. "Yeah, that'll be great, Jack. Thank you for suggesting that." Something about her voice and pose made Dean think that she'd choose that over any other option. Especially if that means direct confrontation.
"No."
Dean turned around to spot a boy approaching him, looking severely confused. "How do you know my name?" Dean asks, feeling a bit anxious.
Castiel has a feeling of the direction that Jimmy is going in but he allows him to talk anyway.
Castiel narrowly avoided a beam of energy aimed for his head and reeled his body back before striking a demon in the chest with an angel blade. He stretched out his arm and fired his grace into the crowd of demons, hoping that it wouldn't miss.
-then lifted his glass and slammed it down on the table so forcefully that it nearly broke.
"Please," Castiel spoke softly. He watched as the soldiers surrounding him became tense and wary, but that was expected. Humans weren't known for being kind to newcomers. "I mean no harm." He tried to plead. He was injured and outnumbered. He wouldn't be able to protect himself if they attacked.
At first, the doctors dismissed it as overt swelling, but as Castiel grew more and more, it became more apparent what the nubs were once the feathers started to grow in.
Of course, he knew the tale of the ugly duckling, as it was one of the most popular children's stories.
The archangel had pale skin and angry red splotches that scattered across his face.
Despite his instincts screaming at him to run away, Roy ventured forth and peeked over the edge of the wall. He was almost relieved to be met by silence until narrow shapes started to emerge from the shadow of the wall.
Jimmy turned around and was about to charge outside when Bobby grabbed his shoulder and held him back.
"What did you just say?" Metatron approached the young half-angel, yanking on his steed's reins sharply. Then, his eyes landed on Castiel's dark wings and they narrowed like as if he had smelled something foul. "You're that
The next thing he knew, something hard clattered against the rocks that the walls were built upon. Roy turned swiftly and was met with surprise once he realized what the object was.
The kid was somewhere in his late teens and had a goofy look to him. Somehow, he reminded Dean of Sam. He nearly turned to Sam and called him over to check the boy out when a motherly voice came from the middle of the aisle.
He nearly tripped over his father's shoes on the way and glanced back at his limp body. Dean bit the bottom of his lip. Dad wasn't supposed to be like this. He was supposed to be invincible. He was all that they ever knew and seeing him like this made Dean feel weak inside, weaker than he had ever been.
Maybe that's why his father left them at such an early age. Castiel's aim wavered as he remembered the faint memory. Those weren't the only problems that his wings caused him, however.
This was it, this was going to be the end of Heaven and all angels.
Apparently, he did something wrong because the grandmaster was already waving his hand at him, motioning for him to stop, a disapproving expression on his face. "Too much mumbling." The grandmaster spoke aloud as he jotted the words into his scribing board. Castiel frowned.
As Winchester stormed in, carrying his helmet in his hand, two guards followed after him, under his leadership presumably. When they stopped several feet from the Empress' throne, John immediately kneeled on one knee while the two guards laid down completely, bowing down to the Empress.
"What is it?" Dean scowls sleepily, irritated by the younger. "Can't I just have an hour of rest?"
It was a simple dinner, steamed vegetables to the side along with noodles with sauce. Castiel and Jimmy sat down on opposite sides as always.
Then came the nightly offenses, when the sun sank underneath the mountains and the land darkened so that nobody could see anyone.
Sure, the armor was made to hide his wings but that doesn't mean the most comfortable option. It wasn't like Castiel could even refuse. They were on a short time crunch and he felt bad for asking Bobby to make another suit when this one took so much time.
Castiel widened his eyes before turning away. He made a mad dash away from the light.
Claire scoffed at the 'truly one of a kind' part when Dean mentioned it, which made him a little more suspicious than he already was. What kind of life does the future behold and why does it always have to be so damn complicated?
He gripped the spear tip with his hand, ignoring how it sliced his palm, before twisting it and running it straight through Ramiel's arm. The demon fell back with a large yell and released Castiel.
Dean narrowed his eyes and took a step closer, examining the two. One of them wore a trenchcoat, complete with blazing blue eyes and dark hair that was mostly covered by a cowboy hat.
But even with Michael's show of power, the angels were still being pushed back.
He preferred to focus more on the present and what's happening right now. At least he can do something about that.
thank you so much for all the positive comments you gave on the previous chapters!
He marched back and forth with a spear in hand, ready to attack anybody at will at this point in an attempt to stave off the drowsiness in his head and the aching in his feet. As he was close to the next watchtower, there was a loud and piercing cry, similar to a human scream. He jumped as a dark shadow swooped in and knocked the helmet off his forehead, making it tumble to the floor.
For a moment, Castiel prepared for himself to get berated at, maybe a little roughhousing. After all, it was what he deserved after the utter shitshow that went down. By completing the ceremony, it would ensure that they would be respected but now, he just turned them into the town's greatest embarrassment.
"I will gladly die if it means providing my services as a soldier."
It was also worth mentioning that he was the same guard that argued that no one with a sane mind would dare attempt to scale a wall this high and strong.
"You expect me to work with this?" Bobby motioned towards Castiel's disheveled state. He glanced at the blade around his waist before snatching it from the poorly made holster.
"Clearly," Younger Sam scoffed, his eyes focused on a silver band around Older Sam's finger that Dean hadn't noticed before.
Castiel gasped loudly as he dropped the sword.
Probably terribly disappointed in him, even his lovable mother.
Kneeling, he lifted up the blade of Jimmy's sword up against his wings and began slicing into the dark. Appearance-wise, Castiel wasn't too worried about his wings. He wasn't too attached to them and he wasn't going to have much use for them in the war, unless he wanted to expose himself, which he was sure would lead to an immediate death sentence.
caused.
Roy made a narrow dodge as one of the angels attempted to strike him with their wing, hitting the hard floor where he once was. He ran to the watchtower where he rushed up a ladder, which he barely made it all the way before it was swept under and cluttered to the ground.
"Jimmy?" Castiel called out slowly. Silence was the only thing that bounced back at him, aside from Samuel's repeated calls from the yard. (Which was strange, Samuel usually barely made any noise.)
a subconscious part of his brain filled in. Everything that dies needs to stay dead. For a brief moment, he wondered if he was in a coma, like one of those fancy movies.
The village of Pontiac was quiet.
Roy was a guard that worked alone. Ever since the previous human-angel war, no guard could venture on their own, in risks of getting caught off guard, killed and therefore, creating an easy and swift entry point for any enemies. Roy thought that was, simply put, bullshit.
He proceeded to his bedroom where he collapsed on the bed, too tired to take off his tattered clothes, and curled up tightly, unfurling his wing for the first time that day. He covered his body with the large blanket of feathers, holding his head in between his arms.
and spread his wings to their full span. He had a moment of relief, having them held back for so long, but it was short-lived when the grandmaster leaped at him. He shallowly avoided another strike, leaving a trail of blue and black feathers behind him as he ran for his life.
Unbeknownst to them, Lucifer saw this as an invitation to start a war, challenging his great and mighty strength.
"This is Ketch... We need-" The man spoke into his radio as he backed away from Castiel but the angel didn't bother to hear the rest of the report. He ran off, speeding through the forest and desperate to find shelter.
Lucifer, the Bearer of Light, the Wicked Tempter, and the Father of Lies.
Dean swallowed thickly, suddenly feeling anxious from what just transpired. He slowly sat up and turned to Sam. "So, uh... Let me guess, he's not very happy, is he?" Dean questioned.
kind of look like Dean, only that he looked way older and had a short of a beard. His hair was shaved weirdly and he looked nothing like Dean.
The hell kind of dream was this? There were either two types of dreams. Dreams that would bring an onslaught of nightmares of his mother burning up, Sam being chopped up or any monster of the week. The other dreams were porno dreams, Deam's favorite, and specialty (but he was straight!)
Lucifer.
He really did look like his brother. He remembered when Bobby called them indistinguishable when they were younger, excluding the wings of course. Now staring at himself, he could see where Bobby was making his point from.
be killed."
Castiel reached up and folded his hair to the side.
The demon froze, then his skin began cracking, his veins lighting up like a fire. He reared his head back and roared loudly as his body began to glow, the radiance almost too bright to look at.
He gasped as he watched cloaked figures pull themselves over the edge, their eyes glowing in the dark and weapons ready. He would bet anything that those were angels. He recognized the large appendages on their backs from anywhere.
"But he grows up to be this
"Get me away," Castiel whispered to Samuel as he climbed on top of the stallion and squeezed his heels around the saddle. He pulled lightly on the reins then sped through the town square gates, leaving everyone behind in the dust
Hunters weren't made out to live long.
Oh, so that's why Samuel was so loud this morning.
Castiel looked around in shock and disbelief as he looked at his surroundings.
Castiel blamed it on the pushy round cheeks and deep shadows above his beady eyes and corners of his mouth.
Double shit.
That the house was unusually quiet. At this time, he would hear pans and bowls being moved around as Jimmy was cooking breakfast or the floorboards creak when he's making his way around the house.
Once he was confident that his older sibling was sleeping, Castiel snuck into the armory. He searched for the registration scroll on the shelves before picking it up, quickly skimming through the paragraphs to find the location of the camp.
"-Ut silentium inposuisset!" Ramiel roared.
"Yeah," Sam nodded. "I- um, sleep tight." He nodded before walking over to the other bed and slipping under the covers.
Castiel quickly glanced at both sides. He was fully surrounded now.
Sam grabbed the calendar and rushed to Dean, practically cramming the pages in his face. Dean widens his eyes and jerks his head back. "What the hell, Sammy?" He looks up at his younger brother.
It sent him flying through the air, only to land painfully next to a stretch of darkened pavement.
. He was partially glad that the Sams were still searching the library because if his Sam was here then he would rattle on and on about the device and it would become a never-ending snore-fest.
"So it's your role in life to
Dean widened his eyes as he realized how badly suited he was. Shit, shit. He turned tails and started running as fast as he could, hoping that he could at least get a headstart.
"Jimmy?" Castiel questioned as the older sibling got up from the bench and ran past him with incredible speed. Even after all of those years and war battles, he was still swift as an arrow.
Castiel was surprised. He had seen Earth before and it was in no shape to be fit for a galactic war.
He yelled outside the door, his voice loud and thundering, and the whole neighborhood became quiet. Castiel curled uptight that night and tucked his head in behind his arms in shame.
to clean up. That is if he can do that
hhhhhhh
"Oh dear ancestors, please help us." The elder muttered under his breath with an exasperated sigh.
But ignoring his brother would only go so far.
For starters? He had wings.
Dean could see a gas station a few meters away, and even a mile further sat a town. The sun was up high, signaling that it was mid-noon, which was surprising since they arrived at the motel near past midnight. No wonder John was pissed that they slept that long. It had been forever though and it was refreshing, for a start.
He could tell that Jimmy was surprised and he was surprised at himself too. It was rare for him to get this fed up and angry over something, especially if it meant for the good of their nation, but if it involved his brother then was there even a chance that he
(He still remembered the hours he spent, washing the waste and stains out of his hair and skin, staring down at the cold show tile until the water finally ran clear)
Older Sam cleared his throat and swept his hand off the table. "We should probably find some way to get you guys home." He stands up, his stance stiff and cranky almost. Mary stood up as well, starting Dean. He nearly forgot that his mother was there.
Sam felt his blood boil. How dare his father act this way? They were nearly killed and his father didn't give a rat's ass about them! For a second, he considered the possibility of his father being possessed by a demon but when he muttered 'christo' under his breath and John's eyes didn't flicker black or yellow, he felt like tearing his hair out.
Naomi held up on hand, halting John immediately. "No, send your armies to protect my people." She stood up, raised her other hand, and pointed in the direction where the villages were. She knew this would irritate John but she could now allow the same events that took place in the last war. They had sent their strongest forces right to Lucifer and he demolished them. It was only by chance that his forces were too withered to defeat the last of Heavan's troops but the damage has already been dealt.
But back to the topic on hand-
On top of the nightstand between the two beds, there was a calendar. At first, Sam thought it was a misprint but as he came closer and flipped through each of the pages, his panic rose more and more.
Older Sam nodded then looked up at his brother and mother. "You two also coming along?"
Heavan soon switched their offense to defense after witnessing the event that transpired from the last war.
No, this can't be.
The place was luxurious, decorated with more statues than Castiel ever seen in his life. They were all aligned in a spiral, facing the center, and lined from shortest to highest. The shortest statue went just barely above Castiel's shoulders and the largest one stretched up to the ceiling where they reached the pillars that held up the ceiling.
His companions and comrades were being slaughtered right before his eyes. Heaven was no longer the home that he once knew. There was no surface anywhere that wasn't touched by blood and violence.
The daily offenses and the nightly offenses.
"Take a guess," Sam sat down on the bed, pressing his hands into his face. "Sorry, I just need a moment to calm down. This is... crazy. Crazy, crazy." He sighed
Was Bobby even still alive?
Claire watched them curiously, her eyes narrowed but didn't comment on the situation.
But this particular one didn't bring anything but confusion.
"The Parkre family!"
During the day, it wasn't like they were loud or made defamatory claims but the response might as well be the same. It was the constant staring and the exaggerated attempts to
It was so damn cool. It was like experiencing one of those sci-fi movies but in
Jimmy stood up, slamming his fists into the table. Castiel hadn't seen him act this way before. He'd only see Jimmy express true anger only a few times so seeing him this was nearly enough for him to back down.
But if Castiel knew one thing, it was that the angels were in a losing battle. He wasn't a strategist for nothing and by the looks of it, their chances of success were... minimal. Their chances for survival were even lower. Castiel knew he wasn't the only one starting to doubt. He had seen the same look of defeat in Anael's eyes as well as his comrades.
Dean. The older one." She smiled apologetically. Dean kinda found it humorous that he was the older brother yet the younger version of himself in that scenario but it didn't feel right to say that out loud.
The statues- The ceremony- Oh
But if it meant to die in battle, fighting for his home, Castiel wouldn't have it any other way.
The village of Pontiac was quiet.
Eventually, the biggest statue in the room tipped over, leaning on the ivory white pillar that supported the ceiling and stayed there.
Of course, the hunter life never truly stops. They would always remember the nightmares that terrorized them. Monsters would continue haunting the world but there were other hunters that would pick up their guns and do their work for them.
Dean turned to his mother and raised an eyebrow, tilting his head as well. "Overdue conversation?" He questioned.
There seemed to be a lot of that going around these days. Silence. Yet, it seemed so
Damn Crowley.
"Send conscription notices throughout the entirety of Heavan. Leave no town untouched." She ordered. "Enlists as many new recruits as possible. We need numbers, fast."
It took a moment for him to realize that the resounding shout came from his lips. Immediately after doing so, Castiel clamped his hands over his mouth.
Technology was wild in the future and he got to experience it firsthand, with his... future step-daughter. It was a very bizarre experience, knowing that you're going to become a father and bonding with someone who already had a father. When his mother handed him the phone and tapped on a series of buttons, Dean was more than surprised to see Claire's face reflected back at him and his own face in a small square off to the side.
Panic reined in Dean as he started looking for Sam. He swerved his head and felt a jolt of shock when he spotted Sam lying against a tree. Dean gritted his teeth before yelling out a quick "Sam!", wincing at the sound of his voice. When the younger didn't respond, Dean shouted his name louder. This time, Sam lolled his head upwards and stared blankly at Dean.
On the counter was a plate with crumbs on it as well as a glass with leftover milk coating the insides. It had been recent, seeing how the milk hadn't drained to the bottom yet.
He would easily be pulled away in one direction and end up in the compost, which was exactly what happened last time. The event caused the entire village to laugh at him and it was only until the village blacksmith, Robert Singer, yelled at them that they stopped.
walked to him along with the two Sams following after her. Speaking of fathers and mothers, Dean thought of his father reacting to Mary's revival, although she didn't quite explain it clearly. Something about a favor with someone's sister.
But he couldn't. Not when his brother's life was on the line.
Before Castiel could do anything else, however, the sound of roaring engines was heard. A vehicle approached him at high speed with several armed passengers inside.
Dread collected in the bottom of Castiel's chest. He backed away slowly, his body shaking. "That's not a plane..."
"Mom?
Damn Crowley, but that doesn't mean that Castiel was grateful for him.
Suddenly, Castiel was knocked back and there was a blinding pain blooming from his cheek, bringing tears to his eyes. Slowly, Castiel's hand rose and brushed against his cheek, whimpering at the burning sensation he felt. Did the grandmaster really just slap him?
Strange.
At last, he would be able to save his brother.
Castiel looked outside the window and true to his suspicions, his older sibling was there, sitting on the bench next to the chicken coop.
"Shhh! It's me, Castiel." He pointed and motioned to himself. Samuel stopped making noises at once but it didn't help his stiff posture. Castiel bit his lip, remembering what he had to do.
His horse kicked up a mini dust cloud like it was imagining Castiel underneath its hooves. "I think it would be in your best interest to shut your mouth."
But as beautiful as they were, that still didn't make Castiel hated them any less. They made him seem like an angel, although he truly wasn't one. At least not halfway.
The man with the blue eyes and the other Dean was stuck in his head. They sure as hell didn't look familiar, maybe the other Dean but still. Maybe this was the effect of time travel but still. Very. Trippy.
Then Castiel sped forward and attempted to strike Ramiel, but the demon teleported behind him and sliced at his back with the spear.
Walls and ceiling were heavily decorated with beautiful artwork and paintings that were practically worth dying for. And in the middle of the roof hung a large crystal chandelier, hanging by a chain.
Samuel climbed on to his limbs and made a series of loud noises, rearing his head back and neighing loudly, loud enough that someone was bound to notice if it went too long.
With one particularly heavy swing, Castiel heard a small rip in the fabric of the rice sack as he hit it as hard as he could.
When Castiel looked up, he spotted a round man in a pair of black and ruby red robes on the roof of a nearby store. He was laughing boisterously to himself as he prepared another rotten fruit to throw from a crate.
At that point, Castiel looked around and realized that the man wasn't the only human in the area. He was surrounded by unconscious bodies, most of them harsh burns on their bodies.
The human fell to the ground, dead in a matter of second from the extensive blood loss.
Two children of the Almighty.
Sam shook his head. "No, it's alright." He quickly responded. Mary nodded and continued. "Turns out, Dean is still in this world and nothing has happened yet so far." Mary seemed relieved. "It's been a while since we had an event like this happen, it's almost damn nostalgic." She said ominously. That did not help Dean's already festering anxiety.
"Yes, your Majesty?"
"Yes, he is but not in the way... you'd expect." Older Sam responded. Dean staggered for a bit then looked up at his (younger? Older?) other brother. "What?" He questioned. He hadn't realized that he had said the question out loud until Sam had answered. The hell did that mean? What did any of this mean? Why were they even transported back in time? If this turned out to be some psychotic drugged dream that the Yellow-Eyed Demon set them up to then Dean won't hesitate to shoot him the next time they see him.
It crushed its hand around Castiel's throat and dragging him up against the boulder, grating his wings against the rock brutally.
"We didn't have-" He tried to protest but John shot it down faster than a silver bullet at a werewolf.
Tears blurred Castiel's vision as he buried his face in Samuel's long mane. He allowed the horse to lead them back home, being too exhausted to handle the mess of the day that today was.
"You need to go to the hospital! You were bleeding severely earlier, remember? Didn't the Yellow-Eyed Demon tear your guts open?" The younger man's eyes cast down to his brother's abdomen but was confused when he was met with plain smooth skin. He had remembered how weak and frail Dean was previously, how he and his father had to half carry-half drag Dean into the Impala
What?
He heard a slight tearing sound but didn't have any time to react before swinging his sword outward, slicing not only the sheath but the grandmasters beard and nearly the tip of his nose.
Castiel froze. It had been said that whoever dared to laid eyes on Lucifer was fated to a slow and painful death. Those stories were no mere rumors either, however. Castiel had known those who had met with the adversary and never came out alive from that encounter.
It wasn't his fault that he was born with those large annoying wings and he didn't want to get discluded from the rest of the village because of them.
He licked at his lips and bared his vicious sharp teeth. It had been a long time since he tasted the blood of angels and he has grown quite a craving.
He seems to have landed in a forest, a rather thick one surrounded by thin and tall trees that seemed to touch the clouds (Of course not really but it always amazed Castiel how much the Earth grew). But it seemed that his arrival didn't go unnoticed.
"Dean?"
"Castiel." He nearly missed the sound of his sister, Anael calling out to him. "Brother, you must go."
The large door slammed shut behind John Winchester as he marched into the Palace, his boots staining the golden carpet with a dark muddy color that had a foul odor. If Naomi knew what was on his boot, she didn't comment on it.
"No..." Jimmy whispered, tears filling his eyes. Bobby let go of the older brother's arm and scowled. "What the hell did you do?" He said, crossing his arms. "Haven't seen your brother this upset to just run off."
Wait, what was that sound?
Castiel couldn't breathe. He crashed against the wall of his house, breathing in and out feverishly. His vision began to blur right in front of him as more and more tears cascaded down his face.
He turned to the old shack at the back of the barn and flung it open, searching for the old saddle that Jimmy had used for the previous war. Normally, Castiel would ride Samuel bare but it would seem more official to the soldiers at the camp.
After a minute of searching, Castiel finally found it and mounted it on top of Samuel, who grunted at the abrupt weight and tried to shrug it off. "Sorry, boy," Castiel whispered as he wrapped the cord around his stomach.
Several gasps surrounded them. Castiel spotted a few people even turning towards him and giving him a twisted look, complete with a crooked sneer.
In hindsight, Dean shouldn't have choked and shouted "Fucking what?"
"Hey!" He heard his other self shout as gunshots rang out.
"You," The grandmaster thundered, making his way down the steps and towards Castiel. "You shall
His heart plummeted to the bottom of his stomach as he watched the events about to unfold.
Then, he began reading from the tablet, spilling one name after another. One of the soldiers standing by Metatron's side pulled out a scroll from his satchel and held it out.
Did he not smooth it enough?
How ironic was it, that he flew here to escape being trapped by demons, and now the same thing is happening here on Earth, although he preferred humans to demons any day.
Dean tried Bobby's number. Nothing. For a second, he wondered if his phone could even connect to modern devices out there. There was a dark space in the back of his mind wondering if the old man was even alive. At least he would've died swinging, or at peace. Dean hoped for the latter.
The air was foul, filled with the smell of incinerated and rotting flesh. Bright lights flashed from the windows, all signs of execution but if the cause was by grace or photokinesis was unknown.
He had heard of practices where angels would possess an inanimate object, but those were rare and severely outdated cases.
Castiel slipped out of his bed, his left side still sore but slowly getting better.
Mary nodded, agreeing with Jack's idea while Claire and Sam looked slightly dubious. "What if we accidentally stumble into something we're not supposed to see?" Sam questioned. "Like an event or important person." At this, Claire winced for purposes unknown. Mary frowned then looked down. "I'm not sure but we'll have to make do as we go."
Castiel sped down the steps, his blade in hand. His head snapped upwards, however, when he heard Jimmy call his name. Loudly.
Mumbling? He spoke those words loud and clear. Personally, he thought he was doing fine. More than fine honestly.
“So where am I then, if I’m not dead?” Dean took the moment to ask.
That wasn't a very secure hope, specifically when Dean knew that improvisation never helped. Especially when they were dealing with a time-bending issue.
The threats against him increased tenfold when the next human-angel war came and went.
"So what? Did we just jump forward a decade and a half in time? What are we supposed to do now?" Dean paced around. "I mean like- sure, we can adjust but that's a heavy change." He then gazed out the window. "I am, however, a bit disappointed that there aren't any flying cars though."
He didn't want to run from the action but if that was what the leader of the angels commanded, then it shall be done.
"You shouldn't have to go and fight. You already fought in the last war!" He snapped, letting all of that frustration and fury pour out of him.
Castiel looked up in horror as he spotted an object in the sky that was slowly getting bigger and bigger.
He didn't know how long he stayed there but it was long enough that the lights inside of the house shut off and that he was bound to catch a cold in the freezing rain
It was seconds after midnight when Lucifer struck.
He wondered briefly what happened to Claire's biological father and he compensated asking her about it until Mary- Sorry, his
when he said 'Dad'. The other older Dean actually, if that differed anything. God, he was
Slowly counting to ten, he rose from the bed, his head now feeling like a bag of sand, but at least his arm didn't feel like it was on fire.
As Castiel raced after him, questions on the tip of his tongue, he could see large red and yellow flags raised from the entrance, presenting Heavan's symbol of equality and divinity.
Shelter.
Sam widened his eyes before shaking his head. "Oh. Uh, it's alright. I doubt he'd listen to you, especially with you... being previously dead and all." He pulled out his phone and dialed his father's number. The phone rang for a while before going to voicemail.
"Is the hat really necessary, Dean?"
The reason behind it stood at the back of the demon's garrison.
"Of course." Castiel nodded.
Dean winces but picked Sam up again, using almost all of his strength to do so. This time, Sam seemed more awake but he was also awakening to the pain and Dean bet that he wanted to go back to that subconscious state. "Come on, walk with me." Dean started walking back to the road.
“Yeah. I, um… I talked about driving lessons. With Garth, he thinks it’s a good idea. Haven’t asked Jody about it yet, she’s been busy.”
“When we were kids, I ate, then he ate. I slept, then he slept. Some nights he didn’t do much of either.” He continues. “We had a lot of nothing, and our dad wasn’t even around when he was around, if you know what I mean. But he… he made sure I had holidays, even if it wasn’t much. He made sure I never got hit. He made sure I never really knew how bad off we were. And when I was twelve years old, he vanished. Our dad dropped me at our uncle Bobby’s after that… gave me some stability, while we waited… waited to see if he’d ever really bring him home. I got into college on a scholarship, full ride. Probably for the best, since I wasn’t cut out to work at Bobby’s… kind of clumsy when it came to mechanical stuff. We didn’t have any pictures recent enough to put on a milk carton, but we did what we could. Made calls and flyers and… I saw that article, about what you do here, for kids like him, like he was… and I knew what I did all this for.”
“Yeah. Guess so.”
“I’m not sure if you guys are disgusting or adorable.”
There’s an ache at the way these things say ‘you belong to me’, the domesticity, and there’s an ache at the thought that it’s not over yet, that they aren’t safe, and he can’t lose this now, not now. Not when he has Cas standing at the foot of his bed wearing his sweatpants. Not now that they know. It’s not safe yet to give into all those feelings, but they know the feelings are there. They know that once it’s safe, they have each other. He doesn’t want to jinx that somehow.
“I apologize.”
“I just want you to be happy, man. There’s a lot… there’s a lot you gave up for me. I’m betting there’s more than I’ll ever know. Maybe neither of us was ever really going to get that life, retirement and picket fences and apple pie, maybe we wouldn’t know what to do with it if we got it, but… someone who loves you, you deserve that.”
“He doesn’t like that turn. He never likes that turn. You know you don’t have to bring your cat out to the farmers’ market.”
“Yeah. Well-- see, on Jody’s sound system, she’s still got this tape deck where you can record from an LP to a cassette. And the truck and the pimpmobile both play cassettes. And… the first thing I did, the first paycheck you gave me, Jody took me to a record store, and I found a copy of Mothership. Went back for Physical Graffiti, then Houses of the Holy… after that, the guy there pulled copies of some of the eponymous albums, and In Through the Out Door, said if he got his hands on anything I was missing, he’d hold ‘em for me.” Dean looks down at his feet. “Anyway, just… thought since you didn’t know many bands, I’d share some of their best stuff with you. You can tell me what you think next week.”
“You know, even if you’re doing all your work from home now… you don’t stink too bad, you could come around. Not like you don’t have scent-blocking soap. No pressure! But the center’s staff asks about you.”
He and Dean finally get to really talk about things they said-- or started to say.
“Look at this, I’m not fishbelly white anymore, too. Spent so long living in a box, not even a window to look out of, I forgot I was a freckly little kid before… So, you know. I don’t want to quit what we got. The arrangement we got. It’s just… right now at Jody’s it’s me and the girls, you know? And they’re finishing high school. Well, guess we all are, but they’re actually going to school. And Alex already knows she wants to do medical school after, she’s applying for all these scholarships. Krissy’s getting it together. And I’m the old man with no ideas, nothing.”
own thing. Castiel is an angel, a being without free will… one incapable of defying God. But…
There’s really not much else to worry about after lunch-- they wind up watching some game show, waiting for Jody to show up. It’s something Cas hasn’t seen before, some kind of guessing game more than one of knowledge or skill, and it’s clearly an old re-run, maybe a couple years older than he is himself. He does find he enjoys it, though, laughing as Dean relaxes slowly into shouting his own answers at the screen.
“I’d love to check it out, meet some people. I have Monday off, yeah-- Dean was going to help me look at apartments, but if you get back to me about the place you know, then… maybe we’ll skip some of the less promising ones, and come by the market instead. He can show me around.”
“I think I don’t have room for more apple trees.”
It’s not the prettiest breakfast, but it smells good enough.
better living in the country.”
“Finding what you want to do with your life isn’t always easy. Not everyone has a great purpose drop into their laps. But you’re in a place where you can start thinking about it, that’s… that’s something.”
He answers. He can’t not.
“Wasn’t Rowena going to buy you something?”
“Don’t wanna think better of this. If I punk out, that’s not me thinking better, okay? This, whatever this is… we do have a pack here. You know, and I’m so grateful, for you taking Sammy in. Not just the job ‘cause he earned that himself, but I mean… not letting him be all on his own in a new city. Don’t think young alphas get brought into packs much when they’re new in town-- least, when we were kids, our old man never did. But Sam can’t live that way, all on his own. And you guys… look, I know you all went the extra mile for him ‘cause of me. And that makes us pack. And that’s not hormones talking, okay? That’s all stuff I wanted to tell you before my heat, only it came on a little faster than I thought it would.”
angel, but you’re usually
“Right! Of course, no. We’re doing fine, you don’t need to worry. Uh, Rowena is thinking about pie, for the next time you come over. The first apples are almost ready. And I thought I’d… I thought I’d ask her to teach me what to do. She doesn’t really need another pair of hands yet, but she and Gabriel are both going to be spending a lot more time putting their feet up over the next few months, and… Usually they handle the baking, over-- I know I told you we don’t do Thanksgiving, but at Christmas they bake a few pies, and sometimes they do one or two for the market, so…”
“You could join us more often, dearie, if you’d like.”
“You were six. I got better at it by the time you were twelve. Hey, c’mon, out, or I’m going to kiss him in front of you.”
“Reviews?”
“And you send food over to Jody’s when she’s got a full house. Last winter when Bess was gettin’ kind of anemic, going into her second trimester, you brought us a bunch of spinach, too. You know, it doesn’t stop at just pack, you provide for your whole community. And people appreciate that-- even when you don’t come in much in person, everyone knows you take care of folks.
There’s a knock on the door before he has the pills in his hand, and he sighs. If this is going to be any kind of a conversation, he’s not ready for it, but if this is for Cas…
Garth nods, encouraging. There’s not a lot he can do with that until Cas gets more specific, but it’s so difficult to talk about.
“Wait, you’re gonna carry me up the stairs?”
“Thought it was another trick. I understand.”
, want trembling through him just as sure as it does through Dean, and so Dean guides Cas’ hands to his belt, giving him the okay to help him undress further. Cas opens his own pants, kicking them down a little, giving himself room to get hard, giving Dean the chance to ogle his thighs, but keeping it clear that this isn’t about him. Or, it’s not about his dick. It’s about him, about his hands, and his lips, and the adoration in his blue eyes.
“You’re not scared of Hatchet Man.” He grins. “You just want me to put my arm around you.”
Didn’t even ask where to find him, once he was inside. Sam’s not sure how he does it, but he jogs after him, finds him kneeling at Dean’s side, hand to his forehead.
“I know what mom and dad did fucked you over. But that doesn't mean you can't be loved.” His voice is soft, and it’s that kind of insight, that kind of care, that makes Cas sure he really will be a wonderful father. The one he thinks none of them ever had. Not the two of them, not Rowena, not Dean.
“No, you’re not. But the sensory input will help ground you. Dean… if anyone should apologize, it’s me-- I didn’t… I didn’t take the potential for small accidents into account as I should have, I thought that a relative lack of alphas would be enough, to limit any distress, I should have thought about the effect it would have on you if another omega was hurt or frightened in even a trivial way.”
“Yeah. Guess I do.”
Dean moves into his lap, wraps his arms around Cas’ shoulders. He winds his own around Dean’s waist in return, revels in the weight of him, the nearness, the solidity of his flesh. There is such a comfort in holding him. There has always been…
It is not
. High-pitched, for how deep his voice is, punched out and needy.
And Dean seems most thrilled of all, when Cas tells him that he thinks ‘Ramble On’ is his favorite song on the tape that’s been his constant companion for every drive since it was given to him.
“I thought I was the handsome gentleman.” Gabriel gets the last of the crates loaded up and the back of the truck closed, kissing her cheek in passing on his way to climb into the cab.
“And we’ll be able to help with the work of tending it all, too, of course.” She leans up to kiss his cheek. “I’m looking to get a few chickens, at least.”
“I will.” He smiles, still holding the tape in both hands He only lets go to wave goodbye, as Dean climbs into Jody’s car.
“Cas, hey!” Dean’s face splits into a grin, when Cas answers the door on Saturday sans cane. “How are you doing? You good?”
“It’s open!” He calls, and holds the water glass steady at Cas’ lips but lets him guide the tilting.
to do it, but he wants Cas to be able to
forget
“So, how did things go with Dean?” Gabriel asks, having moved around to the front of the booth to make sure the
“It’s not that big a deal.”
He laughs. “Yeah. You’re a smart guy, Cas, I think you can pick it up.”
“Sure. I’ve got nothing on my calendar to interfere with a couple more movie nights.” Jody says. “Alex cooks Saturday nights, Dean and I won’t be in a rush to get back as long as it’s just one movie an afternoon.”
“Have I told you lately how much I love you?” He asks, pulling Cas in for a proper kiss. “Yes, okay, pants and then bacon.”
sexy later. Like, way later. After saving the world later. Maybe never.
“Oh-- before I forget, before you head out, if you come down to our end of the market, I’ve got a package for you.”
“Why?” Cas frowns up at him, his hand stilling, the slick lotioned sound of hand on cock coming to a halt. “Is it more pleasurable when done by another person?”
“I don’t know.”
“Especially if it’s you, dork.” He reaches up to give Cas a light smack upside the head, before trying and failing to pull him down a little closer to his own level. He still manages to muss Cas’ hair even without dragging him fully into a headlock, but it doesn’t make much of a difference. “You’re gonna help raise these kids, then you’re gonna want your own, then you’re gonna find someone…”
“I would like that. We can pick the blankets together… and then you can pick the movie.”
“All right. It’s… you’re not going to go reporting to the family?”
“How are you feeling?” Cas’ hands are warm, as they loosen the tightness in Dean’s shoulders.
If he could just have him
“Not much to tell. I, uh… I put these on. For me. I wasn’t going to tell you about ‘em yet. It’s just… it’s something I do for me.”
“Not much.” Cas admits. “Gabriel left the TV and his old stereo system behind, since Rowena already had everything her place would hold set up, but I barely… I don’t know what I’d
“Nah, just the normal lotion’s fine.” He turns to kiss Cas’ palm, his wrist.
“It’s… all right.” Cas nods. “Dean’s… right, you shouldn’t… have to see me like this.”
Dean’s breath hitches, and Cas leans forward to be able to rub his back. For a long while they simply stay that way, until Dean finally pulls himself up onto the couch again, and tucks himself into Cas’ side.
“So where’s this leave us? We need that book open and we’re out of options.”
“Better. Believe me, so much better.” Dean promises, pushing himself up on one elbow so he can reach for Cas, to drag him in for a kiss. “Thanks, for treating me so good. Knew you would… knew you’d take care of me.”
“You’ve barely said two words about Cas… Last time we lost him, you were…”
“Don’t you knock? What if we were… you know, intimate?”
They ferry plates of food and mugs of coffee to the table, so that Cas can just sit with Jack for a while. They’ve had some time, of course-- while Dean had tried to focus and plan with Sam the day before, Jack had sat over Cas, presumably they’d spoken some. Dean doesn’t want to intrude on father-son time, as much as there’s an anxiety that buzzes under his skin every moment he’s not holding onto Cas himself, but once he’s got his own breakfast and coffee and there’s nothing else to do except sit down with everyone else, he pulls his chair close at Cas’ other side. Relaxes marginally when Cas shoots him a little smile.
He picks one of the apples, pink-streaked and sweet-tart and firm enough for baking, if they’re ready. Breathes in the scent of the skin before taking a bite.
. Sure, there are some cool flash examples framed behind the register, but there’s also a couple of real paintings. Not like… shitty classy paintings, like a trippy melting astronaut in one and a badass unicorn in another, and a naked chick rising out of the water, but it’s in a swamp… okay, he doesn’t get that one, beyond ‘naked chick’, but it’s good, like… it’s Frazetta-y.
“I guess I can let Jody know not to worry.” Dean agrees, glancing over to Cas. “You, uh, wanna show a guy where he could do a load of laundry?”
They pause, leaning in the doorframe together and staring each other down, arms folded, and it strikes him that this is their first fight as a couple, really, and he has no idea what to do with that, but so what else is new?
“I can’t just knock down the back fence. I’m not sure if you know this about fences, but they often delineate the border between properties. I don’t own the land on the other side of my fence.”
“And you.” Cas’ lips brush the back of his neck again. “
“So… what? We give up?”
“Thirteen, when they sent me to Naomi. Wait-and-see didn’t buy me more than a year, but…”
? The how doesn’t matter to him, not in this moment. His knees hit the floor, he crawls the last couple of steps, he scrambles to get his hands on Cas again, to feel for any signs of life. Pulse, breathing… he’s warm. He’s
. He’s had his aspirin and a glass of water and some soup and his lip is better and okay, shit’s weird, but he’s
“Good now that pie’s happening.”
Dean looks up from the plans Sam has laid out on the table to see Cas standing there, and it’s only when their eyes meet that he realizes he’d known before he looked, hadn’t heard him, just felt him.
Cas and Gabriel clean up the remains of the picnic together, and though he’d meant to have something to do to keep him from butting in on a more private reunion, they’re not so far that their voices don’t carry, he finds himself listening in without meaning to.
“Don’t know if we can call it that anymore. Get it on like it’s our last night on earth, maybe.”
“Okay.” Sam squeezes him, and even when they separate, they stay in contact, patting at each other’s shoulders, touching each other’s faces and breaking out into little bouts of shaky, disbelieving laughter.
Jack brings a first aid kit and some towels to Dean’s room, and starts running hot water, and Sam gets Cas’ boots off while Dean removes his shirt as gently as humanly possible. He perches beside him on the bed and tries not to break down.
“Well, if it looked like Scooby Doo. Scooby Doo would never hurt me. Other dogs, I don’t know.”
“Partnering. That’s all the other things that you do in a relationship with an omega-- whether it’s an intimate, romantic kind of partner, or a friend or relative. The ways that an alpha and omega complement each other and strengthen each other. It’s… more nebulous, because it depends on different individual relationships, but it’s natural. And using things to block certain hormones or pheromones from playing a role in our interactions doesn’t change that, it’s a part of you even without that-- partnering with an omega that you care about isn’t being ruled by chemistry, or losing any of your self-control, it’s just about learning what two people need to give each other. When you’re with your brother, you have ways of supporting each other. When you’ve worked with Donna, or Charlie, or Dean, they aren’t the same as Gabriel, but they’re also not just anyone, right? Donna might not need to be protected, but when you two were on the strike team together, you knew how to work as a team.”
He shivers and holds on tight, and hopes Cas is feeling his yes coming through even if he can’t say it.
“This really… this isn’t how I saw it going.” He offers. “I never would have… I mean, it was a risk for all of us, but I-- I’m sorry. I know you just got him back. I know it… it took you two long enough, to get this far. Look, Dean, for what it’s worth…”
“Yeah, loud and clear.”
“That’s why you don’t go on the, um, the raids? Jody said you used to, and now you’re like… the tactician?”
They head out back and get to work-- more breaks to drink something, now that summer’s in full swing. The galas will be ready to harvest soon, and then it won’t be too long until the cameos and then the gold rush apples… It will take a few years for the new trees to mature and start producing good fruit, but he can already envision an apple season that begins mid-August and goes through to the end of October, different varieties… The bees are buzzing in the cameo tree and around the roses, birds are visiting the feeders and the birdbath, singing out their claims on the territory while they work, and Rowena joins them to gather some herbs and help with the roses, Gabriel brings lunch out to all three of them on the patio, where the four enjoy a slight breeze, and the shade of the vine-covered arbor over the table, the climbing roses also in full flower.
“I think… I require food.”
“How long a list?”
“I’ll go… wash this.” Jack stands, picking up the empty bowl and flashing Dean a hopeful smile. It’s kind of an obvious excuse to give them a little alone time, but Dean’s not complaining.
Even walking in his dreams now and then, he had left him some privacy. The sanctity of his private thoughts and feelings. There were things he couldn’t help but pick up on, yes, even moments which led him to hope against hope that there might be something there, but he never did pry, not about those thoughts. Those feelings.
it, so he leans over him, and he starts at the center of his forehead, and he just… kisses him. Just soft, chaste little things, but each one carries the focus of his intent, carries the utmost desire for Cas to be a little less hurt, a little more comfortable.
, we never could have lived like this in that apartment.” Rowena sighs, bouncing Moira Jean in her arms. “
. Twenty minutes before I can use my mouth on you?”
“Finally feel passionate about something. Guess it’s… been a while. Or…” Or his entire life, but hey. The woman’s a tattoo artist, not a therapist.
“So you grew up without movies, too? Oh man…” Dean shakes his head. “But you’ve seen Star Wars since then, right?”
“How’s the apartment hunt going?” Gabriel asks. “You getting settled in town?”
things-- not just to have their basic needs met, but to be able to think of themselves as people free to pursue the career and family situations that will fulfill them. When they were first getting started, Cas would attend-- mostly to fill out the room, or for Gabriel to point to and say ‘there’s my alpha brother, he treats me like a real human being, I cut everyone who couldn’t do that out of my life and so can you’. It’s been a while since he’s really been necessary.
“I can’t do this without Cas.”
No. Of course he wouldn’t. And Sam, Sam barely summons up a casual interest because he can’t see Dean’s phone screen, doesn’t know that this is a fucking knife between the ribs, isn’t something sharp and not nearly deadly enough lodged in his heart.
It’s not as if he’s really against doing so-- he’s not relying on his cane, which makes carrying the box easier. He talks to Jody as often as he talks to just about anyone and he’s been to her home before, though rarely past the front door, conscious of the potential fragility of any of her charges.
He is fond of Dean, that’s become clear enough. A little protective, when he spots those sign of old, scarred-over hurt, when he sees Dean self-conscious over them. More than a little grateful, for the way Dean jumps in to help without making him feel like he’s an invalid-- even on his worst days, Dean just seems happy to have work to do with his hands, out in the sun, and his attitude is always that he takes on the tasks he’s paid for, there’s no judgment over the things Cas can’t do on his own. Well, except for the now-comfortable teasing over his lack of culinary prowess. But the teasing helps, he thinks. If Dean praised him for his progress without teasing him for never having learned before, it might feel condescending, even if it wasn’t meant that way. They seem to have a good sense for each other, that way-- a sense for when to be gentle, and a sense for when not to be. They come from radically different backgrounds, but there’s some commonality there in the way they both struggled to live up to expectations. How they both struggled to keep themselves going when those expectations went unreached.
“For your operation-- heard you were keeping some folks fed, so Benny and I put together a little care package. We all figured you probably pass on some vegetables now and then but you might need some meat.”
He might never be able to ask for what he wants, with Dean, but… this is good. Dean’s health seems to blossom right along with the roses, and Cas is learning to cook. Gabriel and Rowena are expecting, and that means Cas is taking over some of Gabriel’s old duties around the center-- it’s early on enough that Gabriel doesn’t need leave, outside of pre-natal appointments, but Cas needs to rebuild his comfort with working in the office again, reconnecting with people who are used to his face on a screen… It feels like even if Dean isn’t a real member of their pack, life is improving for all four of them together, the more time they spend together.
fifteen minutes, if you wanna keep talking about how you can’t wait to blow me, but don’t get used to it. I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but in a couple years it’s probably getting slower.”
“I said nothing about expendability, I merely gave you unmerited credit for being less likely to cry.”
“Objection noted. Fortunately for the rest of us, your approval isn’t what matters, Castiel’s is.”
“Alphas tend to get by. One way or another.”
He considers asking Cas to just move in, and isn’t sure if it’s too early or way too long in coming.
He mentally plots out the longest unbroken segment he can run-- a couple of things he rules out right away, but a lot of the course will allow him to rely on upper body strength…
“I don’t know how to really get along with people, though.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Are you fucking kidding me right now?” Dean hisses, though he’s just as gentle in cleaning Cas up. “He smacked you down like it was nothing and I couldn’t even get to you, let alone… I don’t know! Help, in any way! We started out without a weapon!”
mean he doesn’t want you.” Cas’ hand moves of its own accord, stroking over Dean’s hair, gentling him. It offsets some of the ferocity behind his words. “The way he talked about you… you shaped his life. He said you were the one to raise him. He became an omega rights lawyer because of
“Good. I know… I know you’ll take good care of me, Cas. You’re the best alpha there is, you got that? You’re-- you’re perfect for me. And you’re gonna touch me real good, I know it. Gonna… gonna use those big, strong hands of yours. Your hands are always so warm… they always make me feel good.”
“Yes, well.”
“So how’s everything?” He asks, as he pulls weeds and Castiel inspects his broad beans, and that’s as probing as Gabriel gets, at least on the topic of Castiel’s health.
“No, I mean…” He closes his eyes, taking the hand from his cheek and holding it between his own. “Cas, I need you to be better. I need you to be okay. I
“Threepio’s okay, Han’s just objectively the coolest.”
“Thanks for coming. It, um… I’m glad Jody had to drop me off and run, or I probably wouldn’t have asked you.” Dean says, walking with Cas out to his parking spot. “Whoa, your brother left you with a pimpmobile!”
“Yeah. No idea how.” He sighs, chin dropping down to Dean’s shoulder. “But otherwise we just kind of… wait around until we run out of edible food and potable water.”
Spanking, with Cas, is never a punishment and always a reward. If Dean asks him to do it, he will, and he’ll tell him how good he looks with his skin all pink. He holds back, obviously, but it’s
Cas might not get super horny during their makeout sessions, but he gets possessive, and he’s working on being less shy about it-- he’d been upset at first, afraid he might cross some line, but Dean’s never worried about that. Sometimes he pauses the kissing to bury his nose right up against a scent gland so he can huff Dean in and he makes this sound that’s halfway between a growl and a purr, and sometimes he latches on like a limpet and just holds Dean to the bed, but…
“Yeah.” Dean’s gut clenches and flutters at the sudden wave of heat from those words. “You… you could touch me in some new places, if you want to. You want that, Cas? You want me to show you?”
Dean doesn’t know exactly what his touch means to Cas, beyond the obvious, but he knows what Cas does for him, the unshakeable safety he finds in his arms and the peace that comes with feeling a steady heartbeat under his cheek or his ear, when he’s sprawled half on top of him. Cas is a side-sleeper, mostly, and he uses a careful arrangement of bedding to keep his hips and spine in alignment, but sometimes he likes to rearrange the nest that is their bed so that he can lie on his back and feel Dean’s weight press him down into the mattress. And they’ve figured out how to make Dean a part of that careful arrangement, too-- sometimes he’ll be flopped over on his stomach on his side of the bed and he’ll feel Cas throw a leg over his own, and that, too, feels safe.
“I’ll look that up later, then.” Castiel nods.
“He’s on vacation. He’s attending a wedding in Seattle.” Garth blinks, and Cas groans. “I could call someone.”
“Sure. The guy who kisses like a nervous fifteen year old is perfect.”
“I just-- You could have
“I am not a growing boy, Dean.”
“Hell yes.” Dean grins at him, before shoving a forkful of pie into his mouth. “Hey, I’ll do it if you do it.”
“Shut up. Why do we even have this stuff?”
“Yeah, okay, good idea. Sam, there better be coffee. I’m not putting pants on at whatever the fuck o’clock for no coffee.”
"Come with me." The grandmaster turned and retreated back into his domain. "Shut the door on your way in."
He walked over to the armor rack and gazed down at the armor. It would be a little large for him but that wouldn't be much of a problem. His wings... however.
His brother and Singer were the only ones in the whole village beside the animals who didn't mock him, except maybe the short person with a thick accent who hung around Singer but he still called Castiel a 'bloody halo' and teased the fledgling whenever he's around.
Castiel lowered his wings in submission and he heard Bobby and his brother beside him draw out their swords slowly as the grandmaster stepped up to his face. "You are a disgrace to the name of Heavan. Shall you ever attempt to a step forward in honor, your spirit shall only drag you three steps back!" He shouted.
He was even more stunned when Jimmy turned to him with a cold expression then walked past him, the scroll clenched tightly in his hand.
Suddenly, the door bursted open.
His father didn't think the same, however, and never saw him as his own blood (but that never mattered since family doesn't end in blood, a quote given to him by his surrogate uncle, Robert Singer). He didn't want to believe that his son had some sort of heritage to the bloody halos, especially after the recent angel-human wars that had occurred earlier that decade.
The Prince of Hell chuckled darkly. "I see that you recognize me, little angel." He drawled. His grip tightened, causing black dots to swarm at the edge of Castiel's vision.
Roy's chest heaved up and down as he struggled to catch his breath, his head feeling light as he raced for oxygen. There was a brief relief in which soon turned dark as the sound of wings fluttering came behind him. Roy spun around so quickly, his neck ached and there was a slight pulsing in his forehead.
He remembered when he was still a young child, he saw Jimmy attend the ceremony and ever since then, he's been crowned as a hero.
Bobby slammed his fist into the already-ruined door of the Novak estate. It was still the dead of night, which explained Jimmy piss-poured expression when he emerged from behind the door. His expression didn't lighten up when he saw Bobby, in fact, it worsened.
"I'm here!" Castiel exclaimed loudly, sliding off Samuel's back and raising his arms out to the air. Bobby grumbled as he walked over to Castiel, grabbing his wrist tightly and pulled it down. "Put your damn hand down, boy, and come with me!" He snapped as he stepped into the forge with Castiel behind him and slammed the door after them.
Aside from-
He watched as the object start to collect speed. A glowing sphere formed in front of it, pulsing and growing in size. Like it was charging.
Jimmy was standing in the middle of the rice mess he made earlier, a furious look in his eyes. "Did you do this?" He asked, even though it was obvious that he and Castiel were the only people in the house. When Castiel nodded, Jimmy just shook his head with an irate look.
Castiel felt sick. He never wanted to get up from his bed ever again. Just let him wallow alone in misery.
It hurt like Hell and he knew what Dean and Dad would say.
And just when Castiel thought it was over, a layer of dust sprinkled on the grandmaster's hair. Castiel looked up, right in time to see the chandler drop from the ceiling and land dead-on top of the grandmaster, sending clouds of dust into the air.
Ramiel unclenched his hand and unreleased the angel, allowing him to plummet down hundreds of feet to the ground.
"Empress, believe me when I say that my forces can stop Lucifer and his army," The elder general argued. "You've seen how much damage they delivered in the previous war-"
Bobby was looking worse than the last time Castiel had seen him, which was only two days ago, but it was understandable since today marked a very special day in Castiel's life, as well as Pontiac's, and the boy in question was already late to the preparation.
"Sit." The grandmaster commanded as he walked to one of the mats, kneeling down on the furthest one from the entrance. Castiel glanced down awkwardly at the other rug before slowly sliding on top of it and crossing his leg, his armor clinking together loudly and uncomfortably.
"For Heaven's sake-" Bobby opened up a series of drawers before grabbing a spare scabbard. "Be glad that I have spares. Come on, I'll get you fixed up." He slid the blade into the scabbard but not after sharpening the dull surface until it could be used as a mirror.
Castiel took a swig of water before going at the rice bag again, gripping the handle of the stick tightly and swinging with all of his might, striking the poor fabric sack. He dodged as it swung back at him, the rope that held it close to snapping.
In all the ways he expected the ceremony to go, this was not one of them.
Sam woke up to the sunlight shining directly into his eyes and if that wasn't bad enough, the sight of his father's pissed off expressions definitely woke him up.
Bloody-
The fact that they weren't just spitting insults at him and made an actual attempt to hide their distaste was tiresome as well. They've made it clear that he wasn't wanted so why try and sugar coat it for him? He wasn't a damn child.
A few moments later, a tall yet feeble man with a long and luscious beard, the grandmaster, bursted through the front doors. He had a writing board in one hand and a stern expression on his face.
It was weird as hell and Dean would be lying if he said that it didn't creep him out and he was absolutely justified by that feeling. And based on how his mother didn't react other than a response to Jack's earlier 'hello', it was safe to say that it was a regular occurrence. Not to select favorites so early in life but Jack wasn't really quite the poster child.
Older Sam nodded slowly. "Okay, uh. Have fun and try not to kill each other when you're alone." He slid away awkwardly, his younger version following along as well.
His plan was working. His plan was really going through.
Oh boy.
the fact that they were staring at him that got on his nerve.
"A lot has changed and maybe it's best we leave some stories untold. And besides, I doubt you'd like it." Older Sam reached up and scratched the back of his head. "It's been a difficult life but we've made the best of it."
Sam staggered towards the two of them and helped Dean as they carried John back towards the blinding colorful lights of the motel. Dean furrows his eyebrows. "Dude, do we even have money?" He turned to Sam, who gave him a half focused bitchface
"A single grain of rice can tip the scale."
It started with rocks being thrown at their house and awful messages being scratched into the walls of their house and fences. Castiel tried to ignore it and he knew his brother did too but the first night the rock crashed through the window and splintered their doorframe so that the door couldn't shut close, Jimmy lost it.
The older sibling lowered his head to the floor, kneeled, and closed his eyes. "Dear Hosts of Heaven, I pray to thee that you are listening," he whispers. "For the life of my brother lies in your hands. I ask you to please,
"Your highness, the angels have made their way through the northern walls. Lucifer has been sighted." John started, the eagerness in his voice clear. He wanted to take charge, to command his own troops. "We will establish a perimeter around the Palace immedi-"
The tension in the room grew as John stood up.
Anael's answer came quickly, like she already knew that he was going to be hesitant and prepared to be questioned.
The bell on top of the door rung as Dean and Sam entered the store, taking a look around. There were a few bags of road salt on a rack nearby along with some Busty Asian Beauties magazines that Dean was very interested in. Man, they were really getting good with the graphic design, instead of the fake shiny plastic skin that he had gone used to.
Claire snorted slightly over the phone but it was shortened when Mary gave her a reprimanding call of her name. "We were planning on heading to a friend's house to eat anyways." She turned to her sons. "You could join along if you'd like or stay here. But if you come, you can meet more people that could help you out big-time." She smiled.
Dean learned that the hard way with Cassie. Of course, she didn't believe the whole spiel about monsters being real one bit (not yet at least) and called him a mental freak. It stung more than he expected it to and they dropped it from there.
On the floor in the middle of the room were two tightly woven blue mats, both of them facing towards each other.
Anael continued talking, ignoring Castiel's expression. "We will still fight, but right now? We need refuge and a place to stow away."
"On your honeymoon."
There was a very loud snap at the base as the pillar gave weight, crashing to the floor and causing everything in a five-foot radius to fly up in the air. The ground shook like there was a small earthquake pounding through Pontiac.
Somehow, they had both found a girl who kept up with the hunting life and dealt with their bullshit.
Large, heavy wings that gave him pain for the majority of his life. They were vast in length and dark in color, almost as dark as the midnight sky with a gradient of deep dark blue on the bottom.
And he flew.
But if this was a dream then how could they possibly be happy in this? Or was it just an umbrella term and there's something bigger and more sinister hidden underneath this 'marriage'? Dean hoped not. He had been through enough twists and turns already.
He didn't know how long he stayed awake but when he came to, the sun was rising and the house was empty.
They saw him as an adversary and they treated him as such but today would change, Castiel was sure of it.
Waves after waves of grappling hooks flew swiftly up the wall and onto the platform, a symphony of cluttering heard from all over. Every single one of those hooks was wedged in between the raised ridges in the wall. Soft grunts were heard beneath the hooks and despite the darkness of the night, Roy could see that the ropes were being pulled on.
It was only the crack of dawn and Castiel was already sweating, his limbs aching and arms feeling heavy. He felt like he could lay down and sleep for a century. He wiped his arm over his forehead and placed the stick down against the wall. He knew he shouldn't have waited until literally the last day to train for the hardship ceremony, but he had the whole farm look after ever since Jimmy got put out of commission from the last angel-human war.
They were being invaded.
While it would have been logical to argue that no, humans and angels aren't different species, they are different
The ancient angel whose name has been told countless of times.
Dean was still highly dubious of his mother. Sure, she said that she had been alive for nearly five years now and there have been no problems but Dean still holds his suspicions.
He spotted Sam grabbing the rock salt as well of the 'healthier' snacks, ones that didn't have as much sugar or chocolate that Dean's had. "Health freak," Dean muttered under his breath as he watched his brother trying to carry two bags at once and ended up toppling over himself, spilling all the snacks as well.
The wall was built shortly after.
Castiel unveiled his own wings and aimed for the stars that would lead him to Earth, preparing himself for the long journey to come.
No amount of training or praying could fix what Castiel had broken.
He was more than hopeful, of course, when they came back and defeated the truck spirit but he couldn't stay with Cassie, not with Dad and the Yellow-Eyed Demon on the roll. He didn't want to lose her like Sam lost Jess. But he would return, after all, he did promise her that at least.
There was no way that their luck was this good, was it?
Suddenly, Castiel's eyes snapped open and filled with a heavenly light.
When the last of the primary and secondary feathers fell to the ground, Castiel tucked his wings close to his back and began tying them down using a spool of twine. It was slightly uncomfortable to feel the strings constrict around his muscles, but it wasn't bad, to say.
Heaven used to be pristine. It was once the definition of purity but now, the pearly white gates were stained with blood, and literal mountains of corpses formed on every surface imaginable.
"We're going to buy salt and materials then breakfast at ten. I'm going to see if I can call Bobby or any hunters nearby." His father grumbled before walking over to Dean. But before he could even lift his hand to wake his son, Dean gasped loudly and jerked up, his body shaking.
They had to devise a plan fast or else the demons will triumph over the whole galaxy.
In one hand, he held a bag of grains, which he loosely grabbed a handful of and tossed it out to the chickens below.
a disgrace and he will never bring his family honor.
Outside, Bobby stood there, worried for his protege. The sounds that he heard inside the residence didn't give him much hope. Even worse was the chattering and whispering by the people standing beside him.
Castiel got up to his feet and pulled out his angel blade. Ramiel grinned wickedly as he revealing a spear, spinning it briefly before positioning it at his side.
The grandmaster stopped running as well, watching as his precious statues began to fall on top of each other like a perfect sadistic line of dominos.
Ramiel stretched out his other hand to Castiel's throat and began muttering softly.
"What the hell is this?" His father demanded, his stern eyebrows deepening even more and more. "Do you know what I don't see?:"
Older Sam cleared his throat and nodded. "Yeah, it never stopped. Even if I tried to stop and I did, something would always pull me back." Something about his tone told Dean that Sam wasn't talking about just Jess and that made him slightly horrified. How many times did Sam try to get away from him? How many times did Dean screw things up for his younger brother? The guilt was groundbreaking, even if it wasn't Dean who experienced it.
Beside her, Metatron scowled loudly, eying the Winchester with a distasteful passion. Everybody knew about General Winchester and how arrogant and stubborn the old man was but even Metatron couldn't lie about how much of an astute strategist John was. If only the man can think straight with his head instead of his fists. The man wanted war and only war ever since the last one between them and the angels.
The half-angel gawked at his older brother in slight surprise. He hadn't expected him to ask such a peculiar question.
Castiel froze, immediately lying back down and pressing his arm firmly against the mattress, waiting for the agonizing moment to pass.
The sounds were coming from the gates of Pontiac, where the entrance was. Jimmy lifted his head instantly, his eyes widening.
"Calm down, Sammy." Dean held up his hand and stopped him. "Okay- If you're so worried about 'cosmic consequences' and all of that stuff as if that even exists, then just avoid everyone and don't get into trouble."
"Thou shalt have no gods before me." Castiel started, closing his eyes in concentration. "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain-"
Roy had never seen a sight more terrifying in his life.
Dean watched as his dead mother turned to look directly at him, his mouth gaping open in shock.
Speaking of loaded, he still had to grab his ceremonial sword from his room. He can't believe he didn't bring it down with him when he practiced!
"I've seen what Michael has been planning. He has big plans for us and we can only achieve such goals if we listen. Right now, he is telling us to retreat, but we will reemerge in a blaze of glory." Anael reassured him.
"That's the point, baby." Lucifer sneered, twisting his sword deeper into Roy's body before pulling it out in a swift motion.
He looked around, prepared to see nothing but glass and the tattered remains of the Impala, his
Dean's words caught in his throat. No way, no friggin' way. Both of them are married? Of course, Dean was beyond happy, knowing that even with all the trouble in their life, they managed the best out of it. He couldn't believe it.
." He spat out in open disgust.
Dean snapped out of his head then shook his head quickly. "I don't know about Mo- her but you two can nerd out on your own." He grimaced at how the sentence sounded. It had been such a long time that he has called anyone Mom without it being weird or with hurt in his voice. Mary seemed to look right through him because she looked over at him next then shook her head. "I'll stay with Dean. I think we have an overdue conversation."
here's like 3k words of cas getting hurt
Wait.
It was troubling how much people never trusted him that well.
"State the Ten Commandments." The grandmaster adjures, crossing his arms in an unimpressed manner. Castiel nodded. Okay, this was an easy enough task. He began speaking confidently, having memorized it from memory even prior to the ceremony.
He had to find shelter. But pain filled his every movement. He couldn't find the strength to get up, much less fortify a structure.
Castiel tipped his head back, his eyes glowing vividly before fading to a low dim.
What was once just a minor inconvenience soon turned into terror as Roy gripped his weapon tightly and shuddered.
He finished quickly and closed the bag, running back to his home. The young man raced up the steps and spotted the shining silver blade in the corner of his desk. He made a desperate grab for it then sped out. Thank goodness he remembered where it was instead of wasting any more time searching for it.
Probably a witch, he thought sourly. He was confused though. Who in their right mind would trust a monster? Especially after years of experience and hunting. It just doesn't make any sense. He was taught early on that if it's not a human then it deserves to die and if there was one rule that he could depend on in all of his years, it was that what's dead should stay dead. Who said there weren't any setbacks?
"Let's go, Sammy," Castiel whispered into his horses' ear before climbing up the side of the seat. He squeezed his thighs around Samuel's middle, urging him to go forward. Samuel threw his head back and kicked his feet into the air before charging out of the stables and out of the farm.
Not only could he not bend below his waist, Jimmy had constant nightmares and paranoia that made it hard for him to sleep at night. He couldn't operate on the farm anymore but he made up for most of that by working in the sales department.
A large vulture stood confidently on the spiked roof, its wings coated with a dark crimson color that was illuminated by the moon behind it. It unfurled its wings and let out a loud and ear-splitting shriek that seemed to echo in the empty air.
A younger man stepped up this time. He glanced back at his father before taking the scroll from the soldier's hand, holding the roll of paper in his palm firmly.
"Cas."
Castiel didn't get up.
"What is-"
"Do you know how vulnerable you left us? You could've at least placed down a Devil's Trap or have someone on the lookout." John seethed.
"Ramiel." Castiel gasped out, clawing at the offending limb.
Dean swallowed down the panic that was threatening to brew up inside of him and pushed the calendar away. "You sure this isn't a- a typo or anything?" He insists. No way they were
Despite the multiple times that Castiel had denounced himself from Lucifer's army, there was always a patch of people who saw it the other way around.
"Castiel is gone, now let me in you rotten scrap," Bobby grunted, pushing past Jimmy and trudging inside of the house.
Hundreds had fallen in the crossfire between battles. They had barely three-fourths of the same troops they had now.
Jimmy shook his head. "I can't. if I reveal him, he
"Tell me what Michael's plans are," Ramiel demanded, his claws digging deeper into Castiel's body. He tried to lift his feet up and kick at Ramiel's arm like he did before but every limb felt like an anvil was attached to it.
Then, like if the sun had shone down on them, Michael flew to the front and unleashed a wave of energy, disintegrating any demons that dared to get close enough to the archangel. Many of the angels and even a few demons halted their attacks just for a brief moment to admire Michael's glorious shape before returning to their offenses.
The look on Bobby's face, however, only got worse when Castiel arrived, his sword swinging loosely and unguarded from his waist, his hair unkempt, and his entire attire a mess. Rufus swore that Bobby had turned deadly pale and another strand of hair turned white that instant.
"No!"
"Castiel, you've heard of the story about the ugly duckling, correct?" Jimmy asked.
Instead of 2005, the calendar showed 2021.
The grandmaster let out a large roar, lunging at the angel.
Now that Dean was looking closer, the other man
years ahead of time, right? This has to be one massive typo. Or maybe it was April 1st. Motels love to do that, right? But it wasn't April. It was May.
"What's this lesson you're trying to teach me anyway?" Castiel jeers, trying to light up the mood. "That I shouldn't be judged for my wings? Because newsflash, I already am and nothing is going to change that-"
“All right. Auntie Rowena’s got you, sweet boy… oh, yes, aren’t you the handsome gentleman?”
“Of course.”
“I’ll still massage you any day you want, even if you don’t want to look into scar creams, but… just if it would help. But if me touching you can change the way you feel about your body on its own, well… I just want you to feel comfortable.”
“Doing all right?”
“Thank you, dear.” Rowena reaches up, patting his cheek. “I’m sure they’ll appreciate it greatly. Speaking of, that recommendation you made to me last week turned out wonderfully. Made my mate a very happy man.”
Oh, yeah. Being naked around each other is a very good thing.
“I usually want to call you.” Cas smiles, and something suspiciously like honest hope starts to beat within his chest.
“How come… how come you weren’t there when I came to?”
“No. I… I didn’t know exactly what to say, when he told me he believed it was too late. I told him… I told him it wasn’t. He had a photograph, of when you were a little boy. He gave me your name. But he came to me wanting to help strangers. I just… I didn’t know how to tell him. I have his number. Dean… you could-- Dean, if what you want is to fix cars in your uncle’s garage, where it’s home, where you’re safe, where you have family… your brother could take you home. If… if that’s what would be best for you, I--”
confident. Like this.”
“No.” Cas’ voice is gentle, but not the way people get when they’re bullshitting you. Dean can hear the lotion squirt into his hand, the slick sound as he warms it up between his palms. “It’s… I’ve seen better, and I’ve seen worse. Some of these healed badly, but it doesn’t put me off of touching you.”
“I didn’t…”
?” Gabriel clutches Tybalt to his chest, as they come up to a stoplight. “Not
“You did a good job with Sam. You’re still the man I would most like to have at my side for this.”
“Hey, so… do you-- You could stay. You could stay with me.”
“A while now.” Cas doesn’t flinch-- lying isn’t going to accomplish anything, and he hasn’t done anything to be ashamed of-- going to Dean first is protocol, even if he knows for a fact the relative he’s established contact with is entirely trustworthy.
“When’d you finally watch Star Wars?” She asks after him, but only Dean actually follows when Cas crosses the room.
. Look at you, how soft and how lovely… I am privileged, to hold you like this. To be given your tenderness. To see you like this. Your trust in me is a
.” He tells himself, because thinking it in his head’s not enough. “He’s with Jack, having a father-son heart to heart and he’s
Cas grins back at him, his hands making a firm sweep from just above Dean’s waist down his thighs. Back up again, to his hips and then around to his ass. It would be better without the heavy denim in the way, but it still makes Dean sigh and rock into his touch. Still makes his head tip back, throat bared to be kissed. The impulse is irresistible and Cas does not try to resist it. He kisses him, tastes his hot pulse, the familiar musk of his skin, never before experienced so… carnally.
“We’ll look together if you like… if there are others you know you would like, or if you just want to show me where you found these.” Another kiss, the brush of feathers across his bare back when Cas brings his wings in closer around him. “Is there anything else? Anything else you want?”
“Yes.” He squeezes Dean’s shoulder. “I know.”
He drops his bag, taking both of Cas’ hands in his own.
, if he looked at other boys a little too long, if the stash of crumpled pages under his mattress were torn from Michael’s discarded sports magazines.
He opens his eyes.
“Humor me.”
Instead of grabbing an extra blanket, he goes to the closet and gets the softest, heaviest flannel shirt, lays that out over Cas instead.
“Yes… you have enough to be proud of, but it can’t always erase the shame, or the pain, from what was done to you. And… you can only fight for so long before you have to think about survival, sometimes. You’re not alone in that. In struggling with that.”
“I mean it’s great for me. I know I said before I’d probably want another alpha around if I got knocked up, but now? Three of you and one of little old me? This is the life.”
Thursday, Cas arrives early to get the picnic set up, Gabriel in tow with plates, napkins, and plastic forks. At the shaded tables near the field where the obstacle course is laid out, Jody has already left a cooler with drinks, and so Cas finds spots for the barbecue shredded chicken and sandwich buns, the tubs of coleslaw and potato salad, and then his own contribution, the summer strawberry salad he’d thrown together before he and Gabriel hit the deli. And, finally, the peach pie he’d picked up on a whim.
“Well, if you can’t pull yourself together and try, the world’s going to end.”
“The strike team?”
“I like the Swayze version.” Sam nods.
.” And he drags his fingers down from Dean’s shoulder, over his chest, over his belly, down to wrap around his hip. “Not only because of these. You are… so lovely.”
“Heya, bossman.” She waves at him, as he sets the tray down in front of them. “Haven’t seen you around the office lately. Forgot how you looked outside of a screen.”
“Is Cas gonna be okay?”
“Good. I did good.” He nods-- Cas would have gone with him, he knows, would have driven him there. He had worried that he would be a little too in his head if he knew Cas was watching him do the full tryout for the strike team, though, and Sam had driven him out and been his cheering section.
“Oh, um-- yes, great! Thank you. Is this about the position?”
Cas hums and kisses the back of his head. “Let me give you a real massage, then.”
Dean snorts-- ‘again’ might not be the right word, and things getting good has been a long, hard slog, but… when Cas dares a look his way, he’s curled in a little closer against his own brother.
The smile Cas gives him at that is downright
“Well, you look like you’re about to fall over.”
people, even if being around groups of them isn’t easy right now.
Dean groans, burying himself more firmly in his blankets and Cas’ chest. Which is not the position he’d been in the last time he fell asleep, but he’s not complaining, either. The shirt he’d given him is soft, Cas is warm, he smells comfortingly familiar, a little musky and a little weirdly ethereal still. The tang of ozone and the sweetness of petrichor, like there’s a coming storm lurking underneath a human skin.
“And for today, uh-- well, Cas has gotta run me back to Jody’s, but… maybe I’ll be back another week.” Dean adds, faux-casual. Cas hears the request for what it is, Dean’s day has been long enough.
“You’re being summoned.” Cas peels the blankets back from over Dean’s head.
. I won’t pretend it doesn’t bother me to think of how much you suffered, but… your life is so much more than that now, and I can’t let myself get lost in the past when we have the present.”
“Jody helped with designing the hiring process for the strike team.” Cas chuckles softly, fighting the urge to hold onto some piece of laundry, to drink in the scent off of an undershirt that had been soaked through with heat-sweat. “So she would know. Anyway, I’ll show you how to use the dryer when this finishes-- there’s a clothesline outside, but we might get rain, which… defeats the purpose.”
“Thanks, Cas.” It’s Dean’s turn to bend down, to press a kiss into the messy nest that is Cas’ hair at the end of the day. “Maybe… maybe we could try that. You touching me is good. And… maybe it’s what I need. Not erasing ‘em, but… cleaning ‘em up a little. Like… bleeding out all the gross feelings, so when it’s all said and done, maybe I can just-- maybe I’m keeping the part I can be proud of.”
“Me, too.”
recovery, given the length of time he’s been held captive, and the mistreatment he’s suffered. His health has been continuing to improve, in many ways. I want you to be adequately prepared-- he very much wants you to see the best in him, even if he won’t be the way you remember him.”
“That was…”
“Well… hey, welcome to the club, kid, ‘cause I don’t know what I feel like, either. And I know I’m human. You guys want some time to talk over… stuff?”
At least for a trial run… He could still decide, once he knows Dean is here, that the best course of action is for both of them to go home to their uncle, for Dean to finish his recovery with his family, but Cas hopes that he won’t take him back to Sioux Falls right away. He can’t push the thought from his head, but Sam had reached out to them about the job, he wants to believe that his enthusiasm for it will still stand. That seeing some of the team and what they do, and how they’ve helped Dean, his enthusiasm for the job will grow. True, Dean may want to go back and work in his uncle’s garage… but it doesn’t have to happen immediately just because it’s suddenly become more of an option.
“Yeah, well. Cas… makes me believe.”
“I better get back out there and make sure everything’s taken care of. Don’t want to leave Gabe and Rowena hanging. But, uh, good talk!”
“We’re having sex, though.” He nuzzles into Dean. “It’s our anniversary.”
“Sure. We miss having you around, though. Look, no one’s going to push you into taking on a job you don’t want to do, but you know if you come by on Thursday round lunchtime there’ll be a hot dish in the break room…”
“Then don’t throw that away. Okay?”
“We’ve been saving for a rainy day.” Rowena smiles slyly. “If we get it, then I’ll tell you the best part.”
“Yeah, figures you wouldn’t wanna make things easy on me.”
“It would have been worth it… forgive me, my death would have been worth it, for you. Forgive me, it always will be.”
“You’re welcome.”
That changes things immediately. Sam brightens and rushes over to fuss proudly over his brother, cheery and animated as they discuss the strike team-- all three of them swept up enough on the excitement now that the conversation isn’t exactly coherent. Sam is repeating what Dean had told him about his upcoming tryout as the three of them finally get Dean’s clothes into Cas’ washing machine.
“Are you ready?” Sam asks pointedly.
“I just don’t… like being away from you. You got sucked up into the Empty in a scene straight out of… fucking Spawn, and it’s a miracle I get you back, but then you get your ass handed to you by Chuck and… I mean I know, historically, I’m a guy who can’t catch a break, but the past couple days have been a whole new level of not catching a break.”
Underneath the incredible reek of panic, pain, and fear, the omega in his arms that night had smelled of apples-- bright green apples, and warm, worn leather, and something soft and safe. It had been a scent that spoke of clean night air when summer turns to autumn, a whisper of the kind of freedom he never dreamt of having for himself and a promise of the kind of home he had not known. The kind of scent that said
He turns back and bends to kiss the top of her head, in a gesture of binding agreement, before hurrying off.
, to have a little while to forget the tragedies that they’ve both suffered.
“A lot’s happened. It’s… Look, this is the only version of me you’ve ever met, it’s different. You don’t… you don’t see the stuff that’s missing.”
“Yeah, Jody’s got a pair of girls there right now, I think.” Gabriel says, entirely missing the point of the anecdote.
When his hand returns to Dean’s shoulder, Dean stirs, just slightly, and so Sam stands back quietly and watches. He must have heard them talking, Cas’ voice must have broken through to him in his sleep, spurred him to try and claw his way back to wakefulness. Watches the gentleness with which Cas murmurs to him, watches the way he gives up on encouraging Dean to sleep, with that achingly familiar look of fond consternation. It’s a look he’s given Sam and Jack on occasion, but Dean gets it the most.
He finally peeks back over his shoulder, sees the warmth in Cas’ face, the complete lack of censure. Slowly, Dean rolls over, tugging Cas’ hand to come rest over the center of his chest.
“Yeah, come on,
“But, eventually, that’s something you’re… into, right? If we make it through this?”
“That I was gone-gone, is I believe how Sam put it, when I reached him.” Cas nods to Sam, and Dean whips around to look at him.
Dean wants to lick it. Wants to start at the vee of his shirt and lick a stripe up to his chin, wants to know what his stubble feels like against his tongue and wants to know if angels sweat, and if they do, what that sweat tastes like.
“Good to see you. So… you got work for me today?”
…” Cas looks at him like the question breaks his fucking heart, like he could be that person, and it’s confusing as hell, it makes Dean’s guts twist up, but it’s also the opposite of a boner kill. “You deserve. Please… please permit me to show you what it is you deserve. Allow me to adore you.”
He’s known him so long now, how long… how long had Cas known, or suspected, that what he felt was love,
As much as it’s even possible to.
“Very well. Just the lotion.” He sighs, indulgent, and Dean smells the lavender, hears the slick sound of Cas rubbing his hands together first to warm it up before he’s massaging it in. It still lessens the sting and the ache, even if it’s not for bruising.
“No, we need the team together on this.”
“Me and Cas?” Dean sniffs, looking up. “How d’you figure?”
, but she was… well, female. Which… You should know, I-- I’m not a very sexual person. And that’s probably-- I think we might both rather take some things slowly. But… the thing that matters to me isn’t that you’re an omega and I’m an alpha, it’s that you’re a man, and I‘m a man. I… I like that about you.”
“Oh, uh-- thanks, no, I’m-- I’m good at home.”
There’s only one rope stretched between this ledge and the next-- first come, first served, when it’s a competition between two members of the team at a time. But… that just gives Garth the opportunity to catch his breath while he watches Cas tackle it.
. When I got my, you know, it was… uh, it wasn’t nice like this.”
“Jody… I hope I’m not--”
“Before I met you, I didn’t think it was possible to hate chocolate raspberry.” Rowena tsks, shaking her head. “Just wrap your piece back up and take it home. You can pass it off to someone else later. At the center, maybe.”
“Oh, so it’s not just me with the freaky shit.” Dean laughs. He’s not sure why ‘laugh’ is what he goes to in the moment, but it is.
“If they get here and you need to go home, Gabriel or I can give you a ride back, no sense waiting even longer.” Cas nods. “But if you feel like staying, I’m glad.”
“You play Scrabble?”
of a hermit. Don’t hide in the bees, man.”
It’s brief, hesitant, but it’s sweet, and when his eyes flutter open again, he sees the apple blossoms that have drifted down into Dean’s hair and bursts out grinning.
“Yeah, yeah, I know, you sap. I love you. That’s why I’m pissed as hell right now.” He adds, though he’s pretty sure he sounds way too goopy to take seriously on that one. He can hear the tremor in his own voice, the telltale wetness and the choked-off tightness in his throat.
And if it’s something pretending to be Cas again, Sam will just… deal with it.
Would that be weird? It would probably be weird.
“I don’t know, my old man taught me to kill things. Swore in front of me a lot, too. I may not be working from the best playbook here myself.”
“Until you got old enough to think intergalactic smuggler might not be a valid career path?”
“You find a way and I’ll make it happen. Whatever it takes, we got this.”
“Rowena’s gonna be one hell of a mama bear.” He says. “She’s already good with this stuff, for other people. All the prenatal health and the birth and what to do about all those first little problems everyone faces, you know… she’s gonna be great, when it’s ours.”
“Han Solo couldn’t be an omega?” Cas frowns. The movies hadn’t gone into secondary gender-- perhaps in a galaxy far, far away, people don’t have them. Perhaps it was simply unimportant for the story being told, up to the audience to infer. Given that he’d wound up with Leia, he’d considered it possible they were an unconventional alpha-omega pair.
. More to the point, he’s known Cas so much longer, whatever they have, different as it is, is so much deeper, so much
“Spoiling me.” Dean groans, letting Cas shepherd him back to the master bath. “What’s dinner?”
He can’t look. He’d thought he could bring this up as a hypothetical first or something, but no, he gave Cas an ass-first view of the whole damn fetish.
“Dean, language. Jack is an impressionable young boy.”
“It’s… it’s kind of scary, honestly. Talking with Sam helped me realize what I want to do, but… Honestly, man, I don’t know if I could really do it, if… You really, you know. You make me feel like I can go for it. Like… I didn’t even think I could-- and I know it’s stupid, because obviously Donna, you know, she’d have told me I can do anything, she and Jody both would have, but… I dunno, it’s different. It’s stupid.”
Sam nods, only half-grudging. “I knew you guys had some kind of thing.”
He does ask which spots are tender, where the scar tissue still pulls or aches, sometimes after years, so that he won’t dig in anyplace that would hurt, but that’s it, and Dean relaxes and lets him.
He’s starving.
Dean does not say any of the obvious things he could say, to that. His brain shorts out when it approaches the very thought.
“Yeah, I got that, but
The opening essay is written by simply ‘Jack T.’-- so, not the Jack Cas knows. Well, not either of them, but only one of them is an alpha, anyway. Though,  more than the question of whether he might have ever met the author, he’s struck by the fact that he likes the name. It’s a good solid name. A boyish name, a friendly name.
mishandled any aspect of this situation, he’s driven them away-- if he can’t gain Sam’s trust, if Sam sees through him, if Sam thinks he’s acted out of selfishness, acted on his own feelings instead of in Dean’s best interest, then of course he’ll be all the more insistent on returning Dean home. On wanting to keep Dean safe from
It’s too much, being loved like this. Being seen like this. He still wants more of it.
“Yeah…”
He trails off, and Dean pets at him, as best he can reach, tries to school himself so that he can impart the kind of calm and comfort Cas needs.
“Dammit, Cas, I can’t-- Sam, this plan, we can do it with just three of us, can’t we?”
“You’re just having salad? I take it back, you’re not okay without me if this is how you’re eating.” Dean elbows him. “You’re friggin’ six and a half feet tall, you need to eat real food.”
.” One syllable, soft but emphatic, that’s all it takes to make his guts twist up inside him, that’s all it takes to push his heart up into his throat. “I’m here… I’m
“Let’s say three things-- at least one way you protect the people you care about, at least one way you provide for them, and then just one more thing, it can be any category.”
“You make me happy, Cas. Look… I know you. I trust you. And this is real nice. I could sleep like this, I think. Wake up like this. Not freak out, because it is you. You don’t have to want sex, and you don’t have to not want sex, ‘cause I know whenever it happens it’s only gonna be because we both want it. Or at least because we both want to try. Some day, I’m gonna want to try… if I’m wrong, you’ll stop for me. Just like I would for you. But… it gets to be our choice. I’m going on suppressants for now. If I stop ‘em… it’ll be because we both feel good about whatever comes next. Whether it’s spending a heat together, or me taking a weekend away and calling you on the phone just to see how I handle that, or, I don’t know, shit. Whatever it is. I… You’re my alpha, Cas.
? Trying to imagine another person wanting more than a good time out of him?
They both try to watch the screen.
“Damn straight.” Dean nods. “You can dry a man out and you can send him to rehab, but you can’t make bacon stop tasting like a salty, crispy little slice of heaven.”
“I know. You’re very sweet like that.” Cas kisses his cheek, as best he can with the way his grin splits his face. “I don’t feel like having an orgasm, but… you can still touch me a little bit, if you want to.”
“I started all of this after seeing the conditions my own brother was sold into, after springing him. I understand… I understand the moment you grow up into the protector, when you’ve always had an older brother protecting you. I don’t understand the pain of being too late to save him. But… we have saved omegas from long-term captivity before.”
“I’m afraid not.”
“I could never do that to another mother.” She gives him a scandalized look.
Things remain quiet, until Gabriel and Rowena roll in with a small gaggle of shoppers, slipping into the booth to help with the next round of sales.
“Thought the center was business.”
“Time will tell what it means. But yes, so it seems. I can tell you what I know, when I have my strength back. I… I need to get my strength back, if I am to fight by your side.”
“I could still do part of the course.” He finds himself saying, only it’s the stupid part of him saying it, the part of him that’s seen Dean impressed and just wants to keep him that way, just wants to have Dean look at him like he’s still…
It’s still not the full story, but he feels shaky just saying this much, hadn’t realized after all this time it would make him sick to try and recount it.
“That sounds like a good life, fixing things. I… I will have to return to fixing things, myself. With Jack, I mean. It’s a big job dealing with everything that’s been wrong in Chuck’s heaven, and he’s so young… and so afraid of making mistakes that would hurt the souls in his care there. Perhaps… when you find yourself with a job, I will keep the same working hours as you do? We could… come home together?”
.” Cas’ whisper is a low rumble, he tilts his head to kiss the heel of Dean’s hand. “Believe in us?”
“I know I was… you know, I was kind of… chicken-shit, about the whole… So I gotta thank you for getting the band back together, you know? Because the thing I want, the thing I’ve always wanted… you gave me that, Cas.” Dean’s voice wavers as well. “And now… I mean nothing’s, you know, we haven’t gotten anything, uh, finalized. I don’t know, you know, for me… it’ll probably take a lot of paperwork and references and shit, and it’s not like we’ll be working together-together, but still… part of the same team, that’s more than good enough for me.”
“Until I presented.” He shrugs.
“Dean. Look at me.” Cas’ voice is gentle, his hands are warm, and Dean wants to keep his walls up, but he can’t help himself. He can’t refuse him. “There… I understand… there have been times when my actions have broken the faith between us. To ask you to believe in me now when I am… less than what I was, is an enormous thing. To ask for you to have faith at all, when our creator has turned on us, when time and time again you have been asked so much of and repaid in pain, maybe that is too much. But I believe in you. I believe in us. All of us… I have faith. Not the faith I was made for. But the faith I was made for was shaken. This, this thing that I feel now? It may be the only solid thing.”
“Or Sam and Jack return without you, and I… I have not come this far to lose you, not like that. Please, Dean… if I asked
Tybalt comes with, and Cas sets aside his worries over next week, happily recounting the events of his last Saturday over the drive. After the booth is set up, Gabriel and Rowena show him pictures of the house they’re hoping for-- a cozy little cottage, with a detached mother-in-law unit and a lot of green open space. Ideal for if they had to host someone, but the detached unit could become a workspace, too. In their current apartment, the kitchenette is so often overrun with Rowena’s work, it makes cooking regular meals difficult at times. If they don’t need to take in anyone, she could do her candlemaking and various balms and salves and such out there, maybe use the bedroom as an office of sorts. It looks like the perfect place.
“Very well.” He nods. “If this appeases tradition.”
like they’re folding Dean into the pack, with all the help he provides as the summer crawls on, even if it’s all help he’s paid for. It’s the extra time he spends around the three of them, and the grin that lights up his face when he sees Cas use his long-neglected woodworking tools not only for the repairs, but to start work on building a rocking chair for the nursery.
“I don’t know that I can make that promise. I don’t know how to not protect you.”
“Yeah. Yeah. It’s… this is a real nice set-up. I’m just happy working with my hands, outside. Get kind of sick of sitting around, but… dunno.”
Dean nods, and they return to their separate tasks. After a while, though, Castiel hears a little snatch of song, Dean singing absently to himself as he works. He hadn’t been doing that before… it’s a nice thought, that he’s grown comfortable in his presence. Does he sing to himself when he does his chore rotations with Jody’s foster pack? Hum along to the radio as he studies for his GED?
“Did you do that?” Sam looks between them, and just stops himself from prodding at Cas’ face before Dean has to swoop in and slap his hand away.
He can hear Sam take a few carefully-measured deep breaths.
Everything about Cas makes him feel kind of warm and fuzzy.
“I don’t need to hear it.”
a rooster, and not one noise complaint. They’d have been knocking on our door with the police back in town. We’re
“I’m awake.” He coughs, looking studiously into his coffee cup and hoping that was Sam’s ‘you’re the worst person before ten AM’ voice and not Sam’s ‘I need to know less about your sex life’ voice.
He knows he could.
“Do we have someone who does vehicle maintenance?”
…” Dean sighs, head lolling against the chair.
“Okay, well. I’ll come to you first if I need anything, then.”
“You are a tremendous part of that. And a tremendous part of me.”
“But the other day, you didn’t say-- I thought my brother was dead and you could have told me that it wasn’t just ‘some cases’, that you knew
“I mean…” He sweeps a hand out towards the garden. “You’ve told me all this stuff about soil and crop rotation and plants, and today you taught me about how bees work, and you help run this whole organization and you plan stuff out there, so you tell me. Sounds like you know your stuff. Even if you don’t know any bands.”
“Who’s Jerry Garcia?” He asks, when their first little crowd moves on, and he’s afraid that Rowena might return to some more serious topic.
“No, no, I… I just need to talk to you.”
“No. Not at all. I don’t know how he looked when he first came to us, but I do know he’s been putting on some healthy muscle, he’s gotten his color back… I really don’t mean to worry you in any way, about how you’ll find him. I’m not the expert, when it comes to that side of things, but he has had experts guiding his recovery-- people who specialize in healing from trauma, some of whom have been where he’s been, to some extent. He’s… I just want to assure you that healing isn’t a lonely process in a sterile environment. A lot of people imagine something like a hospital setting, and… that’s where most people start, but the goal is full, normal, lives. I… I very much hope that you finding us like this is going to help Dean along that path. He… he deserves that. The job is also yours, if-- if meeting with some of the team leaves you feeling like this is what you want to do. You still could help a lot of people. But… but of course Dean will be your first priority now, and… I just wanted you to know, the job is also yours, but you’d be free to take some time before starting.”
turns out I got a little something out of s15e19 after all...
“Practical.” He laughs, kiss landing on Cas’ chin again before he snuggles down into his chest.
“I will try very hard, then.” He smiles, and kisses Dean softly. Sweetly. “I have been granted… considerably more power than I once had. So I am likely to survive, if I must place myself between you and death yet again.”
“You don’t even call the families?”
Cas' POV
“Oh, use your hands on me.” The sound he makes is low and tempting, something between another groan and a laugh, and he grinds down into Cas’ lap. “Yeah, that sounds
He waits, and so Cas nods, not sure what to say, or if he needs to say anything-- not until Garth actually asks.
Also, how soon he can get up from the table might depend on how often Cas licks bacon grease and toast crumbs off his fingers, but he’s going to try not to think about that.
“I need some beds dug up so I can get spinach and broccoli planted, and the peas need some attention. The strawberry pots need their mid-season fertilizing, and I’ll be looking over the tomatoes-- sometime soon it’s going to be time to prune them back and encourage the fruits I have to grow, this week or next week… How are you?”
“I don’t even understand how you’re here in the first place.” He shakes his head. “How can I trust you won’t-- I’m not used to being able to hold onto a good thing, Cas.”
“Mister Winchester, I appreciate your feeling, but in many cases we can’t look for family until the client in question tells us which family members they’ll be safe with. After everything your brother went through, he needed to do a certain amount of healing before he could think about that… but in the end, well… here you are. I’ve spoken to Dean, I’d like to send you a time and location, so we can arrange your reunion. Is that all right?”
“I will be.”
you to be, because I need you, and because-- because you hurt, it hurts me, so… And nothing can happen to you, nothing serious, because I haven’t kissed you yet, and like hell will I accept the end of the world when I haven’t kissed you. So you’re going to feel better. You just are, because-- because I said so, dammit, because he’s not allowed to hurt us anymore.”
“Sammy grew up. He-- he went to a real university, he became a lawyer, and… He’s not a kid anymore. And if this is the shit he wades through for a living now, then he… he knows what happens to sixteen year old omegas when they get picked up and sold off. How do I look that kid in the eyes, when he… How am I supposed to be strong for him again now?”
He only takes his hand from Dean’s to be able to help him sip a little water, and to feed him Good and Plenty, from a box he’d had in one of the big pockets of his trench coat. Dean kisses at his fingertips, before holding up his hand to silently demand it be held again.
, acceptable to
“Okay. Stop me if it’s too much?”
. And when she died, he really was. I learned how to do everything for him, and I was damn good at that, too. And I coulda-- if she’d’ve lived or if half this shit hadn’t happened to me, I coulda been a damn good omega.”
“Come on, Cas, you don’t want to be responsible for teen girl War Games?” Dean grins at him-- and Charlie’s face lights up.
“How sore are you?” Cas asks, coming up to cup his jaw in one hand-- and he has perfect hands, so warm and so careful, and work-roughed from the garden… the opposite of the hands that used to touch him like a thing to be used, that used to hurt him. Cas is always so careful with him-- not too gentle, not like he thinks Dean will break, but careful, like he’s always gauging how much tenderness Dean needs, ready to be gentle or firm depending on the touch he needs.
“I brought meat.” Cas says.
“The thing?” Cas feels like he’s missing something, and for a moment he curses trying to do this over the phone, but if anything he thinks it would be worse in person.
“Sam? I couldn’t reach Dean.” Cas’ voice, worried. “I called several times.”
“Well, well, well, what do we have here?” She greets, swinging the door open wide and waving him in-- apparently his scent remains neutralized enough, at least for her current crop of omegas.
“Though… you probably don’t still have wings, huh?”
him for that. Cas is the one person Dean can let his guard down with. Not the way he does with Sam, because with Sam, even when he drops the walls and lets things get emotional, there’s always a part of him that’s ready to jump between Sam and trouble and there always will be. And no matter how big or how old or how capable Sam gets, he’s always going to be the baby brother Dean needs to look out for. With Cas, he could… he could learn to let someone else be the strong one.
Wednesday is spent recovering from Monday and Tuesday, but then Thursday comes and it feels the same sort of day as Sunday had been. It’s not like he doesn’t have enough to busy himself with, he has Tybalt and the bees to look after, the regular upkeep of his garden, the exercises he got from PT… it should be a more fulfilling day than usual, if anything. When the feeling doesn’t dissipate, he thinks about putting something on TV, but he only faces the same problem he does every time-- being spoiled for choice, with no idea of what he would even
“Oh. Uh, cool.” He gnaws at his lip a moment, hand trailing over the door. “He never mentioned driving.”
Cas snorts bitterly, massage never faltering. “No, no-- thank you, for calling it that. It… it means more, from you. It was… I wasn’t ‘acting like an alpha’, when I was young. Twelve or so, maybe, when… I presented at the same age as Michael and Lucifer had. I wasn’t like them… no desire to fight my way to the top, I suppose. No interest in typical omegas… I was the youngest, there was an element of wait and see at first-- with those two, it was no surprise, if I wasn’t openly competitive. And while it’s normal enough to present around the onset of puberty, it can be a longer process to fully come into it, but… well. I didn’t change much. I hid it, when I learned I was interested in men… even then, my fantasies weren’t sexual. But they found out. They sent me to this… woman. She was supposed to ‘correct’ me. Measure my responses-- to visual, audio, and olfactory stimuli, sometimes in concert, sometimes just… putting up pictures of male and female omegas, then betas, then other alpha. Or just having me smell a card that had been swabbed with a stranger’s sweat. And then they could introduce unpleasant sensations if I reacted to the wrong things.”
“I am definitely playing ‘pimpmobile’ as a word in Scrabble, if it takes me my whole life.” Dean laughs, and Cas opens the door for him, before going around to the driver’s side.
of him as he fights the urge to drag him down and grind up against him like they were teenagers…
Despite his earlier treat, Tybalt has a great interest in the box from the butchers, and the drive becomes a test of wills, with Gabriel holding the box in his lap and Rowena holding the cat in hers. His protests are vocal enough to make conversation not worth the bother, as he’s prevented from finding the chicken he knows to be near. Under the circumstances, Cas thinks swinging by Jody’s on the way home is a reasonable measure-- though the task of taking the box to the door is still pushed onto him. He’d have to get out of the truck anyway, if Gabriel were going to take it, without having to juggle a determined Tybalt.
“You are not ‘dumb’, Dean.”
“Jody said it was a sure thing.”
. I have a gospel record, a collection of classical piano on CD, and The Sound of Music, and I picked those up at a thrift store just because they were vaguely familiar.”
Which he gives it. Shows Cas how to vary the speed, the grip, how to throw in a little twist here… he works his balls, too, rolls them in his other palm and gives a little tug because sometimes it’s good like that. Pulls off and edges himself with just tracing his fingertips over himself, then traps his cock against his stomach and just grinds into his hand. The whole shebang.
“Nonsense, you’ve got your bag with you. Throw your laundry in here and spend the night with Samuel, you can head back over to Jody’s tomorrow.”
If there had been a chance of his being an omega, they wouldn’t have seen him as an
