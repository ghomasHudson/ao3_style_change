Cas woke up to the smell of pancakes and coffee. Dean wasn’t there anymore and so Castiel assumed that he was in the kitchen, preparing breakfast. It was a little after 9 am when he walked to the kitchen and was greeted by Dean wearing an apron and a pair of sweatpants, without a shirt.
Apparently, John wasn't there, which relieved Cas. He cooked some scrambled eggs and bacon and chose to make a fruit salad for Sam, since he knew the younger Winchester tried to eat healthy, compared to his brother. He heard footsteps and when he turned around he saw Dean walking down, his hair still wet from the shower. The other man walked up to him and gave him a soft kiss before grabbing the painkiller which was on the kitchen counter. Before he could take one, Cas reached out and stopped him. "What," Dean asked. "You need to eat first otherwise it's not going to work". Dean sighed and sat down at the kitchen table, clearly annoyed. "Don't be grumpy, you'll thank me later". Cas sat down next to Dean after putting the food onto the table. Sam came downstairs a few minutes later and they ate while having a light and happy conversation. John had apparently gone to work or whatever and Dean looked more relaxed even though Cas knew something was still bothering him.
He waited a little time and after there was no response he went to bed. The next morning he woke up pretty early since he had class this morning. After class he went to the supermarket. He put everything he needed in his basket, which was mostly pie and some things for breakfast and dinner, and then went to the meat section go get some bacon and some ribs. When he reached the aisle, he almost walked into another customer that was grabbing something out of the refrigerator. There, at the other end of the aisle, was the guy from the library. He could have spotted him everywhere. He walked up to him and tapped his shoulder. The other man turned around and he saw that he froze. Blue eyes looked at him and for a second Dean froze too. He put on a smile “hey" Dean said. The guy didn't answer right away but after a second or two he finally spoke “Hey... Dean wasn’t it?” “Yes..." "Castiel" Dean repeated his name in his head.
Castiel’s first class today was psychology and he was really excited to have something to do again. Not that the last weeks hadn’t been great, but he could finally forget for a while and not get lost in his thoughts. Time flew by and suddenly it was lunchtime already. He sat at the wooden cafeteria tables with Dean. there weren’t that many people in the cafeteria, a group of girls on his right and some people with their noses in their books barely remembering to eat.  “I have an idea,” the man across from him said, “ what do you say we go see a movie this Friday and then grab something to eat?”. Cas thought about this idea for a moment. “I would like that”. He said smiling.
"He should've at least called," the dark-haired boy scoffed. He got off the couch and approached the coat rack. He grabbed a scarf and his trench coat. "I'm not gonna let him hear the end of this..." He left the apartment and began to make his way to Rocky's.
I know," Dean replied calmly.
She growled and scratched at Dean's face. Blood spotted from his wounds. The only thing keeping her from killing him was that he had her wrists locked into his hands. After gathering some strength, he kicked her off then went to grab the knife he hid in his jacket. Kara gasped, then there was a thump. Dean looked back up and froze.
A chill was sent down Dean's spine. He immediately melted into Cas's hand. That's when he knew this was real, that Cas was going to die. That he wasn't going to be able to say it back. A tear rolled down his cheek and onto Castiel's bloody hand. His body felt so hot with emotion, and without thinking, he threw himself onto the angel. He gripped him so tightly, exactly as Cas did to him all those years ago in Hell. He pulled back to look into Cas's eyes.
The guy underestimated Dean. Because gays can't fight, not like
"Why should you care? Are you married?" He pointed at the ring. She scoffed playfully.
"I can't stop it," the hunter began to walk towards Castiel, "She's gonna get through that door."
Dean's face flushed red.
"What the FUCK!" His fist slammed onto his thigh. An ache spread throughout his entire body.
"Dean, are you ok?" Sam held on to his older brother's shoulders.
She was terrifying.
"I'm.." He inhaled the exhaled once more. "I'm leaving you." Dean's heart stopped, and he inhaled sharply. He stood still, staring at the angel. "I'm sorry," Cas's voice broke into a whisper.
"But after what I did, why?" Dean chuckled lightly, more tears falling down his face.
"I love you."
Even now, after seeing the love of his life, dead and cold in the snow, he's lying to himself. The guilt and nausea worsened.
"That's what Cas told me." He turned around and saw Pamela had a smirk plastered on her face. "What?" He smiled at her.
Dean cursed at himself under his breath. It was freezing outside. He rubbed his hands along his arms for warmth, and he couldn't help but find it a little funny.
The guilt hit him like a sack of bricks. Cas had never even said 'I love you' back to him. All those times Dean had held him, and kissed him, and told him he loved him, Cas never once said it back.
"Excuse me?" He turned around to stare at the stranger.
He stared down at it and shook his head. New tears made their way down the track marks the old ones had left behind. He turned the stereo on.
Blade in hand, Castiel had a death grip on Dean's broken arm, he could see his face flash with pain as he squeezed harder.
"I'm sorry for not showing up. I got caught up with my family." Dean's stern look softened. He could understand something like that.
"I love you," Dean said for a third and final time.
"She said that?" Before Dean could continue, Kara exploded. "That bitch! You had no business knowing what I did!" She sighed. "I guess now I'm going to have to do to you what I did to the rest of them..." The hunter backed away, not sure of what would happen next. Kara's eyes flickered a hazel color, her pupils grew deadly, and her nails curved into sharp talents. She lunged at Dean before he could dodge her.
"Get off your ass and do it yourself," he said bluntly.
"Which would've been the day after..." Sam finished. Dean nodded and sniffled. All he could do was hug his big brother before he left him to his business.
"You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know." Tears threatened to spill from his eyes, so Castiel tried to smile through it. He tried so hard to just focus on Dean and not himself. It would be so selfish for him to let himself cry. "You know ever since we met, and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me." He couldn't hold it back any longer. Tears began to fall down his cheeks. Yet still, he smiled because he was looking at the only thing that mattered to him at that moment, Dean. Dean was the whole reason he was doing this; the reason he was sacrificing himself. Castiel would rather die knowing that Dean was safe than having a life after Dean's inevitable death.
They walked around back, which was where employees would enter the building. Dean searched for any evidence that anyone was back there. There was no one. He studied Cas, and then his mouth twitched into a tiny smile.
"You look nice today, Cas." Dean eyed his boyfriend and tossed him a wink. He took Cas's hand with his own and used his other one to cup his face.
"You two have fun last night?" Pamela got close to whisper, a small smirk tugged at her lips.
"Inias, can you check the schedule for me?" Cas brought his head over his shoulder to ask his colleague. Inias scoffed and fluffed his newspaper.
"Thank you."
"Because you cared, I cared, I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack... but I cared about the whole world because of you." He took a long pause to look carefully at Dean. I mean, he had been looking at Dean this entire time, but this time it was different. Castiel needed to look at every detail, every freckle on Dean's face.
"You don't have to say it back..." He stared into the very soul of Castiel, his very grace. "I know, angels don't emotions like humans do, and well.." He trailed off, his gaze fell to Cas's lips, then the floor. He let go of the angel and turned away from him, embarrassed of himself.
He shook his head.
"I never found an answer." Castiel continued. "Because the one thing I want... It's something I know I can't have." He had to shake his head at that last bit. Never in a million years did he think he'd finally be able to admit this to Dean.
"I love you," Cas said, puckering his lips playfully.
The hunter jerked awake, banging his knee up against the steering wheel. He cursed loudly to himself, rubbed his eyes, then sat up. Dean tapped the wheel before checking his watch. He had only gotten 3 hours of sleep. It was 2:39 am, and he needed a drink. He put the keys in the ignition then sped down the road a few minutes later.
"Dean, I'm so sorry." He pulled back, and Dean could see he was getting ready to zap out. He grabbed onto his wrist once more and pulled him close.
"Cas, no!"
"Cas," he whispered, he gave a small squeeze on his wrist. Cas had a sad, regretful smile on his face.
Dean could see it, all the years of pining and longing and, all of the years that he waited, Dean could see all of that in the angel's eyes. That was it; he had finally said it. Dean was always so scared of this day. He was scared to let himself love someone, in fear that he might lose them. Yet there Dean was, standing before the person he loved, about to lose him. There was nothing he could do. He was frozen. He so badly wanted to say it back but, his mouth wouldn't move.
"Fine," she groaned, "but you're working late tomorrow, understood?"
Cars honked at one another on the busy street. At some point, someone would always roll their window down to bark at the person in front of them.
"I always wondered," Castiel changed the position in which he was standing. The feeling of bittersweet anticipation had engulfed his entire body. "Ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be. What my true happiness could even look like." Cas looked longingly at Dean. Everything he's ever felt and wanted to say, it was beginning to make its way up his throat and out of his mouth. Dean just stood before the angel, scared and confused at what he might say.
Coming out of the dumpster was a long, wooden stake. It had gone right through Dean. The man backed away to get a better look at his victim. He covered his mouth before running away.
This time he charged head-on, full intentions of trapping the man on the wall, just like he did to Dean. When the two met, the man clung to Dean and forced him onto a nearby dumpster. The Winchester felt a white-hot pain. He tried to move forward, but he couldn't. It felt like someone was dragging glass through him.
Cas just stared at him. As if he didn't know how to respond.
The world turned black.
He pulled the bloodied man closer.
There on the coat rack, lay his jacket. He forgot it again.
"I dunno," he looked down to fix the position his watch was sitting on his wrist, "10:30. Maybe 11, depends if Pam has me working late or not again." He shrugged thoughtlessly. That awkward feeling disappeared. "Why, you want me to come over tonight or something?"
Cas flinched slightly at the pet name. He looked up from pumping the gas.
"Oh, I'm Dean." He smiled sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his neck. Soon they stood in awkward silence.
"I'd quit for him." Dean propped himself up on his right elbow. "The life... I would now, anyway. You know, I pictured us with a family at some point. I don't know why, but I did." He looked down at his finger as he chuckled, tears welled in his eyes. "I was going to-" Dean's voice broke slightly, though he cleared his throat so it would be hard to notice. "I wanted to marry him, Sammy. I had bought a ring and everything. That night, when he walked out, the ring was right in my pocket. I was going to do it on our anniversary."
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to the station! After having heard our sponsors, we think you'll like what we have for you tonight."
"Thanks for walking me to work." Dean placed his hand into Cas's.
Dean stepped foot out of the bunker and took a deep breath, embracing the crisp autumn air. It was the first time he had left on his own, not for AA or therapy. He was happy. Sam came out soon after, he had a huge smile plastered on his face. He was so proud of his brother. Dean wanted to walk around the wooded area by the bunker just for a while. He wanted to see the part of life where there were no monsters, no worries, no Cas, nothing that could harm Dean. Sam checked his phone to see what time a burger joint would open around town as he walked off.
Dean stood there in silence, he stared at where Cas used to stand. His shoulders slumped and he let out a heavy sigh.
"You waiting for anyone? You look lonely." She fingered the ring on her finger, Dean noticed quickly.
Cas visibly tensed at her words.
"Afternoon Clarence."
"I have a date tonight." Dean gave her the cheapest smile.
The coppery taste of blood filled his mouth, and he could barely see Cas anymore. Everything was a blur. Dean felt far away, but he could still feel Castiel's fist crash into his jaw. His arm seemed to throb endlessly
"Whatever," Pam picked a glass up off the counter, "you know you left your jacket here last night?"
"Dean?"
"Cas, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, but if you're in there and you can hear me, you don't have to do this." The angel lifted his arm to hit Dean with the blunt end of his blade. "Cas!" The blade hit the stone, and there was a flash of light, then the sound of thunder.
"Like you wanna know what me and Cas do in the sack." Dean snorted.
Dean kicked the bedroom door open as Cas led him in. Not once did their lips part. Dean balled his hands in the angel's hair. Soft moans escaped his mouth. Cas bit his boyfriend's lip slightly before going back to exploring his mouth with his tongue. He laid the hunter down on the bed, unbuttoning his shirt slowly. Dean quickly took advantage of the angel's position and flipped him over, so he was on top. A burgundy color crept up Cas's neck and onto his face. From there, his boyfriend began to kiss up and down his neck. He bit softly on his sweet spots to make him moan softly.
"Eh, I don't think so. I don't sound like her anyway." Dean joked. Then he remembered about his job and checked his watch.
"Good riddance," Castiel snapped back to reality and turned around. A man rubbed the side of his face slowly. "One less Nancy polluting the world." The man looked Cas in the eye with a crooked smile.
He wanted to run from her.
"Yeah, anyway, I gotta go." Dean winked then disappeared into the bar.
Frozen, all Dean could do is watch the man's fist every time it made contact with his face. What was he doing? He knew how to fight. The realization was like waking up from a dream. Before the man could punch him again, Dean was able to kick the man and break free. The man almost looked shocked.
"Can I help you?" The Winchester tensed at the presence of the stranger. He looked vaguely familiar.
"Yeah, uh," Dean rubbed the back of his neck, "I'd say, "It won't happen again," but we both know that's not true." He grinned sheepishly at his boss.
The hunter swallowed the lump in his throat. He pulled out his wallet and left a generous tip for the barista before getting up and going.
“They are hideous” he mumbled, returning back to reality, as Dean’s fingers brushed over them. His hand stopped moving and his other hand lifted Castiel’s chin, making him look the green-eyed boy in the eyes.
“When we wanted to have
“The jury has decided. In terms of the charges the Novak family has been found guilty in all charges.” Castiel’s eyes widened as happiness and relief ran through his body. Tears formed in his eyes as a big smile spread across his face. Castiel had to control himself though since the sentence hadn’t been spoken yet and the trial wasn’t finished yet. He quickly glanced at Dean who was beaming with happiness.
“Gabriel just called…” he started.
“No Dean I want to take you out for being there for me,” Cas said pulling out his own wallet.
“So what did you want to talk about?” Dean asked when neither of them said anything. Gabe cleared his throat, taking another sip from his coffee.
“Have I told you, you look good when you are blushing?” Dean asked jokingly, which made Castiel’s face heat up even more. Cas turned back to Dean who was looking at him with pure love and affection in his eyes.
“Mr. Foster if what you are saying was true, then what reason would my client have to sue his own family?”. Mr. Foster cleared his throat before answering.
“You’re drunk and you need to rest,” Dean told him tiredly, coming around the bed trying to pull the blue-eyed boy up, who had laid down now, refusing to get up.
“Yea… it’s just that…” he said looking down between their bodies.
"Dean I have to study," Cas said, clearly trying to concentrate but he couldn't stop himself from smiling.
They say love changes everything
Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding
How do you contain the ardent flame
Like a shallow needs the profound, reach the ground
Between
No more to fear like an in the ocean falling tear
How long can I hold this masquerade
The way you live and how you die
The truth was lost hidden within
It’s like the past time never came
Since then, me it’s never stopped to haunt
Tear up my disguise with my teeth
My demons are crawling
Don’t you know, you‘re my sunshine?
The armor I wore was harder than before
Torn I stand, we rend till there's nothing to mend
How could I ever be worthy of your love
The ocean always comes back to the land
In your touch I thrive,
Pretend you don’t made me whole.
By my own fears I’ve been overpowered
Forgive me, I couldn’t stop your falling
It’s like our most forbidden sin
That it’s all true
And you never knew
Regardless down you dive,
Never wanted you that price to pay.
Watch me, I’m falling
Grace holder
Like a sinner needs forgiveness, grace nothing less
Take Me to Church - Hozier
You’re my brother till the end
You just saw the boundaries I draw
Your principles, your dignity,
When my final fight gets past
Broken not bent, my prayers I’ll send till the end
There are times I don’t even feel human
And renew your initial claim
In your tempting sheen I’m fragile like a figurine
Pretend sunsets never die, but darkness doesn't lie
Considering myself brave I was a coward
And tell me everything’s alright,
I’d fall into your sunlight
Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas and hope you like this chapter.
Castiel entered his apartment and slid down his door, after he closed it. The bottle in his hand was almost empty. He sat there, in his empty apartment, crying and shivering from all the stress he had. His heart was shattered into even more pieces now. He really believed that Dean could fix him but he was wrong. Castiel opened his eyes to a knock on the door. He hadn't realized that he had fallen asleep. He stood up and didn't even ask who it was before opening the door. Dean was standing in front of him, concern and panic in his features. Without saying a word, he took Castiel into a tight embrace. Castiel, still drunk, pushed him away and took a few steps back. "Cas..." Dean said, without moving. "Cas I am sorry. Whatever I did, I am sorry. I..." "Don't. Dean. Just go. I got it. I was just a fling for you. I get it. You can go now. Please leave me alone. „Castiel said, tears filling his beautiful, blue eyes. Dean took a step forward. "Cas I am sorry. Can we please talk about it?" Castiel, who was facing the other direction, turned around. "GO AWAY!" he screamed. His whole body was trembling by now as he walked towards his living room. Instead of leaving, Dean closed the still open door and followed Castiel. He had barely time to step aside, before the empty bottle hit the wall behind him. The bottle exploded and the glass shards fell to the floor. Dean jolted around, when something else hit the ground. An old violin was thrown at the ground and broke immediately. The broken neck was now lying a few inches away from the rest and the strings were the only thing connecting them. It was horrible.
“What do you mean?”
“Hey”
“Hey, it’s your first flight. Everything will be fine,” Dean assured him, taking his hand intertwining their fingers. The plane started speeding up and Dean’s grip around Castiel’s hand tightened. Castiel looked questioningly at Dean.
As if knowing that Cas was thinking about him, Dean looked up from his plate, smiling genuinely at him. Cas returned the smile before continuing with eating his pasta.
. Castiel was thinking about this for
“Maybe not a bar considering the case we’re just working on?” Sam commented.
"Hey honey, what do you want to eat for dinner?" his mother asked. "I don't know, whatever you want. I really don't mind" Cas said while sitting on one of the kitchen chairs."So tell me, is there anything going on between you and Anna?" she asked as she started preparing dinner. Castiel noticed the dish his mother was making, lasagna. He loved his mother’s lasagna. "No there is nothing between Anna and me and by the way she has a boyfriend now" Castiel’s mother looked sad for a second before smiling at him. "Well you will find the right girl soon enough" she said. Castiel wanted to remind her that he would never find the right
"It will all go fine. They won't let that not go to trial".
They were woken up by someone cleaning their throat. Cas, still sleepy, lifted his head slightly looking at Dean. Dean was waking up and looked at him confused. Turning his head he saw his parents and Lucifer standing behind him. Cas froze and felt Dean's body stiffen as well. Fear rushed through his veins, as he pulled away and sat up, his head turned to his family. "What is going on here" his mother asked angrily. Cas didn't trust himself to speak but didn't have to as Dean answered for his. "We fell asleep on the couch, since we didn't get enough sleep last night" Dean said calm. Cas admired how he could stay so composed. "Is that how you fall asleep in college? Lying on one another" his mother getting angrier with every second. Cas finally trusted himself to speak. "It's not what it looks like..." he started but his father cut him off. “Yea. To me it looks like my gay son is all over his "friend"", anger in his voice as well. His heartbeat increased and Cas knew it was first signs of a panic attack but he tried to ignore them as best as he could. "I can stay here watching this, when I come back I want you to be gone" his father said before leaving, slamming the door behind him. "So Cassie, how long have you two been together. Or are you just fucking him because no one wants to be around you longer than he has to" his brother asked with a devilish smile. "Watch it" Dean snarled. He was standing now, fists clenched. Cas stood as well but to afraid to speak. He wanted to say so many things but he couldn't find his voice. "Stay out of this" Castiel's mother said, shooting him a sharp look. "The hell I am. You have treated him like he is less since we walked in here. Yes he likes boys. And, what is the problem. Only because you are too religious or whatever to understand him. You have no right to treat him that way because if you can't accept him that I am sorry but you're a shitty family and deserve to burn in hell". Dean yelled, face full of anger. Cas couldn't move. He just stood there, not being able to process what just happened. Dean had stood up to his family. They only knew each other for two months and he had done more for him than his family had ever done. He wanted to kiss him and hug him.
The after party was awesome. Cas hadn't had such a great time, in years. After the first dance of the night, which the couple danced to Hey Jude by the Beatles, honoring Dean’s mother who used to sing this to Dean when he was younger, everybody got on the dancefloor, moving along to the music. Cas was already a little drunk by the time they cut the cake. To Castiel’s defense it wasn’t his fault.
"I'll stay and help you study," Dean said happily and grabbed the book closest to him. He looked at the cover of it and grimaced. "The history of the greatest writers, really?" he asked and opened it to a random page and started reading. "Shakespeare is considered one of England's greatest writers. He has written over almost 200 works and writers still get inspired from his work. How boring" Dean stated and closed the book again. "If you are just here to say how boring this is you are free to go," Cas said teasingly. After some teasing Dean promised to behave and they actually managed to study a lot and when they finished Castiel felt prepared. It was almost 2am and Dean decided to spend the night there. Castiel's exam was at 1pm so he could at least get a decent amount of sleep. Dean quickly texted Sammy that he wouldn't come home tonight and then they both got ready for bed. Cas fell asleep immediately from the exhaustion and stress he had over the past hours.
“Then I have no further questions, your honor,” Gabe said, cutting anything off Lucifer could have said.
The room wasn’t really big, with a table on one side and a white screen and lights on the other side. In front of the screen was a camera on a tripod. The woman and Gabriel talked for a few minutes but Cas didn’t really pay attention to what they were saying. He was too anxious to even notice that the woman was now speaking to him.
“Dean,” Castiel said in a gentle voice, “you won’t hurt me okay? If it’s uncomfortable then I’ll let you know. And being afraid or scared isn’t a bad thing. We’ll do it together and then it won’t be so scary anymore,” he soothed, reaching out a hand and caressing Dean’s cheek.
When everyone left it was already after 2 am, and Rafael and Michael had fallen asleep a few hours ago on Dean’s sofa and were now complaining about having to drive home. Everybody had helped clean the kitchen a little, taking the plates they had brought with them, home again. Sam had gone to bed, tired from the night and the alcohol, leaving Cas and Dean alone. The two boys were sitting in the living room, each a glass of Whiskey in hand, talking about the past day.
Cas was woken up by a groan. He looked over to see Dean with a hand on his head. Cas knew Dean had a bad hangover. He didn't look at Cas right away and instead turned towards the nightstand and took the glass of water and downed it gratefully. "Mornin," he said with a husky and deep voice. "Morning to you too. How do you feel". Dean was now facing Cas. "Horrible. I am having the worst headache" he stated before leaning in to give Cas a kiss. Cas broke the kiss pretty fast and looked at Dean, his nose crinkled. "What," the other man asked. "Well I don't want to be rude but you need a shower. Now". "Is it really that bad?" Dean asked. "Yes," Dean groaned as he stood up and exited the room. Cas decided to cook some breakfast even though his cooking wasn't as good as Dean's.
“Dean,” he said, louder this time, startling him so much that his knife fell down.
His brother had done it again. He had humiliated Cas in front of his friend. In front of Dean. Tears were streaming down his face. A soft knock on the door. "Cas it's me. Can I come in?" Dean. He opened the door to let Dean inside, and locked it again. Dean sat down beside him and put his arm around Castiel's shoulders. They were sitting there in silence. Cas felt horrible. He felt so messed up and weak for letting his brother humiliate him, again. "Your brother is an asshole" Dean said breaking the silence. That comment made Cas laugh a little. "Yea he is. I hate him so much, how could he do that to me, again..." Cas trailed off. "What do you mean, again?" Dean asked and Cas realized that he hadn't told Dean about his childhood. The things his brother, and parents, had done but he couldn't tell him. Not yet. He wasn't ready to live through all those memories again. "I don't want to talk about it." "Cas..." Dean began. "Please Dean, I am not ready yet. You have to understand it" Cas said closing his eyes to hold back the tears. It broke his heart to not be able to tell Dean about it but he couldn't. At least not today. They shifted onto Castiel’s bed and just laid there. They started talking eventually and after hours of talking they both fell asleep.
“Hello, can I help you?” The bartender said as they walked inside. Dean walked up to him with a smile.
The date was set to be in one month, at the end of November, which was really fast.  Cas was really happy about this because his life finally was going well, or at least better than before. He was still afraid of showing his scars but he pushed that thought away for the moment.
The years passed and John changed. He became more closed up, not that Dean could blame him after what had happened, he did the same. John started going out at night and coming home drunk, getting more violent and angry.  The day Sam had asked Dean what had happened to their mother, was the first day John became physical. He had interrupted them, it was night and after 3am, and he had seen Sam, and dean, crying. He must have understood what had happened and had slapped Dean across the face for telling Sam.  After that John had started getting physical more often. Dean had always taken the blow. He has had more broken ribs and bruises than he could count but he didn't care, as long as Sammy was safe. John had never touched Sam. Dean would never let that happen. Never. He had made that promise to himself and he was going to keep it.
“You know, Sammykins, when this is over what do you say I take you to a nice bar, get a drink?” Gabe asked with a smirk. Even in the low light, Cas saw the younger Winchester blush and duck his head.
The movie had already begun when they sneaked inside. Their seats were at the back of the theater and they had to sneak in, trying to be as quiet as possible. The first half of the movie went by easy since nothing special had happened. At the scene were Wendy hides in her room and Johnny bursts through the door with the ax, Cas almost jumps in his seat, not expecting this. Dean looks at him a slightly amused smile playing at the corner of his lips. Without thinking Cas reached out and took Dean’s hand, intertwining their fingers, Dean giving him a light squeeze.

“Yeah, Cas?” He asked nervously, unsure if he had done well.
epilogue) and I wanted to say how grateful I am that you're all reading this and commenting.
“What?” Dean asked confused. Cas looked up to him under hooded eyes, suddenly unsure of himself.
Cas had to suppress a smile that started playing at the corners of his mouth. He knew that they would win, there was no way that the jury would let his crazy family go with all the proof they showed and the statements they gave.
“What did he say?” Anna asked almost immediately.
“Mr. Foster, I didn’t give you permission to speak”. His parents' lawyer apologized and stayed quiet until he was asked to speak.
“Well because it was his fault. He had brought this onto our family and he needed to be redeemed in order for him to go to heaven. We only did what God told us to do. Not more and not less.” His father spoke with such confidence in his voice that it made Cas want to throw up.
“Yes,” he admitted, his face still serious. Gabe walked closer, now standing almost in front of their father. He cleared his throat before continuing.
Sorry guys that it took me again so long but I was working on my final draft for the Perfect Pair Bang I am doing.
“Okay, when do we leave?” She asked, standing up.
“Stupid me,” he whined. Cas reached out and interlocked their fingers.
She just nodded before changing something in her computer and then proceeding in handing them their roomkey. The couple entered the room and Castiel stopped dead in his tracks. The room was beautiful. It wasn’t extremely big but he didn’t care about that. His gaze fell onto the big king-sized bed in the middle of the room, which had red sheets surrounded by a gold bed frame. But what caught his attention even more was the view. He slowly walked towards the floor-length window and let out a quiet
Turns out a shower was not what Dean needed. He was standing underneath the hot spray, his thoughts wandering to his best friend, his crush, with his stupid blue eyes and messy hair and that deep voice that sent shivers down Deans’ spine… ‘
“Dean, come on!” Sam said, quickly walking into his room. When they heard the door close, Dean broke out into laughter. Cas punched him playfully in the arm.
The green-eyed boys hands combed through his messy hair, as he pushed his lips harder against Castiel’s. They melted into each other, soft gasps escaping their mouths as they kept on kissing. Cas pulled away slightly, gazing into Dean’s eyes as he let himself get lost in them.
“About the case?” Dean nodded in agreement, his hand rubbing the back of his neck. Sam just rolled his eyes and focused back on his laptop after throwing Dean bitchface number 7.
They cuddled for some time before they fell asleep, both of them exhausted from the fight and the trip. The next days they spent watching TV and doing their essays for university. It was a nice contrast to the last weeks. The first day of university they had to wake up at around 6:30am. Dean made breakfast for them and even a healthier version for Sammy. He was in a good mood, which was probably because John wasn't around. Cas woke up a bit later and after he took a shower and after that put on one of Dean's shirts. He walked downstairs, hair still wet and hugged Dean from behind. He put his head on his shoulder. Dean pressed a kiss against his damp hair and then Dean looked closely at Cas. A smirk spread across his lips.
Castiel could see the rage and anger in his eyes, as Dean turned his head towards his brother again, blood running out of his nose. Dean was about to punch back, when Cas practically threw himself in front of Dean, grabbing his wrist. He looked up at Dean, a pleading look on his face. "Please don't" he said, his voice shaking. Dean glanced at him for a few seconds before lowering his hand. They stayed like this for a few moments, nobody moving. Cas felt the pain only a few moments after the blade entered his lower back. His eyes widened and he dropped to his knees, hand grabbing his stomach. The blade had cut through him completely. He could hear Dean scream his name but it was all so far away. Everything went by in slow motion. He felt strong hand grabbing him and carrying him out the house. The cold wind was great against his flushed skin. He clutched at Dean's shirt. "Cas stay with me come on" Dean was cursing while trying to open the door to the Impala. Cas felt the seat underneath him. He tried to move his head but the moment he did that, everything became blurry. "Cas stay with me please" Dean's voice was filled with pain and Cas knew he was afraid. Castiel should probably be afraid too but he couldn't feel anything right now. He just knew he had to stay with Dean. "Dean..." he croaked. "Cas don't talk just stay with me. Everything will be fine. I promise".
“I know your past was anything but easy. That didn’t prevent you though from becoming such a strong and independent person.
“That’s great Cas. I’m happy for you.” The rest of the short drive they spent talking about their plans for Christmas and New Year’s. Cas would stay at the Winchesters house over the holidays.
“You don’t look bad yourself, Mr. Winchester,” he said back before leaning up kissing Dean.
“What?” he asked back, confused.
“How do you mean?”
Cas let out a heavy sight, finishing his breakfast. He was so worried about Dean and what he could do today. He knew this day was really hard for him but Cas had to at least try and make him feel a little better.
Cas backed away as far as he could hitting the wall with his back. His brother was now towering over him, still breathing heavily from the fight a few moments earlier. "I'm gonna enjoy this little brother" his brother said before punching him in the face. His head was pushed against the wall with the force of the blow but he tried to stand up, legs shaking. Another fist hit him, this time in his stomach, and another and another until he was curled up on the floor, crutching his stomach, every muscle aching."You are an abomination. You know that Castiel. Every time you got beaten up you deserved it. Every time you were lying on the floor or were pushed into lockers, you deserved it. You are nothing. A nobody, a monster and monsters have to get punished, little brother." His brother was kicking him when he suddenly stopped. Cas heard something hit the floor and he opened his eyes. Lucifer was lying on the floor, unconscious, Dean standing over him, with an angry expression. The other man was filled with rage. "Dean?" Cas croaked mouth dry. Dean slowly shifted his gaze away from his brother, now looking at Castiel, his expression changing immediately into concern. He ran towards him falling on his knees. "Hey how are you doing Cas" he asked with a concerned voice. He helped him to sit up, letting him lean against his chest. They stayed like this for a while not moving until Dean broke the silence. "We have to get you cleaned up". They stood up carefully and walked up to the bathroom.
“What?” Dean asked confused but before he could answer, Cas had him pinned against the nearest wall, hands held above his head. Dean’s breath sped up. He loved when Cas got all rough with him. His angel let his lips ghost over his before he kissed to the soft spot behind his ear, letting his breath caress Dean’s skin before he whispered into his ear.
"I love you," he exclaimed out. His face got red, so he looked over at the wall. "I love you." He repeated. "Cas, I need to know that you're ok with what I'm trying to do here." Dean finished nervously. The angel nodded.
“Shut up.” He grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Hey,” he said back, both smiling goofily. The officiant started speaking, addressing the room. She went through the formal things pretty quickly and soon it was time for the vows.
“I wish. The one we did about a month ago at that bar? More people have died.” He explained with a frown.
“You are beautiful,” Dean mumbled against his lips, making Cas grin.
An hour later they were on their way to the supermarket. Cas was riding shotgun and Sam in the back. Dean was in a really good mood and his brother must have noticed as well since he didn’t complain about listening to Metallica so early in the morning.
it. Only that thought made Cas sick to his stomach. He turned his gaze away from his older brother and made his way home.
“Alright, little bro. I’ll go and check out this huge bunker. See ya.” He said and then left, leaving Cas to his own thoughts.
“Yea?”
Cas did his best to keep them away from Dean, not wanting them to hurt Dean but one of them must have passed him because when he looked back at Dean, he was standing and glaring at Cas.
“Dean?” He said but he had already drawn his gun, ready to fight. Cas straightened as well, slipping his angel blade into his hand. The lights flickered more before they turned off completely, the only light in the room coming from a streetlight outside. Thankfully Cas was able to see in the dark and moved closer to Dean, partly on instinct and partly because he wouldn’t let anybody hurt him.
They were asked to come back inside so that the jury could tell them what they decided. Cas opened his eyes again slowly, letting out a long sight before following the others inside again.
“For what?” he asked and Dean took his hand intertwining their fingers.
“Hello, Mr. Novak. I hope you’re having a great first day at Kansas High,” he greeted to which Cas just nodded, “anyway I wanted to tell you some of the school’s rules since you probably don’t know them.” Cas looked at him with furrowed brows. He didn’t like where this conversation was going.
“Well, I was hoping it would happen,” he admitted with a sheepish grin. He settled between Castiel’s legs again, opening the bottle and squeezing a generous amount onto his fingers before circling Castiel’s entrance.
The confidence on his brother's face was now even more visible and Cas had to say that he was more than impressed with Gabriel’s skills as a lawyer. For a moment his family’s lawyer didn’t seem to have an answer or at least he didn't know what to say next.
Cas felt the blunt pressure of Dean’s dick push into him and despite the slight pain he felt, his body instantly relaxed and he let himself get lost in the pleasures Dean was causing him.  Dean let out a deep groan when he was buried inside of Cas and after a few moments of adjustment he slowly started moving his hips shallowly. He moved out and pushed in, almost painfully slow. Castiel’s legs were shaking and Cas let out moans and curses with every thrust. He pushed his hips back, meeting Dean who was making the same pleasurable noises.
Some people are jerks,
"Didn't you tell me that your brother Gabriel was a lawyer?" Dean asked.
“Dean?” Cas whispered blue eyes fixed on him. Dean cleared his throat.
“Yes.” She motioned for him to walk towards her before walking to the side herself.
“So that’s why you didn’t want to tell me?” Cas asked happily.
“I’m awake,” he said his voice rough from sleep.
Just some normal days...
“For everything. For being there for me and helping me get through all of this,” he admitted in a husky and slightly slurred voice. Instead of answering Dean just pressed a kiss to Castiel’s lips before pulling away mumbling I love you against his lips. Dean had fallen asleep, his breath calm and even. Cas was sleepy himself but before he fell asleep he whispered I love you too into the silence.
“Really? Because I don’t know much about cars,”
“Oh come on. That man is the embodiment of bisexuality.” Gabe said but Cas shook his head.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asked after a while, eyes trained on their hands.
“You must be Mr. Novak. I’m Mrs. Tapping,” she said.
“Dean, I fell in love with you the moment I saw you, almost six and a half years ago. I never thought that I would even talk to you but then you made the first move. I still remember the shy smile on your lips. A few weeks later, and after already going through a lot, we were together. You were there when nobody else was and everything in my life was falling apart. You helped me grow and put the pieces of my broken soul back together. Each day that passes, I love you more. You make me feel whole again, like our souls were meant to be together. We have both been through a lot in our lives but I promise you Dean Winchester that I’ll always be there for you, no matter what because I love you and I can’t imagine sharing the rest of my life with anybody else,” Cas concluded. Tears were running down Dean’s face, a gorgeous smile on his lips as he wiped away the wet dots on his cheeks.
“I’m sorry” he repeated, turning his head towards Dean again.
They were lying in bed, arms wrapped around each other, both still not wearing a shirt.
“Hey, you alright?” Dean asked a little concerned.
“This tastes like molecules but like, very sweet ones. I like it.” Cas said with a happy sigh and Dean had to roll his eyes up in an attempt to not just kiss that sweet smile right then and there.
“Why?” was the only thing Dean asked.
I will
“Who knew we could have had this months, hell, maybe years ago.” He commented. “We really are dumbasses.”
"We don't have to I mean we could watch something else." Dean was so unsure of himself, it was kind of cute.
“Cas I’m so fucking sorry. I didn’t mean to…” he trailed off not looking at Cas.
Even though Cas had been together with a few guys, it was never special. He never felt like he could trust them or they tried to rush him into things he wasn’t ready yet but Dean, Dean was different. He never pressured Cas into doing anything he didn’t want to and when he saw that he was uncomfortable he stopped immediately. Cas still couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have Dean as his boyfriend.
“Hm? Yes, yes I’m okay. What happened?” He asked confused, green eyes locked with Cas.
,” the green-eyed boys said suggestively.
The moment Dean had walked into the room that evening, Cas knew this would be a long night. He looked beautiful and the red of his shirt was accentuating his emerald green eyes. Almost two hours later and Cas was right. He was sitting opposite of Dean and he could barely control the urge to kiss him. He knew he couldn’t though; not only because they were on a case but also because Dean was not into him.
with this ring, I thee wed.”
Thanks to my Beta E. you're really awesomme
A hand on his back, broke his train of thought, bringing him back to reality.
“Dean what is going on?” he asked but he got no response. Castiel carefully put his finger under Dean’s chin, lifting it and forcing him to look Castiel in the eyes, even though he still tried to avoid his gaze.
“Dean… hmm… shouldn’t we get back to eating?” Cas asked once he pulled away. Dean was grinning like an idiot but shook his head.
“Dean, stop,” Cas said a little louder this time but his boyfriend just continued to kiss his neck and pulling up his shirt until it was almost revealing his entire torso.
"I don't think that you and my client should talk face to face anymore. Everything you want to say will be over your lawyers and I also think that my client doesn't feel safe in your presence anymore. Isn't that right?" he asked, shooting a glance at Cas who just nodded. They turned around and walked away. Cas was searching for Dean's hand again. As they were leaving they heard Lucifer say
“Hey Castiel,” his brother began, “I have to tell you something.” Castiel’s heart started beating faster, nervous about what his brother would say next.
When he entered the classroom, it was packed with students sitting on tables and chairs, talking to each other. Anna wasn't in his class, which forced his to sit alone. The lesson passed quickly, as they learned about some of the greatest writers in history. The rest of the day went by quickly and after school, he decided to go to the coffeshop across the library, get a coffee and then study in the library, since he had already two assignments which were due this Friday. He ordered a cappuccino and made his way to the library.
"You aren't going to call anyone because if you do, you'll get locked up and you know that," Dean said, trying to take control again.
“Sammy will stay with Bobby and Ellen,” Dean added.
"I guess I'll get that one," he declared as he set his newspaper down.
The hunter unscrewed the bottle and filled a third of the glass. He looked into the alcohol. The color reminded him of honey. Honey. Cas liked honey... He shook his head quickly. He didn't want to be all emotional in public. He downed the liquid. It left his throat feeling warm. He filled his glass the same as before but waited before drinking it. He looked around the bar, observing all the men that stood around with their friends, girlfriends, or just by themselves. There was a man hunched over the jukebox. He had an average build. His hair was sable. He looked like Cas. Dean waited for him to turn around, eager to see if it was him. Butterflies flew all around his stomach, but the feeling stopped when the man turned around. He had scruff and chocolate brown eyes. Dean felt like an idiot, even if it was Cas, what could he do? It's not like he could walk up to him and say sorry. He turned back to his drink then froze. He didn't know why but he just froze. A tear rolled down his cheek. He blinked rapidly, then swilled his drink. He repeated, filling his glass then drinking over and over until less than half the bottle was left. Dean stopped himself. He pulled out his wallet and just slapped a random amount of money on the counter. He didn't care anymore. They could all his money. He slowly exited the bar and made it to his car. The hunter pulled out of the parking lot sloppily and swerved down the road.
"You know," Meg leaned over her car door to look at Cas, "I outta tell your boss you're his best employee, so he knocks that off," she huffed. She pulled a strand of her blonde hair away from her face.
Cas could feel Dean's hot breath. He tried looking him in the eye, to understand what he was feeling, but he couldn't. In his head, he was drowning in shame and regret, and looking Dean in the eye would worsen the suffocating feeling.
"But I think I know. I think I know now. Happiness, isn't in the having. It's in just being. It's in just saying it." A tiny smile had appeared on Castiel's lips.
He told her everything that had happened and when he finished she said "you have to send him a message"
"Well, he told me to keep you safe and to take care of you". Cas smiled at that too and leaned forward, kissing Dean once, before Dean turned back and started the engine.
He thought about it for a minute. Why did his hours keep getting cut? At this rate, it would be tough for him to continue living on his own. Then it hit him.
"Yeah," the man shrugged, "I saw you behind the bar this afternoon. Holding that other guy's hand, I saw the way you were looking at him too. Fucking disgusting."
"Oh..." He looked at his hands.
There he was, all alone. He had to look around the room to make sure if it was true. His breathing became labored, and his vision began to blur. Tears streamed down his face. He couldn't believe that just happened. He looked to his left, and out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of the bloody handprint Cas had left. It was just like the scar he had left when he pulled him out of Hell. He placed his right hand on the blood. He squeezed it harshly, so much so that it began to hurt. He wanted to yell or hit something, or just, he had to do something. He needed to do something, but there was nothing he could do.
Hearing those words come out of Dean's mouth made Castiel realize that the two of them would not leave that room alive. He realized at that moment that only one thing could be done, and he realized now was the time to tell Dean everything. Before making the ultimate sacrifice to save everyone.
Dean finished up his conversation. Jody said her goodbyes and hung up. With a sigh, Dean sat down on his bed. He ran his fingers along the arch of his nose. Still no idea on the whole fallen angel situation. All Jody had come up with were people who had tried to kill locals, claiming they were angels. Other than that, nothing. Dean fell back onto the bed he stared at the ceiling. He was observing the cracks and water stains. Dean's bedroom door creaked open, revealing Castiel. A fallen angel. Without looking up, Dean gestured for the angel to close the door and come closer. Cas sat next to Dean. He played with his messy hair.
Dean woke up, fully clothed, on his bed. He looked over to his nightstand and caught sight of a half-drunken bottle of beer. He shook his head in disappointment as he got up to take a shower. He peeled his jacket and flannel off and tossed them onto the floor. He kicked his boots off, then his pants. After he took off his socks, he walked over to his dresser to grab a pair of sweats. Not long after, he tiptoed over to the bathroom and took the rest of his clothing off, and set them on the toilet.
"No reason," he answered in what he thought was a normal tone. Before Inias could say anything else, another car pulled up for gas.
She was furious, and Castiel felt small in front of her.
"Oh, I think I can handle myself," Dean looked down at his hands, "thank you, though." He began to walk away.
Castiel stood close to Naomi's desk.
"Is that really you?" Dean touched his forehead to the angel's.
"Yep." Dean was tying his apron.
"The price was my life," Cas finally was able to bring himself to look Dean in the eyes again.
"When Jack was dying, I... I made a deal to save him."
Cas inhaled sharply.
"But there is," the angel began. He faced Dean so he could really get a good look at him. "There's one thing she's afraid of. There's one thing... strong enough to stop her." This was it, time to come clean. Castiel avoided looking at Dean head-on because he knew the tears in the hunter's eyes would make him emotional. He needed to keep his strong suit on to be able to say what he needed to say.
"Dean..." Dean planted a soft kiss on his mouth. Subconsciously, he pulled away, a little quickly.
"Dean," Sam revealed himself from behind the door. "You should get up and start moving around. I think," the younger Winchester saw that his brother had not moved once. " I know what you're thinking about. That's not healthy. I know it hard, but you need to get over him. This is killing you." Dean hummed at the statement.
"Come back here, you shit!" Dean tried to yell, but the pain made his voice weak. He looked down, and all color immediately drained from his face. Something was sticking out of his lower right side. He snapped his head forward, trying to deny what he just saw. "Oh God," he reached his hand down to touch his wound. It stung fiercely.
Dean stared at the ceiling in his bedroom. He had been laying, fully clothed, on his bed for hours. He would sleep, but every time he closed his eyes, his longing for Castiel grew. Dean just needed him back. He'd quit the life and be there for him. There was a knock at his door, he didn't move.
His face was met with the warm touch of an angel. No. Of Cas. His eyes opened, and he could see clearly. His vision was no longer blurred by the blood that had got in his eyes. His arm felt like it had never been broken. His face didn't feel sore, and that tooth that was knocked loose sat tight and comfortably in the back of his mouth. He looked up at Cas.
Dean had a decision to make; Runaway to safety, or fight. His body didn't allow him time to think because the next thing he knew was that he was right in front of the other guy again, and he was swinging.
"Why you talking to yourself?" Inias questioned from behind his newspaper.
But he had to.
Dean turned his attention behind him. A man was making his way toward him.
"She's putting me on some medicine Sammy..." Dean fell into his brother's hug and cried silently. Sam reassured his brother that everything would be ok.
Castiel had always hoped that, when he finally did share his secret, he'd have a happy ending. That Dean would feel the same and that he could be happy. Happy with no consequences, happy with only more happiness to follow. But it became clear to the angel that he would never get that, so he at least had to tell Dean now so that he knew.
"Cas is gonna be so mad." He shivered at the gust of wind that had come his way.
"Absolutely," he patted her arm, "now if you'll excuse me, you're keeping me from my work." He stepped out of the breakroom. She rolled her eyes then followed him out.
The other man's face was horrorstruck. He stood still, staring at Dean, and what he had just done to him.
"Thank you, Pam," he kissed her on the cheek, "you're the best!" Dean practically ran out of the bar. A dumb smile occupied his face the entire time.
"Fucking faggot!" The man grabbed a handful of Dean's shirt for better grip, then socked him in the jaw. There was a pop in his hand.
"I know, I know how you see yourself, Dean." Tears began to well up in Castiel's eyes. He could feel that armor he had trapped himself in, slowly breaking away. He caught Dean's eyes staring right at him. He could not register what the hunter was thinking. "I know you see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive, and you're angry, and you're broken, and you're... you're daddy's blunt instrument. And you think that hate and anger, that's what drives you, that's who you are." It was clear that Cas had struck a nerve. It was easy to tell when Dean tensed at his words.
He got ready to slam it down into Dean, then:
"So," Kara began. "I'm free tomorrow. You wanna go grab some coffee or something?" Shocked at the offer, Dean nodded hesitantly.
"What can I get ya?" He asked enthusiastically. Dean looked up at him grimly, which alerted the man that he needed to get him something strong. He walked away. Dean stared at his ass the entire way. When the man came back, he had a bottle of Jameson in one hand and a glass with ice in another. He gave Dean a wink as he left the bottle.
. So Dean knocking him into some nearby crates, it came as a shock to him.
Cas's stomach churned and a picture of Dean flashed in his head. He did a 180 and sprinted back to the scene. He shoved his way through the small crowd, he could feel his heartbeat pounding in his ears. He felt lightheaded
"Hell no, I do not," her smile dissolved a second later, and was replaced with a worried look, "I don't know how you can talk about it so freely. What if someone hears you, huh?" He just shrugged.
"I love you."
It was funny to him, he was laying there in the freezing snow and he couldn't feel a thing. He didn't feel cold or anything. Dean tried to laugh, but instead it was a wet cough. Guess he didn't need his jacket anymore if he wasn't even cold. He tasted the coppery flavor of blood, then his vision began to fade.
Dean stopped dead in his tracks.
"Really?" She cackled. "You're late almost every day of the week, and you wanna get off early?"
He smiled and nodded his head. Dean threw his apron through the doorway of the breakroom.
Dean swam through all of the memories in his head, trying his best to avoid anything involving Castiel. He searched for something good to think about. His life with Lisa Braeden all those years ago, but he had to let her go when his life became a danger to her and Ben. It became challenging to find anything suitable, the only good thing in Dean's life. Before he knew it, he was thrown into a memory that he wished he could forget. It was something so simple, but it was a moment where Dean loved him with every fiber of his body.
"Cas? What's going on?" Dean got up, leaving his beverage dripping lightly onto the floor. He stepped towards his boyfriend and tried to grab his hand. Castiel pulled away. He let out a shaky breath.
Cas reluctantly backed away from the door. A heavy sigh escaped from his mouth. After catching his breath, he turned his attention back onto Dean, who looked like his whole world had shattered around him.
"Cas..."
"Don't worry about it, babe." She put her sunglasses back on. "On another note, one of these days we gotta go out to dinner."
"Why does this sound like a 'Goodbye'?" Dean asked almost silently. His face was blank. So many emotions had gone through his mind that he didn't know what to do.
Dean shuffled down the street with his hands in his pockets. It was cold—usual Kansas weather for this time of year. The wind blew in small gusts, pulling the leaves on the street onto the sidewalk. Dean always thought Autumn had its beauty as opposed to the rest of other seasons. He walked into the market that sat on the corner of the streets that divided the town. It was almost empty. Only the employees populated the lot.
"Don't do this, Cas..."
"Oh, right," Cas sighed. He let his shoulders fall back down. "Well, maybe, yeah."
The stone fell and cracked open. A storm was unleashed outside. Thunder and lightning so loud that it was almost as if they were in the very room.
"Oh God," he mouthed thoughtlessly. His legs were trembling. He felt like he was going to collapse. Cas used all his strength, emotionally and physically, to remove himself from the crime scene and walk home.
Cas breathed heavily, observing the mess he made. That's when he saw it, the stereo. For some reason, all of that hot anger just faded away. Without thinking, he began to move. He dragged his feet behind one another as he walked over to it.
Dean grabbed the collar of the trench coat and pulled Castiel into a long, passionate kiss. He felt complete again. He tasted the sweetness of his angel for the first time in a long time, along with their salty tears. When they both pulled back for air, Castiel gazed into his love's eyes, looking confused.
Cas stared back at him. His lips were pressed into a thin line, and he stared at Dean more closely than he ever had before. Dean cupped his face and gave a weak smile.
What if he and Dean moved in together. His heart raced at the thought, two men living together. That would be very suspicious. Yet somewhere inside of Castiel, it felt right. Getting to live with the man he... He cared very much for Dean.
"Oh," She rested her hands on his. "I'm sorry, sweetie. If I had a nickel for every time, that girl led men here and stood them up." Dean's smile was wiped off his face.
Dean stared into the sky, blinking lightly whenever snow threatened to get in his eyes. Tears made his eyes swell, and his vision began to blur.
After attending his first AA meeting, just as his Doctor recommended, Dean sat in the cheap fold-up chair and examined his wrists. They were raw, so much so that there were scabs from previous bleeding. Whenever he thought about Cas, he would feel that he was just a toxic stain in the world. He'd scratch his wrists without even knowing. The counselor who ran the meetings walked up to Dean and handed him a signed piece of paper. His Doctor needed proof that he was there. After he got his paper, Dean got up and went to his car. Dean opened the visor on the driver's side to put the form there so he wouldn't lose it, but he caught sight of a picture that made his healing heartbreak again. It was a picture of Cas looking up at the stars from the grass at a park. His soft smile and the way he was sitting, he was so happy that Dean could see the faint crow's feet in the creases of his eyes. The ex-hunter sighed sadly.
Castiel wiped his blade on the interior of his trench coat. He slid it back into the pocket where it was stored. He caught Dean's eyes. The two stared back at one another. It had been so long since they've seen each other face to face. Dean swallowed harshly, he needed to get out of there fast, yet before he could move, Castiel was already starting to turn around to leave. Every instinct in the Winchester's body told him to let him walk away. He grabbed the angel's arm.
When the morning came, he moped around the bunker, not bothering to change out of his t-shirt and boxers. He didn't go anywhere, so there was no point. Sam didn't say anything about it at this point. It just became a regular thing. It made the younger Winchester miserable to see his brother like this. This wasn't Dean. It was an empty shell of him. He thought that he and Cas would always be together. He never saw this coming. After everything the angel and the elder hunter had been through together, Sam just thought that there was nothing that could break them apart.
