“Don’t worry Sherlock,” Moriarty soothed. “The antidote is right in front of John. At the end of the room near the door. John simply has to walk to the other end of the room and retrieve it. Simple. No real rules. Just get to the syringes.”
"I don't need to weight anything, Sherlock," John said, controlling his tone with an effort. "If there is any chance of getting function back, I'm taking it."
Sherlock tried to concentrate what he had seen of John before he had collapsed to determine if he... If he was...
It couldn't be. John didn't dare to hope as he slowly lifted his head. The movement caused him to become dizzy and disoriented, but he ignored this as he concentrated on following Sherlock's gaze.
“Yes, Sherlock,” Moriarty said beside him. “I’m quite sure it will all be okay. It is perfectly possible for both of you to win this game and walk away. Of course, he is wrong about one thing. It is your fault.”
He tried to remember the times John had corrected him on his lack of tact. It typically occurred after he'd made an indiscreet comment or reacted inappropriately.
“Sherlock Holmes?” the inspector studied Sherlock. “And to what do we owe this pleasure. I wouldn’t think this case, strange as it may be, would be something to bring you all the way down here from London.”
"Yeah," John said just as another small explosion sounded from the kitchen. "I'll go get him. Come in."
“The nerve damage,” Sherlock prompted. “Will John have control over his lower body? His eliminatory functions? His reproductive organs? Will he be able to walk?”
Sherlock leaned around Moriarty, trying to watch John. He was still breathing, though he was also moaning softly. Thankfully, he seemed not to notice Sebastian’s hand.
"John," he said, keeping his voice as neutral as he could manage, "I simply thought you might want to take some time to consider.."
"John," Sherlock looked like he was forcing himself to maintain eye contact as he spoke, "how does your leg feel?"
As soon as he had gone deep enough, Sherlock took the other item next to him. He had already taken the pen apart, leaving a small tube. Sherlock, praying the pen tube did not cause an infection, pushed the tube into John’s chest.
By the time Sherlock returned, however, John was quite distracted and had forgotten all about the door. In his efforts to organize Sherlock's piles of files and papers and books, he had come across several items that appeared to be spells, many of which looked to have been written by Sherlock himself. He was perusing them with great interest when Sherlock interrupted him.
Before Lestrade could move a step closer to him, however, a shot rang out and Jacol fell forward, blood gushing from his chest.
"Er, yes," Molly mumbled, glancing down at the file in her hands. "I'm afraid I didn't find much though."
Ever since they had fought over the surgery, they had spoken little. John had signed the consent forms as soon as a nurse returned with them a few hours later and then refused point blank to discuss it further with Sherlock.
Sherlock hesitated, but then growled in frustration and ran back to John, who tucked his cane into his trousers and moved to the unconscious man.
"Dr. Ramar and Dr. Pakash are very good at what they do," he said and Sherlock's heart sank. "I have never seen them make a bad call."
"S-sorry," Molly stammered, recovering herself just short of falling. "I just wanted to check on how John was doing."
Before them, a small hole led into the ground. Sherlock, looked over John’s shoulder at the entrance. They looked at one another.
. Sherlock thought through what he had just done. What had gone wrong? What was happening to John? Had he not wanted this after all?
Surprised, Sherlock backed up a step, nodded once, then turned on his heels and walked briskly out of the room.
"Sherlock," John croaked, his throat protesting the effort and making his voice sound distant and odd. "Sherlock it's okay. You didn't have any choice."
The two men stared at one another for a long moment. Sebastian waited, growing impatient at whatever was keeping Sherlock from beginning already.
John’s eyebrow’s knitted together, as though he had no idea where they were or what they were doing.
"Good," Dr. Azarian smiled and looked down at his chart. "I've just met with your team and I've finally got some news for you, of a sort."
"Either we are dealing with a very careful vampire," Sherlock said, "or a very clever serial killer."
In the short time it took for him to reach John, his mind raced. A fall from nine meters was roughly three stores. The damage caused by a fall is due to the absorbed energy at impact, explained by the equation E=mv2. From this height, E would equal roughly 7553 Joules. The max velocity would be roughly 14.7 m/s. That would make the average injury severity score 18. All of which meant that, depending on where the bullet hit him, John would mostly likely still be alive, though injured.
Molly waited a moment, clearly checking that Sherlock was finished before she responded. But Sherlock had run himself out and now sat glaring at the ugly tile at his feet.
No sooner had he spoken than he turned and saw a stick poking out of a nearby bush. Marveling at his good fortune (and eerily good timing), he made his way to the stick and examined it. It appeared to be the perfect width for a cane and looked quite sturdy.
“I’m in shock,” John started. “Likely neurogenic from pain and probably hypovolemic from blood loss. If shock isn’t treated promptly, it can lead to death. We are out in the middle of nowhere. Nobody knows we’re here, much less that we’re in trouble. By the time you get out of the graves and get somebody out here… I likely won’t make it that long.”
“No,” Sherlock said, appreciating that they were apparently going to get right to the point. “That’s actually why I’m here.”
He nodded brusquely and followed her to yet another uncomfortable, plastic chair. She sat next to him, but didn't speak. She simply waited, watching him as he collected his jumbled thoughts and tried to reign in his frustration.
“Well,” Alec turned to Sherlock and John, who had finally reached the door, “very nice meeting you both.”
Looking around, he could see dust and minuscule debris floating around him, so he couldn’t have been out for long. Something on the edge of his consciousness was demanding attention, but he couldn’t quite catch the thought. Something was wrong, but what?
Inside, he found cushioned seats, almost like armchairs, and strange straps. He stared around him as Sherlock said something to the driver, who was sitting inside the strange carriage as well.
“I see you recognize our little present,” Moriarty croons. “We thought a little nostalgia was in order for this next test.”
Sherlock winced. Whatever this man’s idea of a big finale was wouldn’t be pleasant. But they would have to cross that bridge when they got there. For now…
“I’m not letting you do this alone,” John said stubbornly. “You promised me, remember. You said neither of us would have to be alone again. I haven’t forgotten.”
"What you said,” John explained patiently. “What you just said. Were you lying or was that actually the truth?
He moves to the bed and begins chaining John’s limbs. John flinches at his touch but remains silent.
Sherlock watched as John pushed his food around on his plate. He hadn’t eaten much, but he had eaten something, at least. That was a start.
The books covered topics ranging from anatomy to history, though only a particular kind of history that dealt, primarily, with crime, he noticed. There were several books containing odd formulas and strange letter and number combinations that John could not interpret. He assumed it was a strange foreign language or books of spells.
"Now run!" the stranger said and took off, gliding through mid air with John's hand clasped firmly in his own.
Sherlock smiles too, going back to his paper. He had thought it the right time for a call from the Major. John would obviously be happy to hear from the man anytime, but Sherlock calculated that John had now gotten enough distance from the Graves and from his reaction to really benefit from the call. That’s why he made a well-placed inquiry about the Major with his brother and hinted that a call might be in order.
John opened his mouth and shut it again. He didn't know what to say. Vaguely, he realized that Sherlock was talking to him, but he could only manage to focus enough to catch snippets of what he was saying.
John comes in and out of consciousness for several days but is not yet coherent enough to talk yet. Sherlock stays with him in his room, making sure he is there every time John wakes up.
“Sir,” one of the paramedics turned to him, “I’m afraid you can’t. But we’ll take you to the same hospital immediately.”
John drank gratefully, though the water burned going down. Somewhere in the back of his mind a small voice murmured something about ventilators. He ignored it.
Sherlock did not resist. He allowed his body to move into John’s, careful to avoid his many and sundry injuries. John’s form pressed against his own was intoxicating. His hand were now wrapped around Sherlock’s back, holding him close. Sherlock realized suddenly he had taken hold of John’s hair and was pressing his face closer. Meanwhile, John’s tongue continued to work its magic, gently guiding Sherlock’s tongue and exploring his mouth.
He lay with his eyes closed for several long minutes, breathing as well as he could manage through the pain and trying to remember why he had been sedated.
“John,” Sherlock said loudly. “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry, but you have to get up. You have to try the second one. Do it. Do it now!”
John, still trying to pry his eyes open, heard distant voices. He tried to listen to what they were saying, but they sounded far away and distorted, as though he were hearing them from under water. He gave up the effort and concentrated instead on opening his eyes.
“Me?” Moriarty exclaims. “Nothing at all. Sebastian, on the other hand… Don’t worry. He won’t hurt John unless you choose option one. Otherwise, well… He’s just going to have his little fun. Again.”
Sherlock quickly tied the scarf around John’s shoulder, then, taking his belt off, tied that around the wrapping for extra pressure.
“Because given your tone,” Mycroft said, “you aren’t looking for information. You’re looking for revenge.”
Sherlock was off before she could ask any questions. He reached the ICU and sprinted down the hall, nurses calling after him to stop running. He ignored them. He sped past rooms that were obviously not John’s until he came to a hall that looked promising. He began peering into each door. Finally, about halfway down the hall he found him.
“But how am I supposed to know which is which?” Sherlock yells. “I’m not a doctor. John should make the decision.”
John glared at the fire, trying not to be annoyed. He was just contemplating trying to find a kettle when the door burst open again. Sherlock moved slowly into the room.
"Well," Lestrade said, pulling out chains and grinning at Jacol, "we've got plenty of time to figure that out now, don't we."
“Fine,” Lestrade said, “but I could help you know. If this Moran has a criminal record, I might be able to find him.”
"What can it hurt to just let us have a look?" John asked. "It isn't like we're going to disturb evidence. You said yourself that your examiners have already taken their look."
John rolled his eyes and, very carefully, squatted down next to the body, gingerly moving his leg so that it was out of the way. He looked closely at the woman's face. He couldn't smell alcohol and he saw no signs of asphyxiation. He looked at her neck, but again saw no marks. She was pale and stiff, but otherwise showed no obvious signs of trauma.
"Sir," Dr. Pakash, a balding man who looked to be in his late sixties, spoke in a soft voice that might have been suited to bedtime stories, "I know this is a difficult time and a difficult decision, but it really is the best thing you can do for Dr. Watson. The risks of avoiding amputation vastly outweigh the benefits in this case. Believe me when I say that we avoid this outcome whenever possible, but in this case it is simply the most advisable intervention."
They arrived back at the door to the house after only a few short minutes. Sherlock opened the door and waited for John to go through, still staring at him as though afraid he would collapse at any moment. John felt shaky, but he wasn't entirely sure it was from the Witch. He could still feel Sherlock's arm around his waist -- the pressure and the warmth and the feeling of security.
He sank back further in the chair, still relishing the warmth of the fire, though it being alive was a bit disorienting. He felt himself drifting and didn't resist. He would have a lot of work to do, very soon.
Well, that explained why his chest felt like it was on fire and his throat felt as though it had been gone over with a lawn mower. Some wild part of him wanted to laugh. It was all so fitting. Of course this had happened. Everything else had gone wrong--why wouldn't his last hope?
When he opened his eyes, he saw the stranger grinning at him, floating beside him in mid air. John's eyes widened as he looked down and saw the ground so far below his own floating feet. He glanced back up at the grinning face, struck dumb.
"Wait," John blinked at him as Amelia moved around the room, examining it closely. "So you believe her now?"
"The engraving," John said, turning the watch over in his hand and running his finger over Harry's name. "How did you know we don't get along?"
"What the..." John pushed himself up on his elbow, just as the ship lurched again to the other side.
John Watson. I have a simple question for you. Answer it truthfully and you two are free to go. Lie, and I will shoot you both.”
“Shock keeps you fairly well away from the pain,” John said, “so not much. If we make it to a hospital, they’ll keep me on some pretty strong pain killers.”
John stared. The demon's voice, unlike what he would have expected from such a creature, was high and lilting, almost like an old woman.
“Oh him,” Moriarty said dismissively. “You’re not still mad about that are you? Seb just wanted to have a little fun. And he’s such a good pet, I thought I’d reward him.”
Sherlock’s stomach drops. John has been shot in his pelvis. The bullet entered his pelvic region to the right of his genitals and to the left of his hip.
“You’ve found him,” Lestrade said. “And you think you’re going to run off after him yourself. Well, you’ve lost your mind. No way I’m letting you go off after those two by yourself.”
When the star hit the ground, it flickered for just a moment, looking relieved. Then it went out completely and faded into the ground. John felt his heart clench for a moment, but he felt relieved as well. The star had looked so scared.
"John!" Sherlock rushed over to crouch over him and John tried to push him away, but found he was shaking. "Are you okay? Can you walk?"
“He’s in no shape to play games,” Sherlock couldn’t keep the pleading from his voice. “Look at him.”
After their first case together, things started to improve. They had exchanged cell phone numbers and had had longer conversations by text than any other time face to face. They kept meeting each other from time to time walking out or into the building. Sherlock had by then memorise John’s daily habits but didn’t want to seem like a stalker so he tried not to meet him too often or look suspicious. They also had met for coffee a couple times.
“I’m not packing for you.” John said determined, turning around to pick up some more clothes. What should one wear in Ireland? It was just like England, in one day you can have the four seasons. He didn’t want to overpack though, they were going for only one week.
John took a look at his phone, the picture was blurry, the light wasn’t very good and the angle was terrible, his head was half cut off since he was standing beside a sitting sherlock.
John was confused as to why Sherlock had kept and pinned this photograph on his wall when he had spent hours ranting about how much he hated it. So why would he decide to keep it ? John let it go as soon as he found his laptop on Sherlock’s bed and exited the room.
One thing he wasn't expecting was that it was all pictures of the two of them. Some pictures that he didn’t even remember taking. One thing that was present in all of them was happiness. They looked happy in all of them. That brought up a sad smile to John’s face. He caressed the photos with his finger as he remebered the past, a life with Sherlock in it.
Later that night when they were both sound asleep they were woken up by the water that had risen during the night, wetting almost all their belongings. In a hurry, they took their stuff, their sleeping bags and tent and ran till their cottage who thankfully was near by. The situation might have seemed bad but they could stop laughing all the way back to the cottage, probably due to the adrenaline.
John has been over-stressed for the last few days. Sherlock had assumed it was because of his work at the clinic, or because of their cases but that was not it. It looked like John was hiding something from him, or at least trying.
It was beautiful, John couldn’t help but take a thousand picture of the same mountains, which annoyed extremely his partner which had to wait for him to take the pictures every 5 seconds.
“Since Baskeville right? Anyway thanks for organising this trip. I know how much you hate leaving London for less than a 7, and this is clearly a minus 10 in your scale,” John joked, bringing his glass of wine to his lips.
John sighed and suppress the urge to roll his eyes. He walked over the genius and took the phone out. It was a text message from Mycroft.
“I can clearly see that.” He said eyeing Sherlock’s figure. Sherlock furrowed his brows. “You’re stick and bones, not an ounce of fat on you, I can’t even understand how you are able to stand without breaking a bone.”
That’s how they spent their morning, kissing and giggling in bed, enjoying each other’s company while eating breakfast.
“Because I want to surprise you.” He said kissing his soon to be fiancé. “and because it's my punishment for you ruining my proposal and making me believe you were cheating on me.”
“I see, flirting you mean?” Sherlock did the same and stroke delicately John’s jaw and dropped a small chaste kiss, to make the pain go away.
“What? No, we’re just talking. Can’t a man and a woman talk without the assumption they are flirting?”
This picture was for John, he told himself. He looked toward the camera that his mom was holding and made the brightest smile he could while embracing his new best friend.They had funny triangle birthday party hats on their head, Sherlock’s father had compelled all of them to wear one, even Mycroft. John was holding on his other hand a piece of cake smiling with a few teeth missing.
“Yeah, well, too bad because I’m only into you, now shut up and give me my ice cream before it melts.”John said grabbing his ice cream from Sherlock’s hands, a bit pissed by his reaction.
“Because…” Sherlock was at lost for words. “I had to keep you safe, here.” He squeezed John’s leg as if checking this was real.
However, they finally managed to the top without a scratch and enjoyed the view from above and decided to sit a little bit below on a big rock. There were a few water poodles around and along the climb, where the stream would gather before falling down. At some point, they stopped and sat down on some rocks and dipped their feet into the cold water, while talking and holding hands.
“John, what do you think of this, for Lestrade?” Sherlock asked, showing a imitation of a car number plate but instead of number it was the name Gavin.
He looked around and saw a volley ball near by, soon enough a small woman, in her mid thirties, long hezlnut hair that was tied in a pony tail, came up to him, looking very sorry. She was wearing a sport top and white shorts.
Lestrade stood there, out of breath, his coat soaked from the pouring rain outside, pleading for his help.
John wanted to protest but hadn’t the patience right now, so he did as he was instructed to. He then came back to the home screen. He never realized that Sherlock’s phone background was a photo of them back in the day, at Uni. John remembered that day as he almost had to beg on his knees for Sherlock allow him to take a selfie with him.
“I know but we barely have any pictures together and we have known each other since primary school. Come on Sherlock.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but couldn’t help to smiled stupidly at the possibilities behind John’s words.
“Fine, just one.” Sherlock took out his cell phone from beside his computer and snapped a quick picture of him and John and sent it to him. The photo was taken so quickly that John had barely the time to blink, even less to pose. “There, done. Can I please go back to work, now?” It was more a statement than a question since Sherlock had already his full attention on his computer.
John, all sweaty, blond hair a mess. His black striped yellow shirt that had seen better days, muddy and torn.
“Well we will have to change that, would be a shame if your lovely skin got sunburnt on the first day out in the sun.” John said, a hand reaching back to squeezing Sherlock’s tight in a teasing way.
John smiled triumphally and start to pack what they would need for their night out. This was going to be fun.
All these happy memories of them growing up together. Some were taken with a camera, John was sure were from Sherlock's mother, some of them were taken with their own phones that Sherlock had then printed. This showed how much their friendship meant to Sherlock. That their memories were important enough to be saved in this album.
“Sherlock!” John protested but soon Sherlock cut him by kissing him and grasping John by his shirt, drawing him closer so that they could lie on the bed, with John on top of Sherlock.
“Greg, mate we need to talk,” John said walking into man’s office without even bothering to knock. The detective inspector rose his head at the new guest.
“You’re the one who’s been avoiding me for weeks.” Sherlock pointed out containing himself from not shouting. “You don’t even pay attention to me when I’m talking anymore. I didn’t hear a single ‘Brilliant’ coming out of your mouth for weeks now.”
The Ex-army doctor cupped the detective’s cheek, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb, his others fingers playing with Sherlock’s hair on the back of his head.
“Nothing much, just apologising for hitting me with their ball.” John said, stroking his jaw again in remind of the pain.
By some point John dropped his head onto Sherlock shoulder, nuzzling his coat, his arm around his waist, full of affection and love. Sherlock would roll his eyes at his thoughts, calling him a Romantic, but he wouldn’t care less. They were on their first holidays as a couple, they were on a boat watching the sunset, how could it not be romantic?
“It’s fine.” He waved it off, he’s been to war, he endured a gunshot, he could survive being hit by a volley ball.
“Nice song you were playing.” He said, he seemed a little bit nervous as he trailed a hand over the back of his neck.
John shook his head at his stupidity, as he went back to his desk. He put the blame on the lack of sleep. In his right mind, he would never try to flirt with a stranger, especially without being 110% sure that the person in question was into him and most importantly into guys.
“Don’t be so public school, for god sake. It’s just for one night and it will be fun and exciting, we’ll do a small camp fire, eat dinner there with a barbecue. And then sleep cosily, cuddling each other.”
“Sherlock, how many times must I tell you, civilians aren’t allowed on crime scenes nor any police business,” Lestrade warned Sherlock for what John felt like it was the thousand time by his tone. “I’m risking my position just by letting you in on some matters.”
By now, they were mostly by themselves which was great, most people had gone home for dinner. Being alone in this place only made it look more magical and natural. They lied down on the rock and enjoyed the sunny rays coming their way. It was the perfect day of a perfect summer holiday, John even managed to make Sherlock take a picture with him to remind him of this day later on, which he was quite proud.
But as much as it pained him, he had to let go and going through *his* stuff was the best way to do it. Besides he didn’t want Mycroft's minions to do it, going through Sherlock’s personal goods, invading his privacy.
“Apologies,” the stranger finally said in a deep baritone voice as if melted chocolate, “I get lost when I’m thinking.”
Sherlock observed him turned around the corner to finally close the door, he looked at his violin and bow dropped on the couch where he left it to answer the door. Well since he couldn't  play tonight he would finish his experiment and at the same time catalogue all the small details that he had gained access to from that beautiful specimen that he had just met.
“Yes,” I want to caption that marvelous sight of yours for the eternity.” and he pulled his phone out.
“Wha- I’m not looking through your phone.” John defended himself, locking the screen, “not as if there was anything to look for. You barely use it.”
“What was that for?” Sherlock asked, breathing loudly while running a hand through his damp hair, getting it out of his eyes.
Furthermore, who didn’t like a sex holiday? Because that was totally what Sherlock was aiming at. For the whole trip, John would be not working, so all his time will be available for Sherlock to enjoy. No responsibilities, no grocery shopping to do. They would move at a slower pace, that means hours and hours of very long sessions of lovemaking in bed. They could even explore a few new things, in other words, spend a lot of quality time together and without worrying about being too loud and wake up Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock stood still, the new piece of information getting through his brain. A few seconds later, Sherlock ran off after John.
“You know, you could help me pack.” John said folding a pair of jeans and putting it in his suit case which was laying open on their bed.
Since Sherlock finished his plate, John offered him dessert and they decided to share a piece of chocolate cake. Both had sparkles in their eyes and smiles on their faces.
That made Sherlock turned to face John. Beside him was a tray with toasts, jam, coffee and were that strawberries with whipped cream?
They were at Bart’s searching for a fancy equipment Sherlock needed for a case when John heard a mobile phone go off and lifted an eyebrow.
“Well I’m off to Mike’s, I promised that I would hang around with him for a bit. See you later, Sherlock.” And then dashed off the room.
When they broke apart, Sherlock closed his eyes as John went in for a gentle kiss on his forehead. "We belong together, Sherlock.”
John was busy doing his crosswords on his newspaper while Sherlock was building a castle in the sand with a few kids that they had encounter earlier in the day. Sherlock being himself took charge of the parameters and architecture of the castle, giving them instructions on how to build the most efficient castle with the right amount of wet sand and the best way to take off the bucket to make sure the Castle wouldn’t fall down.
John frowned at this new piece of information but didn’t push it further, “Any idea who is holding us hostage?”
“Oh. Well….” The handsome man ran a hand through his hair, “It’s an original,” He admitted, “I compose when I’m in one of my moods, it helps me think, my mind seems to unlatch and I’m able to express my feelings.”
“Too bad, maybe you should try to play some ballads Mr…”John trailed out realising he didn’t even know his name.
The journey was long though, from England to the south of Ireland, where they would be staying, so Sherlock booked them a cabin for the night. All was planned out by the second week of August, now they only had to pack, get their passports and leave London behind for their Holiday of sex. Even though he didn’t call it like that in front of John.
Sherlock’s hands found their way to John’s shoulders, grabbing into, feeling the hard muscle underneath his lover’s shirt, then his hands traveled down his chest. John pulled back a few millimeters.
He was acting like an infatuated middle school teen with his first crush. However, his plan worked perfectly. Soon enough there was knock on the door.
Sherlock extended his palm and John gave his phone back. He fell silent for a few seconds before curiosity got the better of him.
It had been a busy day at the yard. Hell, a busy week for Lestrade. He was currently standing in his office, wrapping some paperwork in order to finally go home for the day, as a figure stepped into his open office without knocking. Greg looked up from his desk at the  intruder.
Of course, John was the reason, they were on vacations. One day over breakfast he simply stated that they should go on a holiday, get out of the flat, get London out of their lungs, be somewhere and someone else for a few days.
Sherlock only shrugged, “Close enough,” and he put it back on the shelf. “Ah! Irish whiskey fudge, that shall do for Mycroft.” He said as he noticed this new item, taking a box of fudge.
“Oh interesting,” Sherlock said, to which made John turn his head from the sea horizon to his boyfriend.
“Right of course.” John shook his head at his stupid question, playing with his food with his fork. “It just surprises me, that’s all.”
Since it was their last day, they decided to go shop and try to find a few souvenirs to bring back home to their friends and family. They were in a small gift shop near the city centre where they stayed.
“That was one of the reasons I left it behind.” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse too, his throat suddenly dry.
“Oh Really? That’s your brilliant plan? And I thought I was dating a genius” John was starting to get angry and fighting off with his restrains.
“Most people you talk to flirt with you.” Sherlock said kissing his jaw again, a few millimetres upwards.
John kept smiling as he passed beside Sherlock to climb up the stairs. Sherlock couldn’t help but close his eyes as he felt John’s body graze his and then opened them up to follow John’s backside with his eyes as he ascended the stairs.
Therefore there were only 3 pictures of Sherlock hanging on the walls at his parent's house. The first one wad of him and his brother when they were children, Sherlock was around 8 years old, he was sitting on a chair, his face serious while Mycroft, a few years older, stood behind him, head held high as if he knew he was going to rule the world in the near future. The second was a portrait of Sherlock at the age of 12 and finally the third one was another photo of him and his brother but this time at Mycroft's graduation ceremony.
John’s heart melt at that. He took a few step closer, coming face to face with the genius and kneeling in front of him.
Years passed and soon they were at university. John and Sherlock only became more inseparable with time, as if two halves of a whole. None of their other friends would see one without the other. Of course they chose the same university and decided to be roomates.
Sherlock took his phone out and handed it to John, while the blond wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and with his other arm he tries to reach out as far as he could to get them both on the picture. They were wearing their graduation gown and cap, they looked young and happy. Life was only starting for them and they were onto a wild adventure that was adult life.
Then they climbed to the top deck to enjoy the landscape. It was very windy up there since they were only surrounded by the sea, there were no barriers to stop the wind from blowing. Thank god they thought of taking their coats before coming up here.
“Do you have any idea how loud you are being?!” John asked. Steam could almost be seen coming out of his ears.
“Come on, herlock, smile to the camera, I just want a picture of you. You grow so fast my little boy.” His mom said, camera in hand.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn’t protest, deep down he knew his doctor was right. Besides he wasn’t about to say no to John touching his skin, no matter what. He loved his hands, loved to feel them on him.
“These photos, you kept them all?” His voice turning raspy out of sudden. He stepped slightly closer to Sherlock as if afraid to scare him off.
The third time they were photographed together was at their graduation ceremony. John was about to leave soon for Afghanistan with army while Sherlock would stay in London and do his PhD. Sherlock hated the idea of John moving to the other side of the world, even more the fact that he was putting his life in danger. But John was determined to serve Queen and country and nothing would dissuade him. Not for lack of trying because Sherlock did truly his best to persuade John to stay and never leave his side. Although he worried for John, Sherlock never mentioned it in front of him. Plus this new experience wasn't not only scary because of its mortal dangers but it would also be the first time they would be so far apart and for such an amount of time since their childhoods. For the first time, Sherlock would confront life on his own and he didn't know of he was ready for it.
“Ah quite the big city, indeed.” She smile friendly, “I’ve been there last year. Very busy, nothing compared to the calmness of Ireland. Are you enjoying it here, so far?”
“Lestrade, fancy seeing you here,” Sherlock appeared out of nowhere, his conversation with his brother probably finished.
Sherlock glared at his lover, he didn’t like when John ignored him, and he’d been at it all day. So he stood up and walked to John, who was currently sitting on his armchair. Sherlock had barely time to reach John that the doctor had already closed his laptop and had gotten up on his feet.
“I know i’ve been distant recently but it’s because I didn’t want you to deduce it and spoil it.” John half shout the end of the sentence.
“Then let me do it for you.”  The genius put down his right  knee and looked up the John, just in the middle of the pavement, “John will you marry me?”
It had been about over a week since John had moved into his new flat, and when he finally got to meet his upstairs neighbour who loved to play loud music at odd times of the night, messing with John’s sleep schedule.
The consultant detective got back to his initial position, on the sofa and put his fingers underneath his chin in his usual thinking position. He closed his eyes and passed in review John’s behavior in these past few weeks.
Although, he had really lovely lips. What would they taste like? And John would love to run a hand through his neighbour’s marvellous curly hair and to caress his fair skin, to get lost in his alluring eyes before leaning in for a slow and passionate kiss.
“No, no,” John stopped him, “You’re going to pick up that mess on the floor and are gonna to-” he was cut by another kiss, a hot open-mouth, toes curling kiss. “I have to pack,” John whispered when Sherlock left his lips for his jaw. The detective only hummed, not really listening, continuing his exploring of John's skin.
Sherlock sat at the table at Angelo’s nervously. His right foot tapping against the floor while he tried to appear relaxed and confident. However, his heart was beating fast and his mind was racing with thoughts of total disasters that could happen this evening and fuck up his only chance with John.
Although Sherlock would never admit it, there are indeed some pictures that are worth keeping in his opinion. The first picture that made an exception on Sherlock’s book, was the first photograph he took with John.
John ran his hands on Sherlock’s bare back and cupped his bottom, “Oh yeah,” he breathe, one hand coming to grasp the back of Sherlock’s neck, drawing down so he could ravish him with his mouth.
John had told him, he wanted somewhere close enough from England, so that the plane tickets wouldn’t be too expensive and the trip wouldn’t last too long. He couldn’t stand sitting in a long flight for more than 5 hours, his shoulder would start to act up.
John, draw his face closer to Sherlock, giving him a little peck at the same time and took the picture.
“That was exactly what I was asking Greg, hm?” He said. “I know you’ve been cheating on me with him, Sherlock.”
“You left the album on purpose.” John realized.  “You knew something was going to happen, so you left it, knowing you wouldn’t be coming back soon.”
Greg shook his head, rubbing his palm over his face. Why was he in the middle of this? Had he turned into some marriage counselor? Greg let out a deep sigh and stood up from his seat to look at John in the eye.
“Very well. I got bored of it though, but they seemed to have listened to my instructions.” Sherlock said, looking back at the two siblings near the water still building castles. “Want some ice cream?” he offered.
The next day, it was very much the same thing, wake up kisses, broad smiles from waking up in each others arms. The captain announced to them that breakfast is ready to be served and that they will arrive by noon. They got up and after a good shower and getting dressed they went to get breakfast. Sherlock refused to buy anything except coffee but as they sat down and John ate, he would pick some of John’s plate. He didn’t mind if it meant that Sherlock was eating.
He doesn’t know where or when he woke up, he tried to move his hands but they were tied to the back of the chair he was sitting on. His throat was sore so he tried to cough it out.
“Yes of course.” The stranger bent his head as if guilty, “Again I apologize.” His eyes met John’s and the former could swear the time stopped for a while.
John looked to his side and saw Sherlock, likewise tied up, his arms behind him, sitting on a chair. He didn’t look alarmed but rather bored.
“Yes of course. John, hi,” Lestrade seemed to remember him and extended his hand for a handshake. John noticed he looked exhausted as if he hadn’t sleep in the past few days, by the bags he had under his eyes.
They stayed up there for a while enjoying the scenery, the beauty of the see, the calm waves rocking the boat. At this hours the deck was mostly empty which he was thankful for as they could easily find a bench and enjoyed the sunset in silence, holding each others hand, side by side. They sat like this for what seemed for hours.
Years later when Sherlock would come across this picture, his lips would turn up in a smile at joy expressed in that photograph. All he could think is that he would never regret taking it.
“Sherlock,” he moaned, still fighting for Sherlock to listen to him but his body betraying him, “you’re not being fair,”
After a lazy morning in bed, they decided it was time to get out of the house, so in the afternoon, the couple decided to go do some kayak, enjoy the coast view from the sea. They rented two kayaks and started to rowing. It was fun, from time to time they would go against each other on purpose or splash each other with their paddles. They spent their time laughing.
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” Lestrade asked, taking his coat from behind his chair and shrugging it on, ready to leave after a long day of work.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and focused back onto his work, trying to preventing John from seeing colour rising to his cheeks.
They entered the water almost at the same time, splashing it everywhere, John took Sherlock by the middle and pulled him underwater with him. They both resurfaced laughing like two maniacs.
“Come on, John! I want to see the waterfall!” Sherlock shout from 5 meters away, as John was trying to get the best light for the picture.
It was a hard blow for John to find out that out of nowhere that the last couple of years had been a lie. His best friend wasn’t actually dead. At first he was angry, full of hatred but also betrayed and hurt.  It took some time for John to finally forgive Sherlock, it wasn’t easy. Punching him in the face was an act of anger, not talking to Sherlock (until he was kidnapped and almost killed in a bonfire) was an act of stubbornness, forgiving him was an act of trust.
“I’d say you got yourself a smart guy.” She replied, “Well, I’ll leave you be, Sorry again for the hit. Have a nice holiday.” She waved good bye, the volley ball underneath her arm as she walked back to her friends.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, eyes wide open. He couldn't realise how blind he had been all this time. Of course, he was going to propose, what else could it be? Sherlock, only saw but didn't observe. It was proof that sentiment clouds your judgment. Though, He didn't mind it if it meant he would have John Watson by his side for the rest of his life.
The annoying music came back again two weeks later, late at night. However, this time the violin was being played in a way that revealed a real slow and passionate melody. No cat was being tortured, and if John was honest with himself it was quite pleasing to hear. The music wasn’t as much as a bother as it was the other night, but John saw this as an opportunity and very good excuse to go complain once more to the devilishly good looking upstairs neighbour, after all, what harm could it do?
“You silly man.” John draw Sherlock’s face to him, brushing his lips against the genius asking for permission. “How could I ever forget you?" And then he kissed him deeply.
“Sure,” He took the bottle that John was holding and made John move forward on his sunbed so that he could sit behind him and apply the sunblock.
By the end, his eyes caught a photo album under Sherlock’s bed. He never saw it before, he didn't thought Sherlock would ever have one since be seem to hate photos with such hatred. John didn’t know how he missed it in the first place. He sat on the bed and looked through the album.
“Thanks,” John said, putting back on his coat when he saw the detective that worked with Sherlock approach him.
“You’ve seen a load of dead corpses then.” Sherlock walked closer as if drawn by a magnetic field, staring down at John.
Later on, John would carry that same picture inside his left pocket of his army fatigues to remind him that someone was waiting for him to come home.
“Sorry,” John shook his head, coming back to earth, “Yes, Of course. I’d love to go out with you. Name the place and the hour and I’ll be there.”
When he was a child and with his parents, he would take the ferry to cross the English channel to go visit his grandparents in France, he would let himself imagine that it was his ship, he was the captain and they were sailing over the seven seas looking for hidden treasures. Like Pirates do. He was sure John wouldn’t object.
The following day was almost identical to the previous one, they longed on the beach, sunbathing and walked along the beach holding hands. Peace and quite were the key words for the day.
“Erm, no, It’s alright. I’m fine thanks. I was surprised by the hit that’s all,” John replied, in a polite smile, giving the ball back.
Their hostage situation didn’t last long or at least it could have been a lot worse if Sherlock’s brother hadn’t intervened, Micheal or something was his name, John heard Sherlock complain when they were finally free.
Coming back to the cottage, they were both exhausted and drained from their day’s activities, after a quick shower and a small bite they went to bed. Sherlock being a needy boyfriend, wrapped himself around John, his hear against John’s heart and his hand over his stomach while their legs were tingled. They fell asleep in no time.
“Oh Sherlock I would never forget you,” John said reaching for his best friend's back of the neck, his thumb running in circles in an appeasing way. They stared into each others eyes for a few moments before coming back from their reverie.
“No nothing that would need your assistance. I’ll see you later.” John heard his boyfriend say before dashing off.
So here it is for the end this trip. They certainly had fun but nothing better than coming back home to their own flat and own bed.
Everything indicated this to be the end of a perfect date, however, John should have known better. As they turned a block, men attacked them from behind, they put a black cloth over their faces and injected them with some kind of a drug in the neck. The last thing John remembered was feeling Sherlock’s brush of fingers over his own hand before everything went to black.
Sherlock started closing the door as slowly as he could, eyeing his new acquaintance lower back as he walked away. What a good view, Sherlock hummed to himself. Square shoulders, head held high, short blond hair, nice bottom, athletic kind, probably played for a university sports team, probably on scholarship giving his cheap accommodation.
Today was their last day in Ireland, although John felt a bit sad about leaving the place, he also missed London too. One week away was all what he needed but he couldn’t leave in this peace, country side life forever, at least not for the moment, maybe when they are older and want to retire, but for now the call of the city, the thrill was too much of a magnet for the both of them.
In the end, they bought a few key-rings, a fridge magnet (John was planning to start a collection and start to force Sherlock to go on vacations more often), a tea towel for Mrs Hudson, a bottle-opener shaped into a leprechaun for Greg and his beloved beers, a woolen scarf for Molly. John also bought a mug shaped in an leprechaun face and a T-shirt.
When they arrived at the pub minutes later, they sat in a booth in a corner. Greg ordered two pints, and asked Sherlock what this night out was really about.
Sherlock after spending long hours searching on the internet decided that Ireland would be a good choice for their vacation. It was close from home, they spoke mostly their language even though Gaelic was still present. The best part was the high probability of rain that would force them to stay in bed all day. whoops.
“Lestrade we are both physically and emotionally drained, we just want to go home and sleep. We’ll come by tomorrow promise.” Sherlock even put on a soft smile to help his case.
“I didn’t want you to forget me,” his voice was raspy, almost as if he was about to cry. John kept stroking his face.
They met John on their way out as they descended the stairs. It seemed that he was coming back from the library by his backpack and his damp hoodie covering his head.
Once they were both done with it, they both went back to their occupations, later in the afternoon, Sherlock was reading a book, deep in focus and John couldn’t help himself but stare at him, at his beautiful partner. He was so lucky to have this man in his life.
John wasn’t the jealous type, not really. Who was he kidding, of course he was the jealous type. He loved that he was the only person that Sherlock actually liked to spend time with, that he had all his attention. So even If John didn’t want to admit it, It was pissing him off that Sherlock has gone to someone else.
The rocks were stable and weren’t very slippery thank god. John tried to keep up with Sherlock and his bloody long legs but it was easier said than done.
John soon came to realize that what really matter was that Sherlock was back into his life and he was thankful for that since he had missed him immensely. Sherlock was moving back to Baker Street and they spent all day bringing all his possessions back to the flat. Mycroft had kept them in a warehouse knowing that Sherlock would come back someday, eventually.
He had been trying to come up to Sherlock’s door for weeks now, trying to gain his courage to invite him out and Sherlock had just done that for him. This gorgeous man was asking him out and John's brain couldn't process that piece of information.
“That’s me to keep, and you to find out,” He winked, as he ended to handshake and started walking away, towards his own flat.
“Thanks,” John managed to speak out after a long pause, “Just turn your stereo down for the night please, most people sleep at this hour of the night.”
Taking the matter into his own hands, he snapped Sherlock’s phone and without a second thought sat on his best friend’s lap. He opened the camera app and took his time to take several pictures. Ones where he was smiling at the camera, others making silly faces, trying to make Sherlock smile (and partly succeeding).
Tonight he was playing a recent song that John had told him he liked, after having searched on youtube a violin cover in hopes to bring John back to his door and possibly into his flat for the first time.
A few days later, Sherlock was pacing in front of the entrance door of their building, besides the mailing boxes, waiting for John to come back from wherever he might have been. He couldn’t even be sure that John was out but given the time of the day and the fact that it was Wednesday, there was a big probability that the would come back soon or later.
“Yes and now you ruined it as I predicted! That’s why we can’t have nice things, Sherlock.” He said before walking out.
“It’s quite red,” the woman said, staring at his face, “I’m really sorry.” She looked genuinely apologetic.
“I completely forgot I had to… huh to go get that thing, that I told you about...” He trailed off clutching his laptop to his chest as if afraid Sherlock might take it.  That odd behavior got Sherlock curious. John was nervous, he was shifting from one foot to another, glancing everywhere but at Sherlock.  And with the laptop securely hold against his chest, John left the room, leaving a confused Sherlock in living-room.
“Nice. very nice.” John commented sarcastically to himself, “Not exactly how I planned this date to go. So what’s the plan?” He asked.
Sherlock was awaken by soft lips and a small stumble on his skin doing what would surely lead to naughty things.
“Well, you were the one wanting to go abroad. Staying home with you, only sheets between us is fine by me.” Sherlock said.
Soon enough they arrived on port and rent a car, Sherlock being the one driving since John didn’t have a driver’s licence, not seeing the point of one while living in London where having a car was very expensive. Sherlock of course learned how as it could come handy for a case.
“Alright, I’m going to check the stuff over there, see if there’s anything interesting,” he pointed to the end of the shop, “don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone.”
He tried to force Sherlock to make silly poses but only one picture came out well. "Close enough", John thought to himself. He sent it to his phone and with a happy smile, jumped off Sherlock’s lap.
John kept turning the pages, revisiting the past, back and forth, remembering Sherlock’s happy face not unconscious full of blood. Suddenly he couldn’t take it anymore, he let out all of his pain and cried onto Sherlock’s pillow, on *his* bed, hugging it hard, wishing it was his best friend instead.
When finally John appeared through the door though, it all changed. His smile put Sherlock’s mind at peace. He was dressed in simple jeans and an old jumper but he had put on his “date night” shoes. Sherlock saw John’s eyes searching the room and felt his gaze on him once he found him. He felt lighter than, John crossed the room quickly and sat before him.
After lunch they took on the road to their cottage, it was also near the beach, they were close to the Durmon East, a very nice place. Their cottage was just on the coast, they had an amazing view over the see and the beach. It really looked like a dream vacation, and bonus it was actually warm enough to go for a swim.
Sherlock sits at a small table outside a café, sipping his coffee and listening to the city bustle around him. Back in the Swiss Alps, he thought he missed being in a city, missed England, but now he’s in Bristol and it turns out that wasn’t it at all – he just misses home. Being in an English city doesn’t help when it’s not London, it really only makes things worse by being too similar and not similar enough, so he’s already made plans to relocate to the country. For now, though, it’s good to be here – the only reason he picked Bristol out of all the places he could have gone is because he knew Molly was scheduled to attend a conference there. If he can’t go home (and he can’t), then he can at least see a friendly face. And when he does see her, walking towards him, scanning the tables for him, it creates a strange, almost painful feeling in Sherlock’s chest. A friend. He does have those, despite everything.
enough, so there had to be another round? With Sherlock’s on his knees, braced against the headboard, gasping for breath as the other man pounded into him, the sounds of skin slapping against skin filling the air, bed rocking against the wall?
Sherlock pants as his body adjusts, then swallows and opens his eyes (he has no recollection of closing them).
is all he ever does these days and he wishes he could be done with it now, that he could stop with the constant self-examination and uncertainty and just
“I’m sorry to say this, but he sounds like a right dick,” Robert says after Sherlock stops talking, his bushy brows knit together.
“God, we’ve really got a long way to go, don’t we,” John murmurs, shaking his head mournfully. He’s right, there are so many things they have to address and resolve and work through, and the path to anything approaching a happy, stable relationship seems winding and endless… but they’re on it together.
Sherlock shrugs. “I did what you said I should.” His next words sound like they should be venomous, but instead they are completely empty of emotion. “I had sex, so now I hope I finally qualify as a
be ready for that. He can’t imagine John in the same room with anyone Sherlock has slept with, but he’s happy that Patrick and Sam want to stay in touch.
It hurts worse than he thought it would, searing pain like being split open as John drives into him again and again and again, pummelling his insides. Sherlock imagines what this would look like to someone who came in now, John “Not Gay” Watson ramming his penis deep inside another man’s anus with animalistic vigour, and he wants to laugh hysterically at the absurdity of it. The noises he hears leaving his mouth sound nothing like laughter, however.
John climbs on top of him, covering Sherlock’s body with his. The pleasure of finally having skin-on-skin contact is so intense that John can’t help but rut against Sherlock’s lower back for a moment to ease the ache in his balls.
“Me too,” Sherlock breathes even though it’s not strictly speaking true: the truth is that he’s wanted Florian from the moment he realised Florian wanted him, but that doesn’t sound like something he should say out loud. Florian smiles and kisses him again.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says tersely – it’s absolutely ridiculous that John should feel guilty, when Sherlock was the sober one and entirely unable to control his feelings.
Sherlock lets go of John and steps back abruptly. “Can’t I?” he snaps. It’s one thing for himself to doubt his wishes and a different thing entirely for John to do that. “That isn’t for you to decide.”
on starting a relationship. It’s seems impossible, but it’s happening, here and now. The only reason Sherlock knows he’s not dreaming is the way John looks at him, like he can’t believe it’s happening either, like he wants it just as much as Sherlock does.
He regrets it immediately. What is he supposed to do now? What other recourse does he have? The world has crashed and burned and the despair weighing on him is too much to bear. He has nothing left,
“Do you mind if we switch it up a bit? I like it better from behind,” Terry says before giving Sherlock a quick, dirty kiss and repositioning himself on his knees and forearms, his arse in the air, presenting himself to Sherlock like an offering.
He leaves the dressing gown on the floor and slips under the covers. The feel of lube between his buttocks is uncomfortable. Has he used too much of it? Or maybe too little. How long can he stay adequately stretched? He hopes John will hurry if he wants to join him, before Sherlock can actually work himself into a panic. He hates how nervous it makes him feel – it’s all just transport, after all, and he should be glad if he gets to use it to give John pleasure.
“All right?” John asks after what feels like years, the fingers of his left hand brushing Sherlock’s pubic hair, so close to where Sherlock is hard with an arousal that’s not insistent at all but somehow fills every crevice of Sherlock’s body anyway.
Sherlock felt himself smile into the kiss – he was almost on the verge of laughing, really, relief and delight filling his every pore because he’d done it, he’d made John come and John had enjoyed it. It may have been just a quick handjob but John had liked it, and besides, it was just the first step: Sherlock would learn to be better and give John more.
John smiles at him, like Sherlock’s answer actually makes him happy, and Sherlock can’t help but smile back.
the taste of his mouth, the feel of his tongue, the wet sounds their mouths make as they slide against each other.
Molly looks at him as if he had just asked why she thought rain had anything to do with clouds. “He didn’t even know you’d gone. You wrote him a
Sherlock opens his kiss-swollen mouth and says the words like he never thought he would – not a painful admission of secret, hidden feelings but an easy, joyful offering that’s accepted and wanted: “I love you.”
It’s the first time they’ve tried this particular position: Sherlock’s on his knees, but his head and arms rest on the pillow – essentially, he’s there with his arse in the air, blatantly submissive. It’s extremely undignified, but the real problem is that the position turns out to be perfect for stimulating Sherlock’s prostate. John brushes it on every thrust and withdrawal, firmly enough to be more than teasing but not hard enough to be uncomfortable. He keeps a slow and steady pace, sending wave after wave of intense sensation to every particle of Sherlock’s body. He tries to take his mind off it, but it’s impossible: the only thing he can focus on is the delicious drag of John’s cock inside him, John’s fingers gripping his hips, the sounds John is making.
Sherlock takes John’s hand and guides it to his cock, and John is surprised to find it still hard. Despite the evidence of Sherlock’s climax that’s coating it, his erection hasn’t waned.
Robert nods, accepting Sherlock’s answer, but the silence that stretches between them is tense now. Sherlock clears his throat.
John isn’t attracted to men. Even in his current befuddled state, the feeling of an erect penis pressing against him might not be very much to his taste and turn him off.
Rosie shrieks with delight when she sees him and Sherlock greets her with the sort of exuberance he reserves only for her, picking her up and spinning her around, but all of his senses are acutely aware of John standing right there, at parade rest, seemingly calm but actually nervous. He looks… better than the last time Sherlock saw him. A little less thin, a little less tired, a little less like a man on his way to the gallows. He offers Sherlock a small, careful smile. Sherlock smiles back.
“Let go, love. I’ve got you, let go.” John kissed his temple, and that was it: Sherlock’s back arched, his hips ramming forward one last time and then something snapped and was coming, shuddering in John arms with helpless moans leaving his lips as he came and came and
“And clearly,” Irene continues with a pointed look at Sherlock’s collar, “it’s the latter. I must say I’m pleasantly surprised; when Dr Watson got married, I was beginning to fear he’d never come to terms with his feelings for you.”
“How are things between you and John?” Molly asks him carefully as they walk side by side between the exhibits.
John sat down next to him. For a moment they just sat in silence, staring at their mugs of tea, and Sherlock desperately tried to come up with something less pathetic to say than “I’m so sorry please don’t break up with me”.
“Yeah. You know how I… I mean, being attracted to men has always been linked to violence in my head. Whenever I imagined myself having sex with a man, it was…” he swallows, shakes his head, “not something I’d ever want to do to you. And… the therapy has helped me a lot, it really has, I haven’t felt this sort of rage in a long while, otherwise I’d never have dared start something with you. But I’m scared it’ll just… come back once we’re actually doing something, and I’ll hurt you and you’ll… let me.”
“That sounds… reasonable,” he says, struggling to get the words out. His throat is pinhole tight and a strange sort of cotton fog seems to be filling his mind. He and John, talking and
The toy slides in easily enough but Sherlock still gasps when it breaches him, noticeably more substantial than anything he’s tried on his own. Robert soothes him with gentle touches, giving him time to adjust, before he settles on his side next to Sherlock and slips a hand down between Sherlock’s legs to begin moving the toy in smooth, careful strokes.
Before Sherlock can notice what’s happening, John grabs fistfuls of Sherlock’s t-shirt, pushing him backwards until the back of Sherlock’s thighs hits the kitchen counter and his head slams against one of the cupboards. His vision swims.
“Please,” Sherlock begs again, looking almost wild with need, and John couldn’t resist the plea if someone offered to pay him for it.
“Let me guess,” John husks, taking pity on him “You did this.” He moves one hand to Sherlock’s right nipple, holding Sherlock’s hips still with the other. “Teased those sensitive nipples, didn’t you? Like this.” He rolls the firm bud between his fingers, stroking and squeezing.
Terry stops nibbling on Sherlock’s ear and steps back a little to look at him. “What’s wrong? Are you... Did you want to bottom?”
He startles from his contemplation when he hears footsteps on the stairs. Molly’s on duty today, and she usually doesn’t come before six, so it’s unexpected to hear someone coming so early in the afternoon, but it becomes almost immediately obvious that this isn’t Molly’s tread. It’s John.
“Nothing. No buts,” Sam interjects, and this time Sherlock doesn’t need to by privy to their special means of communication to hear the tone of warning in Sam’s voice.
Sherlock had never allowed himself to imagine what kissing John might be like, but if he had he most probably wouldn’t have imagined it like this – wet and salty but perfect anyway, soft and gentle and reverent, one kiss blending into the next, separating only to meet again, chaste pecks turning into slick slides of tongue against tongue and then gentling again in a glorious cycle, over and over until Sherlock’s lips tingle and he’s smiling into the kisses, until he’s smiling so wide he can’t kiss anymore.
John selects one of Sherlock’s array of lubricants and starts opening Sherlock up. He goes slowly, his fingers massaging at this most private part of Sherlock’s body and then dipping in, one by one. The tenderness and intimacy of it is heart-stopping, John never stops looking at him, stroking and kissing any part of him that he can reach, murmuring endearments. He takes his time with him, teasing him, spoiling him rotten. At one point Sherlock has to actually ask him to stop because he feels too close to coming, and when the edge recedes and John returns his three fingers back inside Sherlock’s body and adds a fourth, moving them shallowly in and out, Sherlock thinks he might go insane with want.
can it be so different when the only thing that isn’t the same is the hand holding the base of the toy? He turns his head to the side and kisses Robert, needy and messy, as his body adapts and responds to the gentle movements inside him. He’s learned to appreciate the vulnerability of sex, but this is something else, something more, his body opening to another. Sherlock whimpers into the kiss when Robert finds the perfect angle to stimulate his prostate just right, but a moment’s later that’s no longer a sufficient outlet and he has to break the kiss and throw his head back in a loud moan.
“Yeah, I know, you do it because you’re an addict just looking for an opportunity to get high and say you did to catch a serial killer!”
“Yes,” Sherlock says haltingly, still rather taken aback. If he is to spend hours trapped in a building with hundreds of idiots, he generally prefers concerts of classical music, but he doesn’t object to a good ballet now and then, and it’s true he doesn’t particularly mind looking at the muscular thighs of male ballet dancers.  “But won’t
Sherlock glances at him. “Me too,” he says truthfully, and he finds himself smiling a little. Tentatively, John smiles back.
John, seated in his own chair opposite Sherlock and pretending to read the paper, sees the exact moment Sherlock notices what he’s doing: he freezes, and his face flushes – because he’s embarrassed, but also because his arousal quadruples the moment he becomes aware of it. Sherlock looks up at John, flustered, to see if he noticed, and finds John looking straight at him with a knowing smirk on his face. John can hear Sherlock’s breath catch in his throat.
Their position meant John had perfect access to Sherlock’s neck, and his breath ghosted over the sensitive skin there before he pressed his lips to Sherlock’s pulse point. Sherlock let his head fall to one side, exposing as much of his neck as possible, and John understood the invitation, kissing and licking and oh god,
He should probably bin it. Flush it down the toilet. He feels temptation gnaw at him to go check it’s all still there, open the packet to make sure it’s undamaged, fit for use. And that’s not a good sign, is it. He should get rid of it. If he uses again, even just once, he’ll lose John for good.
Sherlock looks down at his cup of coffee. Why did he imagine he could meet up with Molly and somehow not have to talk about John? But Molly is his
Sherlock didn’t deserve this. He didn’t deserve having the only sexual encounter with the man he loves made into an act of violence. His love for John used as a weapon against him by John himself. He may deserve everything else, but not this. Why didn’t he realise it before the fact? He could have stopped John, he could have got away, easily… There was plenty of time to act between the moment when Sherlock realised what John was about to do and the moment when John actually did it. So why didn’t he? Is he truly so willing to let John do whatever he wants to him, regardless of consequences?
John frowned, surprised. He had assumed the doctor would prefer to go over the chart with him verbally.
Sherlock had never felt such intense rage and hatred in his entire life. He seemed to burn with it. He thought he might actually implode.
When John hit the water, his breath was knocked out by the freezing water. He beat against it, trying to find his way to the surface again.
"Harriet Watson," he repeated. "We need to speak with her immediately. We need her to make a medical decision on behalf of Dr. John Watson and we haven't much time. Do you know how we can get in touch with her? We've tried calling."
John’s hand had fallen to his back and now his nails dug into Sherlock’s skin in a way so pleasurable that Sherlock let out his own moan. Sherlock slowly lowered his hand, centimeter by centimeter, until finally (
He moved quickly to the pile of wood planks in corner, keeping a careful eye on John. He rummaged through the pile, discarding piece after piece, until finally he came to one that looked promising.
Slowly, John pushes himself back up to standing. Sherlock can see shards of glass embedded in his knees and hands. It takes him an eternity, but John finally reaches the other end of the room. He is now stumbling and dragging his feet through the glass and Sherlock knows he doesn’t have long.
This was round nine. Two more rounds and he could get this man out of here and to safety. Two more rounds and it would be over.
He looked down at John. John’s face held an expression Sherlock couldn’t quite interpret. Was it panic? Embarrassment? Anger? Shame? Some combination of emotions? Sherlock couldn’t tell.
Sherlock moved back to John’s mouth, missing its taste. As he did so, he shifted his weight slightly and allowed his hand to fall lower, onto the top of John’s pants. He slid his hand along the waistband, his thumb hooked inside. John moved his hips slightly, involuntarily. Sherlock smiled into his mouth.
"Sherlock," John's own voice sounded odd to him and not, he now realized, though lack of use. "I... I think... I can't...I can't
“Good,” Scarecrow said. “I’ve got a good one this time. I’m going to give you a choice. Choose well, Dr. Watson.”
"We're going to set up a trap for our murderer," Sherlock said, making his way through the deck and down a set of creaky stairs.
"Ah," Sherlock said and John thought he looked uncomfortable, which wasn't a good sign. "Dr. Azarian sedated you and took you for imaging. You sprained your arm, but he doesn't believe there is any further damage, though he won't know for certain until the scans come back from analysis."
It must have been sometime later, though he couldn't be certain how long, when the sound of the door opening startled him, causing him to jump again.
Suddenly, John begins carefully removing his shirt. Sherlock is confused. Why would he take away his only layer of protection? As he watches, however, his question is answered. John takes the shirt and rips it into long strips. Moving very carefully (though still getting cut in the process) he begins tying the strips around sensitive areas of his body—his neck, his wrists, his stomach.
To his surprise, the thing was incredibly strong. He had to drop his cane and lean his entire weight against it just to budge it enough to close the door. When it was closed and secured, he leaned his weight against it, panting with the effort and his terror.
“Well,” Mycroft said slowly, “I’m afraid this isn’t my specialty, brother. You know I don’t get… attached. It seems you have become quite attached to this man. Are you sure that is wise brother?”
"Your doctor," he said slowly, "Dr. Azarian, couldn't contact Harry, so I... er... I had Mycroft list me as your next-of-kin. They asked me to give consent to.. to allow them to..."
Several times during these long days, Lestrade called at the door, begging Sherlock to help find the lost princess. Sherlock often refused to even acknowledge his presence and, when he did, was rude and short with him. John, however, came to enjoy Lestrade's company and, eventually, began to consider him a friend. The even went for drinks one night when Sherlock was particularly petulant and John needed an escape.
The seconds tick quickly away, and John moves more quickly still, but Sherlock is still not certain he will reach the door in time. What would happen then. Would he be left in that room to bleed out slowly? Would Sherlock have to watch?
“Dr. Watson,” he continued, “I simply cannot advise discharging you yet. You still have a lot of healing to do.”
After an eternity, during which Sherlock became more and more panicked, John coughed. With intense relief, Sherlock gently pulled John onto his side, allowing him to more easily cough up anything in his lungs. After a moment, John stopped coughing and began, blessedly, breathing on his own. Taking long, deep breaths.
“Good job John,” Moriarty said. “Your first number is eleven. Be sure to jot it down. I won’t be telling you again.”
"...John," Sherlock's voice was low but insistent, as though he were torn between not wanting to disturb John and wanting his attention.
Even from where he was sitting, John could see Sherlock's back straighten. He seemed to fill with energy, radiating out from his entire body.
He felt numb and dizzy. He was stumbling and having difficulty focusing. Vacantly, he realized he was in shock. Ignoring this, he began carefully making his way through what had become of the building John had run into without him.
“On the lips, of course,” the voice seemed to read his mind. “With tongue. And Sherlock, if I’m not entertained, I’ll put another hole in John’s shoulder, so do make it good.”
John beamed at him. This was his opportunity to potentially figure out a way to break Sherlock's contract with the fire demon and, perhaps, even find a way to break his own curse or fight the Witch of the Wastes.
“One night…” John stopped, breathed, and continued. “One night I witnessed… I saw Seb doing some… Well, some not good things to some civilians. He saw me. When we got back to camp, he caught me before I could get to our superiors.”
Suddenly, John froze. His breath caught in his throat, his eyes flew open, staring at the ceiling, and his pulse raced. Sherlock removed his hand immediately, pushing himself carefully off John and examining him.
"I'm afraid you haven't any," she said and he thought there might have been actual sympathy in her voice, though he was no judge in the best of times. "Dr. Watson needs surgery one way or the other immediately. The surgeons are quite impatient to get started. His risks for complications are increasing by the moment, I'm afraid. The longer you wait, the higher the risk becomes."
When he opened his eyes again a moment later, a straw was hovering in front of his lips. He gave Sherlock a grateful half grin and sipped as much of the offered water as he could manage.
He found the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line and, taking a steading breath and urging his shaking hand to still, he placed the tip of the pocket knife in the space and pushed, making a small incision. He cursed the dullness of the knife, but at least John wasn’t awake to feel it.
Slowly, painfully, John dragged himself up to a sitting position. He put his head in his hand for a long moment, clearly dizzy and fighting off a headache.  Finally, he pushed himself to his feet again. He was still swaying, but not dangerously anymore.
He was shorter than Sherlock, which he used to his advantage, leaning slightly forward into the man's personal space in an aggressive gesture that was too subtle to be consciously noticed, but tended to encourage people to follow one's orders.
The clock continued to tick down. They had only minutes now. He had to make a decision. And there was only one way to make it.
And Sherlock had tried to shout and push his way into the ambulance with him and had been bullied out by several large men and his own very foggy and aching head. And then Lestrade had been there, ushering him into his car, saying something about a concussion and getting him to the hospital. Sherlock had agreed enthusiastically with that, though for entirely different reasons.
John was walking toward the side of the room where the body was found when he realized Sherlock was not beside him. He turned back to find Sherlock standing by the door, looking out. Amelia was on the other side, looking annoyed.
"I just want to ask you some questions about the body that was left here," John could see from where he was standing that Sherlock had tensed, ready to move.
A few more (incredibly long) moments later, Sherlock heard Lestrade and five others, whose identities he didn’t care enough to note, picking through the rubble beside him. He didn’t care to admit (to himself or anybody else) how relieved he was to have help in finding John.
John’s eyes opened. They looked glassy and blurry, but eventually they settled on Sherlock. His head moved.
"What took you so long?" Harry asked as she pulled up a chair to the fireside. "And what happened?" She pointed to the cane.
"Out," John snapped, grabbing his cane and limping out the front door, feeling every ache in his worn body tenfold.
Thus, when he found himself running low on several of his most popular herbs one day in Spring, he determined to go to the shop on May Day, a day when closing the clinic would hardly hurt business and when he could see the town's festivities. He hoped being surrounded by happy people in a celebratory mood might restore some of his energy.
John rushed up to meet him. He didn’t see anything, but he trusted Sherlock’s eyes better than his own.
“There is nobody else who could have done it. Could have hidden Sebastian like that. And who better to recruit to get to me than one of John’s old enemies. Moriarty knows my soft spot, especially after the pool.”
“Like hell I won’t,” John had apparently been listening to Sherlock’s conversation. “I’m not letting you go up against this psychopath alone.”
He could immediately tell the leg was broken, badly. Blood was seeping out of the side of the leg and, moving to take a closer look, Sherlock had to close his eye to keep from getting nauseous as he saw the shocking white of bone sticking out of John’s leg. A compound fracture. The majority of the leg was covered by his jeans, but a large portion had torn, revealing a bloody mess of skin, muscle, and bone.
As he rounded a corner and caught sight of John running into the flats, Sherlock’s body froze and his breath caught. His mind, racing to catch up with his physical state, registered the signs that had caused his body to react.
John blinked, trying to collect himself. Then he followed as quickly as he could, not wanting to be left behind in the strange city. Sherlock was waving at the street as some of the large machines passed by, like carriages, but without horses and much faster. After a moment, one of the machines stopped and Sherlock opened the door, beckoning for John to enter.
“This will just be pure chance,” Sherlock yells at Moriarty. “I’ll just have to guess. There is no way for me to know otherwise. That’s not a puzzle.”
“Then he’ll have to wake up and continue,” Moriarty said simply. “And I won’t even give him a time limit this time. He can take as long as he likes.”
Richard smiled and handed him the book. "I'll take care of checking it out. No worries. Please do come back soon."
They were escorted to a small room, into which a tired looking doctor entered minutes later, looking at a chart.
Sherlock didn't bother trying to contact Harry. She would have been of little help in the best of situations and Sherlock certainly wouldn't trust her with any important medical decisions concerning John.
"I should die," the star said, moving away again. "It isn't right for me to be caught! Please don't!"
“I’m aware,” John said, positioning the crutch under his good arm and otherwise ignoring Sherlock’s protest.
"It's okay to love someone, Sherlock," she said softly, sadness just evident in her eyes, "and it's okay to tell them too."
First, he was in a private room. He suspected Mycroft's interference there, though he wouldn't put it past Sherlock to have some connection in the hospital administration or to be able to charm his way into a private room.
"There seems to be no pattern," Lestrade said. "The first occurred three months ago. The last two one week apart. Then another month before this one. Will you take the case?"
"...lock. Sherlock!" Lestrade's voice intruded on his consciousness and he suddenly realized the DI's hand had been shaking his shoulder persistently for who-knows-how-long.
John didn’t respond. His face was paler than before. Sherlock looked at his shoulder, blook was seeping through the scarf. He looked at his leg. Blood coated the board.
After a few tense minutes (or possibly hours—he couldn't tell), he began to hear an annoying noise he thought he recognized. Squinting up through dust, he saw Lestrade, who had finally arrived and was angrily shouting for him to get the fuck out of the building.
He moved to the back room, where he used to spend his time making remedies and notes, and found a folded piece of paper on his desk, just as he had the day he met Sherlock for the first time in the town's main street.
Sherlock looked back up at the hospital. He felt sick to his stomach. He needed to tell Dr. Azarian, but the thought made him feel cold.
Without hesitation, John looks up and begins entering the numbers. Sherlock is startled by his trust in him and begs the universe to let him be right.
“I know,” John smiled. “Okay, the bullet should have followed a fairly straight trajectory. You’ll want to make the incision directly on the entrance wound. You’ll have to go deep. It probably hit the bone, then stopped. Once you hit bone, you’ll find the bullet. Then you’ll have to pull it out with your fingers.”
“Yes Sherlock,” Moriarty said slowly. “The puzzle is another simple one. Just tell John which syringes to inject. But you’d better act quickly. John doesn’t appear to be doing well.”
"Dr. Watson," he said, addressing John without any hint of condescension, "you should know the risks before you make your decision."
"You pocket watch," Sherlock said, pointing to the watch. "It is an expensive piece, but you are wearing inexpensive clothing and have no other luxury items. A gift then. The next part is easy, you know it already."
Sherlock moved so that he was only inches from John's face. John tensed, feeling a tingle run down his spine.
This was emotional. Not really his area. But he had to do something. John was looking sick, losing weight, and clearly feeling miserable. He was in the mood in which people started making stupid decisions.
"The violin," Sherlock was perched near the strange equipment, fiddling with something John couldn't make out. "I play when I think. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
"I am not an amateur detective," Sherlock said, his tone dangerous. "I am a consulting detective. Talk to Detective Lestrade in Kingsbury if you would like confirmation."
He could feel sweat dripping down his forehead as he stared at the containers. On the other side of the room, John sat patiently, beginning to look more and more pale.
"And he isn't the only one either," Bryan said quickly. "There have been at least three others who have died the same way and nobody had figure out who killed them either."
But he had been trying, unsuccessfully, not to think back to those moments after the explosion for several hours now, so he gave up the effort and allowed his mind to wander back to the next moments in his memory's sequence.
Sherlock burst out of the room and down the hall. Where was John? If he was on a respirator, he was likely in the ICU. Sherlock rounded a corner, finding a nurse’s station in the middle of the hall.
Sherlock heard the voice in the distance, laughing. He searched the darkness, but he couldn’t find anything. He was about to start running when he heard a moan behind him.
Sherlock stopped pacing and stared at John, wordlessly, for a heartbeat. Then he tore through the room and picked up the case files, which he had left on the table by the fire. He stood, silently reading for several long moments while John watched, trying to figure out what was going on.
The woman glared up at them from beneath the ropes. John moved to the man, who was lying still on the ground near the door. He checked for a pulse and was relieved to find the man was still alive.
John thought back to Amelia's expression. He knew Sherlock was right -- they were talking about a vampire, after all. It would be foolish to take her at her word. And yet, every time he saw her expression when she talked about her lover, he couldn't help but believe her.
Sherlock took several long deep breaths and tried to remain calm. He gripped the fabric of his trousers until his knuckles turned white, concentrating on breathing in and out, in and out.
In the corner of the room some debris had collected, including what Sherlock could tell were bits of organic matter dragged in from outside. If he could only examine it closer…
He felt sick to his stomache and the pounding in his head made it hard for him to concentrate on anything at all. John couldn't be dead. He couldn't! Bile began to rise in his throat and Sherlock's heart felt as though it were skipping beats.
“John is out of surgery,” he said, removing his glasses. “I’m going to be straightforward with you here, I don’t have very good news.”
No. NO! He wasn’t going to let this happen. They were going to get out of this. John would be okay. Just like a hundred other times they’d escaped near death.
But now he had a chance... a chance to get something back. And now Sherlock decided to talk. And why? To talk him out of it? Why? Why wouldn't he want John to jump at even the smallest of hopes?
"First," Dr. Azarian began, "there is no guarantee that this treatment will have any positive outcome. It would essentially be a blind gamble. If there is no compression injury, the intervention will be entirely ineffective."
“Well then,” he said, pushing himself up, “I suppose we should get some sleep. I don’t suppose you’ll want to search in the dark.”
"Well," Mrs. Hudson paused, clearly deciding how best to explain. "Sherlock can be quite charming when he needs to be. He has a bad habit of using that charm to get what he wants. I suppose a few aunts in the local villages have taken to describing that habit in rather flowery language."
“Dr. Watson,” she sounded highly surprised and a bit disapproving. “You should be in bed. Do you need a wheelchair?”
Behind her, a meek looking young woman with light brown hair shuffled into the room and cowered by the door. John glanced at her, then looked back to the towering woman.
Over the next several days, John noticed that Sherlock seemed quite distracted when he was in the house. He would alternate between rummaging amongst his newly organized files and books and playing the violin. John felt his heart leap every time Sherlock picked up the violin. But he soon found that, depending on his mood, the music he played could alternate between beauty personified in sound and headache inducing screeching. John could never predict which it would be, though he found that, to his intense displeasure, it tended to be the later anytime past midnight and before seven in the morning.
John complied. Their chests pressed together, their faces even closer now. They looked as though they were dancing a slow dance in primary school, faces close, bodies pressed together. John’s heart sped up and he could feel himself starting to sweat.
John watched as Sherlock made his way through the house, carefully inspecting certain objects or the floors or walls in what seemed to John an completely arbitrary manner.
Dr. Ramar stood without another word, handed John's chart to Dr. Azarian, and left the room as though nothing remarkable had just happened. Dr. Pakash followed him silently, shooting Sherlock a disapproving look on his way.
Sherlock continued reading the file, now completely ignoring Molly. She glanced over at John, clearly uncomfortable.
He had left before Mrs. Hudson could respond, eager to finally make some kind of progress on the spell.
Suddenly, John gets quiet. He gazes at Sherlock for a long moment, then he reaches forward and grabs his hand.
“It’s likely they will anyway,” Sherlock said. “Us being trapped together in a mine shaft for hours. Who knows what we could have gotten up to.”
Sherlock sat perched in an ugly, uncomfortable, infuriating plastic chair, his long legs tucked impossibly within its small confines and his elbows resting on his bent knees. He looked ready to pounce--a wire liable to spring at any moment.
John opened his eyes and saw two blurry figures leaving the clinic. He thought he saw the shorter figure hesitate, but before he could be certain, his vision seemed to narrow to a point and then all he saw was black.
“Simple really,” Sherlock said casually. “It was all a diversion. Robbery. They needed Wilson out of the way so they could break into his shop. Clever rouse though. Wasted mind, that Clay.”
Sherlock began shouting John’s name, while trying to dodge the debris that was still crashing around him and avoid inhaling too much smoke and dust. He was randomly picking through piles of debris without any real plan of action, trying hard not to hyperventilate in the process. John had been just inside the door, but Sherlock could see no sign of him.
"Is he...?" He let the question trail off, unable to voice the word as he looked back toward the hole, now swarming with rescue personnel and complicated equipment.
John found such stories exciting, though not particularly frightening. He knew he would never be in danger of an encounter with either the Heartless Wizard, as he had come to be known, or the Witch of the Wastes. It was not his fate to have such encounters. Nothing interesting ever happened to him.
Sherlock gently, but firmly pulled John up, his arm draped under John’s good shoulder and around his back. John tried to pull his good food under him, but almost immediately collapsed back into Sherlock.
"John," Sherlock was standing very still at the side of the bed, blocking the door and whoever had been there before. "John, it's me. It's okay. Can I touch you? Can I help you lay back down?"
He was shoved away almost immediately and John was gone. Buried beneath medical equipment just as he had been buried beneath rubble and carted off into an ambulance.
“I’m not letting you crawl upstairs,” Sherlock said finally. “Either let me pick you up, or I’ll do it anyway.”
After several weeks with no attacks, however, the villagers finally realized it was not the Witch. But reality, it turned out, was not much better than rumor. The moving castle belonged to the Wizard Holmes, a thoroughly heartless man known for stealing and eating the hearts of others.
Sherlock reached the gate and mumbled a few soft words to the guard, whose eyes glazed over. Sherlock motioned for John to follow and they slipped past the guard without incident.
“Oh, and Sherlock,” Scarecrow’s voice cut through his thoughts. “You have to stand on the leg where it is broke. Both feet. For five seconds. I’ll count.”
Sherlock heaved a sigh and set his bowl down near the fire before making his way to the door. He turned the wheel to red and opened the door. John craned his neck to see out and was only slightly surprised to find an entirely different street from the one outside the window. From his place near the fire, he could see little of the street outside, but what he did see were clearly colorful and rather expensive looking houses.
“There was a comminuted fracture,” he continued. “Part of the bone was shattered. There was muscle damage. Nerve damage.”
Another man entered the room once John was gone, rolling a laptop set up on a cart into the room and placing it in front of Sherlock. The laptop screen was off, but Sherlock had a bad feeling about what he was about to see on it. Whatever John’s
The morning of May Day, John found himself sitting on the edge of his bed, dressed and ready to go, but somehow unable to move. He cursed his injury, rubbing his forehead and trying to will himself up. By the time he had managed to leave the front door, the sun was already high in the sky and the festivities were in full swing.
John never returned to his own bed, even when his leg had healed enough for him to use the stairs again. He and Sherlock never discussed it. John simply remained in Sherlock’s bed, by Sherlock’s side. Neither of them wants to change this arrangement.
Sherlock felt John’s hand move again. The thumb in his trousers unhooked and he slowly—very slowly—moved the hand downward. Sherlock couldn’t stand it. He pulled away from John’s mouth just enough to move down to his throat, using his tongue the way John had just taught him, sucking, and even biting gently. John moaned.
There was an awkward silence in the room and John wished Sherlock would stop looking so guilty. It made his skin crawl. The expression looked foreign on Sherlock's face.
How could he have been so blind? How could he have missed it? It was so obvious! He detested sentiment.
John frowned, confused. His mind was sluggish and petulant and he didn't understand. Sherlock still refused to meed his gaze. He was staring instead at the place where John's leg would have been, if it hadn't been...
“Didn’t Mycroft ever take you as a kid?” He asked, clearly knowing how the mention of his brother would annoy him.
"Yes," Sherlock said, grinning wider. "There is only one ship currently docked in this town with that kind of sheathing and thus, only one with that type of graving. We know where our victim was killed."
"I'm Sherlock and this is my friend John. We are investigating the vampire case," Sherlock said without preamble. "We would like to have the body of the last victim--Cedric--examined by our pathologist."
An hour and a half progressed in much the same way. John moved slowly through the room, being as careful as he could. Nonetheless, he is now covered head to toe in his own blood. His clothes are in tatters. But Sherlock can see that the wounds are all superficial. But he’s still not moving quickly enough to reach the door in time.
How like John, Sherlock thought, recklessly rushing headlong into danger. He thought back to their first case together.
He was so caught up in tending to his breakfast that he didn't notice the door open until a voice broke his concentration.
Sherlock pressed the scarf into the gunshot wound on John’s Shoulder. John moaned but didn’t protest. Maneuvering the cloth expertly so that it remained bunched over the wound, but could also be wound around John’s shoulder, Sherlock carefully but forcefully tied the scarf into place.
John arrived at a lovely, large cottage surrounded by a beautifully cultivated garden out in the countryside. It looked idyllic -- like a picture in a book -- and John felt slightly guilty disturbing the picture of it by entering. Before he could hesitate long, however, his thoughts were interrupted by a boisterous and very familiar voice.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open. He was sitting in an uncomfortably stiff chair, his hands and legs tied at the wrists and ankles to the arms and legs of the chair. They were tied quite well—he couldn’t move them at all.
“That’s good, Sherlock,” Moriarty tells him. “Exactly as I would have chosen. The other option is much better for everyone involved anyway. And quite harmless. All John has to do is lie that and nobody gets hurt.”
“The damage was extensive, I’m afraid,” the doctor explained. “John is very lucky that the bullet missed any major arteries. He wouldn’t have made it otherwise.”
But there was a catch. Of course there was. There were two containers sitting between that painting and another. Each was equidistant to each painting, so it was impossible to tell which was supposed to go to which. The other painting was a more modern image Sherlock didn’t know, but the image depicted the Seraphim Barachiel, the Lighting of God. Electrocution. It had to mean that one of the containers would electrocute John.
John blinked and turned in the direction of Sherlock's voice. Sherlock and the hospital seemed to materialize around him like a dream. He was having trouble distinguishing what was reality. And he was shaking. And the bomb... And...
John found Sherlock surrounded by strange looking vials, some of which seemed to be smoking. He sighed, thinking of the mess he would soon have to clean and hoping Sherlock didn't destroy the house before he had the chance.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a voice cried out, “Here. He’s here!”  Instantly, Sherlock stumbled toward the voice, his heart skipping beats as he silently begged an entity in whom he didn’t even believe for John to be alive.
John didn't respond, but walked back outside with Irene in tow, thinking the small, white dog might be the only one with any sense in the cottage.
John sighed. Clearly he wasn't going to be getting a better answers. He glanced around nervously before following Sherlock up the steps, wincing as his cane made a soft noise on every step.
John winced, but because of his limp, he couldn’t ease his foot down. He had to put all of his weight directly on the foot the minute it contacted the ground. Sherlock heard the glass grind against itself and wanted to throw up. He watched as John took another step, leaving behind a bloody footprint.
He attempted to lean over and pick up the fruit but was unable to reach without falling over. He smiled apologetically.
"Sherlock, the ambulance is here," he said slowly, as though he wasn't certain Sherlock could understand him. "They'll want to check you out."
“You’ve made the right choice, Sherlock,” Moriarty said, laughing. “Wouldn’t want to let Sebastian hurt John.”
Mike laughed softly, "afraid not. I don't know of anybody who has a chance of catching her except that Wizard Holmes fellow."
The group stood gathered at the edge of the latest crime scene, a greusome tableu of destruction and gore. The culprit, whom Sherlock distainfully described as "inelegant," prefered to murder his victims by luring them into buildings laced with explosives--antics which not only garnered the attention of the Yard, but of most of London as well. Unsurprisingly, a small but ardently curious crowd had gathered around the borders of the police tape, creating just enough noise to be both annoying and distracting, though not enough to warrent disbursing them.
He was not wrong. Molly continued her examination, sometimes chatting with John, sometimes remaining quiet and focused. John stood leaning against the wall and his cane, trying not to yawn or nod off.
Sherlock can hear the fear and tension in his voice. It makes his heart clench. He looks around the room again, peering into darkened corners.
Sherlock half expected John to protest, as he usually did when people assumed they were on a date, but John simply smiled tightly at Angelo as he walked away.
John didn’t answer. He knew exactly what Sherlock was going to do and he knew exactly what it was going to feel like.
"That makes sense," Molly said. "I won't be able to get a tox screen from the blood, obviously. But I can try the tissue around the injection sites. I may be able to find something there."
“This was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. It appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. The hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate. You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it was an appointment,” the inspector explained.
He called up the image he had briefly seen of John through a large hole in what had once been the floor of the flats. He was mostly burried under a pile of what looked to be heavy rubble, but what Sherlock could see of him was covered in dust, burns, and...
John's eyes widened as he realized what had happened. Sherlock had been forced to sign the consent form to allow the amputation. His best friend had been the one forced to make the decision.
John looked back at the monitors. He thought back to the times he had been in hospital. He though about how annoyingly loud it was and about how it was impossible to actually get any rest. He thought about hearing the nurses chattering and messing about in the bed next you. He thought about the beeping monitors and alarms. He thought about the announcements coming over the speakers.
Sherlock had been the one waiting for him again. The one to get the news again. The one who had tried to talk him out of the stupid surgery in the first place. He was probably furious. He probably hated him now.
"I've already told you everything I know about his leg," the doctor said. "The scans we just performed do not appear to show any further damage, aside from a possible sprain in the left arm. We are sending them off for further analysis."
Then, blissfully, it stopped as suddenly as it began. John collapsed on the floor, shaking, but still breathing.
They made it about halfway down the hall before John had to turn back. But his determination was intense. Sherlock could see sweat dripping from his forehead and noticed how pale John had gotten, but he didn’t dare try to tell John to turn back until he was ready.
On this particular day, Sherlock hasn’t chosen a case yet. Instead, they sat in the sitting room, each in their respective armchairs. Sherlock read the paper and John read some silly fiction book.
Just as he broke the surface, taking a deep, gasping breath, he felt something take hold of his foot and pull him down. He kicked out, but whatever had hold of him was strong. He was pulled back underwater and felt panic rising in his chest as he felt something sting his leg and immediately felt his energy begin to drain out of his limbs.
"I mean," Dimmock said, shooting John a glare now, "that it literally is not possible. The body has already been creamated. There is nothing to examine."
He thought he felt John sigh into his mouth, but he must have been dreaming it. Or wishing it. His hand continued moving, gently crossing over John’s nipple, then resting on John’s side. He noticed, suddenly, that most of the tension had left John’s mouth and body. John seemed to relax further against Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock scrambled off of John, who was now lying limp beneath him. His lips were blue again, his skin cold and clammy, his breathing was rapid and shallow.
“I’m going to pull you up,” Sherlock said quietly. “You can keep your bad leg straight and I’ll help you drag it. Just lean on me.”
Until a doctor, looking overworked and worn, strode into the room calling for John's Watson's next-of-kin.
He examined the new wound. There was an entrance wound, but no exit wound. The bullet was still inside.
John’s lips responded immediately, parting just slightly to allow Sherlock’s bottom lip to rest between them. Sherlock brought his hand up to rest on John’s face, cupping his cheek gently in his palm. John’s good hand was suddenly in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock let out an involuntary, small moan into John’s mouth. He moved so that he was sitting above John and put his other hand on John’s neck. He could feel John’s pulse under his hand—quickened. His eyes were dilated. His hand gripped Sherlock’s hair more tightly. Sherlock closed his eyes.
Sherlock had propped John up against the wall of the mine, in order to make it easier for him to breathe.
Sherlock had only glanced at the scene before launching into his explanation. He finished his monologue by pointing, nonchalantly, to the murderer, who, upon noticing the attention of the entire Yard, immediately bolted.
Sherlock had tried questioning Jacol, but to little effect. The man remained tight lipped and stubbornly silent.
"I'm sorry," he heard a low voice mumble from seemingly far away as he drifted off into darkness again.
Sherlock sighed. He was being honest. He had no idea what he was supposed to say. But Scarecrow had asked a question, so he supposed he should start there.
Sherlock stared through the darkness toward the voice. Really? Could it really be this simple? John wouldn’t be hurt. A little uncomfortable, but Sherlock would simply kiss his cheek quickly and get it over with. No big deal.
“Thank you for the ride,” John said, maneuvering himself to the edge of the seat and opening the door.
"But, how will we know who to question?" John asked. "Without Detective Dimmock's help, all we have is the latest victim's information."
When they arrived, the tunnel was flooded with light and noise. Paramedics quickly swarmed John’s limp body, checking vitals, applying a neck brace, and putting him on a field stretcher. Another set of paramedics swarmed Sherlock, but he batted them away angrily, trying to keep his eyes trained on John.
Taking a breath, Sherlock turned to John again. His John. So strong, but put through so much. Too much, it seemed. It was over. There was nothing he could do. He hadn’t been able to save him. He had failed.
Sherlock released John’s neck, noting the marks already beginning to form them. As expected, John did not begin breathing again nor did he regain consciousness.
"Why!" he growled. "Why did he sign those damned consent forms? Why did he agree to the surgery? It makes no sense!"
“The next few years were… difficult,” John continued. “I didn’t dare mess around with any more boys. But my father… he’d got it in his head that he had to beat that out of me. And he tried… often. That’s why I joined the army when I was 18. I needed to get out.”
And with a shudder that went through his entire body, Sherlock moved the knife to his left hand, and pushed the fingers of his right hand into the wound.
A falling star? Was it possible to catch a falling star? John wouldn't be surprised if it were, but how.
At least Sherlock had finally spoken, John thought. In the past few days, Sherlock had said no more than twenty words to John. He knew this because he had started a mental tally after he noticed Sherlock being distant.
"Open up!" he said, using his cane to bang on the door while trying to balance on the small platform as the castle continued to sluggishly move forward.
“I’m an old man now,” he said happily. “I’m afraid I need my sleep. Please do let me know if you need anything and make yourself at home. What’s mine is yours.”
John looked terrified. He was staring at nothing as though in a trance. His hand, which had fallen to the bed from Sherlock’s hair, was clenched in a fist. Any hint of an erection was gone.
"I knew it would happen this way," Lestrade said, sounding resigned. "I had to try anyway. The king is having a fit. He's threatening to invade Strangia. He's convinced they have taken her hostage. There are already skirmishes and the only way we are going to prevent a full on war is to find the princess."
“Oh, and John,” the voice continued, “please do stand on both legs. Without that silly plank there.”
John hadn't even known he had moved. He had been so captivated by the story and the stranger who told it. His pale, angular face surrounded by those dark curls. And his eyes--so intense and such a captivating color.
“He’s got a collapsed lung,” Sherlock yelled, turning back toward the voice. “You’re asking me to kill him. He’d never survive that.”
One of the men--tall and thin with what Sherlock thought was a rather bored expression--straightened in his chair and took John's chart from Dr. Azarian.
things, despite his best efforts to avoid sentiment. How John had limped into his life and change it--change
John was sitting in his bed, his hand to his ear, an irritated expression on his face. But he had looked at the door when Sherlock entered. He had heard the door open.
“Welcome to your first puzzle,” Moriarty said cheerfully. “As a favor to Johnny and to you as well, my dear Sherlock, I have made John’s first puzzle more of a physical test, rather than a strictly mental one.”
Getting through the crowd was a challenge. John’s leg and shoulder made navigating the crowd difficult. He was jostled and almost knocked over multiple times. Sherlock noticed that John had tensed up significantly. Sherlock wasn’t surprised. He would be tense too if he were in danger of being reinjured by carless idiots. Sherlock did his best to shield John as they made their way through the crowd to their seats.
“Take it slow,” Sherlock was sitting next to the bed on one of the uncomfortable chairs, his body tensed as he readied himself to catch John should he fall… again.
“Don’t try to talk,” Sherlock soothed. “You’re on a respirator. You won’t be able to talk for a while. Just relax. And get better.”
Finally, he opened his eyes and glanced around. The room in which he found himself was apparently a den or a living area, though it was difficult to tell. Every surface was covered with boxes and papers and strange, unidentifiable items. In the corner, beside the fire, sat what looked disturbingly like a human skull.
"Ill let him know we're finished here if I see him then," he said, taking John's chart back and smiling kindly at John.
John’s body began jerking beneath him. Sherlock cursed under his breath. He knew that when convulsions occur, the EEG findings are very similar to a very short epileptic seizure.
The witch narrowed her eyes and stepped forward so that they were only a step away from one another.
Sherlock knew this. He couldn’t help but keep track of the days since then, counting them down like a timer, hoping for the day when they would both be completely free of that warehouse.
John pulled the wire and the net fell, covering the woman, who immediately began struggling and growling. Sherlock dropped the mirror carefully and moved over to the net, mumbling something under his breath. John followed, uncertain exactly what had just happened.
"There is nothing to do," Sherlock grumbled. "She's on my trail and the curse has already been placed."
"Oh," Sherlock said, following his gaze. "Homeless network. Much faster than the detectives and far easier to bribe. We should have a lead on our vampire soon."
He deepened this kiss, gently parting John’s lips with his own and tasting them with his tongue. John’s mouth obediently opened for him. He found John’s tongue with his own, gently tasting it. John responded by moving his tongue along with Sherlock’s. He pulled Sherlock’s face closer, as though he couldn’t get close enough.
John moved as quickly as he could toward the slowly moving castle, trying to ignore the aches and pains the movement caused. Nonetheless, by the time he reached the castle, night had long fallen and the cold was penetrating into his bones.
They walked (and dragged) for several long minutes. John was shaking now, try as he might to hide it from Sherlock, he was failing. Sherlock was feeling the effort in his own body as well. He stopped, reviewing where they were in the mines in his head.
"Oh," Mrs. Hudson laughed. "I suppose you must know him as Wizard Holmes. Dreadful name, if you ask me. Well then, are you the wizard's date?"
Sherlock pauses. He stares at John through the laptop. He is still laying on the bed, covered in injuries and bleeding profusely. Beside him Sebastian is looking at him with hunger evident in his expression. He seems totally unconcerned with his fate—focused instead entirely on John. He seems to be eyeing John’s crotch.
"For the witness we are going to be interviewing," he said, moving to John with several of the books. "Read these."
Finally, they burst through the trees and into a large clearing, which looked like a honeycomb or a pockmarked face.
As the days passed with no new cases, however, Sherlock became more and more restless. John could hardly get a word out of him and he did nothing but tend to his experiments and sulk.
Before long, it was time for the show to start. Sherlock relaxed into his chair, hoping John would be able to do the same and maybe even enjoy the show.
"That's what I though," Sherlock said softly, moving the man's hair. "There are more, hidden in the hair. Several dozen of them."
Moriarty had been his commander for a number of years now and Sebastian couldn’t be happier with the arrangement. Did Moriarty periodically put him in extreme danger? Of course. That’s what he loved about him. Had he offered him up to Sherlock Holmes as some sort of consolation prize? Sure, but Sebastian couldn’t blame him. It would have been worth it to have five minutes torturing John Watson.
John continued fidgeting with the small gadgets. They were miniscule--hardly noticeable unless you were looking for them. But Sherlock could already see that John was self-conscious of them. He thought about saying something encouraging, but that wasn't really his area. He stayed quiet and moved over to the bed instead.
Sherlock watched John's expression shift from resigned despair to shocked disbelief and, finally, to hope.
John had spent much of his time while recuperating teasing Sherlock about the restorative powers of his kiss. It had taken Sherlock an amusingly long time to realize John was kidding, which did serve as a source of amusement for a while. But, as much as he joked about his fairy tale prince coming to his rescue, his leg had only regained moderate sensation and motor function. And, though it appeared to improve over time and with much effort, he would never regain full function in the limb, however many times Sherlock kissed him. Thus, although his the bone and tissue damage had healed, John still struggle with range of motion and holding weight on his right leg, which made walking difficult.
He had sighed and reached for John's leg, keeping his attention on John's face so that he would know if he needed to stop. But when he place his hand on the leg, John didn't react at all. Sherlock was surprised. He had grimaced and groaned pitifully when he touched his left arm, which has suffered significantly less trauma. He cautiously moved the leg, still watching John's face for signs of pain, but still John did not react. Sherlock frowned, unsettled.
Dawning settled on Sebastian. His chest tightened. Did Sherlock really intend to just let him rot away in boredom in this little cell? Was he really not going to take revenge? How could he not want to hurt him?
Sherlock took the hand on John’s cheek and moved it to John’s hair, taking a handful. John let out a breath into Sherlock’s mouth. He moved the hand on John’s neck down slowly. First, resting on John’s good shoulder, then moving to his chest, where he lingered for a moment, relishing the rise and fall of John’s quickened breaths.
Sherlock hadn’t left the hospital since he’d arrived. Lestrade had urged him to go to a hotel, get a night’s sleep and a shower. But Sherlock had refused. John was in and out of consciousness and he didn’t want John to wake up alone, even for a moment.
He stood and scanned the room carefully. His eyes landed on piles of material clearly used in the recent construction project. Stone… useless. Metal bars… too long, not wide enough. Wood planks… maybe.
John was silent a moment, thinking hard. Sherlock nervously scanned the darkness around them, listening intently for any sign of their killer.
, Sherlock thought. John wasn’t exactly good at sharing his emotions. Maybe this would be harder than he thought.
Sherlock prepared himself. John was going to lay into him. Or worse, simply tell him that he never wanted to speak again.
The fire did not respond. He added a log, but to no effect. He began to look concerned, something John had only seen when he had been injured by the ghost.
John followed, grabbing his cane and coat. Sherlock turned the door to black and stepped into the nothing. Hesitating just slightly, John followed, eyes closed and heart racing.
John was several paces ahead of him, apparently making his way without a care in the world. Although he had been stationed in a desert, he clearly knew how to make his way around a forest.
Sherlock felt dizzy. He looked back down at John. John was staring at him, grim-faced and determined.
But he can’t see any tools. He doesn’t even see a gun. Instead, Sherlock stands before him totally unarmed. And he’s smiling sweetly.
Sherlock shot a glare at Lestrade and continued pacing. His mind wouldn’t stop racing. It was jumping from going over what had happened in the last 24 hours to what was likely happening to John right now. He tried not to think about what had just happened to them, but he was having trouble keeping the memories from invading his consciousness. So, he tried to think of anything that might help him find the monster. Scarecrow.
"Yes," Sherlock said promptly. "Please write the details here--your uncle's name, his address, anywhere you saw him with the woman."
"Where else?" Sherlock reached a hand into the hole and tugged out a rope ladder, which had apparently been dangling just to the side of the hole.
Sherlock growled. He might as well shoot John. At least then John’s blood wouldn’t be on his hands. If he choked John… He couldn’t kill John with his own hands. He couldn’t.
"I'm afraid we haven't much time," Dr. Azarian replied. "The longer we wait, the higher the chance that any possible compression injury is causing irreparable damage."
Sherlock sighed. He explained to John which corner of the room to approach and John obediently (and painfully) pushed himself up from the floor and moved to that corner. Sherlock indicated the two metal boxes. John nodded.
He collapsed to the ground, groaning in pain and clutching his right leg with his one good arm. From what seemed like a great distance, he felt an hand on his back and heard a voice in his ear.
Sherlock handed John the first aid kit while Mrs. Hudson ‘tsked’ their dangerous escapades. As he opened the kit and gingerly pulled off his top, trying not to jar his bad shoulder, he could feel Sherlock's eyes on him. He tried to ignore it and began working on his side.
When the door opened, John heard Sherlock’s soft, "oh," and leaned over to see exactly what he had expected. The scarecrow was back and trying again, just as persistently, to make its way into the castle.
John read it over and over, but came no closer to deciphering its meaning. He thought back to what Sherlock had said about spells:
Sherlock moved on to his head, the next area that concerned him greatly. Blood pooled around his head and Sherlock gently moved John’s head to the side to find the wound.
He paused outside the door to John's room, leaned against the wall and breathed again. In and out. Then he started walking.
John had never been happier to see a front door in his life. After several weeks in hospital, followed by seemingly endless physical therapy in another facility, he had begun to despair of ever seeing the front door of 221 Baker Street again. He stared up at it from the back of the cab as though it were a fabled portal to faraway lands.
"You suffered another pneumothorax on the table," he began, his voice monotone, "causing you to go into respiratory arrest. A chest tube was inserted to re-inflate your lung, but the surgeons could not get your oxygen levels elevated enough and you went into cardiac arrest. The surgeons revived you, but they were unable to maintain your oxygen levels and you suffered two more cardiac arrests. They could not continue with your at surgery, of course."
He closed his eyes, trying to figure out where to begin. Should he think about what his recovery process would likely look like? Or why he was feeling so resentful toward Sherlock? Or how his hearing loss might affect their cases? Or his leg? Or...
John looked confused as well. He had clearly expected something just as damaging as the other dares they had endured so far. What was this Scarecrow getting at?
Dr. Azarian gave them both a polite smile and left the room, leaving behind a heavy silence and two men, staring at one another.
When Sherlock returned, the castle had moved to the other side of the valley and back again and Mrs. Hudson appeared to be little more than an ember.
Sherlock was staring at the chart, trying to read it. It was just John’s basic information. Nothing useful. He needed the doctor to get to the point.
“He’s in the best hands possible,” the man said kindly. “You have to leave him to us now. You did an excellent job, but now it’s our turn.”
Months have passed since the warehouse. John’s body has recovered as well as it is going to, which, considering the circumstances, is actually pretty well. He has regained more sensation in his left arm and can even use it sometimes for simple tasks. His leg still causes him pain, but he only experiences minimal pain in his hip when he walks and he has become quite adept at using his cane now. He’s even used it as a weapon on more than one occasion during a case. He might be a bit slower than before, but he makes do well enough. And Sherlock is always cognizant of John’s abilities, making adjustments in his plans when necessary to suite John’s strengths.
"Oh really?" she said and John was, inexplicably, reminded of a cat. "Well, what exactly are you good for then?"
“Chalk,” Sherlock said, smiling. “A very specific kind of chalk. A specific kind of chalk found in this forest. In a Neolithic mine.”
He sighed, though the act made his chest ache. He hadn't meant what he'd said. At least, he hadn't meant it to come out that way. He just wanted Sherlock to leave--to go do something, not sit stagnant by his bed waiting. There was no reason for Sherlock to be trapped here as well. How long could Sherlock stand the boredom? How long before he resented John for the boredom?
"And yet," Dr. Azarian's voice surprised Sherlock as he continued, "I asked them to reconsider their recommendations when they examined Dr. Watson's injury before we came to you, Mr. Holmes. Unfortunately, they declined to do so. As they have said, crush injuries like Dr. Watson's come with many potentially serious complications. And we have no guarantee that he would have full use of the leg if we were to save it."
Sebastian’s hand moved down to John’s crotch above his pants. He was stroking. John had frozen, not moving a muscle. His face had gone blank, and his eyes were distant.
"Mr. Holmes?" her voice had a false cheeriness meant to mask the exhaustion that showed through her slumped posture and drooping eyelids.
Sherlock put one arm around John’s back and used the other to gently push him backwards so he could see his face. John fell back into his arm. His eyes were closed. His breathing shallow. He checked his pulse—even weaker than before.
"Right," he said, making his way slowly forward again and trying to calculate the distance to the next village.
After a long few minutes, Moriarty moved to the laptop and pressed a button. The laptop screen lit up and Sherlock saw John, sitting, clothed, but barefooted, untied and unblindfolded in a chair at the back of a medium-sized, unknown room. Behind him was the door through which he must have been brought into the room. It was almost certainly locked. On the other side of the room was another door under a large timer. The timer read two hours.
Detective Dimmock had been less than pleased with the outcome of their case and seemed not to believe their explanation in the least. John had been quite annoyed, but Sherlock seemed not to care in the least.
Sherlock frowned. What was he thanking him for? He had put him in danger yet again, had allowed him to be tortured again, had even given permission for John to be shot because he was too weak to watch him being violated.
John woke with a start, drenched in sweat and struggling to scream--to warn Sherlock not to come nearer. But his lungs refused to cooperate. He couldn't scream--couldn't make any sound at all. Panicking, he pressed himself forward, trying instead to get to Sherlock, but something was in the way. He could feel his control slipping as he struggle to move.
Ignoring this, Sherlock reached for the items sitting next to him. Moving as quickly as possible, he removed John’s shirt, exposing his chest. The bruises on his ribcage made Sherlock wince, but he continued without pause.
John fought harder against the fog and succeeded in opening a bleary eye. Sherlock was standing over him. He grinned slightly when John looked at him, so he forced his other eye open as well.
Sherlock returns his attention to John, who is panting on the floor. He looks as closely as he can manage. He can tell some of the cuts are quite deep and require stitches. John needed medical attention again already. If those cuts were left open, it would be possible for John to bleed out after a while. He had no idea how long this game would last or what more John would have to endure. John needed to find something to treat his wounds.
“20 seconds,” the voice laughed. “I think you might have been right Sherlock. Poor Dr. Watson doesn’t appear to be taking this well.”
"Palace officials are paid well," Sherlock continued. "And one particular employee would have easy access to a greenhouse with plenty of space."
“Oh,” Moriarty continued, “and you should also know, there is a bomb rigged into the safe. If you input an incorrect combination, the safe will explode and kill John instantly.”
“What?” Sherlock’s breath left him in a rush. He had to be kidding. There was no way he was going to do that to John.
“Is it really that important that your little pet not be sullied again?” Moriarty asked, genuinely curious.
"Fine," Mycroft said, defeat evident in his tone. "I'll get the paperwork in order to have you listed as John's next-of-kin promptly."
“Well, it’s a simple enough game,” Scarecrow continued. “You choose to either truthfully answer a question or perform a task I set for you.”
Sherlock calculated. He was nervous. John’s turn had been so mild. What was Scarecrow building up to? He had to be doing something. If he chose dare now, he was certain he would be given a task that would hurt John again. And, given how simple the last task was, it was bound to be rough. But he wanted John to take the truths. It would be easier for him not to have to do dares. But, then again, Sherlock’s dares all targeted John anyway. And John could really use a break. Honestly, so could Sherlock.
Behind him was danger--bullets and explosives and pain and death. In front of him was... Sherlock? No, that couldn't be right. Why would Sherlock be in Afghanistan?
Sherlock had already walked up and down the stairs a million times in order to accidentally encounter this “new” acquaintance, he was about to give up this stupid idea when John finally appeared by the front door.
“Well, It’s more like he mingles in our cases and I try to keep him away from dangerous business,” Lestrade replied.
shorts that emphasised John’s strong tights of well-defined muscles due to years of playing rugby. It took Sherlock’s breath away.
Sherlock decided that the last week of September would be lovely, the days would still be warm but not as much as in the heat of August and the sunset would happened late in the evening, giving them enough time per day to explore and enjoy their activities.
They wouldn’t need to take the plane but the ferry, which was longer than the plan but felt more adventurous. Besides, Sherlock loved the ferry, it made his inner younger pirate self delighted.
Sherlock tried to focus back on his book but it was hopeless, John was too much tempting in his swimming shorts, especially his bottom. The detective put his book down, and start running towards John. When he passed him though, he didn't stop and simply shout,“race you to the water!”
John returns his attentions to Sherlock’s lips at that, but he’s a little gentler now, and the kiss doesn’t last nearly as long as Sherlock would want it to before John pulls away, actually pulls away, extricating himself from Sherlock’s arms and sitting up.
is a mess. It’s all him, isn’t it? He’s the one who has to fix it. He has to fix it before he can even begin to be a friend to Sherlock worthy of the name, let alone contemplate being anything else.
“Sherlock,” John says, standing up from his table hastily. His voice sounds croaky and hesitant. Sherlock says nothing – what is he supposed to say? They stare at each other some more, oblivious to the bustle of the coffee shop around them. Sherlock sees John’s sleepless night in the bags around his, the struggle of feeding Rosie this morning in the baby food stain on his collar, his apprehension in his clenched fist, his resolve in his carefully close shave. He sees John taking him in in turn, and he realises now that deducing how Sherlock spent the night is beyond John’s abilities. To John, there’s only one reason why Sherlock could have been out all night wearing uncharacteristic clothes, and sure enough, John’s eyebrows draw together.
“Adorable and hot,” John added, burying his hands in Sherlock hair to ruffle it even more and bring Sherlock’s head down to kiss him again. John’s tongue was slick and hot as it licked into Sherlock’s mouth, his lips hungry, but nothing about the way he kissed Sherlock felt insistent or demanding – it was more like an offering, all his love and desire laid out for Sherlock to take whatever he wanted from it.
“Hm,” John says, a lot of judgment in such a brief syllable. “And I bet you haven’t showered or eaten anything today, have you? You know, you could at least
“John,” Sherlock blinks as if he isn’t quite sure John’s there, and his voice is utterly dull. John’s worry increases exponentially. He steps closer.
