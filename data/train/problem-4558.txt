He lays the spoon down and dabs his mouth with a paper towel. Dean knits his brow together. "I didn't mean‚Äîyou can eat as much as you want, Cass."
"Seriously? That lite crap? Come on, man. Live a little."
"Shit! I'm sorry." He pulls away and gets up from the bed.
"I haven't touched a single drop of alcohol for months, and since my last rehab, I haven't felt the urge. I drank to forget, to numb my feelings. I don't need that anymore." Something gnaws in the rear of his mind at his own words but Castiel ignores it. He knows he isn't lying.
"Sorry. I was just thinking."
"How come? They don't sack you, do they?" Dean asks, clearly agitated.
Castiel smiles at him with so much warmth that Dean feels like welling up again.
Castiel nods and pushes his lunch box in front of Kevin. "When did you eat last?" Kevin shrugs. "Where do you sleep?"
"I know that this is a spectacularly stupid idea, kiddo. But what am I supposed to do? He's been looking for two weeks now. No one is taking him because of his past. I can hardly look for a new roommate while leaving my boyfriend to hang out to dry, can I?"
"That means steak, or salad with bacon. Or maybe both, if I'm lucky." Dean grins.
"Nah. I wouldn't embarrass you in front of your new family." It's enough that Dean embarrassed himself.
Dean nods. "I don't know why. Everything is fine and then we fight from one second to the next. I never fought with one of my exes this much. I thought it would be easier this time, but it's worse."
"Really? They weren't 'unsettling'."
"Dean, you're drunk."
It started with a tiny Grogu plushie that Castiel brought home from shopping after Dean had gently forced him to watch
"Okay," Dean breathes, reining in another moment of panic. This is going to be fine.
"It's okay," Castiel says. "I understand."
Sam raises an eyebrow. "Don't tell me you already snubbed him."
Missouri chuckles, sounding as if she can't believe that he truly thinks that. "Then he ain't worth his salt and not the right man for you. But I can tell ya‚Äîhe's just as scared as you are. But he's happy with ya, too."
"Mother, father, this is my boyfriend Dean," Castiel introduces them, and Dean can't help but bow his head and divert his eyes when they shake hands.
Rowena raises a single eyebrow and quirks her mouth into a warm smile. "A gentleman. We don't come across those often enough." Three men start protesting immediately. The Scot laughs. "Those who feel addressed should reflect on why they do so," Rowena retorts with a wide grin and greets everyone with a stout-hearted hug.
"And deprive me of how handsome you look in a suit? I'm not stupid.‚ÄîBut seriously..."
"You'll be here in California, and I'll be back in Kansas. We'll be lucky if we see each other on Christmas."
Charlie shakes her head. "It's outside of his eating window."
He hasn't eaten all day. Dean won't be amused. But he's here to pick him up for a celebratory feast at the Crossroads. So his stomach will soon enough be filled with burgers and fries.
"Have you seen each other since the break-up?"
"He's my brother. I know him better than anyone and this‚Äî" He gestures in the engaged couple's direction. "This isn't the man I raised."
Dean wants to correct him but decides to leave it be. It's better when his buddy thinks he and Castiel went all the way. He hits Benny's butt with a tea towel and grins at him. "Don‚Äôt be jealous, only because I never cared to fuck you when you were still working at the Gas-N-Sip."
"O-okay. I'll fly alone then." He chuckles without mirth. "It's probably for the better. You might break up with me right then and there because I put you through dinner with my family instead of spending time with your brother," he tries to joke, but his voice wavers and tears prick his eyes.
Kevin smiles at him, his eyes lighting up for the very first time. 'He could be my kid,' Castiel thinks as he watches him eat.
for betaing this story. I wouldn't be so far on my writing and self-discovery journey if I wouldn't have met you. üñ§üê®ü§çüíú
Castiel nods. "The fleshlight really seemed to do it for you. I'm sorry. This was the last time I threw myself on you. I promise. I'm sorry that I turn you off." He moves to get off the bed, but Dean catches his arm.
Dean needs to look away. He feels like shattering into a million pieces. "Will you break up with me?" he asks, his voice as thin as cheap parchment paper.
Castiel's eyes grow impossibly softer and his lips curl up a little further. "Do
"Got three and a half hours of sleep today. Without energy drinks, I wouldn't sit upright."
They fall silent for a long moment, and Dean takes the last gulp of his beer. Castiel bites his lip to keep himself from commenting on Dean's drinking habits. It's probably just because he's sober for a little over four months now that Dean's regular alcohol consumption looks excessive to him. He doesn't want to read too much into it.
Dean licks his lip, unsure about what to say. So he nods. Hell, these people have an intimidating aura. He feels sorry for little Cass. He surely hasn't gotten much love in his childhood.
"I only realised when she texted me birthday wishes at midnight and asked what she should bring today."
Mrs Novak clears her throat. "We're not in a peasant pub, Crowley," is all she says.
Castiel straightens in the passenger seat and lets his eyes roam over the mansion in front of them. The huge complex is lit up like a Christmas tree. Castiel shakes his head. He doubts that they are using energy-saving lightbulbs.
"He brought home an empty lunch box and thanked me for the delicious food. So..."
Hannah pulls her brother into her arms and presses him so close that he gasps for air. "Godspeed! You get him home safely, Dean. Do you hear me?"
"You never cared about Sam and I doing it," Rowena points out.
Castiel gives him a sad smile. "I know." He brushes over Dean's blanket-covered leg. "I already organised the outpatient treatment, and Charlie and I will take turns. He'll be fine."
Castiel shrugs, his cheeks dusted in a soft pink. "I saw it and thought of you."
Dean raises an eyebrow. "First day of work and already long hours?"
Dean nods and takes the jar from his hand. "Thanks," he says. He already counts the hours until they can leave this godforsaken place.
Castiel doesn't miss the faint blush on Dean's cheeks or the disbelieving look on Jo's face. He chews his lip. Did he just out his boyfriend? But why would Dean take him on a date to a place where he's thought of as straight?
Dean gets in the row in front of him and leans against the window. "Beat, huh?"
Dean is smart. He recognises a lost cause when he sees it. "I thought you wanted it, too. I'm sorry, man."
It's not the first time that Dean would pretend to be a needy bottom. He did that plenty with one-night stands. And Castiel deserves this. Hell, who knows? Maybe he's even one of the few people who don't make Dean's erections go down as soon as they touch him.
Castiel swirls around, the skin around his eyes pulled taught. "I must be a really bad kisser if you think I didn't want it, that I didn't want you."
Lisa opens the door to Castiel's office and leans against the doorframe. "There's a man stalling in aisle two for more than an hour by now. Jody thinks he's homeless. Should we throw him out or‚Ä¶?"
"Why? And who?"
A concerned look slips through Dean's tight control, but then his Cheshire cat grin is back as if nothing happened. Castiel can't ponder what went through his boyfriend's mind because his phone starts ringing when they exit the bus together. He hums his responses before he ends the call with, "Okay. I'll figure something out. Thanks, Missouri." He breathes a sigh.
But then he was there, so real and so close, and asked him how he was. He could hardly explain that the man he had shared a room with for the past month was arrested for murder in the middle of the night, and that he still can't enter his own room because the police sealed it.
She made Hannah cross-stitch it, and then she displayed it proudly in the living room for everyone to see and learn by heart.
"What?"
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints. "This is your body, and its reaction is perfectly fine. You are aroused. Just from kissing me. I take it as a compliment." His lips twitch slightly. "It's okay, Dean. I know that you have a sex drive. It's fine."
nightstand." With that, Castiel leaves, and Dean tries to push away the weird sense of loss.
Guilt washes through Castiel like a tidal wave. "I'm so sorry, Hannah, I never wanted‚Ä¶"
Charlie nods. "For what it's worth, I think you're right. He's overdoing it. Yesterday, I watched him staring at his phone for five minutes with a sandwich right in front of him. He only ate it when the alarm went off, even though his stomach was rumbling before. You know, people who are prone to addiction often show this trait in other, even healthier parts of their lives. Could it be that he replaced the alcohol with controlling his eating habits?"
Castiel uses it to flee from the impending talk, but he sees the taillights of the earlier bus when he reaches the bus stop. He ponders briefly to walk home, but with no bed waiting for him, he just hangs his head in defeat.
Dean's face morphs into a frown. "What? Your exes never took you on dates?"
The older brother shakes his head. "I don't belong here, Sammy." Another squeeze. "And I can't afford to take off so much to drive over."
"Thank you, Castiel."
'Everybody wants to feel wanted, Dean,' he hears Lisa say. And he wants Castiel. Wants him so much. Wants to be
"Blow me, Cass!" he grinds out. That guy is getting under his skin. Why, he doesn't know. Maybe because he's right.
Okay, no quickie then. "Sure, babe." Dean presses a kiss into the soft flesh of Castiel's thigh and pushes himself up to kiss him on the lips. He loses himself in it before his hand sneaks down to his semi-hard dick and pulls a few times until it's filling out. He fetches the lube from the bedside drawer and starts opening Castiel up. His fingers glide with ease, and as always, Dean is in awe about how quickly his boyfriend can be prepped. He himself always needs more coaxing.
Castiel gives him a sad smile. "I had my suspicions, but I didn't think it was that bad. And when he said he just had to sleep his sickness off‚Ä¶" He shrugs in a helpless gesture. "I should've called you earlier."
Castiel shakes his head. "Couldn't."
"He gave you alcohol but not enough money to feed yourself and your brother‚Äîa task that should have been his job anyway. It's not funny, Dean. This is child neglect and abuse. It doesn't matter if he played gee-gees with you when you were a toddler. If he couldn't care for his kids after your mother's death, he should've let somebody do his job."
After his toes stop aching, he tries to pile them up again. It's a Sisyphean task and it doesn't take long until Dean feels trapped in a slapstick scene. Whenever he thinks he has managed to produce a stable pyramid, one side gives out.
Dean's tears are falling freely now. Castiel will leave. He will see how pathetic Dean is and go. Dean will have to find a new job. But that's the smallest of his problems.
. I mean I can give my partner pleasure but, most of the time I can't even make myself come." He blushes fiercely but he needs his boyfriend to understand. "I'm ace. I'm asexual."
Castiel looks at him, concern clear in his eyes. "Where did your mind stray?"
Dean shrugs. "It's what it is." He looks at the picture frame on the desk, the last photograph of him and his mother. He brushes a finger over her face and shakes his head. "Can we talk about family crap another time?"
"How much did you drink this time?" he murmurs. He has seen Dean drunk three times by now, but usually, his boyfriend is just a big, tired teddy bear. Castiel tries to get Dean off to his bedroom. He's just glad that Charlie isn't home. Dean would die of embarrassment if he knew that his best friend found him naked on the tiles.
Castiel knows the house, its broken windows and strange graffiti that some ghostbusters left behind. "No coat?" Kevin shakes his head and runs his fingers over the rim of Castiel's lunchbox. "Eat," Castiel says softly, enjoying the way Kevin digs in. "I'll get you a burrito and some pie from the front."
"I missed you," he simply replies.
"Aye-aye, boss." She smirks.
"It is, Dean."
Dean presses a kiss into Castiel's hair. "Can't wait to meet 'im. But I'm beat. Let's get some sleep, angel. Tomorrow's a big day."
Dean hums contentedly when he feels Castiel's hand run up and down his back, soothingly. He could die happy like this.
Dean looks down at his purple, pink and blue flannel. "You're kidding me!"
Taking care of, Dean has. It's the only good thing about Castiel's night shifts. Every time, Dean feels like a traitor, though. It's not that he hasn't masturbated in the past. It's just that he's ashamed of thinking about his boyfriend whenever he does it. And on top of feeling like a liar about the label that he so proudly claimed, he feels guilty about not wanting Castiel sexually in real life, too.
Castiel presses his lips together but a smile tugs on their corners. This is so Hannah that it warms his heart. They stay silent for a long while. It's comfortable. Some things never seem to change, and Castiel is thankful for it. He missed his little sister.
"Business." Castiel snickers. "Since when are auto parts sold at the farmers' market?" he asks and walks to the kitchen to put on the kettle.
Lisa looks over to Castiel, their eyes meeting. "I'm happy that he is more understanding than I was." Her eyes grow glassy with unshed tears. "You deserve someone who accepts you, who embraces and loves you just as you are."
Castiel nods and switches the electric kettle on. "Met him working here."
"What? Do I have something on my face?" Everyone just smiles at him. It's unsettling, as if his friends had been cast for 'The Stepford Wives'.
"Dean!" he exclaims when his boyfriend sticks his head through the doorframe. "What are you doing here?"
"No, please. Let me finish. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I read a lot about it. I'm much more informed now, and I understand that I did you wrong in assuming that you weren't really in love with me. I always thought that sex was the basis of true love, and I thought being ace meant to hate it. I didn't believe you, and for that, I'm sorry."
"Why are you nervous, Hannah? Is something bothering you?"
Dean is smiling at him over the roof of his car, beautiful and free. Castiel brushes a finger over his face before he flips his work laptop open and dives into the world of numbers, statistics, and supply chains.
Castiel takes a selfie and sends it to Hannah. She's the only one of his siblings who stuck by him when things got off the rail. She's paying his phone bill, too. His sister answers right back with celebration emojis galore. She may be a bit prickly sometimes, but she's his biggest cheerleader, always was, always will be.
"Sam loves you. He talks about you all the time. It felt like I knew you before we even met. And the rest? Let's say, kindred souls recognise each other."
"I think it kept him sane last week," she states, watching Dean's reaction carefully. "It wasn't easy on him that you didn't let him stay every free minute."
Castiel scowls at him for a long moment, then he deflates. "Okay. Thank you."
Dean interrupts him with a kiss. He hopes it says what his mouth can't form words for. He puts all his love in it, all longings that only Castiel can sate, all his wishes for a future together.
It's so frustrating!
Dean lowers the plate he's cleaning back into the rinse water and leans his hip against the counter. "You're considering it? You've only worked there for a few months."
"Yeah. Just need some air," Dean all but spits and heads for the door.
"Castiel."
They stand there for a long moment until the bathroom door opens. "Hey, no sex in the toilets."
He takes a large gulp from his diet coke. "The sandwiches were enough to keep me full all day." Castiel gives him a small smile before taking another bite.
"Beware of him. He's a trickster." Dean raises a questioning eyebrow. "He's the alloest of allos, dips his toes into shady business now and then. He has a good heart, though. He's just‚Äî" He shrugs. "Gabriel."
Maybe it's the antidepressants he's taking. They can raise the libido, the patient information leaflet said. Was he simply lacking some messenger substance in his brain to be allo? Do all ace people? Is it an illness, after all?
Castiel knows that Dean is full of feelings. Many good, some bad. He knows that Dean hides many things under a facade of cockiness and nonchalance. But it's only that. A facade. Dean may be the most emotional human who has ever walked on earth. The most loving brother, son, and friend. He doesn't need to talk about how deeply he experiences love, hate, fear, joy. It's in every move he makes, in every word he says, in every decision he arrives at.
Probably nothing. Her look of disappointment would be enough. Hell, even the thought of that look makes Castiel sit up a little straighter against the tree trunk. He's 38 years old and his mother still has so much power over him, despite him not seeing her for more than two years now.
He never wants to hit anything, but she doesn't need to know that. He has to maintain a reputation after all,  and no one suspects his true persona under the easy flirting and his good kissing skills.
He looks up and through the wide windows that give the impression of the garden reaching into their living room. He watches Castiel for a long moment, the way his shoulders twitch as the angel seems to be in deep conversation with a hummingbird. Dean huffs a laugh. Castiel is a weird little bean, avenging angel and little puppy cramped into an unfitting trench coat. At least, his boyfriend owns more clothes now. He simply wears it out of nostalgia.
problem, not yours. You're not doing anything wrong."
Castiel swallows hard and straightens himself. "The Gas-N-Sip is an important retail point for locals and transients alike. We offer gas, but also groceries, information and entertainment material. It's the largest company of its kind in the whole United States, market-leading. I just got promoted to manager. I will have about a dozen employees under my leadership and will be solely responsible for centralised purchasing and such."
"That I told Sam."
"You're in withdrawal, but warm turkey, if you will. Your body goes through the symptoms, but softened by medication," Sam explains.
Castiel blesses him with a tender smile. "You deserve someone to feed you well, Dean."
They fixed this house for months, working with their bare hands, sweating ridiculously, stealing kisses in between. They have been the best months of Dean's life, and even though his joints creak just a little more now and his knee is acting up like a bitch, Dean wouldn't change it for the world.
Dean closes the door behind Castiel and leans his forehead against the cool wood. He has no idea what just happened. Why was it so hard to let him go? He's usually better with feelings like this. He should be after the fiasco with Lisa.
"Nearly there," Dean smirks and leads him to a footpath that Castiel has never walked before. "Close your eyes, or it's spoilt when you see the sign."
He'll miss seeing Castiel in his clothes, in his bed, in his fucking life.
"Hey, Cass," Charlie greets from behind, startling him. "Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you."
since I realised that something's wrong with me."
Dean furrows his brow. "How?"
Castiel smiles at him and pulls him on top of himself. "Agreed."
Sam rolls his eyes. "And soft drinks."
"I suppose with acquaintance you mean‚Ä¶"
"We're just happy that you're back on the horse," Sam shouts, and Dean tries to ignore the suggestive comments carrying loudly into the kitchen. It's moments like these‚Äîand when he deep-fries food‚Äîthat he really hates the open-plan space of the apartment. There is only so much time you can hide from your friends behind the fridge door.
"How have I never seen the signs? I mean, I was worried about his beer consumption but this?" She shakes her head, tears filling her eyes.
Castiel looks good in a suit, even though he managed to get his tie flipped around. Dean thinks it's adorable and doesn't correct it.
"There's this haunted house on Lake street. The police haven't bothered us much."
Adler purses his lips. "You'll hear from us."
"What is it?" she asks softly. Too softly.
a dealbreaker? I raised my brother in shitty motels and on the backseat of the Impala. I know how it is to go through diner trash to fill your stomach. I get it, man. I'm just happy it's behind you."
With tears pricking his eyes, he locks the bathroom door and sinks onto the closed toilet. He hits his thighs, hard. There'll probably be bruises blooming on them later, but Castiel doesn't care. He continues until the shame bled out of his body and his eyes stopped watering.
He saw how much food Dean threw away the three prior nights. But now that it's his turn, he sneaks it into his rucksack. He isn't sure if it is technically stealing, but having expired food that didn't lay in the sun for hours is way too appealing. And it's only for a week until he is paid and can actually use the communal kitchen and the food locker he calls his own.
Dean chuckles. "You're an angel. I always tell you that. So what's for dinner?"
After April, when Castiel realised that he was gay, he had renewed hope that his sexual disinterest would change, that
"You're used to other standards, aren't you?"
"So, let me get this straight," Rowena says, leaning back in her armchair and piercing Dean with her eyes. "You told your boyfriend what he should do, and simply expected him to follow?"
"If you say so," Dean grunts.
Castiel feels Dean's probing eyes on him when he undresses. But thankfully, he lets it slide.
And so, they cuddle up around each other. Dean hates how exhausting their relationship can be sometimes. But he wouldn't change it for the world.
"Hey. How you're doing, man?" Garth asks.
"Great. And you?"
"I haven't thrown it away!" Castiel says with utter conviction, his flickering eyes betraying the seriousness of his voice.
Castiel looks at Sam's hair in front of him. It's seldom enough that Dean lets his younger brother ride his car. But Dean is dead tired. So tired that he lets his guard down.
"Are you alright, babe?"
And Dean does. In the arms of a stranger under the Californian moon. He doesn't shake off the tender hand carding through his hair, or the strong arms holding him upwards. He lets out the sobs he's been holding and allows Castiel to brush away his tears before their lips meet in a gentle kiss. He smiles at Castiel bashfully afterwards.
Castiel could kiss Dean just for these words. Not that he wouldn't like to do it anyway. He imagined it vividly before he slid into sleep this morning, filters and self-control lowered by six days of working through the night. But he knows this is just a misguided fantasy. Even if he could make Dean want him, kissing would inevitably lead to other things, and he's not sure if he ever wants to do those again. He's heading towards the big four O. He should be able to live without cuddles and kisses.
He should be filled with butterflies, be giddy and a hopeless sap about the blue-eyed man next to him. But that's not in his cards. Not until he figures out how to handle this.
Is it normal to always have this fuzzy feeling in your stomach whenever your beloved smiles at you? Is it usual that the mere thought of your special someone dying rips you into a million pieces?
"Yeah. I just‚ÄîI can't get into my room."
Castiel nods, drifting off into his own head. He probably regrets telling Dean this, but his boyfriend has none of it.
"Dean, the bodily withdrawal is only the first step of the journey. You need to face your illness. Otherwise, you will relapse," Sam states, his voice bordering on a plea.
"So that they can judge your sexual prowess from two sides?" Castiel asks, amusement forged into his features and laced around every word.
"Or‚Äî'Dean, I've been through a rough stretch of my life. I ain't perfect. I survived by means I'm not entirely proud of. But I came out on the other side alive and stronger than ever before. I've a handle on my life now, and I wanna build a future with you.' How does that sound?"
Castiel's eyes flicker between the two exes. He sets his jaw and takes a breath. "We'll talk later then. Nice to see you again, Lisa." Castiel turns and walks inside the house. Dean's shoulders slump.
with him.
He takes the mini Yoda and throws it over to Castiel, who catches it and looks at the little thing so fondly that Dean is tempted to take his words back.
"Yes, you even sent one to me."
"Dean, are you not feeling well?"
"I didn't know you were gay," Castiel blurts out when understanding hits him like a baseball bat.
Castiel huffs. "What is a partner good for if not for meeting your needs?"
Castiel huffs a laugh. "Thanks for the confidence vote. If not even my boyfriend thinks I could succeed with anything in life, maybe I should fling myself off a bridge."
A quick trip to the DIY store later, Dean is not cursing about stupid plushies anymore, but stupid walls instead. Still, he manages to attach two shelves on Castiel's side of the room and put the plushies on them before his boyfriend returns. He needs another shower after that.
Dean shakes his head, but Castiel doesn't budge. "You‚Äôve given me so many things. So let me do this for you. It's not a big deal, Dean. I'm simply servicing my debt."
He tries to push the memory away, just like the fake cold creeping into his bones. He's warm, and safe, and sheltered now. He's even gained a pound or two, thanks to Dean's willingness to be cooked for, and his urge to show his boyfriend the world, even if the journey only happens on his plate.
"Dean, with my medical history, insurance is expensive. Did you receive post from yours?"
Castiel takes Dean's hand and presses a soft kiss on his lips. "I don't think I can sleep without you, Dean. But maybe we could use my bed today?"
Castiel blows over the hot liquid and takes a cautious sip. "I know. I was being dramatic. I'm not really used to someone caring. Not someone like you, at least."
"We all did such things, Dean. That's part of life. Unless it was illegal, it doesn't matter."
"It is Sunday, Dean. And Sam is right. I gotta go."
"So, what made you sink to the level of us mundanes?" Stevie asks after he shared that he was on the shortlist of becoming the manager of the last bank he worked at.
He shrugs. "Did my GED, but‚Ä¶"
Dean breathes out a ragged breath. "You're not mad?"
"I'm the supervisor and manager, yes."
Taking the bus so late makes him feel a bit unsafe. Ironic, if you think about him living on the street for nearly two years. But the booze helped to stifle his anxiety. He has medication for that now that just needs to kick in over the next few weeks, and the bus stop is right across the Gas-N-Sip. When he returns after the night shift, it will already be daytime again. He can do this.
"Me neither," Dean presses out. "I like getting to know my partner before‚Ä¶"
Castiel embraces Dean from behind and presses a kiss to his jaw. "They sure will with all the sweets you bought."
Dean smiles to himself. Castiel's head lolls against his shoulder with every pothole and every turning of the bus, and it's just perfect.
Castiel watches after Dean, who walks into their kitchen. He quickly checks his watch, then hastens after him.
Dean looks at Rowena and Sam, standing in a circle of flowers, binding their lives together. Who would have thought that these two boys from Kansas would both be happily partnered at some point in time? They didn't exactly have great role models with a dead mother, a straying father, and a widowed uncle that took them in as if they were his own sons.
Dean looks over to him when he gets out of the en-suite, towel wrapped around his waist, another rubbing over his wet hair. "The water pressure is marvellous, dude. You grew up in these walls?"
Castiel's breath catches as the fabric of Dean's jacket brushes against his neck. He wonders what it would feel like if Dean would wrap his arm around his shoulder. Dean smells lovely, clean and nice, and he emanates a warmth that goes beyond body temperature. Castiel allows himself to fantasise about it for a short moment.
He waves off the question. "Just wondering."
"You're a lucky dude."
But Castiel doesn't push him out of the way. Instead, gentle thumbs run over Dean's stubble, and tender lips brush over his own. Dean is frozen to the spot, his body trembles like an aspen leaf. He can barely breathe, still doesn't dare open his eyes.
Dean still hasn't figured out what 'normal' means regarding sex. Statistics will always only get you so far. So he decided to let his boyfriend of nine months take the lead, and at the moment, they have sex three to four times a week.
"I heard you met Missouri today."
"He's strong and in good hands," Sam adds, looking at his brother again.
Outside, Castiel shoots Dean a quick text. He doesn't want to talk about the interview now. Remembering his dishonourable descent is never easy, but that it forges his future is hard to swallow. Deep down, he knew that this might happen. Maybe he shouldn't have rocked the boat. But returning home on Thanksgiving with a fresh promotion in his suitcase‚Äîthat would be nice. Yes, it's nothing compared to
"Come on. Before the food gets cold."
Castiel isn't in the position to judge other people's behaviour anyway. More than once, he had heard that he is socially awkward, and often in not-so-kind words.
"I don't mind the plushies," he says out loud. "It's beautiful to be surrounded by something
Usually, Dean would find the air quotes adorable, but all he feels is anger rising in his chest. "Just because you're an ex-drunk doesn't mean you're the expert, buddy," he presses through gritted teeth.
Charlie throws her hands in the air. "Dean Winchester! Haven't I taught you anything?"
"Because she wants me to be happy," Dean says, and with horror, Castiel realises that he has spoken the question out loud. Dean huffs a laugh. "I'm sorry, man. I never planned to say a word. Our friendship is too important to me."
Castiel raises a challenging eyebrow. "And what is it then what we're doing all the time?"
"How're ya doin', buddy?"
"Not much of a loss with an ace like me." Dean chuckles heartfully, and the brothers hug goodbye.
His brain certainly neither.
Going slow, his ass. This is Castiel's equivalent of a one-night stand, and depending on how this day unfolds, it might as well be one.
Castiel nods. "Yes. My PB&J muffins and something new‚Äîlemon muffins with poppy seeds."
Castiel doesn't answer. The thought of telling Dean his story is frightening. But he knows Missouri is right. Still...
It's been rough since his last boyfriend sent him packing. What should have been a drink-until-I-forget binge turned into twenty-one lost months of his life, a lost job, a lost apartment, homelessness, and other things he'd rather forget. It's all in the past.
"Oh, hi! I'll buzz you in. 4th floor."
Hannah nods. "Good."
His mother had once called him a spoilt brat, and maybe she was right. One day with Dean and this, the room Castiel had fought so hard to be worthy of, one of his biggest achievements in the last two years, feels like a failure. Just like his whole life. He may be sober and on the payroll, but he has nothing to offer to a man, who has friends, and passions, and a heart too good and big for this world. Dean surely will grow tired of him.
Castiel bites his lip. "Too rich for their own good." He presses his burning face into Dean's shoulder. "It's another world. I'm not sure if I still fit in," he murmurs. "Too much has happened."
"Nah, I'm an agnostic. Not so sure if I believe in angels and god and stuff."
Dean gapes at him. "Cass, you could never‚Ä¶ Of course I love you. My sexuality has nothing to do with my feelings for you."
"Good morning, love," Castiel says and presses a kiss to his temple. "Drink up. Long day ahead."
Rowena smirks. "No one has ever said that relationships are easy, darling."
Absent-mindedly, Dean brushes over his chest where the shirt is still a little wrinkled. It felt so right, like two puzzle pieces slotting into place. But looking at Castiel, he's not so sure anymore. His stomach ties into knots at the thought that he might have destroyed everything.
"No! You could hurt yourself." Castiel jumps off the bed. "I'll leave you alone if it's uncomfortable with me around."
She scans him again, and Castiel can't help but squirm under her intense gaze. She sits down on what used to be Cain's bed, and Castiel sinks on his own. He fidgets with the bedframe, unsure what this unannounced visit might mean for him.
He drags himself under a tree to get out of the sun and slumps down. He feels like shit, but at the same time so much better now. All this built-up tension is gone, leaving a nearly soothing emptiness behind.
Dean makes a face but lets it drop.
"Leave it be, Stevie. You're off duty. Don't interrogate our guest."
"Let me explain."
He runs his hand over the stacks, memory after memory popping up in his mind. They paint a soft glow on his features. His eyebrows scrunch in confusion when his eyes fall on an album that he knows has never been his.
"No, you're right. I‚Äî What did you enjoy doing before the shit hit the fan? I know you love cooking."
Castiel takes it with an eye-roll and starts drying it. "Yes, it is. It's your first day at your new job and I'll make you breakfast. Jody agreed to come in early. Donna is visiting and is taking care of the girls."
This wasn't what he had planned. Before he had the ace talk with Charlie, he wanted to let Castiel fuck him. It's always easier to fake an orgasm that way, at least doggy style. But now it's too late for that.
Castiel huffs a mirthless laugh. "Sure. 'Hey, Dean. I used to be someone, but then I became an alcoholic, lost everything, became homeless, and yes, now and then, I had sex with guys to not starve. Want to start a family?' I imagine that would go down well."
"Or grey. Sorry, I should've asked you for your label."
"Never, Cass."
Castiel frowns at him. "Do you want me to take care of it?"
Dean pulls away from her. "What?"
Dean gives her an affronted side look. "What is that supposed to mean?"
Dean works his jaw. "And if you don't get it?"
"Um, sure. He's handsome."
Castiel spreads the food on Dean's dinner table, taking in the missing photographs on the wall and the half-empty DVD and CD shelves. His heart aches. Dean must feel empty, too. He loved Lisa, Castiel knows that. And Ben, her son.
Dean blushes and looks at the path. "He takes good care of himself. A bit too well if you ask me."
Dean stares at him for a long moment before he walks to the exit. The bang of the closing door gives Castiel another jerk. He slumps against the wall and slides down. He can't hold in the tears any longer. What did he do wrong? He only told a few white lies to avoid conflict. He did nothing wrong with giving his lunch to Kevin. The boy needed food, and Castiel didn't. But now, Dean is furious.
Castiel contemplates throwing the sandwiches away. He hates the thought. He used to starve. Thrashing food doesn't feel right. Then, he remembers a discussion he had with Garth about the superiority of PB&Js over grilled cheese sandwiches. So, he slips into the staff room and puts his lunch on a plate. The sandwiches are still good. Dean always gets the ratio of peanut butter and jelly just right to keep them moist without turning soggy over time.
Castiel wraps perfectly around him, fits in every empty space inside and outside of him, and layers himself like a physical presence around Dean's heart that slowly calms down.
Dean worries the inside of his cheek between his teeth.
A flare of anger rises in Dean's chest. The man doesn't know him. What gives him the right to state something like this?
Dean shakes his grip off.  "Look me in the eye and tell me that you've eaten the sandwiches." Castiel shrinks into himself, the regret in his eyes saying it all. "Sonovabitch," Dean presses out.
Platonic love. That's what Dean was clearly talking about. Maybe Lisa was fed up with their closeness, with the single friend joining their family dinners too often, the way Castiel stared at her husband a bit too long and always way too intense.
There is a pause, and Dean realises that Castiel must have smiled quietly when he softly says, "You're always handsome, Dean."
After a long moment of staring, he sets the tray on his desk and sits down at the edge of the bed. He brushes the hair out of Castiel's face. His boyfriend's eyes shoot open at the touch, a hint of panic dulling their blue. It takes the sleep-muddled man a moment to morph his face into a smile.
He's kissing Castiel, his colleague, a shy soul, probably straight.
But then there are fingers on his fly, and his brain shorts out with Castiel on his knees and his boyfriend's lips around him.
That might be because he doesn't know the whole story, of course, just snippets and outcomes, but not the reasons behind them, or the missing pieces that would give him a full picture. And frankly, Castiel is way too afraid to let Dean see those. So he pushes them down and covers them with work, secretly shed tears, and lots of food, until all he can feel is nausea. It's a physical sensation that could pass as an emotion in Castiel's book, and it is glorious and terrible at the same time.
Castiel shakes his head. "Or I blew it, once and for all."
"Samandriel will bring his beautiful bride," Mrs Novak coos. It sounds strange from her lips. Too sweet.
Castiel's stomach ties into knots instantly. He knows that he needs to move out soon. Is she here to demand action?
Dean chuckles. "We only try to give back, now that we made it to the other side."
She smiles at him. Dean's hand twitches with the urge to brush a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Muscle memory is a strange thing. "Yeah. I'm doing alright. It's enough to get by."
Awake, Dean would never let himself go like this. Castiel knows. But that his subconsciousness lets Dean do that in his vulnerable state, it makes Castiel incredibly happy. Dean trusts him. Despite his shortcomings, despite the mistakes he made, for all his faults.
"You neglected your work until you didn't come anymore," Adler states, piercing him with his gaze over the wooden desk.
He looks down at the collar of Castiel's shirt.
Castiel doesn't know what to say. His heart doesn't know if it is supposed to grow because the man who holds it returns his feelings, or if it is supposed to break into little pieces because Dean is so clearly sad that he failed at being a husband and father, living the apple pie life. But maybe Dean is just out of it in grief and the booze mixes up the different feelings that Dean holds for him and Lisa. Yes. It's probably just that. No reason to raise his hopes over the ruins of his friend's marriage.
Sam wets his lips and nods. "Good. Be honest if it gets too much. I know my brother can be a handful when he's sick."
Castiel blinks his eyes open. The first thing he sees is his gorgeous boyfriend. Dean's eyes look a little tired, but apart from that, he looks just as good as he did this morning, when they started their journey.
"Naw! That title is already taken."
Castiel snaps his head to Rowena, who leant in conspiratorially.
Dean nods. "Yeah."
Dean takes a sip of his draft beer, regretting not having gone for a bottled ale. What he would give to play with a dampened label right now. He runs his fingers over the condensation on the glass instead, making a squeaking noise that sounds terribly loud in the eerie silence between them.
Lisa furrows her brow. "You did nothing wrong, Dean."
"Yeah. You said you liked it. I thought it was romantic."
"Yeah. But we wouldn't move in together. He'd just be a roommate, not my live-in boyfriend. Charlie, he has no privacy. This new guy hangs out in their room all the time. Cass is mostly here anyway. He slept here‚Äîwhat?‚Äînine days?"
Dean feels a little underdressed until he spots a man in an ill-fitting suit, draped into a trenchcoat. He is standing next to a redheaded, slim woman, who Dean would probably try to get on the backseat of his Impala if he wasn't set on finding that Castiel guy, sweet talk him today and wreck him tomorrow. Unless Sam does the wise thing and cancels the wedding, which seems less and less likely by the minute. Rowena's spell seems to become stronger day by day. Dean hardly recognises his ever-worrying, self-loathing brother anymore, with all the grinning that goes on on his face.
"I missed you, too. Can I hold you until dinner? Need to consecrate the bedding." Dean grins from ear to ear.
"Of course you had," Dean chuckles. "We should hit the road though. I'll have to get up at 6 tomorrow."
"Hello, Dean."
Castiel swallows the bite. "Yes, it's very good." He isn't lying. These are the best hot dogs since he ate perro caliente in Colombia. Not that he would say that out loud. Not after making Dean feel bad about never being abroad. "I love them."
Dean chuckles. "Is it? Crying like a baby in a stranger's arms?"
Dean sets the moving box on their new dining table.
He smiles at her. It comes easily despite the contradicting emotions battling in his stomach. "Hey, Liz. Hungry?"
Castiel nods and waves shyly at the others. Charlie tilts her head to the side. "I thought you'd be shorter."
"Yeah. You never do." He unties his apron and throws it on the table next to the grill. "Benny, will ya take over the barbecue?"
"I thought you weren't a churchgoer."
How is this his life? Just three months ago, he had been happy-ish‚Äîthe stepfather of an awesome boy, the partner of a lovely woman, a house with a garden, the apple pie life he had always longed for as a kid. It wasn't all roses and sunshine, but what relationship is?
Dean nods and takes the lunchbox off his boyfriend's hands. "Did you enjoy the sandwiches?" he asks innocently.
He runs a hand over his face. "I love him, Charles. I can't fuck this up."
"The -el. My mother used to speak a blessing over my brother and me. It was about Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael."
Dean huffs a laugh. "I thought we established that we both aren't top-shelf when it comes to relationship material. You think
"Just past six," Dean whispers and presses a soft kiss on Castiel's lips. Somehow, seeing him like this makes Dean worried to break the spell lying over this day.
"You're an asshole!" Dean grumbles.
"I never thought that he might be addicted," Sam says when the silence between them grows too dense.
He finds himself in front of the pay-what-you-can caf√©. They have risotto again. This time with butternut squash. It tastes delicious, and after a mousse au chocolat as dessert‚Äîa luxury he had never allowed himself before‚Äîhe smiles proudly at the waitress when he lays down the bank notes and gives her a tip.
Dean laughs in relief and pulls him into his arms. "I'm sure it is just as thoughtful. And if not‚Äîthis garden has an apple tree. You know what to do."
Dean swallows hard as Castiel lets go of his shirt and brushes the wrinkles out of it, touches that spread like sparkles through his chest. No one is saying a word, and Dean's heart runs an extra mile, anxiety forming like a ball of lead in the pit of his stomach.
"We could add your funko pops, Dean."
Castiel needs a moment to overcome the thought that Dean could have picked up on his abstinence to process what his boyfriend just revealed. "He did what?"
Castiel squints at him for a long moment. "I won't have sex with you," he says matter-of-factly, and Dean finds it extremely refreshing, his tense shoulders relaxing instantly. Still, the hint that he might have had funny business in mind makes him redden even further. When did he become a blushing virgin?
Dean rolls his eyes. "Yeah, whatever." Castiel doesn't miss the soft expression on his face, though.
Castiel rolls his eyes. "I've touched you before."
Dean lies sprawled out over the picnic blanket, his head pillowed on Castiel's stomach. He hums, enjoying the evening sun on his skin and his boyfriend's hand in his hair. Castiel's fingers are so gentle despite the strength they hold.
"It's okay," Castiel repeats.
"Oh, darling, you coudna," Rowena objects. "I've gone with the boys ever since Sam and I got together. Now you're part of the family tradition, too."
Castiel maybe shouldn't have piled them on top of each other when he confessed his love to Dean. The man wasn't used to praise, not used to be seen as worthy of unconditional love, of being loved by anyone really. Dean's probably still processing half of what Castiel said and that's why he lets it slide when Dean tries to play tough.
She rolls her eyes. "What do you think the A stands for in LGBTQIA+?"
"Are you okay, love?"
Charlie nods and presses her lips together. "Sorry. I'm sure you know what you do." Castiel hopes she's right.
Yes, starting a relationship is stupid. It blew off in his face twice already. But his exes are both women. Men are different with sex. At least, that's Dean's experience. He might fake it way longer with Castiel.
Sam looks incredibly small for a man of his size as his eyes flicker from Dean to Castiel and back. He knits his brow together.
"Nothing, babe."
Dean chuckles. "You're right. I was just shocked last night. I'd never thought you'd be so reckless."
Dean pulls him into his arms. "I love you," he murmurs into his boyfriend's hair.
It was all he thought he deserved. Everyone who stayed with a Winchester was destined to die for them. He can count the women in his life that didn't die through Chuck's stupid games on one hand.
"Could ask you the same, Winchester. Mum told me you finally remembered how to get here."
"I thought you'd like to make your own with the honey I brought you."
"What? 'Buddy'?"
"Hey, Jo. How're you doin'?" Dean asks and the blonde smirks at him.
Dean wishes he wouldn't have to lie if he said he wasn't either. Is there an expiration date for that stamp if you haven't got laid for more than a year? Probably not.
"Jesus, who pissed in your coffee?" she murmurs.
"He's going to be fine," Sam states as if he could read his mind. "He's survived worse."
"I know how family get-togethers can go sideways quickly. I won't let them tear you down."
"This is Charlie and Benny. Both are my roommates. Andrea is Benny's girlfriend and Stevie Charlie's. Sammy and Rowena should be here any minute."
"How was your day, honey?" he asks on day five.
She presses her lips together and nods. They stay silent for an awkwardly long moment. Everyone seems to keep their distance for their reunion. Even Castiel talks with Charlie on the other side of the lawn. Eileen looks ostentatiously in the other direction. Dean knows she would never read their lips, but he appreciates the gesture.
"I'll take the same. But a coke zero, if you have one."
Dean pulls back and brings some distance between them. "Cass, that's‚Ä¶ You can't allow me to do that, sleep or not. Kick me when I do shit like that."
"Oh, don't you dare, Jody," he says, chuckling, and walks to his office.
The next bus leaves without them. They have more important things to do.
"Yes," Dean chuckles. "Yes."
Castiel swallows hard. He didn't think so far. "I‚ÄîI'm not sure if I can eat right after work," he presses out.
"Depending on the amount, you at least get your 5 a day," he says evenly, and Dean actually laughs. It's the most beautiful sound Castiel has ever heard. It's full-belly, and the lines around Dean's eyes crinkle prettily. Castiel has never understood why people hate their wrinkles. He loves faces that show that a person has lived.
Castiel gives him a crooked smile. They all seem nice enough, but he's not really a people person. What was he thinking when he agreed to come here?
"Because I mean it." The tone of Dean's voice is so confident that Castiel wants to believe him. It's hard, though, knowing the darkness that lives inside his soul, bound to spill at any time. Castiel didn't lie back when they talked after their first kiss. Bad luck follows him everywhere he goes. Why should it be any different now? He'll manage to mess this up somehow.
Dean rolls his eyes at him. "Yes. Because you are 99 per cent made of downy feathers," he grunts. He doesn't know why he's defending this stupid construct, but the thought of Sam seeing the little stuffed thing in his living room makes his stomach clench. His brother is teasing him often enough for how gooey-eyed he is for his lover. He doesn't need Eileen to chime in at their next weekly movie night.
Castiel knows that the two were generous, letting the man stay for so long without buying anything. He recognises him as soon as he turns the corner. "Kevin."
"Most people do, angel. It's called 'dinner'," Dean quips, but Castiel can hear in his tone that he's worried again.
"Fuck! That's why you couldn't go home yesterday. Oh, babe. You should've said something."
"Jerk." Sam laughs in relief.
Michael purses his lips. "He‚Ä¶ They are doing fine. A bit of a dreamer, but does as told."
Nora smirks and hits playfully against his chest. "Oh, I know that look."
Another, probably smile-filled moment of silence follows. "Love is beautiful, isn't it?"
Okay, it was a petty move on Dean's part. He should have just talked with his boyfriend, but instead, he kept on playing his game. He still put notes in the lunchbox, cleaned it at night, just to fill it with new sandwiches in the morning. Oh, yeah. And he bought a jar of jam, just to check his manifesting theory.
Castiel frowns. "Wouldn't it be quicker if each of us showered on their own?"
Castiel doesn't remember when exactly he fell in love with Dean. It feels like it's been always there since he pulled him out of hell. But he also knows that this isn't quite true. He couldn't feel back then. Not really. That's something Dean taught him, and somewhere on the way it happened.
Not all of him, of course. There are still secrets, shameful spots in his past that Castiel hopes will never come up between them. But the big topics are out in the open, and Dean had reacted so kindly. No judgement. No probing. Simple acceptance. And Castiel has enough of racking his brain, of picking holes into an offer that sounds too good to be true‚Äîa relationship where his lack of interest in sex isn't a dealbreaker. Quite the opposite, actually.
Tears prick his eyes when Castiel amplifies his ministrations to finally get him off. It's already a bit painful but that's not why the sting behind his eyelids grows.
Dean scratches the back of his neck. "I‚ÄîI get if you want to enjoy your new freedom. I bet Benny's bed is very comfortable. Not as good as my memory foam but‚Ä¶"
Castiel thinks of the always broken boiler and the hole that Luke punched right next to his head. He shakes the memories away.
"Oh, they did." Castiel chuckles self-deprecatingly. "It was just always me who paid. Probably the only reason why they stuck around."
The bed is empty next to him. How one can be an early bird, Dean will never understand. But he sure as hell won't complain if it means that the man of his deams brings him fresh coffee to bed.
He tilts his head to look at the Scot and finds Dean's gaze on him, his head reclined on top of the backrest. When their eyes meet, Dean blushes crimson and sits up, hiding behind his future sister-in-law.
Castiel nods. "I'll have to find a room somewhere soon."
"You seem to have cooled down a little," Castiel states matter-of-factly.
Castiel puts his mug on the nightstand, rises from the bed, and embraces his boyfriend from behind. "I'm so sorry." He presses a soft kiss on the nape of his neck.
Dean has to agree, but still, he wonders in what state she has seen her brother last. Castiel is strangely cryptic when it comes to certain parts of his story. Dean doesn't push. His boyfriend will share them with him in his own time.
He knows it's stupid and futile. But for the first time since he left Lisa, his get-off-to-sleep ritual of stroking himself until he is relaxed enough to slide into dreamland actually ends in getting off to the imagined visuals of blue eyes, the most beautiful smile on chapped lips, and the sound of a softly moaned 'Dean'. The next morning, he won't be able to feel bad about it. He had all but forgotten how fucking great an orgasm could be. If he were able to get one with a partner, how awesome would
"I'm coming." He waves over to Jenny and welcomes Dean's lips finally meeting his own. Yeah. The first day as a supervisor could have been worse.
His silence probably isn't his best selling point when it comes to deflecting from the question, but he doesn't know what to say. He's not a natural buffoon like Dean. If he's funny, then it's by mistake.
Castiel's features grow softer. "I will. Can I have your Bluetooth headphones?"
"Are you ready, Cass?" Dean calls over.
Dean has slept with many, girls, guys, and non-binary people. It didn't matter. There only had to be the sparkle, the special tension that pulls two bodies together until they collide in an explosion of passion, fast-burning, the flame already extinct come morning.
Castiel raises his head and looks at him with puppy eyes. "I'm sorry."
"Are you okay, Dean?" he asks and sounds concerned.
"It's Fluttershy, Dean," Castiel corrects gently.
"He's a bonny lad, isn't he?"
Dean groans. "I said that I'll bring it. And it's Lisa's recipe, so she'll probably bring the same."
He wets his lips and swallows hard, trying his best to calm his racing heart, but to no avail.
Charlie squeezes his shoulder. "You won't break up. You'll talk the shit out and reconcile. You love each other way too much to let a few bumps throw you off course."
He sits up next to Dean and hooks his fingers under the waistband. He looks up at Dean with a questioning gaze. Green eyes stare at him for a long moment before Dean nods his consent and lifts his hips. His cock springs free, slightly erect. Castiel smiles shyly up at Dean.
"Did you check on the warm food?" he asks.
As it turns out, the ticking time bomb doesn't come down during the night. Dean finds them spread on the floor after getting out of the shower. He curses as he trips over one lying in the way. It's one that doesn't deserve the name plushie. It's hard! Those stupid things! He should stuff them into a rubbish bag and throw them out. But he doesn't have the heart to do it. Dean may be hung up on old gender roles now and then, but he isn't a complete asshole.
"So, I guess you didn't tell him that you're ace?"
Castiel chuckles. People who've never been there would never understand. "I'll bring him to Missouri on his birthday, if he lets me. I can hardly force him to do something against his will. I pray that he'll come tomorrow, that he trusts me enough."
"Sure you did. Didn't find my notes, did ya?" Castiel's eyes grow wide. "Or realise that today's sandwiches were made with jam?"
His body is a traitor. It will chase away this beautiful man between his legs, who so patiently uses all his tricks on him to no avail. Because Dean is fucking ace or grey or whatever, and he just. can't. come.
"Well done, man."
"Always so mature," Dean mutters. "I'm pouring my heart out. But I know. You could never love me back. I'm a mess."
"They were delicious as always, love."
love."
Castiel finds him dozed off sitting on the bathroom floor, embracing the toilet pan. Concern creases his forehead as he tries to wake his slightly shaking, sweating boyfriend.
Dean groans. No, he won't think of these sinful lips wrapped around his cock. No way, Jos√©.
"Something bothering you?" he asks, finding his boyfriend how he left him.
Dean flips another burger and tries hard not to look at Lisa, who just arrived with a big hello welcoming her. He never bad-mouthed her so nobody harbours a grudge. They all know he's happy with Castiel anyway.
He pulls his hand from the right side, where the beer is, to the left with the sodas. He's sweating because it's hot outside, and his hands are trembling because he's dead tired after six night shifts. He just needs a cool shower and probably ten hours of sleep, and he'll be fine.
Dean knits his brow together. "Like with plants?"
They both depended on their jobs and, as a mother, Lisa had to work the day shift. So, Dean, naturally, had switched to the night. He didn't expect what a toll it would take on him, though.
Castiel can't relate. As much as he loves Hannah, they've never been
"When I mess up, you mean." Dean grins but Charlie looks right through him.
Dean shakes his head, his lips curling into a lopsided smile. "I thought I could soap you up, and give you a little massage. I lay around most of the time last week, and you‚Ä¶"
"I never thought that a woman her age would live in a shared apartment. Made me feel better about myself."
Dean chuckles mirthlessly. "Yeah. Why would it ever be?"
Dean takes a deep breath, pours the soup back into the pot and puts it into the fridge. Then he walks to Castiel's door and knocks.
Castiel switches off the bedside lamp and smiles into the darkness. "Me, too, Dean. Me, too."
Dean stalls, standing there with his belt in hand. After a long moment, he shrugs. "It just is."
Castiel smiles. "Yes. And I used to collect postcards."
And now, he can't even say 'no' to another helping of food?
Castiel gives Dean a questioning look, but the man is very busy gazing anywhere but him. Castiel frowns, unsure what to make of the situation. Charlie is still smiling at him, looking so open and weirdly hopeful, that he returns it with a tiny shrug.
"Deal, handmaiden."
Dean takes the tub and ushers him in. "Cass brought popcorn!" he yells through the hallway. Several whoops return from the open plan living space.
What the hell happened!? Why can't he remember a single thing? Before he can think better of it, he dials Sam's number. His brother picks up after a second.
"People who can relate to some aspects of being asexual, but not to others. Some only experience sexual attraction very infrequently. Some people are demi and can only develop sexual attraction if they have a bond with someone. Being ace is very individual. The grey spectrum is wide. And all of it is perfectly normal."
Sam breathes a sigh. "Did the garage call?"
Dean thinks of the box under his bed, the one that he has hidden from his boyfriend so far, too ashamed that he isn't the gold star ace that his partner thinks he is. It's not that he's horny all the time, but most definitely more often than in the past. His therapist said it might be from being sober. Dean really wants an ice-cold beer now. He could shock his dick into submission and then down it for good measure.
She rolls her eyes. "I don't
"There's a difference between teasing and insulting. You don't have to put up with their shit."
"Do you know the homeless shelter, corner 8th and Oak street? Pest control was finally done, and the church offered to give it a lick of paint and some repairs."
Dean glances at Castiel, who is stoically looking ahead, his mimic unreadable.
need more than he admits. Maybe he's worried that Castiel would leave him if he confessed his true desires.
"No such thing. I want this to be the Christmas of Christmasses."
Sam smiles over to his future bride. "I just need a minute, mo ghr√†dh."
"You son of a bitch, why do you have to be so fucking beautiful? With those eyes and those hands and those lips? You don't even get half of my jokes. Why do I have to be in love with you? Fuck!"
Dean chuckles nervously. "Don't get me wrong. I have it. Plenty. With everyone who'll have me. I know that I'm a freak. I'll sleep with Cass. But there'll come a time when I can't get it up for him or can't make myself do it as often as he likes, and then he'll leave, just like Cassie and Lisa did."
"Our parents have already turned in. Are you hungry? I asked the cook to prepare cold cuts for you."
And Castiel did. He had been disciplined all his life. That's how he carved out a career, soldiered through relationship after relationship, said 'no' to his own needs no matter if it was at work or in the bedroom. Yes, there was indulgence from time to time, but nothing that would have passed the Novak lines of decadence. And even when he was homeless, he had given himself rules, like the one about not exploiting pay-as-you-can offers, or the rate at which he allowed himself to swap sex for food. It may sound messed up, and it probably was. But these rules made him survive with his dignity somewhat intact when he had no control of how much liquor he put into his system, or where he would sleep the next night.
A hand on his cheek startles Castiel out of his thoughts. "I've let myself be used in the past, too. For money and for closeness. But we won't do that to each other. What we have is great. You're the best thing that ever happened to me, too, angel." He presses a kiss to Castiel's lips, and his boyfriend lets out a quiet whimper. "Neither of us will ever sell their body ever again," Dean promises against his lips.
Castiel cups his cheek tenderly. "All you have to do is to recover, love."
Dean feels underdressed the second he enters the room. Castiel clutches his hand so tightly that Dean is convinced that there will be lasting crescents pressed into the flesh. He puts on his most winsome smile anyway. There's never a second chance for a first impression.
"Dean," Castiel says sternly, "your body went through withdrawal. You didn't just 'lay around'."
"As I said. I'll get insurance as soon as I get the job. Are you satisfied now?"
"Yeah. I'm so sorry, Cass. I wish I weren't," he croaks and shrugs in a helpless gesture. What does a label help if it makes you lose everything your heart wants?
"Oh, I can attest that his
"He's nice," Andrea supplies, and Dean sends a thankful smile her way.
Dean huffs a laugh. "It survived my old man. Yours can't be so much worse."
Dean sits up and knits his brow together, staring into space for a long moment. "Okay," he repeats.
She nods in understanding. Dean gets the impression that she knows to read her brother rather well. "He was always very disciplined. I guess it's how we were raised. And his otherness only pushed him to try harder. But I'm happy to see glimpses of who he used to be." She studies Dean's face for a long moment. "I won't give you the shovel talk. Just promise me to treat him well. He deserves a good man at his side."
"Um, hello. This is Castiel. I'm‚ÄîI'm Dean's colleague from the Gas-N-Sip."
It sounds lame and egoistic, but it's the truth. Castiel seems to see that. "But you had sex with me, all this time. I feel like I violated you without even knowing."
"Castiel."
Of course, Dean thinks so. Because Dean is modest, was never spoilt like Castiel was growing up. He doesn't know what he's missing out on. He doesn't know the dread Castiel feels, every time Charlie talks about her and Stevie's holiday plans. Or how expensive plane tickets are in case he gets Dean to come with him to the Novak family Thanksgiving dinner. Which he hasn't even told him about yet. Because he's too chickenshit, both towards his boyfriend
Castiel's eyes grow impossibly wide. It would be hilarious if Dean wasn't drowning in self-loathing right now.
Dean fishes for Castiel's hand and laces their fingers together. "I'll try."
Lisa pushes her hands into the pockets of her jeans and worries her lip. "I thought a lot about you over the last few months. About
Castiel cups the back of Dean's neck. "You've been a child. I swear to God, John Winchester can be happy that he's already dead. May he rot in hell!"
"I wouldn't have thought that you may strike a beauty just as this," he coos, stretching his hand out to Dean. "I must have underestimated your prowess." Castiel's cheeks turn crimson at the implication.
"Dean, where are we going?" he asks the further they walk. It's been only a few minutes, but Hannah and her family are two more hours drive away tops.
It's a strange thing to close a door behind himself. Granted, this is more of a supply closet than a real office. But it has a desk, and with that, something Castiel had secretly dreamt of for years‚Äîa place to put up a photograph of his boyfriend.
"Yes. A very talkative one, though." Castiel throws a tea bag into his mug. Castiel never drinks that stuff. He's the connoisseur of loose teas.
Castiel's eyes widen. The first night, Dean had said that this job wasn't for beginners because food safety was too important. They couldn't risk being closed just because a trucker caught salmonellae.
"And fights," Dean mumbles.
The hand on his shoulder tightens in a squeeze, and Dean pulls back, hovering over the threshold in a way that makes Castiel tense in unease. Is he already regretting letting his new boyfriend move in?
"Cass, I can explain."
"Hide what?" Castiel asks. None of them saw him coming.
If you were here for ace representation, maybe you want to bookmark/subscribe to my
"Hey, Dean."
He pulls a flabbergasted Castiel into his arms and presses a kiss on the crown of his head. "Where're you livin' now?"
A smile tugs on the corner of Dean's lips, and he looks up from the magnet to the garden again. Castiel is standing on their porch, watching him with a soft, close-lipped smile.
Charlie sighs. "When Cass told me that he's a reformed alcoholic, I read up a little. Just to see warning signs or help him, you know?" Dean nods and takes a slug from his beer bottle. Charlie watches him, worrying her lip. "Most people think alcoholism is about shooting oneself off all the time. But you can be an alcoholic even if you don't go overboard. The question is always if one can stop the consumption without withdrawal symptoms."
"I called your former boss, though, and her feedback was split."
So, there might come a moment when Dean will leave the Gas-N-Sip behind. Will Castiel be enough for him if Dean makes more money bartending or fixing cars? Not to mention their diametrically opposed work schedules if Dean gets the job at the garage he interviewed for last week.
Dean raises an amused eyebrow. "Since when are you a gardener?"
Dean nods. "Fair enough."
"Dean Winchester, you'll be the death of me."
Castiel's smug grin on the back of his head when he leaves the room.
She displays a fake pout, and Castiel slowly starts to understand their dynamics. Something tight in his chest uncurls itself. Had he been worried that Jo is an old flame? Probably. Oh, boy. Jealousy. He hates that feeling nearly more than shame.
She blows a breath through her teeth, a quiet whistle filling the silence. "So, you had rules and he broke them?" Dean shakes his head. "He's an adult man. Shouldn't he be free to decide when and what to eat?"
His boyfriend chuckles and pulls back. "You're the best thing that ever happened to me, Dean. No money could balance out the joy you brought into my life."
"Yes, your Highness?"
Castiel could count his eyelashes or the freckles adorning his bbeautiful face, and sink into these hazel-green eyes. Of course, he doesn't. He may be socially awkward, but he's not stupid. He may dream about it when he falls into bed after his fourth night shift, though.
He puts on his second pair of jeans, throws a somewhat clean hoodie over his threadbare shirt and strikes off to a caf√© on the other side of town that has a pay-what-you-can policy. He has a strict rule to go there twice a month at the utmost. But today, he wants to sit alone at a table and eat, just like normal people do, celebrating his first day back on a payroll.
He watches a fat bumblebee sitting down on a flower in front of the house. Castiel loves them. Dean thinks back to their very first date with pizza in the park. Castiel seemed so calm and relaxed there. Maybe‚Ä¶
"Oh, god, yes! Ellen's pancakes are to die for." Dean scrapes the scrambled eggs on their plates and presses a peck on Castiel's lips. "Thank you," he whispers.
"You really wanna know?" Dean sounds equally parts thrilled and daunted. Castiel turns to face him. His boyfriend shuffles his feet, and a faint pink dusts his cheeks. "It's about your Christmas gift."
Dean blinks at him. "Okay."
"I think I proved that to them sufficiently," Dean chuckles and throws an Eeyore his way.
"Samuel?" Rowena calls from the entrance. "Dinner starts in five."
"What for?" Castiel asks.
"You came to warm yourself up?" Kevin nods. "Why don't you come into my office? I have a radiant heater there. And sandwiches." Kevin smiles shyly, suddenly looking like the teenager he met more than a year ago.
"You look tired, love." The endearment slips out of his mouth of its own accord and Castiel's eyes grow wide, searching for Dean's reaction. But there is none. Just a subtle twitch of his lips, and Dean leaning forward to bring their foreheads together.
Dean's eyes fix on Castiel's for a long moment and then jump to his duffle bag. "It's surely not that bad. Cass is too cautious."
Castiel swallows hard. "I'm not good with nicknames. It might take a while until I find one for you."
A giggle works its way up Dean's throat. Isn't that hilarious? Castiel just made him orgasm, kind of, and is concerned. Yeah, Dean is so messed up. At least Lisa and Cassie could enjoy these moments of passion to the fullest, their boyfriend for once in for the ride.
Dean breathes a sigh. "I'm fine. Let me do something nice for you."
"Castiel, I'm sorry that I had to rouse you, but my quitting time is nearing, and I think we need to talk."
"I mean, you don't have to, of course." Dean's voice is so small, the sound a cold hand clenching around Castiel's heart.
"You didn't. Listen‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have a problem with having sex. Never had. That's why it took me nearly 40 years to come out to myself. And the first one I told was Lisa, and you know how that ended."
"You're not a whore, Cass." Dean wants to go on, but he doesn't miss the shift in Castiel's eyes, the subtle tension in his shoulders. He doesn't know what brought it on, but he knows that he messed up big time.
He chuckles to cover up how much he wants to ask it in earnest. But that wouldn't be wise. The longer they keep it casual, the longer Dean can draw out the inevitable.
What Dean meant was that most people would think of other things. But he wouldn't touch this topic with a three-metre pole right now. He's way too happy that Castiel is here, with him, snuggling himself into his arms.
"Awesome." Dean grins from ear to ear. If Castiel keeps his work ethics and loosens up a little, working the night shift will probably be as much fun as it used to be with Donna.
a whore. I sold my body for a shower, a decent meal, and a night in a comfy bed. I'm a whore, Dean, and I can suck your dick anytime you want. I'm good at it. I was made to be on my knees, I was told." He spits the words, and they sink like venom into Dean's skin.
Castiel nods once more and tries to take a deep breath. What if he loses his current job because he tried to pursue higher things?
"I was sick at the time. As you might see in my personnel file, I haven't missed a single day of work since I started at the Gas-N-Sip." Castiel sounds way calmer than he feels, but a good facade is half the battle. "I am fully recovered now, have a secure housing situation and relationship. I am a very different person compared to that time in my life."
Lisa returns his smile. "Good morning, Castiel. Congratulations on your promotion."
Castiel turns and leaves the flat, the front door slamming closed behind him. Dean stares at the empty hallway for a long moment, then curses like a sailor. Who does Castiel think he is? Didn't he tell him he wouldn't want to change a thing about him? That he loved his soft belly, and the way Dean enjoys the food he cooks for him?
"So, what letter of the alphabet are you?" a gum bubble making twink had asked him, scanning him from head to toe, sending a rush of endorphins through Dean, better than the one after killing the rogue wolf half an hour earlier.
"About what?"
Lisa makes her rounds, and Dean is still busy grilling burgers when she finally approaches him.
"I don't care what others think. That's none of their goddamn business." Dean winces. Castiel barely curses. "Didn't you know that I would love this part of you just like I love every other? All the wonderful and infuriating parts that make one beautiful Dean Winchester?"
His finger slips in easily, and he moves it carefully inside his boyfriend. Castiel for sure is a goner today, his legs already twitching. Dean loves it. Loves to make Castiel feel good.
"Sure. I'm waiting in the front." He smirks at him and disappears behind the closing door.
He knows why. Even a pie lover like Dean has to admit that
The joke falls on deaf ears as Castiel simply nods along. Dean raises his eyebrows momentarily, then moves on. "If you're good at working in this department, I'll show you how to take inventory. That's our job as it's less traffic in the early hours. Any questions so far?"
Dean swallows hard. What he would give for a beer right now, but he had way too much of that red wine already. Maybe that's why he answers, "You." There is a long moment of surprise that Castiel doesn't seem inclined to break, so Dean adds, "I built up this story in my head that Rowena bewitched Sam and you were at fault because you brought them together."
he scolds himself. But the rejection stings.
"Cuddling?" Dean chuckles.
But Castiel just gives him that flat expression that is enough to put Dean on edge. Is it displeasure? Annoyance? Or simply his version of an eye-roll?
That was obviously the wrong thing to say as Castiel storms off to his room and shuts it with a loud
"Sure, chief."
Castiel has a plan. A good plan. They've been together for three weeks now and he knows it's time. Dean has been antsy the whole past week, and Castiel is smart enough to connect the dots. Dean needs sex but he doesn't want to put pressure on him. Dean's perfect, but he's also just a man with urges and needs.
Dean pants for breath. "You‚Ä¶ How can you think that this is how a relationship works? I can't just use you! That I'm your boyfriend doesn't give me a right to your body. Jesus!"
Dean huffs a mirthless laugh. "I should probably get an ice-pack for that."
Charlie nods and bites the inside of her cheek. Dean scrutinises her for a long moment as she stares at the drying rack, tea towel in hand without moving.
Castiel lets out a loud breath. "I know you still can't take compliments. But I made it my mission to train you to accept them." He smirks.
Castiel opens the door forcefully and presses past Dean who takes a moment to take in his boyfriend's fitness outfit. The shirt‚ÄîDean's favourite Jason Mraz tee‚Äîrides up when Castiel fishes his trainers from the top shelf of the shoe cabinet.
"Why?" Castiel probes. "I like it."
"I can let it be if you don't like it. No problem, buddy." He pats on Castiel's shoulder.
He stares into Castiel's sparkling eyes a moment too long, and both their laughter runs dry. Sam would tell him not to let his dick dictate his actions, but Dean's dick has no say in this anyway.
"Oh, that tight ass would've been mine, sha." Benny smirks. Even after all these years, Dean isn't sure if his mate likes men too or is just confident enough in his sexuality to joke like that.
The man tilts his head to the side and Dean starts seeing the family resemblance. "I think that they complement each other very well. I would have expected Sam's best man to see that, too."
If they knew that most of his one-night stands end with him playing possum after ringing his bedmate's bell, that he does it for hugs and soft kisses against his neck, for being held through the night or to hold someone else‚Äîthey would call him a freak. Hell, he calls himself that often enough.
"How? How is it normal? I can't have a normal relationship without sex! I fall in love, I want to be with someone, and then I'll have to fake it as long as I can? In what universe is that normal!?"
"Why would you mess it up? You two seem to be made for each other."
The waitress gives him a warm smile as he puts a dollar note on the table. He will have to walk home from work once because of it.
Castiel snorts. "Punk rock was never my type of music."
Castiel studies the menu intensively, the crease on his forehead growing deeper every passing second.
"You have a point. But did you talk about it?"
Castiel moves his lips. It's hard to form words. But he has to. For Dean.
Castiel hums. "I know that now. But a few weeks don't erase a quarter of a century thinking otherwise. There are moments when I still have the impulse to please you sexually, when I think I might lose you because of how I am."
He missed him last night on his day off. Alfie was nice to work with, but nothing compared to Dean's company. And if it made anything clear, then it was that Castiel caught the worst bug possible‚Äîfeelings.
"I do this because I want to 'live', Dean. I hurt my body with the amount of alcohol I put in it. I was also malnourished for years, and my family is prone to diabetes. I take care of what I put in my system and when.
Thankfully, Castiel takes Dean's words at face value and looks around the room, taking in the details that escaped his tired eyes this morning. Dean's room is tidy, but still comfy, with posters on the wall, little knick-knacks scattered over the shelves, many funko pops of characters Castiel doesn't know, and even more books. The room fits the man who lives here. Castiel wonders what Dean would make of his room in the residential group. The sheer thought of Dean ever being there makes Castiel nauseous.
"Dean?"
Charlie pulls him into a side hug. "He'll come back. He just needs to let out some steam," she tells him.
Castiel laughs wetly. "But if he breaks up with me, we won't see each other again. I know my place, Charlie. I've been there before. The last time ended in a two-year-long bender."
It's a challenge to convince Dean to meet him on the bus, but Castiel persuades him that it would be silly to pick him up just to drive past his own bus stop. Dean wasn't happy about it but gave in eventually.
"Sorry you had to drag me up the stairs. I sure was a dead weight."
"I have no idea whatcha talking about," Dean says, collects the empty bottles from the coffee table, and carries them to the kitchen. He's well aware that his cheeks burn like fire for everyone to see.
Castiel wants to thank him, but the front door is opened, and a brunette all but flies down the stairs.
Dean slumps against the doorframe and pushes his thumbs into the waistband of his pyjama pants. "Because it would hurt you like it did Lisa, and I didn't want to lose you."
told me you wanted to grow old with me. I can't see you putting any effort into that project, though." He folds his arms over his chest and stares Dean down.
Dean pulls out before Castiel emerges on the other side, his erection already flagging. He tries to get up to get a wet washcloth but Castiel paws on him. "Cuddles," he whines, and Dean chuckles as he falls back into bed and wraps himself around his sex-drunk lover.
The corners of Castiel's lips twitch. "So was I."
Leaving Lisa and Ben had hurt like a bitch. And Castiel held him after a nightmare in which Dean dreamt they were taken by vampires. He had been so angry at him, shouting that it was all his fault. And Castiel had looked at him with sad eyes, saying, "I know."
"And you don't like that?" the woman asks. Hell, Dean doesn't even know their names and spills all the beans, probably making an ass of himself.
"Nothing's wrong with you, babe. Being ace is perfectly normal."
Dean blinks himself out of his trance. How long was he zoned out?. "Yeah, just‚ÄîI never really made it out of the States. Who knows, maybe you'll show me the world one day." He gives Castiel a smirk. They both know that their income doesn't give room for much more than a camping trip, and Dean isn't sure if that's appealing to someone who used to live in the street.
"Hello?" the voice comes again.
"No, you don't! Just gimme a moment."
"Is that an offer?" his mouth asks without his consent.
"Thank you, Dean. This is wonderful. You are truly talented."
The last weeks were the best in Dean's life. Castiel and he just clicked. And now, what they shared will be gone within minutes.
Castiel is still stuck on the new nickname. No one has ever given him one. He was either Castiel or Mr Novak. Okay, Cassie by his siblings and Asstiel by his cousin Metty. He hated both names with a passion. But this is nice. Dean is nice. Sometimes a bit irritating, but most people are to Castiel. Just as much as he is to them.
Charlie eyes him for a long moment. "Your calorie intake isn't exactly healthy either."
"Yes." Castiel shrugs. "Not as often as you. Thank God! It's so annoying."
"Yeah. A little too much," Dean says, blushing fiercely as Castiel presses in and feels his arousal.
He wakes up in the late afternoon and takes a shower in the communal bathroom. The soup kitchen around the corner is already closed. Until he gets paid the next week, the little money that he has only suffices to pay for the bus fees and his necessary trip to the laundromat. He shouldn't have bought the dress shirt for his interview. It hadn't been necessary.
Dean squints at the full back seat and footwell of his car. "You own even more?"
The whole day, Castiel had looked forward to seeing Dean again. Dean, who makes him feel seen and accepted like no one ever did. Not even Hannah or any of his exes.
"You must be Dean," she says, stretching out her hand. Dean is taken aback by her knowledge.
Castiel hasn't moved for miles. Why would he? Dean's head is the sweetest weight. And Dean is so close.
"Impossible." Dean smiles and pulls him into a long kiss.
Minutes pass, and the noises of pleasure that fall from Dean's lips sound as if they belonged to someone else. Does his body know how it should react to what his boyfriend is giving him, or is it a trained response, Pavlovian conditioning? Dean doesn't know. He has faked it for as long as he can remember.
Castiel presses a soft kiss on his lips and leans his forehead against Dean's. "Thank you. You're an angel."
"Cass. Please. Listen. This came out the wrong way. I didn't mean‚Äî"
Castiel slumps face-forward into his bed.
"Don't you like them on the bookshelves in the living room?"
Dean chews his lip. "Maybe until the handfasting‚Äî"
Hannah is shuffling her feet, hands pushed into the pockets of her jeans. "When you were gone, whenever I was at a place I thought of you, one that I would have loved to show you, or where I saw something reminding me of you, I bought a postcard and wrote about it. I‚Ä¶ It's probably stupid, and you don't have to read them, okay? I just wanted you to know that they exist, and‚Ä¶" She runs a hand over her neck.
Castiel turns his eyes back to the menu. It's hard for him to think about them like that. Sure, they used him as a wallet and a sex toy. But it was him who tried to win their love with gifts and sexual favours.
Castiel brushes his lips against Dean's. "You're amazing and grace."
Castiel tilts his head to the side. "We know everything we need to know. I know you're a big-hearted teddy bear, a doer, a carer. You have the common touch, are good with your hands‚Ä¶"
The silence stretches into an eternity until Castiel quietly says, "Good night," leaving Dean alone in the pale moonlight.
"I'm lucky that you love me. Period."
Sam's eyes grow wide, just as Dean had hoped they would. "You think about moving back? Dean, that's‚Ä¶"
"I don't want sex," he blurts out.
Castiel's lips move, but no sound falls from them. His eyes flicker through the room as if he couldn't stand looking at his boyfriend.
He's hung up on the thought that he might have a serious crush on his co-worker. That little bastard somehow wormed himself through every microfissure in the wall that Dean built around his heart, and in record time.
"My body doesn't seem to get the memo to stop putting on weight," Castiel grinds out.
"It's not like coming out as gay or bi. Most people get that you can't help but fall in love with someone of your own gender if you're wired like that. But outing myself as ace always brings questions about my partner. I didn't want to bring Liz or you into a situation to be questioned about what we do or not do, or for others to pity you."
Castiel swallows hard. Shame washes over his skin and ties his stomach into knots. "Close to St Mark's."
"Yeah. He'll break up with me. Just because it might be a valid orientation, doesn't mean that he'll put up with my shit."
Dean bites his lip. Great way to make a good impression on potential in-laws‚Äîalluding to their son's sexual skills. He kicks himself inwardly. His urge to defend his boyfriend should be channelled in better ways.
Dean turns to the door, and Castiel finds his words again. "I will. I promise. Don't leave me. Please," he begs.
She pulls him into her arms, allowing him to hide his tears on her shoulder. "I know. It'll be fine." She just hopes that she won't have to help Dean pick up the pieces of his shattered heart once again.
"I told him the truth. That we weren't meant to be. He's not one to poke."
Dean shrugs. "I told him that this isn't healthy."
Dean pales. "I do what!? And you didn't tell me?"
house already though, even though they are only moving in today.
Dean is so proud of Sam, of how he made his way, found purpose and love. He's a little bit proud of himself, too, that he raised him so well, that his little brother turned out not half as fucked up as Dean thinks of himself to be. Sure, he could have done other things, could have been a big shot lawyer or something. Sammy's got the brains. But his smartness led him another way, one where he's getting by and can live without work consuming him. He has a good life, a good wife now, and a house that they'll make a home.
Dean leans over the breakfast counter and takes Castiel's cheek in his hand. "That's my job. I want you to be happy and safe. I just‚Ä¶ I might better work on my wording. I didn't mean to imply that you weren't qualified. You're much smarter than everyone I know."
Charlie shakes her red waves. "We've postponed it to after the wedding. That will be enough pressure for you."
their relationship combusts, it will be so much worse with them sharing a flat. But they've traipsed round every single room for rent in town and it rained one rejection after the next. One time because Castiel is a man, the next because he has been homeless, and the last time most likely because he made the mistake of mentioning that Dean is his boyfriend. Castiel just can't catch a break.
"I'm happy for you, Liz. I know it was always your dream."
The umpteenth bee is flying around them, although they polished off both their pizzas and tiramisus. "I know bees are important, but they are so annoying," Dean groans.
"In a living group."
"And what does grey mean?"
Castiel shrugs and busies himself with cutting the bread into slices and spreading butter on them. "I knew you wouldn't think it proper. And I didn't plan not to eat. I was just so busy that I forgot. And then Kevin came, and‚Ä¶ I'm so sorry Dean. I never meant to betray you or make you worry."
Castiel nods and leans back in his chair. "Then why didn't you just tell me?"
"But he's not Lisa. He was shocked, like all of us. But I'm sure you two can talk it out."
She nods. "I wish I could hunt down the assholes that consigned you to your fate."
"Hiya, Cass. Oh, you brought popcorn. Awesome!"
Castiel smiles at him with closed lips and so much fondness that Dean wants to hide from its warmth and bathe in it at the same time. "You did, right from the start, Dean. I don't need the word to know it."
"So I heard," Castiel's mother says. "A mechanic."
Dean grins at him. "They'll love their uncle. You'll see."
"Did he?"
Dean furrows his brow but doesn't comment. It's just food. Everyone can read the termination time on the label and throw the expired stuff in the bin. He shrugs it off. Castiel is weird sometimes, but he looks happy about this, so why piss on the poor man's parade?
Dean smiles softly and pulls him into a hug. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me." He presses a kiss to Castiel's neck, and his boyfriend tilts his head to give him more room to press a trail down from behind his ear to the neckline of his shirt. "You smell like my bodywash," Dean breathes, and the words tickle deliciously on Castiel's skin.
"Hey, Princess Aurora," Sam says when Dean opens his eyes.
She looks surprised but nods. "Okay. Good. I gotta change and start work then."
"I get it," Dean says, although he probably doesn't.
Dean ponders his options to take a bit off the next day's stress. Maybe, when Castiel has fallen asleep in post-orgasmic bliss, he could get up and prepare the pasta salad and the burger patties. Better late at night than early in the morning.
Castiel gives him a close-lipped smile. "I do, Dean. It's just‚Ä¶ I feel rejected and that's
Castiel takes a steadying breath. He worked through without a break. He chuckles. He was fully in the zone, just like he used to be in the past. He smiles to himself, pride spreading in his chest.
"Would you fly to Montana with me to spend Thanksgiving with my family?" Castiel asks as he watches Dean picking a movie for their night in.
Castiel doesn't know how to answer the question without revealing too much of himself to a room full of strangers and the man he crushes on so hard that he would die of embarrassment if he ever learnt about what a loser he is.
Castiel makes a disapproving noise in the back of his throat. "Don't apologise. That's just you. I don't even get aroused by looking at you."
"Jesus! Men don't cuddle, Cass."
"Oh," the blond smirks. "Cassie is a top? Interesting."
"Cass?" Dean asks, surprised.
Jo returns with their drinks and a basket of bread with an assortment of differently flavoured kinds of butter. "On the house. Mum says your beau deserves a three-course menu if he can make you blush like this."
Besides, Castiel thinks that Dean is the softest and cutest and most wholesome being in the universe. Yes, warts and all. But they are still learning each other and Dean hasn't let his guard down enough for Castiel to shower him with all the adjectives he wants to spread over his boyfriend's skin until their truth sinks fully into his body, into his beautiful soul.
"Most of them are kind people," Sam says carefully. "And after tomorrow, Rowena is your family, too."
Dean chews his lip. "So, you should know," he all but whispers.
"He has no‚Äîoh god!" she utters when Castiel pulls the silver bottle out of Dean's jacket.
"For as long as you'll have me," Castiel whispers.
Dean raises an eyebrow and chuckles. "You really got it bad, huh?"
"He's a quick learner," Dean states, looking over to where Castiel is bent forward, stocking the shelves with nut bags.
Castiel switches off the water boiler. "Through the snow?"
"B," Dean had said, flashing him his most winsome smile. He had never said it out loud before that moment. Why define who you are if you only share a bed for one night?
"Dumped her useless husband and moved to a friend up north."
Dean stares at the red light in front of him. He hasn't seen Lisa since they broke up ten months ago.
Dean walks back into the house to get a refreshment, and when he opens the fridge, he looks at the bottles, thunderstruck.
"Yeah. They'll raise the price. But it's fine. I make more in the garage, so‚Ä¶" He shrugs.
Her face lights up. "Your card collection."
"So, you could go to college, if you wanted, right?" Crowley asks.
Castiel's hands clench and unclench, and Dean wonders why his boyfriend is so agitated about it. It's eating two hours earlier than usual. It can't be
Dean nods, regretting it immediately. Stupid hangover!
"Putting others down, including yourself, isn't a good way to compliment someone," Castiel softly reprimands.
"‚ÄôM fine," Dean slurs. His breath doesn't smell like alcohol. The whole situation doesn't make any sense.
Dean chuckles. "I have to lead the bride to the altar, right?" He ruffles Sam's hair. His brother glares at him, but without heat.
Garth raises his eyebrows. "See ya tomorrow, boss."
His eyes fall on the coffee table, and his heart clenches painfully. There they are. The notes from the last four days, slightly crumpled but carefully laid out.
"Mo what?"
Dean sets the alarm on his phone in case he dozes off and gives his eyes some rest. There is no use in mourning after the what-could-have-beens. He brought it all on himself. He and his stupid dick.
Dean tries to stay on top of the conversation, but everyone has strange names, and the family dynamics make it difficult to follow.
Castiel nods and folds his hands in his lap. It's always better to let Dean work through his thoughts, to wait him out.
"Winchester, you're a buzzkill," Stevie says, but her eyes are soft. "So, Rowena, Sam, how far have you come with the handfasting ceremony?"
"As if I'd risk your wrath. No. I just thought‚ÄîCastiel is still losing weight."
"You're doing well, Castiel." He smiles shyly in response. Missouri had been good to him. Always understanding but with a big helping of tough love whenever needed. He wouldn't have come so far without her.
His smile still comes naturally when Dean catches sight of him. They've been separated for only two hours, but it feels like a lifetime. Some things never change, no matter how old you are. When you fall in love, you at least partly regress to a teenager. It's a blessing, and Castiel won't fight it.
Dean pats his back. "I'm happy for you man." He's surprised that he means it.
Dean's lips curl into a soft smile. He brushes a hand through his boyfriend's hair. "Yeah." He nudges Castiel's nose with his own. "That sounds perfect."
Dean chuckles. "You don't. Don't worry about that. It's fine. I get it. I want to pinch myself sometimes. It seems to be too good to be true, finding someone like me, and falling in love with him."
He pushes the newspapers much harder than necessary on the shelves. He doesn't know why he's so angry all of a sudden. He didn't think of sex and his inability to enjoy it since the last time he swapped a blowjob for pizza. It was the last time he got so wasted that he ended up in the drunk tank. There had been a life-threatening attempt to quit cold turkey after that and some slip-ups in his recovering process, but he didn't have to touch a dick for nearly a year now. And now he's jealous?
However, Dean doesn't allow himself to let go like this often. He has a reputation to uphold, after all. That's why he only drops by if he has two days off in a row, and he gets some good night's sleep for once. Otherwise, he would fall asleep, drooling on some rosebud tea or something.
Dean smirks at him. "You know me too well." His features grow more serious after that, and he runs his fingers over the zipper of Castiel's hoodie. "Thanks, man. For everything. I know I was an ass the first few days. I'm sorry."
"You're not‚Ä¶? Cass!"
Castiel chuckles. "I've seen you already prepared our savoury food."
"Nah. You're ace. I would never‚Ä¶"
He stares at her for a long moment. "Oh, because of Dean? Don't worry. He always talks very highly of you."
Castiel pushes his jaw forward and nods. "Still‚Ä¶ I thought you trusted me with everything. I was your friend then, wasn't I?" His eyes look tired and red when he fixes them on Dean's gaze.
"I have a good influence on you," Castiel states a little smugly and pulls Dean into a kiss.
He pulls off and grins. "Don't you wanna?"
The smile on her face grows even wider. "I brought it here, actually. As I know my brother, his walls are still bare, am I right?"
"And that you didn't ask him has nothing to do with the wee angel that ye can't stop gushing over?" Rowena asks, a teasing smirk wide on display. Yes, punching someone in the face would feel very satisfying right now.
Dean waves him off. "It's nothing. This community was good to me and Sammy when we came here. I just want to give something back. That's all. And those men‚Äîwhen you lost everything, you deserve at least to look at a holeless wall in nice colours and have a shower with a steady pressure that's not running cold. The poor bastards have been through enough."
Dean pulls him into a long hug. They both linger, not ready to let go. Later, Castiel can still feel where their bodies touched when he's lying in his bed, bright awake, and not only because Cain is snoring like a bear.
"Welcome home, Dean," Charlie chirps, and boxes playfully against his arm. "Looking good, man."
"Hi, Dean. Everything okay?"
Dean's eyes sink to the floor.
"And?" Dean asks defensively. "He's training a lot."
Castiel looks up from the computer. "Have you ever loved me or was I just a weird rebound?"
Morning comes way too early. Dean grumbles something unintelligible as he tries to swipe away the alarm for the third time.
They fall silent for a long moment until Dean nods. "You're right. I just‚Äî He was my hero for such a long time. What sense does it make to rock the boat, now that he's gone."
'Broken & Beautiful' blasts over the headphones, and Castiel bites back the tears that are pricking his eyes. He feels the lyrics in his bones. The crux is that he doesn't know how to ask Dean for just holding him through the rough moments. Dean wants to help. Castiel knows that. It's not even an attempt to fix him because, for unfathomable reasons, Dean doesn't think he's broken.
Castiel hums his response. He's not sure if he could form proper words with the tightness in his throat. He's nervous. Not about the blow job. He masters the technique. But he knows he'll break the wall today, and everything may come crashing down afterwards. The same could happen if he postpones sex to the last possible moment, though, so‚Ä¶
He enjoys the little details of a man's body‚Äîa three-day stubble or a smooth-shaven jaw, callused hands, a little dirt on his forehead from work, unexposed veins on forearms that he could trail with his fingers. Although Dean is nearly too tanned for that. Maybe in the winter. If they'll make it this far.
He doesn't know how long he's been in the stall, trying to get himself off, when somebody enters the room. Not just anybody.
Dean walks to the other side from where the redhead smiled over to him. Maybe she can point him to the object of his hate. She tilts her head to the side when he comes closer.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek and tries to unclench his fists. It isn't working.
"Nothing. Shit!"
He hastens to the front where Dean and Lisa are talking, she already without her vest, clearly clocked out. Castiel stalls for a second, eyes fixed on her hand touching Dean's arm. He takes a deep breath, pushes the flare-up of jealousy away, and walks to Garth, ignoring the two for the time being.
"Aye-aye, ma'am!"
"Since always. It was my greatest joy, the best way to relax. I just don't have a garden to tend to anymore." Castiel smiles to himself. Dean loves this face. He doesn't see it often enough. "The system would have worked if I wouldn't have made a mistake with the conversion from the metric system. I did it in my last garden and it was perfect."
"Don't let him fool you. He already called Nora and said he's back on Monday." Dean can hear the eye-roll in Castiel's voice.
"Bitch," his brother replies with little heat.
It's a house to be filled with memories. A home, like maybe only the bunker ever was to Dean. It's full of things, some shiny and new, some old, given a second life. Just like them.
He slumps into his pillow and turns slowly on his side. Maybe Castiel will fill in the blanks later.
Dean chuckles self-deprecatingly. "We had a good thing going, Liz, and then I dropped the ace bomb, destroying everything. I won't repeat that."
Castiel opens his mouth but the words don't come. How could he explain how freeing not eating is? How much control it gives him in a phase of his life where pretty much everything is unsettling and new.
"I don't know if my parents still have their old cook. But they always had excellent personnel," Castiel muses.
Dean smiles despite the headache still drumming in his head. He swallows the pills and slowly shuffles to the kitchen. "Morning," he croaks.
"Hmm."
Dean huffs a laugh and runs a hand over his face before he grabs the mug and blows over the hot beverage. "He lied to me. Several times."
Sometimes, Dean nearly chokes on Castiel's affection. It's so unprecedented for him. Castiel loves without all those stupid stops and rules that normal humans put into a developing relationship. He doesn't care about labels or the right chronological order of doing stuff. He suggested moving in together before they so much as made out. They kissed for the first time after he had sucked Dean off. And after everything in Dean's past feels like a big fat lie‚Äîeverything save his brother's and Castiel's love‚Äîhe doesn't hold on to those behaviour rules any longer either. Why would he? He's missed out on so many things.
"You haven't talked with him yet?"
Dean gives him a fake once-over and decides to go with the truth for once. "Yeah. But it's too late for that now." He flashes him a grin and puts the scrambled eggs on the tray, struggling with balancing the full mugs on it as graciously as he manages while simultaneously swaying his ass. Benny's full-belly laugh is worth the effort, though.
She looks at him with wide eyes. "You‚Äîhave you never heard about asexuality?"
It's an hour of walking one way, but the summer squash soup and the risotto are worth it. Nothing against canteen food. He just likes it when a meal tastes like more than calories.
"Who says I'm sharing?"
"I was going through a rough time," he starts. Dean and Charlie prepared him for this part of the interview. None of them had thought to include Naomi in the role play, though.
But of course, it does.
"Whatcha got for me?" Dean asks on their way home.
Dean furrows his brow. Everything inside him screams that she is wrong. "I can stop anytime," he argues.
"Tea would be great." Kevin looks at the sparsely decorated room. His eyes fall on the photo frame. "Your boyfriend?"
He pushes a package of painkillers over the table instead and watches how Dean's Adam's apple bobs when he swallows them down. He shouldn't look at Dean like this.
They exit the bus together. Castiel steals glances at Dean who got up after Castiel pressed the stop button. But Dean seems to be half-asleep. Castiel knows better than to trust the stranger, though. He was way too credulous in the past. He has learnt his lesson.
Now, Castiel's heart is bursting for sure, but he keeps the shell pulled tight. "Like a friend?"
"For me too, dearest. But make it Scottish and a double."
Careful not to let his boyfriend see it, he puts a small, cheesy note between the sandwiches. He smiles to himself, already looking forward to the flood of heart emojis he will likely find on his phone at his own lunch break.
"I used to run in the past. It was an intrinsic part of me, Dean. I'm just reclaiming myself, okay?"
Castiel leans his forehead against his. "I love you, Dean. This doesn't change anything. At best, it will make me a better partner for you and a good ally for the ace community."
Dean brushes his nose over Castiel's neck. "Just you, and Baby, and the open road. That's all I need to be happy," he murmurs.
Dean lets go of him and folds his arms over his chest. "Let me at least be a Rottweiler."
Dean huffs a laugh. "Well. Then we can be dumbasses together." He sits down next to Castiel. "I'm not good at this, man. I'm a shit boyfriend."
Castiel rolls his eyes before he closes them and allows Dean to lead him over the snow-covered path. Both laugh when they slide over a few frozen puddles.
A strong yet tender hand sprawls over his chest. "It's okay. Why do you freak out like that?"
Dean huffs a laugh. "You're good, man."
"Do you want to go home?"
Castiel feels like hit by a truck. It's the first time that both of them referred to each other as boyfriends. This is big. Especially for Dean, who has only been with women when it came to long-ish term relationships.
Dean groans. "I'm not a baby, Charles."
Castiel has a good feeling about his replacement.
Dean leans in and presses a tender kiss on Castiel's lips. They are softer than expected. The moment this thought materialises, Dean's brain comes back online again and
only feigned liking to have sex with me? Or is there something else we can add to the list?" Dean clicks his mouth shut and wills the tears welling up in his eyes to retract. Castiel shakes his head. "I'm in my study." He takes his mug and brushes past Dean.
"...simply a natural reaction of your body, Dean. I get hard, too."
Castiel's eyes grow wide. "Can you see the park from your room? It's so beautiful in spring."
Castiel screws up his face. "How did you meet her?"
"Jerk."
Dean chuckles. "Yeah."
Loving son and brother, friend, saviour, bisexual man, surrogate father, and boyfriend. He's more than a hunter, more than a piece on Chuck's checkerboard, more than the sum of his mistakes. He has loved, and he has failed. And despite it all, he is proud. Not too much. But he can feel it, burning in his chest. He is valid and worthy of having it all.
Dean presses a soft kiss into his boyfriend's hair.
"You said it was a mistake to move in with Lisa so quickly," Charlie says carefully.
"Aye-aye, ma'am!" Dean salutes and winks at her.
Charlie grabs his hand. "We're all here for you. You know that, right?"
"He's very vivid," Castiel states when Garth has disappeared through the front door.
"You'll blind Hannah's kids."
Castiel loves it when Dean rolls or pushes up his sleeves. There is something exhilarating about seeing this part of him exposed while the rest is well-hidden under clothes.
His phone ringing doesn't raise his mood until he sees it's Sam. "Hey, what's up, man?" he asks over speakerphone.
Dean dallies with nearly everyone he meets, no matter if old or young, man, woman, or beyond the binary. He's such a flirt, and Castiel hates it. Maybe because he doesn't flirt with
"Okay, I'll show you how to work the till, then how to operate the heavy machinery."
Dean turns to him and smirks. "Am I?"
"What's up?"
"It's not like that. You know that, right?"
He flushes the toilet and washes his face with cold water. After a look into the mirror, he declares himself passable and puts on a smile, waiting until it appears believable.
"An asshole who gives good head, though," Castiel says smugly.
"I am upset. But I understand that keeping this to yourself must have been hard for you. We'll have to talk.
Castiel pulls back first, and Dean, eyes still closed, chases his lips, before a smile tugs on the corners of his mouth. He opens his eyes and stares into Castiel's narrow ones.
When the men lose, Benny puts the blame copiously on Castiel. Dean and Sam defend him, but Benny is too tipsy by now to stop. Castiel excuses himself to the bathroom. He may feel pathetic with pretty much everything he touches, but he won't be a crybaby in front of Dean.
In front of the house entrance, he stops. Charlie's words give him pause. Is there something like eating too healthy? Sure, Castiel restricts his eating time, but he showed Dean all these studies proving how healthy that is. And Castiel chows plenty in his eating window, he simply cares about the quality. No, Charlie is just overprotective. It's kinda sweet that she cares so much for his boyfriend.
Rowena has a power over Sam that makes Dean's stomach flip. She conjures sappy smiles on Sam's face and makes him follow her like a love-drunk puppy. She's a witch, Dean is convinced, but he tries hard not to mention that in Sammy's orbit. He heard the whole that's-a-misogynistic-term speech when Sam was dating that Ruby chick and Dean knows that his brother would only cling closer to the Scot if he knew that Dean thinks that his fianc√©e is straight from hell.
Dean nods. "It's alright, Liz. I blew it. Should've kept it to myself."
"You can have a beehive again. I spoke with the neighbours. They're not half as creepy or boring as I thought. That's why I went to the farmers' market. The guy who sells your favourite honey said he could give you a bee colony next year."
"I always want to kiss you," he says matter-of-factly, and presses a kiss into Dean's hair to prove it. Dean tilts his head back, and vulnerable eyes meet Castiel's. They flicker to his lips, and with a sigh, Castiel understands. He brushes his fingers through Dean's short hair and leans forward. He presses chapped lips to soft ones, and both breathe out in relief.
