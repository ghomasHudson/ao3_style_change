Peter glanced from his father to the other four men, then his eyes met Wades and he pulled his mouth into a twisted smile. "I choose Steve. The rest of you can fuck off."
Tony stayed silent for a while after that and for a moment Peter thought he had done it, he had convinced Tony that there was no recovery for him, that he was nothing but an inconvenience in his life.
"Accept the freaking compliment. ", he said with that cheeky fucking smile of his that was killing Wade and goddamn, now he got him to smile as well.
Gwen was the hopeful one, or maybe not hopeful, but she was resilient, tough as nails. In the end she broke as well. Peter broke her. Like everything he touched. His chest grew tight with the memory of her.
The boy hesitated, then he shook his head slightly. Right, Bucky knew that feeling. "We met- once. I used to be HYDRA's marionette. I trained you once, you and a girl. They called me the Winter Soldier." The boys eyes grew even larger, if that was even possible, but he still didn't say anything, so Bucky just continued.
"I... I tried to kill myself. ", he confessed and a heavy silence seemed to settle over them. That was to be expected with an admission like that but Peter felt the need to explain himself.
Getting used to something nice is never a good idea. He learned that the hard way. Golden hair came to mind, blue eyes, a cheeky smile. Peter's chest grew tight with the memories of her. He pushed them away. He made the mistake of getting attached once already, never again.
Wade carefully placed his hands on Peter's shoulders, trying to look him in the eyes but failing. "Peter- no one will punish you. No one will hurt you, I promise.", Wade whispered.
"Then why not let him call the cops? You know, I did technically kidnap you.",Wade pointed out before narrowing his eyes at Peter. "Maybe you should slow down a little or you might puke."
"Yeah three years ago, once I was released from SHIELD. Steve took me. It was one of the first things he did. Like he promised.", Bucky replied. This was a pleasant memory. Even though Bucky had still been half out of his mind back then, even though he couldn't remember his dream of seeing the Grand Canyon, even though Steve had to practically drag him there. It had been absolutely amazing. They spend a week there, camping underneath the open sky. No one around them but each other. It had been perfect. Bucky's heart ached with how perfect it had been. He had started to piece the broken shards of his mind back together at the bottom of that canyon.
Tony's eyes glanced over at Wade but the other man only gave him a helpless shrug. "You- We don't expect you to talk about anything that happened... All I'm asking of you is to tell us when something makes you uncomfortable.", Tony tried to rephrase it. He was met with a puzzled expression, narrowed eyes, furrowed eyebrows. He thought of Harley and how Peter waved him off, not seeming genuine at all.
"What?", Wade asked and Peter couldn't tell if he was shocked by the question or genuinely didn't understand Peter.
Peter swallowed before answering. "Can't sleep. The usual. Wade's asleep, though. He sounds like a walrus when he snores. I mean, I don't really know what a walrus sounds like but I imagine it to sound like that.", Peter replied and Steve was pretty sure he saw a smile curl around his lips. "Anyways, I was actually looking for Bucky."
That's how his next week went. He got up, they went to SHIELD where they were told that Peter refused to see them. He'd listen to their progress.
, this was a mistake. Then again, Peter didn't want to be wrapped up in bubble wrap anymore. But maybe Steve moved too fast, too harsh.
He looked up at Keipon as he stepped through the door, hesitating for a second and turning back around to face Peter one last time. "You truly are my greatest disappointment.", Keipon told him and Peter wished that he could kill the part of him that felt bad for that.
That didn't mean that she couldn't bring them up to taunt Wade, which she did, thoroughly. Starting from the way she looked, usually either taking on Vanessa's or Peter's appearance, all the way down to their surroundings. They always meet in Wade and Vanessa's old bedroom.
Wade looked around them, assessing the situation. Just a dozen guards stood between them and that hallway.
Peter didn't back down though. On the contrary, he pushed himself off the wall and for a second Wade thought he'd crash but instead he landed on his feet perfectly, it was almost elegant and Wade marveled at what good some food and sleep did for Peter. The boy turned his back towards Wade and looked outside instead, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his jeans. Outside, the sun was rising and Wade could now only see Peter's dark silhouette against the pink sky.
The song lyrics in this are from Matt Maeson's new song 'I just don't care that much'. His whole music also partially inspired this story. Idk, I just love him.
"Whatever. Why did you ignore me then, if it wasn't me. I mean... It's been three months.", he went on, and again, he sounded way sharper then intended but at this point he'd rather come off as pissed then scared.
It was bad enough that Tony had to deal with Peter in his life. He really didn't want to do that to anyone else.
**-summary: Death tells Wade to cheer up and kisses him. Wade fakes a smile and tries to imagine that he's kissing Peter instead. Death tells him to undress and he does. They make out and Wade contemplates if he is in hell. He thinks about Peter and how he'd never treat him like this and comes to the conclusion that Peter is worth the pain.
"Everybody but you.", Death agreed before stepping closer and pulling him into a kiss and when his lips met hers they weren't bone. They were soft and warm and human, they reminded him of Vanessa, of home. And then they were gone. Just like her.
"I- I need to see him, can I- can I see him?", Tony stammered, stumbling towards Steve, eyeing the door like Peter would enter the room any second. There was a spark in his eyes that Steve had never seen before. Something like hope. It broke Steve's heart that he had to tell Tony the truth first.
If that didn't amplify Peter's existential dread he didn't know what would've. With an annoyed huff he turned the music off again, surrendering the two of them to silence once more.
"Not really but we were desperate.", Tony confessed. "So what else can you tell us?", the hopelessness was gone, replaced by determination, it was a good look for the Tinman.
"And what did you say?", he asked, trying to sound as unbothered as Peter. If Peter noticed Bucky's concern he didn't mention it.
How would they do it? Hold his head under water until it felt like it was about to burst? Let electricity run through his veins until he felt like every fiber of his being was on fire? Whip his back until his whole skin was torn to shreds? Or maybe they'd make him do it himself. Some agents preferred that, the humiliation of it. They liked to watch and listen to his tortured screams as he mutilated himself.
"A therapist? You want me to talk to a complete stranger?", Peter asked, obvious offense in his voice.
"I'll miss you. ", Peter admitted. He wished he could stay in this comfortable bubble, he wished that things didn't have to change, that he didn't have to hope and fight and forgive anymore.
"Peter?", Wade asked, taking a step closer but Peter couldn't bear his pity right now. He couldn't stand Wade anywhere near him when he was feeling this awful. He wanted to hide away. He didn't want anyone to ever lay eyes or hands on him ever again.
"Ahh, almost forgot, enhanced healing and super fast metabolism. But the healing kinda fucks up if I don't eat or sleep enough for a long time.", he then added, his voice muffled by the food in his mouth.
"This is awful...! Who enjoys that?!", he exclaimed after he finally stopped coughing, his throat felt raw and and weird.
Bucky mostly stuck to the plan of taking Peter to beautiful spots in nature. He was basically dragged across half the US from one national park to another. Peter didn't mind it, though. He didn't want to be in cities, didn't want people around him. He didn't want to stay in any place too long.
"Wade, how completely unpredictable. What are you doing here?", Fake-Peter asked sarcastically and even though Wade knew that it wasn't him the sound of his voice still made his heart ache.
"What was that about?", she asked, her neutral demeanour back in place. Peter let out a deep sigh, dropping his head into his hands before noticing his cigarette that had gone out by now. He flicked it away before facing MJ again.
"I- I never- Wade didn't-", Peter began to stutter. He and Wade had never managed to do anything, Peter didn't even know if Wade shared his feelings, Peter died before Wade could explain himself.
Peter still didn't face him when he replied:"Well, I'm healthy again, I'm a burden and a waste of space, I invaded your privacy, I let you think that I couldn't speak for a whole week-"
For a second Tony could only watch, until he saw that Peter was squeezing some of the shards in his shaking hands until crimson blood sprung from where the porcelain cut through his skin.
"Remind me why we are trusting her.", Peter scoffed before taking a final drag and flicking the cigarette bud away. This was really not the time for Wade to get turned on but
"Don't mention it.", Peter shrugged. He didn't really recognize the person he was back there, he didn't hate it though, he felt good because he helped someone, because he was more than just a problem for once.
"You can't know that.", Peter stated, defeat in his voice. That might've been true, if Bucky didn't have a very concrete understanding of how much forgiveness Tony Stark was capable of.
Bucky could tell that he was trying to stay awake, that he was scared to sleep. "It's okay, kid. You can sleep. I'll watch out for you." The boy nodded slowly, before his eyes finally shut completely and his breathing slowed down.
With a handful of warm water (he couldn't handle anything else) he washed his face, washed away the blood and vomit and sweat. In a weak attempt to salvage something he tried to brush the mess that he called his hair into some shape before quickly giving up. "You're just sick. You'll get better.", he repeated what Wade told him the other night. It felt hollow. With that he turned around and stepped outside the bathroom again.
Sure, Wade probably only offered it out of pity and probably wasn't serious but Peter tried to push that thought away.
He stared at his feet like they knew the answer before saying:"I'm dangerous." Tony wanted to protest right away but Bucky held up his hand in order to stop him, he was telling him to listen, so Tony did. "I'm dangerous, Natasha was right about that, and you can't afford to ignore that. So I need to be deprogrammed. But I can't go to SHIELD or some other lab, it'll kill me. So I need Bucky. He's been through this, he can help me. I also need him to... stop me, if I get bad again. Okay?"
"You're awake.", Gwen stated with no particular tone to her voice. It weren't even her actions that disturbed him, not really. It was the careless, blasé way she went about it.
"I- I woke up and y-you were gone and I thought-", Gwen stammered breathlessly before her voice fizzled out.
He refused to address whatever happened this morning once he left the bathroom, not a surprise but still. Wade was concerned.
"It's the quinjet alarm. ", Steve stated. Tony's eyes were focused on a screen before him, frantically tapping away. The words and numbers on the screen were meaningless to Wade but the panic in the air wasn't.
"It would be fine by me, you know.", Peter then went on as if he didn't hear what Wade had said. "Not to say that I want to die. It's just... it wouldn't be the worst deathday ever. I'd prefer it today. I had some waffles, listened to music, saw the sun, the stars, pretty good last day."
Peter's mind was racing in circles, trying to process his horror. He couldn't accept this as fact even if it was staring right in his face. Gwen wasn't like this, she didn't break, she was stronger than him. But he couldn't deny it anymore. Wade was right, oh god, Wade was right. "Why-?", Peter gasped.
"But you don't want to be around me either." He didn't mean to sound so hurt. The last thing he wanted was for Peter to feel bad about taking care of himself. Peter didn't react, he didn't look hurt, his face just as blank as previously. Wade still had to clarify. "I'm not guilt tripping you. I want you to know that if that's the case than that's okay. Whatever you feel comfortable with."
Here's the thing, being with Wade was easy. Peter could spend hours stressing over the nature of their relationship, why he felt like Wade was keeping something from him, the endless dread that seemed to hang over him like a dark cloud. But once he was with Wade, he was fine, or as fine as Peter could manage to be. His worries were still there but they were muted.
He sat up and faced Tony, leaning in the doorway, safe distance, as always. It was a relief and made Peter sick at the same time. Try to make sense of that. "Yeah, what's up?", he asked, as casually as possible.
"I'm diving. Which is an acceptable pool activity. You're having some kind of break down, which is less acceptable.", she shrugged simply.
"Because she doesn't want to see you.", Natasha replied and this time it wasn't just sympathy. It was fucking pitty. Peter didn't care though, his insides just continued to shatter and crash.
"Yeah... waffles...", he mumbled, his voice raw from all the screaming. Still, he seemed close to going back into full on panic mode, gasping for air, his eyes wide and terrified. "Can- Can we go outside- Can I- I-please-", he then stuttered and Wade got up with a nod.
Gwen just stared ahead, her eyes distant. It was awful to see her like this, soul crushing. Gwen wasn't the one who broke. Peter was the weak one, not her. He didn't know what to do, how to help her, but he'd try none the less. It took her a long time to focus on the present again. At some point Peter just sat down at her feet, holding her hands in her lap, just waiting. Once she did, she let out a shuddering sigh and squeezed his hands. "I'm sorry- It's just...a lot. ", she stammered, her voice still cracking from all the crying.
he still had loving relationships, even if they were all a little dysfunctional. He knew the basic formula.
"So, am I going to meet your man on this trip? I wanna check out if he's actually as great as you make him seem, which is pretty unlikely.", MJ asked with a cheeky grin after a while. He had told her a lot about Wade in the past few weeks and vice versa but the two had never met before.
But now that Peter wasn't at HYDRA anymore this became a possibility. Falling in love. Going on dates. Being into each other. He just hadn't realized that yet.
"Don't know, ask me once I know if this is a load of bullshit.", he snapped and Wade couldn't help but to flinch ever so slightly at the aggression in his voice. Peter noticed and seemed to immediately regret it, softening a little for Wade' s sake.
"He can't.", Bucky commented, proving Wade's suspicion right. Peter had absolutely no control over himself right now. Bucky had warned them about that but to see it right before them was daunting. Peter's eyes were crazed, his movement frantic, he was laughing hysterically like the fucking Joker. Wade wasn't sure if he had ever seen Peter so unhinged.
Peter continued to get his bed ready as he replied:" She asked me if I want to go out for a movie and grab some dinner afterwards." Peter sounded so nonchalant about it, that Bucky figured that Peter didn't know the implications of that. He could be wrong but it sounded like MJ asked Peter out on a date and Bucky wasn't sure if he liked it.
"Oh, you mean these?", he asked and shot a small amount of his webs against the console of the car with a flick of his wrist.
"We need to get the tracker out as soon as possible and do a health check. I'll ask Bruce if we can do it in a regular room, he doesn't seem to react well to a medical setting. Maybe we should also get him a nutritionist to get his weight back up. He'll also need therapy, though I'm not sure if he'd agree to that. And maybe we shouldn't keep him here in New York, it's to obvious. We could go to your Malibu house for now until he's feeling better. Also, I know you might be hesitant to ask but we should really try to get a look at his file, it'll be easier to help him if we know what we're dealing with.", Steve knew that he was rambling and maybe he was even overstepping a line but he didn't know what else to do and they didn't call him the star spangled man with a plan for nothing.
Wade couldn't believe that this was really happening, he was scared that if he made a wrong move it would all shatter to pieces so they stayed like that, just looking at each other, Wade rubbing gentle circles over Peter's cheeks with his thumbs.
Slowly, very slowly Wade stepped closer and closer as he spoke until they were only inches apart and then, carefully, he reached up and cupped Peter's meager face in his hands. His skin was cold against Wade's but he didn't flinch or tense, he leaned into the touche, his eyes fluttering for a second. "I wish I could believe you...", Peter sighed before meeting Wade's eyes again.
"Look at you! Having an opinion! I'm so proud.", Wade grinned before he started to comb through Peter's hair. "Have you done this before?", Peter asked and Wade hummed slightly.
"Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.", Wade sighed but Peter's defenses were back up, not that they were ever really down.
Bucky took a glance at his phone before replying. "12 hours, give or take. " Peter almost choked on his own food.
This one turned out longer and fluffier than expected, my evil evil plans were moved back a little but they are still on the horizon.
"Yes, but I was also punishing you on purpose. And I think I don't want to do that anymore.", Peter confessed.
Peter had never seen Vanessa, only ever heard of her and Wade didn't talk much about her. All that Peter knew was that Wade loved her very much and that she got caught up in a cross fire that killed her. It was difficult to believe that she was dead when he saw her like this. She looked alive, vibrant, gorgeous.
Peter was doing so great, he was doing better than anyone could've imagined and Wade wouldn't ruin that.
"Peter made a friend!", Bucky exclaimed and Peter had to hide his face in his hands out of embarrassment.
A paternity test proved his worst fear to be true. Fatherhood. Tony had no concept of a good father, thinking of his own only caused year old resentment and grief to bubble up inside of him. A strange mix, confusing, too.
Wade was crying, he didn't notice until Peter reached up and wiped one of his tears away with his bloody thumb.
Or maybe he was testing the waters, see how far he could take it, where the limits were. But it manifested as him being an angsty ass.
"Where are you taking me?", he asked, his voice barely audible. He didn't sound agitated, though. Or scared. Just resigned. It was worrying.
Once was a dangerous word. They left at night, the others might not notice their absence until morning. Until then it would definitely be too late. He had to alert them somehow.
"Peter, are you oka-", his eyes fell on Peter's cowering form. It didn't matter that Wade had been nothing but nice to him, or that just a few hours ago he had revealed his own insecurities about his appearance to Peter.
"I'll believe it when I see it.", he said instead before turning on his heals and heading for the exit, Tony close behind him.
That question took him by surprise. Not enough to ease any of the tension that turned Peter into single ball of nerves, though. "Don't I?", he asked and the expression on Tony's face made everything seem nonsensical.
"Wait, you don't mind?", Wade asked genuinely confused. Peter didn't look at him when he replied, his eyes looking out the window, one hand pressed against it.
But when it came down to it, Bucky had made his decision before he even knew Peter's name, before Peter even said a single word to him. Bucky knew exactly what he'd do.
"Peter, you aren't weak.", Wade stated without hesitation and this time Peter was the one to freeze for a second.
After they bought the clothes they returned to the mansion. It was a quiet day after that. Quiet meaning that they didn't do a lot and that Gwen didn't say a lot. Lunch, movies, dinner, whatever they did, Gwen was absent, just sitting there, void.
"FRIDAY, scan the building, what are we working with?", Tony asked as the jet hovered above the abandoned factory premises. He had dressed up in his suit by now as well and they were preparing to land.
"Okay, I'll just wait here.", Bucky nodded. He was busy texting Tony his daily report and didn't pay much attention to the issue.
"But there are times you do it on purpose?", Wade asked carefully and Peter was chewing his lip, searching for the right words.
"... they're here.", He finished. It still seemed unbelievable to Tony, how they could've gone through all that and still come out on the other side. Tony wasn't a believer in any way, shape or form. He liked facts. But Peter's survival bordered on a miracle.
"You're making the afterlife quite appealing to someone who can hardly bear to be alive.", Peter replied but there was a tone in his voice, a trace of amusement that told Wade that Peter wasn't serious, not entirely at least. It was a relief more than anything.
. That's what Wade told himself. Peter was only this apathetic shell because he was on drugs and once he'd get them out of his system he'd go back to normal.
stared at the rivers of red dripping down his arm. He heard Gwen, the night she held him down to stop himself from clawing his veins open. She'd be disappointed. But Peter couldn't bear being like this anymore. It
"I said I'm not hungry.", Peter stated, not laying a hand on the menu. As if on cue his stomach growled once more and Bucky gave him an unconvinced look. Peter quickly glanced away, almost sheepish and Bucky let out a soft sigh.
"I'm just saying, sending Steve on that mission was a smart move but sooner or later Fury will demand to know why you're hiding."
Tony was drunk. He hadn't touched a drink in years but he was completely hammered. There wasn't much left to do when you're told that the son you just got back was dead. They didn't find a body, but Tony saw the blood and Wade had been pretty fucking convincing.
It took MJ a while to collect herself enough to actually answer his question. "It's basically people that get employed by the state to take care of kids who nobody else wants." Peter froze for a moment. For some reason he had never thought of something like that. Peter wasn't new to the idea of people being cruel and messed up. But for some reason he had never thought of someone not wanting their child. Maybe because Tony wanted him. As much as Peter was constantly afraid of scaring his father away, until now Tony had proven one thing for sure, that he wanted to take care of Peter. Until now some part of Peter had thought that Tony didn't really have a choice in that, that that's just what parents were like. Apparently not. Apparently Peter was lucky, for once.
That's why I'll mark parts where anything even mildly sexual happens between the two with this ** so that you can skip it if needed.
Bucky said his goodbyes and promised once more to keep the others posted about Peter. Then he joined him in the car and started the engine. Peter didn't say anything, didn't even look at him, leaning his head against his window instead, watching the people he was leaving behind.
"I know, that doesn't mean that he didn't love you. I know he didn't get to say it back, but he did. You can love more than one person at a time.", she replied and Peter couldn't believe how kind she was.
"He just needs time. He doesn't know us, doesn't trust us.", Steve told Tony on the first night, his voice soft, his hands gently stroking through Tony's hair.
"You don't have to justify yourself. I was glad that he had you, I was rooting for the two of you.", Vanessa chuckled and Peter relaxed a little. She had a calming presence, maybe that just came with death, but if it didn't Peter wondered how Wade went from her to the human incarnation of stress.
"No... I wouldn't even know where to get it.", she mumbled and he could see her do that thing that Peter also sometimes did. She put up a neutral face, shielded herself. Wade used to wonder if that was learned behaviour or if Peter was just like that.  Now he had his answer.
"Yeah, I'm not HYDRA, told you so. No tying up in here unless you ask me to.", he winked and that actually go Peter to open his eyes and frown at him.
Even though Peter looked like he just told Wade that he drowned baby's for fun, Wade's heart almost leapt out of his chest. At first he couldn't even comprehend the words.
"Am I hearing judgement in your tone? I'm sorry but I haven't had solid foods in... I don't know how long. Let me enjoy my goddamn bananas!", he exclaimed dramatically, faking his outrage.
No. Just imagining it already filled him with dread. But did he want to live in a world where Peter was dead? Definitely not.
"Sounds normal, seems fake.", he said, his voice muffled by the bits of sandwich he just stuffed in his mouth.
"Fine!", He groaned, grabbing Domino's hand that was still holding his phone and letting her pull him to his feet. Maybe killing some assholes would cheer him up.
The other male slowly rose from his spot on the ground, groaning in pain as he stretched and Peter realized that he could hear his bones cracking. But that was the only thing.
Steve only realized that it was supposed to be a joke when Wade smirked as well and replied:"Yeah, we don't want you getting any ideas and start to become a brat."
"So you kill the people I love to get me to visit you?", he asked his tone sharp and Death glanced up, taking a shaky breath.
What Steve would say next was risky, Peter could take it very, very wrong. "But can you really be realistic when your sense of reality is so warped by all the abuse you've endured in your life?" Steve was holding his breath, waiting for his reaction.
"That makes it worse, actually.", Peter replied bitterly, becaus it did. Gwen was in there, there was no doubt about it in Peter's mind. He couldn't bring her out, though. If he didn't come up with an escape plan of his own he'd either be made back into one of HYDRA's drones or he'd die. And Gwen? Gwen might wake up one day and realize the same thing Peter had when he snapped out of his conditioning, she'd realize that her best friend was gone, and she'd blame herself.
"You don't need to apologize.", Tony told him and Peter turned his head to look at Tony before patting the space beside him, offering Tony a seat. Once Tony sat down Peter returned his gaze to the horizon. He took a drag of his cigarette and released the smoke in silence. Tony wasn't a fan of Peter's smoking habits but of all the harmful things Peter could be doing to cope, this one was the least concerning, so he postponed that battle to another day.
"You did?", he asked surprised, looking from the painting to the girl. If he wasn't mistaken he spotted something that looked like a satisfied smile on her face but only for a second before her expression turned bored again.
"I would've rather died than to feel the mess you left me with. I would've killed myself. The only reason I'm still alive is because of my fucking healing factor. Not to say that I haven't tried! And I've been told to stop blaming myself so that's on you now! And if you think that after all this shit, I'd let you anywhere near my friend, you're fucking mistaken.", he spat and when Wade glanced over at Natasha he could see her mask crack ever so slightly, revealing something underneath, something like regret or guilt. Something like horror.
There were questions. Who could do something like this to a child? Why? What was their motivation? Their end goal? If it was to rip out Tony's heart and crush it into dust, they succeeded. It didn't matter, though.
His instincts set in and without even thinking about it he opened the door of the still moving vehicle and launched himself out of it. He landed a few feet away from the highway, on his feet, his whole body trembling but uninjured.
MJ stared at him for a moment longer before shaking herself out of her apparent stupor. "Wanna get out? Then I won't feel watched and you won't be in the water?", she suggested and Peter agreed with a grateful smile. That's how Peter found himself sitting at the edge of the pool again, MJ next to him, wrapped in towels with their legs hanging in the water. "What brought you here?",MJ asked, staring at her feet in the water.
Wade could ignore White and Yellow. But there was a third voice. It was the darkes most disgusting part of him, the one he liked to pretend wasn't there. Now it made itself known. Red.
Peter didn't mention their shift, at least not for a couple of days. Then he did. He was sitting on a stool in the kitchen, if you could call whatever he was doing sitting. One of his legs was tucked underneath him while he had pulled the other one to his chest, wrapping one arm around it and leaning his head on his knee. Like a fucking folding chair. Wade couldn't see how this was comfortable or practical in any way.
"I promise. You call the shots.", he nodded. "You need to talk to them, though. They can't keep on thinking that you're dead, okay?"
"We had a long night. Let's just say Peter stopped a robbery. ", he remarked before pulling away the bandaid to reveal the wound underneath. Flesh wounds healed pretty quickly, broken bones took longer and re-growing limbs took the longest. The wound looked pretty gnarly but Peter new that it would be barely there in 24 hours.
Wade backed off. He didn't start the topic again.  He really didn't want to upset Peter more. Apparently Peter didn't really want to drop it, though. He let out a sigh and turned around, meeting Wade's eyes for the first time in hours. His face was expressionless. "You couldn't have done anything. ", he said with a shrug and Wade wished that he could believe it.
"Fuck, if I was an evil asshole, what code would I use...", he mumbled under his breath as all of them failed.
He picked up the jacket Bucky got him and put that one on, too, plus those same second hand sneakers Wade got him.
Okayyyy, that's it! At least for part one. I think I'll post chapter two of this story in the next couple of days so you should subscribe to the  " Spiders, Death and Roadtrips ", series!
Natasha pulled a face, it might've been apologetic, Peter couldn't tell. Then she pulled out her phone and opened it, playing a video. "She asked me to show you this."
Peter was staring out the window when he mumbled:"Yeah, sure." The words were empty, disinterested, Wade's throat closed up before he could say anything else so he just left.
Wade stared at his phone for a moment. His boxes got right to work, spelling out each one of his worries in detail but Wade didn't care. He was seeing Peter again.
"Yeah, sure. I can see that.", Wade returned, looking at Peter's bloody arms and hands. Peter followed his line of sight and lifted his arms, looking at them like he only noticed his shredded skin now. If he did, he didn't seem fazed by it. Not a good sign.
Ahhh all your comments on my last chapter were amazing!!! Thank you very much and please tell me your thoughts in the comments! It's so motivating when I hear from you!
I waited so long for this chapter,  I have literally planned this months ago,  PLEASE TELL ME YOUR THOUGHTS!
The boy, whoever he was, looked awfully neglected, he looked like he was starving and like he was about as stable as a house of cards. His companion seemed fine, and quite chipper. Steve didn't trust him.
Tony raised his eyebrows in surprise but didn't move otherwise. Peter was glad that he didn't approach him, didn't get closer, if anyone did that right now he wasn't sure how he'd react.
Suddenly he thought back to his first night with Wade, to the motel and the yard where he laid down and looked up at the night sky for the first time.  He had laughed, truly laughed for the first time that night, with tears streaming down his face.
Peter thought about calling the cops and turning him in but he had foolishly displayed his powers and if he called the police he'd have to explain them, which would blow his anonymity. He had to solve this another way. Peter crouched down and grabbed a hold of the ski mask, pulling it off. The man underneath looked like he was somewhere in his thirties, his skin was grey and his cheeks hollow, eyes rimmed with dark circles. Peter pointed the gun at his face. He didn't need to check if he still had ammunition, the man's expression gave it away. It was terrified.
Before he knew what he was doing Peter was already making his way back. He found a bloodbath. At least a dozen dead HYDRA agents, wearing their typical black uniforms, either shot or decapitated, there was blood everywhere, cut off limbs, and in the centre of it, Wade.
"No, Peter-", Gwen immediately protested, turning towards Peter to reach for his face. Then Peter did something that he couldn't even explain to himself.
The aftermath of the withdrawal was emotionally exhausting, sure, but it made you physically tired, too. It surprised him that Peter had stayed awake for this long. Bucky barely got out of bed for a week after his withdrawal. Until... until Steve dragged him out of it and to the Grand Canyon. "It totally is.", Bucky replied only to find that Peter had already passed out.
"This is my pulse. I'm alive. Because you didn't break, not completely. You snapped out of it, you were stronger than them. ", He insisted.
"I- I can't accept this-", Wade whispered. He had no idea how long they had sat there, gathered around Peter's dead body. Wade's mind had sort of shut down and was only now booting back up again. It had to have been a while though, because Tony had stopped crying. He just sat there, staring at nothing.  Steve had wrapped his arms around him, trying to give some form of comfort, though Wade didn't think that that was an option right now.
"I don't care!", Tony spat in her face. Wade's eyes searched the room for Peter and found him in one corner, hunched over, eyes unseeing.
"Yeah, I'm good, I'm... it's pleasant...", he replied. "Tell me a story?", he then asked and Wade didn't need to hear that twice. He went straight into a story about one of his many outlandish missions.
ALSO, I have a Tumblr now. I mostly use it for art-stuff but I'm also planning some art for this fic that I'll post on there and if you wanna talk to me some more you're invited to do that there!
"I'm just checking in on you.", Wade replied, leaning in the doorway. Peter stared at him for a moment before getting back into bed.
Peter was just skin and bones, tall but incredibly thin, his skin was as white as paper and looked like it had never seen the sun and all his features were too sharp, they must've starved him.
Tony was right, this was huge, this was momentous. "Deal.", Tony said, desperate for something, anything, even if he couldn't name it. Peter nodded and Wade couldn't contain himself anymore.
Bucky decided to turn to Gwen and Peter. He knelt down in front of Peter, taking Peter's messed up hand into his. The pain was dull, very different than a shot wound. "Come on, we'll check on your wounds for now. Wade, can you get me the first aid kit?"
Wade was about to say something like:"Yeah. Like you." But then they heard a panicked call from the hallway.
Peter needed a few minutes and about a dozen reassurances that Wade wasn't a hallucination but eventually he calmed down and let Wade help him onto his feet.  The boy looked around the massacre like he was only noticing it now and Wade feared that he'd throw up again but surprisingly he only looked thoughtful, like he was trying to figure
Apparently Peter took Wade's joke seriously because he straightened up and let go of his legs, crossing them instead. The tension was still there but more subtle now. Wade could see it in the way Peter clenched and unclenched his fists around the fabric of his sweatpants. His voice was steadier when he spoke, looking at Steve and Tony this time.
Peter felt like he was trying to trick him, to get him to make a mistake. "You asked.", the reply was insufficient. He knew that he said the wrong thing by the way Tony pulled his eyebrows together into a frown.
"Don't act like it ain't true.", Deadpool, or Wade, smirked before carefully guiding Peter into the room. Not literally, but he made the first steps and Steve could see how Peter watched him and mirrored his behavior, first walking into the room, then taking a seat.
Rationally he knew that that was unlikely. But Wade wasn't a rational person, on the contrary. So his mind ran with this idea. It's not like he didn't expect it, either. He knew that Peter wouldn't need him anymore once he was with his family, knew that their time was limited, that Peter would grow tired of him eventually. This was probably it.
"Now move.", Gwen ordered before grabbing a hold of Peter's shoulder. He could've tried to fight her, they were pretty matched when it came to strenght, but he knew that Gwen wasn't bluffing. If she was really activated she wouldn't care about her own life. And HYDRA never cared about sacrificing their soldiers. So he let her lead him to the hangar that was connected to the mansion. He would have to get out of this another way, a way that didn't get either of them killed.
Peter was fuming, his heart was racing. He made his way to his bedroom, struggling to not slam every door on the way. He couldn't fucking believe it. Why would Wade even suggest something like this, after everything Gwen went through? Why would he-
As Bucky started to check them in, Peter zoned out. He knew the spiel by now. James and Peter Parker rented a room for an indefinite amount of days including meals because Peter's hunger was somewhat insatiable. They paid cash but nobody ever questioned that, nobody questioned their names or identities either. Only a dozen people knew of Peter and Bucky became instantly less recognizable when he wasn't wearing his super suit and when his arm was covered up. They'd get the keys and go to their room and only interact with anyone from the motel again the day they left. That had worked out fine so far, the only exception was that one night in Oregon when Peter's nightterrors turned especially vicious and Bucky couldn't get him to stop screaming. The poor hotel manager thought that someone was getting murdered.
"Nah I'm good, thanks for the concern, though. ", he replied before continuing to eat. The waiter nodded and hurried away. Peter didn't divert his eyes from his food but he could feel Deadpool staring at him.
. Peter's eyes trailed down to the thin silvery scar on his wrist. In a few hours it would be gone completely. Then there would be no physical evidence of Peter's worst moment. Well, maybe not
Peter would've probably charged at her, if Bucky hadn't grabbed a hold of the back of his jacket. Instead he settled on yelling at her as Bucky held him back.
"Yeah.", Peter admitted, not bothering to hide his own surprise at that. Bucky smiled and Peter pretended not to notice.
"Don't worry, it's not your fault.", he quickly said and Peter looked marginally calmer. Wade got up to get another wet towel and more bandages from the bathroom. When he returned Peter still sat at the same spot, his eyes tracking Wade carefully.
"FRIDAY says there is one more hallway behind this door and the enhanced person is behind that hallway.", Tony announced through the comms at some point.
Tony's eyes wandered around the room for a second, glistening, before they refocused on Wade. "He- he was distant, more so than before, ever since we left but we thought that he needed space, to get used to us but-", his voice broke off and he swallowed, lowering his gaze before squaring up his shoulders and continuing, like he braced himself for something. "He dropped a plate, it shattered, no big deal but-"
MJ was staring at him, a weird expression on her face that Peter couldn't read. "Yeah...", she mumbled but she sounded distant, like she was in thought. Suddenly her eyes lowered and landed on Peter's lips and before Peter knew what was happening she was leaning in.
"Once we step out I want you to join Tony at the front and move ahead, Bucky and I will give you guys rear cover.", Steve explained as he stirred the jet to the ground.
"Cut it out and drop the face. ", he snapped and Death was so nice to transform her appearance but not nice enough to stop torturing him.
"When are you leaving?",  Wade asked, his voice thin and shaky. Peter still felt like crying but for a different reason now.
Wade gave him a nod and pulled out his katanas. Outside the guards were dropping like flies and when they finally stepped onto the courtyard Tony had cleared the way to the entrance.
"Is it because of me?", Peter asked carefully when the door to the kitchen was slammed open. The Black Widow stood in it's frame, a stony look on her face and a familiar file in her hand. Wade's heart skipped a beat.
"I wasn't lying by the way.", he then said. "But I kinda get it." Wade raised his eyebrows in surprise which Peter noticed. He looked up at the sky again, away from Wade, as he fiddled with his hands. "I couldn't stand to look at myself. Back at the shop. I didn't try on the clothes because... I can barely look down at myself when I'm wearing clothes without wanting to throw up or sob or some shit like that. You said it yourself, I look like a fucking corpse. "
"Has a teacher ever asked you, if you had any questions and you didn't have any, not because you were already an expert in the subject but because you had no idea what you didn't know yet?", he asked Tony.
"Cryo. I don't remember much else. Then Wade found me. He saved me. Brought me here. What about you?"
It was always one of two extremes with him. Empty expressions, glassy eyes and a distant mind or violent flinches, weary glances and shaking hands.
Suddenly the other man came alive with rage, Steve actually had to hold Tony back when he suddenly screamed out:" SHUT UP! FOR ONCE! JUST SHUT UP!" After that he deflated like a balloon. Wade didn't take it personally but he also wasn't impressed by this emotional breakout.
I promise that we'll find out how our other boys are doing in the next one but I just wanted to focus on those two for a second.
Another loaded question, but now Bucky was the one who was unsure of what to to reply. "Nothing. Everything. You're done with HYDRA, with SHIELD. The rest of your life is next.", he finally said. Whatever came next was what Peter made it out to be.
But now he'd see her again and all of a sudden it seemed too much too soon but Peter couldn't say that, not when he had waited for this moment for so long. "When- when are we going?", He asked, his mouth had gone dry.
Wade wasn't sure why he was freaking out, Peter had been close to him in the past days, too. They had sat next to each other, close, even if they didn't touch. But Peter was showing no signs of stopping and Wade didn't know what this ment, so he froze, like all the time the last few days.
"He- he flipped, ran out the room I think.", Wade croaked out before getting to his feet and helping Tony up as well.
"It's okay... I'm just glad to see you out again. You look...better.", Tony said with the faintest smile pulling at his lips.
"Don't give it to him.", Peter suddenly said, taking a step forward before the gun was pointing back at him again. He was trying to calculate how many shots he could take before he broke down, it entirely depended on placement. If he was lucky he could take 3 or 4 but a headshot would take him out for good.
"You can't know that.", Wade said and he hated that he knew that it was true. Peter lowered his eyes, but only for a moment, then they met Wade's again, full of nervous excitement.
"Yeah, I'll try- in case I don't, though, I need you to tell him some stuff. ",Peter whispered, his eyes lost focus, his arm fell back to his side.
His hands were in the pockets of his sweatpants, so that the others wouldn't see him shake. He could feel the tender spot of his wrist where he had slashed his own skin hours ago. Peter hadn't lied to Bucky, he didn't want to die, not really. But sometimes he got so worked up that he forgot that. He wasn't sure what he was feeling now. The withdrawal had left him drained, empty. Not in the same way the drugs had. He didn't feel numb and indifferent. He felt
"Yes, but I'm in a different mindset. I- I feel like I'm back at HYDRA and that I- I did something wrong and that I need to get punished. And when I don't-"
"Peter's strong.", Steve said with so much god damn conviction that Bucky wanted to scream at him. Of course he was strong, he had to be, he'd be dead otherwise. He had survived HYDRA, he would survive SHIELD but how much would be left of him in the end? Bucky knew that SHIELD left him a little more broken than before. Would Peter be the same? Would he be worse? Would he ever trust them again? "You couldn't have stopped them.", Steve added and it hurt, it hurt that he was fucking right. They tried to stop them, they all fought for Peter but SHIELD came prepared. In the end Bucky was back on the ground, like he'd been so often in the last decades, powerless. He'd never forget Peter, held down by 5 agents, fighting tooth and nail, not even looking human, just raw animalistic instinct. His voice didn't sound like his when he was yelling between sobs:"YOU PROMISED! YOU PROMISED! I TRUSTED YOU!" Even when they injected him with the tranquilizers and his body started to go limp his eyes still glared at Bucky with so much agony and betrayal. "I trusted you...", he whispered before passing out.
So he picked up his phone and texted MJ that he was in. They had exchanged phone numbers a couple of days ago. He also told her about Bucky's conditions. That she saved Bucky's number in case anything went wrong, that she called him, if Peter seemed not okay, that they'd stay away from too many people. (That last one Peter was secretly pretty glad about) In the end they settled on not going to the regular cinema but to watch a movie in the car cinema a few miles away and getting food there. This way they'd be by themselves in MJ's car and not in a large room full of people.
There was blood, so much blood that Tony knew, whatever they did to his son, he couldn't have survived it. He stepped into Peter's bedroom and when he saw the massacre they left, his mind shut off.
"Is that really comfortable or do you just like to pretend that you're Batman, lurking from the shadows?", Wade asked, his tone upbeat.
"Don't worry, that won't be for long. You've returned home to your real family. I'm sure that it was nice playing house with your daddy but it's time to realize who you really are again.", Keipon told him before suddenly freezing.
Still, Wade couldn't stop his own mind from racing. He never had much control over that anyways. The current topic of discussion between him and his boxes was what Death said earlier.
"Outside, by the beach maybe. We're secluded enough to be safe and if I were you I'd be crawling up the walls from being holed up in here by now, literally in your case.", Tony replied with the slightest smirk on his lips.
"Take a picture, baby boy, it'll last longer.", Wade smirked, but there was a slight strain in his voice, like he was a little bit on edge. "Wait, no. I'm immortal. I'll probably last longer.", he then added.
"Who would've thought that you could still have the incredibly mundane experience of smoking your first cigarette and fucking hating it. Very coming-of-age of you.", Bucky chuckled and Peter pulled a face but took another drag. This time he didn't cough as much.
"Well, she did sort of return the favour on that one.", Tony shrugged and Peter couldn't help but to roll with his eyes.
"Peter are you with us?", Wade asked and Tony could hear a quiver in his voice. Peter's eyes moved, they met Wade's. Nothing more, nothing else changed, he just looked at him. "How are you holding up, baby-boy?", Wade asked and the desperation in his voice hurt. Peter didn't reply. He just let his eyes drift away, like the conversation didn't catch his interest.
They were nightmares, sure. They still felt realer than anything he experienced in the last few weeks. Reality felt like the fever dream.
"I'm not tied up ", he suddenly mumbled like it was some kind of realization and when Wade looked down he saw Peter's hands in his lap, rubbing around his wrists like they were sore.
Peter felt a twinge in his chest when he heard that. He was fucking up Tony's life, he was aware of that. It was still worse to hear it laid out like that. "Tony, I-", the woman he called Pepper started but Tony shook his head.
"Come on.", he sighed, getting up from his chair. Bucky wished that he hadn't seen the relief that washed over Peter's face for just a second when he got out of bed. Like getting to be outside was the greatest gift Peter could've received in that moment. Bucky climbed out the window first, pulling himself up onto the roof with a little effort. When Peter followed him he insisted on pulling Peter up by his hand even though Peter could've probably easily climbed up himself. Once they reached the roof Bucky placed both of them at a safe distance away from the edge and even though he didn't hold onto Peter he never let him further away than an arm's length. If Peter noticed, he didn't mention it. He just stood there, eyes closed, his head tilted back a little. He didn't smile, his expression didn't really change at all, except... it didn't look as tight, he seemed to relax even more out here. They stood like this, in silence, for a while. At some point Peter opened his eyes and watched the sun rise, painting the sky in shades of red and gold. Bucky watched Peter.
"I- I can't get the collar off- he can't heal- he-", Gwen whimpered. Wade only now spotted the metal collar around Peter's neck and his heart skipped a beat.
Once they landed in a large court yard Gwen got up and grabbed a hold of Peter's shoulder, yanking him up onto his feet. He knew that she probably didn't care but he also didn't want to give the other HYDRA agents the satisfaction of seeing him in pain.
Peter had tried to be better on his own. Wade, Bucky, Tony, Steve. They all thought that they could make him better. Before them it had been Gwen. She was too good. Peter wasn't. None of them could change him. Nobody could free him of this ugly venomous part of him, overriding all that he was. Or...Maybe there was nothing else. Maybe he was just this monster. He used to be good...no...not good...innocent. Good and innocent weren't the same. Peter wasn't sure if he had ever been good. But HYDRA took his innocence, they placed this darkness in him that chewed away more of his heart every year.
"Yeah, sure. ", Peter shrugged. He couldn't bring himself to fake enthusiasm right now. Wade didn't notice the dead look in Peter's eyes or maybe he just pretended that he didn't.
"Tell Keipon that we're on the move.", Gwen told one of the guards and they followed her order, announcing their arrival over the com.
"Peter... I promise you that I won't let anyone hurt you ever again...", Tony whispered, his voice breaking.
A part of Peter was glad that Wade was living his life, that he wasn't just waiting for Peter to return. It made Peter feel better about taking his time, about not rushing to get home. At the same time a small part of his brain tried to convince him that Wade was moving on, that he'd lost interest in Peter, that once Peter did decide that he was ready, Wade wouldn't want to be around him any longer. He tried to ignore that voice as well as possible but it was still there and annoyingly loud.
"Natasha!", Tony bit out, a warning in his tone, the nervousness was gone. Agitation had taken it's place.
At some point it didn't even sound like he was still talking to them. His yelling turned into rambling, he started to pace frantically, burying his hands in his hair and pulling at it. Then he suddenly came to a halt and glared at them again."SO STOP LYING TO ME!", he wailed, more and more tears running down his face. It was an awful sight, it felt a little like cradling Vanessa's dead body. With the difference that Peter was still alive. But he was unravelling in front of them, coming completely undone and there was nothing Wade could do to help. He couldn't hold Peter, he couldn't comfort him, all he could do was watch. Wade felt absolutely useless, because he was.
Next thing he knew he was throwing himself at the Black Widow. Or... no...he couldn't actually remember that. But it must've happened. Because somehow he found himself held back by Steve who had locked his arms behind him.
"My friend.", Peter explained. He didn't mean to say more, he really didn't. But somehow, he didn't mind talking about Gwen all that much. Maybe because he was talking to Wade and he knew that the other man would understand him. Or maybe talking about her made her feel more real, like a person, not just a fever dream Peter came up with due to soul crushing loneliness.
Instead he took the clothes Wade picked out for him. Now he wished that he had really looked at the clothes before agreeing to wear them.
Wade didn't know what to make of it. It's like Peter was waiting for something and Wade could imagine what it was. He knew how it felt to wait for all hell to break loose, to constantly watch over your shoulder.
Wade quickly put some of the trash into the kitchen so that the three of them could comfortably sit on the couch.
"Until then I'll just have to play the human shield. Hey, maybe if I do a good enough job Captain America will  carry me on his arm instead of his vibranium shield.", Wade smirked and the tension left Peter's face.
Peter knew what she ment, or at least he thought so. The emotions he felt right before his death were still there but the things that came before it, his fear of touch, of disobeying, of being punished, the things that had controlled him for so long were gone. Was that how normal people felt, just generally fine? Would all of his emotions fade like this? "I don't want to forget them though, don't want to forget Wade."
For a second Peter didn't see anything but blinding light. Then, he was standing in a living room. The room didn't look familiar but it also didn't look quite real. It was warm and inviting in an ethereal way, golden light was streaming in through the windows, giving everything a serene glow.
"No, I don't think you do.", Steve replied, equally as calm as her but there was something behind his tone, a nuance, a wiff of danger, like an oncoming storm.
Hesitation, then a nod. Bucky rushed out of the bedroom and into the kitchen where he made the first thing he could think of that wasn't all that time consuming. He still had chicken soup in his fridge that he reheated. Then he grabbed a bit of bread and a bottle of water, before carrying it all back into the bedroom.
"I don't know how to even do that.", he then let out a chuckle but it had a bitterness to it. Wade didn't know what to say to that. In certain things he knew exactly how Peter was feeling, in others he had no idea.
Peter looked at his own handwriting on the first page of the notebook. HYDRA had taught them how to write but he never did it much so his writing was so messy that it resembled chicken scratch. He glanced up and out the window. They had been driving for a few hours now and the sun stood high in the sky, beating down on them. He wondered if summer ever came to an end here. He wasn't sure what date it was but it had to be September already. It was still hot. Not extremely, but one would think that it was about time to cool down.
"Was?", Tony asked and Peter really didn't want to talk about this. Grief, disgust and anguish coiled around his throat, making it hard to breathe. His eyes started to water as he let them wander around the dark room, trying to anchor himself.
"It's not like I told you my intentions,  sorry 'bout that. I knew that Tony Stark's son has to be a perceptive one.", Wade smirked, opening the door and stepping outside. He was relieved when Peter did the same, even though his whole body was trembling, he managed to stay on his feet.
"So, your therapist agrees with me?", Steve asked, not even a bit intimidated by Tony's agitation. He actually sounded like he was teasing Tony. That's why he loved Steve. He didn't scare easily, he didn't take any of Tony's bullshit, he didn't back down.
"I'm sure that they have waffles in heaven.", Wade said softly. Peter chewed on his lip for a moment and there it was again, that bittersweet smile of his. So much more authentic, so much more heartbreaking. "It wouldn't be the real thing, though. It wouldn't be...", his voice trailed off and Wade raised his eyebrows in question.
Wade couldn't quite remember the flight to Malibu, he was too caught up in his own thoughts and worries. Stark didn't tell him specifically what had happened or why he was needed but right now it didn't really matter anyways. If Peter needed him he'd be there no matter what. He realized that it had to be real bad when he arrived at the mansion a couple of hours later. Tony Stark looked nothing at all like the suave guy he knew from the media. Right now he looked distraught and exhausted, his eyes were red and puffy and his hair stood up in all directions.
Tony shrugged. "Maybe, but you also have absolutely no right to hold her here without a good reason. This just looks like false imprisonment to me. In fact, you know so little about her that you probably can't even tell me her age. She might be underage which would mean that you're falsely imprisoning a traumatized minor. Congrats on that. So, we'll be taking her with us, if you like it or not. We'll handle this our way this time around."
"He's managing our emotions, or at least I think that he thinks he's doing that. He does whatever we say, never protests anything, ask for nothing, and have you noticed how he forces his emotions down whenever he almost freaks out. It's almost like he's constantly waiting for us to blow up into his face and he's trying to put it off for as long as possible. No scratch that. I'm pretty sure that that's exactly what he's doing."
"You look better. I almost didn't recognize you. You look like an actual person.", Gwen said and he could hear a shadow of amusement in her voice.
Again, silence, while Peter seemed to struggle with himself. "I'm scared.", he then admitted and Bucky's chest tightened.
The fact that HYDRA could do this type of shit now deeply terrified Peter, it shook him to his core. HYDRA now had the power to integrate perfect sleeper agents whereever they wanted. Once they broke their mind down enough, they could activate them without even needing direct access. "She's glorious. ", Keipon sighed, stepping around Gwen and stroking her face gently, tracing her jaw with the tips of his fingers.
"You okay?", Wade asked carefully. At first he thought that Peter started to sob but when he revealed his face again Wade saw that he was chuckling. His eyes were glistening and bloodshot and his laugh sounded a little hysterical.
"I'm taking a vacation, that you're interrupting.", Tony snapped and she smirked at that like he had just told on himself.
Something inside Peter's chest lit up and it was hot and strong without burning him and he didn't like it, didn't trust it, knew how dangerous it was and tried to extinguish it before it could get bigger.
"Something about this doesn't feel right...", Tony mumbled more to himself than anyone else but he was damn right. Something about this felt fishy.
"Not my intention.", Wade mumbled. Peter let out a non committal sound and shrugged once more before letting himself slide off the roof. Wade's heart skipped a beat and he was about to scream when he realized that Peter was just... standing...at the side of the building. God it looked weird when he did that.
Then the trembling stopped and Peter grew stiff under his hands. He lowered his eyes, bowed his head. "Make it quick, please...", he pressed through gritted teeth. Wade noticed how much Peter tried to keep his voice steady but his breath started to hitch like he was seconds away from crying.
So Bucky picked the boy up as carefully as possible. "Hey, kid. I'm gonna take care of you, okay?", he mumbled more to himself as he gently placed him in the back of his car.
Wade had never seen Peter like this before furious and chaotic but still focused somehow, still lucid. It was frightening in a way that Wade hadn't expected from Peter.
The boy was kneeling right next to him in a pool of blood. Wade wasn't sure if it was his own or that of the agents. It didn't matter though because the truly concerning part was Peter's state of mind.
Wade knew that Peter had an unhealthy relationship with death, god knows, Wade could relate. He also knew that Peter had tried to kill himself in the past, Peter had told him in the first few days of them meeting. And Peter had a tendency for self harm that they all knew of and had witnessed before. But Wade had never witnessed him trying to kill himself. He had never seen anyone attempt it but himself. When he held Peter on the bathroom as his blood bubbled from his wrist, he just heard Death's rattling laugh in his ear, mocking him. Wade wasn't sure if Peter felt better now. The mood swings were gone, he seemed more like he did before the withdrawal, cold, numb. Bucky said that that was to be expected. The Peter wasn't numb but
"She doesn't make friends easily.", Karen, MJ's foster mother once told Bucky, they were sitting at the motel bar while MJ and Peter sat several feet away, MJ was sketching Peter. "She has a tough time relating to others. Peter must be a very special kid."
Peter could feel the other customers staring at them, the waiter that took their order glared at both of them like they were fucking aliens.
"Then what are you afraid of?", Peter asked, an edge to his voice that was almost cheeky and Wade hated this, he hated the situation, he hated himself for being like this, he hated that he couldn't just reach out and close the distance between them. But he couldn't, not now, not ever.
The withdrawal set in two hours later and at first it was slow. The coldness slipped and made way for irritation. "What do you want?",Peter asked Wade once he returned from the bathroom. The blank expression was still there but his tone betrayed him, it wasn't quite as void as before.
"Peter. I- kidnapped you, I brought you back to Keipon. I could've killed you. If you hadn't pulled me out of it- if W- if Tony hadn't gotten the collar off- you'd be dead. And your blood would be on my hands.", She explained, her voice starting to crack. Peter knew all of this. He had been there, after all. He didn't see how any of that mattered, though.
"I skimmed over it, didn't read details, though. Your identity was far more interesting at the time.",Wade replied truthfully.
Keipon let out a surprised laugh and clapped his hands as if Peter had just told a great joke. "Peter! Could it be that you developed a spine? ", he asked before taking a step closer, regarding Peter with his cruel eyes. "Come on, say that again, this time with more feeling.", he added, his tone mocking.
, I'm sorry- I- no- ple-ease I- dese- deserve thi-this, I deserve-", finally he stopped scratching but only because his wailing got too uncontrollable. He wrapped his bloody arms around his head and curled in on himself, rocking slightly as sobs wrecked through his body. "I'm- please- make-
Peter shrugged with one shoulder and pulled a face. Bucky needed a second to realize that he was smirking, only with one corner of his mouth, but still. He had no idea that the boy was capable of that. "Didn't feel like talking. Too exhausting.", he then supplied which in turn was something Bucky could actually wrap his mind around. He'd get moods like this, were he wasn't verbal at all. Granted, he never stayed silent for several days, but he could imagine feeling drained like that. Especially when you weren't used to being social, or when being alive was already exhausting enough. He wasn't sure which one applied to Peter, maybe both.
"Old habits die hard, I guess.", Peter laughed nervously, diverting his eyes again. It was too much, everything was too much and right now he couldn't hide.
It wasn't good. Actually it was worse than he thought. Peter knew what people were supposed to look like, he didn't look like a person, he looked like a skeleton.
Wade couldn't sleep for long, he nodded off for a couple of hours but it was a restless sleep. He eventually gave up and just laid there staring at the ceiling. That is until he heard a quiet knock against his door. Wade got up to check who it was and was surprised to find Peter leaning in his doorway, still completely dressed and smelling of cigarette smoke and coffee.
"Yeah, but you also managed to recover somewhat. An overall 5 star rating.", Wade replied but he was lacking his regular chipper tone.
"Yeah, like romantically interested in each other. Are you and MJ-", he started and understanding flashed through Peter's face. The boy then promptly cut him off, releasing Bucky from his misery.
"Peter...?", she gasped horrified, finally getting off of him and instead crawling to his head, carefully lifting it onto her lap.
To say that the situation was tense would've been an understatement. None of them knew what to say and Peter definitely wasn't up for talking. They returned to the spot where they had parked their quinjet, Peter got on and strapped himself into one of the seats. Wade sat down next to him. Peter didn't make any indication that he was okay with it but he didn't seem bothered by it either.
Also,  thank you so much for all your comments! It's really overwhelming and I will definitely try to reply  to each one of them!
"I'll open the door and you'll remove her tracker, that's an order.", she clarified and just like that they did it.
There were a couple of rules that manifested themselves quite quickly. Kid kept to the bed unless he had to go to the bathroom. Bucky didn't help him up, he didn't change his bandages, Kid did that himself until he didn't need them anymore. Bucky didn't touch Kid at all. This was a no no. It didn't surprise Bucky. He hated people touching him, too. Especially strangers. He was getting better at it, but he rarely found any comfort in touch.
"Tell me on what grounds you're holding her here again?", Tony asked Natasha with raised eyebrows. He knew there weren't any and so did Natasha.
"Buck- Bucky I don't know what to do- I don't know how to make it okay- I don't-" Bucky never heard Steve like this before, obviously panicking and out of his mind. It made Bucky's heart seize with worry.
After a few days Kid was almost completely healed up and could walk around the apartment. Bucky was faced with a decision, he didn't really plan this far so now he had no idea what to do next. He had an escaped HYDRA- agent living at his place, how was he supposed to keep that secret? And how was he supposed to explain that to anyone? He spend hours trying to figure out what to do next. In the end he arrived at the conclusion that he should talk to Kid first. So he went back to the bedroom. Kid still spend most of his time in there. He only left it when Bucky told him to. Like it was a prison cell. Bucky didn't like thinking about it that way but he couldn't help it.
"Peter-", Tony whispered and took a step forward. That turned out to be a mistake. Peter flinched back violently, even though Tony was nowhere near him. He turned his back on them and cowered, wrapping his boney arms around his shivering form in a desperate attempt to comfort himself. "Get away from me...", he pleaded, completely miserable and ruined. They all distanced themselves but stayed in the room, not daring to leave Peter to his own devices right now.
He attempted another smile before turning away and making his way back to their room. The closer he got to the room the more the dread settled back in. Logically he knew that Bucky probably wouldn't be too hard on him, but Peter wasn't a very logical person. When he stepped into the room Bucky was sitting on his bed, scrolling through his phone, he had taken off his hoodie. Bucky rarely wore his arm on open display. Peter had seen it a couple of times but this was the first time he saw where the metal connected to his skin. The scarring was horrific, Peter tried to not let his eyes linger. "I'm sorry...", he mumbled and Bucky looked up.
"We made a deal, Peter.", Steve suddenly stated, taking control of the situation. Peter didn't look at him. Steve didn't let that stop him. "I know it's not what you wanted but there isn't anything we can do right now. The good news is that you'll only be stuck here for a few days and that we'll check in on you every day. After that we can go home and SHIELD will leave you alone."
Tony wasn't sure if he would've recognized his son if he met him on the street. Not only because of the age difference and not only because he was basically just skin and bones.
"You're a good dad...", Peter whispered and for the first time let himself lean against his father, let himself have that.
He lost time, no idea how much. Next thing he knew he was on the bed again, staring at the ceiling. His eyes burned but he didn't bother to close them, too much effort. The fire was gone, or it wasn't, but he didn't feel it as much anymore. It wasn't the same as being numb. It was like not feeling the pain of burned skin because all the nerves were destroyed. Peter wasn't sure if it was better or worse than the fire. He didn't feel better. His skin was crawling, like there was something underneath it. Peter wanted to claw his skin open, wanted to pull out whatever was rotting inside of him. He didn't have the energy.
"Good.", Tony nodded, giving his son an encouraging smile that Peter returned carefully. Suddenly he blushed and looked away, looking flustered.
Maybe, somewhere around the time Wade had started to believe that Peter was fragile, he'd lost some of his trust in Peter's ability to push through. Maybe Bucky was right. Maybe Wade needed to have more trust.
Tony didn't necessarilly expect Peter to open up, he was already surprised that Peter offered him to stay. That's why he had been a little surprised when Peter pulled off his glasses and started to speak again. "I just- I'm worried for Gwen. I don't trust Natasha, I can't,  not even if I wanted to.", he admitted and this time he didn't sound dangerous or angry, just frustrated.
Dom didn't seem to like this answer. She frowned at Wade and pursed her lips. "Do that to him? The only one that I see who is getting something done to him are you. If your Loverboy can't handle the truth maybe he doesn't deserve you. "
"-you do it yourself.", Wade finished his sentence and Peter nodded. "Okay...", Wade sighed out. "We'll work on that. But not right now." With that Wade got up and Peter mirrored his moves, getting up as well.
"I wouldn't be that quick to judge. The longer you stand here the more violent I feel." It startled Wade, not the words themselves but that Wade actually believed them.
Instead he smiled lazily:"Yeah, maybe." He let Wade tuck him in until he was a warm and soft burrito-person.
"Never got to tell him that, did you? Never got to kiss him?",she asked and it felt like mockery, each word cut like a knife. She was throwing these words in his face, things he hadn't even dared to admit to himself. Now it was too late. "It's really a shame, isn't it?", Death asked and started to lean in and Wade knew what was coming but that didn't mean that he could bear it.
A non-painful one! Or as non-painful as it gets. It's not super fluffy but no one has a mental breakdown in this. Plus, Peter and Bucky start to warm up again. PLUS PLUS, some Bucky feels.
Tony stood his ground, though, while Peter suddenly deflated. He backed down, stumbling a few feet away, shaking his head like he was trying to focus. All anger suddenly left his expression and all that remained was confusion. He looked lost and that was almost worse. "Or they do but they don't really care... You don't really care." After all the yelling his voice was suddenly so thin that Wade barely heard him. It quivered and Peter took a shaky breath before turning his back on them. But not in time to conceal the single tear that trailed down his cheek.
Bare with me as I try to get back into the swing of things but I promise I've got a lot of exciting stuff planned!
Sure enough, ten minutes later, the results were in, the testing process got pretty quick over the years to waste as little time as possible.
"I don't care what you ment. Piss off.", he snapped and Wade had the feeling that as much as that hurt, it would only get worse from here.
"And are you taking good care of him?", she then asked, narrowing her eyes at him. Tony's eyes glanced over at Peter, uncertain and Peter could truly see Tony's guilt. It was much clearer than ever before, or maybe Peter had just never been able to recognize it. Sure, logically he knew that Tony felt bad for what happened, but he had never truly believed it, until then.
"You're being an idiot. He literally told you that he loves you. ", MJ argued but Peter wasn't convinced.
Peter *praying*: I need someone to be my friend...maybe send me an angel. The nicest angel you have.
"Hey!", Wade exclaimed, reaching for his hands to loosen his grip and that turned out to be a bad move. Peter let go of the phone and grabbed Wade's hand, twisting it until his wrist snapped.
"Yeah, Death's a she.", Wade said with a soft smile before taking a deep breath. He didn't talk about her usually. "I- As you know I can't die.", he started and Peter nodded. "And, basically everytime I die I meet her. I've died... I don't know, hundreds of times, I don't keep track. After a while we got pretty close. Mainly because she took the appearance of my dead girlfriend and that was the closest I ever got to getting her back. It wasn't real though, and I stopped...killing myself for her when I realized that. She'd never admit it but... I think she's still pretty pissed that I dumped her. Whenever I do die these days she likes to mess around with me. It's fine, I can handle it usually but this time-", his voice broke off all of a sudden and his eyes met Peter's. The boy's brows were pulled together, his eyes filled with worry and compassion and suddenly Wade felt something brush against his neck and he needed a second to realize that it was Peter's hand, laid across Wade's chest, gently stroking his skin.
Not almost, not nearly, no. Peter had been dead and gone. Tony didn't come in last minute to save him but that's what Peter thought.
He didn't resent Steve for going off with Stark. Steve had built a life for himself in the future. Bucky had to do the same and he needed to do it by himself. He chose to leave the Avengers  compound, to move out and live alone. It was right that way, he was sure of it. Still, it was tough on him. Bucky hadn't been alone since... ever, really. It was something he had to get used to.
He only left Peter by himself for a few minutes to alert the others that his withdrawal had set in. When they returned to his bedroom the door was locked.
"I'm working on it, okay?", Peter said, covering up the anxious voices in his head with a chuckle. "I've gotta catch up on 19 years of opinions. It's a slow process."
"I don't know what a crackhead is.", Peter admitted and he expected her to smirk or tease him like she usually did, instead she just stared, and there was something so sad about her eyes. "What's that look?", he asked.
"Let me in there.", Peter demanded already stepping up to the door next to the window. The guard that was posted next to it didn't attempt to hold him back, apparently not believing that Peter could force his way in.
Before Peter could stop himself the words just spilled out of him. Those were truths that Peter had known of but he had never really confronted them like this before. He had never taken the time to really examine his feelings for Wade. He hadn't intended to grow so attached.
How Peter felt when he tried to destroy himself? That was nothing compared to that. It felt peaceful in comparison, like justice. A part of Peter's brain, his annoying Wade-voice told him that he shouldn't think like that. Not that Wade would ever tell Peter how to feel, he was good like that. But he'd tell Peter that what happened to Gwen wasn't his fault, that he didn't deserve to feel this way, that Peter's death wouldn't bring justice for Gwen. Sometimes Peter tried to believe him, sometimes it was just too much work.
"Yeah but that was 3 months ago. 3 months that I spend in cold-ass New York instead of Malibu. ", Peter pointed out. Tony and Steve asked if he was okay with staying in New York for now. Peter knew that it made their jobs as Avengers easier, this way they were much closer to the rest of the team, so Peter said yes. He didn't really mind the city as much as he used to, anyways, even though he still preferred Malibu. The main things that had bothered him were the cold weather and the many people but those didn't effect him much anymore.
"Now I'll have to draw you, you look like a sad indie boy right now.", MJ said, the amusement back in her voice, breaking the tension.
Peter was quiet, distant, the way he had been when Bucky had met him. When he hadn't even known his name yet. Just like back then Peter seemed hollow, as he stared at the highway before them. But now Bucky knew he wasn't. Peter was in there, trapped somewhere in the depths of his mind, which wasn't a safe place to be. Bucky didn't know how to pull him out of it, anymore. He knew that wherever Peter went, he wasn't welcome. "Do they have a backstory?", he suddenly asked, coming back to life. Just like that, dull eyes turned sharp, glancing at Bucky.
"Peter, you still with me?", Wade's voice pulled him out of his thoughts and focused his attention back on Wade's worried expression. Peter wanted to believe that Wade actually stayed because he liked him. Obviously he couldn't but Peter still liked to indulge in this fantasy. "Yeah, why?", he lied. Lying came easy to him, much easier than most things, it was almost second nature.
When he woke up he asked for Gwen. She was gone. In SHIELD custody. Needless to say , Peter was not amused. He was fucking pissed. He just couldn't fathom how they managed to make the same fucking mistake over and over again.
"Peter I need you to calm down, you're spiraling.", Wade's voice was calm and Peter noticed that Wade had pulled over to the side of the road again. None of that helped him, though.
"MJ! Let me explain!", Peter called out but she was already gone. So Peter forced himself to get to his feet and follow her.
"I know how that sounds but I had my reasons.", Wade stated, his voice clipped. Peter's confusion and resentment quickly melted away, making room for anxiety. He had crossed a line, he shouldn't have said that, he should just keep his mouth shut and hope that Wade wasn't too mad.
"He was called to an Avengers mission.", Tony replied and Peter nodded slowly because he wasn't sure what else to do. That's what the call must've been about.
"Peter, it's okay... nobody will hurt you.", Wade said carefully while approaching Peter like a wild animal, slowly, his hands raised before him.
"Gwen! Where are you going and where is Peter?", Tony demanded to know, his tone sharp and commanding and Peter could've cried out of relief. It worked.
"Wait here.", he hissed before rushing out of the kitchen, Steve close behind him. "What is she doing here? Did she say anything when you last saw her?", Tony asked as they hurried to the entrance of the mansion.
There was no doubt that Bucky's Peter was Tony's son, all of a sudden it was clear as day. It explained how the boy knew who Bucky was without remembering him. It explained why he didn't have a tracker. It didn't explain why he ran off, why Peter didn't tell Bucky who he was, why he was hiding. "Bucky?", Steve asked on the other line and Bucky realized that he hadn't said anything in a while.
"Then I'll see you around, ...?", she said, but the end of her sentence fizzled out into a question mark and Peter needed a second to realize that she was waiting for him to tell her his name.
"Love you, too. ", Peter said and he didn't know if he wanted Wade to notice how sad he sounded or not.
"Well, I can't be sure about what you do and don't know. ", MJ added with a teasing tone at which Peter let out a dry sarcastic laugh. MJ only chuckled at that but she quickly got somber again. "For real, though. You'll probably get cancer when you're 40."
Peter's eyes glanced over at his father and Steve. He was trying to gauge how things would be once they returned home. Tony and Steve seemed okay with taking in Gwen. For a moment he feared that he'd have to get her out of there on his own. When Tony actually jumped in and helped him out Peter couldn't believe it for a second. He felt like he sometimes didn't give his father as much credit as he might deserve. Sure, he made mistakes and Peter didn't forget those, but maybe it was time to try as well. He hadn't been trying to make things work for a while now.
"Get out of my fucking way, you bitches!", he screamed, impaling them on his katanas like they were shashlik, leaving a trail of bodies.
Deadpool didn't punish him though, he just let him eat his food in silence and he didn't say 'told you so', when Peter puked beside a car in the parking lot when they were outside again.
Two hours later Gwen was passed out and Peter's mind was going a hundred miles a minute. His body was exhausted but his head wouldn't shut off. He couldn't stop tossing and turning and eventually he just got up and made his way to the kitchen.
"I want to.", Peter said with a nod. He took a breath, collected himself. "You're important to me. And this isn't forever. I want you in my life. Just... right now it's too much, you are all too much. I can't be myself right now, I don't even know who that's supposed to be. I need to be someone else for a little to figure that out." Peter was calm, collected, but somehow not cold. His words seemed genuine and that sparked a tiny flame inside Wade, a bit of hope. He hadn't even realized that he had lost it for a while.
"The other thing we wanted to talk about is the HYDRA file.", Tony then announced and Peter stopped what he was doing to glance at both of them.
He was important to all of them, but he was Tony's son and Wade's... Bucky wasn't sure if Wade or Peter even knew what they were to each other. Once the blood was gone, Bucky and Steve returned to Peter's bedroom. It was still dark but the sun would rise soon. Peter's body looked incredibly small in the middle of his huge bed. Sometimes Bucky forgot that Peter was 19, practically an adult, he looked like a child. Bucky saw the boy he met at HYDRA, even smaller than he was now, colder, more empty. Tony and Wade sat at each side of the bed, both silenced by their pain. Bucky had wrapped Peter's wrist in a bandaid to stop him from bleeding everywhere but by now the bleeding had stopped. He'd wake up soon.
front of it. Only once he stepped closer, could he make out how strange the pair looked. One was dressed in a superhero outfit, black and red, with white eyes and katanas strapped to his back and the other reminded Steve hauntingly of concentration camp victims, back from when he was still fighting Nazis in the second world war.
"It's very bad for your health.", Bucky explained after releasing another cloud of smoke. It was difficult to take that warning serious when Bucky was currently smoking. Also, Peter didn't care much for his health anyways.
Death had two rules. Rule one was not mentioning Peter or Vanessa. She was a jealous beast and liked to pretend that Wade chose to be with her.
"I am, though. The collar is not coming off, not in time.", Peter stated, it was matter of fact, like he knew what would happen, like he had made his peace with it.
"Depends on how you'd land.", Wade said, looking down at the ground. They were 3 stories high." A head dive could work."
In the beginning it was a lot, the memories ambushed him whenever, rolling over him like an avalanche. After a while they got spaced out, sporadic. There were still blank spaces and maybe he'd never get everything back, but Bucky didn't necessarily want everything back, anyways. The majority was bad.
Whenever something truly devastating happened, it didn't take long for Tony to drown his sorrows in a bottle. He always got back on track eventually.
"Is this okay?", she whispered and surprisingly Peter didn't mind the weight of her head on his shoulder.
Wade had brought it up to Tony and Steve but without consulting with Peter on the topic (which never went well) neither of them knew what to make of that.
"Anything else?", Wade asked and to his own annoyance Tony knew exactly what the other man ment. They just couldn't afford to talk about it out loud because Peter might hear them.
It was all very predictable. He had taken that same stance with James years ago, she knew he'd do the same for Tony's son. Still, it tugged at Natasha's heart uncomfortably. It had taken her years to get to that point, but she considered Steve a friend, Tony, too. She wished that she could just shut her brain off and see Peter as a simple kid. Unfortunately she couldn't and unfortunately he wasn't.
"I don't like people watching me. I feel exposed.", MJ replied after a beat of silence and Peter immediately started to get up.
Wade reached for it with a shaking hand and wiped it from his cheek before looking at his fingers. It was blood.
The only other thing he was willing to tell them was that there was probably a tracker on Peter. The boys sleep turned out to be a blessing because this seemed to be a more pressing matter than talking to him.
Roughly a week had passed since he had last seen Gwen. Since she kidnapped him and almost killed him. Peter must've passed out sometime after her torture. The last thing he remembered was thinking that he was going to die and then Wade's face. And then, nothing.
. Fitting word. Everything is always so goddamn complicated.", Peter mumbled, his eyes focused on his hands in his lap, he was fiddling with his phone and it reminded him of Wade.
"This does look like something Wade would like.", Bucky smiled but it wasn't teasing, there was a weird facet to his smile that Peter couldn't place. " It looks good.", he added, not sounding convincing at all.
"Tomorrow. I have some things to take care of first. You should watch him in the meantime. But don't crowd him, maybe just one person at a time. I wouldn't expect any emotional responses out of him. The withdrawal leaves you...drained. He might not even talk. But don't leave him alone, okay?", Bucky instructed and Peter didn't even mind that they were talking about him like he was a spooked animal. Maybe he was.
She took a deep breath, picked herself up and turned her back on them. "Will you keep this confidential?", Steve asked.
"You'll need a lot of sleep. I know I did. I didn't get out of bed for days so you're already doing better than me. ", Bucky remarked with a smirk before pulling something else out of his backpack. A pack of cigarettes. He took out one, placing it between his lips before lighting it and taking a drag.
"What's going on here? What are you doing here?", MJ suddenly asked. Peter raised his head up to look at her. Her expression was still alarmed, fucking terrified but the tone of her voice demanded answers.
Peter was silent for a while, minutes passed by and he didn't react at all. "Hello? Earth to Spider-Boy? You still with me?", Wade asked after a while.
"Okay, then let me be so nice to explain it. After your people pumped me full of drugs and picked my brain apart for days on end you just send me home because, 'hey, we solved the problem, let them deal with the aftermath'. But tell me, did you ever wonder what it feels like to recover from the shit you put me through?"
"I don't know.", Peter replied honestly. "I don't know what I'm thinking. I just- I wish I could jump ahead. I wish- I wish I didn't have to be me for once." It was dangerous, to open up like that, especially since he hadn't done that before with Tony. He felt exposed, bare and cut open and Tony could feist upon his insides like a vulture.
"Holy fuck! Look at the stars!", he gasped out and started to chuckle until he was full on laughing. It wasn't bitter or hollow, a true, joyful laugh, even though Wade could see tears pouring out of his eyes running down the sides of his meager face. "Do they always look like this? It's even better than I imagined!"
Bucky had seen a lot of things, a lot of images that would keep him up at night and haunt him forever. Seeing Peter laying on the bathroom floor in a pool of his own blood would be one of these terrible sights he'd never get rid of. Wade was shaking violently and cursing while panicked sobs wrecked his body. Bucky's mind shifted into that weird headspace. It turned analytical, detached. He had a job to do, his emotions couldn't interfere with that. He observed the situation in mere seconds. There was a pair of blood stained scissors laying a few feet away. Wade was pressing a towel to Peter's arm, it was getting soaked in blood. Peter was passed out. Bucky knelt down next to Wade and Peter. He checked Peter's pulse. It was racing but steady.
It was interesting to watch their banter, not only because Peter seemed really comfortable with it. Apparently they had really bonded over the small amount of time they spend together. Steve realized in that moment that they'd probably need Wade for Peter's recovery, too. Speaking of his recovery... "Peter, we've been thinking... No, mostly Steve's been thinking, I've been staring holes into the walls... but there are a few things we need to talk about.", Tony started and Steve noticed how Peter tensed up ever so slightly but otherwise continued as normal.
Meager, haggard. His pale skin was as white and thin as paper and had an almost green tinge under the lights of the bathroom. His face was made of sharp edges and dark shadows, hollow eyes that stared back at him. He still had a little blood on his chin from where he bit his lips open. A skaky breath escaped his lips that sounded more like a whimper when he pressed his eyes shut.
In the end the water was lukewarm and Peter wasn't sure how long he spend in there. "Okay, I think I'll get out now.", he said before his eyes fell on a red towel that was hanging from the radiator close by. "Can I use that towel?", he asked.
How the fuck was Peter supposed to tell if he had a romantic interest in MJ, or anyone for that matter? Peter wasn't dumb, he was aware that people fell in love and that romance and sex were a thing. He just...never thought about it in connection to himself? Back at HYDRA it was all about survival. He had only loved one person, Gwen, and their love for each other was rooted in a deep seeded codependance. It wasn't about romance because romance didn't exist for them.
"Wade, back so soon?", she asked with Vanessa's familiar voice, familiar smile, familiar sparkle in her eyes and
"Yeah, but I didn't think that you are serious.", he admitted, still holding on to the car and Wade had the suspicion that it was the only thing keeping him upright.
"Yeah, I didn't get much sleep last night, sorry. ",Wade yawned, stretching a bit and it would've been quite cute if he didn't say that every day.
"Just be honest with me, tell me what we're working with.", she said and Peter was ashamed at how relieved he was that she still considered them a team. It had always been the two of them against the world.
He still worried about Peter but now his involvement in his life was limited to daily text updates from Bucky and the occasional picture.
Wade 'woke up' at the doors to the afterlife, he didn't really recognize the place as much as the feeling. The afterlife looked different each time, Wade always looked and felt the same.
"You must be a pretty shit spy. I found like thousands of pictures of you when I googled your name." Peter was casually strolling into the foyer, Wade close behind him.
Another knock, Wade's voice but Peter couldn't hear. The door opened, he didn't notice. Not until the scissorswere slapped out of his hand. Too late. Peter couldn't even do this right.
"No. It was more of a one time occurrence, and after that I'm not too keen on trying them again. ", Peter replied, and looked up, his eyes meeting MJ's. She seemed relieved, somehow.
Bucky stepped closer and placed a careful hand on Tony's shoulder. "You should clean yourself.", he said calmly, looking at Tony's hands that were still covered in dry blood. Wade didn't look much better. Tony stared at his hands, as if he only noticed the blood now. "I've got this covered.", Bucky promised and when Tony gave his son another glance, Bucky knew that Tony would agree to it. He'd do anything to make things right with Peter.
The next day turned out pretty anti-climactic. There was no big emotional reunion but it didn't turn into a dramatic disaster either. Wade and the others waited in the foyer of the headquarters, all equally anxious to see how Peter was doing. He was lead out by agent Lorenz. They had let him change into a pair of black pants and a black hoodie, the collar was gone, he looked almost normal that way. He trailed after the agent, hands burried in the pockets of his pants, the same uninterested expression on his face as the last time.
Peter didn't pull away, didn't divert his eyes, didn't cower. "I'll miss you, too." It made Wade's heart ache and swell at the same time.
Peter didn't reply anything to that. He continued to pack, mostly large hoodies and simple pants, all in dark colours, he avoided the colourful ones. Wade felt like making an emo-joke but he didn't think that Peter would appreciate it. "Peter,  I'm sorry.", Wade started. The guilt of it all had been eating him alive for days now. He finally couldn't hold it back anymore. But when the apology left his mouth Peter went rigid.
"If you say so." Another beat of silence before Peter added. "Can you keep this to yourself? Please?" Wade could hear how hard Peter tried to control his tone, to keep it calm, it was almost convincing.
That got an instant reaction. The boy flinched and sat up before letting out a pained gasp. He wrapped his arm around his torso as his whole body shook with panic.
"But, we aren't holding Gwen here against her will. ",She repeated the same thing Tony had said and Peter couldn't believe it, not yet.
"Those are really toxic, by the way.", MJ remarked and Peter couldn't help but to roll with his eyes.
A beat of silence. Wade wanted to look away, to hide, there was something incredibly unsettling about Peter's empty stare. Wade didn't cower though. "It's more complicated than that.", Peter sighed, one of the only indications of Peter's emotions. It sounded frustrated. Peter looked away, out of the window and he stayed silent for a while. His eyebrows furrowed slightly. It seemed like he wanted to say something but struggled with the words. Then, finally:"You're important to me, Wade." He sounded pained. Like this admission was too much and Wade couldn't take it. Not like this.
"Sounds like a plan. Did you have the boyfriends talk, yet?", MJ asked, glancing from her canvas at Peter. He had told her that Wade and him hadn't really talked about what they were yet and he had promised to bring it up but so far he hadn't.
"Pretty good, now that you're here.", Peter replied with a careful smile. Gwen didn't return it, her eyes wandered off, taking in the room. She looked distracted or like she wasn't entirely there. It worried Peter but then again, he was like that sometimes, too. All this had to be a lot for her.
"The scratching. Are you aware of that while you do it?" This caused Peter to actually pull back the arm and sigh, burrying his face in his hands.
c) Call the Avengers Compound and treat him there. Not ideal either, bringing a possible HYDRA agent in was a huge security risk. If they even took him in. Bucky had worked hard to not be viewed as the enemy anymore. Most had accepted him as one of their own by now but he couldn't be sure that they'd trust this boy on his shaky endorsement alone.
"You know, I got you.", the woman said before pausing for a second. "Tony, how are you dealing with all of this?"
"It isn't really the water, more the fear of someone drowning me... But I didn't want to make you uncomfortable by watching you swim. ", he mumbled, lowering his hands. To his surprise MJ didn't look as horrified anymore. There was actually the faintest trace of a smile on her lips.
"How's she doing?", Tony asked. Natasha and him had removed themselves from Peter's and Gwen's reunion, going to the kitchen to give the two some space. Natasha had made them both a coffee.
"Unfortunately, no. I've just been drowning in work and I'm sorry that I missed your function. It won't happen again.", Tony apologized genuinely.
He also noticed that Peter, while obviously messed up, still had a sense of wonder for the world. Maybe it was only temporary, Wade hoped not, but even right now as they were talking Peter didn't stop looking out the window, taking in everything around them.
"Those are just words. Just because you say something doesn't promise that you mean it.", Peter shrugged. The dread was back. It had never left.
Peter let out a groan, the kind of sound signaling defeat, telling the universe that he was done. He buried his face in his hands. "No...", he said, his voice muffled by them. "I actually can't even imagine going anywhere near a lab without spiraling out of control. It's... it's fucked. "
"Can't you just leave me alone?! Please!", he begged and then he started to sob. He tried to repress the sound, he pressed a hand to his mouth to muffle it but it didn't help. It just made it so much worse.
"Yeah, why didn't you wake me up?", Wade asked, before getting up from the armchair he slept in. His bones cracked when he stretched.
After a few more seconds he sat down in one of the armchairs and shortly after, sleep claimed him as well.
"I thought road trips were our thing.", Wade said. He tried to go for humor but it didn't quite land.
Peter didn't look at him again, he only took a heavy breath, eyes still glued to the night sky. "We'll see about that...", he then said more to himself than Tony. "Can I see Wade now?", he asked a little louder.
for a second, trying to come up with the right words. "It's so loud and hectic. It's a lot. This is less...exhausting." Peter glanced over at his father to find a fond expression on his face, a relief.
"I'm many things but I'm not naive. Why? Because I want to give my son some space? Treat him with some decency? How does that make me naive?!", he snapped, all worked up instantly.
Is it below my pride to use Deadpool's ability to break the 4th wall to explain my own shortcomings? No. Will I do it again? Maybe.
Peter didn't make a single sound the entire flight back to Malibu and once they arrived, he took off into his room straight away. The rest of them stood frozen in the hallway, watching him leave until they heard the door slam behind him. "How long until the drugs wear off?", Tony asked into the silence.
"What did you?!", Gwen snapped at him before grabbing at his hand and pulling it away. She was furious, another trait she wasn't supposed to have.
"I'm good- I love you...I promise...", Peter smiled at Wade, a weak hand grabbing a hold of Wade's, squeezing it slightly and it finally made click. Peter loved him, Peter loved Wade and now he'd leave him.
"I'm immortal. I'm friends with death. I'll pay her a visit and ask if she came across a little spider-boy.", he explained, his voice slow and patient, like he was talking to children. The children stared at him like he was insane. Granted, he was, but not about this. Neither of them made a move to kill him. "Fuck this, then I'll do it myself.", he sighed before pulling out a gun and sending a bullet through his brain.
Natasha smiled and Tony knew that she was genuine. "Definitely. She's amazing. They both are. The things these kids went through... I thought the Red Room had messed me up but HYDRA is a completely different beast. And somehow...", Her voice trailed off but Tony knew what she was talking about.
"Can I ask you a question?", Wade asked at some point. They've been driving for a few hours now. The only stop they made was to buy food. Rusk, bananas, chicken soup, stuff that Peter's stomach could actually take. He noticed the difference within hours, felt himself getting stronger, felt how his healing factor got powered up.
The other male took a step back, just staring at Wade. "Why are you ruining this for me?", he then asked and he sounded fucking heartbroken.
"I don't know if I can be better." His confession was quiet and shameful, like he had somehow failed, like he was the disappointment.
They had just returned to their room and were getting ready to attempt to sleep. Bucky froze for a second, glancing at Peter. "What?"
"Yeah, but only because you're sick. You'll get better in time and judging by the looks of your dad, you'll be pretty hot, too. Tony Stark is a total DILF", Wade explained and to his delight Peter smirked at that.
"Oh please, compared to what I did to her I was barely hurt. ", he mumbled, crossing his arms over his chest and continuing to stare out the window. He knew that his behaviour was unreasonable. After all, Gwen would probably not meet with him if she hated him but being reasonable wasn't exactly one of Peter's strengths.
Bucky stared at Peter for a long moment before letting out an even longer sigh. "God, I'm such a bad influence.", he groaned before handing the cigarette off to Peter. He put it between his lips and took a deep breath like Bucky had done. His lungs filled with thick bitter smoke, making everything feel too tight and claustrophobic. Before he knew he was doubled over, having a coughing fit while Bucky laughed at him.
"Exactly! Would you want some stranger reading about all the horrors you went through? After everything that happened to him? You are a lot of things, Natasha. I never thought of you as cruel."
"They won't be quick enough. ", Gwen said, looking to the door as well. Peter wanted to believe that he heard her voice waver, just a tiny bit.
"Yeah...", Tony sighed, unwinding his crossed arms and leading Wade down the hallway. "He's in his room but watch out, he doesn't react well to touch or... anything. ", he sounded so defeated when he said that and a few seconds later Wade could see why.
Tony didn't say anything else at first, didn't know what to say. Peter stayed silent too and for a moment Tony thought that he had fallen back asleep. "So, are you my dad?",he then asked raising his head slightly to look at Tony again. "I kinda passed out before the results came in."
Peter was addictive and Wade knew that he'd be his ruin, but he'd been ruined before, it was worth it.
"Gwen...please- hear me out-", he pleaded, his voice faint, breathless. He managed to roll onto his back. This way he could see the hatred in Gwen's eyes. This didn't seem right.
What was even more disturbing was when he tried to hold the screams back. His chest would start to heave, he'd bite his lips until they burst open and red dripped down his chin. It never lasted long, a new wave of terror would roll over him and the screams would start again.
He could imagine what they'd find in that file. And the thought that Peter grew up like this and that there was no way for them to tell how much
Gwen looked at Peter and he made a point to take a big bite off his sandwich. She then did the same, daring to eat more.
"Hey, it's okay, it's not your fault.", he told her, over and over again until her breathing calmed down.
Bucky chuckled slightly at that, but it didn't feel exactly real, more like stalling until he came up with the answer. "Ahh. I think Steve is actually more suited to answer that. The... culture shock was much bigger for him I think. At least from what he told me. I was busy struggling with myself, how much the world had changed was the least of my problems.", he finally admitted. Peter thought about it for a moment and it made somewhat sense.
Peter talked to Natasha once a week and she'd update him on Gwen's state. He had to admit that Natasha seemed sincere in her attempts to help Gwen. Apparently she wasn't an emotionless psychopath. That didn't mean that he trusted her and as long as Gwen refused to speak to him personally he couldn't be sure that she wasn't just telling him bullshit.
Gwen didn't pull a face, her expression remained perfectly composed. "The Winter Soldier has a lot of them in his room and sneaking around is much easier when you can hear exactly where everyone is in the house.", she replied and Peter really hated how cold she seemed, it rubbed him the wrong way, but that wasn't important right now.
We're now entering the endgame! The last part of the story! I am so fucking excited and I hope you are, too. I don't know exactly how many chapers are left, probably 5-8 but then we're done. ( Except I'm planning a sequel, lol)
"I love you, too, Peter. You know that,  right? You know that nothing is as important as you. ", Tony told him. Peter's eyes became glassy and he started to blink rapidly before quickly looking away.
He was unstoppable, he was a sword that cut through the mass of HYDRA agents without mercy until he found himself in front of the door that would lead him to Peter. He turned around and saw that the others were nowhere near him. Bucky was in a choke hold and his arm seemed to be a dead weight, Steve was buried underneath so many agents that Wade could barely see him and Tony was fighting off 5 by himself.
"Sorry, but that sounds like a load of bullshit.", Peter replied which startled Tony into another laugh.
"No. He's not- he's- he's just hurting.", Wade tried to explain and to his surprise Steve only nodded slowly before glancing over at his lover.
"They programmed him, Tony! Just like James! Codewords and all. He's a weapon!", The widow shot back and Wade had trouble holding back his own fury. Something in him came alive.
He didn't really do much in these passed two days except for eating and sleeping. His body was still recovering. At least that's what everybody said.
Someone said his name and Peter wanted to be gone. He wasn't allowed to leave. He had to stay to get better. SHIELD would make him better and maybe he could live then. Maybe he could stop being toxic.
"Pretty good, all things considered, I think. Bucky says I'm making progress. I eat, I sleep, sometimes, I take showers which is still hard. I also made a friend."
"It's not sabotage. I'm protecting myself.", there was definitely an edge to his voice but Wade also noticed the nervousness, the tension in his shoulders. He was careful to not startle the boy when he positioned himself next to him.
Then Wade caught himself. "That wasn't really you though, was it?", he asked. He couldn't imagine that the real Peter was capable of that and surely enough he shook his head slightly.
For a second Steve couldn't pinpoint who the boy reminded him of, then it hit him. Fake-Peter reminded him of Bucky, when he first saw him again as the Winter Soldier. Something dark and animalistic resided in those eyes but there was also panic, horror, confusion. The thought sent shivers down Steve's spine.
MJ handled Peter's family pretty well, she was more put off by Tony's excessive displays of wealth than the fact that they were Avengers and after a house tour and after MJ got all of her anti-capitalism comments out, she had settled in.
Also I hope that you're all doing well in these troubling times and that you enjoyed this little bit of escapism. I know things are very scary right now and I for one really rely on entertainment to shut my worries off for a bit. Leave your thoughts in the comments!
Wade gave him a worried look but dropped the topic. "Yeah, sure." With that they fell back into silence. It seemed to be a bit of a routine with them. They'd find a topic, talk about it until it got to a point where Peter felt his own issues crashing down on him, then they would become quiet. It was stressful, and exhausting but Peter didn't know what else to do, he didn't know how to be normal, how to have small talk and be okay.
"You ain't the one that needs to apologize-", Wade stated but Peter cut him off, something that was surprising enough on it's own.
Peter didn't take it too bad, though. He was still grinning. "Yes, look at me! I'm so lucky!", he exclaimed before looking at Wade again. Wade thought that that would be everything he'd say on the topic but no. It took him a few minutes of silence but Peter got a little more serious before confessing what his issue was. "I saw the pictures, okay? I believe you. Doesn't mean that I can accept it. My whole worldview just got blown to pieces, man. Did someone ever tell you that your whole life is a lie? It fucking sucks. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was a shit life. But I believed in it. I- I don't know- I'm probably not making any sense..."
"Peter! God, you scared the shit out of me... I woke up and you were gone- I thought- I thought you- Peter you can't just take off. Not after-", he stammered, his eyes wide and panicked. Peter immediately got up and stepped towards Bucky. For a moment he thought that Bucky would close the distance between them and grab a hold of Peter. Luckily he didn't. His night was already so fucking fragile, he had no idea, if he could handle anyone touching him right now.
Maybe Gwen could tell that Peter was freaking out but her consolation didn't really help: "Hey, it's okay, I nearly killed you. I'm not gonna judge you for being a bit skittish around me."
"You're Bucky Barnes.", she stated. Bucky's arm was truly the most recognisable part of him when he wasn't in his Winter Soldier getup.
Tony kept Fury on the phone for an entire hour, just arguing back and forth, bargaining for Peter's life. By the end of it Wade could barely even hear them. They just faded into the static inside Wade's head.
It took a few seconds to set in, but his own reflection was making him sick. At the same time he couldn't look away. He just stared at his reflection, not recognizing whoever was staring back at him.
stopped. He knew that this wasn't enough, that this wouldn't kill him, that he should continue. He sank to the floor. His hands were shaking.
Gwen was silent, just sitting beside Peter staring at nothing. When Peter asked her, if she was alright, a stupid question really, neither of them were anywhere near alright in the grand scheme of things, she just nodded before adding. "I'm just taking it all in."
"Then what's the issue?", MJ asked, her tone challenging, a small grin pulling at her lips. "I'd feel less exposed, if you were swimming with me.", she then added.
"Fuck, what did she do to you...", Wade whispered horrified, taking Peter's head into his lap. He was trying to catalogue the damage but it was just too much blood, too much...
He went numb, everything faded away and the next time he woke up he was in his cell. agent Lorenz called it his room. agent Lorenz called herself his go-to-person. Peter hated her. She said all that with a smile and Peter hated her even more because of it. It was a cell. She was his handler. He knew how these things worked.
"You're trespassing.", he mumbled, still silently praying that she'd just leave him alone to bathe in his misery.
Thing is, Wade wasn't.  He knew that this would happen, he knew exactly how this would end but he'd still fucking do it all. He'd stick around and watch Peter become happy with someone else because Peter deserved it, even if Wade couldn't be the one to make him happy.
"Don't worry 'bout me, Petey-Pie. I'll be a-okay. You go do your thing, get better, maybe become a surfer-boy in Cali. You'd look cute with a beaded necklace!", Wade could tell that he was rambling but like most of the time, it was better than the alternative. Saying what he really thought. Nobody cared about that anyways.
"Peter, it's pretty obvious. He'd just never say anything because he knows what you're like and he doesn't want to pressure you. As much as I hate admitting it, he's a good guy.", Tony tried to explain.
"Where's the spider lady?", Peter asked, more himself again. Wade and him just returned to the house and found the two in the kitchen. It had taken Wade a while to get Peter out of his head again but being outside seemed to have helped.
"I love it! This shirt plus the Canadian tuxedo? Didn't know that you could pull something like this off.", she remarked as they separated.
"Wade-?", the body, no, Peter asked and relief washed over Wade but only for a second.  The closer he got the worse Peter looked, it didn't help that Gwen was sobbing uncontrollably. Wade fell to his knees by Peter's side.
"Nah, we're staying here for now. Get you settled in. ", Peter replied, looking over at Gwen who gave him a quick nod without looking at him. "I think we should get you some clothes first.  We could do that today if you feel up to it.", Peter suggested next, just trying to get a reaction out of Gwen, even if she just told him no.
He still didn't stop , though. Even when Steve begged him to. Steve held Tony's face in his hands and Tony looked up into those big baby-blues. He was searching for the comfort he usually found in them, the safety. But he had no capacity for that anymore, it was just void.
"And you?", Peter asked, letting out a dry laugh. "Are you doing damage control?" The joke fell flat, as expected and Tony pulled a face.
So, yeah, Peter's journey will continue and it will be difficult and harsh. But it will also be bright and hopeful.
"Okay... Let me start out by saying that I'm sorry and that it wasn't your fault.", She started, not looking at Peter, directing her words towards the floor instead.
"How philosophical of you, Petey-Pie, did they teach you that at HYDRA?" A chuckle shook through Peter's body and Wade could feel Peter's chest shake against his.
Peter returned his attention to the file but still kept on talking. It might've been the most he'd ever said in one go. "Don't get me wrong. These were awful times as well but...not as awful as the things that followed. They're some of the only remotely pleasant memories I have..."
Natasha didn't bat an eyelid. She didn't back down. "I know. But I still want to tell you that I won't let the same thing happen to Gwen. I'll help her, I'll take care of her, I promise."
He woke up five days later in the med-bay at the Avengers-facility upstate. The last few days were a blur. Wade and Tony filled him in on what happened after he passed out.
Bucky froze for a second before glancing up at them. Peter took the opportunity to take the jacket from him , still pressing it to the wound but slowly lowering himself to the ground.
Okay, so I don't know when the next chapter is coming.   I might take some time to write the next two chapters to have them ready and then decide how I split them or maybe it'll be one giant mega chapter. What I'm trying to say is that I might take a couple of days. I think that there are probably 3-4 chapters left. Are you excited? Tell me your thoughts on this chapter or anything in general, your comments have been stellar and they keep me going!
"I think the bath made me tired...", Peter slurred before letting himself fall back into the bed, it was soft, like a marshmallow, or at least that's how he imagined one, he'd never eaten them before.
Peter froze, only for a second and then the boy was on high-alert. "Did you tell him that I'm here?", he asked, his voice controlled, completely ignoring Bucky's question.
Okay, don't panic, this isn't turning into a Peter/MJ thing, I swear this serves a purpose so bare with me!
5 sounds he could hear. Bucky's snoring, the AC in their room, a couple talking down the hallway, a car driving outside, his own heartbeat.
Tony pulled a face, presumably at the word daddy, before rolling with his eyes. "Okay, okay... here. Get yourself something, too. Whatever you want.", he then said as he took out his wallet after rubbing his hands clean on his jeans. He fished out his credit card and handed it to Peter.
"You can threaten us all you want Peter but we're not leaving you by yourself when you're this-", Tony started.
"Wade?", Peter's voice pulled Wade out of the poisonous sea of his thoughts. Wade only now realized that he had stopped dead in his tracks. "Are you coming?", Peter asked holding out his good hand and it took Wade a solid second to understand that Peter was offering to hold Wade's fucking hand. Like...
"And how? Send me to some fucking lab where they take my brain apart?! I can't, Bucky. I can't go back. Please don't make me go back." He was crying by then, it pulled at Bucky's heart, made his throat tight, all this pain and fear that he knew so intimately made it hard to breathe, to keep a clear head in this.
"Peter...", Tony sighed, his tone pleading. "You need to stop talking down on yourself. You're not a burden." Peter heard the words but they bounced off of him without leaving an impact.
So Wade did as he was told, he kicked in the door and didn't look back. Three more HYDRA agents charged at him on the other side but Wade had killed dozens, he could handle a couple more.
. So he slowly pushed down the door handle. The door wasn't locked, at least something. When he stepped into Peter's room he found it empty, completely untouched and a window was open. Wade's heart skipped a beat and then he was running towards the window.
"Yeah, I think so. Sorry.", she mumbled and she actually sounded guilty which Peter couldn't fucking take. Why would she feel sorry for something when she couldn't help it? It wasn't a big deal?
"No. I didn't even really want it back then, I wasn't thinking straight. I'm better now.", he finally replied and it was the truth. Peter was a long ways away from being good but he was definitely better.
It took a week of begging and another week of extensive background checks but Tony eventually allowed MJ to come over to Avengers tower for a month. She was still in the middle of her gap year and together they managed to convince Karen that visiting New York and looking at some possible colleges there was beneficial.
"I'm just dumb, enlighten me.", Peter shrugged, trying to go for a joking tone but it sounded a bit panicky from him.
"But you didn't feel anything either. It's fine.", Peter finished for her. Peter got what she ment immediately. She wasn't into him and now she thought that he'd be disappointed. Little did she know that he hadn't enjoyed it much himself either.
"No-", Tony gasped out, jumping from his chair. He reached towards Peter but Peter flinched back. Even when he did that, his expression never changed.
"I can't!", he suddenly exclaimed and it was the loudest Peter had ever been. "I can't, okay?", he repeated, quieter this time and it was almost like a plea, every word dripping with desperation. "What if I go back? How long until I snap again? What if it's worse next time? What if I kill-", his voice broke off, eyes wide and terrified.
By the time they reached the apartment , Tony made no attempt to hide his trembling. If Peter wasn't on the other side of that door he might just spontaneously combust. Steve knocked. One second passed, two, three, on the fourth the door was pulled open and Barnes greeted them. He said something but Tony felt like his head was under water. He led them into the apartment, one step, two, three and there he was, Peter, sitting on the livingroom couch, looking so absolutely normal and okay that Tony wanted to bawl his eyes out on the spot. "Peter-", Tony gasped, heading for his son on instinct. He realized a second too late what he was doing and by then Peter already tensed up, bracing himself for whatever was to come. Tony lowered his arms, taking a few steps back. "Sorry, I didn't mean to-", he stammered but Peter already shook his head.
"You're already dead, now it's just a matter of moving on. It's time. ", Death told him. "Now get out of my car!", she added before reaching across Peter to open his door and shove him out.
"I'm not like you. I'm flawless. They don't have to be close by to activate me", Gwen replied, the slightest trace of distaste in her tone. So they found a way. Not only to break down Gwen's mind but also do it in a more effective way.
Ahh, it's 3 am where I live but I desperately wanted to update this because I'm so fucking thankful for all of your responses. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Peter was in quite the mood when they returned to their appartment in the avengers facility. He quickly crossed the livingroom where Wade was laying on the couch and disappeared in his room, slamming the door behind him.
When he saw the caller ID he couldn't pick up quickly enough.  He hadn't spoken to Tony since he left but the other man promised to call as soon as he heard something new about Peter.
Surprise! He didn't. "I mean, as often as you want. I'd prefer for you to not leave by yourself but as long as someone accompanies you, you're free to go.", Tony replied simply and Peter froze on the spot.
"Peter. I need you to focus on what we talked about. Focus on the present. It's 2019, you're not at HYDRA anymore. Wade saved you. You are safe.",the man then said and he started to repeat it, over and over again until it seeped into his mind, pulling Peter out of his head. It was a struggle but eventually Peter glanced up at Bucky who was still pinning him to the ground, his eyes a little clearer, and let out a faint whisper.
"I'm not falling for anyone. Just protecting him.", Wade quickly shot back. He didn't think of Peter that way, didn't plan on getting attached.
He drove him to a store to get him some real clothes and he just let Wade pick out stuff for him, he didn't even try them on, just went straight to the registry. "Aren't you gonna change, too?", Peter then asked after Wade paid the clothes and they went back to the car.
When Tony came in he looked out of breath and frantic. Like he ran here in a hurry. His eyes were wide and excited.
