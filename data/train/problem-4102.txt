“But I can at least tell you what I wanted to know so you can think about it. Maybe?”
Aaron is waiting for Dean on the parking lot of the Roadhouse when Dean gets off work, and Dean can already see, even from afar, that he’s in a foul mood.
“So,” Sam cheerfully says the next morning, while they’re having breakfast in the hotel’s dining room. Cas stayed in bed, of course. “You and Cas.”
Mother doesn’t like Castiel to go play outside on his own. She says that he’s only four and so, bad things could happen to him. But he’s smart. Mrs. Philips at school says he’s smarter than all the other kids. He can already read and write. He’s very clever. He’s sad that Mother doesn’t see it, or say anything about it. She’s always telling things to her friends about Michael, but never about Gabriel or him.
He takes his arm away. “Listen, I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry it has come to this, and I’m sorry it’s not going great with Cas, but you can’t do that. You can’t blackmail me.”
Slowly, as Cas puts the final touches to his set up, Dean takes off his pants, and shirt, taking the time to fold them carefully before facing Cas again. “Right.”
“I just need him to give me the pills and… tell me I’ll be okay. I can manage the rest.”
. Dean could very well fall asleep, but his stomach won’t let him be.
“What happened?” Cas asks, and something in his eyes and the tone of his voice finishes to break Dean’s resolve. “Please, talk to me.”
And yeah, he can’t even talk about talking about his feelings. He’s aware it’s a problem for him. A problem he’s been trying to solve. He made a lot of effort. And Cas had to go and puke all over them.
“That’s none of your business.”
“You penetrated him?”
, and he said he liked Dean, and Dean let himself believe that this was more than what it looked like, and he had to open his big mouth and break his own heart like the huge stupid dumbass that he is.
At least he knows. And Dean knows that Amelia wants a baby. Were those the last secrets between them?
Subject: I quit
“It’s not—” Dean says as he turns around, but the look on Ellen’s face stops him. “I do,” he just says instead of arguing.
“I’ll think about it.”
Oh. Yeah.
Fuck! He’s exhausted. He doesn’t need this. He just wants to curl around Cas and sleep. Or smother Cas with a pillow until he fucking stops behaving like a zombie.
“Uh, I try. What’s up?”
So, in a way, he wants her to know what’s happening. To an extent.
Being a very emotional creature, even though he rarely shows it, Dean’s used to feeling impatient, or excited. About the prospect of a good hunt, a good beer, or a good pie. Sometimes a good fuck.
Dean is too, but he can’t tell him that. Cas wouldn’t understand why Dean is cutting any and all physical contact. Even if Dean tells him it’s in his best interest.
Graham doesn’t move. He stays in the way, giving Dean a once over.
“So have I.”
“I’m the last arrival in the team. I didn’t want to make waves.” He takes a breath, hesitating before he adds, “I thought that maybe I had been accustomed to excellence, and that I should give her a chance.”
Cas frowns again. “I asked when you could pencil in the Browns. The investors?”
God, Dean is beautiful. Castiel traces the path of his freckles with his eyes, content to just let Dean speak. He doesn’t want to make a decision just yet.
“Uh,” he lets out. “It’s a nice sentiment but I’m pretty sure the Board would disagree with you.”
, he holds that one back, teeth clamping on his lower lip until only a faint
She doesn’t answer, eyes as big as plate.
Dean raises his hands in the air in mock innocence.
“We need a fresh start.”
“A’right, a’right…” Dean answered as he repositioned himself until he could kiss the sensitive skin of Cas’s balls, licking a strip from bottom to top. Cas huffed in relief, and pushed back a little, demanding.
“Ah. Yes… what was it… Sean?”
Novak ignores the question. “At what age did you lose your virginity and how?”
Castiel hears the lock turn on the bathroom door, and the water running. He gets out, slowly, and walks home.
Still avoiding his eyes, Cas shrugs. “I just wanted to visit the city.”
“Orgasm,” Cas grunts before Dean can say anything.
Dean briefly entertains the idea of calling Aaron, but dismisses it as quickly as it comes.
Which is to say he doesn’t have much to focus on, because he’s in the process of losing it, and his own home along with it.
Cas makes a disappointed noise with the back of his throat, eyes blinking open in surprise. So Dean doesn’t make him wait. Still stroking Cas’s dick with his other hand, he pushes his underwear down, until his balls are at least visible on camera.
“This is…”
“You know, when I asked if we were together, I guess it was a bit of wishful thinking. It really felt like that sometimes, even more so after the date, so I guess I didn’t think you’d turn me down when I asked.”
“Sorry. Habits.”
His eyes snapped to Dean as soon as he spoke. It was a mistake.
“You—” Dean chokes on his saliva.
She smiles back. “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
Cas hums. His eyes dart to his plate, only to come back to Dean and down again in rapid succession.
Dean deflates. Maybe he’s being unfair. Aaron is compassionate, despite the way he was raised. Dean’s so used to being berated, used to Cas who always tries to kick Dean into action no matter what, that he now expects it from everyone.
“What’s your point?”
He can see Aaron is holding one back as well.
, how can he act natural in this situation?
“Uh,” Dean breathes out. It takes a second of his brain screeching to a halt before he can find something to answer. “I thought you’d enjoy it. All the science stuff. And I thought you liked Cas?”
The Doc’s watching him, mouth half opened. For once, he lost all his air of indifference, and Dean would almost be glad if it didn’t feel as weird. When Novak notices Dean watching, he shifts in his seat. There’s no mistaking the bulge in his pants for anything other than what it is.
Novak scoffs. “The only reason I need you is because of your promiscuity. Nobody else decent would do your job!”
Despite that, Cas responds enthusiastically. He seems to have been waiting for this. As he’s kissing Cas with all he has, Dean nudges him a little, and Cas lets himself be pushed blindly toward Dean’s bedroom.
But can Dean see him? It’s the middle of the day. What if he’s in the OR? Can Dean wait in his office? Will they let him?
Cas gives him a very serious look. “Yes.”
and Dean’s going to die with his mouth open because something broke in him hearing the word coming out of an actual
This isn’t what Dean wanted to hear.
“Why Roy Olson?”
“I’m not scared,” Adler bristles. He’s playing with his hands now. “It’s just bloody hard to get turned on knowing my—” he cuts himself off. “Knowing people are watching.”
“Okay,” Castiel replies, a little too fast.
It’s all going to Hell, apparently. This is a nightmare. Dean’s going to wake up any second now.
-_-_-_-_-_-
“I understand,” he solemnly says.
It’s almost like Cas is touching him. If Dean’s arm wasn’t as tired, biceps muscles screaming at him to stop moving it hurts so bad, it would be. But he’s been jerking off for so long, it’s like his body refuses to comply anymore.
She gets his meaning, and a small laugh leaves her lips. “I’d think watching people… do the Do every night would be enough to make anyone happy for a life time.”
“Orgasm,” Dean says as Benny grunts and stills.
Dean focuses on the heat on that hand, slowing down his breathing. He wriggles his toes inside his shoes, flexes the muscles in his thighs. Tries to imagine heat going from his chest to his groin. He so rarely has the time to do that, to just enjoy his body while getting ready to get an orgasm. Usually, he just has to go fast and hard, just for the release of it, because of Sam, because he doesn’t have time, because he doesn’t really feel like sex but just it just seems like having an orgasm is a good idea.
It doesn’t reassure him in the least. Cas was doing fine before he launched his study. He didn’t need Dean. All he wanted was someone who wasn’t afraid of bodily fluids, and Dean was the right guy for this particular job. Other than that, Dean’s not sure he’s indispensable.
“You know I don’t like talking about the Study in public,” Cas sighs.
He doesn’t say all of this out loud, of course. Instead, he reaches for the cups, bringing one down, “These ones?”
And it’s one Victor doesn’t appreciate seeing on a crime scene. It just means it’s going to be messy, and it’s going to take forever to examine entirely. Which means the results will be delayed, and the case will take more time to solve. As if he needed this.
“Reassuring,” Dean whispers, which prompts Cas to shush him sternly.
And that’s how the game started.
“She said she could smell it on you when we were fucking,” Dean shrugs. He feels emotionless. Exhausted. “And that she’d tell Amelia if we kept going.”
“Pleasuring myself to the sight of you doing the same?” Novak huffs, incredulous.
“I can’t promise anything,” he finally says, “but I can try. Are you, uh… are you free on Wednesdays between five and six?”
Footsteps echo suddenly outside the room, and they jump away from each other. Castiel almost falls out of the bed. He freezes, waiting. The person outside the door seems to have stopped. After a while, the footsteps can be heard again, fading away, going down the stairs.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
It was awkward, but he needed the talk. Now, as he pushes his tongue into Cas’s mouth, his mind is more peaceful that it’s been in weeks.
Dean catches him by the elbow as he passes him. “Wait, wait, wait!” And Cas gives him a long-suffering glare, but lets himself be guided by Dean’s hand to the seat opposite Dean.
Cas seems satisfied, and he bends over to retrieve a bottle of lubricant from his medical bag. He scoots closer, one leg elegantly folded under the other, until his clothed thigh is touching Dean’s naked one. Only then does he rest his hand on the bed near the small of Dean’s back.
She’s much too happy to leave, but Dean can’t hold it against her.
So Dean tries to go with the program. “Come on, Cas, you gonna make me beg for it?”
“You said we had to do it for each other so it would be fair.”
Not his fault, though. He’s feeling jittery.
But Cas is faster than him. His hand shoots up, catching Dean’s arm and twisting it behind his back. Dean, in his weak, horny state, can’t fight it.
“Sure,” Dean answers. “Maybe start with blockers, put more on before we start, even, then shower and try without. Write down how it feels comparatively.”
He’s setting up his laptop, and isn’t looking at Dean. In fact, he hasn’t been looking at Dean all day.
something!”
Dean holds his breath, relaxes his whole body, and he comes.
Novak’s about to answer when, very clearly, a thought crosses his mind, and he closes his mouth. Dean sees it because the Doc’s eyes widen, and he tilts his head on the side. A clear sign he’s thinking about something.
“I think… this could be feasible…” he says, but raises a finger when Amelia starts smiling like she just won the lottery. “But I want to meet them. I want to talk about it with them. I wouldn’t be comfortable doing this in a stranger’s back and then all of a sudden ask him for money.”
The realization that this is probably what’s happening sends him into a fit of uncontrollable giggles. Doesn’t stop Cas from trying to kiss him through it.
“Yes,” Charlie answers. She straightens up. “Yeah. Is that… is that okay?”
“Try it on,” Cas suggests. “I think it’s the right size, but I can return it if the bracelet doesn’t fit.”
Dean nods. “Yup. You?”
The situation doesn’t seem so dire anymore. The tension slowly leaves Dean’s shoulders as he realizes he’s got this. He’s got a grip on this.
The rest is used as space for the omegas to relax. He finds the omegas waiting to be seen by Cas there, and send in the next one.
Dean frowns. He tries to turn around but it’s hard. He lets out a frustrated sigh.
“Sam…”
“Dean Winchester. He was the vic’s… bed warmer, I guess.”
He needs to go home.
He eyes Cas as the angel sits next to Sam, playing with the inches of sleeve that cover his hands. Dean’s not used to seeing him wearing pajamas, not yet, so he looks away, for fear he’ll keep staring if he doesn’t.
This makes Dean stop chewing. “What d’you mean?”
They let go of each other’s hand and simultaneously turn to Dean.
“Get me naked first.”
Dean lets out an uncomfortable breath. “Haven’t had an occasion to test that.”
Clasping his hands together, he drops his ass on the bed.
“How do we know you’re real?” he asks.
“Does that mean I get a raise as well?”
“Shut up,” Dean says in a laugh, pushing Cas’s face away.
Cas growls. Something primal flutters inside Dean’s chest, and his eyes blink open on their own. Cas is fisting the sheets, head tilted back, breathing through his nose like he’s holding himself back.
Sam shrugs. Oh, but there’s something more to it, there’s something he’s not telling. “Because…” he hesitates, “I see you come home and you’re pissed. And at first I didn’t like that you spent so much time there but you seemed… happy. Now it’s not the same.”
Dean straightens up, interested. “Could we?”
“Bro, are you seriously asking me for advice on your love life?”
“Don’t look so disappointed,” Pamela tells him with a sigh, “I’m gonna cry.”
“Got a case,” Rufus tells him. He starts walking away, so Victor hastily follows, “should be easy enough that I can put some rookies on it.”
Dean’s eyes finally blink open. They stare at each other, the smell of arousal still permeating the air, making this whole situation suddenly very uncomfortable.
They’re testing positions and their impact on orgasms, both on omegas and Alphas. So far, the results have been really impressive, and the Doc is in a very good mood. It seems to be proving that omegas have better orgasms.
The pressure is incredible. Dean can’t help moaning again, eyes closing on their own. Cas seems to take that as a positive sign and gives a bigger push of hips.
“Perfect. Sorry, I’m trying to hold back from—”
And Dean is suddenly aware of his surrounding again. “Uh, sorry. I was somewhere else.”
Dean opens his mouth to answer, a resounding ‘yes, and?’ on the tip of his tongue, until he realizes that it’s true.
“I’m trying,” he grins in triumph, grinding his hips against Cas and relishing the spark of lazy pleasure that runs up his spin. “Now you run the live commentary if you want.”
Dean wonders how she actually got this job. He doesn’t know her, but he’s starting to get a feel of Doc Graham, and he scared to imagine what might have happened during her interview.
“Right.”
To his credit, he really looks like he didn’t think about that. “Yeah, of course. I’m sorry. I won’t bother you too long, then.”
“You presented as Alpha?”
She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear and turns off the burner before she speaks.
Cas’s hips snap against Dean’s ass. Dean tries to raise his knees to his chest, but the Doc holds him down, “We said missionary first,” he pants.
“Heh, it’s fine. Really interesting, so it makes up for the hassle.”
It’s nothing outright. He doesn’t show it, most of the time, but Dean thinks he can see it, hear it in the way he speaks of his study, of his regular patients sometimes. He really loves what he does, and what he sought to achieve.
Amelia takes the flowers, and gives Dean a warm hug, “Merry Christmas!”
“I, huh, I’d like to know how it works, to, hum, to start an undergrad program—””
Meg was right. Castiel really needed an omega with him, to help him understand all the intricacies of the omega body. He thought he knew everything, before. He sees channels all day long, after all, but he never thought he could learn so much more.
“And you need me to stand there with my eyes closed like an idiot while you do?” Cas asks, dryly.
“You know,” Sam insists, in a wink-wink, nudge-nudge way. “Did you…?”
The last couple of inches he swallows in one last tiny buck of hip. The pleasure is unlike anything Dean’s ever known. He exhales, like he’s been punched in the stomach, and a wave of goosebumps runs up his arms.
He’s hoping once they get to it, he won’t be sleeping with Cas anymore.
“We’ll just…” Castiel sighs, looking around, “smoke his damn cigars and then leave, okay?”
Once he does, though, oh! Heat comes to his face, a heat so fierce that only the Fires of Hell can rival it.
“You—” Dean starts, and stops himself, because he’s not about to ask Cas about him going at it with his wife when they’re edging dangerously close to cheating territory, “Okay. Just…”
Huffing, Dean stays his hand and repositions himself so he’ll be comfortable. He has a feeling he’s going to be there for a while.
He’s started to sweat. His ass starts clenching and unclenching around nothing, the simple pressure of air on his rim making him leak like a faucet.
“It’s…” he starts, but thinks better of what he was going to say, “I understand.”
“What did she say to you?” Cas asks angrily as he turns to Dean.
Or they would, for anything other than this.
Castiel nods. Alright, then. They’ve talked about this. About Castiel trusting Dean a little bit more, hold back on the jealous bursts of rage. So he lets it go, and they go back to their apartment, make love, and things go back to normal.
His whole body hurts, his channel feels empty, and he almost can’t touch his cock anymore. He’s masturbated so much over the weekend that the action doesn’t hold any meaning anymore.
“I just wish you would stop taking so many risks,” Cas finally says.
Frankly, he wouldn’t care if it wasn’t for his mother’s propensity to spread rumors. It’s her favorite past-time, and she’s very good at it.
Dean eyes Martha, who is not even trying to pretend to work. She’s just squinting at them both, utterly confused.
“He was talking about you during his interview, yes?”
Plus, Cas is being really casual about it. This makes Dean nervous. Of course, he doesn’t say anything about it. They make small talk in the car, mostly discussing their next visit to the brothel next Sunday, but it does nothing to untwist the knots in Dean’s stomach.
Cas sighs, sitting down. Dean resists the pull on his arms. “Everyone reacts differently, you know that.”
“We’ve just spent three days together. And there’s still daylight.” Aaron drops a kiss on his temple, then pinches his cheek, “Stop whining. It’s unbecoming.”
“Then Michael took over. And here we are.”
“Have you ever had an orgasm?” Dean clarifies.
“Alright, end of discussion,” Dean spits.
To reassure himself, he lifts Dean’s head with great care and positions it on his chest. And he holds him. He just holds him.
Dean tries to protest, but his eyes won’t stay open. “I—No, you can’t—” he huffs.
Gabriel gets bored very quickly, looks like, and he comes running back to the house. Castiel doesn’t have time to do anything. Gabriel is already on him, pulling him by the arm.
And there they are, the tears. They fill Castiel’s eyes, blurring his vision. He wants to hold them back, to hide how weak he is when it comes to Dean, but he can’t. “I’m not normal,” he says. And somehow, he sounds like his young self. “I was never normal. And you were like me. You… you still are, sometimes. I can’t lose you because if I do, I’ll…”
But, again, not what he wants to think about right now.
Dean has trouble reigning in his first reflex, which would be to push Cas away and tell him that,
Hopefully, Dean didn’t catch the sentiment in his voice.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-
“If you’re so impatient,” Cas sighs, “stop interrupting every two seconds and get to it.”
“And you asked me why we moved so far away from my Mom and Dad’s families and I didn’t want to answer?”
“Go to Hell. To ask her?”
Of course, they still stare at Dean and Aaron standing too close to each other, one of them raising a mocking eyebrow at and leaning toward his friend to whisper something in her ear. They laugh.
“Uh, Doc, I didn’t see you there. I was, uh, you know. On the phone. There was a matter of—”
A watch. Cas bought him a watch.
“Right. Well… huh, Castiel,” Dean tries out loud. He doesn’t like how the name rolls off his tongue, but if the Doc insists… “I don’t know if we would get anything different from what we have now. From a data standpoint. I mean, we have observations from manual stimulation and penetrative sex, so…”
“Uh,” Dean answers, inhaling the cold air in an attempt to push down the nausea. “I think so. I just had one too many.”
“Sam!”
Dean huffs incredulously, putting a few inches between him and Cas. He can’t believe it.
Beside that fact, Cas has been trying to be more open with them ever since he and Dean talked. It’s a good thing, at least, but Dean learned not to push it. Sam says Cas needs to work things out in his own time, and, for once, Dean agrees.
Dean hangs up, and the smug smile that comes as he does stays stuck on his face the whole day. Oh, how he can’t wait to see the Doc again and throw this whole thing in his face!
“I thought he was a grad student…”
Gabriel chews on his lower lip for a while, before he opens his mouth again.
. “I guess,” Dean shrugs.
Aaron hums, but the anger is gone from his face. He’s more thoughtful than anything else.
And he misses Cas.
Castiel doesn’t like other children. Even his brothers. Sometimes, Gabriel is okay. But today, he’s not playing with Castiel. There’s something more interesting happening outside. Someone new is moving into the house across the street.
“I’ll see you in the office,” he says, so low Dean barely hears it, and finally makes for the door.
“We can go to the drive-in if you want. There’s this monster flick… Ghost of… or, uh, Phantom of the Morgue or something. The poster looks neat.”
“Hm, that sucks,” Dean sighs. They all turn to him. “I mean, your boss fucked you over more than once, and you still want to go running back to that asshole?”
“What happened?”
And, right, Dean’s prepared for that one, because he’s heard it before.
“I’m still waiting for the report on Mr. and Mrs. Smith’s appointment,” the Doc barks at him without looking up from his paperwork.
Cas seems satisfied by that answer, and looks back at the stage. He keeps stroking Dean’s thigh.
“We can’t work here,” Cas interrupts. “This isn’t worth anyone’s career.” He briefly stops in front of their shared office and makes sure Dean is looking him in the eye before he speaks next. “Nobody’s career is worth another person’s agency. Nobody’s worth putting you through this. Not me, not anyone. Do you understand?”
It takes Dean a little while to digest everything. It makes a lot of sense, and Dean hates that it does.
“I don’t know if that’s a great idea.”
Michael grins, triumphantly. “Say it,” he quickens the pace he set with his fingers. “Say you’re my slut.”
Gosh, why can’t he stop changing his mind? Five seconds ago he felt like the world was ending, and now he’s considering this, of all things, when he’s barely decided if he wants to quit school or not.
It feels strange to put it out there, just like that, but it also feels right. So Dean waits, gazing into Cas’s eyes, searching, looking for a sign that would tell him he said the right thing. Except nothing comes. Nothing’s changed on Cas’s face, beside the fact that his grumpy frown disappeared.
It probably makes the guilt less prominent, Castiel figures. It works for Castiel, at least. It makes it a little less hard to come home to Amelia.
He’s pale, sweaty, fingers clenching and unclenching in an endless rhythm. He’s looking at a random spot, on the other side of the room. He sounds tired.
“I’m trying to have sex with you.”
He’s so surprised but the outburst that he’s speechless for a moment.
The heat from Cas’s face disappears, like he straightened up.
Gabriel shrugs, wiping the tears off his face. “I figured when I started lusting on Sam when he was barely twelve,” he sneers, disgusted, “that it was probably my cue to leave.”
“Kiss her,” Castiel repeats. “Or I take out one of her eyes.”
It’s warm, and soft, and just chubby enough that it probably feels too big once it’s inside of you…
“She did what she had to do,” Graham continues, straightening up, “and she kept her job, and her cushy salary. Her sweetheart kept his job as well, and now they’re a happy married couple with a beautiful house. Happily ever after,” he exclaims, almost throwing his arms up in the air.
“Stop it,” Cas shakes his head. “You read a lot, and you’re very clever. Stop undermining yourself.”
He gathers his coat, and his briefcase, and busies himself by rearranging his desk to his usual standard of tidiness.
Cas lets him talk Michael’s ears off, and slowly walks to Gabriel. Gabriel looks up at him, pleading, tears spilling freely on his face. Snot is gathering under his nose, down into the gag in his mouth. He’s pathetic. Castiel’s heart flutters. “Gabe,” he says, low. He crouches in front of him, hesitantly pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket, and wiping his brother’s nose. “I’m… sorry. For what I’m about to do. I shouldn’t have involved you in this.” If only Castiel didn’t take this to heart, and didn’t bring Gabriel here… but it’s done, now. No going back. Is that what it’s like to feel guilty? “I thought you could handle it, but Dean is right.”
“Are you?”
He doesn’t dare look at Cas. He’s scared he’ll give up on the kiss if he does, if he sees even the slightest hint of a doubt in his friend’s eyes. He can’t afford it, not now. So instead, he slowly opens the door, and pulls Cas inside the room.
But dwelling on it won’t do Castiel any good, anyway. He’s never been good with people. He’s not about to start now.
Writing it down, all right. Dean tries not to picture himself on his knees, in front of Novak standing up, jerking his cock off fast and rough, coming with a grunt while Dean waits under him, tongue at the ready—
What he does first is close his eyes. He relaxes his body, legs parting slowly as he breathes in, and out. In, and out. He lets the arousal boil under his skin, and it doesn’t takes long. His smell is all over the room, it seems.
“H-how?”
A pleasured flush rises up his cheeks at the words, but he plays it down. “It’s never been commented on before.”
“I’m… not sure…”
Despite himself, Dean shakes his head. “Don’t say that”, he tries, although he knows she’s right, but he can’t bring himself to tell her the truth. Of course he can’t. “I’m sure we can find something… I don’t know, to calm him down or something. It’s a difficult time, but once he finds another job—”
sometimes, he knew it did things to Dean and Dean couldn’t resist that sound, when Dean was trying to take things in his own hands and Cas just didn’t agree with the plan.
He’s so pumped for it he ends up dragging Cas behind him. The angel doesn’t say anything, just follows, eyes gleaming under the city lights.
Dean can’t stop thinking about it.
So he just stopped.
(212) 555-3411
Dean shakes his head. He can’t let Cas know what’s happening. He wants to say something, anything, that he’s busy or whatever, but nothing comes out.
“Oh.”
He feels like he’s smothered cotton, he can’t move. When he looks down, there’s something white and sticky-looking on his stomach. What--?
As Dean finally pinches a nipple, rolling it lightly between his thumb and forefinger, Cas lets out a low moan. The chat is going crazy.
The agents exchange a look. Henriksen raises his eyebrows in surprise. “So you admit you had motive to go after her.”
Cas nods with a thoughtful hum. “Well, I’m pretty sure mother will hate to have you there with us, and that would make me really happy,” he says, and gives Dean a knowing smile. “But I understand. I’ll ask Amelia, and let you know what she thinks. I’m sure she’ll agree that it would be nice, though.”
They’re lucky the cards with their participants’ names on them are already secured in Cas’s safe. The rest of the files only bear the code names they gave them, for privacy. Dean doesn’t even want to imagine what Adler would have done with them if he had people’s name.
Cas fucks him thoroughly with his fingers, and Dean comes harder than he as in years.
He wonders what happened that soured Cas’s mood that much. Dean’s long learned not to take it personally when he’s like this. Besides, the last time they saw each other they had some wonderful sex, so Dean doubts Cas is angry with him for
Actually he’d been so caught up in this little game that they hadn’t switched for a couple weeks, now. He didn’t took the time to take notes on Cas’s behavior when the angel was pounding into him because he was enjoying himself too much.
, he thinks as he walks inside the Clinic and sees Cas furiously stomping out of his office. The look on his face doesn’t promise anything good.
Cas is really starting to look at him weird.
And then he would be taken seriously. By Cas, and by the medical community as a whole. It could help with the Study. It could improve so many things.
“I can’t do anything for you, Cassie.” And now Balthazar is serious. For once. “Besides, Tony was a nice piece of arse, but we’re over.”
It takes him a little while after that to be able to look at her, and thankfully she doesn’t say anything while he gathers himself.
“Right. Well, call me when you want to get together, okay?”
“We could renew our vows every year,” Cas says. “With a different Elvis each time. Then we’d open a blog to rank them.”
Rufus grunts as he sits in his chair, on the other side of the desk. “Sit,” he orders, waving a hand at the chair next to the one the girl’s taken. “So,” Rufus eyes them both, “Victor, this is Pamela Barnes. Pamela, Victor Henriksen. Get used to each other. If this works, you’re likely to be paired for a while.”
“I’m a trained professional.”
First, I'm sorry that I'm a bit behind on the posting schedule, school has started again, and I'm swamped and also stressed, and stress = not a lot of creative juice left, but I'm determined to see this through, so please be patient with me! I'm hoping that i'll be able to be done by the end of the year (maybe we'll do double feature for christmas and new year, how about that?) I don't want to promise anything, but I will do my best!
He feels empty.
But he doesn’t comment further, walking away to the living room.
Dean doesn’t even want to ask. He just gulps the rest of his eggs, and goes back to work before Novak tears him a new one.
But the phone is within reach, now, he just has to push on his legs, hold on to the kitchen counter while he dials Castiel’s office number, and hang on to the receiver for dear life as he does. It’s not easy, but he manages. Once the phone’s ringing, he crumples on the floor again, phone to his ear.
Cas gently grazes Dean’s arm, unsure if he can touch him, but Dean relaxing against the touch lets him gain confidence. He runs his thumb along Dean’s forearm, above his shirt, and smiles.
She purses her lips and play-punches him in the arm. “Shut up. Maybe you’re the one who doesn’t have a choice, hm?”
“Alright,” Cas says, very seriously as he pushes one of Dean’s knees apart from the other to position himself. “No talking.” And he pushes in.
And he’s sure there’ll be plenty. If only he could observe them in a neutral environment, with EEGs and EKGs and actual graphs. Not this parody of research he’s doing now.
Dean licks his lips, mouth dry as the Sahara. “Uh…” He steps closer, takes a quick sniff in the direction of the Doc’s chest. Christ, he hasn’t smell something that good in… forever. “Hum. Yeah.” He clears his throat. “Yeah, it’ll do.”
But Ash looks uncomfortable as well, now. “I mean, Dean, man, I won’t force it on him if he doesn’t want it.”
She snorts, rolling her eyes. “Would you feel better if I told you I sucked some dicks?” Standing up, she picks up the pictures from the floor. “Not that I did, mind you. I actually worked, too.”
“What?”
She turns to her stove again.
Cas keeps fucking into him hard, oblivious to Dean’s sudden epiphany.
He checks his watch. Seven forty-two. Cas must be coming close to the end of his run. In five minutes, he’ll be in the showers. At eight sharp, he’ll be here.
“What the hell?” he mumbles under his breath before trying again.
“Thanks, Dean.”
. He gently turns them around, making sure that all the while they’re still linked by their mouths.
As he speaks, Dean settles between his legs again, and yeah. His cock is right in front of Dean’s face, gloriously hard, already leaking a little from the kiss and the earlier friction with Dean’s pants.
“’Morning,” Dean mumbles.
There’s a pressing need to say something rising inside Dean, but he pushes it down. Now’s not the time. Everything he does, every little nip of teeth, press of lips feels sacred. Every moan and hum like a prayer. A hope, that it won’t hurt, that it’ll be fast, that they’ll be okay. That maybe they won’t need to do this the way Cas planned.
“S—stop,” Cas breathes out.
Yes, they could still see each other. Of course they could. Doesn’t mean they should. Doesn’t mean they will.
Dean lets out a breathy, silent laugh, and his left hand pushes Cas’s underwear down, slowly, as his right hand, still under Cas’s, reaches for the crown of Cas’s cock.
“I know, I know.”
He can’t think anymore. He doesn’t need to. All he can hear is the noises of flesh on flesh and the little ‘ah’s he’s letting out at regular intervals now.
Letting his weight fall on Dean’s hand--  it’s still in Cas’s ass, by the way-- Cas bops their forehead together, hands on Dean’s shoulder.
Well. If the thought won’t leave him, if he still thinks about it in a couple of days, or maybe a week, then he’ll go have a look at the registration office.
It’s just for the study, he tells himself. For science. That’s all it is to Novak, so why wouldn’t it be the same for him?
Sam slowly turns his head to look at him, blinking as if he’s surprised.
“Come on,” Dean says, “enough talking!”
“It’s fine,” Dean answers in the same tone, opening the cupboard. “I wasn’t expecting the Doc’s mother to be a prejudiced bitch, but I’m used to it, you know?”
They’re still working at the hospital, of course. That’s one thing Cas won’t budge on. They almost went through the entire sum that Doug Hoffmann (Doc Graham’s CEO friend) gave them, so they still need a salary.
Now the Doc’s outright sucking on his nipple, but Dean doesn’t care. Pleasure courses through him, from his groin to all of his extremities. His cock pulses as he releases his load, and with a last gasp, all his muscles unlock, like a puppet with its strings cut.
“Didn’t have one yet, but it should come soon.”
“Come on,” Dean says when the glass is empty. He takes it from Cas, pushes himself off the floor and put the glass down on the marble counter.
And it’s not like he needs it, anyway. He’s compassionate enough that he became one of the favorite omega and beta OB-GYN in the county, according to Omega Weekly.
Really, he has no excuse.
She’s defensive. He can’t blame her.
So Dean does the same. He inhales. His lungs burn.
Speaking of Sam, Dean’s brother is lounging on the couch when Dean gets home to their tiny one bedroom apartment, reading something about astrophysics that gives Dean a headache just by looking at it.
With a shyness that Dean hasn’t seen Cas exhibit ever, he brings out a jewelry box, and puts it down in front of Dean.
Gabriel looks up at him like he just saw him, and frowns. “No… No, it’s fine. It’s nothing he hasn’t done before…”
“So, you’re not tired of sucking his dick?”
Dean has to bite his tongue to prevent himself from moaning hearing that sentence coming out of Cas’s mouth. “Uh,” he exhales. “I don’t know. However’s comfy for you.”
Tees and pants get discarded, still without urgency and without a word. It’s probably been an hour since they’ve been laying in bed, when Cas hums.
He doesn’t sigh as he pushes away from his desk and stands. He knows Martha reports to Graham, and Castiel is not on great standing with him. But he wants to.
“Alright,” Dean laughs quietly. “You take care, alright? And you call me after your first day. I want to know everything!”
He’s right. Again.
“I don’t need help.”
The silence seems heavy to him. But Cas appears completely comfortable.
Dean lets out an incredulous scoff at that.
Dean swallows. He can’t cry, because otherwise she’ll know. He’s sure she’d know if anything showed on his face. So instead, he smiles.
“No, no, I’m not trying to dissuade you…”
He has to hurry and be clear about it.
Dean holds his gaze. “Seriously? The other day you ran after me for two hours until I listened to your story about a ménage à… twelve. Or whatever. Don’t tell me you don’t like it when other people watch.”
“Three practices,” Graham says, holding up three fingers, “three wages. Per month, of course. Plus two weeks of paid leave and three sick days. What do you say?”
“Alright.”
Cas nods, “His secondary gender?”
“Cut the crap,” Dean explodes. And Novak apparently didn’t expect an outburst, so he’s struck silent for a second, which allows Dean to continue. “You’re pissed at something so you’re taking it out on me. And when we’ll be—” He stops himself, drops his voice and bend over the desk, “when we’ll be naked and you’ll need me to perform and I can’t because I feel like a piece of dog shit you just stepped on, then you’ll apologize and tell me you
Cas’s whole body is pinning him down, trapping one of Dean’s arm under his own belly, the other currently being forced up Dean’s back by one of Cas’s hand. With his other hand, Cas is pushing his face into the mattress.
“No,” Dean repeats.
“She wanted to pay off my debts,” Cas scoffs.
Dean walks up the steps of the Grand City Hall, and he wonders if his best Sunday suit is even good enough for this type of gathering.
“Why not?”
Dean can’t say anything.
Rufus raises an eyebrow at Victor. “Problem?”
“Uhm,” he lets out.
”, Graham answers through the device.
“Well, you’ll find that it goes much smoother with someone. Trust me.”
“Mom. Hey,” he breathes.
Dean just hums at that. The last person he wants to talk about is Naomi.
“I mean we’re studying couples, yeah.”
Well, shit. It’s not like Dean has a choice, now, is it?
That’s Castiel’s cue, and he takes it, lying down on Dean with a graceful sway of his hips. Now Dean’s almost naked, his underwear the only thing still in the way. Cas is fully clothed. Dean likes the power imbalance it creates, likes how vulnerable but safe it makes him feel.
And, okay, Dean’s ready to admit he’s been more than annoying today, so he just gives Cas a mockery of a military salute with a cheeky grin on his face, and he shuts his trap.
“Oh no, Dean’s the solitary type. Although I’m guessing that raising a child on your own didn’t help to endear any suitors.”
So he steps inside.
Dean lets her digest the information, but he’s not sure how much longer he can wait.
But there’s the sound of another door opening, Adler’s voice going, “Novak—” before Cas explodes.
But he can’t, can he? First there was Mom, that one he didn’t see coming, but her death marked the beginning of the end. Then there was Dad. This one Dean spotted from a mile away. God only knows what he’s up to these days, if he’s not lying dead in a ditch, and ain’t that a gruesome thought?
Yes. Cas. Ask Cas what this silence thing is all about.
“I was,” Dean starts. He has no idea where he’s going with this. “Resting.”
He’s too exhausted to do so, and so he’s stuck in this vicious cycle of pretending everything is fine and saying ‘I’m sorry’, and letting her think things are going to get better.
“You call that a set back,” Dean asks, suddenly outraged. “I was ready to…”
“Blowjobs? Nah, I don’t blow other guys,” Benny admits. “I might eat some people out. I don’t really like it. Don’t think your mouth should go anywhere near those places, but you know, I want everyone to get their happy ending. So when I come before they do, then I’ll do it. So they can enjoy themselves, too.”
He’s stopped moving again, and the awkwardness comes creeping back.
He’s pretty sure the heat he missed decided to start the show, finally. He’s half-relieved, half-worried at how strong it’s hitting. There’s a bit of apprehension, too. He’s scared it will be as painful, if not more, as last time.
His tone leaves no room for discussion, so Dean settles in front of the punching bag.
“’S fine,” Dean answers. His eyes find the ceiling, tracing the tiles. “We’re testing positions, not orgasm triggers.”
“Besides, you forget that I’m here too. If your brain is distracting you, try to focus on me.”
“Yeah,” Sam says, nodding again. He’s still smiling, but differently this time, in a way that tells Dean he finds it cute. “But maybe last night wasn’t the greatest time…”
“Wow, okay.” Sam’s silent for a moment. “That’s awesome. I get why you stay there so late, then.”
“Okay, your turn.”
Castiel groans. “You couldn’t have waited a couple of days?”
Dean spares a glance at Sam before he does as he’s told. Fucker’s smiling to himself.
He won’t think about what he could have answered. He won’t think about how easy it would have been to tell Dean he wasn’t about second chances, as he said when they first met. But that Dean was an asset, and if he was willing to participate in the study, well… Castiel might keep him around.
“H-how do you know?”
“Ah! Dean!”
It won’t take that long. It might hurt a little but Dean is used to that.
It’s liberating.
If he looks at Cas too much, he’s scared he won’t be able to stay away.
“Okay,” Dean says.
Cas nods, breaking into a smile, and Dean’s heart seems to increase in size.
Because he promised Amelia a night out, and he’s going to arrive home with a smile on his face, and she’ll think it’s because of her.
Dean wasn’t really down with the idea at first, but Cas reassured him, telling him they’d only reenact what they did for the cam session, and, okay. Dean is kind of okay with that, even if it means ending the night with a stiffy again.
Dean gives the poor girl a look that he hopes conveys all his sympathies. “Thanks.”
Benny raises his hands in the air in a ‘what can I say’ kind of gesture. “That’s my name. My real, legal name, I mean,” he adds when Dean raises his eyebrows in surprise. “But this wasn’t… sexy enough as a stage-name. My middle name is Benjamin, my mother’s maiden name is Lafitte, so… Benny Lafitte. Sounded better. I can’t believe I never told you that!”
This isn’t working because he’s being… gloomy. He needs to relax, and stop wallowing in his bad mood. He needs to be the Dean that Cas knows and loves. Because Cas loves him. He can hold on to that.
They keep working, though. They keep on with the study.
“Uh. No. Sammy usually waits until I call ‘im.”
“We’re clear,” Cas sighs.
“Well, he certainly obeys every single one of his wife’s commands, and she really, really wants a child.”
Lucky for him, something lights up on Dean’s intercom. It’s the ‘call’ button for Doctor Kasinsky, but since it’s not ringing, that means Dean has to get up and go see him in the office he shares with Doctor Leroy.
He’s not sure Cas can smell it. He hopes Cas will smell it.
“I was afraid you’d say that,” Cas says, sheepish and avoiding Dean’s eyes.
Dean takes a step back.
Dean huffs, “
“Ah. I was… seventeen. Sixteen? No, seventeen.” Benny licks his lips, his eyes clearly shifting to the side in reminiscence. There’s something secretive about the smile on his lips, too. “She was a friend. My best friend at the time, really. We weren’t dating, per say, but we were always together. So one night… I guess we had a coupla’ beers, went out to the drive-in to watch a movie, and the rest is history.”
Dean just hums, so Castiel doesn’t lose any more time on this discussion. Pushing away from the wall after hanging up, he goes back to his kitchen table. He has some thinking to do.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Cas puts down his menu, and, slowly, unsure of himself but with the look of someone who is tired of being cautious, he offers his hand, palm up, from across the small table.
The screen goes black.
Blinking to dismiss the useless thoughts he was getting lost into, he notices that Martha is gone.
getting better.
“I found a job. I told you I didn’t need your help.”
Dean closes his eyes.
Dean almost rolls his eyes. “Five days ago, you mean. Yeah. Of course I remember.”
He’s a bit confused, if anything, and maybe as a result his brain gets stuck on the fact that
His stomach tightens with anxiety. But Novak’s distracted.
Deans not going to fuck Cas, not tonight. Not yet. This time it’s all about getting what they’ve been craving for months.
.” He spits the last word, which makes Novak look up curiously. “Ever since we abandoned the Study it’s like you don’t think I’m good enough to even type your notes, so I don’t have shit to do, anymore!”
,” she says. “
The first few minutes were awkward as hell, Dean standing next to the bed where Cas was lying on his belly with a few pillows under his hips, trying his best not to laugh at how ridiculous this all was, until Cas started to huff slightly under the pleasure-pain. After that, the laughter died in Dean as he focused on getting Castiel’s ass a nice shade of red.
“Exactly,” Cas exhales.
Dean wants to laugh. He wonders if he confused a lot of patients today by answering like this, but he’s suddenly distracted by a bout of sharp pain in his lower belly, and a whine leave his mouth.
Slowly, as if Dean’s own body is working against him, a smile fights its way to his lips. This is just—this is insane. Cas loves him. Like,
“Well, we Study our reactions to the bond. We test it.”
“That’s not the point,” Dean cut him off. “Cas,” he cups Castiel’s face, forcing him to look into his eyes. “Michael’s your brother. If you do this… people will know. Don’t get me wrong, guy’s a bastard, he deserves it,” he licks his lips, “but… you don’t. You don’t deserve getting caught because of him.”
Charlie nods. Dean feels Novak’s heated, furious gaze on him, but his smile doesn’t waver. “We just need to know your background to establish a basis from which we, uh, can build our results.”
“Uh, hi,” he tells the clerk, a blond lady with a flashy red suit. “We have, huh, reservations for two nights.”
“Okay, you know.”
And what if he becomes delirious again and forget to take care of himself? That could be very dangerous.
The smug look Cas gives him in return isn’t lost on Dean. He knows it’s one of Dean’s favorite thing. He knows what he’s doing.
-_-_-_-_-
The scent that hits him makes him growl, and it surprises even him.
“It doesn’t change the fact that what you and Michael are doing is wrong.”
“Here are your keycards,” the clerk says, interrupting his thoughts as she hands him two cards. “I’ll need you to sign this form…” she slides it in his direction, “and you’ll be good to go!”
“Sleep’s always worth it,” Dean assures him as he hauls him up.
Thankfully, Adler doesn’t say anything when the first hint of Dean’s arousal permeate the air. It mingles with Ash’s aroused scent enough that Dean hopes Adler won’t be able to spot the difference once Dean’s gone.
“I’m not choosing between them or you, Dean, don’t make me—“
“Dean?”
He’s avoiding Dean’s eyes as he busies himself again, so Dean, in turn, avoids running his mouth.
Castiel’s heart stops. “What?”
Uh. No. He didn’t, actually. “Yeah, of course.”
“Obviously not,” Cas finally looks at him.
Nothing is satisfying. Not his fingers, not his toys, not the shower head. Nothing. The heat in his belly should have abated by now, but it keeps building, and building, to the point of pain. Every orgasm feels like a firework that has been dozed with water as soon as it was about to explode, each one somehow less satisfying than the last.
“Yeah I got that.”
Dean’s interest perks up again, because in the small amount of seconds it took Dean to actually think about this, his anger fucked off to God knows where, replace only by curiosity.
So he swallows the anger and the hurt rising inside him. He can be the better person.
Castiel blinks at that, unable to react any other way. “Inappropriate?”
“I mean not working. I want some time so we can… chat. Or…” he trails off.
At first, Dean walks around the block a few times, visibly fuming, and heads for the nearest bar. He sits inside for ten minutes, sipping on a beer with a furious look on his face, and takes his phone out. Castiel, hidden on the other side of the street, in the shadows, thinks he’s going to get a call any second. Dean hesitates, toying at his phone. Then he starts typing a text. Satisfied, Castiel is willing to leave it at that, if what Dean is sending him resembles an excuse.
This time, it’s Cas who’s naked, and Dean who’s somewhat still dressed. He’s removed his shoes and socks, but kept his pants on, for now.
“My mother. At Christmas. I leave you two alone for five minutes and next thing I know you’re gone and I don’t hear from you for almost a month.”
Cas hums.
“What do you think?” Balthazar half-laughs. “I want a piece of that sweet little thing’s ass again. I’ve never had anyone so feisty before.”
Dean watches as Cas’s eyes widen comically before he catches himself and takes the final steps toward Aaron, extending a hand.
“I didn’t have any left,” Dean answers, letting his head fall against his pillow. “And before you ask, no, I couldn’t buy more.” He hesitates, but he’s pretty sure Cas is going to ask him about taking time off work at some point, so he’d rather get his lecture now and get it over with. “I’m out of a job.”
“Cas? Please talk to me. You need to wake up, now. Come on!”
Humming, Victor pulls out the pictures from the last crime scene they uncovered. Same M.O. Plus, the victim’s type is consistent with all the murders they’ve been following around the country. But this time it looks… personal, somehow.
He helps setting the table. They don’t look at each other for a little while.
His hands are fisting the sheets, like he’s still not sure if he’s allowed to touch.
“This… doesn’t look like your usual teenage murder,” Pamela lets out, thoughtfully as she chews on some gum.
“Yeah,” Dean snorts. He points to himself, “Case. Point.”
“Well, I’ve got something better.” Dean teases, winding the phone cable around his finger. “Sam’s out of town. All the way in California, actually.”
“Fuck you!”
Novak nods, seemingly satisfied. “Get ready. I’ll take care of your card and then we can begin.”
“You don’t have to feel responsible,” Cas answers, cupping his cheek. “I weighed the pros and cons. You were a big perk, but it’s not all on you.” He smiles, confident. “I chose this. For me.”
“I was struggling because I am attracted to you, Dean,” Cas goes on.
Dean’s more than unimpressed. “What did you do?”
“You know what.”
“Dean has been harassing me for weeks, you both apparently fomented an evil plan to get me home earlier, so here I am.”
Gabriel has his head thrown back, mouth open in ecstasy as he lets out grunts and pants of pleasure. “I’m, I’m your slut, I’m your—Please, Michael!”
, Castiel wants to say. But of course, they’re not close enough that he can compliment Dean every time he feels like it. Especially like this, for nothing. For the pleasure of making Dean happy.
“Doc? We’re here!”
She busies herself again, emptying a creamy looking soup into a fancy plate.
Ever since Sam came back from his trip to California, Dean is living in a cloud of denial.
God. This is awkward. Hot, but awkward.
Novak’s gaze is cold when it lands on him. “Schedule us. Or leave. Your choice.”
“Alright,” he huffed, “next time you’re being a bad boy you’ll get a spanking.”
Cas sit half an ass cheek on a corner of his desk, folding his hands together in his lap. “You seem preoccupied lately.”
“Just the three we—you selected,” Dean answers, refraining from rolling his eyes. He’s only gave the Doc his unwanted opinion, after all, not like he helped pick them. At all. “Andrea Kormos, 25, Omega. You wanted to pair her with Roy Olson, 32, Alpha. Third one is Gilda Farrah, 26, Alpha. Are we only doing young people?”
“He didn’t tell you? Oh, Dean…” she sighs, rolling her eyes.
“Agreed,” Dean says as he catches the pillowcase Cas throws at him. “But, um, don’t you think we ought to find some patients and maybe a bit of dough before we make the place presentable?”
Yeah, Dean knows. But Amelia has become a friend in his mind, and he can’t help thinking that if this was really entirely for science, he wouldn’t be as uncomfortable about it.
“Okay. Cause we can’t talk here?”
This book doesn’t give Dean any clue on where to start to get Cas back either.
Zachariah smiles wider, relishing Dean’s anger. He throws Dean’s notebook on top of the scarf.
“Don’t say that. You had an opportunity and you took it; The fact that he took advantage of the situation doesn’t mean it’s your fault.”
Disappointment is clear in Dean’s expression and Castiel feels bad. But Dean doesn’t get it. Castiel wants to do this. He wants to do it properly.
Dean huffs a laugh. “Pretty much.”
He doesn’t know what happiness is. He’s striving for it, but maybe it’s just a myth. Contented is good enough in his book.
He’s strangely angry all of a sudden. All he wanted was to have a nice chat, but of course Cas is going to turn it into an opportunity to show off his superior brain.
“We’re sorry to be the ones to inform you that Lisa Braeden died about three or four days ago,” Barnes lets out with a sigh.
It was hard enough to convince the staff to let him bring up a breakfast tray into his room –because apparently, “I’m going to woo my best friend,” is not a proper excuse to not use room service-- but now that he’s standing in front of said room, it’s even harder to get on with it and step in.
It’s like magic, when Cas looks at him this way. Dean can’t look away, even if it’s the millionth time they’ve done this, just staring at each other.
“You shouldn’t have let it affect you in the first place,” Novak answers.
His heart misses a few beats, the rhythm of it uneven, in a way that tells him it’s not just because he’s panicking. He looks up at Cas, letting the anxiety take over. He doesn’t give a shit if it shows. “Wh… what did you use? How is it…”
And, hey, Dean’s here to give a show, right?
If he’s honest with himself – and he’s been avoiding that for a while now – it all makes him immensely sad.
Dean laughed.
She steps away. The tension that had been building since they set foot in the kitchen is gone.
“No, Dean!” Aaron bursts. Okay. What the hell? “I want to spend time with you but when we do you’re distracted or you’re tired and we always end up like this!”
“I’m not going to fire you. You’re clearly distressed, this would be very insensitive of me,” Cas sighs, leaning back in his seat. The leather creaks. “Besides, you’ve been with me for a year, you pioneered the research with me, you’re effectively irreplaceable at that point.”
When he hangs up, he barely has time to remember what he was doing before the call that Martha is at his desk.
Except that it’s not. Because – and Dean won’t ever admit it out loud – Castiel Novak is one hot piece of ass. First off, Dean saw him running around campus one morning, when he came in early to finish some typing. Guy does this every day, according to the early staff. He must be built like a friggin’ tank. Not to mention those amazing baby blues of his. How can anyone stand to look him in the eye when he addresses them, Dean can’t fathom.
It’s a weird question, that Dean doesn’t really understand. He doesn’t think it’s that exceptional that they filmed in a gym and tried to add a little fantasy to their vid, but since he doesn’t want to look stupid, he just shrugs. “Sam is the one who came up with the idea. All we did was… act a little.”
Things will be okay.
But he doesn’t have time to say anything because Michael saw them coming in and he looks up, a shark-like smile illuminating his face. “Cassie!”
Dean sighs. “What if you did. Would you want a kid? A family, with Amelia?”
“I changed my mind.”
Adler stops fidgeting with them, and Dean takes the opportunity to reattach the ones he pried off. “I know it’s not easy the first time, okay,” he says as he works. “And our friend here,” he points a thumb at Ash, “might be a bit intimidating, since he’s more used to it than you are. But,” he interrupts when he sees Adler open his mouth to protest. He pushes him down, until the Doc is sitting on the bed again. “We’ll get through this. It’s for science, right?”
Dean can’t believe his ears. Isn’t there one person in this fucking city who’s not shitty? Really?
Cas sighs, clearly annoyed at Dean’s shyness, but doesn’t argue. This time, it’s Dean who shamelessly ogles him as he removes his clothes. Cas hesitates briefly once his chest is bare, but it doesn’t last long, and soon his pants and shorts fall on the floor.
Dean looks around out of reflex, to make sure nobody is going to see them, before he remembers that they’re allowed to do that. They’re both single. Both students. They can date if they want.
“No,” he answers. “We started this chapter,” he looks down at his text book, and Dean’s happy to see that he’s a bit regretful about that, “if I don’t finish it I’ll have to start all over again.”
“You haven’t been notified, yet?”
Dean sits on the arm of the chair, close to Castiel.
“Fucking Christ,” Victor whispers.
“What about work?” Cas asks, popping a fry into his mouth. “How are you reconciling the two?”
He’s not really into Omegas, as it is, but he’s been so horny for so long that anything will do. Besides, Ash has a dick, which is Dean’s favorite thing in the world when it comes to sex, so he can’t complain too much.
Speaking of the Devil, Cas just entered the cafeteria, and Dean sees his frown from afar when he spots Adler with Dean and Charlie. He strolls purposefully to their table.
“Then what?”
He couldn’t help but cry out when Cas leaned back, his hands finding the mattress behind him. And shit, shit, Dean was so not ready for this. As he rolled he hips around, Cas let out a satisfied laugh.
So that’s it, huh? Cas wants him there to act as buffer between him and his mother?
“Are you okay?”
Dean is half-naked, too. His mom doesn’t like it either, but it’s for another reason. When Dean gets sun, freckles start to bloom on his skin.
“Well, Dean is part of the family,” Amelia answers as she grabs a plate.
“There,” Cas lets out in a sigh.
Dean smiles at the words. He’s so proud of his brother in this moment, he can’t even put it into words. “That’s just the basic info we gather from them. Then we… observe. Them.”
“At what age did you present?”
“You like it.”
He doesn’t think Aaron would force him to do anything, but he would probably get tired of waiting. Dean doesn’t want Aaron to leave him. He needs him, especially now that he’s resolved himself to never touch Cas again.
“Please, Cas, you can’t do this…”
Dean hums in answer, sending a spark of pleasure up Castiel’s spine. He feels it pool inside his lower belly. His heart is beating like crazy, half out of excitement, half out of fear of getting caught. He’s not going to hold on much longer.
This stops Cas, who was nibbling at Dean’s lower lips. He pushes back a little, so they can look at each other. “And?”
“He asked me to meet his parents,” Balthazar answers with a grimace. “Can you imagine?”
The beeping gets faster. Charlie and Dorothy are kissing, one of Dorothy’s hand is sliding down Charlie’s body to finish its course between her legs.
There are a few seconds of silence, a fleeting moment during which Castiel wonders if the game is over, if Dean is going to want to go to sleep now. Castiel wants to tell him his secret. His heart starts beating faster, but he doesn’t dare open his mouth.
Granted, he looks uncomfortable, but maybe it’s just because it’s strange for him to be nice to people. He’s just not used to it. That’s it.
Seven fifty-one. Nine minutes to go.
If Aaron notices the not-so subtle change of subject – and he most certainly does judging by the look he gives Dean – he doesn’t comment on it.
“We still need to figure out what we’re going to do to raise funds.”
But of course this would mean telling Cas why he bailed at Christmas. And he can’t do that. He thinks it would kill Cas, or break him.
He’s nervous, a bit sheepish too, but, mostly, he’s excited.
Dean is very happy to be sitting next to Cas, who’s himself sitting at the head. Dean also has Amelia in front of him, but he’s less happy that Naomi is in his line of sight. On his left is the old guy’s wife, of course, and at the other end of the table, the old guy. It’s a wonder Naomi didn’t put up a fuss just to be sitting there herself.
“Sorry.”
Finally, after what feels like long minutes, Cas turns his head toward Dean. His eyes have trouble finding Dean’s, but of course Dean doesn’t blame him.
There’s nowhere too far to go, anyway. The kitchen’s just there, and Cas starts rummaging through the cupboards. He takes out a glass, fills it in the sink, and brings it to Dean. The bag disappeared.
He’s the one avoiding Dean’s eyes this time, but it doesn’t stop him from pushing Dean, until he can take his place.
“Mr. Winchester was… very well acquainted with her,” Henriksen finishes for her.
“Jesus…”
“How long have you known him?” Castiel frowns. He knows it’s not what he wanted to ask, but the words escape him without his permission. “Don’t you know the name of the man you’re having sex with on a regular basis?”
“Does Cassie know about it?”
“You feeling a little better,” Dean asks as Cas leans back against the tiles, eyes closed.
Aaron’s mood gets better as they eat. He still seems genuinely tired, but at least they’re chatting.
“Dean,” Castiel groans. His head drops on his chest.
And, yeah, the way he insists, the confused frown on his brow finishes to piss Dean off.
Wiping the sweat of his palm on his knees, Dean squeezes Cas’s cheek. “I… I don’t even know what you’re talking about,” he shakes his head, “Cas! Snap out of it!”
He cuts his inner rambling short when he comes back to his office, and Dean is not there yet. A quick look at his watch tells him it’s eleven minutes past eight. Dean should be here. He’s late, and Castiel’s heart sinks in his chest.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
“I need them to hire a new secretary. One just for my study.”
So Dean pushes down.
“People’s reaction sometimes baffle me,” Cas admits.
He takes it, cautiously, and rolls it between his fingers. “What’s this?”
Dean complies, sitting up and stretching his arms in the air.
He quickly knocks on the door once he’s there, but doesn’t wait for an answer to come in. Sylvia, Graham’s personal secretary, looks up at him, a welcoming smile on her face. She pushes the call button on her own intercom.
Aaron looks troubled, a little bit worried.
“I do care,” Cas says. “Why is it so difficult to accept?”
Dean searches his face for a sign that Cas has gone mad. That’s he’s gone religious or something, because what he’s saying doesn’t make sense. “No, Cas, we’re smart! You’re smart! And your mom’s rich now that Michael’s dead, right? If you ask maybe she’ll pay for a lawyer or something. We can get out of this, don’t you see?”
“Yes.”
The Doc mumbles something that vaguely sounds like an apology inside Dean’s neck and rolls over. “Resolution.”
His missed working full-time with Cas, but with his classes he can’t do that anymore. So, obviously, he should tell Cas to tell Graham thanks but no thanks, because he can’t.
“You had sex in the back of her car?” Novak asks, looking up.
“Uh huh. Had a cold.”
. The one feeling he relishes.
Gabriel turns to his computer again, frantic now, and the video starts before Castiel is ready. His body turns cold, and he’s frozen in place, unable to look away.
“I don’t need someone to fuck me to know they’re a good person,” Dean answers.
Dean shakes his head. “Alright. Well, I’d be happy to see you outside of work. You know, as a… a…”
Dean doesn’t know where to look. He wants to admire his Alpha watch, but also stare at Cas’s beautiful face. It’s so rare to see him smile like this, honest and truly happy. He’s glowing.
Novak is staring at him when he looks up.
“You sure?”
Dean sighs. He’s two hours past the time he should’ve gone home, and even though there’s no study session tonight, he’s still here, typing notes about Novak’s first discoveries.
“Can we ask you some question,” she asks.
Beside, would it be that terrible to just work his way up in another hospital, saving for the Clinic as he does? Even if it takes a while, at least he wouldn’t be hurting anybody anymore.
Dean hopes so. Everybody’s gonna see his dick.
“Thanks. I try.”
“Gone?” Dean doesn’t understand. “Gone where?”
Dean looks up, brow creased in worry. “Is that okay?”
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, running a hand on his face, “Yeah. Sorry.”
Dean doesn’t have any mental capacity left to read anything on anyone’s face, anyway. He’s just so fucking scared and he’s going to be late, and he has to see what time it is. His heart is hammering against his ribcage and the anxiety is spilling through his chest and his limbs and his mouth and his eyes and his everything.
He actually wants to cry this time when the automatic thoughts of ‘
“I ask for the money first, in exchange for my guarantee that they’ll be pregnant by the end of the year.”
But it comes out weak, like he can’t even convince himself. Cas keeps smiling sadly and reaches for him, urging him to come closer. Patiently, he waits, until Dean can function again, can get past the choking sense of despair that creeps over him.
Dean closes his mouth. He blinks, once, twice, and Castiel can see the wheels in his brain turn. The only noises filling the hall are the voices of their classmates and teachers outside, echoing in the building.
“Doctor Novak, Sir,” he interrupts, and the Doc jumps slightly, turning to him. “I’m sorry I’m late. I wanted to finish filing the applications before I came.”
“Yes, Doctor,” Dean huffs, and tries not to acknowledge that in other circumstances, this could turn into a kink.
Castiel clears his throat. He doesn’t answer, because the truth is, he hasn’t made a decision about it just yet. Benny is a good candidate for the Study. The only problem is, he’s not a good candidate for them as objective observers.
,” Dean finally says.
A man’s voice, gruff and loud, resonates in the small basement. “Gabriel, what did we say?”
Dean hums, thoughtfully, as he reads. Some of those comments are verging on insulting, even though the authors seem to try to pay them a compliment. It’s weird, to be complimented on his masturbation techniques.
Aaron shakes his hand, pleased. “Really?”
“Yeah.”
Castiel likes it. “Dee,” he says, just to annoy him.
Dean shrugs, shifts closer to Cas. “Just want to let you bask in the afterglow for now,” he says, eyes roaming over Cas’s face, dropping every few seconds to his lips, he can’t help it, “we’ll see if you’re up to it after that.”
“See?” he goes on. “Waiting can be nice.”
Even in the yellowy, low light of his desk lamp – the light bulb in the lobby hasn’t been working since they came back to the Clinic – he can see Cas’s pupils getting larger and larger. He has that excited puppy look on his face that Dean’s gotten very familiar with during his last heat. His leg is twitching like he wants to bounce it. He keeps licking his lips.
Throwing him his exasperated bitch face, Sam raises an eyebrow, “I was hexed. Not my fault. And we haven’t been since. Dude,” he blows out a breath, “don’t you miss it?”
Ever since Dean’s been working with him again – it’s been almost three weeks – Cas has been nothing but nice.
Cas hums, but his whole body sags as he looks at his feet.
And he needs to sack up and knock on that friggin’ door.
So, two chapters in a row! I know! But the one before this one was very short, so I thought i'd give you more this time. Plus, I had a very crappy week (who said working in the movie industry was fun? It's only fun when you haven't been working for a while and don't remember the sleepless nights and the ungrateful directors who think they can give you shit when you're working for free *sigh*), so any comments, any little thought will be greatly appreciated. Thanks peeps!
Dean shakes his head, “Can’t turn this off at will,” he huffs, pointing at his head, “but if you can, please tell me how because—”
He really did
Of course, Cas was an ass at first, too. He might still be, but Dean is a little too biased to be objective on the subject.
As he thinks that maybe it would be a good idea to talk about it with someone, he realizes that he’s arriving at the hospital Cas works at. He wonders how he got there. He wasn’t even thinking about where he was going. But his brain seems to have known he needed to come here.
Taking a breath, he starts strutting again, down the flight of stairs that’ll take him in the room proper.
“Who said that?”
“Fuck her!” Dean burst.
He squeezes it, a bit too hard, and lube spurts out and starts oozing on the side.
“You couldn’t have used lubricant?”
Dean looks up, startled. The tears running down his cheeks are real, Cas knows that. He’s shaking, too. Out of fear? Disgust that Castiel is touching him, maybe?
“Hello?” Dean says in the receiver, slightly unsure.
“Alright, I think we can proceed to the next phase,” Cas says when he’s done writing. He’s out of patience, Dean clearly sees it in the turn of his mouth, and he wonders why. The first interview went very well, and this one would have been fine, if not for Dean freaking out.
“Don’t make me,” Dean says, suddenly hoarse. He hates that he can feel the tears coming, and that Cas can probably see them, “I can’t.”
Aaron nods, “Right.”
“Okay.”
“Knees up,” Cas orders.
There’s only one way to find out. This is too important.
“Tell me your biggest secret,” he breathes, “something even I don’t know.”
“I was ready last week,” Dean bursts, scrambling to his knees. “Let’s go, come on!”
, to see. “You don’t have to.”
For the first time since he arrived, his shoulders relax, his jaw unclenches. The annoyance has dissipated as he ate, only leaving exhaustion and sadness in its trail.
“I lied,” Castiel says. “I didn’t want to ask right away. I didn’t want you to think I was only capable of talking about work.”
“Okay.”
This has Cas pause, and Dean thinks he’s gonna be okay for just a second there. But Cas stares and stares and he seems to see a lot more than Dean’s comfortable with.
Or, he does mind, if the frown that he wears sometimes after being solicited is any indication, but at least he pretends he doesn’t mind. It’s a rare thing, a strength of character that Castiel appreciates.
Cas raises an eyebrow. “You’re not working tonight?”
They can’t be friends, because their friendship started with sex, and it’s going to end with the absence of it.
He gathers his plate, then Sam’s, and heads for the sink.
“Don’t tell me, I know. It’s the money, isn’t it? You’re thinking that three practices is a lot of work. A lot of investment. A lot of brain power. Am I right?”
“Are you going to repeat everything I’m saying?”
Dean opens his eyes, looking up as he keeps sucking. He starts bobbing his head, and Castiel feels his balls get tight under the weight of that look.
He’s so sick thinking about it. He doesn’t know if he’ll be ready come Friday. He has to, though.
“Yes, it’s good to meet you, too,” She beams as she pulls away, “finally!” She turns to Sam. “And you must be Sam!”
“They’ve been fucking since they’re…” Dean throws his hands in the air, “Christ, I don’t even know. Since they can remember, probably. Which brother do you think Gabriel will choose, huh? The one he’s in love with, or you?”
“Oh.” Cas blinks, and a pleased, smug smile illuminates his face. “I would be honored to give him a tour of the lab.”
He should call Dean, at least to tell him what’s been going on. Maybe pay him a visit.
Gabriel throws his head back, panting,
And he wants Cas. So bad. He’s tired of fighting with himself on this.
Dean raises his eyebrow at him, questioning, but the damn kid just shrugs and skips to the couch.
But maybe that’s why it’s so nerve-wracking. Maybe it’s because things are going too well, and Dean’s anticipating the moment the other shoe is going to drop. Either that, or he’s scared of getting rejected, because this time he actually knows he wants to do this. Badly. Get an actual degree. Wouldn’t that be neat?
He wants Cas for himself. He’s tired of always putting the needs of others before his own.
Dean can’t do that. He doesn’t want to be Cas’s side omega. He wants an actual life with Cas, and he wishes he could keep her as a friend, but that’s impossible.
He keeps pushing his cart, slowly, until he reaches them. Dean’s smile falls when he sees Castiel, and the woman just gives him a curious, polite look. He smiles his brightest, for strangers smile.
The Doc’s sitting on the close lid of the toilets, rubbing his eyes with one hand while the other one lays limp across his knees, holding precariously onto his glasses.
,” Benny answers in his usual southern drawl. Dean almost melts on the spot. He missed the fucker! “
“Can I think ab—”
“Let me. You’re shit at talking to people.”
What she’s saying seems impossible and far-fetched but somehow it rings true, and she knows. Or is it one of her games? Is she bluffing so she can push Dean out of Cas’s life?
It takes slightly too much time for Dean to curb his nervousness enough to slide the key into its lock, which Cas notices. He’s not being smooth at all, and his hands are shaking. Thankfully, Cas doesn’t say anything and just follows Dean inside once the door is open.
And now that Dean’s acquainted with Amelia, well… Castiel won’t blame him for being thorough in his search for absolution.
There’s no need to talk after that. Dean has to focus not to shake, and he’s glad he’s not wearing any wires, right now.
They have a place, and between the furnishing and the legal mumbo jumbo they have to get through to make it Cas’s own practice, it takes them two weeks and a half and they’re good to go.
His job is bad – he has to share his office with his secretary, for Christ’s sake! – he barely sees any patients, and his colleagues are pigs. Beside this, Amelia is getting colder and colder, and now he has to entertain his mother.
Adler keeps eating, and for a time Dean thinks he won’t answer. But as he chews, his eyes find Dean’s again, and Dean can see that something’s change.
“So, we need to know what your favorite positions to reach orgasm are. Alone, and with another person. This will allow us to compare your usual habits with what we’ll ask you to do.”
Self-conscious, again, he takes it from Cas, and pretends to read what’s on the bottle.
She gives him a sad smile, reaching for his hand. When she squeezes it lightly, Dean’s heart skips a bit. God, how can he sit here with her when he spends all of his time, and hers, with her husband? Delighting in it, even, knowing the Doc should be at home, but he chooses to stay with Dean, and being pleased with that? How fucked up is he that he’s glad the Doc doesn’t seem to love her as much as she loves him?
“Hm-hm.”
It’s a fine word, ‘pursuit’. It fits his life well. It’s like he’s been chasing his dreams, chasing his desires, chasing his future, the one he envisioned for himself, but it all keeps running away from him.
“I want you at your desk at 8,” he answers, waving Winchester out.
“Shh, Cas. You’ll like it, I promise.”
“Something dangerous for my career. For your job security. Maybe something illegal.”
It’s kind of fun to watch Cas do his thing, though. To see how comfortable he is, how his persona changes in front of the camera. Yes, Dean’s really curious to know how it all started.
Die, yeah, Dean knows. It seemed like a good idea a few hours before, but now, as it’s staring right into Dean’s face? Not so much. “No. We’ll find something.”
“He’s not with us anymore,” she goes on. “So… how do I… how does it work? To make it good, I mean?”
He stands up so suddenly that Dean, not ready to let go just yet, is pulled out of the chair with him as Cas turns around. He has no choice but to follow.
Dean could cry from how relieved he feels. “What is it? What can I do?”
An unbidden moan makes its way out of his mouth as the heat of Cas’s mouth engulfs the tip of his dick. His tongue circles the head, and Dean starts leaking slick again.
“Yes. Accurate way of describing… whatever just happened,” the Doc says.
There are no pictures of Father around, anyway. Nothing to remind the family of him. It’s like he never existed. So, in a way, Castiel doesn’t really care. He can’t miss what he doesn’t know.
“I, uh, actually am part of the team?” Dean tries, and he doesn’t know why he makes it a question. “Doctor Novak’s team. Not that there’s a lot of people working on it. Just Ca—Doc Novak. And me. I’m the secretary.”
“Man…” Sam shifts on his feet. “I don’t know what to say.”
A video. Friggin’ porn, that’s what Cas had in mind. Not that what they did on the cam website wasn’t porn, but it was live, and once it was over, nobody would see any trace of it ever again.
He opens the passenger door. “Goodnight, Cas.”
“Cassie!” She exclaims, eyelids fluttering under the force of her anger.
And with that, there’s nothing much left to say. Dean guesses Cas is gonna want to drive him home now, and Dean can’t. He can’t face Sam.
Dean just gives a wave, too tired to attempt a proper goodbye, and leaves Cas’s office.
At that, Cas rolls his eyes. “It’s just sex, Dean.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Cas asks quietly.
The performative smile is suddenly back on Naomi’s face. “We were just having a little chat.”
But this feels good. He feels better than he has in months. Of course, he’s sad to be leaving this job, but there’s something telling him it’s the right thing to do.
He goes to bed.
And oh! Oh, Jesus Christ, now Cas is licking directly on the spot, sucking on it. Dean stuck between discomfort and arousal, if he’s honest.
This is both unexpected, and not. They both had a great time the last time Cas came to Dean’s apartment. This feels like an extension of that.
With a sigh, he follows.
He can’t have that on his conscience. Besides, his own life would be ruined too. He doesn’t want to think about what it would be like.
Cas rolls his eyes, “Unbelievable.”
He doesn’t know what to do but his brain is disconnected now, fear has taken over and his mouth is moving before he can do anything about it.
“Makes sense.”
Gabriel’s smile disappears, and he slowly turns around. “Sorry, Mikey. But we were meeting our new neighbors.” He forces a smile on his face, and clasps Dean on the shoulder. “This is Dean.”
“Oh, God,” he breathes aloud.
“Is this a date?”
Cas gives him a look that says all the good he thinks of Dean’s explanation. “To sum it up crudely,” he says.
Dean huffs a small laugh before coming to rest on the car next to the Doc. “So. Where are you meeting this Doctor Graham?”
“You’ve been cleaning the same spot for half an hour,” Ellen tells Dean, popping up from the liquor reserve.
Dean raised an eyebrow. Cas’s voice was insistent, almost angry, and it was incredibly hot.  He cleared his throat, putting one knee on the bed to get closer, and to relieve his rapidly growing erection with a bit of friction from his pants.
Dean pushes the glass door to get inside the clinic, and realizes with great dismay that it’s almost colder inside than it is in the stairway. The heaters seem to be on, but it smells like burned rubber, which has him guess that Cas just turned them on not long ago.
Dean would love to tell him that maybe actually talking to his wife and telling her how he really feels would diffuse the situation, but of course he’s aware that Cas wouldn’t listen to that advice.
He’s hurting Aaron, too.
Dean huffs. “I don’t know. Partners?”
Castiel feels alive again. After what happened with Rhonda, he felt like there was no space inside of him for anything but a quiet, distant satisfaction. But now, oh! Now he’s on fire. He’s so hard the zipper of his jeans is digging into his erection. Seeing Dean like this, out of breath, lips red and swollen from their kiss, it makes his blood boil.
He spent a lot of time on his phone, too.
“No, Grace,” Dean chimes in, sounding way more excited than he should be. He wraps an arm around Castiel’s shoulder, “We’re
dying.” And Dean opens his mouth at that, but Cas raises a finger in the air, silently asking for more time. “In any case, I just woke up, so please, if you have something to say, don’t beat around the bush and just get it out.”
Dean eyes Cas’s cock, he can’t help it. Cas gives it a long, tight stroke, from the base to the top, squeezing out a single drop of come that slowly but surely slides down the shaft.
“Where are we going?”
Dean huffs a laugh and finally stands up. “Looks like you’re doing fine to me.”
Now they’re going all the way. All of them.
Castiel’s mother gives him a questioning look, but he doesn’t let anything show on his face. Instead, he stands, mumbling a small “I’ve got it,” to Amelia as he exits the living room.
“It doesn’t look like I have a choice, anyway,” Dean finally says. He leans back, then. “Alright. We’ll do it. What’s on the agenda?”
Adler nods, almost in a daze, and bends over. Dean pulls away as Ash’s and Adler’s lips touch. Ash’s hand surges up to the back of Adler’s head.
“Yeah. I think I need some time to… I don’t know. Say goodbye.”
“Don’t--” Castiel stops himself, eyelashes fluttering shut under the shame, “Please don’t remind me.”
“Your education was probably not up to the standards of—”
The kid, Dean, smiles shyly. “Hi, Cas,” he says, and he sounds just like an adult. He’s all serious, and he reaches out with his hand, waiting.
Well. He actually is vibrating out of his skin, waiting for the other shoe to drop. So he doesn’t understand how Cas can look so calm. He wants to ask, but Sam’s been here ever since Cas knocked at the door last evening, and Dean’s not about to have this conversation in front of his brother.
She sighs, “
God, where’s that waitress?
Dean wants Aaron, he can’t deny it. He likes him, and he likes kissing him, and he’s curious to see what having sex with him would be like.
“Hm?”
“Well,” Cas smiles, “there you go.”
It’s a small victory to see Cas lick his lips as he prepares to speak first.
“You’re scared they’ll say you’re a fag.”
Dean’s next laugh is close to a sob. He sniffs. “I know.”
“They already think we sleep together, yes,” Cas interrupts. “So that’s not a problem, is it?”
“DON’T LIE TO ME!”
“Are you sure?” Cas whispers after a few seconds
He’s being silly.
He’s stopped licking away at Dean though, which is a good start.
Nothing turns up. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Bumpkiss. Diddly-squat.
With that, Dean nods, satisfied, and goes back to bed.
“He said--” Dean starts, and has to stop again. He swallows. “Cas… said—he said some things. About me. He, he told me he l—he loved…” the word is whispered, because he’s scared of it. He doesn’t know what it means. “Me. Loved me.”
God, he doesn’t have anything anymore. He’s going to throw up.
He’s not alone, he has to remember that.
------
Silence. Then, loudly, “
“You’re the only one who makes me feel happy,” he whispers, barely audible. “You. And Sam.”
“I—I don’t know.”
At least this is an entertaining start to Dean’s day. He could almost forget about Graham.
“Tell them thanks, but no thanks,” he says, standing up.
He steps outside of the kitchen to try and find some peace in the living room, but she follows him, furiously shaking her dish towel at him.
“Tonight I’m going to fuck you,” he blurts out, overwhelmed by the need to do it as soon as the words pass his mouth.
“You did that, already,” Dean squints, “besides, the Johns wouldn’t be in the know, so from an ethical stand point, anything related to them couldn’t be used, and, also, you know, the girls might have trouble stirring them in the right direction more often than not.”
Hence Dean’s suspicions that this is anything but friendly. They’re having a romantic night out. And Dean doesn’t know how he feels about that.
“Right. So interview, then a tour of the lab if the candidates are suitable. Anything else?”
“No, Cass – tee – ell,” Castiel repeats. He hates when people don’t get his name right.
One thing that troubles him, though, is that it shouldn’t matter what Dean thinks. It’s not like Dean has a degree of any kind. He hasn’t even finished his high school education. If Castiel were to give weight to his opinion, it would just hurt Dean in the long run. Other doctors, health professionals and all the people that matter won’t ever take him seriously. He can’t let Dean get used to this.
Once they reach Dean’s hotel, at Dean’s insistence that he wasn’t ready for them to sleep in the same bed just yet, Castiel starts realizing what Michael threatened him with. On impulse, he unclicks his seatbelt, bolting from the car, and take a very much needed breath of air. His eyes start watering. He’s shaking badly and he can do nothing but look at the sky, hoping the tears won’t spill.
He can’t focus, now.
“I’ve seen the video,” Sam lets out, avoiding Dean’s eyes.
Castiel can hear the slight reproach in her question, but pretends he doesn’t. She can’t understand the work, so he never even tried to explain. She would probably be so scandalized she would involve Castiel’s mother in this to convince him to stop, and he can’t have that.
God, this is what was missing from their little dinner together the other day. Cas was really not here to get into Dean’s pants. He was here to work.
“What did she say?” He pleads, more gently than he ever was.
Castiel sighs. He won’t smile. He’s just tired, is all. There’s nothing endearing about Dean Winchester.
Castiel can’t say he’s good at reading people over the phone. But he knows Dean, and that heavy pause sounded oddly like startled hurt. Almost like jealousy.
Castiel laughs quietly. “Only you would think so.”
He can’t deny that the number of comments and ‘Likes’ is impressive. There’s a shit ton of them. No way he’ll be able to read them all. He’s flattered, in a way, and it lights the now-familiar fire under his skin, the one that simmers inside him every time he thinks of Cas, and him, and the camera…
“Hello?”
Dean blinks, slowly putting down the menu. He doesn’t know what to say.
“Sure.”
“I have to since you won’t at least tell me when you think I’m doing good. Someone ought to from time to time…” Dean retorts, and Cas snorts. “Listen, we’re not gonna get any more guinea pigs here. You know it, and I know it. I mean…”
“Yeah.”
With a sigh, Dean looks down at his coffee. “I guess I’ll have to if I don’t wanna grow an ulcer before the end of the year.”
Dean huffs. “Of course I came!” He looks around, and Castiel sees he’s trying to make sense of it all. “Christ, Cas, you’re losing it! First Lisa and now this?”
If you think you can take it (and, let's be honest, if you like my brand of fucked up stories), then go ahead, and enjoy :D
Dean’s surprised, but he never says no to alcohol. Especially when it comes from here. Cas and Amelia never drink anything cheap.
Sam isn’t, either, ever since Dean told him he couldn’t drive him to school anymore, but at least Dean’s been able to come home a little earlier each evening, since they haven’t had any session since then.
Of course, Cas smiles again. Dean’s heart misses a beat, and an eerie feeling overtakes him, as if he’s in the space between a dream and reality, the moment where you wake up still believing that what you just dreamt is true.
I mean, like I said, we’ve been married for a while and even now, he never—” she bites on her lower lip before turning to Dean again. “I know this is awkward, but Dean, I actually… not lied, per say, but I, uh, I didn’t really want to talk about Naomi. I know she’s an old, stuck-up hag.”
Benny shrugs, “Well I like getting blowjobs, of course. Who’d say no to that?”
“See you on the other side,” Castiel breathes.
With careful movements, Cas slides the cushion under Dean, propping his butt up. He guides Dean’s leg, the one not resting on the bed, toward Dean’s chest, bending the knee delicately until it rests on the sheets at an angle.
Cas is beautiful like this, sprawled naked with his legs around Dean’s head, eyes closed and head thrown back as if in prayer. He’s breathing heavily, chest coming up and down in rapid succession. The pearls of come on his skin catch the light and seem to make him sparkle.
Dean raises his head. “What?”
Sam’s shoulders lift, slowly, like he wants to shrug but isn’t sure it’s the right emotion to feel. “Telemarketing?”
“Did you get that?” Novak asks.
Cas hums, then huffs. He raises a hand weakly, and very dramatically gives Dean a thumbs up, eyes still closed.
“I am looking for jobs.”
And each and every time, Dean’s whole body seizes with a bolt of pleasure so fierce it blinds him, zapping through his whole body as if each bout of ejaculate is drawing another orgasm out of him.
Cas gives him a puzzled look. “It’s going to be hard for you to reach between my legs like this, don’t you think?”
The Doc rounds the corner and enters the office like a furious hurricane, and Dean’s absolutely not ready for it.
Castiel sighs into the receiver. “Amelia’s having a girl’s night.”
Then why does he look so happy, Dean wonders, when he knows this is a very bad, very dangerous thing? They can’t afford to be renowned anywhere, let alone in the porn industry! Who knows who could see them? Or what creatures?
Another sob tears itself out of his throat. Taking a deep breath, he tries to calm down. The dizziness is getting worse, so he knows he’s almost there, but he wishes the poison would work faster. He doesn’t want them to come in and separate him from Dean before he dies. He can’t let them take Dean away from him in his last moment.
And anyway, Aaron’s probably in class, and Dean doesn’t have the number to his landline if he isn’t. He’s not about to call the school’s desk to ask Aaron to come fuck him through his heat.
Dean raises an eyebrow at him.
He’s so exhausted that the thought barely has time to cross his mind before he falls into a dreamless sleep. He needs it.
The Doc doesn’t need to be told twice, and he starts moving in earnest. Not too fast, at first, and it’s like he’s holding back, for fear he’ll break Dean.
Today is Saturday, and he has the day off, thank God, because Cas has been in a pretty great mood. He said, and Dean’s only quoting here, that, “with all the good job that you did, you deserve an entire weekend to yourself, Dean. And I do too.” So who’s Dean to contradict that, huh?
He doesn’t want to.
“Whatever excuse you’ve got prepared, Dean, you don’t need it. If you don’t love Cas this way, I won’t be mad. I don’t even think Cas will be mad. And if you do, I definitely won’t be mad,” Sam smiles, “I’d be happy for you. Cause we’re getting him back, okay? That’s not a question. He deserves to live a life free of Chuck. Out of all of us, he’s the one who suffered the most from it.”
And the hours are awful.
“Even if I did something like the fire thing again?”
“You really think he would?”
The first hour or so goes great. Dean achieves nothing, but by the end of it he feels a little less tired and a little bit more coherent.
Cas doesn’t let the discussion distract him though. He keeps stroking Dean gently, honing in on the center of Dean’s rim.
They pull away at the same time.
He’s never asked for this, Cas is the one who came to find him first.
“Dean. Are you… are you alright?”
, giving Cas a small, warm smile like nothing’s wrong. Then, without another word, he hauls his laptop with one hand, grabs his coffee with the other and hurries out of the room.
He licks another stripe up Dean’s cock and catches the tip between his lips. As he does, he pushes his thumb against Cas’s hole. Not enough to penetrate, but just enough that Cas hisses. Letting Cas’s dick pop out of his mouth, he looks up. Cas has his eyes firmly closed, but his body has released some of its tension.
So yeah, it’s weird. It’s like watching porno movies with your grandpa.
“I was mad,” she goes on. “In some ways, I still am. But,” she almost shrugs again, seemingly bracing against something. Or for something. “But you’re part of our life, now.”
Dean just has to believe him.
He was just starting to think he had the brains, too.
“And?” Dean asks, looking down at his hands as he undoes the last button.
“Who are you?” Cas asks, cold.
“Sure.” Dean closes his eyes again. “Well I think that’d be an interesting thing to study, anyway.”
“Can you finish a sentence without pausing every two seconds?”
“Gimme a second,” Cas mumbles when Dean tries to push at him.
Fuck, if Cas is good, then Dean can let go. Wrapping an arm around one of Cas’s knees, he bucks his hips in a violent rhythm, like he’ll die if he doesn’t.
“It’s really not.”
He stretches like a cat, both hands gripping one last time at Dean’s hips like he needs the support before sliding up to Dean’s chest. His thumbs graze Dean’s nipples, just a little tease, and he slides his hands down again.
Once the kitchen is finally spotless again, they both sit at the little kitchen table and enjoy a nice glass of gin.
Aaron stares at him again, and his mouth twists in a disgusted grimace. “See, you can’t justify his behavior. But you still insist on defending him.”
“Sorry,” he mumbles.
I do. God help me, I do like it. That’s why it needs to stop. It’s wrong, and it’s killing me.
Dean lets out a nervous laugh, and folds his legs under him, mirroring Castiel’s position. The bed springs creak ominously. “They really brought out the whole cavalry…”
Sam moved again, God knows when, and he’s not as close, now. He’s filming them so they’ll both fit in the frame, Dean thinks, so he dives his hand into his pants, squeezing his cock once, and running his knuckles on the flesh. The little bursts of pleasure course through his body, and for now they’re just enough to make him wait a little bit longer.
“I thought you didn’t want our relationship if it wasn’t official.”
Dean snorts, “You said ‘Please’.”
“Cas?”
“Sure?”
And he leaves.
Maybe all he needs to stop worrying is some sort of reassurance from Cas.
“What?”
“I’m working. Now please if you’re only here to bug me, please come back another time. I don’t have time for this.”
Something’s bound to happen.
Sam gets even redder. “N-no! No, I mean…” he huffs, takes a breath, “I just… I mean, you didn’t tell me and I wondered… are you really… together, now?”
The only reason Dean doesn’t look away or talk this time is because he’s trying really hard to prevent the heat he can feel in his insides from creeping up to his cheeks.
“No, I don’t,
He loves kissing Cas. The thing is, he never knows if it’s going to be welcomed. Every time they decide to have sex, it always starts so clinical.
“Okay,” Cas says.
“Good.”
“How is it going?” Cas asks much more gently than he ought to.
He doesn’t touch it, though.
He took a wrong turn at some point and he can’t understand when, or how to fix it. He’s lost and confused and his life seems more and more useless as days go by.
“Thanks, Sweetheart,” Benny flashes his brightest smile at her, and she turns around, satisfied.
-_-_-_-_-_-
“Oh, he’s
But as he steps inside the apartment, it hits him all at once.
Fuck, he doesn’t know what to do.
“What are you doing here?” Is the first thing Sam asks when Dean crosses the threshold of their apartment.
Turns out the beer was the only thing holding Dean together, because as soon as it’s out of his hand and on the floor, at the foot of the bed where Cas put it down delicately after taking another gulp, tears start pouring. “Fuck!”
Dean is furious. He would kill for a burger just about now. Even death row inmates have the right to a last meal. So he gets out, against Cas’s advice, with the firm intention to get something greasy to devour.
“What can I do for you?” Dean asks as he sits, because he has things to do and he doesn’t want this to last.
Cas sighs. “And you’re telling me this, why?”
That’s all it is.
“Not really… but you know, sometimes I would really like to… you know. Lead.”
“You wanna try again?”
How Cas recognized him with just a sound is beyond Dean, but he’s glad the Doc did. It gets a lot of explaining out of the way.
. And as this thought crossed his mind, he knew he didn’t really care.
“Your study hasn’t been approved,” Balthazar points out, “so even if I started shagging the whole HR department, you know that wouldn’t be possible.”
He rams it in hard, forcing Dean to close his eyes under the delicious force of it.
“Fine. I’ll listen.”
Of course he is. Dean watches porn almost religiously, so he knows. But,
he’s moving his arms in between Gabriel’s legs. In between his brother’s legs.
He huffs a small, wet laugh. “They’re so stupid,” He whispers into Dean’s ear. “I wonder how they even managed to find us.”
Cas lets out an offended grunt, but Dean ignores him.
“I could’ve managed on my own,” he says as they walk up the small steps to the lobby.
To give himself some courage, he runs a hand through his hair before letting out a decisive breath. The beer is still in his hand. He discards it on the nightstand, and cocks his gun. “Ready.”
“What do you think?”
“No. No, I know, just…” Dean sighs. Dammit, why is he arguing? He could be getting it right now. It’s been so long, and he really needs the relief, but somehow this doesn’t seem appealing. At all. He likes Aaron, what is wrong with him? “I just want to go home and crash,” he finishes. “Alone. Nothin’ against you, but I’m just—”
He can feel Cas settling above him, but they’re not touching. Cas is just staying right where Dean can scent him. Clever.
Surprised, Dean blinks at him. Cas seems very interested in what Dean is going to say, earnest as he is when he’s working. He seems sincere, at least.
He can’t believe he’s that sensitive to all this omega crap talk. Who is Naomi to him that she can humiliate him so completely with something he usually doesn’t give a shit about?
-_-_-_-_-_-
“You’re hurting me,” Cas whispers.
Dean can say nothing to that. In a daze, he goes back to his desk. He needs to think.
He wants to throw up.
There’s a snotty-looking clerk inside, a young guy – a student maybe? – sitting at a make-shift desk.
Of course, he’s not ‘watching’, so much as ‘observing’. Science has to be precise, of course, so using the right term for what he’s doing seems important as well.
“Shit, that feels good,” he breathes, because of course he can’t let silence linger for too long or it starts to feel awkward.
Cas nods as Dean tries to read the badge on her low-cut shirt. She seems to be part of the ceremony team, covering the event for the people watching at home.
From: Michael Milton (miltonm@adler.com)
Dean blinks. He’s just stepped with both feet in it, hasn’t he? “No?”
Dean blinks up at him, the sarcasm taking a little while to register.
Another annoyed sigh from the Doc has Dean straightening up. He takes a step inside the office, trying to appear professional so that Cas will know he’s not kidding around this time.
“It’s okay, Cas, it’s normal, it’s…”
Adler & Partners
“I miss our little chats. It’s one thing I don’t have where I work now. Someone to take my mind off things, sometimes to challenge me, put me back in my place. Despite what you might think, you’ are that person, Dean. And this is very interesting to me.”
“What about…” Cas says again when it’s clear Benny won’t answer anything. He reads his notes, and looks back up, “something you said about him having a ‘big mouth’? What does that mean?”
But Dean is taking his sweet time. Castiel just can’t wait anymore after that. He starts pacing his room instead, tidying up a bit, to keep busy.
“Great,” Cas smiles at him.
Now he’s crouching in front of Dean, pulling on his lower eyelid and looking his usual serious self.
That’s why he usually uses a toy with a suction base, so he can prop it up in the shower. At least he can use the weight of his body then, to make it acceptable.
Dean guesses he’s not used to people being so direct with him during sex. His pupils are fully dilated, Dean notes, and he bares his teeth despite the lack of pheromones exchange between them.
Nodding, Aaron pushes away from the car. “Alright. I’ll hold you to it, Winchester.”
“Are you ready?”
“It’s gonna be awesome,” Sam exclaims.
“Come on!”
Cas is an angel, a celestial being, surely this doesn’t mean what it would mean for a human.
With a tired sigh, he grabs a bit of sheet and cleans himself quickly. That done, he settles better against the cushy pillows, and finally takes Dean’s hand in his, bringing it to his chest.
Cas shrugs, “Sam?”
That asshole Adler. The fucking asshole!
Castiel can’t accept that. He can’t do that to Dean.
He takes another file from a drawer in his desk, hands it to Dean with a pen. He changes the tape in the recorder, making sure to label Dean’s first with ‘OM002’, and pushes the play and record buttons at the same time.
“Do you want to?”
It occurs to him that if he hadn’t lost his job two days ago because he snapped at a patron, he would’ve definitely lost it because of this.
Thankfully, Cas is back to fumbling with his hands, so Dean is pretty sure he didn’t notice. Something tells him it also means Cas wants to say something else. So he waits. And waits.
So in order to spend more time with Sam since he has to work twice as much these days, and to satisfy his little brother, he decided to take him to their new Clinic.
He’s stopped talking for too long. “Sorry. I was… somewhere else.”
“I can’t…”
“Dude, you’re totally taking control every time we have sex.”
Dean can do nothing but stare for a couple of seconds until his brain decides to function again.
And now they’re kissing, and Cas lets out a weird, interrogative noise at that.
“Cas…”
“Good,” says Cas when Dean rests his arms under his head.
“I have to admit something,” Cas whispers.
“I know because I found this place,” Dean sighs, exasperated. “And I’ve been careful. You saw how hard it is to get down here.”
“Are you being all dramatic again? Because Amelia and I were having fu—”
“Can you hold me while we sleep?”
Dean lets it fly over his head. The Doc’s voice, his presence. The beeping of the machines. Everything.
Cas barks out a laugh, his face quickly falling when he realizes Dean’s not laughing.
,” the journalist goes on. “
Cas lets out a long-suffering breath. “You said your penis hurts, you’re having painful cramps, and you described the sensation in your channel as ‘like throbbing fire’. Chaffing can only explain so much.” He gives Dean a stern look. “So please. You called me here as your doctor. Let me do my job.”
“You did.” Dean follows him. “Almost two months ago.”
Okay, Dean can’t shut up during sex. Sue him. But it’s been a while, and Benny is a really good fuck, and when Dean’s barely holding up, head on a pillow and ass in the air while someone plows into him like there’s no tomorrow, well… he kinda loses his mind.
“That too, yes,” Cas smiles up at him.
First, he checks what’s being watched at the moment, but nothing seems interesting enough. He goes through the categories, and clicks ‘blowjobs’. He’s in the mood for blowjobs, he thinks. Hovering his pointer over the videos, he watches the small previews with a feeling of boredom. He sighs. Hesitates.
Dean hesitates, only briefly, and steps forward. There’s a key sitting on the desk, a small, elegant one, attached to a plastic card that says ‘306’. Dean picks it up, turns the plastic around in his hand. It reads ‘Elysium Hotel’ on the other side. His heart drops inside his chest.
Oh. He didn’t realize how much he needed the contact until it was gone, already.
But Novak’s never been one to use vulnerability to get what he wants. His inner Alpha wouldn’t let him show weakness just for the sake of winning an argument. Sex isn’t important to him, that Dean can say he’s sure about.
Obviously, everything was going too well. Cas had to go and remind Dean of how much of an ass he is. Why wouldn’t he, now that he’s had what he wanted?
After the whole ‘checking Dean for injuries’ thing, he doesn’t need to add more lube. Dean’s ready and leaking so profusely he knows there’ll be a big stain on his mattress when they’re done, forever commemorating this moment.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
“Cas, what are you doing?”
Dean huffs a little laugh. This is it, then. They’re launching their first vid. God help them. “It’s taking a while…” he complains.
“Close your eyes.”
Novak swallows. “Where was that?”
He removes Gabriel’s underwear in one swift move, throwing them on the floor. Gabriel’s breath hitches when he runs his knuckles on his cock.
“You don’t have to ask my permission to see your friends.”
Castiel pouts. “I know. But still.” He chews on his lower lip, watching Dean poke at the toad with a stick of wood. “We’re thirteen, now. We can go to jail.”
“I think we need to make this quick if you want relief,” he says.
“They don’t have anything. There’s no reason to be scared, Dean, we—“
-_-_-_-_-_-
“Right. I need a second.”
“I told you this is not something I can discuss,” Novak answers. He’s angry, and Dean wonders how this evening is going to end. “So stop asking, Mother.”
“Okay.”
But now, he has to concentrate. He’s trying to prove a point, after all.
Thanks for the support!
“Alright,” Dean answers, skeptical.
This stings in a way that Dean couldn’t have anticipated.
Dean’s whole face starts to heat up. “I, uh. I guess I am.”
Focusing on his finger and mouth at the same time proves to be a difficult task, but when Cas whispers a broken, “Don’t stop!” Dean has to oblige.
Dean clears his throat. “Okay…”
Maybe he’s just tired, Dean thinks to himself. Maybe he doesn’t feel like smiling today.
“Um, yeah,” Dean breathes, eyes settling on his hands. Their hands. “Gimme a sec.”
“They won’t find us,” Castiel answers, casually. “This place is so remote it’s not even on a map.”
Not that this is all Castiel thinks about, of course. The quiet moment they spent together in Dean’s apartment was strange, but it was peaceful, and lovely. Cas wouldn’t mind doing that again. Being domestic with Dean.
Or it does, depending on who’s watching. What Dean’s seeing looks very good. He could almost bust out the popcorn.
Fisting his cock, he goes slowly at first. He lets it grow, let the butterflies in his belly multiply, and gather into his groin. Soon, he’s rocking up into his fist, and he knows it’s time to get to the real thing.
“Just out of a heat,” Dean breathes. “I guess I still have some remnants of—” he gasps when a fingers grazes his nipple.
She laughs again, “Well, thank you so much, Angel, Hunter, and see you at the ceremony!”
He needs this, goddammit!
At least Dean had the guts to tell him when he was being difficult just for the sake of it. And then they would argue. Blow up one good time, and go back to normal. It provided Castiel with an outlet for the constant anger that never seems to leave him.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, standing on the other side of the door, sweaty, covered in dirt and grime, and so, so real-looking.
The study is one of a kind. He wouldn’t find something similar with any other doctor.
“We’ve been over this. You like the science.”
Dean would be very angry at him for saying something like this, but the more time passes, the less Castiel has patience for her antics.
He can’t help it. He’s tried for the first few days after the Break Up to be his cheerful, normal self, but it turns out he’s never been cheerful to begin with, and overdoing it was just weird and exhausting.
“I thought it was clear,” Castiel answers.
Sighing at the Doc’s stubbornness, Dean lets his mouth run. For once, his brain almost warns him before he can say something stupid that he might regret. Almost. “Yeah, well, short of you n’ me, I don’t see who else.”
They can hear Charlie’s heavy breathing now, thanks to the boom they’ve installed inside the exam room.
“Nah. There’s something else.”
Castiel only raises an eyebrow at that, but Graham doesn’t see it as he’s already back at work on his letter.
He’s not scared to die, but Dean was right. They’re so very young. They had so many things ahead of them. But he can’t regret anything they did. He loved every single second of their twisted life together.
“But you’ve thought about it?”
“Funds. We can’t go on with no money!”
“You’re not walking home,” Aaron says.
“Not jealous in the way most people would see it. Let’s say my inner Alpha had claimed you as its own and it sees Benny as a threat. Which throws all objectivity out the window.”
“Don’t go on too many dates, then,” Dean snorts. “You’ll turn into a regular suburban husband if you’re not careful.”
“I… I don’t know. I want to be like you. I want her not to have so much effect over me every time she says something.”
He pushes his index finger in, just the tip for now, and makes a circling motion as he feels for whatever it is that he’s looking for.
“Dean, calm down,” Cas says, clearly alarmed and confused as he almost runs towards him and kneels next to his chair. “What’s wrong? What happened?”
“F-fuck,” Gabriel let’s out. Castiel suspects Michael added a second finger, but he can’t be sure. Things are a bit too dark to make out the details, thank God for small mercies.
Things suck.
“I’m starting my new job, I can’t afford to be late, alright?”
So, yeah. Catching up sounds like a great idea for now. This is not a date until someone says it is. And Dean definitely won’t say it.
“Gabriel,” Castiel hesitates as he sees there’s another video attached, “you don’t have to show m—“
“I’ve been… training,” Cas starts, “because people asked me to. On my website.”
There’s the noise of a chair legs scrapping on the floor, then wood creaking.
His answer is defensive, but Castiel was expecting that. “I want you to be comfortable. You’re an integral part of the team,” as much as it pains Castiel to admit that, but it’s true, so he swallows the remark, “and I need you to be focused when we work.”
So why would this Roy Olson be any different?
Yeah, Dean definitely doesn’t want to talk about that further. He pushes away from the couch, albeit slowly and a bit awkwardly. He’s still shaking.
Cas looks thoroughly fucked, as he ought to, and Dean’s sure he looks the same, if not worse.
Cas hums, rolls Dean’s lower lips between his teeth. When he leans back, he’s holding up the bottle of lube he’s been keeping in his pocket. High enough, and in a way that leaves no doubt he’s doing it for the camera.
“Charlie wants some time to think on it. I haven’t heard back from Dorothy, yet.”
“Alright. Hum… you might want to, huh, take the reins, then.”
With a sigh, Dean gets up. He can take his brother to visit a few universities. Sam’s smart, and he deserves it. And Dean will keep nursing his blue balls. Things will get better, eventually.
“Okay,” Cas breathes.
Don’t worry about it?
Dean’s hands are everywhere, holding Cas, keeping him sheltered from the world. It feels like his heart is heavy with pain, and regrets, and all he wants is to go back to that fateful day when he discovered his brothers were fucking.
“Thanks,” Dean whispers.
If Cas wants to spend his personal money on the Study, it’s his prerogative. Dean won’t stop him, especially if it means entering a new phase, because Dean is starting to get bored of doing the same thing over and over again.
His wires are all tangled on his chest. He takes the time to put them back the way they should be.
won’t feel staged. At all.”
Although, when Cas leaves again, it takes a while for Dean to start on anything.
And, right, Dean sees the passion in his eyes again. This is his life’s work, after all. Sometimes it could almost be funny how he forgets it involves sex. If it was anyone other than Dean, he wouldn’t say shit like this.
Dean doesn’t know if Cas wants children, they never talked about it, but preventing all contact with Amelia until he makes a decision and is a hundred percent sure he can commit seems like something he would do.
Maybe Benny just wants to preserve his anonymity?
“Plea—ease,” he sobs. “Cas, I can’t—”
“Sex is good,” Cas blurts out of nowhere.
He waves at his book on the kitchen table and at Dean’s whole living room like this explains everything.
“Okay… I don’t know. He knows what he wants, isn’t afraid to ask, you know?” And he goes back to Cas at that, because it must be a little bit awkward for him as well. “So I never thought to check.”
Cas eyes him from head to toe, considering him. “I don’t understand where all this anger is coming from.”
Sam waves at him, already focused on his laptop like Dean never said anything in the first place.
“Oh, God,” Sam finally stops laughing, wiping a tear off his eye. “I’m sorry. Must have been… hum. Awkward.”
He doesn’t know why but today, he’s really feeling the mood of that kiss again.
Since Dean’s currently unbuttoning his shirt, he wonders if he should pretend he didn’t hear.
It’s like the world is right, finally. The last piece has been found. The puzzle is complete.
The Doc glares at the shortening of his name, but doesn’t say anything. At least it got his attention.
It’s not that far, just a few doors down the corridor. Still, if Dean has to drag himself all the way over there for nothing he’s going to be pissed.
But not today.
He finds it weird to look at his wife. She’s beautiful, and he loves her, her quiet presence. But these days, she’s been more and more vocal about her unhappiness with their situation, and he doesn’t know what to tell her.
Castiel… the Doc just asked him for a fuck. Participating in the study. Together.
camera.
Cas’s eyes find his. Dean nods. “Yeah.”
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
It feels like it would be pointless. Or maybe he knows Cas would find a way to talk him out of going to college, and Dean wouldn’t be able to stop him.
Obviously, she wouldn’t.
“Yeah, no,” Dean laughs uncomfortably, “I don’t want to be a med student, maybe something more, hum… maybe less prestigious.”
“You mean he gets to come before I do,” Dean asks, taking position on the bench again. “Why?”
The half-erection he’s trying to tame down is only exacerbating the guilt.
He leaves the receiver for a second, grabs a chair, and sits, as quick as he can.
It took time for sleep to take him the night before. He kept thinking about what Cas said, over and over, until he was too exhausted to grasp a single thought. But now, he’s wide awake, and there’s definitely some thinking happening again.
Best video has been won, and they only have one more award to go through, plus the wrap-up cocktail party so that everyone can chat with the press.
Dean huffs a small laugh. Truth is, he acts cocky, but he’s about to actively touch the Doc’s cock for the first time, and he would lie if he said he wasn’t anxious. For the first time in a long while, he’s glad he’s taking suppressant.
Luckily, Cas was absent all morning, and he should be absent most of the afternoon. There’s nobody to tell him anything. He should really get a glass of water though. He’s just scared he’s going to puke it out.
“I—” Castiel starts, but stops himself.
So they go back to the ballroom. And if Cas lets his hand rest on the small of Dean’s back until they reach the balustrade, well, nobody has to know.
Dean doesn’t know what to do with that knowledge. He throws his arms in the air and let them fall hard against his sides.
, Dean thinks. He wonders where all of this mess is going to go now.
Except there’s a twist to their life. As soon as they got out of their town, they started killing together. Usually young, impressionable girls. They don’t care if they deserved it or not. To Castiel they did, at least. They’re all girls who hit on Dean. That’s their method to choose someone. They go into a bar. Castiel sits in a corner, and Dean leans at the counter. If someone comes and touches him, then she (or the occasional ‘he’) is the one who’ll get it.
He hopes Cas won’t see that he’s a bit bummed.
“The fire,” Dean insists. “I did it. On purpose. People found out and the firemen and policemen told everyone else. So the neighbors and the women at Mom’s book club wouldn’t talk to us anymore, and I wasn’t allowed to play with the other kids and stuff. The school didn’t want me anymore. So we had to move very far so nobody would know what I did.”
She sounds so excited, he can’t help but let out a laugh. Weak, but real this time.
“Come here,” Dean cuts him with a sigh.
Dean runs a hand over his mouth instead, thinking. When he finally looks up at Cas, he sighs. “The FBI is on our ass, Cas.”
“So,” he takes the menu from under Cas’s hands, “what’s good here?”
“Found a job that he could keep for the rest of the year. But he’d have to start now.”
Dean chuckles. “You can do this whenever and forever. And there’s no way I’ll ever be too old for this!”
Lucky for him, Cas changed his mind.
“We need to die.” The gravity of his sentence takes a while to settle into Dean’s brain.
Chuck deserves to be left alone here to rot, human and defenseless. Now, more than never.
“Don’t be. It makes me feel worse.”
“Can I come next time?” Sam asks, mouth full of Chow Mein.
He turns back to his house without saying goodbye, feeling like he’s out of his body. Dean stood him up. For a girl. It never happened before. Maybe Mary is right, and it’s just Dean’s hormones talking. Maybe Dean is not as different from others as Castiel thought. He feels empty. Angry. He needs to do something about it. He needs to see if Dean is really committed.
“I don’t know if you guys broke up or something, but if you really want to help, you’ll fix things. Whatever you have to do,” she insists, leaning over to him, almost begging him. “I want my husband back. And I want a baby. And you can give him what he needs otherwise. But please… I don’t want to be alone.”
Cas is pleased. He dips his head, pushing his glasses up his nose. “There was something else I wanted to give you but… I’m not sure how you would take it.”
“She… wants a baby. But her and Karl – that’s her husband – they’ve been trying for a couple of years now and nothing’s working. They’ve seen some specialists, but they didn’t seem to be any help. So I was thinking, since it’s your specialty… maybe you could do something for them.”
“You’re very welcome.”
’ that makes Dean a little uncomfortable, if he’s honest.
“There we go,” Dean whispers as he rings the doorbell to Cas and Amelia’s house.
“Just a friend,” Dean answers, taking the vegetables out of the cart and putting them on the register.
. He’s so whipped.
Amelia huffs, turning to fetch a plate from the cabinet above her. “That’s true.”
Victor grimaces. “Sorry, I didn’t buy you anything,” he jokes.
“I—” He stops, huffs. “Fine. I could go for a milkshake. Just one.”
, a little voice chimes in,
He’s stupid. She’s a nurse, he should’ve started with something she’s familiar with. “It is an intake form, sort of. It’s just more… nosey, let’s say. It will feel nosey, but I hope you’ll trust that every answer has a purpose.”
And Dean suddenly understands why he’s so tired. Why this is so, so difficult and takes so much out of him.
But the hesitation in Cas’s voice has him curious. He knows this is going to be good.
“I know. I’m scared of that too, but I’m hurting really bad, and um… God.” This is where he’s going to have to lie, isn’t he? “What I’m about to tell you could really compromise the whole Study, so I’m gonna have to ask you to keep that to yourself. Forget I even told you. It’s very important that this doesn’t get out.”
“No wonder you couldn’t keep a secretary if you kept treating them like you’re treating me now,” Dean spits at him.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Dean shrugs. He shrugs because if he didn’t, he would sigh and roll his eyes. “It’s part of—”
It’s not the first time he gets the urge to touch Cas outside of their participation in the Study, but this one is too domestic for comfort.
. And the Empty took him. I didn’t know—it went too fast. I didn’t understand half of it. Hell, I can hardly remember half of what he said!”
“Yeah. Yeah, there’s too much even for the two of us.”
They have no hunger for knowledge.
Dean grunts, “We’re making porn, not a friggin’ Lifetime movie!”
“Uh,” Dean racks his brain for the little bit of Freud he’s read. “This is when patients develop feelings for their therapist, right? Something about, if you unconsciously want to, uh, jump your dad’s bones, and if you talk about it with your therapist, then you’ll want to jump said therapist?”
“We’ll talk tomorrow,” Novak says as if he didn’t hear him. “Just go home, Dean.”
Cas tilts his head on the side again, curious. “Where?”
“Alright,” Ellen nods, pushing away from the bar.
This sounds a lot like jealousy, and Dean can’t help the little pang of joy he feels hearing it.
“Dean.”
it could’ve happen that he doesn’t realize Cas’s dick is out and suddenly
He’s tired of this. Of everything.
Dean can only huff at that, because, well… this Cas’s brand of dry humor never fails to amuse him. He likes this playful Cas much better than the other sides of the Doc.
Thank you, and enjoy the ending :)
Well, he looks damn fine, at least. He made sure to put on less blockers, too, just in case. Might as well use all the tools Mother Nature gave him, if they’re going to try and charm people out of some dollars.
The silence that follows is deafening. Dean can do nothing but gape, heart beating inside his throat and blood pulsing in his ears.
“Well, the whole scene was on fire when the police got there,” Victor answers, eyes on the file.
“Stop calling him that!” Sam’s red in the face, but he stopped to listen. Now he’s angry again. “He’s not your—your boyfriend! He’s not even your friend! Stop calling him that stupid nickname!”
Dean huffs a small laugh. “We’re really not there yet.”
The other board members nod approvingly, and Castiel’s blood starts to boil. He’s waited more than three weeks after the deadline they set for the report, and this is what he gets after all that time.
He shoos Castiel away with a wave of his hand.
She finishes typing what she’s working on before finally looking up. “What can I do for you?”
Dean feels the corner of Cas’s mouth turn up into a smug smile against his cheek.
“Just promise me you won’t be gone when I open my eyes again.”
“Sure.”
Adler takes it, reads this one too. “Hm. We’ll keep that one as well.”
Yes, pursuit is definitely the right word. He’s not sure how it landed him night after night sitting inside a cramped closet in a brothel’s bedroom, watching a prostitute get fucked from behind by one of her clients through a peephole, but that’s where he finds himself these days.
“Not quite,” Cas answers, a bit sad, “Not anymore.”
With a chuckle, Dean scratches the back of his head, “I think it’s obvious, yeah. But I have Cas, and Sam, here…” he gives his brother a look, “so I think I’ll be okay.”
Castiel shakes his head, “
“Nothing we could’ve done,” he answers, handing her a small box of matches with the logo of their hotel on it.
“I’m going to fuck you, now,” Cas says, almost matter-of-factly.
“So you don’t trust I know him. That’s what I’m saying, you don’t trust me.”
“Who would like some coffee?” Amelia asks, finally breaking the silence.
Cas’s mouth is on Dean’s cheek, hands pushing his shirt up, everything is warm and quiet. Dean breathes deeply, taking in the scent of Cas above him. His heart seems to slow down a fraction.
“It will. Trust me.”
“I don’t want you to pay for a cab, I’m perfectly capable of—”
The Doc’s rhythm falters, but he picks it up quickly. “I suppose so, yes.”
Dean sighs. The day is starting great.
“Been there a while.”
Finally, with a satisfying ‘click’, the door unlocks, and Dean’s home. He doesn’t even try to lock the door behind him, just throwing the keys haphazardly on the kitchen counter. He undresses quickly, scattering clothes all over the apartment before ending face down on the bed.
good just yet,” Cas says.
There’s not much he can grab from there. A box of paperclips would be useful. He goes for it, stands up, and almost jumps out of his skin when he’s suddenly face to face with Zachariah.
“Sometimes he had Michael do stuff instead of him. He just sat there and watched, the fucking perv…”
“Do you think I’m stupid, Dean?” Castiel asks instead of answering.
“Dean?”
“Well,” Cas hesitates, God knows why, “I’m sorry. But I’m glad he’s happy. He’s a good kid.”
“Alright,” Benny licks his lips again, and his eyes find Dean’s. “Well alone, I don’t do it often so usually on my bed. Just a quick rub out, you know? Just to clean the pipes.”
“I’m good,” Dean says. “Really. And I have tons of stuff to do.”
Fuck that, Dean thinks. After everything, they deserve to have a good time.
Dean sighs into the kiss and lets Cas turn them around until Dean’s on his back. They keep kissing like a couple of teenagers for a while.
that. He needs a bit of time to get used to the idea first.
“They’ll love it,” Sam assures him.
“And I’ve missed you,” Cas keeps going. “I just… I thought that maybe we could spend some time together today, and I would really like to know what she told you to make you run away, but if you don’t want to say anything, it’s okay too. I just… I’ve missed you. And I don’t want you to hide from me because of something my mother said.”
“And the, um, person I participated with is long gone, but it did something to me, I guess.”
, Dean thinks as Cas drives them out of town, there’s no other word for it.
Of course, he doesn’t say it. The Doc doesn’t need to know that, and it’s none of his business anyway. Even though Dean would love it if he wanted to make it his business.
“You don’t see patients here, do you?”
“No, It’s not that, it’s—Cas!”
He keeps stroking the small of Cas’s back, hoping it’ll keep him from pushing away and leave.
He clears his throat, “Excuse-me, ladies.”
“Uh,” Dean lets out, wiping his chin.
“Please, tell me we have something this time,” he says as he gets closer.
“I know. Scout up.”
But the week Dean’s just spent with Cas is like a giant chiasm between them. Dean needs a little more time to get in the right mindset and be able to find the balance in his relationship with Aaron again.
“Come on, Dean,” Sam whines. “Throw me a bone, here!”
He’s about to round his desk and say his goodbye to Dean before picking up the phone, but Dean is faster. He takes two steps to Martha’s desk and picks up one of the three phones in front of him. The one for Cas’s practice, incidentally.
The time is seven thirty, and they rushed from the hospital to their private practice. They’ve also rushed the six flights of stairs that led to the third floor, and Dean is about to die.
“Sort of. I know you wouldn’t,” Dean says quickly. “But it’s… yeah. Sorry.”
Dean ignores the stiffy he can see poking through the Doc’s slacks in his peripheral vision.
He still has his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Right now he’s standing in the river, the water coming to lick at his calves, and he’s holding a giant toad in his hands. He gets out of the water, trying to keep the toad from slipping out of his hold. When he gets on the bank, he finds a heavy stone, and pins the toad’s legs to the ground with it. The toad tries to escape, croaking helplessly.
Cas is merciful, after that. Or at least he is at first, rolling his hips in a gentle way so that Dean’s orgasm builds slowly, pleasure pooling pleasantly in his belly. There, but not urgent.
And Dean hears him lick his lips.
Dean’s just lost all his privileges for the night in a couple of minutes, it seems. All he can do now is sit back and watch it happen.
He’s met with silence again. Oddly, this makes him uncomfortable. The discussion should not end there, clearly, but he doesn’t know where he should take it. He’s never been good at this. It was always better to say nothing, get the cold shoulder until people forgot what they were mad at him for, or just accepted that he was an ass.
Sometimes, in moments like this, he wishes he could go back to before he applied for the position under Cas. He wishes he has stayed bartending and never discovered how good he was as a secretary, that way he wouldn’t have to miss it.
Dean knows he won’t let go. Might as well be honest, this time. He puts down the rag he was swiping the counter with. “I’m worried about Cas.”
Satisfied, Cas nods, and meets him halfway for a rewarding kiss.
Dean harrumphs but lets him bask in his smugness without saying anything.
This has Castiel start slightly and stop for a second, making him forget he’s not supposed to know what they’re here for, not supposed to hate them. She’s telling him to sit, in his own home? He barely holds a snort, and does as she tells him, sitting back in his armchair.
If his eyeballs were swelling right now, Dean wouldn’t even be surprised. “It’s n--, it’s not that bad?”
Cas just shakes his head, puts down his clipboard and starts pushing away from his chair, but Dean stops him.
“Cas…” Dean pleads.
” Castiel asks, and Dean hears the frustration in his voice.
Now Cas is smiling, a real, genuine smile lighting up his face. Seeing him smile has always felt like seeing the sun peeking out from under the clouds after a long storm, now more than ever.
“Oh, God…” Dean groans, and Cas laughs again.
His heart hurts and he just wants to leave.
,” Amelia says.
He shakes the thought off, and follows them both inside, Sam on his tail. Doc Adler and a dignified-looking lady with gray peppered in her hair like nature itself tried to make her look as chic as possible are already there, sitting on the couch.
“Hi,” he greets Aaron as he sits in his car and closes the door behind him.
From: Gabriel M. (
“No you won’t,” Sam mumbles.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-
He’s holding a half empty bottle of beer, wondering how his life got to this point. How, at twenty-five, he’s about to die, because his boyfriend likes to slice people up.
“I’m all for it,” Benny smiles, leaning back with an arm across the back of the seat.
He needs Cas to take him right now.
“Hum, hi,” Dean says, smiling gently at her. “I’m looking for doctor Novak? I’m a friend. Dean. Maybe you’ve heard of me.”
“Let’s go inside, shall we?” Cas, always impatient, says.
Benny laughs, a full-bellied laugh as he keeps slapping against Dean, and Dean thinks, idly, he hasn’t felt this alive in months.
And enjoy :)
A fantasy.
“Man,” he pats Cas’s back. “I’m sorry.”
Attorney at Law
When Dean interrupted him, he was watching Downton Abbey on Netflix. Dean was already walking on eggshells, then. Nobody interrupts Cas when it’s Netflix time. Dean should’ve seen the bad news coming, though, seeing as how gentle Cas had been with him when Dean asked him what was up.
Dean shrugs again with one shoulder, and now he’s the one who’s looking down.
“Aaron, yeah.” Dean chews on his lower lip for a second, because he kind of doesn’t know himself. If he’s honest, he didn’t even want to think about it. “Like I said, it was new. And… I didn’t know when to tell you, or if I even should.”
. He lets his robe fall at his feet.
Dean’s eyes pop open at that, tearful, “I’m so tired…”
He doesn’t know what he’s gonna make for dinner and he’s so intent on getting Sam to talk that he can barely concentrate on what’s in front of his eyes.
“You’ll tell me?”
“We’ll be fine,” Cas breathes against his mouth.
, Dean forgot all about him.
He only has himself.
“Alright,” he says, sheepish. He can’t look at Cas when he says it. “Sam told me he was leaving after graduation. I wasn’t expecting it to come so soon.”
Aaron is offering to pay for his drinks. His evening is free, God knows when that will happen again, and tomorrow is a Saturday. He can study then.
“What happened?” he asks, looking up. There’s a bit of concern in his eyes this time.
“I said I wanted us to get dinner together, didn’t I?” Dean answers. This time he can’t hold back the slight anger tinting his words. “Benny wants to have lunch with me. I’m still free tonight.”
“Please,” he adds, just for good measure.
“D’you wanna play?”
“I don’t know how it will feel. All I know is it will go a lot smoother with you there.”
“Yes,” Castiel lets out in a breath. He tries to will his erection to go down, to calm the erratic beating of his heart. “I guess the conditions for the experiment are not ideal. We should…” he trails off.
So instead of saying anything, he pretends to be zipping his mouth shut, and wriggles his eyebrows.
“Okay.”
Fuck! “Can I touch myself?”
“Yep?”
“Tell me,” Dean insists, holding himself up on his elbows.
Pink tints Amelia’s cheeks, but her smile doesn’t falter. Maybe because she’s well on her way to be properly drunk.
Dean’s having a big party, and he invited all of their school friends. But they’re nothing. Castiel knows they’re nothing to Dean.
“Did I hurt you?” he asks.
Anyway, even if Dean wanted to go, he can’t.
His inner Alpha shouldn’t come out to play, in theory. Looks like the feral part associated with secondary gender has more to do with psychology than they first thought, so Dean makes a quick mental note of that, before straightening up to position himself properly above Cas.
Dean can’t speak. He doesn’t know why this is so difficult. He should be able to confide in Aaron about everything.
And it happens again.
“What for?”
He keeps kissing Cas’s cock, giving it a lick as he runs his thumb against Cas’s taint.
“So, Cas, Buddy,” he starts, licking his lips. “What’s up? How’s it hangin’?”
But Aaron doesn’t need to know any of that, so, as he always does in public these days, Dean puts on a happy smile and struts to Aaron’s car.
Once in their room, he sends him into the shower, hoping it’ll sober him up a bit before the ceremony, but when it’s Dean’s turn to clean up, Cas takes advantage of the complimentary drinks in the minibar, sampling every single one of them.
It’s the most comfortable bed he’s ever been in. Ever. He can’t believe he never tried to sneak a little nap on it before.
When Cas followed him over the edge, and it was over, he let himself slide on the side and laid on his back, out of breath and light-headed.
“Still thinking about the witches,” Cas asks.
“Yeah, sorry I didn’t call. Rhonda invited me,” Dean says, flopping on his belly next to where Castiel is sitting cross-legged. “It was really sudden so I didn’t have time to tell you. Man, I couldn’t wait to get home and tell you everything!”
He lets her do it, mostly because the first time he was called in and tried to open the door himself, she took it very personally.
“Dean,” Cas stomps toward Dean and bends over his desk like he’s about to deliver a very important speech. “I don’t care. Reschedule someone. I need them penciled in for fertility treatment starting next week.”
“Tell me what?”
She blinks. Stammering a small, “W-what?”
“How did you--?”
Violent knocking on the door of the apartment wakes Dean up. He looks around, disoriented, the pain in his belly making itself known again, slowly.
“Wow, Benny, hi! How’re you? It’s been a minute!”
He spends a few more seconds with the phone on his ear, blinking, then hangs up more violently than anyone ought to treat a telephone receiver, in Castiel’s opinion.
Sam harrumph. “Whatever.”
Of course he wants to yell, he wants to be angry that this is all Cas has to say, after everything, but he’s too tired and too disappointed for it.
“Prove it.”
This is so, so tempting.
Castiel’s next day is the most stressful day of his life.
Cas is not at his desk.
Dean would have felt ridiculous with anybody else. But this is Cas, and he isn’t sure when they’ll have an occasion to be alone again, so he allows himself to fully enjoy it, ignoring any spark of self-consciousness.
Sam might need his help if he keeps on with his studies. Dean needs his job and he needs Cas, or else he might as well just die on the spot. There would be no use in him keeping on if he doesn’t have his passion to carry him.
He should really get to it before Cas changes his mind. Doesn’t mean he can’t tease, just a little, even though Cas asked him not to.
Castiel considers it, and truly, he doesn’t know why he does.
He really needs to put his affairs in order, so to speak. If he helps Cas reconnect with Amelia, maybe it could help him as well?
Dean has to admit he’s confused too. Not to mention having Graham squish his whole body against his is making his skin crawl.
As long as he wasn’t home alone, especially at night, without anyone to pester and feed and take care of, it wasn’t real. Not really.
It helps that the blockers are fading a little, like they usually do after a long day at work. Smelling himself again after a whole day without any familiar smell helps him stay grounded.
Okay. Dean has no good answer to that. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, Master of Sass! Who’d have thunk it?
! He’s shaking even harder, whole body vibrating with stress. Cas hands him the beer again, then, almost as an afterthought, changes his mind, takes a sip himself, and gives it back. “You will be.”
The chair he’s sitting on creaks but Dean doesn’t move, doesn’t turn around to see if he got up. Even if he wanted to, Dean realizes he’s closed his eyes at some point, and he’s scared that if he opens them, he’ll lose his grip on his body.
“What did you talk about?”
“But I like Pricker’s suggestion,” he goes on.
Cas opens his mouth to speak, maybe to protest, but it just flaps open and shut like a dying fish and Dean laugh.
“It’s just…” Dean breathes, running a hand on the back of his neck, “I like being slutty, okay? Like, act like your stereotypical omega. If I’m comfortable with the person then… yeah, I enjoy acting like I’m their bitch. And I don’t want your opinion of me to change because of that.”
Guilt pierces through Castiel, briefly but sharply. He looks down at the piece of cake she served him. “I’ m sorry.”
What is he waiting for?
Cas hums, but Dean shakes his head, “Fuck no! I need to blow my load, like, right now!”
Or he did anyway.
“If we’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do it right.”
Castiel takes it without flinching, because if he didn’t, it would mean giving away something very private.
He’s never tried to have sex without being able to smell his partner, so he guesses it’s part of the whole experience.
Smiling back, Dean drops a kiss at the juncture of Castiel’s hip. He gives a lick there, tasting the skin. A thrill goes through him at the scent. Cas smells musky, mostly because they’ve been on the road for a while before this, but that’s how Dean likes him best. Castiel the control freak-slash-serial killer? Dean likes him. But Cas, the completely normal guy he can be, sometimes? The one who sweats, and bitches about bills, and likes organic food even though he knows Dean will never eat all that green shit but who keeps buying it anyway? Dean loves
“You will only take what I give you,” Castiel goes on. His jaw hardens, the blue of his eyes almost hypnotizing to Dean. “Understood?”
“Fuck’s sake, Mom!!”
And so he comes, and he comes again, over and over and over until he actually passes out from it.
“Sam?” Cas says, and Dean’s heart stops. “No, everything’s fine. Dean’s here.”
“Sorry, Doc,” Dean bursts behind him, and Castiel almost jumps.
“Close your eyes,” the Doc says.
“What Doctor Novak was explaining is… interesting, of course, but how does it pertain to Behavioral Science, exactly?” Dr. Graham asks, frowning. “Not to be rude,” he eyes Cas, before coming back to Dean, “but this is just sex. Nothing ground-breaking has ever come out of it.”
“Breathe,” Cas says. “Breathe with me. You’re having a panic attack, that’s all. You’re fine. I’m here.”
“Still, this is…”
Dean sighs, “Thanks. It didn’t hurt enough when you said it the first time.”
“Well, play it,” Dean blurts. “I’m not gonna wait here all night!”
Opening his mouth a little more, Dean deepens the kiss. Cas exhales at that. Overwhelmed, Dean shiver a little.
Aaron blinks at him, surprised, and maybe a bit scared by the outburst. Dean can’t stop himself.
“Slut!” Someone yells in their direction.
“I just got here!” Dean answers.
The smile is gone from Grace’s face. She doesn’t say anything for a second, and it feels like everyone in the room is holding their breath. Finally, she scolds Castiel. “You’re a fag?”
Cas extends a leg on Dean’s back, his head falling to one side as he bites on his lower lip.
“I don’t believe he will, no,” Cas reassures him.
Dean has to lean forward a little bit to check the chat on screen and find ‘Pricker’ among all the answers Cas got. ‘
Grace doesn’t lose her smile. “In the same school? That’s nice.”
Finally, he sighs. “Alright. But if you can take a night off, I should have one too.”
He doesn’t say he still does, and that it’s mostly because he enjoys his time with Cas, even if it means he’s taking time with Cas away from her. He doesn’t say the more he spends time having sex with her husband, the less guilty he feels. He doesn’t say that nowadays, when he’s lying naked, sweaty and breathless next to Cas and thoughts of her pop through his head, it’s easy to dismiss them. He feels bad because the guilt is not here anymore.
Yup, now he’s in the mood. It would’ve been a turn off to talk science in the middle of it before Dean started this whole thing. But this is Cas’s domain. He’s self-assured in this, he knows what he’s doing. It’s hot.
Truth is, he’s getting bored. Coming to work is starting to become a chore, and the last thing he wants to do is having to go job hunting again. The Study was interesting. It’s almost like nothing will ever be able to top it in terms of interesting content. Dean knows himself. He’s an impatient, impulsive guy.
“It’s… you’ll have to repeat some of that. Roy Olson is a friend of yours.”
Dean wonders if Cas kisses his wife. He looks so alien, all the friggin’ time. Maybe he really comes from another planet. Wouldn’t be surprising, what with the whole space program thing happening these days. Maybe aliens sent him to observe human behavior. It would explain a lot of things.
this.
He still wants to stay here like this for a little while, though. This feels good. He doubts they’ll have many occasions to do this, somehow.
The night goes absolutely well, but soon, the rest of the restaurant is almost empty, and the waiter that’s been serving them is pacing around clearing his throat.
“Alright,” Dean whispers. His voice won’t get out right. “How-How many times a month do you achieve orgasm?”
Dean scoffs. “Talk dirty to me, Doc.”
“So you know how communicating your problems may help you vent your anger and frustration,” Dean says as Cas rounds his desk. Cas lets himself fall into his chair and gives him an angry look. “You might want to try that.”
He doesn’t have much more that he wants to take with him, but he needs to make things casual. He gathers Cas’s planner, his notebook, and the directory from the drawer as well, doesn’t stop, doesn’t hesitate, throws them in the box and swiftly crouches to pretend to look through the last drawer down.
“Then don’t either.”
Castiel sighs. “You’re not going to say goodbye?”
“Seven. Sometimes eight.”
“Thanks,” Dean breathes. “Sorry you had to…” he sighs, try to pull at the sheets to cover himself, “see me like this.”
Now they’re both uncomfortable, so at least Dean doesn’t feel alone in this.
– and he finally releases a breath, somehow admitting defeat with it.
When Dean pulls back, a tear runs down Lisa’s face.
Let me know what you think at the end! Comments sustain me!
He pushes away, sitting up and bends over to grab his shirt from the floor.
“Yeah, well, I’m not sure that I do you, anymore,” Dean answers, quiet.
He snips this train of thoughts in the bud and just breathes, and thinks about how best to handle this.
“It’s not your place to do a lot of things but you do them anyway,” she snaps.
Cas seems to think better than trying to argue. He wants to, that much is clear. Maybe he really believes it. Maybe he just wouldn’t stand the guilt of admitting he’s cheating.
Yeah, Dean feels that in his core.
Castiel settles on the bed, and, with a small hesitation, grabs Dean’s bottle of beer, and downs it in one go, putting the bottle back on the nightstand. Dean raises his eyebrows at him, but Castiel ignores him, cocking his own weapon. The sound of it echoes in the small motel room. It sounds final.
There’s no room for protest or any other questions, so the journalist nods, and moves away. Dean doesn’t know if he should thank Sam or slap him, seeing as how much he seems to be enjoying making Dean uncomfortable. They’re moving, though. He doesn’t have time to think too much about it.
“I don’t wanna go to sleep.” His voice is shaking.
“Can we do that again, sometime?”
Watching Dean work on the animal until the thing dies, Castiel’s mind starts to drift. Dean is so beautiful. He’s never met someone as beautiful as his friend. Sometimes, out of the blue, he gets this strange need to lick him all over, see how he tastes. But he doesn’t. It would be weird, obviously.
Dean shrugs, trying to play it cool. “Yeah, why not. Unless you don’t wanna. I don’t mind.”
Cas’s face doesn’t move. Dean can’t read anything on it, still, and he has a sudden uncomfortable flashback to the time when he first started working for Cas.
“Can I touch you?”
I’m looking for a job. I just can’t do it anymore. You have Anna, and now you’re about to get married. I can’t do that to her. I’m sorry.
“Okay,” Cas repeats, and finally takes it as his cue to leave.
Warily, Cas does as Dean asks. Once he’s within reach, Dean grabs Cas’s mouth with his own. With the surprise, Cas drops his body and they’re suddenly skin to skin, cocks resting next to each other.
Nevertheless, he wants to take Cas’s hand. So, yes, he thinks. Yes, this is a date. He’s on a date. With Cas.
But the only answer Dean gets is the tone in the receiver telling him the Doc’s hung up. He doesn’t know what that means, doesn’t know what will happen next, but knowing that Cas is on his case does a lot to soothe him.
He’s only half-listening, too focused on sitting down when they finally reach it. He’s hurting too much, and he wants to touch himself really, really badly, but even with the loose fabric of his sweat pants, his cock is throbbing with pain.
He wasn’t going to check the mail right now, but Cas’s been impatient, and Dean is kind of right there with him. On one hand, opening the mail to see nothing but ads for palm readers and diet pills, again, will be disappointing, like it’s been every night since they’ve been coming here.
Neither of them dare go anywhere for a while. Dean is the first to break.
Castiel gives him what could be considered a pouty face. It seems to say ‘
She knows.
They’ve been doing this for a little while now, even if not as often as Dean would’ve liked, and it’s become easier for her to talk about herself.
Gabriel’s eyes water again. Tears spill, slowly falling along his cheeks. He tries to say something. Annoyed, Castiel wrinkles his nose, and reaches for the gag, pulling it down.
,” Video-Cas says.
“What gives you the right, Zachariah? You can’t throw me away like this!”
In its place comes the grief, the too familiar pain that’s been following him for a couple of days now, too recent to forget. He has a second of confusion, an overwhelming rush of feelings coming over him as his memories come back.
“We found him, Vic,” Pam whispers.
He spends so much time on it, almost a whole week, that when he finally becomes aware that Cas hasn’t gotten back to him, the sense of disappointment is way stronger than Dean thinks it ought to be.
He watches Cas, his majestic, naked bubble butt bouncing as he walks out.
It smells really good. Dean’s body is starting to react to it.
This is just crazy. Not that Victor hasn’t seen some crazy shit in his fifteen years working for the Bureau, but this takes the cake. Opening his eyes, he looks up at Michael Milton’s body, taking in the greyish hue of his skin underneath the blood. “He’s been dead longer than the other one.”
He’s never tested the Study Room’s bed, but he saw the price tag on that mattress, he knows it’s going to be good.
He follows the instructions, climbing his way to the second floor.
“Your wife needs you,” she tells Cas.
Cas’s head seems to disappear into his pillows. Dean guesses he’s trying to relax, but he knows from experience that thinking too much about what’s going on is only going to make him more tense, which will end up with Dean having more trouble pushing in without hurting him.
“One day you started crying, and crying and crying and you wouldn’t stop. Dad went crazy on Mom’s ass, so she took you to the hospital.” Gabriel swallows, looking away. “You had some weird internal damage so they dug around, called the police, child services and everything… and that’s it. They took him away.”
So, no, Cas won’t contact Dean just yet. Better wait until things start looking up.
“Is that so?”
“I found it,” she says, and she looks like she can’t believe it herself. “I found the name. Fuck me!”
The tears finally flow as he manages to look at the clock and he sees it’s eight twenty-two and he’s late. He’s late and he’s uncontrollably scared and he tries to go but Cas won’t let him.
“Good.”
“I’d love that.”
Well, it’s true. Dean can’t argue with that. She sounds bitter and resentful, and of course he can’t blame her for it.
He opens a window on screen, then another containing only a single video file.
Dean is just finishing writing down their new Alpha’s private info on a little card, that they’ll then archive inside a safe in the Doc’s office, when the Doc hums, as he does when he gets an idea, and Dean has to bite his lips not to ask what’s up. Not that he doesn’t want to, obviously, but he’s still pissed at Novak. He won’t give in now.
Dean swallows as his heart skips a beat.
Dean winces. “Uh. Not really. I, uh—”
They don’t speak.
“Excitement,” Novak murmurs.
Almost as if they both know that just one more second could ruin them for good.
“I might have an inkling,” Cas smiles, which prompts another laugh from Dean.
They have ten minutes to gather their personal things, and then hurry to gather everything they can carry from the Study that they haven’t moved to the clinic just yet.
“It was fake.”
Dean’s never seen him that excited about anything. Ever.
“I know,” the Doc says. His eyes never leaving his graphs. The session’s over, but they’ve been reviewing the new couple’s charts for an hour, now. “But since we’re taking a closer look at their orgasms, it seems like a good idea to see if they can also get different ones from other stimulations. Not just penetrative sex.”
It’s still shy, but Dean doesn’t feel as uncomfortable anymore.
“Why?”
“Okay, lie down,” Dean instructs, pushing Ash away as subtly as he can.
It’s not like Dean didn’t know that they have a special connection. A ‘profound bound’ as Cas called it. But to call it
He feels stupid because Cas was the one who invited him out,
“Any problems with you presentation?”
Castiel’s insides clench in anticipation. Dean scoots closer, and slowly put his hand flat on Castiel’s belly. His cock jumps without his consent. He’s already hard. Dean tentatively runs his knuckles against it. Castiel gasps.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Cas nods frantically.
It’s mostly true, and yet Dean feels like it’s a blatant lie. But telling Aaron about Benny is easier than telling him about Cas.
Dean looks up at Aaron. Too late.
Plus, Dean’s twenty-nine, he’s starting to get a little pudge around the belly, and it’s making him self-conscious.
“Good bye, Dean. See you tomorrow.”
“Wouldn’t hurt to double check…”
“Not helping,” Dean hisses at him.
Cas seems a bit confused. He shrugs.
His body agrees with the idea whole-heartedly, an erection already swelling inside his pants, taunting the abused skin around his cock. Dean lets out a whine. “Dammit…”
The words ring final to Dean’s ear. He’s heard them before. He knows what they mean.
He grabs his arm as he finally reaches him again, and the Doc lets himself be turned around, a fed up look on his face. “Dean. Amelia is waiting for me.”
When Sam left, it felt like the end of the world, but maybe it was exactly what he needed to focus on himself.
Dean takes a breath.
Cas gulps.
Sam groans, but doesn’t answer, and Dean impatiently grins at Cas. Cas lies on his back, knees up, ignoring Dean and instead turning to Sam, “I can wrap my legs around Dean’s neck if you’d like.”
“Well, on Fridays we go to bed early and… we have sex.”
Dean’s eyebrows fly up to his hairline. “Now?”
Here comes the annoyed sigh. Dean ignores it and strolls to the bedroom, peeling off his shirt and tosses it on his bed.
Amelia hums while he downs half his drink.
– squint. “I want as much data as I can before he shuts us down.”
The forensic assistants are pushing the bodies inside their truck. They close the door, and it feels like a part of Victor’s life is closing with it.
He could call him, use the Study as an excuse, but the possibility that Amelia might answer the phone holds him back. He hasn’t talked to her since the last time he and Cas participated in the Study, and with Sam gone, Dean doesn’t think he could handle the guilt.
He barely manages to take off his jeans, throws Dad’s jacket haphazardly somewhere, before he falls onto the bed.
“I don’t know,” Cas smiles, playful. Dean almost melt on the spot. “You’ll have to wait and see.”
He waits for Dean to acknowledge him, so Dean shakes his head ‘no’.
“What could I do? I just…” Castiel eyes Dean, who’s keeping his gaze locked on the floor, seemingly lost in grief. “I watched… them. And I, I just went home. I couldn’t… what could I do? I was devastated!”
Dean doesn’t need it, per se, and Cas is clearly aware of that, but they don’t mention it.
Dean is at his side in a matter of seconds.
“Of course.”
“That’s not what I’m saying! Will you just listen?”
They’re both still in deep shit, but maybe, just maybe, they can have a bit of hope.
“Are you sure about that?” she answers, smug. “I can still have a nice little chat with Amelia.”
“Cas is in the OR,” Dean tells Naomi once they’re alone.
First, Cas doesn’t interjects with science facts, which is nice. He just goes to town this time, but it’s not only physical. There’s another dimension to it, in the way Cas holds him, moves his arms around Dean like he wants them to be a whole person, as if he wants them to melt into one another, as if they could be any closer than they already are.
He doesn’t realize he’s crying, howling, really, until strong fists pound on the door. The sound of it echoes inside the room. Or maybe it’s in his head. He thinks he heard someone saying something, about the FBI. About how they should open the door.
