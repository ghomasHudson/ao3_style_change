<< It is not important what there is, Greg, but what there isn't >> says John, who opened the rear door and the hood, while the two policemen were trying to understand how the accident had gone.
<< This does not mean that there hasn't been >> John replies, finding this man's comment really idiotic. << The smell of ammonia here is even stronger. This place has been cleaned recently, and with care >>.
<< And this is not good, don't you understand? The most logical thing you should do would be to leave, John. Anyone would do it before the risk of becoming a continuous bait and I don't understand why you didn't do it >>.
“The person saved him. The person shouted at the child to run away, run as much as he can, and hide himself "and the child obeyed. Frightened. Maybe he didn't want to leave the person, but this must have insisted. A woman, of course. It can only be a woman. Women are used to being with children, aren't they?
<< Yes, but I would not be okay with my conscience, Mr. Holmes >> replies the director. << I don't want to managing a hotel where rapes and assaults are committed >>.
<< Because London is not my city. I only work there. I am from Manchester, as well as my fiancée >>.
<< Even Mary's father was. And the brothers and the mother. Part of her became infected with it and developed that violent and murderous personality. I wondered if I also have something like this somewhere and I found it, you know? >> he says holding the blanket with his hand. << Moriarty has often appeared in my thoughts. He spoke to me, urged me to kill her to save me. There were moments when I thought of following his advice and if I didn't, it was only because John's voice helped me to give up >>.
<< I'm very serious >> Sherlock says, with a hiccup. Clear sign of drunkenness, if it really need to find the signs. John laughs loudly and Sherlock pouts offended. << Are you laughing at me, John Watson? >> he asks. Sherlock raise his pelvis, levering on the wrists locked by the soldier and tries to bring his knees back to his chest in order to kick John away. With all-natural movements the doctor insinuates himself between those long legs and locking Sherlock down.
<< Also, under a piece of furniture placed near the fireplace, I found this >> Mycroft says, showing him a piece of scorched cobalt blue fabric.
<< A crime scene is not the most suitable place for a child! I thought you was more sensible, Mr Holmes. An important man from our economic scene has been kidnapped with his wife and his son. I can't believe you take the opportunity to teach your work to your heir! >>.
Sherlock runs his hand through the hair he has cut, smoothed and dyed blond to put on Edward Nolton's clothes. A shiver runs through his back at the thought of when his hair will start to grow, revealing their natural color.
<< I think it's better you go to sleep, John. You must be very tired if you get out of it with similar idiocies >> he says, placing his other hand on John's. Sherlock smiles sweetly at him, making his gaze even more attractive. John would like to drag him and kiss him, just like punk did in that alley, and he is sure that the pain he feels in his abdomen would vanish instantly.
In other circumstances, Sherlock would have found this woman's mind fascinating. From what he has been able to notice, that catatonic state seems to be generated by the activation of the synapses in the production of a complex thought. The previous occasions on which Mary suddenly froze, in fact, saw her perform some operations once again to resolve a situation or make a choice, which is visible from the glimmer that Sherlock noticed lighting up in her eyes.
<< We are flatmates >> he replies and fragments of that Saturday night come back overbearing to him.
<< Could you making tea for me too? Thanks >> Sherlock asks and the fact that he thanked him is a real novelty.
<< Mary Abbott committed suicide >> John replies, holding his friend close. << Hataway himself came here this morning to give us the news. He brought the letter she wrote before hanging himself >>.
<< No >> Sherlock says, moving away from John. << I need to distract myself. Just give me a moment >>.
The door opens and the first thing that enters the room is a tray. Two huge hands support the tray. The fingers are swollen, indicative of poor circulation. The arms are strong under the red flannel shirt with blue stripes that cross to form many squares. Arms accustomed to chopping wood and doing hard work, for which it was simple to load him and take him up two flights of stairs.
<< About what? >> he says without taking his eyes off the booklet. John wrinkles his face and takes a deep breath.
<< Oh, Doctor Watson! My compliments for your blog. I asked Inspector Lestrade to contact you because I want the best to resolve this regrettable fact >>.
<< It is possible, yes >> Sherlock replies, stroking the instrument. He feels the woman's gaze on himself, but discovers that it no longer disturbs him as a few days before. The hands are numb and distant, as if they were no longer his. To be honest, Sherlock perceives this sensation throughout the body. He barely notices Mary's quick snap, sprung to his feet like a spring.
<< I hope you are right. Rapists are a category that I just can't stand >> John says, leaving the room.
<< Sniffs its well, Morgan >> Sherlock asks and the puppy  pass the nose diligently over the entire surface of the footprints. When he has collected all the data he needs, Morgan sits on the tail, turning his eyes to Sherlock. << Now search >> Sherlock tells him, pointing to the sheets of paper. The little dog stops on each of the registration forms, sniffs them and go on. Sniff fast the sheets of paper on the five rows they created before stopping longer on one of this. He sniffs it several times, turning around it, leaving those present in suspense. Then, Morgan sits down and starts barking at the consultant. Sherlock with four great steps is beside him. He strokes Morgan's head giving him a little prize, that the puppy munches with satisfaction. Sherlock picks up the form and stands up.
<< That place is dark and scary, I do not want to close you back there >> sobbing her, squeezing him even more to the chest.
<< What banal beers you drank, my friend >> laughs John emptying his glass. << Don't tell it around, okay? I'm not ready for official coming out yet. When my sister did it my mother almost had a heart attack. I am still traumatized by the side effects of the truth >>.
<< Ok, but he always says everything to you. It's the positive effect of your moving here, this, John. I have no desire to find myself as before. To wander in search of him without a shred of clue as to where he can be, until he deigns to show up! Not in the face of a case like this! >>.
<< No. Don't even think about it, Sherlock. I won't let you! >> John says, springing up, his finger pointed at him. << Don't you understand that this is what that madman wants? He want to get you away from everything that makes you human. He wanto to make you think you are a source of suffering for the people you care about >>.
<< Mold >> notes by observing the ceilings adorned with green blooms so large as to peel off the plaster.
The information seems to reach him in stages, which makes him seriously worry about the extent of the damage to his brain caused by the blow.
<< Can you smell this strong smell of disinfectant, Inspector? >> John asks him, entering the bathroom.
<< Can I ask you to accompany us home, please >> Margaret asks, serious and courteous. Faced with her wife's constant ignoring, Mr Ford moves towards her. Morgan sprints forward and starts barking against him. John and Sherlock let him do it.
<< Dad ... I ... sorry if I didn't come to you, but ... you always talk to me so well about him and ... and I didn't want to worry you >>. George trembles slightly. He barely holds back tears, keeping his eyes down. When Greg turns to him, George barely looks at him, unable to bear his gaze. The detective smiles as he puts his hand on his son's shoulder.
An intense and sweet lavender scent invests them. It comes from potpourri jars scattered almost everywhere. An oak desk is placed in front of the large window overlooking the garden, from which you can see the kennel that hosted Silver. There are many books piled up untidily on the desk but no manuscripts.
<< In the novel of the thug, the cottage becomes a furnished apartment, but the description of where it is located is more precise >> Greg joins him. << In the kidnapping, however, Sharon speaks about an underground cellar where the hostages can hear 'the voices of seagulls and the shouting of the people' >>.
<< There is news instead, gentlemen >>, Hataway bursts in, << but it is not good >> he adds, breaking their hopes. << A new storm is about to hit these mountains. It will begin tonight and only God knows when it will fade. I ... I don't want to be a hoodoo, but I'm afraid there is nothing for your friend to do. If someone had found and hosted him at this point he would have told us. What is the point of keeping an infirm and perhaps dying stranger at home? >> asks the inspector.
John sighs, shaking his head slowly. Unexpectedly, Sherlock shakes his hand and John looks up to meet his eyes.
Mary's heavy footsteps muffled by the snow move away. A door is opened and then closed again. The engine starts and the van leaves.
<< What are you doing here? >> Sherlock welcomes him, even before John takes a step inside the apartment.
John should stop. Yes, he really should, because Sherlock is too beautiful, his eyes too languid and his smile too sweet. Instead he pounces again on those red lips of the kisses and bites he gave him. Sherlock's fingers draw complex lines on John's back, each capable of giving him the chills. John feels Sherlock's fingers  getting heavier, bigger. He moves on his neck and Sherlock's laughter are like that of a little girl.
<< Please excuse us >> says the man, placing a hand on his wife's shoulder. The woman shivers at that touch, but lets herself be led elsewhere to avoid witnessing the passage of the coroner's men with the black sack in which their daughter lies.
<< I live here, have you forgotten? >> John replies, displaced by his welcome, putting perhaps a little too much acidity in the tone. Yes, it is possible that he'll start immediately with the 'big voice and threats' option tonight.
Sherlock is abruptly snatched from his Mind Palace by Mary's intimidating voice. He finds her almost attached to his face, intent on positioning the bed in a reclined position. In the air the smell of red-hot food expands combined with that of the woman, annoyingly too close to his face as she operates the knob.
The inspector was categorical and John had to acknowledge that the snow actually got thicker and the wind stronger in a short time. Being out there would have been suicide. Despite this, John cannot find peace.
<< It also seems to you that something has been dragged on this carpet, Myc? >> John asks, keeping his gaze fixed on the different tracks which cross each other clearly on the carpet and which seem to have been caused by the dragging of something heavy.
The woman remains motionless, firm in the formulation of the complicated thought that his question must have structured in her. Sherlock has no weapon kept in the trolley, but, although it may be a small thing against her fury, he can still try to use it as a shield to protect himself from her fists.
<< Sherlock woke up shouting that he had to save you and that you needed his help. I learned, by working with him, that all the decisions he makes and the ideas that jump to his head make sense. If Sherlock said that you need his help, then he must have good reasons and I found out what these reasons are >>.
A small thing with an indecipherable color and big trembled eyes was wrapped in Sherlock's scarf. The same small thing who now wanders around their living room wagging his tail.
<< Because I'm distracted and clumsy! >> Mary says, surely reporting what her mother was saying constantly. << If I dropped a cup by mistake, a slap would fly. If I hung badly, even only a clothes of the freshly made laundry, she would kick me. If I didn't finish in time the commissions she assigned me and if they weren't the way she wanted them, mom were hit me with the belt. I worked hard to do everything well, but the straps arrived the same. I'm really a landslide >> Mary laughs amused and it's not a hysterical laugh. No. It's a laugh of real fun.
<< How many times do I still have to repeat it? >> snorts, although, in truth, he only told them once and by phone. << The storm has put the telephone lines and repeaters out of order >>.
<< As far as I'm concerned, this is what I feel >> John remarks with conviction, supporting the inquisitive gaze of the English government. << I feel Sherlock is alive, Mycroft. Tattered, perhaps. In danger, even, but alive. I feel miself impotent becouse I can't go there and get him to safety >>. John runs his hand over his face and leaves it on his suddenly stretched lips. << Although he may not want to have anything more to do with me. It does not matter. As long as he's safe, then ... the rest doesn't count >>.
<< He does not realize the treasures he has >> sighs heartbroken Ulrika. << Ms Ford ran to her husband to show the sheet of paper. Usually an husband console his frightened wife and try to understand what happend to her. What's happen was an important thing! Someone entered the internal garden and broak a window with a stone! And another most important thing is that there was a sheet of paper attach to the stone. Instead, Mr Ford said to his wife that she was a crazy visionary. I didn't make it and I peeked >> admits the cook. << Too many times I refrained from running to the rescue of Ms Ford. I know that it's not fair, but I can't afford to end up like Amina >>.
<< Sherlock, you're not working alone, are you? >> Fox asks him and his hesitation counts as an answer.
<< The doctor is just waiting for you to fully recover from the morphine to operate and to fix the fracture >>.
Greg visibly shaken runs his hand through the gray hair to then go down to caress his shaggy beard. He intercepts John's gaze, as if asking him for confirmation of what the consultant said, and the doctor nods.
Sherlock observes Mary while, with her usual clumsiness, she tears away the empty vial. Sherlock grabs her hand just a moment before she places the new one.
<< Ladies and gentlemen, our evening Aufguss session will begin in ten minutes. You can start taking a seat >> announces a staff girl.
John smiles at him, with that expression that seems to mean 'you're totally crazy, but I love you' that Sherlock often finds on his face. He looking away to hide the embarrassment behind one of the maps he pretends is still examining. Although Sherlock is mad at John, he cannot hide how much pleasure his attentions do to him.
Sherlock ignores John, quickly swallowing a potato, seeing the woman ready to put another in his throat.
<< Since the first time I saw you and Sherlock together I was taken by the doubt that you could be for my brother or a blessing or a disgrace. Until a few days ago I thought the first. Now I realize that it has always been the second >>.
<< How do you know all these things? >> the sister shouts, shooting at the tip of the chair, her hands clinging to the seat.
<< Don't be too harsh on yourself, John. We are here and we will do something. If it were also to break the balls to Hataway to the point of giving us a snowcat and sending us out there, not caring about the tragic consequences of our crazy gesture >> chuckles and John joins him. John thought he would feel relieved that the detective hadn't grasped what he was really referring to with that sentence. Instead, another sigh escapes him.
<< And what do you think I had time to take its? >> she blurts out, irritated. << Thanks god, I managed to take you. The car fell down as soon as I took you off. I had to cut off your clothes to be able to medicate you >>.
<< The chief commissioner would not appreciate his presence. That's a miracle that he allowed me to ask for your advice >>.
<< For six months you have been bringing here always different women and I am not doing the scenes you are doing >> Sherlock replies, sternly.
<< Being discovered as the daughter of a Scotland Yard investigator made her banned from the portal. Now she is undergoing cyberbullying. George sent me some screenshots of the messages he found on his sister's computer today. It seems they have put around false rumors and photos, that Lizzy says have been retouched with Photoshop, that portray her in equivocal and undressed attitudes >> Sherlock tells him, passing the cellphone. John reads that wave of free badness to the detriment of a girl who has already experienced a stressful situation and shakes his head disconsolate.
<< You are sure, John >> Sherlock asks him, looking up from the message he received to bring him on him. John supports him, resolute and convinced, taking a step towards him.
<< I don't feel well, yes >> he admits between his teeth. However, he does not want to undermine the beneficial effect of the shower. He turns to take the cup from the cupboard and winces at finding Sherlock so close.
<< Well, then I would say that I await updates from you >> says Mycroft, standing up, giving them to understand that the session is ended.
John lets himself fall on the mattress, that creaks loudly. Plant his elbows on his knees and take his head in his hands.
Sherlock doesn't answer John. He sighs heartily and shakes his head. John understands that it is better not to insist. He follows Sherlock out the door, down the long corridor and down the stairs. John feels the tension that comes from him. Not anger. Not even the energy activated by a case that is proving to be very interesting. John perceives melancholy and a lot of sadness come from Sherlock and realizes that the presence of the child has something to do with it. The consultant and the child seems to have many things in common. John thinks that are this communance that upset Sherlock.
John realizes that I has just admitted to having used Sherlock in front of the man who moves seas and mountains to protect him. If he was in the shoes of Mycroft, he punch himself for the offense to his protégé. Mycroft, on the other hand, just sighs. A long, slow sigh.
<< Oh, stop it! >> John snorts, tugging at his hands. << Thanks to Mike, thanks to the chanse, who cares, the substance does not change, Sherlock! Allow me to fight alongside you against that madman and to be ... with you, if you want it >>.
Sherlock wakes up in sudden silence. Heavy silence. Spectral. After days of perennially vibrant glass and shaken by the wrath of the wind, of screaming and chilling drafts, of wooden crunches, sometimes so strong as to make people fear that everything could collapse on him at any moment, now silence reigns.
"He died during an investigation. In turn victim of the mad serial killer that he was chasing ". Yes, it's sounds good as headline from major news outlets ” notes James. "Tell me, though, if things had gone differently with your doctor, would you have let yourself go like this?".
<< Don't interrupt me, Lestrade! I was very skeptical of the idea that this private detective could really make a difference! Now I am more than convinced. Albert Ford is a majority shareholder in one of the companies in which I bought shares. Do you have any idea how the shares will drop if the kidnapper decides to kill him? >> shouts the chief to Lestrade.
<< Basically yes. The brothers are constantly on the road and since the father died they have become accustomed to spending the winter elsewhere. They leave her to look after the bedridden mother. A stroke struck her only a few months after her husband died. Mary keeps going as best she can and I will tell you, Lestrade, that she is not doing so badly. She has the strength of four men and, certainly, sometimes she remains motionless in a disturbing way and then suddenly changes her mood, but it is not a danger neither for others nor for herself >>.
John would like to tell Greg many things, but he just lowers his head, by imitating the greeting he gives him before leaving the police station.
John shakes himself from his immobility and hurries to reach the consultant, who walks peacefully towards the large fountain in the square.
<< No, John >> retorts the man, showing him the smile drawn now more like a grimace of pain. << I relived in a time too many similar episodes that happened in the past >>.
Sherlock's back arches. His legs tighten around John's hips. His hands clap on John's shoulders. His nails harpoon John's back and his voice begs him to stop. John does only when Sherlock's hands  grab his wrists. They both look panting. Their faces are red with laughter and the fake fight that just happened.
<< Morgan! >> aks William to the dog, who turns to them. He seems to sense Kelly's intentions and follows them. They go to the kitchen door and William sees a shadow rushing in their direction.
<< Yes >> the detective nods. Greg looks at him unconvinced. << This discussion must have been pretty important >>.
<< That's what I tried to do >> screams desperately. << I really thought they could help me and for a while it was really like that >>.
<< How can you not be mad at me? Greg turned his back on me when I told him what had happened, taking his part. You, instead, bring me tea. We are talking about your brother! >>.
<< No. I don't feel anything >> Sherlock replies, shaking himself from his numbness. Sketch a smile just looking at it.
<< But what Stockholm syndrome! >> he blurted out once they got out of that doctor's office, outside the hospital, one spitting sentences and the other lighting a cigarette. << I think that if your brother started screaming the name of his jailer, reiterating how much she needs his help, there must be a good reason behind >>.
<< One of the 'professionals' who holds the seminars. That's  the way they call themselves >> replies Sherlock.
<< Off the road, Greg. Sherlock ended up out of the way! Someone like him who dies from a banal car accident caused by snow! >> John shouts against the detective's shoulder, who just keeps him on his feet, unable to say anything.
"Fortunately I'm totally made of morphine!" he thinks, barely feeling a dull discomfort in his legs. It is as if he were watching a movie scene, one of those in 3D that lead you to experience the situation firsthand. Sherlock looks at his body with detachment, sees those hands drop on him, on the trolley that presses against his chest, but he feels nothing. The audio is an inarticulate mass of grunts, moans and screams that mingle with the rhythmic thuds of the fists.
<< You're trivial >> confirms John. << Why limit yourself to half the sky when you can have it completely? >>.
"Oh yes, finally some vitality! It's for something I said, isn't it? Something that has nothing to do with our Johnny-boy! "
John watch the flames dancing just as it did on Sunday morning. That morning, he shifted his gaze at almost regular intervals from the flames to the pleasantly asleep consultant on the sofa. John had spread a blanket over Sherlock, that he had snuck into. Sherlock had a serene smile on his face and slept as John had never seen him do in this long year of connivance.
<< Not at all >> Sherlock says and this time it's him to chuckle. << This story is anything but easy. The 'final problem', as you like to call it, may also have been created by my mother, but she is not the cause >>.
<< What's the problem? You know that when I investigate I don't sleep. And anyway, there is the sofa >> retorts, going back to reading.
<< Stop it with these bullshit! You have it and you already have also those who have set themselves the goal of burning it. So stop being a drama queen and be careful >>.
<< John, I'm almost certain that there is no aggressor and that guy died from subjecting his body to excessive stress. It was too warm in that place >>.
<< Lestrade! >> shouts Sherlock, who gets up hurry and, taking Greg by surprise, grabs the detective by the collar of his jacket. << There was no news about the discovery of the son of the Ford, right? >>.
<< Hey, why don't you take it? >> William asks him in amazement. The puppy starts to growl. A deep, guttural sound that is barely audible. The child approaches him, looking around.
<< Sure! Come on Captain Morgan >> he shouts loudly and the puppy happily follows him up the stairs.
<< It is not a good thing, Eddy, no, no! >> Sherlock says and then explode into a loud laugh. He laughs, feeling his aching throat, his stomach too full, his broken leg that seems to have woken up only now and his urethra on fire.
The consultant comes out of the dressing room with the intention of going away from there, but finds his way blocked by a little man with a notable belly and a shiny bald head. This man looks at Sherlock with huge eyes, visibly upset.
<< Quiet and balanced much more than the two of you >> retorts Greg, approaching the door. << I think it will be more useful than I am at the Diogenes Club >>.
<< Very gladly, madam >> Sherlock replies satisfied. << I think you are doing the right thing, Ms O'Hara >> adds, tearing from the woman a sob which is not followed, however, other tears.
Sherlock told to Fox about the doctor in the e-mails that have been exchanging periodically since, years before, he collaborated with him and his colleagues in Madrid.
As Sherlock had foreseen, nothing good could bring him the long presence of morphine in the body. If in a person who has never used drugs, addiction and abstinence come much later, in those who, on the other hand, have already experienced its joys for a long time,  the pains come much earlier. The painful grasp Sherlock feel in the belly is nothing more than the bite of abstinence.
<< At this time, however, it would have been more difficult not to be indicted. I don't want you to go to jail because of me, John >> Sherlock says taking care of the other hand, the left one, where the grazes are greater.
"Who knows where in your Mind Palace you took refuge to seek comfort" John thinks every time he sets his eyes on Sherlock's face. Intimately and completely selfishly, he hopes to have been and still be by his side in that imaginary place. Because he saw the same serene expression on Sherlock's face that Sunday morning and these Holmes repeat all the time that the universe is never so lazy as to produce coincidences.
<< I help him in the investigation, Annette >> John replies, punctuating her name with a little too much acidity.
<< Lizzy ... what happened? >> Greg just whispers. The girl shakes her head vigorously and Greg is unable to insist. He turns his gaze to his son, who watches the scene from the furthest point of the room, but he also knows that he will not get any answer from him.
<< That there is nothing wrong with sharing a cigarette >> Sherlock replies, by taking a mouthful and then blowing the smoke away. John has to admit it's a somewhat erotic scene, but he immediately shakes off that completely out of place thought. Sherlock extinguishes the cigarette that has just started and throws it away along with the whole package. He stop a taxi with his usual tried and tested gesture and let them take them to Baker Street.
<< I know, I know, you are not a couple >> Angelo says with a wink. << Can I bring you the dish of the day? >>.
<< I'm sorry to tell you, but if things are really like this, it is more likely that Mr Holmes has already been buried somewhere >>.
John blinks several times in amazement at Sherlock's incredulous expression. He laughs then, amused, shaking his head.
He was always ready to put his hands in front of someone who dared to say something unpleasant about Harriet's lifestyle choices. John gave and took many to defend her. Both from direct actions and from simple insults in her absence. He may say, perhaps, that he experienced bullying for third parties, if this ever exists. John's sister apparently kept up with insults, threats, teasing and even attempts at violence by the macho on duty ready to convert the cursed lesbian. It has been a tough years for John and he can only imagine what someone with Sherlock's character and ways did not experience at school. John perhaps too often forgotten that the brilliant consulting detective was also a boy and a teenager.
James grabs both of Sherlock's wrists and jumps towards him. Sherlock cannot keep his balance and together they fall into the pit. This, however, is much more profound. Infinity. They fall down for a time that seems eternal, a time in which Sherlock has only the mad smile of his archenemy before his eyes.
Dry blows break the whistling of the wind. They don't even bother Sherlock anymore. They have become part of the context, now.
<< Have you been away? You too? >> John asks incredulously, collapsing on the armchair in front of the desk. << Jesus, I can't believe it. We all left him alone for a few days ... >>.
<< I have to fix a few things, before Gray kills me >> says Fox as they leave the silent club. << I will leave for Madrid tomorrow morning. Let me know if you join me or if you will join me later. And remember what I said, Billy >> Fox says, pointing his finger at him. The consultant nods embarrassed and the reporter chuckles shaking his head. Fox brings his hand to caress Sherlock's pale cheek and, with a tried and tested gesture that must be normal to each other, brings the consultant closer to him, by placing a kiss on his forehead.
<< Thank you for rescuing me >> he says, trying to start a conversation that can get him the information he needs to complete what he has already deduced.
John sees her swell more and more with anger, that she hold with increasing strength. Margaret will explode, John is sure of it, and it will be terrible. On Greg's tense face, standing a meter away from her, in the exact same position, John reads his own fear. The doctor looks at them and wonders how two people who have loved eachother and promised eachother 'eternal love' and who have brought two children into the world, now they have come to be unable to stay in the same room without risking sparks.
<< I am your friend! We are friends, Mary. The things I told you, my nightmares, my stories that went wrong, are true, Mary >>.
The year before William and his family had to leave for a long time and had left the house to the servants and Silver to a dogsitter. Mr Ford had many interviews before choosing Sharon, who was, despite her eccentric appearance, the only one without too many pretensions. To teach her the dog's habits, William spent a whole day with this woman that seems the double of  Harley Quinn. He didn't like her black humor and her shrill voice. After an initial suspicion, Silver  accepted her as temporary nanny and William had also tried to convince himself that he could be fine with her.
Stockholm syndrome. John reflects on the fact that, personally, he has never met anyone who was affected by it. Unfortunately people who have been subjected to torture, and which John has been taken care of them in the Afghan field hospital, have passed away.
A bell rings, announcing the beginning of this magical moment of the evening. Before entering the pool with the others, Sherlock sees Martin smiling blissfully from afar. Sherlock smiles in turn, venturing a wink to which the man replies by blowing a kiss.
"No. I don't want to steal anything else from you". Without looking back, John reaches the door and leaves the room.
<< Ok ok, stop by Jo and tell him to warn anyone who comes to him that we are looking for a man. Do you have a photo of Mr Holmes, Captain? >>.
John receives a message that distracts him from the abdominal pain that is coming to him by ruminating anger.
<< Honey, I assure you that it is the best compliment I could receive from him >> Greg reassures her. The smile that the detective gives to the consultant is so beautiful as to lead the latter to look away embarrassed. John realizes how important they are to each other and strangely his stomach is not pierced by any painful twinge. Indeed, he looks at them, moved and pleased. These two men so distant, but united by the love for the work they do. The constant struggle to try to bring the truth to the fore and make sure that justice is done is the quality that John lacks. John is used to obeying orders. To act even before thinking, both as a soldier and as a doctor. John realizes he has so much to learn from these men that he has the honor of being able to define friends. At least Greg for sure. As for Sherlock ...
<< Well >> she replies. << Really, John, I'm fine. I met a really nice girl and ... well, it seems to be working. And you? >>.
Behind them, Albert Ford exits the corridor, leaving the room that hosted them. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm supported by a bandage and he walks with difficulty.
The musician turns to them and John has to admit that he is beautiful. Long, smooth, blond hair, a tanned face with clear blue eyes. The ex-soldier is shaken by that moment of estrangement when he realizes that those sensual eyes are staring intensely at his flatmate. And to make matters worse, which amazes John even more, Sherlock returns his gaze with equal intensity.
<< You're really sick, poor dear >> Mary says, approaching him. She caresses Sherlock's wet head, almost completely returned to its original color. Sherlock indulges in those rough, ungainly caresses, but capable of cheering him up, like the hot water of the strange shower just taken. He finds himself tight in her warm embrace, his face resting on her prosperous chest. Sherlock surrounds her with his arms and a distant memory opens in his mind.
He will spend the night monitoring him and at the first doubt he will call an ambulance and do all the stories he wants.
<< I am not sure the jokes of homophobic troglodytes to worry me at the moment >> John says, finishing the medications. << So it should go. It is an emergency solution, however. Tomorrow in the hospital we will do better >> he says caressing Sherlock’s chin.
With a blow of a baseball bat, Sharon destroys one of the appliques and open with a kicks the bathroom's door. She checks in the shower cubicle and tears it to pieces, furious at yet another failure.
<< Damn bastard! >> se shouts, trying to take him off, but the puppy does not let go. William comes quickly out of the closet and, scared, observes the scene. The baseball bat that fell from Sharon's hand rolls towards him, like an invitation. The child frowns, grabs the bat and, with a real pirate cry, begins to hit the woman.
<< Do you understand what? >> asks John, realizing how his tone of voice has changed, which Sherlock has also noticed.
<< When Sherlock was hospitalized to dispose of the effects of cocaine addiction, he often saw his dog sitting at the bottom of the bed. At other times he ran away screaming in terror that a man intent on killing him was chasing him. There have been occasions when he attacked the nurses by calling them by the names of his former schoolmates who apparently bullied him. Once he hit me too ... >>.
The cell phone rings simultaneously with the scientific monitor. While the one highlights John's video call, the other lets Sherlock know the origin of yet another type of soil found under the sole.
John, how long could it last? Sherlock has an impossible character and your boundless patience would come to an end. It's easier to lose it when relationships get more intimate.  Would be logical the opposite, but it seems that this is not the case at all. You would have betrayed Sherlock, sooner or later, and he would have found out and it would have ended much worse. So I think your decision was the most sensible. Painful, I don't doubt it, and for both sides, but sensible >>.
<< I am sure the inspector will be happy to know that you flown down the cliff along with your uncomfortable deductions >>.
<< Come on, stay with me. I'll make you forget it >> she says mischievously, trying an extreme approach that John refuses, trying to keep the instinct at bay to push her away with a push.
<< I'm not sure >> Sherlock says, throwing his arms around John’s neck. << I'm afraid you have to try again >> he whispers.
<< Jawn >> he whispers, taking breath. The hiss of air entering him draws John to those lips. There are only them now. The lips that kisses, that bites and that smiles at him. Sherlock's fingernails that sink into the flesh. Sherlock's tapered fingers that ruffle his hair. Sherlock's long legs that squeeze his hips and John's desire to undress him and make him his. John want to do it right away, before that magic fades and they wake up from the dream.
<< The plaster at the base of the chandelier is chipped. There are pieces of one of the chandelier's  decorative crystals broken on the ground. The bullet broken it before to got stuck in the ceiling. Judging by the sign it left, the bullet seems small ... a blank pistol >> Sherlock says.
The two policemen look at each other in amazement. They move the doctor to check the rear seats and the trunk.
<< The staircase leading to the bedrooms upstairs >> answers Greg. Sherlock follows the path littered with trinkets and furnishings destroyed on the ground and stops in front of the staircase.
<< I was playing with my Lego Pirates and I heard the bell ring many times. I thought it was the cook, she always forgets something and always comes back to get it. I heard talk, but I didn't listen. Then the voices got louder, especially dad's. I think a firecracker went off. It scared me. I ran to the door, but then I heard mum scream the magic word and I hid in the closet. I saw that no one was coming but I was afraid to go out. Then I fell asleep and woke up when Morgan barked >> the puppy, called into question, makes his voice heard.
<< Listen to me >>, John growls, holding the man against the trunk of the tree, << I do not know how you behaves with friends, assuming you has someone, but I usually do not lose hope until I see the corps's lifeless with my own eyes! I fathomed the Afghan desert and the cities ruined by bombs in search of my fellow soldiers, when I was at war, and I never lost hope of finding them alive until, unfortunately, I found the opposite. I have rescued many, thanks to my lack of ability to resign myself to what that for you is an evidence! So now you'll do me the favor of stopping to break my balls and let me find my friend. And if you don't want to waste your breath and men to help me, go away with all your entourage. I am able to manage alone here >>.
<< There is an atmosphere far from pleasant here >> he says with a smile. << Your faces don't say anything good. What is happening? >>.
"Recently murdered" Sherlock deduces. He does not come close to the body. There is nothing he can do for that man, except deduce that he was killed by a close-up shot, which exploded by a person who was leaning against the car. Car owned by the deceased himself.
Mary knots in a convulsive way the ugly braid that she has been made today and that falls on her shoulder .
<< I was away for a whole week, engaged in a complicated negotiation aimed at avoiding the onset of a third world conflict, John >> informs him, leaning on the back of the armchair, his hands crossed on his belly. << You will excuse me if I didn't have time to check what you and my beloved brother were combining >>.
<< No! We are here on business. The rest is just a distraction from the crime investigation >> he says, taking a change of clothes.
<< I'm used to doing my own business, John. I don't care who goes to bed with whom and why, unless someone dead. So go slow, okay? >>.
<< If you know their existence it means that you have looked at them too >> John says, finally tearing the laptop from his hands. Sherlock tries to get it back, but John promptly locks his hands and back against the seat of the sofa.
<< Jesus! >> Sherlock mumbles, struggling to take the long breaths that have help  him to quell panic. Sherlock massage his face hard.
<< Apparently Sherlock received a phone call on Wednesday 9th late in the morning. A number whose area code appears to be from the Cumbria region. It belongs to Hugh Paddington,  the owner of the Lake District Ski Club >>.
John observes that beautiful outstretched hand. Here is the demonstration of what he was trying to explain to Sherlock. When they are separated, nobody mistakes him for Sherlock Holmes' 'partner'. When they are far away, this kind of pleasant and unexpected thing happens.
Sherlock proceeds John swiftly up the 17 steps of Baker Street. John immediately noticed how fast Sherlock is to walking with crutches. John looked bad when i walked with that old stick and was slow as a turtle. The doctor sighs, realizing how even in these conditions Sherlock manages to be better than him.
<< Yes, you're right. Knowing Sherlock, things won't change. You, however, hope so. Sorry if I tell you, but this is also a low blow on your part >> he says standing up. << I saw Sherlock half killed by drugs, John. You have spared this part of him, but I have known him with arms full of holes and pupils like suckers. I wouldn't have bet a penny, yet it was enough for me to throw a proposal, 'if you stop with this stuff I will allow you to collaborate with me' and he did it. Sherlock made a serious effort and did it. Mycroft himself thanked me for saving his brother. I'm convinced that was Sherlock who saved himself, but if a really small part of success depended on me, then I'm proud of it and it pisses me deeply to think that, because of you, he can throw everything away, John! >>.
<< Not one, Sherlock was categorical! >>. Mrs Hudson looks carefully the top of the stairs and then wispers. << I gave one to him when Sherlock didn't looks to us >> .
John smiles satisfied and goes to the kitchen for a well-deserved breakfast. He puts on the tea, takes his cup, the packet of biscuits from under the cupboard and places everything on the kitchen table. John leans on the sink drinking and eating standing up and looks at Sherlock absorbed in his thoughts. Although they are far apart, the first thing he finds in Sherlock are any signs that the hours of passion have left on him white skin. Strangely, John doesn't find any. Of course it doesn't mean anything, not everyone likes them or everyone doesn't doing them in clearly visible places. Someone like Sherlock, then, so attentive to detail, certainly would not tolerate such a visible brand on his immaculate skin.
Mary opens the front door and drags him out of the house. The cold envelops Sherlock, piercing his flesh like a thousand pins. Sherlock starts shaking like a leaf and chattering his teeth. Deaf of the complaints that the consultant involuntarily produces, Mary lifts him off the ground and throws him with no grace inside the van. Stay still with her hand clinging to the door handle.
Sherlock intercepts John’s hand and examines its wounds. He also takes the other and studies them for a few moments. Sherlock’s hands are cold, a sign of blood circulation that is not working as it should. John is about to point it out, but the sentence dies on his lips when he sees Sherlock grab the disinfectant. He pours some onto a cotton ball and gently dabs the wounds that McNeel's beating left on John’s knuckles.
Sherlock's stomach contracts horrified. He would like to let her know that he is involved in solving a case and that he usually does not eat when he works, as digestion slows him down. Something tells him, however, that it is better not to start arguing with this woman.
<< Mr. Fox >> resumes Mycroft. << It is useless for me to tell you that I do not approve in the least the methods that you, your boss and your colleagues are used to implementing. However, I think this situation is absolutely exceptional and only and exclusively for this reason will I allow you and that cybercriminal of your colleague to access the government main frame. I want it to be clear that, when the case is closed, all the passwords will be changed and any attempt to force it on your part will be prosecuted, at the risk of compromising the diplomatic agreements that we have had with your government for years >>.
The woman enters Ford's room and checks under the bed and behind the curtains. She opens the closet doors, but does not find the child and angrily destroys the large decorated mirror. Some splinters hit her face, but the long trail of blood that runs down her cheek does not stop her hunt.
<< Well, tell them not to touch anything. I will get to work just finished this little experiment >>.
<< We are stuck here, Greg. We too >> mutters, heartbroken. << I was an idiot to get you involved, but I really hoped to get some more information by coming here >>.
<< Ah, you are here! >> Lestrade goes to meet them. << The body is in the morgue. As soon as I get the results, I'll let you know. Do you have any news? >>.
<< Yes >> Mary agrees. Bring her other hand close to Sherlock's face and lightly wipe away his tears. << Even my dad was bad. And my brothers too. Also my mom, to be honest >> adds Mary, as if she realized it now.
<< So what are you going to do?  You want to isolate yourself, stop your work and retire to a deserted island where you won't be able to ... harm anyone? >>.
<< Yes. It was my favorite game. I had built a tricorn hat and a wooden sword. Red Beard and I ran together in the garden of Musgrave, the house where I grew up. We played together for five years. Dogs' life is too short, John. Or maybe humans's life is too long >>.
<< He is not dead, Mycroft. I feel ... yes, I feel it. He's still alive, Mycroft. One like Sherlock is not killed so easily >>.
<< A big mess going on for years, John >> replies all happy, which is rather inconvenient, given the case. << That pit seems being the dump of a serial >> Sherlock adds, his fingers joined under the satisfied smile that illuminates his face. << I did well to accept >> he nods pleased with himself.
<< I thanked God for putting you on my way, Mary, and for allowing me to be here today, alive >> he says, putting on his face the sad and devoted expression and the smile embarrassed, which Mary's likes so much. In fact, the woman nods contentedly and the corners of her mouth lean slightly upwards.
<< I'm sorry that things didn't go well, Mr. Holmes >> says the director, visibly proven by what he heard.
John can't take his eyes off her. This woman have a face so strange and a body so massive as to arouse a curiosity without any education, John realizes it, but difficult to drive back down.
<< I think that no one is ever really in the silence in a city >> she says, pulling out one of those sensible reasonings that Sherlock recently discovered the child Mary knows to do.
<< He took advantage of you, of your moment of weakness. I can't  tolerate it! >> John says, hitting the Martin's genitals with his heel. He shouts, instinctively bringing the hands to the groin. He turns over on his side moaning in pain.
<< Mary! >> exclaims sitting down too quickly. A dizziness forces him to go back down. << Jesus, for a moment I thought I had just recovered from an overdose >>.
Their eyes remain hooked again. No, he's not making fun of him. John doesn't even know why he came up with that statement.
<< Where do you think you are, Sherlock? >> Mycroft asks, taking him by surprise. Sherlock looks at him more carefully and then turns his gaze to the room. Suddenly the memory of what he has experienced explodes in the mind's eyes.
<< There is something different, in fact >> admits John. << We have become the dads of this puppy >>.
<< Just get organized, John >> says Sherlock, yawning. The doctor chuckles. Sherlock is organized only when he works on cases and when he arranges his folders.
<< I ... I liked the idea of having you with me in a situation that did not involve investigations and murders. To be together like two friends in a pub over a beer. Every time I tried to get you involved in one of the usual outings with Greg there was no way to convince you. I saw that Bryan was exaggerating, but I couldn't stop him. It bothered me to see how him was on you and in the end I dragged you away because I had enough. I realized too late that I had made a terrible mistake. I haven't protected you, I realize it, and I have no excuses. Even for having… for not stopping while knowing you are drunk I have no excuse >>.
<< She is not stupid >> Sherlock whispers, finally speaking. Moriarty approaches him curiously. << Mary is not stupid >> Sherlock repeats, looking him in the face. << She had a terrible family of killers, but, because she having eliminated them, people will say that she is the mad and bloody murderer. Nobody will stop to think that she has suffered the worst abuses every day, every night. That, if she created different personalities, she did it only to try to survive. People will see her for what she appears: a gigantic, disturbing woman. The disarming tenderness in her will not make the news. The crystalline voice with which she sings is not interesting, as is her laughter. Better to underline the monster, to describe all the most macabre details of her murders. Her  family humiliated her, segregated her, enslaved her and raped her, but this will not make the news! >> Sherlock ends with clenched teeth.
<< As a doctor I would advise you to carry out a series of check-ups. Simple routine tests, which, however, I imagine you have never done. It is possible that it all started with a drop in pressure caused by the excessive heat present in the sauna, already when we went here for the first time. The situation has worsened and now you are struggling to recover and I believe that the trauma of what has happened to you also has something to do with it. You are a human being, Sherlock, but put your body to constant stress of sleep and food deprivation. There is not only the head, you know? The machine, as you call your body, is important, otherwise the head does not turn >>.
The girl nods in amazement. She blinks on his eyes full of makeup, incredulous in front of the perfect analysis made by the consultant.
<< So, Doctor, do you want connoting my brother emotionally? >> Mycroft chuckles and anger mounts in John's belly.
<< I'm sorry I can't help you this time, Greg >> whispers and the detective deflates in front of his strategically submissive tone.
<< It's for a good cause, Mycroft >> John replies, annoyed by his tone. << That portal has already led too many young to commit suicide >>.
<< Oh! I knew! I knew that there was something! >> she screams cheerful like a child. << Don't let he go, Johnny >> adds serious.
<< Morgan has heard something. We must leave immediately! >> William says, looking at her with huge eyes. The girl is amazed. William is not an easily agitated child, accustomed as he is to his father's outbursts and that unhealthy family atmosphere. Sherlock Holmes' dog growls, then, looking at the door through which they have just passed.
<< I think you are still in time to enter to school at the second hour >> Sherlock says to the boy, standing up. George imitates him and so does John.
<< You found the place where Sharon brought the Fords thanks to the remains of dirt under a sole, Sherlock. You have also circumscribe it thanks to excerpts of stories >> John tries to calm him down.
His heart begins to beat wildly when he sees Sherlock walking towards him. John shifts the weight of his body several times from one foot to the other, feeling strangely uncomfortable. It is the first time, this one, that he will find himself talking to Sherlock face to face after that absent-minded kiss that he placed on Sherlock's forehead the night before. A trivial matter, which could also be considered normal between two friends. What harm is there, after all, in a gesture of affection? However, this is not their case. The tension between them is so high that it sometimes leads him to leave the house just to be able to breathe. Even now John wishes he could get out of that house, get away from him.
<< I knew I did well to convince her! >> she exclaims, clapping her hands against each other. << Molly is with him now? >> she asks and John expected everything except that she talking about the Bart's pathologist.
<< Sleeping pills. A whole bottle >> continues analytical Mycroft. << Fortunately, she got scared and sought help, finding that of her younger brother, equally scared >> he says, turning his gaze to Geore. Like his sister, the boy also looks away, frightened. << Two kids left to themselves, lost in the desperation of a world that collapses around them, in the absolute indifference of the adults present. Let me tell you, lady, that you are lucky >> says Mycroft, turning his icy gaze on Margaret. The woman, already devastated by what she has heard, looks at him with amazement. << You are lucky to have married an honest, balanced man with a solid morality and strong ethics. A man who didn't kill you as soon as he found out he was betrayed. He is a smart detective and if only he had wanted he could have made your body disappear or turned your death into an accident and be credible to the point of leaving himself clean. Only someone like my brother would have noticed his guilt, but I don't think he would have raised a finger against him >>.
The more her hands went down to the pelvis the, more discomfort had increased in Sherlock. The real panic had taken hold of him when he heard she say << Now that you are awake we can remove the catheter. You are perfectly capable of doing it in the 'parrot' >>.
<< Don't you think we should talk about what happened on Saturday, Sherlock? >> John asks him, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Damn manuals! They weigh a quintal and are worth a lot less” he thinks, turning the door knob, once he reaches the flat. He finds it closed, which is unusual. He has been living here for almost a year and never used the key once to open it. In fact, John looks for the key in the deck and must try a few before finding the right one. He peeks into the living room, looking around circumspectly. No trace of Sherlock.
<< It is fantastic! Grandma's house has a huge garden, we will have a lot of fun, you will see >> he says, taking the dog's paws in his hands. << And then, if Morgan's help is needed for the investigation, we can go together, right Sherlock? >>.
<< We found some Milton's manuscripts, whose central themes refer to what happened in the Ford's house in recent months: the killing of a dog, a vandal who breaks a windows with stones, anonimous rings inveterate stalker and a kidnapping >> .
Sherlock feels the body covered by a thousand pins that sting him at the same time. He just glances at John and then looks away.
Let the bow slide on the strings, his fingers nimble on the handle, in search of other vibrations. Different images appear at the eyes of his mind and Sherlock sends them all to the violin, transforming them into sounds and vibrations. Sometimes sharp and fast, other short and slow. Deep. Evocative.
<< What should I think then, John? That your distinguished colleague is right and that my brother has joined forces with the woman that tortured him? Honestly, I prefer him prey of hallucinations >>.
John starts to shake the woman who, however, wakes up on her own. She looks at him with different eyes, more sincere and young, like those of a little girl.
<< How about getting to know us better? >> asks Martin, but He doesn't waiting Sherlock's  answer and he rushes against him. Sherlock kicks him in the lower abdomen.
<< I could not have given a better answer. Except ... well, a son perhaps not, but a disciple yes. Someone to teach my work method, so that it is carried on and survives me >>.
<< Oh my God, Lestrade, how can you not understand it yet? >> Sherlock blurts, moving away from John. << Against the wall. A blocked arm. The face pressed against the wall so hard to creating a laceration to the right temple and, above all, the murderer's elbow pressed against the victim's collarbone for a time long enough to leave another mark! No, it's not about theft >> Sherlock scout. After a moment of confusion, Greg's face open in a comic expression of amazement. << Better late than never, Scotland Yard! >> Sherlock exclaims, waving his hand in an attempt to create some wind. << Will never understand if Howard Byron was consenting or not. Have your men collect all clothes and towels. You will surely find unequivocal body fluids there. Also on the body, of course. Cardiac arrest caught him before he could get into the shower, luckily for us >>. Sherlock hurries to get out of that warm and unnerving environment.
<< So, Mr. Fox, how is the operation? >> Mycroft question, which has not escaped his brother's attitude and the journalist.
<< Greg! >> exclaims Lestrade. << Try not to get killed. I would be sorry to see you load onto a black sack heading to the Bart's morgue >> he says returning to his men.
<< A Spa, Sherlock, is a wellness center, a place where people go to relax, do massages, the sauna, Turkish bath and many other things like this >>.
<< Guys can be bad, John. I don't know if you had the misfortune of being targeted by bullies at school. I assure you that it is not a good experience >> Sherlock whispers, taking the cell phone, just touching the doctor's hands, eager to keep them to himself.
<< Get me the phone records of the last two weeks of Sherlock's number and ask the technicians to let me have all the shots that concern him in the shortest possible time >> with a gesture of the hand Mycroft invites her to go. The woman nods, turns on her heels and leaves the room, obedient like a soldier.
He stands up and offers him his hand, but Sherlock puffs ignores it, determined to do it himself. The doctor lets him do it, aware of how this also serves to encourage him to take care of himself.
<< Greg is my friend, Sherlock, and his daughter got into a big bad trouble >> growls, clenching his fists. Anger begins to boil in John's contracted belly.
<< Your mother's novel talk about a woman obsessed with religion, who becomes a serial killer. She says that she is a merciful mother sent by God to punish sinners. Trivial, obvious plot. I'm sure that if your mother has success only because she is your father's wife,  >> Sharon says, climbing the stairs slowly.
Sherlock and John exchange a long look. In that silent exchange of glances, the speech mentioned in the cab finds a tacit agreement.
<< Do you find it admirable? >> acid question John, annoyed by the ecstasy he feels in Sherlock's voice.
<< Yes >> the man answers. << The weather alert is such that even the snow sweepers have been called up. People have been invited for four days to stay indoors. We got used, Dr. Watson. I thought your friend had been a fool, but seeing you I realize that he wasnt' the only! >>.
The latest case kept them busy for a whole week. This week John didn't sleep, he ate badly, screamed a lot and ran like crazy to stay behind his flatmate's long tireless legs. He used his faithful gun many times, and he just wanted to be able to go back to 221B, take a hot shower and jump into bed.
<< No >> whispers, however, this time, also abandoning the last supply of air. << No >> he repeats, fearing to die in the grip of the fist of a god-fearing woman, with the mission of eradicating the homosexual scum from the face of the earth.
<< Oh yes, Mr. Holmes >> laughs softly. << When I saw Sharon hit Albert, shouting at him confident and fearless orders I said to myself that I too could find the strength to react. And doing it requires a good dose of madness. I've had enough of Albert's constant reproaches, devaluations and immense ego! I can take care of myself and I am economically able to support both me and my son. As far as possible, I will try to do everything in a civilized way. I don't want to give a bad example to my son and Albert is still his father >>.
<< You have your extraordinary deduction, my love >> John sighs, rolling his eyes. << Let's go or Greg will not forgive us >> John adds, standing up. Morgan bark and goes to the door. He sits, waiting patiently that his humans be ready to start this new game.
<< You mean he went there just to kill the dog? >> asks incredulous Greg. Sherlock and William nod in unison and Morgan barking.
The bell rings and Lestrade's fast steps announce his arrival. He knocks on the door before entering and John sees him looking at them in amazement at finding them so close.
<< There, however, how is it going? >> John asks him with a nod of chin to Fox, concentrated on the laptop screen.
<< I did not want you to suffer because of me >> sobs the girl, sinking her face in his hand that gently caresses her. The dark hand of Greg against the pale make-up skin of his daughter creates a marked contrast.
<< Yes. I know, instead, that it wasn't you. You were too young when the murders started. You can't have taken part in it >>.
The worst part is that John cannot stop this indecent flow of forbidden thoughts now that he perceives him as available and potentially interested.
<< Fortunately then you met Molly >> Mary told him at the end of these stories about dreams about John. Sherlock noticed a sadness on Mary's face so deep as to soften him.
These, like a curtain, just leave a window open to show the heavily make-up eyes with a thick layer of dark pencil and rimmel, the face made even more pale by the face powder and the mouth colored by a black lipstick. A necklace obtained from a strip of leather cut in several points wraps her neck falling softly on the perfect small breast, tightened by a black bodice with burgundy inserts. A soft skirt surrounds her thin waist by falling irregularly in the middle of the toned thighs covered by tights torn in several places. Now John understands why Sherlock hired a punk to stay behind the girl.
<< I hope more interesting than mine! >> snorts, pulling inside the suitcase. He opens it in the center of the living room, tired of making it take another step. John pull out the manuals, given as a tribute to the emergency medicine refresher course he attended in these five days spent in Dublin, and some books purchased by hiself.
<< Sharon Milton, I declare you under arrest for the kidnapping of the Ford spouses and for the attempted murder of their son William >> Greg recites approaching Sherlock. << Ok, now leave her to me, Sherlock >> says to the consultant, who does not seem in the least intent to free the woman.
<< If you had told me such a thing before Morgan entered our lives, I would have laughed a lot >> sighs John. << Now, however, I agree with her >>.
“Who cares, Johnny? Are you happy? Then it's okay! " retorts Harriet in John's head. His sister was very present in his thoughts. From the moment they found Rosaline's body and, unlike the pangs in the stomach totally cured by Sherlock's kisses and caresses, Harry's voice persists. Evidently she has something more to say to him. John does not like the idea of getting out of the warm bed and the scent of Sherlock that surrounds him, but he feels he must end this story.
"This woman is a tough nut to crack, Sherlock," John breaks in, warning him. "You could hit her and even seriously hurt her, but, before she even die or lose consciousness, Mary will have time to tear the razor from your hands and slice your throat or kill you with her bare hands."
<< About your girlfriend >> she insists. Sherlock have the perception to find himself in front of a curious and impertinent six-year-old girl.
<< It can happen to be injured during an investigation, director. This is the unexpected of the trade >> Sherlock replies, sketching a smile.
Sherlock remains motionless, looking at the door. He realizes once again how tense he when that woman corrupts the air with her presence.
<< 54 suicide cases of young people aged 13 to 20 of both sexes linked to this site in Spain. Other cases in France and Germany. It's crazy >> John whispers as he begins to see the exaggerated scope of this portal's action.
<< As your doctor, given your conditions I should make you give up taking any type of physical activity >> John says distancing himself from Sherlock.
One of the fictitious names of Sherlock Holmes. This is what he assumes at the end of the book 'Seven percent solution' by Nycholas Meyer
John agrees with Mycroft in thinking that only thanks to Greg's loving presence will his children come out a little bruised but substantially unharmed from this bad experience. John would never have imagined finding such comfort even for himself in Mycroft's words. Words that, although they were not addressed directly to him, he had been waiting for years. The stomach has stopped hurting him and has relaxed. Finally, after so many days, it is giving him a breather.
<< Why did she beat you? >> he asks, stunned by her wrong way of telling these things. She should cry, be sad or at most toneless and expressionless and instead she laugh, smile and embarrass herself.
<< I'm not a cop, Mary. I am only a person who can observe and deduce. It is my sentence >> Sherlock notes, now leaning against the door, that in these long hours of pain has often been struck by the big hands of the evil-mary.
"Quite the opposite, Greg, far from it!" John thinks, but it's just a sigh that he misses. Greg looks at him curiously but says nothing more. They are there, both with their elbows resting on their knees, staring at the bed in front, while the wind dominates out there. It insinuates itself into the fixtures. It produces shout-like sounds.
John then went on to evaluate who could have helped Sherlock or where he could have gone to, in case he was able to walk on his legs. There were only four houses in the area and none in the immediate vicinity. Certainly reachable by a man in full physical strength even at that time, but by the condition of the passenger compartment and the amount of blood found inside the car, Sherlock seemed to be in bad conditions.
The man gasps against Sherlock's ear until his verses turn into a muffled cry against his neck. Something hot pours on Sherlock's abdomen, while his assailant slows down more and more until he stops.
He puts his hand on the girl's hay-blonde hair, so similar to his in a past age. John pushes the hand away after that light caress, closing it in a fist as he moves away from the girl.
<< Fantastic! >> exclaims John, who for the first time see the skill's Sherlock in disguising himself by changing his physiognomy completely. John swallows several times, embarrassed by the half-erection he feels pressing against the flap of his trousers .
<< The situation >> he answers, keeping his eyes down on the massage he is carrying out on Sherlock's wrist.
<< Okay, but few. He is still a puppy and it is not good for him to eat too much food other than his >>.
A single bed very similar to the one used in hospitals, a poor art style wooden bedside table with a green fringed bedside lamp and a desk on the opposite wall. The chair has been moved near the bed to accommodate the person who brought Sherlock there.
John arrives in front of the indicated door. From the porthole takes a look into the interior of a large room where there are several women. Some sitting around tables, others standing talking in groups, others alone. Mary stands tall and powerful among all the others. She wears the blue uniform given by the structure and that is decidedly narrow and short of sleeves and legs for her.
<< I know it well, brother >> Sherlock replies angrily. << Mary, however, had no other way but to do herself justice. Hataway would not have believed her and asking for her help would only have led her to be thrown into the pit for having risked ruining family affairs. That madman of his older brother, Freddie, did nothing but threaten her by saying this >>.
"No? So who did it, Sherlock? Aren't you going to tell me that you are also the type of person who, after the first time, starts to give it away without any mercy? Take a look at how quickly you can go from to be a virgin to to be a whore. "
<< I didn't do anything exceptional >> Sherlcok mumbles embarrassed, motionless in the strong arms that hold him.
<< Oh, it saved us the trouble of sending you to call >> Sherlock tells him. The master stiffens, worried. Watch Martin on the floor which, with the help of two agents, is now trying to get back on its feet.
<< I'm really sorry >> mutters to himself and maybe Greg hears it too, but decides not to give him rope.
<< Me too >> echoes Greg, getting up in turn. << Those bastards you caught have a scary list of precedents! The detention has been validated and I think they will be guests of the prisons for a long time. You have to go to the police station for the deposition. All of you >> Greg says, looking them in the eyes one by one.
<< What else happened after Silver's death? >> Greg asks William. The detective now realize that the boy is a valuable collaborator in the investigation.
<< Do not leave me >> John whispered to him like a mantra, holding Sherlock close to him. << It doesn't matter if you'll never want to see me again, I accept it, but don't leave me. Don't make me live in a world where you are not there, please >>.
The voice of Mary- child calls Sherlock from his Mind Palace. He has no idea how much time has passed since the  evil-Mary locked him in there. He only knows that the morphine is over and that the abstinence crisis has started and is currently at its peak. He finds himself surrounded by his own vomit. He lying in the urine and stools that he has not even realized he has evacuated. Chills and cold sweats run from Sherlock's head to toe.
