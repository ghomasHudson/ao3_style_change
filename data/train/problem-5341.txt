“This is Dr. Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme and retired neurosurgeon,” she continued and Strange nodded. “And Spider-Man, who I’m sure you’ve already met. There are others waiting inside, but you’ll be introduced later.” Spider-Man waggled his fingers in an imitation of a wave.
There was an outcry from Steve and his team. Danvers held her hand up for silence. “Please wait until I am finished to comment.”
“Don’t tell mom not to use her language, it makes up fifty percent of her vocabulary,” Clint pesters cheekily. Tony opens his mouth to reprimand him, before what Clint said catches up to him.
“Right,” Tony says when it becomes clear no one else is going to speak. “Hop to it.” The three scramble off, and Tony pat’s Steve’s arm, ignoring the way the muscles flex under his hand. God, he has a problem. “Thanks Captain Dad.”
”Hmmm,” Toni hummed, finishing off her mug. She grabbed a banana from the bowl next to the coffee maker. “So Angel’s family apparently doesn’t notice the hostility between the young man and Angel, or don’t care. They push her out, and accept Hate into the group, not that they know who either of them are because Angel never told them about herself. They never asked either. Peace leaves Angel alone with them because he can’t handle Hate. Death’s Uncle leaves as well, not that Angel really cared about him anymore now that he sent her to his niece. The only good thing that came out of the battle was that Angel got another son, more like a grandson, from Love. His gift was Kindness.
On the very right was Spider-Man, visibly bouncing on his toes in excitement. He was in full uniform, much to Steve’s displeasure. How could the team trust someone in a mask? He added ‘
“What happened,” Tony growls at the principal, as the door opens and he steps. The man’s stride falters when he notices who exactly is in his office.
“Aye,” Thor rubs the back of his head sheepishly. “The blame would lie on me. I had thought due to the cool temperatures of the ice box, it would aid in extinguishing the flames.”
With that, they rush off and Tony sighs in relaxation at the quiet. That is, until he’s pulled out of it later by the smell of something burning and the sound of Thor yelling and Clint screeching. He vaults off the couch into the kitchen to witness the refrigerator, microwave, and sink on fire. Thor’s running around like a chicken with his head cut off, Clint’s cursing while trying to bat the flames of the microwave away, and Natasha’s trying to put pot lids over the burning stove. Bruce snatches a fire extinguisher off of the wall and sprays down the whole mess with white foam, coating everything including the people.
Both Clint and Thor start to fidget under the ‘Captain America is disappointed in you’ glare. Even Natasha, usually unflappable, looks a little uneasy.
“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Steve starts lowly, and despite him not raising his voice, it cuts through the argument like a hot knife through butter. “Tony’s right, you do need to learn to clean up after yourselves. Starting right now, you three are on gym duty. There are weights that need to be put back, mats that need to be spray-cleaned, and machines to wipe down. I’m sure you can find something to clean. When you’re done you can go around the tower and pick up your stuff. Does that seem fair?”
”Stop, we don’t need to make a scene,” she murmured quietly, but Steve’s enhanced hearing picked it up. “You can kick their asses later during training.”
He quickly scanned the small assembly before him. There was a tall blond woman, military judging by her stance, on the very left. Her pressed business skirt and suit combo along with the stern set to her mouth had Steve straightening his back involuntarily. She began to remind him of Peggy, so he quickly moved on.
The Uncle convinces her that they need her to show off her newest creation of destruction, so she heads out. She’s supposed to be safe, and feels so confident she chooses a different wagon than her brother to ride in. Mistake. She is attacked by her own weapons and taken prisoner. Except there’s poison in her heart now. So she goes through open heart surgery without anesthesia so that they can slow the poison down. She eventually passes out just before they are finished.”
The click behind his head felt ominously final. When he swallowed, he felt the cold metal against his Adam's apple: not choking him, but impossible to ignore.
If he stayed here, he'd be raped again, an unknown number of times, by an unknown number of people, all while he was completely oblivious.
Stark held out his hand to the side, and one of the gauntlets flew back onto it. When he extended his index finger, it opened up, and something came telescoping out of it, a cross between a flashlight and a pen. But instead of of going for his ass, Stark pulled up a chair, and sat down right in front of him.
Here, the man actually paused, dick still buried inside Steve's ass, to listen to the patient explanations and snark that were tossed at him. Then he asked a followup question, with every sign of having forgotten about Steve in favor of arcane football rulings.
Yes, his arms and legs were tied, but the fact that Stark had even bothered did little to soothe his ego.
Dread pooled into Steve's stomach. He had no way to explain this, no way to fend off the punishment that was coming. What would he say, that some voice in his head had told him to, and he'd forgotten how not to obey every damn order that came his way?
Stark put that thing in him. It slid more easily than he'd expected; he'd forgotten that there was still lube left in him from the earlier fuck, his entrance still loose and sloppy. But that didn't mean the size wasn't an issue. His ass just wasn't built to accommodate the girth Stark was insistent on cramming into it, all the while saying bored "uh huh"s into his phone.
"Stark," said Steve, words slurred even to his own ears. "I, I understand what you're trying to tell me. Please, please stop this."
"I'm gonna put one on your pretty ass because you asked for it," Stark said. "But this is the official one. Don't move."
Steve broke the gaze first. He leaned into Loki's touch, and turned away from the pathetic figure on the bed.
He wasted a moment deliberating with himself, but it wasn't so much that had run out of choices—he had never even had one to start with, not since he'd arrived in this bleak future. If anything, it was either crawl in himself, or be tortured and then dragged in there. He honestly didn't know which was worse.
Hundreds of years, maybe. Long enough for the America that he'd fought for, that he'd sacrificed everything for, to have warped into the twisted dystopia he found himself in. There were other towering buildings all around, and he had the chilling thought that there might be slaves trapped in each of them, subjected to the same treatment as he was.
"Love the begging," said Stark. "But no. Jarvis, shock him if he tries to take it out. I gotta jet."
"Don't fight it," said the voice. The prince. "Ice can't hurt you. Far from it, ice can only rescue you from the pain."
And just now, him being fucked by this machine, whimpering, begging, crying out. He hadn't even known he'd been making those noises, he'd been so out of his mind.
A rough hand, nearly large enough to engulf both his wrists, pinning them down over his head. A second pressing down on the back of his skull, smothering his face into the the soft, sweat-damp surface beneath him.
"When they wake up, then," Stark sighed. Something else shifted below, and Steve's knees were drawn closer together, giving Stark better access to his entrance. "I don't need to hear what my new fucktoy thinks."
"Oddly appropriate," said the voice. "You may call me that, if you wish. Ice... Prince, let's say. You've caught my interest."
He felt like he had just escaped death, but Clint behind him showed no signs of caring, even picked up the pace.
It was that strange immobility that got to Steve. The way the pain showed only in the widening of Stark's eyes, while the rest of him was locked in place. The way even his jaw stayed clenched rigidly shut, unable to let out a scream, that made Steve nearly leap to his defense.
Like some kind of detective, he reached down between his legs. His dick was hard from the recent use, precome drying all over his belly, seeking relief. With some trepidation, he touched between his ass cheeks, and found his entrance inflamed and sore, still dripping with someone's spend.
By this point, anyone he ran into in these halls, on the street, might have used his ass, his mouth, and he wouldn't have the slightest clue of it.
Stark leaned back over him and picked up the rhythm, and Steve tried to convince himself that the obscene sounds he let out were a protest, not an encouragement.
"Jarvis, why?" he said, getting back mindlessly on his hands and knees. His right hand was still wet with his spend, but he didn't have time to do anything about it. The timer was still running, he was going to be shocked
"Tell you what," Stark said, after watching him struggle for a while. He'd cleaned himself off, pulled his pants back up, redid his belt. He didn't even look ruffled. "I put that thing on you to show the world you're mine. You let me put my brand on you instead, I'll think about taking the collar off."
Exhaustion quickly took him, dragged him back down. He faded, even as the rocking, ravaging sensation went on.
It was like that every time he woke. Brief snatches of awareness, body thrown into a different position each time, fucked at a different angle. Was it all one interminable session, or had he been in this limbo for the eternity that it felt like?
Steve didn't imagine for a moment that it was for his own comfort, but he was grateful nonetheless. Eased up, dragging blessed air in through his nose, and began to suck on the head instead, letting the taste of it flood his mouth. It wasn't cold like he'd expected, but burning hot, heavy on his tongue. When he lapped at it, running his tongue underneath the ridge, the hand tightened again, and he flinched.
Instead of getting his bearings, instead of searching for an escape, the first thing Steve found himself doing, given the opportunity, was to mindlessly grab it, and began jacking himself off. Eagerly parting his thighs, he spilled himself onto his ass—and gasped, as the floor pressed the plug deeper into him.
Steve waited for the order to turn over, present his other end, but instead Loki went for his gashed arm, still bleeding sluggishly, and ran his cool palm over that too. The leaking blood slowed, and then stopped entirely. Before his eyes, the flesh began to knit together, until it was unblemished and whole.
"Something's not right," someone was saying, the next time Steve washed up against the shore of consciousness.
Just testing out the waters on my first Whumptober. I have vague plans to expand this story to cover all the days in order, but maybe that's a little ambitious. Feedback is very welcome!
Steve thought his body should have fought back more, but he was limp with exhaustion, Stark had prepared him well, and the cock slid home like he'd been made to take it.
Stark went to the cart with all the toys again, and Steve could have wept. Wasn't it enough? Was Stark really going to keep at it? How much could a human body take?
"I don't think all these people could be colluding to make this up," said someone else. The hand-jobs man.
With his mouth forced open like this, he'd fully expected it to be put to use. The anticipation was, somehow, worse.
He brought the box to the door, where he dumped the careful assembly out onto the carpet. Began to arrange them, with his artist's sensibilities, into a subtle, delicate piece, right where Stark would see it upon entry. Soon enough, he had the ten toys arranged to spell out the letters F, U, along with an exclamation point, using the bottle of lube as the dot.
"After all that," said Stark slowly, rubbing his erection over Steve's face, smearing the come everywhere. "Running on empty. And just being used was enough to get you off. You really can't tell me you weren't made for this now."
Instead of another strike, it was Stark's hand that fell onto his shoulder, but he still jerked and whimpered at the touch.
Even when Clint pulled him back in close, long enough to finish jerking himself off, spilling his seed on Steve's chest and stomach.
When the whipping stopped, it took him a long while to realize it. His nerves still wept, and his jaw was still tightly clenched, waiting for the next blow.
His eyes snapped open, and the realization hit him just a few seconds before his orgasm did. As Stark rammed into him, gagging him, springing tears to his eyes, Steve gave a muffled cry, and came, with Stark's cock stuffed down his throat.
This treatment proved it, that he was utterly helpless, his body just a thing for Stark to use. The terrible fate Stark was describing, Steve had no way to avoid it, no hope of escape, and as Stark continued to fuck into him, somehow
Stark seemed to read his mind. "Nuh-uh, I'm not going to touch you. Gonna make you come from my cock alone. You don't think you can, right? You think only a whore would come from being degraded like this, fucked like this, used like this? Well guess what? That's what you are. That's what you were made for."
Without warning, the collar loosened, just enough to give him a little sliver of breath, and then it tightened again. Steve jerked himself against the cage, manacles clattering, muscles working frantically, trying futilely to throw Stark off, pull his hands to his throat, anything.
But then the machine entered him again. Somehow, as every time before, it awakened something in him, his cock filled again, a heat suffusing his every limb, and even the pain began to feel good.
If Stark had wanted a serious blowjob, Steve would have put in the effort, would have sucked and licked to the best of his abilities, though he'd never done it before, and only had the foggiest idea of how. Anything, to get the hand on his raging erection that he so desperately needed.
"That's it. Keep these tits held out for me." Clint pulled back, and gave the abused nipple a sharp, stinging slap.
"There, see?" said Stark triumphantly. "Things are different, in this day and age. A guy with a shield isn't going to much good against drones and missiles. This is the best way you can serve your country now."
"Why don't you shock me?" said Steve nastily, giving up on that particular window, and moving back out to the bedroom.
Steve cringed away from the vision. He'd thought he'd left Stark behind at last, but if even being stabbed through the chest didn't do it—
He'd never be able to prove that Buck was still alive, somewhere, like his heart was telling him—if he'd survived the train, he was surely dead now, of old age, just like Peggy, just like everyone else from that time.
"Master Stark says he still owes you a punishment for taking out your plug without permission," Jarvis piped up. "However, if you prepare yourself for him today, you'll be, in his words, "square"."
Steve could only let out a terrified grunt, as the robot penis breached him. It was cold and smooth, inhumanly hard. It felt clinical and invasive, more like a medical procedure than a sexual act. "Please," he tried again, "don't let this thing fuck me. I'll do whatever you want."
Steve sits Tony upright with a slightly amused and indulging look on his face. “If that’s your standards of a father, I don’t have to work too hard.”
ending. He’s about to ask who the person in the story was, when a shower of golden sparks drew his attention. The sparks formed into a ring, and Strange stepped through dressed in a sharp business suit, color matching Toni’s. The flying cape floated in after him, and the portal closed.
”Miss Maximoff,” Strange commanded sternly. “That is strike one. Two more and I will be forced to take action and bind your powers.”
And she lets him finish, let’s him get out all of his anger, and picks herself up and leaves when he tells her to. She falls into the arms of the butler that is more of a father to her than her biological one is, and dies.”
”I suppose so,” Strange sighed. He opened another portal, this time showing an empty boardroom on the other side. Toni strutted over to him and they exchanged a brief kiss.
Steve thought. Then he was distracted by a flash of light on her wrist. It was a simple black metal band, probably black plated gold, but Steve noticed that everyone else beside her had one too.
Steve couldn’t bring himself to chide the archer. He had received divorce papers from Laura a week before their scheduled departure. Poor Clint had been reasonably upset, vowing to get revenge on Toni and keep his wife safe from the playgirl’s ‘influences.’ Steve hoped that what he implied wasn’t the case, but Toni did have a reputation of taking women in a relationship to bed.
seen some sense. Presidential pardons were issued to the team, and after a whole year in Wakanda they could return home. T’Challa’s generosity had been great, but it just wasn’t the Compound. The young king had held a meeting and mentioned something about the Accords, new members, and a probation time, but Steve hadn’t really been paying attention.
”No shit, Sherlock,” Clint grouched, and for some reason Toni and Stephen shared a small smile. “What?”
“I swear to god, if you say boys will be boys I will repulser your ass,” Tony snaps, pointing his finger at the father threateningly. “I should know what boys act like, I have three at home.” Belatedly he realizes that was poor wording in regards to Bruce, Thor, and Clint, and that the tabloids tomorrow will probably be filled with headlines about his mystery children, but it fits. “This was harassment, clear and simple, and I will press charges if forced. Am I clear?”
“What the hell happened in here?” Tony snaps, and all four adult-children jerk around to stare at him, extinguishing foam making their eyes seem manic.
“He can hold full conversations without realizing it, and then gets confused when we bring it up to him later because he doesn’t remember it,” Bruce adds sagely. “We almost burned down the kitchen once because of it.”
Angel stops making weapons, and finds out the enemy got the supplies from her Uncle. He tries to kill her, but she succeeds in taking him out. And the shadows tell her he got a special place in Hel, right next to her father. The war calms down just a little bit more.
Strange himself flicked his hands at the young girl and golden whips shot out. They wrapped around her wrists and ate away at the magic pouring from them.
Now, the soldier finds out his dragon is alive.” Toni cut herself off. “Wait, you kinda need to know about dragons before I continue. In short, a dragon bonds with the first person it sees after birth. Nothing can break that bond. Capiche?”
”Care to introduce us?” Natasha asked, stepping forward and gesturing to the group around the billionaire.
Toni jerked violently, even as the red mist bounced of a golden shield around her that had most definitely not been there before.
Steve and the others hadn’t seen Scott since then, and the other residents of the Compoud hardly more than that. Needless to say, Steve was surprised when Toni entered the cafeteria at five in the morning, obviously dressed for a day of business. She had on a navy suit, sleeve reaching her wrists, makeup done flawlessly, and tinted sunglasses perched on the crown her hair was arranged into. Steve couldn’t help but focus his attention on the black gold band still around her wrist. She adjusted her bra and headed towards the coffee maker.
Famine strikes. Angel tries to get her family to move out of the hunger torn area. She got an offer from a village a little way away. They had plenty of food to spare. She begins convincing her dysfunctional family to go. Make sense?”
Natasha shrugged a little, and they both stared at the stack of envelopes. “A lot of invitations, a lot of very thick letters and envelopes. Should we contact the guardian, set up a meeting? We can’t compromise the safehouse, but we could move to a different area. We could even go to the Stark Industries headquarters in New York City.”
Director Fury shook his head. “I’ve already placed your team at the front of the line and chosen the best one out of the roster of available omegas. Let me be absolutely clear—I want you to treat him in the best way possible. He’s not your average omega.”
“Well. I’d be a pretty poor head alpha if I didn’t listen to other positions and viewpoints,” Steve tried, keeping his voice as diplomatic as possible.
It was the slow-down between the late-breakfast push and the lunch period when a car pulled up outside. It parked—illegally, this was New York City, there was no parking anywhere of course—ignored the beeps, and the driver got out to move to the backseat and open the door.
Six closed doors, two of which revealed the laundry and a bathroom. The remaining four rooms were relatively decent-sized—a closet, a bed, and a dresser in each one. One of the rooms had a bunkbed, however, though it seemed to make up for it by also holding a television against the wall. He could see on the upper bed was a duffel bag—probably Barton’s, already claiming his spot.
“He thinks you’d get along with him,” Natasha reminded Clint. “He thinks Steve and I don’t like him.”
Steve thought back to the alien invasion. The robot had showed up—Iron Man, the press had called it, Fury had called it—and saved all of their collective asses. The robot had also proceeded to prevent the U.S. government from nuking its own citizens, so there was that also. From what he could tell from briefings and information, Iron Man was in fact just a moniker given by the press and had not actively been chosen by the superhero in question. In fact, the person inside the robot—because it was a person, it was too intuitive for today’s robotic technology—could be male or female, alpha or omega or beta. There was nothing to indicate, not even a hint of shifter features to give that away. It was a robot in bright red and gold, and Steve had seen it and thought it was beautiful.
And Clint! He should have recognized that midwestern drawl. He should have realized. Hawkeye had been joking with him and it had seemed familiar—
. Yes, I worried, and I was stressed, but you were a literal captive. All I had to do was follow the tracker I had been putting on you anyway.”
a SHIELD safe house,” Natasha growled at him, even as she shoved a tray of cookies at him. “Restock the display case.”
Barton’s eyes flattened, eyebrows popping up, and Steve fought not to show his wince. Even he could recognize that was very heavy-handed.
Natasha had been stationed at the door, as befitting and proper as the SiC alpha in a military unit, and her eyes were wide, teeth clenched tight. Steve was fighting not to say a word, not to do anything that would upset the man—because this was Tony’s guardian. This was the man Tony’s father had chosen to take on guardianship and protect Tony from people who would treat omegas like meat, like open markets.
Natasha stepped forward, taking Steve by the elbow and walking him away from the tree Clint was sitting beneath. When they were a decent amount away, Natasha said
“And I get it, sometimes people just don’t click, but you are hoarding this omega up in your room, you don’t let anyone else touch him—hell, Sharon is kinder to me than you, and Sharon hates my guts. You don’t get to pretend to be an alpha unless you can lead, and you’re not leading, you’re ignoring the duties of an omega, and how you should be treating your team.”
Rumlow rolled his shoulders and tossed a smirk her way. “Sweetheart, they just couldn’t handle me, I guess.”
(Ste-Virn couldn’t deny his crush anymore to himself, though he sure hoped that Saark didn’t notice it. He was doing his best not to be overprotective and controlling already, because Saark seemed to be very upset if Ste-Virn implied in the least that he thought Saark couldn’t do anything.)
“Your paperwork and reports have all stated that you suspect that there are high-class, prominent names supporting and backing this group,” Master Eeth Koth continued. “We believe that this Jedi has come at your case from that side. He has been working a case looking into ransoms that have been plaguing the upper society for almost a year now. Quite a few of your upper level dealers have cropped up in his reports, enough so that we can no longer ignore the connection.”
He wanted Tony to be reunited with a guardian that clearly cared about Tony’s wellbeing, and had been consistently trying to get in contact with him for a long time. Almost two years, it looked like.
“I could find someone!” Tony said excitedly. “I could—look, there are a lot of therapists that have to deal with celebrities and shit, and yeah, maybe your VA benefits won’t cover it, but don’t worry. It’ll be covered, I’ll get it all squared away. Don’t worry.”
“If he comes, I’ll just tell him you’re sick. You need to get off those knees and legs—” Clint could still remember the cut-off scream as Steve landed wrong, jumping from a window as they tried to stop the sale of salvaged alien technology to underground buyers, “—and rest. If he shows up, I’ll let him know he can see you tomorrow.”
.” The large, elderly man—bald-headed, beady-eyed, tall and broad-shouldered—leaned forward, smiling genially as if he was sharing a secret with Steve. “After all, he could have been the cream of the crop, sitting pretty in the research department, designing and creating fascinating projects by actually putting his expensive degree to use, and instead he decided to join the military. Yep, always thinking with his second brain, eh? Couldn’t get him to settle down and keep those knees together.”
. He absolutely felt like the universe was out to get him. Hell, he’d felt like that for a while, but now, as he sat on the edge of his bed and trembled, unable to close his eyes because it reminded him too much of the inky darkness that poured into the spaces between stars and glistened off the edges of spacecraft and aliens and monsters he had never prepared himself for—
Either way, he was trying to stay a decent distance back from the ship, so that they wouldn’t pick up on his small, unassuming (unarmed) spacecraft following in their wake. How this was actually going to get them hard proof that the company was using slave labor, and how he was going to extract Anotoni from the ship, was still a mystery, one he was trying to figure out.
Haltingly, Saark continued, “Jedi Kulsi would have been very good for you, because he did provide that stability. He was very level-headed. He and you were very much alike, in your black and white views. I… had too much of the grey within me. Too much mixed in with the white.”
It was no longer a strange sight, to wander downstairs from his room at six in the morning to find Tony Stark standing in the kitchen, arguing with Steve over the newest thing they found to argue about.
Clint stared in awe as four more people came in with trays, stacked with baked goods. “Shit, we’re not going to be able to sell all of this,” he breathed.
It was—amazing. Steve had had two omegas on the Howling Commandos, and though they had calmed down angry or arguing alphas, it hadn’t been as subtle or gentle as this; Tony’s scent was soft, almost like a cotton blanket muffling the surging anger that was fighting to meet Barton’s intensity.
It took everything in Ste-Virn’s body not to bounce his leg nervously. He did his best to project confidence and calm rationality as he replied, “The boat had records, linked and watermarked with Indenaturing Mining communications. These records are detailed and go back for over three years. They describe in detail shipments of beings that meet certain requirements, up to and including body size and shape, species, and age—”
Blinking, it took him a moment to really see what was going on. Clint was berating Steve, and Steve was arguing back—
The district where Anotoni’s signal broadcasted from was definitely on the poorer side. Many abandoned factories and junkyards dotted the landscape, and trash piled up in a composting yard on the edge of the quadrant. Ste-Virn kept to the shadows, blending in as best as he could when so obviously looking for something. If there was an auction house, it would probably be in an abandoned warehouse—that would have enough space, and be defensible enough to guard against authorities showing up. If there was simply a holding area until the trafficked beings were moved to the mines—far more likely, considering that owning a slave or even an indentured servant on this planet meant five years of imprisonment yourself and a loss of title and land—they could be anywhere.
So as the boys get closer, unknowing of the dangers they’re bringing on to themselves trying to get to the Angel of Death, she’s already unsheathed several blades and hidden them up her sleeves, keeping her back to them. They are just about upon her when a figure launches out of the shadows, tackling the other three and knocking them out with ease.
“Mama brought McDonald’s!” Clint exclaims, throwing his hands up in the air and backflipping over the couch. “Mama brought McDonald’s!”
“Eh,” Clint flops his hand around lackadaisically. “Three of us have daddy issues, and Nat’s never met her parents, so our standards are kinda skewed.”
“The man who shot it,” Steve replied without hesitation. He didn’t understand why Bucky’s head snapped to look at him incredulously.
Strange smirked at Rhodes and beckoned his hand. Rhodes pouted and handed back whatever Strange had give him before.
”He claimed it was because he didn’t want to live under the rule of a king or tyrant, even when Angel assured him that wouldn’t be the case. She had double checked and triple checked and was making contingencies so it would never happen. But unknown to her, the real reason was that the soldier had been stealing from Angel to find the dragon, and he didn’t want her to find out, nor leave the place the dragon knew where to find him at.
’I know, my dear. But you must. You will have an extremely hard life, but you will change the world. Your pain becomes their saving grace. It is a man’s world right now, and you,
Toni was suddenly enveloped in the Iron Queen armour, which appeared out of nowhere. Repulsers flared to life and were aimed at Steve’s team.
Next to her stood Rhodes. He looked great, and Steve was happy to note that he seemed as good as new with the braces Toni had undoubtedly built for him.
”The mother never did anything, flits in and out of the house like a ghostly butterfly, comforting other families who lost someone or got hurt in the war, but never her own child. The only one the girl has is the family’s butler, a kind man who helps clean her wounds and tells her stories to fall asleep. Stories of a soldier and his dragon, who fought bravely in the war, both giving their lives for a cause they believe in. The father starts telling her these stories too, although not as kindly. ‘You see these two?’ He would ask and point at a painting of a handsome young man with a dragon at his side. ‘They are true heroes. God, I should have gotten him as a son.’
’Very good,’ the lady compliments. ‘I am Hela, goddess of death. Also known as just Lady Death. And you are in my realm. Yet, you should not be here. It is not your time.’
”Mr. Rogers is no longer in charge of the Avengers Initiative nor those who fall under it. As is, none of you are currently active duty. Once the probation period has passed, and you finish all of your tests, you will either be place under my or Colonel Rhodes’ command.”
Angel discovers a terrorist organization and goes after them. They end up taking her Flame of Life and changing the Flame into something more. Flame dies but Death brings her back all the same, just like she has done for Angel throughout the years. Together they take down the terrorists. No one from her team checks up on her, but she figures they were busy, even if they were becoming a family. They too busy, or at least that’s what Angel tells herself.
’No,’ Hela answers her. ‘But you can. You, my Angel, can bless whoever you feel worthy enough to receive that blessing.’
”I think so?” Steve answered truthfully. “I don’t see how this is a true story, but I understand most of it.”
The Angel of Death cures herself once more and begins to live a happier life with the four children she made herself and blessed, giving them each a title. One Innocence, one Forgiveness, one Vengeance, and one Love.
Then another one of her god father’s spies comes in, but this time he’s a friend. She gifted him a long while back the title of Understanding. He tells her a new enemy had arisen. And Angel just sighs.
“I don’t remember this,” Tony states, but it comes out as more of a question towards the end when he catches Thor’s imploring frown.
”That’s the killing curse,” Strange said rolling his eyes. “You just killed your hair clip.” Regardless, he placed it on the counter and slid it forward. Toni shot him a grateful look and picked up the spider web shaped golden hair clip. She reached up and put it in her hair.
“I think this talk is about to get into emotions, and we all know how allergic I am to those,” Tony announces, clapping his hands. “So I’m just gonna go…” he hooks a thumb over his shoulder at the door and bolts.
The woman next to Rhodes cleared her throat. “I am Colonel Carol Danvers, or Captain Marvel, current leader of the Avengers Initiative.”
Steve settled back into his chair with a grumbled “fine.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder comfortingly, before turning back to Toni, who takes this as her cue.
“Your fighting is upsetting the children,” Bruce says, completely straight faced except for the slightest tick of his lips upward that he tries to hide by taking a sip of his tea.
Toni cleared her throat. “Angel wakes up and the doctor who worked on her tells her she has a week to live. Those who captured her come in to demand that she make a weapon for them. She refuses. They torture her and torture her, and she meets Lady Death a few more times, but she doesn’t give in. They finally realize that pain is just an old friend, and Death like a mother and drag her outside of their little cave. Somehow they have hundreds of her weapons. One of the men speaks to her in a foreign language that she can understand, but none of them know that nor should they, so the doctor translates.
”Whose fault is that?” Rhodes asked coldly, body tensing. Toni waved a hand at him and he backed down, but not without a sneer.
“Yeah, yeah I can,” Tony says, tone almost careless, except he can tell from Peter’s pleading eyes that he didn’t keep all of the animosity out of it. Steve looks over at him alarmed. Tony pulls out his phone and Jarvis, always amazing, has already gotten into the school records and given Tony the boy’s name, a run down on his school life, and family history. “Right, Mr. Thompson.”
‘You deserve this,’ the soldier seems to say to her. And he goes back to his team and claims that she tried to kill them, when she only wanted to cause them a little pain. Had she wanted them dead, they would be dead with slit throats because even after all those years her Aunt’s lessons of always being armed stuck with her, and her knives were still hidden in her sleeves.”
“He called Peter a severely homophobic name, usually reserved for homosexual men,” MJ says, appearing uninterested although Tony knows it’s a front. Like calls to like after all.
“Hey Tony, I’m sorry to bother you, but a situation came up at Peter’s school and I can’t get off of work right now.” Tony had taken Peter in, surprisingly much to May’s encouragement around a few months ago. Now every weekend and sometimes even some week nights Peter would spend at the tower, hanging out with Bruce and Tony in the lab, playing video games with Clint, or sparring with Nat, Thor, and Steve.
‘Never forget, Angel,’ Death whispers back as she kisses Angel on the forehead. ‘I love you darling. I will always be beside you.’ With that, Angel returns to the living.
“No, I should have done worse,” Tony grumbles and they way Steve peers at him makes him settle down, lest he get the ‘we are adults, we can not threaten minors’ speech. Again.
“Right. A few months later the man moves in with her. She begins calling him ridiculous nicknames and he becomes like a brother to her. Then she has to go back to her father’s village and she meets Death again.
He’s in the common room, designing on a tablet and tuning out everything around him. That is, until an insistent hand keeps tapping him on the shoulder.
Tony stares at him, concern finding root in his chest as he thinks about Thor swallowing his tongue. He blanches at the realization. “What the fuck, you’re right. We’re running a day care.”
“None of you have gotten therapy for it, have you?” Steve asks drily, and all four shake their heads in synchronization. “Of course you haven’t.”
As if on cue, there’s a loud thump and everyone abruptly turns their heads to see a knife embedded into the wall, Natasha’s arm still finishing it’s arc across the room. Steve’s eyes widen at her incredulously.
“That he is. Come on, let’s take mama bear here home, and then we can have a good chat about why you were hiding being bullied from us.”
Tony propped a hip up on the counter. “Her father fears for the safety of their village, so he makes weapons for the villagers to use to stay safe. The little girl wants to work in the forge with her father, but he always tells her no. ‘The forge is meant for men,’ he always says. ‘The best you can do is look pretty, and maybe we can find you a rich husband.’  This is one of his good days. The father is cruel at best abusive at worst. The age of three is when he starts physically hurting her. ‘A stupid daughter,’ he would yell as he broke her fingers. ‘I needed a son! And all I got was a worthless girl!’ And the young child couldn’t fight back, because she was smaller, weaker, and deep down thought he was right.”
The young man tells her his name, and sticks out his hand. Angel clasps her palm to his and answers with her fake name, the one her
Immediately Thor and Clint try to pin the blame on the other, while Tasha just raises her hands and says, “Wasn’t me.”
“Tony,” Steve chides quietly, grabbing his arm and whispering in his ear. “You need to calm down, there are other people here.”
There’s a loud snort, and Thor jolts awake. He adopts a somewhat sheepish look. “Shield siblings, what have I missed?”
Angel knew he was using some of her stuff, she told him he was allowed to, but not once did the soldier thank her, not once did he let her help him.”
She finds out the soldier with the dragon is still alive, sans dragon. She meets him and together they take down Death’s father. She meets a man who she secretly had blessed with Peace years before and the spy and her friend. They all meet Death’s Uncle and lock up Death’s father. Angel finally gets to talk to the soldier, but he reminds her of her father and she remembers the stories that her father, her butler and her Aunt told her. The soldier was always brave, always a good man, never wrong. The soldier doesn’t like her, and even though Angel knows she’s not worthy of his praise, she can’t help but feel the weight of her father’s words come crashing down on her. So she does what she does best. She aggravates him, gives him a reason to hate her. The soldier was not good enough to see beyond her masks. No one ever was.
“No problem, dear,” Steve replies, tongue in cheek. Tony huffs out a laugh and sets about cleaning the kitchen up, trying not to focus on the fire low in his gut that was ignited by the pet name. And when Steve starts to help him sweep up the flour and start cooking team dinner? Tony finds he doesn’t mind one bit.
“Because you’re just like a mom,” Natasha tells him. “You care for us, don’t deny it we all know its you who leaves those care packages, you can cook, and you might bitch about it, but you always make us new armors and weapons when we get hurt out on the field instead of chewing us out like Steve. Face it, you’ve become a mom.”
She shrugged and took a sip of her coffee, moaning loudly at the taste. Steve couldn’t help the way his thoughts followed the sound and how he used to draw it from her.
getting back into his outline. They try to talk to him some more, and he hums and haws and agrees until he finally just says, “Look, go ask Steve.”
The wizard raised his eyebrows and produced something in his hand. When he shook it, the material caught the light.
But the longer nothing happened, the more he trembled, and he abruptly realized it wasn't fear, but fury.
Steve turned, and found himself cornered. The ice prince, stood not a few feet away, still grinning that too-wide grin, face lit red from the exit sign and blue from his scepter. He should have been covered in blood, but there wasn't a speck of it on him, not the point of the scepter, not the hand that had held Stark down, not the front of his robes, which should have been speckled with it.
"For the greater good," Steve croaked out. His voice sounded like the creak of a rusty old gate. "To serve my country."
He whined a half-hearted protest as the member was drawn out and rubbed all over his face, marking him all over with its musky scent, like some kind of animal. He had the sinking suspicion that this cock had already had its way with him, many times over, while he was drugged and unaware.
The cell was, as these things went, relatively comfortable. He only had to look at the empty dog cage hulking in the corner, still stained with his blood, to remember how things could be worse.
Stark cut out, but the video looped, and restarted. As the machine fucked into him, he watched Stark fucking him in third person, and sobbed. There was something so humiliating and arousing about watching that man on the screen violated. Watching Stark plow into that prone body, over and over, ripping every last ounce of enjoyment from it, with no care for the person, the hero, it had once been.
Even through the haze of pleasure, Steve tried to deny it, but it was too late, he was already coming with the force of an explosion, his every muscle tightening, quivering, locking with the sensation, any thought of trying to hide it wiped from his mind as he cried out at the top of his lungs.
A permanent mark, that would never come off, showing him as an object, as property. Stark's property.
He made it into the last minute this time, before he came again, sobbing brokenly. It hurt so much, he couldn't go through it again. But he hadn't been able to hold it, and the timer pitilessly reset.
Instead of hurting him, the cool touch seemed to soothe the pain in his head. The ringing in his head went away, and the nausea with it, almost like Steve's concussion had been healed.
"Would've been a waste to put it on that luscious booty," Stark said. There was the sounds of him putting some things away, maybe picking up his other gauntlet. "Went for the tramp stamp instead. Seemed fitting."
Steve's eyes opened, tried to focus. Stark was reading something in front of him that only he could see, and he began to swipe his free hand in the air, as if paging through a giant, invisible book.
To his surprise, the ice began to melt away, and Steve was able to pull away from it, scrape off the last shards with numbing fingers and, huddle there, cold and wet but free. He stared up at the figure, who was looking back at him with exasperation.
, if I want to plunder that booty without breaking it too badly. Oh, don't make that sound, sunshine, I'm being so gentle with you. You should be grateful."
A flash of some strange light flickered in Loki's eyes, and Steve felt his face began to tingle. The come seeped into his skin, an indelible mark that he knew he'd never be able to wash off.
It was torture as he began to work his way off the arm that held him in place, squirming this way and that, sending little jolts of pain and occasional bright shocks of pleasure up his spine with each movement.
She delved into him again, suffocating him. His body started to buck upwards, but Clint's hand from behind pushed down on his back, forcing him down.
The sting came again, not on the curve of his cheek, as he'd expected, but at the base of his spine, right above the crack of his ass.
"I don't think anyone could have seen all of it, except maybe head nurse. Honestly, she could have discharged you by now, but I think she likes to watch."
Somehow for all that he had suffered, this violation was worse, that he didn't even know what had been done to him, while he was utterly helpless and unaware. He curled up with a whimper, sore body moving slowly, foreignly, like it wasn't used to obeying him anymore.
"No way," Steve said, and another bolt hit him like a truck. It was briefer this time, or he was just ready for it. When it subsided, he scrabbled for the collar on his neck with jerky movements, expecting at any time another strike—but he couldn't find any seam or latch, it felt like a smooth piece of metal all the way around. He only got a brief jolt of pain for his efforts, but it still brought tears to his eyes.
"I do not understand," he grunted, releasing Steve arms to point at the screen. Steve grunted too, for a different reason, as the massive girth sank all the way in, and stayed there, impossibly large, impossibly filling. "Did the warrior not beat his opponent into submission? Why must he now quit the arena?"
"We can help him, pet," said Loki, idly stroking Steve's hair, though he had to reach up to do so. "Ask me this boon, and I will grant it."
"Hell, he can shock you just because he thinks it's funny," Stark was still rambling. "But don't worry, I never gave him a sense of humor."
Aching, leg muscles trembling, Steve got to his feet, and hurried to search his surroundings. He found an adjoining bathroom, and took the most bladder-relieving piss of his life.
"I love you fucked out of your mind like this. A couple hours ago, you would've bitten me, wouldn't you? You would've fought me tooth and nail. Now here you are, gagging for it."
But he couldn't wear the collar either, knowing that it left him at Stark's whims, knowing that at any moment, it could close his throat, and for as long as Stark chose.
"That's so you'll always be able to see it," Stark said, circling around behind him, grabbing a palmful of his butt cheek. "This one's for me. So I can see it."
But there came the squelch of more liquid squeezed out of a bottle, a steady press against his entrance, and then something was pushing into him, warm and probing. Pinned and spread like a butterfly on display, he was powerless to fight it. He tried to push back against it, to squeeze himself shut, but the sick slick of the lubricant prevented even that resistance, and the thing slipped right in, like he was made for it.
"If your body wasn't made for my use, why do you love it so much? Why are you moaning like a little slut?"
Which is how, an hour later, he glanced over at Rumlow—because they were sitting next to one another, Tony draped across both their laps, Tony letting out little, please purrs as Rumlow ran fingers through Tony’s hair and stroked down Tony’s neck and spine—and he sighed. “I don’t know what your problem is with me, Rumlow.”
“Look, you won’t be around forever, is what I’m saying. Someone needs to make long-term plans for this omega, because we’re not it. I am
“Romanoff, Barton, keep him safe?” Steve said, and without waiting to see them follow orders, he turned and faced Stane with the nicest smile he could muster. It felt more like bared fangs, lips curled away from his teeth, as he said in the politest voice he could manage, “I’m very happy I got to see the environment Tony came from, and how he’s grown from it. I must say, I’ve had no cause to complain about Tony. Tony’s absolutely perfect the way he is, and I’m glad he grew up with as much spark and strength as he does. He’ll need it, in this world. He has two months left until your guardianship runs out, four months left on his military service contract—which he renewed in order to wait out the guardianship period—and I hope he chooses to spend those four months with us. Good day, Mr. Stane.”
it happen, and he didn’t really want the responsibility of an omega’s life in his hands. He’d have to establish himself as top alpha, as claiming the omega, to ensure that none of the other alphas mistreated the omega—and neither he nor the omega would have a choice in that matter.
Which meant it made almost no sense at all for Tony Stark, grandson of Howard Stark, to make his way into SHIELD rosters. Yeah, SHIELD needed omegas, but anyone joining SHIELD went through a drawn-out interview process, and didn’t realize exactly what SHIELD was. Most likely, Tony had entered the military like any other omega, thinking to serve out his contract with a group of alphas unlikely to see combat in the rank and file, or in the Navy, or in the Air Force. How he got shuffled into SHIELD’s depths… that was something Steve wasn’t sure about.
Natasha immediately switched tack. “And you are worrying your alpha, who I’m sure you’ve noticed is a bit possessive and a lot stubborn.”
them, but they were an ‘emergency response team’ so conceivably they should have someone around in case something happened. Clint made a face, but seemed fine with it.
“Look, I don’t know what you think I’m going to do, but Natasha’s going to be my right hand in this pack, and I’m going to have her looking into that first thing.”
“No, I’d like an explanation too, Tony,” Natasha said quietly. “You—you’re Iron Man. You must have used that to escape? Is that how Rhodes found you? And then you decided to join the military, knowing that would get you out of the hands of Stane.”
Omegas, Steve had found out after he’d been woken up, had a lot more rights now, but some things never changed. He’d realized that when he’d gone into the SHIELD barracks he’d been provided two days after being released from medical and saw a kneeling O at the feet of an alpha Steve only vaguely recognized from walking down the different hallways in medical.
Duffel bag in hand, he walked up the steps to the front door and tried the knob. Unlocked. With a mental shrug, he opened the door and stepped in.
Steve folded his arms, stared at him, but Tony was really good at ignoring disapproving and disappointing looks. He was going to just finish this, and if Steve hated it, well.
Clint could almost physically feel the bags and bruises under his eyes. In part because he was, in fact, still having nightmares, and he avoided the therapists at SHIELD like they were the plague—but in part because yesterday was the first day they had all physically been called out as an actual team. He had fallen off of not one, but
Now that he had pulled his head out of trying to creatively write a report, he could remember asking Natasha to do that, back when they first had moved in and first met Tony. “Oh, yes, yes. What did you find out?”
But Stark looked… bad. Looked like how Clint felt, back when he had come back to himself, back when Natasha had stood over him and blue trails of lights faded away from his eyes. Looked like how Steve looked, back when he had been shown in by a random SHIELD agent, lost and angry and hurting all at one time.
Tony drummed his fingers against his chest—a nervous tic Steve had noticed back in the Helicarrier—and scowled. “Just a coffee, I guess. See if you can find Clint; I’d like to talk to him.”
“Kriff off, Byu-Kyonn,” Anotoni yawned, keeping his fingers entwined with Ste-Virn’s regardless of the dirty looks of the elder Jedi walking past them, or the curious or, alternatively, revolted looks the younglings and Padawans gave them. “If I want to show affection, I will.”
months, but they had lived in the same quarters, shared the same routines, learned under the same no-nonsense master who was the only master at the time who knew how to deal with traumatized Padawans and was free to take on two radically different children who had two different perspectives on their respective trauma. They might not have been friends, but they had been (reluctant) companions.
“I don’t want to revisit past hurts,” Ste-Virn said stiffly, feeling his shoulders grow tight as he pinched the bridge of his nose.
The corner of Tony’s lips twitched into the facsimile of a smile. “I just—we end up like this in the bathroom almost every night, for almost two months, and we might as well just do it here. Especially because you need proper sleep, not curling up on the tile floor—which is cold, too, let me just point that out.”
All this flashed through his mind, even as Sharon stood up, smiling, and put her hand out to Rumlow. Rumlow took it, still smiling, and then he frowned—before getting pulled into Sharon’s knee.
Ste-Virn found his teeth were clenched tight, and tried to force his anger to leave. A good Jedi did not hold onto the negativity—or the past. They strove to move forward, taking only the lessons with them into the future.
“Okay, well, I don’t know what unit you were assigned to previously, but I’m not… we’re not doing that here. Okay? Just—please put some clothes on.”
She thought about it a moment before shaking her head. “Clint can take first watch, and you can take second. I’ll take third, right before sunrise. And then I’ll figure out what we need in this house and go into town with Tony and have him help settle us into this place. I’ve heard that if omegas have a say in the items and foods and things you put into a house, they calm down easier.”
“Holy shit,” Tony breathes, taking a step back, and Steve reaches out to catch him. Tony impacts against a very nice chest and his mind blue screens before he can repute anything Natasha said.
Steve looked over at Bucky, recognizing the parallel to his friend’s history. But instead of remembrance in his eyes, his face was pale and he was staring in horror at Toni. Steve figured it was because of the story.
He was practically chomping at the bit to see Toni again and maybe they could finally make on that small cautious relationship that had blossomed between them official. Sure, he was angry the brunette had tried to kill Bucky, but Steve would forgive her with time. Toni would have to be benched until the entire team could trust her again, especially Wanda and Clint, but Steve would make sure the Iron Queen suit was passed on to someone worthy. He might even let Toni run coms.
Tony grunted, whisking in the cocoa powder. “Fudge cookies. They’ll be better than those monstrosities you call cookies, at least.”
“Besides, you are always free to go and talk with the counseling services yourself. You and I both know you saw Coulson like a big brother, or a protector. Barton might be broken up about his role in the whole mess, and Steve Rogers is a whole other mess of trauma in a blender with survivor’s guilt and a whole shit-ton of other things in the mix, but you aren’t that well off yourself.”
In the end, that made the choice very clear. He reached into his robes for his lightsaber and burst forth.
. His speech was clearly high-class, his behaviors and mannerisms eccentric and strange. He volunteered as a mechanic in the oddest positions, and made himself
Tony’s face appeared around the corner, eyes shifting nervously back and forth between them, even as he paused on the outside of the room. “Alpha?” he asked quietly.
Steve’s enhanced hearing could pick up the cracking, the stress from what he was doing to the table, and he realized he had made a terrible mistake. He stood up, pasting a fake smile on his face. “Well, I just wanted to meet the guardian that had influenced Tony so much, and let Tony’s guardian know that he’s being cared for to the utmost of our ability. I hope you have an amazing day, Mr. Stane—”
He was dressed in a loose silk pair of pants—or, at least, they looked silk from where Steve was sitting, flowy and almost gauzy as he walked, chest bare. Steve stared in shock at the multiple scratches and scars over Tony’s chest, the biggest a knot of scar tissue almost directly over his heart. It even looked to be shining a little, shimmering. Maybe new, and the light was reflecting off the pink of new scars? That was odd, though. Maybe Tony’s old unit had seen combat, and Tony had been caught up in. Maybe Tony had a car accident recently.
“Call me sweetheart again and I cut those off, not just knock them back up into your spineless body,” Sharon said cheerfully. “I’m going to go pick out my room, Steve.”
Natasha sipped her beer and stared at Tony a long moment. Tony knew, and they both knew, but all that Tony did was become a little more tense—he was always tense, but it was hidden, and now it wasn’t hidden anymore—and turn his shoulder to not look their way.
“I’m not that kind of alpha. I’m not going to take advantage of him just because he expects me to,” Steve said. “But I’d like for you to look into him, if you can. Figure out who mistreated him previously—and how he got into SHIELD in the first place. Fury wouldn’t give me straight answers—”
Steve looked up from where he was sifting through papers on the latest ‘call’ the team had been called out on, trying to put the information in a light that didn’t scream “for the third time, in one of our callouts, Iron Man showed up, somehow knew what to do, and saved Clint from falling off the building and kept Brock from shooting a bazooka at an inhabited building when trying to knock the ‘wizard’ off of whatever new thing he magicked up to fly around on while the rest of us ran around trying to catch everything that was flying around that shouldn’t have been flying in the first place.”
“I know you said not to interact with them—that they are suspected of working with the smugglers, that they were not as unaware of the cargo being transported as they seem, that too many questions or lines of thought would make them suspicious. That they didn’t trust outsiders and that your cover already would be on shaky ground for bringing me along. But people talk easier when they feel like you talk with them. I talk to a lot of people—you know that. You know that my skills lie in interpersonal subterfuge. You know that’s why I’ve always been on those escort missions, and you know—”
It took a few moments before the commlink burst with static, and his best friend’s voice crackled over the transmission. “Steev?”
Clint’s voice was a little tinny, and a little quiet, when he replied, “Well. He’s pissed, that’s for sure.”
to report that.” Shoulders heaving, eyes narrowed, Barton pushed a finger against Steve’s chest. “You gotta promise that you’re going to.”
Why did he decide to have Natasha set up the meeting? She told him that if Tony wanted to meet up with his guardian, he would have done so at any given point. She told him that Tony had the ability to write, to
