Sam smiles.
“Cas, I had to get you out of there” Jack says softly, breaking away, “I… I couldn’t leave you in the Empty.”
“Love you.” he says simply
Dean swallows
Dean regards her hand sceptically, looking up to meet her eyes before dropping the hand from his head to shake her own, “Dean. And yeah, I'm in 5.”
He walks out before he can hear any more.
“Dean?”
Castiel almost doesn't see it coming. He’s halfway across the street when he hears a screech of tyres. On instinct, he rushes back, his body millimetres away from the car as it speeds past. The driver doesn't bother to stop, but Castiel doesn't blame him. In fact, he’s almost sad that the driver avoided hitting him.
“Hey!” she calls as she turns to peer around the stock room door, “Party at 3AM on a weeknight? Those neighbours sound like fun - might be a good place to start?”
“Look after my big brother, alright?” He jokes, pulling Cas in for one final hug.
are you
Dean stares back at the angel that always believed in him.
Grabbing his hand, she drags Dean towards the group in the centre of the room, his protests seeming futile.
“It’s fine really, I was just walking in and she looked like she could use a hand,” Dean says, turning to meet Anna’s gaze, “No biggie.”
“Oh…..ok”
“Well, not to be rude Jack but of course we’ll go back,” Sam scoffs, turning to Dean, “Am I being crazy or…”
“I...I think I want to go back.”
Jack nods.
The group stuff themselves back into the car, full from the mountains of carbohydrates they have all ingested.
At Castiel’s silence, Dean speaks.
Dean swallows
“Look after the children!” he hears Gabriel call out.
“You know I never ask for much, but you taught me what I wanted was worth something, so… so choose whatever makes you happy, but… While I’m here to ask it… stay with me.”
She leans on the door frame, studying his face for a few moments before speaking.
“I know you do sweetie” she smiles, and the punch turns into a comforting hand on his arm, “I’m just worried about you, that’s all. You never seem too happy at work, and I never see you round Smith Center with anyone. You should give people a chance! I know i’m biased, but Jo ain’t that bad to have a conversation with?”
“Um…you must be….Dean Winchester?” he hears his teacher say.
Dean looks up to see a girl - her tall, pale limbs reach out towards him in reflex. A silver chain adorned with a small set of what looks like wings hangs loosely around her neck, bumping her chin. She can’t be much younger than Sam was the last time he saw him. A strand of her red hair that has escaped her messy bun falls to drape around her face as she bends down, worriedly checking over his head. She reaches to grab the case from him, her brow crinkling with exaggerated, sincere worry.
“Dean, I… I can’t do this without you.”
He closes the drawer.
“Who doesn’t?” Dean replies, gaining a small smile from Castiel.
“Dean, I-”
“You headed home?”
Dean only lets himself watch Castiel for a few moments, and by that time they’ve arrived.
“How ya doin’, Dean?”
Dean remembers waking Sam up early every year on the younger brother’s birthday. They would drive out to the nearby viewpoint and sit on the hood of the Impala, watching the day begin as they ate PopTarts Dean stole the night before from the 7/11. Dean would give Sam his present - a hoodie; a new backpack ; one year when Sam was particularly obsessed with  mythology, he managed to find a ratty first edition book of ‘The Encyclopedia of Vampires, Werewolves, and Other Monsters’ in a second hand bookshop. Sam had read that book every day for at least a year, the spine becoming worn and the pages wrinkling at the edges. Despite all the clear outs John forced on them over the years, Sam had always kept that book, safely tucked away in the corner of his bookcase.
“That’s me.”
Dean lets their words hang in silence for a few moments as he listens to the song. It’s almost celestial, the woman’s voice soft and perfectly complemented by the strums of guitar.
He stops himself, squeezing his eyes shut, before opening them slowly and continuing
Castiel has curled up on himself, his body facing away from Dean, his head resting on the door. He’s not sure what he feels anymore.
“The Empty still has a sort of power over you, so as much as I tried I can’t bring you back to life, but …  If anyone deserves Heaven, it’s you Cas.”
Jack wastes no more time, before reaching to envelop the angel in a hug. After all, he may be the new Father, but Castiel would always be his father.
“Obviously… Well, my brother and Meg are visiting, and so …. we thought we’d get some food, go on drive? We’re new to the town, so we just wanted to have a look around… Anyway, we were wondering… Well, Anna was wondering…. If you’d like to join us? Dinner on us, to set things right? ”
“What I’m trying to say is...” Castiel continues, and Dean’s becoming aware of the heat the body next to him is emanating, Anna dozing away as she lies at her brother’s opposite side, “According to science...even though we can see so many stars right now, there are millions more that we can’t see…”
Two days later, as Dean returns from a long day at work, he hears the familiar purr of a car engine revving up next to him.
Dean goes to work.
“All you have to do is follow that road straight, it’ll probably be a ten minute drive until the turn off sign, after that you can’t miss it ”
Dean tries not to react, just gives a soft nod upwards in reply.
Dean looks up to see Gabriel peering out of his car window, smirking to himself as Meg stares at her phone. Dean hesitates, before walking over to join them.
Dean offers a wave, watching them drive along the main road and disappear around the corner.
‘Excuse me dear, I was wondering when you’ll next be stocking up on your canned beans?’
Castiel watches this, staying silent for a moment, before turning to train his eyes on the road ahead.
“...Was there somethin’ more than beer in those bottles?”
The brothers turn. When they see who it is, they clamber to their feet.
He laughs lightly and looks up at her.
On the other nights, he’s looked up the the sky to feel less alone, and had their twinkling
“I am so, so sorry,” she rushes out, drawing the case towards her body as they both stand, “I pulled it out and it just flew completely out of my hands. I guess I don’t know my own strength…’
Rubbing his eyes, he stands and walks to his kitchen counter, the promise of his morning coffee the only thing keeping him going. As he waits for the pot to brew, he rummages in his fridge for something to soothe his rumbling stomach. His shelves are pretty bare, but he manages to gather up a couple of ingredients and begins by the stove, frying up some eggs. Standing watching over the pan, he glances out of the window. The sun is starting to rise, painting hues of orange and pink across the sky.
Due to his relative sobriety, Dean is persuaded to become the designated driver. He doesn’t mind - despite the unfamiliar steering wheel, the focus of the road has always been a comfort to him.
“You’re…You’re gonna’ need this.” He explains, placing it into Castiel’s hands, and Castiel can hear the weight in the statement.
“This is Dean!” Anna interjects, “He’s our neighbour! Well, he lives downstairs …. Dean, this is our brother Gabriel, and our friend Meg. Guys, this is Dean!”
“Hey, happens to the best of us man - I won’t hold it against you”, he shakes his head lightly, offering a small smile as a sign of a peace offering, “Just give me a heads up next time, yeah?”
Ellen’s voice echoes in his head
They stand in silence for a few more moments. Dean’s not sure if his overtired brain is making this weird or if it’s Castiel - the guy’s just standing there, looking at him with an expression that Dean can’t quite decipher.
“Just want to get to know the neighbours! Me and my brother moved into Apartment 7 in Block C today!”  She says, jostling the guitar into one hand and throwing the other out in front of her, smiling, “Anna Novak.”
Exclaiming excitedly, Anna jumps up and runs to him, wrapping her arms around him and squeezing hard. He has a few moments to register the embrace, the remnants of his tired state still not allowing him his normal reflex time, before Castiel swiftly follows her up, dragging her arms off of Dean.
They stare at each other, silently.
“... Dean?”
“Where’s good around here, Cassie?” Gabriel asks his brother, pulling a map out from the glove compartment as they decide on a beauty spot to drive to.
is he supposed to say?
Dean stands up abruptly and kisses Aaron wetly on the cheek. "Thank you! I have to–thank you!" he stammers as he hugs him tightly before backing up with a wild wave and turning to rush back home.
Rowena sits, legs cross, eyes close and head tilted back at her throne. Two of her minions are filing her nails with an concerning amount of concentration and Dean eyes roll so hard they might get stuck in the back of his head.
"I-I'm gon-gonna go! Cas!" Dean squeals, reaching and grasping the base of his cock to hold off his stream.
one."
"I have no need for them, Hermaphrodite." Nordic states and despite the unexpected title, Nordic's voice has no menace when he says it. Dean scrambles to his hands and knees and crawls to the edge of the pond.
inside of him.
He opens it.
Dean bites back a small smile as he stands up. "Uh, little spoon."
"Please talk to me." Dean slides his hands down to Castiel's open pants and cups his freed dick. Castiel inhales sharply.
"What're you thinkin' about back there?" Dean wonders sleepily.
"Every parent has favorites. I was my father's and I paid for it and I didn't want you–" Castiel sighs and sits down on the sand.
The thought has Dean idlily playing with the gold band around his finger while he waits for Castiel to speak.
"Maybe the Nymph turned Dean normal." Mary suggests.
"How embarrassing." she croaks lowly. "Lower beings never learn, do they? They come and demand and act like we owe them something. I've been here longer than she's been alive!" Eve hollers, spit flying out of her mouth which makes Dean flinch back. Eve straightens herself and turns her head towards Lucifer.
Castiel's throat and pants tighten.
"Yes, a friend." Castiel mumbles. "I–"
"You want to–"
Hm, Dean thinks, that's not tacky.
"It's guava juice with grapefruit vodka. It's actually quite tasty." Castiel steps back to his desk chair and falls onto it with a short huff and closes his eyes.
Dean rises from his crouched position, his knees creaking in the process, and gazes down at Miracle. "Walk?" Miracle barks twice, jumping up and down, her nails clacking nosily against his polished floor and small, almost miniscule, bits of hair drift to the ground and Dean huffs a laugh.
He'd been up a majority of the night, only vaguely remembering the bright three thirty and the sound of the shower running before he passed out, researching about the definition of transgender, which led him down a pipe line of pronouns, identity, and gender expression. It led to some questions popping up in Castiel's mind about his own identity but he decided to push it down in favor of watching a video about transgender being an umbrella term.
"You smell like him." Castiel mumbles lowly into Dean's ear before gripping the backs of Dean's thighs and hauling him up on the desk. Castiel grips the meat on Dean's thighs tighter and ducks down to lick a long stripe from Dean's neck to his jaw. "If I taste you will I taste them?"
Castiel settles down behind him and kisses his cheek. Dean laces their fingers together. "Your wings are really beautiful."
"Can't, gonna p-pee, 's gonna make me go,
"When this is all over, when we cure them, will you leave him with the child?" Lucifer asks in a pained whisper, like the thought of Castiel being alone somehow now matters to him.
Charlie stands over Sam, who's sat in a chair with a mirror in front of him, in the middle of the living room with bobby pins in her mouth as she styles Sam's hair. Flowers, articles of clothing, and makeup scatter on the couches and floor.
Cassie turns at the mention of her name and Dean tenses, hands shaking at his sides. "He wasn't feeling well."
The ground shakes, dead carcasses of birds fall from the trees, and a sharp need to cradle his belly strikes Dean.
"No worries. It's all good in the hood." Dean shuts his eyes tightly. Oh heaven above, strike him down now. He shouldn't even be saying that.
"Your therapist! You want to fuck your therapist!" Jo exclaims loudly, slamming herself down in the booth across from him.
"It's getting dark, well, darker. We should find somewhere to lie low for a little."
"D-daddy," it feels good, fuck that, it feels like Dean's in a seventh heaven. His body buzzes and Castiel gives two more aborted thrusts of his hips before he sucks in a sharp breath and Dean can feel the wetness through his jeans. Castiel gives him lazy, sloppy kisses, hugging him close.
When Jess' anger calms down, Debbie walks down the stairs to Jess who has tears in her eyes as she explains why she's so hurt. Debbie nods and wraps her arms around Jess, no look of empathy on her face.
The paper vanishes and the tension in the room deflates. The Angels stand and Dean follows in suit.
The house is blissfully silent, no maids or gatekeepers or chefs running back and forth in his home, not until later anyway.
I just," Dean closes his eyes tightly. He's not making the situation better.
"Oh, I am studying to become an Architectural Technion. I hope go get into Garden Designs and I even have a few online classes that I am taking for it! I hope to make beautiful gardens accessible to the homeless and reduce the amount of food waste by composting into the gardens directly! It's actually very, um, simpler." Castiel's cheeks heat at the amusement sparkling in Dean's eyes. "What about you?"
"Did I do something wrong? I am unaware of the customs that apply to birthdays." Dean can hear the frown on Castiel's face. He lets out a watery chuckle.
Dean exhales lowly and flexes his fingers against the pointy edge of the island. A sliver of red bleeds in the corners blurring together with blue and another growl resonates in the room making Dean's spine go rigid.
"Think it's cause," Dean huffs, eyes drooping and head falling to the side. "Think it's cause I love you."
Dean sits down on his bed with a huff and undoes the top of his towel so it falls at his sides, leaving him naked.
"Should've worn pants." Dean mutters, curling his toes and shivering as he waits for the elevator.
to his collection.
"Deal!" Henricksen shouts.
"I hear the Winchesters are very traditional." he comments and Dean slows his chewing with a thoughtful frown.
Castiel bites his lip and pushes himself down on it enough so the tip breaches him.
"Would you like to do check-ins with me through text?"
"Me too. Think I could love you more though." Dean says through a yawn.
The smell of rain, of a cascading coldness, is suddenly much closer.
"C-Cas!" Dean's voice cracks, from pleasure or from shame he isn't sure. "I'm–oh,
"When Miss Naomi comes back, it would be wise for you to stop askin' about Leviathan Blossom." Benny levels him with a look. "Take care of that Alpha and yourself." he tips his head then walks out of the shed.
The door's lock clicks open and open slowly.
Dean groans. They don't live together so Dean isn't even sure if what happened to Castiel during his drop. It must've been horrible, especially since Castiel said the forbidden word. When they first started, Castiel was shunned from anything involving sex since he was a child and starting at twenty-five with that type of trauma beat into you will definitely do some damage.
Castiel quivers and keens.
"You know, I just don't get it. Why that asshole liked you over me. I helped him make all of this! I helped him make
"You were."
Castiel remembers the promise. He uses what little grace he has to send comforting touches Dean's way, sometimes if he saves up enough. he can blend with the shadows to see him. Castiel knows other Angels want Dean too, they want what Michael can hopefully never get.
"I love you too, De."
"O-ohh," Dean's bottom lip trembles and his stomach tenses and relaxes as he tries to take it in. "'M full."
Anna surveys the room quietly, something akin to nostalgia swims in her eyes, and steps closer to Dean.
He shouldn't have left. If he stayed then Sam would still be–he
"Can we talk later about everything? I mean, no pressure, you just–I never heard you talk this much and it seems like you made so much progress."
Sorry for my lateness in updating! I hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
"Yeah. It's the only way I can get calm, if not I'll get irritated or like I'm missing something."
"Nasty motherfucker." he mummers fondly, swinging his leg over Castiel's hip while the other is cocked above Castiel's own curved ones.
Opening the door, Dean toes off his shoes and peels off his clothing, letting them pool to the floor, before trudging to the bed.
Dean's heart pounds against his ribcage, his throat suddenly dry and scratchy as he stares at the ceiling.
Castiel obeys then turns Dean so his back is pressed against Castiel's clothed chest. Castiel's lips graze Dean's shoulder gently, causing the younger to shiver.
Sam gives Dean his infamous, unimpressed bitchface. "You two seem real close for a patient/therapist relationship."
Dean makes a weak noise in the back of his throat in acknowledgement.
"You leavin' now?"
"Yes. I really am sorry, Dean." Castiel answers solemnly.
A sickness given to him by Pestilence himself during the darkest hour of Dean's creation that is making him feel this way.
"You want me to be your first kiss, sugar?" Dean brings his hand up and brushes his lips against Castiel's own.
Dean pats down the bed until he finds the lump of his phone. He hesitates, scared. Acid rests just behind his uvula.
Donna had said while he was in the hospital for evaluation.
"Your pronouns change?" Dean prompts, getting up slowly, as if Castiel's a bunny he's trying not to scare off.
would be something to see.
Dean closes his eyes tightly and sighs. "That night," he stops himself, chewing the inside of his cheek. "I wish you never saw it."
he thinks.
"Fuck off." he grumbles into his sheets.
"A large coffee, black, please. And a honey cookie."
It takes them two months of arguing and forgiving for them to have a firm foundation of the house, then a month to install plumbing and electricity, and another month for insulation. All in all, it takes them thirteen months to finish their four bedroom house.
"And Gabriel? Where's Gabriel?"
"What is this called?" Castiel ranks another moan out of Dean when he grazes his prostate.
Castiel looks down at Earth a final time, Dean's figure going blurry as he leaves with Anna, then walks out of his room with an unhurried flourish.
A tear hits the screen when he presses the first number.
"Didn't take you for an Angel who likes sex Jazz." Dean teases when soft saxophone begins to emit from the speakers. He's more a rock kind of guy but he can get behind this. Only because Castiel did so much for him today.
Dean swallows and closes his eyes. "S-Sam," he rasps, inhaling shakily. "Sammy!" he hollers, ignoring how hot his cheeks have gotten because of the tears sliding down his face; ignoring how his cock is throbbing from where it's cupped in Dean's hands, stained with his earlier release.
Dean towels off the rest of his body in a daze. He stops midway, eyebrows pinched together.
"Do you think Dean would be satisfied with this tiny dick?" Castiel whimpers, lowering his head.
"What're you studying?" Dean snaps Castiel out of his own spiral and into a whole different one. Castiel brightens with a smile.
Castiel's hand slides over his belly and Dean wants this feeling, this overwhelming nausea and panic, to go away.
"It's only ten?" Dean squints at the clock on the stove as he puts on his leather jacket over his flannel. He rubs tiredly at his eyes while he shoves his feet inside of his boots, stomping a few times to make sure they're secure. He takes one last fleeting look around him before knocking against the wood three times and picking up his keys from the glass dish and leaving.
"Honestly, that Omega. We has to send the hounds out looking for 'em. Going to that pond–" John sighs, voice gruff and disapproving.
The camera pans to a gloomy looking area with upbeat music and Castiel claps his hands excitedly.
Castiel kisses the top of his head and chuckles when Dean whines.
Castiel makes a noise of interest. "Which one?"
"...bitch." he rasps, rubbing at his throat. Naomi rolls tilts her head back, her eyes hooded as she looks down at Dean before she walks around the living room to admire the new artworks strung up on the walls.
(I can't write sex scenes.)
figuring out how to move out of someone's house is exhausting.
Castiel turns around slowly, his eyes red and body shivering from the chilly air that breezes past. Dean doesn't think about why Castiel can feel the cold or why Castiel needs to eat sometimes, all he wants is to hold, to protect like Castiel did for him.
"I wanted to ask about Sam, sir."
"I'm sorry, Dean."
"But no. You leave alone the man who left his children behind. A mother would never do that." Eve starts laughing, one full of bitterness and impatience. "It's my fault. I was too eager in getting back to Earth."
Lucifer's lip tick upward sadly and nods his head before exiting the room, shutting the door with a soft click.
"No shit?" Dean laughs and Castiel joins with his own small chuckles. "At least you got out of that crappy situation."
"M-mo-mommy! 'M cumming! 'M c-cumming, mommy!" Castiel shakes violently against Dean as he spills all over Dean's hand. Dean sucks in his bottom lip and rolls his hips in a slow dirty grind against Castiel's sweaty thighs.
"It would be odd for God's successor to be infertile, especially during a rut," she hooks two fingers into his turtleneck and tugs. "You should see Anna after taking care of Castiel." Naomi steps back with a small, insincere grin. "Your brother is getting better, isn't he?"
"We're taking her back." Dean states as he pulls out a dusty ID that must've been hidden in the depths.
"Color?" Castiel asks again, leaning back on his heels and spreading Dean's thighs over his lap. Dean's balls jump with his cock and he keens, "'S green, Daddy."
He grimaces at it, the words seem like he didn't type them. Grunting, Dean walks into the bathroom to shower. The water is cold, it makes his cock shrivel and nipples hard but grounds him enough so he feels like a person. Brown and red mix with clear going down the drain but he doesn't feel a speck cleaner.
"Henrikson gave me the files for the Novak case."
Dean would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous, ecstatic, scared. Castiel is trusting him enough with this, to share a different, difficult level of intimacy; it's not fair to do it alone.
"This is your brother's feather. It smelled different and I thought that Sam would've gotten something out of it." Dean shrugs, tucking it away.
"When you call me Cas, do you think of her?"
Castiel tugs Dean's head up by his hair and kisses him fiercely; their teeth knock together and their tongues explore each other's mouths. Castiel removes his fingers from the abused hole before moving their position; Dean on his back, legs wrapped firmly around Castiel's waist, with Castiel's hands either side of his head.
"It's said that the sense of time is the first thing to go when having a mental disorder. When I asked you to count it took about fifty seconds until you reached thirty." Castiel explains. Dean grits his teeth and takes a large gulp of water from the glass.
Dean blinks up at the ceiling, an uncomfortable wet lodge forming in his throat. "You didn't–I wasn't uncomfortable. I just didn't want Jo to overhear or know about us–not that there is an
"M-mommy! It's–ngh!" Castiel grunts, eyebrows creased in concentration. "Oooh!"
"I don't understand why I can't lead by myself."
Lucifer's eyes shine and Gabriel hums. "Anna didn't say it wasn't allowed. As long as one of us accompany you."
"That wasn't so hard was it? You said it so wonderfully too. Such a good boy." Dean praises. "C'mon," Dean strokes Castiel's dick with the tip of his finger. "Show me what you wanna do to her."
Dean raises the sheets to cover his chest, suddenly insecure.
"I think they're both shitty people. It's like when you used to be an escort and my father brought it up the day before the wedding. You were gonna leave back to Russia because your trust got broken and that's exactly what Elizabeth and her family is doing. Andre left a corrupt situation which I am so glad he did but he's still sexist, demanding, controlling, and rude."
Anna's hand brushes against his stomach and glows a blinding blue before it settles. She licks the shell of his ear and whispers quietly.
"Hello?" he whispers tentatively, feeling stupid. Stupid with a crush.
"It was still a successful birthday, yes?" Castiel's voice is light now, it still has that gravelly tone but it's soft around the edges. Dean feels heat rise to his cheeks.
"She's an Intelligence Angel." Lucifer says, looking out the window, as soon as Dean opens the door. Lucifer turns around, glances down at Dean's stomach, back up, then frowns.
Dean sucks in his bottom lip and bounces his head once. "Don't leave me, please."
"I don't have a lot of energy left." Lucifer rasps, clenching his hand. "If we get caught, I can't get us out."
"Is it alright if I call you the day before I have to have to work?"
"You have clients this early in the morning?" Dean slides the cookie over the counter as Castiel taps his card gently against the reader. It's only seven in the morning, the sun has just barely woken up themselves.
Castiel hums happily, snapping his fingers to turn on the lights and sitting the two up against the headboard.
Castiel sighs, irritation climbing up his spine and slowly makes his way to the bed. "I had a bad day today, Dean. I wanted my baby to make it better, that is why I left you like this. Stuffed with a vibrator, dumb, cock hungry. Maybe I was hoping for too much."
The room smells like sex and sweat, it smells like
Say it. Say it in English, Castiel.
i am alive, just very depressed. i promise i'm trying, my friends.
"Probably order some pizza, find a shitty Netflix Original to judge. What about you, doc?"
Angel, Donna."
Deciding to put in behind him, Dean shuffles around the study a bit more. A dark red book with thin gold lining catches his attention; similar to all the other ones scattered and there's nothing extra extraordinary about it except that fact that it isn't caked with dust and has been moved recently.
Dean watches his friend leave towards the stairs before opening the door to his room. Dean slides down the door once he's in his room and chokes out a dry sob.
"Of course." Dean's heart clenches when Castiel looks up with a forced smile when Dean slides the coffee over to him. "I'll see you on Friday, Mr. Winchester."
"Waking him is punishable by being stripped of your grace." Lucifer explains and Eve shrugs, making it clear that their problem is none of hers.
Castiel thrusts forward eagerly, clumsily, like a virgin, his tip nestles in comfortable between Dean's warm walls and he leans forward to put his hands on the desk.
When Dean gets home his back his aching and his knees are clicking as he toes off his shoes. He gets some water from the tap before padding to his and Cas' bathroom only to stop in his tracks and gape.
The office is dark but the large array of windows allows the city lights and the luminating moon shine through halfway. The silhouette raises its hands in surrender and tilts its head.
The phone rings again. He licks his lips, tongue tasting salty tears and snot, then thumbs at the device again. Puts it on speaker so he can't throw it across the room if the noise is too loud in his ear.
"I'll say I'm sick with the plauge."
"Fuck, fuck, o-oh! I'm c-coming, Cas, I'm-
His eyes flicker to the scribble on the note.
She blinks a few times, surprised. "Ms. Bradbury, sir. Let me introduce you to the Novaks."
If he talks more, Dean will ask about him. Ask about his wings. Can he even handle that?
Castiel's steps are slow and calculated as he comes to sit next to Dean and carefully curls his fingers around Dean's palm. Dean tightens the grip and leans against Castiel's shoulder.
"Family business. Started when I was sixteen but Bobby wanted me to branch out."
and made Castiel feel
Dean frowns, stepping closer with an outstretched hand but Castiel backs away.
This WAS NOT an excuse to write over 1000 words just so I could get some needy, bottom Dean. I swear.
and why does he have to be so
Hot droplets land on Dean's face. His cheeks, his nose, the corner of his own tear ducts.
Castiel stares into Dean's eyes as he begins to unbutton his shirt.
"Pretty puppy," Castiel grumbles into Dean's neck as he noses affectionately at his jaw and behind his ears. Castiel slides his hand underneath Dean's shirt only to grip the fabric from the inside and tug at it until it rips and the thread pushes it's limits until Dean is bare and flushed against the door.
"Princess?" a voice calls through the thick wooden door.
He taps the excess off his cigarette and analyzes Benny. There's something off about him; his scent spiked in bitterness when he talked about Purgatory and twisted in fear when he mentioned Naomi.
Dean pulls his sleep shirt over his head and drags his hand over his face.
Tall. Long limbs. Hair that would put Taylor Dayne's to shame. And puppy dog eyes anywhere that Dean would know anywhere.
Dean's body hurts. His thighs are cramping even though his whole weight is on Castiel's lap, the tip of Castiel's nails actually scrape against his prostate in a way that makes his cock hard but soften at the same time, and his arms are heavy as well as his eyes. He fucking loves it.
Ah, Castiel thinks when is heart jumps, this is what love is.
"Yup. I thought I was transgender after I came of age and had to start dressing like Princess of Winchester. I liked putting on the dresses and the skirts and the, um, anyway. It made me feel pretty. I thought only girls were allowed to feel pretty so I thought I was meant to be a girl. Turns out I'm just a guy who likes dressing pretty. Nothing's wrong with it."
"Shouldn't you be asking your mate that?" Castiel snarks with jealousy. Dean smooths out the bottom of his dress to sit down on the bench and turns his head to look into Castiel's eyes.
"Look at me." he orders before sliding the rest of his cock inside Dean's leaking passage. Dean lets out a choked gasp and moans loudly, head tilted and back arched.
"When Sam was born you were so happy to have a baby brother to play with, you guys did everything together. Then one day, you were probably ten when it happened, you and Sam went to that little pond. It was so far away and I don't even know how you guys made it there but you guys went and only Sam came back." Mary puts a hand over her heart and clutches the fabric. "I was so terrified and I told John we should have let Jo teach you to swim."
Slick slides down the inside of Dean's thigh and he can see Castiel's nostrils flare. Dean finally gets his brain to communicate with his body again and he backs up to the study's entrance.
Shit, this is not how he wanted this to happen.
Dean blinks at Castiel, the Angel's smile now lazy and droopy as he begins to fall asleep. Dean shuffles and wraps Castiel's naked torso with his wing. His body feels like it's sinking into the bed and his bladder tingles with the need to pee but Castiel is snoring lightly beside him and Dean can finally start planning for
He's a crazy person. A literal crazy person who belongs to the loony bin. How can Castiel do that to him? How can he make Dean feel relieved and safe by simply touching him?
"Dean, Castiel's Omega."
"I take it we're in understanding?"
Dean kicks his door shut and it swings before clicking softly. He goes to make his way to the washroom but knocks his knee against the vanity in the darkness, letting out a stream of curses. He backs up until he hits the light switches and flinches back at the brightness.
"Nice meeting you too, Cas." Dean whispers before getting up and backing out the room, stumbling a little in the process. When he makes it to the front door, Dean all but shoves his feet inside his boots and spirts to his car. He collapses back against the cold seats and quickly shoves his hand down his pants to tug awkwardly at his cock until he comes inside his boxers with a pained groan.
"You know 'em?"
Not edited.
His body is manhandled onto the marble counter and the Alpha stuffs his nose into Dean's neck, nuzzling and mouthing against his scent gland. Dean's hands clench into fists, pathetic, gasping sound escapes his throat, and a pressure begins to build up in his throat and behind his uvula.
Castiel nods once and steps outside of the room and Dean quickly shuts the door behind him.
"Let's go check on Claire-Bear and Jack."
It lies next to the discarded dress and shoes.
"Goin' shy on me, baby?" Daddy asks kindly. Dean squirms and nods. He likes when Daddy gets like this, all deep rumbles that make Dean's chest vibrate and his heart stutter. Daddy doesn't talk like this often, sometimes he has bad days and doesn't talk at all or grunts out a couple of sentences. Now, filthy words roll of Daddy's tongue like it's his job.
"Yeah?" Dean looks up at Castiel with a small, lazy smile. "Will you cuddle me tonight?"
Dean isn't sure if he dozed off or he wasn't paying close enough attention but suddenly there's the sound of Miracle's collar clinking against metal, probably her water bowl.
"Our aunt, technically. She was father's second in command aside from me but I stepped down when I met Sam. She protects all of us, especially Cassie since he will be getting father's power soon." Lucifer explains.
"Winchester." Jo greets, a grin on her otherwise stoic face. She still smells like the Roadhouse, something between beer and limes. Dean ruffles her hair.
"She might as well be the Devil himself."
Dean blinks his eyes open, grateful for the never ending darkness in Castiel's room. "Water?" he clears his throat and coughs for emphasis.
"Moldova!" he cheers while Dean rolls his eyes.
The flush on Dean's cheeks go further up to the tips of his ears. "Both? Mainly masturbation."
"I-I didn't get t-to bite." Dean rasps after a while, eyes heavy and body aching.
"I wasn't expecting it and I felt like a fuckin' asshole for gettin' hard while you were..." Dean gestures widely before aggressively opening the carton of milk. This time, Castiel pays attention.
Dean lets out a sigh before pulling out and watching as a pool of saliva and cum slide out of Castiel's mouth and onto his neglected cock. Castiel's nose is a rosy red, along with his neck and cheeks, his eyes are shiny with tears, and his lips are ripped and swollen; his legs are spread open wide and his cock is hanging out of his pants looking like it's about ready to burst
Lucifer bites his lip and nods sadly. "I haven't been able to visit him lately. Dean, I love him, you have to believe that I would never–I love him."
"C'mon." Dean fists the sheets below him as he slightly starts to rock back and forth. "Make it to the washroom." Dean mutters, scooting forward on the bed in order for both bottoms of his feet to meet the floor. He lets out a small exhale of relief before slowly rising and standing on Bambi like legs.
"It was here eons ago and father took care of it but history repeats itself. Cassie was visiting Michael and his mate in New Zealand when he was dosed. He came back different and I felt helpless, again." Lucifer stares at the window darkly.
"I don't take kindly strangers on my property." the voice speaks carefully, menacingly. It makes goosebumps appear on Dean's arms.
"Your boob won't fit." Castiel jokes.
a nostalgic part of his mind says. A part he wishes he could bury. His phone rings, a jarring ringtone that he doesn't recognize because nobody calls him. Nobody is
Dean hides his face in Castiel's chest. "It looks better dry." he tries to sass but it comes out tentative.
Dean looks up at the ceiling. "People like me, we ain't got soulmates. We can't even love ourselves, how are we supposed to love someone who we, inherently, already do?" Dean argues, irritated and his thighs clench and unclench.
"You're an Omega."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean is on his period when Castiel finally gets the courage to kiss him.
he thinks.
Castiel clears his throat again then sits on their newly made bed and pats the spot next to him. Dean frowns a little but gets up to sit next to his fiancé. He reaches over to squeeze Castiel's hand reassuringly.
Lucifer shoves his hands in his pockets. " I couldn't find him so I looked through his stuff. Apparently he was married to this woman, on the back of an old polaroid it said Andrea. I guess he outlived her and Naomi promised to bring her back."
"Your father will do everything in his power to make sure that you do." his mother replies evenly despite the low amusement in her voice. Her hand comes up to brush the short hairs on the base of his neck comfortingly.
"It's okay, it's okay," Castiel comforts. "We can stop, do you want to stop?"
Jo mimics. "You're going back to the same house that has your–"
Posted at one in the morning and not read over
"Dean,"
Sam's rocking slows and his throat works over time to get the word out.
"Yes, mother." Dean mumbles before walking past everyone to get back inside and to his room. When he gets there, Jo and Charlie are arguing over which corset goes best with the dress, one Rowena had up and made him after hearing about the ball, one that had him on a special diet so he could fit into it since he "gained a few pounds." as his father so eloquently put it.
Just leave him alone! Leave. Him. Alone!" Dean groans with his head tilted back.
"I'm Donna Hanscom. It's nice to meet you, Dean. I have heard nothing but kind words from everyone." Donna sets the box on the table between then sits down on a big, pale blue chair in front of Dean. She pulls a notepad from the second layer of the table.
Castiel looks up to the ceiling of the washroom and sighs his truth. "Me too."
Dean closes his eyes and Garth wraps his skinny arms around solid muscle, seemingly forgetting of his werewolf abilities and squeezing the air out of Dean's lungs and lifting him up a solid two inches off the ground.
How is it possible that Castiel looks even better than the last time Dean saw him? The Seraph's skin has healthier glow than before; his hair is slicked back; his suit is pressed neatly and the black, wool fabric makes his body look more lean and tight–Dean's eyes flicker down to his slacks and quirks his eyebrows, tight everywhere it seems–His dark blue tie is on backwards and Dean can't help but take a step forward with the intention of fixing it.
"If-if you could show yourself out? It was nice meeting you Dean." Castiel's voice wavers a little and Dean's dick pulses lazily.
Charlie blinks, her features carefully blank before an added flush appears on her cheeks and Gabriel cackles loudly.
"I'm coming, thank you." Dean rolls off the bed, his feet touching the ground first and instead of dressing appropriately, he yanks his faux fur robe off his  bathroom's door hanger and shoves his arms through the sleeves.
, as Dean cries out his orgasm and twitches against the grass.
"I think I might end up eating something else."
One that's painfully ripped from deep in his stomach and has his lips stained the faintest of reds.
Castiel returns back to his original position, the tip of his cock nudging Dean's hole. "Ne meurs pas." Dean can feel the nudge of Castiel's smiling cheeks against his heated ones.
Dean likes it. Dean
Dean presses his phone between his ear and his shoulder and tugs his pants and boxers down, allowing his cock to flap against his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't tell me you're into watersports."
Dean sits down next to him. "Is Lucifer the one who took your wings?"
Blood pumps loudly in Dean's ears and his knees go weak at the overpowering scent the Angel gives off. His Omega makes his mind go dizzy with want and slick dampens his underwear, dripping down his taint to coat his balls uncomfortably.
"Yes."
"I do."
"Like with flowers and dates and shit?"
Castiel's eyes widen and it thinks. "Will you throw up on me again?"
"He needs your help."
Disclaimer: I have no update schedule. I just write when I feel like it and sometimes I try to put it out as soon as I can. I apologize if that means long waits in between updates. This chapter isn't the best but the next one will be way better!
It doesn't take long to catch up to Dean. The sand makes it hard to storm off in wedding shoes and Dean's shaking too much. They're a good distance away from the wedding when Dean turns to him.
"Sometimes I think I deserved it." Dean whispers.
The inside of Dean feels clammy; like the awkward dampness you feel when clasping hands with your first middle school romance while their friends are making loud, obnoxious hollers in the background. His nerves are unsettled, restless, and saliva coats so much of his mouth that he goes a bit bilious. Dean rolls over with a pained groan, he can feel his heart thump achingly inside his chest and he rubs across his chest with a short wince.
"I'm not a Hunter anymore." Dean puts out his cigarette on the folder then tosses it back on Henricksen's lap.
Dean ignores the burning in his eyes and nods stiffly before climbing up the stairs to the guest room. He holds his toothbrush in his mouth as he sets his suit on the bed then pads to the bathroom. By the time he's in the shower his body is loose and lazy and the pressure on his bladder–that he's just noticing– releases onto the tiled shower floor.
"What's it look like, bitch,"
"This Christmas at Ma's house. Whole family's gonna be there."
Their swaying has slowed down to a stop and Dean tenses, his arms tighten around Castiel's neck and his heart beats a little harder.
"When you were going to tell me about your boyfriend?" Sam asks when Dean walks out, effectively causing him to startle and let out a short string of curses.
"Tub. Can we?" Castiel asks tentatively. Dean reaches over to turn on the faucet. He allows Castiel to get in first once the water is warm, Castiel's back toward the wall so Dean still can't see it. Dean gets him next, hesitant but Castiel reassures him with a small smile.
“Jack, is this-”
His neighbour?
“- get some shut eye”
“Sometimes we write songs too. And,” Anna hesitates, evidently opening up to the rest of the group, “I’d kind of like to play them. To other people. Like… in public.”
Castiel’s eyes look kind.
Castiel’s jaw almost drops off of his face.
Castiel walks over, and Dean can make out his blue eyes, and the hints of stubble covering his jaw. His mess of brown hair is tousled wildly, and Dean wonders if it’s so messy because of the stress of moving, or if it always just sits like that. He holds Dean’s gaze, his expression not quite readable.
Cas hugs him back.
“A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet?” She offers, but at Castiel’s lack of reaction she wordlessly drops her gaze to the floor, guiltily scuffing her shoe on the wooden floorboards.
It’s half way through his shift before Ellen unexpectedly arrives at the store, tying an apron around herself as she walks up to the counter. Ellen is the owner and manager, and so isn’t usually on site, but she’ll make regular trips to the store to help out with inventory and serving customers at peak times - Dean reckons it’s just an excuse to spend quality mother-daughter/employee time with Jo, seeing as these visits are always made when Jo’s on shift. Although, come to think of it, with the store’s small pool of employees, and Jo’s almost constant presence in the building, it’s not much of a surprise.
Dean doesn’t hide his surprise at the question, and he looks at her quizzically.
Jack smiles.
“There’s nothing left for me down there anymore, Sam. I’m tired, and … if now ain’t my time, when is?”
Castiel seems somewhat surprised at the interaction, glances down at the radio, before turning to look at Dean.
Sam smiles, leaving them a few moments, before turning to Jack as Dean and Cas pull away.
Dean’s brows furrow for a moment at the unsavoury nickname, before leaning forward and pointing to the road.
A few moments later, Dean and Gabriel have exchanged numbers, and Dean doesn’t have time to regret his decision before Gabriel slams on the accelerator and the car is speeding off.
“Listen, I’m not one to talk about being messed up, but…” Dean starts, and he turns to face Castiel, “are you alright, man?”
Keep to yourself, stay out of trouble, don’t get attached
“And I play the tambourine!” Gabriel yells from the front seat, his voice drowned out slightly by the voice of the Smooth Radio Station host.
“You think, after all this time, there could be anywhere you go that I wouldn't follow?”
“I…” Castiel begins, but he can’t finish.
Sam nods sharply, looking to his brother who seems serene and happy. Sam turns to Cas, who seems to wear the same expression. Jack places his other hand on Dean’s arm.
As they make their way out through the door of the complex, Anna lets go, and Dean takes the opportunity to move to Castiel’s side.
“Cas… I wouldn’t- None of us would be here if it weren’t for you. The love and humanity you have shown me - it speaks of nothing more but the purest of souls.”
Dean’s wakes, and all he can see is bright light.
“So you brought us here?” Dean asks, his hand falling back to his side, “Wherever… here is.”
Dean thinks he should feel awkward, but he doesn’t.
It’s a few moments before he hears footsteps, and a figure walks up beside him.
His dad’s voice - Dean! You’re not lettin’ a lady carry her own bags are you? -  echoes in his head.
“Less light pollution” Dean muses, his eyes also fixed on never ending darkness intercepted by thousands of balls of light a million light years away.
“I do really appreciate the job, Ellen. The job, and everything-”
“Come on.” He says, gesturing to the car, and Castiel is surprised he finds the will to move to the front passenger door, open it, and sit.
“Yeah, yeah… I guess so.”
“When I killed Chuck, all of the living souls he took were restored back to Earth.”
‘Oh, hello…? ” A gruff voice tinged with surprise.
“All i’m saying is - all of us have bad days, but… Dean, you need to be careful you don’t carry on like this. I can’t keep makin’ excuses for you.”
Jack nods.
Dean startles, dropping his hand to see blue eyes, and a mess of brown hair.
Dean doesn’t see a lot of the Novak’s for a while. Every now and then he’ll bump into Anna or Castiel on the stairs, and they’ll share polite smiles, but nothing over the top. Sometimes Anna will be on her phone and won’t notice him, or Castiel will be searching for something in his bag and will be too focused to shoot Dean a glance.
They stand for a moment.
Dean nods, and Castiel can feel his eyes on him, but he doesn’t meet his gaze.
Dean tries to pay, but Anna and Castiel are insistent.
You should give people a chance!
“I’ll see you soon bitch” Dean jokes, moving to hug the younger man tightly
They sit for not much longer after that, before Anna starts yawning and they decide it’s time to head back.
“So, Dean!” she smiles, “One of the first questions I ask anyone: What’s your favourite song?”
Jack looks at them both, eyes gentle.
Dean smiles and pulls him into an embrace. And, after all this time, it’s all they need.
Castiel nods emphatically, Anna just smiles brightly at Dean. The others don’t act so enthusiastically.
The majority of his shift is filled with the middle-aged residents of Smith Center. The men are usually looking for spare parts for their tools or household machinery, most of which they don’t have, and Dean has to direct them to the hardware store or garage in the centre of town. Some of the women that come in wink at him suggestively as he cashes up their items, but today he’s not in the mood to play along, shooting them quick, fake smiles as he hands them their bags. When the school day ends a flurry of teenagers pour in, counting out enough coins to buy packets of candies and gummy worms. One boy complains moodily that the slushy machine still isn’t working - ‘-and it’s been four weeks now! - but Dean just shrugs apathetically, asking if there’s anything else he can help him with, or if he’s done taking up space in his store.
The light above the middle aisle flickers incessantly.
“Anna!”, he whispers loudly, looking apologetically at Dean.
Dean has switched with Jo, and is emptying crates of bottles of cola into the fridge. He glances over to see Ellen and Jo talking with each other, in a moment of respite between customers. Jo nods at her mum, before quickly muttering something, and they both turn to look at Dean. He turns his head swiftly back to focus on his task at hand.
“Eileen?” Sam asks, hopefully, tears welling in his eyes.
“New neighbours. New noisy partying neighbours.” He explains simply “ Was up til 3 with it. It’s fine though.”
Of course Zachariah would pick now to bring up some minor issue, that will inevitably leave Dean inconvenienced in some way.
Over the meal, Dean finds out more information about them all. Castiel is 23 - only a year younger than Dean - and Anna is 19.
i dont care i didn't see 15x20 this is what happened
Somewhere in Dean’s head, a line has been crossed, and his face hardens.
He doesn’t even have time to stop to complain when his key jams in his apartment door again, but that sonofabitch Zachariah will definitely be getting a piece of his mind - that’s if the guy’s ever around, at least trying to pretend that he’s performing the basic duties of a landlord.
“Well, seeing as you’re new I’ll excuse you for being late. Come on in and take a seat. I think there’s one near the back, next to Josie.”
Jack turns to all of them
“Where the hell are we?” Sam asks, brow furrowed, sitting himself up and glancing round again.
“Stay with me.” Dean says softly, and Cas takes a sharp breath in, “ Stay with me in Heaven.”
“Hey, what the
“You’ll do just fine. You’ve got so much goin’ for you Sam. And when it’s all over, I’ll be waiting here to knock your head in”
He peers round Ellen to look at Jo  - what a grass - before looking back at the older woman
“Always” Cas replies back tearily, “Look after yourself, Sam.”
As Dean speaks, Sam’s eyes fill more and more with tears. He pauses for a moment after Dean finishes.
Dean sighs, because despite the fact that this chick deserves no help from his right now, he can’t ignore his conscience. He sighs.
“So… Freckles? What’s a guy like you doing in a place like this?” The unknown man drawls, coming to stand next to the woman, taking a swig from a beer bottle and leaning on her shoulder as she lets out a chuckle.
Knocking on the door, he stares at the golden 7 for a few moments until the door opens, a woosh of warm air laced with the scent of cigarette smoke and sickly sweet cherry introducing him to someone he’s never seen before. She’s shorter than Dean, with thick brunette hair and red lips curved into what looks like more of a smirk than a smile.
Dean could get mad, especially considering the guitar-to-head incident, but if he’s honest he just doesn’t have the energy. Plus, the kid looks like she could use a break.
“No Dean, this is not me firing you,” she rolls her eyes, “Look, I’ll be straight with you kid. I took you on because I could see how much you needed the job, and like I said - I like you. But if you’re gonna get anywhere with this, you gotta start lightening up a little! Hell, it’s been what, two, three years? And you’ve hardly said more than a few words to any of us. You can see how I’d be a bit concerned at this point?”
“Well… thank you, very much.” he says, before rushing to pick up the items, “We really won’t keep you any longer.”
Cas shakes his head in disbelief, as Jack continues.
Dean watches her turn and grab a guitar amp with her free hand, heaving it onto the pavement. She stands and enthusiastically wipes her brow.
Six weeks go by before he enters Apartment 7 again.
Gabriel smiles.
Sam nods, as the bright light starts to envelop them all
He attended his classes, making sure to work diligently: why be willing to fail now, after all his work?
The girl quirks her eyebrow, shaking her head.
Dean must be dreaming
“Listen,” he starts, “My brother and sister are out here on their own, and Cassie is oh so hell bent on doing this himself but… everyone needs their family sometimes, right?”
“I think I am… no, I know I am. I feel it. I feel like… I’m what I was supposed to be.”
“Well,” Dean gives Castiel a courteous wave, “I think i’m gonna-”
“I mostly sing and play guitar. Most of us are pretty musical - Cas plays guitar and piano, and-”
Cas stands, eyes travelling over the older Winchester’s face. Dean stands, the shock of the moment starting to wear off.
“Do you have any siblings, Dean?” Anna asks innocently, sipping her lemonade, and before he has to think of how to answer he’s saved by the waitress dumping a giant plate of pasta in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ellen sighs, breath escaping through her nose
Castiel turns the tuning dial on the radio, listening out for anything familiar. It takes a while before he finally settles on a song that’s unfamiliar to Dean, and leans back into his seat, gaze facing out of the window and his hand gently tapping on the door frame to the beat as a new song starts.
They stand motionless for a few moments. Dean hangs his head, eyes darting as he thinks.
“In fact, even Kansas city has enough of that. What’s a town like this got? Amazing job prospects? Excellent options for first time home buyers? Or maybe… you’ve got something to run away from… wouldn’t that make for an interesting story.”
“My little brother hasn’t told me much about you  Dean,” Gabriel says, as Castiel walks over to the speaker to turn the volume down, glancing to look at his brother at the mention of his name, “Stud like you should be living it up in the city! Why, you certainly wouldn’t be out of place at one of those heinous college frat parties - plenty of boobs n’ beer amirite?”
Cas steps forward, taking Dean’s face in his hands and placing a soft kiss to the man’s lips. For a moment, time stands still. When they break apart, Cas looks happier and more at peace than Dean has ever seen him.
“Wow” Dean hears, and he turns to see Castiel staring up at the sky, eyes glittering, mouth open in awe.
Unable to cry. Unable to smile. Unable to be relieved that he was still alive, in all sense of the word, Dean Winchester was... Empty.
The angel asked this half serious, half joking as Dean stifled a chuckle.
It was-
Jack wandered in, followed by Sam.
"Well, it did... but I'd do it all again for you."
Dean still sits on the ground, where Castiel had thrown him, as he stares blankly at the plain beige wall of the Bunker. On his left shoulder, a handprint was visible on his sleeve. His handprint. It matched the one etched onto his right shoulder. From twelve years earlier. From when the Angel had yanked him out of Hell.
“Oh my gosh Dean I am so sorry, I told them to keep it dow-”
“So…. is this… is this it?”
He pauses as he locks eyes with Dean.
And Castiel breaks. His sobs rack through his body, his head drooping down, his arms wrapping around his body. It’s a while before the engine starts, and Dean is driving. The streets Castiel knows so well and despises so much fly past, and Castiel wonders if they will blur into oblivion if they go fast enough.
“Sorry,” Dean continues, looking to Castiel, “don’t want to ruin your night, was just wondering if you could keep the noise down a bit? I’m up early tomorrow is all and I’d really appreciate it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas swallows.
“Never heard of her?” he asks, as incredulously and emphatically as his tired body will let him, the alcohol in his system still providing him with a boost of drunken energy.
“Left.” He murmurs, and he continues to give Dean directions until they’re finaly pulling up to his driveway. The rain’s died off, leaving a marble of puddles all along the road.
“Not even God can resurrect someone from the Empty. But… when Chuck died, any deal he had with the Empty was gone. Before you two woke, I went and spoke with them. They were glad to be rid of their ties to Chuck, and I promised to never bother them again if… If I could bring you out of there.”
“Before you go,” he smiles, “There’s one more thing I need to do”
Dean looks up at his brother, the sheen of tears welling in his eyes.
“Is this is?” Meg mutters.
“What the hell?!”’
Chapter title taken from 'Cactus Tree' by Joni Mitchell
When she arrives, she can barely get out a ‘Hey Dea-’ before Dean is running out, grabbing his coat and throwing up a hand in a wave. She shakes her head softly, brow furrowing and drawing her lips into a hard line as she watches Dean slide into the driver’s seat of his Impala.
Sam shakes himself awake, looking around before locking eyes with Dean.
“The day we moved here, we saw a place out of town that has all you can eat spaghetti for $9.99,” Castiel offers, stopping at the edge of the pavement, “You like Italian?”
“You’d do it with me, right C?” She asks hopefully, obviously employing her nickname for her brother.
“Anna!” he scolds, turning to his sister, “Please tell me you have not shirked your responsibilities onto someone i’m assuming is our neighnour? Who I’m assuming you’ve just met?”
They break apart, Dean smiling and punching his brother softly on the shoulder.
“Wow! Yes, that would be so kind of you!” Anna replies instantly, almost as if she had planned this all along, before picking up a microwave and waiting expectantly, smiling widely.
His recent car repair expenses mean he’s had to pick up some evening shifts at Benny’s bar, and as he lies awake at 2 AM having only got home an hour and a half ago, he realises booking one of these shifts before a 7AM Saturday start at the store could have been a massive mistake.
“So what now? Can you bring us back?” Sam asks, and Jack nods, taking a moment to reply.
“Dean..” she starts, and she motions for him to put down the bottles of cola in his hands, “Listen. I like you kid. The customers… tolerate you… most of the time. But - “
Dean huffs out a laugh, and nods as he glances over at the younger woman, who is currently scanning through 15 individual packets of gum.
Dean can tell it’s not going to be one of his better days the moment he wakes up thirty minutes later than his alarm should have gone off. Noticing the time, he yells, throwing off his sheets and swinging his legs over the edge of his bed. It only takes a moment for him to collapse to the floor, his breaking bedframe throwing him off balance. Scrambling up, he limps to the chair he’d thrown his work uniform on the day before.
She laughs nervously, and Dean gives her a short smile, his lips dropping back down as he rubs the sore spot on his forehead.
Before he has a chance to escape the conversation, she smiles excitedly and nods towards his apartment building
“You don’t happen to live here do you?” She asks, biting her lip worriedly, the slight blush across her cheeks a hint of her lingering embarrassment.
His fridge is pretty bare.
“The connection out here’s a piece of shit” Meg spits, her Maps app failing to load as quickly as she’d like.
“Thank you.” Castiel says softly, reaching to the back of the car and picking up his stuff.
“That’s really the first thing you ask someone?”
Before the light consumes them, Dean reaches out his hand to Castiel’s. He grips his hand tight.
He sighs, pulling himself up and dragging his feet to his front door. Opening it, he rubs his hand over his face.
“The In Between… yes”
“You can just put them down wherever” Anna smiles, placing the microwave on the kitchen shelf, before calling out, “Cassie, I met our neighbour!”
The group pile into Gabriel’s car, Dean sitting on the back seat at the right hand side. The feeling of not sitting in the driver’s seat is alien to him at this point, and he kind of feels like a kid being driven to school again, but he ignores the uneasiness as they click their seatbelts into place and set off. Gabriel and Meg argue over music choices as Anna turns to Dean in the back seat.
Jack turns to him and smiles, nodding.
“Well, obviously it’s a beautiful song, but... I guess part of it is the meaning,” he explains, turning his head towards Dean, “At least to me, whenever I would listen to this when I was younger, I… I don’t know.”
“Like I said, ” Dean shrugs the hand off his shoulder, feeling himself get more annoyed by the second, “try and keep the noise down.”
Sam lets out a laugh.
Not much conversation is made, they’re all too busy digesting their food. Every now and then Meg and Gabriel will have a whispered conversation, both chuckling, before returning to their beers. Castiel and Anna lie on the blanket, Castiel pointing out constellations to his sister.
She smiles slightly and playfully punches his shoulder
Dean’s about to protest, but Gabriel is convincing, giving him the most solemn, pleading look he can muster.
“Okay, your packs are here,” Mrs. Hershaw declares, handing them to the boy at the top of Castiel’s row, “Just take one and pass them on.”
There’s - nothing.
They stand in silence for a few moments.
He waits half an hour before he decides enough is enough, and he trudges upstairs, rubbing his hand groggily across his face.
Castiel bites the skin on his lip, before smiling slightly and nodding.
Not much younger than Sam,  Dean muses
“Not tryin’ to be rude,“ he says, gritting his teeth, “but that’s none of your business.”
Cas turns to Jack
“A musician, huh?” he asks, almost disbelievingly, “What you play?”
Dean moves to close his door, before Castiel speaks again.
Having been sat in at the wall, Dean is the last to leave their booth, and as they make their way out of the restaurant, their waitress catches him on the way, smacking her lips together as she chews a stick of gum and holds out a slip of paper.
The afternoon comes, and when he gets home he’s more than ready to fall back into bed. He deposits his coat and bag on the hook at his front door and throws his shoes, scraping a hand through his hair. His head has no sooner hit the pillow when he hears a faint knocking.
If this is what getting to know your neighbours is like, he doesn’t want anything more to do with them.
- - -
Sam releases the hug and stands back, walking with Cas towards Dean and Jack.
“Don’t play those games with me, Winchester.” She says, and the tone of her voice makes Dean feel like he’s being told off by his teacher, “Jo says she’s had a couple comments about your behaviour this morning. What’s going on?”
Castiel steps out of the car, closing the door. Dean drives off, and Castiel waits until he’s out of sight before turning and walking into his house.
As usual, he ate lunch alone.
“Sounds good to me!” Gabriel says joyfully, and they pull out of the parking lot.
As the car is brought to a stop, Gabriel stirs, waking Meg and Anna who were leaning on his shoulders. They lazily rub their eyes and stretch.
He hears a murmered
- - -
Ellen’s face pulls into an incredulous expression, and she lets out a short laugh
Dean wonders if Sam still has it.
She shrugs
“Thank you for the lesson today Ma’am.” He says to Mrs.Hershaw as he leaves. She gives him a quick ‘Thank you Castiel’, although her eyes never leave her desk as she packs up.
“I’m a musician, I can tell a lot about someone by their favourite song.”
“I’m sorry Mother.” Castiel says, his eyes downcast, “I forgot my rain jacket. Trust me, it will not happen again.”
Chapter title taken from 'Cactus Tree' by Joni Mitchell
“Um… Hello Dean”
For a moment he thinks he imagines it, before the knock is repeated, louder this time.
At work, the lack of sleep makes Dean grouchy. He’s even more blunt and short with customers, earning him a few raised eyebrows from Jo. His tired brain also means that he takes a whole two minutes to realise he’s scanning the wrong side of a loaf of bread, leaving him flustered, and a line of people waiting impatiently. He mutters out an apology as he serves each patron, their impatient, disapproving frowns a little more cutting than they ought to be.
Gabriel pulls a cooler full of beers out of the trunk, and Meg brings out a blanket, spreading it on the ground. Gabriel offers Dean a beer, which he accepts sceptically, and they all sit in silence on the ground, swigging their drinks.
Dean barely has time to look up, before the hard case smacks him on the head. He falls back a few steps, one hand catching the guitar before it falls to the ground, the other holding his head.
Sam walks to his brother’s side and smiles in agreement.
He looks up at the stars, as he so often had with Sam, feeling a lump in his throat.
Anna knocks at 7PM. She smiles brightly as Dean opens the door, lacing her arm around his and pulling him out. Dean meets Castiel’s eyes, and gives him a startled nod in acknowledgement. Gabriel joins Dean at his left side, apologising profusely for how he behaved the night before. Meg keeps pace, nodding in agreement, but not offering much in way of grovelling.
“As long as you’re happy,” Jack replies, smiling up at him, “That will always be enough for me”
Dean doesn’t drink much more - he’s working in the morning and after Ellen’s speech earlier that day, he decides he needs to start making a good impression. He tries to ignore the part of himself that knows he’s just reluctant to let go in front of people he doesn’t trust yet.
“What I’m trying to say is...” Castiel continues, and Dean’s becoming aware of the heat the body next to him is emanating, Anna dozing away as she lies at her brother’s opposite side, “According to science...even though we can see so many stars right now, there are millions more that we can’t see…”
Sam laughs, breath hitching as a tear rolls down his cheek. He turns to Cas.
For whatever reason, he glances to his left to see Castiel staring out the car window. The other man’s window is rolled down almost the full way, and the wind billows through his hair - Dean wonders if this is why, for the few times he’s seen Castiel up close, his hair always ends up looking so messed up. The light of the passing storefronts and streetlamps illuminates his face, giving him that same, almost angelic glow he’d had the day before - Dean was starting to think that maybe the light was coming from Castiel himself, he couldn’t say he was was one hundred percent sure it wasn’t at this point. As they drive further out of Smith Center, the illuminations are replaced by the headlights of passing cars, bursts of light casting Castiel’s features in white. His eyes are closed, arm resting on the door frame so that his fingers hang loosely out of the window, catching the wind as they drive through the town. Gabriel cranks the radio up, the other inhabitants of the car singing along to an upbeat folk song. Castiel looks content, and Dean can’t help but be fascinated by it.
He pulls the door handle, and is about to step out when he’s stopped by Dean’s voice.
“I’m so sorry” he says softly, looking down at the floor.
“How ‘bout we get to know each other a bit better after this?” Dean smirks, his voice low and husky. Amanda nods slowly, smiling as she turns round, her blonde hair whipping round her head.
“Freckles!”
Dean swallows dryly.
Castiel returns his smile, nodding gratefully.
“I like it.” he says he simply, glancing at Castiel and quirking his lips into a small grin.
Cas stands staring at him for a few moments, his eyes staring into the soul of the man he ripped out of Hell twelve years ago.
Dean nods, and turns to his brother.
Dean hesitates, not really sure where this is going, before he eventually shifts down, lying to rest beside him.
CW for alcohol for this chapter, it's not mentioned too much though

As he steps out of the car, typing ‘how to fix a slushy machine’ into his phone , he also doesn’t notice the guitar falling directly towards him.
When he asks where home is, the topic is somehow turned to Dean.
He’s sleep deprived.
“I have no need.” Castiel says, before returning his gaze to his book.
“I’m as clueless as you at this point, Gabe” Castiel replies, watching Anna’s phone as she tries unsuccessfully to Google ‘Top beauty spots near Smith Center’.
“Found a straggler outside” she announces to the group, who all look up. In the centre of the Novak’s floor is a small circle of three people: Castiel, Anna, and another man Dean doesn’t recognise sit, surrounded by half-full beer bottles and glasses of unknown cocktails, with a deck of cards distributed between the members of the group. The man smirks up at him at the same time as Castiel’s face changes from slightly inebriated to alarmed. Castiel, Anna and the man speak simultaneously at the sight of Dean.
‘Oh, look out!’
He looks at Castiel.
“I’ll be seeing you, Sammy.”
Crickets chirp. The distant hum of cars is barely audible.
Kevin calls in sick for his shift, and so Dean begrudgingly agrees to cover until Jo can come in at 5.
“What is the meaning of this?” She asks, “You are soaked through. Your clothes are ruined.”
“So now Chuck’s gone…” he begins, “Are you…. God, Jack?”
He clears his throat awkwardly, picking up the amp and the guitar that he had just been viciously attacked by, and follows her into the building.
“If if would make you happy, Annie”
Jack smiles sadly and furrows his brow
Somewhere along the line, Castiel gets a small smudge of spaghetti sauce on his cheek.
Gabriel is a couple years older, the three of them being the youngest of six. Meg is a close family friend, particularly to Gabriel and the older siblings, and both of them have come to help Castiel and Anna settle in before heading back home.
Gabriel nods, before looking back to grab his own phone out of his coat pocket.
“This place needs to be destroyed as soon as possible - while I’m God there will be no superficial judgement. Everyone who’s soul is good will be brought to Heaven, and there won’t be a need for a place for someone to decide whether they belong there or not.” Jack places a hand softly on Sam’s forearm, smiling softly, “It’s time, guys”
“Sammy,” Dean yells, hurriedly moving over to rouse him.
The atmosphere is full.
“Love you too Dean.” Sam replies, smiling.
Walking into the kitchen, he sees his mother doing the dishes. As he walks in, she turns, and her face droops in disapproval.
“I’ve only ever heard of this place, I was never sure if it actually-.”
Before he left, he cleaned out his locker, not wanting to inconvenience anyone with the task after he was gone, and the large stack of folders and books in his arms is proving to be a problem. He hasn’t gone far when they start to slip, and suddenly they’re falling out of his arms into a puddle on the pavement. He stands, his hair plastered against his face, his nose and fingers cold, his books being ruined in the rain. Perhaps if he stands here long enough, the rain will wash him away.
“Aw, come on now Annie, that’s not fair,” Meg smiles in the front seat, “Give him some credit - he at least knows how to play the triangle!”
Dean laughs softly and shakes his head.
“So, where are we actually going?” He asks quietly, screening for potential poisoning risks.
Something niggles at the back of Dean’s head. He can’t define it, but it wasn’t there when he left work. Maybe the guitar induced more brain damage than he thought.
“Not bad Ellen, not bad… Yourself?”
“How come?” he asks, and as they turn the corner and pass The Roadhouse he recognises they’re not far from their apartments.
The angel seems just as confused as them. He takes a moment to register Sam’s embrace, before wrapping his arms around the man.
Dean pauses, his groggy brain finding it difficult to read the situation.
“No Dean, I won’t let you give up, not like this.” Sam says, angrily, “After everything we’ve fought for, we finally get the chance at a normal life and you choose this?”
“Are you sure this is what you all want?”
Castiel waits until the pile gets to him. There's no point in taking one, he wouldn’t want to waste the school’s resources, and so he simply takes the pile and passes it on to Dean.
As his eyes grow accustomed to the glow, he props himself up and looks round at the unfamiliar setting.
He opens the door, the usual sea of white making him feel like something loud and vibrant, in a world where he doesn’t belong.
“Wait, so they’re all alive? Bobby, Charlie-”
“Sorry,” Castiel says, sitting back in his seat again, “Joni Mitchell, to me, she’s…. I don’t know, I guess I love her music so much I find it unthinkable that other people wouldn’t have any clue who she is.”
Today was the day that Castiel was going to kill himself.
“Cas,” Dean starts, Sam and Jack turning to him at the sound of his voice.
Castiel huffs in annoyance. Gabriel and Meg are too wrapped up in their own conversation to bother to pay attention to what the two of them are discussing.
Dean nods his head in acknowledgement, checking the bypass for any oncoming traffic.
The brothers nod in understanding, until Sam stops, brow furrowing.
His dad’s voice echoes in his head
Ellen places the remaining bottle of cola into the fridge, before smiling at Dean and walking into the back room.
As he pulls up beside his apartment complex, Dean’s too engrossed in thinking about what he’ll be making for dinner to notice the U-Haul parked outside his building. In lieu of his absence of a lunch earlier that day, he had snuck a couple of granola bars from the shelf (Ellen won’t mind, probably won’t even notice, he tells himself). In the past, he’d have rationed those out over a couple days, but now, the loud rumble coming from his stomach was more than an indication of how hungry he was.
Dean doesn’t sleep much that night.
During his last class, AP English Lit, the feeling of unease that settles in his stomach starts to grow. His insides twist with anticipation, yet, despite everything, he feels scared. He pushes his emotions down, instead trying to concentrate on his teacher. Castiel always found Mrs. Hershaw’s words soothing, her language and interpretation of the literature they were studying so full of wonder and passion for her subject. Even though she too found him indistinguishable from his classmates, out of everyone at this school, she would be the one he missed the most.
“I- When I harnessed the energy to destroy Chuck…. I didn’t realise how powerful it would be. When our forces collided it created this sort of…. explosion . When it was done, I was still alive but...Chuck was gone, and … so were the two of you.”
“Come look at this.’ He says, patting the blanket beside him.
“I think things like that make me feel like there’s something more out there waiting for me, something I haven’t found yet… it’s quite hopeful, don’t you think?.” Castiel continues, and Dean doesn’t say anything.
Halfway through the drive, Anna, Meg and Gabriel end up sound asleep in the back seat, evidently not fully recovered from their night before, with Castiel sitting up front with Dean.
“Just stop walkin’ around here so gloomy - you’re gonna’ drive the customers away!”
He trails off when he sees his brother, eyes fixed on the ground, stone faced.
The rest of the meal passes uneventfully - the spaghetti isn’t anything to write home about, but Dean is happy to spend most of the time sitting back and listening to the others talk. Castiel or Anna will sometimes ask him a question or make a comment that includes him in the conversation, but he sticks to easy conversation and answers that allow him to fade into the background again. He knows he might be coming across as rude, but he can’t bring himself to care too much. At the end of the day, he tells himself, he only came for the free food, and the chance at getting out of his god awful apartment for the night.
Castiel slowly reached out and placed a hand on Dean's shoulder.
The morning after the fight against Chuck felt just like any other. The air was cold, the silence was deafening but voices could still be heard from inside the Angel's head. They could all be drowned out, all but one.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Cas grips his face with both hands. "Dean, you've never let any of us down. Your strength has made us stronger. It's because of you, that we stand with you. We are scared of letting YOU down. We couldn't save those people. Their fates were already sealed. What we can do, is we can let those three losses define us, or we can learn from them, go out fresh tomorrow and fight in their names. Fight in their memory, to take this son of a bitch down." Cas practically roared.
Dean's head dropped to one side as he looked back at Castiel.
"Did what hurt?"
Black ooze seeped through the cracks in the wall and gathered into a one way ticket to eternal sleep.
Sam and Eileen both briefly grin at the angel acknowledging his entrance before they look back down and continue to read from a computer screen placed in front of them.
Jack kind of just sighed and folded his arms, before calling over Sam and Eileen to where Castiel stood in the doorway.
Castiel shoved Dean aside, as he landed against the wall on Cas' right.
Dean sighed heavily again, walked over to Sam and hugged his brother.
Jack shows a look of concern on his face which Castiel is thankful for. The son of Satan chose HIM to be his father and to teach him and guide him and he'd never  felt so loved... that is until the eldest Winchester brother made his way towards them. Cas's heart did little flips in his chest but he calmed himself so no one could tell.
"When you fell from Heaven?"
Dean watches in terror as the tentacle-like limbs that the Empty extends, crashes into Castiel's form, spreading out over his body, and additionally lunges for Billie, pulling her away rapidly, but slowly and agonisingly coats Castiel in jet-black ooze, before too, yanking him into itself and vanishing back through the cracks in the walls, as quickly as it appeared...
