Dean jumped slightly as Castiel touched his wrist, and he released his right hand from the steering wheel, letting Castiel guide their hands together between them. With their fingers linked, Castiel gave Dean’s hand a squeeze and Dean looked over to him, meeting his eyes. “You want to know what about this is real?” He squeezed again, smiling wide. “We are.”
Dean’s lips were soft and warm, the kiss soft. It felt as if a shock went through them, like finally, everything was back where it should’ve been. Castiel wanted to laugh - it felt like he was truly home. He felt like there’d been so much missed time between them and he couldn’t get close enough. Dean’s hand tightened in his, like he was clinging to Castiel, afraid that this was just a dream.
“Over here are the bins of clothes,” Jack was saying from in the shed and Dean forced his attention back down to Earth, following after him. Jack was in a back corner, dragging a large, blue tub free from a stack, but Castiel was on the opposite side, his head cocked curiously.
As soon as Meg released Claire, her eyes snapped up and she looked Dean over from where he stood at the bottom of the steps. A slow smile spread over her lips and Dean instinctively took a step back. As Meg came down the steps to meet him, Claire slipped into the house, leaving them alone.
His breath nearly stopped as he came across a body he recognized. It wasn’t the right color, the bright red shining through the thin layer of snow, slowly melting in the sun. But it was his baby’s sister.
Castiel smiled at him and nodded, then looked back to Charlie. “We’ve felt that something was off from the moment we arrived, and if that something is going to put all of us in danger? We’ll help.”
Dean froze and Sam moved slowly, reaching up and untangling the chains from Dean’s throat. Dean looked down and saw the pant legs of the pajama pants in Sam’s hands. Then he looked around and realized he was sitting in the kitchen chair.
Castiel blinked a few times to clear the fog of sleep, and somehow, Dean was still standing there, holding out a cup of coffee like a white flag. He distantly thought he should be angry that Dean was here - Dean wasn’t Claire’s nurse, had no business coming in the room! - and grateful for the caffeine he so desperately needed. What came out instead was neither anger or gratitude.
“Th-there’s more water,” Alfie mumbled from his safety zone, unwilling to come into the room despite the threat having been eliminated. Dean turned his head to see where Alfie was looking and saw four cases of water stacked against the wall, only a few bottles missing from the top. There was also a stack of hard cheese wheels, large salamis, a sack of potatoes, rice, and oatmeal. “And food.”
Sam sighed softly, clinking the spoon against the side of the mug before slipping it into the sink. When he lifted the mug, Dean sent off a silent prayer that he was bringing it to Castiel; Sam didn’t usually drink tea, but maybe…
Dean smiled at that and texted his address before he darkened the screen, looking around the kitchen. Upstairs he could hear Ben moving around, probably pulling every game he owned out of his closet, and dumping them onto the floor. Dean chuckled and shook his head - Jack wouldn’t care how messy Ben’s room was, and Castiel would completely understand.
The sound of voices, albeit far off, were enough to tell him what the bang was. He untangled himself from the blankets, shoving them at Castiel whose arms were open and waiting, both of them sliding off their respective sides of the tractor to get their ruck-sacks.
“I tried for a while, to stop drinking so much, to be the partner to Lisa she deserved, a good dad to Ben. I started nursing school when Lisa was pregnant and got about halfway through. But I really messed up… Lisa and I were fighting more and I took Ben with me for a drive. I wasn’t… I shouldn’t have been behind the wheel, and I flipped the car.”
“No! No, I just... Jack’s sleeping over there tonight and he invited Claire and I to stay for pizza…”
“Oh!” Dean felt himself flush and he shook his head. “Uh, no, I just… saw you and…” he trailed off and licked his lower lip. “Are you okay? Is Claire?”
“I had no idea,” Castiel whispered, shaking his head. While Ruby had never been his favorite person when they were teenagers, he wouldn’t wish what happened to her on anyone. If more of them had known, maybe…
“Mrs. Tran is still working on Kevin, and Ava believes us, too. But…” Charlie trailed off and glanced over at Gilda. “Guys… seven of us aren’t going to make much of a difference here. We can try to confront Chuck but… honestly, if his game plan is what we’re thinking it is, he’s going to stop us and he’s got the man power to do so.”
By the time they had all of their things out of the car, all of them bundled into the small guard shack, the sounds of the approaching vehicles could be heard in the distance. The sun was starting to set, but the headlights were bright enough that none of them were worried about traveling up the mountain at night.
With sandwiches, chips, and lemonades distributed, Castiel dropped down onto the blanket in between the two of them to eat. Jack prattled on about the frogs he’d caught, diving into giggles again as he reenacted the frog that landed on Claire, and Claire threw a chip at him, laughing hard when it got stuck in his hair. There were chocolate chip cookies and strawberries that were quickly devoured and then Jack was back out to the edge of the pond to collect more frogs.
He felt slightly guilty he’d kept Dean and Ben so late, but it seemed like Dean hadn’t wanted to leave any more than Castiel wanted him to, either.
A second set of hands joined Castiel’s and then pillows were shoved behind him, propping him up into a sitting position. Dean’s eyes felt like they were glued shut and he barely managed to open one before there was a warm, wet cloth running over his face.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean swore, meeting Castiel’s concerned gaze over the top of the car. They were definitely going to need a ‘family meeting’ after this. “Jack, stop talking.”
The creature was silent, moving smoothly through the overgrown grass around the back of him, pouncing on his back and taking him down. For a moment, his heart skipped a beat and his mind supplied “Lisa”. Then the pain kicked in. He screamed, twisting away from the creature, its teeth and nails digging through his right shoulder as he jerked back. The scent of his blood only drove the thing mad, blood leaking in thick rivulets out of the corners of its eyes as it growled wildly and gnashed its teeth in the air. Dean kicked out, propelling himself back a foot and knocking the thing away.
Castiel was mumbling to himself, pulling ingredients off the shelves, collecting them in a large pewter bowl. There was a small table in the room for crafting and he laid the supplies there for a moment, staring down at his goods as if he were running through a mental checklist. Then, Dean followed after him as he went to his room.
Dean shook the sadness of missing Lisa away and smiled wide at the bottle, shaking his head. “Let me guess… under the pillow?”
“I mean, I knew you weren’t going to fall for Chuck’s plan, and I knew you would get everyone out safe. You would’ve found Sammy, and God… just the two of you can change the wor-”
Castiel gave a small snort, dropped his pack at Dean’s feet, and then was gone. Dean didn’t need to look to know he was heading outside. They stood in the dark hallway, waiting for Castiel to return, with Uriel glaring at Dean. The mistrust was clear on his face and it made Dean’s skin itch beneath his gaze.
The water felt good pounding down on his shoulders, but it was nothing to the hard, hot lines of Castiel pressed against him. “Shit,” Dean whispered into the side of Castiel’s neck before letting his forehead drop to rest against Castiel’s shoulder. He gave a small laugh, his tongue darting out to lick the water from Castiel’s skin. “You feel so fucking good.”
Dean sank to the floor, his knees hitting the hardwood painfully, and his very breath was squeezed from his lungs. He pitched to the side, leaning against his bed, still sleep-warm from their night.
Dean carried a steaming thermos of hot coffee up the slippery ladder and out onto the deck. The air was frigid, the sun from the morning all but disappeared now, and he looked up, wondering if it was going to snow.
happy. He turned his head, and found Castiel looking at him over Brady’s shoulder, his smile wide and happy. Dean found himself laughing in response and squeezed his brother’s stomach. He felt like he was home.
Claire smirked back, shoving a bite of her food into her mouth. Jack, ever the helper, was grabbing all of the napkins off their table and nearly hanging over the booth to help Dean clean theirs.
Dean hesitated. He wanted his baby back more than anything, but that was part of his life before. Now... now he had a real baby to get safely through the snow and an entire state to travel across.
Dean remembered the feeling he’d had as soon as Sam’s words came through his sleep addled mind. Sam had slept through Christmas Eve night the year before, and Dean had long since expected John to remember to be Santa. He looked over at the front door, seeing his Sketchers and Sam’s, but his father’s boots weren’t there.
Castiel nodded, wondering what the hell that had to do with the Klines. Ruby had been a hot mess, with a whole bunch of daddy issues. She had been a bad influence on Sam until the Winchesters had found out she was being molested by her father.
“Garth said he was going to be down in the kitchens today,” Jack said softly, Dean and Castiel flanking him on either side as they moved towards the locker room.
“Breathe, kiddo,” Dean laughed as Ben choked on his words, coughing in his excitement. “Did you guys catch the frogs?”
When he handed the lighter over to Jack, the younger man let out a shaky breath, staring down at his candle. His throat clicked as he swallowed and shook his head, looking over at Castiel. “What if I’m not ready?”
He pulled the cap off and started coloring the side of Lucas' bandage he could reach. Lucas winced once, but shook his head when Gabriel asked if he should stop. When he was finished, he handed the marker for Castiel to do the other side. Castiel did his very best coloring, making sure there weren't any huge white spots left and that he didn't slip and poke Lucas in the eyeball or his mouth. When he recapped the marker, he and Gabriel both leaned back to survey their coloring job.
Dean glanced at him, blowing out a slow and steady breath. He hadn’t talked about Lisa in so long… As he struggled to find the words, he was surprised to hear Castiel answer first.
“Oh, Ben will love that,” Dean agreed and together they started walking towards the main barn. The scent of cinnamon and fried apples filled the air and Dean’s stomach gave a happy growl. Oh, he was going to eat the fuck out of those donuts.
“Nope,” Lucas answered, “Mommy and Daddy didn’t like to talk about him. I remember seeing a picture of him once and I asked Mommy who he was. She said they had a ‘falling out’ and we didn’t see him anymore.”
“Do you think I could talk to my mom, too?” Jack asked in a whisper and Dean smiled, nodding his head.
to air out their dirty laundry, spread himself thin and yell himself hoarse as he took Dean apart piece by piece, much like he’d wanted to do back then. But what would that accomplish? It was clear Dean had moved on, at least in some way, and Castiel very astutely did not need Dean Winchester in his life, not one bit.
The store in the barn was completely packed and Castiel called for the boys to wait for them, their group stopping a few feet from the entrance. “I’ll go and get the donuts if you want to pay for the tractor?” Dean offered. The kiosk for the pick-your-own experiences was much less crowded than the store; it would be far easier to wait with the boys in that line.
“Call me if you need me, okay?” Sam said as they walked to the door. With Dean promising that ‘yes, he would’ and ‘no, he’s fine,
Dean couldn’t really argue with that. And yet - “Alright, so let's skip to it then. Why are you so curious about me and Cas? Are you worried about something?”
Dean was visibly shaking, and he reached for the coffee and dragged it towards himself, cursing as he slopped a large splash over the edge and onto his hand. The waiter asked him what he wanted and Dean looked miserable, muttering quickly, “Just… the slammer special thing is fine.”
Castiel gave a small laugh and nodded. “I did. I had her start babysitting Jack for me, then she just… became part of our family. When her mom died, I didn’t even have to think about it. She belonged with us and the idea of her going into the system or ending up with someone else? It just… wasn’t in the cards. She was ours.”
Mouth full of pastry, Claire seemed revitalized, and she took a spot beside Gabriel and looked up at the house. “Have you seen it?” she asked him. “Is it as good as the pictures, or are we walking into a trash pit?”
“This isn’t happening,” Dean replied, reaching up to rub the sleep from his eyes. When he opened them again, Benny was staring back at him, looking slightly more amused. The pounding behind Dean’s eyes only increased it’s pressure.
Dean learned quickly how to take one down. You needed to aim for the heart or the brain, although he supposed severing a head would do the job too. Just like Lisa, the eyes of every Lifeless they came across were bleeding. Black patches and streaks of dried blood showed on their clothing, and their bodies were all in various stages of disarray and decomposition. He wondered idly if complete decomposition would stop them.
He swallowed hard as he watched the water start to roll down Castiel’s tanned, muscular shoulders. Castiel turned, cocking his head to the side to avoid the spray in his face. He rumbled in appreciation of the view before him.
Every day that passed and he was in the presence of the other man, every single feeling Dean had ever had for him came flooding back. He’d always known he loved Castiel still, he just hadn’t known he was still in love with him.
He knew he should’ve been dying in the heat. He could see it rising from the black tar, the horizon before him blurred by it. But he was freezing, the sweat against his back and neck cold, his body shaking.
Castiel thought that was kind of a silly thing to say, but he didn’t reply. Instead, her let her help him to the edge of the bed, careful of his leg, and left the room to get new clothes and washing supplies.
“Dean Winchester did the driveway this morning for Dad,” she said and took a sip, her eyes never leaving Castiel’s face.
"Did you know about the King's Quarrel in Casern?" Dean asked and when Castiel shook his head, he sighed softly. "Not... very many know about it. It was kept very quiet, surprisingly so. I think outside of Lawrence, people believe it to be a hoax or a legend."
Dean considered ignoring him, and if the sheepish expression on his brother’s face told him anything, it was that Sam half expected him to. But Dean could never stay quiet on all things Castiel. “It was him, Sam. It a hundred-fucking-percent was him. He was- he is -” Dean stopped and shook his head. “It was Cas.”
“Did you forget what Lucas looked like?” Gabriel asked back, and Castiel nodded his head quickly. “Then no, Cassie. Lucas will recognize us. I bet he’ll be even more excited to see us since he’s been alone this whole time. We’ve at least had each other.”
“Kids like to draw me pictures,” he said and flushed slightly. “Um, hold on.” He pushed open the door and Castiel stepped into the doorway, looking around the room.
The first time Castiel thought he’d seen him, he’d convinced himself it was just being back here, back in Lawrence - the scent of the grocery store was as familiar as the town roads he’d driven down, easy enough to conjure up forgotten memories. The second time, it was a trick of the light, the black car zipping past was just that - a normal, old black car. Plenty of people had classic cars around here, and black wasn’t that odd of a color. It wasn’t like the Winchester’s Impala was painted neon like his brother’s car, so really… just a random car. But the third time…
Light flooded the driveway and the front yard as Naomi flipped the outside lights on and Castiel found himself smiling despite himself. “Do you think we should hold out and see if she sends Michael out?”
“We can’t carry it all,” Dean explained with a shrug, “and you have many more mouths to feed than we do. We figure,” Dean paused and glanced at Castiel, the other man nodding that he was okay to be included, “if we pay it forward now, it will come back around to us when we need it most.”
want to stay with Castiel and Meg, he filed to be an emergency foster parent. Having their social worker, Missouri, as a close friend - a warm, soulful woman he’d met through the school system - didn’t hurt either. He was granted temporary guardianship, and things progressed. It took a few weeks of working out the kinks, Claire struggling through the loss of her mother and fitting in with Castiel, Jack, and Meg, before Claire broke.
They passed a stable, the inside lit up and Dean could see horses and cows in the stalls. There were multiple pens with smaller barns, a chicken coop, and green houses - some of which Dean could tell had been there before, and some Sam and his group had obviously built.
Dean flinched as if Castiel had slapped him and he glanced to the side, his eyes wide and beautiful as he met Castiel’s gaze. Then he cleared his throat and looked away, the flush moving back over his cheeks.
The broadcasts, too, thinned out. Only coming once a day, the remainder of the time was left on eerie static except for when the city itself came over to announce the delivery schedule for care packages. It was the only time they were allowed out of their homes, to meet the armed military truck to get food and toiletries. Each person had to come out of the house in order to be counted, everyone made to stand in a line, six-feet apart so the gunman could see each and every person easily.
Dean ignored Eileen sighing frantically behind them to Sam and paused in setting the table to watch Castiel. The angel was smiling softly, humming the same Christmas carol he had been the night before. He watched Castiel, missing Eileen accusing Sam of meddling, his brother simply shrugging and smiling with a simple, “It was Rowena’s spell” signed back to her. God, he couldn’t wait another minute...
“Awesome,” Dean replied, looking up at Castiel again. “What?” he asked, giving another small laugh. “What’s with the look on your face?”
being friendly towards Dean. Jo fully believed Castiel was coming around and Dean hated how that made him feel hope.
A squeeze to his hand made him look up and he met Balthazar's kind eyes; it was hard to be angry with him when he looked both sad and sincere. "Together, we can do what is best for our kingdoms. I want you as my partner, Castiel. I want you to lead with me, to be my friend. Please, forgive me for deceiving you."
"So... if you chose not to take the throne when Balthazar offered, am I correct in assuming you don't want to live in the castle?"
Without speaking, eyes locked, Dean freed himself from his clothing in record time before finding Castiel's outstretched hand and taking it in his own. He climbed up onto the mattress, stretching himself over Castiel's body and pressing them together.
Castiel breathed out a sigh of relief, feeling at ease that Jo was completely committed to taking care of Claire. He grabbed his coat and prepared to stand when Claire turned worried eyes to him.
The room was too small for everyone, so Benny took his leave, going to the galley to prepare easy to eat food for all of them. If Gilda’s labor was long, they’d need quick, easy things to eat. And if it wasn’t? They’d all want to be loving on their newest addition anyway. Dean hesitated around the door frame for a little while, but both he and Charlie only continued getting in the way. It wasn’t until Gilda snapped at them both that Dean grabbed Charlie’s arm and pulled them across the hallway to his room, close enough for Cas to just call their names and be there in a second if they were needed.
“Ten AM tractor ride! All aboard!” A man stood on the side of the tractor, towering over them as he yelled out over the crowd. He had a large sun hat on and suspenders, and Jack quickly chimed in that he looked like a ‘scarecrow’. Dean gave him a wink and was the first one on the tractor, the kids following with Castiel taking up the rear.
“Mr. Novak!” Jack exclaimed happily as he saw his teacher moving quickly over the snow. Castiel nodded at him but moved forward to Mr. Kline. He hadn’t fully decided what he was going to say, but he was
Gilda gave up her seat, nodding to Cas to take the end of the bench with Dean, and then went to their food supplies with Benny hot on her tail. They got together some jerky and cans of fruit, Benny popping them open with his combat knife while Gilda found them all silverware. Castiel waited until Charlie nodded at him before he took his spot beside Dean, sliding closer to him on the bench and hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder to look down at Samwise.
“So the storage room is pretty big, and it has a side room that’s always been locked. Billie said no one has ever found the key.” Jack shook his head quickly. “Garth had the key, Dean. I hid behind the rack of pans and I heard them talking about the ‘feast’. Chuck is calling it the ‘Feast of Grace’ and they’ve been saving up food or something. Dean…”
“I told them to go play for a bit,” Meg said with a shrug. “We can all digest a bit before dessert.”
Castiel shook his head, turning away from Sam and looking towards the bed. “No, Sam. I loved you and your brother. I fell for you and I don’t regret it.” He turned again, giving Sam a soft smile and Dean ached to reach out. “God has abandoned us, it seems hopeless… I understand where your brother is coming from. But my faith?” Castiel’s voice lowered even further and he stepped towards Sam, pressing a hand to the center of his chest. “My faith is forever more with the Winchesters. I believe in you and Dean more than I have ever believed in anything else. I don’t expect or need that in return.”
Dean ruefully agreed, looking around the parking lot. It appeared quiet, but they were definitely out in the open. “Where do you suggest?”
Dean rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, leaning against the counter and watching as Gabriel pulled a lollipop out of his pocket and handed it over to Ben. Then, Gabriel looked up and met Dean’s gaze.
“I know how big they are, Cas,” Dean snorted, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. “But I’m saying if we just did a straight shot to New York, we could go through the water. Hell, we might even be safer going that route. There are bound to be boats or jet skis or something.”
Dean found himself slowly shaken awake by Castiel, both him and Samwise fast asleep in the recliner. He set Samwise in the crib, the baby only giving a small whine before settling again. They ate in a comfortable silence, sitting between the couch, loveseat, and recliner. By the time they were finished, Gilda moved closer to the fire and picked up Samwise to feed him. Castiel stood, taking his own blanket to place over her shoulders so she wouldn’t get too chilled.
Dean held his breath as he turned, waiting for the pain in his shoulder to rear its head and felt… nothing. He was sore, but it wasn’t the overwhelming pain he’d been used to over the last two days. He moved his head and saw his backpack was beside him, his knife on the ground beside it. His blanket wasn’t attached and he looked down to see it covering him, and a sleeping bag he’d never seen before rolled out beneath him.
Castiel opened his mouth to say “of course” but stopped. Instead, he waited for a stop light to turn and look at her, Claire patiently waiting for his answer. She had braided her hair along the side of her head, the rest hanging in loose curls over her opposite shoulder. He saw she was even wearing more makeup than normal.
“Nothing like this in a while,” Dean answered, stabbing a steak tip and tearing it off with his teeth.
Dean nodded, satisfied with the answer. He lifted the mug to his lips once more. The warmth from the broth did wonders to help wake him up and he found he was able to hold his head up on his own without depending on the stack of pillows for support.
“Like you said,” Dean interrupted, pushing off the couch and reaching down to grab the pizza box, ignoring Sam’s protest that he wasn’t done, “I broke his heart. The Klines owe me absolutely nothing. If Castiel is here visiting his brother? Good for him. I hope he and his husband and their kids have a fantastic time. It’s not any of my business.”
“Dad,” Ben said, exasperated, and flopped back on the bed. “It’s fine! They’re all fine! Mr. Cas isn’t gonna care about your shirt. Can we go now?”
“Do you know what this is, Dean?” Chuck asked, accepting the bottle from Garth and placing it on the desk in front of him. His fingers trailed down the side of the plastic, but his eyes were trained on Dean’s face.
Castiel clicked his tongue, ignoring the sigh coming from his brother beside him. Lucas had already told him to stop three times, but he couldn’t help it. He was scared; not scared like he was when he woke up in the hospital the first time and couldn’t find Mommy, and not scared when they took him away from Lucas and Gabriel in the firetruck, but… a different kind.
“I’m Garth,” the first man broke the silence between them, taking a few steps forward. “You’re welcome to come and see our camp for yourselves, and you’re welcome to join us for just the night or however long you’re needing shelter for.”
Balthazar smiled and leaned back, mirroring Castiel's position. "Whatever you need, however I can make you comfortable, all you have to do is give the say so. As for us, we will keep up appearances for the public, and I would like for us to be friends in private. Both of our countries will be looking for us to produce an heir, and I've calculated we have a year to use the excuse that we're simply getting to know one another."
Castiel didn’t wait for a response, only steered Jack towards the counter so he could pay. Jack had already moved on, driven by Ben’s story about frogs, to begging to head down to the pond so he could look for tadpoles. As he stood before the register, waiting for the host to come back over, he heard Ben’s voice ring out, too loud for the small restaurant.
Dean groaned as his knot caught, locking them together. He ground down, reaching between them to wrap his fingers around Castiel's neglected cock, giving just the right amount of pressure to make him see stars.
Dean rolled his hips slowly, lips finding Castiel's once more as he set a steady pace. Castiel's entire body sang out as Dean's body filled his. Never before had he felt more complete and he gasped as he felt Dean's knot catch against his rim, sending a shiver up his spine.
“She’s beautiful.” Castiel patted the side of her neck affectionately before turning to Dean. “It’s been a long time since I’ve ridden.”
Dean could hear Castiel’s, “Jack, that’s rude, sit down please.” but Jack continued on as if his dad had said nothing, “Hey! You’re the guy who helped me not drop the buns!”
Beside his mate, Castiel knew that no matter what life had to throw at them, they would always have this: a place to be themselves, together, for the rest of their lives. He could weather any storm as long as he had his Alpha by his side.
she started harassing Castiel… He sent up a silent prayer that Claire was okay and made a mental note to not interfere more than he already had. Getting Jo on the case was more than enough. Plus, he knew that if he harassed her enough, she would spill the details, despite the HIPAA violation.
“Wait,” Castiel stopped short, accidentally jerking Anna to a stop with him, “Dean is in the castle?”
“Leave her alone,” Castiel bumped their shoulders, turning around to stand side by side with Gabriel. “I’m sure she’s worried about how she’s going to fit in. She’s only met you once.”
“I’m taking the couch,” he slurred, wincing as his neck cricked. “You can have Sammy’s room, if you want.”
“No,” the man answered, walking a few steps backwards before turning and bending down again. He came back with his own bowl and sat a few feet away from Dean. “I’m not the best cook, but it's edible.”
“Awesome!” Ben gave a fist pump, nearly skipping up to the counter. Gabriel finished with his current customer, then immediately turned his attention to Ben pressed up against the glass.
Jack turned his head, the look on his face showing his hurt, and if Dean hadn’t been so worried that they were going to get shot and looted, he would’ve felt bad. Castiel however kept his eyes trained on the visitors before them.
“Yeah,” Dean laughed bitterly and closed his eyes, “he knew the entire time. I guess he saw us together once or something… but yeah, he didn’t care. I fell apart and I told him why we had fought and I swear to God, Cas, I made him
Dean smiled and nodded once. “Time got away from us, it seems. I apologize if we woke you! I should head out now, but thank you for the conversation and the coffee, Cas.”
They finished their coffee, listening to the sounds of Michael and Gabriel arguing over the correct way to cook scrambled eggs - though Gabriel kept demanding Michael use a ‘wooden dildo’ instead of a spoon, causing Michael to quickly and loudly lose his patience. As Anna and Castiel made their way through the kitchen to the twin’s bedroom, Gabriel was leaning over the counter island practically
As the sun started to set, Dean was fighting back the tears in his eyes. He was standing still in the center of the road, swaying on his feet, unable to move another inch. He had no idea where he was now, although it was likely he was somewhere in South Dakota if the “Great Faces, Great Places” sign was to be believed.
“Um, hello,” he started, smoothing his hands down the front of his jeans, “I’m looking for Ms. MacLeod?”
Gabriel forced him to shower, forced him to eat, forced him to dump all of the alcohol down the drain. He practically moved in for a month, helping Dean detox and then convinced him to go back to rehab, using a better program. When Dean asked him why, Gabriel always shrugged and answered, “It’s the right thing to do.” and ignored him if he pushed.
Dean hadn’t realized he’d spoken aloud until Sam snorted and shifted back, the stool creaking beneath him. “He’s not with Bart Harrington, Dean. Bart’s been married for a while now, he and his husband own the ice cream shop down on Main. You
“Well, I… I want to take Claire and Jack to the farm to pick their own pumpkins on Saturday. Maybe you and Ben want to come with us? And… you know, you’re more than welcome to come on Sunday, too, if you wanted.”
Jo gave a tight smile and walked into the room. “I’m Jo, I’m going to be your nurse today. Would you like your dad to step out of the room while I ask you some questions?” She glanced over at Castiel and gave him a small smile, then her entire focus was on Claire.
Dean swallowed hard, knowing he was missing something but afraid to ask. Instead, he lifted the mug and drank the rest of his broth, before falling back with a contented sigh. His eyes were growing heavy and everything felt warm. Beside him, Castiel took the mug and smoothed the blanket over him.
As she shoved him through the door and handed him the clothes she said, “There’s more sexualities than just ‘gay’ and ‘straight’, Castiel.”
Dean swallowed hard, his hand stilling in Castiel's hair. Castiel forced himself not to hold his breath. No matter what Dean answered, no matter what they had to do, he wasn't going to let this go.
Kelly let her eyes trail over all of them before she nodded, giving a tight smile. She allowed Jack to help her stand and Dean waited until they left the room before he turned to Cas. “What-” he paused, unsure what he wanted to ask first. With a small laugh he decided Cas could decide which order to answer. “What’s wrong with Kelly? Where are we? What happened? Are you okay?”
With the promise of coffee, Dean and Castiel untangled themselves and folded their sleeping gear. They took turns relieving themselves and brushing their teeth, bundling up in the layers of clothing they had, before heading outside into the cool morning.
They fixed their coffees in silence, Lisa taking the chair across from him and watching him carefully. Then she gave a small laugh.
Ben was tapering off on the next song and Dean reached over, ruffling his hair with a chuckle. Ben groaned and batted him away, then perked up as Dean pulled into a Denny’s. As he parked, Ben was already throwing his seat belt off and poised to throw open the door, only Dean’s warning keeping him from launching himself out before the car was stopped and off.
“Pretty soon after the outbreak,” Jody answered. “Takes a lot of manpower to keep the city up and running.”
It didn’t matter; Dean Winchester didn’t matter. Though he wasn’t excited about working in close quarters with the man, he could and would do so professionally. There was no reason for things to be awkward, which is why the sudden pang at being left alone in the classroom was surprising.
“We ate the same food, we slept in the same area, we fought the same Lifeless,” Dean whispered, his thumb running over the printed label of the bottle. “But we didn’t drink the same water.”
At the bar, an older Omega woman was calling out orders to a young Alpha girl. The younger of the two was quickly pulling out glasses and mixing up drinks, sliding them all over the bar in different directions. As soon as Dean scored a seat, however, the older woman turned and greeted him with a wide smile.
“What happened?” Dean asked, moving over to attend to the bloody nose. It didn’t look broken, but it would definitely bruise. Both boys stayed quiet and Dean raised a brow to look at Rowena.
“Thank you, Chuck!” the encampment called back, their voices loud enough to echo and send a chill down Dean’s spine.
Their newfound friendship hadn’t gone past the school yard, however. They saw each other Monday through Friday, and it simply became part of the schedule. Then, Ben asked if Jack could spend the night on Friday and Dean was hit with an entirely
“The people are going to be furious, Castiel,” Balthazar whispered, shaking his head. “They will lose their faith in my reign, knowing I lied about our marriage and my relationship with Anna. They’ll question what else I will change, if I’m only changing laws to better myself instead of our kingdom. They’ll question our agreement with your father’s kingdom and what our sham of a marriage would mean…”
Dean watched as the other man left the bathroom, effectively leaving them alone, just as Castiel said, “I wonder if we should be concerned about athlete’s foot. I was taught never to stand on the public show-”
The desk was moved in front of the large window, most of the decorations on top of it remaining in place, just moved aside for a large family picture of all of the Novak children.
Chuck leaned over Dean and removed a bible from the bookcase covering the wall behind them, letting the heavy book fall into Dean’s lap. Then he pulled a lever, the bookcase making a ‘popping’ sound before Garth grabbed the edge and pulled it forward.
Dean couldn’t hold back the smile and shook his head as he moved forward. From the few houses they could see, the town was dark, but that didn’t necessarily mean it was empty.
Simple words, but the implication behind them was what forced Dean back onto his feet and out of the stone tomb.
“The only thing I want in my vision is you on the floor, bloodied and beaten, after I kick your goddamn ass!”
Dean swallowed hard and nodded, allowing Castiel to pull him back off the tracks where the rest of the group was waiting. Charlie had Samwise strapped to her chest, a blanket covering him from the cold air and tied around the back of her neck. Beside her, Gilda was watching them, patient as ever.
Together, Claire and Dean walked into the store, heading straight for the donut counter. The line wasn’t as long as Dean feared it was, and they fell into the back, standing side by side.
Dean climbed on the back of Sam’s snowmobile, muttering “This is the only time I’ll let you drive my ass anywhere,”  causing his brother to bust out laughing before he flipped the ignition. The rest of the group climbed onto a snowmobile, and then they were off.
He looked in the mirror again at their son, Jack, sleeping soundlessly. Kelly had brought him to a place where he was okay, but it was Jack that had healed him completely. Somehow, becoming a father took the sting away from what he’d lost at the start of his adulthood and made it all seem to fade away. When Kelly was gone, Jack became his focus. His goal was making sure that his son knew how loved he was.
“We’re almost there,” Castiel was telling Charlie, he was on his knees beside the bed, Charlie crouched in the small space between the bunks, her forehead pressed against Gilda’s. “Just keep pushing, Gilda, you’re doing so good.”
Castiel nodded and turned to the side, speaking softly in Enochian over the spell. It flared a bright pink before returning to the bright blue and gold of before. Dean watched, helpless, as Castiel left the room, Sam trailing silently behind him. They walked to room 11 and Dean closed his eyes as they slipped inside.
Gabriel had been strangely quiet about the people in town, focusing mostly on what was new with his bakery, how Mom and Dad were fairing, and the new shops that were popping up around town in place of their childhood favorites. He’d helped Castiel tour houses for sale, and if he didn’t Facetime with his brother ever again, it would still be too soon.
The food pantry was a bust, and they were quickly chased out of the building by the group of people who had settled there. The man who ran after them with his shotgun was
Castiel didn’t push much to figure out what Naomi’s “come to Jesus” moment was - and he was still hesitant to ask her. He was just content with taking it for what it was. She had sent him pansexual pins and stickers she’d collected (Gabriel apparently correcting her on Castiel not actually being bisexual) and continued to do so every year.
Jack’s chipper, “Good morning!” made him lift his fingers in greeting and he heard Castiel’s deep, sleepy response. Dean laid there for another moment until an eerie calm came over the room, causing him to squint through the sudden brightness and turn to see what had everyone so silent.
Despite his good relationship with all of his siblings now, their silence when he needed them most still haunts him.
“Claire Sydney! Come here right now!” Castiel yelled from the back door and both Dean and Claire jumped, turning in sync to see Castiel standing at the back door.
As he got into the car after Ben and started heading towards the farm, he wondered if Castiel remembered. Was that why he asked Dean to join them? Or was it just because Cider Hill Family Orchard had the largest selection of apples on top of pumpkins? Or maybe he was putting out feelers, and what he was
Anna blew out a slow breath and looked up at him. “Mom bought a queen bed for in here,” she said softly and Castiel nodded.
Though he wasn’t her teacher past her sixth-grade year, she still found her way to his classroom after school had ended and she came around to hang out with Jack, even when babysitting wasn’t required. Meg didn’t question it, only fashioned Claire her own key and told her she’d stop buying her peppermint Klondike bars if she found another empty box left in the freezer.
Castiel smiled and snuggled in closer. They lay together in silence, Dean's breathing finally evening out as he drifted to sleep.
It was Dean that she asked to teach her how to drive. And after checking and double checking that Castiel didn’t mind, he was excited to do so. He’d taken her to Bobby’s first, teaching her how to change the tires, the oil, and air filters. How to check for tire pressure and troubleshooting any issues under the hood. She was in love with the Impala and it was for that reason he decided to teach her in it.
“Daddy misses you, I think. Sometimes he looks at your picture and then gets sad for a bit and gives me big hugs. He asks Uncle Gabriel a lot what he thinks you would do. My new school is so big and I like my teacher, Mrs. Kimball, and she smells like Christmas.” Jack fell silent for a moment and Dean wondered if he was done. Then, he heard another sniffle and Jack continued.
Balthazar chuckled and passed Castiel a goblet of wine. “She’s a romantic, that one,” he replied, taking a sip of his own glass. “We’re both happy for you, you know.”
Five days had passed since the fire and they’d covered nearly two hundred miles lost in a strange state of emotions. Dean wasn’t sure what he was feeling one moment to the next; he switched from white hot anger, to despair, to being completely content before he could even comprehend what he was truly thinking. He was giving himself whiplash, and he would’ve been concerned for the range of emotions he was projecting onto Castiel if the other man hadn’t appeared to be doing the exact same thing.
Balthazar closed his eyes, reaching up to cover Anna’s hand with his own. She smiled, tears swimming in her eyes as she continued. “I want to grow old with you, Alpha. I don’t want to spend our lives apart. I want our children to be free to run around the castle, to grow up happy and healthy with the people of Lawrence encouraging them to be great leaders, like you are. I love you, Balthazar, and I will support you and be at your side no matter what choice you make. But, I would prefer to be at your side instead of being in the shadows.”
“Oh honey, like I said… it's a possibility. Right now, it's the most guaranteed path you’re on.” She shook her head, sitting down beside him and straightening out her shirt. “Each one of your father’s chains are mistakes he made, regrets. Pulling you both from town to town, missing elementary school concerts, high school dances. Telling you to buck up when you were hurt instead of cry, telling Sam he would be disappointed if he went to college. Your father, well, his life revolved around a single thing and he missed out on
“I think it makes the most sense to bring both vehicles,” Castiel finally answered, stopping all side conversations. “None of us want to go through things and choose what we could leave behind. Everything we carry with us now has a purpose, and I know I would like to  keep all of my things. That being said, all of our packs won’t fit between our feet in the car, not with a driver and a baby, too.”
He swallowed back an argument, reminding himself that if they were going to survive the rest of this move, now more than ever he needed to pick his battles. Instead, he sighed and looked in the rearview mirror, smiling at Jack slumped over in the backseat, a nest of pillows and blankets surrounding his booster seat.
Dean chuckled and looked to the side, his son sitting ramrod straight and his arms waving wildly as he explained each day of camp in detail. Though Dean had gotten letters every day, he loved every moment of listening to Ben’s stories, his son’s brown eyes blown wide with excitement.
“I know,” Cas answered quickly, reaching for Dean’s arms and pulling him over onto his back, “but I didn’t.”
He stayed in front of the open fridge for longer than necessary, searching for something he knew wasn’t there. Then, finally, he reached in and grabbed the first thing, kicking the door shut with his foot and turning toward Sam again with a carton of milk.
“Hello, Ben,” Castiel said from the front door and Dean found himself smiling as he walked into the front hall to greet them. Jack and Ben were gone almost immediately, leaving Castiel holding a stuffed backpack and a pillow. “Wasn’t sure what you had,” he said with a shrug as Dean reached for them.
Castiel stayed at the door for a moment, watching her, and felt Kali and Gabriel slip off to the other side of the house. He stepped into the room and moved towards the nook, reaching down to squeeze Claire’s shoulder. “Well, what do you think?”
“Shit,” he whispered out loud and pulled his shirt from his head. He tossed it over towards the hamper and then settled back against the pillows, his fingers tapping nervously against his stomach. He needed… he wasn’t quite sure. But he knew someone who would know what he needed. He reached for his phone and flicked into his recent contacts.
One second the teeth were clacking in his face, and the next Dean was gagging, a spray of putrid blood raining down on his face as the Lifeless’ head was sliced in half.
“Ben is a very charming young man. I’m glad he and Jack became friends, he’s been a positive influence for Jack. You’ve done a great job raising him.”
"The fireflies were always there, too," Dean said with a smile, lifting a hand to point to the side. Castiel turned his head and realized they were surrounded by the lime-green glow of hundreds of fireflies, blinking their lights as they weaved through the grass undisturbed by the humans laying there. He hadn't noticed them before, too focused on Dean. He closed his eyes and could hear their soft buzzing. "They were my favorite part."
“I think he would’ve liked it,” Anna said after a moment, looking around the room. “Plus, he could’ve actually had Amelia sleep in here with him. You would’ve been designated to the couch.”
“We should probably put in a complaint to maintenance,” Castiel deadpanned, looking up to meet Dean’s eyes. The tension snapped and Dean let out a loud laugh, tears pricking at the corner of his eyes.
“You need to eat, Castiel,” he said softly, leaning down so they wouldn’t be overheard. “I highly doubt passing out from hunger would be romantic.”
Jo eyed him for a moment before grinning and waving him over. They moved to the side of the bar, where Jo opened a gate and pulled Castiel back behind the counter. “Mom! I’ll be right back!” she called to Ellen who gave Castiel’s arm a quick squeeze on their way by.
Dean watched as his own eyes lit up, his little hands shaking with excitement as he gripped his mother’s hands. “Mama! It’s
As they walked through the forest, Dean reached out, finding Castiel’s hand easily. He pulled them to a stop, smiling at him. “We’re almost there, Cas. We’re in New York.”
to get to his brother… the fact that they were here, in New York, was also terrifying. What if… what if Sammy wasn’t here? What if he’d gotten into trouble along the road? The fact that Sioux Falls was two months ago blew his mind, and who knew how long it had been since Sam had written
There was tuna fish with saltine crackers, some apples, and some type of cookie Benny had made a few days before. Dean sat beside Castiel and used his knife to cut the apples into slices, both of them eating in silence. When Castiel was finished, he reached for Dean, pulling them both down onto the bed.
“Dean!” Hands were at his shoulders, moving to his throat, and Dean flailed harder, trying to free himself of them. “Dean,
“A piss-poor attitude and lack of vision?” Chuck interrupted, giving a shrug. “You have been hell bent on one thing and one thing alone - taking apart the camp I have worked so hard to build. This is a new empire, Dean. A new world. The End is truly the beginning and we have the opportunity here to be reborn and live a new life.”
“You both are like that,” Eileen said after a moment, drawing Sam’s attention back to her. “You both take on so much, believe everything is up to you. Even though you’re in here with us, part of you is moments away from sitting in there with Dean.”
Dean was still working with the elementary school, loving every minute of his job. He filled in parts of Castiel’s life that he hadn’t even known were missing, the kids, the husband, the white-picket fence. Claire and Ben had even successfully convinced Dean to allow them to get a dog.
The back of the building was dark, each doorway making Dean’s heart seem to skip a beat. He wondered what each of them held, what they were being used for, but Charlie barely paused at each one to listen before she scurried past them. When they reached the back doors, a large EXIT sign was illuminated, casting an eerie red glow over all of them.
“I’ve told you a hundred times, Dean-o. You don’t have to be sorry. I appreciate the apology, I do. But dude, I’m your friend. I got your back. I was worried about you, okay? I don’t-” Gabriel sighed and shook his head, popping his gum once more. “Look, whatever happened with you and Cas happened, but you were just like my pain in the ass little brother, too. I wasn’t there for Cas, I was there for
"Dean! Bobby told me you'd be coming tonight with Sam. Jess couldn't make it?" the Omega woman asked, leaning against the bar to pull Dean into a one armed hug, then did the same for Sam.
“Your gut instinct has yet to be wrong,” Castiel replied, letting out a deep sigh as he relaxed into Dean. “I’m thinking that we should stay a day or two, though.”
“I honestly don’t  have an answer,” Castiel said with a sigh, pulling away and sitting up to reach for his bag. “We ate the same things, we slept in the same area, we fought the same Lifeless.” He unzipped his bag and Dean heard the crinkling of a water bottle as Castiel pulled it free from their haphazard packing earlier.
As he took his place beside Benny, the sound of Bing Crosby singing White Christmas could be heard. Dean glanced at Benny, waiting for his friend to nod his head, before stepping fully in front of the window and looking into the living room.
“Dean.” Castiel reached forward, cupping the side of Dean’s face. Dean squeezed his eyes shut in response, letting himself sink into the comfort for a moment before he pulled away.
“Okay!” Jack said as he moved backwards down the dock and then towards the short path, his mother’s candle clenched tight in his hands. When he was out of sight, Dean turned his head and found Castiel was already looking at him, a strange expression on his face.
“Is it too soon to pack?” Jack asked, already pushing up off the dock. “Mom and I organized the shed when this all started happening…”
Castiel nodded slowly and saw the large horse barn coming up in front of them. Part of him wanted to ask what Dean felt he had to hide, or what history he hated that people knew. He didn’t get a negative vibe from the Alpha, and the military training he’d overseen and been a part of back home gave him a lot of insight on reading people and their intentions. But, asking Dean would defeat the entire purpose of what he meant between the lines of his words. “Well,” he said after a moment, “I
“I’ll keep you updated, let you know if anything changes,” Castiel said with a sigh. “Give Jack a hug and a kiss from me.”
“We can sit on the deck if you want. Or we can head over to your parent’s kitchen, if it’s too cold out.” Dean paused and turned his head, looking over his front yard. “I think Kelly is a bit shaken up, so I don’t suggest a drive, but we can sit in my baby for some privacy.”
“I’ll add some resources with your discharge paperwork, okay? A few new places have popped up since you were here last.” She smiled and then turned back to Claire. “Alright, I’m going to send these down to the lab and we’re going to get you hooked up to some fluids. Your vital signs look good, but one of the aides is going to come in and check your blood sugar. We’re pretty much looking at some dehydration right now, confusion seems to be clearing,” she looked at Castiel for a confirmation, “and we just don’t want any seizures.”
He groaned as the soft head of Castiel’s cock hit the back of his throat, swallowing hard around it as Cas’ hands moved down to grip his shoulders. Dean smiled against the sharp pain-pleasure tug and worked his tongue around Cas’ length, getting the skin nice and wet.
Behind him, Jack and Benny came to stand in the hallway, the three of them acknowledging each other with a nod and a smile. And when the baby came into the world, Castiel moving quickly to get it’s nose and mouth clear, all of them found tears in their eyes when they heard the first cry.  “November fifth,” Castiel exclaimed, wiping the baby’s skin down with a towel, “and it’s a boy!”
The sound that escaped Dean had nothing to do with the swooping sensation of Missouri pulling him back through time. He turned to her with wide, blurred eyes and fell back onto the bed. “There’s no way that’s real,” he whispered, wincing as she gave a small snort.
“There are a lot of things I miss,” Castiel started again, his voice soft, barely above a whisper, but Dean hung on every word. “The obvious things - the comfort of living in a modern world. Showers, refrigerators, electricity… Hell, I even miss grocery shopping and reading calorie labels.” Dean snorted at that, unable to picture the man who got excited over Chef Boyarde and bags of pork rings counting calories.
Rowena was watching them with a calculating expression and Castiel wondered if Dean had told her about him.
“No, no, I know,” Castiel shook his head in Dean’s hands, reaching up to cover them with his own. “I wasn’t suggesting we stay here. I’m just…”
Dean seemed to be on the same page, kissing him sweetly before shifting Castiel's legs higher up onto his hips. Castiel met his Alpha's eyes as they came together as one, groaning as Dean stretched and filled him perfectly. He reached up, wiping the sweat from Dean's brow, shivering at the look in his mate's eyes.
At night, the families from the cabins would check in. They all shared resources and brought their different skills together. It was how they’d survived for so long. Dean didn’t learn all of their names - not because he didn’t find it important, but because he was too exhausted and no one seemed to mind when he smiled and addressed them with “Hey”. Castiel was much better at remembering everyone’s names, their families, and their jobs - both pre and post world’s end. Dean found himself watching Castiel more than anything else, and if people chalked that up to him being on pain medication, well, Dean was okay with that.
“Cas!” Dean breathed out, nearly tripping over his feet as he moved to close the distance between them. Castiel hesitated, but didn’t draw back, his face a well concealed mask as he stared back at Dean, waiting. “God, Cas, you’re here.”
Dean gave a small smile, nodding his head. “I just wanted to help, I didn’t expect it to become a thing.”
Castiel snorted at that, nodding his head. Honestly, one of the reasons his parents hadn’t changed this bedroom over was so that they could enforce any significant others sleeping in the guest room instead - despite Amelia and Jimmy living together, they hadn’t been married, so sharing a bed was unthinkable.
Dean could definitely push away the rest of his thoughts for that. He followed Castiel into the Master bathroom, pulling off his clothes as they went. They brushed their teeth first, and exchanged a few kisses, but the actual act of showering remained completely domestic. If anything, it made Dean ache for this to be
“Change everything?” Dean deadpanned, earning himself a poke from the end of the tongs. At least they were sharp enough to also double as a weapon…
The idea of splitting up was an uneasy one. Though things had - so far - been relatively easy on the road, the thought of something separating them permanently made Dean’s stomach clench. What if they were attacked? What if one of the cars broke down? What if there ended up being a horde of Lifeless they weren’t able to work around?
Castiel closed his eyes, shivering slightly as Dean's fingertips traced over his skin. "I don't understand," Dean whispered.
The rest of dinner went quickly, Castiel talking about some of his new students, the boys doing the bare minimum to clean up before running back upstairs. Claire got bored of them eventually and took to wandering the house, with Dean’s go-ahead that just his bedroom was off limits.
Castiel nodded, taken aback for a moment as Claire jumped forward, hugging him tight. He didn’t even care that he got a smear of lemon filling on the side of his neck. It had been
Dean looked away from Castiel and the kids, back to Gabriel. “I… he’s your brother, though,” he said slowly, confused. He had completely assumed Castiel had known about, well,
Lucas’ room looked like theirs in a way -- his bed was the same as Castiel’s, the door to the bathroom had the same whiteboard and ‘Call don’t Fall’ sign on it, there were metal and plastic things jutting out of the wall behind the bed, but everything else about it was different. The room was darker, the shades on the window pulled tight, and the walls a normal white color.
There were five liter plastic containers of water stacked against the third wall, directly across from the door, and a box of what Dean assumed was full of nonperishable items. When he pried the lid open, it contained dry rice, pasta, beans, and -
Sam leaned back, picking up his cellphone and hitting the call button. Dean rolled his eyes at Missouri who shoved him forward but took the steps to Sam’s side.
Dean smiled and rolled his eyes, turning around to put the rocket launcher back. He did, however, let his hand linger on the top of the case as he shut it. He couldn’t deny, blowing shit up would be fun.
“He doesn’t mean it,” Sam whispered, reaching up for the bag of ice and pressing it to Cas’ jaw. “Here, it will help. Unless you want to use-”
Dean stopped complaining after that, the four of them falling into silence, listening and watching their surroundings as they made their way through the woods. Charlie had found caution tape on board the boat, and they marked their way every few trees, just in case it snowed again before they were able to get back.
Dean became angry, distant. He started picking fights with Castiel over telling his parents, over why they didn’t work, couldn’t work long term. Castiel fought back just as hard, trying to convince him that what they had was real. They ended up spending more time in bed than talking, until Dean pushed him away completely.
“I wish for happiness, health, and love forever more,” Dean suddenly whispered and Castiel glanced over to see his mate had a firefly cupped in his hands. The Alpha winked at him and opened his palm, blowing the wishing bug away.
Both Dean and Sam opened their mouths to argue, but Castiel beat them to it. “That won’t be necessary, Jessica, however it is appreciated. Balthazar has given Dean and I land to build a home.” He looked at Dean, loving the way his Alpha’s eyes widened. “His plenipotentiary needs quarters of his own, and since his mate prefers open space instead of castle walls… well, he was more than happy to accommodate them.”
“Alright,” Dean nodded, meeting Cas’ eyes over the top of Jack’s head, “just keep your ears open and your eyes peeled.”
With Meg’s help, Castiel was able to enroll at NYU and graduate with his Masters in Education. The middle school he taught at was rough, but he loved every minute of it: the kids he taught needed it, the guidance, the support. More than once he found himself falling onto the couch with Meg, a bottle of wine between them, brought nearly to tears when he recounted stories of the kids he watched overcome nearly impossible odds.
Dean’s eyes must’ve shut again because he opened them once he heard shuffling towards the end of the bed. A boy was standing by Dean’s feet, probably sixteen or seventeen years old, with an oversized quilt folded in his arms. He gave Dean a genuine smile, and despite him being close to an adult in age, there was something childlike about him.
He swallowed down some Tylenol and managed to get the gauze rolled around his arm with the ace bandage securing it before water started to roll in from the outside. The ashes of the fire were swimming towards him slowly and he cursed as he pulled himself up onto his feet. He tossed his bag up onto the monument and climbed up on top of the stone casket. He shivered as the cold seeped into his bones and cursed himself for not putting on another damn shirt.
With both kids inside the sedan and buckled in, Castiel turned and looked back towards the store, as if he could sense Dean standing there.
“Ah,” Dean replied, reaching up to rub the back of his neck. “Well… the system isn’t perfect by any means.”
Jack looked uncomfortable as a girl younger than him came from behind to pick up their plates and glasses, and Dean wanted to laugh at how for the first time since they’d arrived here, he was on board with Jack’s line of thinking. When the table was cleared, a hush fell over the room and Chuck stood, his arms out wide once more.
Still, this would be the first time they would be in close quarters for longer than thirty minutes and he was nervous. He tried to look around the house from his mother’s perspective, then looked down at his own clothes and grimaced. He would have to change before they got there… He thought of the kids upstairs. What would she think of Claire? She hadn’t said much about him choosing to adopt a teenager…
Dean narrowed his eyes and turned back, seeing both Benny and Charlie were looking at him suspiciously. He cleared his throat and looked back down at his plate, finishing his meal in silence.
Vicki smiled and patted his good leg, shaking her head slowly. “Lucas is still very sick, Castiel. You and Gabriel are doing so well, that’s why you’re on the pediatric floor. I promise, we will visit Lucas as often as we can, okay?”
Castiel thought of the boys, both strong and independent in their own ways - Jack curious and inquisitive, flourishing now that he was in high school and able to pick up more science classes. Ben was smart and charming, so much like his father, and had been putting his head together with his Uncle Sammy to pick out engineering colleges for the following year.
“Well,” Uriel said from his spot on the ground, looking up and - Dean had to rub his eyes to make sure the blood in them wasn’t making him see things - actually
Dean’s entire body seized and he scrambled up into a sitting position, angling his back towards the table to face the man straight on. The man was wearing a long, tattered trench coat - the bottom of it tracked with mud. Though Dean’s own clothing had probably fared just the same. He had dark blue pants on and a plain white t-shirt to match. His face was streaked with dirt, too, but his expression was open and friendly. Dean stared right back at him. The man’s eyes were a striking blue despite the darkness of the barn.
“Generators,” Charlie said softly, glancing back. “Emergency outlets and exits are hardwired into it.”
They paused and Benny looked behind them. “Go ahead,” he said with a nod when the coast was clear. Castiel pushed open the door to a dark storeroom, and they all took a moment for their eyes to adjust to the dim flashlight in the corner.
“Not that bad,” she said with a shrug, holding out the pack to him once more. Dean gave a small laugh and shook his head, jumping slightly as Castiel slammed down a map triumphantly before them and spread it out.
. There was the heady scent of hops and good food and an underlying scent that let him know there were people there, but he was once again surprised by how comfortable it felt. Dean and Sam looked right at home as they twisted their way through the people, muttering 'excuse me' every once in a while. If Dean hadn't been holding onto his arm and dragging him through, Castiel was sure he would still be standing wide eyed at the door, asking people softly if they could let him through.
Naomi clicked her tongue a few times and then, finally, sighed. “I will see what I can do and I will push your Uncle to expedite his plans. The nurses are hopeful that Lucas will be able to be transferred to the hospital in Kansas.”
“You’d have more sympathy from him,” Missouri quipped back. Dean looked and glared at her, the older woman completely unphased. He stared back in challenge for a few seconds, then sighed and looked away. Though he noticed the smirk on her face as he did so. God, he missed her just as much as the rest of the ‘spirits’...
When Gabriel dropped him off at rehab, he was quiet, thinking, and Dean waited for whatever he was going to say.
“With the whole can? It should last at least two weeks,” Dean agreed, beaming back at him and turning around to poke through the box. They took bags of rice and dried beans, and packets of dry soup mixes before offering the rest of the supplies to Jody and her people.
“But…” Dean shook his head, relaxing once more into Castiel’s touch instead of trying to pull away. “How, Cas?”
Castiel shook his head and headed down to the patio. Dean took a seat at the end of the picnic table, watching for the kids to be ready. As Castiel cooked up some chicken legs and potatoes on the grill, Gabriel and Dean helped cut the tops off the boys’ pumpkins and made sure there were no pumpkin gut fights as they all cleaned out the first round.
Castiel gasped as he's shoved through the door to their master bedroom, taking in the sight before them. The bed is large, possibly larger than the one he had at the castle, with a deep grey canopy covering it and sunlight pours in through the oversized windows.
“When I met you, I had no idea where I was going or what I was doing. But, you…” Castiel stopped, shaking his head as a small smile played on his lips. “You are the most caring man, I’ve ever met. You are thoughtful and smart, you’re funny and you’re… In the few short months we’ve been together, you’ve changed me, Dean.
Ignoring his tone, Castiel continued, “If all of us push, we should be able to move the cases out of the way enough for us to slip through. The Lifeless are at the back of the room, and there’s more downed cases so they shouldn’t be able to get to us quickly.”
. I was afraid of my dad finding out and disowning me, I was afraid of fucking things up and having you leave me. I was afraid I would end up with nothing and I just… took action. It was the wrong one, but never, not once, did I believe I didn’t love you.”
Tears burned in the back of his eyes and he gave himself just a moment to panic. If that’s what was going to happen, there was nothing he could do about it. But if not… He looked down again and grimaced at the fresh burst of blood seeping from his wound.
“No,” Ben sounded disappointed and Dean made a mental note to maybe find a frog pond or something near them, “the counselors wouldn’t let us, they were afraid we’d kill them or something. But when we went for a campout the next night, we got to go fishing!”
Dean looked after her as she walked off to peruse the cases. Fuck, now he was nervous. It was the first time Meg was coming down to visit since they’d moved down and she was staying for the last two weeks of summer before she had to get ready for the next school year. All Castiel had been talking about was how excited he was to see Meg and how he couldn’t wait for Dean to meet her.
Eileen nodded and reached over to pat Sam’s arm, looking up as Castiel entered the living room again carrying a glass bowl of dip. Castiel placed it on the coffee table, retaking up his seat on the couch and picking up his playing cards.
He wiped his hands on his jeans as he neared the travel stop, slowing down his pace to survey the surroundings. There were cars parked haphazardly around the gas station, a layer of dust and bird shit covering them. From what he could see, the cars themselves were empty and other than a few crows hopping over the tar, there was no movement.
Dean tossed and turned, the blankets making him anxious as they wrapped around his body, reminding him of his father’s chains. At some point, probably when he’d been passed out in the fucking kitchen, Sam had come into his room and taken his stash of alcohol.
"Of all the bloody people to fall in love with," Balthazar said finally, shaking his head as he dropped his apple back to his plate. "Dean Winchester? In another life..."
Castiel wrinkled his nose. "That sounds gross," he commented and Lucas laughed a little, nodding his head.
“You’re both ridiculous,” Castiel mumbled, turning to look out the front window. The drive had taken almost three hours with Dean having to reroute them several times to get around blockages in the roadways and steer them clear of cities that looked dangerous. Smaller towns were usually bare, but the countryside was flat, making it easy for them to see groups of Lifeless in fields. Driving, however, had given them the ability to see more of how the Lifeless acted.
“Hi, yes… Lisa.” Castiel smiled back at her, looking her over. God, she was pretty… he could see why Dean was drawn to her. He couldn’t help but think of Dean’s words to him on that night. Lisa was everything he was supposed to have.
“It’s good,” Dean said back to him, giving him a smile, “but I’m not carrying your drunk ass to bed.”
“I do, in fact, have a job for you.” Chuck nodded and Dean looked up to watch Garth slip out of the room, shutting the door again behind him. The room remained silent, Dean fighting between asking what the fuck was going on and acting like he didn’t care.
“Your brother believes it's his fault. He is to blame because Cas couldn’t talk to him, because you couldn’t,” Eileen signed. “He should’ve seen the signs himself, he should’ve been there to stop it.”
By the time Dean walked back to his table, Castiel, Jack, and Claire were finished eating and Castiel had the bill in hand. Claire raised a brow at him, then shook her head before walking off towards the front, her earphones already plugged in and music blasting.
“Dean, you can’t stay up all night worrying about something that might not be,” Castiel answered, giving his arm a squeeze. “We have no idea what we’re going to find.”
“Cas, you’re family,” Sam whispered, setting the mug down on the bedside table. His eyes trailed over the spellwork on the bed, then returned to Castiel.
“Were you with him when he passed?” Jack asked and Dean bit his lower lip, holding his breath for the answer. He and Castiel had never really talked about Inias or Lisa together, only in passing.
“But what if he’s not there, Cas? What if the city had fallen too far and it wasn’t safe? What if he’s gone?”
“We love you, Chuck!” the group responded and despite having heard the mass of people call back various things to their ‘leader’, it still gave Dean a shiver. He heard a cot creaking behind him and could almost picture Castiel struggling to stay nonchalant.
Castiel smiled at him and nodded, listening to Gabriel tell them all about the new property he’d purchased to expand his candy business, despite having helped him scout out locations.
“Boys,” a gruff voice sounded, making Castiel stop short and look around. Sam continued chuckling, wiping at his eyes as he looked for the source of the voice.
Sam nodded and stood, leaning over the counter to turn the water off. “You do. Stop thinking about it, Dean, okay? Seriously, I know you. You’re going to drive yourself crazy. Isn’t Ben coming this weekend?”
“You sure as hell treat him like he’s broken, brotha,” Benny answered, blitzing forward so he was standing before Dean and gave him a pointed look. “Though, he’s got the best lesson of all.”
Castiel was just finishing up stitching Anna’s shoulder, the wound tidy and neat thanks to Castiel’s swift but gentle hands. He waved Dean over and dug through the first aid kit for what he needed to patch up Dean next. As he worked, all Dean could think of was Anna’s shoulder and how she wouldn’t have an ugly, thick scar there like he did.
Dean ignored the rise of bile in his stomach and he twisted away from Benny, facing the wall. “You’re out of your goddamn mind,” Dean whispered.
The way he and Dean had snuck beneath the bleachers at pep rallies. Castiel lounging in the first row with his books during his free period, watching Dean practice basketball with his best friend, Benny. School dances, pressed in the darkest corners, stealing a kiss or two before joining the rest of their friends at the punch bowl…
And oh, the dining hall! He'd never seen so many tables. The hall was at least twice the size of theirs back home, but full to the brim with tables and people. Balthazar and Castiel, along with the rest of the royal court, sat dead center with the rest of the castle sitting around them. Although Balthazar's role demanded respect, Castiel was amazed at the comfort in which the King and his people were at each other's sides.
“I am, Sam. I really, really am. I just…” Dean shook his head, squeezing Sam harder before pulling back. “I’m sorry I missed out on games last night. I just -”
A scream woke him that morning, high pitched and terrified, coming from the house next door. He’d leapt out of the bed, running towards the window and throwing it open, looking over just in time to see the neighbor fall. There was nothing he could do for her.
Dean let out a yelp as he was suddenly ripped backwards, his back flat against the mattress and Castiel leaning over him. Though it was dark in the room, he could just barely make out Castiel’s features, and the other man was
“He won’t cause you any harm as long as you extend the same favor to us,” Castiel said calmly, his stance behind the counter wide, ready to dive back out of the way if need be. Dean gripped the blade harder.
Dean cleared his throat, the candle shaking in his hand as he dropped the lighter between his legs. “And this is for Ben. The son I never knew I wanted. He taught me that despite the way I grew up, I was a damn good Dad. He was smart as a whip, loving, and compassionate. He had a better taste in music then his mother and he-” Dean’s voice wavered and he cleared his throat again, closing his eyes tight. “Despite his life being cut short, he lived what he had to the fullest. I miss him, every day.”
They were quiet, and while Castiel was probably thinking about Sam and their travels to Poughkeepsie, Dean was thinking of another brother.
Dean struggled against Garth’s hold, but the wiry dude was fucking strong, much stronger than Dean would’ve given him credit for. From behind, Jesse moved with a coil of rope, and in a last ditch effort, he slammed his head forward. Garth’s nose made a sickening crunch as the man fell back with a grunt.
"I'm going to talk to Balthazar," Castiel broke the silence. Against his neck, Dean hummed his question. "I'm going to tell him that I've found my mate and that I want to leave."
Claire was going down the same path as her mother and it terrified him. Even knowing that Castiel could be ruled as unfit, she was incapable of controlling herself. The path she was spiraling on made him turn to Meg and his brother, Gabriel. They both agreed and pushed him to make a change.
Dean nodded and followed after Castiel. Jack placed his name card next to Kevin, and Castiel sat down next to him with Dean taking the third spot at the corner of the table. At the head of the table, a thick, handsome man was sitting, though his attention wasn’t anywhere near the newcomers. Dean followed his gaze and saw a pretty red-head helping a heavily pregnant woman over to the table, talking quietly to her.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Dean whispered, shaking against Castiel’s body. Everything was overwhelming - the heat of the water, the pressure of Castiel’s touch, the feelings of
Michael stopped in with some sandwiches and a screwdriver, hanging up two additional shelves in the room for some pictures and trophies. Then left Anna and Castiel to finish cleaning and rearranging.
It was clear from the start how much they cared for one another, their playful banter made Castiel wish he’d grown up with siblings of his own. Sam pulled out stories of their childhood, working as hard as he could to try to embarass Dean -- like how he’d been caught by the Milton’s trying to snag a pie cooling from the windowsill, how he’d been playing tag with Sam and some of the other neighborhood kids and tripped, landing himself face first in a pig pit. Dean, for his part, gave it back as good as he got, and by the time they got to the edge of town, the three of them had tears pricking their eyes from laughing so hard.
Castiel paused in putting on his jacket, turning his head to look at Dean. There was something in his eyes, something Dean couldn’t decipher, and then he gave a sad smile and nodded. “Yeah, funnily enough, I think we are.”
“Please,” Dean breathed out against Castiel’s lips, his following groan swallowed once more by Castiel’s mouth as his fingers wrapped around Dean’s cock. The drag of his palm was just on the good side of too rough, and it was perfect. It ignited a fire in Dean’s veins.
“Since the first day you came to us, Dean, you haven’t trusted us. It seems to be… ingrained in you, really. A gut reaction, perhaps?” Chuck cocked his head but clearly didn’t expect a response, folding his arms over his chest as he continued, “You’ve been watching everyone around you, putting off your don’t-care attitude, all while manipulating what you could to gather information. Jesse told you what I asked him to, of course, but it was your boy, Jack, sneaking after them in my storeroom that truly tipped me off to your intentions.”
”Prince Castiel of Casern Mountains and Dean Winchester of Lawrence,” the priest began, running through the same Royal Marriage speech. Together, hand in hand, Dean and Castiel spoke their vows.
There was nothing they could do about the members of the camp; in a sense, Chuck got everything he wanted. He’d managed to blindly lead the entire group to suicide. Dean should’ve known the creepy little fucker wasn’t a Manson. He’d always been a Jim Jones.
Meg scoffed and Castiel sighed, his heart twisting at the thought. He hated that there was a bit of excitement that followed the thought of being with Dean once more.
“He’s good, been asking about you lately. Are you and Kaia still coming over next weekend for dinner?”
“One of the gentlemen that brought us in,” Castiel started, leaning forward to place his still full glass on the edge of Chuck’s desk. The other man seemed completely unoffended, reaching over to take it for himself. He sipped it as he looked at Castiel to continue. “Jesse, I believe, said that you were able to update your camp with what is happening? Is that through… scouting?”
“Cas?” Dean called, pushing open the swinging doors to an oversized kitchen. Castiel was pulling open drawers with Alfie, but paused and looked over. “Anna looks like she’s in a lot of pain.”
Dean allowed himself to be manhandled, Castiel pressing up against the length of his back and holding him close. Dean found himself smiling, holding onto Castiel’s hand over his chest and relaxing back into the warmth.
Castiel hated that his heart ached at that fact. Everyone deserved happiness, and he for one knew how happy Jack and Claire made him. Dean should have that, too. But somehow, in some way, Castiel had convinced himself that the second he was shoved out of Dean’s life, Dean had regretted it and was doomed to live every single moment until Castiel’s heart had healed, miserable and alone.
be home. He had a few years of using Jack being too young to travel with, but he knew he would have to return eventually.
When Charlie released him, he surveyed the coffee table and realized that hours had passed. There were three empty bowls of dip and chips, double the amount of empty beers and soda cans, and Eileen was curled up on her oversized armchair, fast asleep.
Castiel Shurley was buckled safely between his older brothers, Lucas and Gabriel, with a brand new Mickey Mouse stuffed animal sitting on his lap. Gabriel was
“Cas,” Dean said, reaching over to grab his arm. Castiel nearly jumped a foot in the air, spinning towards Dean with wide eyes, his hand going to his katana. “No, it's okay!” Dean said quickly, releasing his arm and holding up his own hands. “No danger, promise.”
Anna quietly closed the bedroom door behind them and Castiel let out a slow breath. His bag was open, clothes from yesterday spilling out over the floor by his bed, the covers pulled back where he’d tried to sleep the night before. But everything else…
Sam burst out laughing, hugging him tightly once more before he untangled them and reached for the side of the SUV to pull himself up, holding out a hand to help his brother up after him. They turned together, suddenly remembering the rest of the group, and Sam laughed again, waving his hand.
Despite the anxious energy about him, Castiel found himself smiling. He closed his eyes and leaned into the phone, letting Meg’s voice - however crass - fill him with a sense of familiarity. “Hello, Meg.”
“Uh, yeah, little brother.” Dean looked over and up, and then chuckled. “Well, in age anyways. Castiel, this is Sammy. Sam, this is Cas.”
In Lawrence, Castiel would have new things to see, places to explore. He knew from his studies that Balthazar was from a large family, so there were other people around the kingdom and living in the castle that he could spend time with. For the first time, he could have friendships that went beyond hired hands by his father...
Dean nodded and started pulling open cabinets. These were all empty except the far cabinet where there were a few cans of soup and crackers. Dean was smiling as he pulled them down. “These were Sammy’s and my favorites,” he said fondly, running a thumb over the label before putting them on the counter. He would toss them in his bag later.
He forced himself to keep his head down and watch his feet instead of looking at the mile markers. The backpack was what was slowing him down, that was all. He was going to be fine. He would be in Sioux Falls before nightfall.
Castiel jumped once more, spinning around at the deep voice behind him, and then promptly stared. Standing in the walkway was the most gorgeous Alpha he’d ever seen. The man’s hair was light brown, glinting in the midday sun, and accented a set of the most beautiful green eyes Castiel had ever seen. He was mesmerized but the dusting of freckles scattering across the Alpha’s cheeks when he realized the Alpha was smirking at him. Castiel felt his cheeks flush when he realized he’d been staring.
Jack smiled and nodded, holding onto the wax like a lifeline. The two lit candles flickered and danced, an easy calm falling over them all. Finally, Jack spoke again. “My mom told me I would have to choose… that she didn’t want me to stay here in the house by myself after she was gone. I know most of the families have offered for me to live with them but…” Jack gave a small shrug, looking over at Dean this time. “I don’t want to stay with any of them.”
The water was ice cold as he dipped the towel in it, ringing out the excess before starting to scrub at the muck on his face and his neck. Beside him, the whirring of the soap dispenser caught his attention Dean turned his head to see Castiel staring at it with a frustrated look.
Would they still be here? Spending a fall evening after a day of carving pumpkins and barbeque, sitting around a fire, fingers sticky with marshmallows? Would the s’mores turn into sweet, goodnight kisses and putting their kids to bed with promises of more later?
“Fine,” Gabriel sighed, turning to go rein in the kids, “Cassie is upstairs with Kali trying to get some of the decorations from the attic.”
The ‘unit’, as Vicki called it, was much quieter than the kid’s floor he and Gabriel were staying at. There were more people rushing around, nurses and doctors and workers in their white coats, but none of them were laughing or talking like the nurses on their floor did. Castiel wondered why they all weren’t laughing with their patients like Vicki and the other nurses did.
“What-” Dean blinked, realizing he was looking out of a window in a motel, rain pounding down against the glass. Although he couldn’t remember the last Christmas he’d had with his parents, as soon as he turned around and looked around the motel room, he knew this one.
Lucas immediately pushed Castiel forward, jerking Gabriel behind him and then standing at the back. Castiel didn't understand the point of them being in a single file line when they were being good standing behind Uncle Zach... Castiel looked up and met his Uncle's eyes and immediately shrank back into Gabriel's chest.
“Oh, uh, yeah…” Dean nodded. “We’re working on a new schedule, right now I have him Friday nights and every other weekend. But I bring him home to his mom’s after school during the week.”
Jo nodded and bent down, coming back up with two tankards. “He came in a little while ago, but he’s at The Bunker. Mom made up a few roast turkeys and all the fixins for dinner, I can pack you up a basket if you want to head over there with some food.”
“Stop him, Sam! Stop him!” Dean whispered, stepping close to his brother’s back, his eyes wide as he watched Castiel pick up the bowl.
How unfair was that? He and Dean would never be, not after… not anymore. But why did he want it so badly? Why did leaving, heading to his car, and driving to his house feel so wrong? Why was he still in l-
He was smiling again and Dean checked the rearview mirror to make sure he wasn’t holding up any traffic before he took a moment to watch him. At the end of the song, Castiel started singing the next one and Dean pulled back out onto the road.
“Are you sure?” Castiel hissed. Dean nodded, reaching back to grab Castiel’s arm and drag him forward. They’d walked further than they’d meant to, the sun going down on them faster than they’d anticipated. Finding a place to bunk down for the night was hard enough as is, nevermind attempting to do it in the dark.
Dean narrowed his eyes and reached forward, grabbing the bowl quickly before he could change his mind.
“I would like to stay as close to the marina as we can,” Castiel admitted, turning in the seat to look out the side and rear windows. “We could try to break into the youth center, see if anything is in there?”
If he was attacked now, by a creature or another human, he didn’t think he would have the strength to fight back.
“I have the perfect spot,” Dean agreed and almost bounced out of the room to get the saddle for Crowley. He let a large black horse from its stall and quickly got him ready to ride. When both horses were settled, Dean opened up the back doors before climbing on top of Crowley. He waited for Castiel to be seated on Phoenix, then urged the horses forward.
By the time lunch was announced, Castiel was buzzing with excitement. It was only Balthazar’s steady hand on his arm, leading him towards the dining hall, that kept him from bolting to the stables.
They rode in silence, Dean taking them around the back of the castle and towards the forest. Castiel almost asked where Dean was going, until he spotted a well groomed trail weaving between the trees. He smiled to himself as he coaxed Phoenix faster. From the cleanliness and care Castiel observed of the horses and stable, the way Dean would give encouragement and praise every few minutes, and the well kept trails, it was clear Dean was not only good at his job, but enjoyed it. It was a much different atmosphere and feeling than he’d gotten from the Horsemaster in Casern…
“Oh my God, I knew we would be friends!” Garth exclaimed, stepping forward and hugging Dean tightly. “I
“No way,” Castiel said quickly, shaking his head. He had a smile on his lips though and Dean tried his best to mimic his brother’s puppy-dog eyes. “Dean, it's not practical to cart that thing across the country!”
Jack jumped slightly at being addressed and his cheeks pinked as he nodded. “I’ve never seen any of the Great Lakes, but I love being on a boat.”
Ahead, he could just make out the bright orange top of the tent and he had only a second to consider calling out for Cas or running when a second snap to his right made the decision for him. Dean bolted, running towards the tent as fast as he could.
Castiel Kline, a decade older, and still as fucking gorgeous as he’d been the last day Dean saw him, crying in his bedroom and walking out of his life. He was a little taller, his shoulders broader, and had a confidence about him that made Dean ache with pride. Even from a distance, Dean could see the years had been good to him - long gone was the teenager that preferred libraries and the band room, with thick black rimmed glasses, begging rides off his brother if Dean couldn’t get the Impala from his dad. The insecurity and shame born of parents who simply didn’t understand, causing him to close in on himself was gone, and fuck if Castiel didn’t shine.
“Shit,” Castiel groaned, his fingers tightening in Dean’s hair, but it wasn’t until Dean nodded and tapped out his permission on Castiel’s thigh, that Castiel groaned again and took his pleasure. Dean’s eyes fluttered closed and he moaned around Castiel’s cock, keeping his lips open and relaxed as Castiel fucked up into his mouth.
“Me too,” Sam agreed, nodding his head. He pulled back, wiping his face on his sleeve and turning his head up to the ceiling. Eileen gave him a moment to compose himself, then got off the floor to pick up their food and close the motel door.
His room was exactly how he’d left it, Jimmy’s things as well. It both made him happy and ache at the same time, the sudden overwhelming realization that Jimmy was gone made it hard to breathe. He pulled a pair of sweatpants over his pajamas and quietly moved through the house to the front door. With boots and jacket on, he slipped outside, taking a seat on the front porch.
Slowly, Dean turned around, and Castiel watched his throat move as he swallowed. “I don’t want to intrude...”
of a woman in labor was what Hollywood showed him, and he was sure that was less than realistic. Castiel had dropped down to his knees beside the bed and had the sheet covering Gilda’s body pulled up to her knees.
“I went dark then, cut off everyone and everything until your brother came into the picture.” Dean looked up and gave a small shrug. “Wouldn’t let my own brother into my house, but yours? He didn’t take no for an answer.”
“In simple terms,” Missouri replied, holding out her hand. “I’ve always had an eye for possibilities. That’s what this is, Dean. It's a possibility. As you and I both know, our choices can change our fates, and what is written may not always be what comes to pass.”
Dean nodded and leaned back against the closed door, watching out the window as Benny steered the boat to where he wanted it and then started to shut her down. Anchor dropped, Benny removed the keys from the ignition and dropped them into a coffee mug on the dash.
“Does your belly hurt?” Dean asked, watching Jack’s head move side to side. “Did you get hurt out on the playground?” Another no. “Do you want me to get your dad?”
“Don’t worry, Cassie,” Gabriel said softly after a moment, when they were both sure she was gone. “I won’t let us get separated.”
It had been two days since they’d learned about the water and the ‘Feast’. Dean’s plan to confront Chuck and call him out was shot down and they were playing by Charlie’s rules. He looked across the table at Charlie and Gilda who were staring at Chuck with narrowed eyes.
Dean's hand moving against his waist, pulling him in, and the Alpha's lips pressing to his own was the only answer Castiel needed.
“Isn’t she beautiful?” Dean asked, running his fingers over the hood and looking up to see Cas still watching him. “Bitch to make out in the back of, though. Not enough room.”
The air around them was silent but cold, making Dean open his eyes and step forward, checking that Benny wasn’t still touching him. The man in question wasn’t near Dean at all, standing a few feet ahead of him, leaning against the siding of a large, light green house. Dean swallowed hard as he looked around the yard, realizing where they were.
Dean gave a small laugh and shook his head. “No, I didn’t punch him… as much as I wanted to. I offered Lisa and Ben a safe place. I helped Lisa get established elsewhere, Sammy helped actually, and I got her and Ben out of here.”
Dean followed Jack’s gaze. There were twelve boats in front of them, small sailboats that wouldn’t give them the cover they would need to cross the entire lake. Further out, floating on the water, were several larger cabin cruisers.
Dean nodded and Castiel took that for what it was, dropping his bag beside Dean’s before they joined the rest of the group once more. Unlike the trust Dean immediately felt for Cas, he didn’t feel the same with this new group. Maybe it was how they were greeted, or perhaps the glaring from Uriel, or the over-the-top excitement from Anna, but Dean
“We should send the kids to Gabe’s house at least once a week,” Dean finally said, pushing back into Castiel’s warmth. They would have to get up soon, but for right then, he was more than content to bask in the afterglow. “Or maybe we can have Claire babysit and can sneak over to my house.”
Slowly, they approached the first mobile home, Dean walking up the deck steps and Charlie taking a defensive stance at the bottom, looking out around the park in case anything was to come at them. He knocked, three times, against the glass window and all of them held their breath.
choice?” Dean asked, then shut the car door, walking around the front to join Castiel. They didn’t need to be overheard by the retreating group. “It's… weird how trusting they are. Tell me you don’t think that this is weird! Hell, I could get into the freaking car and plow them down, you know?”
“None of us were,” Benny added,  clapping Dean’s shoulder before opening the door for them to Chuck’s office. Dean froze as he looked over the people milling about their cots, a few throwing them quizzical glances. “Act normal.”
Dean moved around the large tree they had pitched the tent in front of, reaching for the rope they’d fastened as a pulley up in the branches to keep their backpacks off the ground. He picked through his bag quickly, pulling out two empty tin cans, coffee, and some packages of oatmeal before shaking the canteen. Sighing, Dean laid their breakfast down in the leaves and hoisted the bags back up. He needed to fill the canteens, but leaving the food bag down was just asking for trouble.
“Mom let him stay a night or two on the couch before she threw a fit and told him he couldn’t take up the living room.” She turned the glass in her fingers. “He crashed on my bedroom floor after that. Started bringing a sleeping bag with him when he came.”
Castiel’s hands were gentle as they moved over Dean’s side, his lips pressing kiss after kiss to Dean’s shoulders and back.
As he unlocked the bathroom door, he paused and took a moment to listen before letting himself back out into the storefront. He made his way over to a rack of postcards and maps on the far side of the store. He looked through the maps, and grabbed a few that would be useful to him, stowing most in his bag and keeping the local one out for reference. Thankfully, they carried foldouts of the surrounding areas along with the ones of the United States as a whole.
There was a slight shift, less hurried, as they shared the air between them. Each kiss was sweet, each touch dragged out, until the rest of their clothes were peeled free and every inch of them was pressed together.
Instead, he ignored her and pushed forward. Castiel placed the bowl down on the dresser, looking at future-Dean, passed out on his stomach, a look of discontent on his face, even in sleep. Dean wanted to scream, but he could only watch as Castiel finished off the spell, the light fizzing out into a powder blue smoke that filled the room.
He pushed the thought away and instead focused on hanging up his coat and pulling off his gloves and boots. Gabriel, however, hadn’t returned yet and he took a deep breath, realizing he couldn’t put it off for much longer.
Wherever Castiel’s skin touched, Dean’s was on fire. He breathed in each of Castiel’s kisses as if they were the reason he was still living, oxygen be damned. Castiel fit against him and he pulled Dean’s leg up over his thigh, fingers trailing down the base of Dean’s spine, disappearing into the cleft of Dean’s ass.
They had less than twenty-four hours to stop Chuck’s plan. And the bottom line was that they didn’t have time to save Dean. He either needed to save himself or… well. He glanced over at Becky again and then shut his eyes.
The man was sipping from a wine glass, his eyes narrowed and a small smirk on his lips as he looked around the room slowly. There were people beside him, but no one was talking to him, although Dean watched as each person at his table continued to throw him glances and honest-to-God bows - as much as their position would allow.
“I’ll leave you to it,” Dean said after a moment and Castiel jumped, forgetting he was standing there. “I’ll let Rowena know you’re in here.”
Now, Castiel was using them to pull the cans of ravioli and green beans from the coals, setting them down sizzling in a prepared spot by the fire. Dean pushed up to his knees, moving over to hand Castiel one of the two forks. Sitting side by side, they dug into their dinner.
“Ah, your Royal Highness!” Jo greeted, giving him a wink. “How are you doing this evening? Here for a drink?”
Sam hummed and Dean prepared himself for Sam to ask when he was going to get back out there. That was a conversation he really didn’t want to have. Sam already knew, of course, but still…
“I don’t have a mom,” the boy answered with a shrug, almost losing the rolls again. “Daddy is arguing with Claire about ‘propriate language in public.” The boy beamed back up at him and Dean found himself smiling.
"Very well. I have all of the required paperwork, so stand in line behind me. Youngest to oldest, please. Lucas, its your job to make sure your brothers stay in their line, understand?" Uncle Zach nodded his head as if Lucas had answered, then turned around to take the keys out of the car. He started speaking to the man at the window again, then got out of the car.
“He’s got it,” Castiel reassured him, reaching for Dean’s arms again and pulling him up. Dean’s legs were like jelly and he was glad Castiel was there to hold him up. “We need to get out of here, now.”
“Nothing went wrong,” Dean reassured him, giving him another tight squeeze. “You did amazing, Cas. Gilda is fine and their baby is beautiful. What you did was amazing.”
Dean walked towards the river bank, the moonlight reflecting off the snow on the ground, giving him enough light to see in the dark. He held his breath as he looked over the water at the city. They were standing atop the train tracks, the Hudson River as dark and murky as Dean had always known it to be. But Poughkeepsie…
In the room, a man with curly brown hair that was just starting to grey was sitting over an old typewriter. He wore jeans and a shirt, but had a worn-looking blue and white striped bathrobe on over his clothes. He looked up, slipping his thick black glasses off before folding them and placing them on the desk.
“Grab your shit, Cas,” Dean said as he ripped his bag from the floor, bundling his arms full of their sleeping gear. Castiel nodded and grabbed his own bag, raising his pistol to Uriel’s head, letting off a single shot as they walked around Anna’s corpse. Uriel fell heavily over Alfie’s body and Castiel flinched once before turning away.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared in my life,” Castiel whispered and Dean immediately wrapped his arms around him, holding onto him tightly. “I’m an orthopaedic doctor, not an obstetrician. I don’t know what I would’ve done if things had gone wrong…”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, bumping shoulders with Castiel. The small smile he received let him know he was forgiven.
As he pulled out onto the main road, heading towards the end of Lawrence, he let his mind wander, checking out the cars in the parking lots and the people milling about. As he passed by Dillons, he made a split second decision and pulled into the parking lot. Whisky was out of the question, but he could go for a freakin’ apple pie. Maybe even two.
“I can’t even think when you’re screaming like that, Castiel! Enough!” Daddy yelled back, and it only made Castiel cry harder. “Lucas! Why are you terrorizing your brother?”
“This ‘sour puss’ doesn’t want to see those stupid characters,” Lucas interrupted, and suddenly Mickey was being ripped from Castiel’s hands.
to just come in,” she blurted out, immediately reaching for him and slipping her arm through his, “but Bal made me promise to give you space.”
“You didn’t get shot,” Dean said with a shrug, walking away a few steps. The area around them was dense with trees, but there was enough space to set up a makeshift camp for the rest of the night. “So I suppose I will live to see another day.”
“Well, I should hope not. Otherwise, you would’ve been mated by now or you would’ve let your mate go. Did it feel painful to walk away from him today?” Anna asked and Castiel nodded, watching her smile grow even wider. “Oh, Castiel! You must tell me
Time seemed to stop and Dean couldn’t get enough of the press of Castiel’s lips to his, the heat of his body. But all too soon, Castiel was pulling back, his tongue tracing his bottom lip where
“Cas, you were supposed to call me back…” Sam said softly, sighing. “You said the hunt was basically a salt and burn… It’s been four days.” Sam hesitated again then sighed before pulling the phone back and hanging up. The phone immediately started ringing and Sam jumped, hitting the answer button.
Dean nodded and gave Castiel one of his brilliant smiles. “Alright, Sam, you win. Let’s show Cas the town.”
Castiel looked to the side, his eyes tracking a single firefly that was closer than the rest. Above him, he felt Dean shift slightly and knew he was looking at the same bug. "I wish..." Castiel whispered, then shut his eyes, finishing his wish silently. When he opened his eyes again, Dean was looking down at him with a soft smile.
The sound of his breathing was loud in his ears and he stayed, frozen on the bed, too afraid to sit up or look around in case the chains came back. Then, the sound of them scraping against the concrete floor, unmuffled despite the rug Dean had spread out beneath the bed, made him jerk back and press against the headboard.
Dean glanced at Garth’s hand and took a step forward, shaking it quickly. “Dean, Cas, and Jack,” he replied, just barely catching Jesse’s suspicious look. “We’re wary of strangers.”

Castiel turned his head to look back at their car, the man who had been talking to their Uncle was now getting into to drive it away. They followed after Uncle Zach, the older man not once turning around to look at them until they were standing in line to get their tickets. When he did turn around, the three of them immediately knew they were in trouble.
“It’s been… a trying few years for Claire, the last few months have been very stressful. She lost her mom a little over a year ago from…” he trailed off and cleared his throat. Claire helpfully supplied, “Heroin Whooooooore,” and Castiel shut his eyes for a moment.
Castiel paused mid-bite, a green bean slipping from his fork and landing on his jeans. He swore under his breath and picked it up, giving it half a look before shoving it into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully.
Despite her crushing his head to her chest, Castiel found himself laughing. “I was dying to talk to you at dinner, but it didn’t seem like the appropriate place.”
Dean swallowed hard. “I never asked you to fight for me.” His voice cracked and it wasn’t what he’d meant to say, but the words hung heavy in the air between them. Castiel turned around again fully, his head cocked to the side as he looked Dean over.
