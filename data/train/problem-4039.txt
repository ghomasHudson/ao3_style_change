“Now me,” Dean said, rolling up his sleeves. “Gabriel, stand back. This one might give you nightmares.”
But he didn’t hate this.
Dean got lost in his eyes, mesmerised by the sunlight filtering through the blue. Select strands of Castiel’s dark hair glowed blonde; the ridges in his fine lips were accentuated; his cheekbones looked sharper than ever before.
But it was
’.” Sam smiled, hearing his own falsetto. “But me, I was just quiet. I kept my head down, I did the work, and I improved all the time. But she never put a ‘well done’ on my pop quiz, she never gave me one of those cool magic stickers that move around the paper.”
“Jeez, what’s up with you?” Charlie asked.
Dean grimaced. “You don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.”
Castiel stepped up onto the dais, shooing away the students who hovered at the desk to compare their mixtures to everyone else’s.
“I come here to think,” Charlie said, sitting down beside Dean on the curved stone, facing him with their knees touching. “It’s so peaceful.” She smiled up at a phoenix, who was perched atop the giant white statue of itself. The real phoenix preened its red feathers, warbling under its breath. Another bird came to sit beside it, but it was not a phoenix: it was a magpie.
Dean laughed. “Dude, come on. Objectively speaking, you’re
“You can always come back,” Gertrude said. “Any time, my door’s open.”
“Yes.” Castiel turned around fully, eyes enigmatic as he smiled at Dean, their hips pushed together. Castiel kissed Dean’s nose, then tipped his head and grinned against his lips. “And as the Head of Department, I must insist that you cease distracting your teacher from his work.”
Charlie caught Dean’s eye, and she smiled. “It’s true. You do a little pouty-face, like you’re kissing something invisible, and you look down, and you look away.”
A regular phoenix song was something known as a
“And you count that as a wish coming true?” Castiel smiled. “Dean, I didn’t quit because of a wish coming true, I quit because after months of thinking and consideration, I finally reached a conclusion.”
“Is this because teachers at Jinxes aren’t allowed relationships?”
Castiel mouthed “young’un” and “kiddo” to himself, committing the instruction to memory.
Sam liked to think he fell through the cracks. He liked to think he was invisible, that nobody really knew he existed. That way he could become a spy when he grew up. One foot in the Muggle world, one in the wizards’.
“I don’t think I understood baseball all that well.” Dean took his place on the scuffed-up block that served as their home plate. “I was eleven when I came to Jinxes. I learned baseball from homeless kids, who learned it from other homeless kids. I don’t think anyone I met had ever seen a real baseball game.”
“Or thirsty,” Charlie joked, to a playful pat from Sam.
“Yeah, good for you, kiddo. I’m the one who stopped up all your nosebleeds over the years. Not to mention fixed five broken bones, healed up countless burns and turned your ears back into ears. You
Then he wrapped his arms around Castiel’s muscular waist, holding him tight for a while.
Dean came to the door that used to be Castiel’s door, but now it was his door too, so he didn’t bother to knock. He opened it and walked in, and Charlie followed.
Dean let a breathy laugh fall from his lips. “Okay. That’s answer enough. Good to know. You take things super literally. And you never answer questions properly the first time I ask. Guess that’s a thing.”
His eyes were Dean’s eyes, nobody else’s.
Castiel held his own hand, fingers scrunched into the knees of his pyjamas.
“Oh, Dean, no—” Castiel cried. He turned to Mariela, but her glare made him swallow his complaints, and he sank back, letting Mariela take a five-dollar bill from Dean’s hand.
The class clamoured in their offence, and Castiel waved a hand to quiet them, mouth open, “But I will be teaching you! I mean what I say when I promise I won’t let you fail. If any of you find you’re struggling, do not hesitate to tell me. If you forget your coursework,
Castiel cocked his head. He wound his way to the other side of the table, and chalked his cue, as if serious about this last move. He bent, and went still...
“Third,” Castiel said, raising a finger, “is to clean your cauldron out.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean mumbled, head down. “Kind of exciting. Cooking something other than... charred animal carcasses. It’s organic, too! I swear, I’ve never seen Sammy happier in my life.”
Castiel slowly closed the book, and he set it down on a tea table. He fetched a wool blanket and he draped it over Dean, just in case he felt cold. He seemed so delicate when he slept, Castiel mused. The hardiness in his voice and the brutal shift of his shoulders was all gone; he rested like a limp flower, petals closed up for the night.
After five minutes of clockwise stirring, Dean’s enchanted egg timer on the windowsill buzzed time’s-up, and Dean shook out his aching hand. With a sigh of relief, he moved to the next stage listed in the textbook.
Dean blew a raspberry.
“But do you
Castiel held Dean’s corseted waist and buried his face against his neck.
Dean lowered his eyes, shrugging. “I liked it, that’s all. Maybe our relationship changed, I don’t know.”
“No.”
Castiel’s eyes widened. “You’re... lying.”
you to succeed?”
“Where?”
“Egg?”
“I looked at the exit roster,” Dean said. “Twelve of them are retiring, six are taking maternity leave, four paternity leave, and the other eleven are taking up jobs with witches and wizards in Muggle cities. That only leaves—” Dean glanced at his fingers and counted, “thirty-three house elves. Frick. We can’t play zen baseball with thirty-three house elves.”
summer that we started out? Transferring your math program into Sam and Kevin’s capable hands so you’d have more time to bake – I thought that was crazy, ‘cause then I’m barbecuing by myself while Charlie rings up totals. Those three months were
Castiel sobbed and laughed as he came on Dean, across his belly like last time. His head was bent forward, his torso raised while his hips carried on nudging Dean. His hair was black with sweat, its sheen caught in orange and yellow from the candles. He smiled asymmetrically, dark eyes drinking down the sight of Dean splattered with a sticky white mess.
Castiel covered his face with both hands and nodded, rocking forward, bumping backward into the wall. He didn’t know why so many tears rushed from his eyes, but they were cool and they trickled between his fingers, evaporating before they reached his wrists. Charlie set her arms around him, and he curled up small under her embrace.
wanted—?
“I need the effects to be permanent.” Castiel looked twice as exhausted than he had mere minutes ago. “At the very least, drinking a small amount once a week ought to be the limit. Not enough to poison me.”
Charlie pretended not to react, taking a chocolate and popping it into her mouth to hide her massive grin.
Missouri considered her for a while. Then she looked at Joshua, who shrugged.
“I wouldn’t call it a potion, per se,” Castiel said, leading Dean over to a cauldron on a side-desk hidden in the shadows, near a shoulder-height alcove filled with unlit candles. With a wave of his wand, Castiel set the candles alight.
“Hey, I like an edge,” Dean smiled. “Slice of lemon. Twist of orange. Little bit of sarcasm here and there.”
“I’m fine.”
The mascot of Qurdruk was a scarlet lizard sunning itself on an orange rock. The mascot, combined with the layout of their common room, led to ideas that Qurdruks were lazy or too comfort-oriented – but for most, the opposite was true. Qurdruks were hard workers, and they always knew where to put their feet. Literally. That’s why they made such good sportspeople. Some were arrogant, perhaps, but Sam liked to think he wasn’t. He probably was a bit, though.
“Dean,” Sam said, approaching from Dean’s other side. “I found Christmas decorations.”
“Cas...
But it was short lived. Castiel and Gilda came to the place where Charlie danced with the mystery woman, and the song ended. The room stopped spinning, and cheers and laughter filled up the sweet-smelling hall. Castiel and Gilda had to turn and applaud the band along with everyone else, and only then did a new song begin.
queen of the jungle, pal,” Dean said, resting his hand on his Patronus’s back. He couldn’t quite feel the tiger, but he sensed emotion in her form, rather than fur or warmth. It felt like joy.
” – and only then did Dean blink out of his stupor and look down at his food.
Bobby sat down on the bed adjacent to Dean, hands on his knees. “Welp, here comes trouble.”
Charlie turned and waved, and Castiel waved back. He watched Charlie leave, then he returned to his work.
“Hrmph,” Castiel said, though he didn’t sound surprised.
Castiel suddenly had a flush in his cheeks. Dean took the other man’s hips, dancing in up-nods and forward steps, sideways and backwards steps, taking Cas with him half the time. Castiel remained stiff, but watched Dean dance with dark eyes, curious and reticent at once.
“Hoped?” Gilda grinned. Below her golden mask, her lashes fluttered the way Dean’s did on witch days, whenever he wore his false lashes.
“The more secrecy the better,” Charlie said. “We all want it to be a surprise. The kids’ minds are going to be
Dean bit his lip, and Charlie missed the moment where his eyes welled up: the next thing she knew, tears flooded down Dean’s face. Charlie didn’t think she’d ever seen him this upset.
, inside, forever—? Cas, that’s not the same as what I wanted for myself. It’s not the same at all.”
Dean set a hand on his head, and felt a flare of excitement as he felt the gel in his hair growing out, becoming softer as his locks thickened, tickling the tops of his ears. “Oh my God,” he laughed, gripping his scalp, feeling his hands filling up with hair that curled against his palms. He let go and it tumbled to his shoulders; he looked left and it swept back, he looked right and it swung to hit him in the face, stinging his eyes. He laughed, eyes watering.
Dean swallowed his mouthful, his smile waning slightly. “I got this,” he said again. “I’ve planned this class to the detail, forwards and backwards. If I screw up...” He shook his head. “Not gonna happen.”
Dean watched this with some contentment. But as Charlie and Gertrude began to talk between themselves, Dean found his attention drifting. He tried not to be rude and look at Gertrude’s bedroom uninvited, instead focusing just on the birds. However, his eyes wandered of their own accord.
“For what?” Mary asked.
Sam stared blankly at Charlie. Then he blinked a few times and his expression seemed to reset to normal. He frowned. “Since when was the Valentine’s Day celebration a masquerade ball?” he asked.
“What is that, two full weeks worth of pent-up boners?” Dean asked. “If you’re anything like me, that’s about twenty orgasms just waiting to happen.”
A shaky smile lifted the corners of Castiel’s lips.
Castiel sighed, staring at Dean morosely. “I wouldn’t. That much at once would kill me. And the most it could give me is a few hours of normality.”
Around Missouri and Joshua, the plants bloomed, the glitter falling from the walls beamed like sunlight, and the vines seemed to grow as everyone watched. The smell of the Fountain Room became even more glorious, and Castiel felt himself falling under its bewitching spell. He wanted to dance like that with Dean. He wanted everyone to understand how fate brought them together so perfectly.
“You’re telling me,” the younger Charlie said, pulling out one of the student’s chairs to sit in. Dean sat opposite at another desk, spooning lamb and cornbread into his open mouth.
Water glistened on Dean’s chin. Castiel leaned up to kiss it off, every droplet cool and sweet on the seam of his lips.
Castiel peeked at the audience, who watched in a simmering silence. He saw movement and he heard whispers, but he knew everyone was held rapt, ever fascinated. Who was this beautiful woman dancing with the Potions teacher? Who knew he had a girlfriend? Aren’t they sweet together? Aren’t they gorgeous? Do you think they’re in love? They look like they’re in love. You can’t dance like that if you’re not in love.
“What’s your phoenix’s name?” Charlie asked.
“We’ll be waiting for you, boss,” Kevin promised, cheekily. Castiel grinned at him, then accepted his high-five.
Dean sighed and rolled his eyes, taking Castiel’s chin in a hand and turning it his way.
“I loved this one,” Castiel admitted, blue eyes cast softly towards Dean. “Call it an awakening of sorts. A lot of late nights studying, I heard it a lot.”
Charlie scoffed.
“It was my own fault,” Dean said, sniffing as he took off the other line of eyelashes. “You warned me not to take the potion too soon. I was just... God, so
Today, presently: Castiel instructed his sixth-years to transfer their Calming Draughts into glass vials.
Gasps flooded the room as
The phoenix rumbled, apparently amused by Castiel’s politeness. With a nod, it spread its wings and took off. It followed the same path Inferno had.
“What’s the word?” the phoenix asked, tilting her head curiously.
Dean seemed to sense Castiel’s inability to process a meaning in all of this, because he glanced down, then leapt into a real conclusion: “Look, all I’m saying is, you don’t seem to realise
to do so I spend all my time procrastinating—”
Dean sank an inch down the car hood. “Is that why it’s taking you ‘n me so long to get on with it?”
Castiel nodded fervently, his forehead shining with a gloss of gold, the very last of the daylight caressing his side. “Dean,” he said. “Ah... Hmm—”
? See.
After some thought, he slipped off his shoes without unlacing them, and flung them under the table. Now with socked feet on the carpet, he was a half-inch shorter and had more control. Dean observed this, and arched his lip in a considerative shrug. Sam laughed quietly and patted his brother.
that about him and hadn’t factored that into his game. And Castiel couldn’t even save him a damn cake, either!
“It’s a...” Charlie hesitated. “I don’t really know. It’s not a sickness, but it’s a thing that people have. It makes them a certain way. Different. But it can be good different. It just makes life hard sometimes. For you and the people around you. Mostly because people don’t understand.”
, indeed,” Castiel said fondly. He sang along as he found a wok and turned on the stove. “
“But Cas—” Dean stood up, gripping the cauldron in Castiel’s hands, keeping him from pouring it down the nearest sink. They hovered inches apart, Dean’s breath on Castiel’s face. Dean felt his sadness weighing heavily between them, keeping the moment tense. “After two years of nothing, you succeeded, even if it was only for a few seconds,” Dean breathed. “But now you’re saying you need something else. Tell me what changed. Tell me what this potion did.”
“You really never played?” Dean asked, rubbing something chalky on the end of his cue. “Naaaah. You’re hustlin’ me, huh.”
Castiel eased his attention back to his parchments for the purpose of occupying his hands. “I’m only trying to help.”
“I don’t know,” Castiel said truthfully. “Last night he told me he’d drink the potion I made him...” He looked around, but no flash of pink met his eye. The students wore blue and yellow and silver and purple, but pink, Castiel supposed, was reserved for Dean. “The party started the best part of an hour ago. I’m starting to think he’s not coming.”
Dean breathed out again through the narrow O of his lips. He kicked off his shoes, then he trod on his socks to remove them.
Slowly, cautiously, Skyking let Sam take his wand.
Dean looked at Castiel in surprise. “You know The Weird Sisters?!”
The boy turned around, his eyes red-rimmed and wide, his freckles distended across his unhappy cheeks.
“It can’t be,” Castiel said under his breath. “Dean looks nothing like that...”
Castiel leaned in and put a kiss on Dean’s cheek, warm and soft and prickly. He pulled back, blushing. Their eyes met. Dean’s whole body was roaring with heat.
Dean took a slow breath in. “Daniel doesn’t really wanna share. But, uh – suffice to say, by the end of the class today, you guys are gonna have him smiling.” With a lopsided smirk, Dean flipped his wand, and the projector shut off, the lights came on, and the projector screen rolled up so he had space to move on his wooden stage.
“No, I’m fishing for you to realise I’m right,” Dean said, tapping Castiel’s knuckles gently. “And you haven’t answered my question yet.”
Dean marvelled how unlikely it was that he’d pulled batter at the same time as Castiel pulled pitcher, but then, he supposed, the chances of it happening had doubled since yesterday. Sam was gone and—
“Mustard; pepper. Olive oil and salt and a touch of balsamic vinegar to bring out the flavours. There’s natural taste in there, I didn’t drown the flavours, as you assumed I would. I just made sure it was uniform. I cut the meat and spread it out so you always get some in your mouth. Everything’s in perfect balance. Hence,” Castiel leaned in conspiratorially, and exposed his dark secret: “the measuring.”
“I think it’s too late,” Dean said, stroking Castiel’s sweaty hair from his forehead. It was growing cold in the chill of the evening. “It was too late from the moment we decided to drive out here. Seriously, Cas, it was too late from the second we
get to do?”
Dean then noticed the sign pinned to the hedge behind their set-up.
“Shut your faces, would you?” shouted Dean from the corner. The room went silent. “Can’t you see the guy can’t make out a single word you’re saying, let alone process it? Jeez. It’s thirty against one. Have some decorum.”
where there’d always been a bulge and a weight.
Castiel got up and crossed the room to join Dean, hands taking his waist. “You could teach as a woman,” Castiel said gently, kissing Dean’s neck. “Everyone saw you at the dance on Friday night. Even if someone missed the revealing moment, the whole school would’ve heard by now. If I know anything about the way salacious stories travel, there’ll be rumours aplenty, and they’ll all be different, but there’ll have one common theme.”
. It’s about—”
“Of us?”
Castiel took off his grey bathrobe and lay it on the foot of the bed, sitting on top of it, rolling up the sleeves of his striped pyjamas. He then grasped his forehead with both hands and dragged his grip back, combing his slightly damp hair. He looked frazzled.
been stealing my lettuce? Dean, for God’s sake, you swore up and down lettuce made you sick! You—” Sam made a wildly frustrated noise, and Dean growled, head in his hands.
“Professor Dean Winchester’s a girl,” Dean said. He let Castiel kiss his neck some more, but he sighed. “I can deal with them knowing you and me are together. I bet there were rumours even before the dance. We can barely keep our hands off each other, and we stare at each other like... I don’t know what we’re like. People were bound to notice. But it’s...
“It wasn’t anything important,” Charlie said with a careless wave. “I can talk to Dean about it if you’re busy.”
“Dean, you should take the other seat,” Charlie said, nudging Dean.
Dean peered at him, then started to beam.
Dean laughed, bringing Sam in for a hug. “Yes way,” he said, kissing the top of Sam’s head. “I’m staying right here. I’ll be moving rooms but I’ll still be at Jinxes. And I’ll be teaching your Charms class next year!”
“Where are we gonna put that?” Dean asked, plopping the rubber duck down into a nest of tinsel. “It’s December twenty-ninth; Christmas is over. And it’s another four or five days until we’re back at Gertrude’s place.”
“I made you some. Come in, come in!” Gertrude moved back, beckoning in the three men standing in the cold. “Bring your animals too. I have a room set up for you already.” She pottered away, rolling up the sleeves of her striped sweater. She went straight to the kitchen, lifting the lid of a steaming pot. She looked back over her shoulder, and Charlie grinned at her. It had been five months since they last saw each other, so this was a welcome moment.
A core-deep ache of sadness came over Castiel. He lifted his wand again, and he uttered, “Reparo.” The broken shoe re-formed on the tiles in front of the door, glinting in the moonlight through the enchanted ceiling.
But, one mere pat on the back, one breathy “Awesome game, man; catch up with you later,” and Dean was away again, drifting into the midst of his friends and family, accepting a gift Kevin’s mother gave him, then letting Bobby give him a pep talk, apparently about the fireplace (there was much gesturing), which clearly irritated Dean but kept him nodding anyway.
“It’s much better when there’s nothing between you and the breeze,” Castiel said. His voice was soft, the odd word touched by the wind and carried away.
“Man, I am telling you, give me five minutes with some clippers—”
But the girl was standing unbalanced, swaying on one foot; she twirled her black plait around one finger, and she spoke softly and giggled too much.
Castiel smiled. “Thank you.” Of course he could still smell the meat, but he was grateful for the gesture. “Do you want some cake? Or there’s pie. Pastry? On me.”
missed Cas! Like, two minutes ago.”
Dean’s mouth opened. “What...?”
Charlie took his hand again and held it so Dean knew he was supported. Dean turned his hand over and squeezed her fingers.
“I know,” Dean chuckled. “I know, don’t worry.”
Dean’s fingers worked against his clit faster, wrinkling the loose skin back and forth, riding in the slippery fluid that had drooled down his scrotum. Dean cried out, whimpering Cas’ name, heaving breaths through his swollen lips and sobbing into the chill of the evening, listening to his own voice lost among buzzing insects and the deep howl of the empty desert.
“A’ight. What’s left? Aw, you bastards ate all the ribs! Come
Dean stared for a bit.
a good boy.”
“Not yet,” Joshua replied. “I’ve thought about it a lot, but so far I’ve come up with nothing.”
The grating howls of the blender drowned out the music for a while: blaring, grumbling, and then pulsing in slushy squelches until Castiel had his pesto.
Eventually Castiel muttered, “I don’t know if this’ll work. I suppose it’s better that I expect nothing so I can’t be disappointed. But I think I might be done.”
Castiel nodded. “Jinxes is home to both of us. If we break the rules here, we have nowhere else to go.”
“You think?” Dean chuckled. “Yeah, I guess it kind of is.”
“Tidying the supply cupboard, actually, but yes.”
“Sam— Sam!” Dean ran across the common room, making a coffee table flip over on the mattress. People complained and shot him dirty looks, but Dean seemed oblivious. He reached Sam, and he grabbed him by both biceps. “Sam. You’re not gonna believe this.”
He led the way, and after a few seconds, Casio swept after him.
“Sam, stop,” Charlie said, stressed by the irritation Sam was exuding. She thought he’d be a calming force but he was worse than the others.
“But then one time, one of those kids died playing Quidditch.” Sam swallowed. “Yeah, it sucks,” he nodded, noticing the fearful vibe that swept through his classroom. “At the time it was horrifying to everyone. It wasn’t so long ago, but all over the world, Quidditch matches weren’t as safe as they are now. But what happened in my Ancient Runes class...”
“First night as a teacher,” Sam said with a broad smile. “That dinner we had together.”
Dean checked they were alone again, then he inched toward Castiel, hoping for a quick kiss.
Dean gave the password as “Flummox.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Not for a few years? Why? What do you wanna do in the meantime?”
Dean grinned, his teeth shining with blue light. “For what?”
Then the accident—
“Nothin’,” Dean said, head down. “Just. Listen, this might sound crazy forward, but is there any chance you’d wanna come by my place next Saturday night? I got a pool table set up and drinks and dinner. Nothing special, but I’m cooking, so.”
“There you go,” Ms. Raglan said, handing the bewildered Daniel his potted lily. “Congratulations.”
tell us,” Dean urged. “Mine was the first time you took me out flying on your broom.” He grinned, glad that Sam’s eyes flashed in recognition. Dean looked back at Castiel. “C’mon, what was yours?”
“My mom’s place,” Charlie said, hooking a stray hair out of her mouth. “I think it’s time we went home.”
Castiel took another spoonful and offered it to Dean. Then he pulled back the spoon and asked, “Wait, did you drink beer?”
Latin became the norm for magic users everywhere. People who spoke Arabic used Latin spells up until the early twentieth century. People who spoke German did away with Latin spells completely around the 1940s. That particular change was part of a bigger revolution, but nobody really liked to talk about that.
freckled ass outta the fire, Cinderella. You just enjoy your time with Cas. Fairy godsister Charlie’s got it all under control.”
But Dean was a different person these days. He liked home. And soft things. Lettuce. Cake. And Cas.
a potion, not before another one. Even a fleck of dust can disrupt the constitution of thousands of otherwise simple potions.”
“Dean?” came Sam’s distant voice.
Dean bit his lip, feeling a fierce throb between his legs. Cas was a friend. Dean’s best friend. His co-worker. It was weird to find him sexy. Dean had always thought Cas was handsome, but it was weird to want to look at the guy without any clothes on, and it was weird to wish Castiel wasn’t looking back so Dean could look at him properly.
With a sparkle, Castiel’s waistcoat and jacket became green, pale like apples, sparkling like perfectly-hewn peridot. Everything else became a dark warm brown, like faded gold. He dazzled, like Dean dazzled. Together they were a tree, ripe green fruit bathed in sunset light.
Dean bit his lip, hiding the fact he’d been kidding about the bedtime. Cas seemed very practical about his trash-talk all of a sudden.
is satisfied he has something to
miss? Living out a day all in one go,” Charlie said, tucking her colourful beaded hair behind her ears. “I can’t remember the last time I had breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the right order.”
Castiel’s brain was suddenly very empty, too empty to figure out how to end the silence.
“Try it,” Castiel insisted, taking a little silver trowel from under that pie, and sliding a piece into a paper bag. “On the house. Or on the street, as it happens.”
“Thanks, man,” he said as he pulled the clothes from his mouth, then scratched at his short beard. “You, uh. You guys professional bakers, or...?”
Dean gripped Sam’s shoulder and patted him. “This is it.”
Dean gaped, appalled. “Am I the only one around here who values proper sportsmanship?”
“Oh, that’s not true, Dean,” Castiel said derisively.
“Sam too,” Dean added. “And Charlie. I drop this truth bomb on you last night, and now you’re all like, sure, what do you need? Sam gave me a bottle of nail polish this morning. I mean, he said that someone he dated left it behind, but I— I’m just...?”
Dean mirrored her position, reaching forward to take her hands. “Hey. Dude. Tell me. What’s the matter?”
feminine for no obvious reason when I was around, then embracing it the moment he thought I wasn’t there to see him, I started to think he was overcompensating for something.” With a smile, Sam finished his drink too, and he slid it over to sit beside Castiel’s empty glass. “For a while after I realised he was into you, I thought the overcompensation was just because he was into men and didn’t feel like sharing that with me. But, uh... Guess it’s more than that.”
The sunburn was worth it, though. He’d never played a game where the outcome didn’t matter, where there was no pressure to win. Dean compared playing baseball with the house elves to playing a video game on the zen setting, which Castiel did not understand at all, but he knew what ‘zen’ meant, and he could agree with that.
Castiel nodded with a smile. “Thank you.”
“I do know what the potion’s for,” Castiel said. “It’s you who doesn’t.”
He kept up with the house elves. The house elves were cool. But the house elves weren’t Dean.
“Dean,” Charlie smiled. “Have you got a crush on Cas?”
When the students had eaten, Dean snuck another bowl of lamb stew and buttered cornbread out of the Great Hall, and he carried it slowly through the school’s underground hallways. Some hallways, like this one, were enchanted so that the ceiling looked like a window. Tipping his head back, Dean could see a fluffy white cloud drifting past in the evening sun. A phoenix flew overhead, swooping towards the Astronomy tower, which was so tall that it made Dean dizzy to see it.
Dean bit his lip sheepishly, but he smiled in a quiet, thankful way. He didn’t look upset any more, and Charlie was so very, very glad. She looked around at the others, and was even more pleased to see them smiling.
“I... um.” Castiel’s eyes darted to Charlie, then back to Dean. “I wasn’t expecting you so soon.”
“Don’t be such a spoilsport, Cas,” Dean uttered. “I see Lady Meridyth and Lord Donghat showing off some crazy good talent.”
Castiel flushed with heat upon being called ‘hot stuff’, again at the shortened use of his name, then again at the cuss. “Thank you,” he snapped, rather shaken by the tingles that refused to settle.
“Boobs?!” Dean gripped the neck of his t-shirt and looked underneath. He yelped in joy as he saw breasts swelling from his chest, growing as he watched. He could no longer see his navel, and in a moment, he could no longer see his nipples, either. He let go of his shirt and set both hands on his breasts, squeezing them. They were sensitive and soft and
would have trouble finding something to wear to a ball, is it? I’m the perfect size!
Castiel put back the book he’d been pawing through, then paced forward in a tiny panic, unsure whether it would be rude to run away now, when the place was such a mess. It wasn’t just that Mariela taught him better; he had his own set of manners and saddling the host with a room full of garbage after Dean went to so much trouble was, frankly, unthinkable.
Dean put on his own apron, the one with
“Yeah,” Dean said. For once he did know.
“What was that about?” Sam asked Charlie beside him, frowning.
They drove to a lighthouse on the eastern shore of the country, and they stood in the grey wind, their clothes flapping in violent bursts. They shielded their eyes from the sunrise, watching the straight rays as gold bled between the boiling clouds.
Despite all evidence to the contrary, Dean didn’t strike Castiel as an especially highly strung person. He seemed to be responding solely to his family’s agitation. Castiel loitered for a while, wondering if the other Winchesters were okay. Sammy, like Charlie, had been trapped in that sweltering metal box for many, many hours, and Castiel was growing concerned for all their health. It had to feel like the Pit itself inside there.
“Huh? What’ve I done?”
“What?” Dean’s empty hand shot to his mouth, covering it. “No?!” He turned and ran back into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. Charlie heard a yelp of, “Dammit!” and then a quiet uttering of swear words, half drowned out by the sound of glass bottles clinking, and a wooden box snapping shut.
Dean jogged to a halt, feeling a bead of sweat run down his back. Castiel was grinning, holding up the ball. “Out!” he called.
“That was an accident,” Kevin pointed out.
Castiel inclined his head. “True of me, certainly. But I fail to see what’s so terrible about admitting you like eating lettuce and cake.”
“How long you got before your bedtime, church boy?”
“Shuddup, Sammy,” the taller boy said. “Hey, lady?”
Castiel’s eyes widened. The music started in a swoop of strong notes: a wooden flute, followed by a hard and catchy drum rhythm, thudding slow, doubled-up like a heartbeat. Castiel knew the song well, and he knew he and Dean had already missed their cue. Dean was out of his chair and pulling Castiel up too, laughing, his eyes shining with glee behind his mask. The musicians played the intro again flawlessly, giving them time to get to the floor.
planning on wearing it myself tomorrow night, but your need is greater.” She shook her head when Dean tried to interrupt. “Nuh-uh! No arguments. I want you to have it. If you wanna make it fair, I can pinch something outta your closet and wear that.”
The ball shot at Dean and he twisted his arms back to hit it. He felt the ball connect to his bat, and he watched the white dot whizz off towards the Astronomy tower. A dozen elves sprinted after it, and Dean dropped his bat and took off around the diamond. Sand shot up inside his pant legs as he rounded first base, skimming it with his fingers. He reached second base and nearly tripped over it, but the tap of his toe counted as touching it, so he moved on to third base, glancing at Castiel to see what he was doing, only to hear a cheer from the house elves as he was caught out.
Dean shrugged. “Just one. I’m not drunk. You’re not takin’ advantage, promise.”
Dean drew Castiel in for a hug. Castiel squeezed him, skin to skin.
Castiel watched Daniel sweep all the green paper back into his pockets. From his mouth emerged a pink bubble, which grew and grew and grew, then it popped, and he ate it again. Castiel stared, dumbfounded by such a sight.
“Hmm,” Dean said, hands in his pockets, ambling up to Cas. Cas was just pocketing his own key. “This is it, huh. You and me.”
Dean rubbed his hand over his mouth, holding back a sob. A single tear track shone on the side of his face Sam couldn’t see.
“Stooohhp.”
“But hey, maybe I’ll drop in every few sessions,” Dean shrugged. “I wanna be part of the movement whether I’m leading it or not. I wish I had that kind of thing at school, growing up.”
Castiel faced the space, and for the third time, he raised his wand.
Dean’s hair was short now. It had fallen out, drifting to the floor. It slipped under Castiel’s shoe. “Oh,
Sam’s voice echoed through the sparse classroom: “Nothing like that’s happened to me. You’re just a bad teacher.”
! Move your butts! We have a road trip to get underway!”
Sam came into view behind Castiel. He had that supportive-younger-brother look in his eye.
Something was very, very different tonight. Castiel had changed, deep inside. Part of the change felt natural – he’d loved Dean for some time – but this was fearsome, new, and sudden.
Castiel chuckled, resting his cheek against the top of Dean’s head. He breathed in slowly, and Dean imagined he shut his eyes as he breathed out.
“What are you doing?” Castiel asked, as Dean pushed up against him, rocking him.
Castiel felt a flush creep under his cravat. “Years?”
mistakes. Castiel did not act, communicate, or process information in the straightforward ways other people did, in the ways that, to him, looked so effortless. Dean worked with that so-called flaw. And that made all the difference to Castiel.
“Hey, guys,” Charlie smiled. She lifted her hands as Moosh and Baby Batman flew to perch on each hand, and she went to sit next to Dean. “What’s up?”
“Oh!” Castiel felt his heart lift. “So I can eat the meat. But... you’d use the same tongs to turn everything though, wouldn’t you—”
Mariela tutted, casting a cold look in their neighbour’s direction. “Must he really cuss like that? Block your ears, mijo. Help me cut this pie.”
“Dean,” Charlie whispered. “Is this why you said no to Cas? You wanna go in a dress?”
The class giggled and laughed, and the chatter started up again. It wasn’t anxious and strained any more; Castiel smiled, relieved the tension had gone. He was proud of himself for noticing the tension at all – but somehow he seemed to notice a lot more about his emotional environment when Dean was around. When Dean was near, all Castiel’s sensors went mad.
“I... have no opinion,” Castiel said. He blinked. “It’s different, it’s not good or bad. If you like it, I’m glad.”
; wood and plastic absorbs the contaminants. Non-stick pans... not good unless they’re brand new.”
“Oh, it was no trouble,” Castiel said quietly. Too politely.
Dean breathed in the gentle aroma of the place. In all his eleven years living at the school, he’d never been able to determine what it smelled like. Castiel had once brewed up a love potion, Amortentia, and although Dean had picked out select scents at the time – jasmine perfume, warm lipstick, new books, clean bedsheets, engine oil, leather... a certain man’s clothes – the smell of the Fountain Room came across as all of his favourite scents rolled into one. He often wondered if everyone smelled the same thing or whether it was just a coincidence.
Slowly, Sam nodded. He offered a tiny smirk. With a boyish shrug and a quirk in his smile, Sam said, “Go make them an offer.”
Dean kept his eyes shut as the tie swept away.
“They were being
“One misstep and you would’ve been. Left again. Okay, we’re on the cut grass now. Just a few more steps. Aaaand, stop. Are you ready? I can take the blindfold off now.”
Ignoring the ghost, Dean nudged Charlie. “Your turn.”
Dean snorted in amusement. This wasn’t the first time Castiel had tried cooking – last week he’d made
Charlie took Castiel’s hand, patting it. “I’ll get over it. Gilda though...” Charlie tilted her head, looking towards a far corner of the Potions classroom, where fading sunlight illuminated condensed steam. “Professor Moondoor is the sweetest creature on the planet. She’d never hurt me like the rumours said. This would probably scare her off, too! No way she wants everyone thinking she and I are in some kind of abusive relationship. Or that we’re in a relationship at all. Which is a bummer.”
Dean blushed.
“Most owls would overheat out here,” Castiel said. “And Sonoran Desert native owls aren’t well-suited for other climates.”
Castiel tilted his head, baffled by how informal the introduction was. However, his head slowly untilted as he saw the figure rise from the armchair.
“No?”
Dean put a self-conscious hand on his erection. “I skipped my morning whack when I woke up today,” he explained. “Thought I’d save it for the evening. There’s a new
He blushed.

Rinker bowed his head, accepting Dean’s word over his own warning. But Dean couldn’t help but worry now.
Sam emerged from the mass of his cheering team, a huge grin across his face. “We did it!” he shouted, waving to Dean. Dean jogged the last fifty feet, and Sam met him halfway, letting Dean rush to grip him in a bear hug.
No wonder Mariela was mad at him. Dean wasn’t her ideal match for him at
,” he moaned.
So he let himself be pushed, and he pushed in return, breathing like he wanted to bite Cas. Maybe he did. Maybe Cas growled like he was going to bite back if Dean tried.
“You’re distracted,” Rinker said. “If anything’s hot, it’s

“I don’t know,” Sam said truthfully. “Tell me.”
“I can’t do this,” Dean whispered. “I can’t just let you
Sam’s hand slid away, but it waited on the tablecloth, ready to offer comfort if needed.
Castiel skulked back to his safe place by the food table, deciding to try some of the meat. He took salad, too, unwilling to give himself indigestion.
Dean looked down at the ball he held, thumbing its red stitching. “Good question.”
– to be clear about it. Right?”
.” But the anger melted away immediately, and he was left feeling... sad.
“My nose.”
Between all the ice-cream trucks and taco stands dotted throughout the fair, Castiel found the landmark he was looking for. Above a barbecue truck painted with the name
fits me!”
Charlie guessed their conversation was over for now. “I’ll see you at dinner,” she said to Castiel, standing up and Vanishing her armchair.
“Yes we are, Cas,” Dean said cheerfully, making an about turn. “By the riiiight, quick march!”
. Dean Winchester, the boy with flowers on his wand and a potted lily in his bedroom. Dean Winchester, the one who was days away from teaching his first class to help children learn more efficiently. Dean Winchester, the smartest, kindest, most interesting person Castiel had ever had the good fortune of knowing.
Gertrude hugged them all, and she asked how it went. They all spoke at once, and she chuckled.
When the vial was empty, Dean handed it back to Charlie.
Charlie glanced at Castiel, only to find he was already staring at Professor Moseley in confusion.
’ and there was the website emblazoned in black and red, telling him precisely where the catering truck was setting up camp for the weekend, complete with a map.
“Oh,” Castiel breathed as his eyes lighted on the phoenix couple. “I’ve never seen mated phoenixes. Not even in my F.R.O.G. year, when I was researching gestation for my Care of Magical Creatures coursework.” He pressed up to Dean’s side, staring ahead with his eyes shining. “They’re so perfect together, aren’t they?”
Castiel took a breath and read, “‘
When they prepared to exit the Potions room late that evening, Castiel left his potion simmering, and he shut the instruction book in an enchanted box, locked with a password. Dean tried guessing the password in whispers until Castiel caught him and dragged him out of the room by his hand.
Castiel gave a soft, nervous laugh. “I— I think Dean’s possibly a little delirious. He’s never called me... a-anything like that before.”
Bobby was a squib, not a wizard; he relied on potions and rituals and Muggle surgery techniques to heal his patients, although during term time he had help from magic folks. At Jinxes, Dean’s injuries were bandaged up the same way they’d been when he’d lived in Muggle society. Better, though, because Bobby actually cared.
“Eros’ sister,” Charlie suggested. “Or his mother Aphrodite.”
The woman had no pity in her eyes. “There are schools back in Kansas that’ll take mudbloods like you. You should’ve stayed where you were.”
Dean leaned around Charlie, wearing a grin and a sheen of sweat. “Aw, hey, Cas. What’s up?”
Castiel leaned the broom on the truck, then bent to wash his hands. He shook them dry, passing the trio. “Give me one minute, I have something for you. Sam— Please stay, just for a bit.”
Charlie reached the desk’s edge, and she set her knuckles on its top.
Sam wasn’t clued in to the joke, but he sat with the women and all three of them ate quietly, watching to see what Dean and Castiel would do.
Sam threw up his hands and turned away, laughing. Dean knocked a fist after Sam, then looked around at his guests, grinning. He looked all ruffled and relaxed, more comfortable than he had been at the fair. He slung off his apron, tossed it on the back of a wooden dining chair, then re-rolled up his plaid sleeves to the elbows, clapped his hands, and sauntered up to the food.
“Yello?” he said, not recognising the cell number on the screen. Local, but not one from his address book. He glanced around, hearing silence. “Yo, anyone there?”
Dean went to wash later that night and discovered a smudged ring of lipstick around the head of his dick. He laughed in the shower, and explained to the curious Castiel once he got out. Castiel smirked, and held out an arm, inviting Dean to lie with him.
“There’s crazy things happening by themselves all over the world,” Charlie said, spreading out her towel. A black wooden pier struck out long from the beach fifty feet to their left, and children raced back and forth along it, screeching. Charlie watched the kids, then sat down on the towel. “It’s not just the wizards and the witches who get to enjoy everyday magic.”
They battled a snowstorm in the Ozark mountains. They met ponies at a Colorado petting zoo, and they hand-fed goats and rabbits. They lost each other in an outdoor hedge maze, and re-grouped in the centre three hours later, all covered in leaves. They stood on a bridge together and asked a tourist to take a photo, and they squeezed up close so there was no doubt they were all in frame. They got their faces painted at a children’s park. Dean was a tiger, Cas was a butterfly, Charlie was a cat and Sam was a puppy. (Moosh stole a paintbrush from the artist.)
When the hall was packed completely, the house elves opened up the huge front door. It was a strange and magical door: when the students walked out, they seemed to walk into the sky and vanish. But when Dean and Sam walked out, the gravity shifted and their feet landed on hot sand, so hot that Dean felt it through his boots.
“And in doing so, I’m teaching you how to make Calming Draught,” Castiel replied.
“So how did it happen with you and Dean?” Charlie said, leaning in. “How was he?”
“No—” Dean looked truly enlivened, a fluttery grin dancing on the corners of his lips. He was slightly out of breath. “Seriously,” he huffed. “
Castiel cried out in alarm as an extremely wet
Dean beamed at her, chocolate smeared all around his mouth.
Dean tilted his head, frowning. “How did you—?” Castiel had never been able to figure that out before!
Dean hissed as he came, both hands clamped around Castiel’s head, not wanting to let him escape. He spurted warm ejaculate onto the back of Castiel’s tongue, splashing his throat. Castiel tried to cough it out, but Dean was still in his mouth and all he could do was swallow. He gulped, moaning as he did. He gulped again, because Dean was still coming. The suction of Castiel’s gulps seemed to be pulling more semen from him. When Dean shuddered and sank into the mattress, completely spent, only then did Castiel feel the last droplet slide from Dean’s softening cock.
Dean nodded, then patted Castiel’s butt. “C’mon, then, hot stuff. You get the pasta goin’, I’ll wash up and raid the fridge.”
“What is that?” Mary asked. “Sherbet? That’s so
When the song changed, and a faster waltz began to play, Castiel looked up at the clock that hovered above the band. It was Castiel’s own design, the same as the small one in his bedroom, but this one was ten feet across. All the cogs and wheels were displayed proudly, in a testament to the beauty of functional technology.
And even then, he didn’t have a moment spare to think about Sarah’s unanswered question. Professor Moseley got up onto the stage and said a grateful thanks, and then pulled up her parchment to read it.
Dean shrugged. “Didn’t even think about it. Are you— Wait, seriously, who
“Also wrong.”
like you is proving your point.”
Castiel turned around, holding something behind his back. Dean’s words had trailed off, immediately suspicious.
dance unless we’re on a first-name basis.”
Wow. Ellen! Babe! Get over here, this is gonna blow your mind.”
“No—” Dean licked his lips, and he moved his face closer, his right temple pressed to the car. He nosed Castiel’s cheek, and with his eyes closed, Dean whispered, “Tell me how to touch myself. And I’ll do it like you say.”
“Gabriel,” Castiel said sternly. “We were grateful for your help, all those years ago. All of us still are. But quite frankly, I think every teacher employed at this school would have preferred
Castiel laughed, eyes shut, head turned away slightly. Dean chuckled to himself, feeling the heat in his cheeks sear hotter, falling lower in his belly. He let himself move, let his hips sway, lip bitten.
“I... Cas...” Dean touched his mouth, shaking his head. “I don’t know what to say...”
really
He looked like somebody else. If Dean had been born with a twin sister, this would’ve been her face. Dean still had his green eyes and long lashes, his freckles, his pouty pink lips – but he touched his lips and they were soft, like rose petals. His facial hair and all traces of facial hair were gone. Not even a shadow.
Castiel missed again.
Joshua and Missouri locked eyes, as if sharing the same thoughts: why was Charlie bringing this up?
“Where’s he goin’?” Dean asked, amused.
“Puh!” Dean said, running his dusty hand down his face. It was sweltering out here.
Castiel looked up, his eyes shining. “Oh, no... Please, what was it?”
eat first?”
In January of his first F.R.O.G. year, Dean celebrated his seventeenth birthday. It was his second-to-last year at school. Since he and Sam still lived at Jinxes, they were both under the Ministry’s protection – but Dean had come of age: he was allowed to become Sam’s legal guardian. So he did. They had a small party. Sam was thirteen. It was the first time he tasted real alcohol, and Dean made sure it was a safe experience. He was a good brother like that.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” the man said, again darting out of the way of a marching band, complete with spinning batons. He leaned a freckly hand on the tablecloth, then turned to Castiel’s church group, wearing a smile like he had a joke ready, only to see six sets of glaring eyes. He lurched back like the table burned him. “Wow. Okay. You’re gonna sell a lot of cakes like that, aren’t ya.”
Giggles and whispers filled the hall. A few cheers of agreement followed. Then came a smattering of applause, which became a rush of happy voices and more applause – which became a pounding,
He took Dean by the hip and by the hand, and with a shared smile, they began their dance.
Castiel looked over once more, intrigued by the woman in green. He didn’t recognise her at all, which didn’t make sense. Logic said she was Dean, but she wasn’t Dean. Charlie wouldn’t have showed up with a stranger, nor would a stranger have been allowed into the dance at all. They couldn’t have been a student. Whoever they were, they had to be staff, didn’t they?
Castiel smiled too. He carried on letting Dean hold his hand, and carried on admiring the pond, and the sunshine, and the waft of delicious smoke that breezed in this direction every so often. With it came the tang of Dean’s cologne and sweat, and Castiel breathed in.
“But my point is,” Castiel said, getting back to his spoon and digging it into his rice, “as astounding as that was, Dean, you—” He almost grinned. “How do I say this? You’re clearly a genius. Or to be more historically accurate: you
Dean trudged out into the living room, looking to see if there were any dirty plates he’d missed. He discovered only a pastel-yellow tupperware left on the table, and rushed to grab it, glad to see it was just the right size for the kebab pieces.
Charlie came closer and got Dean and Cas to stand in front of the trucks so she could take pictures. The late morning sunlight was just heavenly: dappled and dreamy and drifting with glowing gold dust.
“Here we go,” Dean said. He scanned the area, making sure nobody was watching. He waved his wand, making sure any security cameras would be temporarily short-circuited. He slammed the door of the Impala shut, and he strode out to stand at her nose, a few feet away.
Dean pouted. “Aw. Don’t get all secretive on me now, Cas.” He snuck up to Castiel and hugged his waist from behind, trying to see over his shoulder. Castiel huffed and pressed the book to his chest. Dean grumbled and kissed his neck. “C’mon.”
“He was...” Castiel smiled, gazing at the floor like he was seeing Dean’s face in its fibres. “He was surprisingly submissive,” Castiel frowned, chuckling a little. “He’s a very tender, trusting lover. I honestly expected to be met with more physical dominance, or teasing insults.”
Dean cocked his head and invited Cas to look at the sandwich on the island counter. It was presented with expert artistry: clean white plate, sandwich sliced diagonally, with one triangle propped up against the other. Cream cheese melted out onto the plate, where red speckles of paprika were dusted across the feast. It still steamed a little.
This time, when Dean emerged, the neck of his shirt was wet, but his face seemed its usual colour. His lips were swollen but pink.
“Um,” Sam said, after a while. “Anyway. Thanks for telling me.”
Dean smirked. “Leaf outta their
The students whooped and whistled, cheering for their Principal and the Herbology professor she’d adored for years. Their dark figures swayed together, their clothes bright and the lights around them sparkling. Candles floated down from the ceiling and orbited around them like a slow-motion twister made of flickering yellow and white. Their song was one Castiel recognised, but not one he knew the words to.
Castiel leaned away. “Get back to your lesson, Dean.”
Kevin complained, “This isn’t how pool works.”
Castiel shivered, putting the pillow firmly between his thighs and squeezing. He squeezed so hard he cried out in a breath, mesmerised by the pressure. With every muscle below his waist held stiff, he humped into the pillow; his hands and feet turned weak, his eyes went blind; he arched his back up and he drove himself down, one free hand pushing the pillow harder into himself.
“Do you...” Dean inhaled, blinking a few times. “Do you see me in the picture? Am I with you and your kids?”
“Read some to me,” Charlie said, nudging Castiel’s leg with her boot. Moosh hopped up onto her shoulder, leaving one hand free so she could stroke Baby Batman.
“Are you all right?” Castiel asked quietly, approaching Dean to touch his arm.
And Dean sensed Castiel leave the hospital wing. As soon as he was gone, Dean missed him.
“I got that,” Charlie smiled, thumbing through pages. There were handwritten notes beside the section for each day, notes about Dean’s emotional and physical well-being that day. Charlie’s smile soon vanished, because she realised how few of these notes sounded positive.
When he looked up, he asked, “Am I a bad person?”
“I think,” Dean said, “I wanna do what we came out here to do. Just touch ourselves.”
When Dean and Castiel were almost out of sight, Charlie stopped. She watched them through the haze of water droplets, seeing Castiel move to sit beside Dean on the edge of the fountain. She heard Castiel laugh, and she saw Dean shove his face away, and Castiel bounced back, still laughing. Charlie beamed, always delighted by the sight of her friends acting all goofy around each other.
Sam reached over and patted Castiel’s velvet jacket sleeve. “Hey. You okay?”
And I wrote a bunch of
Dean started to smile. “What do you wonder?”
Castiel smirked, scratching languidly at his unshaven facial hair. “As soon as classes finished this afternoon. That libido-dampening potion I was taking, I told you—” Charlie nodded, Castiel nodded and went on, “I forgot to take it today. Dean noticed, he offered... Or did I ask...?” Castiel shook his head; apparently he wasn’t sure any more. “We both needed relief and privacy. So Dean led me out of the school.”
When Castiel was in his fifth year, he got so sick of everyone existing around him that he stole a broomstick and flew up into the sky, and just hung there for a while. He must’ve floated in that spot for half an hour. He came back sunburned later – that was just what happened to white skin under the Arizona sun.
The spell had worn off between them.
“Dude, chill, I put some proper makeup on,” Dean laughed, taking Castiel’s hands and dragging him into a slow dance. “And Charlie did my hair.”
“Hey!” Dean yelled across the field. “I wasn’t ready!”
Dean hid his face in his hands, hearing himself moan from the other room.
Castiel did as he was told, getting comfortable, his pillow under his head. He watched Dean lick his lips, reaching for his wand. Dean squinted at his wand for a moment, thinking. Then he put a hand on Castiel’s inner thigh, pushing his legs apart.
Dean knew it was weird to start daydreaming about Charlie’s mother’s
“This is for you,” Rinker said, handing over a wrapped sandwich.
like this.”
Dean’s hand slid to hold Castiel’s, and he rocked to the music, a wistful smile on his lips.
Castiel even became friends with Sam Winchester. Sam liked to read books. Castiel liked to read books. They had a great deal in common and therefore found plenty to share. (Dean also liked to read books, but he pretended he didn’t, which took most of the fun out of sharing. How he ever began to thrive as a teacher remained beyond Castiel’s understanding.)
“You’re shy,” Castiel murmured, a laugh in his voice. “I can’t believe you’re shy when you made a song like this.”
Skink pattered off on his bare feet, a gleeful look in his overlarge elfish eyes.
“Five of them got a wisp on their first try, six managed a fully-formed patronus before the end of the lesson,” Sam said seriously. “I’m convinced nearly all of them might manage it before the end of the semester.”
“You oughta start your own club, Cas,” Charlie suggested. “Maintaining Good Mental Health, and the Battle of Not Failing at Life, a weekly seminar by Professor Castiel Goldkeeper.”
Dean hesitated, eyebrows slowly colliding. But Castiel wriggled his thumb enticingly, and Dean supposed he may as well humour him. So he smirked and leaned in, sealing his mouth around Castiel’s thumb.
If you enjoyed this, here! Have more!
Castiel stood awkwardly outside the door, hugging himself.
“Hello,” Castiel said to it.
Castiel lay in bed, staring at the draped cloth over him. His curtains were drawn except on one side, and upon the nightstand there, a candle glowed in flickers. A small flowering cactus sat in a pot beside the candle, and on the floor beside the nightstand was Moosh’s bird cage. Castiel had transfigured the cage to a far larger size once he got his private quarters, three whole years ago. At the moment, Moosh was sound asleep in her nest.
“I don’t!” Dean cried, angrily folding up his students’ work. “Except—” He glared at the ceiling and slapped the roll of papers into his palm. “Except I do. Okay? It gets on my nerves that we stop teaching math when the kids are accepted to Jinxes, or Durmstrang, or Hogwarts, or whatever magical school they go to. I’ve got kids who can’t count past a hundred, they’ve got no grasp of fractions, and it’s no
“Um. Nnnot... the worst. But.”
“You make it sound like it’s badass.”
“Take slow, measured breaths,” Gertrude nodded. “And if there’s someone else around, and you feel okay socialising, ask them to help.” Her eyes moved to Dean, then to Sam. “Ask what he needs, and if he just wants to be left alone, leave him be.”
“Should try it,” Dean said, getting into the car. He reached across the seats and unlocked Cas’ door, and Castiel got in and sat beside him.
“Cute,” Dean said firmly. “They’re adorable.”
Dean swallowed. He got back to filing his nails, head bowed so Sam couldn’t his face.
Dean patted his brother’s back. “Apology accepted, little brother.”
“See,” Moseley went on, “I was a young woman when I was hired here. Only just graduated from college. This was my first real job; I only ever met students before. But then I came here, and
“Lick me,” Dean pleaded. “I— I want your tongue...”
Dean smirked, and he pushed off from the desk. “Yee-haw.”
Dean slowly and carefully slipped off his stool, and Castiel’s eyes drew down. Dean hadn’t been kidding – a massive, thick bulge had appeared along the base of Dean’s belt, trapped there with no way to escape. To Castiel it looked like a sausage too big for anyone to eat. He blushed at the thought, now cursed to think about putting it in his mouth. Sucking through the fabric, making it wet.
Philipe, please sit down, this is not Show-And-Tell. You can show Jason your... whatever that is. Show him later. Please. Thank you.”
in love.
Dean felt a smirk tick up his shivering lips. “Heh,” he said.
“We kissed.” Castiel looked up, smiling widely at Charlie. “We kissed until it got so cold I couldn’t feel my toes.” He hugged himself, fingers of one hand rubbing his bicep. “Then we got dressed. Dean was...
Castiel huffed, kissing Dean’s cheek. “Okay.”
“My hair’s fine, Dean,” Sam said. He rounded his shoulders, knocking Dean’s prying hand away.
“But you’re good at Quidditch,” Dean said, watching a third ball whoosh right past Castiel’s shoulder.
“Hm. Gluten sticks firmly, especially in little crevices and textures. I only use metal utensils when cooking for
Castiel moved his hands towards Dean’s waist, but Dean broke the kiss and turned away.
“Thanks,” Dean said, pulling back. “But, uh... I think I figured it out.”
“I’m almost at a breakthrough!” Castiel said, pushing his wild, dark hair out of his eyes. His eyebrows were drawn together near-permanently, his cheeks were flushed, and he kept shaking his head and turning book pages back and forth.
Dean groaned as his teeth sank into a dense crisp-edged wad of deliciousness, cool-warm cheese and tender red meat and smoke and the slick-slide-crunch of fresh lettuce all filling his mouth just the way he liked it. He moaned again, eyes shut. He chewed slowly, working the textures over his grateful tongue.
Castiel caught Daniel’s eye, and he shook his head in warning.
Cas truly was the wizard of Dean’s dreams.
Was this fate? A sign from God?
Dean offered an awkward smile. “I dunno.”
“Right now?” Dean leaned forward. “Can I do the Calming Draught again? I was
“What about you?” Gertrude asked, nodding to Dean. “How was your time without a wand?”
Dean licked the groove between Castiel’s thigh and perineum, and Castiel shuddered, tipping his hips up into the warmth of Dean’s mouth.
This was what people called fucking, he realised. He was fucking his pillow.
his vulva against Castiel’s cock. He didn’t penetrate himself, as the angle was wrong, but Castiel felt a flush of heat under both of their skin.
“I think you got it,” Dean said. “For the most part.”
Dean gave Castiel a slow look and a sideways grin. “Wasn’t rude. Was honest. Thanks for that, by the way. The cleaning.”
The classroom echoed with laughs of delight and joy. For a while, when everyone else was busy watching the animals, Dean watched Castiel. And he watched Charlie, and he watched Sam. God help him, he even looked at Gabriel once or twice. The sight of their smiles just filled Dean up with glee, warm and shining inside his heart.
They needed parents in their lives, Sam thought. Until now, Dean had been Sam’s parent. But now Sam felt like Dean was losing it, and Sam had become the sensible one.
Dean gasped and stuttered but he turned his face, mouthing to Castiel’s forehead: “Aside from my dick?” Dean humped, filling his hand. “Nipples.”
The smoke came pouring out thicker and hotter as the afternoon ticked on. The heat of the sun was known to soften icing, but with each eddy of wind, the cloying, breath-stealing heat of the barbecue wafted into Castiel’s face, and he saw the cakes truly begin to suffer. He began swapping them in and out of the mini-fridge, trying to save them.
Dean reached off the bed and uttered a quiet, “Accio wand.” It landed in his palm, straight from the pocket of his discarded robe. With his wand he cleaned up the mess on his own skin, then he did the same for Castiel, before lifting the wand to Castiel’s nose and tapping him once. Castiel blinked, then smiled, now clean.
The new teacher was tall and lanky, had a mop of brown hair that came part-way to his shoulders, and he was dressed in jeans and a blue plaid shirt. An utterance of surprised recognition went around the room.
you?” the woman yelped from the barbecue truck, leaning out of the opening when she saw the lumberjack. Her short red hair was tucked under her black cowboy hat but tufted out over her ears. “You were meant to help us set up an hour ago!”
embrace the idea of this potion, if a truly functional version ever came into being. But he didn’t like to imagine what kind of future that would bring. For him or for Cas... it seemed nothing but bleak.

Dean smiled up at Castiel. Oddly, he was pleased to feel this vulnerable, lying there beneath Castiel’s silhouette. “Nobody knows what to make of you,” Dean said softly. “Can’t tell if you really like me or you just stick around ‘cause
“Call me Gilda,” Professor Moondoor said. “I’m sorry to hear that, Castiel. If I’m to be your date for tonight, I have to warn you, I absolutely do
“You’re not gonna hold off a few more minutes?”
He recoiled slowly, immediately worried he knew exactly what was happening. “Dean...”
“No, it’s just food,” Castiel smiled. “I followed a recipe book.”
He looked between watching eyes, expecting to be bombarded by questions. But Charlie just stroked his hand, and uttered, “Go on.”
“Oh, you beauty,” Dean groaned, pasting himself to the Impala’s side. He kissed her roof, basking in the warmth that reflected off the metal. “You have no idea how badly I wish you weren’t a rental.”
Castiel flicked his eyes to the ceiling. “Pathetic.” He bent, drew a breath, and snapped the tip to the white orb. Three balls hit the pockets – and ricocheted away, smacking all the rest along the way. Castiel stood back, frustrated – but tensed at the last second, seeing a red ball rolling towards an end pocket, moving painfully slow. He heard gasps all around, including his own...
“You’re upset,” Castiel said, resting on the edge of the desk, just in front of Dean.
“Hey, you’ll get back to it,” Sam said, clapping Castiel on the back. “Give it a few months. Settle in here. It’s not like there’s a shortage of marking
Dean covered his face with his hands. “No-no-no-
“Alright,” Castiel said, then cleared his throat. “This one’s from Saskia. She’s a sixth-year now—”
Charlie entered first, and Castiel followed. Castiel felt Dean sweep in after him, closing the door behind them. All the other teachers were here, and the room rumbled with small talk.
Unshared kisses aside, Dean hadn’t realised until now how badly he’d just wanted to
They passed Professor Rufus Turner’s room and Bobby Singer’s next. Dean’s new room –
They slept together every night. Every weekday they taught their lessons, and after class they’d spend their time in the Potions classroom.
Soon enough the troupe took themselves into the kitchens, entering single-file through the driver’s door of the barbecue truck.
,” Dean said again, pointedly. “She’s got a crush on you.”
“You’re not wrong,” the woman said, plucking out her cigarette and leaning over the glass table separating her and the boy. Slowly, she blew smoke in his face. He didn’t even flinch, or look at all surprised. Perhaps he was used to having smoke blown in his face.
“That sounds exciting,” Castiel said.
. We have enough for the wheelchair ramps now, you should be proud.”
Castiel drew a breath, sliding his hands from his lap to the burnt sides of the desk. He held on, as if stabilising himself. “I was given up for adoption,” he said, eyes flicking to Dean, then away again. “I was five. As you know, the world was chaotic back then. Voldemort was still gaining power and Death Eaters were everywhere; wizards were forced into hiding. Of course, even once the war was over, nobody wanted to adopt me. I grew up under the protection of the Ministry, and over that time I was told repeatedly... whenever I asked, I was told my parents were pureblood, a high-profile witch and wizard. Famous, I think. I like to think they were a great Potions master and a celebrated Arithmancer. And that’s why I love potions like I do, and numbers.”
like to know. I’ve been dead for two hundred years, I’m not giving up that secret now.”
Castiel reached Dean, and he looked every bit as rumpled as he did from afar. His tan was exquisite, and the darkness of his skin made his blue eyes look nothing short of ravishing. He looked at Dean sweetly. “I was told you wanted to teach me something.”
Castiel smiled, and the corners of his eyes crinkled up. “No,” he said softly.
and right now I’m mostly writing
Dean shifted forward an inch in his chair, wanting to be closer to Castiel. “I want to understand too,” he said. “I didn’t know autism was all of that, I thought it was... angry children. I don’t know. Unresponsive, obsessive kids. Or— Or like Rain Man. In that movie.”
“I— Well...” Castiel felt himself heating up, and he ran a cool hand against the back of his neck, eyes on Dean’s hands. Dean fiddled with a lavender stem. The stroke of his thumb, back and forth, back of forth... To Castiel in his present state, it seemed obscene.
“None of your business,” Castiel said with a smile. “Carry on with your lesson, Dean. If you make Calming Draught correctly I’ll give it to Bobby to give to the students.”
Dean shook his head. “Not if I go slow. But you gotta relax. And trust me.”
Castiel wet his lips with his tongue, unable to look at Dean. “I’ve helped a lot of children in my time at the school. I’ve seen them grow from lost sheep into complete people, and I’ve done my part to assist in that transformation. There’s nothing more rewarding than that.”
Dean grinned, and explained, “I figured it out the other day. I figured out how the fountain works. It makes wishes come true.”
Castiel was folding a cravat, expressionless.
“It’s okay,” Charlie said softly.
“Shh-shh,” Dean warned, turning around to check the open door of the classroom. Face flushed, eyes shining, he looked back to Castiel. “Keep your voice down.”
“Professor Bradbury is taken,” Gilda said stoically. “Perhaps you’re right about a crush, but I’m not going to poke my nose in where I’m not wanted.”
They were quiet for a while, their shoulders pushing together. After half a minute, their breaths synchronised.
He nodded, glad to see some relieved faces.
your dramatic sobbing,” Gabriel smirked, winking at Dean. “For the sake of present company. Wouldn’t want to
“What’s the timer for?” Dean asked.
“I told you I don’t understand your Muggle temperatures,” Castiel said carelessly, turning another page of his book. “I came out here because it’s quiet. You’re preventing it from being quiet and I don’t appreciate that.”
“Like, all wrapped in the, the.” Dean waved his hands openly around his waist. “Toga thing? Loincloth. Topless? I dunno. Just. Okay, that’s weird. Forget I said it.” He laughed breathily, head down, deep wrinkles skewing the freckles beside his eyes. “My, uh, gaydar’s not so good. Took me forever to realise
They stopped at a garden centre with glass walls and a glass ceiling, and Castiel walked around the whole place twice, then returned to the fountains with Dean, pulling him by his hand. “Look,” he said. “This one has a phoenix in it.”
Dean hesitated, then touched his mouth.
I had to spend my weekends marking, I’d be the richest teacher around.” He smirked, enjoying the nervous chuckle that echoed through the hall. Then he stretched out his pinkie. “And last but not least, Charms. All the stuff I couldn’t fit into this year’s syllabus.” He dropped his open hand, slapping it against his thigh. “It’s gonna be awesome. And since you’re all here, I figure we may as well jump right into our first lesson.
. I thought you meant green pesto. Like,
sake get out of my face and do your
“Okay, good, you’re not dead,” Charlie said. She went to the fridge and opened it to look in. “Since when do you let
Then Castiel laughed.
Dean leaned back.
Castiel – that was his name, right? – looked impassive for a moment, then his expression tightened as he took offence. “Perhaps you’re right,” he said. “There is something wrong with me. I thought you might be wiser than you looked. How quickly
“So what do you suggest, Dean?!” Castiel asked, a incensed kind of focus in his eyes. “What could be
“Come on yourself,” Castiel uttered, his demand electric in Dean’s mind. “All over yourself.”
Castiel eyed him curiously. “What do you mean?”
“When you breathed out,” Dean smiled. “You didn’t feel it, huh?”
Castiel tilted his head, perplexed. “You haven’t eaten any...? Why?”
Slowly, Castiel dropped off the hood of the car, shoes on the dust. He took Dean by the hips and pulled him closer, so Dean’s legs lay open around Castiel’s crotch. Dean had never felt so vulnerable – yet he was not unprotected. Far from it, in fact. He felt safe like this. He smiled, tilting his head playfully at Castiel.
“It’s funny when you realise there’s another eighteen of those letters,” Dean chuckled, lifting up a pile of fancy parchments he’d been keeping beside him. “Going by these, you’d think Cas was the hottest teacher on the planet.”
A moan fell from his lips as he sped up his brutal thrusts. He snarled, one hand reaching out to grip the headboard of his bed. It began to shake as he moved, hitting the wall –
The classroom quietened down a bit, and the students slowed to listen.
room – was some way down.
“But what did you say about me and Dean?”
“Oh, those. Hey, I’ve heard of ‘em, just never made ‘em. Wouldn’t know how. I could look it up if—”
“You never realised someone could love you for those same things?”
Feeling sullen, Dean gave Sam one last hug. “Take care, little brother.”
“I thought all Muggle-borns knew about this stuff,” Castiel said, looking carefully at Dean when he pulled up a chair.
“So’s your dick,” Charlie said, eyebrows raised. “Your panties are all loose.”
“Sure?” Charlie asked. Castiel, Dean and Sam looked around themselves, checking nothing was missing. They nodded one by one, and Charlie smiled. “Okay. Everyone grab my hands, and hold on tight.”
With a polite smile, Sam moved on to nod to another student with their hand up. But he couldn’t help but overhear the whisper Skyking gave his neighbour, “
Dean set a hand to his head, breathing out. “You know what, let’s just go. The Muggles can have the real one. I’ll park the fake somewhere nobody’ll ever see it again. It’ll vanish in a couple hours and we can pretend this never happened.”
“I’m sorry about the timing,” Charlie said, glancing at the carriage clock on Moseley's desk. It was almost nine o’clock. “This couldn’t wait.”
Dean wanted to shake his head. But he nodded. He smiled. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he lied.
“My college fund?”
He counted the house numbers on the mailboxes, then realised he’d overshot, and reversed back twenty feet, twisting to look over his shoulder.
Dean grinned, shaking his head. “I just guess. It’s done when it smells right, when it feels right.”
Likewise: a little extra goodness did Dean many favours, Castiel had said on several occasions. And Dean couldn’t disagree, not after abstaining from swear words for a week and feeling inexplicably shiny inside. In contrast, the shadows of Cas’ personality may have been an acquired taste for many, yet for Dean, such a zest could only be improved by adding more. Castiel no longer blushed and panicked when he swore now, which Dean considered great progress.
Charlie smiled. “‘Course. Why do you think I haven’t worked my ass off trying to find you a perfect make-Dean-look-feminine charm? Because I knew Cas was already doing a potion, that’s why.”
, Cas. And my boyfriend won’t even sell anything that saw an egg once. That’s not even
In the past, whenever Dean was too hot because he’d been out in the sun for hours, and he stepped barefoot into a shady room with smooth tiles under him, that relief was one of the best feelings in the world for him. But in Jinstem house, that feeling never went away. The relief and satisfaction was constant. Dean was always convinced it was impossible to breathe as easily as he did down there.
“Doesn’t your girlfriend want to dance?” she asked.
Dean shrugged. “A man’s gotta have
Dean sat beside Charlie, and when Sam came up behind them, Dean waved a beer at his knee. Sam took the bottle, and sighed as he sat down. He wore a flowered shirt and a pair of black sunglasses, and his hair was too long.
“It’s not about gossip, it’s about happiness! Personal satisfaction!”
Dean pressed his lips into an arch. “Dunno. Why do you never catch the ball when it’s in the outfield?”
Turning away, she led the group to her trusty Nimbus 2011, which floated three feet off the ground. She patted it. “Most of you will know one end of a broom from the other. But for those of you who don’t—” She poked the bristly end, “This goes behind you. It’s your tail. Front end is your nose. Hands go here.”
He turned around, pretending he didn’t care as much as he did. He wandered between the rows of black desks, looming over every student he passed. He came to the desk of Skyking, and he towered over him, eyes dark and furious.
He’d come out here ready to throw himself into something new, into
Dean stood beside him, smiling genuinely when Castiel glanced his way. But Dean was still so stunned by Castiel’s words that he completely missed the next ball that Skink threw, and the next thing Dean knew, Castiel’s bat was flying at his head and then there was a thump—
“Hey, I don’t make the animal, I just conjure it,” Sam said smugly. “What’s your Patronus, anyway?”
The light was soft in here, coming from a single lampshade beside the double bed. The lilac bed covers looked comfortable – not new, but lived-in – and the comforter was folded back. A library book rested on top, with a cat-shaped bookmark sticking out.
Dean grinned, waiting outside the Potions classroom door, listening to Castiel finishing up his lesson, doling out homework. He spoke clearly and confidently, and Dean would never forget the days he’d had to teach Castiel how to project his voice. He’d come so far since then.
Dean laughed, folding back against the table, hands supporting himself from behind. He grinned at Castiel, shaking his head. “You’re hopeless at Muggle stuff, man. Jeez.”
Castiel lifted Dean’s hand to kiss the back of it. “Okay.”
Castiel felt his heart skip upward in his chest. “You did research!” he exclaimed, with genuine warmth bleeding into his voice. “
All at once, Castiel realised the first moment he’d ever met Dean. Hollywood and Vine. August 14th, 2004.
He dipped a finger into the bright bubbling mixture, and he lifted it to his mouth, sucking the thick gloop from his fingertip. He narrowed his eyes, peering at a point at the far end of his darkened classroom. “Hm,” he said. “Perhaps not.”
Dean licked his lips, sitting up properly. He turned to look at Castiel, admiring the way the sun bounced off the sand and reflected against Castiel’s tanned face, making his eyes gleam like perfect blue gemstones. The skin below his eyes was hanging lower these days, and his face was wider than it had been in the past. Dean smiled, shaking his head. “It’s nothin’ really. I was just thinking about that song. Precious moments.”
Dean came along and asked what they were talking about. Sam told him, and Dean guffawed. He joked. He always joked about that stuff, because he liked to think he knew everything there was to know about sex. Then he peered over their shoulders – and, slowly, the laugh went out of him.
“Castiel,” the man said back, and for a moment Dean wondered if he’d been insulted in Spanish. Responding to Dean’s blank look, the man clarified: “It’s my name.”
“Castiel,” Castiel corrected. Then he opened his mouth, thinking. “No,” he said. “You go.”
“Does that... make you feel bad?” Castiel asked.
Castiel’s eyeline followed the rope bridge that led from the Astronomy tower to the edge of the quarry, then kept to the side for two hundred feet before it met a balcony and disappeared inside the middle of the red clay cliff. From there, there were stairs inside which led down to the main part of the castle.
learning.”
Before Dean was expecting it, Castiel grabbed him and threw him to the bed, making Dean yelp, then giggle as his breasts sank into him, their fatty tissue distributed across his chest. Castiel sighed, kissing Dean’s neck, then his collarbone, then his breasts.
Dean pushed his lips together acceptingly. “Sounds like a plan.” He hopped off his stool, collecting his waistcoat from where he’d been sitting, and he slipped it on, leaving it undone. He breathed in, realising he could smell leftover jasmine perfume on his clothes. It was gone in a moment; he hoped Castiel wouldn’t smell it.
“Batting in baseball is essentially the same,” Dean tried. “Look at it this way: the bat is a long wooden arm. You gotta catch the ball. That’s all.”
