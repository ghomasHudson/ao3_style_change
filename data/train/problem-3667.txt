Cas looked at the human he loved so well, tears shimmering in his eyes because he knew exactly what Dean was asking and why.
“Waffles and coffee for my friend.  And do me a favor? Could you move us to a quiet booth at the back, he and I need to have a private conversation.”
He watched him for a long time, probably longer than he should have or needed to, but he was loath to disturb Dean from his relaxed state. The man was incredibly responsive and Castiel felt like he had already been able to read and determine a number of his tells and triggers. Having him as a sub was going to be a pleasure for both of them, the only pity being that this was a professional relationship and not a personal one. Castiel would have to guard his heart, he had a feeling he might lose it if he didn’t.
“The hit on me is not only because I disobeyed orders. I refused to kill you and then neutralized the agent they sent in my stead, that was enough to sign my own death warrant. Since I had nothing to lose, I defected.”
“No, thanks, Jody, I’m fine. Just tell me where the reservoir is, I want to be there when…. I just need to be there.” Somehow, he’d managed to put a little steel back in his voice. Jody would know he wasn’t going to budge.
“Nope. What else should I know?”
Dean chuckled, Cas was a damn grump in the morning. At least until he had a coffee – or three. Becoming fully human had turned him into a serious caffeine addict, at least where mornings were concerned. Cas squeezed Dean a little more firmly and gave him a sleepy kiss over his heart.
Cas was the last person he wanted to see, and also the only one he wanted to see. His hands itched and he grabbed the bag again, going through the motions. He knew what was going to happen the next time he saw Cas, and it terrified him. Despite everything, Sam had called him out on the truth of things. He did have feelings for Cas. Big, gay for his angel feelings, or in his case, bisexual ones. He’d had them for years, but only admitted it to himself when he had prepped Cas’s body and built his funeral pyre. But nobody needed to know that then, and nobody needed to know that now. Angels weren’t human, they didn’t have romantic relationships. Cas certainly had never said or done anything to show otherwise. In fact, he just proved the opposite by leaving him behind. There was a brief time when Jack and Mary were still alive and everyone was happy and together, that he might have considered both coming out and telling Cas how he’d felt. But Dean Winchester wasn’t one to bare his soul only to see it get trampled. His choice had always been to keep his best friend over the risk of losing him by trying to force something that wasn’t reciprocated.
“Did you get the shot you needed for the press release?” He looked at the redhead.
*A:  Castiel, old friend. It is good to see you.
“OK Cas, let’s try again.  About everything…”  Sip of coffee and a deep breath.  He reached across the table and rested his hand on top of Cas’s, while he stared back at him intently, waiting. “About everything…”
Dean turned his head to answer him and stopped cold, Cas watched the other man’s eyes rake over him. Sam watched his brother who was seemingly at a loss for words, and Charlie dropped the pen in her hand and spoke what the three were likely all thinking.
Their conversation comes to a halt, but Cas doesn’t mind. He needs to concentrate. Once he has determined Dean is glass-free, he disinfects and bandages his hands. “All good, baby,” he declares, kissing Dean’s cheek. “Have you given any thought to our food? Are we cooking pasta?”
Both men were sprawled out on the large brown reclining sofa. It had been a splurge when shopping for furniture, and it had only arrived today but was already proving itself to be a worthy investment.  With padding in all of the right places, they rested while taking in the sight of unopened boxes as far as the eye could see.
“Great Sammy, I’m starved.” Fuck.
“In a manner of speaking, it is.”
“Answer it on speakerphone, and trust me this time.” Cas looked at him and decided it wouldn’t make anything worse and maybe an audience would make it easier. He answered the call.
“I know Cas, I’ll see the counselor with Sam so we can both figure out our shit.  It’s my job to not drink, but promise me you’ll be there if I ask for help?”
“OK Cas.”
“Yeah, I know Cas, but we’ll fix it up eventually.  It’ll be better than the bunker, promise.”
“So good for me.” He reluctantly took his hand back and picked up the glass of sparkling ice water. “Now, let’s see you have a drink. I want you to close your eyes and feel the cool sensation all the way down.”
When an answer still isn’t forthcoming he places the box on the kitchen table before quickly throwing out the ruined food and rinsing the pan. The extractor fan has nearly made short work of the smoke so Cas turns it off then opens the window to air out the smell, too.
“Do you really want to know?”
Naomi sputtered briefly but dug her heels in. Tossing out a fresh barb Dean’s way.
Castiel hadn’t asked that as a question, he’d asked enough already. His little compatibility test seemed to have shifted into something more, but that was just fine with him. He reached for his phone, using one app to dim the lights down, and then another to start an ASMR playlist of light rain and wind. Not too loud, just enough to block out all other distractions save for their voices. Closing his phone and putting it down, he drew the plate and glass over. He started with a slice of green apple in his left hand.
More silence.
“My services are
Dean felt like a dick. He was blowing it, big time.
“Crowley. Crowley gave me your card.”
“I’m in no position to judge you. At times, on days like today, I’m reminded that I’m little better than a high-priced hooker, and that does not do well for the self-esteem. I get it. But Dean, you need to promise me, for as long as I am with you, that you’ll come to me when you feel this way. Let me help, we can find ways to ease things, together.” Cas’ piercing blue eyes searched and held Dean’s, unwilling to relent until he was acknowledged.
“Yeah, well, you don’t have any. Pass your notes off to someone else and tell Sherriff Howdy you’ve been reassigned.”
“Thanks, come on in.” After he ushered the three of them inside, he continued. “Benny, Jack, we need you to stay for a while, there’s probably going to be another errand.” He looked directly at Castiel and held out his hand. “I’m Sam Winchester, Dean’s brother...and lawyer. I wish I could say that it’s a pleasure to meet you, but it’s not.”
“Charlie, get your camera ready.” Cas stepped up to Dean, projecting that same sense of assuredness he’d used with Dean when they had first met. Dean, for his part, stood in place, green eyes focused only on him as he waited for whatever Cas was going to do next.
Crowley was a pain in the ass, but he was also his best referrer of clients, he’d put himself most of the way through grad school based on those referrals alone. If this one pans out, his last semester’s tuition before graduation would be covered.
“But did you like him?”
“Thank you, Dean. That’s perfect.” Cas smiled and took a sip while Dean nursed his own drink beside him. They had stationed themselves off to one side but not so out of the way that they couldn’t interact with other guests. “Do you see anyone that you know?”
“Good. Now go into our room and clear out one drawer and part of your closet for my things. Then I want you to go and have a shower, long enough to relax some of the tension in your neck and shoulders. Stay there until I join you.”
Cas walked down to the end where everyone else was and took the stool a few places over from John. His back was to the window, but he didn’t want to see what was happening out there anyway, it was too much to ask.  John was the predator he was protecting Dean from tonight. He made sure that he sat close enough to John to converse casually and was easy listening distance from the table as well.   The bartender placed a slightly too warm bottle of domestic beer in front of him and he took an easy sip, looking like that was the only reason he had to be there.
“I started following your career after I had to research and write a paper on police reform, you’ve been making waves for a while. If we hadn’t met in the manner that we did, I was eventually going to reach out to your team directly to see if I could help. Well, until you become a client. I never mix my worlds.”
“Alright, Cas. I’m all in, I promise. No matter what you’ve got hiding behind door number three, I’ll stick with it.”
“Okay? Afraid that the house is bugged?”
As they stepped out onto the sidewalk, a series of fire engines sped past. Sirens blaring, they were headed in the direction of Dean’s apartment building. Black smoke billowed into the sky directly over Dean’s neighborhood. There was no point in even trying, he’d been made and his building was up in flames. He looked at Cas.
Turning his hands upward in supplication, Dean shrugs and replies, "It's a classic. Besides, you're my Smalls."
“Yes Bobby, thank you. Not sure I deserve it, given the circumstances that brought me here but thank you all the same.”
“If anyone else besides you were asking, I’d get out of the car right now. You’re hiding something.”
“...whenever we were fighting, and I was being an ass.”
“OK Sammy, for you. If you trust them, I’ll go.”  Deflated and exhausted, he had no more fight left.
Castiel’s heart hurt, it wasn’t supposed to be this way.
Sam watched the standoff between Dean and the waitress. She grabbed a menu off the next table and handed it to Dean. They shot dirty looks at each other the whole time because giving Dean a salad was apparently a grave offense, as was complaining about it.
“Nothing I like better than putting uppity people in their place. The pleasure was all mine.” The older man pulled himself up from the table and indicated he was heading towards the door. “I gotta head out, Charlie set up that camera of yours to take a group shot of the five of us for posterity. I got a boatload of work waiting at the office, and it’s not going to finish itself.”
Once again Sam was contemplating things over a cup of coffee.
“What are the ingredients?”
“What? Oh, yeah, ‘course.” Dean got up and left for the kitchen; Castiel started to read.
“Love you.”
“I told you that you shouldn’t be here. What can’t you leave me the hell alone?”
“Wait! I almost forgot.”  Cas jumped up and ran over to the oven pulling out a plate.  Looking pleased with himself he grabbed a fork on the way by and walked the plate over, setting it down on the table in front of Dean.
“That’s not true Cas. Dean still needs you.  He will always need you.”
“Thanks Dean, but I want to stick around. I’m worried about Cas; I think maybe he’s depressed or going through something.”
If you were to ask Dean about it, he would have blushed and given you a half-smile and then told you that Cas was his everything and that he didn’t know it could feel that way.  But if you asked Cas though, he would have brightened and grinned his widest, most gummy smile while shooting heart eyes towards Dean. Then he would have told you that it in all of his eternity, he’d never been so happy.
Dressed in running gear, he stepped off of his porch and headed right towards the end of the street. The trail entrance to Glover Archbold Park was there and connected to a myriad of other running trails that he could take on his morning run without having to deal with traffic. It was always quiet and he loved running in solitude, just him and his thoughts.
French:
“Dean, I…” Cas’s eyes were wide but he was speechless.
Cas looked down at their joined hands and then over at Dean, giving him that same smug half-smile he’d been giving him for the past two weeks. He was holding his own beer and looked Dean in the eye, not breaking his gaze while he licked his lips and took a long pull off the bottle.
Sam had pretty much sequestered himself in the library since they’d returned from Rowena’s, which suited Dean just fine. He’d been holed up in his room trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with him. At this point, he couldn’t trust himself to go anywhere until he had a handle on things.
Cas’ answer was a teasing groan. “Hurry up, I’ve got plans that require us getting into bed before we pass out from exhaustion.”
It had been a long time since he had prayed to Cas, couldn’t even remember the last time. He’d said his powers were fading, but he hoped it worked. It had to work. Dean leaned his head back against the headrest and used both hands to brush tears he hadn’t even realized were falling away from the corners of his eyes. He sniffled and took a breath to steady his voice.
“I love you too Dean.”
Heavy-hearted, but also feeling a bit better, Dean ran a hand over his face and sat on the edge of the bed waiting for the addled by sleep feeling to clear. He came here to find the manuscript. If Cas had taken it, this was the only place it could be.  Looking around the room again, he searched for the old tome.  It was not obviously on display anywhere.  Maybe one of the drawers?  Reaching over he opened the bedside table to find an old Walkman and a copy of National Geographic magazine with the cover article being about bees.  Fucking bees, Dean smiled and remembered the time Cas had appeared ON his car, covered in them.  The weirdo had always been fascinated by them.  Picking up the Walkman, he placed the headphones on and hit play.  It wasn’t a surprise to hear Zepplin, stopping the music and opening the cassette slot he confirmed that this was the mixtape he’d made for him.  Dean smiled again and wiped a stray tear.  This at least was a good memory.
“Yeah, that was my fault, and I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.”  He swallowed and looked down at the table for a moment, ordering his words for the next part.
“Is there anything else you’d like, Dean?” Cas could be a smug bastard when he knew he was winning the power dynamic, but that’s why Dean liked him so much the first time they’d met. His smile let him know that he knew exactly what Dean wasn’t saying, and that just made Dean want him more.
“You’ll see. Finish your coffee, shower, dress casual but nice, maybe some green to bring out your eyes.”
“It’s too late to back out. I can see it on your face, Dean.” Cas put a hand on his shoulder as though he was trying to calm him down. Not that it was going to work. “It’s going to be fine, I promise. We’ll get through this together.”
“What the hell is this?”
Doing his best to break the tension, he had jokingly asked Dean and Cas if they were going to take advantage of their “more profound bond” and shut him out of hunting trips moving forward. To say that went over like a lead balloon was an understatement. Cas had put his fork down and stood up from the table.
“What am I missing here Cas? Is it April Fools Day? Are you and Sam playing a joke on me?”
“That’s probably more generous than I deserve. Thank you.”
“Fuck.” Dean dropped to the ground, his knees hitting the asphalt with enough force that there’d be bruises tomorrow. He wasn’t consciously aware of that though, at the moment all he was aware of was the fact that his nose was bleeding everywhere and was probably broken. The white-hot pain along with the force of the punch had him seeing stars. Cas hadn’t held back.
“So, movie?” Castiel suggests, pulling his sleeves down from where he had them rolled at his elbows.
“Yes, right now. I need to know where to look.”
And this, right here. This is it. Dean, as carefree as he can be these days, dancing and cooking with him, laughing and bumping into each other, making a mess and not caring about it. It’s almost like his old Dean is back. The Dean from before the incident.
“You’re not a high-priced hooker.”
She laughed out loud. Apparently, Cas had won her over.
Cas closed his eyes briefly, another tear rolling down his cheek while Dean studied his face looking for the answers to questions he didn’t know how to ask. He rested his forehead against Cas’s and drew in a breath.
“No, you know I’m going to do it. So, tell me Sam.  I’d rather bring back Cas and risk it than live another forty years without him, ok?  I know you know that. Somewhere you had to have known my end game was always Cas or nothing. Maybe I wasn’t smart enough to figure out how to say it out loud, but it true. You can have a good life with Eileen, I can see it. And I know you want out, so take the out man, I’m giving it to you. You don’t need your depressed big brother playing third wheel in the background for the rest of your life.  I don’t want to drag you down and I don’t particularly want to die on a milk run because there’s nothing else waiting for me.  This is what I want Sam, the only thing. Let me have it, alright?  Worst case scenario, you get baby and name your first kid after me, best case scenario is we both get a happily ever after and I get out of your too-long hair.”
What better way to end the year than with a little bit of introspection?
“Cas isn’t returning my calls or answering my texts. Do you think he will eventually?”
Cas smiled back, reached across the bed, and squeezed Dean’s hand.  There was no tension in his expression and the look of adoration shining in his eyes had Dean second-guessing his decision to leave the room. “I will make the coffee and something to eat, you get cleaned up.”
“Okay? Well, Charlie and I have to get this release out. We’re getting swamped with media requests. You good to go?”
He would have lunged for Crowley right then and there but Cas cut through the haze of anger by reaching his arm around him, pulling him close, and tapping him three times on the shoulder. That got his attention.
Cas didn’t move and was still lying on the bed when Dean turned back to look at him.  He looked damn fine in the rumpled blue flannel and grey shirt that he’d stolen from Dean’s closet.  Ignoring the draw to check out his hips and legs, Dean shifted his eyes up to meet Cas’s deep blue ones.  He wasn’t sure if he was seeing amusement or concern, probably a mixture of both. Cas didn’t say anything and just waited for whatever Dean was going to say next.
“Other….couples?”
“Were you planning to kill yourself last night Dean?”
“Remember how I said Phil’s place shared the wall? I heard all of it Cas and it was awful.  He broke in the door and started screaming: ‘Get your fucking faggot hand’s off my son!’ I could hear furniture being thrown, and then I heard Dean yell back ‘Dad no it’s not like that, let me explain.’ And uh, that’s when I heard him turn on Dean. He hit him, and I mean he hit him hard enough that I heard it through a wall. And not just once.”
“Left it for me? More like cursed it, right, Sam? I mean, let’s tell it like it is. She cursed the candy, I ate it, now I’m cursed. Does that about cover it?” Crossing his arms, Dean waited expectantly for Sam to be more forthcoming. When he wasn’t, he pressed on. “What’s the catch? Can you lift it? Surely you found something in those books.”
. Embarrassing is what it was. His hair might be soft, and his skin might be the most hydrated it’s been in a decade, but having Sam
Dean leans over the table, straightening Castiel's cutlery when the smoke alarm starts blaring. Startling him, he elbows the new vase, up-ending it and sending it sliding off the table. He's already most of the way into the kitchen, however, when he hears it hit the wooden floor and smash.
“Second to that, I’m telling both of you now, that I’m all in and I expect both of you to treat me that way.” He paused to look directly across the table to catch Dean’s gaze before he continued. ” Dean may not remember, but last night he told me that he loved me. It’ll probably be a while before he can tell me sober. That’s fine, I can wait, but from now on I’m Dean’s significant other, next of kin, partner, whatever you want to call it. But it’s me. Is that going to be a problem?” Cas wanted to add that Sam now had some margin to start building the life he wanted with Eileen, but he didn’t, knowing Dean would take it wrong, thinking he was an obligation to be managed.  Everything else though, he wanted to be crystal clear.  This was the only way he could think to reach Dean and help Sam at the same time.
“Dean, they’re no good without the spells to use them. We bring the books for the library.”
“Promise me, Dean. Knowing you, you’ve been awake all night. Promise me you’ll get a little sleep first before you get on the roads. And that you won’t interfere with their work. I’ll tell them you are a consultant, otherwise I can’t get you access. But you can’t interfere with their process.”
“You done? I only came here for the free lunch, and I’m getting hungry.” Bobby’s drawl brought them both back to reality. Reluctantly he let Dean go and stepped back. Covering his sudden sense of vulnerability, he focused on Charlie.
He shakes his head and is already planning how to tease Dean for forgetting something he spends several minutes every morning ensuring Castiel remembers and decides that with no way of knowing when Dean’ll be back, he might as well take a shower.
Out of nowhere, a large black SUV ran up onto the sidewalk bisecting the entire width and separating Castiel from the two runners that had followed him. He turned to watch as the passenger window slid down to reveal a young man with light brown hair. He was holding a gun and it was clearly aimed at the man standing beside the panel van.
Crowley shot Adler a cold smile that went nowhere near his eyes. “Toodooloo.”
He mindlessly tapped his fingers to the beat of the music coming through on the radio, the background noise was soothing and helped him focus- something he had learned after years of traveling in the impala.  He needed a solid strategy, he wanted it to work out with himself and Dean. Even if it didn’t, Sam needed things to be better.  Cas felt genuinely guilty about that, he owed it to Sam to at least help Dean break the unhealthy patterns that were weighing him down.
____________________________________________________________________________________
He desperately hoped Cas could hear him, that it wasn’t too late. He continued, because there was so much more to say.
“I am sorry Sam, I did not mean to hurt your feelings.  That is not what I meant.”
Cas hugged him back. ‘It’s good to see you Sam.”  He didn’t comment on anything else.
“Castiel.” More of a groan than a word, but it felt so good. He couldn’t stay silent.
They fell into a conversation about everything they had seen at Rowena’s, which items they wanted to go back for first, and why. There was a little bit of negotiating back and forth, Sam was focused on the books and Dean saw value in getting the objects and paraphernalia out first.
He's done, absolutely had enough. Dean's tired and honestly would rather be curled up in bed before he has to deal with the potential fallout of Castiel finding that their anniversary is ruined beyond repair.
There had been six men in the building and Dean killed every single one of them. Viciously and painfully.  Cas hadn’t been able to do much more than watch and try to keep out of the blood spray; some dark wound had been triggered in Dean and he tried to exorcise it with his fists and his blade.  If he had tried to intervene, Cas wasn’t so sure Dean even would have heard him.
“You are exquisite in every discernable way, Dean.” He lowered himself to his knees behind Dean, ignoring the water on the floor. His sharp intake of breath let Dean know that he’d found the rest of his scars.
Cas travels back in time to intervene.
“Just yes or no, please. These ones here, you did yourself?”
“Dean,” Cas says, his surprise giving way to worry when the only reaction he gets is his husband drawing his clasped hands closer to his chest; Cas only catches a glimpse of something dark oozing out under his left hand before they’re hidden against Dean’s chest.
“Sure is,” Bobby answered. “Cas here was just marking his territory, metaphorically speaking.”
The smell of smoke as he opens the front door is unpleasant but hardly worrisome, just like the lack of answer when he calls out his husband’s name in greeting doesn’t cause his smile to wane. Castiel toes off his shoes, hangs his bag on the rack, then steps through the door to the empty kitchen.
Shit. Sam lowered the letter and looked at Dean. He could feel the muscle on his right cheek twitch from clenching his jaw. Did he tell Dean, who was stupidly still eating the candy, or did he go with the flow to see what Rowena had set in motion? God, what he wouldn’t give to see his brother and Cas get over their drama and get on with the fact they were crazy about each other. When they weren’t fighting, it was sexual tension. Correction, make that
Cas studied his sad soggy meal for another few moments.  “How long are you planning to be away for Sam?”
“You’ve done your homework, Michael. I’m very impressed.”  Dean didn’t need to know that Castiel knew who he was, so he called him by his pseudonym. Again with the slight blush, Castiel could not wait to get into a full scene with him. “We are almost done there, and then we will have one more thing to do, which I suspect you will enjoy very much. Alright?”
Reluctantly, their time was up. Castiel turned off the sound and raised the lights just enough to rouse Dean.  He ran his right hand across his shoulders being careful to avoid the scars for now.
“Charlie? Oh yeah, she’s got skills. MIT doesn’t give out PhDs for nothing.”
They cleared the end of the tall rows that had been blocking some of their vision. The laneway opened into a larger gravel parking area that had about a half dozen cars and pick-up trucks parked. From their new vantage, Dean could see a small bonfire and about a dozen people circling it between the barn and the house. Shitty music was playing on an outdoor speaker. That told him that the dozen or so people were teenagers.
“That’s right, and I will. Finally, the test of the house rules. Our scenes will last for two hours and will include aftercare, I expect you to do any homework I give you, I do not stay overnight - that’s non-negotiable, and if I learn that you are being dishonest with me at any time our sessions will be permanently terminated - I won’t have my time wasted. Lastly, if we run into each other in public, I will not acknowledge you and expect the same of you. Understood?”
“Your mouth, Castiel.”
Cas was apparently done with Dean’s shit.
“Would you be more comfortable if we used James the whole time, then?”
“Hello, Dean.”
He was speechless for a moment, God how he had missed those blue eyes.
Dean fell to his knees, right in the middle of the parking lot.
His heart swells at the thought of Dean looking for instructions on how to make them, him swearing and raging when the napkins tear and crumble in his hands, the way he throws them away after hours of them refusing to bend to his will and storms off in frustration. How he’ll come back not five minutes later, determined, and not move until he gets the folds sharp and precise enough for the napkin to keep form, how he keeps going until it looks just like it had at the restaurant they’d met at all those years ago.
The question was almost irrelevant as the words nearly made him come on the spot.
“Cas, I know that you don’t need to sleep. But, would you…I mean maybe just for today…would you get in bed with me? And be there…while I sleep?” So that was a little embarrassing to ask, but he hoped.
“Honestly?  I wanted to kill him, but I settled for some broken ribs and instilling enough fear to make him urinate.”
“You catch on quick, love.” Crowley downed the last of his Scotch. “Adler likes puppy play.”
“Cas?”
“As soon as he was gone, Dean started to cry.  I never heard him cry, ever, and I didn’t know what to do so I just stayed in my bed.  At some point, I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew it was morning and Dean was telling me to wake up.  He told me that it was time to pack up and move on, dad had gone out to get some breakfast for us to eat on the road.  His face was unrecognizable it was so swollen, and his arm was in a sling, all he said was that dad had come and got him to help take down a straggler overnight but he’d been jumped. I knew he was lying but I went along with it.  When dad came to get us, he gave me the room key and told me to run it back to the office.  When I got there Phil was behind the counter, but he didn’t look much better than Dean.  He didn’t say anything, he just took the key and I left.”
Cas grabs the box, since he doesn’t want Dean to see it before he’s ready to give it to him, and leaves the kitchen behind.
Dean looked at Cas long and hard, who seemed to be both enjoying this strange conversation and ignoring whatever waves of discomfort that were being thrown his way.  Then his eyes widened and his mouth dropped open.
He actually didn’t know what he meant so he just sat still and listened.
Dean, unfortunately, was standing stiff, and that just wouldn’t do for press photos.
He made one long cut across his palm and watched the blood flow into the bowl mixing with the rest of the contents.  The blood and grace mixed together and flowed around the feather and tape in a clockwise motion although he hadn’t stirred anything.  The liquid seemed to pick the iridescence off of the feather when it came into contact and swirled into a shimmering fluid that expanded within the bowl, absorbing Dean’s blood as it fell.  The edges where it came into contact with the bowl glowed with the same blue that lit up Castiel’s eyes when he was fully charged and ready to smite. His heart skipped a beat, it had to be working.
4:37, the phone rang. Dean grabbed it from the bedside table and sat up. The caller ID indicated that it was Jody and his heart lurched in his chest. Please let it be good news, he offered up in one more silent prayer. Please let it be good news.
“Sam! What did you do?” Dean wanted answers, and he wanted them now.
The other two were silent and waited for Cas to continue.
Cas leaned his head back to wash the shampoo away, sighing when it felt like the tension was washing away with it and swirling down the drain.  Dean grabbed the bar of soap and lathered up his front, starting at the neck and working down his chest, across to his armpits, back to his belly, and finally down to his cock which had been soft right up until Dean had wrapped a soapy hand around it.  Giving it a few slippery strokes while it quickly plumped up in his hand, he gave Cas a wink and a cheeky grin before letting him go and spinning him around to wash his back. He kissed the nape of his neck and chuckled.
“That.” The taller brother stood and walked to the door, quickly confirming the identity of the visitor and opening it. A gruff-looking angry bear of a man entered, older with a salt and pepper beard and a commanding presence. Skipping any niceties, he walked right in and let his displeasure be known.
“Oh.” A few seconds pause. “Oh.” Compassion and relief flooded through Sam; everything was going to be ok. Dean’s cheeks burned red with embarrasment. Sam put him out of his misery, but maybe not without having a little fun with it first.
It was early, too damn early for his phone to be ringing. Last night had been yet another committee meeting that had run long and left him stressed and tired. He just wanted to go back to sleep for a few more hours and follow it up with coffee and pancakes. Was that too much to ask? Eyes half-closed he grabbed his phone and silenced the ring, sending it to voicemail.
“And I am fairly certain that what Dean requires is something he will only find with you.”
Cas’ fierce blue eyes were still holding him in place, and Dean was happy to stay there all night if that’s what he wanted. If he were being honest with himself, he’d probably agree to anything Cas asked right now. If tonight had gone well, it was because Cas had made it so. It didn’t really matter what Cas said, Dean knew that he’d finally found the piece that had been missing. Professionally, and personally.
Cas held his hands still, showing no signs of letting go.  Dean didn’t mind really.  It gave him something to anchor to.
“Dean, you can’t embarrass us more than that news article did. This is damage control. It will be fine.”
“Holy shit Cas.”
“Oh, they did. Cameras captured everything I was told. There were also witnesses...including me.” He gritted his teeth and powered through the memory. “The only problem was that my rich conservative family had the police department and the local media in their pockets. They had the investigation and the story buried so fast it was like Jimmy had never even existed. I got a copy of the video and went to both the police and the media to try and force the issue but my family shut everything down and threatened to disown me if I persisted. That was the day I walked away.”
“Likely story.” Dean didn’t buy it for a second.
Dean might be bisexual, but that was a conversation he’d never had with Castiel. It certainly wasn’t something he’d advertised anywhere. His going along with this was a pretty big assumption on Cas’ part, but at least now he understood the other man’s reluctance.
“Love you Cas.”
Dean panicked. He knew that this was the moment where he was going to betray himself. He felt it in his gut. He had no clue what his expression was, but as he walked towards Cas, he could see the unconcealed fury on the angel’s face. This would be no gentle reunion, yet still, he moved forward. He couldn't do otherwise.
The movement had been fast enough, and the push hard enough to knock the wind out of the unsuspecting angel and he gaped at Dean, speechless, trying to comprehend what the hell was going on. Dean, for his part, had lost the thin veneer of control he’d thought he had. He hadn’t ever had any control at all, he was lost.
After what felt like an eternity, the door opened. Dean was so relieved; he didn’t notice the resignation on Cas’s face.
“So, here’s the plan, I’m going to go back out there and get everyone’s attention. Say a few words of welcome, and then call you out together to explain the rest.  Then you’ll say a little something, and after that, we can have ourselves a wedding.  Sound good?”
What did Dean even say to that? Surely Sam thought this was a ridiculous plan.
“He knew, Dean. On some level, he had to have known.”
Neither of them saw the silent conversation flowing between Sam and Charlie. Two was company, four was definitely a crowd, and they were feeling it.
Coffee poured, orders taken, quiet table - it was time to talk.
Cas was smiling. Dean could see tiny lines of fatigue around his eyes and wondered exactly how long he’d been on the road in the last twenty-four hours.
Cas took Dean’s glass and put both of them down on the small patio table. Lithely, he moved directly into Dean’s personal space and took hold of his shoulders. Fierce blue eyes pinned him in place.
Nervous, but maybe also a little brave, he had one more thing to say. If he’d learned anything from this damn spell, he’d learned that holding back bit him in the ass anyway. Dean decided to go all in.
“I don’t know what I was expecting after everything, but honest to god Cas, I am so damn tired, and I want out.  I want to stop hunting, I want to marry Eileen, I want to have the life we fought for everyone to have.  I’m tired of killing, and I’m tired of being afraid.  I just want out.  I’m terrified that Dean or I are going to get killed on a stupid random hunt now that Chuck isn’t pulling the puppet strings. And I can’t leave Dean like this, but I also can’t watch him self destruct into an early grave either. I need your help Cas. I need you to stay…..please?”
“Bobby, I’m really sorry to have let you down. I…”
“Okay, so it’s like a magical truth serum, which means what exactly?”
“Your government is trying to kill you, Dean. What is the difference?”
“Different how?”
“Fuck, no. That’s horrific. They did that to their own kids and let the murderers walk? So nobody would know your brother was killed outside a gay bar?”
“No one will notice if you do it well.” Cas was confident they could pull it off. Hopefully, that confidence was contagious.
Cas and Dean have a special visitor for Father's Day.
Pure panic coursed through his veins, followed by a sense of dread.  Oh god, what did he do last night? What did they do? Not that he didn’t want to, he did, he so did, but not like this, not when he was too drunk to even remember it. “Cas, did we, uh did anything, I mean I had a lot to drink after you left, did uh anything happen that maybe I might want to know about?”
Dean leaned forward and kissed him again. He wanted so many things right now. He wanted to kiss Cas until he made up for a decade of yearning and miscommunication. He wanted to peel off that baggy tan trench coat and the ridiculous number of layers beneath it. He wanted to lean Cas back on the bed to caress every bit of skin he’d ever wondered about touching. He wanted to trace the lines of Cas’s Enochian tattoo with open-mouthed kisses and show the angel exactly what he meant to him.
It was an awful lot of unknowns, but so worth the risk.  Dean was bone-weary with grief and he was done with it all.
"Fuck." The exasperation leaves him loudly, echoing above the extractor fan doing its best to clear the smoke from dinner. "No onions then," he mumbles to himself. He tosses the pan in the sink.
“You got a name picked out for him yet?”
“Yes.” Dean looked down avoiding everyone’s eyes and focused on Cas’s hand holding his, the hand that had barely let go of him all day.
That caught Cas off guard. “You have nothing to worry about Dean.”
“Dean, you don’t mean that. Why did you come all this way and then follow me if that were true?”
Dean wasn’t sure exactly how long he sat on the floor, back leaning against the bed, but it was long enough for the afternoon sun to wane.  The shadows it cast lengthened, and it wouldn’t be long before they disappeared with the sunset.  His muscles were getting stiff, he was too old to sit on the hard floor for hours at a time if he didn’t have to.
Without the slightest bit of fanfare, the best-looking man Cas had ever seen waltzed out of his store and out of his life. The interaction had ended well, but he still needed that break. He quickly paid for his now personalized copy of the calendar and hurried over to the door to lock it. He stuck a sign to the window saying ‘back in 15 minutes’, grabbed his calendar and the now ice-cold coffee, and headed to the backroom to collect himself.
He has about ten minutes before Castiel walks through the door.
Without saying a word, Sam took the carafe,  poured Cas a coffee and then topped up his own.  Almost deliberately slow he added a bit of cream and stirred thoughtfully.  Castiel did the same thing, not even bothering to try to make small talk, he kept his eyes averted from Sam as well.  Everything about his body language indicated both defeat, and an expectation that he was going to be on the receiving end of whatever was coming next.  A little bit of Sam’s ire dispersed, this was going to be a conversation that impacted all three of their futures and Sam didn’t want to make whatever this was, worse.
All of Dean’s red flags popped back up. There was clearly a lot more going on than Cas had said. A lot. He didn’t like entering into any situation without knowing all of the details, and Cas was keeping him in the dark about something pretty big.
“I’m just a grease monkey wannabe from Kansas, as soon as they figure that out here, I’m going to be out on my ass. If it wasn’t for our little game tonight, I would have broken Adler’s nose and we’d be packing for home right now.”
Stomach twisting into knots, Dean tries to put it out of his mind for a moment, turning back to the onions, now blackened and stuck to the bottom of the frying pan.
“Tell me?  He didn’t tell me a thing.” Now Castiel was looking confused, maybe he misunderstood what Sam was saying. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not true.”
It had been three days since the videocall with Sam where Dean had agreed to a number of things, including the alcohol withdrawal he was going through now.  As tough as that conversation had been, the 24 hours after that had been worse.  Dean being, well, Dean had hidden just how bad his drinking had become-which was saying something because everyone knew it was bad.  As the alcohol cleared his system the first day and overnight his symptoms got progressively worse- no sleep the first night, headache, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, and anxiety.  Cas could literally see Dean coming undone and wished, not for the first time, that his grace had been strong enough to heal.  But it wasn’t, it was barely keeping him energized and well.
“There are four rules I would like you to follow this evening. First, we’ll be scening, so I want you to call me Castiel. Second, I will only be drinking club soda and lime tonight, it’s your job to make sure I have a drink the entire evening outside of the performance. Without my having to ask. Third, you will stay to my right at all times. And fourth, if you are talking to someone and I tap you three times, you must immediately draw me into the conversation.”
Dean looked down again, his brother was enjoying this too much.
Dean for anything.
Sam came back into the room holding two coffee mugs, followed by Charlie who was carrying her own. She’d purposely left her purple unicorn rainbow mug here for when she visited. But the playful ‘What’s up bitches?’ in the quote bubble spoken by the unicorn didn’t match Charlie’s actual expression. She was still pissed, and rightly so if Dean were to be honest.
Dean was into Halloween.  Like, really into Halloween. Cas had no idea.
Sam was up and out of the booth in three seconds flat. He brushed past Sarah and stopped only briefly.
They say that your life passes in front of your eyes before you die. Cas didn’t know if that was true, but he did think about Jimmy again. About how he must have felt just before he died. Was it like this, he wondered. And then he thought about trusting green eyes surrounded by a sprinkling of freckles and felt a sense of regret for what would never be.
Wedding rings and a nicely tailored suit for Castiel were ordered from a local store and Jack was tasked to run out and pick them up, adding a stop for two matching boutonnieres to make it all look official. When he returned, Castiel took the suit - charcoal like the one Dean would be wearing and grabbed everything else he would need from his boxes. Heading off for his own shower, Dean was finally alone with his brother and Charlie.
“Mmmmm, thank you, Dean. I believe that I am awake now. What did you want to discuss?”
“Don’t ever eat the last piece of bacon.” Sam offered.
Dean looked at him for a long moment. Frankly, he was too tired to care.
In the next moment, he would have given anything for the floor to open up and swallow him whole. It was Mr. July. Shit. He looked at the merchandise in front of him, calendar, open to the seventh month, those green eyes currently looking at him both from the calendar and from the man standing behind him. Shit, Shit. Shit. Death could just take him right now.
“I’m fully committed, Dean. Can’t be any more committed than I am right now.”
“And if I just resign and we go home?”
“No, I haven’t, James.”
*C: Благодарю, господин Орлов. Надеюсь, наши дороги еще пересекутся в будущем. (Thank you, Mr ambassador/Mr Orlov. I hope our paths will cross again in the future.)
By now Sam had walked around to stand in front of the chairs which was strategic in that both men were essentially trapped while Sam towered over them.  “Cas, I am so incredibly happy to see you. I never thought I would ever get to again. So, while I agree with you that what Dean did was dangerous and stupid, I’m also glad it worked.  And Cas, if you had seen the way Dean grieved when we thought you were gone for good, you’d maybe cut him a little bit of slack. He was shattered, and you did that to him.”
Dean sighed, he might as well be honest.  “I fell into a bottle of Jack Daniels.”
Watching Dean now, two days later and back in their room at the bunker, Cas couldn’t resist the urge to reach out and brush his check while he slept.  Despite everything Cas had said and done, taking responsibility to get Dean from there to here, advocating at the hospital, and starting to set up healthy boundaries with Sam, he still considered being right here, right now, with Dean, a minor miracle.  It had been so long and so hard to get here, and now it was like a switch had flipped and everything changed.
His greatest fear had always been that of being left alone. It had caused him to forge a codependent relationship with Sam and had kept him emotionally shunted off from just about everyone else for most of his adult life. Adult being a subjective term since he never actually got to be a kid.  He can re-write that now, any and all of it.
“Just let me finish ok?”
They were both quiet for a long time, neither really sure of what to say. Cas sat in sorrow for his brother and Dean kept vigil.
“Dean, ‘Flight of the Bumblebee’ is notoriously hard to play on the violin. On trombone, it should be almost impossible. The chromatic runs of sixteenth notes require a great deal technical ability.”
They ate in silence for a little bit, not awkward, but pensive.  Cas was a perpetually patient angel and Dean figured it was always going to be up to him to break the ice for conversations like this.
“Seriously, this is amazing.”
“Cas, what’s going on?”
“That’s my good boy, now it’s time for your reward.” He let go of his chin and moved over into the chair while Dean stayed in the perfect form for ‘present’. “I’m going to turn down the light a little bit more and play some soothing sounds on the stereo. After that, all you will have to do is relax while I take care of you.”
Dean thought.
He got up from the table a half-second ahead of Dean and intercepted the man mid-stride.
“We, Dean, we. You have to get used to that.” The intensity in Cas’ voice as he underscored the point catches Dean’s attention. There is something in it that Dean doesn’t quite understand. “We have to convince people without question. This is more than a routine cover that is over in two weeks, this is your real life now. You must get used to ‘we’ and ‘our’.  And no, it is not an island, but close. It’s one of the reasons why I chose the area. It is only accessed by a ferry and bridges.”
“Ok, we get it, Obi-wan, this is our only hope. What is it?” Dean didn’t like where this was heading, but he definitely needed Charlie to spit it out.
When the four of them had burst into the old industrial building, they had thought that they were breaking up the command center of a humans-for-food trafficking ring run by shapeshifters.  It was bad intel, but maybe not unfortunate.  What they did find was human trafficking alright, but not for food. No monsters either, it was run by humans, one of whom, apparently was trafficking his own kids to the highest bidder online.  When Dean had burst through the door marked “studio”, he found two boys, no more than 12, cowering on the floor.   Standing over them was a large man undoing his own belt buckle for God knows what while one of the boys was crying “Dad, please no.” Dean saw red and lost it.  Completely lost it.
“I’m feeling a little out of sorts…? I’m thinking maybe you do too?”
“Sammy? What are you doing here?” His voice cracked at the sight of his brother.
“Cas, look at me.” He looked back up.
Dean squeezed his hand in a reassuring gesture and looked at Cas with compassion and kindness. Two things he’d rarely experienced from his own family.
Cas held Dean’s hand and stood beside him on the landing, waiting for Dean to move forward into the bunker, or at least speak.
“Like I’d let you go through this alone. I left as soon as I could. Called Jody on the way.” He searched Dean’s face and looked down to catch the duffle in Dean’s hand, piecing together that he’d been about to leave. Looking back into his brother’s eyes, he took on a questioning expression. “Have you heard anything?”
“Alright Cas, I found your letter.  I don’t know what you’ve got here, but….uh…thanks.”  Make no mistake, Dean considered whatever this was to be a gift, and he was going to treasure it.  Because this was all he’d ever get to have.
Adler forgot about them and turned his attention towards Crowley, apparently seeing him as a worthier opponent.
“Cas.”
There was no such thing as a gift from this man.
Cas flipped his hand over, laced his fingers with Dean’s, and squeezed back.
“I’m not sorry to hear that.” He gently massaged Dean’s scalp with his fingers, willing the kneeling man to relax and trust him. “Am I going to find other scars on your beautiful body when we start scening together?”
“Dean. Let’s think about it overnight and talk tomorrow.”
Thankfully – thankfully Cas had insisted that they accept him as Dean’s partner the day before because once they got to the reception desk in emergency Cas had simply owned the role.  No questions asked by staff and poor Sam was the one left in the waiting room initially and doing coffee runs when Cas absolutely refused to leave Dean’s side or let go of his hand.
“Not really, a few, but other than Crowley, no one I’ve ever had a conversation with. You? See any of your… ah... former acquaintances?” It was probably more awkward for Cas than it was for him, especially if he had been paid to dom anyone here at some point in his past. He sipped his whiskey and pushed down a wave of jealousy. He couldn’t fault Cas for doing what Dean himself had been willing to pay him for. Although he vowed to himself that he’d never treat Cas that way in the future.
“It’s about our dad.”
“It’s complicated.”
“You have to relax, Dean.” He whispered, the camera clicked and Cas thought it probably would look like he was speaking endearments. “I need you to let go and just be with me, ok? I’ll take care of the rest.”
*C: Es ist eine Ehre, Sie endlich zu treffen, Botschafter Niebrandt. Ich hatte das Vergnügen, Sie bei einer Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltung der Stiftung Deutsche Krebshilfe kennenzulernen, welche von der Botschaft ausgerichtet wurde. I war außerordentlich beeindruckt von der Art und Weise, mit der Ihr Land sich dem Kampf gegen Krebs in all seinen Manifestationen widmet.  (It is an honor to finally meet you, Ambassador Niebrandt. I had the pleasure to meet you at a charity event organized by the German Cancer Aid Foundation, which was hosted by the embassy. I have been extremely impressed with the way your country is devoting itself to the fight against cancer in all of its manifestations.)
“It went on for a long time and I was just paralyzed in my bed, I was so scared of my dad and so scared that he was going to kill him, and then I heard, uh, I ah heard Dean beg him to stop, he, ah, Cas, I heard him beg dad to not kill him. Then it got really quiet until dad came back to our room, dragging Dean.  I pretended to be asleep, but I heard him throw him on the bed and told him clear as anything: ‘Next time I’ll finish the job.’ And then he walked out the door and drove off in the car.”
“Honestly, I think I kinda did. I was looking forward to seeing him again..sounds kind of weird under the circumstances, but we...um...connected, I think.” Dean was talking but Sam had looked down to answer a text on his phone. Damage control probably.
“Dean please look at me.” Dean lifts his gaze. “You deserve to be loved; you deserve to be happy.”
“So, the mighty Dean Winchester has finally fallen. After a dozen years and the longest slow burn in history, it’s about damn time. I’ll be out of here in ten minutes.”
The call ended, they continued driving down the quiet highway for another twenty minutes when Dean saw what he hoped would be his saving grace. A large billboard announcing the last food, gas, and rest stop for the next hundred miles. He had to pull off, Baby wouldn’t make it that far, he wouldn’t be able to deny himself that, and maybe, finally, he could let Cas go.
But he wrapped his arms tightly around Cas’ body and pulled himself closer. He wouldn’t be letting go any time soon.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about Dean. Just heading back to my research. Good talk!”
“It’s more than ok. Just let me know when you’d like to meet again. I’m going into my office now to email you some material to read before our next time. You can let yourself out when you are ready.” It struck him that he wanted to touch the man once more before he left, but he didn’t have an excuse and it wasn’t how he usually ran things. Resolved, he threw his shoulders back and gave him his most professional smile. “I am genuinely looking forward to our next time together.”
“Hello.” He had a likable, innocent face. What was he even doing with a gun?
(See the end of the chapter for
*A: Thank you. I was very surprised to see you in the papers this week. It’s not like you to be so public with your business. I don’t believe what they’re saying about you being a prostitute, but I will say that you and your new husband make a formidable couple. Should quell the rumors and turn DC on its head. Good for you.
Again, Cas takes point.
“Did you learn all of the positions from the link I sent you? If so, move into ‘wait up’ and I’ll tell you.”
Now Dean really was speechless; he felt a prickly sensation in the back of his eyes. Cas had just demonstrated more kindness and consideration towards him than just about anyone else in his previous forty-three years. It felt good and hurt at the same time.
“No, Castiel.” He swallowed nervously because hell yes!
“Color?” Dean’s eyes darted back to Cas, he had thought for sure they were done.
“Gone?”
The conversation with Sam had been emotionally draining, and both of the men were relieved when it was over.  Important, yes, but also brutally raw.  Cas wasn’t sure yet how he felt about Sam’s story of John beating Dean so severely, but he wasn’t surprised.  At least it helped him understand some of the barriers Dean had erected around himself.  It also explained Dean’s deep need to be in control, and the trust issues kept his anxiety in check without resolution.  No one can hurt you if you don’t let anyone in. After years of abuse Dean always found a way to be in charge and never let someone have that power over him again.
“Sammy, you doing okay after visiting Rowena’s?”
“I’ll just bet you’re getting requests,” he said dryly. “Let’s get this show on the road. You boys ready?” Dean checked Cas one more time in his periphery and swallowed nervously.
Dean didn’t know who the fuck Castiel Novak was, but the photo of the man entering and leaving the condo was definitely ‘James’. And fuck, wasn’t this a damn shame because he liked James. Really liked James, like they had some kind of connection or bond that he couldn’t put his finger on. They’d only met that once, but he’d been looking forward to seeing him again in the worst way. Dom for hire or not, James had gotten under his skin and the itch hadn’t left.
Dean desperately wanted that to be true, but the gap between hearing and believing was so very large. He thought he would have been out of tears given the emotional rollercoaster he’d been on over the past week, but he was not.  They coursed freely down both cheeks, a healing balm this time that somehow watered hope deep in his heart.
Cas had just offered him both his friendship, and a place to belong. He’d used the word ‘home’; Dean hadn’t had anything close to one of those since he hugged Bobby goodbye and headed out the door for basic training over twenty years ago. He had doubted that he’d ever get to have one again. Dean was still wary and had way more questions than answers. Cas was right about his alternatives though, it wasn’t much of a life, but it was his. And he wasn’t keen to spend the rest of it alone and running.
“Yeah, I’m sure, Cas left me a note.”
Dean really didn’t like that word, but he was already committed.
“Found what? The manuscript? I thought you were on a road trip, how did you…?”
“Mmmm, everything okay?” Sam nodded and watched for Dean’s response to his question. He was rewarded with a slight frown for his troubles.
“If it’s about my back, I’d rather not talk about it...James.” He answered gruffly and had tacked his name on at the end, as an afterthought. He was rattled.
“I did, Castiel. I memorized all of them.” Jackpot! Any flagging his dick might have done during their conversation was instantly reversed. He’d done his homework, alright. Dean spread his feet apart and crossed his wrists over his head.
“Ok, rings and vows. Dean?”
“You have a vineyard?”
“Yeah, brother. It was serious now too. If we hadn’t been there when we were...well let’s jus’ say whoever the other team was, they were playin’ for keeps.” Dean nodded, acknowledging what he’d heard but his eyes didn’t leave the man next to him. Castiel met his gaze and held it, both men commiserating silently over the gravity of their shared situation. That alone seemed to quell the anger in Dean’s belly, replacing it with a sense of protectiveness he hadn’t felt since he and Sam had been on their own.
Rodriguez."
Dean opened the door, the fact that he was nervous apparent in his expression. She swept her eyes down his body and back up again only to whistle quietly.
The next slice of apple was drizzled with a little bit of honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. He drew it forward.
“Yes, Castiel.” Dean did his best to relax and let him continue.
“How did you get my number, Naomi?” He might as well start on the offense.
“What about my agent? Is there a problem? I assume you are being fully cooperative with our investigation, sheriff?” The best defense with these small-town sheriffs was always a good offense.
“Dean is my universe Sam.  This is it for me.  I literally watched Pangea separate and the world as you know it form.  All of it, every experience in my very long life pulling me forward to here, finally, to your brother.  I want you to experience the same, to have the freedom to follow your heart, but you can’t do that if you are tied to Dean 24 hours a day.  Trust me Sam, I’m trying to help.  I think that both of you will be able to have healthier relationships with each other and with Eileen and myself if you both create a little bit of...space for them to grow.”
Dean kept him on the phone. Long enough to get the exact location of the Gas ’N Sip, which was mercifully only about twenty minutes down the road, and then a little longer while Sam drove. Long enough for waves of relief to wash over him. Long enough for Dean to start to believe in second chances.
January
When Cas had died, what he had said to Dean just before, it had broken him. Thinking about it now still brought him to tears. What could have been, what he wished he had said, the unbearable loss, and the knowledge that it was too late had tormented him until Cas had walked back through the bunker door. Relief, joy, and hope had washed over him all at the same time, and he had run to Cas to welcome him home, to make it right, to tell him that he felt the same way, that he loved him. And then Sam showed up.
Opening the door, Dean stepped forward with Cas still staying close behind.
“Hold on, I’m not done Dean. Just a few more things.”
“No, I mean it. I don’t want you here.” Dean easily saw the hurt on Cas's face. It was surprising to think it had been possible to hurt his friend any more than he already had.
Dean’s dick was in, 100% ‘up’ for the challenge.
“It’s open, c’mon in.” The door cracked and a head full of tousled raven hair and blue eyes peeked around the door, and lower, a hand carrying a single mug of steaming coffee.
From the booth Sam surveyed the rest of the diner.  True to her word Sarah was right in saying they would be left undisturbed.  She was busy working at the other end of the dining room, although she did catch his eye briefly with a questioning look to see if he needed something.  He half smiled back and shook his head.  There was still space to talk, they had covered the dark stuff and maybe it was time to dig a little deeper into the vault to help Cas understand.
“They both died. In fact, the bond was so strong that they realized it was life-limiting.  No angel ever survived the other’s death- not that it happened very often, but from a military perspective, it wasn’t helpful to lose two angels instead of one.  That’s why I don’t think you and Cas have already bonded this way, you’d have died together years ago.”
He rubbed his hand over the fabric and smiled softly, again indulging his imagination, wondering what it would have been like to curl up under it on a cool night, Cas draped along and over his body.  He sat on the edge of the bed and then laid back, allowing himself to enjoy that fantasy just a little longer. It took a deep breath and stretch on his shoulder muscles that were stiff from the drive to realize that this bed felt very familiar.
“This is a two bedroom condo, but the second bedroom is my workout room.” He felt almost sheepish saying it, but it was the truth. “I don’t have a spare bed.”
Castiel comes back from the kitchen in minutes, having blindly grabbed a selection of movie-side snacks – and, of course, his gift for Dean. He’s holding the fun-sized snack bags in one arm and lets them spill out of his embrace on the coffee table before he sits down, a nervous blush coloring his cheeks now.
