Once by the waiting room Rosie spotted Sherlock standing and she let go of Atlas' hand racing towards Sherlock. She wouldn't say anything as she ran towards him, but her footsteps were heard. Sherlock turned around to see Rosie running towards him, tears streaming down her forlorn face. Sherlock squatted down and scooped the crying child up, her head burying into his shoulder.
"Of course he knows it. There's few books he hasn't read." Wanda laughed bringing Sherlock some tea. Atlas gave a little laugh, smiling as she went back to her book. Then Rosie began coming down the stairs with a book clutched in one hand and Jeff in the other. Eventually when she reached the floor of cottage she quickly sped over to Sherlock and jumped up onto his lap.
"Did you have breakfast?" Atlas asked Sammy who nodded once. "Good, I've been up since seven so I have too."
"It is, to some, the best few months or years of their lives and for others the worst." John began, a hand gently on top of her head.
"Inspector Lestrade! Nice to see you again." Atlas courteously said producing a hand for the man to shake. He did so his eyes not breaking the gaze as she shook it rather ferociously. "I assume your here with your two kids?" It was now that the puzzle pieces were finally starting to interlock together and make a bigger picture. The reason she looked like Sherlock, how she knew that he was an Inspector and had two kids even when he hadn't told her.
He wasn't sure he was ready to adopt her yet or rather, he wasn't sure she was ready. That teenager had seen more than your normal teenager would, she hadn't even been here a full year and to be honest, John was scared of taking on a teenager seven years early. Then again, he supposed he already had and it wasn't that difficult.
Rosie's crying had marginally subsided and now she just snuffled into Sherlock's jacket. She was cold in here, the room was cold, everything felt cold. Atlas glanced over at John again. She hated that she couldn't figure out what was going on, she was sure Sherlock was feeling it too.
"A little bit," Wanda smiled. "You make sure my granddaughter gets some sleep." John dusted some flour of himself. "And I forgot to say, Sam?"
"Dad," Atlas whispered. "I don't think I'm going to do anything but sometimes I guess I don't know. I'm sorry for screaming at you and papa, you didn't deserve any of that."
"Thanks." Atlas smiled there was a silence. "Hey Aba?" Her head swung around fast. "I can call you that right?" Aba nodded once before Atlas continued. "Me and Sammy are headed for the library after school, do you want to join us?"
"Did you help choose the house?" Greg asked, before immediately u-turning and adding. "Of course you did. Sherlock's not that good."
"Oh god." Sammy said looking to the ceiling before putting his hands to his knees and looking at the floor. John reached out a tentative hand and placed it soothingly on his back. He rubbed gently.
"Its okay. Sherlock, please let me in." John said into his neck, a foot rubbing up and down Sherlock's leg. It was now he was thankful he had worn his fluffy socks. Sherlock would've had more reason to pull away if his feet were cold.
"Atlas gets them when she's feeling really, really nervous. She also has a problem with her heart that's not serious and they are still researching cases linked to that. It could be that her heart causes her to have the seizures but the doctor's don't know." John said quietly, stroking the young girls hair. "I know it's scary but we're going to get on top of them so they happen less often. It just might take some time, OK?"
"Now, Atlas." Dr Young said, brown eyes piercing hers. "I want you to focus on taking a sip from this cup of water. Can you do that for me?"
She managed a shake of her head before throwing up and throwing up and throwing up. "Your alright," Sherlock soothed. "It's alright." Sammy had long since disappeared with Rosie and now Atlas was closing her eyes.
"Anyway, I best be getting back." John sighed getting to his feet, whilst the woman scribbled a number onto a piece of paper.
"Yeah sure. What do you say to John?" She asked, putting her own arm round her dad's waist. "And when are you going to talk to him about it?"
THE next morning brought Mycroft and Eurus who stopped by with scones that Mycroft had made. Atlas was curled on the sofa, looking out the window vacantly when Mycroft walked over.
"I know it's early and your probably still grieving," Sherlock said, before reaching a hand out to John's wrist, pulling it from his temple and wrapping his fingers within his partners. "But do you know where the funeral will take place?"
"Ah, I read about this. Spent weeks trying to solve it to impress my boss, didn't work out," Isla smirked. "Ended up getting sacked but I got re-employed and worked on murders in the Highlands. Some interesting cases of bodies in suitcases and caves. Rather interesting."
"Since 6am." Atlas replied to Rosie's unvoiced question. Atlas lay her book on the bedside table and approached her rucksack. Inside were her clothes. It looked empty and felt light without the presents she had now placed underneath the tree. She pulled out her red fair isle christmas jumper along with the rest of her clothing and entered the bathroom down the hall. There she changed whilst Rosie changed in their bedroom.
"Ok." Atlas said before she looked to the sky again, the stars reflecting like fireworks in her eyes. And then there were tears, her eyes flooded in helpless pools that she decided she would blame on the wind that was just starting to pick up.
"I just hope John likes it. It was your great grandmother Olive's." Sherlock sighed before he looked at everything else. And then Atlas noticed the very large problem.
"A long time," Atlas said quietly. "The doctors all just said it was growing pains. And then it got worse but I didn't think it was important because of how often it varied and changed. Never in the same spot." She looked like she was about to cry.
"Yes. She had blood in her sick and they did a gastroscopy. She's scheduled for ten o'clock tonight." Eurus said.
"He's not dead." Atlas concluded for them as John was about to take his pulse. It was now that Atlas' stomach churned. Weeks ago she was sat in the window. One of the nights Sherlock had lost his memory, and he was one of the men in pursuit of a younger woman. She'd thought nothing of it - until now. He had a recognisable moustache, not a common thing among men, and a balding head. Atlas' eyes kept looking over to the dead body, tears spilling in her eyes.
"I'm concerned about why we're doing this." Sherlock mumbled so Rosie didn't panic, but of course she heard it. Glue was dropped almost immediately after and Sherlock assembled it on the back of a piece of paper.
"Are they...I mean....are they coming to the wedding?" Sherlock asked, the silence drawing out between them. "Do you want them there?"
"Sam." Atlas croaked, as Sammy gave a little smile. "Ro." She croaked again and opened her arms out so that Sammy could lie Rosie next to her on the bed.
"One...Two...Three." Doctor Aduba said before Atlas found herself up on her feet and her face broke into the widest smile she ever dared to give. "Okay, Sherlock if you come stand next to me." Tentatively, Sherlock moved away, exchanging a nod with Atlas before standing in front of her.
"Okay." Sherlock said as Rosie squeezed around the back of the sofa and tied it around his eyes. Launched into darkness Sherlock waited anxiously. Rosie walked over to the front door and opened it for Atlas to step through with Redbeard. Wanda and Timothy shared a knowing look as they entered.
"It was uncomfortable," Atlas mumbled before she looked back at him before throwing her arms around his shoulders. He hugged her back, squeezing her to give a bit of pressure.
And when Sherlock came down the stairs and saw John, he sat down next to him and leaned back against the back of the sofa, pulling his husband to his chest. Eyes still covered, John's tears subsided and Sherlock continued to rub his back.
"What does he live in, some sort of mansion?" Sammy joked, before seeing that Atlas' eyes were not laughing. "Your serious." Atlas gave a smile before a nod. "Bloody hell, is he a millionaire or something?"
"Do you want to make a daisy chain crown?" May asked Atlas, offering some daisy's but Atlas shook her head.
"Let' call him Buzz Buzz Man." Mycroft laughed before Eurus shot him a not-funny look and he stopped.
"Oh, okay." Atlas sighed. "It's pretty rubbish. And part of me hopes its epilepsy and part of me wishes that it isn't."
"I know what a gun wound feels like." Atlas said into the woman's ear. "And I'm impressed with myself I didn't just shoot you when I had the chance."
AFTER the meal, the group settled infront of the fire with wine. Rosie, curled up against the dog on the floor, Mou coming to settle near them.
"Because he was going around pinching girls...well...you know where...and I brought it up to him and he didn't stop so I punched him," Sammy said quietly. "The Scottish government are looking to police that too."
"Just so you know. I would never and I will never leave you behind." Sherlock said kissing her hair and resting his cheek on top of her head.
"Sherlock?" Atlas knocked. "Sherlock?" Atlas entered to see him fully engrossed in his experiment. He didn't even flinch when she shut the door and so carefully she approached him. She didn't have to ask what he was doing to know that he would probably end up on the list of most likely to be a murderer list if someone found him - then again, he probably already was.
Or rather she was sick. She thought. Couldn't really tell but before long she had a bucket bouncing against her front as she dry heaved. Then, soon after, she was being wrestled into a wheelchair and carted off to the shower block. Couldn't really tell but she had someone strip off her clothing and help her shower and change. She can only remember staying seated. Her legs too weak.
"Its alright, dad," Atlas said gently with a grin and he looked at her as she nodded before putting her head back against John.
And also, it would be appreciated if you read the note at the start of this story - it might help you understand what's coming up.
JOHN kicked the chest of drawers hard after tidying up his sister and mother's wounds and putting them into their room. He'd applied glue to a wound above Harry's eye and then checked her ribs. When he checked his mother over, she was in a better way physically. Less injuries. But after the phone call when they had been told his dad was dead she was mentally falling. He suspected they'd be staying with them a while longer.
"Alright Rosamund. I'm just coming." Mycroft smiled as he got to his feet. "Will you be our tour guide?"
"I know," John said. "Anyways, I came up here to say that Isla has been baking and she wanted if any of you wanted a blueberry muffin. She's made plain too."
"Papa, please," Atlas said quietly looking at him. "Your tired and-" She sat down on the bed. "And this is a lot and I'm not..."
"Yeah. 'Spose it's the whole observation thing. This is how I release what I feel." Atlas said as she continued to tap.
"Don't speak because I understand. Atlas is your best friend other than me." John smiled but frowned when Sherlock didn't slow his breathing and instead it picked up. "Hey, hey...Sherlock...you need to slow it down. Your having a panic attack. You need to breathe."
"It's just people in the kitchen, the powers back but it's due to go off again in a bit so they're stocking up the hot water bottles and things," John said, just as Sherlock came over and kneeled by her knee.
"Your ok. Wherever you went, your ok." The voice repeated and Atlas looked to see John staring at her, hands placed either side of her face. "Listen to me."
"We're lost dad," Atlas whispered as they looked back. "I think we need to head back up the path, up the hill I mean."
THEY were so busy and preoccupied eating and chatting, that they didn't hear the nurse knock on the door the first time. She knocked a second time and Sherlock's head went up. Everyone else followed his gaze and Sherlock stood to stand opposite the nurse. He was smiling, so Sherlock took that as good news.
The people around them were confused. They had heard of Sherlock Holmes but who was this mystery girl going around with him. Speculation had led to the public learning that he was gay, then came the blog note about the engagement. But the two men were always so careful not to involve their children. They didn't want speculation to follow them too.
"I'm assuming you read it too?" Sherlock asked as Atlas looked at him before looking back at the bookcase and nodding. Often when there was a lot on her mind she remained quiet and more thoughtful.
"Are you finished?" Doctor Aduba asked before he took the basin and handed it to the smiley nurse. "We've seen a spike in her temperature so we're going to keep a keen eye on her overnight because we haven't ruled out-"
"Not sure. We like it here. Atlas is from Edinburgh," He nodded to the girl in question who was standing on a rock. "We came here a lot when she was little."
"Pretty good, they have loads of string sets. And I managed..." Atlas paused and looked to her dad. "To get the good ones. The normally really expensive ones, and dad checked them."
"There," Rosie said pointing to Atlas' stomach. "There." She pointed to the back of her head, a hand around it. "I don't know any other except for...this one." Rosie said before clamping her hands around Atlas' waist and giving her a hug. "The big scary one on your back."
However, it didnt last as her eyes opened and Sherlock slid down to lie on his side opposite her. The tissue now being folded by John then carefully deposited in the bin.
"Why? Why shouldn't I care?" John whisper shouted in return looking at her with sparkling blue eyes. He looked like he was going to break down.
"Black." She smiled before uttering a "thank you" when the older woman placed it on the table before giving it to John and Sherlock. She collected her own before disappearing out, her voice joining Rosie's in telling Redbeard a story.
A few minutes later after sitting in painful silence aside from the beeping on the clock Atlas heard the front door open and in came John. As he made his way up the stairs he analysed the scuff marks and followed the trail to Atlas' room.
"Rosie?" Atlas asked straining against the covers, trying to grab a hold of something. Her eyes were wide and her pupils dilated.
"That's it Sherlock, it's alright, it's alright," Harry said, rubbing his shoulder. "That's it. In and out. Breathe with me now, Sherlock. In and out. In and out."
"John. Me and your mother are concerned." John Sr said his eyebrows furrowing to cover his eyes slightly. "We don't think two dads is a good environment to raise children up in."
"So are we...y'know doing this now?" John asked his fingers messing through his partner's curls. Sherlock looked up, burrowing his brows thoughtfully, before removing his arms. Sherlock sat up abruptly and looked at him like a kicked puppy.
"She's hallucinating," Dr Khris said as Atlas pinned one of the nurses to the wall before releasing her grip, all members of staff scattering.
"Cries when you speak," John finished as Atlas smirked and went over to sit next to him. "I love you."
THE evening light dappled across the bedroom as Sherlock sighed. There, on the bed, curled up tight on his side was John. In the moonlight, his silver hair shone as he slept peacefully. Slipping inside, Sherlock padded carefully into the room and shut the door with a soft click. A deep quiet sniff and suddenly Sherlock knew he was safe. Totally and completely safe. Infact, Sherlock often found it funny that people - including himself - were so comforted by the smell of another being to whom they were close to. Any of his family or close friends would probably have this effect but John.
"If it's alright with papa." Mycroft said looking up to meet John's softened eyes. "And, Eurus is here too, she's outside painting another portrait of Redbeard or something."
"Now. We're here." Atlas said as they went up the stairs, leading to a sunlit hallway that was long and had rooms on either side. There was also a hallway that stuck to the wall and led to a banister that snaked along. Atlas assumed they'd get to that later. The first room they entered was the bathroom, done up with wood amongst other things
"If your a freak then I'm a freak," Timothy said. "And we certainly are not. Whose said that to you?"
"The way we were brought up, huh? So unfair." Eurus smirked before she realised they'd been down that path already.
"The Hobbit...Again." Atlas said looking up at Timothy. She'd borrowed it from John and she liked it most when she could imagine how the songs would sound in her head.
"Of course I'm scared Atlas." Sherlock chided with a ferocity John had never seen before but then his features softened and he sighed, pulled her forehead to his lips and kissed it. His hands were either side of her face, her hair unruly. He rubbed a thumb over her cheek at the tear marks that still remained.  "I love you and I'm going to say this to you because I never have. You are one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I needed you and I need you in my life. Atlas, I'm so scared because aside from your papa...you are my best friend. We live in a world that is our own and you understand me in a way-" Sherlock looked to John. "And don't take this wrong John because this is one of the reasons I love you because you take me into reality." Sherlock looked back to Atlas. "You understand me in a way that no-one else can. Because...well...because.."
"Night night." She drawled and finally Sherlock left the bedroom. When he got downstairs he sat between Atlas and John, lifting his arm for John to slot in. The conversation with Eurus now ending.
"Your beautiful, John," Sherlock said resting his chin on John's shoulder. "Don't let these things get you down. You are wonderful. You are everything to me."
"Yeah." Her voice quivered. "I'm doing good for someone who just had a bomb strapped to her chest." Tears formed in her eyes and she cursed herself for crying behind her book. Why couldn't she be stronger? Why couldn't she fight them off? Why couldn't her brain just stop? Why couldn't she sleep?
"Why?" Sherlock asked suddenly. "Other than to check she's ok, there isn't anything else we-we should be-be worrying about. Right?"
WHEN Timothy returned he had one book in his hand, smiling he approached the bookshelf beckoning for Atlas to join him. Everyone resumed usual conversations.
"Yes and the GP has put me on digoxin alongside the seizure medication and the tremors. The seizure medication has been helping with the pain and I kept your advise about upping the dosage if the pain is extreme and I have those other back up meds for that that my papa has in liquid form and tablet form," Atlas smiled.
"For f-sake," Harry exclaimed. "Why do I dislike so many members of this family?" She paused. "Except for you Pete and all of you guys, Sherlock. I've also been chatting to your sister."
"Come here," John said from where he was sat on the sofa, the younger man joining him in an embrace. "I'll miss my Xray if we take too long but for now...you deserve all the love in the world."
"She had a heart attack," John said as he leaned against Sherlock. "Christ, it's weird to say those words aloud in referral to a sixteen year old girl." Sherlock mumbled something in agreement. He watched as her chest rose and fell slowly and Sherlock looked like he was going to cry.
"Yeah, but you've got to be lucky. Which is why I want to be a consulting detective and which is also why I think you need to buy Mr Chatterjee's establishment and refurbish Speedy's into "Holmes & Watson" Consulting Detecive Agency or Service or whatever."
Sammy wanted to be a musician. To fill the ears of near people with joy. Guitar was his main instrument but he could also play drums, the trumpet and the saxophone. He could sing too and already had with his best friend in the whole wide world Atlas. Atlas was, in many ways, his favourite person and he loved her. Loved her like a sister, like a piece of himself. They were insperable and he knew that they always would be.
"Why does Rosie call you dad? And John papa?" Atlas asked absent mindedly as they continued to walk.
"I know. You and your dad are hopeless." John laughed. "If you need anything tell me." There was a pause as he sighed. "I'll even make up a hot water bottle."
"You check the body on the bed." Sherlock instructed John as the man scuttled over to the mystery. Atlas sat looking cold and frightened. "Atlas. Atlas look at me, was there anyone else in the room." She shook her head furiously in response and Sherlock stood to look at the dead body. Atlas stood with him.
"Then tell me. Tell me where my husband is." John shouted, looking back at Atlas. Timothy and Wanda had now stood and were looking at the three just as expectantly.
"Can...Can I call you guys John and Sherlock?" Atlas asked catching both the men's attention. "I'm not really good with all these formalities."
WHEN Sherlock hopped into the front seat of the land rover, prepared to drive and drive and drive he was surprised to see Atlas sitting in the passenger seat.
"How old is she? What like eighteen?" John asked studying his friend up and down. For the first time in ages Sherlock's face was vulnerable and he looked like he wanted to cry. The normally composed man seemed to be breaking at the seams and John knew that there was more to the story than was being let on.
The room fell into a steady silence as the conversation drew itself a conclusion. Sherlock's parents were shocked to see him in quite such a different light as this. One where he cared and he was really trying to make things right by the girl he could now call his daughter. It scared Mycroft and it sent John running for the hills, but maybe it was for the best.
It was typed, and so was the address. This meant that Atlas couldn't decipher the tone of the letter or who may have written it.
"Edinburgh." Sherlock answered, Atlas burrowing into his chest. He stroked her hair before flipping the page. More photos of her, this time as toddler. The creak of the bedroom door made Atlas look up quickly, to see John walking in.
"Yep," John clipped before he looked to the door, just in time for Sherlock to slip in with Sammy, Rosie and his own and Atlas' violin case?
"Oh, this is a nice bathroom." John said as he looked inside of it and ran his hands over the light blue walls. He came out and looked at Sherlock.
"Look it's not a problem. I'm just gonna lie on the floor with my feet on a sofa." She said, finally wiggling the coat off of her shoulders and sitting on the floor.
"Shall we go then?" Sherlock asked, everyone nodded before they moved out the door and started along the street. Mrs Hudson looking after Redbeard for the day.
"We'll worry about all that when you get back. It should be okay because both me and Sherlock have been approved for adoption with the girls so we should be allowed to be carers for you, should that be what you choose. You are seventeen so you can always live alone." John said with a shining smile.
"I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't." John said quietly, before looking at where Sherlock was sitting up against the head board.
ATLAS gripped the sink in her private bathroom and looked at the mirror before she put two hands to her cheeks and forced her lips into a smile.
Tentatively, Atlas gave a little knock, Whisper hidden against her chest. "Dad?" She asked quietly, opening the door to see the man furrowing his eyebrows furiously at a book on the solar system. It had come through as one of Rosie's reception topics and although Atlas and John had already told him to great length that she would not need to know about all of Jupiter's moons or how many galaxies they predict there are on average, Sherlock being Sherlock, still did it. And besides, it wasn't like he knew any of it already.
"That was a lie." Greg smirked before Atlas gave him a look. "Alright, I won't call them. Come and have a look." Lestrade said, before looking over to her friend. "And you can bring your version of Watson."
"So, how have you all been?" Sherlock asked with a smile, the facade making its way effectively across his face again.
"This is your daughter, Sherlock." John replied as he removed his hand from atop of Sherlock's and gestured to Atlas. Upon seeing she was far from okay he took her hand in his and held it.
"Your a good dad, Sherlock." Eurus applauded as her and Mycroft walked in, keeping their voices down as Rosie remained swaddled. Atlas had fallen asleep against his arm, her red jacket contrasting Sherlock's black jacket. Sherlock smiled at them bleary eyed, somehow showing his emotions before his siblings.
"I know, Sherl, I know," John smiled as Atlas sat up next to him and wrapped her arms over Sherlock's back in a hug.
"AWWWW fuck off." Atlas said feeling that familiar feeling in her abdomen. "I'm supposed to see Sammy on Saturday, the family on Sunday." She looked down at herself as the feeling continued, cramping in her stomach. Being a teenage female with two male parents was interesting at the best of times and she had never mentioned her period before. That was something she wasn't ready to discuss, and besides she never found a reason to - particularly as it wasn't bad.
"Not even that. I'm worried," John said quietly, reaching a hand out to tuck a piece of hair behind her left ear.
"And I'll facetime Atlas. And could you maybe send through the things the doctors say. And then keep me updated on how you all are and obviously on she is." Sammy said, all his words running out in one go.
"No," Atlas persisted. "If I stay standing then maybe it won't happen." She was holding herself up through Sammy and she squatted.
"It's not real," Atlas sobbed, clutching at her face and flailing. She couldn't get rid of the panic and the pain and everything was too much. And then there was a noise. People's voices and the familiar creek of stairs, her hands clamped over her nose and mouth as she panted into them.
"Course you can, sweetheart," John smiled as he opened out his arms and beckoned for her to get closer. Doing so he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her hair in a sweet gesture. "Are you okay?"
Again, please tell me if there are any inconsistencies with timings of things - particularly as this story progresses.
"I thought you were up," Isla said with a smile. "Look at you two." She paused. "You are so alike. Anyway, I wanted to ask if you want anything to eat or drink Atlas?"
"Some pastels, paper for them and..." He was seen scrabbling in the cupboard for something until suddenly he pulled out a huge panda soft toy. "And this." He paused. "Georgia never touched it...ever." He paused again. "And Rosie, she's my family now, and she'll love it."
"What was it for you?" Atlas asked, with those blue eyes that could figure out what they were if she really wanted to. But no, no she was
"Alright, Atlas," John said as he looked at her concerned. She opened her mouth to speak but it was as if she couldn't and her eyes went wide. "It's alright. Sammy?"
"Fresh air!" Rosie squealed as she tried to feed Jeff some tuna and sweetcorn sandwich but he wasn't having any of it. "Jeff, eat up or there won't be any pudding at all." She paused. "Alright, fine I won't force you to. I'll just have your helping instead. Yes, I do love you." She brought the toy into a hug. "I promise."
"Absolutely not," John said. "I'm going to stay with you and I know your desperately trying to not let it show that you want that."
"I am. But I wanted to do one this morning and one this evening." Dr Aduba said before Atlas sit up and offered up her arm.
Just a warning that there are slight mentions of sexual nature throughout. More however, in the next chapter.
"ADD Italy here, Sweden, Norway." She said as a pair of scissors were dropped through the ceiling onto the table. She looked at Sherlock before nodding as they assembled a look a like knife.
THE following morning, Atlas was standing beside an open window, letting the fresh, Edinburgh morning breeze wash over her. The dog was lying beside her feet and there was a little but of a few over the city. Without warning, a presence appeared at her shoulder, momentarily startling before relaxing.
"Exactly, and I can testify. And you smell nice which Atlas also agrees and you are nice to hug which Sammy says. Your good for advice, you light up the entire room, your kind, your generous, you look after people..." Sherlock stopped. "Truly, my list goes on."
"Stay lying down. From my understanding, it's been a while since your last convulsive seizure. Your not going to bounce back as fast as the last time." John warned as Atlas lay back down nodding. Sherlock swiping her hair out of her face gently as she looked out the double doors.
"But I keep having a recurring dream which is also sometimes a flashback," Atlas said, picking at the duvet cover. "Of the day he died."
"That's good enough for me." Atlas said as she smiled at him before leaving the room. He nodded in her direction as she left, the smile lingering on her lips.
"This will be me and John's room." Sherlock said, Atlas nodding as she saw the bookcase in the wall again and she smiled. This house was really taking her fancy.
"Okay, I need-need to go back-back to sleep." Atlas chattered as she pulled away and looked at Sammy. She was just about to lie down when she felt Wanda's hand go to her forehead.
"I'm going shopping this morning." John sighed, groaning as he sat down on the sofa, watching carefully. "Do either of you want to come?"
Then they reentered the house Rosie going first. Carefully Rosie removed Sherlock's scarf from the coat rack before reaching the room.
"Sammy wants to call you guys dad and papa but he doesn't know how to say it," Atlas said bluntly. "What?" She paused. "I wasn't going to beat around the bush."
"Eh, no buts either miss," Sherlock scolded with a smirk before sitting down on the bed, John pulling up a chair.
"Same way as yours is Mrs Pertwee." Atlas smirked, deducing the woman's marital status. "Gifted from my father."
Soon enough, Wanda and Timothy were pulling them into the room and seating them down at the makeshift dining table.
Atlas looked tongue tied so Sherlock stepped in. "Pain, tremors, fainting, the seizures...is that about it?"
"Alright, Atlas is with me though, so I hope that's alright?" John asked as Atlas eyed him up questioning who the caller was.
She'd grown over the past fortnight. And appeared to be fully engaged in whatever she was doing. So, Sherlock slipped into his lab gear and slowly and steadily sidled up next to her.
And in that door that Atlas had seen, leading from the kitchen was a huge work space - it had to be the size of all the bedrooms put together. She'd been told by Sherlock Sherlock they weren't going in there today - it was going to be a
"They'll do." John smiled, taking them from Atlas. They moved around all the stalls, eagerly exploring the different options for their tree.
ATLAS was sat on the bed when they walked in, with her fingertips held against her temples. Her dad could be heard giving her positive encouragement, egging her towards reaching her unused mind palace.
"I'm going to change. Mum, do not interrogate Atlas. She's cool. And besides," He said firmly. "The first girl to think I wasn't hitting on her." His mother gave a laugh before he darted up the stairs.
"It was my last night in care." She whispered, John continuing to rub her back. "A week before I came here. The father in my foster home, Mr Peterson, had...had a knife. After some generalised." Atlas swallowed hard, the moments reliving befor her eyes yet again. "Abuse. He held it to my throat as a threat. Eventually, he cast it off to the side and he beat me against the wall. My head must've split or something because before long I could feel stickiness dragging down my neck." She said, silent tears falling from her eyes. She soon began to cry. Not ugly cry, but cry with grief. Grief for what she had lost because of what people did to her. Grief for the deaths she witnessed while with the Peterson's. She was a mess, a broken horrible mess.
"Can I sit?" John asked, taking the moment carefully. When she nodded, he sat, near enough to her to touch but not too close that it could spook her. "Do you want to talk about it?"
"C'mere." Sherlock said as he opened his arms. "I believe you." There was a quiet pause. "I'll always believe you." Atlas cried at that and entered her dad's embrace, awaiting to hear John's sigh but it never came. Before she knew it was happening she felt herself being hugged by another person, John. She could smell his jumper.
"What would you like to eat?" Sherlock asked, putting the tea towel back over his shoulder. He walked around the other side of the breakfast bar and put the pan from Rosie's eggs away in the sink. "We have granola and porridge and loads of other things. Rosie is the most fussy eater known to man."
ATLAS analysed the body, paced a little, pictured the scene in her head, solved who the murderer was, told the police where to find them, and was left at the scene of the crime with Lestrade.
"Because you said I looked ill, and if I look ill then they'll have to cut their time short and I don't want that to happen. I don't want them to come home before they should because ultimately it will be my fault that they'll have had to come home and I'll feel guilty about it because they need time to-" Atlas rambled looking down at where she attempted to pour out some cereal.
"Atlas, I will not warn you again." Mrs Pertwee scolded, John staying well and truly out of this all. Due to himself and Sherlock becoming increasingly high profile only a handful of teachers knew they were Atlas' parents. Despite this, Atlas insisted that she keep her last name. A little piece of something that was undoubtedly, and truly her own.
"You know," Sherlock said. "She looks smaller everyday. And I get more and more scared everyday and it's a pain." He swallowed. "Right here." He put his hand against his chest. "Is she going to live? Is she going to die? If she survives, what's her quality of life going to be? Like the day she was born and she didn't cry. And she didn't breathe and then-then Mary-Anne says that we're giving her up. But I stop her and I take Atlas home whilst she's off doing god knows what and I feed her on formula and sing songs and play my fiddle and rock her. And then her first seizure." Sherlock looks to the ceiling with tears in his eyes. "At twenty two months old and thank God it was me and her. Thank god her mother wasn't at home. I remember running to the hospital with her little body, her trousers wet because stupid, stupid Sherlock left her with her mother that morning and Mary-Anne never put her in a nappy. And then she was soaked because of the seizure and I remember sitting in the hospital, holding her to my chest as they sit there and tell me that they don't know the cause. But that they know it's not epilepsy. And then it happens again and again and then one day when she's four years old," Sherlock bites back a sob and looks at John calculatedly. "She's at home with her mother and I'm not there. She has one," He looks back to the ceiling. "And she falls to the floor, has a seizure and wets herself 'cause you know..." John nodded, he did know. "And her mother sees the floor and tries to find her and at this point, Atlas is so scared and she's hiding under the table. And I walk in to see Mary-Anne crouching and looking under the table trying to reach Atlas who just skitters out the other side into my legs in a mass of sobs."
"I don't have a great ground in that department." Sherlock sighed, in fact, if anything he was really bad at being polite. He didnt understand what was the proper behaviour and it stressed him out, he knew it did.
"What wonderful ingredients have you brought this time?" Mycroft asked as he remembered the last time. Atlas and him were baking in Sherlock's flat, when she went to look for some currants for the scones. Spiders fell out the packet, hundreds of them scattering into all corners and when she then proceeded to look elsewhere she found pigs eyeballs.
"What's your favourite bit?" Timothy asked as he looked at Atlas sat opposite him, she looked at him over the top of her book before folding it over her thumb.
"She seems lovely. I've seen her in here before with another man..." The woman said, pausing as shd thought of how to describe him. "Tall man, dark haired, really resembles your daughter."
"She's alright. Last night was a little rough." Sherlock said before standing to his feet, taking Rosie's hand and walking towards the counter where they'd been making cupcakes. Sammy watched with the same saddness as Sherlock slowly moved from his momentary pause towards him.
"So Sammy," Wanda began the boy looking over to her from where he was walking with Atlas. Wanda, Sammy and Atlas were walking in a line. Sherlock, John, Rosie and Timothy a few steps ahead of them.
"It's Rosie." Eurus admitted. "I didn't want to tell John, but we can't get her down to sleep. She keeps saying she has something for Atlas. I said that me and Mycroft would take her tomorrow but she keeps saying it over and over." There was a pause. "I'm really worried Sherlock."
"Because dad trusted you," Atlas whispered before she pulled away and sat down on the bed, Dr Aduba re-entering the room.
"Your not?" Atlas asked with a furrowed brow before continuing. "Okay. Well, they confirmed the PTSD. They think it's just funny wiring or something. So they've started me on anti-anxiety pills to see if they will stop them or decrease them to just once or twice a month."
"But a lot of the time we're mixed because we've got a very sick kid," Sherlock frowned. "And another who's struggling with the loss of two parents and a little sister all within less than six months."
"You've all had a hard day. Maybe you should all go home and get some rest." Mr Fraggerty said before looking over to the head teacher.
They played lots and lots of the game, getting through the disposal of three bodies before they got bored and decided that they wanted to watch a programme. Quietly they argued before Atlas managed to persuade her dad into watching some episodes of "Glee." Just as it approached three AM Atlas giggled a little too loudly at the cringe of a one Rachel Berry ⭐ and John began to stir on the couch. Sherlock paused the episode before looking down to Atlas then back over to John who was now peering through the darkness.
"Okay, okay," John whispered, a cheek to his head. "We'll go tomorrow morning. There isn't going to be any outgoing flights tonight."
"It was twenty two seconds and little. Really little. You know those little jerky movements," Sammy smiled as John nodded quietly.
"She tried to smother Atlas in clothes. I came back in time. Looked after Atlas for a few years. Couldn't look after her, placed her in care. The end. No more discussion." Sherlock said frustrated, emphasising that this was clearly a touchy subject to himself.
AT the beginning of the day Sherlock, John and Mycroft did not expect to be sitting in a hospital ward waiting for Atlas to come out of surgery. She'd been in for around two hours as they tried to take the bullet out, but it was embedded deep. It was clear to them that they were trying.
"Alright, blue eyes. What game do you want go play?" Mycroft asked gently. "We have 'Scrabble' and 'The Logo Board Game' and we also have 'Trivial Pursuit.'" He gave a weak smile.
"Apologies." Atlas laughed before she sprinted back, jumped into the hammock and picked up her book. Sammy picking up the same titled book as they continued to read alongside each other.
"Yeah. I'm going to adopt her. She's sixteen, but bright so they allowed her in the year above." John smiled, thinking about Atlas' face when he would tell her. He just didn't know how to yet, a conversation with Sherlock was therefore in order. "See? I just can't do the talk." John insisted again, looking up at the man pleadinlgy. He should just not have looked up because he was met with an equally pleading one.
PERIOD five on Thurday brought Mrs Pertwee. It was going okay, only Sammy and Abayomi in that class. Well, it was going okay till Mrs Pertwee beckoned Atlas up to the front of the class filled her peers.
JOHN was reading his book quite happily when his phone rang. The sound made him jump. Jo and Harry had already gone to bed and so had Rosie so, with a confused then urgent frown he answered. Expecting it to be Sherlock.
"I feel bad not mentioning this earlier." Sammy said cautiously after a few quiet moments had passed.
"Did you get it published?" John asked as he walked over from the bookcase. Atlas and Timothy exchanged a look before they both nodded eagerly. Wanda bustled over to Timothy kissing him on the cheek before saying.
"Not what?" He asked. "Atlas, everything is difficult at the moment. My dad died and now I have to face his homophibic family and it's a lot to deal with."
ROSIE showed and pointed lots of different drawings and things out to her family across the room. She darted about showing pieces of artwork to various people, everyone splitting up to make a judgement for themselves.
"Because I don't want them to think they have to sit with me. 'Cause I don't want them to." Atlas said. "I don't want them to waste their time on me."
"Cold curry isn't very nice, not nice at all," Sherlock said to her before Rosie started to eat away again.
"I said that he shouldn't care, because he isn't my dad." Atlas said quietly, looking at her dumplings like they were the most interesting thing in the world.
Half an hour later, when John and Sherlock came downstairs they were greeted by a table adorned with jams, curds and spreads. Lemon juice and sugar. There were two plates with pancakes stacked on either end of the large table. Coffee pots and tea pots with mugs around the table, with plates and knives and forks.
THE Northern Lights scattered over the sky reflected in Sherlock's eyes as painting and John smiled.
"Great description but luckily Atlas will know where you mean, yeah, we'll see you there," John said smiling as he looked at Atlas who was bouncing on her toes.
"Because I can't understand why they would be." She whispered, choked up on threatening tears. "I hate not being able to understand."
"She said sorry." Sherlock sighed before shuffling forwards in his seat and taking her hand. "Don't say sorry. It's nothing you can help and don't say sorry. I don't want you to." But she'd already fallen asleep and sighing, Sherlock's head went to his hands. He could be heard taking a deep breath before Rosie walked over and put her little arms around his form. Gathering her into his lap, he gave a little smile, and was seen to almost immediately relax. A state of comfort.
John glanced over at Sherlock who was sat with his daughter, then over to Atlas. He's doing fine and there I'd this sort of unspoken love between them. He didn't know if he could ever say so however.
She sobbed as he stroked her cheek and looked at Mycroft gently. "You can go if you want," Sherlock said with a smile.
"Right," John said, popping his head up from behind some child size waterproofs. "Rosie, love, come over here. Sherlock, could you take those two over to look at some more waterproofs. Heavy enough to be durable but light enough to carry in a rucksack."
Mycroft held her up until he realised and he lay her back down and he got onto his feet immediately.
Sherlock paused looking away from the shorter man, there must have been dust blowing in his eyes. "And that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and the most human." His throat constricted, the variation in his voice not going unnoticed. He remembered vividly all the drugs, the stubble, the mess that he was. A pang in his chest struck him, like a pain.
"Its not Sherlock, it's John. We need to ask you a big favour. Could you possibly make up the bed in the spare room and put up the spare mattress with a cover too?" John asked on the other side of the line. "My mum and sister need to stay with us." There was a pause. "I know it's a big ask."
"Alright. Go over to Sherlock." John said as she walked over to Sherlock who hung his coat around her shoulders and helped her into the car. He smiled at her and she smiled back with her gingery hair.
"Probably." Atlas laughed before humming against his chest. "Did you know that I was nine weeks early when I was born?"
"I used to take Atlas here when her mother wasn't around or after...well...after we had to go to the hospital because of the seizures or whatever," Sherlock smiled as Atlas slipped out of her side of the booth and hugged his shoulders, tightly.
"She's alright. Smart. And plus Rosie won't speak to anyone but her really. Although today was the first day she had really said anything more than a single word out loud." Sherlock explained, everything gushing out of him with a pride he'd never experienced before.
"Dad, dad, dad," Rosie said as she came and stood on his feet gripping onto his hands, Jeff tucked into her jumper. "When are grandma and grandad coming?"
"How was it?" Sherlock asked as he leaned forward on the breakfast bar and kissed John's cheek as he paused from the pasta.
"You can't, there's only one of them," Mycroft said with a nod. "No-one can ever care about something as much as my brother does."
"I..." John began but Sherlock silenced him with a third and final kiss. And when they pulled away they smiled at each other.
"Lightbulb moment." Atlas said before picking up her book and plonking herself in the window seat on some cushions. "I was three days early getting into London." She was finished with cooking for the time being. That and she didn't want to witness the awkward conversations between Sherlock and Molly and Molly's likely peculiar new partner, Andrew.
Peter, her brother, however, disagreed entirely and upon getting in the car made that note quite plain.
"For goodness sake, shopping with those two is like shopping with them when they were yay high." Timothy sighed as he watched Sherlock follow Mycroft. "They'll come back with everything we don't need." John gave a chuckle to this as they selected some ingredients that they needed.
"You had some seizures." The nurse informed. "You have a high temperature and have thrown up. You've had a shower and we cleaned the bed but you've had multiple absence seizures."
"That would be very nice, thank you," Lucy smiled before Sherlock disappeared outside and John was left smiling at her.
"Atlas!" John shouted this time making his way to the top of the stairs. "Its the middle of the bloody night." But it was too late, she was out the door and John ran a tired hand over his face before returning to his partner. He wouldn't tell him, that could be messy. Besides, its not like Sherlock would sense the tension and if he did, he wouldn't be able to figure it out.
"Mr Holmes! Mr Holmes!" A man was shouting at the other side of the aisle, running towards them. Atlas looked over to Sherlock wide eyed as they realised that he was a reporter.
"Hey," Sherlock whispered as he stood in the door and he looked upset too. He just stood in the door and Atlas looked back into the mirror and picked up the hairbrush. She pulled it through her hair and frowned when it tugged a little hard. But she did it again and again and again and again. "Atlas." He moved a little closer. "Atlas, sweetheart, stop." He came over and put his hands on the hand pulling a brush through her hair. She tried to pull it again before Sherlock gripped her hand, took the hairbrush and brushed it.
"Eight am. We arrived around about six which is when they took you to the shower block." Mycroft explained as he pulled up a chair and sat down. He held her hands in his own as she stayed sat. Rubbing gently Atlas gave a small smile, as Mycroft pulled her forehead to his lips and kissed gently. "Oh Ida."
"John won't like that," A voice said in the dark and Sherlock turned in a full circle before his eyes fell on Mycroft.
"But if I do. Tell Sherlock I love him. And that I know he's trying really hard to be a good dad. I love him and I love you John. Thank you for giving me emotional support when the genius turns into a robot." She tried to give him a little chuckle but it only came out as a guttural sob.
"I love you too, I'll run the clothes down and then we'll chat with dad and papa yeah? You come down when you ready," Atlas said with a smile, getting to her feet, she collected the jumper, t-shirt and then went to get a pair of trousers that belonged to Sherlock - It would fit his waist best. Collecting all the items, she went downstairs and knocked at the kitchen door with a towel. "I brought the stuff."
"Something simple I feel. Let's make ginger and chocolate chip cookies." Mycroft said once he had opened his recipe to an appropriate page and the pair got to work.
"Yeah," Sammy signed with a grin. "In here on your laptop though, Rosie's about and she's too little."
When they finally arrived they could see Harry and Jo in a little booth off to one side and they joined them. Atlas slipped into the seat next to the wall and John slipped in next to her.
"And there's more bad news. The lukemia is stage 3." John sighed as he looked at Georgia. "And because of what type and how aggressive it is behaving in Georgia's system and how fast it has spread..."
"Yeah, I'm just really tired. It's one of the symptoms." She said quietly, rubbing her nose against him before regaining her focus on the laptop resting in his lap. On the other side of the room, Wanda was helping Sammy with his assignment whilst Rosie sat on the floor playing with Redbeard.
"Come on you two," Sherlock said to Atlas and Sammy who quickly caught them at the door. "Dinner?" He then asked John.
And it was in this moment that Atlas realised that being a Holmes was going to get more interesting once Sherlock and John set up that instagram account for the family. The plan was to make it official that Rosie and Atlas were their children but that meant that the people were likely going to follow them. Publicity and such.
"Exactly," Sherlock whispered. "Now, I was thinking of feeding our kids scrambled eggs and beans on toast."
That's what Sammy saw when he walked in. He himself then wrapped his blanket around him and huddled into a bedside chair.
"Not quite all the way, sweetheart," Sherlock smiled at her. "Now come on, eat your curry before it gets cold."
"How long did I sleep?" Sherlock sighed silently cursing himself for falling asleep on duty. He glanced to his right and saw John sleeping, momentarily he smiled before continuing to scowl at himself.
ATLAS saw the party before she heard it. Staggering teens made their way past them as they walked to the house. Foolishly, they'd all assumed it was alcohol and drug free but now, as they approached the house, they noted that it was far from it.
"I see all the clues. I just..." Sherlock sighed, running a hand over her face. "I just don't have the emotional capability to get it right."
"Sherlock, it's definitely ours? No strings attached? No nothing?" John asked, thinking of times earlier in their lives.
When Isla came back in she found them sitting crossed legged, facing each other with bits of paper and photographs strewn all over the place. Sticky notes and highlighted phrases outlined suspects.
"Being here," Sherlock said quietly. "She's hiding bits of herself to avoid arguments. She doesn't want to put a foot wrong because she's so afraid of making a big deal of things because she's scared you'll be disappointed, John. We're scared. We."
"And you love me, which is more than can be said for most of the people who have cared for me. And your the first one to actually adopt me and go for it. That makes you and will always make you my papa, my dad, my father, the man who, probably with dad, will walk me down the aisle, the man who I will have to get boyfriends past, the man who'll help me when I break up with a boyfriend and tell me guys are useless despite being married to and being one himself, the man who will give me a hug and help me with homework and help me get into university and the man who, when the time comes, I will look after in return." There was no reply from John, just a quiet sniffle as he held her head to his chest. "I love you."
"Atlas, love." John said quietly, taking a light hold of her wrists. "Take your hands down." There was a long drawn out moment where she only sobbed into the palms of her hands. Eventually, she dropped her hands, her eyes closed before eventually opening. Her face was covered in messy tears, her face red. "Alright. It's alright." Her breathing was still patchy, coming in short bursts that made her throat dry. "Breathe." Sherlock moved to sit crossed legged aswell, just being there if she needed it. "Breathe, with me. In and out. In and out. Okay, it's okay." Gently, John moved his hands to her shoulders as she sobbed. "In and out."
She tucked her hands under her armpits in a nervous habit. She gave a sniffle but then Redbeard came trotting up to her and nuzzled at her.
"Sherlock," John said sternly, shutting the other man up. "I'm trying really hard to not overstimulate her brain right now."
Just as she was putting her tea bag into her yellow mug the light switched on and she jumped about five feet in the air.
ATLAS woke up with a start, the artificial lights grated against the headache threatening to raise from her neck. She looked up, with no recollection of what had happened. Sedated most likely. She was only held to the wall by her wrists, a piece of rope skillfully knotted.
"No, course not. Your my dads; one of whom is a detective and at some point probably read up on all there is to know;" She eyed up Sherlock. "and the other is a doctor who worked in a war where I have no doubt there were females and is now a GP. And like I said, your my dads, I don't have a mum to talk to it about, so I just have to deal with it. Even though it's not difficult." Atlas said exsasperatedly, before smirking the Holmes smirk and looking at John. For a moment both of them felt proud. Proud of themselves for managing to do this. Proud of themselves that their daughter trusted them enough to tell them.
"How about these?" Atlas asked, holding up a box of brightly coloured lights that were battery pack lights. This was good as for most of the plugs in the flat had already been commandeered in one way or another.
"Because you just did one of the kindest things I have ever witnessed," Sammy said with a bright smile.
Atlas had now been reduced to sobs and curled herself into the tightest ball he'd ever seen in the corner of the room. All that fight had gone and every so often she flinched and whimpered in pain.
"Do you need the-" But he found himself cut off by Atlas' unsteady coughing. He slipped the oxygen mask over her face before she shuffled back against him.
Atlas then checked through her emails where she was always having new homework and other things popping up. They were empty and just as she was going to switch it off, she had a thought. She hadn't sifted through her personal emails in a while. Clicking on it she checked through her Microsoft account and found that there was ntohing of importance. Then, she remembered her Gmail and she checked through that aswell. As she was nearing the bottom her eyes caught sight of something peculiar. An email from an unknown source.
"Your out of the major red for the poison." Doctor Aduba informed before he frowned. "Are you okay?"
"Sorry to disappoint," Mycroft whispered. "I'm guessing this all just becoming a little overwhelming. Am I right?"
"Would you like to play cards?" Sherlock asked, patting her knee but she frowned and shook her head. "Come on would you like to talk to us about it all?"
"Because marriage is something I can't understand." Sherlock said quickly in return. "I've tried and I've tried some more. And each time it's more confusing." Sherlock said. He wanted to tell John the truth but it was as if the small amount of EQ he had left was telling him that he wasn't allowed to.
"Slow down," Sherlock said coming over and holding John's wrist as it reached into the drawer. "What's wrong?" John looked at him but just pulled his wrist out of Sherlock's grip.
Atlas shook her head laughing. "No, I don't believe we are Papa. At least, I don't think we are. Imagine dad's his several time great grandson or something. That would be funny. A mass murderer and fighters of mass murderer's in the same family."
"Because your you...and through no fault of your own, you have been served a pretty big handful of rubbish." John sighed as he looked at her.
JOHN'S talk was beginning to draw to a close when Atlas finally brought up the courage to look him in the eye. The look lingered a moment before it broke and she sighed. He was doing a similar talk to Lower Sixth after lunch and he'd already said that he would pick her up this evening and drop her with the others at the library. She hadn't understood
"If your doing transvenous implant, knock her out. I know it's not procedure but she's got CPTSD," Sherlock said.
"Of course you can, Sam," John said before Sammy burst into tears and found himself gathered into John's arms.
Rosie hugged Atlas' legs before hugging Timothy's. John and Sherlock came over and joined in the celebration. John's parents stood looking confused as their eyes flashed over the dark haired girl.
"I know," Atlas nodded, blinking and looking at her knees. "It's just hard." And then she looked away as one tear escaped her left eye.
And everytime it either ended up with her having to forgive her dad all over again or just needing to hug him. It really could be either. Swiftly, she jumped thought again.
"Do you want to sing your hair brushing song?" Sherlock asked Rosie before they started to sing together.
"I did Maths, Music, English and Biology." Atlas smiled, before looking at the ground. "I would have done it in Politics too but my teacher sort of hated me, and unfortunately the same applied for my history class."
"She was saving your dad from a woman who aimed a shot at him. Your mother, being the woman she was jumped infront of it."
"This is why you and Sherlock win best parenting award," Isla smiled in the other room, John shaking his head as he waited for the kettle.
"Rosie." Sherlock said getting out his seat and lifting her up. "What're you doing up?" She giggled into his neck as she tickled her tummy.
"Not for us to say." John answered. "Asking her will only make it worse." Wanda did her scowl before Timothy told her to leave them be.
"Let her in Sherlock. You know fine well she's not a client. If she was a client I would have said 'Sherlock! You have another one.' But did I say that?" Mrs Hudson said somewhat sassily. Her hands drawing to her waist, here eyes meeting Sherlock's beaten look. "No. I didn't think I had."
"A man. You are a man. You should be with a woman, not some man." John's father said clapping a hand to his shoulder. "Don't be a faggot." He then whispered as he walked away. Little did he know but someone in the corner quietly observed. Neither Atlas or Sherlock paid much heed from where they were, lip movements were never their forte. But over by the sofa, one little girl watched as her father was called one horrible thing. Her face screwed up, mortified.
"Hey, hey," Sherlock said quietly looking back at her. She sighed loudly as she shut her eyes in exhaustion.
"Do you want me or dad to take you?" John asked her but she only buried further into Sherlock. "Looks like you have been nominated." John said smiling at his partner who lifted Rosie up and took her to bed, Jeff still clutched tightly in her hand. Atlas took the moment and put her book down and cuddled into John.
"Dad used to take me on road trips over to Loch Ness and into Ullapool, Fort William, Mallaig, Ardnamurchan, Aviemore. We spent a week in Aberdeenshire and Moray and kayaked on the Spey." Atlas said. "And then you know..."
"Of which you have three others at home," Atlas giggled before Sherlock pulled her to his chest in a sweet embrace. "Papa's bringing my medication and then we're going to Angelo's."
"Sure does," Sammy nodded as he entered with three second-hand vinyl. "But I also wanted to get her Bach's Solo Cello Collection which also has some violin cello duets." He said with a smile, before pausing. "If-if that's alright?"
"I understand that." John smiled. "They've been looking into what caused the initial seizure and all of her previous ones."
"Ida Atlas Elizabeth Watson-Holmes!" Sherlock thundered, Atlas' head snapping to look at him. "Do as your asked!"
"I thought you were supposed to be smart." Mary-Anne stated simply before standing from her bed, whatever she was doing seemingly disappearing as she moved towards the glass. It was now that Atlas realised she had inherited very little from her mother, another woman of intellect, but as for looks, there was nothing in common. "Maybe I should be glad I left."
After some time Sherlock stood, chasing the dog back into his bed in the living room. Atlas followed Sherlock as he lay down in his bed, Rosie lying down at his side. Atlas climbed in too at they all lay there. Each one feeling numb in their own way as they lay on the bed.
"I know you won't." Atlas replied smiling to Sherlock as he stroked hair out of her eyes. Her breathing was as normal as you would expect for someone who was trying to stay alive after being shot. However, her humor was in tact as Mycroft and John arrived.
"Okay," Sherlock said as he placed her in the cage but not before kissing her head and placing her in it. "Where to next?"
"No. No, you haven't love." John said walking to him and holding his arms. "We'll figure something out."
This little kid who had so much to give and do, she is everything to me. Just as you and Rosie and Sam and the dog are but Atlas has meant everything to me for sixteen years," Sherlock said quietly and then he looked down. "Sorry, you mean a lot to me too just, Atlas has always meant every-"
"HURRY up." Sherlock whisper shouted to Atlas who was still at the top of the stairs in the flat. She grabbed her jacket and hauled it on, memories of what had happened over the past four days shoved to the back of her mind. She traded carefully down the stairs until she nearly ran straight into her dad, who was standing on the second from bottom step. Looking down at where Jem was lying curled on the bottom step.
ATLAS was stood in the dark with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders, Whisper clutched in her hand, a cracked glass picture, held in the other. Before her, John slept and she saw the cast on his arm and a chill ran through her bones. She did that.
"Mary knew." Sherlock said. "Knew I was gay." They walked over to a park bench and took a seat, directly below a street lamp. "I...I thought you were straight. You kept saying 'not gay', and it sounds stupid but everytime you uttered those words it hurt. It would come and go but..."
"Alright. I forgive you for whatever it is your apologising for. But if your apologising about this, don't you dare." John said rubbing with his thumbs. "Your allowed to be upset."
"Okay." Atlas said before approaching her uncle. With an impulse she hugged him tightly and Mycroft seemed somewhat taken aback. "Thank you for saving my life."
"We've run out of granola." Atlas supplied, assessing her purple and yellow tie with scrutiny before tightening it. The uniform had been posted to 221B in the last two days and it wasn't too strict. They could wear black jeggings/jeans (or skirt) with either a polo shirt or shirt and tie. Then they could also have a blazer. Atlas being her father's daughter obviously went for a blazer and tie, a pair of black jeans to finish off. She liked it, it made her feel clever.
"I'm just about to leave with Sammy, love," Sherlock smiled. "Mycroft and the rest are coming by this evening to see you and we'll be home. I spoke to the doctors and they said you'll be allowed a little bit of takeaway pizza and we'll just have a bit of fun. Alright?"
"I don't want to be on the call," Atlas said quietly before walking past Wanda and going to the cupboard for some cereal.
"Sherlock," John said looking at his husband. "I never asked, did you know you were having a little girl?"
"Yes." Rosie replied before she looked back out the window as Atlas paid at the pump and hopped back in to the passenger seat.
"Sorry." Sherlock squeaked before John just launched his lips against his husbands. Smiling into the kiss he pulled away and looked at Sherlock. Staying like that a few moments, Sherlock was just about to suggest that John climb off of him when the older man spoke.
"Well, I have been making unicorn cupcakes with Sammy and Mycroft and...and...Isla and Jojo and Aunty Harry," Rosie smiled as she looked at John, Sherlock's arm going around her waist.
"Dad, you look just like you did when I was little," Atlas grinned walking over and hugging him. He gave a grin and kissed the crown if her head.
"Who are you on the phone to?" Mycroft asked as Rosie changed the view back to selfie mode before propping it up on a glass of water. "Oh."
"Oh. It definitely will. They emailed me again yesterday saying they were willing to let her study maths aswell, so long as she put the hours in at home. Something about their attainment, how it would look, how the college could develop for advanced learners. I don't know." He sighed, his hands going up before crossing in front of his chest.
"No," John said, rubbing her back. "I don't know sweetheart." Before Sherlock got to his feet and took out his phone, snapping a photo of a confused looking Atlas and John.
"Yeah, I know." Wanda frowned. "But I just don't know what we do about that. She's frightened of having to ask her dads to come home and them being mad at her but I think she's also frightened that they won't come back at all."
"Of course she does." Timothy smiled. "As much as Sherlock loves Rosie, as much as you love Sherlock, as much as I love Wanda."
"It means..." Atlas said walking over to Mycroft. "That if Sherlock was going to go missing, he would have done so by now. And I'm assuming, that he didn't register with the phone number that Mycroft no doubt set up."
"Why did you come?" The woman sat on the bed asked. She was sat cross legged looking her back to the pair of them as Atlas looked up at Sherlock expectantly.
"Okay." Atlas contentedly sighed before she looked back over to Rosie. "Morning Jo." Atlas smiled at her, reminding everyone in the room to her being in there.
"It was, wasn't it?" Sherlock grinned as they made their way to the graveyard. Atlas nodded before they approached the gates to the graveyard. Taking a deep breath, she looked at her dad carefully.
"If it's any justification," Peter mumbled from where he sat on the other side of John. "Neither am I."
"And you make me...so happy, John Watson-Holmes. And you make me brave, and so, wonderfully, wonderfully happy." Sherlock smiled. "And I need go tell you that, I could never - can never live without you."
"But not before breakfast," Mycroft smiled before the four of them got to their feet. Swooping up Rosie she giggled. "Now, Rosamund, me and Aunty Eurus brought croissants with us from the bakery. Would you care for one?"
- and Atlas and Sammy had been chatting in her room. The clock was approaching 7 and Rosie would soon be being chased off to bed.
"Alright?" Sherlock asked gently as he touched her other arm. She gave a quick nod, before the needle was removed and the nurse was standing before her.
"Rosie. Rosie." Sherlock said nudging her slightly. "Rosie, your dreaming." This time her stroked hair out of her eyes and her eyes darted open. Her breathing was fast as she looked around the room, Sherlock taking a seat next to her.
"ATLAS." John said before ripping off the lid of the coffin. "Atlas." And then he stopped. A blue body that looked like Atlas was peacefully sleeping. He pulled her out with a heave, a cry escaping from his throat. He ran his hand over the sides of her face, slapping them quietly.
"Yeah," John said as he pulled away and held her arms. "You wanting to see your mum's grave?" He raised an eyebrow.
"Okay," Sherlock said gently before he pulled Sammy out of the hug and put his hands either side of his face. "I love you."
"Lie down." And again the well behaved dog did so, his face almost grinning in his eagerness to please.
Her panicked expression faltered. "That's it." Pause. "My dear Rosamund Mary Watson, what goes on in that big mind of yours?"
"Okay," Isla said as John filled a green hot water bottle up before opening the cupboard to the flasks, finding them and filling.
Mrs Hudson soon joined Atlas in the kitchen which was visable from the living room. The two parents had now stopped in the living room as they watched a dark curly haired girl place mugs on the counter. Briefly they caught sight of her eye colour and were surprised to see that she was exactly like their son, Sherlock.
"They won't hear it Sherlock." John smirked, waiting for the other man to look up from the book. When he did, his face fell before brightening into a colourful smile. There, before him, his children slept, hugged up against John after Sherlock took more control of the reading. Sherlock gave a quiet laugh before leaning over Atlas to gently peck John.
ONCE meals had been eaten, the family departed leaving the Society, Rosie, John, Sherlock and Redbeard to enjoy an evening in.
"Atlas." Sammy whispered, a lump caught in his throat. He gave a little cry as they both buried their noses in each others faces.
"Yes." John said quietly. "Our little girls." Gently getting to his feet, he picked up Rosie off John's lap and lay her down in bed.
"Sorry. Wasn't really my place." She said quietly, looking back up to meet the boys gaze. "Bit not good." She said under her breath. However, the boy looked at her evidently knowing.
"I'm sorry," Atlas said in a voice that sounded desperate and heartbroken. Her tears flowing freely and snot building up on his shirt. "You didn't sign up for this."
"Your hands and arms are jerking and so are your legs, I can feel them through the floor," John said to her as it started to get worse. "Come on, on the floor." He got out of his seat and stood by her. "Come on." Rolling her eyes she put herself on the floor then looked at him through hooded lashes.
"We can't drive there." Sherlock said, just as Atlas was approaching their car. "John might need the car. He said something about walking Redbeard with Rosie."
"Blue." Atlas said quietly to Sherlock who walked over to her after selecting the cream colour for the spare bedroom. Sherlock stood by her and analysed the potential dark blues. She picked up a selection of Azure blues going down the numbers till she settled on a dark royal blue.
Atlas pulled away, sniffing as she wiped at John's shoulder as if there were some sort of indivisible dust on it.
"Atlas!" Rosie screamed as she came inside. Her face was streaked in tears from her non-stop crying and she wailed some more. "At! At! Atlas!" She sobbed as she ran towards her, Jeff flinging around in her hand. "Atlas." And just as she was about to jump up onto Atlas, she stopped. Quiet consideration.
Then the riff became developed and deeper. Sherlock could hear the use of the G7 as Atlas sang her way through the chorus.
"I'm sorry, Rosie, I don't follow." Jo said as Rosie inspected the soldier she was planning to dip into the egg.
"Samuel Alexander Walters Watson-Holmes," Sammy said, trying it out on his tongue. "It's quite long."
"That was pretty good," John laughed and Atlas nodded before she looked up at him. She nodded before she smiled again.
"Yeah!" Atlas exclaimed before she scrambled over the floor to sit against the bed waiting expectantly for her uncle and dad to sit down. They made a circle, Atlas had a blanket wrapped around her shoulders.
Once they had left, John sat down on the chair in the kitchen before looking up. "Let's go," He said going to the door. "Come on, Ro, shoes on."
