“Ridges? Castiel, you party animal.” He chuckled some before giving a tug to the bottom of the jacket and raising his eyebrows at Cas. “Is it too much with the t-shirt?”
Meg looked up at him where he sat at the desk.  “And…” she asked with a smile but knew from the tone in his voice that the elder Novak had agreed.
At some point over the summer, Balthazar decided that he was going to start high school officially and wondered if that would force his friend to look inward to himself and his own thoughts and feelings, rather than adopting his fathers. But he had finally done it and all Cas did was stay quiet, which was actually scarier than all of the reactions he had played through in his mind.
Dean’s eyes flickered between Balthazar and Cas a few times before he motioned to Sam his empty bottle and headed to the bar. Chuck looked a little surprised to see him but quickly opened a beer for him. Dean leaned back against the bar as he watched Cas.
“Hey, why haven’t I met Ruby?” Dean asked out of the blue before biting into an apple. Castiel was sitting on the couch reading a book and pretended not to hear while Gabriel flipped through channels mindlessly, one ear on the conversation.
Gabe nodded some still looking down. “I think it started with Adderall. All the late nights studying and Sam was just trying to keep up. It was pretty frequent for a while… but lately it’s been longer gaps of time between with heavier drugs.”  Gabe turned around and looked fucking miserable.  “He has it in his head that they’re a couple which is warped considering she goes days to weeks without talking to him and then pops up long enough to drug him and fuck him.” Gabe sniffed and wiped his nose with the back of his hand.
Dean took the blade away from his throat, moved behind him and shoved him in the direction of the house. Castiel stumbled some before he began to walk to the house taking in the sight of it.  Though it was obviously big there was something still very modest about it. He had a feeling though that Dean still held a large collection, just like his last owner did. When they reached the front door he stepped aside so Dean could enter.  Not wanting to let the angel out of his sight in case he tried something, Dean simply opened the door and gestured for the angel to enter.  Inside Dean turned slightly to put in the security code, keeping it hidden from the angelic being.  "Down the hall." Dean said after the screen flashed the words
Dean stared at her with his teeth clenched some. He wasn't sure if he hated her words because that stupid nickname was catching on or because they came from a mouth that wasn't Cas', as if he was the butt of some joke during an orgy.
Before Castiel pulled into his driveway he already had three missed calls from Balthazar. He paced his room a few times before finally flopping on his bed and checking the voicemails. He braced himself for more insults. Balthazar had every reason to be angry at him. Everything he said was absolutely true and Cas hated himself for it.
seeing him like that and treating him differently because of it gave him a chill and he shivered slightly.  Dean was the warmest most caring person in his life right now which was ironic considering he didn't bring up the past to him tonight at all.
“I don’t…” he cleared his throat some and looked away from Dean trying to say the words. “I don’t casually kiss.”
“Gabe is looking for you,” Dean said simply as he turned around and looked out the windshield. When there was no reply from the backseat so he continued, “He’s really worried about you. He just took off with Sam to try to find you.”
Unable to take the silence anymore, Balthazar took both his hands and shook them a little. “Come on. Dance with me.”
The last line rang out and Dean thought it sounded much more like a threat than the pained version the words held at the beginning of the song.  As the music abruptly ended Cas stood frozen on stage as the wild applause brought him back down.  His eyes darted around for a second in a panic not sure how to transition away from the crowd that was roaring in applause and whistles from every direction.  Just before Dean’s eyes began to roam wondering why Gabe hadn’t stepped out to help his brother, Cas’ eyes fell to the front row and their eyes connected making Dean’s heart pound again. He wanted to roll his eyes at himself for being such a fangirl but couldn’t bring himself to look away.
Dean mumbled something and his eyes fluttered open sleepily. "C-Cas?" He asked softly and confused. Cas pulled his hand back and blushed softly. "I talked to Sam. He told me everything and explained why you left." Dean groaned and pulled his pillow over his head making Cas chuckle some. "You don't need to be embarrassed, Dean. It's no big deal, really."
Meg swallowed and took a step back knowing she would have to let him cool off and talk to him later. “Nothing.” She answered back flatly before looking back at Gabriel. “Trial period. Fine. Send me the details later. I’m outta here.” She turned on her foot and walked to the door making Gabriel wonder if she would even make it to the show date next week.
Castiel kept his eyes on the ceiling but his ears were intent on his handler's words.  He had only been on the market a couple of weeks and the time before this it was more like a couple decades.  He was hoping for that again before he was sold off to the unknown.  Dean couldn't tell, but his whole body had actually tensed at the sound of his approaching footsteps.
Dean snapped his attention away from the window at the sound of his voice and gave a nod. "Yeah. I'm wrapping stuff up too. Thanks for your help."
showed up and he chewed his lip some as he opened the message. The picture of Sam, Charlie, Andy and Dean greeted him and carefully looked at each of their photos. He genuinely did like Charlie and Andy and how welcoming they were toward him since he arrived, and even though he was ready to excuse himself out of the room quickly just nights earlier, he wished he would have been around for whatever was happening here. Sam and Charlie were obviously the silliest with Sam’s hair up and Charlie’s pose, and Andy was such a goofball. But where his eyes landed and couldn’t look away from was Dean. From the angle it was obviously him that had been holding the phone up for the picture but he wasn’t making a face or sticking out his tongue like the others. Just a simple smile while he looked into the camera. Without seeing him for the last couple of days Cas had already forgotten how green his eyes were and he felt himself get butterflies at the way it felt like dean was looking at him even though he told himself that was a completely silly reaction because he was just taking a picture. A few seconds passed as he continued staring at the picture, the thought not even crossing his mind to send a message back, so when his phone chimed again in his hand he jumped a little in his seat.
“Let me see.” Cas’ pen was still moving across the page as Balthazar picked up his notebook from the desk to inspect it closer.
.” Cas held her gaze for a second but Meg could always challenge him right back without wavering. He loosened his grip on the bottle and she pulled it away looking pleased at his giving in.
"C'mon. You know you want to." A female voice said, followed by more giggling. Despite all the shit that was going down, people were still people. End of the world, living and breathing, horny people.
There was a beat as the two looked at each other, then back at Dean.  Meg nodded and gave a solid, “uh huh” and Cas a quick nod with a “yep.”  Dean nodded some like he understood when he completely fucking didn’t and slowly reached out for the door knob pulling it closed until there was a loud click.  Another beat of time passed behind the door before more giggling from Meg followed by Cas’ laughter as well.
Not wanting to kill the vibe they had going, Balthazar forced himself to simmer down some. “Is he here now? I know a way we can make him jealous.” His voice was teasing but Cas rolled his eyes knowing if he said yes, Balthazar would make it happen.
Castiel’s eyes flickered over to the Dean without his head moving and he rolled his eyes before looking up at the ceiling again. “I was just going to hide out for a minute. I didn’t think you’d be leaving so early since you had just ordered beers with Sam. Sorry for the intrusion.” Even though he apologized he made no attempt to get up and exit the car. Dean could see at the other end of the parking lot Gabe’s car was just pulling out.  He pulled his phone out of his pocket and pushed a button with his thumb making it light up and show the time, but he hesitated, deciding not to unlock it and allowing the phone to go dark again.  He set it on the seat letting curiosity get the best of him as he looked at Cas and made no attempt to text Sam and Gabe to let them know he had found Cas.
Dean jumped up without a word to get the drink, not even annoyed at Lisa's disinterest in him. Was Cas really enjoying whatever comments were being whispered into his ear by Meg? He took a glass of punch and downed it quickly before resting on the edge of the table, trying to control his breathing. His jealousy. Over what though? The fact that his date was actually into him and Dean might as well have shown up alone? No. That didn't feel like it. But that stabbing feeling was still there gnawing at him. He downed another cup full of punch before grabbing one to take back to Lisa, scolding himself mentally for being jealous at all.
He scowled, mumbling a "don't hold your breath," that he wasn't sure she heard and headed back to his paper work, attempting to bury himself in it. And if he could have stopped thinking about orgies and Cas and Jane plus two walking out of his cabin this morning, he might have been successful.
The boy pulled the pillow off his face slowly and looked at where Dean sat on the bed for a long moment as if contemplating his answer. Dean gave a light smile that said
“-stretch your legs a bit after being trapped in the car for so long? Of course!” Sam interrupted hastily.
Cas nodded slightly like he understood that. “Looked like you guys had a good time tonight.” Cas said giving a small smile as they looked up at Dean and remembered the picture. He had friends back home but they didn’t take a lot of pictures and goof off the way most people did. Thinking about it now he wasn’t sure if he wished they had made more memories like that or if he was glad they didn’t because having the pictures would hurt now that they were so far away. His smile fell and he looked back down to the fork that he flipped over again.
Castiel wasn’t surprised by his answer. He wouldn’t have come this far if he had wanted to stay. But he was sure that the stopping had more to do with his possessions that were left behind at the mansion. They had confiscated his phone before shooting began and there was no way he had enough money on his person to do much once he got to a phone. He was stuck. And while Cas knew that saying as much to get him to realize that might work on another dumb suitor in the past, he could tell Winchester was different. More stubborn for sure. Point out an observation so directly would probably be an open challenge to have him hitchhike all the way home to Kansas. He went for a different approach instead. He thought for half a second before deciding to go with helpless.
“C’mon, you know I was only teasing you. But now I’ll stop, because I like you enough to leave you alone when you’re being a piss baby.”
And he’s holding it out, the box, he’s opening and taking the tie and coat, leaves the mixtape alone.
Still, that doesn’t mean he has to like it when he’s reminded of being the odd one out first thing in the morning, squished between Zach, the head of IT, and Gabriel’s arguments, while Balthazar and Bela compare last night’s shenanigans. Not even Becky, the receptionist, bothers to raise her head long enough to acknowledge his good morning with more than a hum.
He grimaced: “Not exactly, it has more to do with being trapped in a metal box twenty feet from the ground than
Except that what restrains the angel is not so much as a sense of duty as is a fierce protectiveness towards his kin, and a bone-deep love for a father whose voice he can't remember anymore.
And now, with college just a summer away and fall right around the corner, he’d made it his mission to recruit them all at least once a week for a (not so) friendly game of good, ol’ American football.
Cassandra works at the library, volunteers every other weekend to read to the kids, then talks about it with Dean when they go out for coffee on Sundays.
“Well, he told it like it is, Walker” Dean said, “besides, kid worked for Crowley all day, he needs a break.”
“I think,” I murmured, head leaning more and more towards his, “I think that wit and pleasantness may be innate, but your brother’s kindness, his confidence- that’s probably been all you, Dean.”
He can see it unravel on Sam’s face, as he begins to take in her hair, and her eyes and the shape of her mouth, just like Dean has.
I wanted nothing more than to shake Sam, tell him to stop questioning his own happiness so much, that if anyone deserved a sappy, typical high school romance that was him, so he should just stop getting in his own way, but in the car, as we were approaching home, Dean beat me to it.
That doesn't stop him from nearly having a panic attack when he realizes that he's been noticed, and he's being approached, and- fuck.
It was my father to put an end to it, who explained how my mother hadn’t left me of her own volition, but had died, and how very different the two things were.
I shrugged: “Said something about finding his true call, I’m sure it was either pastry or porn, but I didn’t catch which.”
Bu they were nice, for some time, when everyone had just started drinking and singing whatever cheesy hit they could think of.
, as Dean had called it, was to climb up the ferris wheel, stay ten minutes dangling in the old thing.
“But speaking of distractions, I saw the golden boy, coming in. He was parking at the Roadhouse, could be headed here, next.”
Dean laughs: "Yeah, kind and also possibly a serial killer, I get it. But I'm only just heading south, I swear. Wouldn't mind company."
In the whirlwind of clothes and friendly mocking, I noticed a redhead in a bright blue one piece approach me.
“Oh. In that case, you’ll have to come back when he’s here. He handles all hand delivered business himself, keeps the packages in a storage I don’t have access to.”
And of course, Sam takes that to heart, ensures him they’re going to do just that, that he’s going to encourage it, whatever it is.
There is a certain anticipation, in the mark Castiel feels burning on his arm, seems to forget about it as he holds Anna close to his chest, because he had lost her, then got her back only to have her watch him die. And come back, apparently.
She thumbs the pictures, explains the story, starts reading bits and pieces of it in between plot points.
Castiel looked at him with a tilt of his head, the one he did when he couldn't quite comprehend the situation- like the thousands jokes he didn't get and pop culture references he never understood and that one time Dean had leaned in, whispered something: things he couldn't wrap his head around for lack of knowledge, or lack of faith.
They leave, fall in love a thousand times again with the night and all the things it carries on its back, but the things is.
Looking back, morbid would have been more accurate, or a reckless marketing strategy at the very least.
“You - you alone will have the stars as no one else has them...” she recites, “...In one of the stars, I shall be living. In one of them, I shall be laughing.”
“I never got to be a father,” he’d said on their graduation day, “but I did end up with a bunch of pain in the ass kids anyway.”
It was past two in the morning when Dean stumbled home, with heavy steps and an even heavier tongue.
He buys a bottle of scotch, downs it sitting on the ground next to the car, and waits for the sun to go down.
“Just so you know,” Gabriel said, “I’m actually named after an archangel, you little hell munchkin.”
Castiel shrugs: "I am actually quite familiar with Beethoven's works, my mother was fond of him. Led Zeppelin, on the other hand, I never had the opportunity to branch through."
He wants to explain himself, say he’s sorry Sammy is stuck with this mess, but instead just mutters that he needs more time.
None of my siblings had been present for that: Michael and Luc no longer at home, Anna and Gabriel lost somewhere in the house.
“Oh, please. You shouldn’t believe everything you hear.” Balthazar turns back to the camera, looks around before continuing. “There’s no gangs, no jail. He is married.”
“Okay, rugrats, let’s get over this one more time. Just because I agreed to snoop you in doesn’t mean I trust you to do this right.”
Or when Gordon Walker was found drunk and snoring the evening away in what little remained of the haunted house, after being dared to go in.
He finally allowed himself to look, the hands still clutching his arms moving to his neck, holding even tighter.
That was also the first time I was allowed in my father’s office, up my father’s plush, deep red, leather chair, on my father’s knee- his handkerchief softly drying any tears I had left.
"I wanted to give you something" he stuttered on his words, looking down as he reached into his pocket.
Only coffee turns into a movie and that turns into dinner and he can't really say how the hell he got himself in this situation but here he is.
“You’re one to talk, Hamlet. Alright, couple extras for you dwarves: no yelling obscenities, no funny business, no jerking around in the river, the guys going before you are gonna wait and take you out immediately because, if you drown, Anna is going to have my head for breakfast and my balls for dinner,
After they've put the Devil back in its cage, they kiss the blood off each other's lips, and everybody is there to witness it.
I never had a mother, not even any real memories of her, but I’d always had Anna, never having to learn the difference between the two.
“Actually,” I began “I’ve signed a confidentiality contract, and am not allowed to this kind of disclosure.”
I shivered unconsciously, slightly enough that if anyone noticed they would have thought it was because of the wind.
Anna had always been the only family I’d needed, though; Dean Winchester, so many years later, would be the first one I wanted.
Years later, as I would, I’d realize it had been for the best, for when you do, you’re most likely to never get up again.
And there's blue and resignation, green and panic: above all, there's tiredness and the restless recognition that however this ended up, they wouldn't let go.
Everything was a buzz from then on, people arguing over who should go first, and Benny and Ash trying to shove each other off the bridge before their time was due.
"I don't have anything though…" and it was as if he had just woken up, still dulled by sleep, and realized he had committed the worst crime imaginable.
And this girl is wonderful, looks at him amused but doesn't really mind that she's the one doing all the talking.
I did not act on it, not at first at least, didn’t even fully comprehend the strong desire to feel closer, cover her lips and her hands with my lips and my hands.
Bobby Singer had coached Little League for eleven years, before getting particularly attached to a specific batch of overactive kids and ending up stuck with them and a job at the local high school.
In the background, Sam and Jess were sharing tender glances; Benny had arrived with a cooler full of soda and Ash in tow.
So, in under three hours Dean has learned that his name is Castiel, because his parents were, apparently, religious freaks, and he has next to zero knowledge of anything Dean's stereo is playing.
When they finally draw back, Dean brings a hand to Cas’s face, brushes his knuckles against Cas’s cheek.
But Anna watches him, eyes deeper than he'd cared to remember, and says: "Castiel, there was nothing
Dean rolled his eyes: “Gracious my ass,” then winked at me, “what do you say, Cas? Up for an adventure?”
When he goes to bed, that night, he opens the drawer where he hides his secret stack of liquor and it’s empty.
I could tell you about the way color had drained from Cas's eyes, the loud thump of his corpse against the ground, the even louder wail Dean let out; I could tell you about the sun shying away from its rightful rise, at the sight of him still kneeled beside Castiel, or I could tell you about the funeral, the way he gently tucked his feet inside the sheets, breath caught in his throat and his chest and just anywhere but his mouth; and I could tell you how Dean, from that, never really came back, of the feather inked across his heart and the one he hides under his pillow.
Kevin shrugged, threw more popcorn into his mouth: “Speaking of, where is he? I feel like with him here I’d actually win this argument.”
That, in a child, obviously translated in glossy eyes and trembling lips, and the utmost mortification of every family member I had left.
He falls asleep in baby’s backseat, curled up on himself; when he gets home, in the morning, Sam smiles at him.
“And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night...You - only you - will have stars that can laugh.”
I glared: “I’m barely two years younger than you. And will probably graduate before you do anyways, so I don’t think the
From its tan walls to the soft, worn leather couch to whatever smell radiated from Mary’s kitchen- more often than not, it was pie.
Sunlight poured onto the kitchen floor, catching the hair below his knees, so fair to be barely visible.
Or when Dean chased after Lisa Braeden’s skirt, not bothering to come back a minute earlier than when he’d have to take Sam back home.
It’s a video from a few months ago, around Christmas time. He’s in his living room, clearly fumbling to get the camera at a right angle.
So, obviously, when the time came, I kissed Meg- just, I made the mistake of not jumping right away, of turning to her, and glimpse at the look she was wearing: like I had just broke her heart.
And it was heartfelt and genuine, shining right through his eyes and making Dean release the sigh he hadn't realized he'd been holding.
"No, no, you didn't have to. You-" it was hard for him, Cas knew, but he also knew he needed to get this out, whatever it was, so he let him be, and just listened "You always say what you think, what you feel. I've always admired that about you, how unafraid you are."
And then, because Dean is so righteous and mr. Blue Eyes could very well be nicknamed mr. Hot Stuff, he offers him a ride. Which he declines.
“You know how this place is called Heaven, and nobody really knows why. We make assumptions, sure, but the truth, you see… They say there was this guy travelling across the country years ago, eventually settled here in Kansas, he used to say- it was as close to home as he could get. He strolled in here on an ol’ Chevrolet Impala, a full beard and haunted eyes- you could tell, he’d seen things, that one. Not necessarily all pleasing, too.
So, of course, half an hour later I was sever feet from the ground, shifting in the worn, bug-chugged wooden seats.
Gabriel is unconscious on the floor, and the stranger who has the lights flickering around looks at the dagger in his chest with a smirk playing on his lips.
Castiel is in Pontiac, now, Jimmy tells him. So Dean spends a month getting drunk enough to find the courage to start the engine and so much that Sam has to force him away from the Impala before he drives in a ditch.
The windows are rolled down, the wind flowing through Cas' unkempt hair, the sun making its way across his throat. Dean watches him, scoffs:
I knew, but somehow, hearing it in my head wasn’t as effective as letting her voice lull me into the realm of possibilities.
And then I was under, head below the water and Dean’s hands sliding across my shoulders, squeezing to keep me there a second longer.
“What? It’s true! Y’all know ‘bout that Chuck guy, a weird little dude with a taste for alcohol and too much time and money on his hands. Hell, you called it when he eloped with Ms. Rosen, Barnes!”
“It wasn’t a forest, exactly. It happened when we were still back in New York, and Anna used to spend any given afternoon in Central Park, looking for new corners to paint and sketch. One day, we got lost, and our father had to call the police. Anna was distraught, she’d been so scared something might have happened to me, but I only remember being tired. I was with her, so I felt safe no matter what.”
It was so soft, so inviting, but he couldn't, he wouldn't will himself to look at him and know he never would be allowed to again.
It’s still sunny out when he makes it outside the terminal. He spots Dean instantly, coming through the door in his uniform, looking around until he sees him. He smiles, and all Castiel can do is drop his suitcase, his umbrella and his jacket. They fall to the ground in a silent thump as he runs to Dean, who immediately wraps his arms around him, sweeps him off the ground for a few seconds, while Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair, keeps him as close as possible.
“I am kind of a geography genius, before my family moved here, I memorized the map of the city, and now it’s here, sculpted in my memory forever. It’s not a really useful talent, except for the fact that I practically have a perfect sense of orientation. It came particularly in handy when me and my sister got lost in the woods.”
He’s not an idiot, he knows he’s not imagining things, connecting dots and finding similarities that are not there, that he would find suspicious, was he not so desperate for something, anything to cling to.
I sighed, kept scrolling through dozens of dusty pages: “Contact information of Mark of Cain Co., a cutlery and beekeeping independent company.”
I huffed, glared at them: “You know, just because you’re Gabriel’s best friend doesn’t mean you have to be as insufferable as him.”
Like that angry bee in my backyard when I was eight: despite the pain, I couldn’t really blame it for not knowing better.
I felt guilty, as if her departure had somehow been my fault, and I could feel it, that guilt, eating at my young, tender flesh, threatening to devour me out of existence.
And Charlie laughing along with Kevin over something or another, Jo and Sam tucked in a corner trading kisses- how
Dean pushed himself up and swung his legs over the bar, scooting his ass across to the other side. He settled onto a barstool and sipped at his whiskey. God it felt good to sit down, even with the loud, Gabriel-induced debauchery going on on the dance floor, he thought.
Dean sucked in a breath. He hadn’t exactly always toed the line when it came to the law. There were some lean times when John was too deep in his depression and alcoholism to hold down a job. Before Bobby noticed and helped him out, well let’s just say the five finger discount fed Sam on several occasions. Thankfully he hadn’t gotten into running drugs or anything worse than shoplifting, but he doesn’t doubt he might have if things had not turned around.
He’d been a single dad for the better part of ten years, but it still hurt. It still hurt when Ben’s teachers looked at him with a mixture of pity and judgement. He could see the unspoken words in their minds - ‘Poor kid, too bad he lost his mom so young. She’d never let him get away with this/never let this happen.’
Dean watched the relief literally flood over Cas’s face. Before he knew what he was doing, he had wrapped Gabriel in a bear hug.
He sighed. He refused to break out Batman for this. Ellen had talked him into taking an extra-long Halloween weekend shift at the gay bar across town. Halloween fell on a Saturday and one of their staff had quit so they were desperate. He’d bartended there from time to time before but never on Halloween. Tips were good and he’d even scored a few hookups. Although he typically dated women, Dean had been openly bi since his late teens. He just hadn’t been serious with anyone since Lisa, really.
Castiel pressed his thumb and forefinger to the bridge of his nose and pinched himself.  He reminded himself to breathe.  He mentally counted backwards from twenty.  Castiel reached down and helped hoist Dean to his feet, snatched the journal from his hand, and handed him his crutch.  Counting hadn’t helped.  He leaned in to Dean’s space and glared at him.
Dean turned to look at Cas. “What the hell, man?” he asked. Cas just tilted his head and looked at him. “Where did you even come from?”
Dean considered that.  He felt selfish and terribly guilty at the hope that threatened to swell up in his chest.
Novak silenced him with a look. “We also have the discretion to use our own judgement in the case of first-time offenses,” he said. “Need I remind you of the policy I helped write and of who our largest alumni donor is?” he said the last part in what Dean thought of as a dangerous whisper.
Dean sighed.  “Well, it’s not typical to hang out in your drawers around people you don’t know well.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Cas said. He started to close the door behind him. “Goodnight Dean.” Cas shut the door and walked up the steps to his house without turning back.
“Do you normally do ALL of your laundry at once?” Dean asked.  He snuck a peak at Cas’s face, careful to keep his eyes trained on Cas’s.
He was into his third whiskey when he felt someone sit next to him before he saw movement. He glanced to his right. His eyes skipped over gold and black sequins and lots of smooth skin. The Angel - he thought. He turned and met blue eyes that seemed to glow in the dark.
It was over in moments after that.  Sandwiched between Dean and Sam and Bobby and pestered from above by Castiel and MacLain, the bulk of Alistair’s men died quickly.  Those remaining realized it was over and threw down their arms.  They’d take their chances with a judge, Castiel supposed.
Dean lined up the shot and took in a deep breath. He pulled arm back and was ready to shoot on the exhale -
Dean nodded.  He felt a tear slip from the corner of his eye.  He turned from Cas, wiping his cheek on his shoulder.  Cas dropped his hand.
The spotlight trained on a single figure on the stage.  Gabriel was dressed in a Santa costume including beard and hat.  The twist was his assless red leather pants.  That was an image Dean was never going to get out his mind, he thought.
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean swore and collapsed on top of Castiel.  Castiel felt his breath as he panted against his neck, coming down from his high.  He embraced Dean loosely, soothing his hands up Dean’s back and releasing his legs, dropping them back onto the bed.  When Dean had caught his breath he pushed up and rolled off of Castiel, flopping back to lie next to him.
Dean hummed around Cas’s cock and bobbed his head faster. He reached down and started stroking himself.
Castiel forgot how to breathe.  He froze as Dean placed a hand on the back of his head, drawing him in.  Dean noticed he wasn’t reciprocating, dropped his hand and leaned back a few inches.
Dean knew Ben was away at summer camp and wouldn’t be back for another week.  But he still double-checked his room and made sure that all the blinds in the house were closed.  He felt like an idiot.
“Good. Enough time for dessert.” Cas said, his voice dropping into his lowest register on the word ‘dessert.’
“I do appreciate what you have done for Ben, but that’s not what Halloween was about, okay?”  Dean cringed inwardly at the pleading note in his voice.  Well shit, all or nothing, he thought.
Castiel lost himself in the feeling of kissing and rutting against Dean.  He didn’t notice Dean had been trying to get his attention until he felt a yank at the back of his hair.  Castiel allowed Dean to pull his head up from where he’d been sucking his neck and glared at him.  “What?!” he demanded.
Dean lost himself in the sensation of Cas’s mouth, hands and tongue on him.  He groaned at the feeling of Cas’s tongue on his balls and then nearly came when Cas sucked him back down, moaning around his dick.  He pulled his hands free of the t-shirt and pushed Cas off.
Dean turned away from Cas.  He snagged his discarded pants with a toe and drug them close enough to grab.  He busied himself with struggling to get his pants on.
Cas sighed and Dean knew he’d won.  He pressed forward to kiss Cas, threading his hand through Cas’s soft hair.  Cas opened to him, reaching to grasp Dean by the hip with his free hand as their kiss became heated.  Dean took the knife from Cas’s other hand.  He pulled back to set it gently on the sideboard.  Dean slid his hand down from where it was cradling Cas’s head to grasp his hand and lead him to the bed in the dark.
“Well the contractor says there’s asbestos in the original material and we’ll have to vacate while they’re removing the stuff.”
Dean had tried reasoning with Cas.  He tried yelling.  He tried bribing him with unspeakable favors.  When none of that worked, he tried begging.  No matter how much Dean insisted, Castiel refused to carry a gun.
“C’mon, Cas, I think given the situation the Hippocratic Oath is more of a suggestion, right?  I mean you shouldn’t set yourself up for harm, right?  Dean cajoled.
Cas’s eyes widened when he saw the shirt, slashed just enough to reveal a bit of Dean’s collarbone in one spot and the top of his hip in another. Dean felt himself smirk at Cas’s reaction.
He watched Cas swallow.  Long, quiet seconds ticked by and they just stared at each other.  Finally Cas cleared his throat.
Castiel prodded gently at the area around the bone.  The man groaned.  The tall man made to grab Castiel’s hands from their work but Sheriff Singer held him back.  “Get him out of here.” Castiel said.  Bobby pulled the protesting brother back into the front room and Castiel got to work.
Dean meets Cas for Valentine's Day.  Unfortunately, they get caught but the one person who can screw up their happy ending.
Before he had time to be embarrassed, though, Cas was releasing him, pulling back and sliding out the door.
Dean pushed the button on his stereo.  He watched as Cas tilted his head, probably trying to place the song.
Castiel laid himself down opposite Dean.  Dean turned on his side and kissed Castiel, trailing his left hand down Castiel’s chest to his hip.  Castiel fumbled with the button on Dean’s trousers.  Once unbuttoned, Dean rolled onto his back and lifted his hips so Castiel could help him shed the rest of his clothing.
Dean moaned and threaded his right hand through Castiel’s hair as Castiel mapped his mouth with his tongue.  Castiel let him pull his head back slightly, both men panting.
“What is it now, Gabriel?  Something wrong with the Christmas lights?”  Dean had just been over the day before helping string outdoor lights because Gabriel claimed his bursitis was flaring up.
“Who’s next?” Dean asked, shouting over the noise of the crowd, his curiosity getting the best of him.
Dean walked over to the door just as whoever was on the other side abandoned the doorbell in favor of knocking.  Loudly.
Castiel nodded, trying not to let the tears filling his eyes spill out.  He set his jaw and looked up to meet Dean’s eyes.
That was it.  Dean was fucking done with this dance.  He slapped his hand down on Cas’s desk.  Cas jumped at the force of his hit.
Castiel stopped the bleeding in the man’s shoulder so he could work on the leg and hopefully save it.  It was a compound fracture - a jagged white fragment of tibia protruded through his calf just below the knee.  Even if he lost the leg this man was lucky, Castiel reasoned.  A few inches higher and he’d have severed the femoral artery and he’d be dead where he fell.
“What if we destroy the dam up river and flood the bed?” Cas asked.  “With help, we could flank Alistair and drive them into the canyon,” he continued.  “We could position sharpshooters around the rim of the canyon here - and here,” Cas said touching areas on the map, “and there’d be no escape,” Cas finished.
“Oh shit!” Sam yelled.  He ran toward Dean.  “Dean!  Dean!  Are you okay?”  He crouched down, his worried puppy expression blurry through the tears stinging Dean’s eyes.
Dean entered the office and treated the receptionist to his most charming grin. “Betty!” Dean purred, “Did you do something to your hair? Looking good!”
“That’s it, Cas, c’mon, baby, I got you; I got you.” Cas opened his eyes and met Dean’s once more. “Give it to me, Cas,” Dean said.
Novak’s head snapped up at his voice and he met his eyes again. Dean saw recognition flicker through them.
Castiel looked down.  Dean brought his hand to his chin and tilted his face up so that he could meet his eyes.
Cas closed the journal.  “After that, well - I ran, Dean.  I tried to outrun his ghost and I tried to drown it in whiskey.  I am a Goddamned coward, Dean,” he finished.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the flash of MacLain’s mirror.  The signal!  He thought.  He moved back to the blaster box and checked his watch.  It was time.  Castiel held his breath and depressed the plunger, pushing down with both hands and all his weight.  He counted the seconds backwards from 15 - 15, 14, 13...3, 2, 1.  Castiel felt the blast before he heard it.  He scrambled for Grace’s reigns as the ground trembled beneath them.  She panicked but Castiel moved faster than he thought himself capable of and vaulted onto her back.  Castiel looked back and saw the water start spilling over the crack they’d blown in the rock dam.  He barely touched Grace with his heels and she was off.  He leaned forward and held on for dear life as he raced to the western rim of the canyon.
Cas pressed the keys into his hand.  Dean took the hint and unlocked Baby’s door.  He ushered Cas into the backseat.
“I stopped sleeping,” Cas continued. “I stopped eating. I got really low and I - well I took some pills,” he said.
“Administrative leadership conference at this lovely establishment. And to think, I wasn’t going to come!” Milton said. “Oh, this is too good,” he added. “You are SO fired,” Milton laughed mirthlessly. “I can finally get you out of my school.” He stepped back and before Dean knew what was happening had snapped a picture of them with his cell phone and walked away.
Dean was up to three fingers, pumping and scissoring them into Cas, stretching him, when he must have brushed his prostate.  The noise Cas let out was the hottest thing Dean had ever heard and he had to close his eyes and breathe through his mouth to avoid coming.
“And how do you think you’re gonna get and stay on a horse, ya idjit?  You think me and Sam need to be worrying about you while we’re looking for Alistair?”  Singer bellowed.
“No, I don’t drive. My brother Gabriel usually drops me off on his way home. But tonight he stopped off at a bar and,” Dean felt himself smirk as Cas made air quotes with his hands, “‘found some company for the night, don’t wait up.’”
Cas rolled his eyes and looked at Dean. “It goes with the outfit, Dean,” he said. “You don’t like it?”
He felt Cas’s hand in his hair. He sucked Cas down taking all of him in and relaxing his throat. Dean reached a hand up to encourage Cas to grip his hair.
Castiel prodded the bullet wound and seemed satisfied with what he saw.  He replaced the bloody bandage with a fresh one.  “It’s healing well,” he commented as he wrapped Dean’s shoulder.  “You’re moving it, right?  Every hour or so, you do an arm circle?”
The next morning, Dean sat next to Cas outside Milton’s office. He glanced at Cas and once again felt white hot rage for Zachariah Milton flare through him. Cas’s eyes were bloodshot from crying and the circles under his eyes looked like double shiners. Dean sighed and looked down at his shoes, but he took Cas’s hands in his own.
School had just let out and Dean had to fight against a tide of loud, smelly adolescents to get to the principal’s office. Most took one look at the scowl on his face and stepped out of his way. He finally made it to the office. He took a deep breath and put on his game face. Or at least what he hoped passed for it.
The music changed and Dean was surprised to hear a slower song. Cas spun in Dean’s arms and clasped his hands behind Dean’s neck. Dean pressed the flat of one palm to Cas’s back and ran tips of his fingers up to the spot between Cas’s shoulder blades that he knew from experience was a sensitive area. He watched Cas’s pupils dilate and felt his chest heave. Dean pulled him even closer and pushed his thigh between Cas’s, letting him grind against him. Cas snuck one hand up and scratched his blunt nails through the short hair at the base of Dean’s skull.
After passing through the door, Castiel turned and locked it.  He scanned the room before walking back to Dean.  Dean hadn’t messed up Castiel’s orderly space much.  Castiel could tell he’d run his hand over the books on the shelf and had plucked one of his journals from its spot, of course.
Cas took the improvised blindfold off.  Dean watched as his eyes widened and he swallowed hard, adam’s apple bobbing up and down.  Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding; he was afraid Cas would laugh the minute he saw him.  Dean started dancing to the music; he lost his shirt quickly, easily pulling the snaps apart and then sliding one side of the shirt down to expose one shoulder and then the other before dropping it to the floor.
Cas crushed his mouth to Dean’s, silencing him with a hungry kiss.  Dean moaned and melted into it, parting his lips for Cas’s tongue.
“‘C’mere,” he said, beckoning Castiel to join him.  Castiel stood back from Dean and slowly unbuttoned the top of his trousers.  Dean licked his lips as Castiel slid the trousers and shorts from his body, pushing them down over one hip at a time until he stepped out of the material pooled at his feet.
Cas nodded.  “I see,” he said, and Dean could tell he was trying for serious but he slurred his words and let his body fall limply against Dean’s.
“Yes,” Gabriel said.  “For my buns.  I do so enjoy sticky buns, and so does my brother, right Cas? You’re a big fan of bees too, aren’t you?”  Dean choked on his beer.  Ben smacked him on the back and Cas looked at him with a mixture of concern and wide-eyed panic.
“Dean-Dean,” Cas was panting while Dean extracted him from the tangled cotton.  “Do you want to do this here?” he asked and then keened when Dean sealed his lips over a nipple, sucking hard and worrying it between his teeth.
The following week, Dean had to admit he was actually looking forward to the dance lesson. He hadn’t seen Cas since the impromptu get-together at the bar the week before. Of course, he wasn’t without some anxiety about being physically close to Cas for the better part of an hour. Fortunately, this time he’d not had to come straight from work and had scheduled a little “Gentleman’s time” in the shower before driving over to the city.
Then there are the long times of waiting between battles.  These are the worst.  The times when all we can do is wait for the horror to come to us.  We play cards and sometimes practice our marksmanship.  I’m actually a good shot.  I can hit a playing card dead center at 100 paces and I’m a fast draw - one of the fastest the soldiers say they’ve seen.  As doctors, we’re rarely in the field, but the sergeant insists that I carry a revolver for those times when I have to help the combat medics retrieve injured men. Sometimes the enemy tries to ambush us when we assess the injured.”
“No worries, man,” Dean said, shifting in his seat and draining his whiskey. “Castiel, right?” Dean asked. If he was gonna drink next to the man in his ridiculous bee costume he thought he should know his first name.
He didn't get to finish the sentence. His words were halted by Dean's lips pressed firmly onto his. Cas froze. Was this really happening? Was Dean kissing him?
Then, after what felt like forever, Cas heard some footsteps behind him, growing louder and louder. He turned around and who did he see but none other than Dean Winchester himself, with a heavily bruised Chuck in tow. “Dean?”
Chuck had the audacity to let out a quick laugh, only to be reminded of his wound by Dean. “I'm not going to repeat myself.”
Dean was towering over him, Billie's scythe in his hand. Splotches of Chuck's blood covering his face and his clothes. His expression was stone cold. He pressed the scythe harder into Chuck's neck. “No, there's something you gotta do for me first.”
, Dean added in his head), and had just accepted an associate professor position in legal studies at KU.
Cas moaned as Dean thrust in and pulled out, varying his depth and speed until he found Cas’s prostate.

Cas’s eyes snapped to Dean.  His mild expression darkened into something less pleasant behind the Anderson’s backs as they walked away.
“Mr. Winchester,” Cas said, and walked back through his door, not waiting for Dean.  Dean followed him and tried not to stare at his ass, his brain unhelpfully superimposing the booty shorts over Cas’s sensible navy Dockers.
Ben came down the stairs carrying two cans of Coke. He handed one to Dean and took a drink from the other. “Can I help, Dad?” he asked.
“Oh shoot, that’s right.  Sorry Jess, I know - no business on holidays but our court date was moved up to Monday at 9am.”
“Perhaps it’s best if we don’t say anything,” he said, his voice trailing off at the end of the sentence.
Cas was still holding the back of his own knee and spread wide.  Dean steadied himself on one arm and lined his cock up with the other.  He pushed in agonizingly slowly before finally bottoming out.
“Dean - I’m ready.  I’m good, Dean - please -” Cas panted as Dean tore open the condom with his teeth and rolled it over his cock.  He flipped open the lube and coated himself.
It was one of those nights when Cas broke.  He must’ve had a tough day because he drank more than usual, which was a considerable amount.  As he drained the rest of the bottle they’d been sharing, he swore and threw it onto the stone of the fireplace, shattering it into a hundred pieces.
“Cas - Cas!!” Dean called from the examination room he had transformed into his bedroom. “Did you get the pie?” he asked the second Castiel passed through the doorway.
“Damn, Cas,” Dean said. “Looks like I finally got a rise out of you.” He winked lasciviously and nodded at the front of Castiel’s trousers.
“No,” Dean said, a single tear slipping from his eye.  “He saved my life, Sam,” he said.  “He saved my life and it cost him his soul,” Dean finished.
Cas looked down at himself.  “Yes,” he answered.  “Is that not normal?” He made air quotes around the word ‘normal.’
Dean sighed. He felt tears sting his eyes. He looked down. He would not cry in front of Novak and Milton, he told himself.
Two days later, they’d met up with Sam and Bobby at what passed for an inn in the tiny village of Fort Garland.  They sat around a table in the tavern’s common room, maps spread out between them, debating the best strategy to ambush Alistair and his gang.
He was in Baby’s back seat, that much he knew.  He glanced down at dark curls and a strong hand resting against his naked chest.  For some reason, his chest was covered in glitter.  He knew that hand, he thought.  Oh shit-oh shit-oh shit.  Dean froze and looked down again at Cas, cradled in his arms, against his chest.  With a sickening realization, he recalled the rest of his night.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean said.  “You never let me up there or talk about your past.  I just wanted to get to know you better.”
Dean felt himself gulp at the intensity in Cas’s gaze. Sure he’d only spent all of ninety minutes in his presence, most of that trying not to pop an awkward boner during a waltz lesson for Christ’s sake, but he really did not want to be in this Roman guy’s shoes.
Dean pulled him back into his arms and shoved his head into the top of Cas’s head, smelling his hair rubbing circles across his back.
Dean closed the gap and let their lips meet, gently, tilting his head and getting a better angle. Cas let out the softest moan and Dean was gone for it. Before he realized what was happening, Cas was licking at his mouth and Dean was opening for Cas’s tongue.
“Well, well, Mr. Winchester isn’t it? And I assume that’s Mr. Novak on the other side of the doorway?”
Now, Castiel chewed his lip and looked away embarrassed at the thought. A feeling of want that he thought he had gotten rid of stirred inside. “What’s wrong?” Balthazar asked when Cas gave no answer. “As-tu peur de finir comme ton frère?” Castiel’s eyes went wide again and he looked at Balthazar again but his friend just chuckled. “Bloody hell, Cas. Liking boys isn’t not contagious!” He hoped the sentence didn’t sound as forced as it did in his head. Truth be told, he still had his doubts that Cas was straight. Watching him go with Anna looked a lot like going through the motions, at least when compared to all the raging hormones that he had been feeling and experiencing the last couple of years. Gay, straight, or bi... Cas deserved that kind of happiness with
“Tell him I’m sick.” Dean said back, muffled through the pillow. It wasn’t a complete lie. He certainly felt sick after watching that kiss. He had no idea it would have that affect and he felt completely stupid for suggesting it to the boy in the first place. He was just trying so hard to convince himself that he didn’t have feelings for Cas. Boy was he wrong.
Dean didn't need a shower or caffeine to help him wake up that morning. He was already buzzing with energy as he stood in front of the closet deciding to wear his best, most expensive suit. Usually he only wore it at the biggest auctions, the ones where celebrities in the know often turn up. Hell, once he watched Johnny Depp put down 30k and 40k for curse boxes of all things.  Poor guy didn't know the damn things were fairly easy to make.  Though a lot of people in the supernatural relic auction world didn't know that. They just told people like Dean what they were looking for, asked the price, tried to haggle a little until finally they got what they needed.  He looked in the mirror and fixed his collar knowing that he wasn't about to drop millions looking like he was anything less than a man deserving of being there. He had worked too hard, and too long and now it was finally time to reap the rewards.
and if Dean found out he would fuckin’ lose it. Better to end this now than to wait for that to happen.
Gabriel narrowed his eyes at him, knowing he was making fun of his plan. “Well, what would you do, since you seem to know my brother so well?”
“Sweet dreams little brother…” Gabe called out to him in a sickening sweet trickster sort of way that made Dean roll his eyes at the elder brother.
Sam that they would be having plenty of movie nights while he was here for the summer in order to catch him up on the good stuff.  Dean laughed and nodded along, answering their questions and sometimes chiming in on which movies he couldn't get into.  But in the back of his mind, he was thinking about Cas and thinking that he wasn't ordinary like his song suggested at all.
Gabe and Sam looked at each other, clearly confused before Sam finally realized that Dean was referring to the plan with Balthazar and wasn’t referring to the conversation they had just been having. “Oh! Right.” Sam saw that Gabriel was still at a loss and threw him a rather obvious bone. “I was just telling Gabriel that we needed to get
The first time he kissed Gabriel he wasn’t shocked that he kissed him back. Gabe was gay so it’s not like it was completely out of character. The next day Sam had pretended like nothing happened and Gabe followed his lead allowing Sam to go on like everything was fine. They were fine. They were best friends. He couldn’t afford for them to not be fine. So he told himself it would be the first and only kiss. Until he ran into Ruby and the opportunity presented itself again and
At least a dozen singers and dancers took the stage around Gabriel all wearing different variants of the same outfit. Black tank tops and gold glittery converse, yet they each had an accent piece that kept them unique and cohesive at the same time. Gabriel had a gold glittery top hat, while the girl next to him wore a gold glittery vest. Different variations sprinkled throughout the cast as they skipped around on stage, not dancing as much as chaotically having a good time.
Castiel laughed lightly because that was probably putting it mildly, but he nodded as he leaned up against the counter and crossed his arms. “Yeah, he is.”
Gabriel let out a sigh of relief that his plan of forcing him to come out here had worked. Truth is, he was really 50/50 on it all, but he was also fucking desperate and grasping at straws… He wouldn’t say all of that later when he told Dean and Meg, the biggest naysayers of his entire plan, the
Meg rolled her eyes again as Gabriel started ordering people to gather around so he could explain the new song order to everyone.  It’s not like this was the first time something had come up where the show got thrown for a loop the last minute. But this was definitely among the first time that he was pulling himself out of the entire show after the opening number so he could take his brother home and try to fix whatever had happened before he spiraled again.  In the corner of his mind he heard Dean Winchester’s voice telling him that something was wrong and he fought to push it away.  There was no way Dean knew his brother better than he did himself.  He quickly scratched through a few lines and made some rewrites before finding Ash near the sound equipment.
Before he could press the issue any further Gabe slipped into the seat next to Sam. “Hey boys, drinks on me tonight,” he said and snapped his fingers, bringing the waitress back over near immediately with an extra beer included for Gabe. With the boss around she didn’t flirt so openly, but Dean still managed to give her a wink as a thank you that made her smile. “Finished showing him around and realized the best part of the city is the bar, huh?”
“Stop fighting me. I’ve got you.” Dean closed his eyes and looked up as the first tear fell down his cheek. Castiel remained steady on him, giving him enough room to breathe but not letting him move an inch. The human’s uneven breathing beneath him was ragged and coming out in uneven sobs as Cas remained pressed against him like a weighted blanket.  He kept his own face buried in the warmth of the Winchesters neck letting his sobs come out and the man’s tears trickled onto his own cheek.
The only church he had set foot in was the one that he was raised in.  While everyone had access to the bible and the teachings of God, the worship ceremonies always happened behind closed doors and felt like a very private relationship with God.  Now looking at the books in front of him it was almost intimate seeing other people’s beliefs available for purchase.  Or it would be if it wasn’t all blasphemous.  He was very sure that the idea that you could put a spell on someone and make them love you was all sorts of against what God wanted humans to do. He found himself curious and not only touched the cover of the spell book but flipped through some pages.
“No trouble at all,” Gabe interrupted quickly not even addressing taking any money from Dean.  Dean sipped at his coffee and watched Gabe and Sam begin putting things away.  A quick glance over his shoulder at Cas and he could see that he was sitting on the couch, glasses on and a book in hand.  Gabe peeked his head around the corner to look at his brother.  “Hey, you able to write anything today?” he asked Castiel who didn’t look up from his book even though Dean would swear he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Chuck gave him a smile before turning around and grabbing what he needed and feeling more awake already.
Dean made a face and immediately left the room. He should have been pissed about what Sam said about Lisa, but he was too busy wondering if he was right about what he had said about Cas.
Sam raised his eyebrows at the sight of Cas standing on his porch. It only took a glance and seeing no car to realize that he walked here straight from the dance.
Dean walked to the front of the bar, mostly trying to clear his head from the noise and distance himself from the song.  He almost felt like he preferred the loud circus act than the concert the crowd was getting tonight. At least then the bright lights and perfectly choreographed dances were a distraction from his own thoughts like the ones he couldn’t shut off tonight as he waded through the crowd headed to the bar. He had no real intention of heading back to Sam, at least not for a bit. He had been to enough of these to know that the crowd would stay glued around the stage leaving only the staff to frequent the bar to grab drinks for people. He wondered if Chuck was working. If he would be able to hear him over the speakers this far back, but when the last of the crowd split for him to check, he stopped in his tracks seeing Castiel.
"Oh my god," he stifled a laugh, still looking at Dean. "You like him." He couldn't hide the smile as he teased his brother.
The cast descended the same stairs off the stage and ran into the audience dancing and skipping around making it more like an interactive live theater event. None of the audience went up on stage but some were singing every line as if they were members of the cast.
His brother slipped into the booth next to him and Dean gave him the biggest bitch face on the planet making Sam visibly confused. Charlie and Andy joined seconds later just as the song was ending.
Something about the way Dean talked to him tonight made him feel more human than he had in a while and in a way even made him have more courage about singing on Friday, even though this was the first time he was able to talk to someone who didn't feel the need to bring it up. Not that Gabe, Sam or even Meg occasionally meant to talk about how he was doing constantly… he supposed now it was hard for them not to worry when he arrived so fucking broken. And of course, Dean had arrived after the worst of it and hadn’t seen him like that which he silently prayed a thank you for. The thought of
“No.” Dean interrupted quickly and loudly. “No not think. He’s not in my head.” Chuck stared at him stumped and decided that Dean Winchester had officially reached his cut off point. When a guy turns sad and stops making sense he’s probably close to puking. Something else he learned from years of experience.
After that conversation, they continued living their lives. Sam stopped by every now and then on which occasions countless bottles of all kinds of alcohol were opened and tales of their glory days were retold.
Dean reached out his right hand and grabbed onto Castiel's left shoulder. The same spot that Cas had left his hand print on Dean when he pulled him out of hell. Dean glanced down at the ground, then back up at Cas. A slight smile played around the corners of his mouth. “And you didn't really think I would just let you leave like that, did you? After what you told me?”
When Sam moved out of the bunker to go to college, Dean and Cas rented a nice little apartment for themselves in Lebanon. They wanted to stay close to the bunker since it held all of the hunting lore as well as their equipment for when they went on hunts but they also wanted something that was just nicer to live in. The bunker was underground after all. There was no sunlight, no view and no way to step away from the hunting life for a bit. So they found themselves a cute studio apartment with a balcony so that they could enjoy sunsets together.
“Ohh, I see.” Chuck grinned. “This is about your angel, isn't it? Pretty little Castiel. I heard what happened to him. It's a shame I wasn't the one to take him since he did always mess up my plans. But I'm not bitter. I'm just glad that he's gone.”
Castiel gave him a hunter's funeral, just like Dean had asked him to. He stood silently in front of the burning wood and watched the flames climb into the sky. He held the Gospel in his hands and clung to it as if his life depended on it. He made a promise in front of the fire to keep their memories safe and to never forget them. When the fire had ceased and the last piece of ash had cooled down, Castiel left Earth for Heaven and never returned.
Somewhere behind him, Sam was on the ground with Jack. Jack was unconscious. He had used up all of his powers to beat Chuck. Sam was beside him to take care of him. He spoke up: “What? Dean, just kill him.”
He didn't even know how many angels were left in heaven. Given how weak his powers were getting, he assumed not many. After all, heaven was powered by angels. Whenever angels died, heaven got weaker and with it, all living angels. If the remaining angels were feeling as weak as he was, they would need all the help they could get to get heaven back on its feet.
Yes, but Cas was a part of this family too. And he didn't like the thought of him leaving Dean forever at all. Dean knew now that he had messed up. He had blamed Cas for everything, even though it wasn't his fault. He had driven him away by refusing to listen to him. He had been a huge dick and now he was seeing the results of it.
Chuck was kneeling on the ground, his face beaten bloody, his chest heaving. He looked up at Dean with unspeakable pain in his eyes. “Just end it already.”
Cas tried to reciprocate but he wasn't as experienced a kisser as Dean was. He thought about all the years he had spent watching over Dean, trying to protect him from all the evil in world. Failing to protect him over and over again. Losing him more often than he could count. And always getting him back. Even here, in the nothingness of the Empty, they had found each other. A single tear rolled down Castiel's cheek.
Sam died a few years before Dean did. Losing his brother took a big toll on him. Cas did his best to try and comfort him through his grief but he was never the same. Cas could watch him grow weaker and weaker by the day. Every night, they went to bed with the fear that Dean would not wake up the next morning. And one day, that fear came true.
He spent his last years writing his memoirs, with the help of Sam of course. To be honest, Sam did most of the actual writing. When they had finished their work, they gave it to Cas as a gift. “The Winchester Gospel”, they had titled it.
Cas was still thinking about his conversation with Dean in the bunker. Had he made the right decision to just walk out like that? What if they needed him?
It made him sad to remember that they once considered each other family and that it had to end like this. But there was nothing he could do about it. He had tried talking to them, to no avail, so this was the only solution.
The problem was, the more he thought about it, the more he turned Castiel's words over in his head, he was slowly starting to come to the realisation that it might have been his own fault.
A million thoughts were running through Castiel's head. He decided to articulate them with one simple question. “Dean, what are you doing here?”
“What are you going to do when I'm gone?”, Dean had asked unprompted, while looking out over Lebanon.
So they settled down together. Neither of them were exactly the romantic type so their lives didn't change drastically. They just became official, much to Sam's joy who seemed more ecstatic about the whole thing than Dean or Cas.
To most angels, love was a foreign concept. Of course, they understood love in its general sense. “Love thy neighbour” and all that. But they didn't hold personal love for one another. They didn't understand it. Cas had once tried to explain it to another angel, how you could care about another person so deeply that you would do anything for them. Give up your entire life and devote it to them. His explanations had been met with a blank stare of confusion. So, Heaven decided that love was a human emotion that angels had no need for. Cas silently shook his head at that decision but didn't care enough to convince them otherwise. There was no point to it anyway.
Cas woke up in the by now all too familiar nothingness of the Empty. He looked around. Just darkness, as usual. Cas sighed. He knew this was all he would be seeing for the rest of his life. He resigned himself to eternity in this space.
“Oh, god, please spare me this sappiness. I'm going to throw up.” Chuck's voice cruelly ripped the two of them out of their entanglement.
He already packed and put his coat on, and he’s bolting through the elevator doors before the clock can read 5.01.
He traces each letter over and over, memorizes the different textures between ink and paper with the tip of his finger. When his lunch break ends, his sandwich is still lying untouched in its box.
Simpler days, carrying with them a different kind of excitement, but which were nothing compared to this.
Dean watches him stroll through the crowd, he has a little girl hiding behind his leg and a ring sitting on his finger. That's new. He looks at him, at Sam, at the child, back at him again, and his chest is hurting with all the things he has been missing.
On his way out, he says goodbye to Becky, who ignores him to keep reading her magazine, and high fives Joshua, who smiles at him and wishes him a “very good weekend.”
Years later, there was a storm, all lightning and shit, one so bright they thought it had destroyed this place, but when they got here in the morning, ‘t was just as they had left it, except-
The blessing sound of a cry, echoing through the street like prayer in an empty church- a dissacred one, for such tender words could only be meant for a sinner; the moon hung proud and white, brightening whatever little time they had left and moving up an inch-slightly but demanding, reminding them of how the sun wouldn't wait forever to take its rightful place, wouldn't wait for them to find a way. Their lonesome howls, turned beckoning the first time they had laid eyes on each other, painted over the stars: they had this one moment, and not even them were allowed to pry.
He did, Dean had made him one sometime ago, after complaining about his taste in music, or lack of thereof. This didn't look any different.
Castiel looks at the clock on the wall like it’s going to turn any faster if he stares at it hard enough.
Other times, though, he would talk ‘bout one of them in particular, recounting all the things that had him falling.
Cas wasn't sure if the other angels would take him back, though. He had abandoned them, chosen humanity over them and had been personally involved in all the problems that heaven had had in the last couple of years. He felt that it was at least partially his fault that heaven was as weak as it was now.
Dean could blame Cas for everything that had gone wrong in his life all day long but he couldn't deny that Cas was right. Cas knew how Dean was feeling about his mum and Jack and he tried to talk to him about it but Dean had shut him down, again and again. He had been so absorbed in his anger that he didn't stop to try and see how Cas was doing. Obviously, Cas was grieving as well. And what did Dean do to help him? Blame him for it all. Dean was starting to think that if somebody would have treated him the way that he had been treating Cas, he would have probably left as well.
Eventually, Dean stopped in front of him. His body was covered in blood, as usual, and still he was the most beautiful thing Cas had ever laid his eyes upon in all the millennia he had been alive. Dean locked his gaze with Castiel's and they just stared at each other, drowning out everything around them. Ignoring Chuck's pained groans and the Empty's upset screeching. The only thing that mattered was each other.
Cas told himself to stop thinking about them. This was the end of a chapter in his life. But it was just that, one chapter in his very long life. He tried to convince himself that he would find new friends, a new family, that would appreciate him but his hopes weren't very high.
“You know me”, Dean said with a crooked smile. Then he shook Chuck's body and scraped his skin with the scythe. “Now, what are you waiting for?”
He wanted to say more, tell this angel all about his life with the Winchesters. How much he loved Dean and how much he missed him now that he was gone. How he couldn't bare to even think about going back to Earth because everything down there reminded him of Sam and Dean. How he was wasting his existence away in Heaven because he had lost his purpose. There was a coil in his stomach that tightened whenever he thought about them. The love he had felt down there was gone and it had left an aching hole in his heart.
Cas was looking for the right words to explain to this person how strong love could be, how powerful it was and how much a person you love could mean to you. But whenever he attempted to start a sentence, he felt that his words didn't do the emotion justice. He thought about the Gospel and everything he did with the Winchesters. The bonds they build. The feelings he shared with Dean. How was he supposed to fit all of that into an explanation that this angel could understand? “It is indescribable to someone who has never experienced it”, he said in the end.
Cas was on his way to heaven's gate. Since the Winchesters clearly didn't need him anymore, he now had the time to take care of the problems there.
No, Cas reminded himself, they didn't need him anymore. Dean had made that abundantly clear. They didn't need him, didn't care about him, didn't love him. He had spent too much time already excusing Dean's behaviour and it was obvious now that Dean wouldn't change the way he treated him. It was better for everyone involved if he just walked away. So that's what he did.
Castiel's mind wandered back to all the years he spent with Dean. All the memories they made and what it felt like to be close to him. He remembered holding Dean in his arms. He remembered the scent of his clothes after a long day in the auto shop. He remembered the sound of his laughter when Cas didn't get one of his pop culture references. He remembered Dean getting really flirty with him after a certain number of drinks. He remembered watching the sunset over Lebanon together. He remembered his smile and his eyes and the way he used to look at Cas as if he was the best thing in the world. He remembered looking at Dean in the same way. “What the others say is not true. Anybody can feel it, just as long as you find the right person.”
The whole world turned black. Dean found himself in a big black nothingness, still holding Chuck in front of him with the scythe against his neck. He looked around for Cas but all he could see was endless darkness.
Cas turned around. Meg was there. Or rather, the Empty in Meg's appearance. She seemed furious. She yelled: “Why are you here?”
Now, Dean had to admit that these words might have been a little harsh when he had said them originally. But how should he have known that Cas was going to take them so seriously? And that he would remember them?
They argued back and forth like this for a while. It became tiring quite quickly. The Empty was mad that she wasn't asleep. Castiel didn't know why they were both awake either but he also didn't have a solution.
Sam looked at Dean with pleading eyes. “Dean, taking Chuck away from here is a risk we don't need to take. You don't even know if you can find him in the Empty.”
Cas remembered one conversation that they had on that very balcony many years ago. Dean had just surpassed sixty years of age but you couldn't tell from his appearance, apart from a few wrinkles next to his eyes and a couple of grey streaks in his hair.
“You don't know that”, Dean interrupted. “For all we know, I could have a heart attack tomorrow or get hit by a car or – I don't know!” He seemed anxious and exasperated.
Was this how his story was supposed to end? Everyone he cared about was dead, except for Sam, and the only person he loved that was still alive had left him because he had been a jerk to him. This wasn't how you're meant to treat your family. And after all, Cas was still family.
Castiel's eyes were still open. He didn't know what to do. He looked at Dean's face. His eyes were closed, his expression was soft. He had never seen his face so peaceful.
Life in Heaven was, in short, tedious. Cas missed his time with the Winchesters. Sure, they had been in constant danger and facing threats larger than what they could handle but there was a certain thrill in it. They had a purpose. Now, Cas had a 9-5 teaching job.
But they did live past forty. In fact, they both lived past eighty. Cas still fondly remembered the day they beat Chuck. The day they got their lives back. That was the last time they faced a danger that they feared they could not master. And that day, a weight was lifted off their shoulders that they had forgotten they were carrying.
And of course, he was mad at Chuck. He had every right to be! But did he have the right to take it out on Cas?
“No.” Dean removed the blade from Chuck's neck, much to everyone's surprise. He grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him to his feet. The look of surprise on Chuck's face even exceeded the look of shock on Sam's. But before Chuck could do anything to escape his position, he found himself again with the scythe at his neck. This time, Dean was stood behind him, firmly pressing him against his body and pushing the blade of the scythe back into the wound on his neck it had previously created.
Dean felt the weight in the bed sink as Cas moved forward. His eyes flickered up to Cas’ just before the distance was closed and their mouths crashed together. It was rougher than before. Cas’ sudden movement without warning made their teeth collide before Cas plunged his tongue into Dean’s mouth, pulling a moan out of Dean. Somewhere in the back of his mind was an alarm going off screaming that this is what messed everything up before… but it got quieter as Dean wrapped an arm around Cas’ waist, fingers moving under that damn Zeppelin t-shirt and pulling him in closer.
“You seemed to be a real natural,” Dean added a little rushed and bit his cheek some hating that he sounded like some gushing fangirl. “I mean, Charlie was right. The whole room ate it up,” he declared trying to put the shift back on the majority rather than just him.
As the song continued, the other guy approached and just when you thought the first guy was going to move away, he didn’t and they all danced together for a moment leaving the impression that Balthazar would be happy being with both, maybe at the same time. “What the fuck…” Dean couldn’t help the words coming out as he watched in confused horror at the foreign language with extremely explicit dancing. Cas watched on, the shocking wearing off as he listened to the lyrics. He wouldn't doubt that all of these were real experience. Balthazar was a playboy to say the least, and he seemed to be hellbent of reminding Castiel of that.
Castiel pushed open his door and headed into the club leaving Dean sitting speechless in the car.  He watched him disappear through the doors before turning back around, his heart aching with some feeling he couldn’t define. He silently thanked the God he didn’t really believe in that Cas left him alone because he was going to need more than a minute to recover.
“You think I can’t get into a locked room in my own house?” Gabe asked sounding annoyed that Dean thought he
“The drugs.” Dean cut in forcefully. “This.” He gestured to him not able to help the disgusted look on his face as he looked up and down at him in his current state.
He worried his lip some. 17 unanswered texts. What was stopping her from telling him to fuck off... Find someone else to deal with his shit… Lose her number…
Dean almost frowned at the thought, not liking or really understanding why the guy was constantly in his mind like this, but he forced the thought away, grin still on his face. “I’ve never needed a rabbit’s foot to get lucky before…” he told her and watched as her eyebrows went up curiously and an intrigued smile formed on her lips.
Dean huffed, not at all understanding what the hell was going on and too impatient with Gabriel’s cryptic back story to figure it out tonight.
“But he wasn’t supposed to be here.” Michael practically whined. Cas looked away a little uncomfortably. This rival thing between them had been going on for years though Cas never attempted to add fuel to the fire. Michael was always trying to outperform him yet hardly ever succeeded. It wasn’t his fault he had a natural talent for manipulating others.
Castiel had lost track of how long it had been since he was taken from heaven by his own brother and given to the humans as a slave, simply in exchange for loyalty. It had to be centuries now as he saw the rise and fall of the British empire, of kings and queens, the invention of technology he would never understand. Once again, his human master died, and he was tossed back into the system. There were few of them around -- some got free, some died, some joined them -- and Cas hated that he knew how much he was worth. Though, he wasn't sure if it was for his physical strength, or the beautiful body of James Novak that he chose to inhabit back when he first came to Earth. The moving van shuttered to a halt and Castiel looked up and waited until the back doors opened. He didn't bother wincing in the blinding sunlight, he just held out his hands as the handle checked his Enochian engraved shackles and then tugged him out.
“Wow, I’m missing the party.” Dean said with a chuckle as he walked up to the table seeing all four glasses empty and Cas’ face still twisted some with distaste.  He hadn’t changed out of the light blue blazer and tight jeans and Dean looked over him a moment longer before averting his eyes so he wouldn’t be caught staring.  That’s when he noticed all three of the others were grinning up at him stupidly. It was easy to see that he was going to be the one responsible for making sure they got home okay. Cas had composed his face and was now looking at Dean too, his mouth set in the faintest smile that Dean wasn’t sure was alcohol related or not as he looked content just gazing up at him wordlessly. Feeling nervous at Cas’ ability to look at peace simply watching him, he broke eye contact focusing instead on his bottle as he took the last drink of his beer.
It was true, Dean had hardly looked at Cas in the last couple of weeks, ever since his mum had died. But it was because he was angry, he was grieving, of course he wasn't being himself.
And then, later in life, Dean had taught him about the importance of a different kind of love. Of course, they had always had certain feelings for each other, Cas just didn't have a word for them, or a way to deal with them. So, when Dean admitted to his feelings and what that meant for their relationship, Cas knew immediately that all he wanted was to stay with Dean for the rest of his life.
“Why do you want to go to the Empty so bad? Is there something I'm missing here?” From his current position, he couldn't make eye contact with Dean so he glanced over at Sam instead.
It had been many years since Cas had last been to Earth, since he had last had a reason to go down there. He had since started a teaching and mentoring job in Heaven. Their forces were still diminished and recovering from all the apocalypses that had happened so long ago so they had started recruiting new angels. And of course, they had to be trained in morals, values and rules but also in combat. Cas mainly taught combat classes.
Dean grabbed the back of his trenchcoat with his left hand and pulled Cas closer to him. That was when Cas finally allowed himself to relax. He let go of the tension in his body and melted into the kiss. He placed his hands on Dean's hips, burying his fingers deep in the fabric of his shirt.
Instead, he opted for the mentoring position. His students loved him and looked up to him, he could tell. They did whatever he told them, were always eager to learn from him and constantly questioned him about his time on Earth. His story had become somewhat of a legend amongst angels.
Then, suddenly, Dean heard a voice. It was far away but it was unmistakeably the one he was looking for. Dean looked over at Chuck, a smile growing on his face. Chuck rolled his eyes. “Okay, it seems that you were right.”
Afterwards, they settled down. Sometimes they went out on hunts. Dean took a part-time job fixing cars. Sam enrolled in college again. And Cas, he stayed with Dean.
“Hey.” Cas moved closer to Dean and grabbed his hand. Dean looked at him. “When you pass away, whenever that may be, I will find a way to be alright. I don't want you to spend every day of your life worrying about your death and about what happens to me afterwards. Because I don't know what I will do when you're gone. And I don't want to think about it.”
It seemed that he had no other choice. Well, Dean hadn't left him with another choice. There was only so much Cas could handle and Dean had really stretched the limits of how much bad treatment Cas could take. Dean didn't want him in the bunker, so he left.
“Yes but sooner or later, I will live my last day and die. And you will still be here. And I guess my question is just, what are your plans?”
Dean and Cas pulled back from each other. Their faces were still just inches apart and their hands were still holding onto each other's bodies. Their smiles outgrew their faces.
“Okay”, Dean repeated. Cas could see a few tears collecting in his eyes but he didn't think Dean wanted him to see that. So he simply pulled him into his arms and held him close. They sat like that for a while until Dean pulled away and wiped his face.
The last thing he remembered before the Empty took him was Dean's face. Dean's tender, confused face that tried to grasp what he had told him. That tried to stop what he was doing. A sad smile spread across Castiel's face. He had given up his life for Dean, even if he hadn't wanted him to. And that was alright. He could stand spending the rest of eternity here, as long as he knew that Dean was alright. Or at least that he had given him a chance at that.
“Well, I'm sorry that you're upset but there's nothing I can do.” Castiel raised his hands apologetically.
“I understand how you feel”, Cas continued, “but I can't change the inevitable. And until then, I want to enjoy every single moment that I have with you. Okay?”
He didn't even really want to go to heaven. The place had stopped being his home a long time ago. But where else should he go? Without Sam and Dean, he had no home, no family, no purpose. So, heaven it was.
