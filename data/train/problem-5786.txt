“Pep,” he murmured again, staring at her with what had to be stars in his eyes. God, it was so good to see her. “It’s so good to see you,” he said, just because he could. She smiled at him and leaned down, pressing a soft kiss on his forehead, then on his lips.
“Yeah, cuddles now,” Bucky mumbled against Tony’s chest, sighing contently when Steve draped himself over his back.
“Yeah, I- I know that. I was just surprised, I guess, but it makes sense, she doesn’t get to see him that often.” Tony gave him a proud smile and then turned to Peter, who was still standing in the kitchen door, looking lost and confused. Tony opened his arms.
So I decided that this one is a fill for my free space, A3, which also means that this is my third bingo ^^
It should have been weird, this whole constellation. But it didn’t take long for Steve and Bucky to join them in the living room, sitting down next to Morgan and cheering on her. This of course meant that Rhodey started cheering on Nebula, while Pepper supported Peter. They all looked at Tony, awaiting his decision. He laughed.
“A cyborg is short for cybernetic organism, which basically means a being that is both organic and biomechatronic. So yeah, Peter’s actually right, you are a cyborg.” She crooked her head at him, raising one (nonexistent?) eyebrow. He smiled. “Also, Peter, this is Nebula, Nebula, this is Peter Parker. You’ve met before on Titan, but- you know. Proper introduction and stuff.”
He definitely still didn’t swim, but Morgan loved to and she had persuaded both Steve and Bucky to go swimming with her. She had them wrapped around her little finger, which did not surprise Tony at all. Also, he couldn’t say anything either way, because as it turned out he couldn’t resist the combined force of their puppy eyes when they all pleaded with him to join them.
They sat down on the couch, because all Tony needed to begin with was to just look at it and maybe have FRIDAY scan it. Bucky seemed pretty relaxed, sitting down next to him and offering the arm as if it was normal. As if Tony didn’t know for a fact that not even Steve was really allowed to touch it most days. As if- Well, on some days, Tony was still working on believing he deserved good things, or love, or trust. It seemed like tonight might be going in that direction. He shrugged it off. He could freak out later, but right now Bucky needed him to focus.
“Maybe. I think they, well Shuri- I think Shuri wanted me to have another name, in case I decided to not use Winter Soldier anymore. Which yeah, makes sense. I don’t wanna be him anymore, so…” He broke off.
That must have been all of the adult talk that Morgan could stand, because she began to squirm in Rhodey’s arms, reaching out towards Tony. Who wanted nothing more than to reach back, but no matter how not-dead he felt, he was still too weak for that. But Rhodey must have realized what he wanted, because he helped Morgan get up on the bed, where she immediately curled up against Tony, tiny little hands clasped tight around his shirt.
“So, is he gonna be the new you?” someone suddenly asked, which made Tony realized that he’d been zoning for a while now. He had not heard anyone enter the room and he had definitely not realized that Rhodey was here.
“No. HYDRA killed my parents; you were just the tool the used. It wasn’t your fault, but I forgive you, if you need it.” That had apparently been the right thing to say, because Bucky suddenly slumped down as if all the strings had been cut and Tony only just managed to catch him before he fell. They sank to the floor and Tony realized that Bucky was crying, almost sobbing. Shit, that had not been the intention.
They fell into a rhythm, somehow. Natasha spent most of her time with Clint and his family; but came over so often that it never really felt like she left. Wilson picked up the shield and went to train the new Avengers (which meant mainly Peter. Who still hadn’t come to see Tony, now that he thought about it. He’d known that Peter was with his aunt when he woke up, which made sense, but still, he had kinda expected to see him at some point. Hmm, that might need some investigation). Bucky seemed to be torn between following Wilson and staying with Steve, which meant that he was kinda all over the place for the moment. And Steve- Steve just didn’t leave. Tony knew that he had had a long and very throughout conversation with Pepper at some point, which had seemed to settle him some, because after that he just kinda moved in. The house was not a mansion, not a tower, but still big enough that they had more guestrooms than they knew what to do with. At least, until the team decided to spend so much time here, of course. Which meant that one of the guestrooms was now Steve’s room.
“He’s right, you know,” Steve said a couple of minutes later, leaning onto the door frame, arms casually crossed, face serious. “I’m only ever as good as you believe me to be.”
“Oh really, did you now, Steven?” Tony voice was suddenly icy, which made both Barnes and Wilson laugh so hard that is was difficult maintaining a stern face. Steve at least had the good graces to look abashed.
Tony closed his eyes shutting what little light there was out. He could feel a single tear rolling down his face, didn’t try to stop it. Soft fingers brushed it away, then Steve pressed a kiss to his cheek.
“Sorry, you’re right. I wasn’t- I wasn’t thinking, I guess. Maybe it’s just habit. Not everyone is so… understanding.” Tony nodded. “But yeah, I never stopped loving him.”
“We’d never dare to do that,” Steve suddenly said from behind them, moment before his – indeed very wet – daughter launched herself at him with a shriek.
“I- I don’t really know, to be honest. He wasn’t at to compound when I woke up, and then all I wanted was to go home. I- I didn’t realize it has been so long, I guess. Has he said anything?”
“Please? Pepper took Morgan out to see her grandparents, it’s just me, I’m all alone tonight, just- please?”
“I know, I know, I’m tragically late in realizing that. Actually no, I realized that pretty much an hour into that whole mess, back in Germany. But- well. I should have told you, I should have told you years and years ago and I’m sorry. I’m glad we made it, I’m glad we got to this point here, but- I wish I hadn’t hurt you the way I did; you didn’t deserve that and, well… as I said, it wasn’t worth it.”
Tony leaned back against Bucky. Pepper smiled at him and patted her lap, so he stretched out his legs, too. She immediately began massaging his feet, because for some reason that was something that she liked doing while watching a movie. Rhodey grinned at her, arms wrapped tight around her waist. The kids were all lounging around on the couch and the floor, eating popcorn and probably getting half of it under the furniture, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to care. He was way too happy to be annoyed about something like that.
It took a while, but eventually Bucky calmed down, straightened up a bit. He was whipping his eyes on his sleeve, or at least he tried to, until Tony passed him a tissue. Being a prepared dad definitely had his benefits, sometimes.
Tony grinned. “I don’t mind getting wet, as long as no one empties a bucket over my head of anything like that,” he said.
“Rhodey!” he cried, holding his arms out for a hug. It worked very well in making Rhodey (and Peter) laugh. “When did you get here?”
“Maybe. But he wouldn’t have been able to do so, if not for you. Not only because it’s your tech, although that too. But… we all need someone who believes in the best of us, and you always have. Even when we betrayed you, you always believed in us.”
“Oh, Happy told me about her I think. She sounds great.” Tony smiled down at his daughter, who was now almost asleep in his arms.
They smiled at each other and Tony could feel his eyes getting wet. He took a deep breath and nodded towards her cup.
“You don’t have to stay with me to keep me company, Bucky. You can go swimming if you want, I’m not gonna get bored,” Tony said after a while, making sure to smile at Bucky to let him know that he didn’t want him gone, if he preferred to stay.
“Okay, can we- can we talk about that later? Bucky and me, we’re fine, we’ll get to know each other and soon we’ll be a combined pain in your ass, okay? Let’s just- let’s get you cleaned up and in bed, I think that’s more important right now.” Steve nodded, as grateful look on his face.
So yeah, it made sense that Rhodey came back home with them. Tony wanted, needed to have his family close, after everything that happened. He had been sure that he would die, after all, sure that this time, is was actually over. To wake up to find Morgan and Rhodey and Pepper and all of them waiting for him, was more than he could have ever hoped for. One more chance, and he definitely planned to make the most of it.
“No, I don’t.” He could hear someone clearing his throat, someone else laughing, but he didn’t care. One day he was going to run out of second and third chances, but apparently it was not today. And Steve didn’t seem to mind, judging by the way he was kissing back.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to- I can go-“ Bucky started, but he fell silent as soon as Tony hold up a hand. He took a deep breath and very deliberately relaxed his shoulders, then raised his eyes to look at Tony.
“Come here, kid,” he said softly, and Peter crashed into the hug within seconds. Tony felt the last of the tension in his body melt away, content with holding the kid as long as either of them needed it. He wasn’t even surprised when he felt his shirt getting wet, when he felt the slight tremors going through him.
“I don’t know. Maybe, I guess. But then again, it’s not like the suit with a binder is really uncomfortable, it works fine most of the time.”
“No, I- I think I mostly tried not to think about it. I mean, I hoped you would see, that it wasn’t him, but I also- I should have told you and I was afraid that my mistake was too big, that you wouldn’t ever want to talk to me, to us again.” Tony sighed. Yeah, he could see where that thought came from, not only after Siberia, but also after he came back from Titan. But maybe now was not the right moment to talk about this, with Steve hurt and Tony only just beginning to realize that yes, he was actually back, he actually got to have that.
“Steve-“ Tony had no idea what to say, even after all this years. He’d known Steve had his reasons; he’d known for years now that Barnes was not to blame. He understood Steve’s actions, even if he didn’t like them. But-
“It was my idea,” he said, almost whispered, as if he was afraid of- of what exactly? Punishment? Holy fuck, yeah that talk needed to happen soon.
Nebula took her role as older sister very serious and Tony was having the time of his life, watching her. Morgan already loved her anyway, so she definitely didn’t mind spending time with her. Peter was- mostly confused. They didn’t get to spend a lot of time together, because Peter had to go back to school on Monday, but Nebula made sure to be able to hang around with him for a couple of hours before he left, which Tony found very sweet. He suspected that Peter believed that Tony had sent her, but either way he didn’t seem to mind, really.
“You don’t have to decide right now, Buck,” Steve said. He smiled, looked happy even. This was just so like him, to be happy for others, even if it could mean that he would never get what he really wanted. But then again, Bucky was still here, still holding Tony’s hand, still looking at Steve with soft eyes.
“I think Morgan likes him.” Actually no, he was sure she did, because if not she’d have told him. Loudly.
“What did you expect, then?” Tony asked, trying very hard not to let his voice show how much the thought hurt, that Peter might not have trusted him, that he might have expected him to react badly.
“Yeah no, that does make sense, at least to me. I-“ He hesitated. Fuck it. “I don’t know how much you know, about me, about how I became Iron Man, but I used to have an arc reactor, right here.” He tapped his chest. “It has been gone for years by now, and sometimes I still wake up feeling like there’s something missing. It didn’t belong there, but that didn’t change the fact that it was part of me, that it- it belonged
“You’re sitting here alone and you look sad. You never look sad since uncle Steve and the others came here.” He smiled. Clever little girl.
“Oh. Okay yeah, that makes sense.” And it also reminded Tony that this was not about him. Sure, he was honored that Peter trusted him enough, that he thought Tony was important enough to know. But in the end, this was about Peter, who just told him something that probably not that many people knew. And besides, it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t know how hard coming out was.
“Oh.” Apparently, that was a thought that hadn’t occurred to him. Tony shook his head. He was surrounded by a bunch of idiots. Apart from Natasha, it seemed, who was currently very busy trying to sneak Pepper inside the house without any of them noticing.
“Okay, you’re gonna make me cry. Let’s go feed your daughter breakfast before that happens, I’m an ugly crier and you do not want to see that.” He was still blushing, but he also looked incredibly happy, so they were probably fine.
“Tony?” Bucky asked softly, still hesitating but obviously hopeful. Tony reached out for his hand, pulling him close. He took a step closer, but didn’t sit down yet.
“It’s so good to see you,” he murmured into her hair, not even bothered when she tightened the hug for a second, almost painfully so.
“Who is it? Is it someone fun?” Tony asked, already getting up and stretching. He was not made for sitting over a project for hours at a time. Rhodey grinned.
“No. Tony, no. I understand that you forgive us, and I’m incredibly thankful for that, if not for myself then for Steve. But… please don’t say it was fine. It was wrong, it should not have happened and if Steve knew that, if he knew what the arc reactor meant-“ He broke off. His right hand was shaking, while the left one was still lying in Tony’s lap, soft and pliant.
“Looks like it, Mrs. Potts. What are you gonna do about it?” Pepper laughed and leaned down to kiss Tony herself.
“I can’t stay long; I’ll be busy bringing the stones back to where they belong. But I just- wanted to see you, before…”
“Cinderella it is, then. FRIDAY?” Moments later, the movie began playing and they all settled down again. Morgan snuggled up to Peter, which was so adorable that Tony had to hide his face in Bucky’s chest for a moment.
Neither of them had thought about dessert, but that didn’t really matter. They ended up on the couch eventually, trading lazy kisses that could have led somewhere, if the situation, the circumstances were different.
Nebula stared at him, obviously speechless. Tony carefully reached out to her, put his hand on her arm.
“Yeah, she is. You’d like her, I think. Actually, I wanted to ask if you felt like coming over sometime?” He tried not to let the hurt show in his voice, but he wasn’t too sure if he succeeded.
But spending even more time with Bucky made them realize all the ways that he still wasn’t okay. He had nightmares most nights and sometimes he’d spend whole days in bed, the feeling of guilt so strong, so oppressing that he couldn’t even get up.
“I like Cinderella,” Peter said after a moment and Tony decided that this was as good as any other choice they could make.
Rhodey helped him make his way over to the lake, while Pepper took Morgan inside to get changed and to get some drinks. It was peaceful, calm. There were more birds than before, which struck Tony as a weird thing to notice. But then again, Thanos hadn’t just wiped out half the human population but half of all living things.
In the end, it was Morgan who woke them all up. Tony must have fallen asleep again, because he didn’t hear the door open, didn’t hear her little feet on the floor. It was Bucky who heard her, who sat up and caught her as she jumped on the bed, just before she could crash into Tony and Steve.
“That’s all I’m asking for. I know you have more than enough love for both of us, for more than both of us. I know you, Tony.”
“You’re an asshole,” Tony choked out (desperately hoping that his daughter did not hear what he was saying), before pulling Steve down for a kiss.
“I- I’d love to!” Peter sounded really excited and Tony could almost see him, moving around in his tiny bedroom, so much energy to stay still. “Are you- I mean, are you still-“ He heard Peter take a deep breath, but he didn’t continue. Tony frowned.
“Asexuality. That’s a sexual orientation, with- well, it describes the lack of sexual attraction, which does not mean that one might not fall in love or be in a relationship. It just means that you might not feel sexual attraction towards your partner. Or partners.”
They did in fact spend the next hour on the couch, eating cookies and watching Steve Irwin documentaries. At some point, Morgan joined them, apparently not bothered at all by the teenager sitting on their couch. Maybe Happy had told her about him. Or maybe she just didn’t care. Tony smiled when she sat down next to Peter, looked at him for a moment and then declared:
Bucky was silent for a while, not even moving and Tony was suddenly worried that it was too much, too soon. That all they would achieve with this was to chase him out of their bed, that he would leave. But he didn’t.
Steve moved a bit closer to Tony, pulling him over to his chest and they stayed like that for a while, soft and warm. For a moment, Tony almost felt like crying, because he couldn’t believe, had never dared to even dream about something like that. To have this, his family and the people he loved, all safe and happy, was more than he could have ever hoped for.
And then Morgan ruined all his efforts by saying: “They’re evil and you have to kill them, aunt Nebula.” Which, to nobody’s surprise, worked way better at getting her to play the game than any kind of explanation Peter gave her ever could. Mostly, because Nebula was absolutely smitten with Morgan.
“Nah, I’m good, you stay there.” He put the plate down next to the lavatory and passed one open water bottle over to Steve. “Water still warm enough?”
“Hey Cap,” Tony got out, voice still scratchy and dry. Steve immediately reached for the ice chips and offered them to Tony, who nodded gratefully.
“Right, yeah. But we’re not only good at pack bonding with other humans. We do it with our pets as well, we see them as parts of the family. Or- actually,FRIDAY, you up?”
Bucky and Steve decided to watch a movie after dinner, but Peter seemed to restless for sitting around on the couch, so Tony asked him, if he wanted to go for a walk. He had other motives as well, of course. He had found that walks, just as long car rides were a great possibility to talk, because there was always the option of looking at the scenery, if looking at the other person was too difficult or anything like that. Peter seemed very much in favor of that idea.
This is a fill for T4 "Picture of Tony standing in front of the cave"... Also I just realized, this is my first bingo!! Yay ^^
Tony spent his nights alternating between Pepper and Steve, depending on the mood and if Nat was here or not. She usually spent the night with Pepper, in which case Tony ceded the bed to them.
It took a couple of days for Tony to stop feeling off. He tried hard not to let Morgan notice, because she didn’t really know Steve and he had no idea how to explain this whole mess to her. But at the same time, he didn’t ever want to lie to her, so if she’d ask, he would have to find an answer. So far, she hadn’t.
Steve was looking at him, but not how Tony would have expected. Contemplating, more than anything else.
“No, it’s not. I just- you looked so sad when I left. I just wanted to see you.” Tony had to close his eyes for a second, almost overwhelmed with feelings. “Sweetheart…”
It took a while for them to separate and even then, they were still touching, still holding hands in a way that made Tony wonder, not for the first time, if they were (or had been) sleeping together. Whatever it was, they needed each other and not for the first time Tony was glad that Steve was the way he was. Selfless and devoted, always.
“Third. I- I already got my second chance, with you, with Morgan. I-“ She smiled at him, all soft and full of love, even though her eyes were kinda sad, too.
He shoved some more pasta into his mouth, before getting up and pulling out his phone. He made his way outside on the porch, leaving back a kitchen full of laughing people.
“Yeah, everyone’s fine. MJ and Ned are a pain in my-“ He broke off and there was a sound, as if he had just slapped his hand in front of his mouth. Tony laughed.
“So, Steve and Tony asked me to talk to you,” he started, clearly not willing to beat around the bush. Bucky frowned, looked at Tony. He tried to give him a reassuring smile, but he wasn’t too sure if it worked. They should have talked to Bucky first.
“Did you know that they called me White Wolf in Wakanda?” Bucky suddenly asked. His voice was quiet, almost as if he didn’t want to give the thought too much room, too much voice.
“Oh.” Steve was smiling at them. “That is a really nice interpretation, I like that.” The others nodded and now it was Peter’s turn to hide.
“It’s not- We were just wondering, you know? If that was something that you wanted. It’s okay if it’s not-“
“Don’t worry, she does not like you any less just because she likes someone else as well.” Usually, Tony would have tried to make a joke, but he wasn’t sure how Bucky would take it and this was actually important. It was something that Tony had had to learn as well. Bucky nodded again.
He woke up again a couple of hours later to soft voices murmuring next to him. Morgan was still curled up against him, sleeping soundly. He found that by now, he had enough strength to get his arm around her, hug her close, even while being careful not to wake her. The movement got the attention of whoever else was in the room and the conversation stopped. When he was sure that his daughter was as close and as safe as she could be, he turned his head and sought out the other people in the room. It was dark outside, and the room was dimly lit, so it took a moment to recognize them. Rhodey was still here, thank god, sitting on a couch next to Steve. Steve, whose eyes lit up as soon as he realized Tony was watching them. He got up and walked over to the bed, his smile soft and relieved.
“Yeah. Thanks,” he murmured. He seemed tired. Sam had dropped him off here just a couple of hours ago, after they had finished their last mission.
“I’ll come back,” he promised, then his fingers slipped out of Tony’s hand and he could hear footsteps on the stairs. He opened his eyes, just in time to see Steve looking back, one last time, before getting into the car and driving away. Fuck. Fuck, that hurt. He’d known, he’d told Steve that it was okay, but really, it wasn’t.
“You want me to call him and tell him to come here?” Natasha stared at him. So did Steve. Did those people never think?
“You never stopped loving him, did you?” Steve’s head suddenly snapped up and he was looking at Tony with wide eyes.
“No! No, I’m coming back, at least- well, I hope I make it, that’s what I meant.” That- was marginally better, but still not good.
“I think FRIDAY figured out what’s wrong with your arm,” he said after a moment, just so he could say anything. It wasn’t a lie, and he really did want to make sure that Bucky was comfortable. Especially since it felt like he would be leaving, soon. Tony wasn’t sure what exactly it was that gave him the impression, but the feeling was there, strong and sure. Unwelcome, uncomfortable, but he would never try to keep Bucky from making his own decisions. Even if it broke Steve’s heart. And his, if he was being perfectly honest.
“Yes. Yes Steve, that is okay, what do you think? Even if I didn’t like the guy, who am I to dictate who my daughter’s allowed to talk to or not? I mean, as long as the guy is not a sociopath or something like that.” Steve stared at him, wide-eyed.
“I don’t know. It’s not- it’s not that I thought you wouldn’t be okay with it, it’s just- it’s hard, that’s all.”
Tony found Bucky sitting outside on the porch after breakfast the next day. He was holding a cup of coffee in his hand but not drinking it, not really. It seemed more as if it was only there as a prob, as a reason to linger for a while, here, before starting the day. Not that Bucky had any plans, at least as far as Tony knew.
Okay, now Tony definitely didn’t know what to say anymore. Steve’s smile was still there, but sad and small, not brilliant and hopeful anymore. He wanted that one back, that one had been so much better. It had been a while, Tony realized, since he’d last seen that smile. So, in the end, it wasn’t that hard, figuring out what to do, what to say. He squeezed his hand a bit, as if to make sure that Steve was still holding it, was still there.
“I’m not so sure I believe you, but you know what, I’m not gonna argue. I made it, which is already more than I expected. Also, I’ve learned by now that you are always right, so…” He grinned at hear, pleased when she grinned back and leaned over to give him another kiss. Even if his kid decided that they were being gross and also didn’t pay enough attention to her. Which meant that the next couple of minutes were filled with her shrieking and laughing, as they paid her all the attention she could stand in form of cuddles, kisses and tickling.
“I’m in possession of a phone, yes Steve,” he deadpanned. Oh, would you look at that, even more blushing. Bucky was laying all over the table by now, laughing. “I’m surrounded by a bunch of idiots.”
“Oh no, I wanted to come, I wanted to call you, but- Happy said you were still recovering, and- I didn’t know, I thought maybe you didn’t want-“
“Maybe. But I feel like he needs to talk to someone at some point. Might as well be Clint. If he’s open to it, of course.”
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Peter finally said, which did not help against the worrying at all. Tony nodded.
“I think Peter’s right. It’s a really beautiful story, about how horrible it is to have to hide yourself, your true self and how freeing it can be to receive and accept help. And how important it is to accept your kids as they are, no matter what.”
Peter slowly reached out and shook her hand. He didn’t even try to hide the way he was looking at her, obviously fascinated. Tony could understand him, he had felt pretty much the same, the first time he met her. Or rather, during the time they spent together in space.
“Thank you,” he breathed, and for the first time in years, Tony was sure that everything would be okay.
Now that Nebula had joined their little group, Peter tried to get her to play, too. This not only lead to an introduction in videogames and how to play them, but also to a long discussion about zombies, what they were and why they were to be killed. Explaining the concept of a zombie to a cyborg wasn’t as easy as it sounded.
They sat in silence for a while and Tony could definitely tell that Peter was calmer now. The important part of the conversation was done, whatever else there was would be okay. In the end, it was Tony who broke the silence.
“Yes, that. That’s what it feels like.” Bucky was smiling, almost relieved. Tony nodded, smiled back.
Oh. “Oh.” That was unexpected. But good, obviously. “Yes! Yes please.” Steve smiled, nodded. He leaned in for another quick kiss, but then he turned away and got to work on the food again. He asked a couple of quiet questions while he set the table, mostly about where stuff was (including a candle, because Steve was apparently a romantic), but otherwise they didn’t talk much.
He sat there for a moment, phone in hand, thinking. After a while, Morgan came outside and climbed on his lap.
Truth to be told, Tony didn't know what exactly was bothering him. Maybe it was everything. The whole Accords situation. Ross breathing down his neck. The empty compound. His best friends damaged legs. The fact that he was getting too fucking
"Now that is definitely new.", the genius replied and set down his glass, "What is it that I can do for you?"
For the first time in years, it was not Tony Stark the anger was directed at, a surprise to probably everyone in the room who worked with Ross for long enough. No, the source was one Steven Grant Rogers aka Captain America aka proclaimed criminal who broke his imprisoned teammates out of the Raft, Ross super-secret high-security prison as if stealing a pack of chewing gum from a corner store.
She looked at him for a while, really looked. Her eyes roamed over his partly hidden face and body, taking him in and making him feel exposed. She was good at that and it was one of the reasons they worked well together. She always seemed to know something was wrong, knew to not let the mask he set up for the public determine him. They were both silent for a few moments, just standing in the corridor outside the conference room, the other members are long gone. "As long as you don't buy me a giant stuffed animal again."
He ignored the chuckle coming from his mentor in favor of inhaling the remaining slices. With his enhanced metabolism, good food was a must.
. Honestly, Tony had been in this hole before. Where he lived with the constant fear of the coming and struggled with his self-worth. It is nothing new. That doesn't mean it sucks any less though.
Tony cursed silently and rubbed his throbbing head, his eyes felt like they might pop out of his skull and his throat was itching, a cough building up in his lungs. "Shit, Rhodey. I-", he stopped, not so sure what he even wanted to say.
He began to loosen up his tie as his feet carried him down the hallways of the compound. To everyone else he would appear as collected, with his dark grey three pieced suit, his hair freshly washed and styled and the expensive cologne resting on his skin, if it weren't for the flaring of his nostrils and his furrowed eyebrows that gave away his irritated anger.
The two heroes were lounging on the barstools around the kitchen island, the cool grey marble a nice feeling on his sweaty skin. After getting checked over by the medical staff stationed at the compound and declared free to go, Tony insisted on ordering take-out after having to listen to Peter's stomach rumble on the whole way back.
He was in the midst of the Manhattan afternoon traffic when FRIDAY notified him through his phone. Happy was in the driver's seat, grumbling and cursing at the other cars and the traffic lights, but Tony didn't pay attention to any of it, already used to the man cursing like a sailor. Instead, he focused on the blinking message on his screen and FRIDAY's voice that sounded from the microphone.
Tony let out a long-suffering sigh and poured himself a cup of water. As he closed the fridge he duly noted that they were short on groceries, though he didn't really care. He silently leaned against the counter and sipped on his drink, wishing it was alcohol now more than ever. He was about to fish his phone out of his suit pocket when he saw T'Challa enter the room out of the corner of his eye.
"I'm in the city for the next few days. Should anything occur that would require my assistance...I believe you know how to find me.", the king of Wakanda said and clasped the hands behind his back before smiling at the older man once again and then making his way out of the kitchen.
Tony just checked the time before closing the holograms for good. 1:13 pm. Way too early to even consider dealing with the Secretary.
He hesitated before answering, Rhodey only waiting to hammer his self-worth back into his head. "Alright."
"I was hoping I would find you here.", the King said and stopped a few feet away from the engineer. He held himself tall as always, his clothes without wrinkles and a small open smile resting on his lips.
Tony barely looked at him as he practically threw open the car door and stepped on the sidewalk, pulling the suitcase out behind him. Then he stuck his head back inside the car and said, "Drive back to the compound and inform the medical staff of a possible patient."
Tony choose to ignore the spilled drink and just took the cup from DUM-E who let out a few beeps and rotated his claw before driving off to another corner of Tony's private lab. He sniffed at the drink before actually drinking it, having learned from past mistakes, and found the smell of definitely not coffee like he hoped, but motor oil.
Another thing on the list of things he does wrong. Pepper is an outstanding CEO and better for Stark Industries than he could've ever been. He must admit, when he first made Pepper take over the company, it was because she was the only option. He was dying and had not much time left, the least he could do was make sure that his company was in good hands after he was gone. Also, Pepper deserved to be rewarded for the many years she put up with him as his PA.
"Sorry that I don't believe you.", Rhodes replied, "Tones, I have known you since college. Something is eating you up and if you are not going to talk about it, then you will never solve your problems. You can't run away from it forever."
"Oh, please. Without me, you wouldn't have survived college so tone down your blabbing and put on some damn shoes already!"
"Ross has planned a meeting regarding the Accords. He wishes for everyone to be present, especially you, as you bailed out the last few times.", Rhodey didn't even sound accusing, just tired and Tony could not blame him.
It was a rhetorical question, Tony knew, so he didn't bother answering. He just stepped away from the clearly frustrated woman and made his way further down the corridor. "I gotta go now. See you, Pep."
Pepper sighed before stopping her gaze on Tony's black shades, "Why are you even wearing these? It's raining outside, you'll hardly need them."
The inventor let himself fall back onto his chair and sighed heavily, "I'm fine, honestly. I've been busy lately. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Sorry, it's just-", he stopped himself, "When is your brother going to be back again?" The question was directed at Shuri who turned in her wheeled chair beside Bucky.
When the papers were somewhat organized he looked down at his attire. His old band shirt was dirty and far beyond saving from grease stains. His jeans were ripped at some parts and he wasn't wearing any shoes. He glanced around the space to search for them but then decided to fuck it and gave all his attention to his hair instead.
Now, with the fixed suit in his backpack, Peter was escorted to the main entrance to meet Happy. Tony just listened as the boy kept on rambling about how cool this afternoon has been and didn't try to hide the small smile stealing its way on his lips.
The redheaded woman went and opened her mouth to make a remark but the engineer beat her to it, "I know what you're going to say.", he said and held his hands up in a defensive stance when he saw the way Pepper cocked her head to the right and put her hands to her hips, mastering the disappointed-mum-move with bravura. "And I'm sorry, Pep, I swear. I'll make it up to you."
After that he spent the rest of the time in his workshop, blasting music over the speakers, so loud it felt like his eardrums were bleeding. In the end, there would be no one to tell him to tone it down anyway. So he just sat there and did what he did best, building stuff from scrap and giving it ridiculous names while living off of coffee and a sandwich he questioned was still edible. A pitiful existence, good that nobody was there to see him.
Bucky was relieved when he heard the news that the Wakandan's were so nice to replace his arm. It was unfamiliar to not feels the weight of the metal dragging down his left shoulder, to feel the metal fusing with the scarred skin of his shoulder, and to be able to grab things with his left hand even though he was right-handed.
Tony looked guilty when he met Pepper's eyes. He could see the hardness with an undertone of worry in her's and felt his hands fist the cloth on the inside of his suit pants pocket. "I know, Pep, and I'm sorry. You always try you're best to navigate the company and I make it difficult. I am sorry."
They were already outside. Happy was waiting in the black limousine for Peter to drive home but the question made Tony stop in his tracks for a short moment.
While the king of Wakanda has an easy persona and was one of the few people Tony quite enjoyed talking to whenever he had to sit through meetings, he wouldn't consider them any kind of friends. They had fought on the same team in Germany, although for different reasons, and T'Challa was a good ally to have around. He had no hard feelings regarding the help he provided for Rogers and Barnes in Siberia and in all honesty, it was quite amusing how the man with all the answers was sitting directly under Ross' nose without the latter knowing. He guessed it gave some kind of superiority, knowing stuff Thaddeus Ross didn't.
After a few deep breaths, Tony spoke, "They are coming back. The nightmares I mean." His voice is shaking, so different from the usual Tony Stark.
"And your burned chicken breast?", Tony wanted to know and pointed at the already healing skin hidden under the shirt.
"Tony, listen to me. What happened at the airport with me, was not your fault. Stop blaming yourself for things that you had no control over.", he said slowly, his tone stayed steady as he held the other man's gaze, "You are a brilliant and smart man, but in the end, you are only human too. And yes, not being able to walk without these braces sucks, but at least I
Tony held his breath as his AI fed him all the data she collected from Peter's suit, a function he integrated for exactly such a situation. It seems all the layers that make his suit has been pierced, a fact that surprised Tony a bit. What the hell is he fighting? Because Tony tried to make sure that the teenager's suit would be safe against any kind of blade, bullet, or even fire. A way to keep Peter from injuries and make Tony feel better about letting a fourteen-year-old fight people in the streets.
So yeah, working with Peter felt very similar to how he had felt all those years ago. But it was also very different. Not only were they not in an underground workshop in a fancy house in Malibu. They spent most of the time right here, in the living room, playing around with holograms and FRIDAY. They would of course move to production trials very soon (which meant moving over to the garage, which was still something that made Tony laugh), but for now, they were content with research and hypothetical trails.
“Let me- I know it’s your house, and we cooked together, but- let me take you on a date, here, right now.”
“That’s fine, too. You don’t have to know right now. The only think that you need to know is that you don’t have to leave. You can stay here, doing nothing, doing whatever you want, and take your time to figure it all out. We’ll be happy to have you around, Steve and I, and all of us. Morgan loves you.”
“I’m fine, mostly. I’m okay with showers, and baths too, most days. It’s just- well, I definitely don’t like swimming anymore.” Bucky nodded again. Then he suddenly straightened a bit.
He was pretty sure there was someone sitting next to him. He had no idea where that was, where he was, although if he had to guess, the first guess would be hospital. That is, if he was actually still alive and not, you know, waking up in heaven or something like that. Not that he believed in that, but he had met, fought and befriended aliens, so he was not really sure in what to believe anyhow. It seemed like everything might be possible, these days. Maybe even wielding a gauntlet made for gods.
“Well, she’s not as murderous as she used to be, so I guess you could almost classify her as fun,” he said. Tony frowned. Did he know murderous people? Apart from Natasha, of course, but she didn’t really count as a guest anymore.
“Steve, I-“ Steve must have known what he was going to say, because he was already shaking his head.
“I don’t know. All of it. Coming out, telling someone, it’s always hard, no matter how much you- well.”
She snuggled into his arms, clearly intending to stay for a while. Maybe that was what he needed, a bit of moral support.
Tony watched as Nebula brought Morgan to bed with an endless patience for her questions and stories. The fact that Nebula was blue and partly machine didn’t seem to bother her. But then again, she grew up with Iron Man as her father, so maybe it was to be expected.
“Thank you.” He reached out to her, took her hand. “I need you to know that you are always welcome here. No matter what happens, no matter how long ago your last visit was, I will always want you here.”
“Why not?” Happy then ask, clearly thinking that this was a stupid thing to do. Tony agreed. Maybe he had waited too long.
“Thank you,” he whispered, before turning away and fleeing to the kitchen. Nobody called him out, or back, and even Steve gave him a couple of minutes to compose himself. He had always known that Clint saw more than he let them know about, of course he did. It was his job, had saved his life (and Natasha’s, if the stories could be believed in) countless times. But to be seen, so deeply, by Clint was- devastating, almost, even if it was in a good way.
“Slow down Tony, you shouldn’t push yourself too hard, yet,” she said, while contradicting herself and helping him to fully sit up and passing him a glass of water. Granted, it had a metal straw in it, but still, apparently, he was allowed to hold it all by himself. Yay for the little things. He took a sip, then just held the glass in his hands, setting it down in his lap.
But it wasn’t just with Morgan. He was that way with Sam, too, even though their relationship was sometimes a bit weird. They were downright mean to each other, but fiercely protective at the same time. Pretty similar to the relationship Bucky and Steve had, actually, with the only difference that they weren’t quite as mean to each other. Tony had the impression, that this was mainly because Bucky was too insecure, and the whole relationship was too fragile, after everything that had happened.
“Wasn’t sure if that’s still open,” Nebula said, leaning casually on the kitchen door frame. She looked good and seeing her made Tony realize how much he’d missed her. But before he could answer, Peter saw her.
Tony wasn’t surprised when Steve showed up. He hadn’t been sure, not really, not with Barnes and Wilson being back, but yeah, he wasn’t surprised. He was sitting on the porch when he noticed the car, a couple of days after Rhodey had left, after having pushed it back for as long as possible. It was calm, almost too calm, after everything that had happened during the last couple of days, weeks. So, when the car drove closer, he perked up, grinning expectantly.
They spent the next couple of minutes in comfortable silence, while Tony tried to familiarize himself with the arm. It was very interesting, of course, and brilliant, as was everything that Shuri made.
“Fine,” he managed. His voice was rusty and slurred and he was grateful for the ice chips that Rhodey slid into his mouth. “What happened?” he asked, as soon as he felt like he had enough energy to get the words out.
As expected, Bucky stared at him with wide eyes, like Morgan did when she was caught with her hand right in the cookie jar. It could have been almost comical, if it wasn’t so sad that Bucky was still expecting the worse, was still almost breathlessly waiting for the moment the pushed him out of their bed. So yeah, they needed this conversation.
“Villainy. Or at least that’s what I call it. Basically, it means every bad thing you did because you were forced to, everything that you’d never have done if you’d have had a choice. But you didn’t.” Bucky frowned.
“Humans are good at pack bonding,” she said, as if this was something that she had read somewhere or heard. Not experienced.
“To see me, I think. To- He’s going to bring the stones back where they belong, into their timeline. He’s- I think he came to say goodbye.”
“You’re not- Steve, you’re not hurting me. Sure, it sucks, and I wish you could stay, but I understand why you can’t. It’s okay, I promise.”
Bucky nodded. Tony hesitated for a moment, weirdly reminded of the night before. They sat here just like now, in silence. He wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t even sure if there was anything at all that he could say. To make this better, easier somehow, even though he didn’t really know what
“Yeah, you could help us, I’m sure you’re much better at it than I am. And you don’t have to go swimming, Bucky and I can watch her in the water,” Steve added. Tony sighed.
“I- Because I wanted to. Because you might not come back and I hate missing chances, even after everything that happened and… I don’t know, I just wanted to, I guess.” Steve nodded, face still serious and calm. Unreadable in a way, which did not make the whole situation any easier.
“I fought my way out of that cave, years and years ago. The arc reactor saved my life, but after that- They wanted me to build weapons and I refused. I don’t- I build the first armor instead. Clunky thing, could hardly even move or see where I was going. Didn’t have many weapons either. Flamethrowers, mainly. I remember, standing in the entrance of that cave, looking outside, seeing all those weapons that I had made and that had found their way into the hands of terrorists. I burned them all, everything. Then I flew away. I-“ He paused, took a deep breath. Bucky was staring at him with wonder in his eyes, as it this whole thing was something to admire. Tony sighed. “The arc reactor isn’t what makes me Iron Man. Yes, Steve destroying it sucked, but he didn’t- he didn’t destroy Iron Man, not really. He could never have done that. And he didn’t kill me. He could have, but he didn’t.”
“Hey Tony,” she called back, “it’s really good to see you, talk to you later, I’m gonna steal your wife for a bit.” Tony snorted.
“Are you alright?” Rhodey asked, as he joined Tony on the couch, where he was watching the kids trying to stop a zombie invasion. He smiled.
“Okay, thank you for telling me. Do you- do you want me to use different pronouns or another name or anything?”
Peter had apparently overcome his nervousness and was asking Nebula a thousand questions. She accepted her fate with good grace. Tony was pretty sure she was having fun, even, and his assessment seemed confirmed by the fond smile on Rhodey’s face.
So this is how he ended up sitting on a beach towel in the sun, watching his daughter playing and running around with Steve. Bucky mostly sat next to him, apparently content to watch them as well.
“She hasn’t really left your side, these last couple of days. It took a while to make sure that you’d make it and we’re really glad for Dr. Cho’s help, but as soon as they let her, she was right here, at your side. Not even Pepper could get her to budge, so in the end we decided to just sit with her, with both of you. She’s real stubborn, that kid of yours.”
They ended up almost burning the veggies, still standing in the kitchen, still kissing. It was Steve who noticed, of course he did. He pulled away, took them out of the oven, being the responsible adult that he was. Tony didn’t care about dinner anymore, though, he just wanted to go back to kissing. If tonight was all he got, then he wanted to enjoy it as much as he could.
The man was incorrigible. Just perfect for Steve, if not perfect overall, as he often liked to remind both of them. And Steve scoffed every time, who needed perfect anyway? How boring.
Steve swore he could see stars. He forced himself to stay put, waiting for the man to do whatever it was he had planned. It was soon obvious it was going to be longer before he would get his release when Tony moved away. The cold air on the wet skin of his scrotum made Steve groan.
“Right? I figured that as soon as I said it. I can’t exactly go around calling you my l— never mind.”
New York was soothing to Steve. It had always been, even back when he was tiny and everything was much bigger and much more overwhelming. People were rushing everywhere, even when they were out for a stroll. Bucky and him used to joke all the time that the world had a different speed in New York.
He wished he could go out for a run or for a walk. But the world was not keen on letting him just be. He wondered, not for the first time, how famous people did it. Clint reminded him that he was famous as well, and he counter-argued that
“Fine! But we all want breakfast. This one’s been cooking it for hours and we weren’t allowed in here,” he said, gesturing towards Tony.
“At least I can get drunk,” Bruce offered, and Steve found himself laughing. It was useless to think people hadn’t noticed his reaction, but this, this he could deal with.
The fall out from his intervention was relentless. They worked systematically, digging out more crap from his past than he ever wanted to see or remember. On the one hand, his critics kept shouting he wasn’t really Captain
He had a soft expression on as he looked back at Steve. He was bouncing on his heels again, fidgeting with his glasses and shuffling his feet every now and then. “I want to kiss you again,” he informed Steve.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Not even gonna entertain that.” But Nat had more patience than he did in staring contests, and besides, he had shit to sort out, preparations to see to. “For Christ’s sake. You,” he pointed to her, “have been putting aside gifts every year, waiting for when you can give them to him. You”, he pointed to Bucky, “if you sharpen that knife with the wooden handle I
Steve slid lower in his seat. He let go of his poor hard cock with a twinge of regret. “I almost said it’s show time, but I don’t think I can seriously be this corny.” He moved his legs over the arms of the chair, pushing his ass out to expose himself as prettily as he could. He pushed down his embarrassment once more, unable to stop the blush from spreading on both his cheeks and his chest.
“Common thing, I wouldn’t worry about it too much.” He walked around for a bit, inspecting the worn carvings on the furniture. “Is this a sixties spy movie though? What do you think, Cap? Feeling the Soviet oppression looming yet?”
“I never thought I could touch you like this,” Steve confessed. “I never thought I would be allowed to hold you and,” he licked Tony’s lower lip before initiating another tongue battle in the man’s mouth, ”and kiss you, and make you moan –”
The man was grinning, so it was a logical assumption to think he knew exactly what he was doing. “You’re playing dirty, Stark,” Steve admonished lightly.
and his thoughts overwhelming. When Natasha suggested they go in the teacups, he gladly accepted. The impending breakdown would have to wait until New York, at least. Even longer, if he could put it off. Longer, perhaps he could take a roadtrip on his bike and cry in a tent in the woods or something.
“Who?” Tony was lost for a second. “Oh! Darling, I don’t care about her. That was years ago, back when I just took over the company.” He continued trying to get to Steve’s inner thigh. Eventually, he shifted forward and bent his head. Begrudgingly, Steve moved his leg to the side, allowing access. “And don’t tell me you and Barnes never did the deed,” he threw casually, resuming the little licks that made Steve sigh contentedly.
Tony approached him, muscles all lean and skin glistening as it dried. He kissed him sweetly, cupping his warm cheeks. “Was he being crude?”
Thor laughed. “That mother was going to kill him for eating an enchanted apple. And that I missed him,” he said much quieter.
It was easily Steve’s favourite thing in the world. “Fuck, that feels so good!” He was unable to decide if he wanted to push back on Tony’s fingers or up into his mouth, so his body decided for him, starting a rocking motion that made him moan, his throat hoarse with panting.
Tony looked up from between his legs, with his cheeks flushed and his lips glistening with spit. “Are you about to get possessive?” he asked breathlessly.
Steve grabbed his hair forcefully. “Every time I’ll see your hands I’ll be thinking of this, Tony. It was bad enough I was fantasising about your mouth before, but now I
The one time Steve couldn’t - literally couldn’t, try as he might - shut up about how attractive Tony Stark was. He felt his blood boiling, threatening to burst through his veins with emotion. Words poured out, volume fluctuating depending on how he managed to regain temporary control. Steve could see the nature of this latest disaster, and watched it like a slow-motion video, unable to prevent it or look away.
His first thought was that Hydra had captured him. He could tell he was being watched, so with his heartbeat gone into overdrive, he listened for signs. There was a clear indent on the mattress next to him, and he tried to come up with a plan. If Hydra had him they wouldn’t get in bed with him, right? Was he even in bed anymore? He wished more than anything he could dive and reach for his shield. But its usual spot at the foot of the bed was empty in the name of diplomatic missions and Steve could have honestly punched something in frustration.
“Dinner smells great. Ah, I missed you,” Tony sighed, lifting his hand to hold on to Steve’s shoulder. “Missed this,” he added.
“I stood and listened to you go on and on about this and that and maybe I’d have walked away and processed everything and then come up with a plan. But then you mentioned the fucking star, and I swear to god Banner, you’re the worst!” Darcy told him in one breath. She looked at Steve and grabbed the bottle out of his hands with a quiet “thanks,” then poured a glass and downed it.
Steve nodded. He inhaled deeply, rubbing his nose under the arc reactor. The fabric was a hindrance, but Tony’s smell filled his nostrils and his head, and he was pleased. “I do.”
Tony hugged him then. Kind and gently, like a flutter of a hug. For someone who was usually so blunt, Tony was acting with the utmost of care. Steve’s body was treacherous and decided human contact was grounds for tensing suddenly. Tony started to pull back. “Oh, Steve! I’m sorry, I didn’t know what else to do.”
Steve facepalmed. “Nothing, I’m an innocent old man. Please play the movie,” he told Clint in a small voice.
Steve’s endearment towards the woman surged. She regarded him over her half moon reading glasses. Her gray hair was pulled back in an intricate bun, and her thin red lips lifted in a kind smile. “I just wish you’d give them a chance, that’s all. A strong woman like you, it just wouldn’t be fair now, would it?”
Steve’s words died in his throat when the man took a testicle in his mouth, sucking it rigorously. Then he moved lower, and nothing in the world could have prepared Steve for what was coming. Tony had flattened his tongue and proceeded to lick his tight hole in broad strokes, holding his balls up with a hand and pulling an asscheek to the side to make room.
“That could work.” It’s been on his mind since Natasha mentioned Doom. It’s an extreme solution, true, but it would also solve their problem. He’s just glad Barton said it instead of him.
Steve’s nose was nestled into the short curly hair at the base, trying his best to force his throat to not react. He could feel the tiniest of burns in the corners of his mouth as he sucked, courtesy of the impressive girth stretching his lips. He flattened his tongue as he pulled up, flicking it rapidly when he reached the head. He sucked on it, catching the sensitive gentle rim on his lips repeatedly until Tony managed to take advantage of his shift in focus and bucked his hips once Steve loosened his hold on him.
Pietro was allowed around the tower on the 24th. They’d visited him and decorated his hospital bed and even put a nice wreath on the door. Wanda tied bows on it, and Darcy covered it in glitter and silver beads. They took to singing loudly whenever Pietro’s whining got too much, which was roughly eight times a day that they knew of. Bruce kept feeding him sweets to quiet him, and Clint smuggled pizza in one night.
Steve found the power Tony exerted to be exhilarating. The way he was standing next to him, the glow of the arc reactor. He watched him move to the end of the bed, then climb to kneel at his feet.
He knows time slowing down as Horrible takes over him. Like he’s caught in tar, trying to outrun the pain. He knows the despair intimately. He now knows what it feels like to watch Steve die. And wanting to plummet to his death as every horrendous emotion he ever experienced takes over.
Steve nodded, certain that if he opened his mouth to speak, he’d just blurt out his feelings. And things had been going well, there was no reason to ruin everything by shouting about his love and such. He moved to the other side of the bed to get water, then he offered it to Tony silently.
“Presents.” He paused to pull his shirt out of his trousers. “Look,” he started, stopping to look at Tony seriously. “It doesn’t have to be loud, we can just have a nice dinner, have a couple of drinks. I understand being uncomfortable so I won’t push if you really don’t want a party. But let the others get you things? They just want to –”
She didn’t plan anything, didn’t mention it at all, and Steve was fine. He’d bought her a hand carved wooden jewelry box from a thrift shop in Brooklyn months before. It reminded him of her with its intricate edges and vintage finish, and Steve was a sucker for gifting people things he thought they’d like. He was ready to wrap it up and present her with it at midnight if she was around, or for breakfast, and he was absolutely fine with it. In hindsight, he would have preferred it, if only to avoid a metaphorical train. Steve was less and less fond of trains with each passing minute.
Clint was carrying a huge tray of what looked like reasonably sized jell-o dicks. Steve wasn’t sure what he was seeing, but he had a Bad Feeling about it. Not like when a villain would pop out of nowhere before breakfast and coffee, but close.
Bennu pushed her little head into Thor’s chest. “Yes. It was only for a short time, but I missed him so much. So I found a book and learned the spell to be able to communicate with animals. At first I could only speak cow and Loki laughed at me. Then he helped me find the right spell. And now I can speak goat,” he shrugged.
She blushed and it warmed Steve’s heart. “Thank you, Steve,” she said and pulled him to the bar. “Come on, the others were asking about you.”
One of the more brazen reporters approached them. He had a large smarmy grin on his face, something Steve associated with a real estate agent. Or a shark loan. Or a propaganda-fuelled agenda. “Stark, Rogers, how do you feel about messing up this time?” He had a camera guy he siked on them silently.
He welcomed the relative quiet and solitude while he tried to command his thoughts to re-enter some sort of order. He went to run his hands through his hair and of course he’d forgotten and watched the man he was suddenly aware he was attracted to deepthroating a jell-o dick while wearing a plastic tiara. Because being frozen for seventy years wasn’t ridiculous enough. He uselessly drank some more.
Tony snorted and offered Bruce a glass of bourbon. “Yeah, no,” he said, repeating Darcy’s words. “On the right track though, so props.”
“What I want is for you to take me in your throat and finger me until I weep,” he admitted with a sigh.
“Look at me.” Steve did. The fingers pressed on his tongue, moving up to settle in his mouth. “Suck.”
“Oh, I’ll pass,” Steve said with a small smile. “The serum removed my gag reflex, it wouldn’t be fair.” He was happy to make his friends laugh, but he was still not going to slobber over some vodka filled jelly dicks. Even though he could. And he would probably win. Still wasn’t doing it.
It was extremely intimate. There was a flash of fear that Steve’s broadness would be dwarfing, but he snuggled into Tony, leaned his head back to let Tony kiss him sweetly, deeply. He felt his boyfriend’s hand move to touch his cock. “I don’t know if I can,” he sighed.
“Called in some favours, talked to Peggy, the usual. Is it okay? I’m sorry if I’ve overstepped the line or -”
Bruce sighed and walked around the bar. He rubbed his face with both his hands and pulled Darcy in a hug. “I want you more than I’ve ever wanted anything.”
Tony’s hands shoot up to placate him. “I’m innocent, see? I’m just here on your orders, trying to help them and they’re being bratty and –”
Bruce coughed once to draw attention to him and immediately regretted based on his lost look. Darcy touched his hand and smiled. “My aunt gets drunk every year and slaps the turkey,” she offered with a shrug.
Sleepy-horny Tony was adorable, Steve decided. He moved to lie down on his front in between the man’s legs, pushing them apart determinedly. He kissed his inner thighs in turns, careful not to actually touch the angry hardness in front of him. He licked and bit up to the tendon on each side, then started once more at the knees. Tony was openly thrashing on the bed, thrusting his hips towards Steve’s face.
“What?” His grin disappeared and a small frown formed exactly where Steve knew it would, the tiniest bit to the left of his face, right above his eyebrow.
Steve remembered not to shake his head so he grunted instead. Tony seemed to understand because he kneeled next to him, rubbing his back in comforting circles.
Natasha informed him it was healthy progress, and he had to admit it was great to have some sort of positive feedback, nosy as it was. “I make him smile or laugh sometimes and it’s just – I think it’s the best part of my day,” he explained it to her.
“You know you could have ordered all the decorations and everything on Amazon, right? I mean we do have Prime and just saying, you could have if you wanted.”
Steve wanted to hug Tony again, but there was a time and a place and probably a limit on how many times they could do that. If Steve had his way he would hug Tony at the smallest of prompts. Oh, Tony woke up? Better hug him. Oh, Tony walked? Better hug him. Now there was a precedent - Steve thought fleetingly there were quite a few of those happening recently - and Steve knew how it felt. Things were not going to get any easier.
Steve was prepared for some opposition, but it was a bit more visceral than he’d expected. “We create a task force and go… shopping,” he finished dramatically, adding a fake gasp for good measure.
“I love how responsive you are,” he whispered, licking in circles across Steve’s chest. His hips twitched every now and then. “I love how your skin tastes, I love that you smell like my shower gel. I love that you’re patient with me and that you’re kind when I get in my head. Oh, god, I love that you smell like my shower gel.”
He heard them talk quietly, but focused on tasks he set for himself. It was uncommon for him to be this moody and this grumpy and this everything, really, but it seemed that ever since Natasha’s birthday, Tony had a horrendously large impact on his mind. Anxiety wasn’t new to Steve, neither were self-doubt, lack of confidence, and overthinking. His mind was loud on good days, and his brain worked better when he had to actively focus.
Tony spent the entire fight in his ear baseball commentary style, accents and voices accurately done. He had to fight the urge to laugh as he climbed onto the back of a Doombot and bashed it with his shield.
He kept hearing Tony’s harsh words, then Tony’s protests towards the t-shirts that fit better, then what he thought was some sort of friendly flirting, and it took forever for him to actually manage to sleep. When the knock came on his door, Steve felt like it was too soon, and grunted his dismissal. Much later, when he finally got up and showered, his head hurt in a way it only did when there was a physical injury. He wondered if it was actually a memory of the headaches he used to get before the serum. It was close to noon when he emerged from his room, and his stupid fast metabolism reminded him that it needed food and it needed it soon.
With a sigh, he turned on his back, shamelessly thrusting up into Tony’s hand. “What would you like to know?”
If Tony died – but he couldn’t think about it. He couldn’t think about it because he would pass out with grief. And if he passed out with grief who was going to help Tony? He hated the heat, but he could put up with it better than others. The smell of farm animals mixed with the smell of burnt
touching Steve’s cock. They were chest to chest, eyes focused on each other. “Give it to me,” he told Steve. The click of the swivel hook was loud in the quiet room, it felt definitive and
Clint shoved pigs in blankets in his mouth, throwing Steve a thumbs up and an enthusiastic nod. Bucky thanked him for making the roast potatoes the way his mother used to. Steve smiled widely and pointed towards the turkey. “Not that slapping it wouldn’t be amazing to watch,” he rolled his eyes, “but who wants to carve it?”
Steve’s anxiety roared in the dead center of his stomach. Tony’s idea of being alone suddenly didn’t seem so terrible anymore. After he and Bucky became friends, his mother used to say they had some sort of cosmic connection that would drive her mad one day. That was probably what brought Bucky to his side casually leaning on the same wall Steve was using as a prop.
Tony laughed and tapped his thigh again. “On all fours, come on. If you’re able to flirt with me, I’m not doing a good enough job distracting your brain.” When Steve didn’t comply, too busy humping into the bed like a horny teenager, Tony’s hand came down harder on his asscheek. Then his fingers plunged back into Steve, pressing him down into the mattress with the force.
Tony laughed, as he always did when Steve replied with that line. “Good, you’re alive. Now, what do you mean Natasha can charm everyone? And I can’t? What kind of bullshit is this, Steve? Do you not think I’m charming?” He nudged Steve with his foot repeatedly until the Captain finally gave up.
“And of course, you do nothing similar for her,” Steve told him casually. He knew the only reason Bruce was so talkative was a lethal combination of misery and alcohol.
Tony cupped his cheek. “You could never be a burden. Ever. Not to me, not to any of us.” Steve went quiet, trying not to lean into the touch. “We’re here for you. Steve.
“I’ve been curious since you walked in.” Tony had lifted his t-shirt to rest his hand on his hip, the strip of skin so familiar to Steve, a favourite place to plant kisses and rest his temple. “You wanna be good and show me?” The tender underlayer in that suggestion-order made Steve’s head swim.
Tony kissed him. Underneath what Steve was learning it was uniquely Tony, he could still taste himself slightly. He traced the rim of the arc reactor with soft fingers, then he pinched the man’s nipple. His hands ran freely, down on the curve of his ass, lower on his thigh. He could feel the warm precome trickle down on his skin, could feel the restrained grinding of hips.
The goat bleated quietly then, the first she’d spoken at all. “Oh, god. Steve, we have a goat now,” Nat informed him.
!” She turned to look at him and leaned over the table to kiss his forehead. Pietro joined her in wondering at the traditional Russian dish while Wanda mouthed her thanks.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m sure you have your suit bracelets on. I could just push you. No one would know. Who would believe the righteous Captain America threw Tony Stark off a roof?”
He’d been pathetic. But more than that, he had been pathetic in front of Tony, who was so gracious in how he handled a hysterical Steve unable to tell right from left. And Tony was easily the one person he did not want to be weak and needy in front of. By comparison, his public humiliation had been a piece of cake. This was personal, now deeply-rooted mortification of a whole new level. What had compelled him to lose his shit like that in front of the man he was in love with, he had no idea, but it had been done, and now he had to live with it for the rest of his days. He contemplated disappearing, but quickly gave up that plan when he realised there was no place he could really hide from Tony or SHIELD or Bucky or any of them, really. He was well and truly fucked.
Up on the stage he waved at the attendees cheering for him. He hated them. Outside, the people could probably have a spontaneous election and choose twenty people who would be more worthy of leading their country than the conglomerate of corruption sitting down in front of him. The big lights were on him now and he felt his stomach drop. What the fuck was he even thinking ever leaving Brooklyn? He cleared his throat.
Tony licked his lips and sipped his wine before replying. “You’re so beautiful,” he almost whispered. “So?”
“Oh, really? Well then, I better give you some good fucking memories.” He positioned himself back in between Steve’s legs. With steady fingers, he pulled the towel apart, unwrapping Steve. “It’s your birthday but it seems I’m getting the present. Fuck, that was corny even for me.”
“Captain, are you okay?” one of the faceless people asked, and Steve nodded, not trusting his voice. “We were thinking you could give the presentation on -”
“No! I watched him he can’t be his shield look I have –” He doesn’t. He doesn’t have the shield. He looks up at Bucky and his eyes are burning now. He forces himself to keep them open. To
“Yes,” she replied simply. “I am. Go back to the designated area or I’ll move you there. Hi, David!”
Steve smiled fondly at his phone, glad to be in the privacy of his room where no one could catch him doing so.
“Mhm,” he hummed as he pursed his lips to create the friction Tony wanted. It was potentially the most powerful he’d ever felt, to know he could reduce him to a needy begging mess. He pinned his hips down to stop him from thrusting up, determined to take his time.
“I know you’re not a fan. I really wanted us to have a kind-of-family thing just to make some nice memories, you know?” Tony nodded. “Thanks for making the tree spin, Clint is ecstatic.”
It was time. Both because Tony asked so nicely, but also because Steve needed to do something, anything before he burned up completely. He brought out a bottle of lube and the beads from the box.
“Sorted? Good. Get well soon.” He tapped Nat’s phone and ended the call. “Not cool, guys. He’s been hurt.”
“Can I suck you off, darling? Want to see if you can make my throat bulge like that?” He slid down, licking down from his bellybutton to the hair at the base of his cock.
Steve sighed. “I think there’s a place in some afterlife where Howard just tripped and had no idea why.”
“Got any ideas how to call it back into right here right now? Cause I could use some sleep,” Steve said with a frown.
Nat just raised her eyebrow. “Why do you think it’s that important to us?” Ah, yes. The self-appointed leader of the small group.
He pointedly ignored the bed where Tony slept, or the way the pillow had a slight indentation where the man’s head was. Steve was too gone, he knew he’d thought it before, but this new day brought a new strategy. Rather than ignoring it until it went away – because it clearly wouldn’t go away, maybe (tragically) ever –, he would think it as often as possible until it became so common it wouldn’t be as important. Never out loud though, that made it not only real, but dangerous. Everything was bugged and Tony was everywhere. Apparently paranoia was also a symptom of being horrendously in love with one’s teammate. How amazing.
He can, it turns out. The bot is decommissioned by their joint efforts, now a pile of future scrap on the ground. Steve is sporting a cheeky smile when he stops next to him briefly. “You make it hard to focus, sweetheart,” he whispers.
“Oh, my god! Captain, Sergeant Barnes was talking about how Mr. Stark is in between you two guys and how you’re some sort of…” Peter seemed to be losing steam as he went on with the explanation. “Master of seduction and then he’s actually not safe between you guys cause you’d be double-teaming him or something, I don’t know, just watch the damn movie,” he finished quietly. If voices could blush, it sounded like his just did.
“No, where have you been all my life?” Steve asked, the exchange now a running joke between them, months after that night.
He picked it up and hurried to the living room. As soon as he walked in, hair sticking out from running his hands through it, present perched on his hip, and eyes looking around wildly, Steve felt it. The same train from last time, with the same precise speed and the same merciless power. Steve felt like someone stabbed him in the kidneys. The force of his recurring epiphany was enough to make him stop abruptly and any words he might have thought of saying died in his constricted throat.
He paused. He couldn’t remember where in the speech he had planned to deflect this farce and rejoin his personal efforts towards a better world. He shrugged to himself, deciding this was a good a time as any. He folded the papers and put them back in his pocket.
“And you thought you needed to dress up to seduce me!” Tony pulled him to his feet and out of the room. “Speaking of which, what’s this I hear about you seducing me?”
He shrieked when he saw the tree, trying to make his wheelchair go faster. “It’s so great,” he said in awe. He turned to Wanda, then to all his teammates gathered around it. “It’s been -”
Decisions were normally pretty simple for Steve. You know, get into a fight or not? Fly a plane into a frozen sea or not? That sort of thing. This was a tad more difficult. Either way, there was definite potential for humiliation and / or extensive over thinking for weeks.
Steve’s face seemed to go numb for a second. “I doubt we’ll both fit, Tony. We’re not exactly small built,” he laughed.
What? That was his line. Tony had just walked out of what was essentially a life-threatening situation. He was supposed to ask that. He opened his mouth to reply, but words wouldn’t come out. So he nodded and made a face, trying to convey his worry.
“I will literally take this stiletto off and hammer it into your head,” Natasha said calmly as she tried to get Clint dressed. “How are you this inept? You can shoot a moving target 500 feet away without looking but a suit gets you so confused you have to sit down.”
Tony paused. Then opened his mouth. Then closed it. Then closed his eyes. Then smiled. When he opened them, Steve’s breath caught in his throat.
people had it much worse. They at least had the option to go away and be anonymous in their own way, in some remote area. He suggested it once, in passing, and the aftermath had not been great. They all insisted that temporary relocation to the Compound was ill-advised. Especially Bucky, who had always had a knack for knowing when Steve’s mind got loud. He had spoken out, then others nodded their approval, and that was it. He was to stay in New York, to avoid getting too into his own head. It was heartwarming, how much they wanted to protect him, but it was also painful that he couldn’t go regroup alone.
Steve froze. It was the same voice, the same word, the same happy tone. Again, it was surreal, and panic surged through his body. There was no way Tony could have known about that, but there was no way a lot of things, and here he was, in the future and a superhero. He shook himself and sat up, letting the duvet pool in his lap.
Steve wanted to argue, but he yawned again. “Okay.” He got up and together they dumped everything in the sink in the corner.
The imagined assailant was a lady who looked positively ancient; the hand grasping his forearm was bony, but strong. The most striking thing about her appearance was her cloudy eyes, framed by white tendrils that escaped the harsh bun she had her hair in.
Steve’s nerves were multilayered. Which yeah, given the magnitude of his anxiety issues, was kind of an amusing statement. So he’d seen little of Tony that week. The man had been gone for a couple of days, then Steve had training sessions, then they’d had more crap to deal with, and all they had the energy to do was make out like teens and fumble in the dark, heated whispers before they fell asleep spooning. It was cute, Steve surmised. But he also missed Tony’s touch and having his undivided attention.
“Yeah, that’s closer to the truth, I reckon,” she said and Steve wanted to understand what was happening but he also wanted to find this photo and maybe make it his wallpaper.
Steve had fucked up. Some teenagers came up and politely asked for photos. A couple of brave ones took selfies. This was going to be a mediatic disaster. Even with everyone on his side, the opposing media will have months of twisting his words monstrously. Every selfie he took was another week of derogatory rhetoric towards him and by extension his superhero family. Fuck.
There were logic problems there, but it wasn’t worth debating them, so Steve took the statement as it was, and leaned in to pull the duvet tighter around Tony. “Me too,” was all he said, ambiguous as it was.
If Steve was more conceited, he could have sworn Bruce said “I know he’s hot”, but he refused to accept it. He urged them all to keep shredding wrapping paper and they mercifully agreed. He caught Tony’s eye for a second and was left confused about what the scowl on his teammate’s face meant. There was a distinct annoyance in the way Tony stared at the t-shirts. Steve moved on to unwrap a cologne from Natasha and a foldable easel that had his initials brutally carved on the side. He could recognise Bucky’s ugly handwriting everywhere.
They were all holding bits of mistletoe, waving it frantically in the general space above them. It wasn’t in sync, but as close as kind of tipsy Avengers managed. They all leaned in and kissed various parts of his body they could reach. He felt a wet one on the back of his head, and just knew the loud smooching noises were Bucky’s. There was a gentle one on his temple, some on his arms, a bearded one on his forehead. He felt himself blush, and his mortification only increased when he realised Tony had his phone out and was taking pictures. The scientist’s eyes were sparkling with mirth and potential laughing tears.
“Hey, Mr. Epitome? What have you and those two degenerates done with the triple chocolate fudge brownie and cherry ice cream?”
“I’ve secured Clint, we’re currently heading to higher ground. This dickhead figured he can run with a twisted ankle – stop wiggling! The twins are still pinned and none of us can get to them. Thor’s unconscious, Vision’s with him. Give us a hand?”
Tony fake-gasped and slapped Steve’s arm repeatedly. “It’s too late! Quick, Steve grab her and run!”
The drumstick went on a plate, and it was out of Steve’s hands how they were all going to fight over who wants what. He kept going, piling up slices of almost-evenly-carved meat on a large platter. He was about to sit back down when he remembered. He picked the fork up again and poked through the skin on the remaining breast, then pulled slightly.
Natasha leaned in to look the man in the eyes. “Remember that bit in the second Harry Potter book? His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad…”
“Captain Fucking Testy,” Clint mutters, but Tony spent months figuring out the best optimisation for their earpieces. “You’d think you’d be more relaxed,” the man repeats Bucky’s earlier words. On the feed Tony gets, he sees the archer rain down arrows on the bot Steve’s fighting. They fry its circuits when they go off after two short beeps.
Bruce was kind enough to buy them hot chocolate. Steve carried the tree to a side alley where they would hopefully not attract that much attention. They ran through all the places they still had to go to and made a battle plan. Steve was starting to get excited again.
Steve was torn between a sigh, an eyeroll, and a heart flutter at the other man’s antics. So he settled for all of them. “So they brought in a new one for us. And it doesn’t work, excellent.”
