There was no way Stark Industries could create something this complex and innovative—if one could use such a word for something so…
"Dad's gonna be fine, little guy," Steve said firmly. He placed a hand on his son's shoulder, giving what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze. "He says it's just a simple chest cold, but—"
Steve's heart was in his throat as he stared into the grizzled colonel's eyes, finding nothing to indicate any deception on his part.
“Mmm,” Tony mumbles as he sits down at the kitchen table, kneading his temples with his fingertips.  Thanks to Peter’s swimming tryout, he missed his mid-afternoon coffee break, and is already starting to feel the effects from the lack of caffeine.  Peter would tell him that his burgeoning headache means that he’s drinking too much of the stuff, which is probably true, given that Rhodey always says he drinks enough for an entire army.
"Sure thing, buddy," answered Tony. He shot Steve one more furtive glance, delighting in the sly wink that Steve shot right back at him as he gave Peter's life jacket a quick once-over.
"Your Highness, we believe that we may have some information regarding the recent phenomenon that might help to shed some more light on its possible origin," he began. "However, in order to corroborate this information, there are a few questions that we would greatly appreciate answers to, if you don't mind."
"Daddy, what're they gonna do to him?" Peter cried into his father's chest. "Oh God, they're gonna hurt him, aren't they? They're gonna hurt my Papa?"
“You guys, Obie got arrested!” Peter exclaimed, lifting his head.  “Ned saw it on one of his news apps!  You did it!”
And while Steve didn't exactly subscribe to the same Catholic teachings that his ma had held so dear during her lifetime, somehow he knew that both she and his papa would be smiling down at him while he led his team—his
Tony rolled his eyes as he made his way to the living room, finding Clint and Pietro's faces already on the monitor just as Steve came in from the back, where he'd been busy stacking firewood to save for their next visit.
"I don't know, Peter," Gwen said with a sigh. She tightened the strap of her backpack, her green eyes troubled. "I'm just… trying to keep my options open at the moment. It's nothing personal—"
"Okay, then how about this?" Steve said. "How about after Christmas, you, me, and Peter take the jet out to Ireland for New Year's. We've all been working our asses off since the school year started, and I think we could use a break."
"You know, one would think that it should be me doing the, 'are you all right?' asking, since you're the one down here trying to bust up your knuckles. Again." There was no malice in Tony's voice though, only a thick edge of concern as he carefully unwound the wrap from Steve's hand and tested his fingers.
Some of them were obvious. Justin Hammer had been removed from his post because he had failed to live up to the Air Corps expectations, which Steve could attest to personally. Bruce Banner had apparently died in an accidental lab explosion a few years back, the cause of which was classified beyond Steve's clearance level. He got the same result for Reed Richards, who had also died from some sort of tragic accident that was classified above Steve's clearance level.
It’s definitely something he’ll never get tired of hearing.  And after today, as long as things go Steve’s way, he’ll be hearing it for the next four years too.
"Well, then you definitely could use some. But only after you go and find your engagement ring, okay?"
"'Cept he didn't use his own name," Tony grumbled. "Kid has about a hundred different role-playing names on his Minecraft forums, so he's probably going through those."
"Uh huh." Peter watched as she got into her dad's car, breathing in deeply. He couldn't remember the last time he had been so afraid of an upcoming conversation.
Steve huffed. He really wasn't in the mood to deal with this at the moment. "I thought you guys were able to bypass the battery?"
"Yeah, don't I know it," agreed Steve. He looked fondly over at Peter, who had already begun drafting out a larger version of his airliner design on the blueprint paper.
As the name of the last finalist fades into the cheers of the crowd, the announcer calls, “Ready”, causing Steve’s belly to give a slight swoop.  He should be used to it by now, having heard it hundreds of times over the course of his long swimming career.  But this time it’s just different enough to make his heart start to tick a bit faster.
smile that Tony adored. "Maybe. But what I was going to say is that Peter helped me become more comfortable with who I really am. Before the serum I couldn't really do much of anything physically so I would just draw all the time, but afterwards I was so eager to shed that whole weak persona of mine that I guess I decided I needed to hide the aspects of my personality that I thought didn't match my new body."
"Would you like anything?" the general asked, gesturing towards a display of various drinks. "Water? Superwater? Whisky?"
"Well, since there appears to be minimal opposition, I think hitting 'em from two sides should be enough," Steve said after a short pause. He pointed to the northwest and southeast corners, both housing occupied guard towers. "You and Sam will hit these towers simultaneously, take out the guards and then move counterclockwise to the next tower until they're all clear while Natasha, Clint, and I stake out the main entrance. Clint will pick off any visible guards, and then we'll move in with you and Sam watching our six. I think Bruce'll be okay to sit this one out. We can always call him in if things get dicey, but from the looks of it, it likely won't."
"Work Allen." Batman tells him. Bruce really wants to get into the Monitor Room and lock himself there.
"Likewise." Bruce told him and he disappeared. Now it wasn't that Clark was nosy but he really wanted to know where Bruce was going to. He checks the data-base and saw the location to New York.
"If you keep trying to change my mind like this I have to say I agree with your methods." Tony told him and they continued to kiss for a while until Steve separated them and made Tony lay down on top of his chest so he could take a nap. It was more for Tony's sake then his own. As he heard his breath even out, Steve couldn't help but wonder how this two weeks would go for him and Tony.
"Right, I want to see how the bat is doing." Tony said. Before he gets the chance to put in the call though the alarms goes off.
“Where am I going?” Bruce asked looking at the paper and noticing that it was a ticket it read: Hailey’s Circus.
"Okay." Tony said and looked at the ring for once, it was gold with three stones slanted, it was a ruby a blue diamond and a diamond in a row, it was beautiful. Steve slipped it in slowly and Tony couldn't help the silly smile that came to his face.
"For being you, Bruce." Clark answered and Bruce looked at him and rolls his eyes at the cheesiness but Clark doesn't miss the smile on his face.
As far as he was concern he had done nothing wrong and Clark was in the wrong here. He had not told Tony about his or anyone else's secret identities heck he didn't even tell Tony about his own the man had guessed.
“Tell me you didn’t become a Captain Sandwich because I will not forgive you,” Tony told him back, he broke some of the wood and went up the stairs to see Steve standing there with the shield over him and in his other arm he was holding a small.
"Yes, thanks for asking for asking and having Alfred welcome us." Tony told him. Bruce just nodded and looked at Tony.
"Okay, I'll tell Alfred to let me borrow one of your suits." Superman told him, he wants to ask what Bruce is doing in New York but he knows that if he asks it would get him a lecture in the worst way possible.
"Then we understand each other, I still can't believe you thought Bruce and I were dating." Tony said with a laugh. "You don't think much do you?"
It had been close to two months and both Clark and Steve couldn't find the right time to propose. Well a few right times had come but they had been interrupted by meetings, fighting crime, the jobs, charity everything had been stopping them from asking either Bruce or Tony. It was also getting a bit on their nerves.
Their second meeting was not a kind one. It was during the funeral of Thomas and Martha Wayne and Tony pretended he didn't want to go. But he did, mostly because Thomas had treated him incredibly nicely when they met. To Tony it just seemed weird to be in Gotham for the funeral it was raining as if mourning the loss as well but then he thought that the rain was normal for Gotham. He saw all of the people go to the little boy standing there and Tony could tell he was trying not to break down. He knew most of the people here, even his Dad in a way were just there for the publicity. Tony walked over to the little boy and the butler and stood next to him, before grabbing his hand and saying nothing at all. Before he left, he just heard one word.
“Hi,” He said before covering his face again. Bruce opens his arms and Clark switches Richard over to him.
"Yes." Bruce told him and Clark pulled him close and kissed him. They pulled apart and Clark took the ring out, it wasn't too showy it was two-tone stainless steel with an old black ion-plated center, in the middle was a small row of diamonds. Clark put it in Bruce's ring finger and they kissed again.
JARVIS, had no other choice by the next day than to call the only person he knew of that could break into the lab and help his charge. He made the call.
"I doubt the man would go without fight Tony." Steve told him with a smile on his face as he was sitting down in the couch.
"Thank-you." Steve said. Alfred showed him were the library was and Steve went back up to the room to get his sketch pad and everything he would need to relax for a bit.
He sat down in the chair and looked around the room before he began to sketch, what he had seen around Gotham. He had made research and knew that there was darkness in Gotham, but there was an old beauty to it. He was lost in his sketching that he did not notice when someone sneaked inside the room.
"You missed my twenty-first birthday because of your ninja-freaky-training, so as payment as my BFF for the entire time we are alive, for our bachelors party we are going to Vegas."
"I want to get back to the Tower." He tells her. Pepper smiles she had guessed immediately what happened and couldn't be happier for Tony.
“We are going to have to take him,” Gordon said moving toward the boy, but he seemed to be wrapping even closer.
"Yup, I'm going to get out soon I feel so much better." Tony tells him, he has scratches in his face and Bruce can tell some bruise ribs.
So one day, Tony and Pepper are in his room and they are both incredibly quiet and no one is in the Tower thankfully. They both knew it was going to happen. But it surprised them both.
"Right I'll bring him something." Steve said and left. Bruce narrowed his eyes there was something he was getting, that he still didn't process. He closed the door to get to Tony and see if the man hadn't drowned in the shower.
They all turned to the next couple even as people could be seen wiping their eyes and they didn't know what to expect of the next couple.
"Don't get used to it I had to leave the Boy Scout in charge of Gotham and I'm going back on patrol tonight." Bruce tells him.
"You are mine, just as I am yours." Steve said. "You know if I can spend my life like this with you, I would be happy-Steve didn't know how in the world he was doing it but he bent down on his knee right there next to Tony and smiled as he held his hand- Tony I love you, would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?" He asked taking the ring out. Tony looked at Steve, this was not what he was expecting at all but at the same time he was worried Steve would try to take it all back.
“I actually came to let you know that we couldn’t find any other family members for Peter,” Phil told them.
He arrived back to the Bat-cave and Alfred was standing there. He is serious but knows something is wrong by the way Bruce is standing.
"I won't tell you anything you've already heard Tony." He tells him and Tony lowers all of his walls and crumbles into the ground to cry his eyes out even if Bruce is seeing him. Bruce doesn't really care, he wanted to be there with his friend even in dark time, because he lives in this pain every day and hopes his friend doesn't have to. That night they stayed together something that wasn't very different for them; they had done so many times before.
Bruce had just arrived from battle in Gotham and he was checking the monitor, because he kicked everyone out. Though really Flash should have acted like he was angry that he wasn't going to do monitor duty today instead of whooping and acting like it was Christmas Morning. Batman was looking at the screens looking for trouble.
"You would think so." Superman told him. Batman smirked at him which Superman could tell which ones were smiles now.
"Batman, some villains have broken out of Gotham, Scarecrow, Bane and the Joker." J'onn informed him. Superman smirked.
"You know I would just be worried that you will be meeting Tony's fake family. Wayne is going to put you through the coals Cap." Clint said getting hit in the stomach by Natasha. "Ouch, what?"
“Welcome and see the sights of the Flying Grayson’s!” he said. Bruce was looking at the Acrobats and he had to smile looking at them. He noticed that someone else was up there too, but he saw that it was a child.
"I'm going to see if the Cap wants to dance with me." Tony said moved toward Steve that got entertained with someone.
"I will tell you, you are wonderful so many times until you believe it." Steve tells him and kisses him again. Before Steve can ask, what he wants to ask, the alarm goes off.
"Bruce, I care about you all of you." Clark said. "I mean I know I'm a farm boy and well you're not and I really can't explain but I want to spend my life with you not matter what we go through or all the evil villains, aliens we have to fight against with. Bruce will you do me the honor of becoming my husband." Clark said and Bruce looked at him.
“Dammit Kielar! Do not sneak up on me like that!” She yelled at him. “Why the hell would I check Germany?”
“Sshh. it’s how I think.” Dakota said, turning back to the computer with a smile. It was the small things right now, they would fix this as long as they could all come together.
“I don’t think it would have mattered. We didn’t know the attack was coming. It was out of everyone’s control. We can’t place blame on the people who are helping us. We..”
“This will be our last vlog for at least a month, we are preparing for a big move.” Mara added, her voice the same as Francis’. “We will be expanding our adventures.”
Kielar and Tommy going out into the city as Captain America and Iron-Man had become a staple in their lives. As much as they had tried to keep Tommy out of the life they had chosen, Steve and Tony didn’t deny their son the chance to step into the role he wanted to be in, but made sure he was ready. Having Kielar out there, well trained and sure of himself, had added to the idea.
“You know it won’t be all fun and games right? We will be there to train and work with the others.” Clint told him.
“The meeting with the Avengers.” Azari said. “Ring a bell you nosy little girl.” The Cajun girl leaned back in her chair and laughed. “So. your intel was correct.” He told her. Even though Azari could not see her eyes behind the glasses she wore her entire face just lit up. “And you were specifically mentioned. I defended you again the blonde boy”
“No, I need another sandwich and some more running shoes. I can’t just stay back and hide while people are getting hurt. I’ve watched the news, and Johnny tried to hide it from us, but Steve and Tony said that it was important that I know what is going on in the world. And I know, I’ve known since that asshole entered the most powerful position in the nation, and I know that people want me to stay here. I can’t though, not when people need my help, and they do. I can’t just sit around and wait, I need to do something. So I’m going to make like five more sandwiches and then go for a run okay?” Kielar insisted, not back down.
“He’s not stopping, both Dakota and Kielar are on the computers trying to locate them and the West Coast Avengers, which also include Tommy Stark. Kielar brought in three survivors from Xavier’s, A Drake, Worthington and Wisdom. Scott Summers arrived with Kitty Pryde and a number of kids. Ororo had the second jet with a few others on it and they went to an Australia compound. I think the plan is to have John, Hayden and Kane take over for the adults with them so they can regroup with us. Bobby Drake was confirmed dead. It’s a lot for everyone to take in so we’re going to have to have someone who is able to convey things like this well, to do so when we get back.”
“I was sleeping and then Kielar just appeared in the room. He didn’t come in through the door and I only heard him because he ran into my dresser. He just started yelling about Karla. He doesn’t really do that you know? He and Karla have a rough relationship, but he sounded terrified.”
Mara reached out with her foot and knocked Francis in the head lightly with her boot, causing him to jerk awake and look around. “We heading home dad?” he asked rubbing his eyes.
“I..” Kielar started. Johnny looked over at his son. “I did what I could. I went to Xavier’s as soon as I was able to, I..I realy tried.”
“We needed to speak first Bruce” Tony said from him to sit. “As you know, S.H.I.E.L.D has instructed that a new team be trained as a replacement for the Avengers. Most of us are no longer active and it has been shown that heroes are necessary. They bring a sort of hope to people.” Tony dropped a file onto the table labeled 'The Legacy Initiative'.
“My sister had her wings removed, she’s recoverin’ but very slowly.” Aislin told him. “The triplets are inside, I’ll let ‘em know ya’ll are here.” She said, “Akhiro? Thank ya for coming to get us.”
The message ended, and the four stood there in shock. “That sounded like an attack on the Xavier school.” Francis said, taking water from James and drinking it. “Dad is on a mission, but I can call mom and see what she knows.” For Francis Barton to offer calling his mother, Bobbi Morse, was a big deal. The two of them were not on the greatest terms after the divorce that took place during his early teen years. If Clint Barton had been an option, he would have taken that. “We will figure out what happened Kitten, we can get you and Mara safe.”
“Ah’ve been ready for a while now. Let’s shut dim down.” She said, her red eyes glowing in the darkness. “They’ll get da message when we’re finished.”
“And we will be returning to Wakanda.” T’Challa approached. “There are not enough resources for those who are here. It would be wise to have some return with us. We can train those who would like to, and allow those who need it to just have a safe place to be. We will remain for the night, as we have contacted Stephen Strange to help with the transport.”
“Because ya a leader. Meh friends told me about some of the stuff ya said in the meeting dat was held. Ah get da feeling people would follow ya.”
It wasn’t an ideal situation, and Mara wasn’t one hundred percent on board with the whole thing. One thing she knew though was that her brother and Francis were currently good with it, and right now, that was good enough for her. With all the adults there, Mara doubted that anyone else would try anything, it was still unnerving to the girl in a way that she wouldn’t be able to verbally express. Something bothered her about the whole idea, and she couldn’t pinpoint it, at least not yet.
“Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are a menace to this country! They would rather protect a mutant than protect us!”
The next morning the large group sat in the airport with their bags, not a single one of them looked remotely happy. Steve looked around the large area and shook his head. “So, how much longer until you tell them that we have a private plane Tony.” he asked his husband.
“So moving on from Tommy putting pot into cookies,” Dakota said. “Why can’t we just train here? You already have a facility and we are already here.”
The three other teenagers stood silently, unaware of what happened at the other locations until that moment. Vivienne’s eyes widened as the footage played for them and Renee’s shoulder slumped, as the feeling of defeat washed over her. Jett quickly looked away, crossing his arms over his chest as he shook his head. “So, what do we do?” he asked.
“It is, she’s using Gambits abilities.” Bucky informed her. “That means she is the reason the estate exploded. We have the solders going in, being dragged out by Rogue, and then the cameras going out, but nobody else?”
As she made it closer to the cabin she saw her son in the hammock closest to their temporary home. She shook her head at the sight, knowing that he was dealing with everything he felt on his own, it was how she handled things, and avoiding family was the number one way to do that. Laura had briefly spoken to him in one of the stolen cars they had used to get across the midwest while his sister slept in the back. He blamed himself for a lot of the things that happened at the farm, the people he couldn’t save, and it broke her heart to hear her sixteen year old son tell her that he would have switched places with any of them if he could.
Laura went to respond when Kestrel poked her head out the door. “Hey Mama, we turned the shortwave radio on and we got a message from a LeBeau. They’re looking for safety. The name sounded familiar…” Laura immediately dropped the wood she was carrying and ran inside.
That is the end! This was amazing to do and I can';t wait to continue with the next set of characters. I hope everyone enjoyed it!
“Some of us have actual things to do..oh my god” Tommy mocked Dakota, then he was smacked upside the head. “Hey, that isn’t nice. There is a no hitting rule in this house.” he declared.
“Azari!” She smiled and hugged him. “It’s so good t’ see y’ again.” Azari had forgotten how thick the girls accent was. Desiree LeBeau was someone who had become a constant fixture in Azari’s life when they were younger. His mother was her godmother, and Ororo held Desiree’s father very close to her heart, so even though they were not blood, they were family. “I thought I saw y’ out there but I wasn’ so sure.”
“Well, you boys are older now. I retired to help raise you. Going on on all those missions and missing everything, I couldn’t do it anymore.”
“They didn’t. This place was a very well kept secret from a lot of people, including those at the Xavier Institute. Relations between the Avengers and X-men have been rocky at times, but Tony, Mr. Stark wanted to make sure there was always a safe place for Kielar. In turn it became a safe haven for other super powered beings on the new Avengers team. That being said, they were never going to turn away people, as long as there is room. “
“We got everyone.” James assured her as they started moving toward the location of the jet. The sirens in the city were in all directions and getting louder as they grew closer. As the two entered the jet, Desiree moved to the front. “Lift the ramp and take off, keep the door open, Hades I need you to finish off the trucks, we don’t need them repairing them, the less they have the better.”
“Go ahead and take Vivienne first, I’ll wait here with Renee and we can grab some snacks from the cabinet so that you can eat something. When you get back go ahead and take Renee, I’ll go last” Jett directed them.
“I didn’t call you because I wanted you to pick me up, I am staying with Mara and Azari. I will not come to S.H.I.E.LD.” Francis suddenly snapped, catching the trio's attention. “No mom, I just want to know what the hell is going on.” There was silence for a moment,  Francis went pale. “Our training facility was raided? No, we weren’t there, we’ve been out. It was our, but New York. Okay. Yeah. Yeah I’ll make sure we stay off the radar…”
“You need to figure out as much information as possible before Rebel gets here. We need to give her as much as we can.” Bucky said from the doorway. “I just got a call from Daken, they are making the stop to remove the collars and will be here in two hours or less.”
“Yep.” Francis answered simply. “I think New York has had enough of me for awhile. Cali will be a good change of pace.”
An hour passed, the soldier's had cleared out or been taken down, but there was silence throughout the school. As they reached the kitchen Vivienne froze midstep. “Someone is here. I feel their mind, but it’s too fast for me to read.” she said before a gush of wind hit the three of them. A boy their age stood on the other side of the room with windblown silver hair. He looked liked he had been woken up from a deep sleep, wearing just sweatpants and a muscle shirt. “Who are you.” she asked. He remained silent as he watched the three of them carefully. Renee’s hand slowly iced up, ready to fight if needed, and the Shadows behind Jett surrounded the stranger.
“Didn’t they say to keep him there.” the voice answered from the other side. “You had one damn job.”
“Almos’....jus’ a few more trucks.” She told him turning back around, only for him to grab her wrist. “Ookami.”
Vivienne Worthington and Jett Wisdom had known each other since they were children. Their training had begun at around the same time and they were familiar with how the other moved. Vivienne knew that Jett never hesitated to move through the shadows, but he did when he created creatures from them, because once the creature swallowed someone, that person would no longer be alive. Jett knew his friend used her telepathy with ease, but flying was something she opted to avoid as much as possible. Their hand to hand combat styles were similar, having the same teachers, but often rotating out. They had been sparring partners since they were twelve.
“You are the one who gave them access to the lab, Tony,” Steve laughed. “It’s not my fault they challenge your intelligence.”
“I would say something but I think this situation calls for the use of that language.” Steve said behind him. “You have to make that phone call though, and you know you do.”
“But you don’t know why she won’t wake up. You don't know what they actually did? Has anyone been able to contact Reed or any of them at the Baxter building?” Kielar questioned, rambling again.
“And they arrested me because our step-dad is a politician and happened to know somebody on the inside. I found out I was supposed to be released a month after my arrest, and instead they added twenty-three more months and gave me no outside contact with the world.” Blaine admitted.
“Jett!” a voice suddenly called to him, and as he turned he saw another girl and sighed with relief. Around her were several soldiers on the ground. “We’ve been looking for you. We need to go this way. Your mom is taking everyone straight down to the Blackbird.
“I’m going to go grab Tommy, and Kielar too since he’s looking at the menu.” Steve said. “How is it the Banners are the only ones not making a scene?”
The Stark's, Rogers and Romanov's sit down to figure out what they are going to do. More history on their relationship with Kielar Storm.
“TJ tell us exactly what happened before we came in here.” Tony said, turning his attention to his son.
A series of confirmations followed the orders, before the communicators fell silent on all sides. Ookami turned to a man, and a youthful woman who stood further back. “Let’s move.” The man told Ookami, who responded with a nod. “We follow the truck. The only mutant in that building would have been Karla Storm, the daughter of Johnny Storm. Many others are in original locations shown before the raid.” he paused and watched his two companions. “The convoy will have hostiles, we will have to go in with full force.”
“Yeah I mean, we don’t hear it from all of you. Though most of the gossip revolves around the X-Men. I never knew there could be so many love triangles in one building. I mean, why not though? Did you know that a few years ago one student got kicked out for punching Scott Summers in the face? I’m kind of glad I don’t go to that school.”
“You and James stay here, I’ll be fine, my mom is there and she won’t let anything happen to me.” Francis said, “I need to do this though. I’ve sat here and heard exactly what the government is doing and it needs to stop. Someone needs to step in before it goes any further, and S.H.I.E.L.D has a voice that has been heard in the past. They need to help.”
“Actually,” Vivienne started. “Ms. Pryde gave Jett a communicator. “ As the words left her mouth Jett appeared next to them before he ran to the nearest trash can. “Still gets motion sickness I see.”
“My sister and I were adopted by Johnny Storm, but Pietro Maximoff is our birth father, and somehow they knew that. I was only able to get out because my sister warned me. They took her from the Baxter building and they came for me at Starks. I didn’t know what I would find here, I didn’t think they would be stupid enough to raid an entire school of mutants.” Kielar admitted. “Is it just the three of you?”
The two drove in silence before Clint’s phone started ringing. ‘Phone Call from Bobbi Morse’ the car announced. The two Barton’s looked at each other and then back at the phone, before Francis reached forward and hit the ignore button.
“”Mohawk. You see these?” Laura asked, pointing to her little stud earrings. “They’re trackers, very private and Akihiro asked me to wear them in case of emergency, he only activates them when necessary.”
“Mama said she’s seen trucks headin’ dis way.” Luc informed them as they moved through the room. “We’re headin’ down now, lets go.” He continued to the basement door pulling Sebastian along with him. Remy zipped up a back and threw it over his shoulder before giving the other two men a nod.
“Mate, oy am no doctor, we made her comfortable for the ride and we are gonna get her to Elixir.” The boy explained. “But ya information should be good for him and whoever else is takin’ care of her. She’s alive, Jimmy said her vitals are doin’ okay.”
“You don’t wear socks with your high water pants and loafers. On top of that you wear button ups and bow ties.”
Francis fell silent for a moment. “Xavier’s, the Baxter Building, and Stark Tower, were raided. The Fantastic Four are all accounted for, but Karla Storm is missing. Steve and Tony were arrested for not giving them Kielar Storm, and then Tommy apparently took a suit and disappeared off radar. They have a warrant for his arrest. Natasha hasn’t been heard from and nobody has heard from my dad.”
“Desiree, her name is Desiree. Let’s go.” Kielar said and took off with Tommy, Desiree followed them. As they ran down the corridor towards the hangar, James Rogers met up with them, “Are they really here?” Kielar asked him.
“Yes mom, we had a meeting earlier. Everyone has gone back home or is in their room packing.” Dakota said as she sat in front of her computer, video chatting with her mother. She hadn’t waited a bit before making the call, wanting to take care of some of the packing before she got caught up in the video chat.
Almost five songs later, James was still on the dance floor with his partners and sister. It had always been hard for him to refuse them, and it showed tonight. As the current song ended and another started, James saw a flashing from Azari’s communicator. “Azari!” he yelled and pointed to it. A few moments later, the four of them were off the dance floor and stepped outside. “Who is it from?”
“Do not let Bobbi find out about this. She will never let me hear the end of it. Luckily Francis is over 18 now so it's not like she can do anything.” Clint said as he ran his hand through his hair. “Francis has never been a team player so this may be good for him. He usually works with me or solo.”
“I will try my Dad and Tony.” James offered. “Azari, you should try to contact your dad, we should do what your mom said and get you out of here. You have diplomatic immunity, but whether they will acknowledge it, we need to make sure you are safe.” James pressed his contact for Steve, only for it to be cut off, then repeated the step for Tony, he received the same. “This hasn’t happened before.”
“But that is for Kielar to decide, not us Dakota. If we take those choices away from him, it may do more harm than good. I agree that Karla should not be a candidate, however, she is and that means we just have to be there for Kielar.”
“Nobody was there when they raided. Devon, Blaine, Ryan and Nicole must have gone out after we left.” Francis sighed. “Um, dad has a place we can probably lie low at. It's under an alias and he said I could use it anytime, so I guess now is the time.”
“I hope you aren’t talking about about your vlog you do by going places that could get you arrested.” Natasha spoke up for the first time since entering the room.
“So, who was it?” Karla asked, trying to get the gossip. “Was it someone I know, oh was it Bobby Drake? That would be a weird fire and Ice thing though, huh?”
“Kielar Maximoff, that means he’s related to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, that explains the speed, if I remember some of the history we were taught, Quicksilver has a daughter with a member of the  Inhuman Royalty and Scarlet Witch has two sons that are reincarnated from herself and Vision?” Renee commented as she grabbed some food from the pantry.
“Do not be so smug young sir, the device has been there almost a year and I do not believe you have gathered any evidence against your brother.”
“I’m going with you as backup.” Bucky said. “Besides with those kids leaving for S.H.I.E.L.D you can’t take the larger jet in case of an emergency. “I have the smaller Quinjet, we can take that. It can hold seven or eight people.”
“You’re telling me.” Jade said, crossing her arms. “Why did the X-men not know this place existed? I’m going to get answers. So many people could have been saved.”
“He’s cute.”  Azari laughed. “Needs more of a filter, but it suits him.” Mara stared at Azari and then smile. “Yes?” he asked.
“I don’t know what the rules are around that school of yours but around here you will shut your god damn mouth” Daken growled. “Spreading that shit will do more harm than good.”
“If you do I will be sure to discuss with you your feelings about that Howlett boy.” Azari threatened as he turned to the next page which had been the boy who had been asleep for half the meeting.
“Well said Johnny.” Reed told his team mate. “I know it's hard right now, and being in this room isn’t easy. You don't know each other personally. A file will only go so far, if we want to fight this, we need to coordinate with each other and work together. Every single one of you has had training, all of you know what needs to be done. Before we do anything, we need a plan.”
“Oh.” Eliza turned red in her cheeks. “It just sort of happened.” she said, making Nicole's order and handing it to her. “Maybe last week?”
“You follow me.” Dakota told them and led them into the building. “All phones will need to be placed there until we can have them checked, and you will need to walk through this scanner.” She instructed them. As they did, none of the machines went off and they continued inside. As they passed through two large doors and entered a large recreational area, Dakota turned back to them. “Welcome to the Legacy Compound.”
“More like if he stayed away from that Stark boy he wouldn’t be influenced to quit.” Johnny spoke up from the kitchen. “The kid is bad news and he will only bring Kielar down.”
As the four sat and ate their ice cream several customers came in and out as it neared closing time. As the last ones left, several pings went off in the back room, making Eliza rush back. When she returned, her face was pale, and she looked terrified. “Blaine. You guys have to go. Something has happened and it isn’t safe.”
They both don't realize that these two men that annoy them are the ones that are going to change their lives.
"Hey Cap, guess what I'm getting home tomorrow." Tony told him. "I finally finished the business with Lex Corp, which really if Loki got any ego he would try to get his hands in that building it would do great for his ego and be out of our hair." Tony told Steve.
“Hey kid, you doubt my sight,” Tony said with a smile. It had been two months and SHIELD had been trying to find another family that were related to Peter. It seemed they were not having luck and to the surprise of many both Steve and Tony had been taking care of Peter for everything. They had also been speaking behind the scenes and SHIELD did not know.
"I think it would be preferable for Master Anthony not to be near any of this." he says and he doesn't look back as he gets in the car with the two boys. They arrive to his house and Tony gets the only thing he can do and gets the bottle but before he can do anything Bruce takes it away from him.
"Steve I'm all charmed, you know you don't have to tell me pretty things I already love you." Tony tells him. Steve moves and kisses Tony.
"Again, yes it is." Tony tells him and pulls him down for a kiss. Steve receives it with a smile and happiness.
"Don't be ridiculous Clark." Bruce told him and Clark had to smile there had been two incidents in which he died, when he got sent to the horrible future and Doomsday. He had no intentions of it either.
"Bruce, did Barry talk to you?" He grits his teeth. Could Clark call him Batman was that too hard someone could hear him.
A year later Tony is kidnapped and Bruce is going insane but knows he can't interfere either. But he is putting the Bat-cave satellites in Afghanistan and trying to find Tony. Nobody in the place questions him. When they finally find him and it's Rhodes that brings him down, Bruce calls Tony immediately.
The last two months Bruce had spent his time taking down a gang that wouldn't leave Gotham alone. He had finally finished taking them down a week ago and he was currently in the Watchtower. He and Superman had not been having the best of relationships mainly because Clark was mad that he had broken his ribs a month ago and had still gone after the gang and not asked for help from the League or what Bruce knew he hadn't asked the Boy Scout for help.
"What do you mean Bruce disappeared?" Tony asks and he is a little drunk but that sobers him up instantly.
"Nightmares?" Tony just looked at him and that meant he got it in one. So it was time for Bruce's tough love. "Alright time to clean up Tony, easy or hard?" he asked. Tony ignored him. Bruce grabbed the other bottle that Tony had gotten into his hand and threw it to the trash and Tony tried to give him a heated glare. Bruce grabbed him by the hand and put him over his shoulder.
The party was roaring with all the guests around moving toward both of the couples that were standing together.
In Wayne Manor, Alfred was making breakfast for both Master Bruce and Master Clark. It was something he had been waiting for, for a long time and no it didn't seem weird to him. Alfred was just happy to see his charge happy-even if the man will deny it.
"My aren't you in a terrible mood, what did your sheep run away?" Lois taunts. But Clark doesn't pay attention as the private plane arrives. The first one to come out is Pepper Potts. The second one is Tony and he is flashy playing for the camera as if he owns it.
"We're in bed." Steve told him than blush when Tony giggle his eyebrows. "So Batman and Superman, you don't find it weird at all?"
He could hear the gasps and he looked back up, he could see the wires and it seemed like it was a small motion as the wires broke and the two of them fell down, but Bruce wasn’t hearing that all he heard was a loud,
"Why would I break something?" Flash told him. Batman gave him a blank stare. "Okay stop looking at me like that I kind of broke the DVD player don't kill me please." The please was really emphasize.
"I think six hours will be fine, I told Alfred to cancel your meetings for today." Clark told him and Bruce looked at him.
Steve arrives at the Mansion after going to an arts store all day to get supplies. It still surprised him, everything he could buy in the place. After he put his things in his floor, he decided to go to the common area so he could make dinner for everyone. When the elevator opens Pepper was standing there and she had tears in her eyes. But his eyes also went to the luggage that she had on her. He knew that was more than what she took on trips.
"Wooo-hooo, Hi Batsy my oldest bestest friend in the world." Tony said with a huge smile on his face that it surprised Bruce because the last time he smile like that was when he told Bruce about the Avengers moving into the Tower.
"I missed you; you know I didn't have a super soldier bossing me around." Tony said with a smile. Steve smiled at that.
"I care about him." Tony told him and Steve's shoulders deflated. "As a brother I guess…" he didn't get to finish because a pair of lips were on his own. Tony froze a bit and he was only thinking that Steve was kissing him.
“You also have a commitment, which I guess will be good.” Alfred said with a smile and giving him the paper.
In Avengers Tower they had the TV on because Steve wanted to know if Tony would arrive alright in Gotham.
This time it had almost seemed as though his two separate timelines, pre-ice and post-ice, had somehow become merged together into one semi-coherent series of events, something that Steve was absolutely certain he had no desire to ever experience. He had flown the
The cocky smirk finally dropped from Howard's face as he regarded Steve, his eyes following the line of Steve's arm down to his and Tony's clasped hands.
As soon as the screen went blank Tony pressed his palm to his chest, where Steve's dog tags rested against his heart. Steve had given him the dog tags before he and Nat left on the mission that ended up snowballing into Project Insight, telling him that they symbolised a departing soldier's desire to be reunited with his sweetheart.
"T-Tony!" Steve rasped, groaning as a fresh wave of dizziness slammed right into his chest. It was a good thing his stomach was empty, or James would probably be wearing its contents already. "Is he—is he—?"
"Ahh," Steve stammered, breathing in deeply through his nose. "Someone showed up here, right before I was set to go out on my run, and… well…"
Based on the calculations that he'd completed when he first discovered the prison, Peter knew he had only about forty-five seconds before another suit was due to zoom by. He quickly got to his feet, and was still brushing sand from his chest and arms when he froze, the all-too-familiar ice bolt racing down his spine.
"Very good, sir," said JARVIS. "And may I presume that I am to use the definition of mortal danger that you and Captain Rogers have established, rather than Master Peter's?"
"We can talk more about that once we get back from our trip, okay buddy?" Dad said. "It's only a couple more weeks."
"I know, mo grá, I know," Steve said, low and thick. He tucked Tony close again, his fingers gliding up his back to thread into his hair. "And I hate leaving you too, you know I do. But Fury's right. If that space phenomenon does turn out to be something important, then having the Wakandans as allies could be a pretty big help."
"Just some new web shooters. Pete made a couple tweaks to the design, so… JARVIS has 'em going up at the Compound already."
"Ah, and you're just as much of a flatterer as your papa," she said as Steve released her. She stepped back, her steel-blue eyes looking Tony up and down before offering her hand, her knuckles swollen and slightly bent with arthritis.
And there was that damn dimple again, sending a shock of warmth blooming across Tony's chest. At this rate, there was no way Tony was going to even make it through dinner.
Sam pursed his lips, glancing towards the ceiling and walls of the prison as he weighed all of the possibilities. The bunker they were trapped in was much larger than the bunker had been down in Miami and also much more wide open, which was actually a disadvantage for the Avengers since only three of the team members could fly.
"It's—it's—" Tony started, almost unable to believe his eyes as the numbers kept on scrolling. "Uhh…"
"Yeah, yeah, I know." Tony swiped at his leaky eyes, sniffing. "Honey, I know you don't really wanna talk about this, but we need—we need to tell Pete something. Sam told me that he's starting to get pretty upset, and I don't—he was already starting to look bad before you left, and I—"
Steve shot him a wicked grin as he tightened his grip, leaning over to whisper, "Do you want my hands or my mouth, sweetheart?"
"Uh huh," Peter whispered, grateful when he didn't sway on his feet as Dad released him. His throat was still burning and it was getting harder and harder to keep his vision from slipping into its honeycomb-like state, but if it meant getting off of Titan in one piece, he would do whatever it took.
"Are your glasses okay?" Rogers asked, his expression hovering between a grimace and something that Tony couldn't quite identify. He slid the glasses onto his face, sneaking a quick but admiring glance at Rogers' broad shoulders before forcibly averting his gaze.
He had to admit that it was addictive, being desired that much. And the fact that it was Steve Rogers, a person who Tony had always said that he hated but now couldn't imagine trying to live without, somehow made it all that much more erotic.
He brushed his teeth, running his wet fingers through his hair afterwards in a pretty much futile attempt to get his hair to cooperate. After a dismissive shrug at his reflection Peter opened the door, allowing Ms Sharon to take his elbow to help him back to bed.
"Yeah, okay," muttered Tony, flinching as Image Peter let out a brief but piercing scream, biting down so hard on his bottom lip that he drew blood.
"Well…" Steve knew that Tony had likely already noticed that his senses were a bit stronger than the average person, and he also knew that Tony had a right to know that his father's work had been used without his permission or authorisation. And since Tony had said no more secrets between them, Steve believed that the time had come for him to know.
And for Tony, whose stomach currently felt like a giant ball of lead, it only served to strengthen his resolve.
Steve scoffed. "No, but Hitler was insane, so I'm not surprised. Now, President Cole on the other hand… he seems way too smooth and charming to be insane, but I suppose you never know."
"I didn't," Ned replied. "Mom didn't know, only that she's the daughter of a new deputy police chief."
He’s so unbelievably sexy that Steve has to stop and compose himself before he opens the door, hoping his complete lack of a poker face doesn’t give him away.
"Tony!" he said, his blue eyes clouded with fear and pain as they studied Tony's face. "Are you—you're still real?"
Pulling out of the crevasse, Joseph grinned as he guided the aircraft back up, preparing to complete his turn around the mountain when he caught sight of something odd out of the corner of his eye.
—Tony picked up his stack of diagrams and notes and was just about to exit the lab when JARVIS spoke up again.
A huge thank-you to my awesome friends on the IronDad and SpiderSon Fic Recs discord for their input into this chapter!  You guys are amazing! 💖
Getting to his feet, Steve grabbed his worn brown leather jacket and slung it over his shoulder, checking his timepiece on his way out of the pub. It was only 1600, and since he'd already completed his aircraft double-check and filed his mission report for the day, that meant he had plenty of time to make one of his hospital visits before he returned to the barracks for dinner.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💖
“Merci, Steve!” Jacques says as he shakes Steve’s hand, giving him a friendly smile.  “Congratulations to you on a great victory!”
"Um, maybe tomorrow, kiddo," Bucky answered. "I'm supposed to meet with Сэм once he and Стив get back."
“Which is why we need to finish the grant,” Steve says.  “I’d like to send it on to Nike by this afternoon, is that enough time?”
And then, once the Project Phoenix satellites were all deployed and JARVIS was able to link them up with the tesseract, well… from Peter's perspective, everything would be fine.
“There’s no way Agent Danvers and I would be here if we didn't think it would stick,” answered Fury.  He dug his phone from his back pocket, chuckling as he read a message.  “And it looks like my buddies over in the JAG Corps just picked up General West.  I’d say so far this case is falling into place pretty well.”
"But… Steve," Tony whimpered. "How many times does my boy have to get hurt before I figure this out?"
"Exactly." Tony opened his arms, letting out a slight shudder when Peter didn't hesitate to step into them. He buried his fingers into his sweet boy's curls, closing his eyes as the faint scent of green apples filled his nostrils.
"Not sure you can do much else for me at the moment, but I'll keep you updated." Peter had already programmed the chip to send out a Morse Code S.O.S. signal with his current coordinates if his phone happened to get damaged or destroyed, but he was really hoping that he would get the chance to include some info about what kind of opposition the team would be facing once they got there before that.
"Well, this is just a different kind of nuts," Gwen said with a laugh. She reached for Peter's hand. "Are you even still hungry after eating all those chips?"
“Nah, I haven’t grown that much,” Peter mumbles as he shoves aside a pile of loose socks.  He lets out a triumphant “yes!” as his fingers finally close around a piece of rubber in the far back corner of the drawer.
"Good," Steve said as he tugged Tony's face down for a kiss, one that sent warmth spreading across Steve's chest and down his arms and legs by the time they broke apart. "But now, you need food."
"Strange, I'm telling you, we need to get going now!" Tony said, still holding Peter to his chest like he was afraid he might break. "You know Thanos is heading to Earth, he's probably already there! And Steve and the rest of the team need our help!"
"Tony, I'm gonna—I'm gonna—" Steve choked out, his breath hitching as Tony slid his hand underneath Steve's ass, squeezing it before trailing his fingertips along his crack. "Tony, I'm gonna come!"
Gwen dabbed at her eyes, sniffing. "Oh, I know that. I still begged him not to go, even though deep down I knew that he would anyway." She let out a sort of morbid chuckle, shaking her head. "Peter loved being Spider-Man. He loved being a superhero and training with the Avengers, but he loved you and Mr Stark and the rest of his family more. And—and maybe even me, 'cause he said so right before he left, and—but anyway… That's the real reason why he left the bus. He wasn't trying to be a hero, Captain Rogers. He was just trying to keep the people he loved safe."
The alien scowled as he raised his arms, causing two large hunks of metal to detach from the walls of the ship. "You've saved nothing," he taunted. "Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine."
Tony's eyebrows knitted together into a frown. "Steve, I'm not here to mooch off of you. That's not—"
"Copy that, Danvers," said Steve, just as his X-302 pulled back into the hangar. "Keep a firm hand on the stick as you come through, there's a pretty wicked shimmy at first, but nothing we haven't handled before."
"Holy shit," Tony whispered as he brought his hand to cover Steve's, interlacing their fingers. "Captain Rogers, pardon me for being so forward, but I do have to say that you are just fucking gorgeous."
If only he had taken one final trip in the quantum tunnel before they'd left. Then he could have ensured that this was the only way they could win, rather than leave it up to chance.
He hit ENTER, and the whole thing immediately went blank, only for the words, INITIATE SYSTEM to appear across the top a couple seconds later.
"Well, someone's gotta keep this guy in line," Sam said, jerking his head towards Bucky. "In fact, I'm pretty sure he still owes Steve for those drink rounds we had way back when."
As it was, he still had to reign in his tears as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and lined himself up, slowly pushing inside him.
"Those 'ole Dodgers play all the way across the country now, and they didn't even make the playoffs," said Sam. "So why don't you just quit your whining and let me gloat for a bit here."
And he knew it would be even worse for Tony and Peter because of Stane's betrayal. Sam was definitely going to have his work cut out for him once the experiment was over.
"Both Captain Rogers and I would appreciate it, Mr Chairman," said Tony, smiling when he felt Steve squeeze his knee under the table.
"You know, my mom's making fried chicken and mashed potatoes for us," Gwen said as Peter ripped open his third bag of Doritos. They were sitting on the floor of her bedroom, a three thousand piece Harry Potter puzzle scattered in front of them. "And I made sure to remind her about the peppermint."
"I'm ready," Tony pleaded as Steve pulled his fingers out, only to re-slick them and press them in again, curling them so he could brush across the magic spot that made Tony cry out. "Oh,
It wasn't that Tony didn't have a plan. It was just that he felt like he was being forced to involve Peter against his will. Objectively, Tony knew how strong his son was, and how well he could handle himself in the field—or rather, in the safety-controlled field that was the Avengers' training dome up at the Compound. He also knew that Peter had managed to find and break into HYDRA's secret—and very much
"All right, all right, there's no need for us to keep snarking at each other," said Bruce. He turned to Steve, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "You did ask me to find out who was on the other end of the pager, so… there ya go. Looks like we got a response."
"Anthony Stark is a civilian scientist working for the Air Corps," Steve said through clenched teeth. "He graduated with top honours from Langara's finest university, and is responsible for the design of both the X-301 and X-302 aircrafts. He has also been conducting classes and simulations with the six Air Corps test pilots in preparation for the X-302 space-faring missions."
"You sure I wouldn't be takin' you away from your schoolwork?" Uncle Bucky asked after a short pause.
"Nat, do that again!" called Clint, jumping down to the ground next to her. He quickly notched an arrow, launching it in an arc to land in the exact same spot where the hole had just reformed and sending a shockwave of electricity rippling throughout the entire creature. Less than a second later Steve heard the unmistakable sound of Tony's repulsors firing as Tony shot out of the water straight up through the monster, carrying Peter's limp body in his arms.
“Exploding bullets?” Peter said under his breath as he tapped to the next page, his eyes going even wider.  “What the
The woman's eyes widened, staring down at Natasha's hand as if she was afraid it was going to catch fire or something. "Carol," she finally said as she tentatively grasped Natasha's hand. "Carol Danvers, formerly of Kree Starforce."
Tony yelled, his heart lurching when Steve flinched. "It just can't, okay! I don't give a damn what Fury said, I need to get this done! Because if I don't, then—oh God, Steve, if I don't, then—"
A knot rose in Steve's throat. He had certainly seen his share of seemingly insurmountable odds over the course of his ninety-five—or was it thirty-one?—years. Born to a recently widowed mother, sickly from birth to the point where doctors warned his ma that he'd be dead before he was thirty, and then orphaned at eighteen, Steve had gotten used to overcoming odds by the time he was finally accepted into the Army.
"Oh will you just shut the hell up, Syler?" Chester snapped over the comm. "Everyone knows that a tonic water isn't worth a damn thing unless it's got at least two limes in it!"
—it was so hard 'cause even though Pete was the baby, I felt like Howard was even more so, you know? And then Pete, he kept having these spells during the nights where he was just inconsolable. He'd just scream his little head off for hours and hours and hours, and no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get him to calm down… and I felt like I was just spinning my wheels in the dirt, not able to actually get anywhere."
"Yeah, I know, 'cause the Mets suck," grumbled Bucky, folding his arms across his chest. "Hmph. Our ole Dodgers wouldn't've treated me like this."
Instead of replying, Steve captured Tony's lips again, kissing him so hard and so deeply that Tony was panting by the time they broke apart.
"Yes. Her name was Hela," said Papa. Finished with his dough, he handed Peter a block of mozzarella cheese, taking the cheddar for himself. "And she caused the deaths of a lot of people and managed to destroy Thor's hammer before Thor and Loki were able to stop her."
Tony whimpered as he slid his palms across Steve's shoulders and up to cup his face. "Anything, Steve. I'll give you anything."
Gathering up his books and computer, Peter quickly checked his phone as he waited for Gwen, making note of the text from Papa that he'd be arriving to pick him up in about ten minutes. That likely meant that Dad was still working on the SHIELD data with Uncle Bruce, which also meant that Peter might even get to see some of it. Aside from the fact that he really enjoyed working with Dad and Uncle Bruce—he especially loved to listen to them bicker in their "science-speak", as Papa called it—Peter was already fascinated by Wakanda and was very eager to learn more about it.
To Tony's relief it wasn't Phillips who stepped inside the cramped, overstuffed office, it was Rhodey, his face falling as he took in Tony's disheveled appearance.
Redesigning the whole thing to function as a continuous source of clean energy instead of a defence system had been Peter's idea, as had expanding it to encompass the entire planet rather than only Langaran airspace. Somehow Peter was convinced that once the military leaders saw that there could truly be an end to the war that had ravaged their planet for decades, they would have no choice but to accept it.
“But no games with Ned till it’s done, yeah?” Tony adds.  “If you're gonna be swimming every day now, you’re gonna need to get your rest, so you might just have to tell Ned that his Minecraft hut will have to wait for a bit.”
Not surprisingly, the following day seemed to fly by in only a matter of minutes, to the point where Tony could hardly believe it as he and Steve pulled into Sarah's driveway to say goodnight to Peter. He had been working frantically all day long, uploading the latest version of JARVIS into Steve and Carol's X-302s and double-checking everything from the satellite mounting brackets to the mechanism he'd derived for Steve to deploy the tesseract. Since he couldn't just mount the tesseract on the outside of the aircraft, Tony had to come up with a way for it to be stored inside the aircraft itself. Thankfully, when he had designed the X-302s he'd left a mechanism in place from earlier aircraft that could essentially function as a type of bomb bay door, and while Carol's was sealed shut since the X-302s didn't require such a mechanism, the door on the underside of Steve's aircraft was now functional, allowing him to deploy the tesseract once all of the satellites were in place.
"Are Dad and Uncle Bruce still working?" he asked as they headed out of the café. "I was kinda hoping to see what they found."
Lang's jaw opened and closed as he tried to come up with a response, finally muttering a quiet, "Ah, sure. But if you're gonna ask me how the suit works or anything like that, I'm afraid I can't tell you."
"No way in hell," Tony muttered with wide eyes. He grabbed onto Steve's biceps, gliding his palms up to his shoulders as Steve pulled him closer, tucking Tony's head under his chin. Tony sighed in contentment at the sound of Steve's low, deep heartbeat beneath his ear, briefly closing his eyes. Back in the beginning of their relationship Tony had been a bit self-conscious about the fact that Steve was so much taller than him, and the way he could just manhandle Tony whenever he felt like it, but now he absolutely loved it. Tony loved being completely enveloped by Steve's arms when they hugged, loved being the smaller spoon when they cuddled at night, and he especially loved it when Steve carried him off to bed, as if he just couldn't wait the few extra seconds for Tony to simply walk there.
"It was such a pleasure serving you gentlemen on this fine evening," their waiter said as Tony paid the bill, giving him a three hundred dollar tip. "I hope you have a both have a lovely evening, and happy anniversary."
"Like a charm," said Tony. "She had me hold Pete against my chest so his ear was pressed right over my heart, and then she took this long piece of cloth and wrapped it around the two of us until he was as snug as a bug in a rug. And then he just sort of relaxed into me. I'd say it was less than three minutes later when he popped his tiny thumb into his mouth and fell asleep."
"For a time there will be a need," Uncle Thor replied. "My people are strong, but losing one's home is enough to challenge the strength of even my fellow Asgardians, I'm afraid. However, as I am still not convinced it is in my people's best interests for me to be their ruler, I do believe that I will be back. I just do not yet know when that might be."
For a long time Uncle Bucky stood still as a rock, his face impassive. Finally, he gave a short nod.
Pulling back his right hand again, Steve had just stepped into his swing when something grabbed his arm, yanking him backwards so hard that he tripped, flopping down onto the mat in an undignified heap.
Peter shrugged, trying to smile. "Nah, it's okay. I have two dads that are both pretty cool, so I think I'm good."
Tony had warned Steve about how weird it felt to get yanked into the tunnel, so he was able to brace himself as Tony flipped his various switches and knobs and counted down from three. But he still wasn't quite prepared for how harsh the tug actually was, like a parachute opening directly behind the small of his back. As soon as he was inside the tunnel the warp trails appeared, exactly like he was flying on one of
As the announcer starts to introduce the swimmers, Steve swings his arms back and forth, hoping it’s not obvious to the crowd or anyone else that he’s nursing his left shoulder.  Fear starts to build deep in his gut as he carefully stretches out his triceps, fear he quickly tries to stamp back down again.
"So," he said in a loud whisper. "That dude in the red suit who keeps trying to give me orders, that's your dad?"
"You're damn right he is," said Tony. "He was probably too good, so our government had no choice but to ground him."
"Well, I might've been inspired to try and look my best on this fine autumn afternoon," Tony whispered back. "You know, something 'bout a once-in-a-lifetime special occasion, or so I heard."
"I'm actually surprised that Peter knew about it," Gwen said as she shot Peter a playful wink. "Does your family even do your own laundry?"
"I'll make sure you and your team receive a continuous feed on all incoming known casualties, Captain," the general said. General Arnold, one of few remaining top Pentagon officials, had been coordinating with the Avengers ever since their return to the Compound three days ago. "We sure do appreciate the help you've already given us."
Steve reached for Tony's hand as they backed out of Peter's room, the muscles in his jaw twitching as they made their way down the hall to their bedroom. Tony had barely had time to cross the threshold when Steve halted, turning to Tony and hoisting him into his arms as he backed him up against the wall.
Tony sighed, glancing up at Steve. It was starting to look more and more like he'd been right about Peter's senses.
he thought, not without the slightest hint of humour. Oh, Tony had no doubt that if Steve had been there to witness Mr Dumb-Lord holding a fucking
"Ah…" Steve stammered, gasping as he pressed his palm to his chest. He knew he needed to ask, but at the same time he really,
"Not so strong now, are ya, asshole?" Quill taunted as he and Gamora landed next to Thanos. "For the record, this was
"Look, I'm not gonna rehash our argument again, mostly 'cause I just don't want to, but honey, as much as I hate to tell you, it probably won't be the only one that we ever have, and I can't have you going out there and trying to get yourself killed every time that we do. Okay? Especially now that Pete's latched onto you already, I can't have him worrying about you every single time you take off."
Replacing the punching bag, Steve slowly curled his fingers into his palms and started again, not pausing for longer than it took to breathe until he had sent the bag flying, landing directly on top of the others. His record so far was ten, made the afternoon that Tony and Bruce had discovered the campaign funding trail that connected HYDRA to President Cole, and while he currently only had three more bags on hand, he had a feeling that he was fired up enough to get through all of them before Tony came looking for him.
“I am afraid that I am unsure, sir,” JARVIS answered, sounding quite disturbed.  “The last time stamp on the document prior to now is dated the eighteenth of February, 2006, so I am unsure as to how—”
His lungs burning for air and his legs screaming for mercy, Steve slowed his pace as he approached the training dome, allowing himself a courtesy glance at the building that had been all but abandoned since the snap. He supposed if one could possibly find a silver lining in the last few months, it was that Thanos either managed to snap all of the potential Avenger villains out of existence, or they were all simply too scared to try something in the still-chaotic aftermath.
"Peter!" Steve shrieked as Image Peter's hands slipped slightly on the railing. He jerked back as he saw himself enter the image, looking up at Image Peter dangling from the railing as he raced up a broken metal ladder.
That mission, which wasn't a mission as much as it was an outright kidnapping by a pair of madmen and their super soldier minions, and one that very nearly cost both Dad and Peter their lives. But since Peter couldn't tell Ned anything about what really happened, he had to stick with the cover story that he was just locked in some safehouse somewhere while his dads and the rest of the team took care of everything, instead of the self-inflicted coma he was in after almost having his mind completely scrambled by Loki's sceptre.
he thought as he rinsed the soap bubbles from his hands.  While he certainly wasn't an expert, to him it had seemed as though Steve suffered from some sort of neurological disorder, and Stark Industries had helped to develop several protein-based drugs that were being studied for various things.  Maybe there was a way Peter could get Steve involved in one of their clinical trials.
Obie’s face was so red by that point it was almost purple, his index finger shaking as he pointed it directly in Tony’s face.
Tony exclaimed, his jaw dropping in shock as Steve's heart did a flip inside his chest. "Colonel, you cannot be serious!"
"You do?" asked Peter. Papa had never mentioned anything about his name being blacklisted or anything. "How?"
"At inappropriate times," Steve finished. He pressed his lips to Tony's forehead, trailing his fingertip across Tony's cheekbone. "Yes, I do. Now, are you ready?"
"Holy shit, baby, you're just so fucking gorgeous," he whispered, burying his fingers into Steve's thick blond hair. "How are you even real?"
“Well, actually, chlorine’s not—” Peter starts, then shakes his head.  “It’s mainly the humidity, Ms Mags, but I’m sure the chlorine has something to do with it too.”
“At present, there are currently five outstanding military contracts that have yet to be fulfilled,” JARVIS began.  “One involves the Jericho missiles, of which we have delivered three of the requested nine units.  Three other contracts for various small arms and ammunition will be fulfilled with orders scheduled to be shipped within the next two to three weeks, and the final contract will be fulfilled following three more shipments of the rifles currently housed in the upstate warehouse.”
"It's a go," Steve said, tightening his grip on his shield. "King T'Challa and his warriors will be our backups."
“Ah, which just happen to be your favourites, hmm?” Tony said.  He sucked in a quick, deep breath.  “So, seems like you two are running a pretty decent business here, yeah?”
"Don't really wanna talk about my father right now, if that's okay with you," Tony whispered. He kissed the same spot again and Steve shivered, clutching Tony even closer to him.
"He wasn't too upset with them, was he?" asked Steve as Clint started yelling for Natasha to come and help him up as Wanda and Pietro giggled in the background.
"I love you so much, little guy," Steve said as he cupped Peter's round cheek in his hand. "And I promise that as soon as I get back we're gonna get you fixed up, okay? You just gotta stay strong until then."
"That's not what he wants," he murmured. "All he wants is to be a normal kid. To go to school, and climb trees, and have sleepovers with his friends. He never wanted to be a hero, Steve. All he wanted was a chance to just be a kid."
"My father thought so," T'Challa said with a sigh. "And while I am not my father, I do believe that his belief was strong enough to help me come to understand it as well, eventually." He looked down at his hand, twirling an elaborate silver ring around his index finger. "At least, that is my hope."
"No, thanks," muttered Steve. "I think I'll just… go and get cleaned up." It was only about an hour until dinnertime so too late for him to sneak away to visit Peter, and if he took a long enough shower and then went over his briefing materials for the new aircraft one more time, he would hopefully be calmed down enough to eat.
Peter gave a nod. "Yeah, I have, and he just said the same thing that he always says, which is that I just have to give it time. But,
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Steve finally says.  He clears his throat, gesturing towards Peter’s duffel bag.  “Are you ready to get started?”
"I love you so much, sweetheart," he whispered once they were back in the bed, with Tony's head pillowed on Steve's chest. "Sleep now, okay? I've got you."
“I agree, sir,” JARVIS cut in, and Tony could’ve sworn that he almost sounded worried.  “I will report back as soon as I can.”
"No, not exactly," Steve said as he sat down on the side of the bed. He bit down on his bottom lip, unsure exactly where to begin.
that Steve and Sam had on the arms of their suits. After his critical help during the battles in both the Miami and HYDRA bunkers, Bucky had more than proven himself a worthy addition to their team.
"Captain, you must accompany Shuri," the general said, indicating for her warriors to begin retrieving the stones. "She will take care of your husband."
And then maybe, just maybe, Tony and Peter could finally walk away from the legacy of making things that blow up, and embrace one of creation instead.
Bucky smiled as he leaned back against the bench. "That's better," he said, patting the brand-new sniper rifle that Tony had recently finished building for him. "So, what's the plan?"
The news, of course, had been a frenzy of activity, with various reporters and so-called "experts" still discussing the sudden appearance of the first spaceship over New York City—and its subsequent sudden disappearance—as well as the unexplained space phenomenon that was recorded over Africa approximately twenty hours later. Tony and Bruce had both theorised that the phenomenon in question had been caused by the collapse of Thanos' wormhole, which, thanks to the protective shield that encased Wakanda from the rest of the world, had been the only visible evidence of the battle.
Gathering up all of his books and loose papers, Peter stacked them neatly next to his laptop and headed towards the living room, arriving just as the elevator doors opened to reveal Uncle Bucky. Peter immediately smiled at the sight of him, even as he felt a pang of sadness at the tentative, almost embarrassed expression on Uncle Bucky's face. He had been living in the Tower for over a year already, but it still often seemed—or at least seemed so to Peter—as if Uncle Bucky still couldn't believe that he was allowed to live there, much less interact with the rest of their family.
He was cut off by Gwen's fingers brushing across his lips. "I know," she whispered. "I just wanted to tell you good luck, and to be careful. Please?"
"Nice catch, Captain. You're absolutely right," Tony said proudly, sending another bolt of heat down Steve's spine. "Once you're actually in space the power source will only be used for deploying the satellites and hitting your re-entry window. Otherwise the planet's gravity will be doing all the heavy work for you."
"Yeah, well, that's not shocking." He pulled on his mask, glancing in both directions as he tried to get his bearings. "I need to find my papa. Will you help me?"
"Because those two scientists being killed while running experiments on the tesseract proves that the government, and specifically General O'Brien, knows how powerful it is," said Tony. "And it also happens to correspond with what my father always said about it. He knew better than anyone the immensity of the power held inside that damn cube, and yet no one listened to him. Just because his last name is Stark."
Which is just fine with Tony.  As much as he loves his boy, Tony’s got far too much on his mind at the moment to feel like listening to yet another story about how two of his classmates nearly blew up the fume hood during chemistry lab.
"Mmm," muttered Tony as he popped an oyster cracker into his mouth. He still had trouble accepting compliments from Steve, something Steve was actively working to change. "Tell me more about her. What was she like?"
His rather passionate love affair with whisky apparently didn't help at all either, and while Grandpa had insisted after Peter's admission that he had dumped all of the whisky down the drain, Peter could still often smell it on him when he came to visit.
"We should at least explain all of this to Tony and Bruce, Steve," Natasha said firmly. "Let them decide if it's possible or not."
"Maybe not, but they would at least be a start," Stacy insisted. "And I also have plenty of police colleagues down in D.C. who would be more than happy to start making some arrests if we could gather enough evidence to justify them." He stepped forward, offering Tony his hand. "We want to help you, Mr Stark, you just have to let us."
Ned's eyes were wide as he watched Mr Harrington disappear out of the gym. "Wow. You gotta wonder sometimes, don't you?"
"Would you like me to escort you home now?" he asked as they began walking back towards the base. "I don't mind at all."
“Mmm, that’s good,” says Tony.  Stepping inside the elevator, Tony punches the button for the third floor, smiling when Peter lays his head against Tony’s shoulder as the elevator starts to move.  Their apartment is at the end of the hallway off the elevator, which Tony likes since it means less foot traffic going by their door and less chance that they’ll hear the annoyingly loud
"Maybe," Peter said into Tony's chest. "But the fact is that I am having to deal with it, and I just don't want to anymore. I just want it gone, Dad, all of it. I'm sick of having a ticking time bomb stuck inside of me, and I just want it out of my head." He tipped his head up to look into Tony's eyes. "Please? I don't—I don't want other people to get hurt again because of me. That's not what heroes do."
"Yeah, I see it. Pete must've overheard something," Tony said, his voice laced with so much guilt and self-loathing that Steve's heart clenched. "JARVIS?"
"Well, then so as long as we can be sure that all our ducks are in a row before the aircraft launch, I don't see a problem."
Tony drew in a deep breath as he nodded. Thor had become quite fond of both Sam and Steve's cooking since he'd been back, and had taken to requesting certain meals when he didn't feel like ordering his usual pizzas or fried chicken deliveries.
"Then we need to get the ship up and running! Like five minutes ago already!" Tony exclaimed. "Quill, you got any tools on that ship of yours?"
And while that agreement hadn't made Rhodey an official member of the Avengers, given the facts that he still divided most of his time between D.C. and Edwards Air Force Base out in California and used his armour to complete specific missions for the Air Force, the entire team still considered him to be a sort of honorary member, someone both Tony and Steve knew they could count on if they needed him.
items and headed towards the back, smiling as Ashes poked her cute whiskered nose from out behind the door.
have to remind you that flying these aircraft is a privilege, one that I am both reluctant to grant and quick to remove. And, last but not least, I should also
"Thanos already had two of the stones, Steve!" Bruce exclaimed. "He had the Mind Stone and the purple one, the—the—"
Tony's eyes narrowed, then widened as the realisation hit him about three heartbeats later. "Uhh… how, exactly?" he asked. "'Cause wasn't he listed as one of the—one of the—"
They weren't going to take him or any of the rest of the team without a fight, that was certain, but it also meant that Tony needed to work
"His message states that all perpetrators responsible for the two attacks in Namibia have been accounted for," said JARVIS.
"Yes, we did," Natasha said before Steve could answer. She gave Carol a friendly smile that was only slightly forced. "So, we were kinda hoping you might be able to help us figure out what happened here—"
"Colonel Phillips is not looking to replace one military dictator with another. He has absolutely no desire to be in power, and in fact had to be convinced by myself and several others to even agree to what he's agreed to."
A second later the equations scrolled across Tony's screen, displaying the exact coordinates that the team members would need to calculate their anchor points in the tunnel. Tony glanced up at Bruce once it was fully displayed, trying to gauge his reaction.
"Uh huh," came the answer from somewhere in the depths of the room. Pushing the door open, Tony stepped inside, frowning when he noticed Peter's rumpled but empty bed. He glanced up, intending to look towards the overstuffed chair against the wall, and immediately jumped back with a gasp when his eyes landed on his boy sitting up in the far corner of his room by the ceiling, dressed in his favourite Hulk pyjamas and reading from his thick quantum physics textbook.
"Yeah, I know," Peter said as he finally found a tree tall enough to launch one of his webs, smiling under the mask at the awesome
"Well… no, I'm really not," said Peter. "Why do you think Dad never went out with anyone once I got sick? No one else wanted a defective kid."
In fact, he'd had to remind Steve a few times that even though he was a bit smaller than him and didn't have super-soldier serum coursing through his veins, he wasn't made out of glass either.
"King T'Challa," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "While you've met some of our team already, I'd like to introduce us all again, if I may."
"Papa," Steve suddenly heard, both from Peter on the bed and inside his own mind. He immediately snapped his head back, clapping a hand over his ear.
"Has the potential for extra-atmospheric flight," Tony finished. "Yes. That is exactly what I'm telling you."
“Dad, I was just trying to help!” Peter cried.  “I thought if I could find some evidence that Obie was doing stuff behind your back, that—”
Tony whispered as his arms wound around Steve's waist, his palms splayed across his ass. "Honey, you're just—"
"Oh hell, not this again!" Peter said as the monster swung again, this time aiming for Peter's abdomen. Peter jumped back barely avoiding the blow and launching another web even as he realised that it would probably be useless.
Steve grunted as he drove his right fist into the tough, leather-backed canvas of the punching bag, gritting his teeth against the ache in his fingers as he followed it with two quick left jabs. He was drenched in sweat, his workout clothes sticking to his skin and his too-long hair hanging across his forehead and into his eyes, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He had rested from most of his exercise routine for the entire week the team had been in Italy, thinking his body could use the break, and now it was time for him to get back into the swing of things.
"We're just going to the back of the room, mo grá," Steve pleaded as Bucky took his place next to Peter. He offered Peter his metal left hand which Peter immediately latched onto, squeezing it so tightly that his knuckles went white. "Bucky's gonna stay here with Peter."
But they hadn't been. From what both Tony and Bruce had been able to determine, the strange beam that attacked Wakanda had originated from space.
Luckily, Thor caught on immediately, raising his hammer above his head until the sky was filled with crackling lightning bolts and Steve felt the hair on his arms start to rise. He then watched as Thor shot the electric bolts directly at Tony, squeezing Peter's hand when Tony stumbled slightly backwards as he absorbed the charge.
“That’s exactly what I’m telling you,” Peter whispered as he pulled up another document, the un-redacted version of the employee file for Regina Williams.
As soon as Steve heard the back door close, he slid his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him close for a kiss.
look he'd had for most of the battle, but Tony could tell he was genuinely surprised at what he was seeing.
And if it happened to help prove to them that he could be a more than capable addition to the Avengers at the same time, well, that was just icing on the cake.
"Now then," he began. "You're all here because you've demonstrated exceptional proficiency in the X-301 aircrafts." He pointed to the diagram of the X-301 with the tip of his pen. "As I'm sure you're all aware, the X-301 was built as an experimental aircraft designed to test a brand-new rounded hull, replacing the more conventional bi-wing design with something that's more aerodynamically sound. Well, based on all the reports that you've all filed following your routine patrols, it seems as though that design has performed even better than we could've hoped."
Tommy removed the helmet and took out his phone, looking at the cracked screen with a sigh. “This is going to take forever.” he mumbled. He started his trek toward the city, though without another word. He knew better than to hitchhike. If someone recognized him, he didn’t know what would happen. Tommy had been at high risk being kidnapped since the day they created him. Everyone wanted the son with the DNA of Iron Man and Captain America. They all thought he would have the effects of the super serum, and it disappointed them when it was discovered that he didn’t.
“Or maybe you're more like Pietro than everyone thinks and you're just selfish and wanted to save yourself.”
“What did I miss, where is James?” Azari asked, walking out of the bathroom in a towel. “What did you do tweety?”
“I just wanted to make sure, I didn’t know if this was going to be a set thing to happen, but Tony wanted to make sure everything was fine just in case. I really did want to be there for the meeting.” Pepper told her.
The years continued to pass, and the laws tightened for mutants. The year 2040 came, and the Mutant Registration Act passed, the last thing signed by the president before his re-election. When he won again, the panic began.
“They took her. Reed, Johnny and Ben are all fine, Sue got caught up in the crossfire.” Bucky told him. “But she seems to be doing fine according to reports. Xavier’s seems to be the one with the most casualties.”
While the government raised their army to defeat the enemy, they had created. Their enemy continued to prepare for the inevitable. The X-Men prepared their children for the worst-case scenario and had been for years now. The children weren’t so young now; they didn’t just shrug off what was happening because they couldn’t do anything. Now they were older, now they could fight. Now they could vote, now they were legal adults. While many of them held the same beliefs as their parents, they were the same ones nearing their breaking point. They saw too much, and they had done too little.
“Well if Kie is in I’m in” Tommy stated. “ I’m not going to let him dive head first into anything without me.”
“James Rogers…” the other boy responded hesitantly. Natasha and Steve both watched their son silently. The two ignored Tommy’s snickers off to the side, and the grumble after when Kielar elbowed him.
“I know that it's the safest place for him, and I know you won’t let anything happen to him.” Daken said. “I have to clear up the line, you make sure everything stays calm on your end and I’ll take care of things out here. Your speedster will be fine. I don’t think there is much left at Xavier’s, I have a team coming in dropping off a plane full of mutants we got from the vans. Remember, only this line to contact. It’s secure. Everyone is to be checked before they enter the building for tracking devices.”
Natasha let out a long exasperated sigh and refused to look at any other person in the room. “I know.”
“I don’t like the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D has their hands in this new project, but I trust the Avengers.” Mara admitted to the room. The others looked around at each other and it fell silent for a bit.
“Until I hulked out” Blaine piped up. “He was hurting my Mama. They won’t tell you that though” The boy said not moving from his spot, his brown curly hair falling down over his glasses. “These cookies are really good, thank you for getting them for me Mr. Stark.”
Anna wiped away her tears as she heard  her daughter's voice. When it ended she moved the soldiers out of the house and placed her hands on the brick, slowly making a glow take over. As she moved away and moved toward the woods, the house exploded, leaving everything behind, and a determination in her to find her family again. Before she could make it, she felt something hit her in the neck and pulled it out before turning around. Her vision blurred and the last thing she felt was a collar going around her neck. “We got one” a voice said just as she lost consciousness.
“I’m not worried about him. I have a twin as well. She might be the same way when she find out.” Eliza laughed as she made blaines order and also grabbed a bag to hand to him. “I close up in an hour. “
While Stark Tower was home to several members of the Avengers, it remained a mystery to others. Mara sat at the desk in the room Tony had given her three years ago when she had first come to visit. The tower still had many places she had not explored, but tonight wasn’t going to be a time for that. She was staying the night because James and Natasha were as well, but there had already been plans set with Francis. Natasha had known, and suggested she give in a little extra time before they would meet up. Mara had simply agreed knowing her friend would probably be spending a little time with his father after the meeting they had just had.
“Listen Richards, I have to go. We’ll be in touch.” Tony said hanging up before the other could answer him. “Get Tommy and Kielar to the lab Steve, I’ll meet you there.” He told his husband before punching in several codes on his security system. “Jarvis, activate Safe Haven Protocol.”
“Contrary to what you might believe, kid,” Daken began, without turning around. “Xavier’s is not the only place in the world where mutants exist.”
“It’s the best kept secret.” Kielar admitted. “Let me go pick up Jett, Vivienne should still be waiting to be checked in at the lobby, so you can easily find her.”
Francis Barton propped his feet up on the dashboard as his father drove them toward the archery range. It had been the custom for them to go there since he was a kid when something serious needed to be said. It had been some time since they had gone there and the eighteen year old knew that they would be having that kind of conversation tonight. Luckily this didn’t exactly have to go back to his mother. He dreaded even thinking about that. The silence in the car was a comfortable one. The two never had to really say much when they were together. Their bond as father and son was a strong one, that had gone through many trials in the past, literal trials.
“My mother, in New York, but she rarely sends me anything this late.” he said as he pressed the button to play the message.
“You…” Bucky watched as his partner pulled his temper back as he tried to handle his brother. “Don’t ever do that again.” he growled. “I know you are upset, and I know Mouse is upset, and you are trying your best to handle the situation, but do not come after me.”
“I don’t even need you to finish that sentence.” James said, moving toward the two. Standing behind them, he watched the live stream and let out a sigh. “He was supposed to go into hiding. Why am I not surprised though? I mean, this is Tommy and he can’t keep his mouth shut even when it is critical.” He grabbed a hoodie from the armchair and slid it on. “Where is the location, I obviously need to go rescue my brother, so he doesn’t get his ass kicked or arrested?”
“Oh this? Just picking what I should take. That pile over there is what I’m keeping here.” he informed her by motioning to the entire left side of the room. “And over here is maybe, what’s on the bed is going.”
Now Bruce Banner was a father of two. His only saving grace was that they were grown and could for the most part take care of themselves. If they were any younger than sixteen it would have been a disaster for him. Bruce had been spending time watching them, getting to know  how they were, but rarely interacted with them. He had noticed some quirks in each of them that they probably didn’t realize they had.
“Sometimes I forget that you four are part Howlett.” She smiled a bit. “We can’t go anywhere, our ride will be here by tomorrow morning if anything.”
“What is your problem with her?” Heather spoke up. “She is the one who found the information so that we could even rescue you.”
“Alright. Also, I go by Akihiro off the field, Daken is my codename only.” he explained.  Johnny nodded and continued to follow the two. “I still think you should stay here with your kids.”
It wasn’t long before the plane landed in a secluded area, shielded well from prying eyes. As everyone piled off the plane, the sun started to rise, and the realization of how much time had passed hit everyone. The exhaustion was setting in for all the teens and young adults as they sat in the grass. James and Heather moved to the group and dismantled the collars they wore. The tension in the area slowly dissolved.
Steve gave a single nod, his fingers twitching slightly in Tony's as they rubbed up against the cool metal of his engagement ring.
"That's not true at all, Peter," he said, and a shiver shot down Peter's spine at how scared he sounded. "It's just like Dad said, it doesn't matter how strong you are, or that you can fly through the air on your webs or climb up walls, you're still just—"
"Yeah, well, when you put it like that, I'll admit that it does sound pretty bad," Lang muttered. He dropped his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Look, as soon as Hank told me about the Pym Particle, or whatever the hell it is, I told him that I thought we should just call you guys. You know, the Avengers?"
Which, not surprisingly, he did.  And a huge part of that was just how easily Peter fell in love with Steve too.  Tony had promised himself after Peter was born that he would dedicate himself to being the best father he could possibly be, breaking the cycle of shame that had haunted the Stark family for generations.  He had sworn that his old partying, playboying ways would come to an end the very moment the nurse laid his tiny son in his arms.  From that second on, Peter would always come first.
Tony moaned as he rolled his hips against Steve's, the sheets slipping down to the backs of his knees as their cocks rubbed together. "You're already pleasing me, baby. But I'm gonna take care of you this morning, okay? You've been—" He broke off, unable to finish his thought as he looked deep into Steve's gorgeous eyes, so lust-blown that only a hint of the blue was still visible.
Two months passed since the last time Tony almost got killed, again. But what the rest of the Avengers didn't figure out, maybe Clint or Natasha did. But it was that Pepper had stopped spending so much time in the Tower. That she spent most of her time in Malibu and she just called Tony for the meetings. Tony didn't even pay attention because he was in his lab most of the time.
"Both of you stop it; we have to make sure that you are better so we can get back to Gotham." Pepper told them both.
"Oh I just come to congratulate you in your business with Mr. Wayne, Captain is nice to meet you." She said.
"I don't know Clark, if I can't actually find Scarecrow than maybe I can slow down." Batman told him.
Tony felt like puking his stomach out. He didn't even notice Bruce coming until he came and held his hand, like Tony had done for him that day in his parent's funeral. Once the caskets are lowered he wants to leave and Bruce seems to read this and pulls him with him toward one of the cars. Obadiah wants to object, but Alfred stands in his way.
"It's a good time I have my own paper to write if they keep this up." Clark said and sat down right there next to him.
"MORNING FELLOW WARRIORS." Thor bellowed out, they had become accustomed a bit to Thor's way of talking-loudly.
"No." Bruce told him and Clark smiled before he pulled out the box and opened it, but Bruce looked at Clark. "Are you sure?"
"I doubt he would have the appetite Clark." Bruce told him but he had a ghost of a smile that told Clark he was having way too much fun with it. To tell the truth Tony had called Bruce and totally bragged about it, so he knew that Tony was going to rub it in Clarks face.
"Okay." Steve told him and grabbed his waist and just followed Tony's lead before he was leading them in the dance. It was nice and Tony was a very good partner.
"Hmph," grumbled Tony as Steve headed for the bathroom. "Why does the high school have to start so damn early anyway?"
Plus, since the training exercises were the only chances that he had to be Spider-Man at the moment, he really, really missed them.
“Think you’ve found a good one there, Rhodey,” Tony murmured to Rhodey as Happy and Carol dragged Obie from the office, still spewing his nonsense.  “I’m happy for you.”
A light smile stretched across Steve's lips as he nodded, reaching over to his bedside table for a bottle of lube as Tony worked Steve's sleep pants down just far enough to free his erection. Then Steve squeezed a generous amount of the lube into his palm and wrapped his long fingers around both of their cocks, their combined groans sending ripples of pleasure down Tony's spine.
"Yeah, we do, actually," Peter protested, grinning as he felt his cheeks turning pink. "Papa does it most of the time, says it's a waste of money to have it sent out when he's perfectly capable of doing it himself. I mean, all their fancy suits get sent out still, but he washes all of our regular everyday stuff, and cleans his own uniforms."
"I'm not going to acknowledge something when it's not inevitable," he replied. Then he turned the knob and stepped through the door, slamming it closed behind him.
And while Peter knew that Papa and Dad would try and protect him if something like that were to happen, there was no way that Peter was going to just sit by and let everyone else take the blame for his idea. He'd been the one who had pushed Dad into developing Project Phoenix, and if anyone deserved to be punished for it, it was him.
Steve thought as he began a rough sketch of the nice log cabin sitting about twenty-five metres away.
Tony quirked an eyebrow. "He says he has that Asgardian guardian of his keep an eye on us, whatever that means, but if that's the case then why didn't he show up at the bunker? We could've used him then too."
"Okay, but…" Steve bit his lip. None of that made any sense. "Bucky, my ma was an Air Corps widow too, and she told me she was forced to get a job only a month after I was born or we would've been evicted from the house. Was that compensation fund around back then too?"
Steve nodded. He had never seen any indication that Gwen didn't absolutely adore Peter, and he knew Peter adored her just as much. "If you need anything, or need to get a hold of me, just ask JARVIS, all right?"
The only problem was, Steve was no longer convinced he could do this all day. Or even for another single second.
"Yeah, bud, just a bit frustrated," Tony finally said, huffing out a sharp breath. "You know how much I love talking to those government folks."
"Nice shot, Rogers!" called Cam Mitchell. "Seemed for a second there that you weren't gonna shake that one!"
"Bullshit," grumbled Tony. "If that was the case, then why would the leadership insist on just sitting around on their above-mentioned collective asses when all it would take to fix Pete's heart is one simple goddamn phone call!"
"The monster was gonna kill him!" Peter gasped, choking as he tried to breathe in. "D-daddy, it was—it was t-trying to—it almost—and Uncle B-bucky, are we sure he's okay, 'cause—?"
It wasn't helping that Tony had become aware of Steve's rather obvious distress almost immediately, and had since done his absolute best to tease him about it.
"Mmm," grumbled Clint. "Tell me about it. And with that, I'm outta here. All this talk about food is making me hungry."
"Yeah, right," Peter said, shivering as he stuffed his hands into his pockets to try and stay warm. Now that Gwen was gone the heat was seeping from his body in waves, and while it wasn't exactly freezing outside anymore, it was still plenty cold. "Like I'd do anything like that in front of you."
"What, another drive?" asked Bucky. "C'mon, Steve! We're all in an awesome mood and it's gorgeous outside! What better time to play some ball!"
"He is badly injured, Mr Stark, but he is alive," Stacy said solemnly. "I saw him myself, so he knows we're here."
Apparently you could take the super soldier out of the 1940s, but you couldn't take the 1940s out of the super soldier. And judging by the fact that Steve still tried to brush Tony off whenever he asked if he was okay, Steve still had a long way to go.
It was how Tony had been when they first came back from Afghanistan, consumed with plans of revenge against the Ten Rings. Steve remembered vividly the night that he ventured down into Tony's workshop at the Malibu house and found him hovering a metre above the floor, testing the latest design of his flying boots. Tony had missed dinner that evening so Steve had brought him some food, and somehow over the course of their ensuing conversation Tony had ended up firing his palm repulsor off to the side of him, triggering a whole cascade of repressed memories of fighting against the HYDRA regiments during the war.
Because it was. It was just as mad as using a quantum tunnel to go back to the past to try and alter the future.
"I love you too," Tony blurted out, his teeth catching hard on his bottom lip as he watched about a thousand reactions cross Steve's beautiful face in about three seconds. "Just—just in case you were wondering. And I've—I've never said that to anyone except my son, so—"
"Yeah, it does," Peter said in a low voice. "But since the relationship the Avengers have with the Wakandan king isn't officially recognised by our government, we're not exactly advertising it too much at the moment."
Steve quickly cleared his throat.  “Yeah, little guy, I’m fine.  You just look so… grown up tonight.”
Tony threaded his fingers through Steve's hair, massaging his scalp with his fingertips. "If it were anyone else, I'd tell you that you didn't have to worry," he murmured. "I'd tell you that I was absolutely certain that it'll work because I've always been able to get my stuff to work."
"I'm afraid it's not quite that simple, Captain," T'Challa said. "Only a very few people are granted such a privilege, and it is not something that we take lightly. Communing with one's ancestors requires a ritual that not everyone is equipped to survive."
Apparently Christmas time was a popular time to purchase those types of books, as that was at least the third set he’d had to order in the last couple of weeks.
Something about Tony's tone, a slight wobble in his voice, caught Steve's attention and he sat up, eyeing his husband warily.
The eerie sound and sickening smell of Tony's burning flesh as Steve raced him inside the palace, begging him to
Tony could only shake his head, his tongue refusing to cooperate as he pointed an accusing finger at Steve, who immediately set down the tray, hurt and confusion marring his blue eyes.
Since a lot of the team members were still getting over jet lag and such, Steve had set their first official training session for the following Monday, but had asked if he, Tony, and Peter could begin working on some manoeuvres beforehand.
"Yeah, he was," agreed Phillips. "But he's not the only one." He tapped the datapad, pulling up a still from what looked like footage of a weapons demonstration.
T'Challa nodded, jerking his head towards General Okoye. "Then Thanos shall have it. We have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, and my Dora Milaje. I believe that together with your team, Captain, we shall emerge victorious."
"Barton, you and Romanoff take Stacy's team and search for Steve!" came the commanding voice of Uncle Sam, muffled through the thick glass—which obviously wasn't glass, now that Peter thought about it—of his cell. "And Tony, you and Rhodey work on picking off the rest of those flyers."
"Don't listen to anything he says," Peter cut in. "Ned was actually late getting dropped off at the Tower because
Peter nodded, tossing an offhand, "Uh huh" as he hurried down the hall to his bedroom. As soon as he'd closed the door behind him he tore into the package, a wide smile stretching across his lips as he pulled out the oversized fluffy hooded sweatshirt printed with the Oxford University crest, with the words Somebody At Oxford Loves Me surrounding it.
"Who the hell are you?" Tony yelled, grabbing onto the man's shoulders and shaking him. "I asked you a question, you asshole! Why did you attack my son?"
"Awesome." Peter raised his right arm, aiming for the small, outcropped section of their training dome about ten metres up from the ground that Tony had dubbed the Spiders Nest, which was absolutely
Again, Dad stared at Peter for several heartbeats, finally tilting his head. "Yeah, okay, Pete," he said quietly. "I guess that Spidey Sense of yours hasn't goofed up yet, has it?"
"I don't know the name of it," said Wanda. "All I know is that HYDRA stole it from a country that's known only in legends."
Sucking in another deep breath, Steve attempted to force his mind to concentrate on anything besides the terrifying groaning sound that was still increasing in volume.  It was now to the point where it was effectively blocking the rest of the natural noise of the woods, and that combined with the below-zero air and steadily increasing wind was enough to make Steve feel like he was literally frozen in place.
And now just a couple of years or so later, he was living in their Tower, and Peter was calling him 'uncle'.
“Oh, shut up, you goddamn idiotic savant!” Obie shouted, stepping forward into Steve’s personal space.  He poked Steve hard in the chest, his eyes nearly popping out when Steve didn't move a single muscle.  “You can stand there and spout all of the fucking dates that you want, but you still have no fucking
Tony had always called Steve a terrible liar, because he was. Both he and Peter, their eyes were simply incapable of perpetuating any type of falsehood. But apparently Tony's once-proficient ability to spin stories to his advantage had slipped badly in the last few years when Steve shifted up onto his elbow, tilting Tony's chin up to look at him.
“Well, I’ve always said that you're the smart one,” Tony replied.  Then he dabbed at Peter’s wet cheeks with his thumbs and kissed his forehead again, tucking the blankets up to his neck.  “Try and sleep, buddy, yeah?  Things’ll be better tomorrow.”
"Nah, not yet, I'll probably start it this weekend," answered Peter. "It's not due for a week anyway."
"Which I'll be taking," Steve said in his Captain's voice, his shoulders dropping when Tony frowned. "Please, mo grá, don't argue with me on this."
"Holy shit," Tony rasped. "I have no idea what you just said, but it sure sounded sexy as hell." He grabbed onto Steve's ass, rolling his hips up against him and pulling a low growl from Steve's throat as pleasure shot through his body like a spear. He squeezed his eyes closed, trying to get himself under some semblance of control. He was so aroused that it was almost painful, but he desperately wanted to take his time with Tony while they had this rare opportunity.
"Oh, yeah," Peter said as he gulped down the rest of his Dr Pepper. "My Uncle James and I play it together whenever he's in town."
"Oh, that was awesome!" Peter exclaimed as he shot another web at one of the flying whales. Tony's heart lurched as Peter was pulled from the ground, huffing out a sharp breath when he noticed Rhodey take up a flanking position, blasting the whale away with one of his rockets just as Peter flipped away, this time latching onto Sam Wilson's feet as he flew across.
"Which is exactly how he would've wanted it," Steve rasped. "Dr Erskine knew what would happen if HYDRA ever got their hands on his formula, which is why I made sure that they never did. And no one's been able to replicate his work since."
“Yes, Mr Stark,” said Pepper.  “Now, unless there’s something else that you need to discuss before you meet with Mr Stane, I’ll be in my office.”
that one second my dad was talking to you and the next second he's gone, like he was never even here, which is, like I said, really kinda freaky, so…" Peter trailed off, his eyebrows knitting into a frown when he got absolutely no response, not even the slightest twitch that would indicate Dr Strange had even heard him. Gritting his teeth, Peter took another step closer, snapping his fingers. "Hey! Can you even hear me? I'm trying to talk to you! My dad just disappeared, and Gamora and Nebula too, so if you know anything about why, now would be a great time to let us know—"
Laura Kinney walked back toward the cabin with a stack of wood. They had arrived the day before and she had immediately handled any of the wounds on the kids, though most of them had healed. She worried for Kestrel though, not having the same healing ability her siblings had made her more susceptible to being injured. Luckily for them, there were three others who had healing abilities. Charmaine was in the roughest shape, Laura was glad they had found the truck before they could make it out of Kentucky, it had just been too late, they had removed Charmaine's wings. They knew that Jayson and Charmaines wings were connected to their healing abilities, while she was healing, it was slower than usual. So her daughter was in bed for the time being and it was driving Laura crazy, she hated any of her children being harmed, especially after having lost Joshua a few years earlier.
"Goddamn idiots," he muttered under his breath as he called up the schematic of his latest suit, one he was planning to keep stored in the Stark Industries chopper in case of an emergency. He had already stored two suits in the SI jet, a spare one in the Quinjet, and was in the process of building another to keep in Steve's truck stowed under the passenger seat. With new villains literally popping up every couple of months he figured he couldn't be too careful, and Steve had agreed.
Of course, Steve didn't know that at the time. Sarah Rogers had been a very proud Irish woman, and as such, did not like to broadcast just how precarious their finances were, and especially not to him. Steve knew that they didn't have as much money as Bucky's family since Bucky's papa was still alive and able to work, but if he'd have known then that his new sketchbooks and pencils had cost his ma three days worth of dinners for herself, he would not have been nearly as enthralled with them as he was.
Mr Jarvis used to say whenever Tony had been bullied at school, or gotten into yet another screaming match with Howard while he was drunk. And while at the time Tony hadn't quite believed the statement itself, he had at least trusted the sentiment behind it, knowing without a doubt that Mr Jarvis had always had Tony's best interests at heart.
Bruce shook his head, not looking up from his papers. "Eh, not too much, unfortunately. I was kinda hoping that Peter would be able to uncover some more stuff, 'cause I honestly think I'm gonna go permanently cross-eyed if I do much more of this decoding." He shot Tony a rather sheepish wince as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "Sorry, Tony. I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to exploit your kid or anything, but—"
Stacy hesitated before replying. "Um… to put it delicately, Mr Stark, Captain Rogers is pretty distraught. He has to be in a lot of pain, from the looks of him, and he's also told us that HYDRA has been drugging him, so—"
He just couldn't bear the thought of going back to his home, knowing that Peter would never be there again, never greet him with a "Hey, Papa!" and one of his million-watt smiles. Never see him racing through the hallways as he and Pietro hurried out to play frisbee golf in the yard, or work on one of their new training programs. Never cook another meal with him in the kitchen, or hear him ask Steve to watch a movie, or play chess, or help him with his history homework.
"Well… maybe not emotionally, but growing up I honestly spent more time with Bucky's family than I did with my ma." Steve shrugged, running his thumb across Tony's knuckles. "I even had my own bed at their house and everything. Bucky's dad was a pilot too, so his ma was home all the time and looked after us."
"Well, I don't know," Tony said, turning to Strange. "You couldn't do one of those fancy-schmancy circle things and get us back to Earth, could ya?"
"Nothing wrong with being careful, Peter," Papa said as he pulled into the parking garage. "Now, I'm sure you're hungry?"
Steve thought as he stepped into the shower, letting out a soft moan as the hot water pelted the tense muscles in his neck and shoulders. He and Tony had splurged on a couples' massage during their vacation in Ireland over the summer, and ever since then Tony had been encouraging Steve to get another, telling him that the constant tension he carried in his upper body was hindering his recovery.
In fact, something that he had only chosen to share with a couple select people, namely Tony and Sam, Steve still was firmly convinced that if he hadn't crashed the
Steve rocked forward again, a bit more forcefully this time, then wound his arms around Tony's chest and shifted them so he was mostly on his back, with Tony half on top of him. The change in position caused Steve to slip even deeper inside him, and gave Steve free reign to glide his hands all over Tony's chest, each touch of his fingers like a hot brand on Tony's already overheated skin.
"C'mon, honey, please?" he said as his lips brushed across Steve's temple. "I know you come from the time when men weren't supposed to ask for help with stuff like that, but I thought you knew better than that by now. I'm your husband, damnit. It's not like I haven't seen it before."
"Christ, baby, you're so good," Tony breathed as Steve rid him of his t-shirt, pressing his palm gently over the starburst of scars covering Tony's heart, framed by Steve's dog tags. Tony liked to joke that they were his battle scars, remnants left behind from the arc reactor that had kept him alive for over three years, ever since he and Peter were kidnapped in Afghanistan.
Steve stared at the man, trying to keep his face as neutral as possible even as his phone buzzed in his pocket. "I guess I'm not exactly sure how you're expecting me to respond, sir," he finally said. "If you were opposed to allowing Gwen to see my son, then why did you agree to the movie date in the first place?"
Not only is Steve no longer relaxed and loose, but Shostakov’s playful slap landed right on the most painful part of Steve’s shoulder.  Steve knows he didn't do it on purpose, as so far he’s managed to keep his injury a secret from his competitors.
"You're right, we don't," said Gamora. "The wizard said there were only two possible outcomes where we would win, out of over fourteen million."
"Nope. They'll go to the poor losers who couldn't cut it for the test-flight program," Steve said with a grin. "Which, by the way, wasn't us."
“Save it, Steve,” Tony shoots back as he gets to his feet.  “You’re right.  I should go and look for supplies.”
Tearing his eyes away from Tony, Steve purses his lips, pointing to one of the perimeter corners.  “I say we start here, on the northwest corner.  If we can take out the guards there quiet-like, then hopefully we can keep the rest of ‘em from sounding some sort of alarm.”
"It's been years since I've been with anyone," he said. "And since you said that you've never… I was thinking maybe we don't have to—"
