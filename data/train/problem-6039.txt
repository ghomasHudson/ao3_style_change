"Until such time as the world ends," Fury stated, looking between the two women, "we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone." He directed the last part at Hill.
“Later, you’ll tell me why you came back up early?” Tony turned his head to look at Steve. “I know you had enough paperwork to keep you busy well up until dinner.”
“I’m thinking you’re starting to get to know me, Jarvis,” Steve responded. “Alright, so no contact unless it’s emergencies, or about the kids.” He went back to the bedroom, putting their bags under the bed, and heading back downstairs. He was a little relieved when he didn’t actually smell something trying to cook.
"That's what I was trying to go for, I think." He rubbed at one side of his temples. "Put in microwave to activate."
"Taken for my smarts and not my good looks? Now isn't that a twist." Tony noticed that he was alone in the cell.
“Aren’t you two just so funny,” Tony deadpanned as he opened the trunk. He whistled and looked over at the boys. “Peter, Wade, march on over here. You can show off all the cool stuff to Wade and the both of you take this stuff to your bedroom, and put it away where it belongs.”
It took Steve a second to actually see that they were on his floor, instead of Tony's, but when Tony stopped in the living room, he was staring at Sam napping on the couch. "Uh, you didn't get to meet him, but that's Sam."
“Oh, I know you are not about to use the small argument with me,” Bucky said, the Brooklyn boy showing just as Tony predicted he would. Bucky apparently remembered enough about Steve. “How old were you before you were begging for lessons at the boxing gym?”
"You stood by my side for all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction." He felt his throat closing a little, but he kept his tone strong. "And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?"
"I hold a lot of surprise, Mr Stark," Coulson said before turning from the mirror, tucking the tie under the button of his jacket. "I assume the boys have been wrangled into their clothes."
"Well, I didn't actually know what time it was," Tony admitted. "But, I had to make sure that I was still right before I started to dive back into a project, because you know how my brain works sometimes-"
“Are you an Avenger too?” Wade asked, and both boys were looking over at Sam now. He had told them earlier that he was pilot with a special suit, different than Iron Man’s though.
Wade merely took a couple steps back so Steve didn't fall on him and looked down at him. "You always do that."
"He's real shy at school," Wade said with a nod. "Lots of kids try to pick on him, and he's real quiet in class, but I got his back. He knows he doesn't have to be afraid of them jerks." The boy leaned his back against Tony's chest, getting comfortable. "Peter told me that you were real young in school, too, just like him."
"Call me Tony, and yes, it's perfect even." Tony smiled at the woman. "I'm the one who found you, remember? This will be good for the boys, too." Tony looked at Steve now. "I invited them both over, but Mrs Wilson hasn't been able to get a hold of her brother-in-law. I told her that I'd send her with some volunteers and we could watch Wade."
“That’s not even the best part!” Tony grinned, and pulled Steve over to look at the outfits on the bed. “But, you don’t get to see that until we’re all dressed.”
Tony was rubbing his chest a little when they walked back in, and Jamie started to turn slightly in Steve’s arms. She whined a little and Tony turned a hand to her. Steve sat down on the edge of the bed and Tony motioned for him to bring her closer. Setting Jamie down on the bed, she scooted over to tuck herself into Tony’s side. His arm came up, slowly, to wrap around her, and he turned his head to look at her.
"Because, Bruce only kicks you out of his lab if you're becoming a pest about results, or you're too vested," Steve said, moving to sit up now. He grabbed Tony's hand and pulled him into a sitting position on the bed. "And it was pretty obvious that Bruce had kicked you out when you said that he was in 'ignore-the-world' mode, and you weren't with him."
"So, letting her see the real world should be a good way to break that evil shell?" Tony nodded a bit, holding the door open for Steve. "Sounds like a solid plan. She stills seems plenty curious, so that's a good sign." He watched Steve look around the baby store, eyes wide with all the different departments, and the choices within. "We're having a family dinner tonight, so we'll try that as well. You're feeling overwhelmed all of sudden aren't you? Any word on if Natasha would be coming back soon? Is she still looking for our resident archer?"
“Half?” Steve questioned with a raised eyebrow. “Wade?” Tony nodded. “And you’re not that much older than me.”
It was much easier getting the top part of the onesie on, and he snapped up the front, then picked her up again. "That has to be so much warmer, yeah? Doesn't that feel better?"
"Mary," Tony said sternly, and she turned her head to look at him. "He's going to be Fine. And probably in ten minutes he's going to run down here, see you, and expecting pancakes." She blinked then nodded at him. "You work on the pancakes, and I will go get him."
Peter was running to the door to open it as Steve stepped out, Jamie on his hip. “Hi, Miss Meg!” He heard Peter call out and smiled a little. As he got closer he saw Peter looking up at Bucky, who was meeting his gaze right back. Steve knew that Peter could get shy, but he wasn’t acting that way now. Steve thought it was a curious reaction. “You must be Mr Steve’s friend.” Bucky let out a little grunt and nodded.
"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free." The man was moving around the space, going towards Selvig. Why wasn't Clint moving?
If you've seen the movie, and need to have nerd conversations about what happened, I'm all up for that as well! I love discussing that stuff! I have many thoughts and feels, and it gets nerdy.
Steve turned and put a hand to his chest. “Ouch, right there, hurts right there.” Tony rolled his eyes then held up a pair of boots. “Aww, for me?”
“She likes it when people talk to her,” Peter said with a smile. Jamie looked at Peter with a smile, throwing a couple squeals his way, before looking back at Bucky, and touching his longer toes. Bucky quirked a little smile at the girl. She was Steve Rogers’ kid, Bucky had no doubt about that. He looked forward to Steve going through what he had, every time he had to drag the punk from an alley. He would absolutely deny that she had wormed her way into his heart already.
"How can you work with these people? They would drive me nuts." He slouched in the chair. "My life is so messed up."
“You’re trusting me in the kitchen?” Tony said, raising his voice so Steve could hear him. “I didn’t know you wanted to see if you were immune to food poisoning!” Steve snorted as he jogged up the stairs.
"Not yet." Mary sat next to Steve, and he raised an eyebrow at her. She was about to dismiss it until Peter continued.
Peter was not going back to sleep and he was making it clear that he did not want to stay in the bassinet, letting out little cries. Mary picked him up, then glanced over at Tony as she cradled him in her arms. "Do you think you could grab the bottle in the kitchen? It should be on the counter, I was warming it up before you got here."
"Tony," she frowned a little, as her own brain started to catch up with her. "Why do you want to know?"
Tony glanced at Steve, and at the same moment Jamie was looking over at them, and let out a curious noise. The two boys turned around on the couch at her sound, and Tony winced a tiny bit.
"We're making a valitine dinner for my friend," Peter told him, turning a little shy. "He gave me a valitine at school, and I wanted to give him one back. Mama said that Daddy could help me this weekend, cause he likes boys, too"
"Good," she said, and Tony could imagine her nodding her head to punctuate the statement. "You've got more people in your corner than you know." He could hear her take a little breath. "We'll see you tomorrow, should be right before dinner."
“Mare’s down the hall, second door. It’s open,” Tony informed him. “I have to feed this one lunch, his stomach is going to eat him soon!”
“We got to eat with Mulan though!” Peter said, and Wade warbled out a reply that only Peter could understand. “And we saw Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder! She had her frying pan, it was pretty awesome. That was a lot more fun than seeing Cinderella.”
Peggy hadn’t exactly been wrong, about Steve liking Tony. The girls had followed him, whether it was up in Tony’s penthouse, or down in Steve’s room, but he was sure that they were addicted to the puffs that he made for them. But he wasn’t just doing it for the Gems, he was doing it for Tony. He also wanted the Gems to approve of him, because their opinion held a lot of sway with Tony.
"She tried to hide it from me, but I talked to Jackson about it, too," Wade said as if it made all the sense in the world.
When he slipped out of Peter's room, leaving the door open a little, nightlights in the hall and the bedroom, he saw Rhodey there, leaning against the wall. They headed down the hall, towards the living room. "Your Doctor got out, alright." Tony had called one of his personal physicians, offered him half a million dollars if he could get to Tony's place in the next fifteen minutes to help with Peter. "He okay?" Rhodey asked his friend. He had seen him shaken up, probably more shaken than Peter had been.
"I technically wouldn't have to go in," Mary idly commented, pulling a look from Tony. "I'm his Handler, he's kind of my job."
"I've got him, Peter," Steve said gratefully into the coms. "I've got your Daddy, right here, by my side." Tony's eyes slid over to him. "I'm gonna bring him to you."
"Twins, huh?" Meg nodded. Steve watched them silently, anticipating. He was afraid to make a sound, thinking he was watching two cats meeting for the first time, not wanting to scare them off.
"It's a thicker drink, I was pleasantly surprised," Steve admitted. "Bucky had become a fan of an 'Irish hot chocolate'," Steve said with a chuckle. Tony snorted.
"Says the man with the custom mansion." Mary let out a tiny little sigh. "Thank you, Tony." Tony smiled,
"I live here, and he's my friend," Meg said looking at Bucky. "I'm not keeping it from him when you come here, so get used to it." Bucky's eyes narrowed a little at her, but not in anger. More annoyance. Sometimes he saw that look on Tony's face when directed at Meg. There was some rustling suddenly from the baby monitor on the coffee table, and some soft cries from one of the twins. "Oh look at that, my
“You do know that it doesn’t work like that, right?” Rhodey was raising an eyebrow, Tony was sure of it. He had that tone in his voice. “I can’t make it out there today, but I’ll be there by the end of the week. They’ve cleared me for some of the training that Cap wants to set up.”
Tony pointed at Steve. “We are talking about this later,” he mouthed to Steve, who was trying not to smile.
“So, I’m judging by the lack of nightmares that you’ve done whatever you set out to do?” The engineer asked as he continued to move around the kitchen. He might as well get this over with, and do it while he was marginally more relaxed than last time.
"I feel like you have an unfair advantage," Steve said. "You've been living in this century, help shaped this century, since it started. I've only had a few years with it."
“Coulson’s team rounded up the AIM agents from the parking garage,” Steve said as he took a seat on the edge of the bed by Tony. “They’re not talking, though.”
"Your Daddy loves you so much, and we both will always make sure your safe," Steve told Peter seriously. The little boy reached over for a hug and Steve moved closer. Peter wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, and Tony let the little boy transfer himself to Steve's arms.
"Steven." Said man smirked as he pushed another set of hangars aside in his closet. "Don't make me use your middle name."
Bucky glanced back down at Jamie, and saw that she was looking up at him. He frowned a little. “She likes you Uncle Bucky,” Peter said, not looking away from his homework. “Papa said that she was named after you.”
"Hey, thanks for the easy exit, Gary," Tony shot the man a smile. "I am an equal opportunity lover, and I'll request that no one else give my falsely titled former male lover any more airtime. I'll release my own statement on that in the future, and you all can run it for days on end! Promise, darlings, it'll be worth it in the end." He kissed his hand, blowing a kiss to the crowd before throwing up a peace sign, walking backwards back into the building, the doors closing.
“Don’t torture the little one,” Tony said, his head swooping in over Steve’s shoulder, pressing a kiss to Jamie’s cheek. She giggled some more. “We need to get her into a sugar coma first.”
“I mean,” Tony shrugged a little. “My brain probably knows all of this, knows that I should be slowing down, taking time to myself. I need to make a visit to the Malibu house soon.”
"Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge," Tony said, facing Steve again, and they were suddenly a whole lot closer. "In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide."
“You were very quick to dissolve yourself of anything that happened,” Bucky commented as they walked down to the armory floor.
"Then you need to get your own Peter," Tony said keeping up with Steve. "This one is mine, and I happen to like this Peter very much."
"Surgery can be a long process," Tony tried to explain. He didn't know what was happening, and he was just waiting for an update or phone call himself. "Surgeons sometimes need time to make sure that everything is working just it used, too. They won't let Granma leave until they're positive that she's going to be good as new." Tony tapped down on the panic that was trying to crawl up into his chest. He had no idea what was wrong, didn't even know if the chances were good in her surgery. Steve hadn't look all that optimistic when he had woken up.
"You're going to be so sore if you sleep with him in your arms, like that," Mary told him as she got up to put her mug in the sink. "You can sleep in my room with him, I'll sleep out here."
Peter pushed his lips a little, then moved to push Tony's shirt up, exposing the arc reactor. Tony took a slow breath, letting his son examine it, and touch it. It might always sound weird, but he's trusted Peter with the arc reactor since he was two.
"Uh, you could say that?" Steve glanced up at her, then blinked when he saw a devious looking smile on her face. "What?"
The bullets pinged against the suit annoyingly, the sounds ringing through his ears. "My turn," he said icily, putting up his arms, shooting out flames. Chaos erupted, people running, ammunition and missiles exploding. Tony was going to take out every Stark weapon in this camp. It was when the turret started firing that he felt some resistance in the suit. He had to put up his arm to try and block the bullets, the suit starting to lose some power from his arc reactor.
Tony was bored. Bored and upset. He had been restricted to bed rest for the whole weekend, and he hadn't even been able to sneak away. Every time he tried to get up, to leave and go do something with Peter, or even just make it to the kitchen, he ended up on his knees in a coughing fit and wheezing for breath. Bruce or Steve would come in and help him back into bed, then start a breathing treatment for him. Tony was not happy.
"I will," Tony answered without hesitation. "While I am lucky enough to tend to my son, who was also in the middle of the danger, inside the stability of our own home, I have put into motion several things already. The site of the Stark Expo has already been shifted to hold many displaced citizens, while a search continues to find them reliable and safe shelter, or to return them to their own homes. And, I'll make the official announcement that the Stark Expo will be postponed until everyone person there has been safely housed."
“I picked out a set that Mr Steve and I can work on together,” Peter told him. “Now I need a set that you and I can work on together.”
Tony moved his hands and saw that Steve was holding up his hand, holding a couple items that looked like bracelets, one in red, and one in white. "I don't usually do jewelry there, Cap."
Tony glanced at the map as the in suit phone began to ring; Rhodey. He was pretty much expecting this call. "Hello?" He knew it was Rhodey, but flying this high and this fast, it was still a little hard to hear. "Sorry, hello? Speak up please."
Natasha and Clint were watching the kids in the bouncy house, devoid of all sharp and dangerous weapons. Apparently there was some kind of contest going on, because the kids seemed to be trying to impress the two spies with bouncing acrobatics. Tony really shouldn't have expected anything less from a trained ballerina, and an ex-carnie. Bruce was sitting with Coulson, both enjoying a cup of tea, while Mary chatted with the parents of Peter's friends that had decided to stay.
Tony grabbed a new core from Bruce before taking one of the cars, and the Mark V suitcase, to pick up Peter. Coulson said that he would meet them at Tower after Tony confessed that that was where he was going to take him. The calculations would be done in a couple of hours for the new element, and Bruce promised that he would have a plan drawn up for Tony first thing in the morning. Tony didn't tell him about the Captain America look-a-like. It wasn't the same person that Bruce had been attempting to re-create when he had his own Gamma mishap.
“Actually, I’m going to have to argue that, and say that you’re wrong. You really don’t know the gravity of what’s happening.” Strange looked over at Steve. “We do need to discuss everything that we saw, what we felt. I have a theory about what had stopped me from completing my spell the first time.”
"It's been almost six months." Bruce's eyes widened a little at Tony's words. "I know," he groaned a little, and felt Steve's hand squeeze his a little. "I never remember dates, and here I am, counting months." He wrinkled his nose a little, and Steve chuckled lightly. "Only other ones who know are Peter, and no doubt Wade, Mary and Agent, and her parents. I'm sure Steve told Meg as well, but none of the other Avengers. Wanted to make sure that we weren't going to bite each other's heads off." Bruce raised an eyebrow. He was the master of non-verbal communication with Tony. "Okay, well we still do, obviously, but it's not serious, or anything. Kiss and make up, and move on. It's all very frighteningly domestic, Bruce. We watch Supernatural on date nights!"
“Oh no no,” Tony shook his head, pulling his head up a little. “No cheating, mister. You need someone to show you, first-hand experience.” Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “And you can’t ask Mary, because we had a boy, and she never had to do his hair, not really. She used scissors.” Steve made a face, as if he were hissing at the prospect, and Tony rolled his eyes. “And a video can’t show you the little nuances. I bet that if Natasha weren’t still upset with you because of our own personal Hydra agents, she still wouldn’t be able to show you anything about doing baby hair.”
"But, Agent is his first name," Tony said with complete innocence. He secretly loved doing this with Mary, he had to give her a hard time about Coulson, but they all knew it was in jest. "But, seriously, Agent, good luck meeting the parents tonight. Her Mom is a firecracker."
He ran over to the table, coffee left on one of his work tables, eyes wide. “Eevee! Eevee!” Vee called out, dancing around in her spot.
Mary didn't say anything for a moment. "I'm looking into it, Tony," she said gently. "But, I need you to let me do this without your intervention." Tony was about to shout at her, but she kept going. "So, I'm going to drop Peter off to you, today." Tony stopped, blinking.
"No need to apologize," Steve said before she could try. "As long as you're positive that he's going to be alright."
He shouted when something sharp stuck his wrist from the cuffs around them, electricity shooting through his body again. It only last for a second, but it was enough to send Tony down to his knees, panting for air.
"Aww, did you hear that Tony?" Mary asked sweetly, and Tony turned an incredibly unamused expression to her, barely stopping himself from sighing. "Sleeping in. Something you won't be able to do for a good long time." She grinned at him, entirely all too pleased with herself. "Perhaps he can report to you later just how nice it feels."
The first thing Tony did was put the workshop in lockdown, Jarvis under orders to not disturb him unless it was for Peter. What had he just done? He took Steve to Howard's office, then just, spilled his soul. They had been having fun in the pool room, and yes, he could admit that he had been checking out Steve's ass, and he could have just left it at that.
"Safe travels," he said before they hung up. Tony listened as the music picked up in volume, and he got up, heading for the hallway. Tony was pretty sure he recognized the song, something that was released earlier in the year. Not a slow song, but it was easy listening, something that would probably be on Tony's guilty pleasures playlist. He stepped out and saw Steve standing there, waiting for him. Tony's mouth dropped a little he heard that it was Steve singing with the music.
"Why don't you go get your bookbag, Peter," Steve said before the boy said anything more. Of course, Steve knew what day it was, that's why Mary and Coulson would be gone. He was a little surprised that Tony had volunteered to watch Peter; he would have thought that the man would have his own plans.
"Yes and no." Steve frowned at the non-answer. "Lately, yes, but you'd have to talk to Tony about that one. This stems from childhood issues, and I know you knew his father. I'm not about to get into that, not my story to tell."
Steve still hadn't met the mysterious Tony, but he thought he caught glimpses of him leaving Mary's apartment at night, after dropping Peter off. The man was usually wearing a hat and some sunglasses, always casually dressed. It was easy to tell the difference between him and Mary's boyfriend, Phil. They worked together, and Steve was only a little concerned about inter-office romances. Phil told him that he was the one who had made Mary Steve's Handler, (after asking him to sign his prized collection of Captain America trading cards). He said that it didn't put them in contact all the time, and so it would be harder for work to get between their personal relationship. Steve wouldn't say anything, because he could clearly see that it was working, and the two were able to keep work and life separate.
Steve got up first, then pulled Tony up by one hand and walked with him. “We should spend more time in here.”
"I counted four at the family dinner." Steve gave a tug, and she turned her baby blues back to him. "Come on, let go. Please?"
“I found it,” Steve announced, blowing a raspberry on her cheek. She let out a squeal of laughter, wiggling around. “It’s loud, too.”
Tony took a breath and sat up a little straighter. "If you ever internet search me, I'm gonna prepare you for what you're going to find. I'm sure there are going to be a lot of people who will try to tell you all about me as well, you know, when the press finds out about you. I did not make a lot of friends in my time. And the whole press thing? Your Mama and I thought it would be best if no one outside of our friends and family knew about you, because you're too young to get pestered by nosey assholes. Sorry if it made things worse when the eventual reveal happens. I've got Pepper updating my will to put you and your Mama in it, so, it's eventually going to happen."
"He's going to up looking like Tony's little twin in no time," Mary said as she put Peter down on his feet, slipping the box of snacks from his hands. Peter looked up at her with a pout, until he noticed that Mary was opening the box, pulling out one little pouch and handing it to him. He beamed a grin at her, giving the expected 'Thank You', before ripping into it. "Tony has a business function tonight, and apparently he remembered me saying that Peter needed a haircut soon, so he picked him up on the way."
“At twenty-seven,” Steve pointed out, and he had a look that meant that he was about to shoot Tony’s point into a thousand pieces. “The same age that I am right now.” Tony groaned a little, letting his head drop back onto a pillow. He winced gently, and Steve’s hand was carding through his hair. “So, before you say anything else about wasting my youth, of which I’ll probably have a lot of, just know that I can say everything right back to you.”
It seemed that everyone had taken a cue from Peter, and most were taking naps on the much more comfortable pieces of furniture of Tony's living room. Peter's grandparents had excused themselves back to their guest room, saying they'd be back for dinner and fireworks.
“I will be shaving soon, by the way,” Steve told him, watching the numbers on the elevator. Tony gave him a pout. “It’ll be harder to maintain now that we’re back on active Avengers duty, and I don’t want it to start turning into a hobo beard, and also, with the beard it’ll be a dead giveaway the next time someone gets a picture of Captain America.”
“Captain Rogers is upstairs in his office,” Jarvis informed him. “Shall I inform that you plan to leave?”
"You have a son?" Steve asked, moving closer to a set of pictures that showed the boy as he grew up through the years. He tilted his head in curiosity when he saw a picture of the same boy sitting on the chest of a man, both of them wearing ball caps and t-shirts that had the symbol of his shield on them.
Both Tony and Steve jumped when Tony accidentally dropped the punching bag. "Tony?" Steve asked, panting through his workout.
"Tony, if you can hear me, we're on our way," Steve told him through the comms. "We're only a couple minutes out."
“Don’t you have work to do before we pick up the boys from school?” Steve asked, quickly following him out the door.
I think a lot of people have been waiting for this chapter, and I hope that it's everything they've been waiting for. Inspiration struck for this chapter, and half of the next chapter, and I had to keep it going! Be sure to check the notes at the end as well.
"Then why won't you tell someone about what happened this year?" Mary asked gently, moving a bit closer to his back, but not touching, not yet.
"Sir, Ms Parker left a list, and I scanned it for you," Jarvis spoke up and Tony visibly relaxed, only slightly. "Young Peter currently does not like to eat anything green, but he does like foods with a sauce in the in preparation."
"-really can't thank you enough," Wade's mom was saying to Tony. The geniuses’ hands were in his pockets, a smile on his face as he glanced back over at the boys. "Mr Rogers," she smiled at Steve as he walked over. Steve had met her a couple of times when she had brought Wade over to the apartment building. "Mr Stark said you'd be here, too. Can't help but think that this will be one of the safest places my Wade can be."
“I’m calling this one case suspended,” Tony muttered as he got up from his chair. “Is Brucie in his lab?”
"I think it's called tactical advantage," Steve said, sliding into the passenger seat. Tony glanced in the mirror, looking at Jamie in her car seat. He could easily replace the bags next to her with Peter, seeing in his mind the way he'd probably be talking about his latest art project with Steve, or asking Tony if he could go down to the workshop to see the bots. He shook his head a little, clearing away the thoughts, and started the car. "I have to be prepared for every possibility." Steve was still talking, the cheating smirk on his face.
“Hey, Petey-pie,” he called out, looking at the little boy standing in the doorway. “Did you have a bad dream?” Peter nodded and Tony shifted a little and put out an arm. Peter ran over to the bed, letting Tony wrap an arm around his waist to help him up. He crawled over Tony to settle in between him and Steve, snuggling down into the blankets, stuffed animals securely tucked into his arms.
“Hopefully it does the same for you,” Mary told him. “Yeah, he’s got a lot people after him because of what he knows, but you’re taking on the protection detail. For all of them. And I know a number of those people who wouldn’t complain if they were able to get their hands on you.”
“Tony-“ He shushed her and took a step closer to the living room. There were two heads sitting on the couch. He recognized them both.
“I like the cream they use here,” Steve said, grabbing his spoon to start siphoning more whip cream off the stop. He raised an amused eyebrow when Tony placed the stem on top of the spoon. “They make it themselves, old fashioned like.”
Tony shook his head and pulled out the chair with Peter's booster seat. He was smaller than other six-year olds, just like Tony had been, but he was almost done with the booster seat. Peter climbed up into the chair and Tony pushed it back in, taking a seat next to him, Steve sitting across from them. Tony bit back the little smile he felt twitching at his lips, and instead took a big bite of his food. He should not feel this okay with such a domestic scene. It was just the stress of the past week, and the fact that he hadn't really slept. That was it.
“Tony,” Bruce said softly, almost as if he were chastising him. Steve's brow furrowed, and he was looking at Tony for answers.
Nevermind. As if on cue, Steve straightened his legs, back arching as he started to wake up. The man had an internal clock that was impeccable. When Steve rolled towards his edge of the bed, Tony was able to pull his other arm back that had been under Steve's shoulders. He sat up, hoping to make it at least look like he hadn't been there all night-
"I like blue," Peter said, running his fingers around the outside, tracing the circle. "Mama say bad people hurt you." Tony blinked a little. He wondered just how much him being gone had affected Peter. "That they took you."
"Are you kidding me? You want to send me right into the fray?" "She's a civilian, you can't possibly being thinking about doing that!" "I'm not getting involved in this shit fest! I want to get Out of it, in fact!" "This is far beyond anything that we could have imagined as it is, and all of the Avengers are-"
“I told you before, I don’t care. I’m not ashamed of being Bi, and I’m not ashamed to be seen dating you.” Steve turned his attention to Tony, holding onto his hand. “They can say whatever they want about me, because I know how I feel, and as long I know that you’re happy, then I’m happy. Whatever they print about us, we know the truth of how we feel, of our family, and we’ll work with the kids on the press as they grow older.” Tony let out a little sigh, nodding his head, and Steve brought his hand up to kiss his knuckles. “I love you.”
“There’s a lot of glass,” Steve commented, arm around Peter until they stopped, to keep him from falling.
"When I want something bad enough." Tony leaned his head forward, but Steve twisted his head, foreheads still together. "We aren't in the gym."
"No," Mary said and Steve blinked. He had been ready for excuses right away, not the straight look and confident denial. "I was wondering how long until you would figure it out, but no." She shook her head. "It wasn't pertinent to the information that you would need after waking up, or working for SHIELD."
Sorry for the delay! I wrote an update on Tumblr, (it's like my own status log), and I wasn't done with the chapter because I was making this bone achingly sweet. I mean, I wanted to get this Perfect. I had a crazy weekend, and my buffer of chapters had ended sooner than I though, but this needed some fine tuning. Also, PART OF MY TOOTH FELL OFF inside my mouth. Like, it just broke away, so like, half of my tooth is missing, while the other part is just hanging out in my mouth, all jagged edges and what not. That'll throw a kink in your day.
“You can’t just walk in here with three people that the Avengers are looking for,” Steve said to Strange, but didn’t take his eyes off of the twins, or Loki. “I can’t be certain if Jarvis has alerted the others yet, or if he will soon, but I’m not going to call him off.”
"I think I caught sight of our assassin," Tony said quietly and Steve frowned. His hands tightened around Tony's. "Not in New York. Following you." That wasn't what Steve had been expecting to hear. Tony slid one of his hands away to grab his phone from his pocket, tapping the screen twice and a hologram was projected. Steve looked at them, and he saw traffic cams pictures of him walking with Meg down the street yesterday When Tony moved his hand, multiple images appeared, and he saw the same person following them, dark clothes, black ball cap.
George raised an interested eyebrow at Tony. "Lowering your standards, Stark?" Tony growled slapped a hand on George's back, fingers splayed to look friendly, but fingers digging in a little.
Tony tried not to roll his eyes, with a smile, when the tall malt glass was placed on the counter, two long straws in it. He locked eyes with amused blue ones across from him, letting Steve reach for the glass first, going for the cherry on top. “If you take that cherry, I will use my Italian leather shoes to ensure that the night ends with dinner.” Steve tried to give him a pout, but Tony just hardened his gaze and stole the cherry by the stem from between Steve’s fingers. The blonde shot him a smile then used his finger to steal a large dollop of whip cream from the top. “You didn’t!”
"You two can't do experiments while pregnant," Steve said to both of them as they walked down the hall. "I should haven't to tell you that."
“Get something over her mouth,” Bucky said before moving further into the room. “She’s still under, and-“
Tony put all available power into the thrusters, already taking off another two minutes of his flight time. "Tony, you should head to DC, I can find people in Baltimore," Mary told him over the comms.
He had to admire Steve’s figure though, and the dashing look he cut with his khaki’s, blue button up, and black sport jacket. “Come on, baby girl,” Steve cooed. “It’s just for a night, and you’ll be asleep for most of the night anyway.” Jamie pressed her face to Steve’s neck, and blue eyes caught Tony’s, asking for help. Tony chuckled silently and walked over to them. He kissed Steve lightly then rubbed Jamie’s back.
"I'm exhausted," Tony told him. "But, honestly? I'm probably not going to sleep for a while. I probably should have checked on how much coffee I had left here, I know I had already moved some to the Tower. Not the point, I'm sure I still have enough here to stay up, I can get a lot done."
Tony tapped his fingers on the counter, watching Bruce at the stove. Peter and his grandparents were at a water park for the day, the heat not so bad on the July day. Tony hadn't actually paid attention to the weather though while working in his workshop, he had overheated one of the main servers. Now he had to wait for the Tower to cool down, (Jarvis was blasting the AC around the workshop), and wait for the power to be restored to that section on its own. He was bored.
“Semantics- oph!” Tony stumbled forward when Peter hurried his pace, catching sight of the characters from Tangled. “It’s almost like he’s excited!”
"Okay," Tony nodded, running a hand through his hair. "Coulson said that they have teams out there looking for the objects that Hydra took from SHIELD, and looking for Strucker. Jarvis will keep an eye on that, send us locations as well."
“I’m going to be sick,” Bucky said, putting the back of his hand to his mouth. “Let’s get out of here before you two start, kissing, or something.”
"Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but there is something that I believe would be in your best interest to see." Jarvis's voice rang in the hallway and Tony almost thanked him for distraction. Tony reached in his pocket for his phone when it buzzed with whatever Jarvis had found. There was a news clip and Tony brought it up full screen, turning the sound on.
"Not first name rights," Steve informed him, and Tony scoffed. "Conor Anthony, and Rowan Stephanie." Tony's eyes opened a bit wider.
William and Rachel walked off with Peter, and Tony let out a big breath. He gathered the plate and two cups, taking them over to the sink. He turned, catching Steve and Bruce's eyes, before pointing between them. "The only thing that's going to happen is that someone is going to make blueberry pancakes. That's it." The two men blinked at him. "Peter expects it, but I don't want a party, I don't want a celebration. My birthday is not worth celebrating, not this year."
"No," Bucky spoke up and Steve whipped his head around. Meg was already getting up to try and stop what they knew Bucky was going to say. "He wanted to hurt your mom." Meg slumped against Bucky's back, hitting his shoulder with her fist. She muttered something that made Bucky frown, not understanding. Steve turned back to look at Wade.
Steve didn’t drop his shield until he entered the sitting room where Tony and Strange were. Strange was on his feet, hands out on either side of Tony’s head. Tony, who was unconscious, and floating in the air above the floor. Steve moved towards him, but was stopped by Loki’s hand on his arm. “I wouldn’t disturb the Doctor.”
Tony growled and opened his eyes and pushed himself back up. Apparently that applied to all Stark's but him. In what world did he think that he had a chance to have his own happy ending? He had ruined that shot when he became, embraced, his title as Merchant of Death. He should have gotten the hint when Stane had tried to kill me, not once, not twice, but at least three times. He wasn't a hero.
"Come over here!" Peter ran over to the middle cases, waving for Steve to follow him. He noted that not all of the room was full, but there were spaces for specific items. Looking inside the first case he saw an old map of Germany, then saw his handwriting on the map. Other maps had Bucky's handwriting, and Dum-Dum's, even Gabe's. These were the maps that they had used in the war.
"When were these taken?" He felt his ire rising. His weapons, the weapons that he had halted production of.
“To the press release, right,” he nodded a little. Looking over, Steve gave him a smile and went back to following Peter, listening to him go on about whatever Lego set he was currently interested in. “What’s the damage?”
“I have to make the same amount for Steve and Bucky alone, that I made for eight people,” Mary whined a bit. “I am not thrilled with super soldier appetites.”
Having Peter in his life had changed Tony, there was no doubt about that. Even before Afghanistan happened, before Iron Man, Tony had started changing, for the better. Maybe, if Tony really got dug deep down, he could admit that it wouldn't be so terrible to actually have a family, with maybe another kid. Not that that would be happening anytime soon. He couldn't even promise to keep Peter safe, much less another kid. And technically, he was a single parent. Yeah, Mary was there to do most of the work, and sometimes Tony felt horrible that he couldn't do more, but Mary was dating Coulson, and Tony was single.
"I will talk to the school." Mary stopped him. "It'll be all over the news if even one of those secretaries recognizes you."
"I'm gonna try and get the rest of these cars away from the device," Tony said over the comms, flying over first the cars that had been abandoned, trying to avoid the fight still going on. "The disruptor is stealing energy from anything that crosses into it. If it gets too powerful-"
“It turns out that I can’t do that, though,” Phil closed the file, but kept his hand inside the cover. “It was a paperwork nightmare getting you transferred to Tony’s care, because he’s technically not next of kin, and of course Peter is too young.” Mary hummed, nodding, wondering along with Steve where this was going. “I thought to myself, I know how to take care of this, and really, it’s just been long overdue.” Coulson swiveled a bit, slid off the bed and down to the ground. On one knee. Holding up a ring. “Mary, will you let me be the one to fill out your paperwork, and take care of you, for the rest of your life, as my wife?”
Wade leaned in to whisper to Peter's ear, and Tony frowned when he caught bits of words, but it wasn't in English. Wasn't a language that Tony could recognize at all. Peter wrinkled his nose and looked at Wade, the two of them having a conversation with their eyes now. Tony glanced over at Steve who had only raised an eyebrow. Jamie was trying to reach out now, because Peter wasn't looking at her anymore.
As soon as the suit opened Tony was up and swinging fists. He caught the younger man that he recognized in the jaw, and turned on his foot to bring a roundhouse kick to the next guy. Tony was startled when a bullet just missed his head, sinking into the car that was behind him, and it was enough of a pause to let two bigger guys slam him back into the vehicle. He gasped, clenching his jaw, when someone slammed a tazer into his stomach.
"Brucie-bear!" Tony grinned, running over to the man, hugging him, making the man uncomfortable with all the stuff he was still holding. "You've let your hair grow out, I like it."
“What about,” Steve grunted as he jumped to block a shot, knocking it away towards Bucky, “Papa?” Bucky missed the ball as Sam shot forward.
"I want you to repeat that to Peter someday," Tony said. "I want him to prepare for Middle School and High School classes. If he goes in with that attitude, maybe there won't be so much whining about homework."
“Well, I don’t know,” Wade answered first. “She seems interested in the pancakes, but we don’t know if she understands that they’re special.”
"I'm glad that you're able to learn this lesson for one night," Bruce whispered, and Tony wished he were closer so he could elbow him.
“Now that I don’t believe,” Steve said. “I know you have more control than that. And Tony has been wanting to upgrade it anyway, so let him do that and I’ll bet you have even more control over it.” Bucky sighed and looked like he was about to turn him down, again, but Steve brought in the big guns. “He said Air Force was better than Army.”
birthday, and the pillow that looked like the classic shield that Ana had hand-sewn. This was the real stuff, the stuff that didn’t go down with the Captain on his last mission.
Wade looked up at Tony, smiling, and he just knew that something funny, and probably inappropriate for a nine-year-old was going to come out of his mouth. "Did you know she's got two babies in there? You'd think she'd have to be bigger, make more room. They're probably pretty cramped in there."
“I gotta agree with Tony on this one,” Rhodey threw in, making Tony grin. “That’s sounding dangerous close to Captain America talk. Peter is very insistent that no one does any type of work on their birthdays.” Tony pointed up, to the speakers, as if Rhodes were proving his point. “How is the little munchkin, anyway?”
"You'll have to think of a name," Tony said quietly after a few moments. "We'll, ah, get a room put together, too, at least pick up a crib on the way, she'll need somewhere to sleep."
"I'll have you know that it's one of my favorites," Tony said, leaning back in the chair that Peter had assigned to him. "And I am not the first one to show him the movies. That was all Mary."
"Now, slam all your weight into it!" Tony saw the door fly forward, slamming into the first woman and knocked her off of her feet, and into her companion, both landing on the floor. "Run!" Meg appeared on camera, jumping over the first woman, attempting to get past the second, when a hand went out, grabbing her ankle. Tony heard her gasp in surprise and watched her hit the floor, putting her hands out to try and catch herself, and saw the phone slide across the floor. She screamed for help and Jarvis gathered another camera feed to show others heading towards the bathrooms. Meg kept screaming, kicking back at her attackers, while a crowd gathered.
"There we go, you're looking better already," Steve said, giving him an encouraging smile. There was something else in his eyes. "Can I put this on?" He asked, pulling forward a clear oxygen mask. "Just for a little bit, I'll stay right here with you. It's going to help." Tony watched him carefully, calculating. Steve wouldn't doing anything to hurt him, right? He cared about him, he cared about Peter, too. Tony nodded once and Steve slowly, carefully, slipped the mask over Tony's face.
Steve grabbed a big towel and put it in his lap and over his legs. "Let's get you sitting up a little more." Tony let his hands move him a little, always keeping his hands in view. "I'm gonna sit you up, leaning against me. Bruce says it'll help with the breathing." Tony moved his eyes around, looking for his other friend, but it was just Tony and Steve now. He moved with Steve's hands, until several minutes later Tony was leaning against Steve, shoulder to chest.
"I am an engineer by trait," he replied, turning back to his work, Jarvis throwing the call to the workshop speakers.
“Thinking about things that we probably wouldn’t like,” Steve continued, watching Tony’s fingers. “He asked about what’s going to happen after Julie dies.” Tony almost faltered in his playing, the song losing the tempo for a second.
"Captain Rogers," Jarvis interrupted suddenly. "I must insist that you immediately make your way to the Seventy-Eighth floor." Bruce and Steve exchanged looks. Then Steve's eyes widened. That was the floor Julie and Wade lived on.
“Once I found out where she came in, I checked old videos, and saw that someone came to pick her up. A nice black car with plates that trace back to the Colonel.” Tony huffed out a breath. “I don’t wanna tell Bucky or Meg yet, because we might see our new seasonal friend, and he might take another trip down to DC.”
"I love you, Tony Stark." Steve moved forward, sliding his hand across Tony's arms. "I am in love with you."
“Well, not something I exactly advertise, but I do. Sometimes a quick phone call helps.” Steve leaned his cheek on top of Tony’s head. “Not saying that it’s easy, not at all. I guess,” Steve paused for a moment, trying to gather the words. “I’m getting better at hiding it, when things get too much, especially around those that don’t know, or the kids particularly. Then I go punch something.” Tony’s body jerked slightly with a snort and Steve pressed a kiss into his hair.
Tony reluctantly sat back down. “I told Steve where I was going before I left, so if something happens to me, he knows where to start kicking in doors at.” Tony heard Loki’s soft snort, but he obviously wasn’t blowing off the threat. Strange waved his hand over Tony’s eyes, and Tony closed them. He felt fingers tap at the insides of his wrists, then move up to tap at his shoulders, then finally settle on his temples. He took a deep breath, trying to relax into the chair.
"It wasn't nearly as good as its replacement," Tony answered back with a smile. "And people will be able to see it when they get off the elevator, so bonus." Steve smiled and leaned in to kiss him again. When Tony's hand reached for his pocket, he could sense Tony's nervousness. "I, ah, I have a present for you, too, but I don't think it's anywhere near as nice."
The infamous Pepper Potts had one of the best memories in the business. "You came with the baby, claiming that Tony was the father." Mary just nodded once, and Pepper narrowed her eyes a little. "Was it all some sort of set-up to try and get Tony under government surveillance?"
“Says the man who announced to the world that he was no longer single, by being in costume,” Mary informed him. “I think your reasons hold no water.”
"It is a Judge of sorts,” Thor started to explain. ”One that can come and see the truth from anyone. I do believe that there are a couple that are still here on Midgard."
"Little man is in charge of this shindig, apparently," was all that Tony offered. Steve chuckled a little and took his seat next to Tony. Mary shot him a knowing smile, and Steve wiggled the fingers on his left hand. He told her that he had no issue with them announcing their engagement on his birthday, but they insisted on waiting until the next day. Steve was now threatening to reveal their happy news.
Pepper gasped and moved closer as she looked at the eggs. “Are they going to hatch?” She asked with big eyes. Tony nodded, holding onto Vee in his arms now. She climbed up to his shoulder to perch, preening happily. Her and Tony had raised these eggs, and now it was all paying off. “I’ve never seen colors like that before.”
Tony felt himself being moved to his back, gently. Steve. But he was gone, on a mission, wasn't back yet. Again, there was the pressure at his arms, trying to bring them away from his face. "Let me take a look at your injuries." Injuries? He could trust Steve. Steve wouldn't hurt him. Tony let his arms be brought down, away from his face, but he body was still tensed, ready to defend, to strike. "Open your eyes for me, Tony." He jerked when he felt a warm touch by his eyes. "Yeah, there's a nasty burn there, I wanna make sure it didn't do any other damage. You can do this, Tony, I know you can."
“-but it would appear that things are happening that I have been unable to explain,” Tony continued, trying to ignore Strange’s comment. His hands came back out of his pockets, and he rubbed them together, a bit nervously. Strange took a couple steps closer, head tilted as he observed Tony.
"No, I said I do." She looked around the room, trying to spot the blonde. There weren't that many people there, it shouldn't be that hard to find him.
“Yes, actually,” Steve responded. “You were cuddling with me on the couch after a too-near death experience. Then we watched Supernatural.”
“No I’m not!” Peter gasped and wiggled in Tony’s arms. Tony tightened his grasp around him, flopping back onto the couch and dragging Peter with him. “Nooooo!” He squealed with laughter as Tony tried to tickle his sides. “Daddy!”
"What has her worked up this time?" Tony asked quickly, rounding the corner from the hallway and seeing Rachel reach for the front door. "Rachel! Hey!" She ignored him, a determined look of anger on her face, and yanked the front door open. Tony sprinted forward, trying to catch her before she got too far out, and the press started to get too interested.
"You're babysitting all the time now, I hope you know that." Tony rubbed Peter's head as he got up from the floor.
"Daddy!" Tony looked at Peter when he shouted for him, throwing his arms out towards Tony. Tony felt his lip wobble a little and took a big step closer to sweep Peter into his arms, holding him close to him. He felt little shakes in Peter's body, and then he heard the quiet cries. "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy," Peter chanted quietly, his face against Tony's neck.
Tomorrow Tony had plans to get back to the Tower, make sure that everyone would have a room there, starting with Peter's room, Mary's room, and a room for Coulson. He had finished those designs first, then started on guest floors. And between just him and Jarvis, he had floors for each Avenger. The inspectors had gone through the Tower a couple days ago, and it was structurally sound, and all his permits were still active. Tony hoped that when Thor finally took Loki back to wherever, he'd be able to at least have guest rooms prepared.
"His Granma is out of surgery," Tony whispered to him. "They'll know more in the morning, but she's stable." Wade nodded, then closed his eyes again, trying to go back to sleep. Tony watched both boys for a couple more moments before he left the bedroom, leaving the door open just a crack.
"Most of my ideas start off that way," Tony said while waving his arm. The TV turned on and the two Super Soldiers walked away. Tony then looked over at Meg and wiggled his fingers. "Come over here. They aren't the only ones who can be grown-ups."
"Well, all that is something that the adults will have to decide on their own," Tony said to his excited son. "Wade's mom still has a job around here, and Grandma and Granpa have responsibilities in California. So don't be too upset if they say they can't do it, alright?" Peter nodded, giving him his best grown-up look.
“I love you, too,” Steve responded, his lips pressing to Tony’s forehead. Bruce had moved from the couch, and was piling the pillows in one place for Tony. Steve acted his pillow, not letting go of Tony.
Steve nudged Tony’s leg with his knee a little. “I had to know what I was capable of, specially if I was going to be around Peter. I didn’t want to accidentally hurt him, or Mary, or anyone really. After I moved in here, to the Tower, I asked Jarvis if he could help me, too. It’s actually been a lot better working with him than at SHIELD.” Tony snorted a little. Steve licked his lips, glancing down before meeting Tony’s eyes. “I’m afraid that if I’m not actively aware, that I might accidentally hurt Jamie…. She’s still so small, so young, and I don’t want to do that. I’d never forgive myself if it was something I could have prevented.” Tony reached out to brush some hair from his forehead, gently brushing his fingers across Steve’s skin.
"That's really the only condition that I put in the contract," Tony said, his voice lighter now, a bit of the show Tony coming out. He couldn't stop himself sometimes, Tony didn't like to do emotions. "Legal said I couldn't keep the part about Justin Hammer in there, but I thought I'd tell you."
“Ice cweam?” Tony looked down to see a sleepy Jamie looking up at him with sparkling eyes. Tony snorted with a smile.
"Most people won't believe that it's actually him, and he won't actually have to deal with that much if he decides to ignore the media," Natasha threw back.
“Well, I was going to start filling these in for you,” Phil started, flipping through a couple of pages.
"The Expo, the whole thing, it's, it's the answer." Tony tried to explain, sitting back in the chair. "It's like, it's science!"
Tony slide the vase onto the table, then threw his arms around Steve's neck, melting into his embrace. "I missed you, too." He drew a hand back and punched Steve's shoulder with a fist, but didn't move his head from resting on Steve's chest. Steve started to move them then, carefully without making either one have to part, and Steve went down on the couch with Tony wrapped in his arms.
And because I realize I forgot to post it last chapter, and some people have asked, the song from last chapter was "I Wont' Give Up" by Jason Mraz. I had an awesome roommate who adored Jason Mraz, so I guess I just everyone assumed knew what the song was. Heheh, my bad. :D
"I haven't actually thrown up in like, two weeks, please don't break that streak," Meg said from her spot on the couch, checking her phone.
The ‘ding’ of a new message brought Tony’s eyes from his computer monitor, from his new coding project, to his phone. He grunted a little at the sender’s name then pushed himself up from his chair. Really, he had put this off for too long.
"Yeah, and I like having at least one real arm, thank you very much." Steve snorted softly. "Gotta try and come to terms with what I did though. You don't have to say it, cause she says it all the time, I know it wasn't really me. It's hard though, cause I remember missions sometimes, all of them. Those were my hands pulling the triggers, getting rid of people, and I couldn't stop myself."
"I'm Pepper Potts, and I've heard a lot about you," she introduced, not letting Steve get a word in. "And you'll be staying the background with me."
"I'm already dying, no need to add a heart-attack to it!" Tony leaned back next to Steve. "Peter's upstairs."
"Like Peter said, it's all yours," Tony said softly. Steve licked his lips, feeling his heart fluttering in his chest, and reached in, gently picking up the tags.
“Did Peter notice the difference?” Mary asked. She had also noticed that Peter picked up on the arc reactor in a strange, but not negative, way.
“Papa! Uncle Bucky!” Peter ran over to them, barely holding onto his bag, eyes wide. Bucky knelt down to intercept the boy. “Uncle Bucky, that woman was back. Sarah? The one that Wade didn’t like.” Bucky’s head jerked up to Steve. “She took him out of class.”
"It's a shit excuse, and you know it." Tony jumped at the voice behind him, nearly falling out of the chair, and turned around to glare at the intruder. The red-headed assassin gave him a little smirk. "You have to remember that you aren't the only ones who wake up in the middle of the night as well," she told him.
“I know, I for one would go on a murder spree if there was a threat to Peter, and I know that you would do the same for Jamie.” Tony leaned back into the couch, throwing his legs up to rest in Steve’s lap. “I bet as soon as Buckster-“ he could feel the glare from Bucky, “-took her into the nursery, she calmed right down. With that knowledge, I’m feeling a bit better about this situation, and we have a more solid idea of where to go from here, and bump this down on the list of things that will threaten our lives.”
Also, I cannot stress enough, that I am NOT in any way a mental health expert. There are many resources available, and I urge that if anyone feels the need to talk to anyone, or seek anything to do so. It's very important to take care of yourself, mentally and physically. I love you all. <3
"Then I'll get him a paint set, or a shadow with an executive chef," Tony answered simply. "But, until he's old enough to start to figure that out, I'm going to cultivate the genius brewing inside of him."
"That usually wouldn't be too bad," Steve continued like Tony hadn't tried to stop him. "Dreaming of a recent battle or mission is normal. But I'm throwing a punch, I'm turning to throw the shield, and when I turn around I'm on a train." He let out a breath and looked up, unintentionally meeting Tony's eyes, but found he couldn't look away. "I'm going for my shield, and it's Bucky who's holding it.... And then he's falling, again. I can't stop it, I can never stop it."
And then, it was like Steve said, only, less catastrophic. One of Tony's walls broke, slowly crumbling, and Tony found himself crying into the safe place that Steve presented him with. Maybe he could do it, could talk to Steve. It would be easier now, after Steve's own confession, because maybe he would actually be able to understand where Tony was coming from. He didn't need a kindred spirit, but, then again, maybe it would help. His crying turned into soft sobs, but Steve never let go, and Tony knew, (when this was all done), he'd need to think of a way to repay Steve's kindness. He wanted, too.
"You see, Todd, Mr Stark has taken on the mantle of fatherhood again." Mary leaned on the desk, smiling at the guard. She enjoyed the man because he always greeted Peter, and watched out for him and Wade when they were playing the Tower. "He's the proud father of a second child, a little girl."
"Good night, Obie," Tony called, dismissing himself from the conversation, and dismissing Obie. He completely forgot about the stuffed animal, and how it would have been visible if you were heading towards the couch.
"But I can't multi-task talking on the phone and doing something else, that would be seen as rude. You want me to appear to be a rude person?" Tony put a hand on his chest, eyes wide. “Bruce, I thought you liked me! Why are you trying to turn me into a horrible person??" Tony tried not to smile when he heard the soft giggles from Peter. Even his son was used to his exaggerated dramatics. The difference between his reaction, and the look that Bruce was giving him, was that Peter still found his Daddy amusing. Bruce wasn't falling for it.
"I'm afraid I can't right now, Sir," Jarvis told his creator. "I'm afraid that the calculations for the new scanners have not been completed."
Tony worked his jaw in a circle a couple of times, staring off at the wall. "What are you going to tell Peter?" He asked in a blank tone that had unease prickling at the back of Steve's head. "You're going to be gone for a long time."
"Gotcha, gotcha," Tony nodded, cutting off his AI. "Alright, so let's bring up some recipes with chicken, and sauce. Any allergies?"
“So, how much do you want?” Tony asked after a second, sitting on the edge of the chair. Mary blinked then tilted her head a little. “We usually like to keep things like this out of the media, and I don’t think you want the attention, since you came to me first. So, I’m just wondering-“
"Remember, gyms are like Vegas," Tony said, opening his eyes a little to look at him. "What happens here, stays here?" He started to lean back up, but Steve put a hand on his arm. "Why do you have to question so many things?"
Mary dropped her bag and coat and flung herself into his path at the last second, putting her hands on his chest when he grabbed her, picking her up instead of trampling her, catching him by surprise. "Captain Rogers, stop!" She called out in the most authoritative, and mom sounding, voice she had. His feet halted on military instinct and he looked at her, setting her back on her feet, ready to bolt again. Mary signaled for the other Agents to stop where they were, never taking her eyes off of Steve Rogers.
"Which choice is that?" Steve asked. He knew it wasn't the same choices they had discussed in the car, and he had an inkling, but he just wanted to know.
"Aren't we just lucky." Tony rolled his eyes before twisting his body to fall in Steve's lap. "They had better have the streets cleared tomorrow, I'm cheating and we're getting pancakes for breakfast. And you are never going to tell Peter about it."
Tony brought the pages up in front of him, blue glow of the hologram in front of him, eyes skimming over all the words at once. He was barely aware of the door opening behind him when he realized what he was looking at. Tony's mouth dropped open and his eyes widened, shock and anger coursing through him.
Tony hummed, nodded a little. One of the downsides to trying to keep Mary and Peter from the public eye, was that he couldn't actually make their own traditions on holidays. He knew that Mary would never do it on purpose, would never keep him from spending time with Peter on the big days of the year, but he would always have to take the backseat to celebrations. Tony didn't take it personally, it was something he had learned to deal with from a young age, most of his best memories were of holidays spent with his butler Jarvis.
“Tony.” A familiar voice sounded nearby. “Tony, it’s nearly three in the morning, it’s June first, and you’re in Malibu, you’re in your mansion by the water. We just got back from Disneyland, Jamie is sleeping next door with Jarvis monitoring her, and Peter is just across the hall. They’re both safe and asleep.”
"Ballsy son of a bitch," Meg muttered under her breath. She looked about as tired as Steve felt. He felt a little bad, she looked much older than when Steve had met almost a year ago, and part of that felt his fault.
“It’s like your old workshop!” Peter smiled then reached out to take the box. “I like it.” Tony chuckled and kissed his cheek, standing back up. “Alright kiddo, we’ve got some dinner reservations to get too, then the next Star Wars movie.” Peter straightened up and turned to hustle towards the checkout, making Tony laugh.
"As soon as we know something, you'll know something, promise." Steve told her, pulling a pillow from the couch and shoving it under his neck
“Would have been better if it wasn’t going to be twisted by every media outlet tomorrow.” Tony had purposely scheduled their flight on the one year date of the ‘Battle of New York.’ There had been dozens of invitations for the Avengers to come to some memorial event or another, for Tony to talk, no doubt about taking the missile through the wormhole, or for Captain America to speak. Everyone had wanted to know Captain America’s identity, and then after the Hydra/SHIELD dump speculation was running wild.
"'Cause you're a superhero," Peter answered happily. He could see the blue glow from the tesseract now, could see his Tower. He was getting closer. Too close.
“You can’t sleep one day a week,” Mary told him sternly. “And it’s not sleeping if you pass out from exhaustion.”
“You are the master of paperwork, hun,” Mary nodded, eventually just resting her chin on his shoulder.
"And you said that we would all be doomed," Steve recited, remembering their talk at Mary and Coulson's wedding. "She would be just like me, and that's not even worrying about when she's old enough to date."
Steve didn’t sleep again, sitting next to Tony, keeping watch over him, but he didn’t let Jamie sleep in her room again, along with Peter and Wade. They’d go back down to Mary’s floor after they woke up, keep up on their school lessons that Jarvis, and Tony, had put together for them. The boys were starting to get anxious, knowing that a birthday party was coming soon.
Steve watched Tony from just outside the living room, saw him reading through something on his tablet, but he knew that he was going through Howard’s journals again. Mary slid up behind him, and he turned his head back a little. “Told Tony yet?” She asked, leaning across from him.
“You’re wearing glasses,” Steve observed as he set the tray down on a clear (enough) table. Tony leaned in for a quick kiss, then planted a kiss on Jamie’s nose. “When did you get glasses?”
Tony turned his head a little, leaning up to kiss Steve's cheek. "Let me work my magic, babycakes." Tony could feel Bruce's eyes roll at the pet name. "Jarvis is already working on the next file, and Bruce's machines are still running possible compounds. Nothing much we can do now until we get more information."
"There was no internal, or external, tampering that I can detect, Mrs Parker," Jarvis supplied from the tablet. "There is one full second of footage that is unaccounted for. As if it never existed in the first place." If it was possible for an AI to be distressed about something, that would be Jarvis over the missing one second.
"Not nearly as long last time though," he said, thumb rubbing her cheek a little, before patting her back. "We're going to need a few things for Steve's floor, I understand that it might be on your floor at the moment."
"He likes to eat," Peter said, his hands going to find Tony's arc reactor out of habit. "Usually stuff like tacos, but he likes sweets, too. And he's really funny."
"I think I know exactly what you're thinking. Great idea, I'll make some popcorn." Bruce raised an eyebrow at Tony. "We have to see how the Winchester boys stop the Devil." Steve grinned.
Steve was glad that he decided to not wear his uniform into the school, looking at the number of parents and staff still around, but he knew he was getting more than a few looks when he hopped on his motorcycle, the shield secured on the front. He didn’t have time to worry about it, not when he needed to find Wade, get him away from his father.
Pepper looked down at her phone, typing out something before looking back up at him. "Well, I didn't actually think I'd see it, a sober birthday." She gave him a little smile and now Tony was raising his eyebrow. "Although, your sudden aversion to peanuts? Was it actually because of a peanut allergy?"
Alright guys, here's how much I love you all. I'm still laying down in bed, Tony Kitty tucked next to my head, (I also have a Bucky Wolf, and Steve the Unicorn, they're on my Tumblr page), and I literally just woke up. I was moved by the comments yesterday, (and maybe frightened by a few of them ;P), and I couldn't leave you guys hanging till Tuesday. Although, your pain gave me glee...... Evil and good, see, there's a whole dichotomy.
"I'm sorry about the mess," Mary called out as she walked into a room off of the living room. He edged forward to peek in, noticing that it was set up as a study. There were a couple of bookcases, some metal file cabinets, and a large desk with a leather chair on wheels. There was what looked like a TV screen on the desk as well with a smaller typing keyboard in front of it.
Hello lovely people! This chapter was finished about five minutes before it was posted, because all the characters in here decided to hijack it and turn it into nothing that I had planned. Good news is the name of this chapter though!
"They're pretty much inseparable." Tony smirked a little happily, watching them. They watched as Wade moved to the swing next to Peter, pushing the empty seat until he got it to flip over the bars several times, making the swing higher up. He was taller than Peter by at least four inches. He hopped up on the swing, Peter watching him while he pumped his legs, keeping his own momentum. Wade worked his legs, too, getting higher and higher, until he started to slide back on the seat. He suddenly flipped upside down, wrapping his legs around the chains, and using his arms to keep up the momentum. He grinned over at Peter, and Peter laughed loudly.
“We’re getting into an area I don’t need to know anything about,” Bucky said with a slight grimace. Steve stepped behind Bucky to quickly pull on the clothes, and towel dry his hair enough.
His head snapped up when heard the giggle of baby and he looked over to see Steve walking back towards the table. His face was glowing, and Jamie was laughing, making the most noise they'd heard in the past two days. "What did you do??" Tony asked as he slid out from his seat to meet them.
There was a soft gasp behind Howard, and both Starks looked back to see Peggy Carter standing in the doorway. Her eyes were on the Eevee that was standing next to Tony. “Evelyn?” Eevee chirped loudly and ran over to Peggy, who practically dropped to her knees. Eevee danced around her a little, looking around as well. Surely where there was Peggy, there was Captain America. “Look at your girl, still looking the same.”
"Everything okay?" Steve asked. There really was no use in trying to explain to Wade, again, why he shouldn't hover over someone while they slept.
"Alright, after this, I'm putting you on a one week paid vacation,' Tony told him. "I'll call Happy, set it up. This is a long double shift you just pulled, and I know you were looking forward to sleeping in."
"I can confirm that Miss Romanoff and Mr Barton are still at the SHIELD offices," Jarvis threw in for him.
"Yes, there are lots of pancakes," Tony said, sipping his coffee with a smirk. "Good to see you Legolas."
“Evil.” Steve muttered with a smile and grabbed the clothes. “I’m not shaving though. I will not be mistaken for the actor out there.”
"Think he broke my nose," Tony rasped out. "Probably some bruised ribs." He didn't mention that his new gauntlet was dented in and digging painfully into his hand, but it wasn't drawing blood, so it wasn't that important.
"I'm technically on the job, but I'll take a water," Mary chuckled a little, letting Tony move towards the bar faster. Tony barely noticed Coulson intercept Mary as he went up to the bar, placing a drink order. He didn't even notice the blonde come up on the other side.
"Aye, it seems that my brother is still able to control a minor part of his illusions," Thor admitted with a nod. "I can report that they are unable to do anything other than possibly annoy."
“Unfortunately, An-Tony, fell victim to the effects of a recent battle I had to defend the Nine Realms,” Thor started to explain. Steve hoped that Jarvis was recording, or at least transmitting this to the rest of the team. He didn’t feel like repeating any of this, whatever it turned out to be. “A powerful cosmic force known as the Aether caused, what I’ve come to learn simply enough as, shifts in reality, to different worlds. It would seem that they reached all the way here to your fair city.”
Mary moved almost as quickly as Pepper did from the offices to the cars. She was on the phone with someone, maybe Tony, she wasn't sure, she wasn't listening, but all Mary could think about was the information that they had gotten from Pepper. Tony had almost been killed, and he was still in danger. Stane had built some sort of suit, from what Tony had built in the desert, and they had to get to him.
The sun woke Steve as it hit his face. He turned a little, pressing his face into the pillow he had been using, until the pillow started to move, and something was sliding off of his chest. He opened his eyes only to see that his ‘pillow’ was actually Morgan, and Vee was pawing to climb back up, a little disgruntled. Steve sat up a little, seeing all of Tony’s girls around him in some fashion, and that he had indeed fell asleep on Tony’s couch while they waited for him to get home.
"You don't have to stay out here with me, you know I'd rather you be inside anyway." She snorted a little and Steve shook his head. "You keep using his full name."
“Did things come back?” Steve asked, stepping closer to her. He wasn’t about to lose Tony, especially not to a portal, not to one of Tony’s nightmares. He’d jump off the balcony and dive through the portal himself, if it had still been there.
"I know, Mama," Peter rolled his eyes a little, but leaned up to kiss his Mama goodbye. "Go save the world!" Mary chuckled every time he said, and hugged him before slipping her jacket on.
As he opened the text files with his notes, he watched recent news pop up to the side. It had been an automatic feature that Mary had set up for him, to keep him updated on the world now, so he could compare and contrast the past as he learned it to what was happening now.
Hands on his arms. "No!!" Tony tried to back up, but he couldn't move. He was being pulled forward and up. "Let me go!"
"Why?" Tony looked at him, tilting his head. "'Cause the stocks dipped forty points? We knew that was going to happen." They had predicted it right after the press conference.
"-but a part of me has always cared about you." Tony raised both eyebrows in surprise. "If I actually hated you, or didn't care about you at all, I wouldn't give you the time of day. I know there have been times I could have been nicer-"
“You’re going to run errands?” Steve questioned. Tony’s nose twitched a little in annoyance. “Just checking,” Steve said with a chuckle, giving him a little kiss. “I’m sure there might be, but I’m also sure that it’s not something we absolutely need. I assume that the floor where his party will be is ready?” Tony hummed and nodded. “I don’t think we need much more. Mary and Coulson said they would help out to get the rooms decorated and set up. If you want you can always pick up some more ice cream.”
"There is power there, the power to keep him safe. Forever." Tony swallowed heavily. "You only need to reach out," as the voice spoke, Tony's arm lifted up, reaching towards the glow, "and take it."
“You’re going to make us get our pictures taken with our counterparts, aren’t you?” Steve asked from inside the room.
Tony looked back down at the game board. "For now." Yinsen raised an eyebrow at the inventor. "I, uh, I have a son." The doctor looked surprised at this. He had met Tony Stark once, as he had mentioned to him, and he followed him in the tabloids a little, it was hard not to hear about the exploits of Tony Stark. But he had never heard about the Stark Industries CEO actually having a son.
"When he's hovering just above your face, eyes wide open, like he's trying to study you?" Steve said as he walked into the attached bathroom, leaving the door open.
“I’ll say!” Mary exclaimed. “I mean, the things I must have missed out on. You and Tony are actually talking, and keeping eye contact, my parents are still here, too. And tell me, is it true, did my mother actually defend Tony?” Steve laughed at the look on Mary’s face. Tony almost had the same look when it had happened, the same look of disbelief. “I didn’t actually wake up in an alternate universe did I? There’s not some horrid place out there when I’m actually dead, and I never met you or Tony? Can you imagine it!” She grabbed Steve’s shoulder, moving him back and forth in an exaggerated fashion. “Peter lives with some other distant relative, you and Tony fight all the time, and suddenly some horrible superhero war breaks out, and oh! My poor little Peter gets involved in it! No, say it isn’t so!” She put her arm over her eyes and slumped back against the pillows.
"Fair enough," Tony nodded. "I do see what you're trying to do though, and really, I'm all emotioned out for at least another three days. So if we have to do the "is this/isn't this" relationship-type thing, let's just dive in."
Mary looked like she was about to tell Peter not to ask questions like that, and he felt Steve tense a little, knowing that they hadn't wanted to tell Peter yet, but Tony put a stop to all of it. "We're dating, Petey." He felt Steve turn his head to look at him, saw Mary giving Steve a smug smile, and William just flat out smiled.
You beautiful people you! I'm here to give more Rhodey love in this chapter! Also, some Thor love. This will probably be as much as I delve into Thor: The Dark World in this story. There may be some call backs later, but meh. Everything serves a purpose. Mwuahaha.
"Yeah, didn't take long, I think the excitement of coming here, and the car ride tuckered him out," Tony said, taking a seat on the island stool. He was about to reach for a tumbler of scotch, but stopped when, a) the crystal decanter wasn't sitting there, and b) he remembered that Peter was actually in his house. "It took a little longer to get away though, because he had his little arms around my waist. I think the arc reactor is a nightlight for him."
"She looks about six months," Tony said as he sat back in his chair again. "But she's already crawling, and getting better every day so far, and her teeth are coming in fast. Maturity wise she could be almost eight months." He shrugged a little.
Steve walked into the pool room as he heard a splash of water. He frowned and looked around, then saw the form in the water, slowly starting to sink down. "Tony!" Steve's eyes widened and he ran for the deep end, diving in immediately. Tony was sinking fast, almost as if something were pulling him down, and Steve coiled his body before releasing, giving his body the extra momentum he needed in the water. Steve could see that Tony's eyes were open, but he didn't seem aware of what was happening. Tony tried to breath, his mouth opening.
"Nest egg is completely not the right word," Steve said. "The Army finally calculated my back pay, from when I was frozen in the ice." Tony raised his eyebrow, awaiting the answer, and Steve fidgeted a little. "Just a little over five," he mumbled the last word and it got lost. Tony poked him again. "Million."
"Perhaps I should have asked if you've gotten any good sleep," Rhodey amended, rolling his eyes a little. "It's okay if you haven't, Tony. Like you said, you were gone for three months. You beat all the odds, and-"
Mary raised an eyebrow at him, turning more to face him. “Really? Tony’s already tried to apologize for that, and tried to distance himself from us when Peter was younger. After Afghanistan he went back and forth on that decision. But now, he’s embraced it, as much as he can, and just makes sure to care for, and protect, Peter as much as he can. He’s a pretty smart guy when no one’s paying attention.” She smiled at him and rubbed his arm gently, before turning and walking away.
But, the way Tony was feeling, the empty feeling in his stomach, the pounding in his head, the shaking in his hands, it wasn't alcohol induced. He hadn't had anything to drink last night, or even the night before. He'd had a lot of coffee that morning, working down in the workshop, but he was pretty sure that wasn't what had sent him careening for the toilet.
"I started with the most recent music," Steve confessed. He was not a huge fan of most of the music that had come out recently, and maybe it had been a mistake to start that way, but he had hoped that it help him adjust to the current time a little more quickly.
"He certainly doesn't hold back," she said to Tony. Julie Wilson was looking good for someone who had just went through another round of radiation and chemo two days before the wedding. Tony was glad that his stylist was able to help her out.
"Depends on what you want to talk about," Bruce said carefully. Steve could see that Bruce was protective of Tony, and he couldn't blame him, but now he could really see it after what Tony told him. It was no wonder why the Hulk saved Tony when he was falling back down to Earth. Steve tried to suppress the shiver of the memory.
“I can’t sleep sometimes, and I wasn’t tired yet.” The pre-teen shrugged a little, rocking back on his heels. “It’s not really that late, and Peter and I don’t have to start classes for another month.” Wade was getting pretty good at answering all the questions that might be asked before they were asked, and sometimes before they were even thought up. “You were gone for a bit, where’d you go?”
"I should just invest in a glass company," Tony muttered under his breath "You hurt, Petey?" Peter shook his head no, and Tony dropped a kiss on his head. He put him down on his feet, keeping his son behind him as he turned to face the windows, one hand holding onto Peter. Tony's eyes narrowed at the man standing there, dressed in black with a visible metal arm.
"J, raise the temperature by six degrees in the bedroom," Tony called out. Steve raised an eyebrow at him as he stood up. "Yeah, you're not supposed to put a blanket over top a baby, or under, or even any pillows or stuff like that, avoiding suffocation and the like.. So since she can't sleep with something warm over top, I want to make sure the room is plenty warm, cozy, even."
“She is his clone,” Coulson answered, a little amusement in his voice. “There’s a good bet that he was a little like this.”
"Yes, sir," Hill said after a second, moving towards the two agents standing by the entrance to Selvig's lab. "With me." They headed off and Fury looked at Mary.
“Did you have fun today?” Steve asked after a few minutes. “Lots of other kids seemed to really like your costume today.”
"He was tailing you, but he's seen her as well," Tony said with a frown. "Also, that house was not suitable for one person, much less three." He tapped his phone again the holograms disappeared. "That's why we're picking a home for her tonight, and I'm getting a crew there as soon as possible to install SI security tech." Tony had made the mistake once of letting someone use a loved one against him, he wasn't going to give this assassin the chance to do that against Steve.
"The grandparents are Hydra, too." Steve put his hand to his ear, turning the comm unit back on, and Bucky was grabbing his wrist. "Have someone waiting outside the house." Then he was out of the room.
"Are we going to need to get you back to the Tower quickly?" Tony heard a tightness in Steve's voice, and oh, he noticed the reactor.
"Have to do with the baby with in his arms?" She asked, nodding her head back towards Steve who was only standing a few feet away.
"This isn't our first rodeo, Captain," Clint said with a small smirk. "You just worry about Fury and Hill, and getting Loki and Thor to the hangar. We'll need ten minutes."
"Yeah, the Avengers," Tony glanced back at him, ruffling his hair. "We're gonna stay up here though."
“You’ve got GPS installed with Jarvis,” Steve said. “I think I’ll manage to get us back home.” Tony smiled and shrugged, sliding in on the passenger side.
"If you were in a relationship with Steve, would you try to make him happy?" Bruce was looking out the window at the gardens as he spoke. Tony envied how peaceful he could be sometimes.
Getting back upstairs earlier, and relieving Bruce from babysitting duty, Steve had pulled up the footage right away, and studied what had happened. Steve checked Jamie’s diaper before pressing a big kiss to her cheek. He heard some knocking at the door and Tony waved him off to go greet their guests, eyes still glued to the tablet screen.
"We're not getting a tailor." Steve shook his head a little and they headed for the furniture department first. "Although, I was looking online, and I think that's where we should order the cloth diapers?" Tony smiled as Steve went on, naming things he knew he wanted, and then talking about a color theme he was thinking for her future bedroom. Tony couldn't stop thinking that it was all terribly domestic, and wondering if he'd be able to steal Jamie away from Steve as they continued shopping.
“Something about repayment,” Steve said as he darted to the back of another house, pressing himself close to a window to listen inside. “Wilson has Wade.” Tony cursed, and Steve cupped his hand around his ear as the signal started to crackle. “Tony, I’m losing you. Jarvis has my location. I’ll be back soon.”
Mary looked at Tony, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t give me that look,” Tony pointed at her, then grabbed the handle of Peter’s luggage. “Alright, kiddo, grab your bag. Mr Steve and Jamie are waiting for us in the garage. If we leave soon then we can grab dinner at the hotel.”
"That seems to be the general consensus," Tony muttered with a little smile. "Well, I'll give you the heads up, Peter is returning with his grandparents and Wade, and we're having a large family dinner upstairs."
"Yeah," Tony turned to face her a little more, and he could feel Mary coming up behind him, taking her water. "They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you."
“Jarvis also records everything.” He smiled at her. “Some people call me a hypocrite, to appear to have my hands in everything. I don’t usually check into anything unless I believe there’s a security threat, or Jarvis brings it to my attention.”
"I'm actually moving to New York as well," Tony interrupted, and that seemed to shock the older woman. "I have a family house up there, and I can still be close to Peter. Same routine, just a different state." Tony swore he saw a little bit of a smirk on Mr Fitzpatrick's face. "I was actually born in New York, and spent many years there, so I'm sure that I can help Mary and Peter as well."
They commenced a staring contest that lasted for several minutes, until a sound of pain came from Steve on the bed. Tony pushed back on Loki's arms, and the taller man let him go, taking several steps back. Loki frowned then disappeared with a shimmer, and the temperature started to rise back to normally nearly immediately. Tony frowned, then hurried over to Steve, pushing his face as close to Steve's face as he dare, but not touching him yet. He had to slowly bring Steve back to at least semi-consciousness, out of the panic attack, then it would be safe enough to touch him.
“They were just so passionate, I didn’t have the heart to talk them out of it.” Tony put two fingers to his lips, giving a whistle when Steve managed a three point shot. “Plus, it’s fun to watch Steve learn things the hard way, sometimes.”
“Have fun, Tony. You’ve earned this.” He rolled his eyes a little as Pepper mirrored Mary’s words and hung up, slipping his phone back into his pocket. He strolled over to Steve and Peter, kissing Steve’s cheek, and crouching next to Peter as he examined a couple of different Lego sets.
' from the boy. Tony smiled at Peter for his manners, knowing that he didn't get them from Tony, and turned back to his Starkpad, contemplating the next few songs to slip into Steve's playlist. This was just some harmless fun, and a painless way to have tease Steve for leaving on a cross-country adventure. Right?
"It was one of Mary's rules," Tony told him. "I mean, back then, it was an annoying rule, but now I'm glad that I at least listened to it. Made me less like,...."
"Yeah!" Peter smiled, still in Mary's lap. "This one is bigger, and should last for loooooong time."
Pepper eventually walked back over, took the device, and nodded. "Don't come right back here, just in case. Wait an hour or so." Peter would be asleep by the time that Pepper came back with the drive. She nodded one last time and left the workshop. He knew he was asking a lot of her, but he also knew that she could do it.
Steve woke up first, or at least he thought he was first. A glance at the other end of the couch saw that Peter and Tony were talking quietly with each other. Tony was on his back, propped with a pillow behind his head, and Peter half laying, half sitting on Tony's chest, fingers tracing the arc reactor through Tony's shirt. Steve closed his eyes again, not wanting to interrupt their moment. He almost felt bad when his Super Soldier hearing picked up their conversation.
“We’re not going shopping for you birthday presents.” He glanced in the mirror to see the slight pout that was starting to develop on his young features. “We’ve already got your presents.” Peter’s face lit up with a smile so fast that Tony had a hard time not smiling himself. “Papa and I are going out because one year ago, he asked me out, and I said yes. He was really very silly, but he’s stuck around for this long, so we’re going to celebrate.”
Steve’s jaw drops a little as he looks at Peter. He honestly hadn’t been expecting that. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting when Tony said that Peter would be looking for him, and he thought that maybe Peter would be asking when he and Tony would be getting married when he started his conversation. Then he was afraid of what turn it might take when he started talking about Jamie, a little anxiety that Peter might get more jealous than he had initially been. It seemed that Steve didn’t have to worry about that at all.
Tony managed to get a room that set furthest away from any entrance, applying his charm, and a bit of Steve's pensive face, and he sat patiently as they applied the bandages to his nose. He hadn't even been shown to his room before they had taken him directly to get an x-ray. He was lucky that nothing had shifted too far out of place, they would straighten it and it should heal on its own.
“You take on too much.” Mary tugged on his shirt, pulling him back to lay down on the bed. “You need to talk to someone about what happened, soon,” she told him, her tone leaving no room for argument. They both laid there for a couple of moments, before Mary spoke up again. “You never did tell me where Steve was.”
“Then she can be closer all over your aging body. Seriously, I don’t think I can move now, my body has locked down. You’re going to have to get a stretcher and slide me on like a mummified corpse.” Steve rolled his eyes and Tony leaned his head back.
Tony nodded. "Some teachers are Doctors, and I'm a Doctor in Physics, mechanical and electrical engineering." Peter stared at him for a few second with big eyes, but a blank look. "All the stuff I need to know to make the Bots, Jarvis, and the Iron Man suit." That did the trick, his eyes lighting up. "There are even people who are Doctors of Art."
"You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?" He could tell Rhodey the truth.
"Steve is next to your room," Tony told him. "Jarvis took readings of the arc reactor, and everything seems to be normal. No more readings of palladium."
"You don't have enough money now? You need to milk me for mine?" Steve rolled his eyes and went for the last fry, but Tony grabbed it first. "I mess up around Peter sometimes, but he's been pretty good at not repeating those words."
"I don't want to worry them until we have more facts," Tony said, putting Jamie's back to his chest, letting her take most of the weight of the body in her hands.
"I'll just input another AI system, they'll help me," Tony muttered as they rode down to the ground floor.
“Still no idea what it is that’s attacking, but it’s definitely an attack.” He frowned and hovered by the floor, away from the impact sight, and he could see the others reaching the floor. “Whatever’s happening, the objects get bigger each time, but they’re not landing on the ground.”
"Tony, what are you talking about?" Bruce went over to where Tony was searching through all the stuff they had dug out of the crates. He found the first slot of the old Expo model from the 70's. "Slow down Tony, you used a lot of reactor power with that opening."
Tony tore himself away from Mary's room, checked in on Peter and Wade to make sure they were still sleeping, then went back downstairs. He slipped into the underground garage where he had moved most of the cars, and set up a space that he was sure would contain Loki. Thor had assured him that shackles around his wrist dampened his magic to a point where he couldn't use it, so he just had to create something that would keep Loki in one place. Tony had gone the route of an electric fence, like a bad dog that couldn't stay in its own yard.
Tony had been holding onto the wall as he made his way to the door. As he left the stability of the wall he stumbled, falling to his knees. He couldn't catch his breath, his chest really hurt, and it felt like his eye were vibrating. There were people coming towards him and he quickly backed up until his back hit the wall. He hissed when he bent his wrist a little too much. There were voices talking around him and he pressed his hands to his ears, shaking his head.
There was a gasp and Tony was sitting up just before Peter’s voice shouted through the house. “There’s cake!!”
"I'm afraid I can't do that ma'am," he said in his nicest voice, which could very possibly make most other villains want to apologize. "I don't think Tony would appreciate bloodshed on the floors."
"I'm sorry, that was awful. I'm so tired that it's making me more a dick than usual." Tony waved his hands a bit. "They had some of your DNA, from the blood from that one fight, with the animals. And, I can't be sure, but they tried a lot of tests with that..... And she's the one that came out on the other side." Tony rubbed his hands together. "They tried to clone you, I guess? And,..." He trailed off as Steve looked back down at the baby.
"You had your hand all over this," Pepper said to him. "Don't ignore your part in making this special day." Tony nodded a little, still not looking over at her. "I thought that after the wedding I would either find you still here, or running back to the Tower."
"Sir, Colonel Rhodes is arriving," Jarvis said, bringing up the camera view of outside the front door.
"For the time being," Tony said, letting him walk in first, watching the man take in the mansion. It was obviously something that the man would have never seen back in the 40's, and probably a level of opulence that he wouldn't have even seen since coming back from his ice nap. Peter was already asleep in his arms, having fallen asleep in the car that Tony had managed to get from SHIELD. Happy was with Pepper while she had been on her meetings, so he knew that his friend would be safe.
“You should go with the tie,” Peter told him. “If you look important, then the people will give you more stuff for me.” Tony couldn’t help but snort.
Drawing up short, Tony felt his body run cold. His steps were slow and deliberate as he saw Mary rocking on the ground, holding onto Rachel, sobbing softly. He swallowed when movement caught his eyes, the doors opening and William and Steve were coming out. Sound was washed out as the older man ran over to his family, and Tony only saw his mouth moving, calling a name and there wouldn't be a response.
Of course, Tony couldn’t have counted on parking being quite horrendous on the street, forcing him to park three blocks away. His sunglasses were already on, and he buttoned up his jacket as he locked his car and started the hike up. It wasn’t that he minded walking, he did a lot of walking when he worked directly with the missiles that he helped with when SI was still working with the military on weapons. He just didn’t like doing it alone, where he might be recognized, or any one of his apparently endless enemies could be watching him.
"I meant what decade," she said with a chuckle. "But it's nice to know how long you have under your belt. Have you never listened to music before that?"
“I think maybe we need it a little longer than that,” Steve commented, feeling Tony tense a little. “You’re starting to look like a raccoon, baby. It’s not a terribly attractive look if that’s not what you’re aiming for.”
“I think this is something that you’re gonna like then.” Bucky was sure that Steve was going to feel better.
Except they didn’t make it home before the chaos started. In the time that they had been inside and the pictures had been posted, more cameras and people had gathered. Tony blinked, caught off guard for a second. Steve went to pull away, but Tony just followed him, and gave him a look. That’s when Tony took over, pushing them through the group of cameras and shouted questions.
He heard the baby give another whimper and Tony opened his eyes. They had created a child, it was living, breathing, moving, in front of him. And they wanted him to use it like a piece of trash, make it into another tool for them. No matter how Tony felt about the science of clones, they had created life, and this was a part of Steve. He wasn't going to let them doing anything to her.
"But I'm dating a Captain, that should count, right?" Tony slid his arms in to take Rowan from Steve after the bottle was empty. "Throw that towel over my shoulder," Tony nodded to Steve's lap. "You're not questioning why the Silver Star?"
“I told you that this would be a whole new experience,” Tony said, turning a little so he could look at Steve. “The press was nothing like what you had to deal with back in the War. I’ll try to protect you.” Steve snorted softly and pressed a kiss to the side of his mouth. “You’re handling it with a lot of patience, that’s for sure. Super proud of you, Soldier.”
"In about fifteen minutes?" Steve raised an eyebrow. Tony just smiled at him. A very familiar smile that he had seen on Peter's face just a couple of hours ago. Faux innocence.
Tony was the first to sweep forward to the car and pull the door open. He locked eyes with Meg and they both smiled at each other. Taking her hand he helped her slide out. "You're looking good, Tony."
Thor gripped him and Tony pulled up, bringing them both into the air. Now they were in Tony's domain. Or so Tony thought. Seemed Thor was used to being this high up as well, and struggled against Tony's trajectory. Tony managed to slam him up against a rock face, pushing him down along it, digging into the rocks as they went, until Thor used his hammer to redirect them. They both went flying through thick tree bark, Jarvis not so helpfully highlighting the damage to the suit as it happened. Mark VI was going to need to some tender loving care.
“How do you always manage to find some of the cheesiest songs, with some of the best writing?” Tony’s fingers moved to rub a spot right behind Steve’s ear. “Seriously, it’s like you have a gift with all this pop music, and it’s hurting my music sensibilities.”
“Yes, she does, doesn’t she?” Loki did smirk, and Steve didn’t like it. “I was correct in my assumptions, one of them is yours. Quite the family that you’ve built for yourself.”
"God, you need a new name for that," he muttered, looking over into the crowd again. He saw a woman with her hair up, a long blue dress with an amazing back plunge, and a glass of champagne in her hand, and he thought she looked familiar.
“I told you!” Peter said with a grin. Jamie’s face had lit up, her eyes wide, and a huge grin was bunching up her chubby little cheeks.
“Nineteen Forty-One Cadillac Lasalle convertible,” Tony said with a smile. “I recently acquired it. Thought it might be something, a little more, familiar for you?”
"Tony!" There was more yelling in the house. Rhodey? "Tony!" He was being rolled over, Rhodey, he was there. "You okay?"
“The Penthouse is now three floors,” Steve countered, eyes narrowing slightly to stop Tony from responding. “Three huge floors.”
Tony had had time to think while making his flight overseas, boosting the suit as far as he dare push it, having put a new palladium core in, just in case. He had chugged an entire forty ounces of chlorophyll before suiting up as well, just to be at peak performance. He was going to take this asshole down. He hurt Mary, he hurt his son, and he hurt Tony. Tony Stark did not take that lying down.
"Of course I did!" Tony grinned at him, kissing the side of his head. "Just like I put all of your artwork up, I'm gonna put up art that has you in it." Peter wiggled happily in Tony's arms. Mary leaned over to kiss Peter's head, making him giggle a little. "You're silly, Petey. You're our silly little boy."
"I'm afraid so, son," William nodded again, moving along to the front of the couch. "There are things for temporary relief, but nothing permanent."
"Early reports of human experimentation." Tony glanced up to both Steve and Bruce. "Think we may have found the ring leader."
Tony hummed a little, waking up to a soft sensation against his cheek. It felt nice, and the repetition of the motion almost put him back to sleep. He opened one eye just a crack and saw the shadow of the thing that was causing the feeling on his face. Opening his other eye, just a little more, he saw that the object was Jamie’s hand petting his cheek. Her face lit up when she saw that he was awake and she made a soft cooing sound.
"Thanks, for that, by the way," Tony said softly. He ran his free hand over his face. "Guess I was setting myself up for this, probably went too long without sleep."
"Hey, hey!" Tony stopped and turned to see Obie. "Hey, Tony, listen." Obie stepped up to him. "I'm trying to turn this think around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch to them." He saw Obie's eyes slide down the arc reactor, and he felt something shiver down his spine. "Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs-"
“Don’t we have to, actually, get ready for dinner?” Steve asked, interrupting their battle. Or at least interrupting Tony, and Peter got in a cheap hit that made Tony fall back onto the bed, eyes wide, and staring up at the ceiling.
Tony looked over at Steve, analyzing him, and hummed. “That is a very good question, Petey. Are we going for looks, or what Prince does he embody in values?”
Here we go though, Peter is gonna meet Jamie! I've loved seeing all your hopes and predictions. Just know that this is not the only time that Peter will voice his thoughts. As our little Tony-look-a-like grows up, he gets his own voice, and becomes a bigger part of the story. It's fun. :)
“Just a song, don’t worry about it,” he waved it off a bit. “How are you feeling? Wanna get up and maybe make some early breakfast? Wanna stay in bed for a bit? Nice long warm shower?” Steve narrowed his eyes a bit and tilted his head. “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
"He's supposed to have manners, I don't know what happened," Tony shrugged a little. "But people were supposed to have taste in music, as well."
"Nope, right now, come with me." Both Mary and Coulson stood up quickly at her words, especially when she didn't stop walking. Pepper glanced at Mary, but looked back at Coulson, then glanced behind her. Mary looked behind them as well. She got a shiver down her back when she saw Obidiah Stane standing there, watching them leave. Something didn't feel right. "We're going to have it right now."
"Who are you?" Tony growled out at the man. He was about to step closer to the man, but the sound of a jet was coming from above. The back opened up and he saw Agent Romanoff was standing there in a black cat suit.
"High School Sweethearts?" Tony wrinkled his nose up. "And is he gonna ask Peter to the Sadie Hawking's dance while drinking a shake next to the jukebox?"
"We did what we had to do," Tony replied. "If we had tried to do it without any damage, then a lot more people would have died. I'm not happy about the destruction, but we tried to keep it to a minimum." Steve nodded. He knew that it made sense, and there would probably be plenty of options for him to try and make up for it later, but he still wanted to help, it was ingrained in his bones. "I gotta start rebuilding the Tower, you can help me with that," Tony offered.
"Your Ma was a good woman who deserved all sorts of awards for putting up with you," Steve said, putting the empty dinner dish in the dishwasher.
Steve pulled the boy into his arms and Wade started to cry against his chest. "We're not going to let anything happen to you, or your mom," Steve told him, rubbing his back. "This is the safest place for you." He wanted to promise that they'd be safe, but they'd been attacked just outside of the doors to the building. Steve wanted to talk to Tony later tonight. He watched Meg and Bucky silently leave the room, nodding to them once, but not letting go of Wade. He knew he'd have to Julie what was happening now.
The door opened a little and Natasha's head peeked out, her red hair pulled back. She looked at Tony and Steve, then down at Peter and Wade. "There are three handsome men out here, and then there's Tony." Tony opened his mouth a little. They could hear Mary chuckle behind the door.
Steve shut the water off, and looked in the mirror as we wiped a spot clean of the steam. He hadn't gotten much sleep while they were searching for Tony, and he was wondering if Bucky was okay, but luckily it didn't show too much on his face. He towel dried his hair and thought about what he was going to do. Getting Tony back was top priority. He was forced to take a step back when it came to Bucky, but that still garnered a lot of his attention. Now though, now there was a child out there, an innocent life that he was stepping up to take care of. Thinking about having a family, and suddenly having one, well, it was a little frightening, but not nearly as scary as he thought. At least not if Tony was there by his side.
She nodded, a little smile that Tony recognized as one that parents got when they thought about their kids. "I have two."
"Rest, I'll make breakfast in the morning," Bruce told him again, leading him towards Peter's room. He made sure Tony went into the room before retreating to his own. Tony slowly crawled into the bed next to Peter. Almost instantly, the little boy turned, seeking out Tony, cuddling into his chest, hand covering his arc reactor.
Peggy pursed her lips a little, smirking slightly, and raised one eyebrow. Steve frowned at the look. Amethyst put her front paws on the bed. Peggy chuckled and leaned over to pet her as well. “Forgive Steve for his rudeness. My name is Peggy, I’m Tony’s Aunt.” Amethyst trilled happily. “Amethyst, dear, does our Tony have a bit of a crush on Steve?”
Steve dropped a kiss on the top of his head. “No, not yet. He’s gonna get lots of rest so he can feel better real soon.” Peter nodded seriously, and Steve moved to rub Wade’s shoulders a little. “Eat your breakfast before you have to start classes. I’ll even take you and Wade out if you get down early.” They both grinned and turned back to their plates.
"They did, when I was working," Tony said carefully. "They wanted me to make them something, something bad."
"Then Peter is going to whine." Steve grinned. They turned the corner and Steve was looking at Tony when he was suddenly tackled to the ground. Tony's hand went to his wrist as he went to step in front of Meg, the black clad figure rolling off of Steve and to his feet. Tony saw a metal hand and tensed.
“Veeee,” she crooned out, a little sad. She stepped closer, putting her small front feet up on his legs. Tony’s fingers curled around the back of her ears to scratch softly and she trilled again, telling him that she liked it.
"It looks good though, I like it." Tony tilted his head, hands in his pockets, watching the pants pull and hug Steve's butt, letting the man catch him doing it too. "Yeah, you look really good tonight." He grinned when Steve pushed his shoulder.
Tony started to move then, tried to push away, to get away from Steve. Steve just continued to hold on, trying to get back up as soon as possible. He could feel Tony's chest heaving, drawing in water instead of air.
Awaited Part 2 is adorable. No excuse for late chapter, I was up all night and failed to hear my alarm. :( But that's okay, cause this chapter is adorable! You will make noises. Noises of adorableness. :D
“I would advise against continued use of the suit, Sir,” Jarvis said in his ear. “But, taking into account your propensity of stubbornness, I would suggest staying upright.” Tony made to roll his eyes, but took a sharp breath when it caused a painful spike, and a roll of his uneasy stomach. “You have a severe concussion, Sir, please do refrain from making sarcastic gesture with your eyes.”
"I'm trying to work on the arc reactor." Tony's fingers started to drum against the desk in annoyance. "But the way I work on it needs to be my way, and I won't have SHIELD in my business if I don't want them, too."
“He even got Jarvis to help with visual cues, so she associates the word with you.” Steve sniffed softly and Tony’s thumb reached up to wipe at the stray tear. “You need the rest, babe.”
“When I feel that it is time for you to know about what happens, then I will let you know,” Steve fire back, voice thread and low, thrumming with a barely concealed threat to back down. “When I get all the information is when I will release what we know. You’ve already proved that when you don’t get all of the information, you go running half-cocked, and endangering others.”
"You won't do that," Steve told him. "You're not going to anything, because what you're doing is illegal on so many levels, and just wrong."
Peter wasn't crying as loudly now, his sniffles calming down a little. "He was going after Daddy," he said through breaths, his little chest heaving with mostly shock. He was scared. Mary wanted to kill Stane herself. "He said he killed Daddy! Mama!" He started to cry again and she held onto him tightly. There was a low rumble and she looked up, seeing something streak up into the sky.
"He just drifted off to sleep," she told him, glancing back at the boys briefly. "Wade won't let him go. Jarvis told us that Tony was awake, and that seemed to calm Peter down enough." Steve nodded a little, rubbing Jamie's back. "They haven't really said anything, though. It's going to be rough."
Steve’s hand gently started to rub circles on Tony’s waist as he tried to put together what he wanted to say. “I worry sometimes, about a lot, and stuff that I probably shouldn’t be bothered about. So, I worry about if I’m doing the right thing with Jamie, if I could be doing it better, or different, or more effective. That’s just the simple stuff, there’s stuff that no one else would probably have to worry about.” Tony hadn’t said anything, but Steve could tell that he was listening, that he had all of his attention.
"That's you, obviously. Listen to how cute you sound. But seriously, if I'm not around, listen to your Mama, and your Aunts and Uncles, and your Grandparents, and the Neighbor. Ugh, I can't even say his name now, but he's not exactly talking to me right now. That's if you still see him around, cause I'm sure you won't be spending forever in that apartment." Tony let out a little snort. "No, you'll get this house, the Manor, and the house in Malibu. Talk to your Mama, she'll know what to do, but you'll be able to do whatever you want with the houses. Pepper will take care of the company, so you don't have to worry about that." Peter started to knock at the door. "I love you Peter, so much, and I hope you never doubted that, not for a second." Tony gave one last smile before he stopped the recording and got up. "Save that tot he private server, Jarvis."
Hello beautiful people! So this chapter, I tried something a little different narrative wise in one part, the family dinner, and I think it works. It's cute.
“I couldn’t leave my best girls,” he said quietly through the tears that sprung up. “I owed you a dance.”
"I think it's going to take a little more time than that to get through seventy years of music," Bruce told the billionaire.
Mary raised an eyebrow at him. "An extended stay again?" Tony just nodded, and Mary glanced at Steve. "This is the, third?, time since school started." Steve snuck a glance at Tony that Mary didn't miss. "I'm missing something."
Tony saw when Steve noticed what was missing on Howard's desk, when his eyes swept over the desk a second, then a third time. Steve looked back up and caught Tony's eyes. "He did most of his work from here, he didn't like the feeling of an office in a large corporate building. He did a lot of meetings here as well, wanting to make clients feel comfortable, but to be on his territory, said that's how sharks got their prey." Tony moved from his spot and opened one of the old files sitting on the desk, spreading out some of the papers.
"Yes," Tony told him, really, unable to help himself. "I've been sticking with the saying 'What happens in the gym, stays in the gym', much like what I said that very same night as well." Tony dropped back down, groaning a little. "You would be the one to be all respectful about this. There are a hundred and one things that you could be asking me about."
“Dadddddy!” He giggled tucking his arms against his body to try and block Tony’s hands. “Mommy! Help!”
"Partial lockdown, Captain Rogers," the AI responded. "Security teams are still sweeping through a five block radius, while three guards at placed at each entrance and exit to the building. The building is restricted to employees only, with ID Badges only, and all appointments have been canceled."
After a couple of moments, Mary softly cleared her throat. "I'm going to go get Peter now, and I'll let you explore more." She set down the keychain on one of the bedside tables. "The blue key is to your apartment, and the red one is to my apartment. There is a phone out int he living room, it's going to look mighty different from what you're used too, but there's a list of phone numbers next to the phone, along with some instructions. If you have any questions before I get back, please feel free to call."
“Also, I want you to think very hard about who’s influencing our kids sleeping habits very hard.” Tony lifted his head enough so that one eye peeked above Steve’s cheek. “You are curled around me, our heads are upside down in relation to each other, and neither one of us is laying the correct way in the bed.”
"You like chicken, right, Petey?" Tony asked, looking at the little boy, finger still in his mouth. He tutted with a smile when Peter smiled, sucking the last of the peanut butter from his finger. "You little sneak," he chuckled. "Alright, how about the grand tour? I have a big house, and if you're going to visit more often, you should know where everything is." Tony stood up, then stopped, eyes widened a little. "Oh! I am so bad, I didn't introduce you to Jarvis!"
"Ma'am," he answered on instinct, hand coming up to take the phone from Agent Hill. "Mary," he said softer this time, voice full of a lingering anguish.
"Stuff that you'll find out in a couple of years, I'm sure," Tony told him with a smile. He held out one arm to Peter, patting his leg with the other, and the boy ran over to him, hopping up in his lap. Tony wrapped his arm around Peter. "Nothing to worry about, Petey-Pie." Tony bit back a laugh when he saw Wade open the bathroom door, pushing Steve's shoes and socks inside, hearing a surprise yelp from Steve. "You're usually supposed to knock first, Wade."
“In case some actually handling needs to be done?” Tony asked and Bucky nodded. Tony hummed in thought, and Meg looks like she might be sick as the pieces started to click together. “That’s enough time to sneak some subliminal messages in. And probably a lot harder to openly work with Hydra in the US-“
"Of course it does." That was the new voice. She could see a man dressed in dark clothing, leather? Next to him was another Agent, and off to the side was Barton, but he wasn't moving. What was going on? "I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki, of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose." The same Loki that Coulson had mentioned when he had come back from New Mexico?
"Makes more sense," he nodded. "I want to take you back to Bruce's lab, and record this reaction to cherries."
"This is a collection that I started when I was just a kid, just a little older than you." Peter blinked, adjusting his eyes to the lower level lights that were turning on. He looked around and took in his surroundings, before letting out a little gasp.
"Let me get this straight," Tony looked at her, putting his hands flat on the table. "You've got some weak information that you think is enough to put a long-term assignment into play, and you want to take one of our strongest players out there with yourself to check it out. At the same time, you want me, a very public face with lots of business to still conduct, because I still Own a business, to stay indoors. Stay indoors from an assassin who is targeting me that you deem to be dangerous, but apparently not dangerous enough to leave me with adequate guarding." Tony hoped he looked as unimpressed as he felt. "Did you not read the report on how he was easily able to take on Rogers? Easily able to meet Captain America's capabilities and knocked me on my ass with one punch? Literally, he sent me off my feet, with one punch, from his Flesh and Blood hand."
a very familiar female voice spoke now. Someone who had been in his mind before. Tony mentally shuddered when he thought about the fact that all three of these people had been inside of his head at one point.
Bucky, the Winter Soldier, kept looking at her, as if waiting for something else. “If the target becomes hostile?” He eventually asked.
"Daddy says I'm going to be smart, just like him," Peter said conversationally, concentrating on his fruit snacks as the three of them headed towards the apartment building. "I already jumped two grades, and Daddy says he jumped school grades all the time." Peter was already in third grade, and keeping up just fine, and there was no doubt that he was a gifted little boy. "I don't think I wanna go as fast as Daddy did, though."
He took a breath, felt the next hit on the shield and moved forward. Steve lifted the shield up, expecting to hit the scepter out of Stark's hands, but instead felt resistance. Lifting his head he saw that Stark was holding it with both hands, pushing against the shield, stopping Steve, which really should not have been possible.
Bruce's name was already on his lips before Steve spoke. "Dr Banner... put down the scepter." It was the scepter, it had to have been. Bruce looked at it, shocked that it had made it to his hand.
"Had-" Steve pulled in a breath when the hand pulled back a fraction of an inch. Seems he wanted the information from Steve more than he wanted him dead this time. "We had, too. It was the only way Bu-"
"Oh my god, you crazy son of a bitch." Tony had to laugh at that one now. "You owe me a new plane, you know that right?"
By some force of luck, (for the terrorists), a bullet lodged in the gear of the leg of the suit, sending him down to kneel. He never stopped shooting out the flames though. A few more explosions and he knew that he had a short window to get out of there. He forced himself up, leg stiff and straight, looked down at the arm and flipped a switch. His suit was propelled up into the air, the explosions of the weapons below him giving a little extra boost, and he was flying! Tony Stark was flying through the air!
Tony's mouth opened a little. "Uh, thanks, Rachel. And thanks, for back there, in the foyer." She gave him a rare smile and Tony hurried from the room. He didn't actually know how to handle the support from her, and he had other things to worry about at the moment anyway.
"When do you leave?" Tony asked when he was close enough, the music dropping down just enough to be heard, but he didn't look at Steve.
“I’m going to make a sass meter for you,” Tony threatened. “Alright, baby girl,” he place a hand on top of Jamie’s head. “Let’s go get the pictures of Daddy and Peter, yeah?” She pushed at his arm as Tony stood back up and headed for the building.
Steve was topside as the sun cleared the horizon in the morning to meet with Dr Banner as he arrived. Natasha had eventually convinced him to come first thing in the morning. Steve had met up with Coulson as soon as he got there late in the night, pulling Steve aside to tell him about Mary.
Tony stopped at the doorway to Peter's room and looked in. He pushed down the images from his nightmare, and watched the boy sleep. The reassuring rise and fall of his chest was mesmerizing to him right now. Peter was there, in his,
Steve was sitting next to him, leaning over a bit, wanting to help but not knowing what to do. He was still in shock at the fact that Tony had emerged with a baby from that place. Once Bruce had found Tony's signal they had been moving. Bucky was somehow already on the jet waiting for them, and told Steve that he was going to destroy everything inside of the facility. When Steve offered to wait for him he declined. He'd make his own back to the States.
“What about this one?” He pointed at a box that looked like a mechanic’s shop, complete with pieces for custom cars.
"It sound really creepy, and almost mad-scientist, when you keep saying 'while pregnant.'" Steve put his hands on his hips, looking at the two of them. They both whipped out the puppy eyes on him. "I am not easily swayed by those expressions."
And hour and a half later, Tony was staring at his counter, wondering how most of the pancake batter ended up on him, the floor, and the counter, than in the bowl, and the pan to cook. The doorbell sounded and Tony jumped.
Steve held onto his hands, wanting to reach out to pull Tony to him, wanting to run his hands through his hair to try and comfort him. Sure, he noticed there were times that Tony would shrug off the touches when he was working in the workshop, but he figured it was just something to do with the way that Tony worked. Afterwards, Tony would always make up for it, wrapping arms around him as they cooked in the kitchen, little kisses dropped on the couch with the kids. He never really thought about it. But now, it all added up, staring him in the face. Tony had just been able to hide the little attacks whenever they happened, he obviously had a system if this room was anything to go by.
"Your damn right," Mary snapped at him. "Now, I'm telling you that I'm dropping Peter off with you today, because I think that this will be good in two ways." She took a breath, composing herself again. "It will let me get done what needs to get done, to help You. And you will calm down enough to think about your response needs to be, rationally."
Bruce sighed, and looked up between the men. "A warm light, for all mankind. Loki's jab about the cube." Bruce looked over at Tony. "I think it was meant for you." Tony nodded, already suspecting. "Even is Barton didn't tell Loki about the Tower, it was still all over the news."
"Is that song relevant, or is it just something that you like?" Steve asked, not looking away from his sketchbook.
“I trust your team,” Steve told him. “If I have questions though, I’ll be sure to bring them to you.”
"Thank you, Tony." Steve moved a couple steps closer, then stopped, not knowing what to do. Tony put his hand out, grasping Steve's hand in a firm shake.
"Barnes is still watching Meg, and I'm assuming he'll be a constant shadow around the building when she gets back, too." Tony ran his hand through his hair. Dinner had been a nice distraction, but he could feel everything starting to pile up again, and he was one step away from becoming too overwhelmed. "Jarvis, we should think about updating a few security protocols so that alarms aren't blaring every time he touches a window."
Steve made a noise in surprise, but put a hand on Tony's waist and tilted his head so they had a more comfortable angle, returning the kiss. Tony moaned softly before his teeth tugged at Steve's bottom lip. "Tony?" Steve breathed out, pulling away from the kiss, but not from Tony.
Mary pat Steve’s back a little. “I like that word, clod. Just the way it sounds.” Steve glanced back at Mary and she motioned for him to sit back with her on the bed. “Tony feels bad about what was said then, too, so you can both stop beating yourself up about it now. Tony has a lot of insecurities.” Steve nodded a little, having had Tony talk to him about them, or let him bear witness to them in action. It really spoke platitudes to how much their relationship had advanced in such a short time. “Well, you’ll be staying here now, right? Tomorrow’s your birthday, and I know that both Stark men have been eagerly anticipating your arrival for that.”
Mary tilted her head when she heard a sound, like something bumping around a vent. She moved quietly to the side, following the sound, the other agents fanning around the room. She followed the sound over to the computer station, leaning down. It's where the sound stopped. Until she heard, something like, a whimper?
