fuck you
Cas tilted his head. “I do not understand that reference.”
"A female with Dean Winchester's phone, why does that not surprise me?" he said dryly. "What do you want, girl?"
“So it seems,” Castiel said with a small Cheshire grin.
“I didn’t know you played. Where’d you learn that from?”
Cas sitting on Dean's lap holding baby MJ, Dean's arms around them both, both men smiling down at their daughter.

"I do like those pretty noises, Sammy," Gabriel murmured, bending over to kiss and nibble up and down the side of Sam's neck. Sam white-knuckled the armrests of the chair and moaned again. Gabriel released Sam's hair just long enough to push the table out of the way and straddle Sam's thighs. He pushed his hands back into Sam's hair, using it to pull him in for a demanding kiss.
Castiel flung his hand out again, throwing Kevin across the room. He stalked over to the Scribe with barely contained rage, snatching him up by his arms and slamming him against the wall. Dean pulled Cas off of Kevin, dropping him to the floor. When Kevin got back up on shaky legs, Dean caught him in the jaw with a right hook then a left jab to the gut. Then it was Cas’ turn to pull Dean off of Kevin, grabbing Kevin by the throat with one hand and pinning him against the wall again.
“It’s a chipotle pepper mayonnaise,” Cas told him. “I make it myself. I find that ketchup is too sweet and mustard is too sour for my tastes, so I started experimenting with other flavors. Set that down and toast the buns, please.”
Something else niggled at the edge of Sam's thoughts. "What do you mean, before Bobby comes into his true power?"
“You guys doing date night in?” Dean teased.
by The Glorious Sons
out on a date was Rhonda Hurley back in high school. He didn't know what Cas' idea of a good date was, but if he trusted this man with his life then he could trust him to show him a good time. "Sure, what do you got in mind?" he asked with an easy smile.
Sam turned about ten shades of red then, wondering if the best solution here would be to talk to Gabriel about his concerns or try to make a run for it. Sam sighed and put the bowl of ice cream on the coffee table. He took a deep breath and said, “
“I apologize, Dean,” Cas said hoarsely, Dean loving the sound of his fucked-out voice. “It’s been a while for me, and I didn’t anticipate the effect of the past few hours.”
Trigger warning: Again, could be non-con based on your perception.
, Sam thought,
“Charles.”
With that, he pulled Castiel through the crown, out the front door, and behind the building where the Impala was parked. Castiel’s head spun and his heart pounded as he processed the way Dean had told his mother off. It was kind of hot.
“You wouldn’t understand, Bobby,” Gabriel said.
Castiel could sympathize, he had been feeling the same since the kids returned to their own time.
“Alright gorgeous, time to do your arms,” Gabriel said, running his hands up and down Sam’s arms. “I’m going to tie them behind your back, starting at your wrists and going up to just above your elbows. Are you okay with this?”
"Oh, if
"I beg your pardon," he said with mock indignation, "I'm a Hufflepuff, thank you."
“Mary,” Castiel said, resting a hand on her shoulder, “please go get Dean for me.” Mary nodded and left to get her older son.
Cas took one of the sodas and took a long sip, exposing his throat and moaning as he finished. “Thank you for this,” he told Dean, raising the soda can. Keeping eye contact with Dean, he licked his lips and set the can back down.
Samyaza reappeared about a hundred yards away. He held a wicked-looking sword, like a scimitar. Definitely not standard issue from Heaven. He crouched low into a coiled attack position, the black ichor slowly dripping from his neck and leaving droplets in the sand. Gabriel imitated his stance, rotating his sword by the wrist a few times. A pained look flashed across Gabriel’s face, then both beings began their charge towards the other, swords held high.
Just then, a blast shook the bunker. Gabriel, Castiel, and Bobby all dropped their blades from their sleeves. "I think they found us," Gabriel said grimly.
"Memphis, Tennessee," Cas replied, stopping in front of a building with a large sign that read Dyer's Burgers. As they entered, Cas explained, "a man named Doc Dyer opened this establishment in 1912 with his own unique cooking process for his burgers, which included frying them in his secret grease recipe. They still use the same grease today, straining it daily, and it has been said to produce some of the juiciest, most delicious burgers in the country."
Trigger Warning: You know the drill, may be non-con depending on your perspective.
“Twister? What the hell Cas?”
any different than us?” he spat the word as if it were filth in his mouth. “You cannot tell me that you are not teaching them the Old Ways, and you certainly cannot tell me you would not do anything in your power to protect them. That is why you are here, correct?” Samyaza lifted an eyebrow at Gabriel in challenge, daring him to contradict him.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas turned to the laptop, restarted the song, then turned back to Dean so that he could observe the man’s reactions. “Listen very closely to the words.”
“Oh, and
Castiel responded by sitting on her other side and placing a hand on her shoulder. "Tell us what happened, Deanna," he said gently.
Bobby reverently lad the guitar back in the case before hugging his dad tightly. “I love it Dad, thanks.”

“The problem with that,” Cas told him, “is that the only person who can open the cage is Rowena.”
together around both wrists of each victim. “If you flip the contrast on the photo-” he tapped a button and the picture turned into a negative, except the bracelets, “-the bracelets don’t change. They’re not spelled objects, they’re made out of demon shade and bits of lost souls.”
“Nah,” Gabriel said cheekily, “go ahead without us. I’m gonna take my moose to bed. Never too soon to practice making those mooselets!” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows; Sam laughed, Castiel smiled, and Dean groaned, throwing a couch cushion at his brother and his angel.
“It’s no big deal,” Sam told him. “Gabe’s planning the Speakeasy’s annual MADD fundraiser. I told him I’d help him this year.”
“The whole reason people go to the Speakeasy, to hear something other than what’s played on the radio,” Sam argued.
“I guess so,” Dean said with a smile. “I think I may head out to the theater tomorrow, too. I haven’t seen
Bobby looked at MJ, and they flanked Lucifer. MJ mouthed “I’m sorry” to her dads as Bobby said “Plan C.” They each took one of Lucifer’s arms and disappeared.
Lucifer pushed Gabriel away. He looked around the ground at the angel trap, then he looked at the others standing there. His demeanor changed back from anger to mild amusement and irritation. He waggled his fingers in their direction and said, “hello Sam, good to see you again, you’re looking well for an archangel’s whore.”
Gabriel looped his arms around Sam’s neck with a smirk and said, “hold on tight!”
Cas blushed a little and shrugged one shoulder. "I've been to many places, but this one made me think of you." He gave Dean's hand a squeeze and the man's face lit up.
"I love you, Sam Winchester," Gabriel told him, "and I'm not letting you go. Ever."
They worked in silence, flipping through pages of rough drafts covered in red ink. When Sam looked up from his pages, he found Castiel squinting at a page, head tilted to one side on confusion. "Find something, Cas?" he asked.
They were both breathing heavy when they finished, laughing together as the hall erupted in applause. They had gravitated towards each other as they played, and Dean was very inclined to kiss Cas at that moment. Rufus’ voice could be heard over the noise until the rest of the hall finally settled down. Cas took his seat, Dean following his lead.
“You’re more than welcome to work on this research with me,” Sam said sweetly, batting his eyelashes at Gabriel. Gabriel just made a yuck face at him before deftly dropping his feet behind his head and rolling onto his feet.
“Just thinkin’, okay? It’s nothing,” Dean said, not wanting to get into it with his brother. He refocused on the sheet music in front of him. “We gonna do this or what?”
“Gabriel was explaining shibari to me,” Castiel told Dean. “He was telling me that it isn’t so much about the rope patterns themselves, but the process. He thought it may be something we would want to explore.”
Sam slowly pulled out and stepped back, Cas turning in place and raising two fingers to his forehead to clean him up. Sam looked down, then back up to Cas with a grin. "Thanks, Cas, glad you enjoyed it. Now can we get back to work? Who knows what other trouble this thing is going to cause all of us."
Of course, they eloped in Vegas when they had a four hour layover at McCarran International Airport. Dean planned that, too, and Cas laughed his ass off at Dean’s foresight.
Gabriel was impressed, and that wasn’t easy to do. Kid must have either had connections or learned to use his mojo, because he was pulling off shit for this date that even Gabriel might have had trouble doing, and he was an archangel.
“Not to worry cuz, the jazz band from the music program over at Kansas State is playing Friday and Saturday night this week. Part of their grades,” Gabriel informed him smugly.
and I’ll clear my schedule for you.” Dean winked at Cas, then took his seat and prepared for practice. A sideways glance told him he succeeded in flustering Cas.
Neither of them saw a point in getting their own place. The mortgage was paid off so there was no rent, and splitting the bills made saving money even easier. They figured if one or both of them decided to get serious with someone, one of them could move out. Probably Sam, since Dean was so attached to the place.
“Ah, so Dean-o couldn’t stand you wanting to be the best,” Gabriel smiled. “Good on you, cuz. Keep being yourself no matter who you’re with.”
Dean stared at his child in horror as she started singing along to
Barely half an hour into the movie, Sammy came home from his night out with Gabe, looking a little worn out. He was a little startled to see Cas there, but lit up at the opportunity to talk with them about another piece he put together. Dean paused the movie as Sammy pulled the handwritten sheets from the piano bench. His little brother was practically beaming as he and Cas went over the music. At the transition from the
“Dear angel,” the woman said with a smile, “thank you for the dance. Now if you don’t mind, I’ll be handing you off to your next partner,” she said with a wink. As she turned, several large men came and grabbed Gabriel by the arms. He looked around frantically for Sam, but couldn’t see him. Before he could call out, a rag was placed over his mouth, and he lost consciousness.
me, you've been inside my head, you know I don't think about my brother like that."
"That's true as well, but if an angel in a human vessel has sex with a human woman, the woman can also be impregnated. They wouldn't be as powerful as a Nephilim created with straight soul and grace," Gabriel explained.
Dean reached to push in the cassette that was in the tape deck but MJ beat him to it, pulling it out and producing an old cassette labeled ‘MJ’s road mix’. “Daughter picks the music, Daddy shuts his cakehole!” she announced gleefully as she pushed it in.
“She’s still a child!”
“I promise,” Cas said in his normal monotone voice, though the quirk of his lips gave him away, “it is actually an appropriate surprise. Gabriel will take Sam and Bobby, while you and I drive down with your mother, Mary Jo, and Sammy.”
Joshua’s smile dropped. “Kevin asked me to come here on his behalf.” At that, Dean and Castiel joined Gabriel. “He believes he has destroyed his friendship with the Winchesters, and has therefore decided to stay in Heaven, so as not to upset them further.”
him have First Chair. He probably assumed I’d go all “heart-eyed” and be satisfied with second chair as long as I was with him.”
awesome they are.
"No powers, Gabriel," Cas panted as Dean worked him open.
Opening a desk drawer and pulling out a bottle of lube (
“You have
He shook that thought out of his head. This wasn’t the kind of music Cas liked at all, so there was no way he’d consider playing it. Best to get that thought out of his head right now. Maybe he shook his head a little too hard, because he thought he heard it rattling.
Sam smiled, a great idea coming to him. “Thanks Cas, I appreciate it.” Cas just nodded and went back to his cat videos. Sam pulled out his own laptop to start researching what he wanted to get for Bobby.
"I didn't," Cas said.
He trudged through practice, playing well enough not to garner any attention from the conductor but not really putting his full attention into it. He was so amped up for the challenge he had to remind himself not to bounce his knees throughout the four pieces they worked on that day. When the conductor called it quits after almost three hours, Dean shot out of his chair and raised his bow, signaling for his attention. The conductor just sighed and waved a hand at Dean to go ahead.
"Oh yeah."
angel won’t break.
MJ snorted. “My dads aren’t much better.”
“I don’t mind the sympathy in the slightest if it means I’ll have company more often,” Lucifer said, sitting in the cage opposite MJ, “but I think you’re wasting your prayers talking to my dad. Self-righteous bastard would never stoop so low as to admitting fallacy.”
“Yes, Dean. Gabriel. He was one of the first angels, he was there to see many fledglings born and assisted in caring for them. He was there when I was born and helped care for me, before he left Heaven.”
"Sounds like a honeymoon to me!" Gabriel said with a good-natured smile. "I'll send Bobby up there with an overnight bag and a credit card to get Cassie settled in, and while you guys are gone we'll get the bunker back in shape."
“We need to fix their timeline,” Sam said, taking a sip of his beer. “We need to find out when everything started going downhill for them and figure out how to prevent that. I don’t want them to suffer, and if we send them back to take care of things then, well…” he trailed off, thinking the worst.
“You said you were working on this with your dad, right?” Sam asked Bobby cautiously. Bobby nodded his head slowly, knowing what was coming. Sam recognized the handwriting in the book as his own. “Who’s your dad?”
“Your nerd is showing, Gabe,” Sam grinned. Bobby just laughed at his dads, wondering why he was worried in the first place. As protective as his Dad was, he knew he loved him.
“I was waiting for him to have his morning coffee before I spoke with him, Gabriel,” Cas said to him, frowning, “and I had hoped to do so without an audience.”
Dean held steady, letting them both adjust. Damn, Cas was tight! When he had a handle on things he asked Cas "good?" Cas just nodded, still panting but looking okay. Dean rocked his hips slowly, pushing in a little more on each thrust. The friction on his dick felt amazing, and he really hoped it felt good for Cas, too.
“We should not have assumed they would fail,” Castiel said, plucking the little white box from Gabriel’s fingers. “After all, they are Winchesters, which means they can do the impossible to protect their family, even at the cost of themselves.” He turned to Dean, holding up the box. “What is this?”
“I don’t wanna hear it, Charlie,” Dean growled at her.
"Whoa!" Dean exclaimed. "What the hell, dude? I'm right here!"
“How’s that going to work, anyways? I mean, Bobby’s still the same age, is he going to have a big brother or sister waiting for him when he gets back to his own time?”
He found the building and parked Baby on the back side. When he found the room he just stood there and stared at the door. He took a deep breath, then knocked.
"And the demons?" Dean asked. "Why do they want the kids?"
“Ha!” MJ laughed sarcastically. “Like God would lift a finger to help us. After what happened to Uncle Gabe, if I ever met God I’d probably kick his ass.”
Castiel let himself into his loft apartment and locked the door behind him. The place was just as empty and sterile as his mother’s house, but he didn’t mind too much. He set his cello next to the front door, toed off his shoes, and headed to his sanctuary, his bedroom. This was the one room that made the loft feel like home to Castiel, with its framed prints of bees landing on various flowers, a bookshelf overflowing with classics, and his turntable and collection of records. He thoughtfully pulled one record from its sleeve and put it on the player, Gershwin’s
"Well, doesn't this look cozy?" Dean said loudly, startling the two at the table. Sam jumped up, red-faced with embarrassment, while Gabriel stood languidly with a smirk on his face.
Two weeks. Almost two

They stood catching their breath. Gabriel, Sam, and Mary walked through the crowd, Gabriel healing those that the Grigori had injured. “Where is Dean?” Castiel asked Kevin, looking worried.
Novak, the straight-laced, buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules classical cellist that had been a pain in Dean’s ass  since he showed up. Cas
Before he could change his mind, Castiel threaded his fingers into Dean’s hair and pulled him back into that brain-melting kiss.
She nodded and led them to the door she'd come from. The majority of the room was taken up by a queen-sized bed with a large dark-stained headboard. There was a matching bookshelf in one corner filled with books and Pop Vinyl figures. The other side of the room had a matching dresser with a large mirror on it. There were strands of ivy threaded with LED lights draped over the mirror's frame, a scarf with sigils covering the top. It was littered with candles, various plants, glass globes, and other objects from nature. A small disc with a triple moon sat in the middle. The computer table was tucked into a corner behind the door.
“I don’t know,” MJ shrugged, “but it’s not a risk I’m willing to take. If I told my dads or uncles, they would agree with me.” She crossed her arms over her chest as though daring her to try to get the information out of her.
MJ helped Cas up and tucked him into Dean's bed, laying down next to him and holding him. Gabriel ushered everyone out of the room and closed the door.
“Excuse me, ’mutual assistance’,” Crowley said coyly. Dean could practically hear the air quotes, and sighed in relief.
Dean paused Guardians of the Galaxy and looked at the caller ID, laughing.
“Movie notwithstanding,” Cas laughed, and Dean agreed with a chuckled “yeah”.
“Yeah, well, I don’t see you guys getting back home like this,” Dean countered. It wasn’t his intention to be mean, but it just pissed Bobby off even more. Baby Sammy started whining and reaching out for Cas. Flustered, Bobby snapped his fingers and disappeared.
“You’re going to kill me, Winchester,” he said, throwing an arm over his face.
“But he’s dead,” Sam whispered, eyes going wide in realization, and Bobby’s jaw dropped.
Gabriel stood up and walked towards Sam. "You deserve happiness and good things too, Samshine," he said. He stopped just outside of Sam's personal space, not making him feel uncomfortable but making him feel
They knocked on the door, and MJ opened it. She gestured them in, closing it behind them. “We gonna wake her up now?” MJ asked. “Kinda wanna to know what bastards did this to her so we can kill them.”
Crowley snapped his fingers to make the same worktable appear that he used the previous day. Same spell components, same spell book, same tools. He set to work and soon MJ was stepping through the cage bars herself, same as Bobby had but more gracefully. MJ turned around and waved. “Bye, Uncle Lucifer. I’ll try to get a copy of that book for you, although I have a feeling I’ll be grounded for a couple decades after this.”
“You are?” Dean and Sam said simultaneously. They were both looking at their mom like she grew a second head.
“But you wish to marry our daughter,” Castiel said with a frown.
Tagging for minor character death.
. That’s more than I’ve gotten from anyone upstairs in millennia. You are officially my new favorite Winchester, now that Sammy is banging my brother.”
Gabriel laughed, knowing this was going to be a glorious disaster. He tipped his glass back as well, finishing it off with a long sigh. “Let the games begin!”
“Not really,” she admitted, looking at her nails. “Being different was kinda hard, but Bobby and I had each other.”
“You wouldn’t believe this guy, Cassie,” Gabriel gushed. “I could climb him like a fucking tree. He’s absolutely gorgeous. And he’s all mine for a few hours every Monday night. Doesn’t even give the waitresses a second glance. I think I’m in love!” Gabriel threw an arm across his forehead, pretending to swoon.
by David Macinnis Gill, which Dean recommended to Castiel. This was much more enjoyable for Castiel and he was actually excited to find some common ground with the handsome man.
Deanna just laughed. "Am I really? I'm sitting in my bedroom with fictional characters who claim to be real and from an alternate reality. I think what sanity I had left is slipping fast."
“Wait,” Dean asked, “what happened at Moondor?”
Dean headed back to his room, dropped his bag, and grabbed a towel and a pair of boxers. On his way to the shower, he ducked his head into Cas' room. On hearing the door open, Castiel looked up and smiled at his hunter.

“I don’t believe you’ll screw things up, Dean. You raised Sam to be a good man, and by all indications Mary Jo will grow into a good woman. Nothing about either of them leads me to believe you will be anything but an excellent parent.”
Dean plopped into his First Chair seat next to Cas, giving him a shoulder bump and a smile before getting ready for practice. He was still riding the highs of Friday night with Cas and a weekend of LARPing with Charlie. He was in a great mood.
Dean pushed the bass line, hitting the strings hard with his bow as Cas pulled his own bow gracefully across the strings for the verses. They both laid heavy on the strings through the chorus before Dean put his bow in his mouth, drumming on the body of his cello through the bridge. When Cas looked back over at him, Dean waggled his eyebrows at him. Cas in turn gave him a lecherous grin as he made his instrument screech and moan as though it was having an orgasm.
What he hadn’t expected was to feel a warm, wet rag dragging over his thighs. He looked up to see Dean, face cleaned off and pants pulled up but not buttoned, gently cleaning their mess off his thighs.  When Dean looked up and caught Castiel’s eye, he gave a sheepish grin.
outnumbered by a family of hip hop lovers. He steadfastly refused to say or even hear the ‘a’ word, wanting as much normalcy as possible. It was still too much for Dean to comprehend that he had created an honest to God-
“Fine,” Sam said with a playful huff. “Next thing you know you’re going to want to make homemade porn.”
Still a dozen shades of red, Dean said, “I apologize in advance for scarring you guys with our behavior.”
“Not if you don’t know classic movies, we’re not,” Dean continued to joke.
"Would you allow me to show you what I'm talking about?" Cas asked Dean seriously.
burger. He’d experimented with different seasoning in the beef, different cheeses, different toppings. At one point, he even tried his hand at baking his own hamburger buns, but found that baking was something he should never do again.
“Sometimes my dad is so stubborn I just wanna strangle him,” she sniffed into Gabriel’s shoulder miserably. “What’s so wrong with being nice to someone, even if they’re not nice to others?”

Gabriel sighed and sank deeper into the hug. “You and me both.” Castiel decided to ignore the moisture he felt on his neck.
"Nifty party trick, huh?" she said with a smile. "I'm a walking, talking demon's trap. Figured that one out over the last year. Besides, I'm spoken for." She dropped his hand and folded hers in front of her on the table. "Now, are you done being a dick? I'd really rather get this over with and head home."
clubhouse?"
Gabriel looked from MJ to Dean and Castiel, trying so hard not to laugh and only barely succeeding. “You’ve had your say, now I’m gonna take a turn here.” He got up and put his arms around his niece. “I love you, but you need to be a little more respectful of your dads.”
Gabriel chuckled at that and patted her on the shoulder. He walked to the bed to put two fingers to the girl’s forehead, but he paused. She looked so young, too young to be serving in the Army, too young to suffer the way she did. He pressed his fingers to her forehead and watched her eyes flutter open first, then go wide with fear.
How the hell was this even his life? Why did it have to be the man that insisted he was the better cellist, that he deserved first chair? And most importantly, how did he get himself another one of those kisses?
" Gabriel yelled, just as Dean's thumb accidentally pushed the cork into the bottle. The liquid almost instantly evaporated and the particles puffed out of the bottle as soon as the cork hit it. Sam and Castiel both dropped what they were holding in order to wave the particles away from them. The glass jar holding the blood shattered, the saint's bone landing in it. Just as Gabriel yelled "
Gabriel had led the woman around the dance floor like a professional, the blonde keeping up with him easily. He was glad that Sam had talked him into dancing with her, it had been entirely too long since he’d been able to dance like this. He led her through double-step turns and dips and intricate footwork that had them drawing a crowd. As the song drew to a close, he gave her an underarm turn before pulling her in and finishing with a dip. As he pulled her up, he held her hand up to kiss it, and she slid one of her bangle bracelets from her wrist, over their hands, and onto Gabriel’s wrist. He felt a weird sort of vertigo, and when he looked down, he saw several angel traps etched into the bracelet.
Cas’ eyebrows furrowed, looking displeased. Dean rushed to explain before he got the wrong idea.
When Sam and Cas arrived back at the bunker, they found the strangest sight-Dean and Gabriel cuddled up on the couch asleep under a blanket, and if Sam didn't know any better, he'd swear Dean wasn't wearing any clothes. He leaned over to shake his brother's shoulder, the blanket sliding down to expose Dean's bare torso.
Gabriel and Cas looked at each other briefly before Gabriel explained, “the kids are getting worried about their timeline. They miss their families and are worried about them.”
“I’m Bobby, that’s MJ,” the boy said as he pulled something from his bag. It was a large, leather-bound book with
MJ just nodded and said, “yes sir.” Lucifer smiled at that. “And what’s your name sweetheart?”
Dean threw a stack of sheet music on Castiel’s chair with a smirk. “Think you can keep up, Cas?” he said, the nickname dripping with sarcasm as always.
"That's what I thought. What's really going on?"
Sam tried explaining as gently as he could, despite how insane it sounded. "We're the real Sam and Dean, and Cas and Gabriel. We're from a parallel universe. We don't know how or why it happened, but we think everything you've been writing about us has been affecting us."
After more shoulder rubbing and kisses, Gabriel’s hands trailed down Sam’s sides to his hips. With a tap to Sam’s ass, Gabriel said, “up on your knees, gorgeous.” Sam complied, letting his arms hang at his sides. With more oil applied to his hands, Gabriel massaged Sam’s thighs and kneaded his ass. He ran his fingers along the junction of his legs and groin, humming to himself.
“I’m not good at this kinda shit Cas. I’ve always been ‘suck it up and get the job done’, you know? And I’ve always done that with Sam. It’s always been just me and him, and no matter what shit we put each other through, we got through it. And it worked, because anytime we let anyone else get too close to us…” he trailed off with a frown. He looked down at their hands, clasped together. “Then you came along. Blew us all right outta the water. You were weird, you acted like a dick, then it turned out the other angels were way worse than you.”
Dean just shrugged and played it cool. “Dunno, just said he had to take off.”
look, and Dean just shrugged.
A week after the accident, Sammy was still in a coma. Gabe said they’d been on their way back from running an errand when the Ford F-250 dually ran the stop sign at the intersection at 55 miles per hour, T-boning Gabe’s Honda Accord on the passenger side. While the momentum threw Gabe’s head through the driver's side window, Sammy had taken the full force of the hit, crushing the right side of his body and leaving a small crater in the side of his head. Gabe had morbidly referred to Sammy’s head as looking like a piece of modern art, concave with shards of glass jutting out and blood dripping down the side, like crystalline flowers dotted with deathly raindrops. The thought made Dean want to vomit.
"And what do you gain by me retaining the throne in Hell?"
MJ and Bobby looked at each other in worry, doing the silent communication thing that everyone has seen Sam and Dean do so often. MJ sighed and waved her hand at Bobby like ‘go ahead’.
Cas nodded, giving it some serious thought.
Castiel just sat up and shrugged. "If that's your choice, Dean. I'll just go find Sam and see if he has paired up with Gabriel or not. He may be amenable to 'hooking up', and he is very well endowed."
Anxiety rolled off him in waves, Dean didn't need the bond to tell him that.
At the end of the show, Castiel approached his mother, Dean right behind him.
"What?" Dean asked impatiently. "What's going on?"
Sam and Dean were sitting at the map table in the war room drinking their coffee and looking for hunts on their respective laptops when Gabriel and Castiel walked in. Sam looked up and could almost see the gears turning in Gabriel’s head. Something was definitely up. Sam nudged Dean, and when his brother looked up at him he nodded his head towards the angels. Dean got the same feeling Sam did.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. “Sonofabitch,” he hissed.
Sam slowly nodded. “Okay.”
, Cas. It’s not supposed to be accurate,” Dean tried explaining as they left the theater.
as he practiced moving with his sword, which he hadn’t done in a millennium. As the music guided his fluid movements, he reached out with his senses and his grace, tuning him into the area surrounding him.
The music room was technically the living room. Dean and Sam had moved back in several years ago to take care of their dad when he had cancer, and after his death neither one of them wanted to move into the master bedroom. Instead, they turned it into their TV room and turned the living room into a space where Sam, who went to school for music education, could give private piano lessons and Dean could pick up some extra cash giving cello lessons. They even kept a drum kit in there, because Dean thought it would be badass to learn how to play it and it made visits from Charlie a helluva lot of fun.
“I know! But I was trying to at least follow their rules and not leave the bunker! Stupid Grigori are still out there gunning for us, Bobby and I aren’t supposed to leave the bunker at all.”
“Absolutely not, Gabriel,” Castiel said. It was the weekend following his pyrrhic victory of a chair challenge. He and Dean were colder to each other than before, causing more headaches to the conductor and the rest of the orchestra for their growing inability to work together.
“H-hey guys,” he said hesitantly. “What’s up?”
Sam had been sitting at his laptop for almost four hours straight, taking advantage of the peace and quiet with Dean and Cas sleeping (or whatever they were doing, he didn't really want to know). He figured if he threw himself into figuring out what was causing all of them to act out all these fanfiction scenarios, he wouldn't have to think about when or why they stopped worrying about the compulsions and just went along with it. Once this whole thing was over they could all try going back to normal. Try being the operative word, especially with Gabriel being back.
“Hey, Deano,” Gabriel asked, he and Sam entering the kitchen. “Where’s Cassie at?”
“No, I don’t think that’s a bit much, short stack,” Dean countered. “She’s my daughter, and unfortunately she thinks a little too much like me. If she thinks she can fix this on her own, I wouldn’t put it past her to try. Just,” he sighed, “just help me keep her safe, ok?”
"Finish? But I'm having so much fun! I'm just dying to hear you beg me for what you want.
Completely spent and feeling as back to normal as they could in this situation, they all sat on the shower floor and let the water run over them, errantly rinsing off the last of the goo. Even after they were all clean, they all just sat there recovering from whatever the hell just happened.
Dean laughed and took Cas' hand in his. "That is awesome! You know what that means, right?"
So now he'd have time alone in a motel with Cas-no kids, no family, nothing and no one to interrupt them. His brain was caught in a loop between loving what they had and wondering what more they
"My room," she replied. "No room anywhere else for my computer desk. Broke-ass single mom, couldn't afford anything bigger."
"There's a spell for that," Sam said, getting up to retrieve their dad's journal.
“Hey, cuz,” he heard behind him, turning to see Gabriel coming towards him. Castiel smiled and gave Gabriel a rather tight hug.
Gabriel read the report that Sam had printed from the CNN website. Something was off. He didn’t see any gunshot wounds on her. Maybe Cas healed them? The area where he found her didn’t look like there had been much vehicle traffic, certainly not a firefight. Maybe the insurgents dumped her after they raped her. Whatever happened, he hurt for her. They always focused on the wars no one else saw. They fought for humanity against Lucifer, against the Horsemen, against Amara, and every other threat the rest of the world knew nothing about. He rarely thought about the wars that the world faced head-on. And now another selfless soldier had paid the price. At least this explained why she was praying for her platoon’s safety, not her own.
“So what happened up there?” Sam asked.
Dean grinned wide at that. “I know, it’s awesome.” He reached into the backseat of the car and pulled out his own copy of the sheet music, then pressed play on the tape deck again. They listened to the song several more times together, following along on the sheet music until the sun had set far enough that they didn’t have enough light to keep going.
“But do they know each other yet?”
to kiss Cas. He was just asking himself how Cas’ perpetually-chapped lips felt, but his body acted before his brain had. He’d tried to extricate himself, excuse himself for his bad manners, but Cas just pulled him back, and he couldn’t say he regretted it one bit. The man’s mouth was pure sin, and Dean wanted to be a sinner.
With a sly smile, Sam turned back to the piano. He started playing the piece, and Dean closed his eyes to try imagining playing it. Without trying, he immediately pictured Cas playing it with him, making him smile again.
“Guys, a little help,” Dean didn’t whine. He felt a desperate need to scratch, but still couldn’t move. With a wave of his hand, Gabriel freed him from the spell so he could scratch away.
Speaking of Fourth of July…
Suddenly, Castiel’s hands were between Dean’s thighs, pushing them apart as his mouth sucked viciously at the tendon in his groin. Dean’s eyes rolled back in his head as he gripped the pillow under his head tightly. His thumbs massaged into the insides of Dean’s thighs, higher and higher as he switched to the other side.
Hours of unpacking things from boxes and reading labels proved fruitless for getting the kids back to 2037, but it was still amusing. Dean had found a hat that made him look like Indiana Jones, and he set it aside for Bobby. They’d found bottled monster parts (presumably for spells) and tried to gross each other out. A spelled box uncovered a pair of enchanted shoes that reminded Dean of the time they dealt with a pair of cursed ballet slippers, so they took a break while Dean told MJ the story about that hunt. MJ found an almost empty jar of powder with a label that simply said “itch”, and she shook a little over her dad’s head. After ten minutes of him scratching and her laughing, he grabbed the jar from her, uncapped it, and flung the few remaining contents at MJ. She stood there waiting for the itch to start, but nothing happened. MJ smiled smugly while Dean continued to itch.
Dean and Cas at a fair or carnival, both in worn jeans and leather jackets. They were wrapped up in each other's arms, kissing, Cas holding a giant blue teddy bear under one arm.
“I mean, you’ve got an awesome body,” he said awkwardly. “I can’t understand how you can eat like that and not look like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.”
Gabriel sighed, looking like he would rather be crucified than talk about it those times. "You gotta remember, this was back in the days before Jesus. Parenthood changes everyone, even God," he tried to joke.
"Yeah?"
“Shhhh, it will be alright,” he consoled his daughter, rubbing her back as he held her. “We all know the risks inherent in what we do, and Dean is a man who puts the safety of others above his own well-being. He would not blame you for what happened, and he would expect you not to blame yourself. Respect him enough to give him that.”
flare again, but it had a distinct bitter feel to it. Jealousy?
As was tradition on Sam's birthday, Dean sat him down and forced him to sit through the
, Dean thought, waving to Cas as he pulled out of the clearing. He couldn’t wait until Friday.
"Come on, let's show them how it's done," she said, grabbing his hand and dragging him over to where she and the others were dancing. Mary and Cas took a seat and let the kids do their thing. MJ and Kevin stood next to each other, looking at each other's feet and bouncing a little in time to catch the beat. On the next chorus of 'to the right', they moved in perfect synchronization with the music and each other. Their moves were more embellished than the basic steps MJ had been teaching Mary and Cas, and the way her moves matched Kevin's exactly, they could tell they had done this before. They finished out the song before MJ threw her arms around Kevin's neck again. He tentatively hugged her back.
"Kevin!" she squealed. She ran over to him and threw her arms around him, startling Kevin even though he was smiling.
Dean looked up from his laptop to see Cas standing there, not in his usual suit and trench coat. Instead, he was wearing a faded pair of blue jeans, a pair of Doc Martens, and an old Journey tour shirt that may have been a size too small but looked good on the angel.
"Yeah, that's what they called it when we all had sex together."
“You’re disgusting.”
“So what does that mean?” Sam asked. “Is he all grace, or does he have any human soul in him like MJ and Bobby?”
"Hey Cas, I think his is bigger than yours," Dean sniggered, pointing at the blade. Cas huffed while Gabriel just laughed.
“Oh, come on Cassie!” Gabriel chided, jumping down from his perch on the counter. “It’s easy to explain!”
MJ just shrugged. “He can be a dick, but he’s a good conversationalist.”
made Dean’s dick twitch. He wasn’t sure if Cas was trying to flirt or stay professional, but either way it did something for him.
“When are you going to give it to him?” Sam asked, standing.
,” Castiel spat at her, “and he
"Like that, Sammy?" Gabriel whispered playfully in his ear. He gave another gentle tug, getting another gorgeous moan out of the man.
Sam just squinted a little, trying to remember before saying, “I don’t remember that, but it makes sense.” He pulled their joined hands up and kissed Gabe’s hand back. “Sorry about that,” he said sheepishly.
“Good night Dean.”
“So, nights in, cooking for each other, playing music together-not your usual kind of dates,” Sam pointed out. “I take it he’s not the asshole you used to think he was?”
shit-eating grin. "Gabriel?"
“Don’t you think that’s a bit much, Deano?” Gabriel asked skeptically.
Cas smiled, slipping the ring back in his pocket. “Thank you, Sam, I appreciate it.”
Sam kissed the top of Gabriel’s head. “Proud of you, Gabe.”
He watched her for a few moments, amazed at the amalgamation of him and his best friend. She had Cas’ black hair and his lean athletic build, but beyond that she was so much like Dean that he felt that’s how he’d be if he were female. She wasn’t a chipper morning person; she was languid yet alert. She blew across the top of her coffee before taking a long, slow sip, releasing it with a groan Dean remembered making just that morning after his first sip of coffee.
Between the angels and the hunters, they had decided to go into Nineveh blind, not wanting to tip off Samyaza. Gabriel would go in first to fight Samyaza. If the other Grigori were there, Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Mary would be on standby waiting for Gabriel to call Cas over angel radio. MJ and Bobby would be in the heavily-warded dungeon with baby Sammy, not wanting to leave them vulnerable in case this was a trap to draw the adults away in order to get to the children. Sam had tried to argue with Gabriel that he didn’t have to take on Samyaza alone, but Gabriel brooked no argument. He had a need to stand against Samyaza alone to find justice for those the Grigori had killed, so Sam relented.
"Yes," Cas replied. "Angel fledglings are nourished solely by grace, whereas Nephilim need both physical and spiritual nourishment. You felt him pulling on my grace through the bond."
“You are correct,” Cas told him, smiling back.
"Hey guys," Dean said with a grin, "check this shit out." He held the jar with his fingers on the bottom and his thumb on the top because
MJ hugged Lucifer then, startling the fallen archangel. “Count on it.” Then she grinned. “But I think I’ll stay on the other side of the bars.”
Gabriel wasn’t one for answering prayers. He heard them all, he couldn’t help it, but he relegated them to the back of his mind. He had other things to do than listen to people begging him for this, that or the other. He had Sam and Bobby and everyone else to worry about. Besides, he still was still getting back to being Gabriel, not Loki.
“Ummmmm,” Sam tried to remember, but couldn’t. Dean just grabbed his wallet and headed outside to pay the cab driver.
Hardly. Gabriel may have been one of the oldest angels, but that didn’t mean patience was a strong suit. Yet there he was, sitting in a lotus position with his eyes closed in the middle of the woods behind the bunker, sorting through all the prayers he was hearing, trying to discern which ones were frivolous and who actually needed him. He heard prayers from single moms who had lost their jobs and didn’t know how they were going to take care of their kids; he heard prayers for sick loved ones; he heard prayers from children who want to be liked at school; he heard prayers for wealth, for fame, for security; he heard prayers of every sort.
“Dean.”
“Watch the teeth, Teach,” Dean growled, playfulness in his own voice.
Gabriel laughed at that, until he turned to Deanna. His laughter died as he was finally able to truly observe her soul. "Cas," he said, never taking his eyes off her. Cas looked at Deanna with his angelic sight and tilted his head in confusion.
“I got this, Pops,” Bobby said, joining them. He dropped his Nephilim blade from his sleeve and handed it to Sam. Sam took it, looking between the blade and Bobby quizzically. When Bobby said
Castiel almost missed the question when he felt the skin on skin contact from Dean. Realizing the man was waiting for an answer, he shook off Dean’s hand and shook his head. “I know
Once they were back in the bunker, MJ wrapped her arms around Dean and hugged him tight. He hugged her back, kissing the top of her head. Then he grabbed her shoulders and held her at arm’s length, looked her straight in the eyes, and said, “you realize that I’m going to find a way to keep you in this bunker until it’s time for you to go back, right?” He hugged her close again. “You can’t keep pulling crap like this. You guys scared the crap out of us.”
Dean woke the next morning to the sounds of
“Why do you gotta be First Chair, Cas?” Dean asked.
“Yeah, kiddo,” Gabriel chimed in, “we can help you untangle the stuff in your head and help you sort it out. It’s what parents are supposed to do for their kids, right?” He looked at Sam. “Right?”
Dean looked up with a tight smile. “Hey, Cas. Whatcha up to?”
“Take a picture, it’ll last longer,” Sam said jokingly, then immediately wished he hadn’t when he saw the wicked gleam in Gabriel’s eyes. “Gabe…”
requires skill. You are an exceptional composer, you shouldn’t sell yourself short.”
as a punk with piercings and colored hair." He turned the laptop around to show Dean pictures that only vaguely resembled himself. "It's a good look on you," Gabriel said with a wink, referring to the picture with a blue mohawk, muttonchop sideburns, a nose ring, a labret under his lip, and a t-shirt that said
“What the hell happened, Dean?” Sammy asked, grabbing Dean by the shoulders. Dean just turned his head to the side and stared at the floor, ignoring his brother. Gabe chuckled and muttered something about not getting any, and that brought Dean’s eyes up in a rage.
“I am unsure if she is mocking us or encouraging us,” Castiel said, clearing his throat, “but I am decidedly uncomfortable with your mother witnessing us expressing our affection for each other.” Dean laughed and pulled Cas back into his embrace. The two men just stood there holding each other, smiling into each other’s necks. With a brief squeeze before stepping back, Castiel tapped Dean on the forehead with two fingers, flying them back to their room and next to their bed.
While Castiel was…
. Only my kids get to call me a witch."
put a lot of hard work into the show, writing those pieces for you guys.” Sammy pulled out the puppy-dog eyes, and Dean almost crumbled. He sighed.
Before Sam could reply, screaming started over at Lady Antonia’s casket. They watched a few bodies fly, reaching for weapons that they weren’t carrying, not expecting to need them. Gabriel dropped both his angel blade and archangel sword into his hands, tossing his angel blade to Sam. Castiel dropped his angel blade into his hand, tossing it to Dean and leaving himself defenseless.
Since they completed their bonding less than a month ago, so much had happened-Sam’s grace addiction, the pregnancy, Lady Toni’s arrival, the immediate threats to the children, and then… well, he still wasn’t ready to think about that. He had forgotten that Sam grounded him, kept him sane and happy. He needed Sam’s calming influence as much as Sam needed him to be silly and playful. They got out of balance and made bad decisions that cost them so much. That ended now.
"Ouch," Dean said, wincing along with Cas. He reached out one hand, gently massaging the spot where the offending feather was pulled from. Cas just sighed and rested his head on Dean's shoulder as the hunter continued his ministrations. "You're family, Cas. Compulsion or not I'm still willing to help where I can." He moved on from the spot he was working on to massage the bases of each feather in that row, straightening them out the best he could.
“Nevertheless,” Joshua said, “it is his choice, and he is determined not to interfere with your lives again.”
Dean had brought a couple sodas out to the music room when Cas returned with his cello, face red. The poor man looked flustered, and Dean almost took pity on him.
Dean breathed, slowly, carefully, feeling himself relax into the awesome blowjob his angel was giving him. Cas slid the tip of his finger in slowly, being as gentle with Dean as Dean was with him their first time, although Cas was much more generous with the lube. As slick as it was, Dean could feel pressure without the burn he’d heard about. It actually wasn’t that bad. And when Cas got that first finger all the way in, Dean was actually enjoying it, rocking his hips against Cas’ hand.
. It’s why he held on tightly to anything and everything that reminded him of her. Sam knew this, and it was probably why he thought he could sucker Dean into helping out with this fundraiser thing Gabe was gonna do. He just didn’t know if he’d be able to deal with the onslaught of memories that he knew would come with it.
"Anyways," Gabriel continued, "the Watchers taught their wives and children forbidden and secret knowledge that corrupted the hearts and minds of mankind which led to the destruction of the Nephilim."
MJ straightened her shoulders and closed the distance between her and Kevin before looping one arm through his elbow. “We have a date,” MJ said confidently, chin held high. “Kevin’s taking me to New York for dinner and to see
Dean was in that comfortable place between sleep and wakefulness. He was warm and his limbs were pleasantly heavy. Something soft and warm was draped over him. He stretched his fingers experimentally, enjoying the texture beneath his fingertips. He rubbed it with a flat palm in slow, gliding strokes, and it moved. He opened his eyes to see Cas curled up to him, using his chest as a pillow. Sometime after they fell asleep last night, someone stripped them both down to their boxers and got them under the covers. He assumed it was Gabriel, considering he was clean as well.
* * * * *
"Yeah," he said hoarsely, "yeah, I do. C'mere angel." He reached out to Cas and his angel crawled into his arms, dragging his entire body along Dean's. Dean kissed the small mark on Cas' neck, making him shudder. "What's this from?" he asked.
Dean looked at him in shock. "Like the handprint you left on me?" Cas nodded, and Dean's heart almost broke. "I'm sorry, angel. I'm so sorry."
When Cas hit Dean’s prostate, his back arched and he let out a pornographic groan. Dean could feel Cas’ smile against his shoulder, and his angel picked up the pace, hitting that sweet spot on every thrust and making Dean cry out. Their sweat-slick bodies slid against each other, and Cas had to hold Dean tighter so that the force of his thrusts weren’t pushing him out of his grasp.
Sam wasn’t processing any of what Castiel was telling him, only understanding that they wouldn’t let him see Gabriel. He howled in rage, pulling at his restraints so hard the headboard groaned under the force.
As Wilson danced alone in the middle of the ballroom while the other dancers were being hauled out by the Nazi forces, they heard a crash in the war room, followed by “a little help here!”
After Sam and Dean were beaten unconscious, the men dragged them out the rear door to dispose of their bodies. What they did not expect was one very unhappy angel of the Lord waiting for them. With a blast of light, all four men were killed, eyes burnt out of their skulls and their bodies smoking. Cas went to work healing the men and trying to revive them.
“Atta boy!” Dean said, slapping Sam on the back and leading him to the kitchen.
“So remember the plan this time,” Dean told MJ. “You stay with Gabriel and Bobby. Lucifer’s going to recognize him as soon as you guys get there, and who knows what he’ll try to do. All you guys have to do is get a hold of him and drag his ass to Stull Cemetery where I’ll be waiting with Sam and Cas, rings at the ready. We have the angel trap already drawn out and surrounded with holy oil to hold him until we can get the cage open. If we can’t get it open, we try the sigils to cuff him and have Gabriel drag his ass to that max security prison in Heaven. Got it?” he asked her, and she nodded solemnly. “Good,” he hugged her. “Now where’s your cousin at?”
With more dexterity and speed than he thought he had, considering all his blood was in his pants and not in his brain, Dean undid his pants and slid them down. Cas groaned as Dean quickly fisted his cock, stroking it only a handful of times before grunting his release, which he aimed for Cas’ thighs. Cas just moaned at the sight and fell back onto the piano.
* * * * *
The door blasted off the hinges, and three Angels walked in, swords drawn.
Sam stood up with their dad's journal in one hand and the legal pad in the other. "Remember a few years back when Balthazar sent us to that alternate universe where our lives were a television show?" he asked his brother. Dean just snorted in the affirmative and crossed his arms over his chest. "Well, it looks like whatever this is resides in a similar universe, one where the actor who played Cas wasn't killed by an angelic hitman. In that universe,
As Dean gently pried the angel blade from Sam’s hand, he calmly told his brother. “I’ll get him for you in a minute, but you gotta listen to me first, okay?” Sam just nodded. “Okay, here’s the deal. You don’t want Gabriel right now; you want his grace.”
Cas sat next to Gabriel in silence, which Gabriel appreciated. He and Sam hadn’t been together long, but he knew the Moose was it for him. If he didn’t make it…
Sam searched the table for it. "Where did you leave it, jerk?"
It was after their second or third dance that a petite blonde woman in full 40’s garb, stiletto shoes, and silver bangle bracelets on both arms approached them. She flirted with Gabriel and asked him to dance, but he politely refused. Sam encouraged him to take a spin around the dance floor with her while he checked in with his brother.
"No they're not, they're awesome," Dean said emphatically.
“Leave it, Sammy,” Dean ground out. He turned on the stereo in the music room, popped in a CD, and cranked the volume before sitting at the drumset. As Led Zeppelin’s
“And by a while you mean…” Dean prompted him.
“It might be a moot point,” Sam told him, “we found out Bobby isn’t a viable vessel. He can’t be possessed by an angel, even if he does give consent.”
“Awwww, Sammy became a stay-at-home daddy,” Dean joked, which earned him a bitchface from his brother.
"Hey bitch, hand me my phone, will ya?" he told his brother more than asked as he went to grab a beer. "Let's get this shit over with so we can call it an early night."
“Agreed,” he said, snapping his fingers. A table with spell ingredients appeared next to him. He moved to the long side of the table, mixing ingredients with a mortar and pestle as the Winchesters and their angels watched him work. When he was done, he lifted the bowl and recited the spell to allow Bobby out of the cage. Bobby’s body fell through the bars as if they were an illusion, landing on the floor. Sam and Gabriel rushed over to him and held him up between them.
"The date is not over yet," Cas told him, "we have one more stop." Cas led him around the corner and into BB King's Blues Club, where a band was setting up. Cas led him to one of the few open tables left and flagged down a waitress, ordering two longnecks.
No non-con warning, the boys are definitely consensual at this stage of the game. Enjoy the shameless smut!
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean grumbled, shaking Sammy off and heading up the stairs to his room.
“Sure, man. Whatcha need?”
Gabriel looked up and saw Sam standing a couple feet from him. “Sam?” he asked, confused. “What the hell are you doing here?”
*  *  *  *  *
The surgeon bent over Gabriel’s abdomen, and starting at the edge of his pubic bone used the angel blade to make a thin incision up to Gabriel’s navel, slicing the skin. Gabriel screamed in agony, the pain so overwhelming he couldn’t move. The surgeon ran a gloved finger down the incision, separating the skin and exposing the muscle. He used the blade again to slice open Gabriel’s abdominal muscle, revealing a small amniotic sac.
“You’re the guy from the park,” Bobby said, garnering looks from the rest of the room. “Who are you?”
. Not like I'd ever thought about taking care of him like
“I’m going to do the first harness,” Gabriel said softly, breath tickling Sam’s ear. “This one will go across your chest. Are you okay for me to keep going?” When Sam nodded, eyes closed, Gabriel picked up a bundle of black rope, stretching it full length before folding it in half. He wrapped his arms and the rope around Sam’s midsection, just below his pectoral muscles. His hands worked deftly but cautiously, wrapping the rope around his back, below his arms, over his shoulder, and across the back of his neck, checking to make sure the rope didn’t pinch at Sam’s skin as he went, before tying it off in the middle of his back. When Sam looked down, the rope formed a pentagram over his chest, Gabriel’s mark showing from the center.
When Cas caught up with Dean, the hunter was pacing around his bedroom. He had an empty beer bottle in one hand, and was working on finishing off the one in his other hand. Cas stood in the doorway just watching him, all coiled strength waiting for something or someone to strike at.
"It's alright, Dean," Castiel told him, also dropping to his knees, "it appears that Gabriel and I have been sent here to care for you two."
“Dad!” MJ yelled. Dean turned to see MJ standing there with baby Sammy and rushed toward them.
Cas looked up at Dean and very drily said, “on the bright side, they weren’t hit by a drunk driver.”
Before Dean could say anything, Gabriel stood up. He placed a hand each on MJ and Kevin’s shoulders and gave them a serious look. “You both know how I feel about this, after what happened. The Grigori are still out there. Are you sure this is a good idea?” he asked them both.
When Bobby finished he looked up at his dad. He’d never really played for anyone but Pops before; this was their thing. His and his dad’s thing was research and writing. He had hoped his dad would like it, but wasn’t prepared for the look of sheer awe on his face.
It was finally over. The Grigori were no more, Lucifer was back in the cage, and Crowley wouldn’t be coming after the kids. The Thule had been eliminated, and Kevin came back to MJ. Everything appeared to have been set right; it was time to get back to the bunker and make preparations to get the kids back to their own time.
.” Sam hoped this would be the clincher, and it was.
“It’s worth a shot,” Dean said.
"Will it do the same to Dean?" she asked, fear in her voice.
“-but Sam still wants
"To her credit, she handled herself very eloquently," Gabriel chimed in.
“Vampire nest story?” Bobby asked around a yawn as he came into the kitchen.
“I highly doubt it,” Cas sighed, “but Gabriel did fly out as far as he could reach, despite knowing his son could not make it that far.” Dean continued pacing. Sammy started whining again, and Castiel bounced him in his arms, shushing him. “I believe you are agitating Sammy. Could you please either stand still or leave the room? I would like to get him to fall asleep.”
“Good, then take your reunion elsewhere, where we don’t have to watch,” Dean said with a smile.
“The Epiphone is a classic and it’s built to last. Excellent choice, Sam.”
"I can't believe they haven't filled you in on anything that happened over the last year," Mary told her. "They told me all about you, they love you to death."
"The baby started pushing at his grace that morning. Both the angels and the demons cornered us that afternoon," she answered quietly.
"What the hell did you do, Dean," Sam demanded. Dean looked pissy, but not repentant.
Gabriel looked over at Sam, who was now turning several shades of red in embarrassment. He nodded at Gabriel, who weakly snapped his fingers and immediately everyone was cleaned up, dressed, and sitting at the table.
Cas sat on Dean's bed propped up against the headboard feeding Sammy from a bottle. He'd had very little experience with newborns but found it amazing, the small bundle in his arms dependent on him for his every need. It was a humbling experience. More amazing was that this baby was part him, part Dean. Or would be.
“I get it Dad, I really do. Don’t you dare apologize, because I don’t blame you. You couldn’t fix it and you didn’t have any answers.” He set the guitar down, climbed off the bed, and hugged his dad. “It’s okay.”
!" Dean ignored him and went to Cas' side, taking his hand. Gabriel was about to yell at him again when the door opened again, Dean standing in the doorway, Sam and the woman standing behind him.
Dean, Sam, MJ, and Bobby joined him at the table; Cas hovered around Mary as she rocked baby Sammy. Dean proceeded to tell them what future Gabriel told him about the kids being pursued on three different fronts.
“You’re being a dick, you know,” Bobby said, standing behind him.
"Because Dean can't stop making goo-goo eyes at that bloody angel of his. I don't see them ever having children."
, but he had yet to play it correctly. He was frustrated beyond belief, so he set aside his cello and turned on his stereo. He fiddled with the buttons until Beethoven’s 5th came on, then began swaying in place with his eyes closed. He wanted to let the music wash over him and wash away the mood he was in, but there was a knock at his door.
“Your angel is being well cared for,” the man assured him. “It was a surprise that he was able to pass through our wards, but an even better surprise that the reason he could was for the very reason we are here.” Dean struggled harder, earning a punch to the face from one of the men restraining him and a laugh from the man in the tux. “You see, your angel has the spark of life we require. You, on the other hand, have nothing we need.” He turned to the men restraining them and waved a hand before walking off. The four men then proceeded to beat the Winchesters to a bloody pulp.
Deanna stared at them like they were insane. "What are you smoking and why aren't you sharing?"
They all stood up, Mary and Dean each taking one of Castiel’s hands. Gabriel snapped his fingers, and they were no longer in the bunker’s kitchen. They were also no longer in their jeans and tees, but they all wore designer suits. Mary was wearing a floor-length emerald green dress that made her look like a model.
Once behind closed doors, Dean and Cas fell into each other’s arms, each kissing the other like a starving man and their lover a buffet. Dean’s hands rucked up Cas’ shirt, itching for the smooth skin underneath, each drag of his fingertips eliciting small gasps from his angel. He alternated pressure, using palms and fingernails, tracing circles and dragging lines until Cas was squirming against him. When Cas moved to undo Dean’s belt and pants, Dean followed his lead until they had slipped their hands into each other’s boxers, palming and stroking each other’s erections. Each stroke had them panting and groaning, and on one particular upstroke Cas threw his head back and let out a loud moan.
“What the hell were you doing to my daughter?” he growled, slamming Kevin against the wall again. Gabriel tried restraining Cas this time, but restraining the pissed off angel was not easy. MJ ran to Kevin’s side, checking him for injuries. Being an angel now, Kevin wasn’t hurt, but he was shaken up.
"Of course it is! And the answer is on your list!" Gabriel grinned, pointing at the legal pad. He
my Papa.”
Sam came up behind Bobby and hugged both of them. He kissed the top of Bobby’s head and murmured “sorry.” Sam was crying again.
“You ok this morning, Dean?” Sam asked, a little startled that Dean was the one invading Cas’ personal space this time. “You’re looking a lot better than you did when you got in.”
Dean smirked, oddly similar to Gabriel's trickster smile. "I don't know about Gabe, but I know Cas can get pretty loud."
“Can’t be,” Dean said matter-of-factly. “They’re Nephilim, which means we would have had to knock up a couple of angel chicks, and we both know that would never happen. They can’t stand us, we can’t stand them, so that’s not even a possibility.”
“What if I have plans right now?” Sam asked playfully. He rubbed his dick against Gabriel’s stomach, half-hard just from the intimacy of Gabriel washing his hair for him.
"Stay," he said with a mischievous smile. Sam was not inclined to disobey. Gabriel sat up and straddled Sam's hips, raising up enough to guide Sam's thick cock to his already opened hole. Sam cocked an eyebrow at Gabriel, who simply smirked at him before slamming down onto Sam in one swift movement, making Sam scream.
Dean pushed himself up on wobbly arms, laughing. “Remind me to thank Gabriel for the soundproofing,” he joked. Cas, whose face was still buried in the mattress, responded with a muffled “of course Dean.” Cas rolled over slightly so he could be heard. “While I enjoyed that immensely, I think I prefer when neither of us are wearing any clothes.”
MJ was able to calm herself somewhat, although at this point she had tears streaming down her face. “Okay,” she said, then was interrupted by another fit of giggles. “Okay,” she tried again, “One year for Valentine’s Day, I think Bobby as twelve and I was fourteen, you and Papa were babysitting us because Uncle Sam and Uncle Gabe went out. You and Papa were kind enough not to start your celebration until after Bobby and I went to sleep, but you didn’t count on him getting up in the middle of the night for something to drink.” She stopped herself from giggling again. “Let’s just say, what he saw required lots of brain bleach.”
Cas looked at him and blinked. "That is where you marked me, Dean, when you shared your soul with me."
“Philistine,” Dean said jokingly, not at all upset that Castiel doesn’t share his pie flavor preferences.
"If Mom needs anything, she'll call," Sam told him. He slid a menu in front of his brother. "Just relax for a while and eat something." Dean grumbled something about the baby needing him, and Sam stuck his finger in Dean's face. "Hey, Sammy is an awesome
,” MJ said, hands on her hips, “he’s still my family.”
and sometimes
“Is there a reason we’re all up so damned early?” Gabriel asked.
With the most innocent look on his face, Castiel simply stated, “Gabriel advised me that Twister is a game best played while either drunk or naked, preferably both. If you’re not too invested in the television, maybe we can compare that to our experience playing it fully clothed at Bobby’s birthday party."
"He's fine," Sam hedged, "sleeping it off, I think. Find anything about what the hell's going on?"
“It’s very good,” Castiel commented. “I think I still prefer cream pies though.”
Castiel picked up the challenge piece. The challenger chose the piece to sight read, and Dean always came up with pieces Castiel had rarely, if ever, heard of. Castiel strictly played classical music, but Dean’s choices always leaned towards movie soundtracks or offbeat pieces. The challenge piece Dean gave him today was called
MJ and Kevin were in her grandmother’s room, MJ rooting through her dresser for something to put on when Mary walked into the room, still holding baby Sammy. MJ and Kevin both spun around defensively when they heard her say, “I wondered what all the
Dean gave Castiel a red-faced death glare as everyone tried their very hardest not to laugh, and not succeeding in the slightest.
"All we need is salt, blood of a lamb, and a bone from a lesser saint," Sam told Dean, Castiel, and Gabriel. The four of them split up, searching the storeroom for the lamb's blood and the bone; they have plenty of salt in the cupboards upstairs. Castiel was the first one to find success, locating a finger bone from Saint Fiacre. Gabriel giggled at that, earning him odd looks from Sam and Dean, who continued to look for the lamb's blood.
Dean sat down on Cas' other side, giving him a shoulder bump and chuckling. "Yeah, and you especially don't have to apologize for your wings, dude. They're badass."
“Speaking of abilities,” MJ said, changing the subject, “I am now demon, angel, and spell-proof. You now have no way of grounding me.” She gave her dads a smug smile, then laughed. “I still can’t believe you thought you could use an angel trap on me.”
“C’mon Cas,” he said, holding out his hand to help his friend up, “let’s go get to know our daughter.”
"I don't know who said what to who or how anyone found out, but there are rumors flying around Heaven about Nephilim, specifically Nephilim working with the Winchesters," he said, taking a seat across from Sam. "And if it got back to me, then it's probably common knowledge, because I don't get out much."
Sam grabbed Gabriel by his shoulders. “Why didn’t we check the cage?”
"It's just weird seeing Dean being so open and tactile," Sam explained. "He's always buried his emotions, especially since he carries all that guilt and feels like he doesn't deserve happiness or good things. I guess Cas is helping him see he does, and I'm happy for them."
the skill,
Gabriel snapped his fingers and a fresh six-pack appeared in the fridge. Dean grabbed a bottle and twisted the cap off, saluting Gabriel with the bottle before bringing it to his lips. He promptly spit it out when he tasted the sickeningly sweet liquid. "What the hell is this shit?" he demanded, dropping the bottle in the trash.
Sam just rolled his eyes, now actively trying to remove Gabriel from his lap. “You know why you can’t leave the bunker Gabe. You’re pregnant and can’t use your grace. You’re a walking, talking target for the same things going after Bobby and MJ.”
“I do know,” he said, standing up. He held a hand out to pull MJ up, too. “But you’re a smart cookie, you’ll figure it out. Now, tell me what you brought me, before your feathered cousin comes to take you away from me again.”
Gabriel was lying on the bed next to him, panting. Sam couldn’t remember if they had just finished round four or round five so far that morning but he didn’t care, he was still rock hard. He got up and kneeled next to Gabriel, pulling him up to his knees.
He cracked one eye open and looked up to see Dean. He was so deep in his mind he never heard the hunter approach. Either that, or Dean is just that damned good. Maybe a combination of both. Dean crouched down next to him, bringing them eye-level.
Cas' rested his forehead on the table and concurred. "Dean is correct. While you two engage in 'prank wars' and other forms of sibling rivalry, this is not the kind of act either of you would engage in voluntarily.
Mary put a hand on Sam’s shoulder and leaned towards him, asking “would you like me to get the holy oil, sweetheart?” Gabriel blanched at that slightly.
“Anna dear?” she spoke into the receiver. “Yes, I’m fine. Would you be a dear and pull all the records on the Grigori for me? Yes, all two hundred of them, even the ones known to be dead.” She stood and pulled a chain containing a locket from her shirt and pulled it over her head, holding it out to Castiel. “I’m sending a seraph named Castiel and an archangel named Gabriel to-”
At a more equal height now, Sam released Gabriel's lips to trail kisses across his face, down his jaw and neck, licking and nipping and sucking everywhere his mouth could reach as he continued to press his groin into his angel's. Gabriel fisted Sam's hair in his hands, panting heavily as the friction steadily grew between them. Gabriel gave his hair a good yank and Sam lost it. He started thrusting faster against Gabriel, humping his cock harder until he bit into the junction where Gabriel's neck met his shoulder to stifle his shouts as he came in his pants like a horny teenager. At the pleasure/pain of the bite, Gabriel's head hit the wall as his own orgasm hit him.
“Does he do this a lot in the future?” Dean asked MJ, pointing at Cas. “Because I’m not sure I like you two ganging up on me like this.”
Gabriel and Sam wandered in at that moment, Sam stunned to see the woman who shot him having coffee with his mother.
“Hey, I gotta find my fun somewhere,” Gabriel said indignantly. “You can take the archangel out of the trickster, but you can’t take the trickster out of the archangel.”
Mary came out of the kitchen then, bringing out a pie with several birthday candles flaming from it, Castiel close on her heels carrying plates and forks. “Happy birthday, sweetie!” she called out. Dean smiled wide, still adjusting to their mom being back. He decided spending his 38th birthday with his brother, his mom, and his best friend had to be a sign that things were going to be alright.
"Yeah," Dean croaked, then cleared his throat and said, "yeah, what's up?"
With bad memories filling everyone's minds, they decided to call a break to the research for the day. Bobby suggested pizza and a movie. When they agreed on what to get (veggie lovers for Sam, meat lovers for Dean and Gabriel, and ham, mushrooms, and black olives for the kids, with an order of breadsticks and marinara for Cas, who still didn't eat food very often but felt he should try to eat something), Bobby and MJ headed out to find Mary; they would have her place the order and drive them into town to pick it up.
Sam cleared his throat to get Jody's attention. She looked over and saw Sam standing next to a short blonde man, holding his hand. Dean had his arm slung over the shoulder of a man just inches shy of Dean's height with black hair and the bluest eyes she'd ever seen. She knew this had to be Castiel. Claire had an old family photo of herself, her mom, and her dad, whose body Castiel inhabited. She raised one eyebrow at them all. "Something you boys wanna tell me?"
Dean let out a laugh at that. “No doubt, dude. Probably got sick of our bitching. C’mon,” he said, picking up his cello and heading towards the door. “Let’s go tell him the good news.”
Even though Cas wasn't thrusting into him particularly hard or fast, Dean felt his orgasm building incredibly fast. He was so close.
Castiel looked up at Sam, then back at the page, then back up at Sam, his eyes taking in the man's body. "How would one know if they were 'perfectly proportional'?" the angel asked, and Sam could hear the air quotes. He went to stand behind Cas to read what he had found. It was another rough draft, a bit older, and Sam blushed furiously when he recognized what he was reading. His marriage to Becky was magically-induced and short-lived, but she was fond of touching him and remarking on his proportions.
Dean stood up from behind the drumset and threw the sticks at the opposite wall. “The
They had the rings. They had a plan. They had a backup plan. They couldn’t afford to waste time driving out to Colorado, so they decided on taking ‘Angel Air’. That meant they were limited on what they could bring with them, so they loaded up their pockets and strapped on what they could. They were as ready as they were going to get.
And as always, whenever one of them thought things were going well, something just
"So she writes to de-stress," Dean said, trying to wrap his head around everything. "How do we keep it from making us fuck each other's brains out?" He turned to Deanna. "You don't deserve to keep hurting, and I get that writing helps you, but I really don't wanna keep having sex with Gabriel or my brother."
Tagging for slight Mpreg delivery and violence.
"What's all the yelling about?" Mary asked as she walked into the room holding baby Sammy. A moment later, Castiel and Gabriel arrived with the kids. Dean went to his daughter and wrapped his arms around her.
"Take whatever you're doing and shove it up your ass," Dean said weakly.
By the time Toni had to return to England, the boys had made copies of all of her files on the Grigori, as well as the Thule Society. They had made plans to comb through each file and compile all the relevant data they’d need, but they had received a call about werewolves out in Dodge City, Kansas. With Gabriel knocked up and powered down and both the Thule and Grigori hunting the kids, Dean made the executive decision that neither Gabriel nor the kids should leave the safety of the bunker, and that Castiel was the best one to protect them.
“You’re doing so good for me, gorgeous,” Gabriel cooed, kissing Sam’s shoulders and running his fingers through his hair again. “Legs are next. Sit back so your knees are bent and your calves and thighs are almost touching.” It wasn’t the most comfortable position for Sam, but he managed. “Your thighs and calves will be tied together, so they’ll stay bent when you’re suspended. The ropes will be wrapped around here,” Gabriel explained, running his hands around Sam’s calves, “and here,” indicating Sam’s thighs. Still good?”
For the longest time, Dean had been adding his own notes to their dad's journal. It happened long enough ago that Dean probably put an entry in for it... "Here it is," Sam said, sitting back down with the journal open in front of him. "Balthazar sent us to parallel universe once, where
Dean shook his head and laughed as he headed to the bar. If he didn’t know his brother was straight as an arrow, he’d think he was gonna make a play for that trumpet player. He wouldn’t give two shits if his brother swung that way, but it would be so much fun to torture him after the shit Sammy had given him the first time he caught Dean kissing a guy. Sam didn’t have a prejudiced bone in his body and was probably the most open-minded person Dean knew, but when the opportunity to rag on his older brother came up, he didn’t hesitate to jump on it.
ass?" Gabriel raised his hand again, pausing long enough for Dean to see what he was about to do, then snapped his fingers. Dean howled as his prostate was assaulted by Gabriel's grace, his entire body shaking despite Gabriel's control over it. With another snap, it ended almost as quickly as it started.
They fought like this for an hour, their bodies a patchwork of pierced metal and slashed fabric, flashes of blueish-white and dripping black barely seen in the fading light. Both knew that they couldn’t continue like this, that one must fall to the other. Desperate, Samyaza charged Gabriel, scimitar directly in front of him, as though he planned to use the curved blade to impale the other angel. Gabriel merely stood there, waiting. A hair’s breadth from Samyaza’s blade and Gabriel turned to one side. As the angry angel’s momentum carried him past, Gabriel’s own speed and trajectory kept him moving in a circle, his blade striking directly through Samyaza’s chest.
Cas moved around so that he was also leaning next to the car, shoulder to shoulder with Dean and the baby between them. “Dean, it will be alright. Sammy will not be able to ‘pop out’ anytime soon, he does not have the control needed to manipulate his wings yet. I’m sure Gabriel will be able to help us with anything we need to know about caring for a fledgling.”
Gabriel pulled Chuck in for a tight hug. “Thanks, Dad.” Chuck pulled Castiel into the hug and embraced his angels. After a moment, they all let go. Gabriel looked over his shoulder and said with a smile, “get your stuff kiddos, you’re going home.”
"As long as you remember who has the bigger dick," Gabriel said with a wink, setting off another round of laughter.
Dean was struck speechless, but felt slightly better. He didn’t have to have sex with Cas for them to have a child. They only had to be bonded, and he had a good idea how that came about.
Castiel and Gabriel flew the Winchesters out to London for Lady Anotnia Bevell’s funeral service. They all stood in the back in black suits, Mary and MJ wearing black dresses, Castiel holding a sleepy Sammy. The head of the British Men of Letters approached
Gabriel looked at her in horror. “Then why the hell do you want to go back?”
Dean shuddered at Cas' blunt words. "It was weird, I felt compelled to do
“Pops taught me,” Bobby said, surprising Sam.
“It was worth a shot,” Gabriel said. “Oh well, Heaven’s got a newly remodeled prison, and I’m sure we could find you some primo accommodations.”
“Yeah,” he laughed, “bet you couldn’t get your angel to cut loose like that.”
"Whoa, okay, I missed you too, angel." His head was spinning as Cas worked his tongue and lips down his body. Cas ran the flat of his tongue across one nipple before flicking it with the tip and Dean's back arched involuntarily. Cas liked that reaction, working Dean's nipples with his lips, his tongue, his teeth, until Dean was panting. Who knew his nipples were so fucking sensitive?
“I know, Dad,” Bobby said, hugging him back. Sam slapped his back, then headed out. Bobby turned to Gabriel. “Seriously, you don’t have to make everything a competition, I love you both the same.”
The men and angels looked at each other while they pondered this. Dean, of course, hadn’t thought of that. Yeah, he’s smart in a fight and quick on his feet but he wasn’t a nerd like Sammy. Sam, on the other hand, had thought about it until it made his head hurt with possibilities and probabilities and alternate timelines and multiverse theory, hoping one of the kids hadn’t brought any bugs with them from the future. Now they were starting to get down to brass tacks on what they needed to do to help their kids.
“I thought that the demon may have possessed a child long enough to sell the bracelets at a fair, and found that one student who was selling jewelry at the fair doesn’t remember that day at all. I emailed her to see if she had any left, and she said no. Her mom said she sold eleven pairs of that particular bracelet.” Bobby told them. “We’ve had eight victims so far, including the one death. That means there are still three more people who could possibly die if the demon is still out playing with them.”
Gabriel laughed. “Fair enough.” He stood up, pulling Sam along with him and helping him keep his balance. “Wanna see a cool trick?” he asked, waggling his eyebrows.
Sam's movements pushed Cas against Dean in a rhythmic motion, causing Dean's dick to rub against his hole and catch against the rim. He was still loose from his earlier encounter with Sam, but no way was Dean about to go in dry. He tried to get Cas' attention, but the angel was happily humping away. Dean sighed and looked over Cas' shoulder at his brother and said, "hey, Sammy, need some lube here."
Sam put his hand on his brother’s shoulder, looking him in the eye. “You know we’ll do our best.”
raise him from perdition and rebuilt his body atom by atom, and already knew every part of him inside and out. On the other hand, Cas didn't know him
That thought made Sam's mouth go dry. He was a big guy, and he was big everywhere. He had about eight inches on the archangel. No way was Gabriel packing anything close to what he was.
“Yes,” Castiel agreed, “we’re all proud of you Gabriel.”
"This isn't what it looks like," Dean said, stepping towards the woman with his hands up defensively.
It took a few days for the family to restore power to the bunker (they had to wait until power was restored to the area first), clean everything up, replace bulbs, and repair glass. Then it took another couple of days to repeat the process when Gabriel talked Sam into trying to outdo Dean and Castiel ("C'mon Sammy, I know I can do better!" At least they found out the bunker was earthquake-proof.). It might have gone faster if Sam and Dean were working at full speed, but both Winchesters absolutely refused their angels' offers to heal the glorious aches they caused.
“Don’t worry about your dishes, Cas,” Dean told his friend. “You can pick them up next time you come over. You good for Friday again?”
"I know, Dean," the angel replied. "Did you feel compelled to be intimate with Sam? This may have been the same thing that compelled Gabriel and I to perform oral sex on you two."
“Sam’s up!” he heard Gabe say excitedly. “Doc’s checking him out now, running some tests, but he’s up!”
“I think that calls for a round of beers!” Dean said cheerfully. “Want us to restart the movie for you guys?”
Everyone looked confused at his remark, except maybe Cas.
“Yeah, still good.”
So they all sat down, filling everyone in on everything they talked about in Rome. Gabriel snapped up snacks for all of them as they talked, enjoying how happy Sam looked as he laughed and chatted with his family and Kevin. The archangel would do anything to keep that smile on his hunter's face.
“Goddammit, we never checked the cage!” Dean said, racing out. Cas was on his heels, still carrying baby Sammy, who was thankfully starting to calm down. They found Sam and Gabriel in the library, Gabriel pacing while Sam went through book after book, surrounded by piles of them.
Once in the room, Gabriel yelled for Sam to start the spell to send Dean back. Sam got to work on mixing the ingredients as the plaster started cracking from the walls. Gabriel grabbed past Dean's shoulders again to get his attention.
When Dean and Castiel walked into the kitchen that morning, it was to find Lady Toni and Mary sitting at the table drinking coffee. Toni was holding baby Sammy, which put Castiel in full-on guardian angel mode. At least one light bulb popped, startling the women from their conversation. Cas purposefully strode over to Lady Toni and removed the baby from her arms before returning to Dean’s side.
